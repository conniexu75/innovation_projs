https://openalex.org/W2039824115,"Autosomal recessive juvenile parkinsonism (AR-JP) is caused by mutations in the parkingene. Parkin protein is characterized by a ubiquitin-like domain at its NH2-terminus and two RING finger motifs and an IBR (in between RING fingers) at its COOH terminus (RING-IBR-RING). Here, we show that Parkin is a RING-type E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase which binds to E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes, including UbcH7 and UbcH8, through its RING-IBR-RING motif. Moreover, we found that unfolded protein stress induces up-regulation of both the mRNA and protein level of Parkin. Furthermore, overexpression of Parkin, but not a set of mutants without the E3 activity, specifically suppressed unfolded protein stress-induced cell death. These findings demonstrate that Parkin is an E3 enzyme and suggest that it is involved in the ubiquitination pathway for misfolded proteins derived from endoplasmic reticulum and contributes to protection from neurotoxicity induced by unfolded protein stresses.

These facts suggest that Parkin, which contains a RING-IBR-RING motif, is a new member of E3 ubiquitin ligases.On the other hand, the fact that the deletion of the parkingene causes the neuronal death of the substantia nigra in AR-JP patients suggests the cell-protective function of Parkin. Given that Parkin is involved in both the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway and cell death protection, an interesting possibility is that Parkin may inhibit a certain type of cell death through proteasome-mediated protein degradation. Accumulation of misfolded proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) would constitute an unfolded protein stress or ER stress, which may lead to cell death. Normal cells deal with unfolded protein stress by several mechanisms, including transcriptional induction of genes that facilitate protein folding or removal of misfolded proteins and degradation that is dependent on the cytosolic ubiquitin-proteasome pathway (11Mori K. Cell. 2000; 101: 451-454Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (784) Google Scholar).Here, we provide evidence that Parkin is a RING-type E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase. Moreover, we show that Parkin is up-regulated in response to unfolded protein stress and suppresses unfolded protein stress-induced cell death via its E3 activity, suggesting that the physiological role of Parkin involves dealing with unfolded protein stress.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONTo study the physiological function of Parkin in cells, we overexpressed Parkin with NH2-terminal FLAG tag (FLAG-Parkin) in several cell lines, including human kidney-derived 293(T) cells and dopaminergic neuroblastoma-derived SH-SY5Y cells. Overexpression of FLAG-Parkin in any cell line used led to the formation of slower migrating proteins that were recognized by a Western blot using anti-FLAG Ab (Fig.1 A). As this high molecular weight smear-like appearance of FLAG-Parkin seemed to be caused by polyubiquitin, we examined whether Parkin could be covalently modified by ubiquitin. An expression plasmid encoding ubiquitin with a hemagglutinin tag (HA-Ub) was transfected into 293T cells with or without plasmid for FLAG-Parkin, followed by immunoprecipitation with anti-FLAG Ab. A Western blot analysis of immunoprecipitates with anti-HA Ab showed a high molecular weight shifted band only when HA-ubiquitin and FLAG-Parkin were co-expressed, indicating that FLAG-Parkin is heavily ubiquitinated. Western blots of the same samples using anti-FLAG Ab detected high molecular weight smear bands when FLAG-Parkin was expressed, regardless of the presence or otherwise of HA-ubiquitin. However, the average size of the smear band was smaller in the absence rather than the presence of HA-ubiquitin, suggesting that FLAG-Parkin is modified with endogenous ubiquitin in the former case (Fig. 1 B, left). Overexpression of the K48R-ubiquitin mutant, which disrupts polyubiquitin chain formation, caused significant inhibition of ubiquitination of Parkin (13Arnason T. Ellison M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 7876-7883Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar, 14Finley D. Sadis S. Monia B.P. Boucher P. Ecker D.J. Crooke S.T. Chau V. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5501-5509Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar) (Fig.1 C). The same data was obtained with α-synuclein, which was also ubiquitinated when overexpressed in 293T cells (Fig. 1 B, right panel, and C). Although ubiquitin carboxyl-terminal hydrolase (UCH) family enzymes are generally thought to hydrolyze adducts with small, unfolded leaving groups, some UCHs, including Drosophila UCH, are shown to have ability to deubiquitinate polyubiquitinated proteins (15Roff M. Thompson J. Rodriguez M.S. Jacque J.M. Baleux F. Arenzana-Seisdedos F. Hay R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7844-7850Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). High molecular weight shifted FLAG-Parkin as well as ubiquitinated α-synuclein were efficiently processed by overexpressed UCH-L1 (PGP9.5), a human UCH enzyme, providing further evidence that Parkin is ubiquitinated when overexpressed in cells (Fig. 1 C).Recently, several proteins containing the RING finger motif have been shown to be E3 ubiquitin-protein ligases. Moreover ubiquitination of some of these RING-type E3s has been demonstrated previously (7Lorick K.L. Jensen J.P. Fang S. Ong A.M. Hatakeyama S. Weissman A.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 11364-11369Crossref PubMed Scopus (937) Google Scholar,9Yang Y. Fang S. Jensen J.P. Weissman A.M. Ashwell J.D. Science. 2000; 288: 874-877Crossref PubMed Scopus (861) Google Scholar). Therefore, we examined whether Parkin is a RING-type E3. We first performed a co-immunoprecipitation assay using FLAG-Parkin and a set of Myc-tagged E2s co-expressed in SH-SY5Y cells. FLAG-Parkin associated with Myc-UbcH7 and closely related Myc-UbcH8, but not with Myc-UbcH5a, -H5b, -H5c, or -H6. This binding pattern was identical to that of Ariadne, a protein containing a RING-IBR-RING motif at its COOH terminus, which is structurally very similar to Parkin (16Moynihan T.P. Ardley H.C. Nuber U. Rose S.A. Jones P.F. Markham A.F. Scheffner M. Robinson P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30963-30968Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) (Fig.2 A). Next, we tried to determine the position of E2-binding domain of Parkin. We co-expressed a wild-type or several deletion/point mutants of FLAG-Parkin with Myc-UbcH7 in SH-SY5Y cells, then performed immunoprecipitation with anti-FLAG antibody followed by Western blotting by anti-Myc Ab. A deletion mutant containing only the RING-IBR-RING domain (RIR) bound to UbcH7 as potently as wild-type protein. By contrast, all the other mutated Parkin proteins, including deletion mutants missing Exons 3 and 4 (Ex3–4(−)), Exon 4 (Ex4(−)), an IBR and the second RING (Q311X), the second RING-deleted mutant (ΔRING), and a mutant with a point mutation in the first RING (T240R) completely failed to interact with Myc-UbcH7. (Fig. 2 B). Essentially, the same result was obtained with Myc-UbcH8 (data not shown). These data indicate that the RING-IBR-RING domain of Parkin is responsible for binding with UbcH7, strongly suggesting that Parkin is a RING-type E3 associated with UbcH7 and H8.Figure 2Parkin has an E3 ubiquitin ligase activity. A, SH-SY5Y cells were transfected with vector (Control), Myc-UbcH5a, -5b, -5c, -6, -7, -8 with (+) or without (−) FLAG-Parkin. The lysates were subject to immunoprecipitation with anti-FLAG and detected by Western blotting with anti-Myc. B, SH-SY5Y cells were transfected with vector (Control), wild-type, or mutant Parkins with FLAG-tag (ΔRING is a deletion mutant of the second RING.) and Myc-UbcH7. Immunoprecipitation was performed as in A. C, Parkin and its mutant were immunopurified from 293T or SH-SY5Y cells transfected with vector (Cont.), FLAG-Parkin (Parkin), and a deletion mutant of exon 4 with FLAG tag, (Ex4(−)). An in vitro ubiquitin-ligase assay was carried out by adding yeast E1 (0.45 pmol) and recombinant 6 × His-tagged UbcH7 (3 pmol) and GST-Ub (167 pmol) to the immunopurified wild-type and mutant Parkin proteins in reaction buffer (50 mm Tris, pH7.4, 5 mm MgCl2, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 2 mm adenosine 5′-triphosphate) at 30 °C for 90 min (90). Reactions were terminated with 3 × SDS sample buffer containing 280 mm 2-mercaptoethanol and samples resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, after which Western blotting with anti-GST was performed (upper panel). The immunoprecipitated Parkin and its mutant were confirmed on the same membrane by Western blotting with anti-FLAG Ab (lower panel).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To obtain direct evidence that Parkin exhibits E3 activity, we performed an in vitro ubiquitin ligase assay. Immunoprecipitates of full-length FLAG-Parkin or an Ex4(−) deletion mutant (Ex4(−)) from two different cell types (293T and SH-SY5Y cell) were incubated with recombinant yeast E1, bacterially produced 6 × histidine-tagged UbcH7 and GST-ubiquitin. Western blotting using anti-GST antibody detected a high molecular weight band indicative of ubiquitinated protein(s) only with full-length Parkin, but not with Ex4(−) or control (Fig. 2 C), thereby proving the in vitro E3 activity of Parkin. The ubiquitinated substrate(s) in this reaction are thought to be cellular protein(s) associated with Parkin, but not Parkin itself, as the band sizes observed differed from that of Parkin. On the other hand, ubiquitination of Parkin was not reproduced in this in vitro assay, suggesting that Parkin may require other cellular factor(s), including different E2(s) to be ubiquitinated (Fig. 2 C, lower panel). Consistent with this idea, wild-type and T240R mutant Parkin proteins are similarly ubiquitinated in cells, although UbcH7 does not bind to the latter (Fig. 2 B). Regarding E3 activity of Parkin, more prominent ubiquitination is observed in immunoprecipitates from SH-SY5Y cells than in those from 293T cells, suggesting that expression of the substrates for Parkin is neuronal cell type-specific.During the preparation of this manuscript, Shimura et al. (17Shimura H. Hattori N. Kubo S.-I. Mizuno Y. Asakawa S. Minoshima S. Shimizu N. Iwai K. Chiba T. Tanaka K. Suzuki T. Nat. Genet. 2000; 25: 302-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (1682) Google Scholar) reported that Parkin is an E3 protein with characteristics identical to those shown here, except that overexpressed Parkin was not ubiquitinated in their system. Although the reasons for this apparent discrepancy are not clear, it is conceivable that better expression in our cells enabled us to detect the ubiquitination of Parkin.As dysfunction of Parkin is thought to lead to selective neuronal cell death, we sought evidence for a role for Parkin in neuronal cell death induced by various stresses including unfolded protein stress. mRNA levels of Parkin in SH-SY5Y cells cultured under various stress conditions for 5 h were measured by quantitative RT-PCR (Fig.3 A). No change or only a slight reduction was observed in the Parkin mRNA level under a variety of stress treatments, including hydrogen peroxide (H2O2; 600 μm), high osmolarity (0.3 m sorbitol), the DNA alkylating agent (methyl methanesulfonate (MMS); 100 μg ml−1), short wavelength ultraviolet light (UV; 40 J m−2) and heat shock (42 °C, 1 h). In contrast, treatment with the N-glycosylation inhibitor tunicamycin (Tuni; 10 μg ml−1) or the reducing agent 2-mercaptoethanol (2-ME; 7.5 mm), either of which is an effective inducer of unfolded protein stress (18Nakagawa T. Zhu H. Morishima N. Li E. Xu J. Yankner B.A. Yuan J. Nature. 2000; 403: 98-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (2926) Google Scholar, 19Niwa M. Sidrauski C. Kaufman R.J. Walter P.

Science. 2000; 287: 664-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (2281) Google Scholar), resulted in significant up-regulation of Parkin mRNA compared with no treatment control (p< 0.001). Next, we examined the expression levels of Parkin mRNA in cells treated with tunicamycin or 2-ME for up to 24 h. Specific up-regulation of Parkin mRNA was observed in tunicamycin- or 2-ME-treated cells (p < 0.001), whereas no significant change was seen in untreated cells at 24 h (Fig. 3 B). Consistent with the observation of Parkin mRNA up-regulation, the Parkin protein expression level was increased severalfold during the unfolded protein stress tests (Fig. 3 C).Figure 3Parkin is up-regulated by unfolded protein stress. A, SH-SY5Y cells were treated with a variety of stresses. After 5 h, total RNA was extracted and subject to quantitative RT-PCR using a Parkin-specific probe and primers. Messenger RNA level of each sample was normalized by glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) level. The mRNA levels of Parkin represent the -fold increase compared with the amount obtained from no treatment (Control). Theerror bars represent the S.D. calculated from triplicate samples.

Anarrowhead indicates the protein of unknown nature, which was reproducibly detected by anti-Parkin Ab only in tunicamycin-treated samples; it may represent a processed form of Parkin. ER stress response was assessed by the induction of GRP78 (BiP). Total protein level of each sample was confirmed by the amount of actin.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Based on this observation, we anticipated that the up-regulation of Parkin might protect cells from unfolded protein stress. To investigate whether Parkin suppresses unfolded protein stress-induced cell death in neuronal cells, we performed an unfolded protein stress-induced cell death assay using SH-SY5Y cells (Fig. 4,A and B). Parkin-transfected cells were significantly more resistant to unfolded protein stress-induced cell death following treatment with either 3 mm 2-ME or 10 μg ml−1 tunicamycin for 24 h (p < 0.01 versus control cells). In contrast, mutated Parkin proteins that had no E2 recruiting activity (Ex4(−), T240R) had no anti-cell death activity at all, indicating that the E3 ubiquitin ligase activity of Parkin is essential for the suppression of unfolded protein stress-induced cell death (Fig.2 B). No differences among the percentages of dead cells in wild-type Parkin, mutated Parkin cDNAs, and empty vector transfectants treated with H2O2 for 24 h were observed. On the other hand, XIAP, an endogenous inhibitor of cell death proteases (caspase-3/-7/-9) (21Deveraux Q.L. Reed J.C. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 239-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (2264) Google Scholar), suppressed cell death induced by any of these stress treatments. These results indicate that Parkin specifically blocks unfolded protein stress-induced cell death rather than acting as a general cell death inhibitor. Consistent with the idea that Parkin exerts an anti-cell death function through ubiquitin-proteasome-mediated protein degradation, the protective effect of Parkin over 2-ME or tunicamycin-induced cell death was significantly reduced by treatment with lactacystin, a potent proteasome inhibitor (p < 0.01 versusuntreated cells) (Fig. 4 C).Figure 4Parkin suppresses unfolded protein stress-induced cell death. A, SH-SY5Y cells were transfected with empty plasmid (vector), FLAG-Parkin, Ex4(−), T240R, or XIAP with pEGFP vector. After 24 h, cells were treated with or without (No), H2O2 (600 μm), 2-ME (3 mm), or tunicamycin (Tuni, 10 mg ml−1) for 24 h, then about 300 GFP-positive cells were counted. Of them, cells with round or shrunken shapes were counted as dead cells (Morphology), or propidium iodide dye exclusion assay was performed (PI).

Cell death assay was performed as inA. *, p < 0.01.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)In response to stress in the ER, the unfolded protein response (UPR), which regulates gene expression, is induced. A very recent DNA microarray study revealed that UPR up-regulates multiple ER and secretory pathway genes, including ER-associated protein degradation (ERAD)-related genes in yeast (22Travers K.J. Patil C.K. Wodicka L. Lockhart D.J. Weissman J.S. Walter P. Cell. 2000; 101: 249-258Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1571) Google Scholar). The ERAD system eliminates misfolded ER proteins via degradation in the cytosol. ERAD substrates are retrotranslocated across the ER membrane into the cytosol, where they are degraded through the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway (23Plemper R.K. Wolf D.H. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 266-270Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). It is an interesting hypothesis that Parkin-E3 may be involved in ERAD, since it is located in microsomal fractions in addition to the cytosol and Golgi fractions (24Shimura H. Hattori N. Kubo S. Yoshikawa M. Kitada T. Matsumine H. Asakawa S. Minoshima S. Yamamura Y. Shimizu N. Mizuno Y. Ann. Neurol. 1999; 45: 668-672Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). The deletion of the parkin gene may lead to accumulation of misfolded substrate protein(s) in the ER, resulting in the nigral cell death that causes AR-JP. AR-JP1 is one of the most common forms of the familial Parkinson's diseases and is characterized by juvenile onset, a recessive mode of inheritance and selective loss of the dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra without Lewy bodies (intraneuronal accumulations of aggregated proteins) (1Yamamura Y. Sobue I. Ando K. Iida M. Yanagi T. Kono C. Neurology. 1973; 23: 239-244Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In 1998, the gene responsible for AR-JP was identified and designated parkin (2Kitada T.

Recently, several proteins with RING finger motifs have been identified as E3 ubiquitin ligases, which are responsible for substrate recognition and for promotion of substrate ubiquitination in conjunction with ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes (E2s) (3Dawson T.M.

These facts suggest that Parkin, which contains a RING-IBR-RING motif, is a new member of E3 ubiquitin ligases. On the other hand, the fact that the deletion of the parkingene causes the neuronal death of the substantia nigra in AR-JP patients suggests the cell-protective function of Parkin.

Moreover, we show that Parkin is up-regulated in response to unfolded protein stress and suppresses unfolded protein stress-induced cell death via its E3 activity, suggesting that the physiological role of Parkin involves dealing with unfolded protein stress. RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONTo study the physiological function of Parkin in cells, we overexpressed Parkin with NH2-terminal FLAG tag (FLAG-Parkin) in several cell lines, including human kidney-derived 293(T) cells and dopaminergic neuroblastoma-derived SH-SY5Y cells.

However, the average size of the smear band was smaller in the absence rather than the presence of HA-ubiquitin, suggesting that FLAG-Parkin is modified with endogenous ubiquitin in the former case (Fig. 1 B, left). Overexpression of the K48R-ubiquitin mutant, which disrupts polyubiquitin chain formation, caused significant inhibition of ubiquitination of Parkin (13Arnason T. Ellison M.J. Mol. Cell.

The same data was obtained with α-synuclein, which was also ubiquitinated when overexpressed in 293T cells (Fig. 1 B, right panel, and C). Although ubiquitin carboxyl-terminal hydrolase (UCH) family enzymes are generally thought to hydrolyze adducts with small, unfolded leaving groups, some UCHs, including Drosophila UCH, are shown to have ability to deubiquitinate polyubiquitinated proteins (15Roff M.

High molecular weight shifted FLAG-Parkin as well as ubiquitinated α-synuclein were efficiently processed by overexpressed UCH-L1 (PGP9.5), a human UCH enzyme, providing further evidence that Parkin is ubiquitinated when overexpressed in cells (Fig. 1 C).Recently, several proteins containing the RING finger motif have been shown to be E3 ubiquitin-protein ligases. Moreover ubiquitination of some of these RING-type E3s has been demonstrated previously (7Lorick K.L. Jensen J.P. Fang S. Ong A.M. Hatakeyama S. Weissman A.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Therefore, we examined whether Parkin is a RING-type E3. We first performed a co-immunoprecipitation assay using FLAG-Parkin and a set of Myc-tagged E2s co-expressed in SH-SY5Y cells.

This binding pattern was identical to that of Ariadne, a protein containing a RING-IBR-RING motif at its COOH terminus, which is structurally very similar to Parkin (16Moynihan T.P. Ardley H.C.

Next, we tried to determine the position of E2-binding domain of Parkin. We co-expressed a wild-type or several deletion/point mutants of FLAG-Parkin with Myc-UbcH7 in SH-SY5Y cells, then performed immunoprecipitation with anti-FLAG antibody followed by Western blotting by anti-Myc Ab. A deletion mutant containing only the RING-IBR-RING domain (RIR) bound to UbcH7 as potently as wild-type protein. By contrast, all the other mutated Parkin proteins, including deletion mutants missing Exons 3 and 4 (Ex3–4(−)), Exon 4 (Ex4(−)), an IBR and the second RING (Q311X), the second RING-deleted mutant (ΔRING), and a mutant with a point mutation in the first RING (T240R) completely failed to interact with Myc-UbcH7.

However, several studies have proposed heterogeneity of the H3 receptor. We report here the molecular cloning and characterization of a novel type of histamine receptor. A novel orphan G-protein-coupled receptor named GPRv53 was obtained through a search of the human genomic DNA data base and analyzed by rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE). GPRv53 possessed the features of biologic amine receptors and had the highest homology with H3 receptor among known G-protein-coupled receptors. Mammalian cells expressing GPRv53 were demonstrated to bind and respond to histamine in a concentration-dependent manner. In functional assays, not only an H3 receptor agonist,R-(α)-methylhistamine, but also a H3 receptor antagonist, clobenpropit, and a neuroleptic, clozapine, activated GPRv53-expressing cells. Tissue distribution analysis revealed that expression of GPRv53 is localized in the peripheral blood leukocytes, spleen, thymus, and colon, which was totally different from the H3 receptor, whose expression was restricted to the brain. The discovery of the GPRv53 receptor will open a new phase of research on the physiological role of histamine.

G-protein-coupled receptor cyclic AMP-responsive element luciferase transmembrane R-(α)-methylhistamine fluorescence imaging plate reader polymerase chain reaction Histamine is an important physiological amine that works as a chemical messenger to exert numerous functions in central and peripheral tissues. These effects are mediated through three pharmacologically distinct subtypes of receptors, i.e. the H1, H2, and H3 receptors, which are all members of the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR)1 family (1Hill S.J. Ganellin C.R. Timmerman H. Schwartz J.C. Shankley N.P. Young J.M. Schunack W. Levi R. Haas H.L. Pharmacol. Rev. 1997; 49: 253-278PubMed Google Scholar). H1 receptor is distributed in the brain, most smooth muscle cells, endothelial cells, adrenal medulla, and heart. H1 receptor plays roles in smooth muscle contraction, stimulation of nitric oxide formation, endothelial cell contraction and in increasing vascular permeability, all of which have close relationships with allergic conditions. H1 receptor preferentially couples to the Gq/11 family of G-proteins and causes mobilization of intracellular Ca2+ in a pertussis toxin-insensitive fashion (2Hill S.J. Pharmacol. Rev. 1990; 42: 45-83PubMed Google Scholar, 3Leurs R. Smit M.J. Timmerman H. Pharmacol. Ther. 1995; 66: 413-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). The human H1 receptor gene is localized on chromosome 3p25 (4Fukui H. Fujimoto K. Mizuguchi H. Sakamoto K. Horio Y. Takai S. Yamada K. Ito S. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1994; 201: 894-901Google Scholar). The H2 receptor causes cyclic AMP (cAMP) accumulation through activation of a G-protein, Gs, in the gastric cells (5Gespach C. Bouhours D. Bouhours J.F. Rosselin G. FEBS Lett. 1982; 149: 85-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), cardiac tissues (6Johnson C.L. Weinstein H. Green J.P. Mol. Pharmacol. 1979; 16: 417-428PubMed Google Scholar), and other cell types including smooth muscle cells and immune cells (1Hill S.J. Ganellin C.R. Timmerman H. Schwartz J.C. Shankley N.P. Young J.M. Schunack W. Levi R. Haas H.L. Pharmacol. Rev. 1997; 49: 253-278PubMed Google Scholar). In the gastric cells, H2 receptor has been demonstrated to function as a key molecule for gastric acid secretion, which has been an important drug target for gastrointestinal ulcers (7Soll A.H. Walsh J.H. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1979; 41: 35-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). A chromosomal mapping study indicated that the H2 receptor gene is located on human chromosome 5 (8Traiffort E. Vizuete M.L. Tardivel-Lacombe J. Souil E. Schwartz J.C. Ruat M. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1995; 211: 570-577Google Scholar). The H3 receptor was originally advocated as a presynaptic autoreceptor for histamine synthesis localized in histamine-containing neuron in the central nervous system (9Arrang J.M. Garbarg M. Schwartz J.C. Nature. 1983; 302: 832-837Crossref PubMed Scopus (1482) Google Scholar). Several studies using H3 selective agonists revealed that H3 receptor couples to pertussis toxin-sensitive Gi/o protein (10Endou M. Poli E. Levi R. J. Pharmacol. Exp.

With respect to the H3 receptor, however, there has been increasing pharmacological evidence implying the existence of additional types of receptors, which are still unknown at the molecular level (14West Jr., R.E.

The present study reports the molecular cloning of a novel type of histamine receptor named GPRv53 that is preferentially expressed in the peripheral blood leukocytes. With expression of GPRv53 in mammalian cells, functional assays were carried out to analyze the effects of histamine receptor agonists and antagonists. By performing a BLAST search (19Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (71456) Google Scholar), three overlapping clones showing homology with GPCR super family genes were found in the HTGS (high through-put genome sequence) division of GenBankTM (accession numbers AC007922,AC009668, and AP001327). After rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) analysis with human fetus Marathon-Ready cDNA (CLONTECH), full-length open reading frame cDNA of the GPCR (GPRv53) was isolated by a PCR reaction using a set of synthetic oligonucleotide primers, 5′-CTAGTCTAGAATGCCAGATACTAATAGCACAATCAATTTATC-3′ and 5 ′-CTAGTCTAGATTAAGAAGATACTGACCGACTGTGTTGT-3′. The reaction products were digested with XbaI and ligated into expression vectors pEF-BOS-dhfr (20Matsumoto S. Katoh M. Saito S. Watanabe T. Masuho Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1354: 159-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) and pCEP4ΔE, made from pCEP4 (Invitrogen) by deleting an expression unit of Epstein-Barr virus nuclear antigen EBNA-1. The algorithm proposed by Myers and Miller (21Myers E.W. Miller W. Comput. Appl. Biosci. 1988; 4: 11-17PubMed Google Scholar) was used to calculate the percentage of homology between two amino acid sequences. A reporter gene assay was performed to investigate changes in the intracellular levels of cAMP with the method described by Fitzgerald et al. (22Fitzgerald L.R. Mannan I.J. Dytko G.M. Wu H.L. Nambi P. Anal. Biochem. 1999; 275: 54-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Briefly, 7 × 104 cells of EBNA-1-expressing HEK293 (293-EBNA, Invitrogen) were harvested on collagen-coated 24-well plates for 24 h, and a GPRv53 expression plasmid and a cAMP-responsive element (CRE)-attached luciferase reporter gene plasmid (CRE-luc), pCRE-luc (Stratagene) were co-transfected using Fugene 6 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. The following day, the cells were treated with reagents (Sigma) in the presence of 1 μm forskolin for 5 h and lysed on ice. Intracellular luciferase activity in aliquots from each lysate was measured using a model LB953 luminometer (EG&G Berthold). 293-EBNA cells were seeded onto collagen I-coated 96-well black-wall, clear-bottom plates at 2 × 104 cells/well (Becton Dickinson). After overnight culture, equal amounts of GPRv53 and mouse Gα15 (GenBankTM accession number P30678) expression plasmids were co-transfected with Fugene 6 and incubated for 24 h. The cells were loaded with 4 μm Fluo-3 AM (Molecular Probes) in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum for 1 h and washed four times with assay buffer (Hanks' balanced salt solution, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4), and the change in intracellular Ca2+ was measured with a fluorimetric imaging plate reader (FLIPR, Molecular Devices). The maximum change in fluorescence was plotted against the ligand concentration to study the agonist response. The GPRv53 expression plasmid was transfected to 293-EBNA cells using Fugene 6, and after 3 days of culture, the cells were collected, and the membrane fraction was prepared as described by Lovenberg et al. (13Lovenberg T.W. Roland B.L. Wilson S.J. Jiang X. Pyati J. Huvar A. Jackson M.R. Erlander M.G. Mol. Pharmacol. 1999; 55: 1101-1107Crossref PubMed Scopus (709) Google Scholar). For performing binding assay, the membranes were applied into 96-well white microplates with a bound GF/B filter (Packard) and incubated with 10 nm [3H]histamine dihydrochloride (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and test reagents for 1 h at 25 °C followed by washing 8 times with ice-cold buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 5 mm MgCl2). [3H]Histamine activity in each well was counted using TopCounteHTS (Packard Instrument Co.), and data were analyzed using Prism (Graphpad Software Inc.). Using the full-length coding region of GPRv53 as a 32P-labeled probe, expression of GPRv53 in human tissues was analyzed with Multiple Tissue Northern (MTN™) blot membranes (CLONTECH). To sensitively compare the tissue distribution between GPRv53 and H3 receptor, PCR was carried out using multiple tissue cDNA panels (CLONTECH). A set of primers, 5′-GAATTGTCTGGCTGGATTAATTTGCTAATTTG-3′ and 5′-AAGAATGATGTGATGGCAAGGATGTACC-3′, was used to detect GPRv53 cDNA, and another set of primers, 5′-TCAGCTACGACCGCTTCCTGTCGGTCAC-3′ and 5′-TTGAGTGAGCGCGGCCTCTCAGTGCCCC-3′, was used to amplify H3 receptor in the presence of dimethyl sulfoxide (Sigma). The PCR profile used for GPRv53 consisted of 40× (94 °C for 30 s, 55 °C for 30 s, 72 °C for 30 s), and a shuttle-PCR profile, 5× (98 °C for 5 s, 72 °C for 1 min) followed by 5× (98 °C for 5 s, 70 °C for 1 min) and 30× (98 °C for 5 s, 68 °C for 1 min) was used for H3 receptor. To study the expression of GPRv53 in fractionated hematopoietic cells, human mononuclear cells, neutrophils, and eosinophils were isolated from the heparinized blood of healthy volunteers using the Ficoll-Paque (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) technique and CD16 microbeads (MACS reagents; Miltenyi Biotech). Total RNA was prepared using ISOGEN (Nippon Gene) and converted to cDNA with SuperScript II reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies, Inc.). Using the primary structures of known GPCRs as query sequences, a novel human genomic DNA sequence that possessed the characteristics of the GPCR super family was identified in the GenBankTM clones. Based on that sequence, rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) analysis was performed, and full-length cDNA of the novel GPCR, designated GPRv53, was isolated. GPRv53 was deduced to consist of 390 amino acids and shared several features conserved within GPCR members for amine ligands (23Leurs I. Hoffmann I. Wieland I. Timmerman I. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2000; 21: 11-12Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) such as 1) a Asp residue in TM1, 2) a DRY motif at TM2, 3) a disulfide bond between the first and third extracellular loops, 4) a Trp residue in TM4 and TM6, 5) a Pro residue in TM5 and TM6, 6) a NPXXY motif in TM7, and 7) a potential palmitoylation site in the C-terminal tail. Comparison of the amino acid sequence with known GPCRs revealed that GPRv53 showed the greatest homology with a recently cloned histamine H3 receptor (37.4%, Fig. 1), whereas it showed 23.0% with H1 and 21.6% with H2 receptors (TableI). Analysis of the GenBankTMgenomic DNA data base elucidated that GPRv53 gene is located in chromosome 18q11.2, and its coding region consists of three exons (1st exon, amino acid numbers 1–65; 2nd exon, amino acid numbers 65–119; and 3rd exon, amino acid numbers 120–390).Table IComparison of amino acid sequences of histamine receptorsH1H2H3GPRv5323.021.637.4H325.719.5H221.5Amino acid sequences of human H1, H2, and H3 receptors and GPRv53 were compared by the algorithm proposed by Myers and Miller (21Myers E.W.

Each sequence was cited from GenBank™/EMBL database as follows: H1 (D14436), H2 (AB023486), and H3 (AF140538). Open table in a new tab Amino acid sequences of human H1, H2, and H3 receptors and GPRv53 were compared by the algorithm proposed by Myers and Miller (21Myers E.W. Miller W. Comput. Appl.

Each sequence was cited from GenBank™/EMBL database as follows: H1 (D14436), H2 (AB023486), and H3 (AF140538). To determine whether GPRv53 is a novel histamine receptor, GPRv53 was transiently expressed in 293-EBNA cells and subjected to functional assays. The changes in intracellular cAMP were investigated using a CRE-luc reporter assay system, which had been demonstrated to work equally well with direct measurement of the intracellular cAMP concentration (22Fitzgerald L.R. Mannan I.J. Dytko G.M. Wu H.L. Nambi P. Anal. Biochem. 1999; 275: 54-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar,24Castanon M.J. Spevak W. Biochem.

Res. 1993; 13: 79-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2 a, histamine inhibited forskolin-stimulated CRE-luc activity in a concentration-dependent manner. Other biologic amines, including acetylcholine, dopamine, epinephrine, imidazole, serotonine, and tryptamine, had no effect on GPRv53-mediated CRE-luc activity (data not shown). The effect of histamine was completely abolished with pretreatment by pertussis toxin, suggesting that GPRv53 activated the Gi/o pathway. Direct measurement of the cAMP concentration also revealed that histamine inhibited the accumulation of cAMP in GPRv53-expressing cells (data not shown). Next, two known H3 receptor anagonists, thioperamide and clobenpropit, were investigated for their activity on GPRv53 in the reporter gene assay. Thioperamide blocked the histamine activity on GPRv53, whereas clobenpropit showed agonistic activity in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig.2 b). Histamine H1 or H2 receptor-selective ligands (pyrilamine, diphenhydramine, and cimetidine) were negative for activation or inhibition of GPRv53 in the reporter gene assay (data not shown). The mobilization of intracellular Ca2+ through GPRv53 activation was evaluated using FLIPR system. To carry out the assay, GPRv53 was transiently co-expressed in 293-EBNA cells with a “promiscuous” Gα15, which is able to couple non-selectively with a large variety of GPCRs and transduce intracellular signals through the phospholipase C pathway (28Offermanns S. Simon M.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15175-25180Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar). Histamine, clobenpropit,R-(α)-methylhistamine (RαMeH, H3 receptor agonist), and clozapine (neuroleptic) caused activation of GPRv53, exhibiting EC50 values of 9.95, 8.22, 172, and 1290 nm, respectively (Fig. 3). No response was observed by treatment with thioperamide. The value of Ca2+mobilization induced by clobenpropit was about 60% that of the value induced by the other agonists. The activity on GPRv53 with clobenpropit or thioperamide in the FLIPR study was in good agreement with the results obtained from the reporter gene assay. No signal was detected for 293-EBNA cells expressing GPRv53 or Gα15 alone (data not shown). [3H]Histamine was used to determine the binding affinity of histamine for GPRv53. The membrane fraction prepared from 293-EBNA cells expressing GPRv53 was specifically and saturably bound to radiolabeled histamine with a K dvalue of 17.2 nm (Fig.4 a). There was no specific binding observed for the membrane fraction from parental 293-EBNA cells (data not shown). The rank order of affinity on GPRv53 to compete with [3H]histamine was histamine, clobenpropit > thioperamide, RαMeH > clozapine, exhibiting IC50values of 2.48, 3.06, 231.6, 232.5, and 978 nm, respectively (Fig. 4 b). Northern blot analysis of human tissues revealed that expression of GPRv53 was detected only in peripheral blood leukocytes (Fig.5 a). In addition to peripheral blood leukocytes, PCR analysis for human tissue cDNA also detected GPRv53 expression in the thymus, small intestine, spleen, and colon (Fig. 5 b). In contrast, a specific signal for histamine H3 receptor was found only in the brain, which is in good agreement with the earlier observation of Lovenberg et al. (13Lovenberg T.W. Roland B.L. Wilson S.J. Jiang X. Pyati J. Huvar A. Jackson M.R. Erlander M.G. Mol. Pharmacol. 1999; 55: 1101-1107Crossref PubMed Scopus (709) Google Scholar). PCR analysis of fractionated blood cells indicated that GPRv53 was expressed more abundantly on eosinophils than on mononuclear cells or neutrophils (Fig. 5 c). This paper describes molecular cloning of a novel histamine receptor, GPRv53, that has 37.4% homology with histamine H3 receptor. In functional assays, a selective H3 receptor agonist, RαMeH, activated GPRv53 at severalfold weaker potency than histamine did, and an H3 receptor selective antagonist, thioperamide, inhibited GPRv53 activation with histamine. The most surprising observation obtained in this report is that an H3-selective antagonist, clobenpropit, and a neuroleptic, clozapine, exerted agonistic activity on GPRv53. The fact that clobenpropit induced about 60% of intrinsic GPRv53 activity compared with histamine indicates that it works as a partial agonist of GPRv53. As far as we know, this is the first finding that clobenpropit exerts agonistic activity on a certain receptor in addition to antagonistic activity on H3 receptor. With respect to the action of clozapine, our result is in good agreement with earlier reports demonstrating that clozapine shows affinity for histamine receptor (29Rodrigues A.A. Jansen F.P. Leurs R. Timmerman H. Prell G.D. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1995; 114: 1523-1524Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 30Kathmann M. Schlicker E. Gothert M. Psychopharmacology ( Berl. ). 1994; 116: 464-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Clinically, clozapine treatment involves the risk of causing serious agranulocytosis (31Krupp P. Barnes P. Br. J. Psychiatry. 1992; 17 (suppl.): 38-40Crossref Google Scholar, 32Alphs L.D. Anand R. J. Clin. Psychiatry. 1999; 60 Suppl. 12: 39-42PubMed Google Scholar). The relatively restricted expression of GPRv53 on peripheral blood leukocytes suggests that agonistic action of clozapine on GPRv53 may have some relevance to the pathogenesis of the drug-induced agranulocytosis, but this requires further investigation. Activation of GPRv53 allowed coupling with pertussis toxin-sensitive Gi/o. On the other hand, it is noteworthy that ligand-induced Ca2+ mobilization was observed when GPRv53 was co-expressed with Gα15, which is distributed mainly in the hematopoietic cells (33Amatruda III, T.T. Steele D.A. Slepak V.Z. Simon M.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 5587-5591Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar, 34Wilkie T.M. Scherle P.A. Strathmann M.P. Slepak V.Z. Simon M.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 10049-10053Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). The fact that GPRv53 expression can also be found preferentially in leukocytes suggests that GPRv53 induces activation of Gα15/16 as a natural second messenger pathway. Several studies suggest that receptor subtypes exist for the histamine H3 receptor. West et al. (14West Jr., R.E. Zweig A. Shih N.Y. Siegel M.I. Egan R.W. Clark M.A. Mol. Pharmacol. 1990; 38: 610-613PubMed Google Scholar) propose the existence of histamine H3a and H3b receptors, with different binding affinities for thioperamide, in the rat brain. Similar indications were obtained for mouse brain, guinea pig ileum, and guinea pig jejunum (15Leurs R. Kathmann M. Vollinga R.C. Menge W.M. Schlicker E. Timmerman H. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1996; 276: 1009-1015PubMed Google Scholar, 16Schlicker E. Kathmann M. Bitschnau H. Marr I. Reidemeister S. Stark H. Schunack W. Naunyn-Schmiedeberg's Arch. Pharmacol. 1996; 353: 482-488PubMed Google Scholar). Concomitant with the lack of peripheral tissue expression of a recently cloned H3 receptor (13Lovenberg T.W. Roland B.L. Wilson S.J. Jiang X. Pyati J. Huvar A. Jackson M.R. Erlander M.G. Mol. Pharmacol. 1999; 55: 1101-1107Crossref PubMed Scopus (709) Google Scholar), it is important to clarify the heterogeneity of H3 receptors at the molecular level in order to study the pathophysiological roles of histamine. GPRv53 differs from these proposed H3a or H3b based on the current results that 1) the potency of RαMeH for GPRv53 was much less than that of histamine for GPRv53, 2) expression of GPRv53 could hardly be detected in the brain, and 3) clobenpropit did not work as an antagonist but worked as an agonist of GPRv53. In addition, the original definition of H3 receptor, a presynaptic autoreceptor for histamine release in histaminergic neurons in the brain (9Arrang J.M. Garbarg M. Schwartz J.C. Nature. 1983; 302: 832-837Crossref PubMed Scopus (1482) Google Scholar), is hardly adoptable for the character of GPRv53. Hence, GPRv53 can be surmised to be a novel histamine H4 receptor. Actually, previous works propose the existence of a novel histamine receptor, which is different from H1, H2, or H3 receptor. Schworeret al. (17Schworer H. Reimann A. Ramadori G. Racke K. Naunyn-Schmiedeberg's Arch. Pharmacol. 1994; 350: 375-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) report that the porcine small intestine contains an H3-like receptor that is pharmacologically distinct from the proposed H3a and H3b (17Schworer H. Reimann A. Ramadori G. Racke K. Naunyn-Schmiedeberg's Arch. Pharmacol. 1994; 350: 375-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Their findings agree well with our result that H4 receptor (GPRv53) was expressed in the small intestine. Raibleet al. (18Raible D.G. Lenahan T. Fayvilevich Y. Kosinski R. Schulman E.S. Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med. 1994; 149: 1506-1511Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) also report that eosinophils express a novel type of histamine receptor that has the characteristics of binding to RαMeH at low affinity, being antagonized by thioperamide, and causing calcium mobilization via agonist binding. These observations are in good agreement with the profiles of the present H4 receptor, whose expression can be found in eosinophils.

https://openalex.org/W2085204257,"The senseless (sens) gene is required for proper development of most cell types of the embryonic and adult peripheral nervous system (PNS) of Drosophila. Sens is a nuclear protein with four Zn fingers that is expressed and required in the sensory organ precursors (SOP) for proper proneural gene expression. Ectopic expression of Sens in many ectodermal cells causes induction of PNS external sensory organ formation and is able to recreate an ectopic proneural field. Hence, sens is both necessary and sufficient for PNS development. Our data indicate that proneural genes activate sens expression. Sens is then in turn required to further activate and maintain proneural gene expression. This feedback mechanism is essential for selective enhancement and maintenance of proneural gene expression in the SOPs."
https://openalex.org/W2122791726,"Dendritic cells (DCs) developmentally regulate antigen uptake by controlling their endocytic capacity. Immature DCs actively internalize antigen. However, mature DCs are poorly endocytic, functioning instead to present antigens to T cells. We have found that endocytic downregulation reflects a decrease in endocytic activity controlled by Rho family GTPases, especially Cdc42. Blocking Cdc42 function by Toxin B treatment or injection of dominant-negative inhibitors of Cdc42 abrogates endocytosis in immature DCs. In mature DCs, injection of constitutively active Cdc42 or microbial delivery of a Cdc42 nucleotide exchange factor reactivates endocytosis. DCs regulate endogenous levels of Cdc42-GTP with activated Cdc42 detectable only in immature cells. We conclude that DCs developmentally regulate endocytosis at least in part by controlling levels of activated Cdc42."
https://openalex.org/W1995193554,"SREBPs exit the ER in a complex with SCAP. Together, they move to the Golgi where SREBP is cleaved, releasing a fragment that activates genes encoding lipid biosynthetic enzymes. Sterols block ER exit, preventing cleavage, decreasing transcription, and achieving feedback control of lipid synthesis. Here, we report an in vitro system to measure incorporation of SCAP into ER vesicles. When membranes were isolated from sterol-depleted cells, SCAP entered vesicles in a reaction requiring nucleoside triphosphates and cytosol. SCAP budding was diminished in membranes from sterol-treated cells. Kinetics of induction of budding in vitro matched kinetics of ER exit in living cells expressing GFP-SCAP. These data localize the sterol-regulated step to budding of SCAP from ER and provide a system for biochemical dissection."
https://openalex.org/W1985225337,"Polyubiquitination of proteins by Cdc34/SCF complexes targets them for degradation by the 26S proteasome. The essential F-box protein Met30 is the substrate recognition subunit of the ubiquitin ligase SCFMet30. The critical target of SCFMet30 is the transcription factor Met4, as deletion of MET4 suppresses the lethality of met30 mutants. Surprisingly, Met4 is a relatively stable protein and its abundance is not influenced by Met30. However, transcriptional repression of Met4 target genes correlates with Cdc34 /SCFMet30-dependent ubiquitination of Met4. Functionally, ubiquitinated Met4 associates with target promoters but fails to form functional transcription complexes. Our data reveal a novel proteolysis-independent function for Cdc34/SCF and indicate that ubiquitination of transcription factors can be utilized to directly regulate their activities."

We inactivated theCav 1.2 gene in two independent mouse lines that had indistinguishable phenotypes. Homozygous knockout embryos (Cav1.2−/−) died before day 14.5 postcoitum (p.c.). At day 12.5 p.c., the embryonic heart contracted with identical frequency in wild type (+/+), heterozygous (+/−), and homozygous (−/−) Cav1.2 embryos. Beating of isolated embryonic cardiomyocytes depended on extracellular calcium and was blocked by 1 μm nisoldipine.

The calcium entry via high voltage-activated (HVA)1 calcium channels leads to excitation-contraction coupling in the heart, tension development in smooth muscle, neurotransmitter release in brain, and endocrine secretion in gland tissues. In the cardiovascular system, voltage-activated calcium channels are essential for the generation of normal cardiac rhythm, for induction of rhythm propagation through the atrioventricular node, and for the contraction of the atrial and ventricular muscle (1Reuter H. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1984; 46: 473-484Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In diseased myocardium, calcium channels can contribute to abnormal impulse generation and cardiac arrhythmias (2Katz A.M. N. Engl. J. Med. 1993; 328: 1244-1251Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Calcium channels are hetero-oligomeric complexes of up to four subunits as follows: α1, β, α2δ, and γ subunit. The α1 subunit contains the voltage sensor, the selectivity filter, the ion-conducting pore, and the binding sites for all known calcium channel blockers. The other subunits are auxiliary subunits, which modulate the channel function. Calcium channels can be further modulated by a variety of hormones, protein kinases, and protein phosphatases (3Hofmann F. Lacinová L. Klugbauer N. Rev. Physiol. Biochem.

High voltage-activated calcium channels have been classified as L-type and non-L-type channels. L-type channels are encoded by four distinct genes, namely Cav 1.1 toCav 1.4 (6Ertel E.A. Campbell K.P.

Mammalian L-type channels have a similar ion selectivity and inactivation kinetics and are affected by dihydropyridines at similar concentrations. The expression pattern and the electrophysiology of L-type calcium channels have been studied extensively in pre- and postnatal heart cells of the mouse (7An R.H. Davies M.P. Doevendans P.A.

The major L-type channel expressed in the cardiac and smooth muscle is the Cav1.2 (11Mikami A. Imoto K. Tanabe T. Niidome T. Mori Y. Takeshima H. Narumiya S. Numa S.

To analyze the functional relevance of the L-type Cav1.2 calcium channel for various tissues, two mouse lines were generated in which the Cav 1.2 gene was disrupted at different exons. Both mouse lines had an identical phenotype. The homozygous (−/−) embryos died before day 14.5 p.c. Surprisingly, cardiomyocytes of 12.5-day-old p.c. embryos beat spontaneously using an unidentified L-type like calcium current. Murine calcium channelCav 1.2 genomic DNA was obtained from a 129SV-P1 library (Genome Systems, St. Louis, MO) by screening with two primers amplifying 204 bp of the second exon of theCav 1.2 gene. Two exons were identified in the P1 clone coding for the second and third exon of mouseCav 1.2 gene (16Ma W.J. Holz R.W. Uhler D. J. Biol.

The third exon encoding part of the domain I of Cav1.2 was used for the construction of the targeting vector since alternative splicing has not been described for this exon. The key features of the targeting vector are shown in Fig. 1 A. A neomycin resistance cassette (Neo) was placed into the MunI site of the third exon in the reverse direction of transcription. Additionally, a herpes simplex virus type I-thymidine kinase cassette (HSV-TK) was inserted 5′-terminal of the homologous region. Analysis of the genotype of the offsprings and proof for the correct insertion of the Neo were performed with primer pair NeoPA (5′-GCC TGC TCT TTA CTG AAG GCT CT-3′) and VS3 (5′-ACC ATT TGA AAT CAT TAT TTT ACT-3′) that amplify a 400-bp fragment of the mutated RNA and primer pair CSI (5′-ACG CCC AGC TCA TGC CAA CAT-3′) and mun3 (5′-TAA GGC CAC ACA ATT GGC AA-3′) that amplify a 354-bp fragment of the Cav1.2 exons 2 and 3 (Fig. 1 C).Figure 1Targeted disruption of the calcium channelCav 1.2 gene (mouse line A).

Restriction map analysis and sequencing of this P1 plasmid revealed that exons 13–16 encoding part of repeat II of Cav1.2 were present (16Ma W.J. Holz R.W. Uhler D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22728-22732Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Soldatov N.M. Genomics. 1994; 22: 77-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). The key features of the targeting vector are shown in Fig. 2 A. The vector contains a Neo and HSV-TK cassette and three 34-bp loxP sequences. Two of the loxP sites flank the Neo/HSV-TK cassette, which was inserted into the intron between exons 13 and 14. A third loxP site was placed into the intron between exons 15 and 16. To confirm the Cre-mediated deletion of the exons 14 and 15, RT-PCR was performed using the primer pair VS11 (5′-CTG GAA TTC CTT GAG CAA CCT TGT-3′) and VS16 (5′-AAT TTC CAC AGA TGA AGA GG- ATG-3′) to amplify exons 14 and 15 (329 bp) in (+/+), (+/−), and (−/−) cells and the primer pair VS9 (5-ACA CAG CCA ATA AAG CCC TCC TG-3′) and VS18 (5′-GGC CAG CTT CTT CCT CTC CTT-3′) to amplify the sequence between exons 13 and 16 in the (−/−) mouse (341 bp). Sixty μg of each targeting vector were linearized with NotI and electroporated into 1 × 107 R1 embryonic stem (ES) cells obtained from Samuel Lunenfeld Research Institute, Toronto, Canada. G418/ganciclovir- (mouse line A) and G418 (mouse line B)-resistant clones were screened by Southern blot analysis. Analysis of 311 G418-resistant clones revealed two clones (77 and 94 in mouse line B) that carried the floxed Neo/HSV-TK cassette and the third loxP site at the correct genomic region. 1 × 107 ES cells of clone 77 were electroporated with 6 μg of a Cre-expressing plasmid. Cells were plated at different dilutions and were selected with ganciclovir. Ganciclovir-resistant clones in which the Neo/HSV-TK cassette and exons 14 and 15 had been excised were identified by Southern analysis. ES cells carrying the disrupted allele (line A) or the Cav1.2 gene with the deleted exons 14 and 15 (line B) were microinjected into blastocysts from C57BL/6 mice to generate chimeric mice. Chimeric males were crossed with C57BL/6 females. Germ line transmission of the mutated Cav 1.2genes was verified by PCR analysis and Southern hybridization using tail DNA. The generation of the Cav1.3(−/−) mice has been described recently (18Platzer J. Engel E. Schrott-Fischer A. Stephan K. Bova S. Chen H. Zheng H. Striessnig J. Cell. 2000; 102: 89-97Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (694) Google Scholar). Total RNA was isolated from 12.5-day-old mouse embryos using TRIZOL LS Reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.). For the first strand synthesis, 4 μg of total RNA were used according to the manufacturer's instructions. Primer pairs for the detection of the other calcium channels were as follows: D4-1 (5′-CGT GGT GAA CTC CTC GCC T-3′) and D4-2 (5′-AAA AGG TGA TGG AGA TTC TAT T-3′) to amplify a 312-bp fragment of Cav1.3; ISHSK1 (5′-CGC GGA TCC ATC TAC TTT GTC ACC CTC ATT CT -3′) and ISHSK2 (5′-TAG GGT ACC ATG ATT TTG TTC AAG CCT TCG AT-3′) to amplify a 348-bp fragment of Cav1.1; and a1F1 (5′-TAG GGA TCC GGC CCC GTG ATG ATG AC-3′) and a1F2 (5′-CGC GGT ACC GTA CCA GGT CCC CAT CCA-3′) to amplify a 525-bp fragment of Cav1.4. Individual embryos were obtained after breeding of heterozygous Cav1.2 (+/−) mice at day 9.5 p.c. or later. Cardiac myocytes were isolated as described (8Davies M.P. An R.H. Doevendans P. Kubalak S. Chien K.R. Kass R.S. Circ. Res. 1996; 78: 15-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar) at day 12.5 p.c. or later. Myocytes were plated on plastic coverslips and cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (8Davies M.P. An R.H. Doevendans P. Kubalak S. Chien K.R. Kass R.S. Circ. Res. 1996; 78: 15-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and 5% penicillin/streptomycin (stock 10 mg/ml). Pharmacological tests were done in normal Tyrode's solution containing (in mm) 140 NaCl, 5.4 KCl, 1.8 CaCl2, 1 MgCl2, 10 glucose, 5 HEPES, pH 7.4. Genotyping of embryos was done by PCR. Whole-cell currents were recorded at room temperature 18–48 h after plating using fire-polished electrodes with resistances of 2–3.5 MΩ. Pipettes were filled with (in mm) 60 CsCl, 50 aspartic acid, 68 CsOH, 1 MgCl2, 5 K-ATP, 1 CaCl2, 10 HEPES, 11 EGTA, pH 7.4. Extracellular solution for sealing and recording of sodium current (INa) was (in mm) 130 NaCl, 4.8 KCl, 5 BaCl2, 1 MgCl2, 5 glucose, 5 HEPES, pH 7.4. To isolate barium currents (IBa), the bath solution was changed to (in mm) 130N-methyl-d-glucamine, 4.8 CsCl, 5 BaCl2, 5 glucose, 5 HEPES, pH 7.4. The holding potential (HP) was −80 mV. Trains of test pulses were to −40 mV forINa or to 0 mV for IBa of L-type calcium channel applied once every 10 s for 40 ms. Data were collected and stored at an EPC-9 computer under control of Pulse software (HEKA electronics). Total cell membrane capacitance was determined by compensation mechanisms of the EPC9 computer and used as a measurement of membrane area. (+/+), (+/−), and (−/−) cardiomyocytes had similar capacities of 30 ± 2.6 (n = 60), 26 ± 2.3 (n = 58), and 26 ± 2 (n = 53) pF, respectively. Inactivation curves were fitted by a Boltzmann relation as follows:I/Imax = (1 − A)/(1 + exp((V − V0.5)/k) + A, where I is the current,Imax is the maximal current at the beginning of the experiment, V is the potential,V0.5 is the midpoint of the curve, kis the slope factor, and A is the non-inactivating part. Ba2+/Ca2+ selectivity of the current was determined by a 100-ms pulse from −80 mV (HP) to 0 mV for (+/+) and (+/−) and to −10 mV for (−/−) cardiomyocytes at 0.2 Hz. Five mm Ba2+ was exchanged for 5 mmCa2+ in the bath solution. In some experiments the sequence was reversed. Cumulative dose-response curves were recorded using 2–3 different nisoldipine concentrations per cell. The number of experiments was 4–9 for each concentration. The stoichiometries and apparent affinities of nisoldipine were determined by fitting the averaged dose-inhibition points to the Hill equation: I/Imax = 1/(1 + ([nisoldipine]/IC50)H), where [nisoldipine] is the concentration of nisoldipine, IC50is the half-blocking concentration, and H is the Hill coefficient,I is the averaged current measured at any concentration of nisoldipine, and Imax is the average current measured in the absence of nisoldipine. To obtain apparent affinities for complex dose-inhibition relations, sums of Hill terms similar in form to that described above were fitted to the data. Stock solutions were as follows: Bay K 8644 10 mm in ethanol; nisoldipine 20 mm in ethanol; isoproterenol + ascorbic acid 10 mm each in H2O; tetrodotoxin citrate (TTX) 1 mm in H2O. When required, stock solutions were freshly diluted to the indicated concentrations with the used extracellular solution. Data are shown as mean ± S.E. with the number of cells in parentheses. Graphics and statistical data analysis using Student's t test were carried out using ORIGIN software (Microcal). Two different mouse lines were generated in which the Cav 1.2 calcium channel gene was disrupted. In mouse line A, a neomycin resistance cassette was inserted into the third exon of the Cav 1.2 gene (Fig. 1 A) in the opposite orientation. 5′ to the Neo cassette stop codons were inserted into each reading frame ofCav 1.2. The generation of functional channels is highly unlikely because the introduced modification leads to a truncated non-functional protein also in the case of an incorrect splicing, i.e. even if exon three is skipped, because of an early stop codon in exon four. Southern hybridization (Fig. 1 B) and RT-PCR (Fig. 1 C) with different primer pairs confirmed the germ line transmission of theCav 1.2 gene mutation in mouse line A. In mouse line B, exons 14 and 15 were deleted using the Cre/lox recombination system (Fig. 2 A). Deletion of exons 14 and 15 destroyed the transmembrane segment IIS5 and the pore in repeat II of the Cav1.2 channel. In addition, the Neo/HSV-TK cassette was removed to avoid nonspecific effects produced by the cassette and the products of the cassette. Southern hybridization (Fig. 2 B) and RT-PCR (Fig. 2 C) with different primer pairs confirmed the germ line transmission of theCav 1.2 gene mutation in mouse line B. Deletion of the exons 14 and 15 was verified by sequencing of the RT-PCR product obtained with primer pair VS9 and VS18 (Fig. 2 Cb). The primary transcript was spliced from exon 13 to an intron sequence directly upstream of exon 16 (Fig. 2 D). The new splicing event caused a frameshift resulting in an early stop codon. In agreement with these results, Western analysis with antibodies against the Cav1.2 and the Cav1.1 protein yielded no specific bands in (−/−) embryonic hearts. Identical results were obtained with both knockout lines. All experiments were at least repeated once in the other knockout line. Heterozygous Cav1.2 (+/−) mice were indistinguishable from wild type (+/+) mice in shape, development, and behavior. The mating of heterozygous mice led to viable (+/+) and (+/−) pups. The genotype and number of newborn mice was (+/+) 363 and (+/−) 546 for line A and (+/+) 33 and (+/−) 79 for line B. No viable knockout (−/−) mice were born. Examination of various gestation stages showed that viable embryos were present at day 12.5 p.c. at approximately Mendelian ratio ((+/+) 100, (+/−) 171, and (−/−) 91 in line A and (+/+) 12, (+/−) 35, and (−/−) 22 in line B). No viable (−/−) embryos were detected at day 14.5 p.c. Visual inspection suggested that Cav1.2 (+/+), (+/−), and (−/−) embryos developed normally up to day 12.5 p.c. Hearts contracted with the same frequency at day 12.5 p.c. (Fig. 3 A). After day 14.5 p.c., the beating frequency of the remaining (+/+) and (+/−) embryos increased. Cardiac cells from day 12.5 p.c. (+/+), (+/−), and (−/−) embryos could be cultured for more than a week. During this time, the frequency of spontaneous contractions increased in each genotype from about 30 to around 160 beats/min (Fig. 3 B) suggesting that the Cav 1.2gene is not necessary for rhythmic activity or is compensated during embryonic development but is required after day 13 p.c. A previous report (9Viatchenko-Karpinski S. Fleischmann B.K. Liu Q. Sauer H. Gryshchenko O. Ji G.J. Hescheler J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 8259-8264Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) indicated that the spontaneous contractions of cardiomyocytes from stage II embryoid bodies were caused by oscillations of intracellular [Ca2+] and did not require the influx of extracellular Ca2+ during each beat. To confirm these results, (+/−) and (−/−) heart cells were superfused with Ca2+-free normal Tyrode's solution. Within 6 s, all cardiomyocytes stopped contracting. Addition of 1.8 mmCa2+ restored beating in 2–5 s (n = 7 experiments for each genotype isolated from 3 different embryos). Repeated cycles of Ca2+ withdrawal and re-addition stopped and started contractions each time, respectively. Superfusion of (+/−) or (−/−) cardiomyocytes with the dihydropyridine (DHP) nisoldipine (1 μm) stopped beating in 0.5 min (n = 8). The inhibitory effect of nisoldipine was reversed by washout of the compound. These results suggested that the rhythmic activity of day 12.5 p.c. heart cells was not caused by intracellular [Ca2+] oscillations but depended on the influx of extracellular Ca2+ through a channel with the characteristics of an L-type calcium channel. The nature of this putative channel was analyzed by the patch clamp technique using isolated cardiomyocytes. Barium inward currents (IBa) were observed in atrial and ventricular primary cultures of day 12.5 p.c. (+/+), (+/−), and (−/−) cardiomyocytes. Voltage-dependentINa was present in 97% of the cells withIBa. Surprisingly, 98.5% (+/+), 95% (+/−), and 81% (−/−) cardiomyocytes showed calcium channel activity with typical L-type kinetics (Fig. 4). The L-type current of wild type cardiomyocytes activated at −40 mV and reached its maximum between 0 and +10 mV. Due to large outward directed currents, the reversal potential could not be determined reliably. In (+/−) and (−/−) cardiomyocytes, IBa activated and peaked at slightly more negative potentials of −50 and −10 mV, respectively. In (+/+), (+/−), and (−/−) cells,IBa activated rapidly and inactivated slowly. Steady-state inactivation curves were obtained with 1-s prepulses to potentials between −60 and +30 mV. The V0.5values were −19 ± 3.6 mV (n = 8) in (+/+), −24 ± 3.1 mV (n = 8) in (+/−), and −30 ± 8.2 mV (n = 5) in (−/−) cardiomyocytes. The voltage dependence was steeper in (+/+) cells with k = 6.3 ± 0.5 compared with k = 9.4 ± 1.2 and 10.0 ± 4.0 in (+/−) and (−/−) cells. The non-inactivating part was 28 ± 5% in (+/+), 26 ± 5% in (+/−), and 36 ± 7% in (−/−) cells. Although the values were not significantly different from each other, they were in line with the observation that I-V relations of (+/−) and (−/−) cardiomyocytes were shifted slightly to hyperpolarized membrane potentials when compared with that of (+/+) cardiomyocytes (see also Fig. 4). The ion selectivity of the channel of (+/+), (+/−), and (−/−) cardiomyocytes was identical (Fig. 4,D and E). Maximal inward currents with Ca2+ as charge carrier were reduced in each genotype, and current inactivation was increased to 90% in the presence of Ca2+ (Fig. 4, D and E) suggesting Ca2+-dependent inactivation of the channel in each genotype. Superfusion of individual cells with the calcium channel agonist Bay K 8644 (1 μm) increased IBa and induced a shift of the I-V relation to hyperpolarized potentials in all three genotypes. The calcium channel blocker nisoldipine (1 μm) inhibited IBa in each cell line but with less efficiency in (−/−) cardiomyocytes (Fig. 4). The same results were obtained in mouse line A and B (Fig. 4, Aand B). However, the current amplitude differed significantly between the three genotypes (Fig. 4 C).IBa increased slightly in the (+/−) cells after day 14.5 p.c. and was equal to IBa of (+/+) cells. The difference in current densities was not due to distinct cell sizes or differences in INa. TheINa amplitudes were similar with 251 ± 19 (n = 57) for (+/+), 219 ± 18 (n = 54) for (+/−), and 208 ± 16 (n = 61) pA/pF for (−/−) cells. This analysis suggested that embryonic cardiac cells from two independent Cav1.2 knockout mouse lines expressed a bona fide L-type calcium channel. An alternative explanation for this phenotype was that the observed L-type channel was the so-called slip-mode sodium conductance channel (19Santana L.F. Gómez A.M. Lederer W.J. Science. 1998; 279: 1027-1033Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). This channel is blocked by TTX with an IC50 of 0.1 μm and allows permeation of calcium in the presence of cAMP kinase or after activation of the β-adrenergic receptor. In support,IBa was stimulated in each cell line 1.8–2.0-fold (n = 8 to 20 cells) by isoproterenol. A similar adrenergic stimulation of IBa has been reported for day 9.5 p.c. mouse embryonic heart cells (10Liu W. Yasui K. Arai A. Kamiya K. Cheng J. Kodma I. Toyama J. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: H608-H613PubMed Google Scholar). However, IBa was not affected at all by 10 μm TTX, whereas INa was blocked reversibly in each cell line (not shown). Therefore, it was concluded that the slip-mode channel did not cause the observed DHP-sensitiveIBa in Cav1.2(−/−) cardiac cells. The experiments shown in Fig. 4 indicated that IBa of the Cav1.2(−/−) cells was less sensitive to nisoldipine than that of the cells with a wild type or heterozygous genotype. Therefore, the extent of channel block was tested by superfusion of the (+/+), (+/−), or (−/−) cells with 1 μm nisoldipine at the HP of −80 mV with trains of test pulses (Fig. 5 A). Nisoldipine reducedIBa of (+/+) and (+/−) cardiomyocytes to 23 ± 3.7% (n = 10) and 27 ± 3.3% (n = 8), respectively. In contrast,IBa of (−/−) cells was reduced only to 65 ± 3.3% (n = 11) of the control. A shift of the HP from −80 to −40 mV reduced IBa to zero in all three genotypes. IBa recovered to 80% of the previous value in each cell line after reversal of the HP from −40 to −80 mV. The voltage-dependent reversibility of the block indicated that nisoldipine bound preferentially to the inactivated state of the channel, a phenomenon described extensively for the Cav1.2 channel (see Refs. 3Hofmann F. Lacinová L. Klugbauer N. Rev. Physiol. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1999; 139: 33-87Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 5Hockerman G.H. Peterson B.Z. Johnson B.D. Catterall W.A. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol.

The affinity of nisoldipine to blockIBa at a HP of −80 mV was determined from dose-inhibition curves (Fig. 5 B) that were fitted to the Hill equation. The calculations yielded a low (≈0.1 μm) and a high (≈3 μm) IC50 value for (+/+) and (+/−) cells and only a high (1.1 μm) IC50value for (−/−) cells (Table I). The inhibition curves were well fitted with a Hill coefficient of 1.0 suggesting that nisoldipine blocked two independent currents in the (+/+) and (+/−) cells. Considering the relative variability introduced by the calculation method, we suggest that the high IC50values were not different between the three genotypes and that the real high IC50 value is close to 1 μm.Table ISummary on relative fraction of current and IC50 values for nisoldipineGenotypeIC50 (fraction)Cav1.2 cardiac myocytes 12.5 p.c.

This low affinity is apparently a developmental property of the mouse heart, since day 15.5 p.c. wild type myocytes were blocked by nisoldipine with IC50 values of 10 nm and 5.7 μm (Fig. 5 B and Table I). The high (10 nm) and intermediate (100 nm) DHP sensitivity was most likely caused by the expression of different splice variants of the Cav 1.2 gene (21Morel N. Buryi V. Feron O. Gomez J.P.

We investigated the role of vasopressin-induced intracellular Ca2+ mobilization in this process. In isolated inner medullary collecting ducts (IMCDs), vasopressin (0.1 nm) and 8-(4-chlorophenylthio)-cAMP (0.1 mm) elicited marked increases in [Ca2+]i (fluo-4). Vasopressin-induced Ca2+ mobilization was completely blocked by preloading with the Ca2+ chelator BAPTA. In parallel experiments, BAPTA completely blocked the vasopressin-induced increase in P f without affecting adenosine 3′,5′-cyclic monophosphate (cAMP) production. Previously, we demonstrated the lack of activation of the phosphoinositide-signaling pathway by vasopressin in IMCD, suggesting an inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate-independent mechanism of Ca2+ release. Evidence for expression of the type 1 ryanodine receptor (RyR1) in IMCD was obtained by immunofluorescence, immunoblotting, and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. Ryanodine (100 μm), a ryanodine receptor antagonist, blocked the arginine vasopressin-mediated increase in P f and blocked vasopressin-stimulated redistribution of aquaporin-2 to the plasma membrane domain in primary cultures of IMCD cells, as assessed by immunofluorescence immunocytochemistry. Calmodulin inhibitors (W7 and trifluoperazine) blocked the P f response to vasopressin and the vasopressin-stimulated redistribution of aquaporin-2.

RyR, ryanodine receptor Arginine vasopressin (AVP)1 regulates water transport across the epithelium of the renal collecting duct, allowing precise control of water excretion. Water transport across the collecting duct is mediated by molecular water channels, the aquaporins (1Agre P. Bonhivers M. Borgnia M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14659-14662Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar, 2Knepper M.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: F3-F12PubMed Google Scholar). Aquaporin-2 provides the water transport pathway across the apical plasma membrane of the collecting duct principal cells, whereas aquaporins-3 and -4 facilitate water transport across the basolateral plasma membrane. AVP increases the osmotic water permeability (P f) of the collecting duct cells by triggering translocation of intracellular vesicles containing aquaporin-2 to the apical plasma membrane (3Nielsen S. Chou C.-L. Marples D. Christensen E.I. Kishore B.K. Knepper M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1013-1017Crossref PubMed Scopus (877) Google Scholar), thus increasing the number of water channels in the rate-limiting barrier for transepithelial water transport. This response depends on the binding of AVP to V2 vasopressin receptors in the basolateral plasma membrane. These receptors couple to the heterotrimeric G protein, Gs, which activates the effector enzyme adenylyl cyclase type VI (4Chabardes D. Firsov D. Aarab L. Clabecq A. Bellanger A.C. Siaume-Perez S. Elalouf J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19264-19271Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) and increases cyclic AMP levels in the cells. Vasopressin, acting via the V2 receptor, also causes a transient increase in intracellular Ca2+ (5Star R.A. Nonoguchi H. Balaban R. Knepper M.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1988; 81: 1879-1888Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar, 6Maeda Y. Han J.S. Gibson C.C. Knepper M.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 265: F15-F25Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7Champigneulle A.

Physiol. 1996; 270: F623-F633PubMed Google Scholar). Little is known about the mechanism of the vasopressin-induced increase in intracellular Ca2+, although previous studies establish that it occurs in the absence of activation of the phosphoinositide signaling pathway (9Chou C.-L. Rapko S.I. Knepper M.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: F564-F572Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Little is known also about the physiological role of the vasopressin-induced increase in intracellular Ca2+ in the regulation of aquaporin-2 trafficking. However, studies of a wide variety of vesicular-trafficking processes have pointed to a key role for localized increases in intracellular Ca2+ in triggering the fusion of vesicles with their target membranes (10Burgoyne R.D. Morgan A. Cell Calcium. 1998; 24: 367-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), raising the possibility that the same could be true for aquaporin-2 vesicle trafficking. One calcium-dependent mediator that has been suggested to play a role in water permeability regulation in the vasopressin-responsive toad bladder epithelium is calmodulin (11Levine S.D. Kachadorian W.A. Levin D.N. Schlondorff D. J. Clin. Invest. 1981; 67: 662-672Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Based on recent studies of homotypic fusion of yeast vacuoles, Peters and Mayer conclude that a critical final step in the process of vesicle fusion is dependent on calmodulin (12Peters C. Mayer A. Nature. 1998; 396: 575-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar), and calmodulin actions can be postulated at other steps involved in vasopressin signaling or aquaporin-2 trafficking. In the present study, we investigate the role of intracellular Ca2+ and calmodulin in the AVP-mediated regulation of aquaporin-2 trafficking, assessed through the measurement of osmotic water permeability (P f) in isolated perfused inner medullary collecting duct (IMCD) segments and through immunofluorescence localization of aquaporin-2 in cultured IMCD cells. The results support the view that stimulation of aquaporin-2 vesicle trafficking to the plasma membrane by AVP requires the AVP-induced rise in intracellular Ca2+and is dependent on calmodulin. In addition, they show that the rise in intracellular Ca2+ can be induced by an exogenous cyclic AMP analog. Furthermore, the results demonstrate that AVP-stimulated aquaporin-2 trafficking is dependent on ryanodine-sensitive Ca2+ stores and that the type 1 ryanodine receptor (RyR1) is expressed in IMCD cells in a distribution similar to that of aquaporin-2.DISCUSSIONIn the renal collecting duct, vasopressin increases water permeability by increasing the number of aquaporin-2 water channels in the apical plasma membrane via regulated exocytosis of aquaporin-2 vesicles (3Nielsen S. Chou C.-L. Marples D. Christensen E.I. Kishore B.K. Knepper M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1013-1017Crossref PubMed Scopus (877) Google Scholar). This process depends on a rise in intracellular cyclic AMP, although the mechanism by which cyclic AMP triggers exocytosis is not well understood. It has long been recognized that AVP, acting through the V2 receptor, increases [Ca2+]i in the IMCD (5Star R.A. Nonoguchi H. Balaban R. Knepper M.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1988; 81: 1879-1888Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar, 6Maeda Y. Han J.S. Gibson C.C. Knepper M.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 265: F15-F25Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7Champigneulle A.

Physiol. 1996; 270: F623-F633PubMed Google Scholar). However, the role of this AVP-induced Ca2+ increase in aquaporin-2 trafficking has not been investigated until now. In the present study, we provide evidence that the AVP-induced Ca2+ increase is necessary for the water permeability response. Furthermore, we have demonstrated that vasopressin-induced trafficking of aquaporin-2 to the cell surface is dependent on calmodulin, suggesting that the role of calcium could be through calmodulin activation. The results also implicate ryanodine-sensitive calcium stores in aquaporin-2 trafficking and demonstrate the presence of type 1 ryanodine receptors in inner medullary collecting duct cells. The fact that the AVP-induced Ca2+ increase is mimicked by a cyclic AMP analogue suggests that the calcium release may be triggered by cyclic AMP, possibly acting through protein kinase A. In the remainder of this discussion we analyze these conclusions from the perspective of the foregoing literature.A role for intracellular calcium mobilization in regulated exocytosis has been previously established in a variety of tissues. For example, increases in intracellular Ca2+ are known to play a critical role in triggering exocytosis in neurotransmitter release from the presynaptic region of axons (25Bajjalieh S.M. Scheller R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1971-1974Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar), in catecholamine release from adrenal chromaffin cells (26Burgoyne R.D. Morgan A. Trends Neurosci. 1995; 18: 191-196Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar), and in insulin release from pancreatic β cells (27Bokvist K. Eliasson L. Ammala C. Renstrom E. Rorsman P. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 50-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). Vasopressin-stimulated exocytosis of aquaporin-2-containing vesicles in collecting duct cells is generally recognized to be dependent on increases in intracellular cyclic AMP (2Knepper M.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: F3-F12PubMed Google Scholar), and recent studies indicate that the trafficking is dependent on protein kinase A-mediated phosphorylation of the aquaporin-2 channel itself (28Katsura T. Gustafson C.E. Ausiello D.A. Brown D. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: F817-F822Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, the present findings point to a critical role for calcium as an intracellular mediator of the vasopressin-induced water permeability response. Specifically, we showed that buffering of intracellular calcium levels with BAPTA or the addition of calmodulin inhibitors can completely block the water permeability response to vasopressin. Thus, we conclude that vasopressin-mediated trafficking of aquaporin-2 is dependent both on increases in intracellular cyclic AMP and increases in intracellular calcium. It should be emphasized that the observed rise in intracellular Ca2+ occurred in response to a physiological level of vasopressin, 0.1 nm, a level that elicits a half-maximal increase in cyclic AMP production in the IMCD (20Chou C.-L. DiGiovanni S.R. Luther A. Lolait S.J. Knepper M.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 268: F78-F85Google Scholar).The finding in the present study that calmodulin inhibitors block the water permeability response to vasopressin in the IMCD was predated by similar findings in the toad bladder, a vasopressin-responsive collecting duct analogue (11Levine S.D. Kachadorian W.A. Levin D.N. Schlondorff D. J. Clin. Invest. 1981; 67: 662-672Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), and in rabbit cortical collecting duct (29Dillingham M.A. Dixon B.S. Kim J.K. Wilson P.D. J. Physiol. 1986; 372: 41-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). The availability of antibodies to aquaporin-2 have now allowed us to demonstrate in primary cultures of IMCD cells that the blockade of the water permeability response is associated with a failure of aquaporin-2 to redistribute to the cell periphery in response to vasopressin. Calmodulin is a ubiquitous 17-kDa protein that is involved in a host of regulatory processes including activation of calmodulin-dependent protein kinases, activation of myosin light chain kinase, regulation of type 1 cyclic nucleotide phosphatase, regulation of calcineurin and other protein phosphatases, and stimulation of types I, III, and VIII adenylyl cyclase (30Zhang M. Yuan T. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1998; 76: 313-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Because calmodulin has so many regulatory targets, it would be fruitless to speculate extensively at this point regarding the specific role it plays in aquaporin-2 trafficking. However, some clues arise from the immunofluorescence localization of aquaporin-2 after treatment with calmodulin inhibitors. Aquaporin-2 was redistributed to a perinuclear location (Fig. 4 C). In a previous study in aquaporin-2-transfected LLC-PK1 cells, a similar perinuclear localization of aquaporin-2 was seen in response to reduced temperature or treatment with the vacuolar protein pump inhibitor bafilomycin (31Gustafson C.E. Katsura T. McKee M. Bouley R. Casanova J.E. Brown D. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 278: F317-F326Google Scholar). The authors concluded that aquaporin-2 recycles continuously between the trans-Golgi network and the plasma membrane and that the effect of vasopressin is to alter the steady-state rates of exocytic and endocytic translocation between these compartments in favor of increased aquaporin-2 in the plasma membrane. The effect of low temperature, bafilomycin, and putatively calmodulin inhibitors would be to decrease markedly the exocytic translocation from the trans-Golgi network to the plasma membrane or (less likely) to markedly accelerate the endocytic rate. Assuming the former, it would appear that the block is not at a late step in this translocation process, e.g. at the level of docking and fusion of the aquaporin-2 vesicles with the plasma membrane, which would be expected to arrest the aquaporin-2 vesicles in the vicinity of the plasma membrane. Rather, the blockade is likely to involve an early step such as vesicle budding from the trans-Golgi or cytoskeleton-dependent translocation of aquaporin-2-bearing vesicles toward the plasma membrane. Previous studies have demonstrated a role for microtubules in the vasopressin-induced water permeability increase (32Brown D. Katsura T. Gustafson C.E. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: F328-F331PubMed Google Scholar).A previous study from our laboratory demonstrated that, although the muscarinic agonist carbachol markedly stimulated inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate production in the inner medullary collecting duct, vasopressin did not have such an effect (9Chou C.-L. Rapko S.I. Knepper M.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: F564-F572Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These findings suggested that vasopressin (at physiological concentrations) does not activate the phosphoinositide-signaling pathway in the IMCD. This result led us to conclude that it is unlikely that vasopressin-induced Ca2+ mobilization in the IMCD is mediated by inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptors. The results of the present study point instead to a likely role for ryanodine receptors. RT-PCR studies demonstrated the presence of mRNA for both type 1 and type 2 ryanodine receptors in the renal inner medulla. However, antibody localization studies suggested that type 1 ryanodine receptor, characteristic of skeletal muscle, is expressed in IMCD cells. Measurements using the intracellular Ca2+ indicator fluo-4 demonstrated that caffeine, a ryanodine receptor agonist, induced a rapid increase in intracellular calcium. A physiological role for the collecting duct ryanodine receptor was suggested both by water permeability measurements and aquaporin-2 immunofluorescence in cultured IMCD cells. These studies support the view that ryanodine blocks the ability of vasopressin to stimulate aquaporin-2 trafficking to the plasma membrane.A direct physiological agonist for RyR-mediated Ca2+release has not been identified in the present studies. In cardiac and skeletal muscle cells, the ryanodine receptors mediate Ca2+-induced Ca2+ release in which Ca2+ ions activate the Ca2+ conductance (33Cheng H. Lederer M.R. Xiao R.P. Gomez A.M. Zhou Y.Y. Ziman B. Spurgeon H. Lakatta E.G. Lederer W.J. Cell Calcium. 1996; 20: 129-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Other regulators act to alter the sensitivity of ryanodine receptors to calcium. Such mediators include cyclic adenosine 5′-diphosphate ribose (cADP-ribose) and nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NAADP+), a metabolite of NADP (34Lee H.C. Physiol. Rev. 1997; 77: 1133-1164Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). However, a direct effect of AVP on intracellular cADP-ribose or NAADP+ level has not been documented in these cells. Another possibility is that cyclic AMP itself could regulate the sensitivity of RyR1 in IMCD cells to calcium, possibly via the action of protein kinase A. This possibility has support from several previous studies. For example, cAMP, which functions as an intracellular messenger stimulating salivary amylase secretion in rat parotid gland acinar cells, was reported to induce a ryanodine-sensitive Ca2+ release that could be inhibited by a protein kinase A inhibitor (35Ozawa T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 246: 422-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Similarly in glucose-stimulated pancreatic β cells, the effect of caffeine on calcium release via ryanodine receptors was enhanced by forskolin, an activator of adenylyl cyclase (36Islam M.S. Leibiger I. Leibiger B. Rossi D. Sorrentino V. Ekstrom T.J. Westerblad H. Andrade F.H. Berggren P.-O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6145-6150Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Also in pancreatic β cells, glucagon-like peptide-1 was found to induce a protein kinase A-dependent sensitization of ryanodine receptors (37Holz G.G. Leech C.A. Heller R.S. Castonguay M. Habener J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14147-14156Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Sensitization of ryanodine receptors by cyclic AMP has also been reported in HEK293 cells (38Gromada J. Rorsman P. Dissing S. Wulff B.S. FEBS Lett. 1995; 373: 182-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar).Ryanodine receptors are intracellular Ca2+ release channel proteins, which exist as tetrameric complexes of large polypeptide monomers (approximately 5000 amino acid residues) (39Jaggar J.H. Porter V.A. Lederer W.J. Nelson M.T. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 278: C235-C256Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To date, three different ryanodine receptor isoforms have been identified, mainly in the excitable cells. Type 1 is expressed predominantly in skeletal muscle cells, type 2 is expressed predominantly in cardiac muscle cells, and type 3 is expressed predominantly in brain. In rabbit kidney cortex and in the rabbit kidney epithelial cell line LLC-RK1, Tunwell and Lai (4Chabardes D. Firsov D. Aarab L. Clabecq A. Bellanger A.C. Siaume-Perez S. Elalouf J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19264-19271Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) detected both mRNA and protein of type 2, but not type 1, ryanodine receptors. In human embryonic kidney cells (HEK293 cells), Querfurth et al. (41Querfurth H.W. Haughey N.J. Greenway S.C. Yacono P.W. Golan D.E. Geiger J.D. Biochem. J. 1998; 334: 79-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) demonstrate the expression of both type 1 and type 2, but not type 3 ryanodine receptor mRNA. However, there were no data prior to this study regarding the expression of ryanodine receptors in rat kidney or in individual renal tubule segments. Our RT-PCR experiments have demonstrated the presence of mRNA for both RyR1 (the skeletal muscle isoform) and RyR2 (the cardiac muscle isoform) in the renal inner medulla. The use of monoclonal antibodies to these two receptors in immunoblotting experiments indicates the presence of RyR1 but not RyR2 in inner medullary collecting duct cells (Fig. 7). Immunocytochemistry using double-labeling with the RyR1 antibody and an antibody to aquaporin-2 indicates that RyR1 is distributed in the IMCD cell cytoplasm predominantly in the apical region of the cells. Arginine vasopressin (AVP)1 regulates water transport across the epithelium of the renal collecting duct, allowing precise control of water excretion. Water transport across the collecting duct is mediated by molecular water channels, the aquaporins (1Agre P. Bonhivers M. Borgnia M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14659-14662Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar, 2Knepper M.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: F3-F12PubMed Google Scholar). Aquaporin-2 provides the water transport pathway across the apical plasma membrane of the collecting duct principal cells, whereas aquaporins-3 and -4 facilitate water transport across the basolateral plasma membrane. AVP increases the osmotic water permeability (P f) of the collecting duct cells by triggering translocation of intracellular vesicles containing aquaporin-2 to the apical plasma membrane (3Nielsen S. Chou C.-L. Marples D. Christensen E.I. Kishore B.K. Knepper M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1013-1017Crossref PubMed Scopus (877) Google Scholar), thus increasing the number of water channels in the rate-limiting barrier for transepithelial water transport. This response depends on the binding of AVP to V2 vasopressin receptors in the basolateral plasma membrane. These receptors couple to the heterotrimeric G protein, Gs, which activates the effector enzyme adenylyl cyclase type VI (4Chabardes D. Firsov D. Aarab L. Clabecq A. Bellanger A.C. Siaume-Perez S. Elalouf J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19264-19271Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) and increases cyclic AMP levels in the cells. Vasopressin, acting via the V2 receptor, also causes a transient increase in intracellular Ca2+ (5Star R.A. Nonoguchi H. Balaban R. Knepper M.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1988; 81: 1879-1888Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar, 6Maeda Y. Han J.S. Gibson C.C. Knepper M.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 265: F15-F25Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7Champigneulle A.

Physiol. 1996; 270: F623-F633PubMed Google Scholar). Little is known about the mechanism of the vasopressin-induced increase in intracellular Ca2+, although previous studies establish that it occurs in the absence of activation of the phosphoinositide signaling pathway (9Chou C.-L. Rapko S.I. Knepper M.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: F564-F572Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Little is known also about the physiological role of the vasopressin-induced increase in intracellular Ca2+ in the regulation of aquaporin-2 trafficking. However, studies of a wide variety of vesicular-trafficking processes have pointed to a key role for localized increases in intracellular Ca2+ in triggering the fusion of vesicles with their target membranes (10Burgoyne R.D. Morgan A. Cell Calcium. 1998; 24: 367-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), raising the possibility that the same could be true for aquaporin-2 vesicle trafficking. One calcium-dependent mediator that has been suggested to play a role in water permeability regulation in the vasopressin-responsive toad bladder epithelium is calmodulin (11Levine S.D. Kachadorian W.A. Levin D.N. Schlondorff D. J. Clin. Invest. 1981; 67: 662-672Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Based on recent studies of homotypic fusion of yeast vacuoles, Peters and Mayer conclude that a critical final step in the process of vesicle fusion is dependent on calmodulin (12Peters C. Mayer A. Nature. 1998; 396: 575-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar), and calmodulin actions can be postulated at other steps involved in vasopressin signaling or aquaporin-2 trafficking. In the present study, we investigate the role of intracellular Ca2+ and calmodulin in the AVP-mediated regulation of aquaporin-2 trafficking, assessed through the measurement of osmotic water permeability (P f) in isolated perfused inner medullary collecting duct (IMCD) segments and through immunofluorescence localization of aquaporin-2 in cultured IMCD cells. The results support the view that stimulation of aquaporin-2 vesicle trafficking to the plasma membrane by AVP requires the AVP-induced rise in intracellular Ca2+and is dependent on calmodulin. In addition, they show that the rise in intracellular Ca2+ can be induced by an exogenous cyclic AMP analog. Furthermore, the results demonstrate that AVP-stimulated aquaporin-2 trafficking is dependent on ryanodine-sensitive Ca2+ stores and that the type 1 ryanodine receptor (RyR1) is expressed in IMCD cells in a distribution similar to that of aquaporin-2. DISCUSSIONIn the renal collecting duct, vasopressin increases water permeability by increasing the number of aquaporin-2 water channels in the apical plasma membrane via regulated exocytosis of aquaporin-2 vesicles (3Nielsen S. Chou C.-L. Marples D. Christensen E.I. Kishore B.K. Knepper M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1013-1017Crossref PubMed Scopus (877) Google Scholar). This process depends on a rise in intracellular cyclic AMP, although the mechanism by which cyclic AMP triggers exocytosis is not well understood. It has long been recognized that AVP, acting through the V2 receptor, increases [Ca2+]i in the IMCD (5Star R.A. Nonoguchi H. Balaban R. Knepper M.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1988; 81: 1879-1888Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar, 6Maeda Y. Han J.S. Gibson C.C. Knepper M.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 265: F15-F25Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7Champigneulle A.

Physiol. 1996; 270: F623-F633PubMed Google Scholar). However, the role of this AVP-induced Ca2+ increase in aquaporin-2 trafficking has not been investigated until now. In the present study, we provide evidence that the AVP-induced Ca2+ increase is necessary for the water permeability response. Furthermore, we have demonstrated that vasopressin-induced trafficking of aquaporin-2 to the cell surface is dependent on calmodulin, suggesting that the role of calcium could be through calmodulin activation. The results also implicate ryanodine-sensitive calcium stores in aquaporin-2 trafficking and demonstrate the presence of type 1 ryanodine receptors in inner medullary collecting duct cells. The fact that the AVP-induced Ca2+ increase is mimicked by a cyclic AMP analogue suggests that the calcium release may be triggered by cyclic AMP, possibly acting through protein kinase A. In the remainder of this discussion we analyze these conclusions from the perspective of the foregoing literature.A role for intracellular calcium mobilization in regulated exocytosis has been previously established in a variety of tissues. For example, increases in intracellular Ca2+ are known to play a critical role in triggering exocytosis in neurotransmitter release from the presynaptic region of axons (25Bajjalieh S.M. Scheller R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1971-1974Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar), in catecholamine release from adrenal chromaffin cells (26Burgoyne R.D. Morgan A. Trends Neurosci. 1995; 18: 191-196Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar), and in insulin release from pancreatic β cells (27Bokvist K. Eliasson L. Ammala C. Renstrom E. Rorsman P. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 50-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). Vasopressin-stimulated exocytosis of aquaporin-2-containing vesicles in collecting duct cells is generally recognized to be dependent on increases in intracellular cyclic AMP (2Knepper M.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: F3-F12PubMed Google Scholar), and recent studies indicate that the trafficking is dependent on protein kinase A-mediated phosphorylation of the aquaporin-2 channel itself (28Katsura T. Gustafson C.E. Ausiello D.A. Brown D. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: F817-F822Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, the present findings point to a critical role for calcium as an intracellular mediator of the vasopressin-induced water permeability response. Specifically, we showed that buffering of intracellular calcium levels with BAPTA or the addition of calmodulin inhibitors can completely block the water permeability response to vasopressin. Thus, we conclude that vasopressin-mediated trafficking of aquaporin-2 is dependent both on increases in intracellular cyclic AMP and increases in intracellular calcium. It should be emphasized that the observed rise in intracellular Ca2+ occurred in response to a physiological level of vasopressin, 0.1 nm, a level that elicits a half-maximal increase in cyclic AMP production in the IMCD (20Chou C.-L. DiGiovanni S.R. Luther A. Lolait S.J. Knepper M.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 268: F78-F85Google Scholar).The finding in the present study that calmodulin inhibitors block the water permeability response to vasopressin in the IMCD was predated by similar findings in the toad bladder, a vasopressin-responsive collecting duct analogue (11Levine S.D. Kachadorian W.A. Levin D.N. Schlondorff D. J. Clin. Invest. 1981; 67: 662-672Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), and in rabbit cortical collecting duct (29Dillingham M.A. Dixon B.S. Kim J.K. Wilson P.D. J. Physiol. 1986; 372: 41-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). The availability of antibodies to aquaporin-2 have now allowed us to demonstrate in primary cultures of IMCD cells that the blockade of the water permeability response is associated with a failure of aquaporin-2 to redistribute to the cell periphery in response to vasopressin. Calmodulin is a ubiquitous 17-kDa protein that is involved in a host of regulatory processes including activation of calmodulin-dependent protein kinases, activation of myosin light chain kinase, regulation of type 1 cyclic nucleotide phosphatase, regulation of calcineurin and other protein phosphatases, and stimulation of types I, III, and VIII adenylyl cyclase (30Zhang M. Yuan T. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1998; 76: 313-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Because calmodulin has so many regulatory targets, it would be fruitless to speculate extensively at this point regarding the specific role it plays in aquaporin-2 trafficking. However, some clues arise from the immunofluorescence localization of aquaporin-2 after treatment with calmodulin inhibitors. Aquaporin-2 was redistributed to a perinuclear location (Fig. 4 C). In a previous study in aquaporin-2-transfected LLC-PK1 cells, a similar perinuclear localization of aquaporin-2 was seen in response to reduced temperature or treatment with the vacuolar protein pump inhibitor bafilomycin (31Gustafson C.E. Katsura T. McKee M. Bouley R. Casanova J.E. Brown D. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 278: F317-F326Google Scholar). The authors concluded that aquaporin-2 recycles continuously between the trans-Golgi network and the plasma membrane and that the effect of vasopressin is to alter the steady-state rates of exocytic and endocytic translocation between these compartments in favor of increased aquaporin-2 in the plasma membrane. The effect of low temperature, bafilomycin, and putatively calmodulin inhibitors would be to decrease markedly the exocytic translocation from the trans-Golgi network to the plasma membrane or (less likely) to markedly accelerate the endocytic rate. Assuming the former, it would appear that the block is not at a late step in this translocation process, e.g. at the level of docking and fusion of the aquaporin-2 vesicles with the plasma membrane, which would be expected to arrest the aquaporin-2 vesicles in the vicinity of the plasma membrane. Rather, the blockade is likely to involve an early step such as vesicle budding from the trans-Golgi or cytoskeleton-dependent translocation of aquaporin-2-bearing vesicles toward the plasma membrane. Previous studies have demonstrated a role for microtubules in the vasopressin-induced water permeability increase (32Brown D. Katsura T. Gustafson C.E. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: F328-F331PubMed Google Scholar).A previous study from our laboratory demonstrated that, although the muscarinic agonist carbachol markedly stimulated inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate production in the inner medullary collecting duct, vasopressin did not have such an effect (9Chou C.-L. Rapko S.I. Knepper M.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: F564-F572Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These findings suggested that vasopressin (at physiological concentrations) does not activate the phosphoinositide-signaling pathway in the IMCD. This result led us to conclude that it is unlikely that vasopressin-induced Ca2+ mobilization in the IMCD is mediated by inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptors. The results of the present study point instead to a likely role for ryanodine receptors. RT-PCR studies demonstrated the presence of mRNA for both type 1 and type 2 ryanodine receptors in the renal inner medulla. However, antibody localization studies suggested that type 1 ryanodine receptor, characteristic of skeletal muscle, is expressed in IMCD cells. Measurements using the intracellular Ca2+ indicator fluo-4 demonstrated that caffeine, a ryanodine receptor agonist, induced a rapid increase in intracellular calcium. A physiological role for the collecting duct ryanodine receptor was suggested both by water permeability measurements and aquaporin-2 immunofluorescence in cultured IMCD cells. These studies support the view that ryanodine blocks the ability of vasopressin to stimulate aquaporin-2 trafficking to the plasma membrane.A direct physiological agonist for RyR-mediated Ca2+release has not been identified in the present studies. In cardiac and skeletal muscle cells, the ryanodine receptors mediate Ca2+-induced Ca2+ release in which Ca2+ ions activate the Ca2+ conductance (33Cheng H. Lederer M.R. Xiao R.P. Gomez A.M. Zhou Y.Y. Ziman B. Spurgeon H. Lakatta E.G. Lederer W.J. Cell Calcium. 1996; 20: 129-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Other regulators act to alter the sensitivity of ryanodine receptors to calcium. Such mediators include cyclic adenosine 5′-diphosphate ribose (cADP-ribose) and nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NAADP+), a metabolite of NADP (34Lee H.C. Physiol. Rev. 1997; 77: 1133-1164Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). However, a direct effect of AVP on intracellular cADP-ribose or NAADP+ level has not been documented in these cells. Another possibility is that cyclic AMP itself could regulate the sensitivity of RyR1 in IMCD cells to calcium, possibly via the action of protein kinase A. This possibility has support from several previous studies. For example, cAMP, which functions as an intracellular messenger stimulating salivary amylase secretion in rat parotid gland acinar cells, was reported to induce a ryanodine-sensitive Ca2+ release that could be inhibited by a protein kinase A inhibitor (35Ozawa T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 246: 422-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Similarly in glucose-stimulated pancreatic β cells, the effect of caffeine on calcium release via ryanodine receptors was enhanced by forskolin, an activator of adenylyl cyclase (36Islam M.S. Leibiger I. Leibiger B. Rossi D. Sorrentino V. Ekstrom T.J. Westerblad H. Andrade F.H. Berggren P.-O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6145-6150Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Also in pancreatic β cells, glucagon-like peptide-1 was found to induce a protein kinase A-dependent sensitization of ryanodine receptors (37Holz G.G. Leech C.A. Heller R.S. Castonguay M. Habener J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14147-14156Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Sensitization of ryanodine receptors by cyclic AMP has also been reported in HEK293 cells (38Gromada J. Rorsman P. Dissing S. Wulff B.S. FEBS Lett. 1995; 373: 182-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar).Ryanodine receptors are intracellular Ca2+ release channel proteins, which exist as tetrameric complexes of large polypeptide monomers (approximately 5000 amino acid residues) (39Jaggar J.H. Porter V.A. Lederer W.J. Nelson M.T. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 278: C235-C256Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To date, three different ryanodine receptor isoforms have been identified, mainly in the excitable cells. Type 1 is expressed predominantly in skeletal muscle cells, type 2 is expressed predominantly in cardiac muscle cells, and type 3 is expressed predominantly in brain. In rabbit kidney cortex and in the rabbit kidney epithelial cell line LLC-RK1, Tunwell and Lai (4Chabardes D. Firsov D. Aarab L. Clabecq A. Bellanger A.C. Siaume-Perez S. Elalouf J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19264-19271Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) detected both mRNA and protein of type 2, but not type 1, ryanodine receptors. In human embryonic kidney cells (HEK293 cells), Querfurth et al. (41Querfurth H.W. Haughey N.J. Greenway S.C. Yacono P.W. Golan D.E. Geiger J.D. Biochem. J. 1998; 334: 79-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) demonstrate the expression of both type 1 and type 2, but not type 3 ryanodine receptor mRNA. However, there were no data prior to this study regarding the expression of ryanodine receptors in rat kidney or in individual renal tubule segments. Our RT-PCR experiments have demonstrated the presence of mRNA for both RyR1 (the skeletal muscle isoform) and RyR2 (the cardiac muscle isoform) in the renal inner medulla. The use of monoclonal antibodies to these two receptors in immunoblotting experiments indicates the presence of RyR1 but not RyR2 in inner medullary collecting duct cells (Fig. 7). Immunocytochemistry using double-labeling with the RyR1 antibody and an antibody to aquaporin-2 indicates that RyR1 is distributed in the IMCD cell cytoplasm predominantly in the apical region of the cells. In the renal collecting duct, vasopressin increases water permeability by increasing the number of aquaporin-2 water channels in the apical plasma membrane via regulated exocytosis of aquaporin-2 vesicles (3Nielsen S. Chou C.-L. Marples D. Christensen E.I. Kishore B.K. Knepper M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1013-1017Crossref PubMed Scopus (877) Google Scholar). This process depends on a rise in intracellular cyclic AMP, although the mechanism by which cyclic AMP triggers exocytosis is not well understood.

Porter V.A. Lederer W.J. Nelson M.T. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 278: C235-C256Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To date, three different ryanodine receptor isoforms have been identified, mainly in the excitable cells. Type 1 is expressed predominantly in skeletal muscle cells, type 2 is expressed predominantly in cardiac muscle cells, and type 3 is expressed predominantly in brain. In rabbit kidney cortex and in the rabbit kidney epithelial cell line LLC-RK1, Tunwell and Lai (4Chabardes D. Firsov D. Aarab L. Clabecq A. Bellanger A.C. Siaume-Perez S. Elalouf J.M. J. Biol.

However, there were no data prior to this study regarding the expression of ryanodine receptors in rat kidney or in individual renal tubule segments. Our RT-PCR experiments have demonstrated the presence of mRNA for both RyR1 (the skeletal muscle isoform) and RyR2 (the cardiac muscle isoform) in the renal inner medulla. The use of monoclonal antibodies to these two receptors in immunoblotting experiments indicates the presence of RyR1 but not RyR2 in inner medullary collecting duct cells (Fig. 7). Immunocytochemistry using double-labeling with the RyR1 antibody and an antibody to aquaporin-2 indicates that RyR1 is distributed in the IMCD cell cytoplasm predominantly in the apical region of the cells."

One of the molecular mechanisms underlying IGF-stimulated myogenesis is transcriptional induction of myogenin. The current work is aimed to elucidate the signaling pathways mediating the IGF effect on myogenin promoter in mouse C2C12 myogenic cells. We show that phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt and p70 S6K are crucial signaling molecules mediating the stimulatory effect of IGFs on myogenin expression. We have identified three cis-elements, namely the E box, MEF2, and MEF3 sites, within the 133-base pair mouse proximal myogenin promoter that are under the control of the IGF/PI3K/Akt pathway. Simultaneous mutation of all three elements completely abolishes activation of the myogenin promoter by PI3K/Akt. We demonstrate that PI3K/Akt can increase both the MyoD and the MEF2-dependent reporter activity by enhancing the transcriptional activity of MyoD and MEF2. Interestingly, IGF1 does not enhance myogenin expression in Rhabdomyosarcoma-derived RD cells. Consistently, the constitutively active PI3K/Akt fail to activate the myogenic reporters, suggesting the IGF/PI3K/Akt pathway is defective in RD cells and the defect(s) is downstream to PI3K/Akt. This is the first time that a defect in the IGF/PI3K/Akt pathway has been revealed in RD cells which provides another clue to future therapeutic treatment of Rhabdomyosarcoma.

Intensive studies have led to the discovery and characterization of two families of transcription factors that play pivotal roles during differentiation (1Lassar A.B. Skapek S.X. Novitch B. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1994; 6: 788-794Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar, 2Molkentin J.D. Olson E.N. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1996; 6: 445-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar, 3Yun K.

Dev. 1998; 8: 539-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). One of them consists of MyoD family proteins (also called myogenic regulatory factors or MRFs)1 which include four members: Myf5, MyoD, myogenin, and MRF4, all members of the basic helix-loop-helix superfamily and exclusively expressed in skeletal muscles. Knock-out and knock-in data reveal the existence of a genetic hierarchy in which MyoD and Myf5 act upstream to determine the myogenic fate of muscle precursor cells, while myogenin and MRF4 act downstream of Myf5 and MyoD to control the differentiation process (3Yun K. Wold B. Curr. Opin. Cell. Biol. 1996; 8: 877-889Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar,4Arnold H.H. Winter B. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1998; 8: 539-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). The other group of transcription factors important for muscle differentiation consists of MEF2 proteins which also include four members: MEF2A, -2B, -2C, and -2D (5Black B.L. Olson E.N. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1998; 14: 167-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (856) Google Scholar). MRF and MEF2 members can physically interact with each other to synergistically activate many muscle-specific genes (2Molkentin J.D. Olson E.N. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1996; 6: 445-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar, 6Molkentin J.D. Black B.L. Martin J.F. Olson E.N. Cell. 1995; 83: 1125-1136Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (708) Google Scholar). Among four MRFs, myogenin is critically involved in executing the differentiation program. Although myoblasts from myogenin null mice are present, they do not differentiate in vivo leading to severe muscle deficiency and perinatal death of the homozygous mice (7Hasty P. Bradley A.

Nature. 1993; 364: 532-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (732) Google Scholar). Expression of myogenin is considered one of the earliest molecular markers for cells committed to differentiation in vitro. The up-regulation of myogenin, in concomitant with induction of the cell cycle inhibitor p21 cip1 , indicates that cells have irreversibly withdrawn from the cell cycle and entered the differentiation program (1Lassar A.B. Skapek S.X. Novitch B. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1994; 6: 788-794Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). Regulation of myogenin has been extensively studied by both transfection analyses in cell culture systems and transgenic studies (9Cheng T.C. Hanley T.A. Mudd J. Merlie J.P. Olson E.N. J.

A 133-bp myogenin proximal promoter has been found to contain sufficient cis-elements to correctly target a lacZ transgene to specific muscle-forming regions (10Yee S.P. Rigby P.W. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1277-1289Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). Furthermore, an E box, a MEF2 site, and a MEF3 site within this 133-bp proximal myogenin promoter have been identified as critical cis-elements regulating myogenin expression (9Cheng T.C. Hanley T.A.

MyoD, MEF2, and homeodomain-containing Six (see “Discussion”) proteins have been implicated as the nuclear factors binding to these cis-elements. Despite the above progress, how exactly these nuclear factors are activated by various intracellular signaling pathways is less well understood at present. Nor is known about the relationships between these cis-elements/transacting factors and the IGF signaling pathway. Insulin-like growth factors (IGFs) have been shown to potently stimulate myogenesis in cultured myogenic cells and are required for normal skeletal muscle development during mouse embryogenesis (16Powell-Braxton L. Hollingshead P. Warburton C. Dowd M. Pitts-Meek S. Dalton D. Gillett N. Stewart T.A. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 2609-2617Crossref PubMed Scopus (682) Google Scholar, 17Florini J.R. Ewton D.Z. Coolican S.A. Endocr. Rev. 1996; 17: 481-517PubMed Google Scholar). In rat L6 myogenic cells, IGFs display biphasic action profiles: initially they stimulate proliferation, then function as strong inducers of differentiation (17Florini J.R. Ewton D.Z. Coolican S.A. Endocr. Rev. 1996; 17: 481-517PubMed Google Scholar, 18Rosenthal S.M. Cheng Z.Q. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10307-10311Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 19Engert J.C. Berglund E.B. Rosenthal N. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 431-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). One of the molecular mechanisms underlying the stimulatory myogenic effect of IGFs lies in their abilities to transcriptionally induce myogenin mRNA (20Florini J.R. Ewton D.Z. Roof S.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1991; 5: 718-724Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). It remains obscure how exactly this is achieved. Several intracellular signaling pathways have been identified that are activated in response to IGF stimulation. One of them is mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)-mediated signaling pathway. It has been shown that the ERK subgroup of MAPKs can be activated by IGF treatment via the classical receptor tyrosine kinase/Grb2-Sos/Ras/Raf mediated pathway (21Petley T. Graff K. Jiang W. Yang H. Florini J. Horm. Metab. Res. 1999; 31: 70-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Activation of ERK may be partially responsible for the initial mitogenic effect of IGF (18Rosenthal S.M. Cheng Z.Q. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10307-10311Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 22Coolican S.A. Samuel D.S. Ewton D.Z. McWade F.J. Florini J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6653-6662Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (555) Google Scholar). Another IGF-activated intracellular signaling pathway that has attracted much attention is mediated by phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K). In response to IGF stimulation, activated PI3K converts phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate to phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate which results in subsequent activation of the pleckstrin homology domain-containing serine/threonine kinases PDK1 and Akt/PKB (23Marte B.M. Downward J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 355-358Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (649) Google Scholar, 24Alessi D.R. Cohen P. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1998; 8: 55-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (677) Google Scholar, 25Leevers S.J. Vanhaesebroeck B. Waterfield M.D. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 219-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar). Activated PI3K also leads to activation of p70 S6K , which is mediated mainly by mTOR, PDK1, and atypical PKCs (26Dufner A. Thomas G. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 253: 100-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (608) Google Scholar). It has been demonstrated that PI3K mediates the stimulatory effect of IGFs on muscle differentiation (22Coolican S.A. Samuel D.S. Ewton D.Z. McWade F.J. Florini J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6653-6662Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (555) Google Scholar, 27Kaliman P. Vinals F. Testar X. Palacin M.

A. 1998; 95: 14179-14183Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Specific interference of endogenous PI3K activity abolishes myogenic differentiation. Akt is shown to mediate the PI3K effect during muscle differentiation (29Jiang B.H. Aoki M. Zheng J.Z. Li J. Vogt P.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 2077-2081Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). Deliberate activation of either PI3K or Akt greatly enhances muscle differentiation (28Jiang B.H. Zheng J.Z. Vogt P.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14179-14183Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 29Jiang B.H. Aoki M. Zheng J.Z. Li J. Vogt P.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 2077-2081Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). However, the downstream targets that couple PI3K/Akt stimulatory signals to myogenic signaling pathways remain to be identified. The present study sought to identify the signaling pathways mediating the effect of IGF on myogenin expression in C2C12 cells, and to define the IGF-responsive cis-elements on myogenin promoter and the nuclear signal receivers/transcription factors that bind these cis-elements. We showed PI3K, Akt, and p70 S6K are critical signaling molecules mediating the IGF effect. Using IGF-mediated myogenin induction as a model, we demonstrated that the stimulatory effect of PI3K/Akt on myogenin promoter activation was mediated by the unique E box, MEF2, and MEF3 sites in the 133-bp proximal myogenin promoter. MyoD and MEF2 family proteins are implicated as downstream targets of PI3K/Akt. p70 S6K was also shown to mediate part of the PI3K signal along with Akt. We also carried out similar experiments in RD cells, a cell line derived from Rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS), a childhood malignant tumor expressing myogenic regulatory factors yet failing to undergo myogenic differentiation (30Anderson J. Gordon A. Pritchard-Jones K. Shipley J. Genes Chromosomes Cancer. 1999; 26: 275-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 31Merlino G. Helman L.J. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 5340-5348Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). We found that IGF1 failed to induce myogenin expression in RD cells. While IGF1 could activate PI3K leading to Akt phosphorylation and activation in RD, the constitutively active PI3K/Akt failed to activate the myogenic reporter genes suggesting the defect in the IGF/PI3K/Akt pathway in RD cells lies downstream to PI3K/Akt. The GBBS-Luc was generated by inserting a SacI-BglII fragment from the GBBS-CAT into a HindIII-BglII-digested pXP2 luciferase vector. G133-Luc, G133E-Luc, and G133MEF2-Luc were generated by inserting the XbaI-BglII fragments from the corresponding chloramphenicol acetyltransferase constructs into theHindIII-BglII-digested pXP2, respectively. Various binding site mutants in G133-Luc were generated by a polymerase chain reaction-mediated mutagenesis method (32Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene ( Amst .). 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6851) Google Scholar). The mutations at the E box and the MEF2 site are the same as described in Ref. 10Yee S.P. Rigby P.W. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1277-1289Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar. The primers used to make mutations at the MEF3 site are: forward: 5′-TAGAGGGGGGCTGAGCTCTCTGTGGCGTTG-3′, reverse: 5′-CAACGCCACAGAGAGCTCAGCCCCCCTCTA-3′. C2C12 cells and L6 cells were purchased from ATCC and grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 20% fetal bovine serum (growth medium, or GM) in a 37 °C incubator with 5% CO2. To induce differentiation, growth medium is substituted by differentiation medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 2% horse serum, or DM) when cells are near confluent. 10T1/2 fibroblasts, HeLa, and RD cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum. IGF1 was purchased from R&D systems. The constitutively active Akt contains an in-frame myristoylation sequence. The dominant negative Akt contains a Lys179 to Met mutation. The constitutively active PI3K is Myc-tagged with a CAAX motif (p110α-CAAX). The constitutively active MKK6 contains Thr to Glu mutations at the two conserved Thr residues in the kinase subdomain VIII. 4RE-luc contains four copies of the E box fused to the luciferase gene. 3xMEF2-Luc contains three copies of the MEF2 site fused to the luciferase gene. LipofectAMINE Plus reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) was used for all transfection experiments. Unless stated otherwise, cells were first grown in GM for 36 h after transfection, then shifted to DM for another 24 h prior to cell harvest. Luciferase units were determined in a Monolight 2010 luminometer (Analytical Luminescence laboratory) using luciferase reporter gene assay kits from Roche Molecular Biochemicals and normalized against total protein amount present in each sample extract. Protein concentrations were determined using protein assay solution from Bio-Rad. Total RNA was extracted from C2C12 cells using Trizol reagent from Life Technologies, Inc. following the manufacturer's suggestion. 20 μg of total RNA was separated on a 1% formaldehyde-agarose gel, transferred to a Hybond-N+membrane (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and cross-linked to the membrane in a UV cross-linker (Stratagene). The mouse myogenin probe and the glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase control probe were labeled using random labeling kits (Stratagene). Hybridization was carried out at 60 °C in the Church-Gilbert hybridization solution overnight and washed three times with 2 × SSC, 0.1% SDS buffer before being subjected to autoradiography. Cells were lysed in the lysis buffer (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.6, 1% Triton X-100, 150 mmNaCl, 1 mm EGTA, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10% glycerol, 100 mm NaF, 20 mm p-nitrophenylphosphate, 20 mmβ-glycerolphosphate, 50 μm sodium vanadate, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 0.5 μg/ml leupeptin, 0.7 μg/ml pepstatin) and whole cell lysates were prepared after removing insoluble debris. 30 μg of whole cell lysates was separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, transferred to an Immobilon-P (Millipore) membrane, and probed with various antibodies. The protein bands were visualized using enhanced chemiluminescence detection kit (ECL, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). SB202190, PD98059, LY294002, and rapamycin (Calbiochem) were added to cells at the time of medium change from GM to DM at a final concentration of 10 μm, 25 μm, 25 μm, and 20 nm, respectively. After 24 h treatment, cells were harvested for either Western blot analysis or luciferase assays. It has been demonstrated that IGF elicits dual effects in rat L6 myogenic cells (17Florini J.R. Ewton D.Z. Coolican S.A. Endocr. Rev. 1996; 17: 481-517PubMed Google Scholar, 18Rosenthal S.M. Cheng Z.Q. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

In the first 24 h after IGF treatment, a mitogenic response takes place in L6 cells followed (around 24 h after IGF1 treatment) by a potent myogenic response indicated by a sharp increase in myogenin mRNA and protein levels (18Rosenthal S.M. Cheng Z.Q. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10307-10311Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 19Engert J.C. Berglund E.B. Rosenthal N. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 431-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). Indeed, in our experiment, no myogenin could be detected in L6 cells at either 4- or even the 9-h time point after IGF1 treatment (Fig. 1 B). However, myogenin was detected 24 h after IGF1 treatment. In contrast to L6 cells, a much faster myogenic response to IGF1 was seen in C2C12 cells. As shown in Fig. 1 A, 50 ng/ml IGF1 potently induced myogenin protein level as early as 4 h after IGF1 treatment. 24 h after IGF1 treatment, the myogenin expression reached the peak level. In agreement with previous findings (20Florini J.R. Ewton D.Z. Roof S.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1991; 5: 718-724Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar), we showed that IGF-mediated myogenin induction occurred at the mRNA level (Fig. 1 C). As expected, early induction of myogenin in C2C12 was accompanied by a faster appearance of multinucleated myotubes of increased size when the morphology of the cells was examined by microscopy (Fig.1 D). The above results indicate that IGF1 can transcriptionally induce myogenin expression with a much faster kinetics in C2C12 cells than in L6 cells.Figure 1IGF1 treatment leads to a faster myogenin induction in C2C12 cells than in L6 cells. When near confluent, C2C12 or L6 cells were shifted from GM to DM in the presence (50 ng/ml) or absence of IGF1. For A (C2C12) and B (L6), cells were harvested at the indicated time points and subjected to Western blot analysis using a monoclonal anti-myogenin antibody (F5D). The same blot was also re-probed with a monoclonal anti-β-actin (Sigma) antibody to monitor the loading difference. C, total RNA was extracted from C2C12 cells and subjected to Northern blot analysis using a myogenin cDNA probe. The same blot was stripped and re-probed with a glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) probe to monitor the loading difference.D, C2C12 cells were fixed and subjected bright field microscopy analysis.

Endocrinol. 1991; 5: 718-724Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar), we tested whether PI3K/Akt could mediate IGFs stimulatory effect on the myogenin promoter. A 1-kilobase mouse proximal myogenin promoter fused to a promoterless luciferase gene was constructed and used as a reporter (GBBS-Luc). This 1-kilobase myogenin promoter was shown to contain sufficient regulatory elements that are responsible for somite-restricted expression of a lacZ transgene (9Cheng T.C. Hanley T.A. Mudd J.

When GBBS-Luc was co-transfected into C2C12 cells along with either an empty expression vector or various PI3K/Akt constructs, significant activation of the myogenin promoter was detected only with the constitutively active PI3K or Akt, but not with the empty vector or the dominant negative mutants of PI3K and Akt (Fig.2 A). Furthermore, a promoterless luciferase vector pXP2 (into which the 1-kilobase myogenin promoter was inserted to make the GBBS-Luc) could not be activated by either the constitutively active PI3K or Akt, indicating it is the sequences in the myogenin promoter that specifically respond to PI3K/Akt signaling. Activation of the myogenin promoter reporter by either PI3K or Akt requires a functional kinase domain, as the kinase-dead PI3K/Akt mutants (PI3K-dn/Akt-dn) failed to activate the reporter (Fig. 2 A). To further delimit the region(s) in the myogenin promoter responsive to PI3K/Akt signaling, a 133-bp proximal myogenin promoter fragment fused to the luciferase gene was also constructed and used as a reporter (G133-Luc). It was previously shown that this 133-bp myogenin promoter fragment could also specifically target a lacZ transgene to somites (10Yee S.P. Rigby P.W. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1277-1289Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig.2 A, the constitutively active PI3K/Akt-activated G133-Luc to the similar extent as they did to GBBS-Luc, suggesting most if not all PI3K/Akt-responsive elements reside within the 133-bp proximal myogenin promoter. To further prove that both PI3K and Akt were involved in regulating endogenous myogenin expression, we transiently transfected C2C12 cells with either the dominant negative or the constitutively active PI3K/Akt and analyzed the endogenous myogenin expression by Western blotting. We reasoned that, if PI3K/Akt indeed controlled myogenin expressionin vivo and the effect of PI3K/Akt was strong enough, we might detect the difference in myogenin expression simply by assaying the level of the endogenous myogenin in the total cell population including both the transfected and untransfected cells. Indeed, compared with the empty vector transfected control cells, both the dominant negative PI3K (PI3K-dn) and Akt (Akt-dn) transfected cells had reduced levels of myogenin expression in response to IGF1 stimulation (Fig. 2 B). In contrast, both the constitutively active PI3K (PI3K-ca) and Akt (Akt-ca) could recapitulate the stimulatory effect of IGF1 and resulted in significantly enhanced myogenin expression compared with the control cells (Fig. 2 B). Considering an average transfection efficiency of 30–40% in C2C12 cells, the effect of these transfected PI3K/Akt mutants on endogenous myogenin expression was quite significant. Previous studies on transcriptional regulation of myogenin revealed the single MEF2 site and the E box within the 133-bp proximal myogenin promoter are critical for induction of myogenin and correct targeting of a lacZ transgene to somites (9Cheng T.C.

Meents H. Ragge K. Buchberger A. Arnold H.H. Sandmoller A. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1999; 265: 222-232Google Scholar). We set out to test whether one or both of these sites are also required to mediate the stimulatory effect of PI3K/Akt. The single E box and the MEF2-binding site in G133-Luc were mutated either individually or at the same time. These mutations have been shown to disrupt MyoD and MEF2 binding and correct somite targeting by the lacZ transgene (10Yee S.P. Rigby P.W. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1277-1289Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). The responsiveness of these mutant myogenin promoter reporters to PI3K/Akt was tested by reporter assays. As shown in Fig.3 A, mutation of either the E box or the MEF2 site partially inhibited the reporter activation by PI3K/Akt. Simultaneous disruption of both sites did not significantly reduce the stimulatory effect of PI3K/Akt further. Since a residual 2–3-fold activation by PI3K/Akt could still be detected in the reporter harboring double mutations (G133(2+E)), we reasoned that another cis-element within the 133-bp proximal myogenin promoter might also be under the control of the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway. It was recently demonstrated that a conserved MEF3 site (Fig.3 B), present in the 133-bp proximal myogenin promoters of chick, mouse, and human origin, also plays an important role in regulating myogenin expression (15Spitz F. Demignon J. Porteu A. Kahn A. Concordet J.P. Daegelen D. Maire P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14220-14225Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Homeodomain-containing Six proteins were shown to bind the MEF3 site. To test whether the MEF3 site was responsible for the residual activation of G133(2+E)-Luc by PI3K/Akt, we mutated the MEF3 site and generated a myogenin promoter reporter with triple mutations (G133TM-Luc). As shown in Fig.3 A, this triple mutant myogenin promoter completely lost its ability to be activated by either the constitutively activated PI3K or Akt. We also mutated the MEF3 site (G133MEF3) either alone or in conjunction with the E box (G133(E+3)) or the MEF2 site (G133(2+3)). We found that mutation of the MEF3 site alone had minimal effect on myogenin promoter activation in response to PI3K/Akt signaling (Fig.3 A). In contrast, mutation of the MEF3 site together with either the E box or the MEF2 site severely compromised the ability of the myogenin promoter to be activated by PI3K/Akt. The above results indicate that the E box, MEF2, and MEF3 sites in the 133-bp proximal myogenin promoter are critical cis-elements under the control of the IGF/PI3K/Akt signaling pathway. It has been shown that p70 S6K functions downstream of PI3K (26Dufner A. Thomas G. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 253: 100-109Crossref"

Transforming growth factor (TGF)-β1 is a growth factor with pleiotropic effects including inhibition of immune cell activation. Although the pathway of gene activation by TGF-β1 via Smad proteins has recently been elucidated, suppression of gene expression by TGF-β1 remains poorly understood. We found that of Smad1–Smad7, Smad3 alone was able to inhibit expression of markers of macrophage activation (inducible nitric-oxide synthase and matrix metalloproteinase-12) following lipopolysaccharide treatment in gene reporter assays. Transient and constitutive overexpression of a dominant negative Smad3 opposed the inhibitory effect of TGF-β1. Domain swapping experiments suggest that both the Smad MH-1 and MH-2 domains are required for inhibition. Mutation of a critical amino acid residue required for DNA binding in the MH-1 of Smad3 (R74A) resulted in the loss of inhibition. Transient overexpression of p300, an interactor of the Smad MH-2 domain, partially alleviated the inhibition by TGF-β1/Smad3, suggesting that inhibition of gene expression may be due to increased competition for limiting amounts of this coactivator.

In these disease settings activated macrophages elaborate a large array of cytokines, growth factors, and proteolytic enzymes that are critical for tissue damage and repair. Given this important role for the macrophage in the inflammatory response, identification of mechanisms limiting macrophage activation is of scientific interest. Transforming growth factor (TGF)-β11 is a growth factor with multiple effects on cell differentiation, growth, deposition of extracellular matrix, and immune modulation (11Barnard J.A. Lyons R.M.

With respect to immune modulation, definitive evidence for a role in immune regulation stems from targeted disruption of TGF-β1 in mice. TGF-β1-deficient mice exhibit a wasting syndrome accompanied by a multifocal, mixed inflammatory cell response and tissue necrosis (13Shull M.M. Ormsby I. Kier A.B. Pawlowski S. Diebold R.J. Yin M.

However, the mechanism(s) by which TGF-β1 inhibits macrophage activation have not been elucidated. Recently, the Smad proteins have been identified as principal intracellular mediators of TGF-β signaling (20Heldin C.H. Miyazono K. ten Dijke P. Nature. 1997; 390: 465-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (3358) Google Scholar, 21Massague J. Chen Y.-G. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 627-644Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22Massague J. Annu. Rev.

Three classes of Smad proteins, pathway restricted, common, and inhibitory, have been identified to date. The pathway restricted (r)Smads (e.g.Smad1, 2, 3, and 5) are serine/threonine kinase-activated proteins that interact in an unphosphorylated state with a TGF-β superfamily receptor. Upon ligand binding they are phosphorylated by the receptor and released. These activated rSmads then hetero-oligomerize with Smad4, the only common Smad identified in mammals to date, translocate to the nucleus, and activate specific target genes. The rSmads phosphorylated by the TGF-β receptor include Smad2 and Smad3, whereas Smads 1 and 5 are substrates for the BMP receptor. Smad6 and Smad7 constitute the third group of Smads termed inhibitory or “anti-Smads.” They diverge structurally from other members of the family and have been shown to act as inhibitors of Smad signaling pathways by interfering with the activation of rSmads (24Hayashi H.

In contrast to TGF-β1-mediated gene transactivation, the mechanism by which TGF-β1 inhibits gene transcription is not well characterized. Because of the importance of activated macrophages in inflammatory disease states and the known suppressive effect of TGF-β1 on macrophage activation, we sought to understand the mechanism by which TGF-β1 suppresses the expression of genes critical for macrophage activation. We hypothesized that Smad proteins are the effectors of this TGF-β1 function. In this study, we chose iNOS and matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-12 as markers of macrophage activation. iNOS promotes cytotoxic effects on invading microorganisms and is up-regulated in response to endotoxin (LPS) (17Forstermann U.

MMP-12 is a macrophage-specific metalloproteinase that is critical for the penetration of basement membranes by the macrophage (35Shipley J.M. Wesselschmidt R.L. Kobayashi D.K. Ley T.J. Shapiro S.D.

We provide evidence that Smad3 is a critical effector responsible for the inhibition of macrophage gene activation by TGF-β1. Our data suggest that competition for essential coactivators such as p300 may be an important determinant in regulating the degree of macrophage activation and inhibition by TGF-β1.

John Wiley & Sons, New York1993: 4.12-4.27Google Scholar). In brief we first generated a 5′ fragment of Smad3 containing the mutation in the antisense primer (underlined) 5′-ACCTGCAACGCGCCATCCAGGGACC-3′ and a 3′ fragment containing the mutation in the sense primer 5′-CGCGTTGCAGGTGTCCCATCGGAAG-3′. These fragments were annealed, extended by Taq polymerase, and then used as a template in a second polymerase chain reaction using 5′-terminal and 3′-terminal primers of Smad3 to generate a full-length expression plasmid with the following mutation: Arg-74 → Ala-74 (CGG → GCG). To generate an expression vector only containing the MH-1 domain of Smad3, a Smad3 fragment containing amino acids 1–144 was cloned into the XhoI/NotI site of pcDNA3.1(−). A second MH-1 construct was generated by polymerase chain reaction ranging from base pairs 1 to 425 of the coding region (containing amino acids 1–141 of Smad3) using a custom made antisense primer to Smad3 (5′-CGTGGCACCAACACAGGAGG-3′). This fragment was cloned into the SalI/XhoI sites of the nuclear localization vector pCMV/myc/nuc (Invitrogen). The p300 deletion construct containing amino acids 1840–1960 (p300Δ) was generated from mouse cDNA using the following primers: upper, 5′-ggatccaccatggtggttgggcagcaacagg3′; lower, 5′-aagcttgagtcatcgggggcatctgg-3′. RAW264.7 cells were transfected with FugeneTM6 Transfection Reagent (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) on 6-well plates as described by the manufacturer. In brief, 2.5–3 μg of total plasmid DNA was used in the experiments. Cells were treated with LPS (15 ng/ml), TGF-β1 (2.5 to 10 ng/ml), or a combination of the two reagents 12 h after transfection. 24 h after stimulation cells were harvested for assays of luciferase and β-galactosidase. Luciferase activity was normalized to β-galactosidase activity (to correct for differences in transfection efficiency) by cotransfecting pCMV-βgal plasmid (CLONTECH) (300 ng) in all experiments. All transfections were performed in triplicate from at least three independent experiments. To generate clones that stably expressed Smad3 constructs, RAW 264.7 cells were grown to approximately 50% confluency on 100-mm dishes (Falcon) and transfected with 10 μg of DNA (SMAD3Δc or vector, respectively) using FugeneTM6. To select for transfectants, cells were treated with 500 μg/ml G418 (Life Technologies, Inc.) starting 72 h after transfection. G418-resistant colonies emerged approximately 10 days after transfection and were pooled and expanded under reduced G418 levels (200 μg/ml) for further analysis. Expression of mRNA and protein were confirmed by Northern analysis and Western analysis, respectively. We first assessed the mRNA expression of iNOS and MMP-12 in RAW264.7 cells in response to cytokine activation (Northern analysis; Fig. 1 A). Both genes were not expressed in unstimulated cells and were induced by LPS treatment. Pretreatment with TGFβ-1 (30 min) potently inhibited this induction. Similar results were observed with 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate as the stimulating agent (data not shown). We chose LPS as the inducing agent in subsequent experiments. Previous work has shown that activation of these genes occurs principally at the level of transcription (19Feinberg M.W. Werner F. Jain M.K. Sibinga N.E.S. Wiesel P. Wang H. Topper J.N.

Nathan C. Science. 1992; 256: 225-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (1741) Google Scholar). Consistent with these results, transient transfection assays with the iNOS and MMP-12 promoters showed an induction of transcriptional activity with LPS that was inhibited by pretreatment with TGF-β1 (30 min; Fig. 1 B). To determine whether Smad proteins could mediate TGF-β1 inhibition of the iNOS and the MMP-12 promoter, we performed transient transfection assays with a panel of Smad expression plasmids. Cotransfection with Smad3, but not Smad2 and Smad4, reproduced the inhibitory effect observed with TGF-β1. This effect was seen with both the iNOS and the MMP-12 promoters. No effect was observed with Smad1. Consistent with the previously identified role as anti-Smads, Smad6 and Smad7 increased the transactivation of both promoters above the level achieved with LPS alone (Fig. 2 A and data not shown). To confirm proper function of our expression plasmids, we used the 3TPlux and the PAI-1 promoter as positive controls. These have previously been shown to be transactivated by TGF-β related Smads in other cell types (27Dennler S. Itoh S. Vivien D. ten Dijke P. Huet S. Gauthier J.M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3091-3100Crossref PubMed Scopus (1588) Google Scholar). As expected, TGF-β1, Smad3, Smad4, and a combination of Smad2 and Smad4 transactivated the 3TPlux promoter in RAW 264.7 cells (Fig. 2 B). Similar results were observed with the PAI-1 promoter (data not shown). To further establish the role of Smad3 in TGF-β1 signaling, we performed experiments combining TGF-β1 treatment with transfection of Smad3 expression vectors. Additional treatment with TGF-β1 enhanced the suppressive effect of Smad3 on the iNOS and the MMP-12 promoter significantly (Fig. 3 A). Previous studies have shown that a downstream NF-κB site in the iNOS promoter and a proximal AP-1 site in the MMP-12 promoter are essential for the inducibility of the respective promoters by LPS (19Feinberg M.W. Werner F. Jain M.K. Sibinga N.E.S. Wiesel P. Wang H. Topper J.N. Perrella M.A. Lee M.-E. J. Biol.

Promoter deletion constructs retaining these crucial elements and concatamers of NF-κB and AP-1 binding sites showed the same pattern of inhibition by Smad3 and a combination of Smad3 and TGF-β1 (Fig.3 B and data not shown).Figure 1Regulation of the iNOS and MMP-12 genes by LPS and TGF -β1.

This construct lacks the the C-terminal 39 amino acids and thus the C-terminal phosphorylation and activation site (47Zhang Y. Feng X. We R. Derynck R. Nature. 1996; 383: 168-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (759) Google Scholar). We hypothesized that overexpression of Smad3Δc would antagonize the inhibitory effect of TGF-β1. In transient transfection assays, Smad 3Δc partially antagonized the inhibitory effect of TGF-β1 in the iNOS promoter (Fig.4 A). To examine the effect of Smad3Δc on the expression of the endogenous gene, we generated RAW 264.7 cells that stably expressed Smad3Δc. We first confirmed the expression of our construct by Northern analysis (data not shown) and Western analysis (Fig. 4 b). Next we stimulated the stable clones with LPS in the presence and absence of TGF-β1 pretreatment and examined mRNA expression of iNOS. LPS strongly induced iNOS expression in Smad3Δc as well as vector-transfected cells. However, in contrast to the vector transfected cells, the inhibition of this induction by TGF-β1 pretreatment was markedly attenuated in the Smad3Δc-expressing cells (Fig. 4 C). Taken together, these data suggest that Smad3 is a critical downstream effector in the inhibition of macrophage activation by TGF-β1. To confirm the ability of Smad3Δc to interfere with TGF-β1 signaling, we examined the mRNA expression of PAI-1 following TGF-β1 treatment. TGFβ-1 induces PAI-1 expression in many cell types including macrophages (51Hamilton J.A. Whitty G.A. Wojta J. Gallichio M. McGrath K. Ianches G. Cell Immunol. 1993; 152: 7-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), and a dominant negative Smad3 has been shown to interfere with the induction of the PAI-1 promoter and the PAI-1 derived 3TPlux concatamer in transient transfection assays (47Zhang Y. Feng X. We R. Derynck R. Nature. 1996; 383: 168-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (759) Google Scholar). As expected, the induction of PAI-1 mRNA by TGFβ-1 was markedly reduced in the Smad3Δc expressing clones in comparison to the vector transfected cells (Fig. 4 D). To elucidate the mechanism by which Smad3, in contrast to Smad2, could inhibit macrophage activation, we next sought to identify critical protein domains for the inhibitory effect of Smad3. rSmads have two distinct functional domains, the MAD homology MH-1 domain at the N terminus and the MH-2 domain at the C terminus of the molecule. To identify the critical domain for the inhibitory effect of Smad3, we first used chimeric constructs of Smad2 and Smad3 that combine the MH-1 domain of Smad2 with the MH-2 domain of Smad3 (Smad2/3) and vice versa (Smad3/2) (46Labbe E. Silvestri C. Hoodless P.A. Wrana J.L. Attisano L. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 109-120Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar). In transient transfection assays the Smad3/2 construct inhibited transactivation of the iNOS promoter to a similar degree as Smad3. In contrast, Smad2/3 had no inhibitory effect, like Smad2 (Fig. 5 a). This result suggests that the MH-1 domain of Smad3 is critical for the inhibitory effect of the molecule. The MH-1 domain of Smad3 mediates direct binding of Smad3 to DNA (27Dennler S. Itoh S. Vivien D. ten Dijke P. Huet S. Gauthier J.M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3091-3100Crossref PubMed Scopus (1588) Google Scholar,52Shi Y. Wang Y.F. Jayaraman L. Yang H. Massague J. Pavletich N.P.

Biol. 1997; 17: 7019-7028Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Smad2, in contrast, cannot directly bind to DNA efficiently (20Heldin C.H. Miyazono K. ten Dijke P. Nature. 1997; 390: 465-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (3358) Google Scholar). To evaluate whether DNA binding of Smad3 is important for its inhibitory effect, we generated a mutated Smad3 construct replacing the arginine at position 74 in the MH-1 domain with an alanine (Smad3-R74A). This Arg-74 residue has previously been shown to be critically involved in DNA binding (52Shi Y. Wang Y.F. Jayaraman L. Yang H. Massague J. Pavletich N.P. Cell. 1998; 94: 585-594Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (612) Google Scholar). Transient transfection assays with the mutated Smad3 construct showed that in comparison to wild-type Smad3, Smad3 R74A lost the ability to inhibit the iNOS promoter as well as to transactivate the 3TPlux promoter (Fig. 5, B andD). These data indicate that the ability of Smad3 to bind DNA through its MH-1 domain is critical for the inhibitory effect. We next evaluated the possibility that the Smad3 MH-1 domain alone might confer the inhibitory effect. Transient transfection assays using an expression plasmid for the MH-1 domain of Smad3 showed that the MH-1 domain of Smad3 alone was unable to inhibit the iNOS promoter (Fig.5 C). The experiments were also performed with an MH-1 construct tagged with a nuclear localization signal with similar results (data not shown). Taken together, these results suggest that DNA binding through the MH-1 domain of Smad3 is essential but not sufficient for its inhibitory effect. The presence of an MH-2 domain either from Smad2 or Smad3 is requisite. We next sought to understand the requirement for the MH-2 domain of either Smad2 or Smad3 in mediating this effect. Previous studies have shown that NF-κB and AP-1 driven promoters can be inhibited by limiting amounts of coactivators if these are recruited to other promoters (54Webster G.A. Perkins N.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 3485-3495Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 55Kamei Y. Xu L. Heinzel T. Torchia J. Kurokawa R. Gloss B. Lin S.C. Heyman R.A. Rose D.W. Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Cell. 1996; 85: 403-414Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1928) Google Scholar). The MH-2 domains of both Smad 2 and 3 can bind to the coactivators p300/CREB-binding protein (56Feng X.H. Zhang Y. Wu R.Y. Derynck R. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2153-2163Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar). To test whether this might be a potential mechanism in the case of TGF-β1/Smad3-mediated inhibition of the iNOS promoter, we performed transient transfection assays overexpressing p300. Inhibition of the iNOS promoter both by TGF-β1 and Smad3 was partially rescued by coexpression of p300 in a dose-dependent manner (Fig.6 A). The reverse experiment was also performed. As shown in Fig. 6 B, cotransfection of p300 increased the transactivation of the iNOS promoter above the level achieved with LPS alone. This transactivation was inhibited by TGF-β1 or Smad3 in a dose-dependent manner. These results indicate that recruitment of limiting coactivators such as p300 is important for the inhibitory effect of TGF-β1/Smad3 on markers of macrophage activation. To test the specificity of this mechanism, we generated a p300 expression plasmid containing only amino acids 1840–1960 (p300Δ). This region has previously been shown to mediate the interaction of p300/CREB-binding protein with Smad3 (56Feng X.H. Zhang Y. Wu R.Y. Derynck R. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2153-2163Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar). We hypothesized that this construct should specifically interact with activated Smad3, thus liberating endogenous p300 for transactivation of the inflammatory promoters. Indeed, we found that p300Δ was able to alleviate the suppressive effect of TGF-β1 and Smad3 on the iNOS promoter to a comparable degree to full-length p300 (Fig. 6 C). As expected, this construct was not able to transactivate the 3TPlux promoter (data not shown). Infiltration of activated macrophages into tissues is a key pathogenetic event in a number of inflammatory disease states. As such, identification of mechanisms limiting activation of this cell type is of interest. Previous studies have supported an important role for TGF-β1 in inhibiting the activation of immune cells, including macrophages. However, the mechanism by which TGF-β1 is able to carry out this function has not been elucidated. In this report we provide evidence that Smad3 is a critical effector molecule for TGF-β1-mediated inhibition of macrophage activation. In support, we found that only Smad3 was able to inhibit the expression of several markers of macrophage activation (Fig. 2). The addition of TGF-β1 enhanced Smad3-mediated inhibition (Fig. 3). Furthermore, transient and constitutive overexpression of a dominant negative Smad3 alleviated the inhibitory effect of TGF-β1 (Fig. 4). TGF-β1 activates both Smad2 and Smad3, which, upon dimerization with Smad4, carry out effector functions (20Heldin C.H. Miyazono K. ten Dijke P. Nature. 1997; 390: 465-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (3358) Google Scholar, 22Massague J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 753-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (3999) Google Scholar). Smad2 and Smad3 are highly homologous proteins (83% amino acid identity). Thus it is noteworthy that Smad3, but not Smad2, was cabable of inhibiting promoters (iNOS and MMP-12) in macrophages. To investigate this difference we used chimeric constructs of Smad2 and Smad3 (Fig.5 A) and found that the MH-1 domain of SMAD3 was essential for inhibition. However, the MH-1 alone was not sufficient for this effect (Fig. 5 B). The MH-2 domain of either Smad2 or Smad3 is also required for inhibition. The principal function of the MH-1 domain is to mediate DNA binding. Crystal structure analyses have demonstrated that three highly conserved amino acid residues directly bind to nucleotides of the Smad consensus binding site (Arg-74, Gln-76, and Lys-81 for Smad3) (52Shi Y. Wang Y.F. Jayaraman L. Yang H. Massague J. Pavletich N.P. Cell. 1998; 94: 585-594Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (612) Google Scholar). Previous studies have demonstrated that mutation of Arg-81 in Smad4 (the analogous residue to Arg-74 in Smad3) to an alanine abrogates DNA binding (52Shi Y. Wang Y.F. Jayaraman L. Yang H. Massague J. Pavletich N.P. Cell. 1998; 94: 585-594Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (612) Google Scholar). Induction of the same point mutation at Arg-74 in Smad3 almost eliminated its inhibitory effect in our study, suggesting that DNA binding is important for Smad3-mediated inhibition. Our data suggest that although the MH-1 domain of Smad3 is essential for inhibition it is not sufficient for this effect (Fig.5 B). Thus, we investigated the mechanism by which the MH-2 domain may contribute to the inhibitory function. NF-κB-, AP-1-, and Smad3-driven promoters all require p300/CREB-binding protein for their transactivation (56Feng X.H. Zhang Y. Wu R.Y. Derynck R. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2153-2163Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar, 57Janknecht R. Wells N.J. Hunter T.

Previous studies have suggested that NF-κB- and AP-1-driven promoters can be inhibited by competitive recruitment of coactivators such as p300/CPB to other unrelated promoters (54Webster G.A. Perkins N.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 3485-3495Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 55Kamei Y. Xu L. Heinzel T. Torchia J. Kurokawa R. Gloss B. Lin S.C. Heyman R.A. Rose D.W. Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Cell. 1996; 85: 403-414Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1928) Google Scholar). We hypothesized that NF-κB and AP-1 compete with Smad3 for limiting quantities of p300. This hypothesis predicts that added p300 should alleviate TGF-β1/Smad3-mediated inhibition of inflammatory genes. Conversely, increasing doses of TGF-β1/Smad3 would compete away even overexpressed p300 from NF-κB/AP-1-driven promoters. Our findings support both of these predictions (Fig. 6, A andB). Consistent with this hypothesis, overexpression of a p300 fragment containing only the domain that mediates the interaction with Smad3 rescued the suppressive effect of TGF-β1/Smad3 on inflammatory promoters in a similar degree as full-length p300 (Fig.6 C). Unlike Smad2 and Smad4, Smad3 has an expression pattern that varies with tissue types, with the highest levels of expression in spleen and thymus (60Datto M.B. Frederick J.P. Pan L. Borton A.J. Zhuang Y. Wang X.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2495-2504Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting a role for Smad3 in immune regulation. This was confirmed in gene targeting experiments that show mild chronic inflammatory disease, impaired immune response, and activated T-cells (60Datto M.B. Frederick J.P. Pan L. Borton A.J. Zhuang Y. Wang X.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2495-2504Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 61Yang X. Letterio J.J. Lechleider R.J. Chen L. Hayman R. Gu H. Roberts A.B. Deng C.

In addition, a recent study reported that the chemotactic response to TGF-β1 was affected in Smad3-deficient macrophages (48Ashcroft G.S. Yang X. Glick A.B. Weinstein M. Letterio J.L. Mizel D.E. Anzano M. Greenwell-Wild T. Wahl S.M. Deng C. Roberts A.B. Nat Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 260-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (773) Google Scholar). Our study suggests that in addition to mediating chemotactic responses in macrophages, Smad3 may also be essential for the inhibition of activated macrophages. This expands on the established role of Smad3 in the regulation of immune cells and suggests that dysregulated macrophages may contribute to the inflammatory phenotype of Smad3 deficient mice.

Taken together, the mutations of theSOX10 gene associated with WS4 in humans and the phenotype of the Dom Hirschsprung mouse indicate that one function ofSOX10 is to play a critical role early in the development of the melanocyte lineage. The identification of SOX10 target genes is crucial if the molecular basis for WS4 is to be fully understood, yet to date only one candidate target gene has been identified (9Liu Q. Melnikova I.N. Hu M. Gardner P.D. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 9747-9755Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although the genes likely to be regulated by Sox10 in the development of enteric neurons remain elusive, the genetics associated with the melanocyte system provide some clues for understanding the role of Sox10 in melanocyte development. The pigmentary defects observed in theDom mouse and WS4 are similar to those seen in mice or humans with mutations of the microphthalmia(Mitf) gene. Mitf encodes a basic helix-loop-helix-leucine zipper transcription factor essential for the development of the melanocyte lineage (10Hughes M.J. Lingrel J.B. Krakowsky J.M. Anderson K.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20687-20690Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Hodgkinson C.A. Moore K.J. Nakayama A. Steingrimsson E. Copeland N.G. Jenkins N.A. Arnheiter H. Cell. 1993; 74: 395-404Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (944) Google Scholar). Mutations in theMITF gene in humans are associated with Waardenberg syndrome type 2 (12Tassabehji M. Newton V.E. Read A.P. Nat. Genet. 1994; 8: 251-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (565) Google Scholar). The importance of Mitf in controlling the program of gene expression underlying the genesis of the melanocyte lineage is emphasized by the fact that ectopic Mitf expression in fibroblasts conferred on the recipient cells characteristics of melanocytes (13Tachibana M. Takeda K. Nobukuni Y. Urabe K. Long J.E. Meyers K.A. Aaronson S.A. Miki T. Nat. Genet. 1996; 14: 50-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar) and can induce transdifferentiation of neuroretina into melanocytes (14Planque N. Turque N. Opdecamp K. Bailly M. Martin P. Saule S. Cell Growth Differ. 1999; 10: 525-536PubMed Google Scholar). Similarly, misexpression of zebrafish Mitf results in ectopic melanized cells (15Lister J.A. Robertson C.P. Lepage T. Johnson S.L. Raible D.W. Development. 1999; 126: 3757-3767PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, it would appear that in some cells at least the expression of Mitf is sufficient to establish a program of melanocyte-specific gene expression. In the wild type mouse Sox10 transcripts are observed in the neural crest between 8.5 and 10.5 days post-coitum (16Kuhlbrodt K. Herbarth B. Sock E. Hermans-Borgmeyer I. Wegner M. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 237-250Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), whereasMitf transcripts are first detected in neural crest-derived melanoblast precursor cells at embryonic day 10.5 (17Opdecamp K. Nakayama A. Nguyen M.T. Hodgkinson C.A. Pavan W.J. Arnheiter H. Development. 1997; 124: 2377-2386Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Taken together, the similar phenotypes of the Sox10 and Mitfmutant mice and the expression pattern of these two genes during development led us to hypothesize that Sox10 might regulate expression of the Mitf gene in the neural crest-derived melanocyte lineage. In this paper we show that the melanocyte-specific MITFpromoter contains functional binding sites for the Sox10 transcription factor. We demonstrate further that wild type Sox10 can activate transcription of the MITF promoter dependent on the ability of Sox10 to bind DNA. Significantly, a mutant form of the Sox10 protein genetically linked with inheritance of human WS4 acts as a dominant-negative repressor of transcription from the MITFpromoter and can reduce endogenous MITF expression. The ability of Sox10 to regulate the MITF promoter provides a molecular basis for the hypopigmentation and deafness associated with WS4. The human MITF promoter from −395 to +128 was isolated by PCR using appropriate primers that generated 5′ SstI and 3′ HinDIII sites and was cloned between the SstI and HinDIII sites of the pGL3 (Promega) firefly luciferase reporter plasmid. The Pax3-binding site within the MITF promoter was mutated from the wild type sequence ATTAAACTACTGGAACT to the mutant sequence AGCGATACTACTCGAGGT using a PCR-based strategy, generating the plasmid pMITF.Pax3mut. The Sox10-binding sites A, B, C + D, B + C/D, and F in the MITFpromoter were mutated using a PCR-based strategy, generating plasmids pMITF-Amut, pMITF-Bmut, pMITF-C/Dmut, pMITF-B+C/Dmut, and pMITF-Fmut, respectively (details of all sub-cloning is available on request). The sequence of the wild type Sox10-binding sites and the mutations introduced are described below. The pCMV-Sox10 and pGEX-KG.Sox10HMG expression plasmids were a gift from Dr Michael Wegner and have been described previously (16Kuhlbrodt K. Herbarth B. Sock E. Hermans-Borgmeyer I. Wegner M. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 237-250Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The pCMV-Sox10 HMG domain mutant construct (pCMV-Sox10HMGdom.mt) was generated by replacing nucleotides 482–503 inclusive with an oligonucleotide of the sequence 5′-ATGGTCTTTTTTGTGCTGCATCCGGAG-3′. The MIC mutant of SOX10(6Pingault V. Bondurand N. Kuhlbrodt K. Goerich D.E. Préhu M.-O. Puliti A. Herbarth B. Hermans-Borgmeyer I. Legius E. Matthijs G. Amiel J. Lyonnet S. Ceccherini I. Romeo G. Clayton-Smith J. Read A.P. Wegner M. Goossens M. Nat. Genet. 1998; 18: 171-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (697) Google Scholar) was generated by PCR-mediated mutagenesis and introduced into pcDNA3.1 (Invitrogen) to produce the pcDNA3.1-Sox10.MIC construct. All mutant constructs were verified by sequencing. The Sox10in vitro transcription/translation vectors were made by subcloning the Sox10 HMG domain cDNA or the full-length Sox10 cDNA downstream from a β-globin leader sequence pT7plink in which Sox10 expression is controlled by the bacteriophage T7 promoter. The C terminus of Sox10 (amino acids 249–466) was sub-cloned into the plasmid pGEX2TKP to produce pGEX.Sox10C-term, which was used to express the GST-Sox10C terminus fusion protein. The transfection control plasmid consists of the G3PDH promoter used previously by us (18Carreira S. Dexter T.J. Yavuzer U. Easty D.J. Goding C.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5099-5108Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar) cloned into the Renilla luciferase reporter (Promega). The GFP expression plasmid, pEGFP-C1, was obtained fromCLONTECH. 501 melanoma cells (501mel cells) were maintained in RPMI supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and penicillin/streptomycin, and NIH-3T3 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and penicillin/streptomycin. Cells were seeded at a density of 1.5 × 103 cells/2 cm2 in a 24-well plate the day before transfection. 25 ng of promoter-reporter construct were transfected with increasing amounts of plasmid-expressing activators using Fugene (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) according to the manufacturer's instructions. An equal total amount of DNA was maintained by compensation with empty expression vector DNA. Cells were harvested 48 h after transfection, assayed for firefly luciferase activity, and the results normalized to the Renilla luciferase activity expressed from the pRL-G3PDH plasmid to control for transfection efficiency. Cells were seeded on coverslips at a density of 3.75 × 104cells/well in a 6-well plate the day before transfection. 100 ng of the pEGFP-C1 plasmid and increasing amounts of the pcDNA3.1-Sox10.MIC construct were transfected using Fugene according to the manufacturer's instructions, with the total amount of DNA being maintained using empty expression vector DNA. 48 h after transfection, cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100. MITF protein was visualized using a rabbit anti-MITF primary antibody diluted 1:100 (gift from Simon Saule, Paris, France), followed by a Texas Red-conjugated anti-rabbit secondary antibody diluted 1:100 (Sigma). Cells were mounted using Vectashield mounting medium and examined by confocal microscopy. A GST-Sox10 C-terminal fusion protein was expressed and purified from the bacterial strain BL21(DE3) p-LysS and used to raise rabbit polyclonal antiserum. Cell extracts were prepared by lysis in Laemmli sample buffer, separated by SDS-PAGE, and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane. The membrane was blocked in 10% milk, PBS, 0.1% Triton X-100 for 1 h at room temperature and then incubated overnight at 4 °C with Sox10 antiserum diluted 1 in 1000 in blocking solution. The signal was detected using a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit antibody diluted 1 in 4000 in block solution and revealed using Pierce ECL reagent. Full-length Sox10 and Sox10 HMG domain proteins were produced by in vitrotranscription/translation using the TNT T7-coupled Reticulocyte Lysate System kit (Promega). GST-Sox10HMG domain protein was also expressed and purified from the bacterial strain BL21(DE3) p-LysS, and the Sox10HMG protein was recovered by cleavage with thrombin. Oligonucleotide probes used are as follows with the mutated sequences underlined: consensus SOX-binding site, 5′-ctagaGATCCGCGCCTTTGTTCTCCCCAt-3′ (19van de Wetering M. Oosterwegel M. van Norren K. Clevers H.

Yavuzer U. Goding C.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 3653-3662Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar); WT Sox10 site B + Pax3 site, 5′-GAGAAATACCATTGTCTATTAATACTACTGGAACTAAAGA. Promoter fragments and oligonucleotides were end-labeled with [α-32P]dCTP as described previously (21Aksan I. Goding C.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6930-6938Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Binding reactions were carried out on ice for 30 min in a 20-μl mixture containing 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 50 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 4 μg of bovine serum albumin, 1 μl of ITT protein/reticulocyte lysate, 0.2 ng of labeled probe, 5% ethylene glycol, and 5% glycerol. For competition assays, unlabeled probes were incubated in the above reaction mixture for 30 min on ice before addition of the labeled probe, and binding was allowed to proceed for a further 30 min on ice. Complexes were resolved on a 6% native polyacrylamide gel run at 180 V, 4 °C, and gels were dried and visualized by autoradiography. Given the importance of Mitf in the genesis of the melanocyte lineage and the relative timing of Sox10 and Mitfexpression during mouse development, we wished to investigate the possibility that the hypopigmentation and deafness associated with mutations in the SOX10 gene reflected an ability of SOX10 to regulate the expression of MITF. As a first step, we assayed the ability of a Sox10 protein to activate transcription of a luciferase reporter driven by the melanocyte-specific humanMITF promoter (MITF-M) (22Fuse N. Yasumoto K.-I. Suzuki H. Takahashi K. Shibahara S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 219: 702-707Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar) extending from −395 to +128 using a transient transfection assay in 501 human melanoma cells that express endogenous MITF (23Hemesath T.J. Price E.R. Takemoto C. Badalian T. Fisher D.E. Nature. 1998; 391: 298-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (552) Google Scholar). The results (Fig.1) demonstrate that transfection of a Sox10 expression vector resulted in up to 11-fold activation of theMITF promoter. Activation was dependent on Sox10 binding to DNA since mutating the HMG domain to inhibit DNA binding abolished the ability of Sox10 to stimulate transcription (data not shown). If SOX10 were able to target the MITF promoter, mutations inSOX10 linked to WS4 would be anticipated to impairMITF expression. The SOX10 MIC mutant, which has been genetically linked with WS4, arises due to a G to T change at position 565 which results in the expression of a protein which is truncated shortly after the HMG domain (6Pingault V. Bondurand N. Kuhlbrodt K. Goerich D.E. Préhu M.-O. Puliti A. Herbarth B. Hermans-Borgmeyer I. Legius E. Matthijs G. Amiel J. Lyonnet S. Ceccherini I. Romeo G. Clayton-Smith J. Read A.P. Wegner M. Goossens M. Nat. Genet. 1998; 18: 171-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (697) Google Scholar). This mutant lacks the C-terminal transcription activation domain, while retaining the ability to bind DNA (24Kuhlbrodt K. Schmidt C. Sock E. Pingault V. Bondurand N. Goossens M. Wegner M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23033-23038Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar), and would therefore be predicted to act in a dominant-negative fashion by competing with wild type SOX10 for binding to the MITF promoter. Consistent with this, expression of a Sox10 MIC mutant protein in the 501 melanoma cell line resulted in around a 10-fold decrease in expression from theMITF-luciferase reporter (Fig.2 A). Thus in contrast to the WT Sox10 protein which activates the MITF promoter efficiently, the Sox10 MIC mutant that is expressed from the CMV promoter at similar levels (Fig. 2 B and Ref. 24Kuhlbrodt K. Schmidt C. Sock E. Pingault V. Bondurand N. Goossens M. Wegner M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23033-23038Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar) acts as an effective repressor. To verify that the Sox10 MIC protein could also reduce endogenous MITF expression, 501 melanoma cells were transfected with either an empty expression plasmid or the Sox10 MIC expression construct, and endogenous MITF levels were examined by immunofluorescence using an anti-MITF antibody. Cells transfected with the Sox10 MIC expression vector were identified using a cotransfected GFP expression vector. All GFP-positive cells showed severely reduced levels of endogenous MITF protein compared with either untransfected cells (Fig. 2 C, upper panel) or control cells expressing GFP alone (Fig. 2 C, lower panel), consistent with Sox10 MIC suppressing endogenous MITF expression. The most likely mechanism to account for the repression of theMITF promoter by Sox10 MIC would be that expression of the mutant protein lacking a transcription activation domain would compete with endogenous SOX10 for recognition of the MITF promoter. It was therefore important to verify that the 501mel cells indeed express endogenous SOX10. Preliminary results using reverse transcriptase-PCR indicated that the 501mel cell lines expressedSOX10 mRNA, whereas 3T3 cells did not (data not shown). To determine whether SOX10 protein was expressed, we raised a specific anti-Sox10 antibody that recognized SOX10 but not the related transcription factor SOX4, and we used this antibody in a Western blot together with extracts from 501 melanoma cells. The result revealed a band with a molecular weight corresponding to SOX10 in 501mel cells but not in 3T3 cells which are Sox10-negative (Fig.2 D). Combined with the results obtained using the MITF promoter assays, these data provide compelling evidence that one consequence of the SOX10 MIC mutation associated with WS4 would be reducedMITF expression. Given the critical requirement for MITF in melanocyte development, the reduction in MITF expression arising as a consequence of mutations in the SOX10 gene would be sufficient to account for the hypopigmentation and deafness associated with WS4 and the Dom mouse. Although we have provided firm evidence that Sox10 regulatesMITF expression, there remained a possibility that the requirement for SOX10 was indirect. However, examination of theMITF promoter revealed numerous potential partial and complete SOX protein consensus binding sites (19van de Wetering M. Oosterwegel M. van Norren K. Clevers H. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3847-3854Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). To determine whether any of these sites were bound by Sox10, labeled fragments derived from the MITF promoter (Fig.3 A) were tested in a bandshift assay together with in vitro transcribed/translated (ITT) Sox10. The results revealed that Sox10 binds well to three of the four fragments tested (Fig. 3 B). Putative consensus binding sites within these fragments were identified using cold competitor oligonucleotides against smaller regions of the promoter (not shown) and designated A–F (Fig. 3 A); sites C and D overlap to such an extent that they have been treated as a single element in our analysis. Labeled oligonucleotides specific to each of sites A–F and the Sox consensus binding site sites (19van de Wetering M. Oosterwegel M. van Norren K. Clevers H. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3847-3854Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar) were next tested in the bandshift assay. The results (Fig. 3 C) indicate that Sox10 binds strongly to sites B and C/D, less well to site F, and poorly to sites A and E. Binding to sites B and C/D was specific, with competition being impaired by introducing mutations into the putative Sox10 recognition elements (Fig. 3, D and E). Elements F and A competed between 5- and 25-fold less efficiently than either elements B or C/D, consistent with the results shown in Fig.3 C. No competition was observed using an MITF-binding site, the M box (20Lowings P. Yavuzer U. Goding C.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 3653-3662Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar), as a heterologous competitor. To determine the relevance of these binding sites for activation of theMITF promoter by Sox10 in vivo, we introduced point mutations corresponding to those used in the DNA binding assays into each individual Sox10-binding site (A, B, C/D, and F) and also into the two strongest binding sites B + C/D in combination. We then determined the effects of these mutations on Sox10-mediated activation of the MITF promoter activity in a transient transfection assay. The results (Fig. 4) demonstrate that mutation of any single site alone had little effect on the ability of Sox10 to activate expression from the MITF promoter, whereas mutation of sites B +C/D in combination severely impaired the ability of Sox10 to stimulate transcription. Thus, whereas Sox10 could activate the WT and single site mutant promoters between 10- and 12-fold, only a 4-fold activation was observed with the site B + C/D mutant. The failure to impair the ability of Sox10 to regulate theMITF promoter by mutation of either of the strong Sox10-binding sites B or C/D alone, together with the reduced activation observed upon mutation of both sites B + C/D in combination, suggested to us that these sites may act together to regulateMITF expression. Consistent with this, the Sox10 MIC mutant failed to repress transcription from an MITF promoter in which both the B and C/D sites are mutated (data not shown). Previous reports have indicated that artificial promoter-reporter constructs can be activated by Sox10 in partnership with Pax3, Krox-20, or Tst-1/Oct6/SCIP in a synergistic manner in glial cells (16Kuhlbrodt K. Herbarth B. Sock E. Hermans-Borgmeyer I. Wegner M. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 237-250Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Within the MITF promoter we have identified a strong Sox10-binding site (site B) that is immediately adjacent to the Pax3-binding site (see Fig. 3 A). We therefore felt it was important to determine whether Sox10 requires Pax3 for the activation of theMITF promoter and also whether Sox10 and Pax3 can synergistically activate MITF expression. We first performed a bandshift assay using a probe containing both the Sox10 site B and the Pax3-binding sites from the MITF promoter. The results (Fig. 5 A) indicate that both Sox10 and Pax3 can bind this probe, but we were unable to observe any cooperative DNA binding under the conditions used. This is consistent with our observation that Sox10 and Pax3 do not interact in vitro in a GST-pulldown assay under conditions when another Sox protein can efficiently interact with Pax3, suggesting that Sox10 and Pax3 do not directly interact (data not shown). To demonstrate that binding of one protein could not preclude binding of the second protein to this region of the MITF promoter, we performed a similar assay using an excess of bacterially expressed Sox10HMG domains such that the probe would become limiting. Under these conditions a ternary complex between the probe, the Sox10HMG domain protein, and the Pax3 protein was observed (Fig. 5 B). Thus although Sox10 and Pax3 can bind simultaneously to their respective sites within this region of the MITF promoter, we have been unable to observe any evidence for cooperativity. Consistent with this, we have not observed any synergistic activation of the MITF promoter by Sox10 and Pax3 in transient transfection assays in numerous cell types under conditions where Sox10 or Pax3 can activate transcription individually (data not shown). To verify that the ability of Sox10 to activate theMITF promoter is independent of Pax3, we used anMITF promoter in which the Pax3-binding site has been mutated. This mutation has been demonstrated previously to prevent Pax3 from binding to and activating the MITF promoter (25Watanabe A. Takeda K. Ploplis B. Tachibana M. Nat. Genet. 1998; 18: 283-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). As expected, the basal level of MITF promoter activity was reduced by mutation of the Pax3-binding site (Fig. 5 C), but this had no significant effect on the ability of Sox10 to activate the promoter, confirming that Sox10 activation of MITF expression can occur independently of Pax3. Our data provide several lines of evidence that the product of theSOX10 gene implicated in WS4 regulates the MITFpromoter. First, the MITF promoter is up-regulated by Sox10 in co-transfection assays. Second, the Sox10 MIC mutant protein that lacks the C-terminal activation domain acts to suppress expression from a transfected MITF promoter luciferase reporter and significantly also reduces expression from the endogenousMITF gene. Third, the MITF promoter contains multiple functional Sox10-binding sites. Our results further suggest that the hypo-pigmentation and deafness associated with the dominant SOX10 MIC mutation may arise as a result of SOX10 MIC competing with WT SOX10 for binding to the MITF promoter. Taken together with the genetic evidence implicating SOX10 in the development of the melanocyte lineage, our data provide a significant insight into how the onset of Mitf expression in development may be established. Mitf plays a pivotal role in melanocyte development. In the absence of a functional Mitf protein, mice exhibit a complete loss of neural crest-derived melanocytes (10Hughes M.J. Lingrel J.B. Krakowsky J.M. Anderson K.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20687-20690Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Hodgkinson C.A. Moore K.J. Nakayama A. Steingrimsson E. Copeland N.G. Jenkins N.A. Arnheiter H. Cell. 1993; 74: 395-404Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (944) Google Scholar), as well as a failure of the retinal pigment epithelium to differentiate (26Moore K.J. Trends Genet. 1995; 11: 442-448Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Mutations in theMITF gene in humans give rise to WS2 (12Tassabehji M. Newton V.E. Read A.P. Nat. Genet. 1994; 8: 251-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (565) Google Scholar), and in the zebrafish a null mutation in an Mitf gene, nacre, results in loss of melanophores (15Lister J.A. Robertson C.P. Lepage T. Johnson S.L. Raible D.W. Development. 1999; 126: 3757-3767PubMed Google Scholar). Given the importance of Mitf for melanocyte development, a key question is how the initial expression of Mitf is established in the neural crest. To date, in addition to the requirement for Sox10 reported here, three other transcription factors have been implicated in Mitf expression. These are as follows: the paired homeodomain transcription factor Pax3 (25Watanabe A. Takeda K. Ploplis B. Tachibana M. Nat. Genet. 1998; 18: 283-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar), with mutations in the Pax3 gene giving rise to WS1 and WS3 (27Tassabehji M. Read A.P. Newton V.E. Patton M. Gruss P. Harris R. Strachan T. Nat. Genet. 1993; 3: 26-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar, 28Tassabehji M. Read A.P. Newton V.E. Harris R. Balling R. Gruss P. Strachan T.

Mutat. 1994; 3: 205-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar); Lef1/Tcf transcription factors that have been shown in the zebrafish and in mammalian cells to confer regulation of the Mitf promoter in response to Wnt signaling via β-catenin (30Dorsky R.I. Raible D.W. Moon R.T. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 158-162PubMed Google Scholar, 31Takeda K. Yasumoto K.-I. Takada R. Takada S. Watanabe K.-I. Udono T. Saito H. Takahashi K. Shibahara S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14013-14016Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar); and factors such as cAMP-response element-binding protein that regulate Mitf expression in response to cAMP levels levels (32Bertolotto C. Bille K. Ortonne J.-P. Ballotti R. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 747-755Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 33Bertolotto C. Busca R. Abbe P. Bille K. Aberdam E. Ortonne J.-P. Ballotti R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 694-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). Since Sox10, Pax3, the Lef/Tcf family, and factors able to target the CRE are all widely expressed in the neural crest during development, why is Mitf expression restricted to a subset of cells destined for the melanocyte lineage? One attractive possibility is that the initial onset of Mitf expression is a stochastic process, requiring an array of transcription factors acting coordinately to overcome the nucleosomal barrier at theMitf promoter. Only in those few cells where such a combination of factors is assembled and active will Mitfexpression be established. The idea that stochastic events can play a critical role in commitment or differentiation has been discussed previously (34Levenson R. Housman D. Cell. 1981; 25: 5-6Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) and is likely to be related to the “stabilization” concept described by Bennett (35Bennett D.C. Cell. 1983; 34: 445-453Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) in the study of B16 melanoma cell differentiation using single cell assays. Although the onset of Mitf expression would be dependent on those factors such as Sox10 and Pax3 that are genetically implicated in melanocyte development, we can find no evidence that these factors act synergistically at this promoter despite their ability to cooperate effectively in activating an artificial reporter in glial cells (16Kuhlbrodt K. Herbarth B. Sock E. Hermans-Borgmeyer I. Wegner M. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 237-250Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). That is not to say that these proteins do not act synergistically at certain times in development, but simply that in the cell types we have tested we can find no evidence for anything other than an independent ability of each protein to activate the melanocyte-specificMITF promoter. Although we have not been able to demonstrate any cooperativity in melanocytes between Pax3 and Sox10, it is possible that cooperativity may take place between Lef1 and Sox10, for example through interactions mediated by β-catenin that is known to interact both with Lef1 factors (36Behrens J. von Kries J.P.

In addition, once Mitf expression is established there is no reason to suppose that there would necessarily be a continued requirement for the same factors later in development, and it is possible that the role of Sox10 might well be undertaken by other members of the Sox family later in development. Equally, the activity of any individual factor binding to the Mitfpromoter will be dependent on its regulation and its interaction with other factors or cofactors. Finally, given the regulation of Lef1 by Wnt signaling and the responsiveness of the CRE by cAMP, one purpose of the array of factors targeted to the Mitf promoter will be to integrate the output from signal transduction pathways acting to regulateMitf expression as melanoblasts migrate away from the neural crest to their final destinations in the epidermis and hair follicles. How Sox10 is regulated and how the DNA bending resulting from Sox10 DNA binding contributes to the regulation and architecture of theMitf promoter are key questions that will need to be addressed if the controls operating on Mitf expression are to be understood. We thank Dr. Michael Wegner for providing the Sox10 expression vectors and anti-Sox10 antibody and Dr. Simon Saule for the α-MITF antibody."
https://openalex.org/W1966219754,"Phosphorylation of histone H3 serine 10 correlates with chromosome condensation and is required for normal chromosome segregation in Tetrahymena. This phosphorylation is dependent upon activation of the NIMA kinase in Aspergillus nidulans. NIMA expression also induces Ser-10 phosphorylation inappropriately in S phase–arrested cells and in the absence of NIMXcdc2 activity. At mitosis, NIMA becomes enriched on chromatin and subsequently localizes to the mitotic spindle and spindle pole bodies. The chromatin-like localization of NIMA early in mitosis is tightly correlated with histone H3 phosphorylation. Finally, NIMA can phosphorylate histone H3 Ser-10 in vitro, suggesting that NIMA is a mitotic histone H3 kinase, perhaps helping to explain how NIMA promotes chromatin condensation in A. nidulans and when expressed in other eukaryotes."

Recently, mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) have been identified to be activated by fungal and bacterial elicitors as well as by pathogen infection.

When cells were treated with chemically defined elicitors potentially contained in the YE (chitin and N-acetylglucosamine oligomers, β-glucan, and ergosterol), the four MAPKs were found to be activated to different levels and with different kinetics.

To withstand pathogen attack, plants have developed the ability to sense elicitors, signals that are derived from pathogens or degradation products of plant cell walls. Sensing of elicitors is followed by intracellular signal transduction resulting in defense reactions such as the generation of reactive oxygen species (oxidative burst), expression of genes encoding pathogen-related proteins, the synthesis of phytoalexins, and programmed cell death. Elicitor signaling was shown to involve protein phosphorylation (1Felix G. Grosskopf D.G. Regenass M. Boller T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The importance of protein kinases was demonstrated by the ability of protein kinase inhibitors to block a variety of defense responses including the elicitor-induced medium alkalinization, oxidative burst, and defense gene transcription (1Felix G.

A specific class of serine/threonine protein kinases, denoted as MAP kinases (MAPKs),1 was shown to be activated by elicitors. In tobacco cells, MAP kinases are activated by elicitors derived from fungi (6Suzuki K. Shinshi H. Plant Cell. 1995; 7: 639-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar, 7Zhang S. Du H.

Kroj T. zur Nieden U. Hirt H. Scheel D. Science. 1997; 276: 2054-2057Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). In intact tobacco, and in dependence of a functional product of the disease resistanceN gene, tobacco mosaic virus infection leads to the activation of the MAP kinases SIPK and WIPK (10Zhang S. Klessig D.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7433-7438Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). Recently, it was shown that the Cladosporium fulvum avirulence gene product Avr9 can induce activation of SIPK and WIPK in tobacco cells that express a functional copy of the tomato disease resistance geneCf9 (11Romeis T. Piedras P. Zhang S. Klessig D.F. Hirt H. Jones J.D. Plant Cell. 1999; 11: 273-287PubMed Google Scholar). These data indicate that MAP kinase cascades are involved in defense signaling and may constitute a major mechanism for activation of defense responses by various elicitors. MAP kinases have also been implicated in mediating other signals, such as hormones, touch stimuli, cold and drought, and osmotic stress (12Hirt H. Results Probl.

Mechanical wounding of leaves induces the activation of MAPKs belonging to the SIMK and SAMK subfamilies in alfalfa 2E. Baudouin, I. Meskiene, C. Jonak, A. Gross, S. Kiegerl, P. L. Rodriguez, and H.

In this study, we investigated the possibility that MAP kinases might also be involved in elicitor signaling in alfalfa. Treating suspension-cultured cells with yeast elicitor (YE) induces typical defense responses, such as the rapid alkalinization of the medium and the production of active oxygen species (20Baier R. Schiene K. Kohring B. Flaschel E. Niehaus K. Planta. 1999; 210: 157-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). In-gel kinase analysis of extracts from YE-treated cells indicated that protein kinases with relative molecular masses of 46 and 44 kDa are rapidly and transiently activated after elicitor treatment. Using specific antibodies, we identified the YE-activated 46- and 44-kDa kinases as the SIMK, MMK2, MMK3, and SAMK MAP kinases. Multiple and differential activation of the four MAP kinases was observed with defined components of the YE. Although the MMK2 MAPK has been shown to specifically complement the yeast MPK1 MAPK (21Jonak C. Kiegerl S. Lloyd C. Chan J. Hirt H. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1995; 248: 686-694Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), no physiological process could be associated with the activity of this MAPK so far. MMK3 has been shown to be activated in mitosis (22Bögre L. Calderini O. Binarova P. Mattauch M. Till S. Kiegerl S. Jonak C. Pollaschek C. Barker P. Huskisson N.S. Hirt H. Heberle-Bors E. Plant Cell. 1999; 11: 101-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar), but no external stimulus has so far been defined that can activate these MAPKs. This study demonstrates that MMK2 and MMK3 activity can be induced by elicitors, suggesting their possible involvement in pathogen signaling and providing new tools for the investigation of plant-microbe interactions at the molecular level. Suspension cultures were prepared from callus derived from alfalfa roots (Medicago sativa L.) and maintained as described (20Baier R. Schiene K. Kohring B. Flaschel E. Niehaus K. Planta. 1999; 210: 157-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Log phase cells were used 3–4 days after a weekly 1:3 dilution in fresh medium. For elicitor experiments, aliquots of cell cultures (10–15 ml) were prepared and grown in small Erlenmayer flasks for several hours on a rotary shaker before treatment. Chemicals to be tested were delivered to the cells in water or Me2SO (1 μl per ml of cells; chitin, β-glucan, and the glycopeptide elicitor in 10 μl of water per ml of cells). At given time points, 2-ml aliquots were removed from the shaking flasks, quickly harvested by filtration under slight vacuum, snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80 °C until analysis. The YE was prepared essentially as described (20Baier R. Schiene K. Kohring B. Flaschel E. Niehaus K. Planta. 1999; 210: 157-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Briefly, bakers' yeast (250 g) was dissolved in 500 ml of citrate buffer (20 mm citrate, pH 7.5) by stirring at room temperature for 30 min. After autoclaving, the slurry was cleared by centrifugation (20 min, 7000 ×g); the supernatant was filtered and stirred overnight at 4 °C with 1 volume of ethanol. After centrifugation, the pellet was allowed to dissolve overnight in water and cleared again by centrifugation. The resulting supernatant was dialyzed overnight against water (Spectra-pore, molecular weight cut-off of 1000) and freeze-dried. 1 mg of the elicitor corresponded to a glucose equivalent of 185 μg. The glycopeptide was derived from yeast invertase (23Basse C.W. Bock K. Boller T. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 10258-10265Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). TheN-acetylglucosamine (NAGA) oligomers of degree of polymerization (DP) 7–10 and >10 were prepared as described (24Felix G. Regenass M. Boller T. Plant J. 1993; 4: 307-316Crossref Scopus (367) Google Scholar). The average molecular mass for the DP 7–10 and >10 fractions was considered to be 1.745 and 2.5 kDa, respectively. All other compounds tested were chemically defined and obtained from Sigma: ergosterol, cholesterol, β-glucan, chitin, and NAGA oligomers of DP 1–5. The NAGA oligomer of DP 6 was obtained from Seikagaku, Japan. Protein extracts were prepared by grinding frozen cells for 2 min in extraction buffer (25 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.8, 10 mm MgCl2, 15 mm EGTA, 75 mm NaCl, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 1 mm NaF, 0.5 mmNaVO3, 15 mm p-nitrophenyl phosphate, 0.1% Tween 20, 15 mm β-glycerophosphate, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 μg/ml leupeptine, 5 μg/ml aprotinin). After centrifugation at 20,000 × gfor 45 min, the cleared supernatant was immediately used for further analysis. The synthetic peptides FNPEYQQ, VRFNPDPPIN, LNFCKEQILE, and LNPEYA, corresponding to the carboxyl-terminal parts of SIMK, MMK2, MMK3, and SAMK, respectively (14Jonak C. Kiegerl S. Ligterink W.

Polyclonal antisera were raised in rabbits and finally purified by protein A column chromatography to produce the M23, M11, M14, and M24 antibodies. Western analysis was essentially performed as described (17Bögre L. Ligterink W. Meskiene I. Barker P.J. Heberle-Bors E. Huskisson N.S. Hirt H. Plant Cell. 1997; 9: 75-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Briefly, cell extracts containing 20 μg of total protein were separated by SDS-PAGE, immunoblotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore Corp.), and probed with the M23, M11, M14, and M24 antibodies at a dilution of 1:10,000. Alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Sigma) was used as a secondary antibody, and the reaction was visualized by fluorography using CDP-Star (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) as a substrate. For in-gel protein kinase reactions, cell extracts containing 20 μg of total protein/lane were separated by SDS-PAGE. Alternatively, protein samples were used that had been immunoprecipitated with the different MAPK antibodies (see below). Myelin basic protein (MBP; 0.1 mg/ml) was polymerized in the gel and used as a substrate for the kinase reaction. Protein denaturation, renaturation, and kinase reactions were performed as described (26Usami S. Banno H. Ito Y. Nishihama R. Machida Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8660-8664Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Cell extracts containing 100 μg of total protein were immunoprecipitated overnight with 5 μg of protein A-purified M23, M11, M14, and M24 antibodies for SIMK, MMK2, MMK3 and SAMK, respectively. The immunoprecipitated kinases were washed three times with wash buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 250 mm NaCl, 5 mm EGTA, 5 mm EDTA, 0.1% Tween 20, 5 mm NaF) and once with kinase buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 15 mm MgCl2, 5 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol). Kinase reactions were performed as described (17Bögre L. Ligterink W. Meskiene I. Barker P.J. Heberle-Bors E. Huskisson N.S. Hirt H. Plant Cell. 1997; 9: 75-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Briefly, the immunocomplexes were incubated for 30 min at room temperature in 15 μl of kinase buffer containing 1 mg/ml MBP, 0.1 mm ATP, and 2 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP. The reaction was stopped by adding SDS-PAGE loading buffer, and the phosphorylation of MBP was analyzed by autoradiography or quantified by PhosphorImager analysis after SDS-PAGE. For peptide competition analyses, 100 μg of total proteins were subjected to a 2-h immunoprecipitation with 2 μg of M23, M11, M14, or M24 protein A-purified antibodies that had been preincubated overnight with different amounts of the peptide against which the sera were raised; an in vitro kinase assay was then performed on the immunoprecipitated proteins, as described above. Among the various responses to elicitor molecules in plants, the induction of MAPKs was reported in different systems (27Zhang S. Klessig D.F. Results Probl. Cell Differ. 2000; 27: 65-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 28Hirt H. Scheel D. Results Probl. Cell Differ. 2000; 27: 85-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). As a first test for the activation of MAP kinases by elicitors in alfalfa, suspension-cultured cells were treated with YE. Aliquots from YE-treated cells were collected at different time points and analyzed by in-gel kinase assays using MBP as an artificial substrate. As shown in Fig. 1, protein kinases with relative molecular masses of 46 and 44 kDa are rapidly activated in elicitor-treated cells. The 46- and 44-kDa protein kinases revealed maximum activation levels at 15 min after elicitor addition before becoming inactivated by 40 min. These data show that the yeast elicitor rapidly induces the transient activation of protein kinase pathways in alfalfa cells.Figure 1The YE induces the activation of 46- and 44-kDa protein kinases in suspension-cultured cells. Alfalfa cells were treated with 500 μg/ml of YE. At the indicated times, cell extracts were prepared. Extracts containing 20 μg of total protein were separated by SDS-PAGE containing 0.1 mg/ml myelin basic protein. After protein renaturation, kinase reactions were performed in the gel and analyzed by autoradiography. The relative distance migrated by a 44- and 46-kDa marker protein is indicated.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To investigate whether the 46- and 44-kDa protein kinases correspond to known MAPKs from alfalfa, YE-treated cell extracts were immunoprecipitated with antibodies specifically recognizing SIMK, MMK2, MMK3, and SAMK. The specificity of the antibodies on the corresponding recombinant proteins was previously shown by Western blotting (16Munnik T. Ligterink W. Meskiene I. Calderini O. Beyerly J. Musgrave A. Hirt H. Plant J. 1999; 20: 381-388Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Additional proof was obtained when elicitor-induced SIMK, MMK2, MMK3, and SAMK activity could be competed with the peptides against which the corresponding antibodies were raised (Fig. 2 A). Equal amounts of total protein extracted from YE-treated cells were immunoprecipitated with antibodies that had been preincubated with increasing amounts of peptide. The immunoprecipitated MAPKs were subjected to in vitro kinase assay using MBP as a substrate, and the reaction products were analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by autoradiography. In order to discard the possibility of carry-over or nonspecific binding among the four MAPKs under study and their antibodies, in vitro translated 35S-labeled SIMK, MMK2, MMK3, and SAMK were immunoprecipitated, separated by SDS-PAGE, and analyzed by autoradiography. Only the antibody that was raised against the respective C-terminal MAPK sequence could precipitate the corresponding MAPK protein (Fig. 2 B). These results indicate that M23, M11, M14, and M24 antibodies specifically immunoprecipitate SIMK, MMK2, MMK3, and SAMK, respectively. A variety of bacterial and fungal elicitors as well as pathogen attack result in the activation of MAPKs belonging to the SIMK and/or SAMK subfamilies in tobacco, parsley, Arabidopsis, and tomato (7Zhang S. Du H. Klessig D.F. Plant Cell. 1998; 10: 435-450PubMed Google Scholar,9Ligterink W. Kroj T. zur Nieden U. Hirt H. Scheel D.

Ryan C.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11085-11089Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). This suggests that these two classes of MAP kinases might be general mediators of elicitor-induced responses in plants. To determine whether the YE-activated 46- and 44-kDa MAPK activities correlated with the activation of SIMK and SAMK, cell extracts were analyzed by immunokinase assays using the SIMK and SAMK-specific antibodies M23 and M24. SIMK was strongly activated by the YE, whereas SAMK revealed a comparatively weaker response (Fig.3 A). We also tested if activation of two other MAP kinases, MMK2 and MMK3, could be detected by kinase assays of MAPKs immunoprecipitated with the specific antibodies M11 and M14. As shown in Fig. 3 A, both MMK3 and MMK2 were activated in response to the YE. The four MAP kinases showed similar activity profiles with a maximum of activity at about 15 min after YE addition (Fig. 3 A). These results demonstrate that YE can activate several distinct MAP kinase pathways in alfalfa cells. They also show that the major MBP-phosphorylating activity associated with the 46- and 44-kDa MAPKs identified in the in-gel kinase assays of YE-treated cell extracts (see Fig. 1) is due to the activation of at least four distinct MAPKs. To determine whether the protein amounts of the MAPKs change in response to YE, 20 μg of total protein from elicitor-treated cells were separated by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with the MAPK-specific antibodies. As shown in Fig. 3 B, M23, M11, M14, and M24 antibodies detected protein bands of 46, 44, 44, and 44 kDa, respectively, corresponding to the SIMK, MMK2, MMK3, and SAMK proteins. In contrast to the changes in kinase activities, the amounts of the different MAPK proteins did not vary over the experimental period of 60 min. These data indicate that the transient activation of all four MAP kinases occurs by a post-translational mechanism. Given the complex mixture of chemical substances in the YE preparation, we investigated the possibility that specific MAPKs might respond to specific elicitors and that the complex activation pattern of the MAPKs could reflect the presence of distinct elicitors in the YE. For this purpose, several substances that are present in the YE and have been shown to possess elicitor activity were tested for their capacity of inducing the activation of the four distinct MAP kinase pathways. In addition, time course studies of MAPK activation were performed at different elicitor concentrations to define the threshold of perception and saturation. Chitin is a common constituent of fungal cell walls and has been shown to induce medium alkalinization in tomato cells (24Felix G. Regenass M. Boller T. Plant J. 1993; 4: 307-316Crossref Scopus (367) Google Scholar, 30Inui H. Yamaguchi Y. Hirano S. Biosci. Biotechnol. Biochem. 1997; 61: 975-978Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). In alfalfa cells, chitin resulted in the transient activation of all four MAPK pathways, with a peak at 5 min for SIMK and MMK2. MMK3 activity showed a broader peak with a maximum at about 10 min (Fig.4). SAMK was only activated to a minor degree. The results of dose-response studies confirmed the specific and highly sensitive perception of chitin, revealing a concentration threshold between 10 and 100 ng/ml (data not shown) as reported for tomato cells (24Felix G.

Ergosterol is the main sterol of most fungi, and tomato cells can perceive it as a non-self-determinant in a highly sensitive and selective manner (32Granado J. Felix G. Boller T. Plant Physiol. 1995; 107: 485-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). The animal analogue cholesterol was taken as a negative control, since it was not perceived as an elicitor by tomato cells. Whereas cholesterol was unable to activate any MAPK, saturating concentrations of ergosterol were found to mainly activate SIMK, MMK3, and SAMK (Fig. 4). SIMK and SAMK activities peaked at about 10 min, and MMK3 activity peaked between 10 and 15 min. In agreement with a previous report (32Granado J. Felix G. Boller T. Plant Physiol. 1995; 107: 485-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), the sensitivity threshold of ergosterol was determined to be between 1 and 10 pm (data not shown), which is in agreement with the assumption of a high affinity perception system in alfalfa cells. The β-glucan elicitor is mainly composed of β-(1,3) glucose chains containing small amounts of β-(1,6)-linked glucose side branches. β-glucan is a component of the cell walls of many fungi and was shown to induce alkalinization in tomato cells (24Felix G. Regenass M. Boller T. Plant J. 1993; 4: 307-316Crossref Scopus (367) Google Scholar). In our system, β-glucan efficiently induced all four MAPKs, with broad activation profiles between 5 and 15 min for all MAPKs (Fig. 4). The dose-response threshold for this elicitor was compatible with previous observations that revealed the elicitation of several responses at concentrations between 10 and 100 ng/ml (data not shown; Ref. 24Felix G. Regenass M. Boller T. Plant J. 1993; 4: 307-316Crossref Scopus (367) Google Scholar). A glycopeptide derived from yeast extracellular invertase was also tested as elicitor. This glycopeptide was shown to induce ethylene biosynthesis at very low doses in tomato cells, mimicking the response to a complex mixture of glycopeptides originally extracted from the YE (23Basse C.W. Bock K. Boller T. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 10258-10265Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 33Basse C.W. Fath A. Boller T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14724-14731Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The glycopeptide from yeast invertase was used at a maximal concentration of 10 μg/ml but gave no induction of SIMK, MMK2, MMK3, or SAMK (Fig. 4). The elicitor concentration used was more than 100-fold higher than the saturation threshold for the ethylene response in tomato cells (23Basse C.W. Bock K. Boller T. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 10258-10265Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Chitin is an elicitor of defense responses and was able to activate SIMK, MMK2, MMK3, and to a lesser extent also SAMK. In some systems, chitin fragments can also act as elicitors, but short oligomers with a DP below 3 are unable to elicit a response (24Felix G. Regenass M. Boller T. Plant J. 1993; 4: 307-316Crossref Scopus (367) Google Scholar). To investigate whether the chitin fragment length is important for the activation of specific MAPK pathways, we treated alfalfa cells with various NAGA oligomers spanning the whole range of DP 1–10. As shown in Fig. 5, N-acetylglucosamine and its dimer were unable to activate any of the four MAPK pathways. However, NAGA oligomers of DP 3 and higher induced the activation of the four MAPK pathways to levels and with kinetics similar to those induced by the chitin polymer. These results demonstrate that a minimum length of three glucosamine residues of the sugar backbone is required for the NAGA oligomers to be perceived. Moreover, our data suggest that at least four distinct MAP kinase pathways are involved in signaling this class of elicitors. In order to determine whether immunoprecipitated kinase activities corresponded to the MBP kinase activities detected by in-gel kinase assays, protein extracts of suspension-cultured cells that had been treated with chitin for 5 min (see Fig. 4) were immunoprecipitated with M23, M11, M14, and M24 antibodies. The immunoprecipitated MAPKs were subjected to SDS-PAGE and in-gel kinase activity assays. Under these conditions, single active protein kinases could be identified whose migration corresponded to that of the 46-kDa SIMK and to the 44-kDa MMK3 and SAMK (Fig.6). The immunoprecipitated activities of SIMK, MMK3, and SAMK also corresponded to the relative activities observed in total extracts of chitin-treated cells (Fig. 6,Total extract). Surprisingly, no active MMK2 could be detected by in-gel kinase assays after immunoprecipitation with the MMK2-specific antibody (Fig. 6). Since MMK2 was found to be activated strongly by chitin in immunokinase assays (Fig. 4), the lack of detectable MMK2 activity in the in-gel kinase assay cannot be explained by inefficient immunoprecipitation of MMK2. The most likely explanation is that MMK2 is unable to renature into an active conformation under the conditions of the in-gel kinase assay. Furthermore, this experiment gives additional proof for the specificity of the antibodies showing no unspecific physical binding (as already proven in Fig. 2 B and by Ref. 16Munnik T. Ligterink W. Meskiene I. Calderini O. Beyerly J. Musgrave A. Hirt H. Plant J. 1999; 20: 381-388Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and no carry-over of foreign MAPK activity. Indeed, SIMK activity, which is visualized in this assay as a band migrating at 46 kDa, does not contaminate any of the three samples immunoprecipitated with MMK2, MMK3, and SAMK antibodies. Vice versa, the activity precipitated by the SIMK antibody is not contaminated by any activity for which a 44-kDa protein (such as MMK3 and SAMK) would be responsible. Samples immunoprecipitated with the MMK2 antibody are clearly devoid of MBP-phosphorylating activity from any of the three other MAPKs. Although this test would not allow us to exclude cross-reaction between MMK3 and SAMK antibodies, and vice versa, the activation of MMK3 but not of SAMK during cell cycle speaks against carry-over of MMK3 by the SAMK antibody (22Bögre L. Calderini O. Binarova P. Mattauch M. Till S. Kiegerl S. Jonak C. Pollaschek C. Barker P. Huskisson N.S. Hirt H. Heberle-Bors E. Plant Cell. 1999; 11: 101-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the wound-induced activation of SAMK, but not of MMK3, excludes the possibility of unspecific precipitation of SAMK by the MMK3 antibody (17Bögre L. Ligterink W. Meskiene I. Barker P.J. Heberle-Bors E. Huskisson N.S. Hirt H. Plant Cell. 1997; 9: 75-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Protein phosphorylation has been shown to be involved in mediating elicitor-induced defense responses in a number of systems. Although the responsible protein kinases and phosphatases are largely unknown, recent evidence indicates that MAP kinases are involved in these pathways (7Zhang S. Du H. Klessig D.F.

The 60-kDa BWMK1 from rice is so far the only MAP kinase that is induced by fungal infection and wounding (35He C. Fong S.H. Yang D. Wang G.L. Mol. Plant. Microbe Interact. 1999; 12: 1064-1073Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) and does not belong to the SIMK or SAMK subfamilies (12Hirt H. Results Probl. Cell Differ. 2000; 27: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Our results demonstrate that distinct elicitors not only activate SIMK and SAMK, but also MMK2 and MMK3, two MAP kinases that have not been connected to stress signaling so far. In fact, MMK2 and MMK3 could not be activated in leaves upon wounding, cold, heat, and drought (14Jonak C. Kiegerl S. Ligterink W. Barker P.J. Huskisson N.S. Hirt H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 11274-11279Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar, 17Bögre L. Ligterink W. Meskiene I. Barker P.J. Heberle-Bors E. Huskisson N.S. Hirt H. Plant Cell. 1997; 9: 75-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar), or in suspension-cultured cells upon osmotic stress (16Munnik T. Ligterink W. Meskiene I. Calderini O. Beyerly J. Musgrave A. Hirt H. Plant J. 1999; 20: 381-388Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). What could be the role of MMK2 and MMK3 in the response to biotic stresses? MMK2 was shown to be a functional kinase that can specifically complement yeast cells with a deficiency in the yeast MAPK Mpk1 (21Jonak C. Kiegerl S. Lloyd C. Chan J. Hirt H. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1995; 248: 686-694Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Similar to several cytoskeletal mutants, Mpk1-deficient cells show a cell wall defect and suffer from aberrant vesicular transport and cisternal membrane accumulation, suggesting that Mpk1 might regulate the cytoskeleton. In accordance with such a role, MMK2 was able to specifically phosphorylate a 39-kDa cytoskeletal protein (21Jonak C. Kiegerl S. Lloyd C. Chan J. Hirt H. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1995; 248: 686-694Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Dramatic changes and rearrangements of the cytoskeleton are observed upon pathogen attack (39Gross P. Julius C. Schmelzer E. Hahlbrock K. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 1735-1744Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Although it would be highly interesting to identify a pathogen-responsive protein kinase that is involved in the regulation of the cytoskeleton, further studies are required to clarify whether MMK2 plays such a role. MMK3 has been shown to be transiently activated during mitosis (22Bögre L. Calderini O. Binarova P. Mattauch M. Till S. Kiegerl S. Jonak C. Pollaschek C. Barker P. Huskisson N.S. Hirt H. Heberle-Bors E. Plant Cell. 1999; 11: 101-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). During cytokinesis, MMK3 was found to be associated with the plane of cell division, a site where microtubule-based transport and fusion of vesicles takes place to form the phragmoplast. These data suggest a role for MMK3 in the regulation of cell cycle-dependent cell wall formation (22Bögre L. Calderini O. Binarova P. Mattauch M. Till S. Kiegerl S. Jonak C. Pollaschek C. Barker P. Huskisson N.S. Hirt H. Heberle-Bors E. Plant Cell. 1999; 11: 101-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Plant cells restructure and fortify their cell walls upon pathogen attack. It is therefore tempting to speculate that the elicitor-induced activation of the MMK3 pathway could serve a role in regulating certain aspects of this process, but more work is necessary to test this hypothesis. Convergence of R/Avr-dependent signal transduction pathways, non-race-specific elicitors, and even abiotic stimuli at the level of MAP kinases has been shown in tobacco. In this system, the activation of SIPK is observed upon treatment by non-race-specific elicitors (7Zhang S. Du H. Klessig D.F. Plant Cell. 1998; 10: 435-450PubMed Google Scholar), as well as upon Avr9/Cf9-dependent recognition (11Romeis T. Piedras P. Zhang S. Klessig D.F. Hirt H. Jones J.D. Plant Cell. 1999; 11: 273-287PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, SIPK was shown to be activated by pathogen infection (10Zhang S. Klessig D.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7433-7438Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar) and abiotic stimuli like wounding and mechanical stress (19Zhang S. Klessig D.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7225-7230Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). We have reported that various abiotic stresses can activate SIMK (16Munnik T. Ligterink W. Meskiene I. Calderini O. Beyerly J. Musgrave A. Hirt H. Plant J. 1999; 20: 381-388Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and SAMK (13Bögre L. Ligterink W. Heberle-Bors E. Hirt H. Nature. 1996; 383: 489-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 14Jonak C. Kiegerl S. Ligterink W. Barker P.J. Huskisson N.S. Hirt H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Plant Cell. 1997; 9: 75-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar), the alfalfa homologues of tobacco SIPK and WIPK, respectively. In this study, we show that different elicitors can also activate SIMK and SAMK, indicating that multiple signals must be integrated for stress activation of SIMK and SAMK pathways. In addition, we identified two elicitor-responsive MAPKs that were not found to be activated by abiotic stress and whose activation could be regarded at as a landmark of cellular responses to biotic as compared with abiotic stress. Given the heterogeneous chemical composition of the YE, it was unclear whether the activation of multiple MAP kinase pathways was due to a single component or to the combined effects of several factors present in the yeast elicitor preparation. To address this question, we treated cells with chemically defined substances that are potentially present in the YE preparation and for which elicitor activity has been demonstrated (24Felix G. Regenass M. Boller T. Plant J. 1993; 4: 307-316Crossref Scopus (367) Google Scholar, 29Stratmann J.W. Ryan C.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Biochem. 1997; 61: 975-978Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 40Grosskopf D.G. Felix G. Boller T. J. Plant Physiol. 1991; 138: 741-746Crossref Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Immunokinase analysis confirmed that chitin, ergosterol, and β-glucan have the ability to activate MAPK pathways. It is noteworthy that the activation of the MAPK pathways occurred in a dose-dependent manner. To ensure receptor saturation, the experiments presented in Figs. Figure 3, Figure 4, Figure 5 were all performed at concentrations at least 100-fold higher than the threshold level of saturation for the respective elicitor. It should also be noted that the absence of MAPK activation by the invertase glycopeptide does not necessarily mean that this substance is not perceived by alfalfa cells, but it could indicate that signaling is not coupled to MAPK cascades. In summary, for chitin fragments, ergosterol, and β-glucan, it is clear that these substances activate different sets of MAPK pathways (Fig. 7 A). In at least these three cases, the specificity of the chemoperception system appears to be reflected in the combinatorial pattern as well as the kinetics and levels of the activated pathways. In analogy to proposed models in animal and yeast signaling (reviewed in Refs. 41Nishida E. Gotoh Y. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1993; 18: 128-131Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (961) Google Scholar and 42Herskowitz I. Cell. 1995; 80: 187-197Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (865) Google Scholar), it is tempting to speculate that the response to a given elicitor might be specified not only by the particular mix of engaged pathways but also by the duration and level of their activities. How can a plant cell integrate stimuli coming from the perception of substances that are so diverse in chemical composition and structure? The observation that a given elicitor can activate several distinct MAPKs suggests that soon after elicitor perception branching into several transduction pathways must occur (Fig. 7 B). It is not yet clear how branching into multiple cascades occurs at the molecular level, but MAPK kinase kinases are good candidates for such a function, because they can regulate diverse MAPK kinases that in turn are responsible for activation of distinct MAPKs. At the same time, we have also observed that in some cases elicitors of completely different chemical composition and structure can activate the same MAPK pathways (Fig. 7 C). These findings indicate that convergence of distinct signaling pathways must occur upstream or at the level of MAPKs. At present, it is mostly unclear how branching and integration of signaling pathways work at the molecular level, but scaffold proteins might give an answer. A recently identified MAPK scaffold protein 3K. Zwerger, I. Meskiene, and H. Hirt, unpublished results. has binding sites for G-proteins and phospholipids and might therefore serve as integration point for multiple upstream signals. Whatever the exact mechanism(s), this discussion makes it clear that our present concept of signal transduction is still very immature. In our view, the identification of the upstream components and of the scaffold proteins of the elicitor-activated MAPK pathways will be essential to understand the interaction and activation of the different cascades in the context of different elicitors. This knowledge should also help to unravel how integration, branching, and cross-talk among different pathways occur at the molecular level."

Although much attention has been paid to the expression and secretion of amylin, little is known about the enzymes involved in amylin turnover. Recent reports suggest that insulin-degrading enzyme (IDE) may have specificity for amyloidogenic proteins, and therefore we sought to determine whether amylin is an IDE substrate. Amylin-degrading activity co-purified with IDE from rat muscle through several chromatographic steps. Metalloproteinase inhibitors inactivated amylin-degrading activity with a pattern consistent with the enzymatic properties of IDE, whereas inhibitors of acid and serine proteases, calpains, and the proteasome were ineffective. Amylin degradation was inhibited by insulin in a dose-dependent manner, whereas insulin degradation was inhibited by amylin. Other substrates of IDE such as atrial natriuretic peptide and glucagon also competitively inhibited amylin degradation. Radiolabeled amylin and insulin were both covalently cross-linked to a protein of 110 kDa, and the binding was competitively inhibited by either unlabeled insulin or amylin. Finally, a monoclonal anti-IDE antibody immunoprecipitated both insulin- and amylin-degrading activities.

Andrikopoulos S. Verchere C.B. Diabetes. 1999; 48: 241-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar). These deposits are thought to contribute to pancreatic beta cell dysfunction, either by direct cytotoxicity or by reducing beta cell mass (2Johnson K.H. O'Brien T.D. Betsholtz C. Westermark P. N. Engl. J. Med. 1989; 321: 513-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). Understanding the mechanisms of amyloid formation, and how fibril formation is prevented under normal conditions, is therefore of particular interest in the study of Type 2 diabetes. Because amylin is continually produced in non-diabetic humans with no amyloid formation, the mere presence of amylin is not sufficient to cause fibril formation, a concept that has been supported in studies using transgenic mice expressing human amylin (3Verchere C.B. D'Alessio D.A. Wang S. Andrikopoulos S. Kahn S.E. Horm. Metab. Res. 1997; 29: 311-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Further studies have suggested that amyloid formation is associated with metabolic perturbations, such as hyperglycemia or high fat intake (4Verchere C.B. D'Alessio D.A. Palmiter R.D. Weir G.C. Bonner-Weir S. Baskin D.G. Kahn S.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 3492-3496Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). Therefore, a shift in the amylin balance either by altering synthesis, secretion, or degradation could contribute to amyloid formation. Although there have been numerous studies regarding amylin synthesis and secretion, at present there have been few studies exploring the degradation of amylin.The levels of proteins are regulated by both synthesis and degradation. The enzyme responsible for the intracellular degradation of insulin is insulin-degrading enzyme (IDE),1 also known as insulysin (E.C. 3.4.24.56). A metallothiolproteinase found primarily in the cytosol, IDE has been detected in lesser amounts in endosomes, peroxisomes, on the plasma membrane, and in an extracellular form (reviewed in Ref. 5Duckworth W.C. Bennett R.G. Hamel F.G. Endocr. Rev. 1998; 19: 608-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (675) Google Scholar). In addition to insulin, a number of other proteins have been identified as IDE substrates, including proteins structurally related to insulin such as proinsulin, insulin-like growth factor II, and relaxin (6Roth R.A. Mesirow M.L. Yokono K. Baba S. Endocr. Res. 1984; 10: 101Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), and seemingly unrelated peptides, such as atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) and glucagon (7Duckworth W.C. Kitabchi A.E. Diabetes. 1974; 23: 536-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 8Muller D. Baumeister H. Buck F. Richter D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 202: 285-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). However, insulin, ANP, and glucagon all contain regions that can form beta-pleated sheets, and thus are amyloid-forming peptides (9Sipe J.D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1992; 61: 947-975Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar). Thus, it has been proposed that, rather than displaying specificity for a primary sequence motif, IDE is specific for amyloidogenic peptides (8Muller D. Baumeister H. Buck F. Richter D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 202: 285-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 10Kurochkin I.V. FEBS Lett. 1998; 427: 153-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Indeed, recently the Alzheimer's β-amyloid peptide was shown to be degraded by IDE, and IDE was implicated in regulating extracellular levels of β-amyloid peptide (11Goto S. Kurochkin I.V. FEBS Lett. 1994; 345: 33-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar, 12McDermott J.R. Gibson A.M. Neurochem. Res. 1997; 22: 49-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 13Qiu W.Q. Walsh D.M.

Therefore, because amylin is an amyloid-forming peptide, it may also be a substrate for IDE. The studies presented here characterize an amylin-degrading activity purified from rat muscle and identify the degrading enzyme as IDE.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESHuman and rat amylin were from Bachem. 125I-Human amylin was from Peninsula Laboratories. In all cases, human amylin was diluted with deionized water from stock solutions immediately before use to minimize the spontaneous formation of amyloid fibrils. Because of variable amounts of contaminating 125I-labeled bovine serum albumin, in some cases 125I-amylin was purified by reverse-phase HPLC as described below. Biosynthetic human insulin and125I-insulin (labeled on the A14 position) were generously provided by Ronald Chance and Bruce Frank, respectively, of Lilly Research Laboratories. The covalent cross-linking reagent NHS-ASA was from Pierce. All chemicals were reagent grade or better.Rat Skeletal Muscle IDE PurificationHomogenates of hind leg muscle from 100- to 120-g male Harlan Sprague-Dawley rats were prepared and purified by 30–60% ammonium sulfate precipitation and batchwise DEAE-Sephacel purification as described previously (14Duckworth W.C. Heinemann M. Kitabchi A.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1972; 69: 3698-3702Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). The preparation was further purified by chromatography on DEAE-Sephacel, pentyl agarose, and chromatofocusing columns as described (15Shii K. Yokono K. Baba S. Roth R.A. Diabetes. 1986; 35: 675-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), except that dithiothreitol was omitted from the buffers and a Mono-P fast-protein liquid chromatography column was used as the chromatofocusing matrix. After concentration of the chromatofocusing peak using a microconcentrator with a 10-kDa cutoff (Centriprep-10, Amicon), the sample was applied to a Bio-Gel A-0.5m (Bio-Rad) gel filtration column (1.5 × 84 cm) equilibrated with 50 mm HEPES, 0.15 m NaCl, pH 7.4. The peak of insulin-degrading activity was pooled and stored in aliquots at −70 °C until used. Protein was determined by the bicinchoninic acid assay (Pierce).Measurement of Amylin- and Insulin-degrading ActivitiesThe degradation of insulin and amylin were measured by the trichloroacetic acid solubility assay. All studies were performed in test tubes coated with bovine serum albumin to prevent adsorption of the substrates. An appropriate amount of enzyme was incubated with tracer125I-insulin or 125I-amylin in 100 mm Tris, pH 7.5, for 15 min at 37 °C (reaction volume 0.5 ml). The reaction was terminated by adding 25 μl of 10% bovine serum albumin and 125 μl of 50% trichloroacetic acid. After chilling in an ice bath for 15 min, the tubes were centrifuged at 3000 ×g for 15 min, and the radioactivity in the supernatants and pellets was counted. The degree of degradation is expressed as the percentage of trichloroacetic acid-soluble counts.Reverse-phase HPLC AnalysisSamples of intact and degraded125I-amylin were applied to a Supelcosil ODS column (Supelco) equilibrated in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in water (Buffer A). The samples were eluted using a linear gradient of 0–60% 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in acetonitrile (Buffer B) over 45 min, followed by 60–100% B over 15 min. Fractions of 1 ml were collected, and the radioactivity was measured.Covalent Cross-linkingPartially purified IDE was covalently cross-linked to either 125I-amylin or125I-insulin using the heterobifunctional amine/photoactive cross-linker N-hydroxysuccinimidyl-4-azidosalicylic acid (NHS-ASA). In a total volume of 50 μl, IDE, purified through the ammonium sulfate precipitation step as above (0.3 mg of protein), was incubated with approximately 50,000 cpm of either125I-insulin or HPLC-purified 125I-amylin. To determine the specificity of cross-linking, excess (0.1 mg/ml) unlabeled amylin or insulin was included in some samples. After 30 min on ice, the samples received NHS-ASA to 1 mm (or Me2SO vehicle alone) under darkroom conditions, and the samples were incubated on ice for 20 min in the dark, then 20 min under UV light. The samples were diluted in 50 μl of 2× SDS-PAGE sample buffer, resolved on 7.5% SDS-PAGE, dried, and visualized by Phosphor-Imager (Molecular Dynamics) analysis.Immunodepletion StudiesPurified IDE was incubated with the monoclonal anti-IDE antibody 9B12 (kindly provided by Richard A. Roth, Stanford University) at various concentrations overnight at 4 °C. For control experiments, IDE was incubated with mouse anti-tubulin antibody (Sigma). The antibodies were precipitated with Protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) coated with goat anti-mouse IgG (Jackson Immunochemicals) for 2 h at 4 °C, then the samples were centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 15 min. The supernatants were removed and assayed for residual amylin- and insulin-degrading activities as above.RESULTSPurification of IDE was carried out by sequential purification from rat skeletal muscle by a modification of chromatographic methods described previously (14Duckworth W.C. Heinemann M. Kitabchi A.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1972; 69: 3698-3702Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 15Shii K. Yokono K. Baba S. Roth R.A. Diabetes. 1986; 35: 675-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Amylin-degrading activity purified through all steps with IDE, and the specific activity increased throughout the procedure (Table I), resulting in a 180-fold enrichment of amylin degradation. For comparison, insulin-degrading activity was purified 140-fold in the same series (not shown). To further characterize this activity,125I-amylin degradation was measured in the presence of increasing doses of unlabeled amylin or insulin (Fig.1). Both amylin and insulin reduced125I-amylin degradation in a dose-dependent manner (IC50 290 and 80 nm, respectively). Similarly, when 125I-insulin degradation was measured (Fig.2), both competitor amylin and insulin decreased 125I-insulin degradation (IC50 160 and 27 nm, respectively) with a similar profile to that in Fig. 1, strongly suggesting that the same enzyme is responsible for degrading both amylin and insulin. To verify that the acid-soluble radioactivity was due to amylin degradation, 125I-amylin was incubated with purified IDE for 0 or 30 min, then analyzed by reverse-phase C18 chromatography (Fig.3). Intact amylin eluted at ∼41 min. After degradation by IDE, the disappearance of the amylin peak at 41 min was accompanied by the accumulation of three degradation products eluting at approximately 26, 31, and 35 min. When the peak areas were quantified, the degree of degradation measured by HPLC was similar to that estimated by trichloroacetic acid in the same sample (∼30% degraded). In general, there was linear agreement between the two methods within the range of degradation tested (0–40%).Table IPurification of amylin-degrading activityStepTotal activityRecoverySpecific activityEnrichmentpmol/min%pmol/min/mg-foldCytosol4.481000.0041(NH4)2SO4precipitation2.3652.70.0081.9DEAE (batch)0.9521.30.0224.9DEAE (column)0.8418.60.0429.5Pentyl-agarose0.224.90.33475.0Chromatofocusing0.204.50.505113.3A-0.5m gel filtration0.030.80.807181.1 Open table in a new tab Figure 2Insulin degradation is inhibited by excess insulin or amylin.

The activity was greatly inhibited by N-ethylmaleimide, 1,10-phenanthroline, and bacitracin and inhibited to a lesser degree by EDTA and EGTA, consistent with the metallothiolproteinase characteristics of IDE. Conversely, other cysteine proteinase inhibitors (E-64, leupeptin), inhibitors of acid proteases (pepstatin), serine proteases (aprotinin, leupeptin, PMSF) and calpains (ALLN), were ineffective at inhibiting amylin degradation. In addition, because ALLN at 1 mm is a potent proteasome inhibitor, degradation of amylin by the proteasome in this preparation can be ruled out. Taken together, the amylin-degrading enzyme has the properties of a neutral metallothiolproteinase, and the inhibition profile is consistent with the enzymatic properties of IDE.Table IIInhibitors of IDE inhibit amylin-degrading activityInhibitorConcentrationInhibition%Bacitracin1 mg/ml97.5N-Ethylmaleimide1 mm95.61,10-Phenanthroline1 mm97.4EDTA1 mm21.0EGTA1 mm35.7PMSF1 mm14.4Aprotinin1 TIU/ml22.4Pepstatin-A0.1 mm5.0Leupeptin1 mm0E-641 mm7.9ALLN1 mm0The degradation of 125I-amylin by purified IDE was measured in the absence and presence of protease inhibitors at the indicated concentrations.

Open table in a new tab Because IDE degrades other proteins in addition to insulin, the ability of these substrates to competitively inhibit amylin degradation was examined (Table III). The IDE substrates insulin, glucagon, ANP, and ACTH all effectively inhibited the amylin-degrading activity. In addition to human amylin, rat amylin also inhibited human amylin degradation. In contrast, EGF, which binds IDE but with low affinity, had little effect, and insulin C-peptide, which is not a IDE substrate, had no effect. Taken together, these data demonstrate that the amylin-degrading activity is consistent with the enzymatic characteristics of IDE.Table IIIAmylin degradation is competitively inhibited by IDE substratesInhibitorInhibition%Amylin (human)24.5Amylin (rat)42.7Insulin72.2ACTH89.3ANP52.4Glucagon44.2EGF6.4C-peptide0The degradation of 125I-amylin by purified IDE was measured in the absence and presence of the indicated peptides (all at 100 nm). The data are expressed as percentage of inhibition of amylin-degrading activity in the absence of additional peptide. Open table in a new tab To examine amylin-binding proteins in the IDE preparation, covalent cross-linking experiments were performed. Early experiments using traditional cross-linking reagents such as the homobifunctional amine-reactive disuccinimidyl suberate were unsuccessful when using amylin as the substrate. This may have been due to the lack of reactive groups on the amylin molecule, which contains a single amino acid with primary amines (the N-terminal lysine). Therefore, a heterobifunctional amine/photoreactive reagent (NHS-ASA) was used. Partially purified IDE (through the ammonium sulfate precipitation step) was incubated with either 125I-amylin or 125I-insulin, and associated proteins were cross-linked with NHS-ASA (Fig.4). In the absence of NHS-ASA (Me2SO only), no cross-linking of labeled amylin or insulin was detected. In the presence of NHS-ASA, a radiolabeled band at approximately 110 kDa was readily detected using either125I-amylin or 125I-insulin. This is consistent with amylin binding by IDE, which migrates on SDS-PAGE at 110 kDa. In the presence of either excess insulin or amylin, the cross-linking to the 110-kDa protein was abolished, indicating the specificity of the binding. No other specifically cross-linked proteins were detected. These data show that a protein at 110 kDa on SDS-PAGE binds both insulin and amylin and is consistent with amylin degradation by IDE.Figure 4Covalent cross-linking of125I-amylin. Partially purified IDE was incubated with125I-amylin for 30 min, then the covalent cross-linking reagent NHS-ASA was used to analyze amylin binding proteins. The samples were resolved on 7.5% SDS-PAGE, and radioactivity was detected by phosphorimaging analysis.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To definitively establish IDE as the protease responsible for amylin degradation in this preparation, immunodepletion studies were performed. Purified IDE was incubated with the monoclonal IDE-specific antibody 9B12 at various concentrations, then the antibody was precipitated with anti-mouse IgG-coated Protein A-Sepharose. The precipitates were removed, and the supernatants were measured for residual amylin- and insulin-degrading activities (Fig.5). The removal of IDE with increasing antibody concentration correlated with a loss of both amylin- and insulin-degrading activity. In contrast, an isotype-matched control antibody (anti-tubulin), even at concentrations as high as 25 μg/ml, did not affect either degrading activity.Figure 5An anti-IDE antibody immunodepletes both insulin- and amylin-degrading activities. Purified IDE was incubated with the indicated concentration of either the monoclonal IDE-specific antibody 9B12 (closed symbols) or a control isotype-matched antibody specific for α-tubulin (open symbols). The antibodies were precipitated with anti-mouse IgG-coated Protein A-Sepharose, and the residual125I-amylin (squares) or125I-insulin (circles) degrading activities were determined.

Much of the research performed to date has focused on the expression of the amyloid-forming proteins. Little is known about the processes responsible for the turnover and clearance of amyloid-forming proteins. Recently, IDE was implicated in the degradation of the Alzheimer's disease beta-amyloid peptide (11Goto S. Kurochkin I.V. FEBS Lett. 1994; 345: 33-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar, 12McDermott J.R. Gibson A.M. Neurochem. Res. 1997; 22: 49-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Further studies have suggested that IDE plays a role in the control of extracellular levels of Alzheimer's beta-amyloid peptide (13Qiu W.Q. Walsh D.M. Ye Z. Vekrellis K. Zhang J. Podlisny M.B. Rosner M.R. Safavi A. Hersh L.B. Selkoe D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32730-32738Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (702) Google Scholar, 16Vekrellis K. Ye Z. Qiu W.Q. Walsh D. Hartley D. Chesneau V. Rosner M.R. Selkoe D.J. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 1657-1665Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, there is emerging evidence that a major role of IDE may be in the clearance of amyloid-forming peptides.Amylin is co-produced and co-packaged with insulin by pancreatic beta cells. In as many as 90% of persons with Type 2 diabetes, amyloid plaques are found in the area of the beta cells, and contribute to beta cell dysfunction and death. The studies presented here identify IDE as an amylin-degrading enzyme. In a typical series of purification steps used to isolate IDE, amylin-degrading activity co-purified with insulin-degrading activity through all steps. The insulin-degrading activity was inhibited by amylin in a dose-dependent manner, whereas amylin-degrading activity was similarly inhibited by excess insulin, suggesting that both insulin and amylin are degraded by the same protease in the preparation. The inhibitor profile identifies the enzyme as a metallothiolproteinase with properties consistent with those reported previously for IDE. On the other hand, the amylin-degrading activity was not inhibited by serine or acid protease inhibitors nor by an inhibitor of calpains and proteasomes. The amylin-degrading proteinase had affinity for insulin, glucagon, ACTH, and ANP, but not for EGF or insulin C-peptide, all consistent with the specificity of IDE. Using a cross-linking reagent, the association of a 110-kDa protein with radiolabeled amylin was detected. This cross-linking was abolished in the presence of either excess insulin or amylin, indicating that the same protein binds both amylin and insulin. This finding was supported by the observation that radiolabeled insulin cross-linked to the 110-kDa protein was also eliminated with excess insulin or amylin, strongly suggesting that the 110-kDa insulin and amylin binding protein is IDE. Finally, a well-characterized monoclonal antibody directed against IDE co-immunodepleted both insulin- and amylin-degrading activity, providing definitive evidence that IDE is the amylin-degrading proteinase.Because IDE is an amylin-degrading enzyme, it may play an important role in amylin homeostasis. It is important to remember that in species expressing amyloidogenic amylin (including humans), amylin is continually present, yet does not normally aggregate into amyloid deposits. Therefore, the mere presence of amylin does not predicate islet amyloid formation. This has been explored further in studies using transgenic animals. Although some lines of transgenic mice overexpressing human amylin displayed amyloid deposits (17Yagui K. Yamaguchi T. Kanatsuka A. Shimada F. Huang C.I. Tokuyama Y. Ohsawa H. Yamamura K. Miyazaki J.

Baskin D.G. Palmiter R.D. Ensinck J.W. Diabetes. 1994; 43: 1457-1461Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that elevated amylin alone may not be sufficient for amyloid formation. Therefore, a perturbation of some other element of amylin processing, such as amylin degradation, may be involved.Amylin from a number of species, including human, spontaneously aggregates into amyloid fibrils as a result of β-pleated sheet formation around residues 20–29 of the primary sequence. Rodent amylin, on the other hand, does not form amyloid, presumably because proline residues in this area of the molecule alter secondary structure (22Westermark P. Engstrom U. Johnson K.H. Westermark G.T. Betsholtz C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 5036-5040Crossref PubMed Scopus (696) Google Scholar). In the studies presented here, IDE degraded both human and rat amylin. It would follow that the recognition motif for IDE is not the β-pleated sheet region itself, but the structure of the peptides in the non-amyloid-forming state. Indeed, most if not all studies of IDE and insulin have been performed under conditions in which insulin does not spontaneously form amyloid fibrils. The role of IDE may, therefore, be in the cleavage of peptides with the potential to form amyloid aggregates. In this case, IDE can be thought of as a scavenger of amyloidogenic peptides. Normally, a balance exists between deposition and degradation of the amyloidogenic peptide. When the levels of the peptide exceed the capacity of IDE to degrade them, either by increased expression of the peptide, or decreased expression or enzymatic activity of IDE, the balance is shifted from degradation to deposition. In the case of Type 2 diabetes, both insulin and amylin secretion are increased due to peripheral insulin resistance. Because IDE has approximately 4-fold greater affinity for insulin than for amylin, amylin degradation will be proportionately impaired. The increased production and relative decrease in degradation may allow sufficient accumulation of amylin to cause islet amyloid formation.The site of both synthesis of amylin and deposition of islet amyloid, the pancreatic beta cells, is a logical site of amylin degradation. An insulin-degrading enzyme consistent with the properties of IDE has been reported in islets and in a beta cell line (23Bhathena S.J. Timmers K.I. Oie H.K. Voyles N.R. Recant L. Diabetes. 1985; 34: 121-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Furthermore, recent studies in our laboratory have suggested that IDE is responsible for amylin degradation in a beta cell line and that inhibition of IDE increases the formation of amyloid by exogenous human amylin (24Bennett R.G. Hamel F.G. Duckworth W.C. The Endocrine Society's 82nd Annual Meeting. The Endocrine Society, Toronto, Canada2000: 89Google Scholar). If this proves to be the case, then IDE would be a critical player in the prevention of amyloid formation by amylin and perhaps other amyloidogenic peptides. A new area of study focusing on turnover of amyloidogenic peptides could lead to novel therapeutic approaches in the treatment of amyloid diseases. A patho"

Enzymes that attack these recalcitrant polymers have a modular structure comprising catalytic modules and non-catalytic carbohydrate-binding modules (CBMs). The largest prokaryotic CBM family, CBM2, contains members that bind cellulose (CBM2a) and xylan (CBM2b), respectively. A possible explanation for the different ligand specificity of CBM2b is that one of the surface tryptophans involved in the protein-carbohydrate interaction is rotated by 90° compared with its position in CBM2a (thus matching the structure of the binding site to the helical secondary structure of xylan), which may be promoted by a single amino acid difference between the two families. Here we show that by mutation of this single residue (Arg-262→Gly), a CBM2b xylan-binding module completely loses its affinity for xylan and becomes a cellulose-binding module. The structural effect of the mutation has been revealed using NMR spectroscopy, which confirms that Trp-259 rotates 90° to lie flat against the protein surface. Except for this one residue, the mutation only results in minor changes to the structure. The mutated protein interacts with cellulose using the same residues that the wild-type CBM2b uses to interact with xylan, suggesting that the recognition is of the secondary structure of the polysaccharide rather than any specific recognition of the absence or presence of functional groups.

Understanding the structural basis of the ligand specificity of carbohydrate binding proteins is therefore critical. A very important group of carbohydrates is the structural polysaccharides located in plant cell walls, as these polymers are the most abundant organic molecules in the biosphere. The plant cell wall consists largely of cellulose (β-1,4-linked glucose) fibrils, cross-linked by a mesh of hemicelluloses, of which xylan (β-1,4-linked xylopyranose) is the predominant form (1Brett C. Walden K. Physiology and Biochemistry of Plant Cell Walls. Unwin and Hyman, London1990Crossref Google Scholar). The microbial hydrolysis of cellulose and xylan is an essential component of the recycling of photosynthetically fixed carbon and is thus of fundamental biological importance. The plant cell wall is highly recalcitrant to enzyme attack, and its degradation requires the concerted action of a large number of different enzymes that target glycosidic and ester bonds. These plant cell wall hydrolases are generally modular, consisting of a catalytic module linked to one or more non-catalytic carbohydrate-binding modules (CBMs)1 (2Henrissat B. Gilbert H.J.

The main function of CBMs is to attach the enzyme to the polymeric surface and thereby increase the local concentration of substrate, leading to more efficient catalysis (4Bolam D.N. Ciruela A.

Svensson B. Henrissat B. Recent Advances in Carbohydrate Engineering. Royal Society of Chemistry, Cambridge1999: 3-12Google Scholar). The largest family is CBM2, which has been further subdivided into Families 2a and 2b, largely on the basis of an 8-residue loop in CBM2a that is absent from CBM2b (Fig. 1) (2Henrissat B. Gilbert H.J. Davies G.J. Svensson B. Henrissat B. Recent Advances in Carbohydrate Engineering. Royal Society of Chemistry, Cambridge1999: 3-12Google Scholar, 3Tomme P. Warren R.A. Gilkes N.R. Adv.

This loop contains a tryptophan that is conserved among Family 2a members and has been shown to be one of the exposed aromatics that interacts with cellulose in the CBM2a from two xylanases (11Nagy T.

It has become clear that an important difference between CBMs in Families 2a and 2b is that Family 2a proteins all bind to crystalline cellulose (13Gilkes N.R. Jervis E. Henrissat B. Tekant B.

The structural basis for the specificity of recognition is therefore of considerable interest, especially when one considers that the difference between glucose and xylose is only the presence of a CH2OH group attached to C5. It has been suggested that the difference in specificity between CBM2a and CBM2b proteins may reside in the absence of the 8-residue loop containing the conserved tryptophan residue (14Dupont C. Roberge M. Shareck F. Morosoli R. Kluepfel F. Biochem. J. 1998; 330: 41-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). However, the recent resolution of the structure of a Family 2b CBM suggested a different reason for the altered binding affinity of Family 2b (16Simpson P.J. Bolam D.N. Cooper A. Ciruela A. Hazlewood G.P. Gilbert H.J. Williamson M.P. Structure. 1999; 7: 853-864Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). This CBM, Cf Xyn11A-CBM2b-1, is the internal CBM2b ofCellulomonas fimi xylanase 11A (formerly XylD). In Family 2a, there are three exposed tryptophan residues, which form a flat, planar surface ideally placed to interact with the flat surface of crystalline cellulose (17Xu G.-Y. Ong E. Gilkes N.R. Kilburn D.G. Muhandiram D.R. Harris-Brandts M. Carver J.P. Kay L.E. Harvey T.S. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 6993-7009Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). However, in Cf Xyn11A-CBM2b-1, the two tryptophans are approximately perpendicular to each other and are separated by 12 Å. They are therefore not well oriented to interact with cellulose, but are ideal for binding xylan via a stacking interaction with pyranose rings i and i+2 of the polysaccharide, which has an approximately 120° rotation between one monomer and the next (18Nieduszynski I.A. Marchessault R.H. Biopolymers. 1972; 11: 1335-1344Crossref Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Thus we proposed that the orientation of the tryptophans is responsible for the different ligand specificities of CBM families 2a and 2b. We further speculated that the different orientations of the tryptophan residues may be attributed to a single amino acid residue, which occurs three residues after one of the key tryptophans, Trp-259. These two amino acids are separated by a β-turn, and are thus next to one another on the same face of adjacent β-strands (Fig. 2). In Family 2a, this residue is a glycine (or occasionally alanine), whereas in Family 2b it is an arginine (Fig. 1). We suggested that the glycine, which sits partially under the Trp ring, allows it to sit flat against the protein surface, whereas the greater bulk of the arginine forces the ring away from the surface and causes it to be rotated by approximately 90°. Here we show that mutation of the arginine of Cf Xyn11A-CBM2b-1 to glycine (R262G) converts the CBM from a xylan to a cellulose binder, with an affinity similar to that found in other two-tryptophan cellulose-binding modules, such as CBM2a derivatives (11Nagy T. Simpson P.J. Williamson M.P. Hazlewood G.P. Gilbert H.J. Orosz L. FEBS Lett. 1998; 429: 312-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 12Din N. Forsythe I.J. Burntnick L.D. Gilkes N.R. Miller Jr., R.C. Warren R.A.J. Kilburn D.G. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 11: 747-755Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Resolution of the structure of the R262G mutant by NMR supports the hypothesis that the change in ligand specificity can be attributed to a reorientation of Trp-259 such that it is in a planar orientation with the other surface tryptophan, Trp-291. Proteins were amplified using polymerase chain reaction and produced as glutathioneS-transferase (GST) fusion proteins (16Simpson P.J. Bolam D.N. Cooper A. Ciruela A. Hazlewood G.P. Gilbert H.J.

To construct the His10-tagged protein, the region of the CfXyn11A gene encoding CBM2b-1 (19Millward-Sadler S.J. Poole D.M. Henrissat B. Hazlewood G.P. Clarke J.H. Gilbert H.J. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 11: 375-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) was amplified using polymerase chain reaction with primers that contained NdeI and BamHI restriction sites. Protein expression inEscherichia coli BL21 (DE3):pLysS was induced by addition of isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside, and proteins were purified by immobilized metal affinity chromatography, as described previously (4Bolam D.N. Ciruela A. McQueen-Mason S. Simpson P.J. Williamson M.P. Rixon J.E. Boraston A. Hazlewood G.P. Gilbert H.J. Biochem. J. 1998; 331: 775-781Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). To produce 15N-labeled protein, E. coli was grown in minimal medium containing (15NH4)2SO4 as sole nitrogen source to mid-exponential phase before inducing expression of the fusion protein with isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 6 h. Non-denaturing gel electrophoresis was carried out using 0.1% soluble oat spelt xylan (Sigma) as the ligand (16Simpson P.J. Bolam D.N. Cooper A. Ciruela A. Hazlewood G.P. Gilbert H.J. Williamson M.P. Structure. 1999; 7: 853-864Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). For qualitative evaluation of cellulose binding capacity, 100 μg of protein was incubated with bacterial microcrystalline cellulose (BMCC; 2 mg) or Avicel (10 mg) in a final volume of 200 μl. After 1 h on ice with gentle mixing the cellulose was washed once with 0.5 ml of 50 mm sodium phosphate pH 7.0, after which the bound protein was eluted by boiling for 10 min in 50 μl of 10% (w/v) SDS, and 20 μl was subjected to SDS-PAGE. Binding isotherms were performed on ice in 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, at protein concentrations ranging from 1–40 μm. BMCC was added to a final concentration of 1 mg/ml, and the reaction was incubated for 1 h. The polysaccharide was centrifuged at 13,000 × g for 1 min, and theA280 of the supernatant was measured to quantify the amount of protein bound to the insoluble ligand. The data were analyzed as described previously (4Bolam D.N. Ciruela A. McQueen-Mason S. Simpson P.J. Williamson M.P. Rixon J.E. Boraston A. Hazlewood G.P. Gilbert H.J. Biochem. J. 1998; 331: 775-781Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar) and the N0 andKd values were determined from the regressed isotherm data. At least three separate binding isotherms were carried out for each protein. For one-dimensional NMR titrations, spectra at 30 °C of a 100 μm solution of CBM2b-1-His10 in 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, containing 10%2H2O, were acquired essentially as described previously (4Bolam D.N.

The binding affinity of the protein was measured by following the shift of Trp-259 and Trp-291 NHε signals with increasing concentration of ligand. Fitting of the data was performed with EXCEL v5.0 (Microsoft Corporation). For the two-dimensional heteronuclear single quantum coherence (HSQC) titrations, spectra were recorded after each addition of cellohexaose, using 0, 0.5, 2.0, 8.0, 20, 40, and 95 equivalents of cellohexaose. The chemical shift changes were ordered by the weighted total shift (δN + 1.6 × δH). NMR spectra were acquired at 500, 600, and 800 MHz on Bruker DRX spectrometers using 5-mm probeheads withz gradients. Assignments and structure restraints were obtained from two- and three-dimensional 15N-separated NOESY and TOCSY spectra. Additional restraints were obtained from E.COSY, HNHA, and HNHB experiments. In initial rounds of structure calculation, only unambiguous NOEs and ϕ dihedral restraints were used. In subsequent rounds, further NOE restraints, including ambiguous restraints (20Nilges M. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 245: 645-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar), were added along with sidechain dihedral restraints, stereoassignments, and hydrogen bonding restraints (based on amide proton exchange and temperature dependence (21Baxter N.J. Williamson M.P. J. Biomol. NMR. 1997; 9: 359-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar)). Structures were calculated by hybrid distance geometry/simulated annealing in XPLOR, as described previously (16Simpson P.J. Bolam D.N. Cooper A. Ciruela A. Hazlewood G.P. Gilbert H.J. Williamson M.P. Structure. 1999; 7: 853-864Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The structures had no distance violations greater than 0.25 Å or dihedral violations greater than 1.0°. Previously we showed that wild-type Xyn11A-CBM2b-1 binds to oat spelt xylan with a dissociation constant of 0.41 mm, assuming the ligand binding site comprises six consecutive xylose molecules, and to xylohexaose with a dissociation constant of 0.19 mm (16Simpson P.J. Bolam D.N. Cooper A. Ciruela A. Hazlewood G.P. Gilbert H.J. Williamson M.P. Structure. 1999; 7: 853-864Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Data derived from this study showed that the wild-type CBM2b-1 had no measurable affinity for either soluble or insoluble forms of cellulose as judged by NMR titrations using cellohexaose as the soluble ligand, qualitative evaluation of binding using SDS-PAGE to two forms of insoluble cellulose (Avicel (∼50% crystalline cellulose, Ref. 3Tomme P. Warren R.A. Gilkes N.R. Adv. Microbiol. Physiol. 1995; 37: 1-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (629) Google Scholar) and BMCC (∼76% crystalline cellulose, Ref. 3Tomme P. Warren R.A. Gilkes N.R. Adv. Microbiol. Physiol. 1995; 37: 1-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (629) Google Scholar)) and binding isotherms with BMCC (Fig. 3, A(top), C, and D, respectively). The data for Avicel are not shown but are essentially identical to the BMCC results. To evaluate the influence of the R262G mutation on the properties of Xyn11A-CBM2b-1, the capacity of the mutant protein to bind different polysaccharides was assessed. The mutated CBM2b-1, R262G, exhibited no significant affinity for soluble xylan, as judged by non-denaturing gel electrophoresis (Fig. 3 B) or for xylohexaose as evaluated by changes in the NMR spectrum of the protein titrated with the oligosaccharide (Fig. 3 A, bottom). In contrast, it exhibited significant affinity for cellohexaose as evidenced by the change in chemical shift of the surface tryptophans when the protein was titrated with the oligosaccharide (Fig. 3 A,bottom). The dissociation constant Kd for cellohexaose was estimated to be 5.0 ± 1.5 mm by NMR. However, this value must be treated with some caution as the titration did not approach saturation, and higher concentrations of cellohexaose could not be used because of the poor solubility of the sugar. Qualitative analysis of the capacity of R262G to bind to insoluble cellulose using SDS-PAGE gels, showed that the majority of the mutant protein bound to cellulose, with only a relatively small amount retained in the unbound fraction (Fig. 3 C). Binding isotherms using BMCC as the ligand (Fig. 3 D) revealed that R262G bound reasonably tightly, with an estimated Kdof 17 μm (Table I). The affinity was clearly significantly higher than the nonspecific binding that occurred between BMCC and the wild-type CBM2b or GST alone. These data also indicate that R262G binds considerably more tightly to insoluble cellulose than to cellohexaose. The weaker binding to cellohexaose compared with BMCC is typical of CBMs that interact with crystalline cellulose and has been ascribed to the loss of conformational entropy of the flexible oligosaccharide chain on binding to the protein, which does not occur for the more conformationally constrained polysaccharide chains in crystalline cellulose (22Tomme P. Creagh A.L. Kilburn D.G. Haynes C.A. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 13885-13894Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 23Creagh A.L. Ong E. Jervis E. Kilburn D.G. Haynes C.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 12229-12234Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). These data therefore indicate that the mechanism of binding of R262G to crystalline cellulose is similar to that of Family 2a proteins.Table IBinding data for CBM proteins against bacterial microcrystalline celluloseProteinKdN0 1-aN0 is the number of μmol of protein bound per gram of BMCC at saturation.μmμmol/g celluloseCBM2b WTNA 1-bNo significant affinity above GST (control).CBM2b R262G17 (±10)8.8 (±1.9)CBM2a WT0.5 1-cData published previously (11).15.0 1-cData published previously (11).CBM2a W66A14.0 1-cData published previously (11).15.0 1-dIn Ref. 11 the N0 for W66A was assumed to be the same as wild-type CBM2a.1-a N0 is the number of μmol of protein bound per gram of BMCC at saturation.1-b No significant affinity above GST (control).1-c Data published previously (11Nagy T.

However, Family 2a CBMs have three exposed tryptophan residues, all of which are involved in stacking interactions with ligand (12Din N. Forsythe I.J. Burntnick L.D. Gilkes N.R. Miller Jr., R.C. Warren R.A.J. Kilburn D.G. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 11: 747-755Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 24Bray M.R. Johnson P.E. Gilkes N.R. McIntosh L.P. Kilburn D.G. Warren R.A.J. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 2311-2318Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Replacement of any one of these tryptophans by alanine typically gives proteins with affinities for BMCC 17–50 times weaker than wild type (11Nagy T. Simpson P.J. Williamson M.P. Hazlewood G.P. Gilbert H.J. Orosz L. FEBS Lett. 1998; 429: 312-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 12Din N. Forsythe I.J. Burntnick L.D. Gilkes N.R. Miller Jr., R.C. Warren R.A.J. Kilburn D.G. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 11: 747-755Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). The affinity of R262G was therefore compared with that of the W66A mutant ofPseudomonas fluorescens Xyn10A-CBM2a, which lacks the tryptophan that is present in Family 2a but not in Family 2b proteins (Ref. 11Nagy T. Simpson P.J. Williamson M.P. Hazlewood G.P. Gilbert H.J. Orosz L. FEBS Lett. 1998; 429: 312-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, Trp-66 is in the insertion after β-strand 6 in Fig. 1). The results (Fig. 3 D) are given in Table I and show that the mutated CBM2b, R262G, has an affinity for insoluble cellulose that is very similar to that of the equivalent CBM2a mutant (W66A) containing only two surface tryptophans. These data are entirely consistent with the view that residue 262 plays a pivotal role in defining the ligand specificity of Family 2 CBMs. Thus, replacing the bulky sidechain of Arg-262 with an amino acid with no sidechain changes the ligand specificity of the protein from xylan to cellulose. The structure of the R262G mutant of Cf Xyn11A-CBM2b-1 has been determined using standard two- and three-dimensional NMR methods on 15N-labeled and -unlabeled protein (Fig. 4). Structural statistics are given in Table II. The restraints set consisted of 1065 internuclear distances (including 26 pairs of hydrogen bond restraints) and 99 dihedral angles covering residues 247–333. The resulting structural ensemble is of high quality, with good precision. In particular, the heavy atom precision is better than 1.0 Å for all residues on the ligand-binding face (Fig. 4,right-facing face). On average, one amino acid per structure was found in the generously allowed region of the Ramachandran map (25Laskowski R.A. Rullmann J.A.C. MacArthur M.W. Kaptein R. Thornton J.M. J. Biomol. NMR. 1996; 8: 477-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (4474) Google Scholar). This usually corresponds to Ser-298, which is within an unstructured loop. Asn-292 and Asn-320 both have positive backbone ϕ angles.Table IIStructural statistics for R262G〈XBDM〉 2-aMean and standard deviation for the 33 lowest total XPLOR energy structures from a set of 50.

Open table in a new tab The conformation of the sidechain of Trp-259 was studied carefully because of its importance. The NMR data demonstrate unambiguously that it adopts a unique conformation in which the ring is parallel to the surface of the protein. Measurement of3 Jαβ and3 JNβ coupling constants indicates that the χ1 dihedral angle is close to +60°, whereas the large number of NOEs from both edges of the ring to protons on the surface of the protein (for example, Trp-259 HNε to Thr-316 Meγ and Met-318 Meε, and Trp-259 HCε3 to Ala-263 Hα and Glu-258 HN) indicate that the ring is lying flat against the protein surface. Both tryptophan residues implicated in ligand binding are therefore well exposed on the surface of the protein, and their planar orientation is suitable for binding to cellulose. In addition, there are a number of other amino acids well placed to interact with the polysaccharide ligand, as discussed below. Changes in NMR chemical shift between wild type and R262G (Fig. 5 A) show that the structure of the protein has been perturbed around the site of mutation and in the adjoining β-sheets β7 and β4. There are no other significant structural changes, as can be seen from the structural overlays in Fig. 5 B. NOE, coupling constant, and chemical shift data unambiguously demonstrate that Trp-259 has rotated through approximately 90°, to lie flat against the protein surface. Thus for example in R262G, as noted above, Trp-259 has a number of long range NOE enhancements from both edges of the ring, consistent with the geometry shown in Fig. 4, whereas in the wild type, it only has NOE enhancements involving one face of the ring. The three-bond scalar couplings 3 Jαβ and3 JNβ show that the sidechain χ1 angle has changed from −60° in the wild type to +60° in R262G. Finally, it is very striking that a number of residues have very different chemical shifts in the two proteins, consistent with the proximity of Trp-259. In particular, in Gly-262 itself, the two CαH protons have chemical shift values 1.21 ppm apart, consistent with the close proximity of an aromatic ring (that of Trp-259) to the higher field of the two protons. In the wild type, the proximity of the Trp-259 ring to Glu-257 shifts its Hα to 3.74 ppm and its Hβ3 to 0.94 ppm, values that are very different from their random coil positions. In the mutant, these protons are at 4.29 and 2.24 ppm respectively, very close to their random coil values and in agreement with the Trp-259 ring having moved away from Glu-257. Fig. 5 B shows the positions of Trp-259 in wild-type and mutant protein, as well as the position of Arg-262 in the wild-type CBM, from which it can be seen that the initial hypothesis is confirmed. Thus, the replacement of Arg-262 by glycine allows Trp-259 to sit flat against the protein surface, in a conformation almost parallel to that of the other surface tryptophan, Trp-291. The binding site of R262G for cellohexaose was determined by NMR spectroscopy. Cellohexaose was titrated into R262G, and changes in chemical shift were followed by two-dimensional 15N-1H HSQC spectra, using established methodology (16Simpson P.J. Bolam D.N. Cooper A. Ciruela A. Hazlewood G.P. Gilbert H.J. Williamson M.P. Structure. 1999; 7: 853-864Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Several backbone and sidechain resonances underwent large chemical shift changes on titration, as shown in Fig. 6. These shift changes cluster into a well defined area on the surface of the protein, which includes the tryptophan residues expected to be involved in the binding interaction and can therefore confidently be taken as the binding site. The chemical shift changes also indicate that the orientation of Trp-259 is unaltered on binding. The chemical shift changes seen on addition of cellohexaose to R262G are almost identical to those seen on titration of xylohexaose into the wild-type protein (16Simpson P.J. Bolam D.N. Cooper A. Ciruela A. Hazlewood G.P. Gilbert H.J. Williamson M.P. Structure. 1999; 7: 853-864Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), indicating that the binding interactions are similar in the two cases with the obvious exception of the orientation of Trp-259. This includes marked changes to Asn-292 and Asn-264 sidechains, suggesting that they are involved in hydrogen bonding interactions in both cases. There are no new residues with large chemical shift changes, as expected from our hypothesis that binding specificity arises largely from aromatic stacking interactions and not from hydrogen bonds. The most striking difference in chemical shift changes is in the sidechain amide group of Gln-288. These signals shift markedly in the wild type/xylohexaose interaction (2.63 ppm in15N shift, the largest 15N chemical shift change on binding by a factor of more than 2), but change by less than 0.02 ppm in the R262G/cellohexaose titration. From inspection of the models of the complexes (Fig. 6 and Fig. 7 of Ref. 16Simpson P.J. Bolam D.N. Cooper A. Ciruela A. Hazlewood G.P. Gilbert H.J. Williamson M.P. Structure. 1999; 7: 853-864Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), it is apparent that Gln-288 can hydrogen bond to a sugar hydroxyl in the complex with xylohexaose because the twisted structure of xylohexaose orients the sugar ring in the direction of Gln-288 but that the distance from Gln-288 to the sugar is too large in the cellohexaose complex to permit hydrogen bonding. The model of the complex shown in Fig. 6 therefore provides a ready explanation of the NMR results. The ligand specificity of CBM2 has been shown to be determined largely by a single amino acid, which controls the orientation of one of the tryptophan residues that interacts with the saccharide ligand. When the tryptophans are coplanar, the CBM recognizes the planar chains of cellulose, whereas when they are twisted into a near perpendicular arrangement, the protein recognizes the helical structure of xylan. Thus, in this family of CBMs, ligand specificity is determined largely by recognition of the three-dimensional shape of the polysaccharide ligand, rather than by specific hydrogen bonding patterns, as is typically seen in proteins that recognize monosaccharides (26Quiocho F.A. Pure Appl. Chem. 1989; 61: 1293-1306Crossref Scopus (343) Google Scholar, 27Lemieux R.U. Chem. Soc. Rev. 1989; 18: 347-374Crossref Google Scholar)."
https://openalex.org/W2009104073,"The subcellular distribution of Tor1p and Tor2p, two phosphatidylinositol kinase homologs and targets of the immunosuppressive drug rapamycin in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, was analyzed. We found that Tor protein is peripherally associated with membranes. Subcellular fractionation and immunofluorescence studies showed that Tor1p and Tor2p associate with the plasma membrane and a second fraction that is distinct from Golgi, vacuoles, mitochondria, and nucleus and may represent vesicular structures. Pulse-chase experiments showed that association of Tor protein with plasma membrane and the second compartment is fast, does not appear to involve components of endocytic, secretory, or Golgi to vacuole transport pathways, and is not affected by the immunosuppressive drug rapamycin. Deletion analysis reveals that two domains within Tor2p independently mediate localization to both compartments. These domains are composed of HEAT repeats that are thought to act as protein-protein interaction surfaces. Our studies therefore place Tor proteins at the site of action of their known downstream effectors and suggest that they may be part of a multiprotein complex. The subcellular distribution of Tor1p and Tor2p, two phosphatidylinositol kinase homologs and targets of the immunosuppressive drug rapamycin in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, was analyzed. We found that Tor protein is peripherally associated with membranes. Subcellular fractionation and immunofluorescence studies showed that Tor1p and Tor2p associate with the plasma membrane and a second fraction that is distinct from Golgi, vacuoles, mitochondria, and nucleus and may represent vesicular structures. Pulse-chase experiments showed that association of Tor protein with plasma membrane and the second compartment is fast, does not appear to involve components of endocytic, secretory, or Golgi to vacuole transport pathways, and is not affected by the immunosuppressive drug rapamycin. Deletion analysis reveals that two domains within Tor2p independently mediate localization to both compartments. These domains are composed of HEAT repeats that are thought to act as protein-protein interaction surfaces. Our studies therefore place Tor proteins at the site of action of their known downstream effectors and suggest that they may be part of a multiprotein complex.

Tor1p and Tor2p were originally identified by dominant mutations that confer resistance to the immunosuppressive drug rapamycin, and were later shown to be the physical targets of the FKBP12-rapamycin complex (3Cafferkey R.

Cell. 1994; 78: 35-43Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1221) Google Scholar). Tor1p and Tor2p are highly homologous and members of the phosphatidylinositol kinase-related kinase family (10Keith C.T. Schreiber S.L. Science. 1995; 270: 50-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar). Phosphatidylinositol kinase-related kinases despite their homology to phosphatidylinositol 3- and 4-kinases are thought to function as protein kinases (11Hunter T. Cell. 1995; 83: 1-4Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). Tor2p is an essential protein that regulates cell growth in two ways. First, it acts redundantly with Tor1p in a nutrient-sensing signaling cascade that is required for translation initiation and G1progression. This function is inhibited by rapamycin (1Dennis P.B. Fumagalli S. Thomas G. Curr. Opin. Genet. & Dev. 1999; 9: 49-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar, 2Thomas G. Hall M.N. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 782-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar). Second, Tor2p is also required for cell cycle-dependent reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton (12Schmidt A. Kunz J. Hall M.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 13780-13785Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar, 13Schmidt A. Bickle M. Beck T. Hall M.N. Cell. 1997; 88: 531-542Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). This function is unique to Tor2p, also essential, and is not sensitive to rapamycin. Accordingly, yeast cells lacking Tor1p and Tor2p activity or cells treated with rapamycin exhibit a dramatic reduction in translation initiation, and show all characteristics of nutrient-starved cells, including arrest in the early G1 phase of the cell cycle, accumulation of the storage carbohydrate glycogen, degradation of amino acid transporters, transcriptional and morphological changes, down-regulation of ribosome biogenesis, and autophagy (14Noda T.

Cell. 1999; 10: 987-1000Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). Loss of Tor2p function alone, on the other hand, leads to arrest throughout the cell cycle and depolarization of the actin cytoskeleton (12Schmidt A. Kunz J. Hall M.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The Tor signaling pathway appears to be evolutionarily conserved. The mammalian homolog mTOR, also known as FRAP/RAFT1/RAPT1, is highly related and acts in a rapamycin-sensitive signaling pathway that modulates translation initiation in response to mitogens or amino acid availability (2Thomas G.

Fumagalli S. Thomas G. Curr. Opin. Genet. & Dev. 1999; 9: 49-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar, 2Thomas G. Hall M.N. Curr. Opin.

Nature. 1995; 377: 441-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (618) Google Scholar). So far, no direct role of mTOR in the regulation of actin dynamics has been demonstrated. The mechanisms by which Tor coordinately regulates diverse cellular responses to nutrient availability are not precisely understood. Tor kinase activity controls the association of the phosphatase-associated factor Tap42p with type 2A and type 2A-related phosphatases (27Di Como C.J. Arndt K.T. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1904-1916Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar, 28Murata K. Wu J. Brautigan D.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Tap42-mediated inhibition of phosphatase activity in turn prevents nuclear accumulation of nutrient-regulated transcription factors, inhibits degradation of amino acid transporters, and positively regulates translation initiation by modulating the phosphorylation status of downstream effectors (16Schmidt A. Beck T. Koller A. Kunz J. Hall M.N. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6924-6931Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar, 17Hardwick J.S. Kuruvilla F.G. Tong J.K. Shamji A.F. Schreiber S.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Lorenz M.C. Di Como C.J. Heitman J. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 3271-3279Crossref PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar). Tor2p, in addition, regulates actin reorganization via activation of Rom2p, a GTP exchange factor for the small GTPases Rho1p and Rho2p (12Schmidt A. Kunz J. Hall M.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 13780-13785Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar, 13Schmidt A. Bickle M. Beck T. Hall M.N. Cell. 1997; 88: 531-542Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). Furthermore, Mss4p, a phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate 5-kinase, and Plc1p, the yeast homolog of phospholipase C, have been implicated in the Tor signaling pathway suggesting a role for phosphoinositides and their metabolites in Tor function (21Helliwell S.B. Howald I. Barbet N. Hall M.N. Genetics. 1998; 148: 99-112Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 30Alarcon C.M. Heitman J. Cardenas M.E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 2531-2546Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). However, precisely how Tor1p and Tor2p are activated is not known, and no immediate downstream effectors that execute the Tor2p actin cytoskeleton function have been identified. To gain a better understanding of Tor function, we examined the subcellular distribution of Tor1p and Tor2p and characterized domains within Tor2p that mediate localization. Here we show that Tor1p and Tor2p are peripheral membrane proteins that associate with the plasma membrane and a second compartment of high buoyant density. Tor localization to both compartments is likely via a soluble intermediate and, in the case of Tor2p, is independently mediated by multiple regions composed of HEAT repeats. HEAT repeat motifs have previously been implicated in mediating protein-protein interactions suggesting that Tor2p may be part of a membrane-associated protein complex.

To generate anti-peptide Tor2p antiserum, a synthetic peptide containing amino acids 16–29 of Tor2p (H2N-Cys-Ser-Leu-Arg-Gln-Arg-Ala-Glu-Gly-Lys-His-Arg-Thr-Arg-Lys-COOH) was coupled to keyhole limpet hemocyanin byN-maleimidobenzoyl-N-hydrosuccinimide ester cross-linking. The resulting peptide/keyhole limpet hemocyanin conjugate or recombinant His6-Tor1p and -Tor2p proteins were injected subcutaneously into female New Zealand White rabbits (SAVO, Germany). Injection of antigen in incomplete Freud's adjuvant was repeated at least five times, once every 4 weeks. The resulting antisera were tested and titered by Western blot and immunoprecipitation experiments of yeast cell extracts. Unless otherwise indicated, yeast cells were grown at 30 °C in SD medium substituted with the appropriate amino acids and lacking methionine (SD-Met) to an absorbance at 600 nm (A 600) of 0.5. Typically, 10A 600 units of cells were collected by centrifugation and resuspended in 1 ml of SD-Met medium. 120 μCi of Easytag EXPRE35S35S protein labeling mix were added, and cells were incubated for 20 min at 30 °C. A chase period was initiated by the addition of pre-warmed YPD medium (toA 600 of 0.5), and incubation was continued for 30 min or as otherwise stated. The chase was terminated by addition of NaN3 and NaF to a final concentration of 10 mmeach. Cells were centrifuged and washed once in 10 mmNaN3, 10 mm NaF. Cell pellets were then resuspended in 15 ml of spheroplast I buffer (25 mmAMP-PIPES, pH 6.8, 0.6 m sorbitol, 140 mmcysteamine HCl, 5 mm EDTA, 10 mmNaN3, 10 mm NaF), incubated at room temperature for 10 min, collected by centrifugation, and converted to spheroplasts by lyticase digestion in spheroplast II buffer (25 mmAMP-PIPES, pH 6.8, 1.2 m sorbitol, 140 mmcysteamine HCl, 5 mm EDTA, 10 mmNaN3, 10 mm NaF) during a 60-min incubation at 30 °C. Spheroplasts were harvested by centrifugation at 500 ×g at 4 °C, resuspended in ice-cold lysis buffer (0.8m sorbitol, 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 50 mm KOAc, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), and homogenized by pulling 10 times through a 23-gauge syringe. Unbroken cells were removed by centrifugation at 500 × g at 4 °C for 10 min. To determine the nature of association of Tor proteins with the high speed 100,000 × g (P100) fraction, aliquots corresponding to 10 A 600 of the cleared lysate were adjusted to 1 m NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1 m NaCl + 1% Triton X-100, 0.1 mNaCO3, pH 11.0, 5 m urea, 1 mhydroxylamine, pH 8.0, or left untreated. After incubation on ice for 10 min, the samples were subjected to a 100,000 × gspin for 45 min at 4 °C. P13, P100, and PM fractions were directly resuspended in immunoprecipitation boiling buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 1% SDS), whereas proteins present in the S100 supernatant fractions or in sucrose gradient fractions were first precipitated with trichloroacetic acid at a final concentration of 6%. Proteins were denatured by heating to 65 °C for 10 min and subjected to immunoprecipitation in 10 ml of TNET (1% Triton X-100, 100 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA). Fractions were first precleared by incubation with Sepharose CL-4B (Sigma), and then antiserum and protein A-Sepharose CL4B were added, and immunoprecipitations were incubated at 4 °C for 6 h to overnight with shaking. Tor1p and Tor2p were immunoprecipitated using the anti-Tor1p C-terminal antiserum and the anti-peptide Tor2p antiserum, respectively, except for the analysis of N-terminally truncated Tor2p mutants. In this case, the anti-Tor2p C-terminal antiserum was used. Antisera other than the anti-Tor1p or anti-Tor2p antisera were used according to personal recommendations to ensure quantitative immunoprecipitation of a given antigen. Immune complexes were recovered by centrifugation and washed five times with TNET before SDS-PAGE sample buffer was added. Samples were heated to 65 °C for 5 min to dissociate the immune complex. Immunoprecipitates were resolved by SDS-PAGE and analyzed and quantitated on a PhosphorImager using ImageQuant version 3.2 software (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). Western blot analysis was performed using the ECL system and goat anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase-conjugated IgG as the secondary antibody (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Western blots were quantitated using densitometric scanning (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). For differential fractionation and sucrose density centrifugation, cell-free extracts corresponding to 100A 600 of 35S-labeled cells were prepared as described above and subjected to sequential centrifugations at 13,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C and at 100,000 × g for 45 min at 4 °C. Aliquots of each fraction were removed for further analysis by immunoprecipitation. The remainder of the P13 and P100 pellet fractions was resuspended in 0.5 ml of 60% sucrose (w/w in 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.2), placed on the bottom of a Beckman ultraclear ultracentrifugation tube (Beckman Instruments, Fullerton, CA), and overlaid with 0.5-ml steps of 54, 50, 46, 42, 38, 34, 30, 26, 22, and 18% sucrose (w/w in 20 mmHEPES, pH 7.2). The gradients were centrifuged for 17 h at 170,000 × g in a TST55.1 rotor at 3 °C. After centrifugation, 0.33-ml fractions were collected manually from the top of the gradient. The pellet fraction was resuspended in the last fraction. The sucrose concentration was determined by measuring the refractive index. For the analysis of Tor2p deletion variants, yeast cells carrying the mutant variants were grown overnight in selective raffinose medium, diluted into galactose medium (3% final concentration), and incubated an additional 4 h at 30 °C. 20 A 600units of cells were 35S-labeled, chased, converted to spheroplasts, and lysed as described above. Cell-free extracts were prepared and separated into P13, P100, and S100 fractions as described above, and the distribution of Tor2 deletion variants was determined by immunoprecipitation and analysis on the PhosphorImager. Aliquots of 40 A 600 units of yeast cells were labeled with Easytag EXPRE35S35S protein labeling mix for 1 min at 30 °C, collected by centrifugation for 2 s in a microcentrifuge, resuspended in 50 ml of pre-warmed YPD medium, and incubated at 30 °C. Cells were harvested after 15, 30, and 60 min after initiating the chase, resuspended in 10 mmNaN3, 10 mm NaF supplemented with cycloheximide (10 μg/ml) to inhibit new protein synthesis, and kept on ice. Cells from the 0-min time point were directly resuspended in 10 mm NaN3, 10 mm NaF containing cycloheximide (10 μg/ml) and kept on ice. Cells from each time point were then converted to spheroplasts, coated with ConA in the presence of cycloheximide, washed, and resuspended in ice-cold lysis buffer essentially as described (32Patton J.L. Lester R.L. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 3101-3108Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Extracts were homogenized by pulling 10 times through a 23-gauge needle. The low speed plasma membrane (PM) fraction, and the high speed P100 and S100 fractions were obtained by sequential centrifugation as described (32Patton J.L. Lester R.L. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 3101-3108Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The extent of cell lysis was determined by analyzing the percent of the cytosolic protein hexokinase that was recovered in the PM and P100 fractions. The amount of radioactivity in the PM, P100, and S100 fractions was expressed as percent of total radioactivity in the lysate after correction for cell lysis. For visualization of HA-Tor1p and HA-Tor2p, yeast cells transformed with plasmid pYDF125 or pAS21 were grown overnight under selective conditions in SRaffinose medium, diluted into YPGal medium to induce expression of the HA fusion proteins, and cells were grown for 4–5 h to early logarithmic phase at 30 °C. This resulted in a 4–5-fold overexpression of the tagged protein compared with endogenous protein as estimated by Western blot analysis of cell extracts. Indirect immunofluorescence on whole fixed yeast cells was performed using standard procedures (18Beck T. Hall M.N. Nature. 1999; 402: 689-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (796) Google Scholar). HA-Tor1p and HA-Tor2p were visualized by anti-HA mouse monoclonal antibody HA.11 followed by FITC-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG. For double labeling, HA-Tor1p and HA-Tor2p were visualized by anti-HA rabbit polyclonal antibodies followed by FITC-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG. Alkaline phosphatase was visualized by incubation with a monoclonal mouse anti-alkaline phosphatase antibody followed by biotinylated secondary antibody in combination with Texas Red-labeled streptavidin. DNA was stained with DAPI. The samples were viewed through a 60× lens using a Zeiss axioplan microscope (Carl Zeiss, Inc., Thornwood, NY). Confocal sections were collected using a laser-scanning confocal microscope consisting of a Bio-Rad MR 1000 scanhead mounted transversely to an inverted Nikon Diaphot 200. The microscope was controlled by the Bio-Rad's Lasersharp 3.0 program, which provided data acquisition and processing. To aid in the molecular analysis of Tor function, we generated antibodies that specifically recognize Tor1p or Tor2p. Tor1p-specific antibodies were raised against the C-terminal kinase domain of Tor1p, whereas the antiserum against Tor2p was raised against a synthetic peptide corresponding to a unique N-terminal sequence of Tor2p. The anti-Tor1p antiserum immunoprecipitated a single polypeptide with an apparent molecular mass of 250 kDa (predicted size, 284 kDa) from35S-labeled wild-type extracts (Fig.1 A, lane 1). The same protein was also isolated from extracts derived from cells harboring ator2 disruption (Fig. 1 A, lane 3) but not from extracts generated from cells that carried a tor1 deletion mutation (Fig. 1 A, lane 2). When TOR1was overexpressed under the control of the GAL1 promoter, up to 5-fold higher levels of the 250-kDa species were recovered (data not shown), whereas no protein was immunoprecipitated with preimmune serum (data not shown). The anti-Tor2p antiserum specifically immunoprecipitated a single protein that migrated at approximately 250 kDa (predicted mass, 285 kDa) from 35S-labeled wild-type cells (Fig. 1 B, lane 1). This protein was also immunoprecipitated from an extract derived from a tor1 disruption strain (Fig. 1 B, lane 2) but not from an extract generated from a tor2 mutant strain (Fig. 1 B, lane 3). A 170-kDa polypeptide was immunoprecipitated from this strain instead, which corresponds in its mass to the predicted truncated Tor2p protein encompassing the N terminus up to the insertion point of the ADE2 disruption marker (Fig. 1 B, lane 3). Overexpression of TOR2on a multicopy plasmid led to the recovery of up to 10-fold stronger signal (data not shown). The 250-kDa species was, however, not recovered when preimmune serum was used or when excess peptide against which the anti-Tor2p antibodies were raised was present during immunoprecipitation (data not shown). Taken together, these results demonstrate that the anti-Tor1p and anti-Tor2p antisera specifically recognize endogenous Tor1p and Tor2p, respectively. As a first step to localize Tor1p and Tor2p, a35S-labeled extract derived from wild-type cells was fractionated into 100,000 × g cytosolic supernatant (S100) and membrane-enriched particulate (P100) fractions. These fractions were probed by immunoprecipitation for the presence of Tor1p and Tor2p. We found that Tor1p and Tor2p mainly partition into the particulate fraction (Fig. 2 and TableII) with only minor amounts (5–10% of either Tor1p or Tor2p) detected in the soluble fraction. Overexpression of Tor1p or Tor2p led to the recovery of higher levels of Tor proteins in the soluble fraction (20–30% in the Tor overproducing cells (TableII) compared with 5–10% in wild-type cells) which could indicate that association of Tor with the particulate fraction is saturable.Table IIAssociation of Tor1p,"
https://openalex.org/W2040478978,"ClC-3 is a highly conserved voltage-gated chloride channel, which together with ClC-4 and ClC-5 belongs to one subfamily of the larger group of ClC chloride channels. Whereas ClC-5 is localized intracellularly, ClC-3 has been reported to be a swelling-activated plasma membrane channel. However, recent studies have shown that native ClC-3 in hepatocytes is primarily intracellular. Therefore, we reexamined the properties of ClC-3 in a mammalian cell expression system and compared them with the properties of endogenous swelling-activated channels. Chinese hamster ovary (CHO)-K1 cells were transiently transfected with rat ClC-3. The resulting chloride currents were Cl− > I− selective, showed extreme outward rectification, and lacked inactivation at positive voltages. In addition, they were insensitive to the chloride channel blockers, 5-nitro-2-(3-phenylpropylamino)-benzoic acid (NPPB) and 4,4′-diisothiocyanostilbene-2,2′-disulfonic acid (DIDS) and were not inhibited by phorbol esters or activated by osmotic swelling. These properties are identical to those of ClC-5 but differ from those previously attributed to ClC-3. In contrast, nontransfected CHO-K1 cells displayed an endogenous swelling-activated chloride current, which was weakly outward rectifying, inactivated at positive voltages, sensitive to NPPB and DIDS, and inhibited by phorbol esters. These properties are identical to those previously attributed to ClC-3. Therefore, we conclude that when expressed in CHO-K1 cells, ClC-3 is an extremely outward rectifying channel with similar properties to ClC-5 and is neither activated by cell swelling nor identical to the endogenous swelling-activated channel.

Chinese hamster ovary 4,4′-diisothiocyanostilbene-2,2′-disulfonic acid 5-nitro-2-(3-phenylpropylamino)benzoic acid green fluorescent protein Chloride channels are widely distributed in eukaryotic cells, and three major superfamilies have been identified (1Begenisich T. Melvin J.E. J. Membr. Biol. 1998; 163: 77-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 2Jentsch T.J. Friedrich T. Schriever A. Yamada H. Pfluegers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 1999; 437: 783-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). In recent years great progress has been made in understanding the ClC family of voltage-gated chloride channels. Mutations in some family members have been proven to cause human diseases, such as Dent's disease (hereditary nephrolithiasis) and myotonia congenita. Nonetheless, the precise function of the majority of the chloride channels remains unclear (3Waldegger S. Jentsch T.J. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2000; 11: 1331-1339PubMed Google Scholar). One important function of chloride channels is to allow the efflux of cell chloride as part of cell volume regulation. However, the identities of the swelling-activated chloride channels involved have not been established (3Waldegger S. Jentsch T.J. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2000; 11: 1331-1339PubMed Google Scholar, 4Strange K. J. Gen. Physiol. 1998; 111: 617-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). This channel activity has aroused attention because it is present in nearly all cells, is critical for cell volume regulation, and may play a role in other physiological and pathophysiological processes, including stabilization of membrane potential, initiation of apoptosis, and epithelial transport (5Lang F. Busch G.L. Ritter M. Völkl H. Waldegger S. Gulbins E. Häussinger D. Physiol. Rev. 1998; 78: 247-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (1585) Google Scholar, 6Strange K. Emma F. Jackson P.S. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: C711-C730Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Accordingly, great efforts have been focused on determining the molecular identity of this channel. Several candidates have been proposed, such as pICln (7Laich A. Gschwentner M. Krick W. Nagl U. Fürst J. Hofer S. Susanna A. Schmarda A. Deetjen P. Burckhardt G. Paulmichl M. Kidney Int. 1997; 51: 477-478Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), P-glycoprotein (8Higgins C.F. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1995; 27: 63-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), and ClC-2 (9Xiong H. Li C. Garami E. Wang Y. Ramjeesingh M. Galley K. Bear C.E. J. Membr. Biol. 1999; 167: 215-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), but in each case further investigation has shown that the proposed channel was not responsible for the observed currents (4Strange K. J. Gen. Physiol. 1998; 111: 617-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 10Vanoye C.G. Altenberg G.A. Reuss L. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1997; 502: 249-258Crossref Scopus (30) Google Scholar). ClC-3 has been proposed to be the swelling-activated chloride channel (11Duan D. Winter C. Cowley S. Hume J.R. Horowitz B. Nature. 1997; 390: 417-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar). Heterologous expression of ClC-3 has been reported by two groups (11Duan D. Winter C. Cowley S. Hume J.R. Horowitz B. Nature. 1997; 390: 417-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar, 12Kawasaki M. Suzuki M. Uchida S. Sasaki S. Marumo F.

Nature. 1997; 390: 417-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar, 12Kawasaki M. Suzuki M. Uchida S. Sasaki S. Marumo F. Neuron. 1995; 14: 1285-1291Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) observed large currents in stably transfected cell lines. However, the properties of the currents reported are markedly different from those of ClC-4 and ClC-5, the two most closely homologous family members (13Friedrich T. Breiderhoff T. Jentsch T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 896-902Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Because endogenous swelling-activated currents are inevitably present in all expression systems and there are no highly selective inhibitors of the volume-activated chloride channel, there is a possibility that the currents attributed to ClC-3 reflect in part the properties of endogenous channel molecules. We recently cloned two isoforms of the ClC-3 channel from rat hepatocytes (14Shimada K. Li X.-H. Xu G.-Y. Nowak D.E. Showalter L.A. Weinman S.A. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: G268-G276Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The long form has the identical amino acid sequence as the mouse ClC-3 and has 98% identity to the human ClC-3. The short form has 99.9% identity to the guinea pig ClC-3. Immunofluorescence and immunoblotting demonstrated that native ClC-3 in hepatocytes was localized both intracellularly and in association with the canalicular membrane (14Shimada K. Li X.-H. Xu G.-Y. Nowak D.E. Showalter L.A. Weinman S.A. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: G268-G276Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the present study, we expressed a FLAG-tagged ClC-3 construct in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO)1-K1 cells, examined its activation by cell swelling, and compared its properties to those of endogenous swelling-activated chloride currents. In contrast to previous studies, we found that the kinetic and pharmacological properties of ClC-3 are nearly identical to those of ClC-4 and ClC-5 (13Friedrich T. Breiderhoff T. Jentsch T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 896-902Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar) but differ markedly from the properties previously reported for ClC-3 (11Duan D. Winter C. Cowley S. Hume J.R. Horowitz B. Nature. 1997; 390: 417-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar, 15Sakamoto H. Kawasaki M. Uchida S. Sasaki S. Marumo F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10210-10216Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the ClC-3 channel is not activated by cell swelling. A full-length ClC-3 transcript (GenBank™ accession number AF142778), corresponding to the short form of rat ClC-3 with a FLAG epitope that was inserted at the 3′ end of the open reading frame, was prepared by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction, ligated into pcDNA3.1+ (Invitrogen), and sequenced using eight sequencing primers by the sequencing facility at the University of Texas Medical Branch as described previously (14Shimada K. Li X.-H. Xu G.-Y. Nowak D.E. Showalter L.A. Weinman S.A. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: G268-G276Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). An additional expression vector consisting of ClC-3 without the FLAG epitope was prepared by introducing a stop codon before the FLAG epitope using the QuickChangeTM site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) according to the manufacturer's protocol and confirmed by sequencing. CHO-K1 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F12 medium and grown on glass coverslips. Cells were transfected at 40–60% confluency with the ClC-3 cDNA using FuGENE™6 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) according to the manufacturer's protocol. To identify the transfectants, a green fluorescent protein construct (pEGFP,CLONTECH) was cotransfected at a ClC-3:GFP ratio of 30:1. Cells expressing GFP fluorescence at 40–70 h were selected for the experiments. In the control experiments, cells were transfected with pEGFP only. Whole cell patch clamp was performed by the methods previously described in detail (14Shimada K. Li X.-H. Xu G.-Y. Nowak D.E. Showalter L.A. Weinman S.A. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: G268-G276Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Meng X.-J. Weinman S.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: C112-C120Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The bath solution contained (in mm) 114 NaCl, 5.4 CsCl, 1 MgSO4, 1.5 CaCl2, 10 HEPES, 10 glucose, pH 7.4, adjusted with NaOH. In some experiments, NaCl was substituted by tetramethylammonium chloride, which did not alter the observed currents. Osmolality was measured with a vapor pressure osmometer (Model 5500, Wescor, Inc., Logan, UT) and adjusted to 300 mosmol/kg by adding sucrose. Hypotonic bath solutions were the same with the exception that the osmolality was reduced to 240 mosmol/kg by omitting sucrose. A pipette solution contained (in mm) 120 CsCl, 3 MgSO4, 1 CaCl2, 11 EGTA, 3 Na2ATP, 10 HEPES, 10 glucose, pH 7.2, using CsOH. Osmolality was adjusted to 290 mosmol/kg with sucrose. For determining anion selectivity, NaCl in the bath solution was substituted with NaI as indicated. GFP-expressing cells were visualized with epifluorescence on a Nikon Diaphot microscope and selected for patching. Whole cell currents were measured for up to 1 h after whole cell formation by sequential ramp voltage protocols from −90 to +90 mV in 200 ms at a frequency of 0.1 Hz. Sequential step protocols of a 2-s duration were performed from −100 to +100 mV in 20-mV steps to determine inactivation kinetics. Series resistance and whole cell capacitance were compensated; only records with a series resistance increase of less than 50% after obtaining the whole cell configuration were included. 4,4′-Diisothiocyanostilbene-2,2′-disulfonic acid (DIDS) was purchased from Sigma, and 5-nitro-2-(3-phenylpropylamino)benzoic acid (NPPB) was from Research Biochemicals International, Natick, MA. These acids were prepared as stock solutions (20 mm) in Me2SO. Phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate was obtained from Sigma and prepared as a 1 mm stock in Me2SO. Stock solutions were diluted directly into the appropriate bath solution, and the cells were exposed to the inhibitors after whole cell formation. Data are presented as mean ± S.E. Comparisons were made by an unpaired t test using SigmaStat software. In this study, we performed whole cell patch clamp to compare ClC-3 and swelling-activated currents. We have previously shown that cotransfection of CHO-K1 cells with ClC-3/FLAG and GFP results in the expression of the ClC-3 protein both in the cytoplasm and at the plasma membrane. The presence of GFP fluorescence accurately identifies those cells that express ClC-3 (14Shimada K. Li X.-H. Xu G.-Y. Nowak D.E. Showalter L.A. Weinman S.A. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: G268-G276Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Fig. 1 demonstrates that nontransfected CHO-K1 cells have a very small linear chloride conductance, but large chloride-selective currents are readily observed after ClC-3 transfection. Transfection of the GFP plasmid alone did not result in detectable chloride currents that were different from the results in untransfected cells. The ClC-3/FLAG currents exhibited the following properties: 1) strong outward rectification and failure to conduct at negative voltages (Fig. 1 A); 2) lack of inactivation after 2 s at positive voltages above 80 mV (Fig.1 B) 2Of the more than 30 cells tested with the protocol, none showed inactivation. This finding differs from swelling-activated chloride currents in CHO-K1 cells and in most other cells, which inactivate under these conditions (6Strange K. Emma F. Jackson P.S. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: C711-C730Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).; 3) insensitivity to the chloride channel blockers DIDS and NPPB even at high concentrations of 300 μm (Fig.1 C) 3Swelling-activated currents are generally sensitive to both inhibitors.; 4) lack of an effect of the activation of protein kinase C by the addition of the phorbol ester, phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate (100 nm), to the bath solution (Fig. 1 D); 5) halide selectivity of the outward currents of Cl− > I−. Because each of the above properties differs from previous reports for ClC-3, we next examined the endogenous swelling-activated chloride currents in nontransfected CHO-K1 cells (17Bond T.D. Valverde M.A. Higgins C.F. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1998; 508: 333-340Crossref Scopus (40) Google Scholar). These results are demonstrated in Fig. 2 and show that the swelling-activated chloride current is larger in magnitude and is only weakly outward rectifying (Fig. 2 A). The current inactivates at positive holding voltages (Fig. 2 B), is sensitive to chloride channel blockers (Fig. 2 C), and is inhibited by the activation of protein kinase C with phorbol ester (Fig. 2 D). It has a halide selectivity of outward currents of I− > Cl−. Each of these properties distinguishes the endogenous currents from those associated with ClC-3.Figure 2Properties of endogenous swelling-activated currents. Swelling-activated currents were induced in nontransfected CHO-K1 cells 6–12 min after bath solution was changed from isotonic (300 mmol/kg) to hypotonic (240 mmol/kg) conditions and examined with the same protocols as in Fig. 1.

Bath osmolality was changed from isotonic 300 mosmol/kg to hypotonic 240 mosmol/kg after the whole cell mode was established. The activation of currents began anywhere from 6–12 min after the solution change and plateaued 3–5 min later. Fig.3 compares the results of osmotic swelling on currents in transfected and nontransfected cells. In both instances, the currents were greatly increased after swelling, but no difference was observed between the two cell types (Fig.3 A). After osmotic swelling, the currents from the ClC-3 transfected cells exhibited inactivation at positive voltages (Fig.3 B). NPPB completely abolished the swelling-induced component of the current. The residual current had almost exactly the same amplitude and rectification as it had before these same cells had undergone swelling (Fig. 3 C). The swollen NPPB-inhibited ClC-3-expressing cells again displayed non-inactivating currents that were identical to those currents before cell swelling (Fig. 3 B). These results were uniformly reproducible and clearly demonstrate that the currents present in the swollen and transfected cells are just the arithmetic sum of ClC-3 currents and endogenous swelling-activated currents. To determine if our results could be accounted for by the presence the FLAG epitope in our ClC-3 construct, we prepared a ClC-3 expression vector without the FLAG. Fig.4 A demonstrates the currents observed. Cells transfected with this construct also displayed strongly outward rectifying currents, which did not conduct in the inward direction, failed to inactivate at strong positive voltages, and were insensitive to NPPB. All of the tested properties were identical to the construct with the C-terminal FLAG epitope. Fig. 4 B compares the halide selectivity of ClC-3 (without the FLAG epitope) to that of the endogenous swelling-activated current. Because the ClC-3 currents are so strongly outward rectifying, it is not possible to determine the reversal potential under these conditions. Nonetheless, the endogenous currents displayed outward current selectivity of I− > Cl−, whereas ClC-3 currents were selective for Cl− > I−. This finding was identical for ClC-3/FLAG construct (data not shown). We have found that ClC-3, when transiently expressed in CHO-K1 cells, produces a characteristic chloride current with properties unlike those seen for endogenous chloride channels. These unique properties are extreme outward rectification, lack of inactivation at positive voltages, insensitivity to NPPB, DIDS, or phorbol esters, and outward currents that are greater with Cl− than I− in the bath solution. In every one of these instances, the properties of ClC-3 appear to be identical to that reported for ClC-5 and ClC-4 (13Friedrich T. Breiderhoff T. Jentsch T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 896-902Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Because ClC-3 shares an 80% amino acid identity with ClC-5, these similar biophysical properties are not unexpected. In a sharp contrast, the endogenous swelling-activated chloride currents in the CHO-K1 cells differ in each of these properties. The previously reported properties of ClC-3 (11Duan D. Winter C. Cowley S. Hume J.R. Horowitz B. Nature. 1997; 390: 417-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar) appear to be nearly identical to the endogenous currents of CHO-K1 cells and differ markedly from the currents we see associated with ClC-3. The activation of endogenous channels is always a possibility in heterologous transfection studies, and it is necessary to consider whether the currents observed in our studies result directly from ion flow through ClC-3 molecules or from the activation of endogenous channels. For two other putative ion channels pICln and P-glycoprotein, the initial reports of channel activity were later shown to result from the protein in question activating endogenous chloride channels (4Strange K. J. Gen. Physiol. 1998; 111: 617-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar,10Vanoye C.G. Altenberg G.A. Reuss L. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1997; 502: 249-258Crossref Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Nonetheless, there are several facts that suggest we are observing the current flow through the expressed channel. First, as detailed above, the ClC-3 currents had very specific biophysical and pharmacological properties. We never observed this channel activity either in untransfected CHO-K1 cells, CHO-K1 cells transfected with GFP alone, or CHO-K1 cells transfected with another membrane protein, such as the apical sodium bile acid cotransporter (18Weinman S.A. Carruth M.W. Dawson P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34691-34695Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). In contrast, the currents associated with pICln and P-glycoprotein can occasionally be seen in untransfected cells and can always be induced by cell swelling in untransfected cells. Second, we have documented that at least some of our expressed proteins are present on the plasma membrane of the transfected cells (17Bond T.D. Valverde M.A. Higgins C.F. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1998; 508: 333-340Crossref Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Third, the properties we observed are identical to the properties of ClC-5 and ClC-4, the two most closely related family members (13Friedrich T. Breiderhoff T. Jentsch T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 896-902Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Taken together, these observations strongly support the conclusion that we have expressed ClC-3 channel activity. Two groups have previously reported the heterologous expression of ClC-3. Duan et al. (11Duan D. Winter C. Cowley S. Hume J.R. Horowitz B. Nature. 1997; 390: 417-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar, 19Duan D. Cowley S. Horowitz B. Hume J.R. J. Gen. Physiol. 1999; 113: 57-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar) described ClC-3 currents in fibroblasts, which were stably and transiently transfected with a guinea pig ClC-3 cDNA construct that was very similar to the short form of rat ClC-3 used in the present study. These currents displayed slight outward rectification, inactivated at positive voltages, and were sensitive to DIDS and phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate. Similar ClC-3 currents were reported by Kawasaki et al. (12Kawasaki M. Suzuki M. Uchida S. Sasaki S. Marumo F. Neuron. 1995; 14: 1285-1291Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 20Kawasaki M. Uchida S. Monkawa T. Miyawaki A. Mikoshiba K. Marumo F. Sasaki S. Neuron. 1994; 12: 597-604Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar) who described rat ClC-3 currents in oocytes (20Kawasaki M. Uchida S. Monkawa T. Miyawaki A. Mikoshiba K. Marumo F. Sasaki S. Neuron. 1994; 12: 597-604Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar) and stably transfected CHO-K1 cells (12Kawasaki M. Suzuki M. Uchida S. Sasaki S. Marumo F. Neuron. 1995; 14: 1285-1291Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Their currents exhibited somewhat different properties in the different expression systems, but they also showed only a weak outward rectification and sensitivity to DIDS as well as phorbol esters that were similar to that reported by Duan et al. (11Duan D. Winter C. Cowley S. Hume J.R. Horowitz B. Nature. 1997; 390: 417-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar). The results of the present study, therefore, do not agree with these previous findings and raise the possibility that endogenous channels may account for some of the results. In support of this conclusion, the single channels reported by Kawasaki et al. (12Kawasaki M. Suzuki M. Uchida S. Sasaki S. Marumo F. Neuron. 1995; 14: 1285-1291Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) show extreme outward rectification in contrast to the weakly rectifying whole cell currents that were observed in those same experiments. Because the properties that were previously attributed to ClC-3 are present in endogenous channels and are very similar to what had once been attributed to pICln and before that P-glycoprotein, the possibility that these results reflect endogenous channel activation needs to be considered. A key question in this field is whether ClC-3 is a swelling-activated chloride channel. Duan et al. (11Duan D. Winter C. Cowley S. Hume J.R. Horowitz B. Nature. 1997; 390: 417-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar) observed that stable ClC-3 transfection of NIH/3T3 fibroblasts produced outward rectifying chloride currents, which could be further increased about 2-fold by cell swelling. In the present study, transiently transfected CHO-K1 cells demonstrated a unique and strong rectifying current that was not further activated by swelling. Furthermore, in our experiments, transfected and nontransfected CHO-K1 cells had nearly identical swelling-activated currents, which were biophysically and pharmacologically similar to the ClC-3-associated currents observed by Duan et al. (11Duan D. Winter C. Cowley S. Hume J.R. Horowitz B. Nature. 1997; 390: 417-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar). There are two possible explanations for these differences. Either ClC-3 has very different properties in the different expression systems or one or both of these studies were examining endogenous channels, which were activated by ClC-3 expression. As explained above, we favor the latter explanation because the ClC-3 currents observed in the present study are dissimilar from endogenous currents and identical to those seen for the close family members ClC-4 and ClC-5. On the other hand, the currents previously attributed to ClC-3 have biophysical and pharmacological properties that are identical to endogenous currents. These currents can be seen spontaneously in multiple different cell types including NIH/3T3 cells (21Gschwentner M. Nagl U.O. Wöll E. Schmarda A. Ritter M. Paulmichl M. Pfluegers Arch. 1995; 430: 464-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) and have a different chloride/iodide selectivity from that of any other described ClC family channel (3Waldegger S. Jentsch T.J. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2000; 11: 1331-1339PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, it is possible that there was some degree of basal activation of the swelling-activated channels in the studies of Duanet al. (11Duan D. Winter C. Cowley S. Hume J.R. Horowitz B. Nature. 1997; 390: 417-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar). The strongest evidence in support of the function of ClC-3 as a swelling-activated channel comes from mutagenesis studies (11Duan D. Winter C. Cowley S. Hume J.R. Horowitz B. Nature. 1997; 390: 417-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar, 19Duan D. Cowley S. Horowitz B. Hume J.R. J. Gen. Physiol. 1999; 113: 57-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar) showing that ClC-3 mutations can result in changes in rectification and phorbol ester sensitivity. Although this evidence appears compelling, it is based exclusively on the analysis of whole cell currents, which could represent the sum of activities of different channel types. Changes in the proportions of active channels could produce apparent changes in rectification, selectivity, and even in phosphorylation dependence of the net whole cell current. The mutagenesis studies would therefore be more definitive if they were replicated in single channels. One of the difficulties in identifying the swelling-activated channel is that the heterologous expression of some proteins can clearly activate an endogenous outward rectifying chloride channel. This has been shown conclusively for pICln, an intracellular protein, as well as for the putative chloride channel ClC-6 (22Buyse G. Voets T. Tytgat J. De Greef C. Droogmans G. Nilius B. Eggermont J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3615-3621Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The possibility that ClC-3 may also play a role in modulating endogenous swelling-activated channel activity is further suggested by the recent study of Wanget al. (23Wang L. Chen L. Jacob T.J. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2000; 524.1: 63-75Crossref Scopus (113) Google Scholar). These authors examined the role of ClC-3 in swelling-activated chloride currents of nonpigmented ciliary epithelial cells using antisense technology. Reduction of the ClC-3 expression did reduce the swelling-activated chloride conductance, but it also delayed activation lag time. In addition, nearly complete elimination of the ClC-3 protein expression only reduced the magnitude of the swelling-activated current by 60%. These authors concluded that although ClC-3 could be a swelling-activated channel in their system, there certainly had to be other channels as well, and ClC-3 also had an ability to regulate the activation of other channels. We have also observed a situation in which ClC-3 might be activating endogenous channels. In our previous studies (14Shimada K. Li X.-H. Xu G.-Y. Nowak D.E. Showalter L.A. Weinman S.A. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: G268-G276Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we had shown that both the long and short forms of ClC-3 produced chloride currents. The short form currents described in the present study are clearly different from swelling-activated currents in these cells. However, the long form-associated currents described previously (14Shimada K. Li X.-H. Xu G.-Y. Nowak D.E. Showalter L.A. Weinman S.A. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: G268-G276Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) were quite similar to the endogenous swelling-activated currents. We have recently determined that unlike the short form, the long form currents are sensitive to NPPB. This finding suggests that the ion pore structure itself may be different in these two situations. Therefore, it is possible that the currents we observed that were associated with the long form of ClC-3 resulted from the activation of endogenous channels. In our particular experimental system, this occurred only with the long form but not the short form of ClC-3. Possibly in other systems, the short form may have channel-activating properties as well. In conclusion, we have transiently expressed ClC-3 derived from rat hepatocytes in CHO-K1 cells. The resulting currents are not activated by cell swelling and are essentially identical to those produced by ClC-4 and ClC-5. Therefore, ClC-3 is not a swelling-activated channel in all cell systems. Because of its localization in hepatocytes (14Shimada K. Li X.-H. Xu G.-Y. Nowak D.E. Showalter L.A. Weinman S.A. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: G268-G276Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and its similarity to ClC-5, we propose that ClC-3 is primarily an intracellular ion channel. The evidence suggests that like ClC-6, ClC-3 may also have the ability to activate endogenous channels under some conditions. This phenomenon may contribute to the difficulty in determining the role of ClC-3 in swelling-activated chloride conductance. We thank Drs. N. Wills, H. Saito, and J. Navarro for assistance and helpful discussions. We also thank Dr. L. Reuss for critical review of a preliminary version of the manuscript."

The molecular mechanism underlying PGF2α-induced 20α-HSD enzyme activity has not yet been explored. In this report we show, using mice lacking PGF2α receptor and pregnant rats, that PGF2α is responsible for the rapid and massive expression of the 20α-HSD gene at the end of pregnancy leading to a decrease in progesterone secretion. We also present evidence that PGF2α enhances 20α-HSD promoter activity. We have determined a region upstream of the −1590 position in the 20α-HSD promoter that confers regulation by PGF2α in ovarian primary cells. This region encompasses a unique transcription factor-binding site with a sequence of a NUR77 response element. Deletion of this motif or overexpression of a NUR77 dominant negative protein caused a complete loss of 20α-HSD promoter activation by PGF2α. NUR77 also transactivated the 20α-HSD promoter in transient transfection experiments in corpus luteum-derived cells (GG-CL). This induction required the NUR77-transactivating domain. We also show that PGF2α induces a very rapid expression of NUR77 that binds to a distal response element located at −1599/−1606 but does not interact with another proximal putative NUR77 response element located downstream in the promoter. A rapid increase in NUR77 mRNA was observed in mice corpora lutea just before parturition at a time when 20α-HSD becomes expressed. This increase in the expression of both genes was not seen in PGF2α receptor knockout mice. By using cyclosporin A and PGF2α treatment, we established that inhibition of NUR77 DNA binding in vivo prevents PGF2α induction of the 20α-HSD gene in the corpus luteum. Taken together, our results demonstrate, for the first time, that PGF2α induces in the corpus luteum the expression of the nuclear orphan receptor and transcription factor, NUR77, which in turn leads to the transcriptional stimulation of 20α-HSD, triggering the decrease in serum progesterone essential for parturition.

The precise timing of both the synthesis and degradation of this steroid hormone is crucial for reproductive success. The expression of enzymes implicated in the synthesis and catabolism of progesterone, therefore, needs to be accurately regulated during the different reproductive states of the animal. In rodents, the corpus luteum, which is the only source of progesterone throughout pregnancy (1Niswender G.D. Nett T.M. Knokil E. Neill J.D. The Physiology of Reproduction. Raven Press, Ltd., New York1994: 781-816Google Scholar), is also able to express the enzyme 20α-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (20α-HSD)1that converts progesterone into a biologically inactive steroid, thus playing a key role in the termination of pregnancy and allowing parturition to occur (2Hashimoto I. Wiest W.G. Endocrinology. 1969; 84: 886-892Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Due to the detrimental effect of 20α-HSD on luteal progesterone secretion, the corpus luteum of pregnancy does not express 20α-HSD until 24 h before parturition (3Wiest W.G. Kidwell W.R. Balogh K.J. Endocrinology. 1968; 82: 844-859Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Our laboratory has previously demonstrated that the rapid appearance of luteal 20α-HSDactivity in the corpus luteum is due to the massive increase in 20α-HSDgene expression and not to activation of an already existent enzyme (4Albarracin C.T. Parmer T.G. Duan W.R. Nelson S.E. Gibori G. Endocrinology. 1994; 134: 2453-2460Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Prostaglandin F2α (PGF2α) administration to pregnant (5Strauss J.F.

Med. 1969; 130: 92-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar) rats increases luteal 20α-HSD activity. However, the molecular mechanism involved in 20α-HSD activation is not known. PGF2α is also known to induce abortion in many species including rodents (5Strauss J.F. Stambaugh R.L. Prostaglandins. 1974; 5: 73-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 10Deis R.P. Nature. 1971; 229: 568Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). This last effect seems to be primarily a luteolytic one since progesterone administration prevents abortion. In rodents the participation of PGF2α in luteolysis and the induction of labor was further demonstrated recently by the finding that mice deficient in the gene for the PGF2α receptor (PGF2α-R) do not show the normal pre-partum drop in progesterone and do not exhibit parturition (11Sugimoto Y. Yamasaki A. Segi E. Tsuboi K. Aze Y. Nishimura T. Oida H. Yhosida N. Tanaka T. Katsuyama M. Hasumoto K. Murata T. Hirata M. Ushikubi F. Negishi M. Ichikawa A. Narumiya S.

However, whether the high levels of progesterone secreted at the end of pregnancy in knockout mice are due to the absence of 20α-HSD activity and whether PGF2α stimulates the activity of an already present enzyme or enhances/induces the expression of 20α-HSDgene are still unknown. To understand the molecular basis of PGF2α regulation of 20α-HSD enzyme activity, we first examined the effect of PGF2α administration in vivo on20α-HSDgene expression and the expression of 20α-HSD mRNA in PGF2α-R knockout mice. To determine whether PGF2α stimulation involves transcriptional activation, we used both primary rat ovarian cells and a corpus luteum-derived cell line (GG-CL) to perform a series of gene transfer studies to examine the mechanisms mediating the effect of PGF2α on 20α-HSD promoter activity. We have shown that PGF2α is responsible for the abrupt luteal expression of 20α-HSD at the end of pregnancy. We have mapped a region located between position −1599 and −1606 containing a NUR77 response element that contributes to PGF2α-mediated activation. We have also provided evidence that PGF2α stimulates the expression of the NUR77 transcription factor, which transactivates the 20α-HSD promoter. In addition, by using an in vivo approach, we have shown that inhibition of NUR77 binding to DNA prevents PGF2α-mediated stimulation of 20α-HSD gene expression.

Pregnant Harlan Sprague-Dawley rats (day 1 = sperm-positive) purchased from Sasco Animal Labs (Madison, WI) were housed at 24 °C with a 14-h light, 10-h dark cycle (lights on 0500–1900 h) and allowed free access to Purina Rat Chow and water. PGF2α receptor knockout mice with a mixed genetic background of 129/Ola and C57BL/6 strains were used (11Sugimoto Y. Yamasaki A. Segi E. Tsuboi K. Aze Y. Nishimura T. Oida H. Yhosida N. Tanaka T. Katsuyama M. Hasumoto K. Murata T. Hirata M. Ushikubi F. Negishi M. Ichikawa A. Narumiya S. Science. 1997; 277: 681-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar, 12Narumiya S. Sugimoto Y. Ushikubi F. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 1193-1225Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). Wild-type and PGF2α receptor knockout mice were maintained at 23 °C under a 12-h light cycle. Virgin females (9–12 weeks of age) housed overnight with males were checked the following morning for vaginal plug. The day the plug was found was counted as day 1 of pregnancy. Animal care and handling conformed to the National Institutes of Health Guidelines for Animal Research. The experimental protocol was approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. 27–28-day-old immature female Harlan Sprague-Dawley rats (Sasco, Madison, WI) were injected with 15 IU of pregnant mare serum gonadotropin intraperitoneally followed by 15 IU of human chorionic gonadotropin intraperitoneally 46 h afterward. Seven hours later ovaries were isolated and incubated sequentially in 6 mm EGTA in DMEM/F-12 and 0.5 m sucrose in DMEM/F-12. Cells were cultured at 37 °C in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/Ham's F-12 (DMEM/F-12, 1:1). After 3 days of culture, the cells were transfected by LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.) with 0.5 μg of 20α-HSD-Luc constructs and 0.5 μg of a control β-galactosidase expression vector (Life Technologies, Inc.) following the manufacturer's protocol. The cells were left overnight and then treated with PGF2α for 12 h. To harvest cells, each well was washed twice with ice-cold PBS. Cells derived from rat luteal cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with l-glutamate, 1 mm nonessential amino acids, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, an additional 0.45% glucose, 1× antibiotics and antimycotics, 10 μg/ml nystatin, and 10% FBS at 33 °C. Trypsinized cells were suspended in OPTI-MEM I (Life Technologies, Inc.) at 1 × 106 cells/0.8 ml and transfected by electroporation with 0.5 μg of 20α-HSD-Luc construct and 0.5 μg of a control β-galactosidase expression vector and a different amount of NUR77 expression plasmid using the gene pulser (Bio-Rad) at a capacitance setting of 975 microfarads and 280 V. The total amount of DNA per well was kept constant by the addition of an empty vector. After each electroporation, cells were pooled and resuspended in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% FBS and plated into 6-well plates at a density of 1 × 106 cells/well. Cells were cultured overnight and then the medium was changed to phenol red-free RPMI 1640 with 1% FBS. Cells were maintained for a maximum of 48 h after electroporation. To harvest cells, each well was washed twice with ice-cold PBS. Passive lysis buffer (100 μl) (Promega) was added into each well, and 20 μl of cell lysate was used to measure both firefly luciferase activity driven by the 20α-HSD promoter. 20 μl of cell lysate was also used to measure β-galactosidase activity using Promega's Luciferase Reporter or β-Galactosidase Assay System, respectively, in a Lumat LB 9507 Luminometer (EG & G Berthold). Relative light units were obtained by dividing the luciferase activity by the β-galactosidase activity. To prepared whole cell extract, one 100-mm plate of GG-CL cells transfected with a NUR77 expression plasmid or empty vector were harvested in PBS and centrifuged for 5 min at 12,000 × g to obtained the pellet. The pellet were resuspended in 150 μl of 10 mmTris-HCl buffer, pH 7.9, containing 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, 400 mm KCl, 1 mm vanadate, and leupeptin, aprotinin, and pepstatin (2 μg/ml). Cells and nuclei were lysed by three rapid freeze-thaw cycles and centrifuged at 12,000 × g, and protein concentration in the supernatant was measured (Bradford method, Pierce). Nuclear extract from corpus luteum of day 19 pregnant rats was obtained as described by Dignam et al. (13Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9164) Google Scholar) with slight modifications. Corpora lutea were homogenized in solution A (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 10 mm KCl, 1.5 mmMgCl2, 0.1 mm EGTA, 0.5 mm PMSF, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol), and the cells were broken by plunging the cells 10–15 times in a Dounce homogenizer. The nuclear pellet was obtained by centrifugation for 30 min at 4 °C in an Eppendorf centrifuge and resuspended in solution B, which was similar to solution A except that it contained 420 mm NaCl and 5% (v/v) glycerol and no KCl. The solution was rocked for 30 min at 4 °C and then centrifuged at 14,000 × g at 4 °C for 20 min. The supernatant containing the nuclear extract was divided into portions and was stored at −80 °C. In vitrotranslated NUR77 was produced with reticulocyte lysate kits purchased from Promega (TNT SP6/T7). The efficiency of protein synthesis was monitored by [35S]methionine labeling of the reaction products, and about 10 ng of in vitro synthesized NUR77 was used. For electrophoretic mobility shift assays, 10 μg of protein extract were incubated with the NUR77-binding sites found in the rat 20α-HSD promoter (distal site, 5′-GCC ATG TGG GTA CTG GAA AAT GAA CAC AGA-3′, or the proximal site, 5′-TAG CCT CTT AAA TGG TCA TTA TAA TTCA CAA-3′) (50,000 cpm, 20 fmol) in 20 μl of EMSA buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.6, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 μmZnCl2, 90 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, NaF 20 mm), plus 2 μg poly(dI-dC) as nonspecific competitor were incubated for 30 min at 22 °C. Competition assays were carried out by including 10-, 50-, or 100-fold molar excess of unlabeled oligonucleotide in the reaction mixture. A 30-mer mutant oligonucleotide 5′-GCC ATG TGG GTA CTG GAcgcT GAA CAC AGA-3′ (lowercase represents NUR77 RE mutations) was also used. For supershift assays, 0.5 or 1 μl of NUR77 antiserum (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) was added to the reaction mixture and incubated for 30 min at 22 °C before the addition of the labeled probe. The DNA protein complexes were separated from the unbound DNA probe by non-denaturing PAGE (4% gel) at 4 °C, in 0.5× Tris borate EDTA buffer (44 mm Tris-HCl, 44 mm boric acid, 12.5 mm EDTA, pH 7.5). Total RNA from frozen rat corpus luteum or mouse ovary was isolated using Tri-Reagent following the manufacturer's instructions. For mRNA analysis by RT-PCR, 1 μg of total RNA was reverse-transcribed at 42 °C using Advantage RT-for-PCR kit (Promega, Madison). The PCR mixture containing specific oligonucleotide primers (20 pmol), [α-32P]dCTP (2 μCi of 3000 Ci/mmol), dNTP (150 μm), ExTaq DNA polymerase (0.8 units), was added to each tube containing 5 μl of reverse transcription product. Each PCR included primer for rat or mouse ribosomal protein L19 mRNA used as internal control. Before proceeding with the semi-quantitative PCR, the conditions were established such that the amplification of the products was in the exponential phase, and the assay was linear with respect to the amount of input RNA. After autoradiography, data were analyzed using a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager and ImageQuant version 3 software (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). For the rat, the 20α-HSD primers used were 5′-TAG GGC TGC CAT CTT AGT ATT CA-3′ and 5′-GAA TGC CAT CTT TAT CTC AAC CA-3′. For the amplification of the NUR77 message the primers used were 5′-TCT GCT CAG GCC TGG TGC TAC-3′ and 5′-GGC ACC AAG TCC TCC AGC TTG-3′ (14Maruyama K. Tsukada T. Bandoh S. Sasaki K. Ohkura N. Yamaguchi K. Cancer Lett. 1995; 96: 117-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). For the rat ribosomal protein L19, the primers used were 5′-GGA CAG AGT CCA AGG GTC CGC TGC AGTC-3′ and 5′-TCC AAG GGT CCG CTG CAG TC-3′. When a co-amplification of NUR77, 20α-HSD, and L19 message was performed the following primers for 20α-HSD were used, 5′-TGT ATC TCT GAG TTC CCA GG-3′ and 5′-ACT CTT CTA GGG AAG AGC AG-3′ (15Miura R. Shiota K. Noda K. Yagi S. Ogawa T. Takahashi M. Biochem. J. 1994; 299: 561-567Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), and the above primer for NUR77 and L19 with a protocol previously described (16Spencer W.E. Christensen M.J. BioTechniques. 1999; 27: 1044-1052Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). For mice, the 20α-HSD primers used were 5′-TCT TCG GTA CTT TCC TGC TGAT-3′ and 5′-CTG GGG GTG AGT TGC TAAG-3′ based on the luteal mouse 20α-HSD sequence (17Ishida M. Chang K.T. Hirabayashi K. Nishihara M. Takahashi M. J. Reprod. Dev. 1999; 45: 321-329Crossref Scopus (21) Google Scholar). For mouse ribosomal protein L19 the primers used were 5′-AGC GCC TCC AGG CCA AGA AGG-3′ and 5′-CCA GGC CGC TAT GTA CAG ACA CGA-3′ based on the sequence found in GenBankTM (accession number AI225402). Total RNA was fractionated by electrophoresis in 1% agarose gels and blotted to nylon membranes. Ethidium bromide staining indicated whether ribosomal RNAs were intact and whether equal amounts of RNA were loaded in each lane and an equal rate of transfer. Full-length of rat 20α-HSD cDNA (18Mao J.F. Duan R.W. Zhong L. Gibori G. Azhar S. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 182-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) or rat NUR77 cDNA (19Davis I.J. Hazel T.G. Lau L.F. Mol. Endocrinol. 1991; 5: 854-859Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) was labeled with [α-32P]dCTP using the random hexamer primer and the Klenow fragment ofEscherichia coli DNA polymerase. Blots were prehybridized overnight at 42 °C in a solution containing 40% formamide, 6× SSC, 5× Denhardt's, 20 mm Na2HPO4, pH 7.0, 0.2% sodium dodecyl sulfate, and 100 μg/ml heterologous DNA. Hybridization was completed in the same solution containing32P-labeled cDNA probe (1 × 106cpm/ml) at 42 °C overnight. Blots were washed and then exposed to Kodak X-AR films (Kodak) with intensifying screen at −80 °C. Ovaries from wild-type or PGF2α receptor knockout mice were homogenized on ice by hand using a Potter-Elvejhem homogenizer in ice-cold lysis buffer (10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0; 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 40 μm PMSF, 0.3 μm aprotinin, and 1 μm leupeptin). This was followed by a 30-min incubation on ice and centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was transferred to new tubes, aliquoted, and stored at −70 °C until the time of electrophoresis. An aliquot of the supernatant was kept for protein measurement using bovine serum albumin as a standard. Samples were denatured by adding sample buffer (62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 10% glycerol, 0.01% bromphenol blue) followed by boiling for 10 min. 30 μg of protein were separated on 10% SDS-PAGE gels in Tris glycine, 0.1% SDS buffer, and transferred to nitrocellulose paper in 25 mm Tris, 192 mmglycine, and 20% methanol buffer at 250 mA for 1.5 h. The blots were incubated for 2 h at room temperature in 5% non-fat dry milk to block unspecific binding. The blots were then washed and incubated with the polyclonal antibody against rat 20α-HSD (20Albarracin C.T. Gibori G. Endocrinology. 1991; 129: 1821-1830Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) (1:4000 dilution), overnight at 4 °C, and then washed and incubated with a secondary antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (1:6000 dilution) for 2 h at room temperature. Protein-antibody complexes were visualized using Western blotting Luminol Reagent following the manufacturer's protocol. The band densities were determined by digital analysis using a Kodak Digital Science DC 120 Zoom Digital Camera and Kodak Digital Science 1D 2.0.2 software (Kodak). Serum progesterone concentrations were measured using a commercially obtained kit (Diagnostic Products Corp., Los Angeles, CA). The sensitivity of the assay was 0.02 ng/ml, and the inter- and intra-assay coefficients of variations were 5 and 6%, respectively. Serum 20α-OH-progesterone was assayed after hexane extraction using a highly specific antiserum kindly provided by Dr. Quadri (Department of Anatomy/Physiology, Kansas State University, Manhattan, KS). The sensitivity of the assay was 0.01 ng/assay tube, and the inter- and intra-assay coefficients of variation were less than 10%. One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA I) followed by the Tukey test was used for the statistical analysis of plasma steroid concentrations, relative mRNA expression, and luciferase activity data using the Prism software (Graph Pad Software, Inc., San Diego, CA). Values were considered statistically significant at p < 0.05. To determine whether PGF2α can induce 20α-HSD gene expression, either PGF2α (400 μg/rat intraperitoneal) or vehicle (saline solution) was administered to rats on day 19 of pregnancy 2 days before this gene becomes expressed in the corpus luteum. Twenty four hours later (day 20 of pregnancy), corpora lutea were dissected from each rat and pooled independently. Total RNA was isolated and subjected to RT-PCR using L19 as an internal control. As expected from previous results (4Albarracin C.T. Parmer T.G. Duan W.R. Nelson S.E. Gibori G. Endocrinology. 1994; 134: 2453-2460Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), no 20α-HSD expression could be detected in the corpus luteum of all vehicle-treated rats (Fig.1 A, left panel, lanes 1, 3, and 5). In contrast, high expression of 20α-HSD mRNA was found in corpora lutea of PGF2α-treated rats (Fig. 1 A, left panel; lanes 2, 4 and6) accompanied by a significant reduction in the circulating levels of progesterone (Fig. 1 A, middle panel) and a rise in the levels of 20α-OH-progesterone (Fig. 1 A, right panel). To examine the time course of PGF2α stimulation, day 19 pregnant rats were injected with PGF2α (400 μg/rat intraperitoneal) and sacrificed 0.5–24 h thereafter. Total RNA was isolated and subjected to Northern blot analysis. The results (Fig.1 B) show that PGF2α treatment induces 20α-HSD gene expression within 2 h, and mRNA levels increased progressively for up to 24 h. To confirm further the stimulatory effect of PGF2α on 20α-HSD expression at the end of pregnancy in rodents, we examined by RT-PCR and Western blot analysis the expression of this gene on days 18–20 of pregnancy in wild-type and PGF2α receptor knockout mice. 20α-HSD mRNA (Fig.2 A) and protein (Fig.2 B) were undetectable on day 18 in corpora lutea of wild-type mice but became abruptly expressed on day 19 and remained elevated on day 20, the day of parturition. In sharp contrast, no 20α-HSD expression could be detected in corpora lutea of PGF2α receptor-deficient mice on any day examined, establishing further the importance of PGF2α in the induction of 20α-HSD at the end of pregnancy. This also provides an explanation as to why progesterone secretion remains elevated and why parturition is prevented in PGF2α receptor knockout mice. Indeed, along with the appearance of 20α-HSD protein in wild-type mice corpora lutea was a rise in the circulating levels of 20αOH-progesterone and a drop in progesterone (Fig. 2 C). PGF2α-R knockout mice did not show these changes. Serum progesterone levels remained elevated (11Sugimoto Y. Yamasaki A. Segi E. Tsuboi K. Aze Y. Nishimura T. Oida H. Yhosida N. Tanaka T. Katsuyama M. Hasumoto K. Murata T. Hirata M. Ushikubi F. Negishi M. Ichikawa A. Narumiya S. Science. 1997; 277: 681-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2 C) and 20α-OH-progesterone level remained low. To investigate further the effect of PGF2α on the expression of 20α-HSD gene, we transfected luteinized granulosa cells with a 2.5-kb 20α-HSD promoter, previously isolated in our laboratory, linked to a luciferase reporter gene (20α-HSD-Luc) (21Zhong L. Ou J. Barkai U. Mao J.F. Gibori G. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1998; 249: 797-803Google Scholar). The cells were also co-transfected with an internal reference plasmid expressing β-galactosidase, allowing the transfection efficiencies to be normalized. PGF2α treatment induced a 4–5-fold increase in the activity of 2.5-kb 20α-HSD-Luc construct (Fig.3 A). Deletion of the −2467 to −1590 5′-fragment completely blunted responsiveness to PGF2α. PGF2α had no effect on the activity of constructs carrying further downstream deletions of the 20α-HSD promoter. These results indicate that a region upstream of −1590 in the promoter confers regulation by PGF2α. Analysis of the −2467/−1590 20α-HSD promoter region revealed the presence of one perfect binding site (ACTGGAAAA) for the transcription factor NUR77 at position −1599 to −1606. Another proximal, less perfect, putative binding site, with a T insertion (−1539) AAATGGTCA (−1531) was found (Fig. 3 B). nur77is an immediate-early gene which is known to play a major role in hormone-induced expression of other steroidogenic enzymes (22Wilson T.E. Mouw A.R. Weaver C.A. Milbrandt J. Parker K.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 861-868Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar, 23Chang S.F. Chung B.C. Mol.

Since the region in the 20α-HSD promoter that confers responsiveness to PGF2α contains a perfect NUR77 RE, we examined whether this transcription factor may mediate the stimulatory effect of PGF2α. To test this possibility we examined first whether the overexpression of NUR77 protein affects the 20α-hsdgene expression in a cell line derived from the rat corpus luteum, named GG-CL cells (25Sugino N. Zilberstein M. Srivastava R.K. Telleria C.M. Nelson S.E. Risk M. Chou J.Y. Gibori G. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 1936-1942Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We have previously demonstrated that the rat 20α-HSD promoter is active in this cell line (21Zhong L. Ou J. Barkai U. Mao J.F. Gibori G. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1998; 249: 797-803Google Scholar). We have also observed that this cell line does not express NUR77 under basal conditions (25Sugino N. Zilberstein M. Srivastava R.K. Telleria C.M. Nelson S.E. Risk M. Chou J.Y. Gibori G. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 1936-1942Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To assess whether NUR77 could affect the endogenous expression of 20α-HSD, we transfected GG-CL cells with either a NUR77 expression plasmid or with a dominant negative NUR77 (DN NUR77), which encodes a NUR77 protein lacking the N-terminal transactivation domain (26Davis I.J. Hazel T.G. Chen R.H. Blenis J. Lau L.F. Mol. Endocrinol. 1993; 7: 953-964Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Controls were transfected with an empty plasmid. As a member of the steroid/thyroid hormone receptor superfamily, NUR77 is composed of a non-conserved N-terminal domain that plays a role in the transcriptional regulation, a highly conserved central zinc finger DNA-binding domain, and a moderately conserved C-terminal “ligand-binding” domain (27Wilson T.E. Fahrner T.J. Johnston M. Milbrandt J. Science. 1991; 252: 1296-1300Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar, 28Hazel T.G. Nathans D. Lau L.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Although certain key risk factors have been identified, the full molecular characterization, let alone the causes and care for this complex disease, will remain a challenge in the century to come. As a complex biological process, the cellular and molecular details of the growth and regression of the vascular lesions of atherosclerosis call for application of the newly developing “genome-wide” techniques of analysis. Gene expression profiling using microarrays is likely to identify many new genes that may contribute to features of the atherosclerotic lesion, including its growth, stability, dissolution, rupture, and, most lethally, induction of occlusive vessel thrombus. Cholesterol-engorged macrophages and their detritus following cell death comprise a major volume of early “fatty streak” plaques as well as the most typical “advanced” lesions of diseased arteries. In most cell types, cholesterol content is tightly controlled by feedback regulation of low density lipoprotein (LDL)1 receptors and biosynthetic enzymes (1Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Science. 1986; 232: 34-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (4332) Google Scholar). However, consistent with their roles as scavenger cells, macrophages contain several receptors that, in addition to facilitating the removal of apoptotic cells and cell debris, also facilitate the loading of oxidatively modified LDL. This process drives the unregulated uptake of cholesterol, resulting in the accumulation of multiple lipid droplets leading to the aptly named “foam cell” phenotype (2Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1983; 52: 223-261Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Numerous studies have described a variety of foam cell responses that would contribute to the growth and rupture of the vessel wall plaques of atherosclerosis. These include the production of multiple growth factors and cytokines, which promote the proliferation and adherence of neighboring cells; chemokines, which can attract further circulating monocytes into the growing plaque; proteins that cause remodeling of the extracellular matrix; and tissue factors, which can trigger thrombosis (3Ross R. Nature. 1993; 362: 801-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (9959) Google Scholar, 4Quinn M.T. Parthasarathy S. Fong L.G. Steinberg D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 84: 2995-2998Crossref Scopus (961) Google Scholar). Thus, cholesterol-loaded macrophages, which occur in abundance in most stages of the atherosclerotic plaque, appear to contribute to the inception of the process, and to its lethal conclusion in plaque rupture and the triggering of the occlusive thrombus. Oxidative modification of LDL is believed to occur most extensively in the sub-endothelial space where circulating antioxidant defenses are less effective. The degree of LDL oxidation affects its interaction with target cells. “Minimally modified” LDL retains the ability to bind the LDL receptor but not the several oxidized LDL (Ox-LDL) or “scavenger” receptors that have been identified, including scavenger receptor types A and B, CD36, CD68/macrosialin, and LOX-1 (5Navab M.

Minimally modified LDL can increase the adherence and penetration of monocytes, stimulate the release of monocyte chemotactic protein 1 (MCP-1) by endothelial cells, and induce scavenger receptor A and CD36 expression in macrophages (11Cushing R.

Conversely, extensively oxidized Ox-LDL becomes a ligand for scavenger receptor A and the other receptors that contribute to foam cell formation by facilitating uptake of lipoprotein particles. Because of technical limitations, most studies of lipoprotein uptake in macrophages use cell culture models. The human monocyte/macrophage cell line THP-1 is considered to represent a more differentiated, committed macrophage cell line than previously available monocytoid lines (14Auwerx J. Experientia (Basel ). 1991; 47: 22-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (655) Google Scholar,15Tsuchiya S. Kobayashi Y. Goto Y. Okumura H. Nakae S. Konno T. Tada K. Cancer Res. 1982; 42: 1530-1536PubMed Google Scholar). PMA-differentiated THP-1 cells were exposed to Ox-LDL for periods ranging from 30 min to 4 days. At each time point, RNA from Ox-LDL and non-exposed cells was labeled and applied to microarrays to assay the relative expression of 9808 human genes in response to the stimulus. 268 genes were significantly affected by Ox-LDL exposure, providing insights into the patterns of transcriptional response and identifying individual genes whose regulation can alter the survival and migration of macrophages and their effects on surrounding tissue and circulating leukocytes. Human THP-1 cells (ATCC 10801) were grown in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% fetal serum (v/v), 0.45% glucose (w/v), 10 mm Hepes, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, 1 × 10−5mβ-mercaptoethanol, penicillin (100 units/ml), and streptomycin (100 μg/ml). For Ox-LDL loading experiments, cells were seeded at a density of 1 × 106/ml in medium containing PMA (Research Biochemical International, Natick, MA) at 1 × 10−7m for 24 h. The medium was then replaced by culture medium with or without 100 μg/ml CuSO4 “fully” oxidized LDL (Intracel, Rockville, MD) according to the method of Hammer et al. (16Hammer A. Kager G. Dohr G. Rabl H. Ghassempur I. Jurgens G. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1995; 15: 704-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Medium was replaced every 2 days during the time of culture. Total RNA extraction was performed by using RNA STAT-60 (Tel-Test, Inc., Friendswood, TX) according to the instructions by the manufacturer. Poly(A)+ RNA was purified using Poly(A)Tract mRNA isolation systems (Promega, Madison, WI) and labeled with Cy3 and Cy5 fluorescent dyes for microarray hybridization on UniGEM-V (Incyte Genomics, Palo Alto, CA) as described elsewhere (17DeRisi J.L. Iyer V.R. Brown P.O. Science. 1997; 24: 680-686Crossref Scopus (3690) Google Scholar). Any given gene was analyzed if at least one of its readings had a signal to background ratio of 2.5 or more, a signal intensity above 250 units for one or both dyes, and a spot size of at least 40% of the spotted area. These criteria assured that the signal level was sufficiently high above background to be reliably read and that the reading was not the result of non-uniform noise on the spotted DNA. Identity of spotted DNA was verified by PCR. A failure in PCR testing resulted in exclusion of the spot measurement. A total of 6805 genes passed these quality control criteria. Of these, 268 showed 2-fold differential expression for at least 1 time point. These 268 genes were selected for the cluster analysis below. An agglomerative cluster analysis was used to identify the typical response patterns and establish the relationships between the different gene expression profiles. Each gene measurement was first normalized by dividing the expression ratios by the maximum value for each time series. Considering that the data represents a time series, we focused on the variation from one time point to the next. To emphasize these changes for clustering, slopes were added to the expression vectors, which were simply computed by taking the expression differences between consecutive time points. The Euclidean distance was used as a similarity measure for the expression responses. The agglomerative algorithm employed constructs a dendrogram similar to the phylogenetic tree familiar to most biologists (18Wen X. Fuhrman S. Michaels G.S. Carr D.B. Smith S. Barker J.L. Somogyi R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 1334-1339Google Scholar, 19Eisen M.B. Spellman P.T. Brown P.O. Botstein D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14863-14868Crossref PubMed Scopus (13160) Google Scholar, 20D'haeseleer, P., Liang, S., and Somogyi, R. (2000)Bioinformatics, in press.Google Scholar). Starting with n clusters each containing a single gene, at each step in the iteration the two closest clusters were merged into a larger cluster. The distance between clusters was defined as the distance between their average expression patterns. Aftern−1 steps all the data points were merged together. The clustering process defines a hierarchical tree. Genes were automatically assigned to a cluster by cutting the tree between the root and each gene branch with a set of 10 lines (“branch levels”) separated by fixed distances. The branch level cut-off forms a cluster. We first “normalized” the tree so that each branch was at the same distance from the root. To preserve the distance between the closest genes, we distorted the tree at the branch furthest from the leaf. The number of branches intersecting at each branch level of the tree equals the number of clusters at that level. Real time, quantitative RT-PCR was performed on ABI Prism Sequence Detection System 5700 (PE Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). A set of primers was designed for each gene using Primer Express (PE Applied Biosystems). DNA sequence was obtained from GenBankTM, and amplicons of 100–200 base pairs with T m between 68 and 85 °C were selected. RT-PCR reactions utilizing 0.1–1 μg of Dnase-treated total RNA were performed under conditions recommended by the manufacturer. A dissociation curve was generated at the end of the PCR cycle to verify that a single product was amplified. A standard curve for each amplicon was obtained using serial dilutions of total RNA prepared from THP-1 cells. Following standard protocols, human THP-1 cells were grown in serum-containing medium and differentiated with PMA for 24 h as described under “Materials and Methods.” At the end of the PMA treatment period, designated as time 0, PMA-containing medium was removed, the cells were cultured either in the presence or absence of Ox-LDL, and RNA was prepared for gene expression profiling from time points ranging from 30 min to 4 days. During this period, cells remained adherent, and Nile red staining showed that Ox-LDL-treated cells had accumulated significant lipid by day 4. PMA is known to induce gene expression changes that last beyond 24 h (21Matikainen S. Hurme M. Int. J. Cancer. 1994; 57: 98-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Indeed, our preliminary experiments have established that comparing RNA from Ox-LDL-treated cells to cells from time 0 revealed many changes that were due to PMA effects and masked specific Ox-LDL changes (data not shown). We thus adopted an experimental design that eliminated PMA-driven gene expression changes by comparing time-matched controls of cells that have all been treated with PMA for identical periods rather than comparing each Ox-LDL treated sample to a “universal” 0 time point reference. RNA from pairs of experimental and control cells were labeled with separate fluorescent dyes and hybridized to UniGEM-V slides containing 9808 human cDNA samples plus 192 control spots. Thus, the resulting data represent the differential gene expression for matched time points of cells exposed to Ox-LDL or not. As described under “Materials and Methods,” 6805 genes passed quality control criteria that were designed to reduce noise in the data. 268 of these genes (4%) were 2-fold-regulated at least at one time point. The UniGEM slide hybridization methodology has been tested by comparing an RNA sample to itself; only ∼0.1% of the genes were greater than 2-fold-regulated. The minimum detectable fold change for differential expression was determined as 1.4, and the calculated coefficient of variation for differential expression was 12–14%. 2H. Yue, B. B. Wang, P. S. Eastman, J. Minor, M. H. Doctolero, R. L. Nuttall, R. Stack, J. W. Becker, J. R. Montgomery, M. Vainer, and R. Johnston, personal communication. Therefore, we assumed that a single measurement at any given time point using a 2-fold regulation cutoff would produce reliable and reproducible data. This assumption was further validated as described below. There are several informative ways to analyze the volume of data generated from these experiments. They range from notation of the most highly regulated genes at any time point to the use of clustering algorithms to evaluate groupings by pattern of transcription, proposed function, or the combination of the two. In general, the number of Ox-LDL-regulated genes increased with successive time points (Fig. 1), and more up-regulated than down-regulated genes were observed at any given time point. No genes were differentially regulated at the 30-min measurement, and only one gene (adipophilin) was seen to be regulated at 2.5 h. These data help validate the procedures and the use of a 2-fold cutoff because they provide evidence that the noise level in the experiments is less than 2-fold. Adipophilin, the only gene up-regulated at 2.5 h, is a known marker for adipocyte differentiation, where it is found in association with lipid droplets (22Brasaemle D.L. Barber T. Wolins N.E. Serrero G. Blanchette-Mackie E.J. Londos C. J. Lipid Res. 1997; 38: 2249-2263Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, it has been detected in atherosclerotic lesions byin situ hybridization (23Wang X. Reape T.J. Li X. Rayner K. Webb C.L. Burnand K.G. Lysko P.G. FEBS Lett. 1999; 462: 145-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Its early induction potentially makes it a good marker of foam cell formation. Whether it merely serves to stabilize intracellular lipid droplets or plays a regulatory role in foam cell activity warrants further investigation. By day 4 there were 189 regulated genes (121 up and 68 down). These observations indicate that Ox-LDL loading of THP-1 cells does not elicit any measurable immediate transcriptional response from the genes investigated and that the cells have not reached a new “steady state” of transcription between 2 and 4 days of exposure, as a number of genes (123) are exclusively regulated at the day 4 measurement.Figure 1Number of regulated genes at each time point. The number of genes that were up-regulated (striped bars) by at least 2-fold or down-regulated (open bars) by at least 2-fold at each time point is shown.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) A list of the 10 most highly up-regulated genes (Table I) shows that eight of these genes are most up-regulated at day 4. This group includes three genes that have previously been shown to be responsive to Ox-LDL loading of macrophages in culture and/or to appear in foam cell-rich regions of plaque tissue: adipophilin, heparin-binding epidermal growth factor-like growth factor (HB-EGF), and thrombomodulin (23Wang X. Reape T.J. Li X. Rayner K. Webb C.L. Burnand K.G. Lysko P.G. FEBS Lett. 1999; 462: 145-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 24Miyagawa J. Higashiyama S. Kawata S. Inui Y. Tamura S.

Immunol. 1996; 156: 2256-2267PubMed Google Scholar). These latter findings help validate the THP-1 cell model and the microarray procedures. Additional verification of the microarray procedure was obtained by selective use of real time, quantitative reverse transcriptase-PCR. Virtually all of the responsive genes thus tested confirmed the microarray results. However, the dynamic range of the PCR technique appeared to be greater, so that the most highly regulated genes by microarray hybridization were more highly up-regulated in the PCR data (i.e. adipophilin, 14.1-versus 29.8-fold; CD73, 6.2- versus 18.5-fold; Down syndrome candidate region 1 (DSCR1), 6.8- versus12-fold)). The other seven most up-regulated genes appear to be novel observations in the foam cell context. They include five known genes (DSCR1, LARC/MIP-3α, CD73/5′-nucleotidase, epithelial membrane protein 1 (EMP-1), and uridine phosphorylase) and two expressed sequence tags (ESTs). The incidence of novel highly up-regulated genes indicates that previously published data of Ox-LDL loading of macrophages only partially describe the most pronounced changes in this process. Three of these 10 genes (thrombomodulin LARC and DSCR1) can play a role in modulating inflammatory response (25Grey S.T. Hancock W.W. J.

Open table in a new tab The right-hand column gives the fold change of mRNA for Ox-LDL-exposed THP-1 cells for the given gene at the time point of maximum up- or down-regulation, and the preceding columns give the ratio for each time point. +, up; −, down. The list of the 10 most down-regulated genes is comprised of known genes, but to our knowledge, none of them have been described in the context of Ox-LDL loading of macrophages or atherosclerosis. Eight of these 10 genes are most highly down-regulated at day 4. Thus, the greatest change for the majority of most up- and down-regulated genes is occurring at this time point, supporting the hypothesis that by day 4 the cells are still in a process of change (extending the analysis to the top 20 most up- and down-regulated genes also supports this trend). Thematically, 4 of these 10 down-regulated genes are promoters of the anti-microbial potential of macrophages (carbonic anhydrase, cytochromeb-245, RNase A2, CD64), whereas 3 others (G0S2 protein, thymidilate synthetase, lamin B1) are involved in cell cycle progression or synthesis of building blocks required during cell division. As will be discussed further below, these down-regulated genes are part of a much larger grouping of genes that fall into the same two thematic categories and exhibit expression changes that suggest that foam cells have reduced proliferative and altered inflammatory potential. For a more global interpretation of the transcriptional changes that occur during Ox-LDL loading of macrophages, the expression data were clustered by an agglomerative hierarchical clustering method (Fig. 2). The use of a clustering algorithm to order this massive amount of data enables systematic and unbiased sorting of gene expression patterns into similarity groups based on predetermined criteria that do not involve absolute magnitude and are completely blinded to gene function, and thus are more objective than “data gazing.” The data were normalized to the maximum expression ratio for each gene. Clusters at different levels of similarity could be generated by parsing the tree at different branch levels. Seven clusters were generated at branch level 5. Together, these clusters describe seven distinct waves of gene expression that are established over the time course of this experiment (Figs. 2 and 3).Figure 3Identification of genes in each cluster.The clusters of gene expression from Fig. 2 are shown separately with the gene names indicated.

https://openalex.org/W1977084918,"We have investigated the functional role of Cl− in the human Na+/Cl−/γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and Na+/glucose cotransporters (GAT1 and SGLT1, respectively) expressed in Xenopus laevis oocytes. Substrate-evoked steady-state inward currents were examined in the presence and absence of external Cl−. Replacement of Cl− by gluconate or 2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acid decreased the apparent affinity of GAT1 and SGLT1 for Na+ and the organic substrate. In the absence of substrate, GAT1 and SGLT1 exhibited charge movements that manifested as pre-steady-state current transients. Removal of Cl− shifted the voltage dependence of charge movements to more negative potentials, with apparent affinity constants (K 0.5) for Cl− of 21 and 115 mm for SGLT1 and GAT1, respectively. The maximum charge moved and the apparent valence were not altered. GAT1 stoichiometry was determined by measuring GABA-evoked currents and the unidirectional influx of 36Cl−,22Na+, or [3H]GABA. Uptake of each GABA molecule was accompanied by inward movement of 2 positive charges, which was entirely accounted for by the influx of Na+ in the presence or absence of Cl−. Thus, the GAT1 stoichiometry was 2Na+:1GABA. However, Cl− was transported by GAT1 because the inward movement of 2 positive charges was accompanied by the influx of one Cl− ion, suggesting unidirectional influx of 2Na+:1Cl−:1GABA per transport cycle. Activation of forward Na+/Cl−/GABA transport evoked 36Cl− efflux and was blocked by the inhibitor SKF 89976A. These data suggest a Cl−/Cl− exchange mechanism during the GAT1 transport cycle. In contrast, Cl− was not transported by SGLT1. Thus, in both GAT1 and SGLT1, Cl− modulates the kinetics of cotransport by altering Na+ affinity, but does not contribute to net charge transported per transport cycle. We conclude that Cl− dependence per se is not a useful criterion to classify Na+ cotransporters.

Loo D.D.F. Turk E. Hirayama B.A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 468-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). This broad group of Na+-driven cotransporters contains several distinct gene families (for reviews, see Refs. 2Nelson N. J. Neurochem. 1998; 71: 1785-1803Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar, 3Pajor A.M. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1999; 61: 663-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 4Palacin M. Estevez R.

However, there are differences in the ionic requirement of the specific transport systems (1Wright E.M. Loo D.D.F. Turk E. Hirayama B.A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 468-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 2Nelson N. J. Neurochem. 1998; 71: 1785-1803Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar,6Lester H.A. Mager S. Quick M.W.

Whereas some require only Na+ to drive transport (e.g. the Na+/glucose cotransporter SGLT1), others, such as the Na+-dependent neurotransmitter transporters (e.g. the Na+/Cl−/GABA1transporter GAT1), show an additional dependence on Cl−. The role played by Cl− in the transport cycle of the Na+/Cl−-dependent transporters is not well understood. The Cl− equilibrium potential in most cells is close to the resting membrane potential, and little free energy would be provided by the Cl− electrochemical potential gradient to drive uphill transport of substrate. Therefore, from a thermodynamic viewpoint, additional coupling of Cl−to the transport of Na+ and substrate does not seem to confer a significant energetic advantage. In an effort to better understand the functional role played by Cl− in GAT1, we have investigated the coupling between Na+, Cl−, and GABA. Although there is no amino acid sequence homology between GAT1 and members of the Na+-driven family of transporters (SGLT family) (5Turk E. Wright E.M. J. Membr. Biol. 1997; 159: 1-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar), they share a number of functional similarities. The best studied members of the SGLT and GAT families are the intestinal Na+/glucose cotransporter SGLT1 and the brain Na+/Cl−/GABA cotransporter GAT1. In both transporters, (i) Na+-coupled substrate transport is electrogenic and voltage-dependent (9Parent L. Supplisson S. Loo D.D.F. Wright E.M. J. Membr. Biol. 1992; 125: 49-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar, 10Mager S. Naeve J. Quick M. Labarca C. Davidson N. Lester H.A. Neuron. 1993; 10: 177-188Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar); (ii) both exhibit capacitive transients in response to step changes in membrane voltage (10Mager S. Naeve J.

Biol. 1997; 155: 175-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar); (iii) the steady-state and transient kinetics of Na+ and substrate transport are similar (9Parent L. Supplisson S. Loo D.D.F.

Physiol. 1999; 114: 429-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar); (v) both behave as low conductance water channels and water transporters (16Loo D.D.F. Hirayama B.A. Meinild A.-K. Chandy G. Zeuthen T. Wright E.M. J. Physiol. ( Lond. ). 1999; 518: 195-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar); and finally, (vi) both can be described by similar ordered, alternating access models (17Parent L. Supplisson S. Loo D.D.F. Wright E.M. J. Membr. Biol. 1992; 125: 63-79PubMed Google Scholar, 18Hilgemann D.W. Lu C.-C. J. Gen. Physiol. 1999; 114: 459-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). This close functional resemblance between GAT1 and SGLT1 prompted us to investigate the effect of Cl− on their kinetics and coupling stoichiometry. Our results show that Cl− is not absolutely required for either Na+/glucose or Na+/GABA transport. However, Cl− interacts with both transporters to modulate the binding of external Na+. Although GAT1 transports Cl− across the membrane in a 2Na+:1Cl−:1GABA stoichiometry, the transported Cl− does not contribute to the net charge translocated across the membrane, and so we propose a Cl−/Cl− exchange mechanism during the transport cycle. SGLT1 does not translocate Cl− across the membrane. Based on the results presented here and those in the literature, we suggest that Cl− dependence per se is not a useful criterion to classify Na+cotransporters. Stage V–VI Xenopus laevis oocytes were injected with 25–50 nl (1 μg/μl) of cRNA encoding human GAT1 (19Lam D.M.-K. Fei J. Zhang X.-Y. Tam A.C.W. Zhu L.-H. Huang F. King S.C. Guo L.-H. Mol.

A. 1989; 86: 5748-5752Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar) or with 50 nl of water (control oocytes) and were maintained in Barth's medium (88 mm NaCl, 1 mmKCl, 0.33 mm Ca(NO3)2, 0.41 mm CaCl2, 0.82 mmMgSO4, 2.4 mm NaHCO3, and 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4) for 3–14 days (11Loo D.D.F.

Zeuthen T. Wright E.M. J. Physiol. ( Lond. ). 1999; 518: 195-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). GAT1 used in this study was polymerase chain reaction-amplified from a human brain library, and sequencing confirmed that it is identical to that previously reported (19Lam D.M.-K. Fei J. Zhang X.-Y. Tam A.C.W. Zhu L.-H. Huang F. King S.C. Guo L.-H. Mol. Brain Res. 1993; 19: 227-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). In the recording chamber, oocytes were normally bathed in Na+ buffer (100 mm NaCl, 2 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, and 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.5). Na+- and Cl−-free solutions were prepared by replacing Na+ with choline and Cl− with gluconate (i.e. gluconate salts of Na+, K+, Mg2+, and Ca2+). Solutions that were both Na+- and Cl−-free contained choline/gluconate and the gluconate salts of K+, Mg2+, and Ca2+. Chloride replacement was also achieved with MES, with no observed difference in transporter function between gluconate and MES replacement. All experiments were performed at 21 ± 1 °C. Transporter kinetics were studied using the 2-electrode voltage-clamp technique (11Loo D.D.F. Hazama A. Supplisson S. Turk E. Wright E.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5767-5771Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). In experiments in which the Cl− concentration was varied, the reference electrode was connected to the experimental oocyte chamber via an agar bridge (3% agar in 3 m KCl). To obtain current-voltage relations, the pulse protocol (pCLAMP, Axon Instruments, Inc., Foster City, CA) consisted of 100-ms (SGLT1) or 400-ms (GAT1) voltage steps from a holding potential of −50 mV to a series of test voltages (V m) from +50 to −150 mV in 20-mV steps. Currents were low pass-filtered at 500 Hz and sampled at 10 kHz (SGLT1) or 2.5 kHz (GAT1). Substrate-induced steady-state cotransporter currents were obtained from the difference between steady-state currents in the absence and presence of substrates (GABA or α-methyl-d-glucopyranoside (α-MDG)). The effects of external substrate concentration ([GABA]o or [α-MDG]o), [Na+]o, and [Cl−]o on the steady-state kinetics were determined by nonlinear curve fitting (using SigmaPlot, SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL) of the substrate-induced currents (I) at each membrane potential (V m) to Equation 1, I=ImaxS·[S] n(K0.5S) n+[S] nEquation 1 where S is the substrate ([GABA]o, [α-MDG]o, [Na+]o, or [Cl−]o),I maxS is the maximal substrate-induced current,K 0.5S is the half-maximal substrate concentration, and n is the Hill coefficient. To obtain the transporter pre-steady-state currents, at everyV m, the total current (I(t)) was fitted to Equation 2,I(t)=I1e−t/τ1+I2e−t/τ2+IssEquation 2 where I 1 is the initial capacitive current with time constant τ1, t is time,I 2 is the initial transporter (GAT1 or SGLT1) transient current with time constant τ2, andI ss is the steady-state current (11Loo D.D.F. Hazama A. Supplisson S. Turk E. Wright E.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5767-5771Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). At eachV m, the total transporter-mediated charge (Q) was obtained by integrating the transporter transient currents. The charge-voltage (Q-V) relations obtained were then fitted to a single Boltzmann equation (Equation 3),Q−QhypQmax=11+ezδF(Vm−V0.5)RTEquation 3 where Q max = Q dep− Q hyp (Q dep andQ hyp are Q at depolarizing and hyperpolarizing limits, respectively), zδ is the effective (or apparent) valence of the movable charge,V 0.5 is the membrane potential at 50% charge transfer, F is Faraday's constant, R is the gas constant, and T is the absolute temperature. The ion/substrate stoichiometry of GAT1 was determined by simultaneous measurement of GABA-induced inward currents and influx of 36Cl−,22Na+, or [3H]GABA under voltage-clamp conditions. The membrane potential was clamped, and after an initial base-line period in Na+ buffer, oocytes that were placed in a chamber (volume of 30 μl) were superfused (160 μl/min) for 0.5–10 min with a buffer containing GABA and36Cl−, 22Na+, or [3H]GABA. The experimental conditions were selected to optimize tracer counts, taking into account the specific activity of the reagents and the kinetics of the transporter (see Fig. 2). At the end of the period, GABA and the isotope were removed from the external medium, and the current was monitored until it returned to the base line. The oocyte was removed from the chamber, washed in ice-cold choline buffer, and solubilized for liquid scintillation counting (21Eskandari S. Loo D.D.F. Dai G. Levy O. Wright E.M. Carrasco N. J.

The total substrate-evoked inward charge (see Fig. 5) was obtained from the time integral of the substrate-evoked current and was correlated with tracer fluxes in the same cells.Figure 5Stoichiometry of GAT1.

Oocytes were incubated in a modified Barth's medium in which the Cl− specific activity was 40 μCi/ml,i.e. 40 mm of the total NaCl was provided from the stock Na36Cl isotope solution (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Oocytes were preincubated in a modified Barth's medium for 24–72 h to maximize the cytoplasmic 36Cl−specific activity. Before each experiment, oocytes were removed from the modified Barth's medium, rinsed, and mounted in the experimental chamber. The chamber was perfused with the NaCl buffer, and GABA (500 μm) with or without SKF 89976A (500 μm) was added to the buffer. For the non-voltage-clamped oocytes (see Fig. 7,A and B), 10–20 GAT1-expressing oocytes were placed in a linear perfusion chamber. The chamber was perfused at 1 ml/min, and the superfusate was collected at 1- or 2-min intervals. After an initial control period of 36Cl−efflux, GABA (500 μm) was added to the superfusate, followed by, in some experiments, SKF 89976A (500 μm). Cl− efflux was assessed by scintillation counting of the superfusate fractions. For the voltage-clamped oocytes (Fig.7 C), after establishment of base-line current, GABA was added to the bathing medium for 10 min, and the GABA-induced inward current was recorded. During this period, the entire superfusate was collected and counted as a single sample. At the end of the experiment, oocytes were rinsed and solubilized to determine the total oocyte tracer content. Cl− efflux is reported as a percentage of total 36Cl− count present in the oocyte at the beginning of the experiment. Total counts at the start of the experiment were determined by adding the efflux counts to the oocyte count at the end of the experiment. The magnitude of Cl−efflux was estimated by assuming an oocyte cytoplasmic volume of ∼500 nl and a cytoplasmic [Cl−] of 33 mm (25Katayama Y. Widdicombe J.H. J. Physiol. ( Lond. ). 1991; 443: 587-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Control oocytes were obtained from the same batch and were treated in exactly the same manner as the GAT1-expressing oocytes. All experiments were repeated with a minimum of three oocytes from three different donor frogs. Unless otherwise noted, all statistics are expressed as S.E. of the fit. We first characterized the kinetics of human GAT1, as they have not been previously reported. The current records from an oocyte expressing human GAT1 in response to step jumps in membrane voltage (V m) from a holding potential of −50 mV to a series of test potentials are shown in Fig.1. In the absence of GABA, after the initial capacitive transient (with time constant τ ≈ 1 ms), there was a slower decay to the steady state (τ ≈ 40–150 ms) (Fig. 1 A). These pre-steady-state, or capacitive, transients were not observed in control oocytes and were blocked by the GAT1-specific inhibitor SKF 899776A (data not shown) (10Mager S. Naeve J. Quick M. Labarca C. Davidson N. Lester H.A. Neuron. 1993; 10: 177-188Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). Addition of GABA (500 μm) to the bathing medium induced an inward steady-state current and abolished the pre-steady-state current (Fig.1 B). The GABA-evoked current, the difference in steady-state current in the presence and absence of GABA (Fig. 1 C), increased with hyperpolarizing membrane voltages and did not saturate at the most negative V m tested (−150 mV). In the depolarizing direction, the GABA-evoked current tended to asymptote toward zero, but current reversal was not observed even at the most positive V m tested (+50 mV). The GABA-evoked inward current depended on the external Na+, Cl−, and GABA concentrations and on the membrane voltage. The dependences of the half-maximal concentrations (K 0.5) for GABA (K 0.5GABA), Na+(K 0.5Na+), and Cl−(K 0.5Cl−) are shown in Fig. 2 (A–F,white bars). The maximal currents (I max) for GABA (I maxGABA), Na+(I maxNa+), and Cl−(I maxCl−) are also shown (Fig. 2, A–F, black bars). The data were obtained at V m = −110 mV, and the reported values are from the fits of the data to Equation 1. To compare data from oocytes exhibiting different levels of GAT1 expression, the maximal currents at −110 mV have been normalized to those obtained at 500 μm GABA in the NaCl buffer ([Na+]o = 100 mm and [Cl−]o = 106 mm), and atV m = −150 mV (see Fig. 1 C). In the NaCl buffer, K 0.5GABA was 14 ± 1 μm. Decreasing either the Na+ or Cl− concentration increasedK 0.5GABA;K 0.5GABA increased to 809 ± 54 μm at 0 Cl−o (Fig.2 A) and to 27 ± 6 μm at 5 mmNa+o (Fig. 2 B). The maximal transport rate for GABA (I maxGABA) was independent of the Cl−concentration (Fig.2 A); however, it decreased with decreasing [Na+]o (Fig. 2 B). At large negative membrane potentials,I maxGABA tended to asymptote toward the same maximal value (data not shown), indicating that the absolute I maxGABA was independent of [Na+]o. The half-maximal concentration for Cl−(K 0.5Cl−) increased from 0.6 ± 0.2 to 3.8 ± 1.6 mm as external GABA was increased from 5 to 500 μm (Fig.2 C).I maxCl− also increased (Fig. 2 C), and this was the case at more negative potentials (data not shown). At 500 μm GABAo, external Na+ (20–100 mm) had little effect onK 0.5Cl− (≈3 mm) (Fig. 2 D).I maxCl−increased from 0.45 ± 0.1 to 0.76 ± 0.1 as [Na+]o was varied from 20 to 100 mm. However, as the membrane potential approached −150 mV, the relativeI max values approached the same value (data not shown), suggesting that the absolute I maxCl− was independent of [Na+]o. GABA exerted a small effect on the apparent affinity for Na+;K 0.5Na+increased marginally from 14 ± 1 to 20 ± 5 mmas [GABA]o was increased 100-fold from 5 to 500 μm (Fig. 2 E). Cl− increased the apparent affinity of GAT1 for Na+;K 0.5Na+decreased from 18 ± 2 to 14 ± 1 mm when [Cl−]o was increased from 20 to 106 mm (Fig. 2 F).I maxNa+increased with increasing [GABA]o, but was independent of [Cl−]o (Fig. 2, E andF). In summary, Na+ and Cl− increased the apparent affinity of GAT1 for GABA. GABA decreased the apparent affinity for Cl−, whereas Na+ had relatively little effect on the apparent affinity of GAT1 for Cl−. GABA had no effect on the apparent affinity for Na+, but Cl− increased the apparent affinity for Na+. The absolute I max values (i.e. I max at hyperpolarizing potentials) were apparently independent of the Na+ and Cl−concentrations and depended on the GABA concentration. All in all, the steady-state and pre-steady-state (see below) kinetics of human GAT1 reported here are similar to those of rat GAT1 reported previously (10Mager S. Naeve J. Quick M. Labarca C.

A. 1998; 95: 7789-7794Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). The dependence of steady-state GABA and glucose transport kinetics on external Cl− is shown in Fig.3 (A–F). In 106 mm Cl−o, the steady-state current-voltage curve of the current induced by GABA (500 μm) (Fig. 3 A) did not show saturation, whereas the current induced by α-MDG (500 μm) (Fig.3 B) tended toward saturation. Both currents were reduced upon removal of external Cl− (gluconate or MES substitution). In GAT1, in the absence of Cl−, there was virtually no GABA-coupled current at V m more positive than ≈0 mV, but as V m was made more negative, the GABA-coupled current increased. At −150 mV, the current was ≈50% of that in the presence of 106 mmCl−o. In contrast, in SGLT1, the reduction in α-MDG-induced current was small and relatively constant at every voltage tested. Cl− had no effect on the maximal transport rates (I max) for GAT1 and SGLT1;I max evaluated at the most negative membrane potentials was the same in the presence and absence of external Cl− (see Fig. 2 A for GAT1; data not shown for SGLT1). Kinetic analyses of GABA- or glucose-evoked currents indicated that there was an increase in the half-maximal concentration (K 0.5) for Na+ and/or the organic substrate with decreasing [Cl−]o (Figs.2 F and 3, C–F). For example, decreasing [Cl−]o from 106 to 20 mm increasedK 0.5Na+ for GAT1 from 14 ± 2 to 20 ± 2 mm (at −110 mV) (Fig. 3 C) and that for SGLT1 from 41 ± 1 to 62 ± 2 mm (at −50 mV) (Fig. 3 D). There was a large effect of Cl− on the affinity of GAT1 for GABA, whereas the effect on the apparent affinity of SGLT1 for α-MDG was small. At −50 mV, K 0.5GABA increased from 11 ± 2 to 104 ± 13 μm, whereas in SGLT1,K 0.5α-MDG increased from 760 ± 20 to 860 ± 30 μm (Fig. 3, Eand F). For both transporters, there was no change in the observed Hill coefficient for Na+ (≈2) or the organic substrate (≈1) in the presence or absence of Cl− (data not shown). In GAT1, the Hill coefficient for Cl− was ≈1. For both GAT1 (as illustrated in Fig. 1 A) and SGLT1, in the absence of the organic substrate, step jumps in membrane voltage elicited pre-steady-state capacitive transients or charge movements (10Mager S. Naeve J. Quick M. Labarca C. Davidson N. Lester H.A. Neuron. 1993; 10: 177-188Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar, 11Loo D.D.F. Hazama A. Supplisson S. Turk E. Wright E.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5767-5771Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Fig. 4 (Aand B) shows the charge-voltage (Q-V) relations in the presence and absence of external Cl−. For both transporters, removal of Cl− from the external medium shifted the V 0.5 (voltage at 50%Q max) toward more negative potentials (Fig. 4,A and B). The shift inV 0.5 (ΔV 0.5) was −18 ± 3 mV for SGLT1 and −76 ± 4 mV for GAT1. The shift in V 0.5 can be used to estimate an apparent affinity of the transporter for external Cl− (Fig. 4,C and D). The apparent affinity for Cl− was 5-fold greater in SGLT1 than in GAT1 (K 0.5 for Cl− was 21 ± 1 mm versus 115 ± 18 mm). Chloride removal had no effect on Q max (Fig. 4,E and F) or the apparent valence of the transporter (z ≈ 1 for both transporters; data not shown). To determine the ion/substrate stoichiometry of GAT1, influxes of 22Na+,36Cl−, and [3H]GABA were measured under voltage-clamp conditions (V m = −100 mV) (Fig. 5 A). At the end of the recording period, the inward charge (Q) and the amount of [3H]GABA, 22Na+, and36Cl− influx were determined. The slope of the inward charge versus 36Cl− influx was 2.0 ± 0.1 charges/Cl− ion (Fig. 5 B). Thus, Cl− is transported by GAT1, with the net inward movement of 2 positive charges coupled to the influx of each Cl− ion. The inward charge per [3H]GABA molecule was 2:1 (slope was 1.9 ± 0.1 charges/GABA molecule) and was the same in the presence and absence of Cl− in the external medium (Fig. 5 C). The one-to-one correlation between the inward charge and 22Na+ uptake indicated that each inward charge was accompanied by the influx of one22Na+ ion (slope was 0.9 ± 0.1 charge/Na+ ion) and independent of the presence or absence of external Cl− (Fig. 5 D). Experiments performed with the membrane potential held at −10, −30, −50, and −70 mV yielded similar results (data not shown). To determine whether Cl− was transported by SGLT1, Na+/α-MDG currents were evoked for 10 min in the presence of 36Cl− (Fig.6 A). There was no difference in 36Cl− uptake (4.3 pmol/min) between control oocytes and SGLT1-expressing oocytes (p > 0.05) (Fig.6 B), indicating that Cl− is not transported by SGLT1. The inward current in these experiments (Fig. 6 A) ranged from 540 to 950 nA, and if one Cl− ion were transported per inward charge, the Cl− influx would be expected to be 340–590 pmol/min, well within the resolution of our experiments. Since the net inward charge is totally accounted for by the influx of Na+, Cl− influx appears not to contribute to the GABA-evoked inward current. One explanation is that there is an exchange of an internal anion for Cl− that is transported into th"

The most important reaction for this class of steroids is the reversible C11 keto/β-hydroxyl conversion between receptor-binding 11β-OH steroids and the nonbinding 11-oxo compounds, carried out by 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenases (11β-HSDs). In this study, we determined the role of glucocorticoid conversion by 11β-HSD in pancreatic islets and its function in the regulation of insulin release. Pancreatic islets isolated from ob/ob mice display type 1 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase activity, i.e. in intact cells the reductive reaction prevails, leading from dehydrocorticosterone to corticosterone. Expression of type 1 11β-HSD mRNA was detected by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction in islets isolated from ob/ob mice and also from human tissue. Incubation of β-cells in the presence of 11-dehydrocorticosterone leads to a dose-dependent inhibition of insulin release, indicating cellular activation of 11-dehydrocorticosterone to the receptor ligand, further confirmed by reporter gene assays.

They increase hepatic glucose production through gluconeogenesis by induction of key enzymes like phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase and glucose-6-phosphatase (1Lowe W.L. Jameson J.L.

Furthermore, they decrease insulin sensitivity in skeletal muscle and adipose tissue. Both GC-induced effects, increased hepatic glucose production and insulin resistance, result in increased plasma insulin levels. However, this is attenuated by a direct inhibitory effect of glucocorticoids on insulin release from pancreatic β-cells as suggested by in vitro and in vivo studies (5Billaudel B. Sutterm B.J.C.

GCs mediate their effects through specific intracellular receptors present in almost all cell types including β-cells. The glucocorticoid receptor belongs to the superfamily of nuclear hormone receptors, which function as ligand-activated transcription factors (14Reichardt H.M. Tronche F. Berger S. Kellendonk C.

Several studies point out that circulating levels of steroid, cellular expression of receptors, and intracellular metabolic GC conversion determine whether GC gain access as active ligands to their receptors (17Monder C. White P.C. Vitam. Horm. 1993; 47: 187-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). In this respect, it has been established that the metabolic biotransformation at the 11β-hydroxy/11-oxo function of glucocorticoid hormones by the enzyme 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (11β-HSD, EC 1.1.1.146) is important in GC physiology and determines cell-specific modulation of glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid effects (17Monder C.

Thus far, two 11β-HSD isozymes (11β-HSD-1 and 11β-HSD-2) have been characterized in detail (17Monder C. White P.C. Vitam.

The type 2 isozyme (11β-HSD-2) functions in vivo and in vitro exclusively as a high affinity (K m ∼10 nm), NAD+-dependent dehydrogenase of adrenal glucocorticoids. It inactivates “active” cortisol to cortisone, thereby “protecting” the mineralocorticoid receptor from occupancy by cortisol (22Mune T. Rogerson F.M. Nikkilä H. Agarwal A.K. White P.C. Nat.

The intention of the present investigation was to evaluate the occurrence of 11β-HSD in Langerhans' islets of the pancreas and, if present, to assess the role of this enzyme in β-cell glucocorticoid physiology and insulin release. ob/ob mice, 10–12 months old and weighing 50–60 g, were kept as described (12Ling Z.C.

Pancreatic tissue was removed and digested with collagenase under continuous shaking in Hanks' balanced salt solution at 37 °C. Islets were collected under stereomicroscopy and incubated in RPMI medium supplemented with glucose. Human pancreatic tissue was obtained through routine surgery. Immediately after resection, islets were prepared by collagenase treatment, and islets were collected under stereomicroscopy. Insulin release from islets was determined by incubating batches of three islets for 60 min at 37 °C in 300 μl of Krebs-bicarbonate buffer (pH 7.4, supplemented with 2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin) under basal (3.3 mm), and stimulatory (8.3 and 16.7 mm) glucose concentrations. Prior to the study of insulin release, islets were cultured in RPMI 1640 with 11 mm glucose in the presence or absence of the 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase inhibitor carbenoxolone (CBX; 0, 0.5, 1.0, and 5.0 μm), followed by a 30-min incubation in Krebs-bicarbonate buffer with 3.3 mmglucose. Insulin release was determined by use of a radioimmunoassay (RIA) (12Ling Z.C. Khan A. Delaunay F. Davani B. Östenson C.G. Gustafsson J.A. Okret S. Landau B.R. Efendic S.

Oxidative and reductive conversions of corticosterone and 11-dehydrocorticosterone (11-DHC), respectively, were analyzed by incubating intact islet preparations in the presence of 100,000 cpm [3H]corticosterone (specific activity 2.2 terabecquerel/mmol) or 100,000 cpm [3H]dehydrocorticosterone. The latter was prepared by oxidation of [3H]corticosterone using recombinant human 11β-HSD-1 (21Voice M. Seckl J.R. Edwards C.R.W. Chapman K.E. Biochem.

In kinetic experiments, islets were incubated at different concentrations of unlabeled steroid, ranging from 10 to 500 nm and further supplemented with tracer steroid. After incubation reaction mixtures were extracted with a 5-fold volume of ethyl acetate after the addition of excess unlabeled corticosterone and 11-DHC (5 μl of 10 mg/ml solution). The organic phase was dried under nitrogen, redissolved in methanol, transferred to silica TLC plates, and steroids were separated using a mobile phase of dichlormethane/acetone (4:1, v/v). Substrates and products were detected by UV illumination (254 nm). Spots detected were cut out and eluted into scintillation fluid, and the fractional conversion into product was determined by LSC. Total RNA from liver and isolated islets was prepared using the RNAzol RNA preparation kit. First-strand cDNA synthesis was performed with random hexanucleotide primer mixtures, total RNA (1.0 μg/10 μl reaction), and 200 units/10 μl Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (MMLV-RT, Life Technologies, Inc.) for 45 min at 40 °C followed by a 5-min denaturation at 95 °C. PCR with thermostable polymerase (Taq + long, Stratagene) was carried out using mouse-specific 11β-HSD-1 (29Oppermann U.C.T. Netter K.J. Maser E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 227: 202-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) (sense, 5′-TTA TGA AAA AAT ACC TCC TCC C; antisense, 5′-CTT TGA TCT CCA GGG CGC ATT C), human-specific 11β-HSD-1 (sense, 5′-ATG CTC CAA GGA AAG AAA GTG ATT GTC ACA GGG GCC; antisense, 5′-CTA CTT GTT TAT GAA TCT GTC CAT ATT, both primers containing a 15-bp 5′ overhang), and GAPDH (sense, 5′-TGA AGG TCG GGT GTC AAC G; antisense, 5′-CAT GTA GGC CAT GAG GTC) primer sets. Denaturation was at 95 °C (1 min), annealing at 52 °C (1 min), with extension at 72 °C (1 min) for a total of 40 cycles. Resulting products (human 11β-HSD-1, 819 bp; mouse 11β-HSD-1, 729 bp; GAPDH, 965 bp) were analyzed on 1% agarose-Tris/borate/EDTA gels and visualized by ethidium bromide staining under UV illumination. Pancreatic islets were isolated by collagenase treatment and dispersed as described above. The cells were resuspended in RPMI 1640 culture medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) containing 11 mm glucose supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 international units/ml penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Cells were grown in 6-well plates, incubated at 37 °C in 5% CO2, and transfected by LipofectAMINE Plus (Life Technologies, Inc.) with 400 ng of a (GRE)-tk-Luc reporter plasmid (30Delaunay F. Liden J. Gustafsson J.A. Okret S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 242: 839-845Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). The following day, fresh medium was added containing either 100 nm 11-DHC or 100 nm corticosterone with or without 5 μm CBX at final concentration. After 16 h, cells were lysed and analyzed for luciferase activity. Each experimental condition was analyzed in triplicate; values represent the mean ± S.D. of 2 experiments. Islets of Langerhans prepared from ob/ob mice display 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase activity (Fig. 1,A and B). In intact cells, using corticosterone and 11-DHC as substrates, low levels of dehydrogenase but high levels of 11-keto reductase activity could be detected (Fig. 1 A), thus presenting features of the type 1 (i.e. liver-type) 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase isozyme. Enzymatic constants for 11-oxo reduction were determined in intact islet preparations. The apparent K m determined was 97.5 ± 24.3 nm, with a Vm ranging from 8.5 to 43 pmol of product formation/25 islets × 12 h, (mean, 24.0) (Fig.1 B), with the variation due to inevitable deviations in islet size and cell number. The enzymatic activation of dehydrocorticosterone to corticosterone by 11β-HSD could be inhibited by the synthetic compound carbenoxolone (Fig. 1 C). Moreover, homogenates from islets, prepared by detergent extraction in buffered 1% Triton X-100, displayed characteristics of type 1 11β-HSD in disrupted tissues; this was detected as elevated NADP+-dependent 11β-OH dehydrogenase activity compared with NADPH-dependent 11-oxo reduction of glucocorticoids (data not shown). In agreement with functional characteristics obtained, 11β-HSD-1 expression in ob/ob pancreatic islets was detected by RT-PCR (Fig. 2 A). An RT-PCR product of a size identical to that from liver was obtained using specific mouse primer sets (29Oppermann U.C.T. Netter K.J. Maser E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 227: 202-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), indicating expression of type 1 11β-HSD in pancreatic islets. The same set of experiments was performed with RNA isolated from human islets (Fig. 2 B). Similarly, a specific product was amplified by PCR using human-specific primer sets, pointing to expression of 11β-HSD-1 in human islet tissue. To assess its physiological function in pancreatic tissue, the role of 11β-HSD in intracellular glucocorticoid activation and the effect on insulin release was evaluated. In a first series of experiments, the role of 11-DHC in insulin release was determined (Fig.3 A). Glucose-dependent insulin release was demonstrated at several glucose concentrations (3.3., 8.3, and 16.7 mm) showing the intact response to glucose stimulation of the islet preparations. The presence of 11-DHC at 50 and 500 nm in the medium inhibited insulin release in a dose-dependent fashion in all experimental settings (e.g. at 6.7 mm glucose from 302 milliunits of insulin/3 islets/h to 60 milliunits insulin/3 islets/h at 500 nm 11-DHC; Fig.3 A), indicating intracellular conversion of the nonbinding receptor ligand 11-DHC to the active compound corticosterone by 11β-HSD. The inhibitory effect of 11-DHC was similar but lower (about 12%) compared with corticosterone, in agreement with the kinetic data obtained. In a second set of experiments, using the 11β-HSD inhibitor compound carbenoxolone, almost complete and dose-dependent reversal of inhibition of insulin release could be achieved (Fig.3 B) at 5 μm inhibitor concentration (94.4versus 39.4% without CBX). These data indicate that 11-oxo reduction of 11-keto glucocorticoids in islets is necessary for the inhibition of insulin release. The 11-DHC-mediated pathway of intracellular signaling indeed proceeds through glucocorticoid receptor activation (Fig. 4). Islets were transfected with a GC-responsive luciferase reporter gene construct and incubated in the presence of 100 nm 11-DHC in the presence or absence of 5 μm CBX. 11-DHC-treated cells showed an increase in the activity of the GC response element reporter gene, whereas coincubation with CBX substantially reduced transcriptional activity. This result suggests that 11-DHC-mediated cellular effects are achieved through metabolic activation to the receptor ligand corticosterone by the enzyme 11β-HSD-1.Figure 4CBX reduces 11-DHC induced transcriptional activity of a GC response element coupled to a reporter gene (luciferase) in ob/ob β-cells. The reporter gene plasmid (GRE)2 tk-Luc (400 ng) was transfected into pancreatic β-cells as described under “Experimental Procedures.” After transfection, cells were stimulated with 100 nm 11-DHC in the presence or absence of 5 μm CBX for 16 h followed by measurement of luciferase activity.

The novel finding was that 11β-HSD-1 is present in pancreatic islets of humans and ob/ob mice as assessed by RT-PCR and plays a key role in GC-mediated inhibition of insulin release. The ob/ob mouse, an animal model of non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, exhibits hyperglycemia, hyperinsulinemia, and obesity. The animals are obese already at 3–4 weeks of age, and a significant difference between lean and obese animals in blood glucose and plasma insulin concentration is observed at 4–5 weeks. Islets of ob/ob mice are often used to study β-cell functions because these islets contain about 90% β-cells. We previously demonstrated that treatment of ob/ob mice with the synthetic GC dexamethasone decreases insulin release (12Ling Z.C. Khan A. Delaunay F. Davani B. Östenson C.G. Gustafsson J.A. Okret S. Landau B.R. Efendic S. Diabetologia. 1998; 41: 634-639Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). These observations were extended by studies using transgenic mice overexpressing the GC receptor in β-cells (12Ling Z.C. Khan A. Delaunay F. Davani B. Östenson C.G. Gustafsson J.A. Okret S. Landau B.R. Efendic S. Diabetologia. 1998; 41: 634-639Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 13Delaunay F. Khan A. Cintra A. Davani B. Ling Z.C. Anderson A. Östenson C.G. Gustafsson J.A. Efendic S. Okret S. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 2094-2098Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar), highlighting the importance of GC signaling in insulin release. In the present study, we investigated the role of 11β-HSD-1 in respect to insulin release from islets of ob/ob mice. For this purpose, we evaluated the inhibitory effect of 11-DHC on insulin release in the presence and absence of the 11β-HSD inhibitor CBX. In the absence of CBX, 11-DHC markedly inhibited insulin release, whereas a reversal of this effect was noted in the presence of CBX, indicating an important role of 11β-HSD-1 in the regulation of insulin release. We extended these novel findings by characterizing 11β-HSD in ob/ob islets and identified 11β-HSD-1 as the islet isozyme. As shown earlier in hepatic or neural tissues (21Voice M. Seckl J.R. Edwards C.R.W. Chapman K.E. Biochem. J. 1996; 317: 621-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 31Leckie C.M. Welberg L.A. Seckl J.R. J. Endocrinol. 1998; 159: 233-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), 11β-HSD-1 functions in close to in vivo models, i.e. in primary culture, continuous cell lines, or transfected intact cells, as a reductase, thereby activating 11-oxo glucocorticoids to the GC receptor binding 11β-hydroxy hormones. However, upon disruption of intact cells, oxidative activity appears, indicating a labile character of the enzyme (17Monder C. White P.C. Vitam. Horm. 1993; 47: 187-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar, 18Stewart P.M. Krozowski Z.S. Vitam. Horm. 1999; 57: 249-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar, 32Lakshmi V. Monder C. Endocrinology. 1988; 123: 2390-2398Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the apparent K m of the reductive activity differs between in vitro (tissue homogenates, recombinant material) and close to in vivo(intact cells) situations by about an order of magnitude. As determinedin vitro, the affinity constant is in the low μm range, but in intact cells it appears to be between 100 and 400 nm as noted in this and other studies (33Ricketts M.L. Shoesmith K.J. Hewison M. Strain A. Eggo M.C. Stewart P.M. J. Endocrinol. 1998; 156: 159-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 34Michael A.E. Evagelatou M. Norgate D.P. Clarke R.J. Antoniw J.W. Stedman B.A. Brennan A. Welsby R. Bujalska I. Stewart P.M. Cooke B.A. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1997; 132: 43-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). These features, in vivo reductive activity and oxidative and reductive activities in disrupted cells, were also observed in our experiments and, along with the RT-PCR data, clearly demonstrate the presence of 11β-HSD-1 in islets from ob/ob mice. It is also apparent that 11β-HSD-1 expression is not restricted to islets from this animal model of obesity. Rather, expression is detected in human islets, as determined in this study, or in further mammalian species, as indicated by the presence of activity in homogenized rat pancreatic tissue (35Marandici A. Monder C. Steroids. 1993; 58: 153-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) and intact rat islets, 2A. Khan and U. Oppermann, unpublished data. pointing to a role similar to that in ob/ob mice. Furthermore, it is now possible on these grounds to explain earlier data obtained from pancreas perfusion studies, demonstrating that cortisone was able to mediate inhibition of insulin release (36Barseghian G. Levine R. Epps P. Endocrinology. 1982; 111: 1648-1651Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The results of this and other studies have several important consequences. First, 11β-HSD-1 expression and a functional role in tissues critically involved in glucose and carbohydrate metabolism and homeostasis (i.e. liver, adipose tissue, pancreatic islets) are now established (25Kotelevtsev J. Holmes M.C. Burchill A. Houston P.M. Schmoll D. Jamieson P. Best R. Brown R. Edwards C.R.W. Seckl J.R. Mullins J.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Biol. 1998; 64: 251-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). In all cases, the tissue-specific effects are related to intracellular reductive activation of 11-oxo glucocorticoids via 11β-HSD-1 to GC receptor ligands, followed by tissue-specific induction or repression of GC controlled genes. This concept implies that circulating cortisone or 11-dehydrocorticosterone, which is not bound to plasma CBG, displays favorable pharmacokinetics and can freely enter the cell, in contrast to cortisol and corticosterone. These are tightly bound to CBG, thus indicating that the level of free 11β-OH-GC is low (17Monder C. White P.C. Vitam. Horm. 1993; 47: 187-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). This clearly points to a novel role of 11-oxo glucocorticoids as prehormones, which can be activated in a tissue-specific manner via 11β-HSD-1 to its receptor ligands. To investigate the importance of this isozyme in vivo, mice were produced with targeted disruption of the 11β-HSD-1 gene (25Kotelevtsev J. Holmes M.C. Burchill A. Houston P.M. Schmoll D. Jamieson P. Best R. Brown R. Edwards C.R.W. Seckl J.R. Mullins J.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 14924-14929Crossref PubMed Scopus (807) Google Scholar). These animals were unable to convert inert 11-DHC to corticosteronein vivo. Despite compensatory adrenal hyperplasia and increased adrenal secretion of corticosterone, homozygous mutants had attenuated activation of the key hepatic gluconeogenic enzymes glucose-6-phosphatase and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase. These 11β-HSD-1 knockout mice were found to resist hyperglycemia provoked by obesity or stress, suggesting that this effect was due to attenuation of gluconeogenesis. This hypothesis is strongly supported by studies in man, demonstrating that carbenoxolone enhances insulin sensitivity and decreases hepatic glucose production (26Walker B. Connacher A.A. Lindsay M. Webb D.J. Edwards C.R.W. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1995; 80: 3155-3159Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The present study suggests that the resistance to hyperglycemia in 11β-HSD-1 −/− mice was probably also partially mediated by improved insulin release. Accordingly, 11β-HSD-1 appears to be an interesting target for the development of novel approaches in the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus. Critical discussions with L. Abrahmsen are gratefully acknowledged."
https://openalex.org/W2050818881,"Engineered protein aggregates ranging up to 400 nm in diameter were selectively deposited within the cis-most cisternae of the Golgi stack following a 15°C block. These aggregates are much larger than the standard volume of Golgi vesicles, yet they are transported across the stack within 10 min after warming the cells to 20°C. Serial sectioning reveals that during the peak of anterograde transport, about 20% of the aggregates were enclosed in topologically free “megavesicles” which appear to pinch off from the rims of the cisternae. These megavesicles can explain the rapid transport of aggregates without cisternal progression on this time scale."

Restoring the properties of the human μ-opioid receptor in yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae), similar to those observed in native cells, was achieved by replacing ergosterol from yeast by cholesterol, which is normally found in mammalian plasma membranes. The results suggest that these two sterols have opposite effects with respect to the ligand binding function of the receptor. Ergosterol was found to constrain the μ-opioid receptor in an inactive state in yeast plasma membranes and cannot replace cholesterol in activating it. These data differ from previous works dealing with the function of related G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCR) in ergosterol-enriched membranes. This suggests that structural requirements of GPCR with respect to their modulation by lipid components differ from one protein to another. As a consequence, we assume that the presence of appropriate lipids around transmembrane proteins determines their function.

To perform functional and structural studies of mammalian G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCR),1 heterologous expression has long been a tool of choice (1Stanasila L. Pattus F. Massotte D. Biochimie (Paris ). 1998; 80: 563-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Unfortunately, although exceptions have been reported (2Price L.A. Kajkowski E.M. Hadcock J.R. Ozenberger B.A. Pausch M.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6188-6195Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar), these recombinant GPCR often fail to retain pharmacological properties similar to their native counterpart. Previous studies from our laboratory have focused on the expression of the human μ-opioid receptor in Saccharomyces cerevisiae(3Gaibelet G. Meilhoc E. Riond J. Saves I. Exner T. Liaubet L. Nürnberg B. Masson J.M. Emorine L.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 261: 517-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). We found that the affinities of the antagonists were in the same range with yeast spheroplasts as in reference tissues. However those of agonists were shown to be lower. Assuming a lack of effective receptor coupling to endogenous G-protein α-subunits (i.e.GPA1 proteins (4Miyajima I. Nakafuku M. Nakayama N. Brenner C. Miyajima A. Kaibuchi K. Arai K. Kaziro Y. Matsumoto K. Cell. 1987; 50: 1011-1019Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar, 5Dietzel C. Kurjan J. Cell. 1987; 50: 1001-1010Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar)), we were able to restore agonist binding upon addition of purified mammalian G-proteins (3Gaibelet G. Meilhoc E.

However, this approach requires high G-protein to receptor molar ratios and is not compatible with in vivo exploration of receptor functionality in heterologous systems. Finally, recent co-expressions of yeast/mammalian G-protein α-subunit chimeras with mammalian receptors have provided an alternative means to increase functional coupling (2Price L.A. Kajkowski E.M.

According to this study and to restore human μ-opioid receptor activity in S. cerevisiae, we have co-expressed a Gαi2-GPA1 chimera protein with the receptor. Unfortunately, as further shown below, this approach failed to restore the ligand binding function of the μ-opioid receptor. Several investigations have suggested the importance of lipid membrane composition and organization in determining the activity of transmembrane proteins (7Dumas F. Lebrun M.C. Tocanne J.F.

Membrane composition and organization of heterologous systems different to those present in native cells may thus be the limiting factor on the recovery of fully functional recombinant transmembrane proteins. In this study, we then investigated an unreported way of restoring human μ-opioid receptor activity in S. cerevisiae by selectively modifying its lipid membrane content. To be precise, our approach deals with the replacement of ergosterol, which is specifically found in the plasma membranes of yeasts (14Zinser E. Paltauf F. Daum G. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 2853-2858Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar), by cholesterol, which is normally found in the plasma membranes of mammalian cells (12Yeagle P.L. Finegold L. Cholesterol in Membrane Models. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1993: 1-12Google Scholar). The results obtained are in agreement with distinct roles of both sterols in determining the ligand binding function of the human μ-opioid receptor in S. cerevisiae. The construction of the plasmid pEMR516 μ-OR carrying the cDNA coding for the human μ-opioid receptor is described in Ref. 3Gaibelet G. Meilhoc E. Riond J. Saves I. Exner T. Liaubet L. Nürnberg B.

Spheroplast membranes (1.2 mg of proteins/ml) were incubated with 20 mm methyl-β-cyclodextrin (MBCD, Sigma) either loaded or not with cholesterol at a 1/18 cholesterol to cyclodextrins molar ratio in 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5. The buffer was supplemented with protease inhibitor mixture tablets (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) to prevent degradation of proteins. Shaking was performed for 30 min at room temperature. After centrifugation (35 min, 100,000 × g), the pellets were washed once with Tris-based buffer and then resuspended in 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA. Treated membranes were stored at −80 °C before use. Protein content of spheroplast membranes was determined according to the Lowry procedure with bovine serum albumin as the standard. Total lipids were extracted from membranes following the method of Bligh and Dyer. The amount of phospholipids was estimated determining the phosphorus content according to Eaton and Dennis. Sterol content was determined using a colorimetric method based on the oxidation of the hydroxyl group at the carbon atom 3 in the β-position (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Therefore, both ergosterol and cholesterol react in the assay. This explains the additional use of gas chromatography to quantify the relative amounts of both sterols when they co-exist within cholesterol-loaded yeast membranes (see Fig. 1).Figure 1Methyl-β-cyclodextrin-mediated alterations of sterol amount in spheroplast membranes expressing the human μ-opioid receptor.

Biochem. 1999; 261: 517-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), co-expression of a Gαi2 -GPA1 chimera protein with the receptor was performed as a first approach (see “Experimental Procedures”). This method was previously found to promote functional coupling of G-proteins to receptors, thereby leading to high affinity binding of agonists (2Price L.A. Kajkowski E.M. Hadcock J.R. Ozenberger B.A. Pausch M.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6188-6195Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 6Brown A.J. Dyos J.B. Whiteway M.S. White J.H.M. Watson M.-A.E.A. Marzioch M. Clare J.J. Cousens D.J. Paddon C. Plumpton C. Romanos M.A. Dowell S.J. Yeast. 2000; 16: 11-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). The results obtained following saturation binding experiments of the antagonist [3H]DPN and the full agonist [3H]DAMGO are shown in Fig. 2 and Table I. As shown previously (3Gaibelet G. Meilhoc E. Riond J. Saves I. Exner T. Liaubet L. Nürnberg B. Masson J.M. Emorine L.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 261: 517-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), a high affinity binding for [3H]DPN was observed (K d = 1 nm). In contrast, we were not able to detect specific and saturable binding for [3H]DAMGO. Accordingly, we assumed that G-protein/receptor coupling was not the main (at least the sole) limiting step to restore the human μ-opioid receptor ligand binding function in yeast.Table IBinding affinities of modified yeast membranes expressing the human μ-opioid receptor and transformed (αi2-GPA1 mutant strain) or not (GPA1 − mutant strain) with pLP82 containing Gαi2-GPA1 cDNAYeast phenotypeLigandK dUntreated yeast membranesErgosterol depleted yeast membranesCholesterol loaded yeast membranesnmαi2-GPA1[3H]DAMGOND5.5 ± 1.53.2 ± 0.6αi2-GPA1[3H]Diprenorphine1.0 ± 0.11.5 ± 0.20.7 ± 0.3GPA1 −[3H]DAMGONDND5.5 ± 1.5GPA1 −[3H]Diprenorphine3.8 ± 0.31.1 ± 0.20.3 ± 0.1Corresponding dissociation constants (K d) for [3H]DAMGO and [3H]DPN on untreated, ergosterol-depleted (20 mm MBCD) and cholesterol-loaded membranes (20 mm MBCD + cholesterol) determined as described in the legend to Fig. 2 and under “Experimental Procedures.” Results are the mean results for three independent determinations performed in duplicate with corresponding S.D.

ND, not detectable. Replacement of ergosterol from S. cerevisiaeplasma membranes by cholesterol was achieved using MBCD previously described as a sterol-carrying agent (10Gimpl G. Burger K. Fahrenholz F. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 10959-10974Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar, 15Christian A.E. Haynes M.P. Phillips M.C. Rothblat G.H. J. Lipid Res. 1997; 38: 2264-2272Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Spheroplast membranes co-expressing the human μ-opioid receptor and the Gαi2-GPA1 chimera protein were incubated with 20 mm MBCD either loaded or not with cholesterol, thus leading to cholesterol complementation or ergosterol depletion, respectively. Efficiency of treatments, both determined by a 3βOH-sterol oxidase based method and by gas chromatography is presented in Fig. 1. The protein to phospholipid ratios measured following MBCD-mediated treatments of yeast membranes were unaltered, thus demonstrating the specificity of MBCD in carrying sterols (not shown). Binding parameters for [3H]DPN and [3H]DAMGO on treated membranes are shown in Fig.2 and Table I. With respect to the antagonist [3H]DPN, a 10-fold increase in binding (B max) was found upon removal of ergosterol, still with high affinity properties. Similar patterns were obtained upon addition of cholesterol. Strikingly, restoration of saturable binding was seen on ergosterol-depleted membranes, although with slightly lower affinities (K d = 5.5 nm) in comparison with those reported in mammalian-expressing systems (16Raynor K. Kong H. Chen Y. Yasuda K., Yu, L. Bell G.I. Reisine T. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 45: 330-334PubMed Google Scholar). Loading untreated membranes with cholesterol yielded a 2-fold additional binding of the agonist as well as higher affinity (K d = 3.2 nm). Considered altogether, the data presented here suggest that the human μ-opioid receptor resides in a prevailing low affinity state inS. cerevisiae plasma membranes, irrespective of the antagonist or agonist nature of ligands used. The detrimental effects of yeast membrane composition with respect to μ-opioid receptor function is further emphasized by specific binding recovery upon either removal of ergosterol or loading of cholesterol. Thus, conversion from low affinity to high affinity sites is likely to take place following the above treatments. Receptor coupling to heterotrimeric G-proteins is reported to increase the affinity of receptors for their agonists. To determine whether the recovery of high affinity binding of the agonist was related to G-protein coupling to the receptor, the above experiments were repeated onGPA1-deleted spheroplast membranes. Results are presented in Fig. 3(B max) and Table I (K d). In contrast to what is obtained on μ/αi2-GPA1-expressing spheroplast, the magnitude of binding (B max) of the antagonist [3H]DPN was little affected upon modulation of sterol content. However, a lower affinity (K d = 3.8 nm) was measured on untreated membranes. Altering the sterol content of spheroplasts increases the affinity of receptors, either through removal of ergosterol (K d = 1 nm) or by addition of cholesterol (K d = 0.3 nm). Hence, both modifying sterol content procedures resulted in a stabilization of high affinity binding states for [3H]DPN. In contrast, ergosterol depletion failed to restore specific binding for the agonist [3H]DAMGO. Therefore, recovery of agonist binding upon removal of ergosterol on αi2-GPA1-expressing spheroplast membranes probably also depends on G-protein/receptor coupling. Only cholesterol loading was found to restore binding of the agonist [3H]DAMGO, although with a 2-fold lower affinity (K d = 5.5 nm) than the one determined on αi2-GPA1-expressing spheroplast membranes. This strongly suggests that cholesterol is able to stabilize a high affinity binding state of the μ-opioid receptor in yeast, irrespective of coupling to a G-protein. Furthermore, to prevent a possible coupling between the receptor and GPA2, another Gα-like protein also described in yeast (17Yun C.W. Tamaki H. Nakayama R. Yamamoto K. Kumagai H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 252: 29-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), agonist binding was also performed with 100 μm Gpp(NH)p, a nonhydrolyzable GTP analog well known to uncouple the G-protein from the receptor. This did not alter agonist binding either (B max = 300 fmol/mg, K d = 4.5 nm). Based on distinct pharmacological properties, three conformational states of human μ-opioid receptor have been identified. A model accounting for the results obtained including R1, R2, and R* as various states of the receptor is shown in Fig. 4. We postulate that a proportion of each state within biological membranes is mainly governed by lipid components (particularly sterols). R1 is the major form of human μ-opioid receptor present in native yeast membranes. This conformational state exhibits low affinity for both agonist and antagonist. In contrast, in ergosterol-depleted membranes the R2 conformational state binds antagonists with high affinity. The [R1] versus [R2] ratio (i.e. equilibrium 1) strongly depends on the presence of ergosterol in the membranes as demonstrated by enhanced binding for [3H]DPN upon its removal. These data suggest that ergosterol acts as an inhibitor of μ-opioid receptor binding function, constraining it in an inactive state R1 when expressed in yeast plasma membranes. This is also supported by the fact that agonist binding is partly restored upon depletion of ergosterol. It is widely admitted that agonist binding on GPCR results in an activated R* conformation of the receptor, thereby promoting coupling to a G-protein and the formation of a stabilized ternary complex displaying high affinity for agonists (18Samama P. Cotecchia S. Costa T. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4625-4636Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Indeed, lack of functional G-proteins is detrimental to agonist binding (18Samama P. Cotecchia S. Costa T. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4625-4636Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In ergosterol-depleted membranes, G-proteins were required to observe agonist binding. This confirms that the R2 state is not by itself able to retain agonists binding but needs stabilization by a G-protein of the agonist-induced shift to an activated R* state of the receptor. According to the law of mass action, the amount of G-proteins will affect the magnitude of agonist binding, i.e. the extent of receptor in the R* state, through the equilibrium constantK G between coupled and uncoupled receptor states. This explains previous results from our laboratory showing recovery of agonist binding on native yeast membranes, where essentially the R1 form is found, upon addition of an excess of purified mammalian G-proteins (3Gaibelet G. Meilhoc E. Riond J. Saves I. Exner T. Liaubet L. Nürnberg B. Masson J.M. Emorine L.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 261: 517-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). However, whether the R* state observed under these conditions derives from R2 or R1 is not known, thus the proposal of equilibriums 2 and 3 leading to R* in our model. Finally, addition of cholesterol to the yeast membranes increases agonist binding, irrespective of the presence of G-proteins. This is similar to what is observed for constitutively active mutant receptors (18Samama P. Cotecchia S. Costa T. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4625-4636Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, cholesterol seems to constrain the μ-opioid receptor in an active R* state, while ergosterol constrains it in an inactive state R1. Accumulating evidence suggests that membrane sterols are unevenly distributed within the plane of membranes (19Schroeder F. Frolov A.A. Murphy E.J. Atshaves B.P. Jefferson J.R. Pu L. Wood W.G. Foxworth W.B. Kier A.B. Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 1996; 213: 150-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Cholesterol-rich lipid rafts like platforms which recruit membrane proteins and support numerous cellular events in membrane traffic and signal transduction have been postulated (20Simons K. Ikonen E. Nature. 1997; 387: 569-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (8117) Google Scholar). The in vivo existence of rafts in mammalian cells has been demonstrated (21Varma R. Mayor S. Nature. 1998; 394: 798-801Crossref PubMed Scopus (1027) Google Scholar, 22Friedrichson T. Kurzchalia T.V. Nature. 1998; 394: 802-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar). Works have provided evidence that ergosterol-mediated rafts also exist in yeast (23Bagnat M. Keranen S. Shevchenko A. Shevchenko A. Simons K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 3254-3259Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar). We showed that the R2 form of the μ-opioid receptor present in sterol-depleted membranes displays pharmacological properties distinct from those observed in a sterol-enriched membrane environment where the R1 or R* states predominantly exist, depending on the presence of ergosterol or cholesterol in membranes (Fig. 4). Accordingly, distinct conformational and functional states of the μ-opioid receptor within biological membranes could be related to its distribution in sterol-rich and sterol-poor domains. Works focused on the role that lipids play in assisting folding of membrane proteins, thereby leading to their proper conformational and structural organization (for review, see Ref. 24Bogdanov M. Dowhan W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36827-36830Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). As an example, the requirement of phosphatidylethanolamine as a molecular chaperone in determining assembly of lactose permease from Escherichia coli has been extensively studied (24Bogdanov M. Dowhan W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36827-36830Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 25Bogdanov M. Umeda M. Dowhan W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12339-12345Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Similarly, an alternative interpretation of our data includes partial misfolding of the human μ-opioid receptor when inserted in ergosterol-rich yeast plasma membranes. Then, modifying the lipid composition of yeast plasma membranes would result in restoring correct folding of the receptor and thus its functionality. However, whether or not ergosterol depletion and/or cholesterol complementation acts once the structure of the human μ-opioid receptor is restored is not known. According to current literature (10Gimpl G. Burger K. Fahrenholz F. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 10959-10974Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar, 26Yeagle P.L. Biochimie (Paris ). 1991; 73: 1303-1310Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar), the activity of transmembrane proteins such as the μ-opioid receptor function could be modulated through direct sterol-protein interactions or as a consequence of alterations of bulk physical properties of the lipid bilayer, following modifications of the sterol content. Experiments carried out both on model and natural membranes have emphasized similar roles for cholesterol and ergosterol in increasing ordering of acyl chains, thereby decreasing their fluidity state (10Gimpl G. Burger K. Fahrenholz F. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 10959-10974Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar, 27Schuler I. Duportail G. Glasser N. Benveniste P. Hartmann M.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1028: 82-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Thus, their very close capacity to alter bulk physical properties of membranes cannot account for the above mentioned distinct effects of cholesterol and ergosterol with respect to the μ-opioid receptor functionality. Furthermore, fluorescence polarization using DPH as membrane fluidity sensitive dye was found to be unaffected following the membrane treatments described above (data not shown). This strongly suggests that the modulation of μ-opioid receptor functions is unrelated to alterations of bulk properties of membranes. Thus, interactions between the μ-opioid receptor and lipids are likely to take place at the protein/lipid interface. One might assume that the minor structural differences between these sterols (27Schuler I. Duportail G. Glasser N. Benveniste P. Hartmann M.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1028: 82-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) are crucial in determining the μ-opioid conformation and function in a highly specific manner. Several investigations have dealt with the presence of adequate lipids near the annular environment of embedded proteins, thereby determining their structure and activity (7Dumas F. Lebrun M.C. Tocanne J.F. FEBS Lett. 1999; 458: 271-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 28Simmonds A.C. East J.M. Jones O.T. Rooney E.K. McWhirter J. Lee A.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1982; 693: 398-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Similarly, an enrichment of sterol amount within the lipid layers surrounding the receptor might account for the observed alterations of its functionality. On the other hand, binding of lipids to specific recognition sites on transmembrane proteins to promote conformational changes as part of their function have been explored (10Gimpl G. Burger K. Fahrenholz F. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 10959-10974Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar, 29Jones O.T. McNamee M.G. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 2364-2374Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Quenching experiments of the intrinsic fluorescence of reconstituted proteins have provided suitable methods for probing lipid-protein interactions (28Simmonds A.C. East J.M. Jones O.T. Rooney E.K. McWhirter J. Lee A.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1982; 693: 398-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 29Jones O.T. McNamee M.G. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 2364-2374Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar, 30London E. Feigenson G.W. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 1939-1948Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Unfortunately, purification procedures for the μ-opioid receptor are still lacking. To conclude, the above results emphasize the importance of specific lipid membrane composition and organization in maintaining membrane protein functions. We have shown that ergosterol, constraining the human μ-opioid receptor in an inactive state, cannot replace cholesterol that was found to activate the receptor. This strongly suggests that lipid composition of yeast plasma membranes was the main limiting factor in our attempt to fully restore the μ-opioid receptor functionality in S. cerevisiae (3Gaibelet G. Meilhoc E. Riond J. Saves I. Exner T. Liaubet L. Nürnberg B. Masson J.M. Emorine L.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 261: 517-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Accordingly, the addition of specific mammalian membrane lipids in yeast may provide new perspectives for the heterologous expression of fully functional mammalian receptors. Recent works dealt with the replacement of cholesterol by structurally modified sterols in mammalian plasma membranes to modulate the activity of two mammalian GPCR, the oxytocin receptor and the brain cholecystokinin receptor (10Gimpl G. Burger K. Fahrenholz F. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 10959-10974Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). In contrast to our results with the μ-opioid receptor, it was found that ergosterol was partially able to support the ligand binding function of the two related receptors. Other GPCR retain their properties when expressed in yeasts (2Price L.A. Kajkowski E.M. Hadcock J.R. Ozenberger B.A. Pausch M.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6188-6195Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). In addition, yeast transmembrane proteins such as the α factor receptor involved in the mating response pathway in S. cerevisiae (31Blumer K.J. Reneke J.E. Thorner J. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 10836-10842Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) are adapted to high levels of ergosterol. These data suggest that structural requirements displayed by GPCR with respect to their modulation by lipid components differ from one protein to another. As a direct consequence, this would imply the presence of suited lipids around transmembrane proteins to determine their function. This highlights the functional significance of lateral heterogeneities of membrane components within biological membranes."
https://openalex.org/W2133094280,"Invasion of brain microvascular endothelial cells (BMEC) is a prerequisite for successful crossing of the blood-brain barrier by Escherichia coli K1. We have previously demonstrated the requirement of cytoskeletal rearrangements and activation of focal adhesion kinase (FAK) in E. coli K1 invasion of human BMEC (HBMEC). The current study investigated the role of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) activation and PI3K interaction with FAK in E. coli invasion of HBMEC. PI3K inhibitor LY294002 blocked E. coli K1 invasion of HBMEC in a dose-dependent manner, whereas an inactive analogue LY303511 had no such effect. In HBMEC, E. coli K1 increased phosphorylation of Akt, a downstream effector of PI3K, which was completely blocked by LY294002. In contrast, non-invasive E. coli failed to activate PI3K. Overexpression of PI3K mutants Δp85 and catalytically inactive p110 in HBMEC significantly inhibited both PI3K/Akt activation and E. coli K1 invasion of HBMEC. Stimulation of HBMEC with E. coli K1 increased PI3K association with FAK. Furthermore, PI3K/Akt activation was blocked in HBMEC-overexpressing FAK dominant-negative mutants (FRNK and Phe397FAK). These results demonstrated the involvement of PI3K signaling in E. coli K1 invasion of HBMEC and identified a novel role for PI3K interaction with FAK in the pathogenesis ofE. coli meningitis.

The most distressing aspect of neonatal Gram-negative meningitis is high morbidity and mortality despite advances in antimicrobial chemotherapy and supportive care. Increased understanding of the pathogenesis and pathophysiology of this disease can lead to improved outcome. Intravascular survival and penetration of the blood-brain barrier by circulating bacteria represent the most critical events in the development of bacterial meningitis (1Leib L.S. Tauber M.G. Infect. Dis. Clin. North Am. 1999; 13: 527-548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Invasion of brain microvascular endothelial cells (BMEC)1 is a requirement forE. coli crossing of the blood-brain barrier, and it involves attachment of E. coli to BMEC through interaction of bacterial ligands with corresponding receptors present on BMEC cell surface (2Kim K.S. Subcell. Biochem. 2000; 33: 47-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Several E. coli determinants (OmpA, IbeA, Ibe B, and YijP) involved in the invasion of BMEC have been identified (3Prasadarao N.V. Wass C.A. Weiser J.N. Stins M.F. Huang S.H. Kim K.S. Infect. Immun. 1996; 64: 146-153Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 4Huang S.H. Wass C.A. Fu Q. Prasadarao N.V. Stins M.F. Kim K.S. Infect. Immun. 1995; 63: 4470-4475Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 5Huang S.H.

Immun. 1999; 67: 4751-4756Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Receptors on the surface of BMEC for two of these E. coli determinants (OmpA and IbeA) have been characterized biochemically (7Prasadarao N.V. Wass C.A. Kim K.S. Infect. Immun. 1996; 64: 154-160Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8Prasadarao N.V. Wass C.A. Huang S.H. Kim K.S. Infect. Immun. 1999; 67: 1131-1138Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We have recently demonstrated that E. coli invasion of BMEC occurs via a zipper-like mechanism and requires cytoskeletal rearrangements in the host cell (9Prasadarao N.V. Wass C.A. Stins M.F. Shimada H. Kim K.S. Infect. Immun. 1999; 67: 5775-5783Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We have further characterized in BMEC that E. coli K1 induces tyrosine phosphorylation of focal adhesion kinase (FAK) and paxillin, a cytoskeletal protein known to associate with FAK (10Reddy M.A. Wass C.A. Kim K.S. Schlaepfer D.D. Prasadarao N.V. Infect. Immun. 2000; 68: 6423-6430Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Furthermore, using FAK dominant-negative mutants we have shown that FAK kinase activity and its autophosphorylation site tyrosine 397 (Tyr-397) are critical for E. coli K1 invasion of HBMEC (10Reddy M.A. Wass C.A. Kim K.S. Schlaepfer D.D. Prasadarao N.V. Infect. Immun. 2000; 68: 6423-6430Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). These results establish that FAK signaling is essential in E. coliK1 invasion of HBMEC. FAK is a 125-kDa non-receptor tyrosine kinase and plays an important role in the assembly of signaling complexes that regulate the organization of the cytoskeleton and modulate the function of growth factors. An amino- and a carboxyl-terminal domain of about 400 amino acids each flank the kinase domain of FAK. The amino-terminal domain contains an autophosphorylation site (Tyr-397), and the carboxyl-terminal domain contains focal adhesion targeting sequences needed for targeting to focal adhesions and binding sites for intracellular signaling molecules and cytoskeletal proteins (11Schlaepfer D.D. Hauck C.R. Sieg D.J. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 1999; 71: 435-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (1036) Google Scholar). However, the signaling molecules that interact with FAK in E. coli K1 invasion of BMEC have not been identified. The autophosphorylation site Tyr-397 of FAK has been shown to bind to Src kinases and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), and binding to one or both is required for FAK-mediated functions (12Xing Z. Chen H.-C. Nowlen J.K. Taylor S. Shalloway D. Guan J.-L. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1994; 5: 413-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar, 13Cobb B.S. Schaller M.D. Leu T.-H. Parsons J.T. Mol. Cell.

Interestingly, pretreatment of HBMEC with Src kinase-specific inhibitor, PP1, did not affect E. coli K1 invasion of HBMEC (10Reddy M.A. Wass C.A. Kim K.S. Schlaepfer D.D. Prasadarao N.V. Infect. Immun. 2000; 68: 6423-6430Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Furthermore, overexpression of Src kinase dominant-negative mutants did not blockE. coli K1 invasion of HBMEC, 2M. A. Reddy, N. V. Prasadarao, and K. S. Kim, unpublished results. suggesting an insignificant role for Src kinases. In the present study, we examined the role of PI3K in E. coli invasion of HBMEC. PI3K proteins are subdivided into three major groups, and group I PI3K has been identified as a downstream effector of both receptor and non-receptor tyrosine kinases (16Wymann M.P. Pirola L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1436: 127-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (580) Google Scholar). Group I PI3K is a heterodimer consisting of a regulatory subunit (p85) and a 110-kDa catalytic subunit (p110). Regulatory subunit p85 contains an SH3 domain and two SH2 domains that interact with various intracellular signaling molecules. Interaction of the SH2 domains of p85 subunit with phosphotyrosine residues on tyrosine kinases, including Src and FAK, results in PI3K activation. PI3K catalytic subunit p110 phosphorylates the d-3 position of the inositide ring of phosphatidylinositol, and its derivatives form the second messenger phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate. Phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate binding to pleckstrin homology (PH) domains of various cellular and cytoskeletal proteins mediates membrane recruitment of several kinases including, Akt (protein kinase B), PDK1, and PDK2. Akt is then activated by sequential phosphorylation on Thr-308 and Ser-473 by phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinases PDK1 and PDK2, respectively (17Downward J.

In this paper, we report the activation of PI3K/Akt signaling in E. coli K1 invasion of HBMECs and demonstrate that PI3K interaction with FAK is required for the activation of PI3K/Akt signaling in this process.

Mammalian expression vector pcDNA3-expressing kinase-negative p110 and Δp85 mutants with the FLAG epitope tag were kindly provided by L. C. Cantley (Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA).

Strain E44 is a rifampin-resistant mutant ofE. coli K1 strain RS218 (serotype 018:K1:H7) isolated from the cerebrospinal fluid of a neonate with meningitis and has been shown to invade brain microvascular endothelial cells (2Kim K.S. Subcell. Biochem. 2000; 33: 47-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). E. coliHB101 is a non-invasive laboratory strain (3Prasadarao N.V. Wass C.A. Weiser J.N. Stins M.F. Huang S.H. Kim K.S. Infect. Immun. 1996; 64: 146-153Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Human brain microvascular endothelial cells (HBMEC) were isolated and cultured as described previously (28Stins M.F. Gilles F. Kim K.S. J. Neuroimmunol. 1997; 76: 81-90Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). HBMEC cultures were routinely grown on rat tail collagen-coated dishes in RPMI medium containing 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 10% Nu-Serum, 2 mmglutamine, 1 mm pyruvate, penicillin (100 units/ml), streptomycin (100 μg/ml), essential amino acids, and vitamins. HBMECs were transfected with mammalian expression vectors coding for PI3K mutants using LipofectAMINE as described previously (10Reddy M.A. Wass C.A. Kim K.S. Schlaepfer D.D. Prasadarao N.V. Infect. Immun. 2000; 68: 6423-6430Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Briefly, DNA-LipofectAMINE complex in RPMI was added to 50% confluent HBMEC monolayers. After 6 h of incubation at 37 °C, cells were washed with RPMI and complete medium was added. Three days after the transfection, HBMEC were transferred to medium containing an antibiotic G418 (400 μg/ml) for 2–3 weeks, and antibiotic-resistant colonies were pooled for further analysis. HBMEC-expressing FAK mutant Phe397FAK was maintained in medium containing G418 (400 μg/ml) and FRNK-expressing cells in the presence of hygromycin (100 μg/ml) as described previously (10Reddy M.A. Wass C.A. Kim K.S. Schlaepfer D.D. Prasadarao N.V. Infect. Immun. 2000; 68: 6423-6430Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). E. coli invasion of HBMEC was performed as described earlier (3Prasadarao N.V. Wass C.A. Weiser J.N. Stins M.F. Huang S.H. Kim K.S. Infect. Immun. 1996; 64: 146-153Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, confluent endothelial cells in 24-well plates were incubated with 1 × 107 E. coli (multiplicity of infection of 100) in experimental medium (1:1 mixture of M199:Ham's F-12 containing 5% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum) for 90 min at 37 °C. The monolayers were washed with RPMI and then incubated in experimental medium containing gentamicin (100 μg/ml) for 1 h to kill extracellular bacteria. The monolayers were washed again and lysed with 0.5% Triton X-100. The released intracellular bacteria were enumerated by plating on sheep blood agar plates. In some experiments HBMEC were pretreated with various inhibitors for 30 min prior to stimulation with bacteria. Results were expressed as relative invasion (percentage of invasion in comparison to that of untreated HBMEC or HBMEC transfected with control vectors). Preparations of cell lysates and immunoprecipitation were performed as described previously (10Reddy M.A. Wass C.A. Kim K.S. Schlaepfer D.D. Prasadarao N.V. Infect. Immun. 2000; 68: 6423-6430Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Confluent monolayers of HBMEC were stimulated with E. coli resuspended in experimental medium at a multiplicity of infection of 100 for the indicated periods of time, and the monolayers were washed with cold phosphate-buffered saline containing 1 mm sodium orthovanadate. Cells were lysed in modified radioimmune precipitation buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 2 mm EGTA, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 50 mm NaF, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 25 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 10 μg/ml each of leupeptin and aprotinin), at 4 °C for 20 min. The cell lysates were centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was collected, and protein content was determined using the bicinchoninic acid kit. For immunoprecipitation, 300–500 μg of protein was incubated with appropriate antibody overnight at 4 °C and incubated for 1 h with Protein A-agarose. The immune complexes were washed four times with radioimmune precipitation buffer without deoxycholate, and the proteins from immune complexes were eluted in SDS sample buffer for further analysis by Western blotting. Proteins in immune complexes or total cell lysates were electrophoresed on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide electrophoresis gels and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. The blots were blocked with TBST (25 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.1% Tween 20) containing 3% bovine serum albumin for 2 h at room temperature and incubated with appropriate primary antibody overnight at 4 °C or for 2 h at room temperature. Then, the blots were washed with TBST and incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody for 1 h at room temperature. Subsequently, the blots were washed with TBST and developed with Super Signal chemiluminescence reagent. The blots were exposed to x-ray film to visualize the proteins. The protein bands on autoradiograms were scanned by using a GS-700 imaging densitometer, and the intensity of bands was analyzed using Quantitation One software (Bio-Rad). We have previously shown that the invasion of E. coli K1 induces activation of non-receptor tyrosine kinase FAK and its autophosphorylation site Tyr-397 is essential for E. coliinvasion of HBMEC (10Reddy M.A. Wass C.A. Kim K.S. Schlaepfer D.D. Prasadarao N.V. Infect. Immun. 2000; 68: 6423-6430Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Tyrosine 397 of FAK interacts with various intracellular signaling molecules, including Src kinases and PI3K, for FAK promoted biological effects. However, our earlier studies have demonstrated a minimal or no role for Src kinases in E. coliinvasion of HBMEC.2 Hence, the involvement of PI3K inE. coli invasion of HBMEC was studied using a PI3K-specific inhibitor LY294002. HBMEC were pretreated with either experimental medium (Control) or experimental medium containing various concentrations of LY294002 (1–50 μm) for 30 min. Then,E. coli invasion assays were performed on these cells using invasive E. coli K1 strain E44, and the results were expressed as a percentage of the control. Fig.1 shows that LY294002 inhibited E. coli K1 invasion of HBMEC in a dose-dependent manner with an IC50 of 5 μm (13,734 ± 1,000 cfu/well without inhibitor versus 834 ± 85 cfu/well with 50 μm LY294002, p < 0.001). Binding of E. coli to HBMEC was not affected by LY294002 pretreatment, and LY294002 was not toxic to HBMEC even at 100 μm as determined by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium assay (data not shown). To confirm that the observed inhibition was specific to LY294002, E. coli invasion assays were also performed with LY303511, which is an inactive analogue of LY294002. The results (Fig.1) showed that, even at 50 μm concentration, LY303511 had very little effect on E. coli K1 invasion of HBMEC. These results suggest the PI3K activity is required for E. coli K1 invasion of HBMEC. Stimulation of PI3K results in activation of a Ser/Thr kinase Akt (protein kinase B). Products generated by PI3K recruit Akt to the membrane, where a Ser/Thr kinase PDK1 phosphorylates Thr-308 followed by Ser-473 by PDK2, resulting in the activation of Akt. Activation of Akt is sensitive to PI3K inhibitors, and the phosphorylated Akt can be detected using phosphospecific Akt antibodies. We, therefore, used Akt activation as a parameter for determining PI3K activation in HBMEC by E. coli. To test the activation of PI3K, HBMEC were stimulated with invasive E. coli K1 strain E44 and non-invasive E. coli strain HB101. As a positive control, HBMECs were stimulated with epidermal growth factor (EGF) in the same experiment. Then, the HBMEC monolayers were lysed and cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-Akt antibody that recognizes both phosphorylated and non-phosphorylated forms. Immunoprecipitates were subjected to immunoblotting with either phosphospecific Akt antibody or the Akt antibody and the phospho-Akt bands were quantitated using image analysis software. The results are shown in Fig. 2 A. As expected, EGF treatment of HBMEC robustly increased Akt phosphorylation (10-fold increase in lane 3, compared with control cells inlane 1). In HBMEC stimulated with E44, Akt phosphorylation increased significantly (3-fold, lane 2) compared with control cells (lane 1). In contrast, non-invasive E. coli strain HB101 failed to increase phosphorylation of Akt (lane 4). Next, we examined the effect of PI3K inhibitor LY294002 on E. coli-stimulated Akt phosphorylation in HBMEC. Both control and HBMEC pretreated with LY294002 (25 μm) were stimulated with E44, and Akt was immunoprecipitated from the cell lysates. Immunoblotting with phospho-Akt antibodies revealed thatE. coli K1 stimulated phosphorylation of Akt by 2.8-fold (Fig. 2 C, lane 2) compared with control cells (Fig. 2 C, lane 1), and it was abolished by 25 μm LY294002 (Fig. 2 C, lane 4), a concentration at which E. coli K1 invasion was effectively inhibited. These results clearly demonstrate that Akt activation is specific to invasive E. coli K1 and is PI3K-dependent. To further demonstrate the role of PI3K in E. coli invasion, HBMEC were transfected with dominant-negative mutants of either p85 (Δp85) or p110 (p110ΔK) subunits of PI3K. The cDNAs of both mutants were cloned under the control of cytomegalovirus promoter with an amino-terminal FLAG epitope tag in the eucaryotic expression vector pcDNA3, which also confers G418 resistance. The Δp85 mutant contains a defective iSH2 region, fails to bind to PI3K catalytic subunit p110, and dominantly inhibits the activation of PI3K by titrating out the signaling molecules that interact with PI3K. Whereas, p110ΔK is a kinase inactive mutant, has a CAAX motif, and is constitutively translocated to the membrane. HBMEC transfected with the expression vector pcDNA3 was used as a control. HBMEC colonies resistant to G418 were pooled and used in further experiments. Lysates from transfected cells were immunoprecipitated with either p85 antibody or p110 antibody. Analysis of immunoprecipitates by immunoblotting with FLAG antibody (M2) showed that both p110 and p85 are expressed only in HBMEC transfected with appropriate vector but not in cells transfected with pcDNA3 (Fig.3 A). HBMEC transfected with pcDNA3 or PI3K mutants were used in E. coli invasion assays with E44, and the results of E. coli K1 invasion in HBMEC-expressing PI3K mutants were compared with those in cells expressing pcDNA3. As shown in Fig. 3 B, E. coli K1 invasion of HBMEC was blocked by 85% and 50%, respectively, in cells expressing p110ΔK and Δp85 (12,400 ± 1,172 cfu/well with pcDNA3 versus 1,860 ± 168 cfu/well and 6,300 ± 651 cfu/well in HBMEC transfected with Δp110 and Δp85, respectively, p < 0.002). These results clearly support that PI3K is involved in E. coli K1 invasion of HBMEC. Next, we tested whether PI3K activation is inhibited in HBMEC-expressing PI3K mutants. The HBMEC cells transfected with pcDNA3, Δp85, or Δp110 were stimulated with E44 for 10 min, and the cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with Akt antibody. Immunoprecipitates were divided into two aliquots and subjected to immunoblotting with either phospho-Akt antibody or non-phospho-Akt antibody. The levels of phospho-Akt were determined, and the results are shown in Fig. 4, A andB. E44 stimulated Akt activation by 3-fold in cells transfected with pcDNA3 (Fig. 4, lane 2), whereas Akt activation was inhibited in HBMEC transfected with PI3K mutants Δp85 (Fig. 4, lane 5) or p110ΔK (Fig. 4, lane 8). Activation of Akt by EGF was also inhibited in cells expressing both PI3K mutants compared with HBMEC transfected with pcDNA3 ((Fig. 4,lanes 3, 6, and 9). These results demonstrated that PI3K activation by E. coli K1 is inhibited in HBMEC-expressing dominant-negative mutants of PI3K. Taken together, these findings indicate that PI3K activation is required for E. coli K1 invasion of HBMEC. The regulatory subunit p85 interacts with the autophosphorylation site (Tyr-397) of FAK. Because Tyr-397 is critical for FAK signaling in E. coli K1 invasion of HBMEC (10Reddy M.A. Wass C.A. Kim K.S. Schlaepfer D.D. Prasadarao N.V. Infect. Immun. 2000; 68: 6423-6430Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), we examined whether p85 interacts with FAK. The cell lysates from HBMEC stimulated with E44 were immunoprecipitated with FAK antibody, and immunoprecipitates were analyzed by immunoblotting with p85 antibody. Immunoprecipitates were also immunoblotted with FAK antibody to verify the presence of equal amounts of FAK protein levels in each immunoprecipitate. As shown in Fig. 5, p85 association with FAK was seen in control HBMEC (lane 1) and this association was increased in HBMEC stimulated with E44 for 5 min (lane 2), 10 min (lane 3), and 30 min (lane 4). Immunoblotting with FAK antibody showed that immunoprecipitates contained equal amounts of FAK in all the samples. These results demonstrated that PI3K association with FAK is increased in cells stimulated with E. coli K1, which may be required for HBMEC invasion. E. coli K1 invasion of HBMEC is inhibited in cells overexpressing FAK dominant-negative mutants FRNK and autophosphorylation mutant Phe397FAK (10Reddy M.A. Wass C.A. Kim K.S. Schlaepfer D.D. Prasadarao N.V. Infect. Immun. 2000; 68: 6423-6430Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Having demonstrated the interaction of PI3K with FAK in HBMEC stimulated with E. coli K1, we next investigated if PI3K activation would be blocked by FAK dominant-negative mutants. HBMEC transfected with pcDNA3, FRNK, and Phe397FAK were stimulated with E44, and cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with Akt antibody. Analysis of immunoprecipitates with phospho-Akt antibody revealed that E. coli-stimulated Akt activation was completely abolished in HBMEC transfected with Phe397FAK and partially abolished in cells expressing FRNK (Fig.6). Thus, PI3K activation is inhibited in cells where FAK activation is blocked by dominant-negative mutants. Bacterial entry of mammalian cells involves a complex interplay of bacterial determinants with host cell receptors and is associated with activation of specific signaling pathways (2Kim K.S. Subcell. Biochem. 2000; 33: 47-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Our previous studies have demonstrated that FAK plays a central role in E. coliK1 invasion of HBMEC (10Reddy M.A. Wass C.A. Kim K.S. Schlaepfer D.D. Prasadarao N.V. Infect. Immun. 2000; 68: 6423-6430Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). However, the mechanisms of FAK activation and signaling molecules that interact with FAK in this process have been not identified. In this paper, we report that PI3K activation and its interaction with FAK are required for E. coli K1 invasion of HBMEC. This was shown by blockade of both PI3K activation and E. coli invasion of HBMEC with specific PI3K inhibitor (LY294002) as well as using dominant-negative mutants of PI3K (Δp85 and p110ΔK) and FAK (FRNK and FAKY397F). The regulatory subunit p85 of PI3K contains an amino-terminal SH3 domain, a breakpoint cluster homology domain and two SH2 domains. These domains allow p85 to simultaneously interact with multiple intracellular signaling molecules (16Wymann M.P. Pirola L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1436: 127-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (580) Google Scholar). Thus, PI3K can recruit a variety of signaling molecules to the site of bacterial entry. There are several phosphoinositide binding proteins, which can be potential downstream effectors of PI3K, that can participate at several steps inE. coli invasion of HBMEC, including cytoskeletal rearrangements or the endosome formation. One of them is the Rho family of GTP binding proteins that regulates actin rearrangement. Rho family members cycle between the inactive GDP binding form and the active GTP binding form. Guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEF) and GTPases regulate the cycling of Rho-like GTPases. GEFs mediate conversion of inactive GDP-bound form to active GTP-bound form. PI3K products can bind to pleckstrin homology domains in GEF and target them to plasma membrane to activate Rho family of GTPases (29Carpenter C.L. Tolias K.F. Couvillion A.C. Hartwig J.H. Adv. Enz. Regul. 1997; 37: 377-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). We showed that the E. coli K1 mutant lacking cytotoxic necrotizing factor-1 failed to invade HBMEC (30Wang, Y., Wass, C., and Kim, K. S. (2000) in Abstracts of the 100th American Society for Microbiology General Meeting, Los Angeles, May 21–25; Abstr. B108, p. 65.Google Scholar), suggesting the involvement of Rho GTPases. Cytotoxic necrotizing factor-1 is known to activate Rho GTPases in mammalian cells (31Schmidt G. Sehr P. Wilm M. Selzer J. Mann M. Aktories K. Nature. 1997; 387: 725-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar, 32Flatau G. Lemichez E. Gauthier M. Chardin P. Fiorentini C. Boquet P. Nature. 1997; 387: 729-733Crossref PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar). PI3K may be required for the regulation of Rho-like GTPases in HBMEC. Many cytoskeletal proteins involved in the regulation of actin polymerization bind to phosphoinositides through their pleckstrin homology (PH) domains,e.g. profilin and capping proteins bind to monomeric actin and prevent its polymerization. Binding of phosphoinositides to the PH domains of these proteins releases actin and promotes polymerization (33Schmidt A. Hall M.N. Ann. Rev. Cell. Dev. Biol. 1998; 14: 305-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar). Phosphoinositide-induced changes in the conformation of another cytoskeletal protein vinculin may also play a role in focal adhesion assembly by promoting cross-linking of talin to actin. Another mechanism for the PI3K involvement could be the activation of Akt, a Ser/Thr kinase, which is recruited to plasma membrane by binding to phosphoinositides through its PH domain. Evidence exists for the involvement of Akt in actin reorganization and migration of microvascular endothelial cells (34Morales-Ruiz M. Fulton D. Sowa G. Languino L.R. Fujio Y. Wlash K. Circ. Res. 2000; 86: 892-896Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). Upon entry into HBMEC, E. coli have been shown to be located in vacuoles and cross the HBMEC by transcytosis (9Prasadarao N.V. Wass C.A. Stins M.F. Shimada H. Kim K.S. Infect. Immun. 1999; 67: 5775-5783Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This is another level where PI3K may be involved, because PI3K has been shown to participate in the recruitment of early endosome proteins as well as movement of the endosomes along the microtubules (35Nielsen E. Severin F. Backer J.M. Hyman A.A. Zerial M. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 376-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar, 36Gaullier J.M. Simonsen A. D'Arrigo A. Bremnes B. Stenmark H. Aasland R. Nature. 1998; 394: 432-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar). Studies are in progress to examine the role of PI3K in cytoskeleton rearrangements and trafficking of E. coli-containing vacuoles in HBMEC. Our recent results have demonstrated the cytoskeletal changes in HBMEC at the site of bacterial entry (9Prasadarao N.V. Wass C.A. Stins M.F. Shimada H. Kim K.S. Infect. Immun. 1999; 67: 5775-5783Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These sites were similar to focal adhesions that are intracellularly associated with protein complexes consisting of cytoskeletal proteins and tyrosine kinase FAK (37Brigitte M.J. Bubeck P. Giegl K. Kroemker M. Moschner J. Rothkegel M. Rudiger M. Schluter K. Stanke G. Winkler J. Ann. Rev. Cell. Dev. Biol. 1995; 11: 379-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar). The role of FAK has been studied in many cellular responses associated with cytoskeleton rearrangement, including adhesion and migration (38Guan J.-L. Chen H.-C. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1996; 168: 81-108Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, the mechanism of FAK activation and the proteins recruited by FAK in E. coli invasion of HBMEC have not been identified. The present study identified that PI3K interacts with FAK in HBMEC and its interaction is enhanced in HBMEC stimulated with E. coliK1, suggesting that FAK recruits PI3K to the site of bacterial entry. PI3K activation was abolished by FAK dominant-negative mutants FRNK and FAKY397F, indicating that FAK may be upstream of PI3K in E. coli K1 invasion of HBMEC. In contrast, tyrosine phosphorylation of FAK was not affected by PI3K inhibitors (data not shown), providing further support for this mechanism. Several E. coli K1 determinants involved in the HBMEC invasion have been identified, and some of these bacterial proteins induced cytoskeleton rearrangements in HBMEC (2Kim K.S. Subcell. Biochem. 2000; 33: 47-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). However, at present, the identity of E. coli K1 structures responsible for the activation of FAK and/or PI3K and the mechanism of activation in HBMEC are not yet defined. Of interest, uropathogenic E. coliinvasion of bladder epithelial cells was found to require host actin reorganization, FAK phosphorylation at Tyr-397 and PI3K activation, but not activation of Src-family tyrosine kinases (39Martinez J.J. Mulvey M.A. Schilling J.D. Pinkner J.S. Hultgren S.J. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2803-2812Crossref PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar). These events were mediated by FimH and correlated with the formation of complexes between FAK and PI3K. Thus, our findings of PI3K activation and PI3K/FAK interactions reported here with E. coli K1 invasion of HBMEC are similar to those observed with type 1 pilus E. coliinvasion of uroepithelial cells. We have previously demonstrated that other meningitis-causing bacteria,e.g. group B streptococcus (40Nizet V. Kim K.S. Stins M. Jonas M. Chi E.Y. Nguyen D. Rubens C.E. Infect. Immun. 1997; 65: 5074-5081Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), Citrobacter freundii (41Badger J.L. Stins M.F. Kim K.S. Infect. Immun. 1999; 67: 4208-4215Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and L. monocytogenes (42Greiffenberg L. Goebel W. Kim K.S. Weiglein I. Rubert A. Engelbrecht R. Stins M. Kuhn M. Infect. Immun. 1998; 66: 5260-5267Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), are able to invade HBMEC. PI3K involvement has been demonstrated in L. monocytogenes invasion of epithelial cells. However, PI3K involvement is independent of FAK in L. monocytogenesinvasion of epithelial cells (15Ireton K. Payrastre B. Cossart P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17025-17032Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). In contrast, our findings indicate the requirement of PI3K interaction with FAK in E. coli K1 invasion of HBMEC. Thus, the mechanism of E. coli K1 invasion of HBMEC is strikingly different from that of L. monocytogenes. This may reflect the differences in cell types, bacterial ligands, and mechanisms of diseases. It would be interesting to see whether PI3K/FAK interactions are also involved in the invasion of HBMEC by other meningitis-causing bacteria. We thank Dr. M. F. Stins for help with culturing human brain microvascular endothelial cells."
https://openalex.org/W1993772406,"Astrocytes represent the most abundant cell type of the adult nervous system. Under normal conditions, astrocytes participate in neuronal feeding and detoxification. However, following brain injury, local increases in inflammatory cytokines trigger a reactive phenotype in astrocytes during which these cells produce their own inflammatory cytokines and neurotoxic free radicals. Indeed, progression of this inflammatory reaction is responsible for most neurological damage associated with brain trauma. Insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) protects neurons against a variety of brain pathologies associated with glial overproduction of proinflammatory cytokines. Here, we demonstrate that in astrocyte cultures IGF-I regulates NFκB, a transcription factor known to play a key role in the inflammatory reaction. IGF-I induces a site-specific dephosphorylation of IκBα (phospho-Ser32) in astrocytes. Moreover, IGF-I-mediated dephosphorylation of IκBα protects this molecule from tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα)-stimulated degradation; therefore, IGF-I also inhibits the nuclear translocation of NFκB (p65) induced by TNFα exposure. Finally, we show that dephosphorylation of IκBα by IGF-I pathways requires activation of calcineurin. Activation of this phosphatase is independent of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and mitogen-activated protein kinase. Thus, these data suggest that the therapeutic benefits associated with IGF-I treatment of brain injury are derived from both its positive effects on neuronal survival and inhibition of the glial inflammatory reaction. Astrocytes represent the most abundant cell type of the adult nervous system. Under normal conditions, astrocytes participate in neuronal feeding and detoxification. However, following brain injury, local increases in inflammatory cytokines trigger a reactive phenotype in astrocytes during which these cells produce their own inflammatory cytokines and neurotoxic free radicals. Indeed, progression of this inflammatory reaction is responsible for most neurological damage associated with brain trauma.

Neurons transmit high speed information through depolarization potentials, whereas glial cells provide a basic support to neurons. Under normal conditions, glial cells, and in particular astrocytes, modulate neuronal feeding and detoxification and produce neuronal survival factors. However, following brain injury, astrocytes actively participate in the inflammatory response and in scar formation. Inflammatory cytokines resulting from brain insults induce astrocytes to adopt a reactive phenotype during which these cells also produce proinflammatory cytokines and neurotoxic free radicals such as nitric oxide (1Ridet J.L. Malhotra S.K. Privat A. Gage F.H. Trends Neurosci. 1997; 20: 570-577Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1512) Google Scholar). Reactive astrocytes produce a compendium of inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines; the balance between these opposing groups of factors determines the fate of the affected neurons. Proinflammatory factors such as tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα)1 or interleukin 1 (IL-1) trigger the expression of more proinflammatory genes in astrocytes and eventually induce apoptosis in neurons, whereas other factors including interleukin 4 (IL-4) and insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) reduce inflammation and promote survival of neurons (2Venters H.D. Dantzer R. Kelley K.W. Trends Neurosci. 2000; 23: 175-180Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Cross-talk between the signaling pathways of these two groups of factors has been proposed as a mechanism for regulation of apoptosis and survival. Although it has been known for many years that TNFα induces insulin resistance (3Peraldi P. Hotamisligil G.S. Buurman W.A. White M.F. Spiegelman B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13018-13022Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar), recent reports suggest that the capacity of this cytokine to inhibit the neuroprotective actions of IGF-I may represent a possible mechanism underlying neurodegeneration (4Venters H.D. Tang Q. Liu Q. VanHoy R.W. Dantzer R. Kelley K.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 9879-9884Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). The traditional role of IGF-I as a growth factor has been expanded with the recent discovery that it promotes survival in many cell types. IGF-I, acting through phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3-kinase) and Akt, is a survival factor for cerebellar granule neurons (4Venters H.D. Tang Q. Liu Q. VanHoy R.W. Dantzer R. Kelley K.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 9879-9884Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar, 5Dudek H. Datta S.R. Franke T.F. Birnbaum M.J. Yao R. Cooper G.M. Segal R.A. Kaplan D.R. Greenberg M.E. Science. 1997; 275: 661-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (2212) Google Scholar).In vivo, IGF-I protects neurons against a variety of brain insults typically associated with overproduction of proinflammatory cytokines such as stroke, brain trauma, and multiple sclerosis (6Dore S. Kar S. Quirion R. Trends Neurosci. 1997; 20: 326-331Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar, 7Feldman E.L. Sullivan K.A. Kim B. Russell J.W. Neurobiol. Dis. 1997; 4: 201-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Moreover, IGF-I therapy dramatically reduces reactive astrocytosis following neuronal damage in the cerebellum (8Fernandez A.M. Garcia-Estrada J. Garcia-Segura L.M. Torres- Aleman I. Neuroscience. 1997; 76: 117-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), presumably by limiting the glial reaction and the progression of inflammation. Thus, it is likely that the benefits obtained by IGF-I treatment in these pathological conditions results from its direct action on neuronal survival and an inhibition of the glial inflammatory reaction. Expression of multiple genes implicated in inflammation, including proinflammatory cytokines and their receptors, is under the transcriptional control of the transcription factor nuclear factor κB (NFκB) (9Baeuerle P.A. Baltimore D. Cell. 1996; 87: 13-20Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2910) Google Scholar). In resting cells NFκB (formed by a dimmer of p50 and p65 subunits) is located in the cytoplasm where it is associated with its inhibitory subunit, IκB. Proinflammatory cytokines such as TNFα or IL-1 induce site-specific serine phosphorylation of IκB through a signaling cascade involving the serine kinases NFκB-inducing kinase and IκB kinase (IKK). Serine phosphorylation of IκB induces its ubiqinitation and degradation by the 26 S proteosome. Loss of IκB from the complex exposes the nuclear location sequence of NFκB resulting in translocation of this molecule to the nucleus where it binds to specific DNA motifs (10Mercurio F. Manning A.M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 226-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar). Recently, an alternative mechanism has been reported to regulate NFκB translocation. In Jurkat T cells, pervanadate stimulates tyrosine phosphorylation of IκB, promoting its association with the Src homology 2 (SH2) domains of p85, one of the PI3-kinase regulatory subunits. The binding of p85 to IκB displaces NFκB which is then translocated to the nucleus (11Beraud C. Henzel W.J. Baeuerle P.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 429-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). However, no growth factor or cytokine has yet been reported to utilize this mechanism. In the present work, we demonstrate that NFκB nuclear translocation in astrocytes is modulated by opposing signals that regulate serine phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of IκB. Furthermore, we show that IGF-I activates a phosphatase activity that dephosphorylates the basal and TNFα-induced phosphorylation (Ser32) of IκB. Finally, using specific phosphatase inhibitors, we demonstrate that calcineurin, but not PP2A or PP1, mediates IGF-I-induced dephosphorylation of IκB through a PI3-kinase and MAPK independent mechanism that requires intracellular calcium signaling. In view of these results, we hypothesize that the neuroprotective effects of IGF-I are based upon its known capacity to promote neuronal survival and on the novel concept that this factor reduces glial inflammatory response by inhibiting NFκB activation as induced by proinflammatory cytokines. Phosphospecific antibodies that recognize the activated forms of IκBα (phospho-Ser32 of IκBα), Akt (phospho-Ser473 of Akt), and MAPK (phospho-Thr202/Tyr204 of p44/42 MAPK) were purchased from New England Biolabs. Antibodies specific for IκBα (SC371) and NFκB (SC109) were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc. A monoclonal antibody against glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) was from Sigma, and Alexa-conjugated anti-mouse and anti-rabbit secondary antibodies were from Molecular Probes. The PI3-kinase inhibitor LY294002, the MEK inhibitor PD098059, the cell-permeable calcium chelator BAPTA-AM, okadaic acid, and cyclosporin A were all purchased from Calbiochem. Primary astroglial cultures were prepared as described previously (12Pons S. Torres-Aleman I. Endocrinology. 1992; 131: 2271-2278Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Briefly, P3 brains were dissected under aseptic conditions and immersed in ice cold Earle's balanced salt solution (Life Technologies, Inc.). Cerebellum, brain stem, and all meningeal membranes were carefully removed and discarded. The tissue was cut into 1-mm pieces using thin tweezers. Tissue fragments were washed once with fresh Earle's balanced salt solution and incubated with 2 ml of 1× trypsin-EDTA dissociation solution (Life Technologies, Inc.) for 20 min at 37 °C, 100 units/ml DNase I was added, and the tissue was dispersed with a fire-polished Pasteur pipette. Cell preparations were then centrifuged at 800 rpm for 10 min and plated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium-F12 containing 10% fetal calf serum. Cells were plated on 20-mm coverslips and cultured for 10 days as described above. Cells were then serum-starved for 4 h and immediately following different treatments, fixed with cold 4% paraformaldehyde. Cells were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1% Triton X-100 (PBT) and incubated with the antibodies (a rabbit polyclonal anti-NFκB and a mouse monoclonal anti-GFAP) diluted 1:1000 in PBT containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin overnight at 4 °C. Cells were then washed three times in PBT and incubated for 1 h at room temperature with the secondary antibodies: an anti-rabbit IgG-Alexa 488 (green) or anti-mouse IgG-Alexa 594 (red). Subsequently, coverslips were washed three times with PBT, rinsed in water, and mounted with moviol. Cell counting and pictures were performed in a Leica microscope using a green-red double filter. Immunoprecipitations were performed as described previously (13Pons S. Asano T. Glasheen E. Miralpeix M. Zhang Y. Fisher T.L. Myers Jr., M.G. Sun X.J. White M.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4453-4465Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). Ten-day-old astroglial cultures were serum-starved for 4 h and immediately after treatments, lysed with 150 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 mg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, using 1 ml of buffer per 10-cm dish. Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation, and supernatants were incubated overnight with the antibodies. Immunocomplexes were collected with Protein A-Sepharose 6MB (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for 1 h at 4 °C. Immunoprecipitates were washed three times in homogenization buffer before separation by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. After blocking for 1 h with 8% nonfat dry milk in TTBS (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 m NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20), membranes were incubated overnight with the different antibodies in TTBS, washed, and incubated with protein A-horseradish peroxidase (Pierce). The blots were developed with the ECL system. Multiple exposures of each blot were collected to ensure linearity and to match control levels for quantification. All the values presented in the bar graphs represent the mean ± S.E. A one-way analysis of variance followed by a post hoc Neuman-Keuls test was used when comparing several groups. Only values of p < 0.05 were considered as significant. IGF-I has been reported to exert antiapoptotic and neuroprotective effects in different primary neuronal cultures and neuronal cell lines (5Dudek H. Datta S.R. Franke T.F. Birnbaum M.J. Yao R. Cooper G.M. Segal R.A. Kaplan D.R. Greenberg M.E. Science. 1997; 275: 661-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (2212) Google Scholar, 6Dore S. Kar S. Quirion R. Trends Neurosci. 1997; 20: 326-331Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Moreover, in the GT1–7 neuronal line, IGF-I-mediated neuroprotection against oxidative stress is associated with activation of NFκB (14Heck S. Lezoualc'h F. Engert S. Behl C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9828-9835Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). However, in glial cells where NFκB mediates the action of proinflammatory cytokines (15Sparacio S.M. Zhang Y. Vilcek J. Benveniste E.N. J. Neuroimmunol. 1992; 39: 231-242Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 16Moynagh P.N. Williams D.C. O'Neill L.A. Biochem. J. 1993; 294: 343-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), IGF-I reduces glial inflammation after brain injury (8Fernandez A.M. Garcia-Estrada J. Garcia-Segura L.M. Torres- Aleman I. Neuroscience. 1997; 76: 117-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Based on this apparent biological contradiction, we postulated that IGF-I might differentially regulate the NFκB pathway in astrocytes as compared with neurons. Thus, to study the effects of IGF-I on NFκB activation in glial cells, confluent 10-day-old, astroglial cultures were deprived of serum for 4 h and stimulated with 100 nmIGF-I for 5, 15, and 30 min. Cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with antibodies against IκBα. The immunocomplexes were collected with Protein A-Sepharose, split, and separated by two parallel SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis gels. The resulting nitrocellulose membranes were probed with either phosphospecific anti-IκBα (phospho-Ser32) or anti-IκBα antibodies. Western blotting revealed that in astrocyte cultures IGF-I did not stimulate site-specific serine phosphorylation of IκBα; on the contrary, IGF-I induced a pronounced but transitory dephosphorylation of phospho-Ser32 IκBα (Fig. 1). This result sharply contrasts the effect of IGF-I in neurons where it induces IκB degradation presumably based on serine phosphorylation of this molecule (14Heck S. Lezoualc'h F. Engert S. Behl C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9828-9835Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). As discussed above, serine phosphorylation of IκB initiates a cascade of events that leads to IκB degradation and the consequent translocation of NFκB to the nucleus where it activates transcription of downstream genes. NFκB is strongly activated by proinflammatory cytokines like TNFα, a key suspect in the development of some neurodegenerative diseases and in neurological damage after brain lesions (17Perry S.W. Hamilton J.A. Tjoelker L.W. Dbaibo G. Dzenko K.A. Epstein L.G. Hannun Y. Whittaker J.S. Dewhurst S. Gelbard H.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17660-17664Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 18Knoblach S.M. Fan L. Faden A.I. J. Neuroimmunol. 1999; 95: 115-125Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Moreover, it is well documented that IGF-I functions as a neuroprotective factor following cellular insults, both in vitro and in vivo (14Heck S. Lezoualc'h F. Engert S. Behl C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9828-9835Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar, 19Fernandez A.M. Gonzalez de la Vega A.G. Planas B. Torres-Aleman I. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1999; 11: 2019-2030Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Thus, we reasoned that IGF-I-induced dephosphorylation of Ser32 of IκBα might ultimately prevent NFκB activation triggered by the cytokines released in response to brain injury. To address this question, we next studied the effects of IGF-I on TNFα-induced activation of IκBα. TNFα conveys proinflammatory and proapoptotic effects in different tissues and cell cultures where it induces NFκB activity through a site-specific (Ser32) phosphorylation of IκB (10Mercurio F. Manning A.M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 226-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar). Thus, to study the potential of IGF-I to modulate TNFα-induced NFκB activation, we evaluated the effect of this factor on the TNFα-induced serine phosphorylation of IκBα. Serum-starved astroglial cultures were treated with IGF-I, TNFα, or both factors for 5 or 15 min. Cultures were lysed and immunoprecipitated with anti-IκBα and then blotted with anti-phosphospecific IκBα or anti-IκBα. Similar to observations in other cell systems (10Mercurio F. Manning A.M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 226-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar), TNFα stimulated IκBα serine phosphorylation by almost 2-fold in astrocytes (Fig. 2 A). Interestingly, IGF-I significantly decreased not only the basal phosphorylation of Ser32 in IκBα but also that induced by TNFα (Fig. 2 A). Consistent with the dephosphorylation kinetics presented in Fig. 1, IGF-I reduced the TNFα−stimulated IκBα serine phosphorylation to below control levels following 5 min of treatment, with the effect being less robust after 15 min. Stimulation of IκBα serine phosphorylation by TNFα induces its degradation and subsequent translocation of NFκB to the nucleus. In the cultures employed for this study, TNFα-induced degradation of IκBα was apparent after 15 min of treatment (Fig. 2 A). After 1 h of treatment, TNFα reduced IκBα to below detectable levels (Fig. 2 B). However, IGF-I fully protected IκB from TNFα-induced degradation at 15 min (Fig. 2 A) and partially at 1 h of treatment (Fig. 2 B). Interestingly, after 1 h, prevention of degradation by IGF-I was not accompanied by a decrease in serine phosphorylation of IκBα as detected at 15 min. On the contrary, long term exposure to both IGF-I and TNFα coincided with an accumulation of serine-phosphorylated IκBα (Fig. 2 B). These results suggest a two-step mechanism by which the initial dephosphorylation evoked by IGF-I prevents the entrance of phosphoserine-IκBα into the degradation pathway, indicating that regulation of degradation is not solely dependent on the serine phosphorylation status of IκBα.Figure 2IGF-I acutely reduces TNFα−induced site-specific phosphorylation of IκBα and long term protects it from degradation. A,serum-deprived astroglial cultures were treated with 100 nmIGF-I (I), 10 ng/ml TNFα (T), or both (I+T) for 5 or 15 min. Lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-IκBα and blotted with phosphospecific anti-IκBα (P-IκBα) and anti-IκBα antibodies. The graph represents the mean ± S.E. of three independent experiments *, p< 0.01; **, p < 0.005. B, experimental conditions were identical to those in A but cells received 1 h of treatment. Treatment with the different factors was initiated after 3 h of starvation to maintain the standard 4 h of serum starvation used in all experiments. The bar graphrepresents the mean ± S.E. of four independent experiments. *,p < 0.01. C and D, lysates were generated as in Fig. 1 and immunoprecipitated with antibodies against IκBα (C) or against p85(PI3-kinase) (D). The resulting nitrocellulose membranes were sequentially blotted with antibodies against IκBα and p85. This experiment was repeated three times with similar results.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Previous studies have shown that pervanadate stimulates association of IκBα with p85 PI3-kinase and thus protects it from degradation (11Beraud C. Henzel W.J. Baeuerle P.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 429-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). Thus, we examined the ability of IGF-I to promote formation of such complexes in astrocytes. In parallel with the protection of IκBα from degradation, IGF-I stimulated the association of IκBα to p85 (Fig. 2 C) in our studies. Thus, it is likely that association of IκBα with p85 contributes to the protective effects elicited by IGF-I upon the degradation of this molecule. However, it is also reported (11Beraud C. Henzel W.J. Baeuerle P.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 429-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar) that p85 binding to IκBα displaces NFκB, which is then translocated to the nucleus. Thus, the fact that IGF-I induced IκBα association to p85 but also inhibited NFκB translocation to the nucleus in astrocytes (shown in Fig. 3) suggests that this factor utilizes additional mechanisms to prevent the nuclear translocation of the released NFκB in our cell system. Site-specific serine phosphorylation of IκB triggers the cascade of events that ultimately lead to NFκB translocation to the nucleus. Since we observed that TNFα-mediated serine phosphorylation of IκBα was significantly reduced by IGF-I treatment, we next evaluated whether the nuclear translocation of NFκB was also modulated by this growth factor. For this purpose, serum-starved astroglial cultures were treated with TNFα or with TNFα plus IGF-I for 15 or 30 min. After fixation, cells were double-stained with NFκB (p65) and the astrocyte marker GFAP. Using a red-green double filter, we detected TNFα−induced nuclear translocation of NFκB in some cells following 15 min of treatment (not shown), but the translocation was more uniform after 30 min (Fig. 3). Interestingly, nuclear localization of NFκB induced by TNFα treatment was greatly reduced by addition of IGF-I (Fig. 3). Additionally, TNFα stimulated NFκB translocation to the nucleus only in GFAP-positive cells, whereas the small percentage of cells not stained with GFAP (5–10% of the cells are typically not labeled with GFAP in these cultures) did not respond to TNFα although they show abundant cytoplasmic NFκB staining (Fig. 3). Our results demonstrate that the IGF-I-mediated prevention of IκB degradation in TNFα-treated cells correlates with a reduction of NFκB nuclear translocation. The observation that NFκB is not translocated to the nucleus in response to TNFα in GFAP negative cells supports the idea that the actions of proinflammatory cytokines may be cell type-dependent. For example, in neurons TNFα induces apoptosis (4Venters H.D. Tang Q. Liu Q. VanHoy R.W. Dantzer R. Kelley K.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 9879-9884Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar), whereas in astrocytes this cytokine induces the expression of proinflammatory molecules (20Akama K.T. Van Eldik L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7918-7924Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). The balance between kinase-phosphatase activities represents one of the most powerful control mechanisms in cell signaling and has been described in the regulation of many signal transduction pathways (21Keyse S.M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 186-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (700) Google Scholar). Several factors have been reported to enhance phosphorylation of IκB at Ser32 (10Mercurio F. Manning A.M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 226-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar, 22Ozes O.N. Mayo L.D. Gustin J.A. Pfeffer S.R. Pfeffer L.M. Donner D.B. Nature. 1999; 401: 82-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (1866) Google Scholar). However, our results are the first report of a factor that stimulates IκB Ser32 dephosphorylation. To examine the molecular nature of the phosphatase implicated in this process, the effect of IGF-I on IκB serine phosphorylation was studied in the presence of several specific serine phosphatase inhibitors. Okadaic acid was used at 0.5 nm to specifically inhibit PP2A and at 5 nm to inhibit PP2A and PP1. Cyclosporin was used at 500 nm to inhibit calcineurin (PP2B). The astroglial cultures were pretreated for 30 min with the phosphatase inhibitors. Cells were then stimulated with IGF-I for 5 min and lysed. Lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-IκBα antibodies and blotted with anti-phosphospecific IκB or anti-IκBα. Parallel gels containing total cell lysates were blotted with anti-phosphospecific Akt and anti-phosphospecific MAPK to monitor the possible effects of phosphatase inhibitors on IGF-I signaling. Okadaic acid, at either 0.5 or 5 nm, did not suppress IGF-I-induced IκB serine dephosphorylation (Fig. 4 A). However, when used at 5 nm it increased basal IκB Ser phosphorylation by 2.5-fold. Interestingly, MAPK but not Akt phosphorylation was also increased by inhibition of PP1 (Fig. 4 A). These results indicate that although PP1 is not the phosphatase activated by IGF-I it may have a role in the serine phosphorylation status of IκB. The fact that PP1 inhibition increased both IκBα and MAPK Ser phosphorylation suggests an action of this phosphatase on a common upstream kinase such as mitogen-activated protein kinase/ERK kinase kinase 1, 2, and 3 (MEKK1, -2, -3) (23Lee F.S. Hagler J. Chen Z.J. Maniatis T. Cell. 1997; 88: 213-222Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar, 24Zhao Q. Lee F.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8355-8358Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar) rather than a direct action on IκBα and MAPK. In contrast, IGF-I-stimulated dephosphorylation of IκBα serine residues was abolished when calcineurin was specifically inhibited with cyclosporin (Fig. 4 B). Moreover, consistent with its substrate specificity for calcineurin (25O'Keefe S.J. Tamura J. Kincaid R.L. Tocci M.J. O'Neill E.A. Nature. 1992; 357: 692-694Crossref PubMed Scopus (779) Google Scholar), cyclosporin did not alter the basal or IGF-I-stimulated levels of Akt and MAPK activation (Fig. 4 B). The fact that cyclosporin treatment did not modify basal IκBα serine phosphorylation indicates that, in contrast to PP1, calcineurin has a very low basal activity. Thus, stimulation of this phosphatase by IGF-I represents a very powerful mechanism to control NFκB-mediated inflammation progression. Given this potential mechanism of regulation, it would be interesting to determine whether IκBα dephosphorylation, mediated by calcineurin or any other phosphatase, is a common mechanism used by IGF-I and anti-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-4 or IL-6. IGF-I shares components of signaling cascades, including the tyrosine phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate proteins, with these anti-inflammatory cytokines (26White M.F. Recent Prog. Horm. Res. 1998; 53: 119-138PubMed Google Scholar). Following activation of the IGF-I receptor, this kinase recruits and phosphorylates tyrosine residues in several signaling molecules. Phosphorylation of Src homologous and collagen and the insulin receptor substrate proteins activates MAPK and PI3-kinase pathways (26White M.F. Recent Prog. Horm. Res. 1998; 53: 119-138PubMed Google Scholar). Although other signaling molecules are engaged by the IGF-I receptor (27Le Roith D. Koval A.P. Butler A.A. Yakar S. Karas M. Stannard B. Blakesley V.A. Takano K. Hizuka N. Takahashi S.I. Molecular Mechanisms to Regulate the Activities of Insulin-like Growth Factors. Elsevier Science Publishing Co., Inc., New York1998: 285-291Google Scholar), most of the cellular actions of IGF-I depend on activation of these two pathways. Moreover, c-Jun N-terminal kinase, activated by inflammatory cytokines and cellular stress, has been reported to be inhibited by IGF-I. Although the precise mechanisms by which IGF-I suppresses c-Jun N-terminal kinase activity are not known, a central role of PI3-kinase and Akt in this effect has been well established (28Okubo Y.

To assess the role of MAPK and PI3-kinase signaling pathways in IGF-I-induced IκBα dephosphorylation, we studied the effect of IGF-I on IκBα Ser phosphorylation in the presence of LY294002 and PD098059, compounds that specifically block PI3-kinase and MAPKK (MEK), respectively (Fig. 5 A). By immunoblotting, levels of P-MAPK and P-Akt were evaluated to monitor activation of PI3-kinase and MAPK pathways. As expected the inhibitors specifically abolished IGF stimulation of both these pathways; however, the IGF-I-mediated dephosphorylation of IκBα was not affected by these agents. Interestingly, PD098059 alone induced a reduction of IκBα serine phosphorylation and produced an additive effect when used together with IGF-I, suggesting independent mechanisms for these pathways. These results demonstrate that IGF-I activation of calcineurin is not mediated by PI3-kinase or by MEK. In an effort to further explore the mechanism by which IGF-I stimulates calcineurin pathways, we next tested the effects of SB203580 and U-73122, pharmacological inhibitors that specifically block p38 and phospholipase Cγ, respectively. Unfortunately inhibition of either p38 or phospholipase Cγ activity had no effect on IGF-I-induced IκBα dephosphorylation (data not shown). Calcineurin has been shown recently to mediate IGF-I-dependent skeletal muscle hypertrophy in myocyte cultures (29Musaro A. McCullagh K.J. Naya F.J. Olson E.N. Rosenthal N. Nature. 1999; 400: 581-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (546) Google Scholar, 30Semsarian C. Wu M.J. Ju Y.K. Marciniec T. Yeoh T. Allen D.G. Harvey R.P. Graham R.M. Nature. 1999; 400: 576-581Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). In these cells, IGF-I activates calcineurin by increasing intracellular Ca2+ through a PI3-kinase/MEK independent mechanism. In muscle, activated calcineurin dephosphorylates the transcription factor NT-ATc1 which is then translocated to the nucleus (30Semsarian C. Wu M.J. Ju Y.K. Marciniec T. Yeoh T. Allen D.G. Harvey R.P. Graham R.M. Nature. 1999; 400: 576-581Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar), a mechanism that very much resembles the IGF-I-induced IκBα dephosphorylation reported in the present work. To explore the possibility that, as seen in muscle cells, IGF-I could be activating calcineurin by increasing intracellular Ca2+, we tested the effects of BAPTA-AM, an intracellular calcium chelator, on IGF-I action in our astrocyte cultures (Fig. 5 B). Chelation of intracellular calcium with BAPTA-AM had the same effect as the pharmacological inhibition of calcineurin with cyclosporin; stimulation with IGF-I failed to mediate serine dephosphorylation of IκB without affecting the normal IGF-I activation of MAPK and Akt. These results suggest that IGF-I stimulation of IκB dephosphorylation relies on a mechanism that involves regulation of intracellular calcium levels. Consistent with this, phosphatase activity of calcineurin is dependent upon calcium and calmodulin (31Klee C.B. Ren H. Wang X. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13367-13370Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (786) Google Scholar). Elevation of intracellular calcium is required in many systems for cell growth and expression of several cytokine genes. Although some recent reports propose a direct regulation of a Ca2+ channel by the IGF-I receptor (32Bence-Hanulec K.K. Marshall J. Blair L.A. Neuron. 2000; 27: 121-131Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), there is no clear evidence to support this model in glial cells. Nevertheless, our current working hypothesis is that IGF-I alters intracellular calcium levels, thereby regulating the activity of calcineurin and its dephosphorylation of IκB. Thus, ongoing studies in our laboratory are directed at defining the precise mechanism by which IGF-I regulates calcineurin activity and the dephosphorylation of IκB. Based on these recent observations, our future efforts will also include studies of the effects of IGF-I on intracellular calcium in astrocytes. Also noteworthy from these studies was the reduction in basal serine phosphorylation of IκBα when MEK was inhibited with PD098059. This observation suggests that IκBα itself or one of its upstream kinases might be a target of MEK. MEK has been reported to participate in IκBα Ser phosphorylation. Different signaling pathways have been implicated in the phosphorylation of IκBα in various cell systems. In HeLa cells, site-specific phosphorylation of IκBα through the activation of its upstream kinases IKKα and IKKβ can be achieved by different pathways, whereas TNFα activates IKKα and IKKβ by stimulating PI3-kinase and its downstream Ser/Thr kinase Akt (22Ozes O.N. Mayo L.D. Gustin J.A. Pfeffer S.R. Pfeffer L.M. Donner D.B. Nature. 1999; 401: 82-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (1866) Google Scholar). In this same cell system, IKKα and IKKβ can also be activated by MAPK/ERK pathways (23Lee F.S. Hagler J. Chen Z.J. Maniatis T. Cell. 1997; 88: 213-222Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar, 24Zhao Q. Lee F.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8355-8358Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). It is also important to note the possible roles that Akt may be playing in NFκB activation. In human fibroblasts (33Romashkova J.A. Makarov S.S. Nature. 1999; 401: 86-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (1654) Google Scholar), Akt induces a robust NFκB activation by stimulating IκBα Ser phosphorylation. However, here we demonstrate that in astrocytes, although it is strongly activated by IGF-I, Akt seems not to participate in IκBα Ser phosphorylation status since no modification of IκBα phosphorylation levels were observed when Akt activation is blocked by PI3-kinase inhibitors. In conclusion, we have identified a novel mechanism by which IGF-I modulates the inflammatory pathways of TNFα in astrocyte cultures. Given the central importance of inflammation processes in brain trauma and neurodegenerative diseases, our findings, which connect the IGF-I signaling pathway with NFκB function, may direct the development of new treatments to reduce the neurological damage associated with inflammation.

However, apart from the established basal archaeal transcription system, little is known about the modulation of gene expression in archaea. At present, no obvious eukaryal-like transcriptional regulators have been identified in archaea. Instead, we have previously isolated an archaeal gene, the Pyrococcus furiosus lrpA, that potentially encodes a bacterial-like transcriptional regulator. In the present study, we have for the first time addressed the actual involvement of an archaeal Lrp homologue in transcription modulation. For that purpose, we have produced LrpA in Escherichia coli. In a cell-free P. furiosus transcription system we used wild-type and mutated lrpA promoter fragments to demonstrate that the purified LrpA negatively regulates its own transcription. In addition, gel retardation analyses revealed a single protein-DNA complex, in which LrpA appeared to be present in (at least) a tetrameric conformation. The location of the LrpA binding site was further identified by DNaseI and hydroxyl radical footprinting, indicating that LrpA binds to a 46-base pair sequence that overlaps the transcriptional start site of its own promoter. The molecular basis of the transcription inhibition by LrpA is discussed. The archaeal transcriptional initiation machinery closely resembles core elements of the eukaryal polymerase II system.

TATA-binding protein archaeal homologue of transcription factor IIB TFB-responsive element base pair(s) polymerase chain reaction polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis dimethylsuberimidate 3-(cyclohexylamino)propanesulfonic acid Recent studies have revealed that the archaeal transcriptional machinery represents a simplified version of the eukaryal RNA polymerase II transcription apparatus, which involves homologues of the TATA-binding protein (TBP),1the transcription factor IIB (TFIIB; the archaeal homologue is called TFB), and the multi-subunit RNA polymerase II (for a recent review, see Ref. 1Bell S.D. Jackson S.P. Trends Microbiol. 1998; 6: 222-228Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). The initiation process starts when the TBP interacts specifically with the core promoter element, the TATA box, which is located at positions −25 to −30 relative to the transcriptional start site (+1). This complex is stabilized by TFB, which interacts with TBP as well as with the nucleotides −42 to −19 that flank the TATA box (2Hausner W. Wettach J. Hethke C. Thomm M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30144-30148Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). In particular, a sequence upstream of the TATA box (called the TFB-responsive element or BRE) is essential for transcriptional polarity (3Littlefield O. Korkhin Y. Sigler P.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 13668-13673Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 4Bell S.D. Kosa P.L. Sigler P.B. Jackson S.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 13662-13667Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Formation of this pre-initiation complex results in recruitment of the RNA polymerase complex (1Bell S.D. Jackson S.P. Trends Microbiol. 1998; 6: 222-228Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Although important progress has recently been made with the elucidation of the archaeal transcriptional mechanism, very little is yet known about the actual regulation of this process. A limited number of studies reported that expression of genes involved in nitrogen metabolism, methanogenesis, and sugar metabolism are subject to substrate-dependent regulation at the transcriptional level (5Cohen-Kupiec R. Blank C. Leigh J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1316-1320Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 6Cohen-Kupiec R. Marx C.J. Leigh J.A. J.

Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 3777-3783Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Unfortunately, data about the molecular mechanisms underlying this regulation are still scarce. One of the few transcriptional regulators that have recently been studied in more detail concerns GvpE, an activator that is required for the expression of genes involved in gas vesicle synthesis in halophilic archaea. In a molecular modeling study, GvpE has been proposed to resemble a eukaryal leucine-zipper dimer that might interact with a palindrome sequence of its target promoter centered 40–50 bp upstream of the transcriptional start site (10Krüger K. Hermann T. Armbruster V. Pfeifer F. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 279: 761-771Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Another putative transcriptional regulator that has been studied in more detail is Tfx from Methanobacterium thermoautotrophicum (11Hochheimer A. Hedderich R. Thauer R.K. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 32: 641-650Crossref Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Thetfx-encoding gene is located upstream of the operon encoding molybdenum formylmethanofuran dehydrogenase (fmdECB). Tfx binds to a site located 167 bp downstream of the transcriptional start site of fmdE. It was proposed that Tfx is a transcriptional activator required for the expression of fmdECB. Obvious homologues of Tfx can only be found within the domain of the archaea. Analysis of the available archaeal genomic sequences shows that the majority of the identified homologues of regulators are bacterial-like (12Kyrpides N.C. Ouzounis C.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 8545-8550Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Recently a mechanism by which a bacterial-like regulator affects the archaeal transcriptional machinery was described. It was shown that MDR1 from Archaeoglobus fulgidus, a homologue of the iron-dependent bacterial repressor DxtR, represses transcription by binding to its own promoter in a metal-dependent manner. Upon binding of MDR1 to the promoter, RNA polymerase recruitment is prevented but not binding of TBP or TFB (13Bell S.D. Cairns S.S. Robson R.L. Jackson S.P. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 971-982Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). One particular group of bacterial-like regulators present in all available archaeal genomes is the family of Lrp/AsnC regulators. Members of this family have been identified in more than a dozen different bacterial species, in which they generally appear to be involved in regulation of amino acid metabolism. The most extensively studied example is the leucine-responsive regulatory protein (Lrp) fromEscherichia coli (14Calvo J.M. Matthews R.G. Microbiol. Rev. 1994; 58: 466-490Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15Newman E.B. Lin R. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1995; 49: 747-775Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Lrp is a global regulator that controls the expression of approximately 75 genes, many of which are involved in transport, degradation, or biosynthesis of amino acids. Lrp can either activate or repress transcription, and this action can be modulated by the effector leucine, which either decreases or increases its particular action. In some cases, like the negative autoregulation, leucine has no effect at all. The paralogous E. coli AsnC appears to be a specific transcriptional activator of asparagine synthetase A. Activation is reduced in the presence of the effector asparagine, but again, the negative autoregulation of AsnC itself is not affected by asparagine (16Kolling R. Lother H. J. Bacteriol. 1985; 164: 305-310Crossref Google Scholar, 17de Wind N. de Jong M. Meijer M. Stuitje A.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1985; 13: 8797-8811Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Two Lrp/AsnC homologues fromSulfolobus solfataricus have been studied in more detail. One of these was cloned, sequenced, and shown to be expressed during growth on complex medium (18Charlier D. Roovers M. Thia-Toong T.L. Durbecq V. Glansdorff N. Gene. 1997; 201: 63-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The other Lrp/AsnC homologue, called Lrs14, was studied in more detail (19Napoli A. van der Oost J. Sensen C.W. Charlebois R.L. Rossi M. Ciaramella M. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 1474-1480Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It was shown that the purified recombinant protein binds to its promoter at a region overlapping the TATA box. In addition, it was shown that the lrs14transcript accumulates in the late growth stages of S. solfataricus. In the genome sequence of Pyrococcus furiosus (Center of Marine Biotechnology, University of Utah) at least 10 homologues of genes encoding Lrp/AsnC-like proteins can be identified. 2A. B. Brinkman and J. van der Oost, unpublished information. ThelrpA gene, encoding one of these homologues, was previously identified downstream of the gdh gene that encodes glutamate dehydrogenase (20Eggen R.I. Geerling A.C. Waldkotter K. Antranikian G. de Vos W.M. Gene. 1993; 132: 143-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 21Kyrpides N.C. Ouzounis C.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 140-141Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). In this paper, we describe the cloning, functional expression, and characterization of LrpA and show that LrpA binds to its own promoter and specifically inhibits in vitrotranscription from this promoter. Using the combined data of gel mobility shift assays, in vitro transcription analyses, and footprinting, we identified the sequence elements responsible for LrpA binding and propose a mechanism by which LrpA binds its promoter. Identification of LrpA homologues was done using the Advanced BLAST program at NCBI. Alignments were made using the program ClustalX. Motif searches were performed using the PROSITE Pattern and Profile Searches program at the ExPaSy Molecular Biology Server and the program HELIX-TURN-HELIX (32Dodd I.B. Egan J.B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 5019-5026Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar). Inverted repeats were identified using the GeneQuest program, which is part of the DNA Star package. The gene encodinglrpA was PCR-amplified using primers BG240 and BG241 (see Table I, italic and underlined sequences indicate the restriction sites BspHI and BamHI, respectively). The resulting 444-bp PCR fragment was cloned into pGEM-T (Promega Corp.), resulting in pLUW600, and the sequence of the insert was verified by DNA sequencing. Subsequently, pLUW600 was digested withBspHI and BamHI, and the resulting 428-bp fragment was cloned into the T7 expression vectors pGEF+ (22Rink R. Fennema M. Smids M. Dehmel U. Janssen D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14650-14657Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar), pET9d, and pET24d (23Studier F.W. Rosenberg A.H. Dunn J.J. Dubendorff J.W. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 185: 60-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (6005) Google Scholar) (Novagen, Inc.), resulting in the constructs pLUW601, pLUW604, and pLUW605, respectively. These constructs were transformed into E. coli BL21(DE3), BL21(DE3) (pLysS), and BL21(DE3) (pLysE) (Novagen, Inc.) and tested for expression (not shown). The optimal result was obtained with E. coli BL21(DE3) in combination with the pET9d-derivative pLUW604. This combination was used for further expression experiments. pLUW613 was made by cloning fragment A into pGEM-T (Promega, Corp.). Mutations in fragment A were introduced using Pfu polymerase in the PCR-based overlap extension method (24Higuchi R. Krummel B. Saiki R.K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 7351-7367Crossref PubMed Scopus (2102) Google Scholar). For each mutation a sense/antisense primer pair was designed. BG730 and BG731 introduced mutation 621; BG759 and BG760 introduced mutation 623; BG792 and BG793 introduced mutation 629; BG794 and BG795 introduced mutation 630 (see Table I). BG289 and BG290 were used as flanking primers for the PCR of fragment A (see below). All mutant fragments A were cloned into pGEM-T (Promega) and sequenced, resulting in pLUW621, pLUW623, pLUW629, and pLUW630.Figure 1A, sequence of thelrpA promoter.

The culture was inoculated withE. coli BL21(DE3) containing pLUW604. Cells were grown in a rotary shaker at 37 °C until an A600 of 0.5 was reached, and 0.4 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was added to induce expression. After overnight incubation, the cells were harvested, washed in 125 mm citrate buffer, pH 5.0 and resuspended in 90 ml of the same buffer. Cells were lysed by a triple passage through a French pressure cell at 1000 p.s.i. After lysis, MgCl2 and DNaseI were added to final concentrations of 10 mm and 10 μg/ml, respectively. The sample was left at room temperature for 15 min. Subsequently, the cell-free extract was incubated at 80 °C for 30 min and centrifuged at 20,000 rpm for 30 min. The remaining soluble fraction was loaded on a 60-ml cation exchange column (S-Sepharose, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) that had been equilibrated with 125 mm citrate buffer, pH 5.0. The column was eluted with the same buffer using a flow rate of 3 ml/min and a linear gradient of NaCl from 0 to 1 m. Fractions containing LrpA, as determined by SDS-PAGE, were pooled and concentrated by centrifugation in Centricon units (10-kDa cut off) until a volume of 0.5 ml was reached. A 200-μl sample was loaded on a gel filtration column (Superdex 200, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) with 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, and 100 mm NaCl with a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. The elution pattern from this gel filtration showed three peaks corresponding to molecular masses of approximately 30, 60, and 120 kDa, respectively. Approximately 14 mg of purified LrpA was obtained from one liter of culture. DNA probes used for gel mobility shift experiments were generated using PCR. The following primers were used: BG289 and BG290 for fragment A; BG367 and BG290 for fragment B; BG289 and BG431 for fragment C; BG430 and BG290 for fragment D; BG638 and BG498 for fragment E; BG638 and BG615 for fragment F; BG427 and BG109 for fragment G (see Table I). PCR reactions consisted of a 5-min denaturation step at 95 °C, 30 cycles consisting of 95, 45, and 72 °C, with 30 s for each step, followed by a 7-min final extension step at 72 °C. PCR products were end-labeled using T4 kinase and radioactive [γ-32P]ATP. Binding reactions were performed in a total volume of 20 μl containing 40 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.3, 200 mmKCl, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 2 mmdithiothreitol, 1 mm CaCl2, 100 mmEDTA, 10% glycerol, and varying concentrations of purified LrpA. Standard reactions contained 2 μg of poly(dI·dC)·poly(dI·dC) as nonspecific competitor DNA, but this was omitted from reactions with smaller fragments (fragment E and F) and during determination of the dissociation constant (Kd) for the LrpA-DNA complex. Each reaction contained 1 to 10 ng of [γ-32P]ATP end-labeled DNA. Reactions were incubated at room temperature for at least 10 min and separated on a non-denaturing 8% acrylamide gel buffered in 1× Tris borate EDTA buffer (25Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, New York1989Google Scholar). In the case of fragment E, a 20% gel was used. Gels were dried, exposed to phosphor screens, and analyzed. Quantification was done using ImageQuant software (Molecular Dynamics, Inc.). DNaseI and hydroxyl radical footprinting was performed using non-radioactive probes containing the IRD800 label in combination with a Li-Cor sequencer (Li-Cor, Inc.). For this purpose DNA probes were prepared as follows. Fragments B and G (see Fig. 1 B) were cloned into pGEM-T (Promega), and clones were selected containing the insert in both orientations. These constructs were used as a template in PCR reactions with a IRD800-labeled T7 primer (MWG-Biotech, GmbH) in combination with BG290, BG367, BG427, or BG109. These PCR reactions produced fragments B or G carrying the IRD800 label on a 68-bp extension originating from pGEM-T at the 5′ end of either the non-template or the template strand. 10 ng of this DNA was used per reaction. Binding reactions for DNaseI and hydroxyl radical footprinting were identical to the binding reaction conditions in gel mobility shift experiments (see above) except that glycerol and poly(dI·dC)·poly(dI·dC) were omitted. DNaseI cleavage was done by adding 20 μl of a solution containing 5 mmCaCl2, 10 mm MgCl2, and 2 milliunits of DNaseI. After 1 min the DNaseI reaction was stopped by the addition of 20 μl of 4 m ammonium acetate and 30 mm EDTA. The DNA was extracted with 60 μl of phenol, precipitated with 96% ethanol in the presence of 20 μg of glycogen, and washed with 70% ethanol. The pellet was dissolved in 1 μl of formamide loading buffer, heated at 95 °C for 5 min, and chilled on ice. Subsequently, 0.8 μl was analyzed on a Li-Cor 4000 sequencer using a 5.5% KBPlus 41-cm denaturing sequence gel (Li-Cor) with 0.2-mm spacers and settings 2000 V, 25 mA, 50 watt, and 45 °C. Hydroxyl radicals were generated by adding 3 μl of 40 mmsodium ascorbate, 3 μl of 1.2% H2O2, and 3 μl of 4 mm(NH4)2Fe(SO4)2·6H2O, 8 mm EDTA. After 2 min the reaction was stopped by the addition of 26 μl of 0.1 m thiourea, 20 mmEDTA. DNA was extracted with phenol, precipitated as described above, and analyzed on a Li-Cor 4000L sequencer (Li-Cor) using a 66-cm denaturing sequencing gel with 0.25-mm spacers and settings 2250 V, 30.6 mA, 68 watt, and 45 °C. Images of the footprints were analyzed using the program Scion Image for Windows, available from the National Institutes of Health. Transcription reactions were performed essentially as described previously (26Hethke C. Geerling A.C. Hausner W. de Vos W.M. Thomm M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 2369-2376Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) except that 300 mm KCl was used instead of 250 mm. A standard reaction mixture (50 μl) contained 1 μg of linearized template DNA (pLUW479 (26Hethke C. Geerling A.C. Hausner W. de Vos W.M. Thomm M.

This reaction mixture was incubated for 30 min at 70 °C. RNA purification and electrophoresis was performed as described previously (28Frey G. Thomm M. Brüdigam B. Gohl H.P. Hausner W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 1361-1367Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). For analysis of the in vitrotranscriptional start site, cell-free transcription reactions were performed as described above but with unlabeled precursors. In a control reaction, nucleotides were omitted from cell-free transcription reactions. The end-labeled DNA primer 5′-GTATAATTTTGTCTCTCTCATCA-3′ was used complementary to nucleotides +20 to +42 relative to the transcriptional start of lrpA. The primer extension assay was performed as described previously (26Hethke C. Geerling A.C. Hausner W. de Vos W.M. Thomm M.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 1361-1367Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). For determination of the in vivo transcriptional start site, primer extension was performed with total RNA of P. furiosus, which was isolated as described previously (29Ward D.E. Kengen S.W. van Der Oost J. de Vos W.M. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 2559-2566Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Chemical cross-linking was performed as described by Davies and Stark (30Davies G.E. Stark G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1970; 66: 651-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (719) Google Scholar), with the following modifications. For cross-linking experiments with free LrpA, different concentrations of LrpA were diluted in cross-linking buffer (80 mm triethanolamine-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mmdithiothreitol), and the final volume was adjusted to 16 μl. Dimethylsuberimidate (DMSI, 25 mg/ml freshly made in cross-linking buffer) was added to a final concentration of 5 mg/ml so that the final volume was 20 μl. After a 1-h incubation at room temperature, SDS-PAGE loading buffer (25Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, New York1989Google Scholar) was added, and 100 ng of each sample was separated on a 10% Tricine SDS-PAGE gel (31Schagger H. Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10480) Google Scholar). The separated proteins were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane by electroblotting in 10 mm CAPS, pH 11.0, and 10% methanol and detected immunologically using a polyclonal antiserum raised against purified LrpA (25Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, New York1989Google Scholar). For cross-linking experiments with LrpA-DNA complexes, about 2 μg of purified LrpA was incubated with 500 ng of DNA (fragment B, see Fig. 1 B) in cross-linking buffer in a final volume of 64 μl. DMSI was added as described above so that the final volume was 80 μl. The samples were loaded on a non-denaturing 5% acrylamide gel, buffered in 1× Tris borate EDTA buffer (25Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, New York1989Google Scholar). The gel was stained with ethidium bromide, bands representing specific DNA-LrpA complexes were excised and crushed, and SDS-PAGE loading buffer was added. The recovered samples were heated for 10 min at 100 °C and loaded on a 10% Tricine SDS-PAGE gel and analyzed as described above. A 2.7-kilobase HindIII fragment including the gene encoding glutamate dehydrogenase (gdh) was previously isolated from a genomic library ofP. furiosus (Fig. 1 B) (20Eggen R.I. Geerling A.C. Waldkotter K. Antranikian G. de Vos W.M. Gene. 1993; 132: 143-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Downstream of thegdh gene, an open reading frame was found with a high degree of similarity to bacterial transcription regulators of the Lrp/AsnC family (21Kyrpides N.C. Ouzounis C.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 140-141Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Sequence analysis of the lrpA gene identified a frame-shift in the previously published sequence (GenBankTMaccession number P42180), which introduced a stop codon after lysine 120 in the predicted protein sequence. The corrected P. furiosus lrpA gene is predicted to encode a 141-amino acid protein with a predicted molecular mass of 15.9 kDa. Subsequent BLAST analysis revealed that LrpA shares a high degree of similarity with many (hypothetical) regulatory proteins from a number of archaea includingPyrococcus horikoshii (93% identity), Pyrococcus abyssi (98% identity), Methanococcus jannaschii (54% identity), A. fulgidus (49% identity), M. thermoautotrophicum (37% identity), and S. solfataricus (32% identity, Fig. 2). In addition, all of these archaea contain a number of more distantly related homologues, e.g.in P. horikoshii a total of 9 genes appear to encode LrpA homologues, whereas P. furiosus itself contains at least 10 LrpA homologues. The best characterized LrpA homologues are from bacterial origin, in particular E. coli AsnC (33% identity) and E. coli Lrp (28% identity). A PROSITE pattern search with P. furiosus LrpA identified a putative helix-turn-helix motif of the Lrp/AsnC family (Fig. 2). This motif was also predicted by the program HELIX-TURN-HELIX (32Dodd I.B. Egan J.B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 5019-5026Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar). Using a PCR approach we cloned the lrpA gene into a pET9d vector, resulting in pLUW604. Production of LrpA was achieved after transformation of pLUW604 to E. coli BL21(λDE3). After overnight growth in the presence of 0.4 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside, cells were harvested and disrupted. Tricine-SDS-PAGE analysis of membrane and soluble fractions indicated that 50% of the produced LrpA was present as soluble protein (Figs. 3, lane 3, and 4). The soluble fraction containing LrpA was further subjected to a heat incubation of 30 min at 80 °C, resulting in the denaturation of most of the E. coli proteins (Fig. 3, lane 5). This heat-stable cell free extract was used for further purification by cation exchange chromatography and gel filtration chromatography (Fig. 3, lanes 6 and 7). The calculated molecular mass of LrpA is 15.9 kDa, which is in good agreement with its migration on SDS-PAGE (Fig. 3). Elution patterns from gel filtration showed peaks corresponding to molecular masses of approximately 30, 60, and 120 kDa. This suggests that LrpA exists as a dimer, tetramer, and octamer in solution. We performed several independent gel filtration experiments with LrpA, and the apparent oligomeric heterogeneity was always observed.Figure 4Analysis of the transcription start site of the lrpA promoter in vitro by primer extension.

Lane 1, control experiment (nucleotides omitted from transcription reaction); lane 2, analysis of the primer extension product.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) We used primer extension analysis to map the transcriptional start site for lrpA. Using in vitro generated run-off transcript RNA (see below), we found that the transcriptional start was located at an adenosine located 14 bp upstream the translational start (see Fig. 1 A). We compared the lrpA promoter sequence to other known promoter sequences from P. furiosus. Although only 14 Pyrococcus promoters have been mapped to date, a clear consensus sequence can be derived for the PyrococcusBRE and TATA elements: AAAnnTTTWWWWW (−35 to −23 sequence relative to the transcriptional start (+1), where n = any base, and W = A or T). The putative BRE and TATA elements of thelrpA promoter match well with the consensus sequence mentioned above (see Fig. 1 A). We used total isolated RNA from P. furiosus grown on cellobiose, pyruvate, and tryptone to determine the transcriptional start in vivo. In all cases the transcriptional start was identical to that found with in vitro generated RNA (not shown); however, relatively weak signals were obtained. Although the results showed that lrpA is expressed during growth on the above-mentioned substrates, they indicate that lrpAtranscript levels are not very abundant under these conditions.

Autosomal dominant limb-girdle muscular dystrophy (LGMD-1C) in humans is due to mutations (ΔTFT and Pro → Leu) within the CAV3 gene. We have shown that LGMD-1C mutations lead to formation of unstable aggregates of caveolin-3 that are retained intracellularly and are rapidly degraded. The mechanism by which LGMD-1C mutants of caveolin-3 are degraded remains unknown. Here, we show that LGMD-1C mutants of caveolin-3 undergo ubiquitination-proteasomal degradation. Treatment with proteasomal inhibitors (MG-132, MG-115, lactacystin, or proteasome inhibitor I), but not lysosomal inhibitors, prevented degradation of LGMD-1C caveolin-3 mutants. In the presence of MG-132, LGMD-1C caveolin-3 mutants accumulated within the endoplasmic reticulum and did not reach the plasma membrane. LGMD-1C mutants of caveolin-3 behave in a dominant negative fashion, causing intracellular retention and degradation of wild-type caveolin-3. Interestingly, in cells co-expressing wild-type and mutant forms of caveolin-3, MG-132 treatment rescued wild-type caveolin-3; wild-type caveolin-3 was not degraded and reached the plasma membrane.

The expression of caveolin-3 is induced during the differentiation of skeletal myoblasts, and caveolin-3 is localized to the muscle cell plasma membrane (sarcolemma) where it forms a complex with dystrophin and its associated glycoproteins (17Song K.S.

However, under certain conditions caveolin-3 can be physically separated from the dystrophin complex (18Crosbie R.H. Yamada H. Venzke D.P. Lisanti M.P. Campbell K.P. FEBS Lett. 1998; 427: 279-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar).

These caveolin family members all share three characteristic properties: (i) detergent insolubility at low temperatures; (ii) self-oligomerization; and (iii) incorporation into low density Triton-insoluble membrane fractions that are enriched in caveolae-membranes (28Song K.S.

The specialized lipid composition of caveolae is thought to convey resistance of this membrane domain to detergent solubilization by Triton X-100 (at low temperatures) (29Sargiacomo M. Sudol M.

For example, when intact cells were fixed in paraformaldehyde and extracted with Triton X-100 and then examined by electron microscopy, the insoluble membranes that remained were found to be caveolae (36Moldovan N. Heltianu C. Simionescu N. Simionescu M. Exp. Cell Res. 1995; 219: 309-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Caveolin-3 is most closely related to caveolin-1 based on protein sequence homology; caveolin-1 and caveolin-3 are ∼65% identical and ∼85% similar (see Tang et al. (15Tang Z. Scherer P.E. Okamoto T.

However, caveolin-3 mRNA is expressed predominantly in muscle tissue types (skeletal muscle, diaphragm, and heart) (15Tang Z. Scherer P.E. Okamoto T. Song K. Chu C. Kohtz D.S. Nishimoto I. Lodish H.F. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2255-2261Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (602) Google Scholar). Identification of a muscle-specific member of the caveolin gene family has implications for understanding the role of caveolins in different muscle cell types (smooth, cardiac, and skeletal), as previous morphological studies have demonstrated that caveolae are abundant in these cells. A number of studies have highlighted the importance of caveolae and caveolins in the pathogenesis of Duchenne's muscular dystrophy. More specifically, dystrophin has been localized to plasma membrane caveolae in smooth muscle cells using immuno-EM techniques (37North A.J. Galazkiewicz B. Byers T.J. Glenney J.R. Small J.V. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 1159-1167Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar), and skeletal muscle caveolae undergo characteristic changes in their size and distribution in patients with Duchenne's muscular dystrophy but not in other forms of neuronally based muscular dystrophies examined (38Bonilla E. Fishbeck K. Schotland D. Am. J. Pathol. 1981; 104: 167-173PubMed Google Scholar). This indicates that muscle cell caveolae may play an important role in muscle membrane biology. In collaboration with Minetti and colleagues (39Minetti C. Sotgia F. Bruno C. Scartezzini P. Broda P. Bado M. Masetti E. Mazzocco P. Egeo A. Donati M.A. Volonté D. Galbiati F. Cordone G. Bricarelli F.D. Lisanti M.P. Zara F. Nat. Genet. 1998; 18: 365-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar), we have recently identified an autosomal dominant form of limb-girdle muscular dystrophy (LGMD-1C)1 in two Italian families that is due to a deficiency in caveolin-3 expression. Analysis of their genomic DNA reveals two distinct mutations in the caveolin-3 gene as follows: (i) a 9-base pair micro-deletion that removes the sequence TFT from the caveolin-scaffolding domain, and (ii) a mis-sense mutation that changes a proline to a leucine (Pro → Leu) in the transmembrane domain (39Minetti C. Sotgia F. Bruno C. Scartezzini P. Broda P. Bado M. Masetti E. Mazzocco P. Egeo A. Donati M.A. Volonté D. Galbiati F. Cordone G. Bricarelli F.D. Lisanti M.P. Zara F. Nat. Genet. 1998; 18: 365-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar). Both mutations lead to a loss of ∼90–95% of caveolin-3 protein expression. Characterization of CAV3 lesions in these LGMD-1C families is instructive. Twelve amino acid residues are absolutely conserved in all three human caveolins as well as the two Caenorhabditis elegans caveolins (40Tang Z. Okamoto T. Boontrakulpoontawee P. Katada T. Otsuka A.J. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2437-2445Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), and the LGMD-1C mutants map to 2 of these 12 invariant residues, Pro104 and Phe64 (39Minetti C. Sotgia F. Bruno C. Scartezzini P. Broda P. Bado M. Masetti E. Mazzocco P. Egeo A. Donati M.A. Volonté D. Galbiati F. Cordone G. Bricarelli F.D. Lisanti M.P. Zara F. Nat. Genet. 1998; 18: 365-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar). In addition, alanine scanning mutagenesis of a peptide encoding the caveolin-scaffolding domain reveals that the FTV(T/S) sequence in caveolins 1 and 3 is important for recognition of caveolin binding, signaling proteins (41Couet J. Li S. Okamoto T. Ikezu T. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6525-6533Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (797) Google Scholar); the FT di-peptide of the FTVT/S sequence is deleted in one LGMD-1C family. This finding provides genetic evidence that this region of the caveolin-scaffolding domain is criticalin vivo. How do mutations in these invariant residues give rise to LGMD-1C? By using heterologous expression in NIH 3T3 cells, we demonstrated that down-regulation of the caveolin-3 protein in LGMD-1C may reflect the targeting of mis-folded caveolin-3 oligomers for degradation (42Galbiati F.

Both LGMD-1C mutants of caveolin-3 form unstable aggregates that are retained within the Golgi complex (42Galbiati F. Volonté D. Minetti C. Chu J.B. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol.

These data provide a molecular explanation for caveolin-3 down-regulation in patients with this form of limb-girdle muscular dystrophy. However, the mechanism(s) by which LGMD-1C mutants of caveolin-3 are degraded remain unknown. This may have important implications for the treatment of LGMD-1C patients, as these patients still retain one wild-type allele of caveolin-3. Here, we show that LGMD-1C mutants of caveolin-3 undergo ubiquitination/proteasomal degradation. Treatment with proteasomal inhibitors (MG-132, MG-115, lactacystin, or proteasome inhibitor I), but not lysosomal inhibitors, prevented degradation of LGMD-1C caveolin-3 mutants. Consistent with the idea that LGMD-1C mutants are mis-folded, conditions that facilitate protein folding (10% glycerol or 30 °C) also prevented degradation of LGMD-1C caveolin-3 mutants. Interestingly, in cells co-expressing wild-type and mutant forms of caveolin-3, MG-132 treatment rescued wild-type caveolin-3; under these conditions, wild-type caveolin-3 was not degraded and reached the plasma membrane. Thus, treatment with proteasomal inhibitors blocks the dominant negative effect of LGMD-1C mutants and rescues wild-type caveolin-3. This is the first demonstration that proteasomal degradation may be involved in a form of muscular dystrophy in humans.

All other biochemicals used were of the highest purity available and were obtained from regular commercial sources. NIH 3T3 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with glutamine, antibiotics (penicillin and streptomycin), and 10% donor bovine calf serum. Cells (∼30–50% confluent) were transfected using a modified calcium phosphate precipitation method. Thirty six hours post-transfection, cells were treated for 16 h with vehicle alone (Me2SO) or with one of the following proteasome inhibitors: MG-132 (5 or 10 μm), MG-115 (5 μm), lactacystin (20 μm), or proteasome inhibitor I (20 μm). Proteasome inhibitors were dissolved in Me2SO. Transfected NIH 3T3 cells were scraped in 2 ml of Mes-buffered saline containing 1% (v/v) Triton X-100. Homogenization was carried out with 10 strokes of a loose fitting Dounce homogenizer. The homogenate was adjusted to 40% sucrose by the addition of 2 ml of 80% sucrose prepared in Mes-buffered saline and placed at the bottom of an ultracentrifuge tube. A 5–30% linear sucrose gradient was formed above the homogenate and centrifuged at 39,000 rpm for 16–20 h in a SW41 rotor (Beckman Instruments). A light-scattering band confined to the 15–20% sucrose region was observed that contained endogenous caveolin-1 but excluded most of other cellular proteins. From the top of each gradient, 1-ml gradient fractions were collected to yield a total of 12 fractions. An equal amount of protein from each gradient fraction was separated by SDS-PAGE and subjected to immunoblot analysis. Cellular proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE (12.5% acrylamide) and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Blots were incubated for 2 h in TBST (10 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 0.2% Tween 20) containing 2% powdered skim milk and 1% bovine serum albumin. After three washes with TBST, membranes were incubated for 2 h with the primary antibody (∼1000-fold diluted in TBST) and for 1 h with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit/mouse IgG (∼5000-fold diluted). Proteins were detected using an ECL detection kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). NIH 3T3 cells grown on glass coverslips were washed three times with PBS and fixed for 30 min at room temperature with 2% paraformaldehyde in PBS. Fixed cells were rinsed with PBS and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.2% bovine serum albumin for 10 min. Then cells were treated with 25 mm NH4Cl in PBS for 10 min at room temperature to quench free aldehyde groups. Cells were rinsed with PBS and incubated with the primary antibodies for 1 h at room temperature (∼1000-fold diluted in PBS with 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.2% bovine serum albumin). After three washes with PBS (10 min each), cells were incubated with the secondary antibody for 1 h at room temperature, lissamine rhodamine B sulfonyl chloride-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibody (5 μg/ml)/fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibody (5 μg/ml). Finally, cells were washed three times with PBS (10 min each wash), and slides were mounted with slow-fade anti-fade reagent (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR) and observed under a Bio-Rad MR 600 confocal microscope. Cells were washed twice with PBS and lysed 30 min at 4 °C in a buffer containing 10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 60 mm octyl glucoside. Samples were pre-cleared for 1 h at 4 °C using protein A-Sepharose (20 μl, slurry 1:1) and subjected to overnight immunoprecipitation at 4 °C using anti-caveolin-3 antibody (10 μl, mAb) and protein A-Sepharose (30 μl, slurry 1:1). After three washes with the immunoprecipitation buffer, samples were separated by SDS-PAGE (12.5% acrylamide) and transferred to nitrocellulose. Blots were then probed with anti-HA tag antibody (pAb; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.). NIH 3T3 cells were co-transfected with C-terminally Myc-tagged WT caveolin-3 and three different N-terminally GFP-tagged caveolin-3 fusions as we previously described (42Galbiati F. Volonté D. Minetti C. Chu J.B. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25632-25641Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Myc-tagged caveolin-3 was visualized using pAb A-14 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) that is directed against the Myc epitope (EQKLISEEDLN). GFP-tagged caveolin-3 was detected as we previously described (42Galbiati F. Volonté D. Minetti C. Chu J.B. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol.

Twenty four hours post-transfection, cells were cultured for an additional 16 h at low temperature (30 °C) or with normal medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) glycerol at 37 °C; the expression of caveolin-3 was then assessed by immunoblotting. Control cells were cultured for the same amount of time at 37 °C and in the absence of glycerol. Autosomal dominant limb-girdle muscular dystrophy (LGMD-1C) in humans is due to mutations (ΔTFT and Pro → Leu) within the CAV3 gene (39Minetti C. Sotgia F. Bruno C. Scartezzini P. Broda P. Bado M.

We have shown that LGMD-1C mutations lead to formation of unstable aggregates of caveolin-3 that are retained intracellularly, and they have a dramatically shortened half-life of ∼45–60 min (42Galbiati F.

We previously generated and characterized the same two mutations in wild-type caveolin-3 that are seen in patients with limb-girdle muscular dystrophy 1C (LGMD-1C) (42Galbiati F. Volonté D.

Here, we have begun to evaluate the hypothesis that the lower protein expression of the LGMD-1C caveolin-3 mutants was due to protein degradation occurring through the proteasome pathway. For this purpose, we analyzed the effect of proteasome inhibitor treatment on the expression of the LGMD-1C caveolin-3 mutants. We transiently transfected NIH 3T3 cells with wild-type caveolin-3 or the corresponding LGMD-1C mutants (Pro → Leu and ΔTFT) and assessed their expression by Western blot analysis with a specific caveolin-3 monoclonal antibody probe (mAb 26) (Fig.1). Note that both mutant forms are expressed at significantly lower levels than achieved with wild-type caveolin-3. However, treatment for 16 h with MG-132 (10 μm) was sufficient to rescue the expression of both LGMD-1C caveolin-3 mutants.Figure 1Treatment with MG-132, a proteasome inhibitor, blocks the degradation of the LGMD-1C mutants of caveolin-3. Wild-type caveolin-3 (Cav-3) and caveolin-3 mutants (Pro → Leu or ΔTFT) were transiently expressed in NIH 3T3 cells. After treatment for 16 h with the vehicle alone (Me2SO, DMSO) or with MG-132 (10 μm), the expression of caveolin-3 was assessed by immunoblotting with a specific caveolin-3 monoclonal antibody probe (17Song K.S. Scherer P.E. Tang Z. Okamoto T. Li S. Chafel M. Chu C. Kohtz D.S. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol.

Interestingly, endogenous caveolin-1 expression was not modified by proteasome inhibitor treatment. These results suggest that the degradation is specific for LGMD-1C caveolin-3 mutants (Pro → Leu and ΔTFT) (Fig. 2), and occurs through the proteasome pathway. To assess whether other proteasomal inhibitors are capable of preventing the degradation of the LGMD-1C mutants of caveolin-3, we next treated transiently transfected NIH 3T3 cells for 16 h with several different proteasome inhibitors as follows: MG-132 (5 μm), MG-115 (5 μm), lactacystin (20 μm), or proteasome inhibitor I (20 μm). Fig. 3 A shows that the expression of the LGMD-1C mutants of caveolin-3 is significantly increased by all of the proteasomal inhibitors that we tested. Proteins that are degraded by proteasome system are often first conjugated to multiple copies of the small protein ubiquitin through isopeptide linkages (44Treier M. Staszewski L.M. Bohmann D. Cell. 1994; 78: 787-798Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (845) Google Scholar, 45Bregman D.B. Halaban R. van Gool A.J. Henning K.A. Friedberg E.C. Warren S.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Thus, inhibition of the proteasome system results in the accumulation of ubiquitinated forms of proteins normally degraded by the proteasome. To evaluate whether LGMD-1C caveolin-3 mutants are ubiquitinated prior to proteasomal degradation, we co-transfected these caveolin-3 mutants (Pro → Leu or ΔTFT) with an HA-tagged form of ubiquitin. Cells were then treated for 16 h with either vehicle alone (Me2SO) or MG-132 (5 μm) and subjected to immunoprecipitation with a caveolin-3-specific mouse mAb (clone 26). These immunoprecipitates were then analyzed by Western blotting using a rabbit pAb directed against the HA tag. Fig. 3 B shows that inhibition of the proteasomal machinery by treatment with MG-132 results in the accumulation of multiple ubiquitinated forms of LGMD-1C caveolin-3 mutants. However, in the absence of MG-132, no ubiquitinated forms of caveolin-3 were detected. Interestingly, the human caveolin-3 protein contains 9 lysine r"
https://openalex.org/W2061089834,"Cell cycle checkpoints are essential for the maintenance of genomic stability in response to DNA damage. We demonstrated recently that GADD45, a DNA damage-inducible protein, activates a G2/M checkpoint induced by either UV radiation or alkylating agents. GADD45 can interact in vivowith the G2 cell cycle-specific kinase, Cdc2, proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), and the cell cycle kinase inhibitor p21 waf1 . The ability of GADD45 to induce a G2/M arrest may be caused in part by the inhibition of Cdc2 kinase activity. Here, we report the identification of a region of GADD45 that is involved in this G2/M checkpoint. Mutants of GADD45 that lacked either the first 35 or the last 80 residues still retained an ability to induce G2/M arrest. A mutant with a deletion of the central region (residues 50–76), which is conserved in the family members GADD45β and GADD45γ, lacked such activity. This mutant also lacked an ability to bind to Cdc2, PCNA, and p21 waf1 in vivo. Consistently, either GADD45β or GADD45γ bind to Cdc2 in vivo. However, unlike GADD45, neither GADD45β nor GADD45γ inhibited the Cdc2 kinase or induced G2/M arrest. The unique effect of GADD45 may be caused by the presence of a region containing DEDDDR residues. Alanine substitutions in the region abolished GADD45 induction of a G2/M arrest and its inactivation of the Cdc2 kinase but not its binding to Cdc2, PCNA, or p21 waf1 . Therefore, the binding of GADD45 to Cdc2 was insufficient to induce a G2/M arrest, and additional activity contributed by the DEDDDR residues may be necessary to regulate the G2/M checkpoint."

We constructed several mutants of the potential phosphorylation sites (Ser/Thr) at the carboxyl tail of the receptor in order to delineate the receptor phosphorylation sites and the agonist-induced desensitization and internalization. The Ser and Thr were substituted to alanine, and the corresponding mutants were transiently and stably expressed in HEK293 cells. We found that only two residues, i.e.Thr358 and Ser363, were phosphorylated, with Ser363 being critical for the DPDPE-induced phosphorylation of the receptor. Furthermore, using alanine and aspartic acid substitutions, we found that the phosphorylation of the receptor is hierarchical, with Ser363 as the primary phosphorylation site. Here, we demonstrated that DPDPE-induced rapid receptor desensitization, as measured by adenylyl cyclase activity, and receptor internalization are intimately related to phosphorylation of Thr358 and Ser363, with Thr358being involved in the receptor internalization.

Opioid receptors belong to the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR)1 superfamily (1Evans C.J. Keith D.E. Morrison H. Magendzo K. Edwards R.H.

Therefore, one component of opioid tolerance is likely to be mediated by a phosphorylation-dependent desensitization of the receptor. Phosphorylation of the prototypic β2-adrenergic receptor by protein kinases, including the G protein-coupled receptor kinases (GRKs), promotes the association with the receptor of inhibitory proteins called arrestins (3Lefkowitz R.J.

This association uncouples the receptor from the G proteins and promotes targeting of activated receptors to clathrin-coated pits for subsequent internalization, thus blunting receptor signaling.

Although the sites of agonist-dependent phosphorylation have not yet been identified, truncation of the carboxyl tail (C-tail) of DOR showed that major phosphorylation sites are localized within this domain (11Zhao J.

However, truncation of the COOH-terminal 31 amino acids of DOR did not affect the agonist-induced desensitization of the receptor in CHO cells (15Wang C. Zhou D. Cheng Z. Wei Q. Chen J. Li G. Pei G.

A truncated mutant δ-opioid receptor undergoes rapid agonist-induced internalization in HEK293 cells, but is not phosphorylated in the presence of agonist, whereas the same mutant remained predominantly in the plasma membrane of CHO cells, suggesting that cell type-specific differences may exist in the biochemical requirements for the agonist-induced endocytosis (12Murray S.R. Evans C.J. von Zastrow M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24987-24991Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). In light of these discrepancies, it is imperative to identify the agonist-induced phosphorylation sites and to investigate the role of the phosphorylation of these sites in the regulation of the δ-opioid receptor. We used series of receptor mutants to identify the phosphorylation sites at the C-tail of DOR. In this study, we reported that two sites (Thr358 and Ser363) are phosphorylated in the presence of DPDPE and, furthermore, that the phosphorylation of the receptor is hierarchical. Additionally, we investigated the role played by these two phosphorylation sites in internalization of the receptor. Here, we also demonstrated that internalization of the activated receptor plays a role in the loss of δ-opioid receptor-mediated inhibition of adenylyl cyclase activity.

Ser and/or Thr present at the C-tail of the receptor (from Thr335 to Ser363) were point-mutated to Ala or Asp by oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis using a QuickChange site-directed mutagenesis kit from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA) according to the manufacturer's directions, except for the following mutants. The T358A, S363A, and S363D mutants were constructed using the Altered SitesTM in vitro mutagenesis system provided by Promega Corp. (Madison, WI), using DOR-1 cDNA subcloned into the phagmid pAlter-1 as template. The nucleotide sequences of all mutants were confirmed by dideoxynucleotide sequencing using Sequenase II. TheEco47III-XbaI fragments of the different plasmids were excised and ligated to the Dortag in pCDNA3 with the same fragment removed. Human embryonic kidney HEK293 cells were cultured in minimal essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 100 IU/ml penicillin under humidified atmosphere at 5% CO2. Cells were transiently transfected by the calcium phosphate precipitation method, and the assays were performed 48 h after transfection. Pool of stably transfected cells expressing the wild-type or mutant receptors were isolated in the presence of 1 mg/ml G418, without selection of individual clones, to avoid any position effect due to the random integration of each cDNA into the chromosomes. Receptor expressions were determined by whole cell binding using [3H]diprenorphine in 25 mm HEPES buffer, pH 7.6. Specific binding is defined as the difference between the radioactivity bound to the cells in the absence and presence of 100 μm naloxone. HEK293 cells stably expressing the ecdysone receptor in the pVgRxR vector (EcR-293 cells) were purchased from Invitrogen and clones stably co-expressing the wild-type or S363A mutant receptors were described in Ref. 21Law P.Y.

HEK293 cells seeded in 100-mm dishes were transiently transfected with 10 μg of wild-type or mutant receptor cDNAs, as indicated. The next day, cells were washed, detached, and plated in 24-well plates. Assays were performed the following day. The cells were pretreated with 1 μm DPDPE for various time intervals (15 min to 6 h), and were challenged with the same concentration of DPDPE.

Briefly, DOR and mutant receptors were immunoprecipitated using the rat monoclonal antibody 3F10 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and a 60-μl slurry (50%) of prewashed immunopure protein G-agarose beads (Pierce) overnight at 4 °C. Receptor proteins were dissociated from the beads by adding 60 μl of SDS-PAGE sample buffer (62.5 mm Tris buffer, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 3 m urea, 10% glycerol, 5% 2-mercaptoethanol, and 0.001% bromphenol blue). The samples were heated at 42 °C for 1 h and then separated on a 10% SDS-PAGE. Phosphorylated proteins were visualized and quantified by using the PhosphorImager Storm 840 system (Molecular Dynamics), and immunodetections were performed with the peroxidase-conjugated monoclonal antibodies (12CA5) to the HA epitope tag (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Detection was performed using the ECL Plus Western blotting detection system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Immunoblots were quantitated by densitometric scanning of film exposed in the linear range (Molecular Analysis Software, Bio-Rad). Stably transfected HEK293 cells expressing wild-type or mutant HA epitope-tagged receptors were treated with 1 μm DPDPE for the indicated times. Cells were chilled on ice to stop membrane trafficking, and receptors were visualized by using a 1:400 dilution of the high affinity mouse monoclonal anti-HA antibody (HA.11 clone 16B12; Babco, Richmond, CA) and a 1:500 dilution of the secondary antibodies goat anti-mouse IgG conjugated with Alexa488 (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). Incubations were performed at 4 °C. Surface receptor staining intensity of antibody-labeled cells was analyzed using fluorescence flow cytometry (FACScan, Becton Dickenson, Palo Alto, CA). Data were analyzed using the GraphPad program. Mean values from individual treatment groups were statistically analyzed by a one-way analysis of variance with subsequent comparisons among treatment groups from their control by Student's t test. To investigate the in vivo phosphorylation properties of DOR, HEK293 cells expressing the wild-type receptor were radiolabeled with [32P]orthophosphate (32Pi), then treated with a saturating concentration (1 μm) of DPDPE, and finally receptors were immunopurified and analyzed by SDS-PAGE autoradiography (Fig.1 a). Nonspecific signal in these experiments was negligible (lane 1). In presence of DPDPE, phosphorylation of the receptor was strongly stimulated (lane 3) when compared with the basal phosphorylation in absence of agonist (lane 2) and revealed a diffuse phosphoprotein band migrating at approximately 50–60 kDa, corresponding to that of the HA epitope-tagged DOR (Fig.1 b). Phosphorylation of this protein band was time- and concentration-dependent (data not shown), and the phosphorylation patterns were similar in HEK293 cells either transiently or stably expressing the receptor (Figs. 1, 3, and 4). Additional immunoreactive species were observed in some experiments with an apparent molecular mass corresponding to the receptor dimers, consistently with previously described oligomers of DOR (19Ko J.L.

Chem. 1998; 273: 24987-24991Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The intracellular C-tail of the mouse DOR contains seven Ser and Thr putative phosphorylation sites (Fig. 2). To identify which Ser and/or Thr are phosphorylated in response to DPDPE, individual or multiple Ser/Thr were substituted into Ala. All these mutant receptors were stably expressed in HEK293 cells, and no significant differences were detected in their ability to bind the antagonist diprenorphine or the agonist DPDPE, when compared with that of the wild-type receptor (Table I). Ala substitution of all Ser and Thr at the C-tail of the receptor (mutant DTS) completely blocked the DPDPE-induced phosphorylation (Fig.3), indicating that the phosphorylation site(s) are likely located within the COOH terminus of the receptor. We systematically substituted all these carboxyl terminus Ser/Thr to Ala. When compared with the wild-type receptor, the T335A, S344A, T352A, or T353A mutants did not display any significant differences in agonist-induced receptor phosphorylation, indicating that none of these four residues are involved in the DPDPE-induced phosphorylation of the receptor (Fig. 3, lanes 3–6). In contrast, mutation of Thr358, Thr361, or Ser363 to Ala dramatically reduced the phosphorylation level to about 47.7%, 66.3%, or 91.8%, respectively, as compared with the wild-type receptor, indicating that these residues are involved in the agonist-induced phosphorylation of the receptor (Fig.3). Interestingly, little or no agonist-induced phosphorylation could be detected with the S363A mutant, indicating that Ser363is critical for the overall phosphorylation of DOR. The complete blockade of the DPDPE-induced phosphorylation of the receptor by the S363A mutation (Figs. 3 and 4), suggested that this residue is either a phosphorylation site or is a kinase recognition site. The actual phosphorylation of this site was demonstrated by the mutant receptor in which all the Ser/Thr residues at the C-tail, except Ser363, were substituted to Ala (mutant CT/363S, Fig. 4). This mutant showed a significant agonist-induced phosphorylation and reached 36.6 ± 3.2% (n = 9) of that of the wild-type receptor. This result showed clearly that Ser363 is the primary phosphorylation site, and that phosphorylation of DOR could be hierarchical with Ser363 being the first residue to be phosphorylated.Table ICharacterization of the δ-opioid receptor and mutant receptors lacking putative phosphorylation sitesK ddiprenorphineK DDPDPER HK HK Lnmnm%DOR0.9 ± 0.12.3 ± 0.9298.6 ± 3765.2 ± 7.0T335A0.9 ± 0.14.9 ± 1.3278.7 ± 104.857.9 ± 2.8S344A1.0 ± 0.12.2 ± 1.2166.8 ± 76.955.3 ± 8.7T352A1.35 ± 0.12.4 ± 1.6287.7 ± 116.355.4 ± 5.4T353A1.1 ± 0.14.2 ± 1.5303.3 ± 40.465.2 ± 0.7T358A0.9 ± 0.11.5 ± 0.5189.0 ± 49.457.3 ± 3.9T361A0.8 ± 0.11.4 ± 0.1137.1 ± 54.057.3 ± 7.6S363A0.8 ± 0.22.5 ± 1.5282.7 ± 60.160.1 ± 8.4T361A/S363A1.1 ± 0.12.7 ± 0.1205.3 ± 52.157.5 ± 7.8DTS0.9 ± 0.13.4 ± 0.9319.2 ± 77.862.7 ± 7.9T361D1.3 ± 0.23.5 ± 1.5485.3 ± 100.369.2 ± 1.5T361D/S363A1.2 ± 0.23.5 ± 1.5192.9 ± 114.363.2 ± 8.6CT/A363S0.8 ± 0.22.1 ± 0.897.6 ± 31.353.7 ± 5.0S363D2.4 ± 0.13.5 ± 0.9185.0 ± 13.165.0 ± 3.3CT/361T/S363D1.0 ± 0.13.2 ± 0.9260 ± 54.169.1 ± 0.03Radioligand binding studies were performed on membrane preparation as described in Ref. 35Burd A.L.

Wild type and mutant receptors have comparable affinities for [3H]diprenorphine and DPDPE, and mutation of the Ser/Thr at the C-tail did not affect the proportion of receptors in the agonist-detected high affinity states. In order to identify the other phosphorylation sites, Ser363 was mutated to aspartic acid (Fig. 4), which mimics a phosphorylated form of this residue, and which should induce a recovery of the receptor phosphorylation, if the mechanism is hierarchical. As shown in Fig. 4, the S363D mutant restores the DPDPE-induced phosphorylation (compared with the S363A mutant) to about 27.5% of that of the wild-type receptor. This result confirmed, therefore, that Ser363 has to be phosphorylated before another site, and that Thr358 and/or Thr361 is (are) the other phosphorylation site(s). No phosphorylation, however, could be detected with a mutant leaving only Thr361 as a potential phosphorylation site along with the Asp-substituted Ser363 (mutant CT/361T/S363D), suggesting, therefore, that Thr361 is not phosphorylated right after Ser363, but rather Thr358 is. Indeed, the extent of phosphorylation in the T358A mutant is not significantly different (p > 0.1) from the extent of phosphorylation in the mutant leaving Ser363 as the only potential phosphorylation site (mutant CT/363S). Consistently, the lower level of phosphorylation in the S363D mutant (reaching only about 27.5% of that of the wild-type receptor) confirms that only one site is phosphorylated along with Ser363 and that this other residue is Thr358. Nevertheless, the T361A mutation affected the agonist-induced phosphorylation of the receptor. Thr361 could participate in the phosphorylation of the receptor as a kinase recognition/binding site but not as a phosphorylation site. The T361D mutant, which was originally constructed to define the phosphorylation mechanism of DOR, exhibiting almost but not complete recovery of the phosphorylation level as compared with that of the wild-type receptor, might affect to a lesser extent the kinase's recognition/binding to the receptor. This observed recovery was, however, blocked when Ser363 was mutated into Ala along with the T361D substitution (mutant T361D/S363A, Fig. 3), consistently with the critical role of Ser363 in the phosphorylation of the receptor. Next, we examined the role of phosphorylation in the agonist-induced desensitization of DOR in HEK293 cells. The kinetics of the loss of DPDPE inhibition of the adenylyl cyclase activity were monophasic, and the apparent rate of desensitization was relatively slow, with at 12 of about 1.3 ± 0.25 h (n = 6, data not shown), consistently with previous study (10El Kouhen R. Maestri-El Kouhen O. Law P.-Y. Loh H.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9207-9215Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). In contrast, DPDPE-induced phosphorylation of the receptor followed much faster kinetics, showing a maximum within 10 min of DPDPE exposure (data not shown). The difference in these two rates suggests that receptor phosphorylation does not directly lead to DOR desensitization. The failure to correlate phosphorylation to desensitization of DOR could be due to the relatively high level of receptor expression (2.2 ± 0.8 pmol/mg of protein) in HEK293 cells. In an earlier study, by controlling the expression level of the receptor in HEK293 cells with an ecdysone-inducible expression system (21Law P.Y. Maestri-El Kouhen O. Solberg J. Wang W. Erickson L.J. Loh H.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32057-32065Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), we were able to demonstrate that the rate of DOR desensitization is dependent on the receptor level expressed at the cell surface. Using the same inducible-expression system to control the expression of the wild type and S363A mutant receptors, in HEK293 cells (see “Experimental Procedures”), we could demonstrate that receptor desensitization kinetics in the presence of DPDPE were receptor concentration-dependent (Fig.5). At high levels of receptor expression (>1 pmol/mg of protein), the desensitization kinetics of both receptors were relatively slow and indistinguishable, suggesting that the absence of receptor phosphorylation did not affected the observed rate of desensitization. Similar results were obtained when the wild-type receptor and a mutant receptor incapable of being phosphorylated (mutant T361A/S363A) were transiently expressed in HEK293 cells (data not shown). At low levels of expression of the wild type receptor (<300 fmol/mg of protein), when receptor concentration was limited, the DPDPE-induced loss of response was significantly faster, and the receptor desensitized completely 40 min following DPDPE treatment. The elimination of receptor phosphorylation (S363A mutant) reduced dramatically the extent of desensitization, when expressed at similar levels as the wild-type receptor. At 40 min following agonist treatment, 50% of the response remained. Thus, the hierarchical phosphorylation of DOR at Ser363 is an important but not obligatory event in the DPDPE-induced desensitization. Since internalization is involved in the desensitization of several GPCRs (4Krupnick J.G. Benovic J.L. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. To"

While both dCtBP and Groucho are required for proper Hairy function, their properties are very different. As would be expected for a co-repressor, reduced Groucho activity enhances the hairymutant phenotype. In contrast, reduced dCtBP activity suppresses it. We show here that dCtBP can function as either a co-activator or co-repressor of transcription in a context-dependent manner. The regions of dCtBP required for activation and repression are separable. We find that mSin3A-histone deacetylase complexes are altered in the presence of dCtBP and that dCtBP interferes with both Groucho and Mad transcriptional repression. Similar to CtBP's role in attenuating E1A's oncogenicity, we propose that dCtBP can interfere with corepressor-histone deacetylase complexes, thereby attenuating transcriptional repression. Hairy defines a new class of proteins that requires both CtBP and Groucho co-factors for proper function.

A rapidly growing subset of repressors appears to act indirectly by recruiting accessory proteins, referred to as co-repressors, that themselves bring about repression (cf. Refs. 5Goodman R.H.

Examples of such pairs of proteins are the interaction of the Sin3 co-repressor with the Mad basic helix-loop-helix zipper protein and the interaction of the Tup1/Ssn6 co-repressors with several types of DNA-binding proteins (7Ayer D.E.

One emerging theme is the recruitment of histone deacetylases (HDACs)1 to alter local chromatin structure at promoters; hyperacetylated chromatin is usually associated with active transcriptional states, whereas hypoacetylated chromatin is usually associated with repressed transcriptional states (9Braunstein M.

A number of different transcriptional repressors present in the earlyDrosophila embryo have been shown to encode sequence-specific DNA binding transcription factors that function by recruiting co-repressor proteins. Two putative co-repressors acting during embryogenesis have been identified: Groucho (Gro) andDrosophila C-terminal binding protein (dCtBP) (12Nibu Y. Zhang H. Levine M.

Both of these factors do not bind DNA themselves but are brought to the DNA through their interaction with sequence-specific DNA binding repressors.Gro was first demonstrated to function as a co-repressor through its interactions with the hairy pair-rule segmentation gene (Ref. 13Paroush Z.

Hairy's conserved C-terminal WRPW tetrapeptide motif was shown to be necessary and sufficient for interaction with Gro protein using biochemical, two-hybrid, and genetic approaches (13Paroush Z.

However, the relatively mild phenotypic defects associated with the Rpd3 mutation have led to the suggestion that Gro does not function solely through recruitment of the Rpd3 histone deacetylase (20Mannervik M. Levine M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 6797-6801Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). In addition to its interaction with Hairy, Gro mediates repression through other classes of DNA-binding transcriptional regulators including Engrailed, Dorsal, Tcf, and Runt (21Aronson B.D.

Svensson C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 2578-2584Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). CtBP homologs have also been reported in mouse (mCtBP1 and mCtBP2), Xenopus (XCtBP), and C. elegans(CeCtBP), where they have been shown to interact physically with a diverse set of factors (cf.

Human CtBP was identified on the basis of its ability to bind the C terminus of E1A using the consensus motif PXDLSX(K/R). While most the of the CtBP-interacting proteins identified to date contain this consensus motif, a different motif, PLSLV, has been shown to be required for Hairy and XTcf-3 interaction (14Poortinga G. Watanabe M. Parkhurst S.M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2067-2078Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar, 28Brannon M. Brown J.D. Bates R. Kimelman D. Moon R.T. Development. 1999; 126: 3159-3170Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).CtBP proteins have been shown to function as co-repressors in vitro. When mCtBP1 or mCtBP2 proteins were fused to heterologous DNA binding domains and examined in transcriptional tethering assays, these proteins were efficient repressors of transcription (29Criqui-Filipe P. Ducret C. Maira S.M. Wasylyk B. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3392-3403Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 32Turner J. Crossley M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5129-5140Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). In the case of mCtBP1, the repression was shown to be TSA-sensitive, suggesting a role for histone deacetylases (29Criqui-Filipe P. Ducret C. Maira S.M. Wasylyk B. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3392-3403Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Together these observations suggest that CtBP, like Gro, functions utilizing a repression mechanism involving alteration of local chromatin structure.The different transcriptional repressors shown to function during earlyDrosophila development have been placed in two classes on the basis of their effective range of action. Short range repressors have been proposed to inhibit the core transcription complex or upstream activators and function over relatively short distances (∼100 base pairs), while long range repressors have been proposed to silence gene expression over long distances (>1 kilobase pair; Refs.23Dubnicoff T. Valentine S.A. Chen G. Shi T. Lengyel J.A. Paroush Z. Courey A.J. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2952-2957Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar and 33Cai H.N. Arnosti D.N. Levine M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 9309-9314Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). While the mechanism underlying short range and long range repression is not known, Levine and colleagues (12Nibu Y. Zhang H. Levine M. Science. 1998; 280: 101-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar, 34Nibu Y. Zhang H. Bajor E. Barolo S. Small S. Levine M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 7009-7020Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar) have noted that the Hairy and Dorsal long range repressors bind Gro, while many of the short range repressors (Knirps, Krüppel, Snail) bind dCtBP. This observation has led to their proposal that Gro and dCtBP mediate these separate pathways of transcriptional repression (35Zhang H. Levine M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 535-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). However, one enigmatic observation is that Hairy, defined as a long range repressor, binds both Gro and dCtBP (14Poortinga G. Watanabe M. Parkhurst S.M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2067-2078Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar, 35Zhang H. Levine M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 535-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). While both Gro and dCtBP are required for proper Hairy function, their properties are very different. As would be expected for a co-repressor, reduced maternal Gro activity has been shown to enhance the Hairy mutant phenotype (13Paroush Z. Finley R.L. Kidd T. Wainwright S.M. Ingham P.W. Brent R. Ish-Horowicz D. Cell. 1994; 79: 805-815Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar). In contrast, reduced doses of maternal dCtBP suppress the Hairy mutant phenotype, suggesting that dCtBP acts in a different manner (14Poortinga G. Watanabe M. Parkhurst S.M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2067-2078Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). These differences in Gro and dCtBP properties led us to investigate further the transcriptional properties of dCtBP.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCell CultureAll cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone). 293, NIH 3T3, and CV-1 cells were obtained from the Eisenman laboratory. B78 cells were obtained from the Groudine/Weintraub laboratories.Plasmid ConstructionReportersThe 4×GAL14DLUC reporter system was described previously (36Laherty C.D. Yang W.M. Sun J.M. Davie J.R. Seto E. Eisenman R.N. Cell. 1997; 89: 349-356Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (837) Google Scholar). The pG5LxLuc reporter (Fig. 5 A) was constructed by cutting the 4×GAL14DLUC reporter with BglII, blunting this site with Klenow, followed by an EcoRI partial digestion to retrieve a fragment containing the luciferase gene and SV40 poly(A) site. This fragment was then subcloned into the SmaI–EcoRI sites of pG5E4, a plasmid containing five Gal4 binding sites upstream of the E4 TATA box (37Lin Y.S. Carey M.F. Ptashne M. Green M.R. Cell. 1988; 54: 659-664Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). A pair of oligonucleotides coding for two tandem LexA binding sites was subcloned into the BamHI site located between the Gal4 binding sites and E4 minimal promoter. Construct accuracy was checked by sequencing (top oligo, 5′-GATCGATGTACTGTATGTACATACAGTACGTCGACTCGAG-3′; bottom oligo, 5′-GATCCTCGAGTCGACGTACTGTATGTACATACAGTACATC-3′).Figure 5dCtBP interferes with Mad transcriptional repression. A, schematic diagram of the reporter and expression plasmids used in the following experiments. B, 293 or NIH 3T3 cells were transfected with the pG5LxLuc reporter, Lex-VP16 activator plasmid, and Gal4 or the GAL4DBD-Mad (SID) fusion protein diagrammed in A. The amount of MT-dCtBP transfected compared with Mad was also reduced by 10-fold (dCtBP↓).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Gal4-DBD FusionsThe Gal4-DBD (aa 1–145) and Gal4-Mad (SID) fusions were described previously (38Ayer D.E. Laherty C.D. Lawrence Q.A. Armstrong A.P. Eisenman R.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5581-5772Crossref Scopus (149) Google Scholar). To generate the Gal4-Gro fusion, full-length gro cDNA was excised from pCite4b+ using BamHI–BglII and then subcloned in the BamHI site of the pSPGal plasmid described previously (38Ayer D.E. Laherty C.D. Lawrence Q.A. Armstrong A.P. Eisenman R.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5581-5772Crossref Scopus (149) Google Scholar). To generate the Gal4-dCtBP full-length (aa 1–387) and N-T partial protein fusions, each protein fragment was generated by standard PCR using primers containing BamHI sites, cut withBamHI, and subcloned into the BamHI site of pSPGal plasmid described previously (38Ayer D.E. Laherty C.D. Lawrence Q.A. Armstrong A.P. Eisenman R.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5581-5772Crossref Scopus (149) Google Scholar). The dCtBP pieces (N-T) used are as follows: N, amino acids 1–95; P, aa 1–210; Q, aa 149–387; R, aa 149–210; S, aa 255–387; and T, aa 255–325. The Gal4-dCtBP(H→Q) mutant was generated by PCR site-directed mutagenesis from full-length dCtBP using primers containing the altered nucleotide sequence. Orientation was determined by restriction mapping and sequencing.Other Transcription ConstructsThe E1A clones used in these studies, E1A-12Swt, E1A-Δ2–36 (E1AΔp300), and E1A-YN49/598 (E1AΔRb), were described previously (39Wang H.G. Rikitake Y. Carter M.C. Yaciuk P. Abraham S.E. Zerler B. Moran E. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 476-488Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The LexDBD-VP16 fusion construct was described previously (40Krumm A.

Shiio (Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center).GST FusionsThe wild-type GST-dCtBP fusion was described previously (14Poortinga G. Watanabe M. Parkhurst S.M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2067-2078Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). The GST-dCtBP deletion constructs contain deletions of five amino acids (Δ613, deleting aa 205–209; Δ688, deleting aa 230–234; Δ805, deleting aa 269–273; and Δ865, deleting aa 289–293). These deletions were made within the full-length dCtBP cDNA using primers that delete 15 nucleotides corresponding to the deleted five amino acids. The final PCR products were cut withBamHI–SmaI and then subcloned into theBamHI–SmaI sites of pGex3X.In Vitro Translation ConstructsAll constructs were generated by subcloning cDNA fragments generated by PCR with primers containing restriction enzyme recognition sequences into the pCite 4a+ vector (Novagen). The full-length Hairy cDNA (aa 1–343), Hairy C terminus (aa 95–343), and full-length Knirps cDNA were subcloned into pCite usingEcoRI–BglII sites. AnEcoRI–BamHI fragment containing the C terminus 100 amino acids of E1A was subcloned into pCite usingEcoRI–BglII sites. Full-length Groucho was subcloned into pCite using BamHI–SalI sites.Repression AssaysTransfections and luciferase assays were performed by standard procedures (42). In all assays, 1.5 μg of reporter and 3.5 μg of Gal4 plasmids were used per 6-cm dish. Transfections were performed three times in duplicate, and transfection efficiencies were normalized using a co-transfected β-galactosidase plasmid (36Laherty C.D. Yang W.M. Sun J.M. Davie J.R.

Due to lower transfection efficiencies with calcium phosphate, lipofection was used in NIH 3T3 cells in these experiments using SuperFect (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Low stringency immunoprecipitations were performed as described (36Laherty C.D. Yang W.M. Sun J.M. Davie J.R. Seto E. Eisenman R.N.

For histone deacetylase assays, low stringency immunoprecipitations were performed, and the precipitates were resuspended in HD buffer (20 mmTris (pH 8.0), 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol). For radio-immunoprecipitation experiments, low stringency immunoprecipitations were performed after cells were metabolically labeled for 3 h with [35S]methionine (PerkinElmer Life Sciences).Immunoprecipitated proteins were resolved on SDS-polyacrylamide gels and examined by autoradiography or immunoblot analysis. Western blots were performed by electrophoretic transfer of polyacrylamide-resolved polypeptides to nitrocellulose membranes (Schleicher and Schuell). Membranes were blocked in PBST (1× phosphate-buffered saline, 0.1% Tween) containing 2% nonfat dry milk. Membranes were probed in PBT (1× phosphate-buffered saline, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, 0.1% Tween), washed four times in PBT, and incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse or anti-rabbit secondary antibodies (Jackson ImmunoResearch). Membranes were then washed four times in PBT and analyzed by ECL (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech).Antisera used were as follows: anti-HDAC1,2 from E. Seto (University of South Florida), anti-mSin3A from R. Eisenman (Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center), anti-FLAG from Y. Shiio, and anti-9e10 (anti-Myc epitope tag) from J.

EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5646-5659Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar) except that all fusion proteins were expressed at 30 °C to improve protein solubility. Allin vitro translated proteins were precleared by incubation for 1 h at 4 °C with equal amounts of GST alone on glutathione-Sepharose beads in L-buffer (phosphate-buffered saline, 1% bovine serum albumin, 0.5% Nonidet P-40 and protease inhibitors).Embryo AnalysisFlies were cultured and crossed on yeast-cornmeal-molasses-malt extract medium at 25 °C. The alleles used in this study are as described previously (14Poortinga G. Watanabe M. Parkhurst S.M.

The h 7H P1590(dCtBP) gro E47 triple mutant chromosome was generated by standard recombination techniques starting from theh 7H P1590 chromosome described previously (14Poortinga G. Watanabe M.

Larval cuticle preparations were prepared and analyzed as described by Wieschaus and Nüsslein-Volhard (45Wieschaus E. Nüsslein-Volhard C. Roberts D.B. Drosophila: A Practical Approach. IRL Press, Oxford1986: 199-226Google Scholar). Embryos were prepared, and immunohistochemical detection of proteins was performed as described previously (46Parkhurst S.M. Bopp D. Ish-Horowicz D. Cell. 1990; 63: 1179-1191Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) using anti-ftzantisera (from H. Krause) and alkaline phosphatase-coupled secondary antibodies (Jackson Laboratories) visualized with Substrate Kit II reagents (Vector Laboratories, Inc.). Transcriptional repression is an important feature of developmental processes, where it is necessary for establishing complex patterns of gene expression (1Gray S. Levine M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 358-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 2Hanna-Rose W. Hansen U. Trends Genet. 1996; 12: 229-234Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar, 3Herschbach B.M. Johnson A.D. Annu. Rev.

A rapidly growing subset of repressors appears to act indirectly by recruiting accessory proteins, referred to as co-repressors, that themselves bring about repression (cf. Refs. 5Goodman R.H. Mandel G. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1998; 8: 413-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar and 6Torchia J. Glass C. Rosenfeld M.G. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 373-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (509) Google Scholar). Examples of such pairs of proteins are the interaction of the Sin3 co-repressor with the Mad basic helix-loop-helix zipper protein and the interaction of the Tup1/Ssn6 co-repressors with several types of DNA-binding proteins (7Ayer D.E. Lawrence Q.A. Eisenman R.E. Cell. 1995; 80: 767-776Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (522) Google Scholar, 8Roth S.Y. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1995; 5: 168-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The mechanisms whereby these repressor-co-repressor complexes mediate repression are the subject of many ongoing studies. One emerging theme is the recruitment of histone deacetylases (HDACs)1 to alter local chromatin structure at promoters; hyperacetylated chromatin is usually associated with active transcriptional states, whereas hypoacetylated chromatin is usually associated with repressed transcriptional states (9Braunstein M. Rose A.B. Holmes S.G. Allis C.D. Broach J.R. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 592-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (709) Google Scholar, 10Hebbes T.R. Thorne A.W. Crane-Robinson C. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 1395-1402Crossref PubMed Scopus (701) Google Scholar). The Mad-Sin3 repressor complex has been shown to recruit HDAC through specific interaction of Sin3 and HDAC (see Ref. 11Knoepfler P.S. Eisenman R.N. Cell. 1999; 99: 447-450Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar and references therein). Transcriptional repression plays a major role in segmentation gene expression that leads to proper body patterning during earlyDrosophila development (cf. Refs. 1Gray S. Levine M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 358-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar and 4Mannervik M. Nibu Y. Zhang H. Levine M. Science. 1999; 284: 606-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). A number of different transcriptional repressors present in the earlyDrosophila embryo have been shown to encode sequence-specific DNA binding transcription factors that function by recruiting co-repressor proteins. Two putative co-repressors acting during embryogenesis have been identified: Groucho (Gro) andDrosophila C-terminal binding protein (dCtBP) (12Nibu Y. Zhang H. Levine M. Science. 1998; 280: 101-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar, 13Paroush Z. Finley R.L. Kidd T. Wainwright S.M. Ingham P.W. Brent R. Ish-Horowicz D.

Both of these factors do not bind DNA themselves but are brought to the DNA through their interaction with sequence-specific DNA binding repressors. Gro was first demonstrated to function as a co-repressor through its interactions w"

A Leu paired with a second Leu, Ile, or Met, while itself lacking the ability to mediate transport, is the key structural feature in these motifs. Here we have studied the structural differences between the leucine-based motifs contained in the COOH tails of LIMPII and GLUT4, two membrane proteins that are transported through the secretory pathway and are targeted to lysosomes (1Verhey K.J.

Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 1705-1715Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), respectively. LIMPII and GLUT4 display negatively (Asp470/Glu471) and positively (Arg484/Arg485) charged residues, respectively, at positions −4 and −5 upstream from the critical Leu residue. The change in the charge sign of residues −4 and −5 results in missorting of LIMPII and GLUT4. We note that the acidic Glu residue at position −4 is critical for efficient intracellular sorting of LIMPII to lysosomes, but is dispensable for its surface internalization by endocytosis. Efficient intracellular sorting and endocytosis of GLUT4 require an Arg pair between positions −4 and −7. These results are consistent with the existence of distinct leucine-based motifs and provide evidence of their different readings at different cellular sites. Leucine-based motifs mediate the sorting of membrane proteins at such cellular sites as the trans-Golgi network, endosomes, and plasma membrane.

The change in the charge sign of residues −4 and −5 results in missorting of LIMPII and GLUT4. We note that the acidic Glu residue at position −4 is critical for efficient intracellular sorting of LIMPII to lysosomes, but is dispensable for its surface internalization by endocytosis. Efficient intracellular sorting and endocytosis of GLUT4 require an Arg pair between positions −4 and −7. These results are consistent with the existence of distinct leucine-based motifs and provide evidence of their different readings at different cellular sites. trans-Golgi network adipocyte-like polyclonal antibody monoclonal antibody phosphate-buffered saline fluorescein isothiocyanate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis low-density microsome plasma membrane Krebs-Ringer HEPES buffer 4-4′-O-[2-[2-[2-[2-[2-(biotinylamino)ethoxy]ethoxy] ethoxy]-4-(1-azi-2,2,2-trifluoroethyl)benzoyl]amino-1,3-propanedyl]bis-d-mannose target SNAP receptor Leucine-based motifs are implicated in membrane protein sorting by clathrin devices at the TGN,1cell surface, and endosomes (Refs. 1Verhey K.J.

Their structural determinants are, however, poorly characterized: a Leu paired with a second Leu, Ile, or Met is the only constant structural feature in these motifs, but the pair by itself lacks the ability to mediate transport (2Sandoval I.V.

In addition, phosphorylation of a Ser residue at position 4 or 5 upstream is critical for the surface internalization of some membrane proteins (13Shin J. Dunbrack Jr., R.L. Lee S. Strominger J.L. J.

On the other hand, some of the Leu-based motifs lack upstream acidic residues in intracellular protein sorting and endocytosis, and this also strongly suggests the existence of a family of leucine-based motifs with distinct structural determinants and activities. The possibility of distinct specificity determinants that modulate the recognition of leucine-based motifs is also evident when the ability of specific clathrin adaptors to discriminate between leucine motifs is studied (11Dietrich J.

Here we have studied the structural determinants involved in the Leu-mediated intracellular sorting and surface internalization of LIMPII and GLUT4, two membrane proteins with distinct cellular distributions. The results of our experiments indicate the existence of different Leu-based motifs endowed with distinct structural determinants. Furthermore, they show that Leu-based motifs use different structural determinants at different transport steps. 3T3-L1 fibroblasts were cultured for 48 h on plastic dishes or glass coverslips in normal medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 4 mm glutamine, 50 mg/liter gentamycin, 100 mg/liter streptomycin, 100 IU/liter penicillin, and nonessential amino acids) in a humidified CO2 incubator at 37 °C. 3T3-L1 fibroblasts stably transfected with wild-type GLUT4 or GLUT4 mutants, when required, were converted into adipocyte-like (ADL) cells by incubation for 6–7 days in IDBX medium (normal medium supplemented with 10 μg/ml insulin, 10 μg/ml biotin, 0.25 μmdexamethasone, and 500 μm 1-isobutyl-3-methylxanthine). Clonal ADL cells displaying numerous lipid droplets of medium and large size in their cytoplasm were used before the onset of endogenous GLUT4 expression. Wild-type rat GLUT4 and LIMPII cDNAs were cloned into the M13mp19 vector. All mutants were made by site-directed mutagenesis as described (23Kunkel T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 488-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (4900) Google Scholar). For development of clonal cell lines of 3T3-L1 fibroblasts, constructs and mutants were cloned into a modified pPUR vector (CLONTECH) carrying the spleen focus-forming virus long terminal repeat promoter in theApaI/EcoRI sites. To monitor the effects of the mutations on the distribution of LIMPII and GLUT4, COS-7 cells grown to near confluency on glass coverslips for 48 h were transiently transfected using the DEAE-dextran procedure (24Lopata M.A. Cleveland D.W. Sollner-Webb B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 12: 5707-5717Crossref PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar). Transfections were performed for 18 h only to prevent overexpression of the transfected proteins and therefore saturation of the sorting mechanisms. Furthermore, transfected cells were incubated for the last 3 h with 0.1 mm cycloheximide to deplete the secretory pathway of transfected proteins. Mutants displaying abnormal patterns of distribution were then studied in stably transfected 3T3-L1 fibroblasts. For stable protein expression, 3T3-L1 fibroblasts, grown to 70% confluency on 10-cm dishes, were transfected using the calcium phosphate precipitation method (25Gorman C. Glover D.M. DNA Cloning. IRL Press Ltd., Oxford1985: 143-190Google Scholar) and were selected with 5 μg/ml puromycin 48 h post-transfection. Individual clones were isolated within 2 weeks of transfection with the help of Teflon rings and, following their expansion, were screened by immunofluorescence microscopy. Established clonal cell lines were homogeneous with regard to the expression and distribution of the transfected proteins. Clones were maintained thereafter with 5–7.5 μg/ml puromycin. The rabbit polyclonal antibodies (pAb) OSCR6 (provided by Dr. A. Zorzano, Universitat Barcelona) (26Camps M. Vilaró S. Testar X. Palacı́n M. Zorzano A. Endocrinology. 1994; 134: 924-934Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) and 828 were raised against a peptide representing the entire cytoplasmic COOH tail of GLUT4. The development and characterization of mouse mAb 29G10, raised against the luminal domain of LIMPII, has been described (27Barriocanal J. Bonifacino J.S. Yuan L. Sandoval I.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 16755-16763Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). pAb OSCR6 was able to immunoprecipitate detergent-solubilized GLUT4 and reacted with the protein blotted onto nitrocellulose and therefore was used in immunoprecipitation studies and Western blot analysis. pAb 828 reacted better with methanol-fixed cells and was used to study the cellular distribution of GLUT4 by microscopy. Lipid droplets were stained with Nile blue for 5 min on cells fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde, and the fluorescence was photographed. For protein localization studies, 3T3-L1 fibroblasts and ADL cells washed twice with PBS were fixed and permeabilized for 3 min with cold (−20 °C) methanol, washed three times, and incubated at 37 °C for 1 h with the corresponding specific antibody in PBS. After being washed for 15 min with PBS, the cells were stained at 37 °C for 1 h with FITC-conjugated goat anti-mouse or goat anti-rabbit secondary antibodies (Cappel, Durham, NC) prepared to 10 mg/ml in PBS containing 0.25 mg/ml goat preimmune serum. Stained cells were washed once more for 15 min with PBS, mounted on glass slides using Gelvatol (Monsanto Co., St. Louis, MO), and studied under an Axiovert 135M inverted microscope (Zeiss) or a confocal Radiance 2000 microscope (Bio-Rad), and the fluorescence was photographed. Stably transfected 3T3-L1 fibroblasts grown to near confluency were washed with PBS and incubated with 0.1 mNa2CO3 (pH 11.3) at 4 °C for 30 min. Cell extracts were centrifuged at 150,000 × g for 30 min using a TL-100 ultracentrifuge (Beckman Instruments), and membrane pellets were extracted by incubation at 4 °C for 1 h with 10 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, and 2 mm EDTA (extraction buffer). After removal of insoluble material by centrifugation at 150,000 × gfor 30 min and adjustment of the protein in the supernatants to 2 mg/ml with 10 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 20 μl was mixed with an equal volume of 2× Laemmli buffer containing 5% SDS, heated at 37 °C for 10 min, and resolved by 10% SDS-PAGE. Resolved proteins were blotted onto nitrocellulose, immunoprobed with either mAb 29G10 or pAb OSCR6, and studied using the ECL technique (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Aylesbury, United Kingdom). Low-density microsome (LDM)- and plasma membrane (PM)-enriched fractions were prepared from stably transfected 3T3-L1 fibroblasts by a modification of the procedure previously described (28Piper R.C. Hess L.J. James D.E. Am. J. Physiol. 1991; 247: E726-E731Google Scholar). Briefly, the cells were washed with PBS, scraped with a rubber policeman in 3 ml of cold HES buffer (20 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 1 mm EDTA, and 255 mm sucrose), and disrupted by N2 cavitation (2400 kilopascals). All manipulations were performed at 4 °C. Post-nuclear supernatants were fractionated by three consecutive centrifugations at 19,000 × g for 20 min, then at 45,000 × g for another 20 min, and finally at 180,000 × g for 90 min to yield pellets enriched in LDMs. The membranes collected at 19,000 × g were resuspended in HES buffer, layered onto a 35% sucrose cushion in 10 mm Tris (pH 7.4) and 1 mm EDTA, and recentrifuged at 108,000 × g in an SW 40 rotor for 1 h. The white fluffy band recovered at the sucrose interface was then diluted 10-fold in 20 mm Tris and 2 mmEDTA, treated with 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and centrifuged at 150,000 × g for 30 min to yield a pellet enriched in plasma membranes. LDM and PM pellets were mixed for 1 h at 4 °C with 300 μl of extraction buffer, and the insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 150,000 ×g for 30 min. The resulting supernatants were scrutinized for GLUT4 by Western blot analysis as described above. Untransfected and stably transfected 3T3-L1 fibroblasts cultured on 10-mm coverslips were quickly washed with Krebs-Ringer HEPES buffer (KRHB) and incubated at 37 °C for 5 or 10 min with 15 ml of KRHB containing 0.2% bovine serum albumin and 1 mm 2-deoxy[3H]glucose (specific activity = 6.66 Ci/mol; PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Nonspecific 2-deoxyglucose uptake was measured in cells preincubated for 5 min with 15 μl of KRHB containing 50 μmcytochalasin B and 40 mm glucose, and the uptake assay was performed in the presence of both cytochalasin B and glucose. Glucose uptake was stopped by washing the cells quickly three times with 1 ml of ice-cold PBS containing 50 mm glucose. Cells were lysed with 200 μl of 0.1 n NaOH to measure protein, and radioactivity was estimated by scintillation counting. 2-Deoxyglucose uptake was normalized to cpm/μg of protein/min. Clonal 3T3-L1 fibroblasts cultured for 48 h to 80% confluency on 10-cm dishes were washed twice with methionine/cysteine-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and metabolically labeled for 30 min with 0.25 mCi/ml [35S]methionine/cysteine (specific activity > 1000 Ci/ml; PRO-MIX, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) prepared in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and 2% dialyzed fetal calf serum. The 30-min pulse was adequate to metabolically label LIMPII and GLUT4 and also to begin to monitor their appearance at the plasma membrane since they required 45 and 20 min, respectively, to traverse the Golgi (27Barriocanal J.

Afterwards, the cells were extracted for 30 min with 1 ml of cold 0.1m Na2CO3 (pH 11.3), and membrane spins prepared by centrifugation at 150,000 × gfor 40 min were solubilized by incubation at 4 °C for 30 min with 1 ml of extraction buffer. GLUT4 and LIMPII proteins were immunoprecipitated with mAb 29G10 and pAb OSCR6 bound to 10 ml of protein G-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and the total labeled proteins were measured in one-eighth of the immunospins, whereas the rest were boiled for 5 min in 0.2 ml of 0.5% SDS and precipitated again with 10 ml of streptavidin-Sepharose to measure the labeled protein deflected to the plasma membrane. Protein quantitation was performed by scanning the autoradiograms produced by SDS-PAGE. To study the rate of LIMPII internalization, intact clonal 3T3-L1 fibroblasts grown to 80% confluency were incubated at 4 °C for 1 h with mAb 29G10 diluted 1:500 in PBS; washed four times with cold buffer; and after incubation for different time periods at 37 °C, fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde and stained with an FITC-conjugated goat anti-mouse secondary pAb as described above. Cell fluorescence was studied with a Coulter cytometer and analyzed using the Epics Flow XL program. Dead cells were excluded from analysis by forward and side scatter measurements. To study the rate of GLUT4 internalization, this protein in clonal fibroblasts was metabolically labeled as described above and then labeled for 1 min at 4 °C with 1 mm Bio-LC-ATB-BMPA prepared in 250 ml of KRHB (31Koumanov F.

Biotinylated samples were then washed and chased for different time periods at 37 °C in KRHB. Quantitation of biotin-35S-labeled GLUT4 retained on the cell surface was carried out using purified plasma membrane fractions (see “Subcellular fractionation Studies”). Cells metabolically labeled for 15 min as described above were disrupted by N2 cavitation, and the post-nuclear supernatant was mixed as described to give a final concentration of 20% Percoll (22Höning S.

The importance of the coordination of different cell functions by Cdc42 is underscored by the fact that a constitutively active Cdc42 mutant induces cellular transformation. In this study, we describe a novel function for Cdc42: its ability to stimulate pre-messenger RNA splicing. This activity is dependent on cysteine 37 in the effector loop of Cdc42 but is not dependent on cell growth. A likely candidate protein for mediating the Cdc42 effects on pre-mRNA splicing is the nuclear RNA cap-binding complex (CBC), which plays a key role in an early step of cap-dependent RNA splicing. Activation of the CBC by Cdc42 can be inhibited by rapamycin. Additionally, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and the Cdc42 effector, pp70 S6 kinase, stimulate the RNA cap-binding activity of the CBC. S6 kinase may directly target the CBC in vivo as it can phosphorylate the 80-kDa subunit of the CBC, CBP80, at residues that are subject to a growth factor-dependent and rapamycin-sensitive phosphorylation in vivo. Together these data suggest the involvement of a Cdc42-S6 kinase pathway in the regulation of RNA splicing, mediated by an increase in capped RNA binding by the CBC, as well as raise the possibility that the effects of Cdc42 on cell growth may be due in part to its regulation of RNA processing.

Additionally, it has been shown that Cdc42 plays an important role in cell growth control, as a constitutively active form of Cdc42, Cdc42 F28L, induces malignant transformation (9Lin R. Bagrodia S. Cerione R. Manor D. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 794-797Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). We have recently shown that an interaction between Cdc42 and the coatomer subunits of COP-coated vesicles is somehow involved in the transformation signal (6Wu W.J. Erickson J.W. Lin R. Cerione R.A. Nature. 2000; 405: 800-803Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). However, there appears to be a requirement for other Cdc42 targets as well, as deletion of the insert region of Cdc42 blocks transformation (10Wu W.J. Lin R. Cerione R.A. Manor D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16655-16658Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) independent of any interaction with the coatomer complex. What this suggests is that Cdc42 may be orchestrating distinct cellular functions in order to coordinate regulated cell growth.In a previous study, we observed that activated forms of Cdc42 were capable of stimulating the nuclear cap-binding complex (CBC)1 to bind capped RNAs (11Wilson K.F. Fortes P. Singh U.S. Ohno M. Mattaj I.W. Cerione R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4166-4173Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). In binding to RNAs containing a m7G cap structure, the CBC has been implicated in a number of fundamental aspects of RNA processing including pre-mRNA splicing (12Izaurralde E. Lewis J. McGuigan C.

Sci. 1997; 94: 11893-11898Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Importantly, the CBC has also been shown to be a nuclear end point for extracellular stimuli such as growth factors and cell stress stimulants (11Wilson K.F. Fortes P. Singh U.S. Ohno M. Mattaj I.W. Cerione R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4166-4173Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). In this study we have investigated the possibility that Cdc42 might be involved in the signal regulation of RNA processing via the CBC. Specifically, we find that activated alleles of Cdc42 can stimulate splicing activity in a manner that is dependent on amino acid 37 of the effector loop. As the CBC plays a pivotal role in cap-dependent pre-mRNA splicing, we have investigated the Cdc42 pathway leading to CBC activation and find that this pathway proceeds via the Cdc42 effector, pp70 S6 kinase (S6K). Rapamycin inhibits the Cdc42-induced activation of the CBC, whereas S6K, together with PI3 kinase, will induce the CBC to bind capped RNAs. Additionally, S6K can phosphorylate the CBCin vitro at a site that undergoes a rapamycin-sensitive, growth factor-dependent phosphorylation in vivo. Together, these data suggest a mechanism by which Cdc42 might influence pre-mRNA splicing, through the S6K-mediated activation of the CBC.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONPreviously, we have demonstrated that activated forms of Cdc42 can promote the nuclear CBC to bind capped RNA substrates (11Wilson K.F. Fortes P. Singh U.S. Ohno M. Mattaj I.W. Cerione R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4166-4173Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). One of the important functional outcomes of this binding event is an enhancement of capped RNA splicing (12Izaurralde E. Lewis J. McGuigan C. Jankowska M. Darzynkiewicz E. Mattaj I.W. Cell. 1994; 78: 657-668Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar). This leads to the intriguing suggestion that Cdc42-stimulated signaling pathways can promote cap-dependent RNA splicing. To test this possibility, splicing lysates were prepared from NIH 3T3 cells that were stably transfected with a constitutively active form of Cdc42, Cdc42 F28L (9Lin R. Bagrodia S. Cerione R. Manor D. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 794-797Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar), or vector alone, after a 24-h growth period in low serum. The activity of these splicing lysates was then assessed in an in vitro splicing assay using either a specific m7GpppG-capped probe or a nonspecific ApppG-capped probe. As shown in Fig. 1 A, Cdc42 F28L facilitates the generation of RNA splicing products as compared with vector alone, and this effect is greatly enhanced when the RNA probe contains a specific m7GpppG cap.We have shown that the Cdc42 F28L mutant causes the transformation of NIH 3T3 cells (9Lin R. Bagrodia S. Cerione R. Manor D. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 794-797Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar), raising the possibility that Cdc42 F28L-mediated effects on splicing are not a direct outcome of a signaling pathway initiated by Cdc42 but rather reflect the fact that cells expressing Cdc42 F28L are able to grow in low serum. Therefore, we sought a Cdc42 mutant that would uncouple RNA splicing and cell growth. Splicing experiments were performed using lysates from NIH 3T3 cells that stably expressed either Cdc42 F28L or two effector loop mutants of Cdc42 in the activated background, Cdc42 F28L,C37A and Cdc42 F28L,Y40C (Fig.1 B). In contrast to Cdc42 F28L, neither of the effector loop mutants will support the growth of cells in low serum (data not shown). The Cdc42 F28L,Y40C double mutant activates the splicing machinery, whereas Cdc42 F28L,C37A does not (Fig. 1 B). Thus, the activation of splicing by Cdc42 is not dependent on cell growth. Furthermore, this mutational analysis suggests that the Cdc42 targets known to utilize position 40 in the effector loop, such as the CRIB (Cdc42/Rac-interactive binding) domain-containing proteins PAK, ACK, and WASP, are not involved in signaling to the splicing machinery. The identification of Cdc42 effectors for which position 37 is necessary has not been described to date, but it would appear that an effector of this class plays a pivotal role in the Cdc42-RNA processing pathway.Given that the CBC is a downstream target for Cdc42, it seems likely that the regulation of CBC activity underlies the effects of Cdc42 on pre-mRNA splicing. To further explore how signals are conveyed from Cdc42 to the CBC, we tested the abilities of two small molecule inhibitors, rapamycin and wortmannin, to inhibit the activation of the CBC by Cdc42. These drugs inhibit FRAP and PI3 kinase, respectively. HeLa cells were transiently transfected with Cdc42 F28L, and 30 min prior to harvesting, either rapamycin or wortmannin was added. The cells were fractionated and the nuclear fractions were assayed for CBC activity by measuring the photocatalyzed incorporation of [α-32P]GTP into CBP20 as has been described previously (11Wilson K.F. Fortes P. Singh U.S. Ohno M. Mattaj I.W. Cerione R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4166-4173Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Rapamycin reduced CBC activity in the presence of Cdc42 F28L, whereas wortmannin did not (Fig. 2 A) suggesting that FRAP, but not PI3 kinase, is downstream of Cdc42 in the CBC pathway.Figure 2CBC activity promoted by Cdc42 is rapamycin-sensitive and can be promoted by PI3 kinase and S6K. A, HeLa cells were transiently transfected with Myc-tagged Cdc42 F28L, serum-starved for 48 h, and then treated with rapamycin or wortmannin for 30 min. The cytosolic lysates were examined for the expression of Cdc42 using an antibody directed against the Myc-tag on the recombinant protein (upper panel). The nuclear lysates were assayed for CBC activation by photoaffinity labeling CBP20 with [α-32P]GTP (lower panel). B, COS-7 cells were transiently transfected with wild type S6K (S6K, lanes 1 and 3) and/or a constitutively active, myristoylated 110-kDa catalytic subunit of PI3 kinase (110, lanes 2 and 3) and serum-starved for 48 h. The cytosolic lysates were assayed for the presence of S6K and the myristoylated 110-kDa subunit of PI3 kinase using antibodies directed against the Myc- and HA-tags on the recombinant proteins (upper panel). CBC activity in the nucleus was assayed by [α-32P]GTP cross-linking to CBP20 (lower panel).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)FRAP is thought to play a pivotal role in signaling pathways that regulate mRNA translation and is well documented as an upstream activator of S6K (18Brown E.J. Schreiber S.L. Cell. 1996; 86: 517-520Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar, 19Sachs A.B. Sarnow P. Hentze M.W.

This suggested that Cdc42 might signal to the CBC via a FRAP-S6K pathway. However, PI3 kinase is also an upstream activator of S6K (22Chou M.M. Blenis J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 806-814Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar), but wortmannin will not block the Cdc42 activation of the CBC. To further assess the role of PI3 kinase and/or S6K in the activation of the CBC, COS-7 cells were transiently transfected with wild type S6K, a constitutively active form of PI3 kinase, the myristoylated 110-kDa subunit, or the two in tandem. As shown in Fig. 2 B, wild type S6K did not show a detectable activation of the CBC. In contrast, constitutively active PI3 kinase will activate the CBC, and this activation is enhanced when S6K is coexpressed with PI3 kinase. Taken together, these data show that although PI3 kinase is not necessary for the Cdc42-mediated activation of the CBC, it can signal to the CBC, probably through its ability to stimulate S6 kinase activity. The ability of Cdc42 to stimulate S6 kinase activity, independent of PI3 kinase activation, thus represents the most likely pathway by which Cdc42 regulates the CBC.The 80-kDa subunit of the CBC, CBP80, contains two potential S6K phosphorylation consensus sites within its N terminus in a region that coincides with the bipartite NLS (designated NLS1 and NLS2, see Fig.4 C). Thus we examined the ability of S6K to phosphorylate CBP80 in vitro (Fig. 3,A and B). S6K phosphorylated CBP80 to a level similar to that observed when equimolar amounts of GST-S6 were substituted for the CBC as the substrate in the assay (data not shown). To determine whether the phosphorylation occurred within the NLS region, an NLS mutant of CBP80 was examined. This mutant, CBP80 K17A,R18A, has been shown previously to inhibit the nuclear localization of CBP80 (23Izaurralde E. McGuigan C. Mattaj I.-W. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1995; 60: 669-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) and would no longer contain the S6K consensus site at NLS2. Indeed, this mutant fails to serve as a substrate for S6K phosphorylation (Fig. 3 C).Figure 4CBP80 undergoes a growth factor-responsive and rapamycin-sensitive phosphorylation within the N-terminal NLS in vivo. A, PC12 cells were metabolically labeled with [32P]orthophosphoric acid for 3 h and then stimulated with NGF (100 ng/ml) for 15 min. CBP80 was then isolated by immunoprecipitation, and its phosphorylation state was assessed by autoradiography. B, PC12 cells were metabolically labeled for 3 h with [32P]orthophosphoric acid. Thirty minutes prior to NGF treatment, 50 ng/ml rapamycin (Rap) was added as indicated. The cells were harvested and fractionated, and the cytosolic and nuclear lysates were immunoprecipitated using a specific CBP80 antiserum. Immunoprecipitated proteins were detected by autoradiography. C, N-terminal CBP80 sequence. The bipartite NLS is underlined and labeled as NLS1 or NLS2, and alanine mutations were made as shown.

The cells were metabolically labeled with [32P]orthophosphoric acid for 3 h and treated with heregulin for 15 min. Lysates were prepared, and the transfected CBP80 proteins were isolated using an α-KT3 antibody. The immunoprecipitated proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE, and CBP80 was detected by Western blotting using a specific CBP80 antibody (top panel) and by autoradiography (bottom panel).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Figure 3S6K phosphorylates CBP80 in vitroat a position within the N-terminal NLS. A, S6K was immunoprecipitated from COS-7 cells which coexpressed S6K and the myristoylated 110-kDa subunit of PI3 kinase. CBC was added to the S6K in a phosphorylation reaction and incubated for increasing periods of time. CBP80 phosphorylation was detected by autoradiography (top panel), and S6K levels were detected by Western blotting against the Myc-tag on the recombinant S6K. B, immunoprecipitated Myc-S6K was incubated with increasing concentrations of CBC for 30 min in a phosphorylation reaction. The top panel represents CBP80 phosphorylation, and the bottom panel shows S6K levels in the assay. C, partially purified S6K was incubated with recombinant wild type CBC (wt CBP80) or an NLS mutant (K17A,R18A CBP80) in a phosphorylation reaction for 30 min. CBP80 protein levels were detected by Coomassie Blue stain (top panel), and phosphorylation of CBP80 was visualized by autoradiography (bottom panel).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Thus we are presented with an interesting possibility for how signaling from Cdc42 to the CBC proceeds, via a direct S6K-catalyzed phosphorylation of CBP80. Previously, we had shown that the CBC is strongly activated by NGF in PC12 cells and by heregulin in HeLa cells (11Wilson K.F. Fortes P. Singh U.S. Ohno M. Mattaj I.W. Cerione R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4166-4173Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Therefore, PC12 cells were metabolically labeled with [32P]orthophosphoric acid in the presence or absence of NGF. The labeled cells were fractionated, and the CBC was immunoprecipitated from cytosolic and nuclear lysates using a CBP80 antiserum or preimmune serum. Fig.4 A shows that nuclear CBP80 is phosphorylated in a NGF-dependent manner in cells. Phosphorylation of CBP20 was not observed. Additionally, the NGF-dependent phosphorylation of CBP80 was blocked by a 30-min pretreatment of cells with rapamycin (Fig. 4 B).N-terminal alanine mutant constructs of CBP80 were generated to confirm that the in vivo phosphorylation occurs within the S6K phosphorylation consensus sites (Fig. 4 C). These CBP80 constructs were transiently transfected into HeLa cells that were then metabolically labeled and treated with heregulin to promote CBC activation. The mutant constructs were isolated from cell lysates and their phosphorylation states were assessed. The in vivophosphorylation of CBP80 was reduced in the S7A and the T21A,S22A mutants and completely blocked in the CBP80 S7A,T21A,S22A mutant (Fig.4 D). All mutant constructs showed wild type nuclear localization as assessed by immunofluorescence (data not shown). Thus, the in vivo phosphorylation of CBP80 is consistent with a direct phosphorylation by S6K.Finding that CBP80 is phosphorylated at two positions in cells was unexpected based on our in vitro phosphorylation experiments with S6K and the CBC. Phosphorylation of CBP80 by S6K may be restricted to the NLS2 site, and another, yet to be identified kinase could be responsible for the phosphorylation at NLS1. The CBC is nuclear in the steady state, however, it has been suggested that the CBC accompanies the RNA particle through the nuclear pore (24Visa N. Izaurralde E. Ferreira J. Daneholt B. Mattaj I.W. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 5-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar), and releases its cargo in the cytosol to the cytosolic cap-binding protein eIF-4E before rapidly shuttling back to the nucleus. Although mainly cytosolic, the S6K has also been reported in the nucleus, both as a longer isoform containing a NLS sequence (25Coffer P.J. Woodgett J.R. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1994; 198: 780-786Google Scholar, 26Tang T. Hirata Y. Whalin M. Guroff G. J. Neurochem. 1996; 66: 1198Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar, 27Koh H. Jee K. Lee B. Kim J. Kim D.

Sassone-Corsi P. Cell. 1994; 79: 81-91Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Given that the phosphorylation is occurring within the NLS of CBP80, it might be anticipated that a cytosolic phosphorylation would block importin binding to the CBC and thus nuclear localization. Such has been found to be true for diacylglycerol kinase ζ (29Topham M.K. Bunting M. Zimmerman G.A. McIntyre T.M. Blackshear P.J. Prescott S.M. Nature. 1998; 394: 697-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). However, we have not found phosphorylation of CBP80 by S6K to block an interaction with the importins in vitro nor have we observed that aspartic acid mutants, designed to mimic a phosphorylated CBP80, lose their nuclear localization. 2K. F. Wilson, unpublished results. Thus, at present both cytosolic and nuclear phosphorylations of CBP80 by S6K remain a viable mechanism.S6K has been previously identified as an effector for Cdc42 (30Chou M.M. Blenis J.

It is interesting that we have identified a potentially new role for these translational signaling players in CBC activation and RNA processing. This observation suggests a necessary coordination among aspects of gene expression that require the m7G cap structure: cap-dependent RNA splicing, export, and translation.The work reported here also raises some new possibilities regarding how Cdc42 controls cell growth. It has recently been suggested that the involvement of Cdc42 in vesicular trafficking through coatomer interactions is necessary but not sufficient for Cdc42-induced transformation (6Wu W.J. Erickson J.W. Lin R. Cerione R.A. Nature. 2000; 405: 800-803Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). The fact that the Cdc42 F28L,C37A double mutant is both transformation-defective and unable to stimulate RNA splicing suggests an interesting connection between the ability of Cdc42 to mediate RNA processing and induce malignant transformation. Thus, we are currently examining the possibility that CBC mutants, such as phosphorylation-defective CBC, will block Cdc42-induced transformation. Such data would underscore both the importance of Cdc42 in coordinating diverse cellular functions including RNA splicing and the role of CBC-mediated RNA processing in regulated cell growth. Cdc42 is a low molecular weight GTP-binding protein that coordinates multiple cellular events by a regulated binding and hydrolysis of GTP. Transcriptional regulation (1Coso O.A.

Additionally, it has been shown that Cdc42 plays an important role in cell growth control, as a constitutively active form of Cdc42, Cdc42 F28L, induces malignant transformation (9Lin R. Bagrodia S. Cerione R. Manor D. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 794-797Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). We have recently shown that an interaction between Cdc42 and the coatomer subunits of COP-coated vesicles is somehow involved in the transformation signal (6Wu W.J. Erickson J.W. Lin R. Cerione R.A. Nature. 2000; 405: 800-803Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). However, there appears to be a requirement for other Cdc42 targets as well, as deletion of the insert region of Cdc42 blocks transformation (10Wu W.J. Lin R. Cerione R.A. Manor D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16655-16658Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) independent of any interaction with the coatomer complex. What this suggests is that Cdc42 may be orchestrating distinct cellular functions in order to coordinate regulated cell growth. In a previous study, we observed that activated forms of Cdc42 were capable of stimulating the nuclear cap-binding complex (CBC)1 to bind capped RNAs (11Wilson K.F. Fortes P. Singh U.S. Ohno M.

In binding to RNAs containing a m7G cap structure, the CBC has been implicated in a number of fundamental aspects of RNA processing including pre-mRNA splicing (12Izaurralde E. Lewis J. McGuigan C.

Importantly, the CBC has also been shown to be a nuclear end point for extracellular stimuli such as growth factors and cell stress stimulants (11Wilson K.F. Fortes P. Singh U.S. Ohno M. Mattaj I.W.

In this study we have investigated the possibility that Cdc42 might be involved in the signal regulation of RNA processing via the CBC. Specifically, we find that activated alleles of Cdc42 can stimulate splicing activity in a manner that is dependent on amino acid 37 of the effector loop. As the CBC plays a pivotal role in cap-dependent pre-mRNA splicing, we have investigated the Cdc42 pathway leading to CBC activation and find that this pathway proceeds via the Cdc42 effector, pp70 S6 kinase (S6K). Rapamycin inhibits the Cdc42-induced activation of the CBC, whereas S6K, together with PI3 kinase, will induce the CBC to bind capped RNAs. Additionally, S6K can phosphorylate the CBCin vitro at a site that undergoes a rapamycin-sensitive, growth factor-dependent phosphorylation in"

We examined the effects of mutating the highly conserved Thr247 residue in EnvZ. Using purified C-terminal domains of wild-type and mutant EnvZ proteins, we demonstrate that Thr247 plays a vital role in EnvZ function, variously affecting its autokinase and phosphotransferase activities, but mostly its function as a phosphatase. The cytoplasmic domain of EnvZ (EnvZc) is composed of three segments: the linker domain (residues 180–222), domain A (residues 223–289), and domain B (residues 290–450). It has been shown that the isolated domain A itself can dephosphorylate phosphorylated OmpR. Here we show that mutating Thr247 to Arg in domain A abolishes its phosphatase activity.

Typically, the dimeric histidine kinase undergoes ATP-dependent trans-autophosphorylation on a specific histidine residue and subsequently transfers the phosphoryl group to an aspartate residue on its cognate response regulator. Phosphorylation of the response regulator alters its transcriptional, enzymatic, or mechanistic properties, bringing about a change in cellular behavior. Currently, >300 such signaling systems are known in prokaryotes (6Grebe T.W. Stock J.B. Adv. Microb. Physiol. 1999; 41: 139-227Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). His-Asp phosphorelay systems also find highly specialized applications in lower eukaryotes (7Loomis W.F. Shaulsky G. Wang N. Curr. Opin.

One of the most extensively studied His-Asp phosphorelay signal transduction systems is the EnvZ/OmpR-mediated osmosensory pathway inEscherichia coli (8Forst S.A. Roberts D.L. Res.

The level of OmpR-P in the cell reciprocally regulates the production of these porins, with OmpF and OmpC being predominantly produced under low and high osmolar conditions, respectively (18Hall M.N.

Representing a large class of bifunctional histidine kinase/phosphatases, EnvZ exhibits dual opposing functions, both phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of OmpR (1Hoch, J. A., and Silhavy, T. J. (eds) (1995) Two-component Signal Transduction, American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.Google Scholar). It has been proposed that the osmotic signal regulates the OmpR-P level in the cell by modulating the ratio of the kinase to phosphatase activity of EnvZ (11Yang Y. Inouye M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 11057-11061Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 12Yang Y. Park H. Inouye M. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 231: 335-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 23Russo F.D.

Biol. 1993; 232: 484-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Structurally, EnvZ consists of an N-terminal short cytosolic segment, the first membrane-spanning segment (TM1), a periplasmic domain, the second transmembrane segment (TM2), and a C-terminal cytosolic domain. The cytosolic domain has the highly conserved regions for histidine kinases: the H, N, F, G1, and G2 boxes (3Parkinson J.S. Kofoid E.C. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1992; 26: 71-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (1237) Google Scholar) and the recently recognized G3 box (25Dutta R. Inouye M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 24-28Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (608) Google Scholar). Domain dissection studies revealed that the enzymatically active kinase/phosphatase segment (residues 223–450) of EnvZ consists of two complementary functional domains (26Park H. Saha S.K. Inouye M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Qin L. Inouye M. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 34: 633-640Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). The linker domain (residues 180–222) connects the kinase/phosphatase segment to TM2 and is responsible for transducing the signal (see Fig. 1 A) (24Jin T. Inouye M. J. Mol.

The invariant His243 residue is located in the middle of helix I of each subunit, completely exposed to the solvent. His243 is involved in both the kinase and phosphatase activities of EnvZ (31Hsing W. Russo F.D. Bernd K.K. Silhavy T. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 4538-4546Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 32Dutta R.

In this study, we report the identification of Thr247 in the H box on helix I of domain A as a critical active-site residue in EnvZ. Using EnvZc(T247X) mutant proteins, generated by site-directed mutagenesis, we provide clear evidence that Thr247 plays an important role, affecting all EnvZ catalytic activities, most importantly, the phosphatase function. Plasmid pET11a-EnvZc (28Park H. Inouye M. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 4382-4390Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was used to express the cytoplasmic domain of EnvZ (EnvZc, residues 180–450). Using this plasmid as a template and two sets of oligonucleotide primers, Thr247 was mutagenized using Pfu polymerase (Stratagene). Using the primers 5′-AGTCACGACTTGCGC(A/G)(C/A)GCCGCTGACGCGTATTC-3′ and 5′-GAATACGCGTCAGCGGC(G/T)(T/C)GCGCAAGTCGTGGACT-3′, plasmids pZcT247A, pZcT247E, and pZcT247K, carrying the mutations EnvZc(T247A), EnvZc(T247E), and EnvZc(T247K), respectively, were generated.

Using the primers 5′-AGTCACGACTTGCGCAATCCGCTGACGCGTAT-3′ and 5′-ATACGCGTCAGCGGATTGCGCAAGTCGTGACT-3′, plasmid pZcT247N was generated.

The pTazT247X plasmids (X = Ala, Glu, Lys, Cys, Ser, Tyr, Arg, Asn, or Gln) carrying mutations of the taz1-1 gene were constructed by ligating theNdeI-HindIII fragment from pTJ003 (24Jin T. Inouye M. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 232: 484-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) and theNdeI-HindIII fragments from the pZcT247X plasmids (created for the in vitroassays in this study). Plasmid pTazT247R was constructed by ligating the NdeI-HindIII fragment from pTJ003 and theNdeI-HindIII fragment from pZcT247R, carrying the T247R mutation. E. coli BL21(DE3) was used for the expression and purification of the cytoplasmic domain of EnvZ (EnvZc, residues 180–450) and the EnvZc(T247X) mutant proteins. Cells harboring different plasmids were cultured to mid-log phase when 1 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside was added. After another 3-h incubation, the cells were harvested and broken with a French press. The EnvZc and EnvZc(T247X) mutant proteins were purified by 40% ammonium sulfate fractionation and subsequent Sephacryl S-100HR gel-filtration column chromatography (15Forst S. Delgado J. Inouye M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 6052-6056Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Proteins were quantified using the Bio-Rad protein assay reagent. The EnvZc and EnvZc(T247X) mutant proteins (30 μg) were digested with 0.3 μg of trypsin (Type XI, Sigma) in digestion buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) containing 150 mm KCl, 20 mmβ-mercaptoethanol, 20% glycerol, and 1 mm EDTA) at room temperature for 30 and 60 min. The reaction was stopped by adding 2× Tricine/SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) sample buffer (0.9 m Tris-HCl (pH 8.45), 24% glycerol, 8% (w/v) SDS, and 0.005% phenol red) and boiling for 5 min. The products were analyzed by Tricine-PAGE (9.6% spacer gel and 16.5% separation gel) (34Schagger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10410) Google Scholar) after staining with Coomassie Blue. The EnvZc and EnvZc(T247X) mutant proteins (2 μm) were each incubated at room temperature in autokinase reaction buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) containing 50 mm KCl, 5 mm CaCl2, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 5% glycerol) with 50 μm ATP and 0.25 μl of [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol, 10 mCi/ml; PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Aliquots were removed from the reaction mixture at 0.5, 1.0, 2.5, and 4.0 min, and the reaction was stopped with 5× SDS loading buffer (10% (w/v) SDS, 3 mmβ-mercaptoethanol, and 40% glycerol). The reaction mixture was then subjected to 17.5% SDS-PAGE. The dried gel was analyzed with a PhosphorImager and also exposed for autoradiography. Phosphotransfer Assays—Each protein (50 μg) was first autophosphorylated using autokinase reaction buffer in a 200-μl final reaction volume for 15 min at room temperature. The reaction contents were exchanged into 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) containing 50 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 5 mmβ-mercaptoethanol, and 15% glycerol, and free ATP was removed using Ultrafree centrifugal filter tubes (UFV5BGC00, Millipore Corp.). The reaction mixture was concentrated to 50 μl. Phosphorylated EnvZc protein (wild-type/mutant; 2 μm) thus prepared was incubated with 4 μm OmpR in phosphatase buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) containing 50 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 5% glycerol) at room temperature. Aliquots were removed at 0, 20, 40, 120, and 300 s. Another set of experiments was conducted on ice, and aliquots were removed at 15 and 30 s. Reactions were stopped with 5× SDS loading buffer. The products were separated by 17.5% SDS-PAGE. The gel was dried and exposed for autoradiography. Phosphorylated OmpR was prepared as previously reported (26Park H. Saha S.K. Inouye M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6728-6732Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). To remove free ATP from OmpR-P, it was washed several times with 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) containing 50 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 5 mmβ-mercaptoethanol, and 15% glycerol using Ultrafree centrifugal filter tubes. Phosphatase activities were determined essentially as described previously (11Yang Y. Inouye M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 11057-11061Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar) in the presence of 10 mmMgCl2. EnvZc or EnvZc(T247X) mutant proteins (4 μm) and OmpR (8 μm) were each incubated with 50 μm ATP and 0.25 of μl [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol, 10 mCi/ml) in autophosphorylation buffer with 5 mm MgCl2. The mixture was incubated at room temperature. Aliquots were removed at 30 and 60 min. The reaction was stopped with 5× SDS loading buffer, and the products were separated by 17.5% SDS-PAGE. The gel was dried, analyzed with a PhosphorImager, and also exposed for autoradiography. E. coli RU1012 cells (φ(ompC-lacZ) 10–25 ΔenvZ::Kmr) (35Utsumi R. Brissette R.E. Rampersaud A. Forst S.A. Oosawa K. Inouye M. Science. 1989; 245: 1246-1249Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar) were used for thein vivo β-galactosidase assays. The pTazT247Xplasmids and the vector plasmid pINIII (24Jin T. Inouye M. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 232: 484-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) were each transformed into the envZ deletion strain RU1012. Cells harboring different plasmids were grown to mid-log phase in M9 medium containing varying concentrations (0–7 mm) of aspartate. The β-galactosidase activity of each cell preparation was assayed (36Miller F. Immunochemistry. 1972; 9: 217-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Threonine is the most preferred amino acid residue at the H+4 position in the conserved H box of histidine kinases (6Grebe T.W. Stock J.B. Adv. Microb. Physiol. 1999; 41: 139-227Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The consensus sequence of the H box is as follows: h-HahbTPL. The highly conserved Thr247 residue is strategically positioned just one turn below the phospho-accepting His243 residue on helix I (Fig. 1 B). Historically, a mutant of Thr247, EnvZ(T247R) (EnvZ11), was first reported as a TP-1-resistant mutant (tpo-11) that pleiotropically repressed synthesis of OmpF, alkaline phosphatase, and several proteins of the maltose regulon, but increased OmpC production (18Hall M.N. Silhavy T.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1981; 151: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 37Wandersman C. Moreno F. Schwartz M. J. Bacteriol. 1980; 143: 1374-1383Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).In vitro biochemical studies established that the EnvZ11 protein is a “superkinase” that is deficient in dephosphorylating OmpR-P (17Aiba H. Nakasai F. Mizushima S. Mizuno T. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 1989; 264: 14090-14094Google Scholar). ompR77 (OmpR(L16Q) mutant) was later isolated as a suppressor for the EnvZ11 phenotype (38Matsuyama S. Mizuno T. Mizushima S. J. Bacteriol. 1986; 168: 1309-1314Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), and the phosphotransfer reaction between the two proteins was found to be markedly low (17Aiba H. Nakasai F. Mizushima S. Mizuno T. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 1989; 264: 14090-14094Google Scholar). In the NMR solution structure of domain A of EnvZ, the segment (residues 242–248) containing the invariant His243 residue and the conserved residues Thr247 and Pro248 is poorly defined (root mean square deviation of 1.14 Å for backbone atoms and 1.99 Å for heavy atoms when calculated with only these residues; compare with the average pairwise root mean square deviation of 1.10 Å for backbone atoms and 1.90 Å for heavy atoms for the rest of the NMR-derived structure of domain A of EnvZ). Moreover, the backbone NH groups in this region exhibit a fast hydrogen-deuterium rate, again indicating that this region is structurally dynamic, probably undergoing a conformational equilibrium between helical and unfolded states. It has been proposed that the structural dynamism observed in this segment in helix I might play a role in the catalytic function of EnvZ (30Tomomori C. Tanaka T. Dutta R. Park H. Saha S.K. Zhu Y. Ishima R. Liu D. Tong K.I. Kurokawa H. Qian H. Inouye M. Ikura M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 729-734Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Taken together, the previous genetic and biochemical analyses and the recent structural studies strongly implicate the conserved Thr247residue in EnvZ function. To further investigate the role of this residue, we have characterized EnvZc(T247X) mutants generated by site-directed mutagenesis. We mutated plasmid pET11a-EnvZc, which expresses the cytoplasmic domain of EnvZ (residues 180–450), and replaced Thr247 with Ala, Glu, Lys, Arg, Cys, Ser, or Tyr by site-directed mutagenesis. The various plasmids were transformed intoE. coli BL21(DE3) cells. The proteins were overexpressed and subsequently purified by a two-step procedure involving 40% ammonium sulfate precipitation and Sephacryl S-100 gel-filtration chromatography. All the mutant proteins were soluble and stable upon storage at −20 °C. To check whether the mutation of Thr247 in EnvZ resulted in any major alteration of conformation in the mutant proteins, they were subjected to trypsin digestion. 30 μg of each protein was digested with 0.3 μg of trypsin at room temperature. Aliquots were removed at 30 and 60 min and analyzed by Tricine/SDS-PAGE. No remarkable change was observed in the digestion profiles of the EnvZc and EnvZc(T247X) mutant proteins (Fig. 2). Whereas the EnvZc(T247E), EnvZc(T247K), and EnvZc(T247A) mutant proteins were more susceptible to trypsin digestion (in decreasing order) than EnvZc, the EnvZc(T247R) protein was more resistant. These results indicate that the substitutions we made (Ala, Glu, Lys, Cys, Ser, Tyr, and Arg) at Thr247 in EnvZ did not significantly affect the conformation of the protein. The autophosphorylation activities of the EnvZc(T247X) mutant proteins were compared with that of EnvZc in an in vitro biochemical assay using [γ-32P]ATP as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The time course of incorporation of the phosphoryl group into the proteins was followed and is shown in Fig. 3 (A and B). Interestingly, the incorporation of the phosphoryl group into the mutant protein was variable depending on the specific substitution (Tyr/Arg ≫ Thr > Ser > Cys ≫ Ala > Lys > Glu). Densitometric analysis revealed that the maximum level of incorporation of the phosphoryl group into EnvZc(T247Y) and EnvZc(T247R) was ∼1.6 times higher than that into EnvZc (Fig. 3 B), whereas the incorporation into the EnvZc(T247E), EnvZc(T247K), and EnvZc(T247A) mutant proteins was significantly lower that that into wild-type EnvZc. Of the mutant proteins, EnvZc(T247S) followed by EnvZc(T247C) exhibited levels of autokinase activity that were close to those of wild-type EnvZc (Fig. 3 B). Since the autokinase levels varied significantly with the nature of the substituting amino acid, it is unlikely that Thr247 plays a catalytic role in the autokinase activity of EnvZ. It is clear though that Thr247 significantly influences the autophosphorylation reaction. The autophosphorylation reaction of EnvZ is metal ion-dependent (39Rampersaud A. Utsumi R. Delgado J. Forst S.A. Inouye M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 7633-7637Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To further investigate the higher rate of autophosphorylation observed in EnvZc(T247R) and EnvZc(T247Y), we compared the divalent metal ion dependences of the autokinase activities of these two mutant proteins with those of EnvZc and EnvZc(T247S). Each protein was autophosphorylated in autokinase reaction buffer containing either 10 mm EDTA or 10 mm MgCl2. Aliquots were removed at 1 and 3 min, and the course of the reaction was followed as shown in Fig. 4. EnvZc(T247R) was unique in being able to autophosphorylate well not only in the presence of Mg2+ ions (Fig. 4, lanes 9–12), but also in the absence of divalent metal ions (in 10 mm EDTA). Interestingly, EnvZc(T247Y), which also has a higher rate of autophosphorylation compared with wild-type EnvZc, did not show a similar divalent metal ion independence (Fig. 4, lanes 13–16). This aspect is being separately investigated. Phosphorylated EnvZ transfers its phosphoryl group from His243 to Asp55 on OmpR (39Ramp"

After binding to Smad4, the complex enters the nucleus and interacts with other transcription factors to activate gene transcription. Unlike other Smads, Smad7 inhibits phosphorylation of Smad2 and Smad3, and its transcription is induced by TGF-β, suggesting a negative feedback loop. Here, we show that TFE3 and Smad3 synergistically mediate TGF-β-induced transcription from the Smad7 promoter by binding to an E-box and two adjacent Smad binding elements (SBEs), respectively. A precise 3-base pair spacer between one SBE and the E-box is essential. Previously, we showed that a similar arrangement between a SBE and an E-box of an element is essential for TGF-β-dependent transcription of the plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 gene (PAI-1) and that TGF-β-induced phosphorylation of Smad3 triggers its association with TFE3. Thus, TFE3-Smad3 response elements may represent a common target for TGF-β-induced gene expression.

We showed previously that transcription factor TFE3 and Smads cooperate to mediate TGF-β-induced transcription of plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) gene (22Hua X. Liu X. Ansari D.O. Lodish H.F. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3084-3095Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). In the PAI-1 promoter, the E-box, which is the binding site for TFE3, and one SBE are separated by a 3-base pair spacer (22Hua X. Liu X. Ansari D.O. Lodish H.F. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3084-3095Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar, 23Hua X. Miller Z.A. Wu G. Shi Y. Lodish H.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 13130-13135Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). An intact E-box is essential for basal as well as TGF-β-induced PAI-1 transcription, and two of the three SBEs are essential for TGF-β-induced, but not basal transcription. Most strikingly, the spacer between the SBE and the E-box must be precisely 3 bp. Here, we show that the fully functional TGF-β-inducible element in the Smad7 promoter also requires two SBEs followed by precisely 3 bp and an intact E-box. Thus, TFE3·Smad3 complex may mediate TGF-β-dependent induction of a group of gene targets. Genomic DNA containing the mouse Smad7 promoter was isolated from a 129Sv female kidney DNA library (Stratagene) using as probe a 296-bp EST clone spanning the 5′-untranslated region of the cDNA sequence. Positive clones containing a 5.5-kilobase pair BamHI fragment with the Smad7 promoter were isolated and subjected to promoter analysis (10Nagarajan R.P. Zhang J. Li W. Chen Y. J. Biol.

To construct luciferase reporter genes driven by an intact Smad7 promoter, the 285-bp KpnI/StuI fragment of the Smad7 promoter was cloned into the SmaI site of the pGL3 vector (Promega) to generate pS7-Luc. The E-box sequence CACGTG in this 285-bp promoter was mutated by designing mutated oligonucleotides followed by polymerase chain reaction amplification to acCGac to generate pS7-mE-Luc. To construct luciferase reporter genes driven by SS7, a TGF-β-inducible 33-bp fragment from the Smad7 promoter, we designed wild type or various mutant oligonucleotides, which span this region of the promoter as indicated in Fig.3 B. The annealed oligonucleotides were inserted into theKpnI/PstI site of PE2.1-Luc (23Hua X. Miller Z.A. Wu G. Shi Y. Lodish H.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

For luciferase assays, cells were seeded at a density of 500,000 cells/well in 12-well plates for 16 h and transfected with various luciferase reporter genes and 0.3 μg/well pCMV-gal encoding the LacZ gene (Clontech). The LacZ gene was transfected as an internal control to normalize the luciferase activity (23Hua X. Miller Z.A. Wu G. Shi Y. Lodish H.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

T7 epitope-tagged TFE3 was synthesized from pET-TFE3 with the TNT T7 Coupled Reticulocyte Lysate System (Promega) in a reaction containing methionine.

Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Gel shift reactions were carried out in a total volume of 30 μl at room temperature as described previously (23Hua X. Miller Z.A. Wu G. Shi Y. Lodish H.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 13130-13135Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). 32P-labeled probes were made by end-labeling the oligonucleotides with 32P-labeled ATP and polynucleotide kinase. Radiolabeled DNAs (5 × 104 cpm) were added to the reaction 10 min after the addition of TFE3 or Smad3, and the reactions were incubated for 20 min. This step was followed by separation in a 4% polyacrylamide gel; electrophoresis was carried out at 20 mA for 70 min. To supershift the DNA binding activity with antibodies, 1 μl of anti-T7 antibody (Novagen) was added to each reaction, and the reactions were loaded onto the gel after 15 min of incubation. All signals were detected on a Fujix BAS2000 phosphorimager. The Smad7 promoter contains one E-box (CACGTG, −254 to −259, Fig.1 A). Just upstream are two palindromic SBEs (GTCT; AGAC in reverse), and 3 bp separate the E-box from the adjacent SBE. In the PAI-1 promoter, TFE3 binds to the E-box; this sequence is essential for basal as well as TGF-β induced transcription of the PAI-1 gene. Fig. 1 B shows that the same results were obtained with the Smad7 promoter. The 285-bp wild type Smad7 promoter (S7) mediated robust transcription induced by TGF-β. However, point mutations in the E-box markedly decreased both the basal and TGF-β-inducible promoter activities (left panel). To further dissect the TGF-β-inducible promoter, we studied a 33-bp fragment from S7 (SS7, −254 to −286) that includes the critical E-box as well as two SBEs. TGF-β caused a 4-fold increase in SS7 promoter activity (Fig. 1 B, right panel). However, mutations in the SS7 E-box completely abolished both basal and TGF-β-induced transcription from the SS7 promoter. In the same experiment, both the basal and TGF-β-induced transcription from SS7 were about 5% of the activity of the full-length Smad7 promoter (note the different scales in the left andright panels in Fig. 1 B), and thus other elements in the Smad7 promoter must also regulate its expression. Nevertheless, Fig. 1 C shows that the promoter activity of SS7 is higher than that of PE2, a well characterized small promoter element from the TGF-β-inducible PAI-1 gene, which also contains an essential E-box (22Hua X. Liu X. Ansari D.O. Lodish H.F. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3084-3095Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). Together, these results indicate that the E-box, which can bind TFE3 specifically, plays a critical role in TGF-β induction of the Smad7 promoter, but other transcription factors must also play a role to increase overall transcription induced by TGF-β.Figure 1Important role of the E-box sequence in the TGF-β-inducible Smad7 promoter.

Theleft panel shows results of luciferase assays with the wild type or mutant 285-bp promoter, and the right panel shows the results from the wild type or mutant 33-bp small Smad7 promoter. HepG2 cells were transfected with 1.5 μg of luciferase reporter genes as indicated and 0.3 μg of pCMV-gal containing the LacZgene as an internal control. The transfected cells were treated with or without TGF-β (200 pm) for 20 h as described (22Hua X. Liu X. Ansari D.O. Lodish H.F. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3084-3095Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar).

C, comparison of the 33-bp small Smad7 promoter and a well characterized TGF-β-inducible minimal PAI-1 promoter PE2 in their activation by TGF-β.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To test whether TFE3 participates in the TGF-β-induced transcription from the Smad7 promoter, and if so, whether it does so through the E-box sequence, we cotransfected cells with various luciferase reporter genes together with either TFE3 or Smad3 (Fig.2). Panel B shows that the full-length S7 Smad7 promoter mediates robust induction of transcription by TGF-β, and overexpression of either TFE3 or Smad3 hardly affects basal or TGF-β-induced transcription. However, cotransfection of both TFE3 and Smad3 dramatically increased both basal and TGF-β-induced transcriptions from the Smad7 promoter. Importantly, mutations in the E-box sequence decreased both basal and TGF-β-induced transcriptions whether or not TFE3 and Smad3 were overexpressed (Fig. 2 A). Fig. 2 B shows that a similar situation is obtained with the SS7 promoter fragment, which includes the critical E-box as well as two SBEs. Cotransfection of either TFE3 or Smad3 did not markedly affect either basal or TGF-β-inducible transcription. In contrast, a combination of TFE3 and Smad3 dramatically increased basal transcription from SS7; recall that, when overexpressed, Smad3 is able to activate gene transcription even in the absence of TGF-β (25Liu X. Sun Y. Constantinescu S.N. Karam E. Weinberg R.A. Lodish H.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 10669-10674Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar, 26Zhang Y. Feng X.-H. Wu R.-Y. Derynck R. Nature. 1996; 383: 168-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (751) Google Scholar). Cotransfection of TFE3 and Smad3 also caused an increase in TGF-β-induced SS7 activity. Importantly, an SS7 promoter with a mutation in the E-box was completely inactive even when TFE3 and Smad3 were overexpressed, clearly demonstrating that TFE3 and Smad3 require a functional E-box in the Smad7 promoter to mediate TGF-β-induced transcription. Taken together, these results clearly demonstrate that TFE3 and Smad3 cooperatively mediate TGF-β-induced transcription from the Smad7 promoter, and this cooperation requires a functional TFE3 binding site, the E-box. We previously reported that two essential SBEs followed by an E-box are essential for TGF-β-induced transcription from the PE2 fragment of the PAI-1 promoter. Importantly, the spacer between the SBE and the E-box must be precisely 3 bp, although the sequence of the spacer seems immaterial (23Hua X. Miller Z.A. Wu G. Shi Y. Lodish H.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 13130-13135Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Fig. 3 A shows that the mouse, human, and rat Smad7 promoters all contain two palindromic SBEs followed by a 3-bp spacer, GGC, and then by an E-box. Fig.3 B shows that, as expected, after transfection into HepG2 cells, SS7 mediates robust transcription induced by TGF-β. Either insertion (SS7 +1) or deletion (SS7 −1) of one base in the spacer region abolished TGF-β-induced transcription from the SS7 promoter. Mutations in either the first (SS7 mS1) or the second SBE (SS7 mS2) also completely abrogated TGF-β-induced transcription from the SS7 promoter, and confirming the data from Fig. 1 C, mutations in the SS7 E-box abolished both basal and TGF-β-induced transcription. These results strongly suggest that the length of the spacer is important for the cooperation of TFE3 and Smad proteins in TGF-β-induced gene transcription. Thus, TGF-β-induced transcription from the PAI-1 and Smad7 promoters are similar in that they require two SBEs and a precise 3 bp spacer between one SBE and the E-box. We tested whether insertion or deletion of a single base pair impairs the ability of either TFE3 or Smad3 to bind the Smad7 promoter. To this end, we first incubated 32P-labeled 33-bp wild type or mutant SS7 DNA fragments with TFE3 synthesized in vitro by a reticulocyte lysate followed by a gel shift assay (Fig.4 A). The reticulocyte lysate contains some protein(s) able to bind to this DNA (lane 1); this species probably binds to the E-box because mutations in the E-box abolished the binding (lane 2). Lysates containing in vitro translated TFE3 exhibited a new band in the gel shift assay (lane 5). As expected, this TFE3 protein did not bind to the SS7 DNA containing a mutant E-box (lane 6) but did bind normally to SS7 DNAs with altered spacing between the SBE and E-box (lanes 7 and 8). Furthermore, the T7 epitope-tagged TFE3 was supershifted by an anti-T7 epitope antibody (lanes 9, 11, and 12). These results suggest that insertion or deletion of a single base pair in the spacer region did not change the binding affinity between TFE3 and the E-box sequence. Similar gel shift assays showed that GST-Smad3 bound to the32P-labeled wild type SS7 DNA fragment (Fig. 4 B,lane 2). It bound equally well to SS7 DNAs containing a mutant E-box (lane 3) and to SS7 DNAs with altered spacing between the SBE and E-box (lanes 4 and 5). As a control, GST did not bind to the wild type SS7 DNA fragment (lane 1). Thus, an insertion or deletion in the 3-bp spacer region does not decrease the ability of Smad3 to bind the promoter DNA. Here, we dissected the Smad7 promoter and elucidated the sequences required for transcriptional induction by TGF-β. In doing so, we uncovered striking similarities with the sequences in the PAI-1 promoter and the transcription factors essential for induction by TGF-β. Both the Smad7 and PAI-1 promoters contain a SBE separated by precisely 3 bp from an E-box (23Hua X. Miller Z.A. Wu G. Shi Y. Lodish H.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 13130-13135Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Both promoters also contain a second SBE upstream of the first, although the spacing between the two SBEs is different in the two cases. In both minimal promoters, SS7 for Smad7 and PE2 for PAI-1, mutation of the E-box sequence completely abolished basal and TGF-β-induced transcription. In both the PE2 and SS7 promoters, mutation of either of the two SBEs abolished TGF-β-induced transcription but did not affect basal gene expression. Most strikingly, in both the PE2 and SS7 promoters, the addition or deletion of 1 base pair to the 3-base pair spacer also abolished TGF-β-induced transcription but did not affect basal gene expression. Both the Smad7 promoter (Fig. 2) and the PAI-1 promoter (22Hua X. Liu X. Ansari D.O. Lodish H.F. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3084-3095Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar) were synergistically activated by TFE3 and Smad3. As with the PAI-1 promoter, cooperation between TFE3 and Smad3 in TGF-β-induced activation of the Smad7 promoter requires the TFE3 binding site, the E-box, because point mutations of the E-box sequence markedly reduced TGF-β-dependent transcription from the full-length Smad7 promoter S7 (Fig. 2). These point mutations in the E-box sequence completely abolished the transcription driven by SS7, a minimal Smad7 promoter, in the presence or absence of TGF-β (Fig. 2 B), suggesting the critical role of TFE3 in TGF-β-induced transcription of the Smad7 gene as well as in its basal transcription. Whereas point mutations in the full-length Smad7 promoter S7 still allowed about 20% of the wild type level of TGF-β-induced transcriptional activity (Fig. 1 B), the same mutation in the E-box in the 33-bp minimal Smad7 promoter, SS7, completely abrogated inducibility by TGF-β (Fig. 1 B, right panel). These results suggest that other transcription factors binding other sites in the full-length Smad7 promoter play a role in increasing the overall transcription induced by TGF-β. These results are consistent with a recent report by Brodin et al. (12Brodin G. Ahgren A. ten Dijke P. Heldin C.-H. Heuchel R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29023-29030Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar) showing that AP-1 and Sp1 binding sites downstream of the SBE repeats in the Smad7 promoter are functionally important for basal as well as TGF-β-induced transcription from the promoter (12Brodin G. Ahgren A. ten Dijke P. Heldin C.-H. Heuchel R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29023-29030Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Recently, the E-box sequence downstream of the SBEs was also shown to be important for TGF-β-induced gene transcription (13Stopa M. Anhuf D. Terstegen L. Gatsios P. Gressner A.M. Dooley S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29308-29317Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Together, these results strongly argue that multiple transcription factors, including TFE3, AP-1, and Sp1, may cooperate with Smad proteins in mediating TGF-β-induced Smad7 transcription. The model we proposed for TGF-β-induced transcription of the PAI-1 promoter thus applies to the Smad7 promoter. In brief, TGF-β induces phosphorylation of Smad3, and phosphorylated Smad3 binds to TFE3. TFE3 may also bind to Smad4 in response to TGF-β. We do not yet know whether TFE3 binds Smad2 nor do we know the stochiometry of TFE3, Smad3, and Smad4 complex. Second, a complex of Smad3, Smad4, and TFE3 cooperatively binds in a precise geometry to the PE2 or Smad7 promoter, such that 3 base pairs separate the E-box from one of the two essential Smad binding sites. Following binding to DNA, the Smad3·Smad4·TFE3 complex likely recruits transcription coactivators such as p300 and CBP (27Feng X. Zhang Y. Wu R. Derynck R.

This model suggests a critical role for combinations of at least two SBEs and binding sites for other transcription factors as well as a requirement for a fixed spacer between the two types of binding sites in achieving high specificity of TGF-β-induced gene transcription.

This activity makes the rate of transducin GTPase an essential factor in determining the duration of photoresponse in vertebrate rods and cones. In photoreceptors, the slow intrinsic rate of transducin GTPase is accelerated by the complex of the ninth member of the regulators of G proteinsignaling family with the long splice variant of type 5G protein β subunit (RGS9·Gβ5L). However, physiologically rapid GTPase is observed only when transducin forms a complex with its effector, the γ subunit of cGMP phosphodiesterase (PDEγ). In this study, we addressed the mechanism by which PDEγ regulates the rate of transducin GTPase. We found that RGS9·Gβ5L alone has a significant ability to activate transducin GTPase, but its affinity for transducin is low. PDEγ acts by enhancing the affinity between activated transducin and RGS9·Gβ5L by more than 15-fold, which is evident both from kinetic measurements of transducin GTPase rate and from protein binding assays with immobilized transducin. Furthermore, our data indicate that a single RGS9·Gβ5L molecule is capable of accelerating the GTPase activity of ∼100 transducin molecules/s. This rate is faster than the rates reported previously for any RGS protein and is sufficient for timely photoreceptor recovery in both rod and cone photoreceptors.

It is uniquely designed to ensure both a high degree of signal amplification and fast signal termination on the physiological subsecond time scale (reviewed in Refs. 1Chabre M. Deterre P. Eur. J.

Vision begins upon light excitation of rhodopsin, which activates many molecules of the photoreceptor-specific G protein, transducin. Activated transducin binds to the inhibitory γ subunits of its effector, PDE,1 increasing its catalytic activity; this leads to a decrease in the intracellular cGMP level, the closure of cGMP-gated ion channels of the photoreceptor plasma membrane, and progression of the photoresponse. Photoresponse termination requires the timely inactivation of PDE, which occurs when GTP bound to transducin is hydrolyzed to GDP and inorganic phosphate by the GTPase activity of transducin. However, the intrinsic rate of transducin GTPase is much slower than the rate of photoresponse recovery. In the photoreceptor, this problem is solved by the action of a powerful mechanism of transducin GTPase acceleration (reviewed in Ref. 4Arshavsky V.Y. Pugh Jr., E.N. Neuron. 1998; 20: 11-14Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Intensive studies over the past decade have indicated that this mechanism is based on a cooperative action between two protein components, the RGS9·Gβ5L complex (5He W. Cowan C.W. Wensel T.G.

In vivo experiments with transgenic mice indicate that both components are essential to ensure photoresponse recovery on a physiological time scale (11Tsang S.H. Burns M.E. Calvert P.D. Gouras P.

Nature. 2000; 403: 557-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). It is now established that the primary catalytic role in activation of GTP hydrolysis belongs to the RGS homology domain of RGS9·Gβ5L. This domain stabilizes the conformation (“transition state”) of the transducin α subunit, which is most favorable for GTP hydrolysis. PDEγ itself does not activate transducin GTPase but rather enhances the activity of RGS9·Gβ5L. The goal of this study was to elucidate the mechanism by which PDEγ enhances the activation of transducin GTPase by the RGS9·Gβ5L complex. In principle, two possibilities could be considered. First, PDEγ could directly contribute to GTP hydrolysis, for example, by further stabilizing the Gαt transition state beyond the action of the RGS domain. Second, it could act by increasing the affinity between activated Gαt and RGS9·Gβ5L. Previous efforts to answer this question using the expressed RGS homology domain of RGS9 yielded contradictory results. McEntafferet al. (13McEntaffer R.L. Natochin M. Artemyev N.O. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 4931-4937Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) reported that PDEγ acts catalytically by increasing the maximal GTPase rate ∼2-fold and that it does not change the apparent affinity between the RGS9 homology domain and transducin. To the contrary, Skiba et al. (14Skiba N.P. Yang C.S. Huang T. Bae H. Hamm H.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8770-8778Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) presented evidence that the entire PDEγ effect consists of an ∼3-fold increase in the affinity between the RGS9 homology domain and transducin. The reason for this incongruity is unknown. Furthermore, it is unclear whether the RGS9 homology domain could serve as a good model for studying the effects of PDEγ because the degree of transducin GTPase activation by PDEγ observed with native RGS9·Gβ5L within the ROS membranes is at least one order of magnitude higher than the effect observed with the domain alone (10Arshavsky V.Y.

This finding implies that the physiologically relevant mechanism of PDEγ action should be addressed with the whole RGS9·Gβ5L complex. In this study, we examined the mechanism by which PDEγ potentiates the GAP activity of the native RGS9·Gβ5L complex in bovine photoreceptor membranes. We used a combination of kinetic analysis and direct binding assays and found that the major effect of PDEγ on the activation of transducin GTPase is an increase in the affinity between activated transducin and RGS9·Gβ5L by >1 order of magnitude. This work provides the first explanation of how an RGS protein and a G protein effector cooperate in regulating the lifetime of G protein in its active state. ROS were purified from frozen bovine retinas (TA & WL Lawson Co., Lincoln, NE) under infrared illumination as described (15McDowell J.H. Methods Neurosci. 1993; 15: 123-130Crossref Scopus (56) Google Scholar). To obtain membranes lacking most peripheral proteins but retaining an active RGS9·Gβ5L complex, ROS were washed under infrared illumination twice with isotonic buffer containing 100 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol and 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) and three times by a hypotonic buffer containing 0.5 mmEDTA and 5 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5). We will call this preparation “washed membranes” throughout the rest of the text. The amount of residual transducin in “washed membranes” did not exceed 1% of the original endogenous transducin content, as estimated from Coomassie-stained SDS-PAGE gels. Rhodopsin concentration in all membrane preparations was determined spectrophotometrically by measuring the difference in absorbance at 500 nm before and after rhodopsin bleaching (16Bownds D.

Goldin S.B. Ho Y.-K. Methods Neurosci. 1993; 15: 180-195Crossref Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Transducin concentration was first estimated by the Bradford method (18Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (214351) Google Scholar), using bovine serum albumin as the standard, and then the precise concentration of functionally active transducin was measured by the maximal amount of rhodopsin-catalyzed GTPγS binding (19Fung B.B.K. Hurley J.B. Stryer L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 152-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar). Transducin concentration, as determined with GTPγS, was used in all data analyses. Recombinant bovine wild type PDEγ was expressed in Escherichia coliand purified as described in (20Slepak V.Z. Artemyev N.O. Zhu Y. Dumke C.L. Sabacan L. Sondek J. Hamm H.E.

The purity and chemical formula of PDEγ-(63–87) were confirmed by mass spectrometry and reversed-phase high pressure liquid chromatography. PDEγ and PDEγ-(63–87) concentration was determined spectrophotometrically using a molar extinction coefficient ε280 of 7,100.

The recombinant baculovirus was generated using a BaculoGold transfection kit (PharMingen). The resulting recombinant Gαt is N-terminally modified with the His6 tag and therefore lacks N-terminal myristoyl moiety. Sf9 cells from a 2-liter shaking culture were collected 72 h post-infection. His6-Gαt was purified from the cytoplasmic fraction using a combination of affinity chromatography on Ni-NTA-agarose (Qiagen) and anion exchange chromatography on MonoQ (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) essentially as described for Gαt/Gαi1 chimeras (21Skiba N.P.

The concentration of active Gαt able to interact with rhodopsin and Gβγ was determined as the maximal amount of rhodopsin/Gβγ-dependent [35S]GTPγS binding (19Fung B.B.K. Hurley J.B. Stryer L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 152-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar). Transducin GTPase activity was determined by using either a multiple-turnover ([GTP] > [transducin]) or single-turnover ([GTP] < [transducin]) technique as described previously (22Cowan C.W. Wensel T.G. Arshavsky V.Y. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 315: 524-538Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). GTPase assays were conducted at room temperature (22–24 °C) in a buffer containing 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.8), 100 mm NaCl, 8 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm dithiothreitol. Washed membranes, used as the source of both rhodopsin (to activate transducin) and RGS9·Gβ5L, were illuminated on ice immediately before the experiments. The reaction was started by adding 10 μl of [γ-32P]GTP at the desired concentration (approximately 105 dpm/sample) to 20 μl of washed membranes (30 μm rhodopsin) reconstituted with the proteins of choice. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 100 μl of 6% perchloric acid. 32Pi formation was measured with activated charcoal as described (22Cowan C.W. Wensel T.G. Arshavsky V.Y. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 315: 524-538Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). All data fitting and statistical analyses were performed with Sigmaplot software, version 6. Washed membranes containing 10 μg of rhodopsin were solubilized in 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 100 mm NaCl, and 1 mm dithiothreitol containing 1% lauryl sucrose (Calbiochem). Insoluble material was removed by a 10-min centrifugation at 120,000 × g with a Beckman Airfuge, and the supernatant was mixed with 10 μl of Ni-NTA-agarose beads pre-bound to ∼5 μg of his6-Gαt in 50 μl of 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 100 mm NaCl, and 0.2% lauryl sucrose. 10 mm NaF, 30 μmAlCl3, and/or 10 μm PDEγ was added if needed. Samples were incubated on ice for 30 min with occasional shaking. The agarose beads were spun down and washed twice for 5 min with 1 ml of 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 300 mmNaCl, 20 mm imidazole, 0.25% lauryl sucrose, or the same buffer containing 10 mm NaF and 30 μmAlCl3 (for the AlF4-activated samples). Bound RGS9 was eluted from the resin with the SDS-gel sample buffer, subjected to SDS-PAGE (23Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 277: 680-685Crossref Scopus (206602) Google Scholar), and detected by Western blot analysis using specific antibodies and an ECL substrate kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The goal of this study was to evaluate the relation between PDEγ and the native RGS9·Gβ5L complex in regulating transducin GTPase. We took advantage of the fact that native RGS9·Gβ5L is tightly associated with ROS membranes (6Cowan C.W. Fariss R.N. Sokal I. Palczewski K. Wensel T.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5351-5356Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar), which enabled us to deplete ROS membranes of endogenous PDE, transducin, and other extractable proteins while preserving their entire RGS9·Gβ5L content. Previous studies indicate that a significant cooperation between RGS9·Gβ5L and PDEγ is observed in experiments utilizing this type of washed ROS membrane preparation (10Arshavsky V.Y. Dumke C.L. Zhu Y. Artemyev N.O. Skiba N.P. Hamm H.E. Bownds M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19882-19887Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Angleson J.K. Wensel T.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16290-16296Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The unique feature of studying components of the phototransduction cascade is that the G protein transducin can be supplied by a practically unlimited amount of its activated receptor, bleached rhodopsin. This makes it possible to study the effects of RGS9·Gβ5L on transducin GTPase under steady-state conditions in which hydrolysis of Gαt-bound GTP is followed immediately by recycling of transducin to the GTP-bound form (24Nekrasova E.R. Berman D.M. Rustandi R.R. Hamm H.E. Gilman A.G. Arshavsky V.Y. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 7638-7643Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). As illustrated in Reaction 1 below, this steady-state situation could be analyzed by the Michaelis analysis, where RGS9·Gβ5L is considered the enzyme, Gαt-GTP the substrate, and Gαt-GDP and inorganic phosphate the reaction products (the rate of GTPase reaction under these conditions is not dependent on the concentrations of GTP and bleached rhodopsin to the extent that these concentrations are saturating).RGS9·Gβ5L+Gαt­GTP ↔k−1k+1 RGS9·Gβ5L×Gαt­GTP →kcatRGS9·Gβ5L+Gαt­GDP+PiREACTION 1We therefore could assess directly whether PDEγ influencesk cat or apparent K m in this reaction after measuring the rate of the GTPase reaction at a fixed concentration of RGS9·Gβ5L and various transducin concentrations. However, before pursuing this analysis we needed to solve two experimental problems outlined below. First, PDEγ has been documented to inhibit rhodopsin-dependent transducin recycling from the GDP- to the GTP-bound form (25Morrison D.F. Cunnick J.M. Oppert B. Takemoto D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 11671-11681Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26Yamazaki A. Yamazaki M. Tsuboi S. Kishigami A. Umbarger K.O. Hutson L.D. Madland W.T. Hayashi F. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8899-8907Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This is most likely because the sites of transducin interaction with rhodopsin and PDEγ overlap, allowing competition between PDEγ and rhodopsin for binding to transducin (27Artemyev N.O. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 4188-4193Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). As a result, transducin activation is partially blocked (27Artemyev N.O. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 4188-4193Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), making it essentially impossible to know the concentration of Gαt-GTP in the steady-state Michaelis analysis when PDEγ is present. We solved this problem by substituting PDEγ by its C-terminal peptide, PDEγ-(63–87), which has been shown to represent the GAP activity of PDEγ (10Arshavsky V.Y. Dumke C.L. Zhu Y. Artemyev N.O. Skiba N.P. Hamm H.E. Bownds M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19882-19887Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This peptide essentially lacks the ability to bind to the GDP-bound form of transducin because a different site on PDEγ, PDEγ-(24–45), is responsible for this interaction (21Skiba N.P. Bae H. Hamm H.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 413-424Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 27Artemyev N.O. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 4188-4193Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). To confirm that PDEγ-(63–87) potentiates the GAP activity of RGS9·Gβ5L to the same extent as the full-length PDEγ, we conducted a single-turnover GTPase assay in which only one synchronized turnover of transducin GTPase is allowed and transducin recycling does not take place (Fig. 1). Our data indicate that PDEγ and PDEγ-(63–87) cause the same degree of transducin GTPase activation at their saturating concentrations of 1 μm. Second, we needed to distinguish between the basal transducin GTPase activity and the activity stimulated by RGS9·Gβ5L. Because it is not possible to remove RGS9·Gβ5L from the washed membranes under nondenaturing conditions, we blocked RGS9·Gβ5L activity with specific affinity-purified sheep antibodies derived against a fragment of RGS9 between residues 226 and 484 (5He W. Cowan C.W. Wensel T.G. Neuron. 1998; 20: 95-102Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar, 7Makino E.R. Handy J.W. Li T.S. Arshavsky V.Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 1947-1952Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). The data presented in Fig.2 indicate that treatment of washed membranes with these antibodies blocked the ability of RGS9·Gβ5L to activate transducin GTPase both in the presence and absence of PDEγ-(63–87). The effect was dose-dependent with complete inhibition observed at 500 nm antibodies. The specificity of anti-RGS antibodies to inhibit GTPase activation was confirmed in control experiments in which a total fraction of nonimmune sheep IgG did not affect transducin GTPase activity. A typical experiment addressing the dependence of transducin GTPase rate on transducin concentration under the steady-state conditions is shown in Fig. 3 A. The lower data set represents the basal GTPase activity of transducin obtained after blocking the GAP activity of RGS9·Gβ5L with anti-RGS9 antibodies. This basal activity is a linear function of transducin concentration. The other two data sets represent GTPase activity in the presence of active RGS9·Gβ5L measured with or without PDEγ-(63–87). The “accelerated” GTPase activities are re-plotted in Fig. 3 B after a point by point subtraction of the basal activity from these data sets (closed symbols). Open symbols on the same graph show the data from an experiment carried out under identical conditions but with another set of protein/membrane preparations. The striking difference between the data obtained with and without PDEγ-(63–87) is that the data with peptide could be fitted by a hyperbola yielding the average value of apparentK m of ∼3.2 μm transducin, whereas the data without peptide do not approach saturation over the range of transducin concentrations used. Note that the K mvalue in the intact photoreceptor could not be derived from the experiment shown in Fig. 3 because in this experiment most of the substrate (Gαt-GTP-PDEγ-(63–87)) is soluble (not shown), whereas in the intact rod, the substrate (Gαt-GTP-PDE) is membrane-attached because of the isoprenoid modification of the PDE α and β subunits (28Anant J.S. Ong O.C. Xie H. Clarke S. O'Brien P.J. Fung B.K.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 687-690Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To emphasize that the rate of GTP hydrolysis did not saturate without PDEγ-(63–87), we re-plotted the data without peptide from both experiments in Fig. 3 C and compared the best hyperbolic fits of these data (same as in Fig. 3 B) with the fits forced to the K m value of 3.2 observed with the peptide (dotted lines). Whereas the coefficients of determination (R 2) of the best fits were equal to 0.99 and 0.97, the corresponding parameters for the forced fits were only 0.75 and 0.54. Although we were not able to concentrate the components of this reconstituted system sufficiently to obtain a highly reliable determination of both K m andV max values in the absence of PDEγ, the difference in the apparent K m values with and without PDEγ63−87 in these experiments was at least 15-fold. Hyperbolic fits of the data obtained without PDEγ yielded V max values within an ∼25% range of the values observed with PDEγ-(63−87); this result should be treated cautiously, however, because only ∼30% of the calculatedV max was achieved at the highest transducin concentrations used. The finding that PDEγ primarily affects the value of the apparent K m rather than theV max is further illustrated in Fig.3 D where the data from Fig. 3 B are re-plotted in double-reciprocal coordinates. Thus, we conclude that the major effect of PDEγ in potentiating the GAP activity of RGS9·Gβ5L is to increase the affinity between Gαt-GTP and RGS9·Gβ5L. Another important parameter calculated from the data presented in Fig.3 B is the k cat value for RGS9·Gβ5L observed in the presence of PDEγ-(63–87). Based on the 1:1640 ± 620 RGS9·Gβ5L:rhodopsin ratio measured by Heet al. (5He W. Cowan C.W. Wensel T.G. Neuron. 1998; 20: 95-102Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar) in bovine ROS, we calculated that the RGS9·Gβ5L concentration in this experiment was 0.012 ± 0.005 μm, and therefore the average k catvalue was equal to 98 ± 40 s−1, which makes RGS9·Gβ5L the most efficient RGS protein studied so far. The next set of experiments illustrated in Fig.4 provides further proof for our conclusion that PDEγ serves as an “affinity enhancer” between Gαt−GTP and RGS9·Gβ5L. We monitored the binding of RGS9·Gβ5L to the His6-tagged Gαt-GDP immobilized on the Ni-NTA-agarose in the absence or presence of PDEγ. Native RGS9·Gβ5L was solubilized from washed ROS membranes by the mild, non-ionic detergent lauryl sucrose and incubated with the Ni-NTA-agarose beads in the presence of the same detergent. The beads were rinsed, and bound proteins were extracted with the SDS-PAGE sample buffer (see “Experimental Procedures”). The amount of RGS9·Gβ5L in the extract was then detected by immunoblotting with anti-RGS9 antibodies. We chose to use full-length PDEγ in this experiment because its higher affinity for transducin than the PDEγ-(63–87) peptide allowed better protein retention upon agarose washes. The leftmost lane shows the amount of RGS9 loaded on the beads. The next two lanes provide a control showing that RGS9·Gβ5L did not bind to inactive GDP-bound Gαt both with and without PDEγ. As evident from the last two lanes, transducin activation by AlF4−, which mimics the transition state for GTP hydrolysis most favorable for interacting with RGS proteins (29Sondek J. Lambright D.G. Noel J.P. Hamm H.E. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1994; 372: 276-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar, 30Berman D.M. Kozasa T. Gilman A.G. J. Biol.

Cell. 1997; 89: 251-261Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (682) Google Scholar), results in RGS9·Gβ5L binding to transducin, and significant binding was observed only in the presence of PDEγ. The dual requirement for an RGS protein (RGS9·Gβ5L) and an effector (PDEγ) for the timely inactivation of G protein is a unique feature of the vertebrate phototransduction cascade. It is now established that the major catalytic role in activating transducin GTPase belongs to the RGS homology domain of RGS9 and that PDEγ acts as a facilitator of RGS activity (5He W. Cowan C.W. Wensel T.G. Neuron. 1998; 20: 95-102Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar, 14Skiba N.P. Yang C.S. Huang T. Bae H. Hamm H.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8770-8778Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Although PDEγ was historically the first identified protein capable of activating G protein GTPase activity (8Arshavsky V.Y. Bownds M.D. Nature. 1992; 357: 416-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar), its exact role in this process remained unknown. The data reported in this study indicate that PDEγ acts as an enhancer of the affinity between Gαt-GTP and RGS9·Gβ5L. What remains to be elucidated in the future is whether PDEγ acts allosterically by optimizing the conformation of Gαt-GTP switch regions, suggested to bind to the RGS9 homology domain or whether it interacts directly with RGS9·Gβ5L. Our finding that PDEγ enhances the affinity between Gαt-GTP and RGS9·Gβ5L provides a solid mechanistic basis for our hypothesis of why both RGS9·Gβ5L and PDEγ are needed for timely transducin inactivation in photoreceptor cells (4Arshavsky V.Y. Pugh Jr., E.N. Neuron. 1998; 20: 11-14Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar,11Tsang S.H. Burns M.E. Calvert P.D. Gouras P. Baylor D.A. Goff S.P. Arshavsky V.Y. Science. 1998; 282: 117-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). We noted that when a rod photoreceptor is hit by a photon of light, it needs to accomplish two nearly opposite tasks. First, it must transduce the signal from excited rhodopsin to PDE with high efficiency. Second, it has to inactivate the whole cascade within a fraction of a second. If transducin were allowed to be discharged by RGS9·Gβ5L before it formed a complex with PDE, then some transducin molecules would never activate PDE and signal amplification would be diminished. Therefore, the dependence of GTPase activation on transducin association with PDEγ ensures both high efficiency of signal transmission between transducin and PDE and timely photoresponse recovery. It is tempting to speculate that similar mechanisms may be utilized in other G protein-based signal transduction cascades to solve the same general problem of preserving both response sensitivity and time resolution. Another important finding of this study is that the PDEγ-enhanced activity of RGS9·Gβ5L reaches the rate of ∼100 s−1, which is at least one order of magnitude higher than most reported rates for various RGS proteins (cf. Refs. 24Nekrasova E.R. Berman D.M. Rustandi R.R. Hamm H.E. Gilman A.G. Arshavsky V.Y. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 7638-7643Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar and 30Berman D.M. Kozasa T. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27209-27212Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). However, this rate is on the same order of magnitude as the ∼25 s−1 rate constant reported by Mukhopadhyay and Ross (32Mukhopadhyay S. Ross E.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 9539-9544Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar) for the RGS4-stimulated GTP hydrolysis by Gq. It is interesting to consider the RGS9·Gβ5L k cat value of 100 s−1 in the context of photoresponse recovery kinetics. This number sets the upper limit for the rate of PDE inactivation. It appears to be not only sufficient but even excessive when compared with the ∼7 s−1 rate of the recovery from single-photon responses of dark-adapted mammalian rods (33Baylor D.A. Nunn B.J. Schnapf J.L. J. Physiol ( Lond. ). 1984; 357: 575-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar, 34Chen J. Makino C.L. Peachey N.S. Baylor D.A. Simon M.I. Science. 1995; 267: 374-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). Although the slowest rate-limiting step in the photoresponse recovery may not be transducin GTPase (35Pepperberg D.R. Cornwall M.C. Kahlert M. Hofmann K.P. Jin J. Jones G.J. Ripps H. Visual Neurosci. 1992; 8: 9-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar), the rate of 100 s−1 is too high when compared with the quenching rates of any phototransduction step derived from physiological experiments (36Lyubarsky A.L. Pugh Jr., E.N. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 563-571Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This implies that transducin GTPase in rods does not work at its maximal rate, either because each RGS9·Gβ5L has to sequentially stimulate the GTPase activity of several transducin molecules and/or because the concentration of activated transducin remains below saturation for RGS9·Gβ5L during the course of the photoresponse. Remarkably, the GTPase rate of 100 s−1 is in the same range as the photoresponse recovery observed in mammalian cones. For example, the flicker fusion frequency of human cone vision, which reflects the speed of the photoresponse, exceeds 60 s−1 and is ∼5-fold higher than in rod vision (37Ripps H. Weale R.A. Davson H. The Eye. 2A. Academic Press, New York1976: 185-217Google Scholar). In this context, Cowan and colleagues (6Cowan C.W. Fariss R.N. Sokal I. Palczewski K. Wensel T.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5351-5356Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar) reported that bovine cones contain a significantly larger amount of RGS9 than rods and suggested that this difference underlies one of the biochemical mechanisms contributing to faster recovery kinetics of cones. Our finding that RGS9·Gβ5L has the potential to stimulate transducin GTPase at the rate of ∼100 s−1 provides a strong support for their idea. Higher RGS9·Gβ5L concentration in cones should result in a higher rate of transducin GTPase and photoresponse recovery by providing a higher frequency of RGS9·Gβ5L encounters with Gαt-GTP-PDE. We thank Drs. V. I. Govardovskii and P. D. Calvert for critical reading of the manuscript."

Tjian R. Cell. 1983; 35: 79-87Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (911) Google Scholar). Subsequent studies have shown that Sp1 also interacts with GC boxes in the promoters of cellular and other viral genes and activates expression of those genes (2Jones K.A. Tjian R.

Although Sp1 had been regarded as a ubiquitous transcription factor that regulates transcription from TATA-less promoters of housekeeping genes, recent studies have suggested that Sp1 may be also involved in specific gene activation through modulation of its abundance and phosphorylation and glycosylation states in response to a variety of signals (4Kitadai Y.

Likewise, our preliminary studies concerning gene expression responsive to insulin suggested that synthesis and/or degradation of Sp1 protein might be regulated by insulin. Accordingly, we started structural study of human Sp1 mRNA to enquire any account for that apparent insulin effect in its mRNA structure. Despite a large number of reports concerning the function of Sp1, the complete structure of human Sp1 protein has not been established yet. The reported cDNA clones for human Sp1 still lack the N-terminal and the upstream noncoding regions (9Kadonaga J.T. Carner K.R. Masiarz F.R. Tjian R.

Science. 1988; 242: 1566-1570Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar), although a DNA-binding domain having three zinc finger motifs and four transcriptional activation domains, termed domains A, B, C, and D (11Courey A.J. Tjian R. Cell. 1988; 55: 887-898Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1079) Google Scholar), have been identified in the partial Sp1 structure. We report here accumulation of two forms of human Sp1 mRNA in HepG2 cells and the evidence that one form of the products was generated by homotypic trans-splicing. The complete structure of human Sp1 protein was also deduced from the cDNA sequence. Total RNA was extracted from HepG2 cells using ISOGEN (Nippongene, Toyama, Japan) according to instruction of the manufacturer. The single strand cDNA for 5′ RACE1 was prepared byin vitro synthesis of cDNA with avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase XL (Takara Shuzo, Tokyo, Japan) using total RNA (5 μg) and the primer RT (5′-TCTGTTCCTTTG-3′) and digestion of the template RNA with RNase H. When nucleotide positions were numbered relative to the transcription start site that was identified in this study, the primer RT corresponded to the positions from 2197 to 2186. The same nucleotide numbering was adopted throughout this paper. 5′ RACE was carried out using a 5′ Full RACE Core Set (Takara Shuzo). The first PCR was performed using the single strand cDNAs concatenated by T4 RNA ligase and primers S1 (5′-GCTGGCAGATCATCTCTTCC-3′, positions 2144–2163) and A1 (5′-ACCCTGTGAAAGTTGTGTGG-3′, positions 2136–2117) through a 25 cycle-amplification (94 °C for 30 s, 52 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 4 min). Then, a nested PCR was applied to the first PCR products under the same condition using primers S2 (5′-GGATCCTCTGGGGCTACCCCTAC-3′, positions 2164–2183) and A2 (5′-GAATTCTGTGAGGTCAAGCTCACCTG-3′, positions 2116–2096). Each primer contained both the sequence for a proper segment in Sp1 gene and the sequence (underlined) for creation of a restriction site. Each product of the nested PCR was cloned into pUC vector for DNA sequencing. For detection of the Sp1 mRNA with the exon 3-2-3 alignment by RT-PCR, a 25-cycle amplification (94 °C for 30 s, 52 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 50 s) was applied to the single strand cDNA that was used for 5′ RACE and appropriate pairs of the following primers; primer T1 (5′-CAAACAATCACCTTAGCCCC-3′, positions 3265–3284), primer T2 (5′-AATGCAGGGTGTTTCCTTGG-3′, positions 3285–3304), primer T3 (5′-CAAGATCACTCCATGGATGA-3′, positions 1541–1560), primer T4 (5′-ATGAAATGACAGCTGTGGTG-3′, positions 1557–1576), primer T5 (5′-CTGTGAGGTCAAGCTCACCT-3′, positions 2116–2097), and primer T6 (5′-ATGATCTGCCAGCCATTGGC-3′, positions 2156–2137). For detection of the Sp1 mRNA with the exon 2-3-2 alignment by RT-PCR, a single strand cDNA was prepared by reverse transcription from poly(A)+ RNA (1 μg) of HepG2 cells using the primer R8 (5′-TGCCCGCAGGTGAGAGGTCTTG-3′); this primer was synthesized referring to the cDNA sequence in the downstream of exon 3. The first PCR was carried out using the primer X2 (5′-GTTCGCTTGCCTCGTCAGCG-3′, positions 81–100), primer T3 and primer 2R-1 (5′-AAGGCACCACCACCATTACC-3′, positions 1635–1616). The nested PCR was accomplished through a 25-cycle amplification (94 °C for 30 s and 72 °C for 2 min) using the following primers; primer R14 (5′-TTCATCCATGGAGTGATCTTGGTCTGG-3′, positions 1561–1539 and positions 3502–3499), primer R15 (5′-TTGAGCTTGTCCCTCAGCTGCCAC-3′, positions 147–170), primer R16 (5′-TCCATGGATGAAATGACAGCTGTGGTG-3′, positions 1550–1576), and primer R17 (5′-CTGGCAGCAACTTGCAGCAGAATTG-3′, positions 2017–2041). Human genomic DNA was prepared from HepG2 cells according to a standard protocol (12Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 9.14-9.23Google Scholar), and completely digested with XbaI. Then a size-fractionated pool of the DNA fragments was ligated with the phage vector λDASH II (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) to construct a human genomic library. This library was screened by a plaque hybridization technique using the 120-bp DNA fragment of human Sp1 cDNA (positions 56–175) as a probe. The primer PE1 (5′-ATGGTGGCAGCTGAGGGACAAG-3′, positions 173–152) was end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP using T4 polynucleotide kinase (Nippongene). The 32P-labeled primer (1.2 × 104 cpm) was incubated with 16 μg of poly(A)+ RNA from HepG2 cells at 30 °C for 16 h. The primer-RNA hybrid was precipitated with ethanol and subjected to reverse transcription with avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase XL at 42 °C for 60 min. The extended product was analyzed on a 6% polyacrylamide gel containing 8 m urea. To construct template plasmids forin vitro synthesis of riboprobes, DNA fragments were amplified by PCR with two sets of primers. The primers XA1 (5′-AATAAGCTTGTTCGCTTGCCTCGTCAGCG-3′, positions 81–100) and XA2 (5′-TTATCTAGAAAGGCACCACCACCATTACC-3′, positions 1636–1616) were used with the template of the 0.41-kb 5′ RACE product, and primers BA1 (5′-AATAAGCTTTCACACCCATTGCCTCAG-3′, 3332–3349) and BA2 (5′-TAATCTAGAATTGCCCCCATTATTGCC-3′, 1615–1598) were used with the 1.6-kb 5′ RACE product. These primers contained additional sequences (underlined) for creation ofXbaI or HindIII site at each end. Each amplified DNA fragment was inserted between XbaI andHindIII sites of pBluescript KS. The resulting plasmids were linearized by digestion with HindIII, and antisense riboprobes were synthesized from these T7 promoter-containing plasmids in the presence of [α-32P]CTP using a T7 RNA Synthesis Kit (Nippongene). The riboprobe for detection of the β-actin mRNA was also synthesized using a β-actin human antisense control template (Nippongene). RNase protection assays were performed with an RPA II kit (Ambion, Inc., Austin, TX) according to the manufacturer's instructions. In brief, riboprobes (each 5 × 105 cpm) were incubated at 42 °C for 16 h with RNA samples as indicated in the figure legends. Then they were digested for 30 min at 37 °C with 200 μl of a mixture of RNase A (2.5 unit/ml) and RNase T1 (100 unit/ml). The protected products were analyzed on a 6% polyacrylamide gel containing 8 m urea. Genomic DNA (2 μg) from HepG2 cells was digested completely with a restriction enzyme (BamHI, EcoRI, PstI, orXbaI), electrophoresed on a 0.7% agarose gel, and transferred onto a Hybond-N membrane (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The DNA on the membrane was allowed to hybridize with the32P-labeled DNA fragment (positions 3225–3502) that corresponded to exon 3 of the human Sp1 gene and washed under stringent conditions (0.2 × SSPE plus 0.1% SDS, 15 min at 65 °C, two times). To obtain a human Sp1 cDNA clone containing the 5′-terminal region, we employed a 5′ RACE method using total RNA from HepG2 cells. The primers were designed to anneal specifically to the sequence in a 5′-terminal region of human Sp1 on the basis of the data registered in GenBankTM (accession number J03133). As shown in Fig. 1 A, three kinds of DNA fragments with respective sizes of 0.34, 0.41, and 1.6 kb were mainly amplified. The sequence analysis revealed that all the products indeed possessed in common a known sequence in Sp1 gene; however, these products were classified into two types based on the sequence upstream of this sequence. The products of 0.41 and 0.34 kb had a new and identical sequence in the immediate upstream of the known sequence, although the 0.41-kb product contained the further upstream sequence of 71 bp long (Fig. 1 B). By contrast, the 1.6-kb product had an unexpected structure, in which another established sequence in the downstream region of Sp1 gene was also linked upstream of the common sequence (Fig. 1 B). Because we obtained different cDNA clones for the 5′-terminal region of Sp1 mRNA, we analyzed the Sp1 gene in the human genome to elucidate the mechanism of the generation of these differences. In genomic Southern analysis with XbaI digestion, a single band of 14 kb was detected using the probe obtained from the 0.41-kb product (data not shown); thus we constructed a genomic library from theXbaI digest to obtain the genomic clone containing the 5′ region of human Sp1 gene. The screening of this library with the same probe yielded a single positive clone, which was named λSp1Ε1 (Fig.1 C). Characterization and sequence analysis revealed that this genomic clone contained both the common Sp1 sequence and the new sequence that was found in the present 5′ RACE products (accession number AB039286). This result indicated that the 0.41- and 0.34-kb products contained an upstream exon of human Sp1 gene. To confirm whether the 5′-terminal end of the 0.41-kb product represented the 5′ terminus of Sp1 mRNA, we next performed primer extension analysis with poly(A)+ RNA isolated from HepG2 cells. This experiment showed only a single band representing the product extended 56-bp from the 5′ end of the 0.41-kb product (Fig.2 B). There is no consensus sequence for the splice acceptor site in the genomic sequence preceding the one corresponding to the 5′ end region of 0.41-kb product. We assume, therefore, the position 56 bp upstream from the 5′ end of the 0.41-kb product as the transcription start site of human Sp1 gene (Fig.2 A). The genomic structure up to 266 bp upstream of this putative transcription start site did not contain any TATA box-like sequence but four possible GC boxes at positions starting from −231, −182, −139, and −9, respectively, thus suggesting the possible auto-regulation in Sp1 function (Fig. 2 A). Although the 0.41- and 0.34-kb products did not contain the expected 5′ terminus of Sp1 mRNA, the newly determined sequence in these products had a stop codon in the frame for Sp1 protein (Fig. 2 A). Therefore, the first methionine codon in this open reading frame appeared to be the initiation codon and the complete amino acid sequence of human Sp1 protein was thus deduced from the DNA sequences of the 0.34- and 0.41-kb products. The deduced amino acid sequence of human Sp1 is composed of 785 amino acid residues, and the calculated molecular mass is 80,691 Da. The resulting amino acid sequence of the N-terminal region showed a high homology with those of mouse and rat Sp1 proteins (Fig. 3).Figure 3Comparison of amino acid sequence of Sp1. The amino acid sequence of the N-terminal region of human Sp1 protein that is deduced from the DNA sequences of the 0.41- and 0.34-kb products is compared with those of mouse and rat Sp1 proteins.Asterisks indicate the identical amino acid residues to those of human Sp1. Gaps are inserted for the maximum homology. The boxed amino acid residue is the first one encoded by the DNA sequence previously deposited in GenBankTM (accession number J03133).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Comparison of sequences of the genomic and cDNA clones revealed exon-intron boundaries in the 5′-terminal region of Sp1 gene (Fig. 1,B and C). The λSp1E1 clone contained first three exons of the Sp1 gene; the sizes of these exons were 178, 155, or 1513 bp, respectively. It was also shown that the 1.6-kb product had a 3′-terminal portion of exon 3 in the immediate upstream of exon 2; it had the exon 3-2-3 alignment (Fig. 1 B). The upstream exon 3 encoded exactly the same amino acid sequence coded by the downstream exon 3 in the same frame, except the codon at the junction between exons 3 and 2 (GAC), whereas the codon between exons 3 and 4 was GGT, which encoded Asp and Gly, respectively. To confirm whether the Sp1 mRNA represented by the 1.6-kb product is naturally produced or not, RT-PCR analysis was performed with total RNA from HepG2 cells and several sets of the primers (Fig.4 A). When the mRNA corresponding to the 1.6-kb product is indeed present in HepG2 cells, the 500-bp product is expected to be amplified in the RT-PCR with primers T1 and T6 followed by the nested PCR with primers T2 and T5. As the positive control, a nested PCR was also performed using primers T3 and T6 followed by primers T4 and T5 to amplify the 264-bp fragment. These expected segments were all amplified in these PCRs (Fig.4 B, lanes 1 and 2), whereas no amplifications were observed in the negative control PCR with primers T6 and T5 (lane 3). We also confirmed that these amplified products had the expected sequences. To provide further the direct evidence for the occurrence of two forms for the Sp1 mRNA and to estimate their accumulation levels, we next carried out RNase protection assays with two antisense riboprobes (Fig.5 A). The riboprobe 1 that was synthesized using the 1.6-kb product as the template has the sequence complementary to the exon 3-2 boundary region covering 171 nt in exon 3 and 77 nt in exon 2. Thus, three sizes of protected fragments were expected when riboprobe 1 was used; hybridization of this probe to the mRNA corresponding to the 1.6-kb product should produce a 248-nt fragment from the exon 3-2 junction-spanning regions and a 171-nt fragment from the 3′-terminal region of exon 3 immediately preceding exon 4, and hybridization to the other mRNA gives rise to a 77-nt fragment from the 5′-terminal regions of exon 2 following exon 1. Such bands were clearly observed with total RNA from HepG2 cells in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 5 B, lanes 2–4), whereas no band was observed with the yeast RNA that served as a negative control (lane 5). The result with the riboprobe 2 also confirmed the presence of the two Sp1 mRNAs. The riboprobe 2 had the complementary sequence to the exon 1-2 boundary region comprising 98 nt in exon 1 and 97 nt in exon 2 and gave rise to two bands whose signal intensities were also dependent on the amount of total RNA used (lanes 7–9). The fragment with 195 nt corresponded to the full-protected product from the normal form of the transcript, whereas the fragment with 97 nt corresponded to the expected part of exon 2 in the mRNA related to the 1.6-kb product. Together, these results directly demonstrate the presence of two forms of Sp1 mRNAs with different 5′-terminal structures in HepG2 cells. Furthermore, the signal intensity of each protected fragment also suggested a significant level of accumulation of either form of Sp1 mRNA in HepG2 cells.Figure 5RNase protection assay for the transcripts of Sp1. A, the riboprobes for RNase protection assays. The target sequences of riboprobes are shown beneath the structure of 5′ RACE products. Both riboprobes that were synthesized in vitro from pBluescript derivatives contained a 40-bp vector sequence as well. B, the riboprobes were incubated with 10 μg (lanes 2 and 7), 50 μg (lanes 3and 8), or 100 μg (lanes 4 and 9) of total RNA from HepG2 cells or 100 μg (lanes 5 and10) of yeast RNA. The undigested probes were also loaded (lanes 1 and 6). The positions of the products are indicated by arrowheads, and the sizes of the products are also shown. The nonspecific bands were marked byasterisks, and a thin arrow shows an unidentified fragment.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Because genomic rearrangement can cause exon duplication in mRNA (13Pink J.J. Wu S.-Q. Wolf D.M. Bilimoria M.M. Jordan V.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 962-969Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), we examined whether or not exon 3 of Sp1 gene is duplicated in the genome of HepG2 cells. Genomic Southern blot analysis was performed with genomic DNA digests with various restriction enzymes using a DNA fragment from exon 3 as a probe. As shown in Fig. 6, a single band was detected in each lane (lanes 4–7). In addition, the signal intensities of these bands were almost the same as that of the control band for a single copy (lane 3). This estimation was further validated by a parallel Southern analysis for an established single copy gene, p53 gene, applied to the same DNA digests (data not shown). These results suggested that exon 3 exists as a single copy in the genome. Thus, not the genomic duplication but an RNA editing mechanism,i.e. formation of circular RNA or trans-splicing, appeared to give rise to the Sp1 mRNA with the exon 3-2-3 alignment. Because circular RNAs lack poly(A) tails per se, we next performed RNase protection assay with poly(A)+-rich RNA and poly(A)−-rich RNA (Fig.7). The distribution of the Sp1 mRNA with the exon 3-2-3 alignment to these two fractions was similar to that of the cis-spliced Sp1 mRNA. In addition, the β-actin mRNA that was used as a marker of fractionation, was distributed similarly. Therefore, we concluded that the Sp1 mRNA with the exon 3-2-3 alignment was produced by trans-splicing between two Sp1 pre-mRNAs.Figure 7RNase protection assay with fractions rich in poly(A)+ RNA or poly(A)− RNA. The riboprobe 1 was incubated with either 100 μg of total RNA (lane 2), poly(A)+ RNA (lane 3), or poly(A)− RNA (lane 4) that were prepared from 100 μg of total RNA or 100 μg of yeast RNA (lane 5). The undigested riboprobe was also loaded (lane 1). The result for the same samples using a β-actin probe was also shown below. Three protected fragments were indicated byarrowheads.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) We also investigated the structure upstream of the 3-2-3 alignment of the trans-spliced Sp1 mRNA by RT-PCR. To examine whether exons 1 and 2 are located in the upstream of the 3-2-3 alignment, first PCRs were carried out with primers X2 and 2R-1 or primers T3 and 2R-1 (Fig. 8 A). Then the nested PCRs were done using the primers R15, R16 or R17, and R14, which were designed to anneal specifically to exon 1, exon 2, or exon 3, and the exon 3-2 junction sequence, respectively (Fig. 8 A). When the first PCR product with T3 and 2R-1 primers was used as a template, the amplified products were observed by the nested PCRs (Fig.8 B, lanes 2). DNA sequencing of these products established their expected structure. In contrast, no product was observed by the nested PCR when the first PCR product with X2 and 2R-1 primers was used as a template (lanes 1). The specificity of the primers used were verified in the negative control PCRs using anEcoRI-XbaI fragment (Fig. 1 C) of a genomic DNA clone (lanes G) or the cDNA clone containing the exon 1-2-3-4 alignment (lanes C) as a template, and the positive control PCR using the recombinant clone having the exon 1-2-3-2-3 alignment as a template (lanes R). Taken together, the trans-spliced mRNA appeared to have exon 2 but not exon 1 in its 5′ region. Here, we cloned human Sp1 cDNAs that represent two forms of mRNAs with different structures in the 5′-terminal region. The results of RT-PCR and RNase protection assay confirmed that two Sp1 mRNAs are really present and accumulated in HepG2 cells. One of them is generated through a well studied cis-splicing process, and the other with the exon 2-3-2-3 alignment is bytrans-splicing. Consistently, we detected heterogeneous RNA species in Northern analysis of RNA from HepG2 cells using a Sp1 cDNA fragment (positions 2765–3295) as a probe; the main band was approximately 8.2 kb, whereas the other two were minor but still marked representing smaller mRNAs (data not shown). The main band probably corresponds to the main bands previously reported (4Kitadai Y. Yasui W. Yokozaki H. Kuniyasu H. Haruma K. Kajiyama G. Tahara E. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1992; 189: 1342-1348Google Scholar, 9Kadonaga J.T. Carner K.R. Masiarz F.R. Tjian R. Cell. 1987; 51: 1079-1090Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1252) Google Scholar, 14Hagen G. Müller S. Beato M. Suske G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 5519-5525Crossref PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar) for the human Sp1. Other distinct bands we observed correspond to smaller RNAs whose occurrences may depend on cell lines and/or tissues, because the smaller species also seem to be detected in MKN-28 (4Kitadai Y. Yasui W. Yokozaki H. Kuniyasu H. Haruma K. Kajiyama G. Tahara E. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1992; 189: 1342-1348Google Scholar) but not in HeLa cells (9Kadonaga J.T. Carner K.R. Masiarz F.R. Tjian R. Cell. 1987; 51: 1079-1090Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1252) Google Scholar). Although we determined the structure of the 5′-terminal region of human Sp1 mRNA in this study, the sequence for the 3′ noncoding region remains undetermined. We currently suspend, therefore, the identification of those multiple bands in the Northern analysis until accomplishment of the whole structure for Sp1 mRNA. trans-Splicing is an RNA editing mechanism that produces mature mRNA from separate pre-mRNAs. In trypanosoma, nematodes and some other lower organisms, spliced leader RNA, which is similar to spliceosomal U small nuclear RNAs, was ligated at the 5′ ends of diverse nuclear mRNAs (15Murphy W.J. Watkins K.P. Agabian N. Cell. 1986; 47: 517-525Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar, 16Sutton R.E. Boothroyd J.C.

Another type oftrans-splicing has been discovered in plant mitochondria and chloroplasts. In this trans-splicing, formation of group II intron-like structures by base pairing between complementary segments of introns in separate pre-mRNAs seems to be essential (17Bonen L. FASEB J. 1993; 7: 40-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 18Chapdelaine Y. Bonen L. Cell. 1991; 65: 465-472Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 19Wissinger B. Schuster W. Brennicke A. Cell. 1991; 65: 473-482Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). In mammalian cells, trans-splicing was first demonstratedin vivo and in vitro using artificial RNA substrates (20Konarska M.M. Padgett R.A. Sharp P.A. Cell. 1985; 42: 165-171Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 21Solnick D. Cell. 1985; 42: 157-164Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar), and spliced leader RNA and actin-1 pre-mRNA from Caenorhabditis elegans (22Bruzik J.P. Maniatis T. Nature. 1992; 360: 692-695Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Subsequently, a few examples of trans-splicing as a natural event have also been found in mammalian cells (23Li B.-L. Li X.-L. Duan Z.-J. Lee O. Lin S. Ma Z.-M. Chang C.C.Y. Yang X.-Y. Park J.P. Mohandas T.K. Noll W. Chan L. Chang T.-Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11060-11071Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 24Shimizu A. Honjo T.

These trans-splicings occur between different pre-mRNAs. On the other hand, very recent studies unveiled trans-splicing between identical pre-mRNAs, namely homotypic trans-splicing, in mammalian cells in the expressions of the rat carnitine octanoyltransferase gene (26Caudevilla C. Serra D. Miliar A. Codony C. Asins G. Bach M. Hegardt F.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 12185-12190Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar), the rat SA gene (27Frantz S.A. Thiara A.S. Lodwick D. Ng L.L. Eperon I.C. Samani N.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 5400-5405Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), and the rat voltage-gated sodium channel gene (28Akopian A.N. Okuse K. Souslova V. England S. Ogata N. Wood J.N. FEBS Lett. 1999; 445: 177-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Our present finding with the human Sp1 gene adds another distinct example to the homotypic trans-splicing in mammalian cells, suggesting this type of trans-splicing might be rather a general mechanism for regulation of phenotype expression in mammalian cells. Based on our findings in this study, we propose the model of the homotypic trans-splicing (Fig.9). In this model, we present thetrans-spliced Sp1 mRNA that lacks exon 1. The reason that we did not detect the trans-spliced Sp1 mRNA having exon 1 is obscure. However, the presence of alternative transcription start sites in intron 1 can be a candidate account, because we observed multiple products in the primer extension analysis with the exon 2-specific primer (data not shown). It has been proposed thattrans-splicing process in mammals proceeds in spliceosome complexes and through partial base pairing between two precursor mRNAs (29Eul J. Graessmann M. Graessmann A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3226-3235Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). By the survey of complementarity between a segment in the upstream of exon 2 and one in the downstream of exon 3, we found two sets of complementary sequences (Fig. 9). We also found an exonic splicing enhancer (ESE)-like sequence (GAGGAGGAGGG, positions 1680–1690) in exon 2 of the Sp1 gene (Fig. 9). The ESEs, which are known to be involved in a weak splice site selection in alternative splicing with cooperation of serine/arginine-rich splicing factors (SR proteins), are usually purine-rich sequences in the exons downstream of a regulated 3′ splice site (30Dirksen W.P. Hampson R.K. Sun Q. Rottman F.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6431-6436Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 31Sun Q. Mayeda A. Hampson R.K. Krainer A.R. Rottman F.M. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 2598-2608Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar, 32Xu R. Teng J. Cooper T.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 3660-3674Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Recently, it has been also demonstrated that ESE and SR proteins are important fortrans-splicing by an in vitro assay system (33Bruzik J.P. Maniatis T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7056-7059Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar,34Chiara M.D. Reed R. Nature. 1995; 375: 510-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Furthermore, two putative ESE elements were also reported in the carnitine octanoyltransferase gene (26Caudevilla C. Serra D. Miliar A. Codony C. Asins G. Bach M. Hegardt F.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 12185-12190Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Thus, the above-mentioned complementary sequences and the ESE-like sequence are possibly involved in the case of Sp1 mRNA maturation as well. The biological significance of trans-splicing for Sp1 remains elusive. Because exon 3 in Sp1 mRNA mainly encodes the transcriptional activation domains A and B (11Courey A.J. Tjian R. Cell. 1988; 55: 887-898Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1079) Google Scholar), the product of the Sp1 mRNA with duplicated exon 3, if translated, has doubled transcriptional activation domains. Although we suggested that thetrans-spliced form of human Sp1 mRNA lacked the first exon, this possibility still remains because of the presence of the second methionine in exon 2 (Fig. 3), which might serve as a translational start site. Such a product may show stronger ability for transactivation, because synergistic activation among activation domains, named superactivation, was demonstrated; an added transactivation domain elevated the ability of a truncated Sp1 having domains for DNA binding and transactivation (35Pascal E. Tjian R. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 1646-1656Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar, 36Courey A.J. Holtzman D.A. Jackson S.P. Tjian R. Cell. 1989; 59: 827-836Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar). In this case, thetrans-splicing will result in a positive regulation. In other cases, this trans-splicing might contribute to a negative regulation by producing nonfunctional mRNA and reduces the functional Sp1 mRNA. Although the result of RNase protection assays suggests that the Sp1 mRNA with the exon 2-3-2-3 alignment has a poly(A) tail, this possibility also remains. It is already proposed that trans-splicing is a novel mechanism for regulating the cellular events because the trans-spliced rat SA mRNA is tissue-specific, and trans-splicing of pre-mRNA of rat voltage-gated sodium channel is regulated by a nerve growth factor (27Frantz S.A. Thiara A.S. Lodwick D. Ng L.L. Eperon I.C. Samani N.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 5400-5405Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar,28Akopian A.N. Okuse K. Souslova V. England S. Ogata N. Wood J.N. FEBS Lett. 1999; 445: 177-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Finally, our study also established the complete amino acid sequence of human Sp1. A partial DNA sequence of 313 bp that covers only the N-terminal coding region of Sp1 recently appeared in the data base (accession number AJ272134), and this sequence perfectly matched to our sequence. Although the newly identified amino acid sequence is not so large, this information is valuable because a region close to the N terminus of human Sp1 is critical for susceptibility to proteasome-dependent degradation (37Su K.

In addition, the three different sizes of mRNAs of mouse Sp1 were observed during spermatogenesis, one of which encoded a Sp1 lacking the 7 amino acid residues of N terminus (38Persengiev S.P.

An APEG-1 5′-end cDNA probe identified three additional isoforms. The 9-kb striated preferentially expressed gene (SPEG)α and the 11-kb SPEGβ were found in skeletal muscle and heart. The 4-kb brain preferentially expressed gene was detected in the brain and aorta. We report here cloning of the 11-kb SPEGβ cDNA. SPEGβ encodes a 355-kDa protein that contains two serine/threonine kinase domains and is homologous to proteins of the myosin light chain kinase family. At least one kinase domain is active and capable of autophosphorylation. In the genome, all four isoforms share the middle three of the five exons of APEG-1, and they differ from each other by using different 5′- and 3′-ends and alternative splicing. We show that the expression of SPEGα and SPEGβ is developmentally regulated in the striated muscle during C2C12 myoblast to myotube differentiationin vitro and cardiomyocyte maturation in vivo. This developmental regulation suggests that both SPEGα and SPEGβ can serve as sensitive markers for striated muscle differentiation and that they may be important for adult striated muscle function.

Their excessive growth and extracellular matrix secretion, however, significantly contribute to various occlusive vascular diseases such as arteriosclerosis and restenosis after balloon angioplasty (1Owens G.K.

Although the molecular mechanisms regulating these VSMC phenotypic modulations have not been fully elucidated, one theory holds that VSMCs are not terminally differentiated and that their phenotype can change from a quiescent and contractile state to a proliferative and synthetic state in vascular pathogenesis (1Owens G.K.

Biol. 1999; 19: 1589-1594Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast to the plastic phenotype of VSMCs, the striated skeletal muscle cells and cardiomyocytes undergo terminal differentiation during perinatal and neonatal stages (4Molkentin J.D. Olson E.N.

In skeletal muscle, the terminal differentiation of myoblasts into myotubes is marked by the permanent withdrawal from the cell cycle and the induction of muscle-specific structural genes by myogenic transcriptional factors (e.g.MyoD, myogenin, Myf5, and MRF4) (4Molkentin J.D.

In the heart, the maturation of cardiomyocytes from hyperplasia to hypertrophy takes place soon after birth, and they also permanently withdraw from the cell cycle (6Claycomb W. Trends Cardiovasc.

Multiple myofibrillar protein genes are regulated during maturation and terminal differentiation of striated muscles. Much of this regulation involves switches of various myofibrillar proteins from the fetal/neonatal isoforms to the adult isoforms. Isoforms of these myofibrillar proteins may derive from multigene families or from alternative splicing and/or use of different promoters in the same gene (for review, see Ref. 10Schiaffino S. Reggiani C. Physiol. Rev. 1996; 76: 371-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (1255) Google Scholar). For instance, the cardiac troponin T (cTnT) is expressed in the human heart as four isoforms (cTnT1through cTnT4) generated by alternative splicing of two 5′ exons. The cTnT3 is the dominant adult isoform in the heart, whereas the other three isoforms are expressed in the fetal heart (11Anderson P.A. Greig A. Mark T.M. Malouf N.N. Oakeley A.E. Ungerleider R.M. Allen P.D. Kay B.K. Circ. Res. 1995; 76: 681-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). It is interesting that the fetal cTnT4 isoform is also re-expressed in failing adult hearts (11Anderson P.A. Greig A. Mark T.M. Malouf N.N. Oakeley A.E. Ungerleider R.M. Allen P.D. Kay B.K. Circ. Res. 1995; 76: 681-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Aortic preferentially expressed gene (APEG)-1 was originally cloned by differential mRNA display as a 1.4-kb mRNA preferentially expressed in adult VSMCs (12Hsieh C.-M. Yoshizumi M. Endege W.O. Kho C.J. Jain M.K. Kashiki S. de los Santos R. Lee W.-S. Perrella M.A. Lee M.-E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17354-17359Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). It is a single copy gene, and analysis of its promoter demonstrates that a 2.7-kb mouse APEG-15′-flanking sequence confers VSMC-specific reporter gene expression (13Hsieh C.-M. Yet S.-F.

The expression of APEG-1 mRNA rapidly disappears in primary culture of VSMCs at early passages (12Hsieh C.-M. Yoshizumi M. Endege W.O. Kho C.J. Jain M.K. Kashiki S. de los Santos R. Lee W.-S.

In the rat carotid artery balloon injury model APEG-1 mRNA is significantly decreased 2 and 4 days after injury but recovers slightly after 8 days (12Hsieh C.-M. Yoshizumi M. Endege W.O. Kho C.J.

On the basis of these observations we propose that APEG-1 serves as a sensitive marker specific for VSMC differentiation. We report here the identification of three additional APEG-1 isoforms expressed in the striated muscles and in the brain. These isoforms, termed striated muscle (S)PEGα, SPEGβ, and brain (B)PEG, were identified by using the 5′-end portion of APEG-1 cDNA in tissue Northern blot analysis and were derived from the same gene locus asAPEG-1. The largest 11-kb SPEGβ isoform was cloned and characterized. The SPEG proteins contained a functional serine/threonine kinase domain. In the heart, the SPEGα and SPEGβ were expressed only after birth, as the APEG-1 was down-regulated. This isoform switch from APEG-1 to SPEGα and SPEGβ correlated with the timing of neonatal heart maturation. The developmental regulation of both SPEGα and SPEGβ suggested that they can serve as sensitive differentiation markers for the striated muscles and that they may be important for adult striated muscle function. C2C12 myoblasts were obtained from the American Type Cell Culture Collection, and 293T cells were obtained from Dr. Hamid Band (Dana Farber Cancer Institute, Boston) (14Ota S. Hazeki K. Rao N. Lupher Jr., M.L. Andoniou C.E. Druker B. Band H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 414-422Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). C2C12 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 20% fetal calf serum (HyClone), 4 mml-glutamine, penicillin (100 units/ml), and streptomycin (100 μg/ml) in a humidified incubator (37 °C, 5% CO2). 293T cells were grown similarly except that they received 10% fetal calf serum and were maintained in a 10% CO2 incubator. C2C12 cells were differentiated into myotubes in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 2% horse serum (HyClone). A mouse APEG-1 cDNA 5′-end probe that contained the open reading frame was used to screen an adult mouse heart 5′-stretch plus cDNA λgt11 library (CLONTECH). Positive clones were purified, and cDNA inserts were excised by EcoRI digestion and ligated into plasmid vectors. Subsequent screening of the same cDNA library was carried out with the newly obtained cDNA fragments that extended at either the 5′- or the 3′-end. Both 5′- and 3′-RACE was performed according to the protocols from the manufacturer (Life Technologies, Inc.). The primers used in 5′-RACE experiment are as follows: 5′-GCTGAAGGCCCTGTCATCCC-3′, 5′-CTGGGTCCCCGGCACATCGC-3′, and 5′-TGATGTCATCCTCGGCAGTC-3′. The primers used in 3′-RACE were 5′-GGGTCGCTTTGATGCCTTCCAG-3′ and 5′-CGCCGCCAGACACTCACCTTCA-3′. A 129/SvJ mouse genomic library in λFIX II vector (Stratagene) was screened by a mouse SPEGβ cDNA 5′ probe. The genomic DNA was sequenced by the dideoxy chain termination method with primers designed from the mouse SPEGβ cDNA sequence to determine the exon-intron junctions. The intron sizes were determined by polymerase chain reactions (PCR) with primers in the flanking exons and by direct sequencing. Total RNA from cultured cells was prepared by the RNeasy Mini Kits (Qiagen). Tissue RNA was extracted from adult male Harlan Sprague-Dawley rats or from adult male Balb/c mice (Taconic Farms) as described (12Hsieh C.-M. Yoshizumi M. Endege W.O. Kho C.J. Jain M.K.

Rat hearts at different developmental stages were obtained from fetuses (17–19 days post-coitum) and from rats 2, 14, and 28 days after birth. Ten μg of RNA was fractionated on 1.3% formaldehyde-agarose gels and transferred to nitrocellulose filters. The filters were then hybridized with [32P]dCTP-labeled, random-primed APEG-1 or SPEG cDNA probes as described in the figure legends. The RNA blot hybridization was performed as described previously (12Hsieh C.-M. Yoshizumi M. Endege W.O. Kho C.J. Jain M.K. Kashiki S. de los Santos R. Lee W.-S. Perrella M.A. Lee M.-E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17354-17359Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). To correct for differences in RNA loading, the same blots were also hybridized with an 18 S rRNA oligonucleotide probe. A portion of SPEG cDNA containing the internal kinase domain (amino acid residues 1598–1862) was amplified by reverse transcription-PCR using the following two primers, SPEGF4935 5′-ggatccCGAGGAAGAAGACTTAGCGAC-3′ (the ggatcc was an added BamHI site not present in the cDNA sequence) and SPEGR5729 5′-TTCTGTTTTGAACCAAGGATG-3′. This cDNA fragment was fused by ligation to an amino-terminal FLAG sequence in the plasmid vector pCMV-FLAG-2 (Sigma) to make the SPEG minikinase construct. 293T cells were transfected with plasmid DNA of the FLAG-tagged SPEG minikinase, the FLAG-tagged Akt, or the empty pFLAG-CMV-2 vector (Sigma) by LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturers' protocol. Twenty four h after transfection cells were harvested in the lysis buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100). The soluble cell lysates were used in kinase assays as described previously (15Sanjo H. Kawai T. Akira S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29066-29071Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). In brief, protein concentration was determined by the Bradford dye-binding procedure (Bio-Rad). One mg of protein was immunoprecipitated by 10 μg of M2 monoclonal antibody to FLAG conjugated to agarose beads (Sigma) at 4 °C overnight. The beads were washed three times in the lysis buffer and once in the kinase reaction buffer (10 mmMgCl2, 3 mm MnCl2, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2). The in vitro kinase reaction was done in the presence of 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) at 30 °C for 10 min and then terminated by the addition of Laemmli sample buffer and boiled for 3 min. The samples were separated on a 10% Tricine/SDS-polyacrylamide gel and visualized by autoradiography. Fifty μg of cell lysates was separated in 10% Tricine or 4–20% Tris glycine-SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes. The membranes were blocked by 5% nonfat milk in TBST (12.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 75 mm NaCl, and 0.1% Tween 20) and incubated with appropriate primary antibodies (1:2000), monoclonal antibody to FLAG (M2) (Sigma), to myosin heavy chain (MY-32) (Sigma), to α-tubulin (DM 1A) (Sigma), and affinity-purified polyclonal antibody to APEG-1/SPEG. After three washes in TBST, the blots were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (1:4000), and chemiluminescent results were obtained by exposure to x-ray films. Adult mouse hearts were fixed in methyl Carnoy's fixative (60% methanol, 30% chloroform, 10% acetic acid) for 3 h and embedded in paraffin. Heart sections were processed for immunostaining essentially as described (16Chin M.T. Pellacani A. Hsieh C.-M. Lin S.S.J. Jain M.K. Patel A. Huggins G.S. Reeves R. Perrella M.A. Lee M.-E. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 1999; 31: 2199-2205Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). In brief, sections were incubated with an affinity-purified antibody to APEG-1/SPEG that was generated in rabbit against a FLAG peptide-tagged APEG-1 fusion protein. For negative control staining, the same antibody was preabsorbed with the FLAG-APEG-1 fusion protein (1:1 by weight) at 4 °C overnight before incubation. After washing, a biotinylated goat antibody to rabbit IgG (Vector Laboratories) and an avidin-horseradish peroxidase were sequentially applied to the sections. Staining results were developed by a peroxidase DAB kit (Vector Laboratories). Differentiated C2C12 cells (for 5 days) grown on glass coverslips and mouse heart sections (see above) were used for staining as described (12Hsieh C.-M. Yoshizumi M. Endege W.O. Kho C.J. Jain M.K.

The C2C12 cells were fixed by 4% paraformaldehyde. The heart sections and C2C12 cells were incubated with both the affinity-purified rabbit antibody to APEG-1/SPEG and a mouse monoclonal antibody to desmin (Sigma) at 4 °C overnight. After washing, an Alexa 488-conjugated goat antibody to mouse IgG and an Alexa 546-conjugated goat antibody to rabbit IgG were applied to the sections and coverslips at room temperature for 2 h before washing. Localization of desmin and SPEG protein signals was observed by fluorescent microscopy. By using a full-length APEG-1 cDNA probe, we identified four different isoforms in adult rat and mouse tissues by Northern analysis (Fig.1, A and B, respectively). In addition to the 1.4-kb APEG-1 mRNA, two messages of 9 and 11 kb were found in adult tissues containing striated muscles such as skeletal muscle and heart (Fig. 1). A 4-kb message was also seen in the brain and aorta (Fig. 1). The 9- and 11-kb messages were not identified previously by an APEG-1 3′ cDNA probe obtained by differential mRNA display (data not shown and also Fig.5 A, IV). We termed the 9- and 11-kb messages SPEGα and SPEGβ, respectively, for their preferential expression in the striated muscle, and the 4-kb message BPEG for its expression in the brain. Since we have shown that APEG-1 is a single copy gene in the genome (13Hsieh C.-M. Yet S.-F. Layne M.D. Watanabe M. Hong A.M. Perrella M.A. Lee M.-E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14344-14351Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), we speculated that these isoforms were products of the same gene locus as APEG-1.Figure 5Northern analysis of APEG-1, BPEG, SPEGα, and SPEGβ. A, Northern analysis of mouse tissues using APEG-1 isoform-specific probes. Six probes (dashed lines) were generated from different regions of APEG-1 and SPEGβ cDNAs and used to hybridize with identical blots (I–VI) containing total RNA (10 μg/lane) from mouse brain (B), aorta (A), skeletal muscle (S), and heart (H). B, generation of APEG-1, BPEG, and SPEG mRNAs by two transcription initiation sites and alternative splicing. The same upstream transcription initiation site may be used by SPEGβ and BPEG, and the intronic APEG-1 promoter was used by both APEG-1 and SPEGα. The APEG-1 and BPEG mRNAs used the last exon of APEG-1, whereas the SPEGα and SPEGβ ended with another downstream exon. The predicted mRNA size (excluding poly(A) tail length, in kilobase) of each isoform is indicated on theright.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To obtain the SPEG cDNA sequence, we screened an adult mouse heart cDNA library using an APEG-1 cDNA 5′-end probe. An 11-kb SPEGβ cDNA contig was assembled from several cDNA library screenings and both 5′- and 3′-RACE (Fig. 2 A). We repeated the 5′-RACE twice using different sets of primers and confirmed the same 5′-end of the SPEGβ cDNA (data not shown). An open reading frame was identified between base pairs 144 and 9929 with no other upstream ATG initiation codon. Multiple stop codons were also found in all three reading frames in the 5′-untranslated region (data not shown). The deduced 3262-residue SPEGβ peptide sequence (Fig.2 B) had a predicted molecular mass of 355 kDa. The APEG-1 peptide sequence was found at residues 855–965 of the SPEGβ protein with the exception of its last two amino acids (Fig. 2 B). A PROSITE data base search revealed that the SPEGβ protein contained two putative serine/threonine kinase catalytic sites and one ATP-binding site (Fig. 2 B) (17Hofmann K. Bucher P. Falquet L. Bairoch A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 215-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (1000) Google Scholar). A BLAST search in the nonredundant protein data base identified a partial human KIAA1297 protein (18Nagase T. Kikuno R. Ishikawa K.I. Hirosawa M. Ohara O. DNA Res. 2000; 7: 65-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) with a 75% identity to the SPEGβ protein, suggesting that the KIAA1297 is a human counterpart of the SPEGβ. Furthermore, significant homology was identified between the SPEGβ and proteins of the myosin light chain kinase (MLCK) family including MLCK, titin, twitchin, projectin, and death-associated protein kinases. By using ProDom and PFam data base analyses (19Bateman A. Birney E. Durbin R. Eddy S.R. Howe K.L. Sonnhammer E.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 263-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (1211) Google Scholar, 20Corpet F. Servant F. Gouzy J. Kahn D. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 267-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar), we found that the homology between SPEGβ and these proteins was not limited to the kinase domains but extended to multiple immunoglobulin and fibronectin structural domains (Fig. 2 B and 3 A). These domains have been implicated in homophilic or heterophilic interaction of other myosin-binding proteins (21Epstein H.F. Fischman D.A. Science. 1991; 251: 1039-1044Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). We hypothesized that the SPEGβ and potentially the other three isoforms (APEG-1, BPEG, and SPEGα) were part of the functionally and structurally diverse MLCK protein family (22Kemp B.E. Faux M.C.

A, the internal (SPEG-i) and carboxyl-terminal (SPEG-c) ATP-binding and serine/threonine kinase domains of the SPEG proteins were aligned with proteins of the MLCK family, including human death-associated protein kinase I (DAPK1, GenBankTMaccession number AAC35001), human titin (GenBankTMaccession number I38344), human smooth muscle MLCK (GenBankTM accession number Q15746), Caenorhabditis elegans twitchin (GenBankTM accession number S07571), and Drosophila melanogaster projectin (GenBankTMaccession number AAC27550). Solid boxes and shaded boxes highlight amino acid residues that were identical or similar in at least four proteins, respectively. The ATP-binding site (solid line) and serine/threonine kinase catalytic site (dashed line) are shown. The 11 subdomains conserved within serine/threonine kinases are indicated above the sequences, and the 15 amino acids conserved in most protein kinase domains (23Hanks S.K. Quinn A.M. Hunter T. Science. 1988; 241: 42-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (3775) Google Scholar,24Hanks S.K. Quinn A.M.

A FLAG-tagged SPEG minikinase (SPEGmk) plasmid was transfected into 293T cells as described under “Experimental Procedures.” An empty vector (Control) and a FLAG-tagged Akt (Akt) plasmid served as negative and positive controls, respectively. One mg of total cell lysate was immunoprecipitated by an agarose bead-conjugated anti-FLAG M2 monoclonal antibody, and the immunoprecipitated protein was used in the in vitro kinase assay (IP + kinase assay). Fifty μg of the cell lysate was analyzed by Western blot with the M2 monoclonal antibody to FLAG peptide to demonstrate expression of the fusion proteins (Western blot). The two FLAG-tagged fusion proteins (arrows) and the molecular mass (in kilodaltons) are shown. An asterisk indicates a smaller Akt fusion protein that may derive from protein degradation or from a translation initiation at an internal ATG codon.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We compared the kinase domains of SPEGβ and several other homologous proteins (Fig.3 A). This region is defined to contain 11 subdomains and is conserved among the serine/threonine kinases (23Hanks S.K. Quinn A.M. Hunter T. Science. 1988; 241: 42-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (3775) Google Scholar, 24Hanks S.K. Quinn A.M. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 200: 38-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (1079) Google Scholar). The internal putative kinase domain of SPEGβ (SPEG-i) showed a 37% identity (98 of 268 residues) to the consensus sequence of the other kinases (Fig. 3 A). In addition, all but one of the 15 conserved residues within the kinase domain are identified in the internal kinase domain of SPEGβ (Fig.3 A, see asterisks) (23Hanks S.K. Quinn A.M. Hunter T. Science. 1988; 241: 42-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (3775) Google Scholar, 24Hanks S.K. Quinn A.M. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 200: 38-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (1079) Google Scholar). Due to the divergence in the ATP-binding region (subdomains I and II) and subdomain VII in the carboxyl-terminal putative kinase domain of SPEGβ (SPEG-c), there was only a 24% identity (64 of 268 residues) to the other kinases (Fig. 3 A). We therefore chose to test the biochemical activity of the internal putative kinase domain of SPEGβ. A SPEG minikinase plasmid that expressed a FLAG-tagged SPEG internal kinase domain was constructed. The sequence of the SPEG minikinase included 29 serine and threonine residues, and in anin vitro kinase assay this minikinase was capable of autophosphorylation (Fig. 3 B). As a positive control we used a non-related FLAG-tagged Akt, which is also a serine/threonine protein kinase, in the same experiment. This FLAG-Akt fusion protein showed autophosphorylation (Fig. 3 B) as previously reported (25Franke T.F. Kaplan D.R. Cantley L.C. Toker A. Science. 1997; 275: 665-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (1290) Google Scholar). We previously reported thatAPEG-1 is a single copy gene (13Hsieh C.-M. Yet S.-F. Layne M.D. Watanabe M. Hong A.M. Perrella M.A. Lee M.-E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14344-14351Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). We also found that sequences corresponding to the first and the last exons ofAPEG-1 were absent in the 11-kb SPEGβ cDNA sequence, suggesting that SPEGβ was produced by another upstream promoter and by alternative splicing in a tissue-specific manner. To study how all four isoforms were transcribed from a single copy gene, we obtained additional genomic DNA flanking the APEG-1. From the genomic DNA clones we identified multiple SPEGβ exons both upstream and downstream of APEG-1 (Fig.4). The identified exon-intron junctions (Fig. 4) were all in agreement with the consensus 5′-GT and 3′-AG sequences (26Breathnach R. Chambon P. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1981; 50: 349-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (3284) Google Scholar). In addition, the first exon of APEG-1 was located in an ∼9-kb SPEGβ intron, and the lastAPEG-1 exon was within another downstream intron (Fig. 4). The APEG-1 promoter (13Hsieh C.-M. Yet S.-F. Layne M.D. Watanabe M. Hong A.M. Perrella M.A. Lee M.-E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14344-14351Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) was located within the ∼8-kb intronic sequence between the first exon of APEG-1 and the immediate upstream SPEGβ exon. To elucidate further the use of different exons by the four different isoforms, we performed a series of Northern blot analyses with various APEG-1 and SPEG cDNA probes (Fig.5 A). The last exon ofAPEG-1 hybridized only to the APEG-1 and BPEG messages (Fig.5 A, IV). This exon contained an in-frame stop codon at its 5′-end and a polyadenylation signal, and was likely the last exon of the BPEG as it is of the APEG-1(13Hsieh C.-M. Yet S.-F. Layne M.D. Watanabe M. Hong A.M. Perrella M.A. Lee M.-E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14344-14351Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). All four isoforms (APEG-1, BPEG, SPEGα, and SPEGβ) were recognized by a cDNA probe derived from the middle three exons ofAPEG-1 (Fig. 5 A, III). This result was consistent with our initial finding (Fig. 1) and implied that these three exons were used by all isoforms, since excluding any of the three exons would have caused a shift in the reading frame. The probe derived from the first APEG-1 exon hybridized to the 1.4-kb APEG-1 and the 9-kb SPEGα (Fig. 5 A, II), suggesting that these two isoforms initiated their transcription from the intronicAPEG-1 promoter. The immediate upstream SPEGβexon hybridized only to the 4-kb BPEG and the 11-kb SPEGβ (Fig.5 A, I), indicating that the transcription for these two isoforms initiated from at least one other promoter upstream of the APEG-1. We had also tested a SPEGβ cDNA probe further upstream of the APEG-1 that gave results similar to those in panel I of Fig. 5 A (data not shown). Two cDNA probes corresponding to the two putative SPEG kinase domains downstream of APEG-1 hybridized to both SPEGα and SPEGβ (Fig. 5 A, V and VI), demonstrating that these two isoforms contained both kinase domains and that neither the APEG-1 nor the BPEG did. Taken together, we hypothesized that the selective use of two transcription start sites and alternative splicing in tissue-specific manners gave rise to the four different isoforms (Fig. 5 B). Besides their tissue distribution, the distinction between SPEGα and SPEGβ and between APEG-1 and BPEG was their 5′-end promoter selection. Moreover, alternative splicing differentiated SPEGβ from BPEG and SPEGα from APEG-1. However, we could not exclude the possibility that SPEGβ and BPEG used different promoters due to their distinct tissue distribution. We previously showed that APEG-1 is a sensitive marker for VSMC differentiation (12Hsieh C.-M. Yoshizumi M. Endege W.O. Kho C.J. Jain M.K. Kashiki S. de los Santos R. Lee W.-S"
https://openalex.org/W2083831568,"The serine protease domain of factor Xa (FXa) contains a sodium as well as a calcium-binding site. Here, we investigated the functional significance of these two cation-binding sites and their thermodynamic links to the S1 site. Kinetic data reveal that Na+ binds to the substrate bound FXa withK d ∼39 mm in the absence and ∼9.5 mm in the presence of Ca2+. Sodium-bound FXa (sodium-Xa) has ∼18-fold increased catalytic efficiency (∼4.5-fold decrease in K m and ∼4-fold increase ink cat) in hydrolyzing S-2222 (benzoyl-Ile-Glu-Gly-Arg-p-nitroanilide), and Ca2+ further increases this k cat∼1.4-fold. Ca2+ binds to the protease domain of substrate bound FXa with K d ∼705 μm in the absence and ∼175 μm in the presence of Na+. Ca2+ binding to the protease domain of FXa (Xa-calcium) has no effect on the K m but increases thek cat ∼4-fold in hydrolyzing S-2222, and Na+ further increases this k cat∼1.4-fold. In agreement with the K m data, sodium-Xa has ∼5-fold increased affinity in its interaction withp-aminobenzamidine (S1 site probe) and ∼4-fold increased rate in binding to the two-domain tissue factor pathway inhibitor; Ca2+ (±Na+) has no effect on these interactions. Antithrombin binds to Xa-calcium with a ∼4-fold faster rate, to sodium-Xa with a ∼24-fold faster rate and to sodium-Xa-calcium with a ∼28-fold faster rate. Thus, Ca2+and Na+ together increase the catalytic efficiency of FXa ∼28-fold. Na+ enhances Ca2+ binding, and Ca2+ enhances Na+ binding. Further, Na+ enhances S1 site occupancy, and S1 site occupancy enhances Na+ binding. Therefore, Na+ site is thermodynamically linked to the S1 site as well as to the protease domain Ca2+ site, whereas Ca2+ site is only linked to the Na+ site. The significance of these findings is that during physiologic coagulation, most of the FXa formed will exist as sodium-Xa-calcium, which has maximum biologic activity.

The human protein circulates as a zymogen with a molecular weight of ∼59,000 and consists of a light chain (amino acids 1–139) and a heavy chain (amino acids 143–448) held together by a single disulfide bond between Cys-132 and Cys-302 (1Leytus S.P. Foster D.C. Kurachi K. Davie E.W. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 5098-5102Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Upon activation by factor VIIa, Ca2+, and tissue factor or by factor IXa, Ca2+phospholipid, and factor VIIIa, a single peptide bond in factor X between residues Arg-194(c15) 1For comparison, the factor X amino acid numbering system is used. The numbers with a prefix c (e.g.c195) in parentheses refer to the chymotrypsin equivalents for the protease domain of FXa. Where insertions occur, the chymotrypsin numbering is followed by a capital letter, such as A. and Ile-195(c16) is cleaved with resultant formation of a serine protease, factor Xa (FXa),2 and release of a 52-residue activation peptide (1Leytus S.P.

Blood. 1990; 76: 1-16Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). FXa is converted to its β-form where a ∼4-kDa peptide is cleaved off from the COOH terminus of the heavy chain; this, however, does not result in a loss of coagulant activity (3Di Scipio R.G. Hermodson M.A. Davie E.W. Biochemistry. 1977; 16: 5253-5260Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). FXa converts prothrombin to thrombin (IIa) in a reaction requiring Ca2+, phospholipid membrane, and factor Va (FVa) (2Mann K.G. Nesheim M.E. Church W.R. Haley P. Krishnaswamy S.

Through its active site Ser-397(c195), FXa also binds to the serpin antithrombin (AT) (5Jesty J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 17539-17544Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and to the second Kunitz domain of tissue factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI) (6Girard J.J. Warren L.A. Novotny W.F. Likert K.M.

The NH2 terminus light chain of human FXa contains 11 γ-carboxyglutamic acid (Gla) residues and represents the Gla domain (residues 1–39); the Gla domain is followed by a few aromatic residues (hydrophobic stack; residues 40–45), and two epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like domains (EGF1 residues 46–84, EGF2 residues 85–128). The heavy chain contains the serine protease domain essential for catalysis and features the active site triad of His-236(c57), Asp-282(c102), and Ser-379(c195) (1Leytus S.P. Foster D.C. Kurachi K.

It has been reported that serine proteases, like IIa, that contain Tyr or Phe at position c225 possess a sodium binding site, whereas proteases like trypsin with a Pro at this position do not contain such a site (13Dang Q.D. Di Cera E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 10653-10656Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). IIa binds to Na+ via two carbonyl O atoms of residues Arg-c221A and Lys-c224 and four water molecules (14Zhang E. Tulinsky A. Biophys. Chem. 1997; 63: 185-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 15Guinto E.R. Caccia S. Rose T. Fütterer K. Waksman G. Di Cera E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 1852-1857Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). When residue at c225 is a Pro, as in trypsin, or in Yc225P mutant of IIa, the carbonyl O atom of the residue c224 points away from the Na+ coordination shell and therefore cannot participate in binding to Na+ (13Dang Q.D. Di Cera E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 10653-10656Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 14Zhang E. Tulinsky A. Biophys.

The procoagulant function involves conversion of fibrinogen to fibrin as well as activations of factors V and VIII (4Bajaj S.P. Joist J.H. Semin. Thromb. Hemostasis. 1999; 25: 407-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). The anticoagulant function involves binding of IIa to thrombomodulin, which enables IIa to activate protein C to activated protein C. Activated protein C, the function of which is also regulated by Na+ (13Dang Q.D. Di Cera E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Hemostasis. 1999; 25: 407-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Data exist indicating that the Na+-free IIa preferentially performs the anticoagulant function, whereas the Na+-bound IIa preferentially carries out the coagulant function (20Dang Q.D. Vindigni A. Di Cera E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5977-5981Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Thus, association or dissociation of Na+creates a molecular switch in the functions of IIa. In addition to IIa, factors VIIa, IXa, and Xa are each thought to possess a Na+-binding site in their protease domains (13Dang Q.D. Di Cera E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 10653-10656Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar,21Orthner C. Kosow D.P. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1978; 185: 400-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 22Mathur A.

However, only the site in FXa is crystallographically defined (14Zhang E. Tulinsky A. Biophys. Chem. 1997; 63: 185-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Importantly, in contrast to IIa, the Na+ site in FXa involves four carbonyl O atoms from two different loops (14Zhang E. Tulinsky A. Biophys. Chem. 1997; 63: 185-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). In this report, we have extensively characterized the function of Na+-binding site in FXa and its relation to the protease domain Ca2+-binding site as well as to the S1 site. The present data indicate that choline chloride, which in recent studies (13Dang Q.D. Di Cera E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 10653-10656Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 23Rezaie A.R. He X. Cheng M. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1999; 27 (suppl.) (abstr. 104): 36Google Scholar) has been used as an inert ion to maintain constant ionic strength, is a potent inhibitor of FXa catalytic activity. We further establish that the monovalent Na+ site is thermodynamically linked to the protease domain divalent Ca2+ site as well as to the S1 site. Thus, sodium enhances substrate binding, and substrate enhances sodium binding. Further, Ca2+ binding to the protease domain increases the affinity for Na+, and Na+ binding increases the affinity of Ca2+ at this site in FXa. This results in maximal FXa enzymatic activity under physiologic conditions. Benzoyl-Ile-Glu-Gly-Arg-p-nitroanilide (S-2222) was purchased from Helena Laboratories. Polyethylene glycol (PEG) 8000, p-aminobenzamidine (PABA), andNα -p-tosyl-l-Phe chloromethyl ketone-treated bovine trypsin were obtained from Sigma. Lovenox, a low molecular weight heparin, was obtained from Rhone-Poulenc Rorer Pharmaceuticals. Human factor X and prothrombin were purified as described earlier (24Bajaj S.P. Rapaport S.I. Prodanos C. Prep. Biochem. 1981; 11: 397-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Two-domain TFPI (residues 1–161) was expressed and purified as described (25Petersen J.G. Meyn G.

It showed a single band (∼30,000 Da) on nonreduced and reduced SDS-PAGE (26Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207211) Google Scholar). Des-44-X was prepared and purified by QAE-Sephadex A-50 column chromatography as described by Morita and Jackson (27Morita T. Jackson C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 4015-4023Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). FXa and Des-44-Xa were prepared using insolublized Russell's viper venom as outlined previously (24Bajaj S.P. Rapaport S.I. Prodanos C. Prep. Biochem. 1981; 11: 397-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 27Morita T. Jackson C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 4015-4023Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). FXa was also purchased from Enzyme Research Laboratories, Inc. Human AT was obtained from Hematologic Technologies, Inc. The purity of both FXa and Des-44-Xa protein was examined by SDS gel electrophoresis (26Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207211) Google Scholar) and was >98% as depicted earlier (8Sabharwal A.K.

The purity of AT was assured by the supplier (SDS gels were provided). Each protein sample was freed of Na+ by dilution or dialysis and/or by a desalting column exactly as described by Wells and Di Cera (28Wells C.M. Di Cera E. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 11721-11730Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). The final concentration of Na+after these steps was <1 mm as measured by a conductivity meter as outlined by Wells and Di Cera (28Wells C.M. Di Cera E. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 11721-11730Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). The proteins were frozen at −80 °C in 10–15-μl aliquots, thawed, and used immediately. This freezing and thawing step did not result in a measurable loss of activity. Automated Edman degradation of each protein component was performed using an Applied Biosystems model 477A gas phase sequencer. Approximately 0.5 nmol of protein was loaded on the filter cartridge. The proteins from SDS gels were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes as described by Rosenberg (29Rosenberg I.M. Protein Analysis and Purification: Benchtop Techniques. Birkhäuser, Boston, MA1996: 153-156Google Scholar). The NH2-terminal sequence analysis of Des-44-X revealed two sequences of approximately equimolar amounts, one corresponding to the heavy chain (Ser-Val-Ala-Gln-Ala) and the other corresponding to the modified light chain (Lys-Asp-Gly-Asp-Gln). This indicates that Des-44-X does not contain the Gla domain. SDS gel electrophoresis was performed using the Laemmli buffer system (26Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207211) Google Scholar). The acrylamide concentration was 15%, and the gels were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue dye. All proteins used in the present study were ∼98% pure. The concentration of FXa and Des-44-Xa used was between 1 and 5 nm each. The S-2222 concentration ranged from 20 μm to 3 mm. The buffer used was 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, containing 0.1% PEG and various salt combinations. The p-nitroaniline release was measured continuously (ΔA 405 nm/min) for up to 30 min using a Beckman DU65 spectrophotometer equipped with a Soft-Pac kinetics module. An extinction coefficient of 9.9 mm−1 cm−1 at 405 nmwas used in calculating the amount of p-nitroaniline released (30Lottenberg R. Jackson C.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1983; 742: 558-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). All reactions were performed in triplicate. TheK m and k cat values were obtained using the Enzyme Kinetics program from Erithacus Software. Binding of PABA was measured by increase in its intrinsic fluorescence upon binding to the active site of FXa using an SLM 8000C fluorescence spectrophotometer. The concentration of FXa used was 1.7 μm, and the excitation wavelength was 336 nm (31Monroe D.M. Sherrill G.B. Roberts H.R. Anal. Biochem. 1988; 172: 427-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). A titration of the protein solution (300 μl) was performed by adding small increments (1–2 μl) of 1 or 2 mm stock solution of PABA, and the resulting fluorescence at 376 nm was measured at each point after the attainment of equilibrium conditions (usually 1 min). Excitation bandwidth was set at 4 nm, and emission bandwidth was set at 2 nm. Because binding of PABA to FXa is expected to be relatively weak (32Betz A. Vlasuk G.P. Bergum P.W. Krishnaswamy S. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 181-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), high concentrations of PABA are needed to study this interaction. This leads to a significant absorption of the exciting light, and the data therefore require corrections for the inner filter effect (32Betz A. Vlasuk G.P. Bergum P.W. Krishnaswamy S. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 181-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 33Lakowicz J.R. in Principles of Fluorescence Spectroscopy. Plenum Publishers, New York1999: 52-54Google Scholar). First, the nonlinear dependence of fluorescence on PABA concentration in the buffer (without protein) was evaluated according to Equation 1 (32Betz A. Vlasuk G.P. Bergum P.W. Krishnaswamy S. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 181-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Fobs=(Pm+i)/10εLEquation 1 where P is the concentration of PABA, mand i are, respectively, the slope and intercept of the expected linear dependence on PABA concentration in buffer, ε is the extinction coefficient of PABA at 336 nm excitation wavelength (experimentally determined to be 1426 m−1cm−1), and L is effective path length for the fluorescence cell. The value of L determined using Equation1 was 0.4 ± 0.2. The corrected fluorescence signal (F corr) was then obtained using Equation 2(32Betz A. Vlasuk G.P. Bergum P.W. Krishnaswamy S. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 181-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar).Fcorr=Fobs10εLEquation 2 Binding data were then fitted to a single ligand binding site with a defined background using the following equation.y=b+((c−b)x)/(Kdapp+x)Equation 3 where K dapp is the apparent dissociation constant, y is the inner filter corrected fluorescence at a given PABA concentration depicted by x,b is the corrected background fluorescence in the absence of protein, and c is the corrected fluorescence at saturating concentrations of PABA. These reactions were carried out in Dynatech microtiter well plates. Each reaction mixture (150 μl) contained 400 μm S-2222, constant FXa, which varied from 50 to 1600 pm in different sets of experiments and a constant predetermined concentration of TFPI. 55 μl of S-2222/TFPI mixture was added to each well containing 95 μl of FXa. Starting at time 0, absorbance at 405 nm (p-nitroaniline release) was recorded for up to 6 h in Bio-Rad model 550 microtiter plate reader operated through Bio-Rad Labs Microtiter Manager PC software. Reaction conditions are provided in the legend to Fig. 8. The data were analyzed based upon the slow tight binding mechanism established for FXa·TFPI as follows, Xa+TFPI⇆k2k1Xa:TFPI⇆k4k3Xa:TFPI*Equation 4 where Xa·TFPI is the steady state complex, which then isomerizes and results in the formation of Xa·TFPI*,k 1 and k 2 are the forward and reverse rates for the initial binding, andk 3 and k 4 are the forward and reverse rates for the isomerization step. To calculate the binding parameters, first the initial (v in) and steady state (v st) velocities were calculated using Equation 5, as described by Morrison and Walsh (34Morrison J.F. Walsh C.T. Adv. Enzymol. 1988; 61: 201-301PubMed Google Scholar), [P]=vstt+[(vin+vst)/(kobs][1−exp(−kobst)]Equation 5 where [P] represents the concentration of p-NA formed at time t, v in andv st are respectively the rates of substrate hydrolysis before and after the steady state is achieved, andk obs is the rate of conversion ofv in to v st. For these reactions, TFPI concentrations were in large excess of FXa. Thus, the free TFPI concentration did not change significantly during the course of the reaction. Further, the rates in the control experiments performed in the absence of TFPI did not change over the course of measurement. Thus, substrate depletion did not contribute tov st. The values of k obs obtained above were fitted to Equation 3 to resolve the individual parameters. In this case in Equation 3, y represents k obs at a given concentration of two-domain TFPI depicted by x, whereas b and c, respectively, representk 4 and (k 3 +k 4), and K dapprepresents k 2/k 1(35Copeland R.A.

TheK m values obtained under different conditions (listed in Table I) were used to obtainK i. Serpin AT binds FXa irreversibly and should displace PABA bound at the active site. Thus, the AT binding to FXa was monitored by measuring the decrease in fluorescence of FXa·PABA solution. The wavelengths for excitation (bandwidth, 4 nm) and emission (bandwidth, 2 nm) were set at 336 and 376 nm, respectively. For each salt condition, FXa at 1.7 μm was mixed with PABA at the respective K d concentration (Table II) in the presence of 100 ng/ml (found to be saturating) low molecular weight heparin. AT was then added, and the decrease in the inner filter corrected fluorescence was determined at 1–5-s intervals for up to 30 min. The data were fitted to the equation given below.Table IEffects of calcium and sodium on the hydrolysis of S-2222 by FXaConditionsK m appk cat appk cat/K mNa+Ca2+μms −1s −1 mm −1−−514 ± 2116 ± 231 (1) 1-aThe fold change in specificity constant is given in parentheses.+−114 ± 1573 ± 8640 (21)−+584 ± 2269 ± 7118 (4)++132 ± 15107 ± 10810 (26)To keep the ionic strength constant, the concentration of Na+was 500 mm in the absence of calcium and 485 mmin the presence of 5 mm calcium.

To reach these targets, however, CRT would need to be present both in the nucleus and the cytosol. Although CRT has been reported in these cellular compartments (see Refs. 2Michalak M. Milner R.E.

Cell. 1997; 88: 439-443Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar), the bulk of the protein clearly resides elsewhere, i.e. inside the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Within the ER lumen, CRT may assist in the folding and assembly of glycoproteins (14Zhang J.X. Braakman I. Matlack K.E. Helenius A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 1943-1954Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 15Fujino I. Yamada N. Miyawaki A. Hasegawa M. Furuichi T. Mikoshiba K.

ER CRT may also act as a repository of readily releasable Ca2+, with each mole of CRT binding as many as 20–25 mol of Ca2+. Since Ca2+ release from the ER is controlled mainly by the second messenger inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (InsP3), CRT emerges as a potential regulator of this ubiquitous signal transduction pathway. The InsP3-induced Ca2+ signal has two main components, the release of Ca2+ from the intracellular stores (InsP3-induced Ca2+ release, or IICR) and the influx of Ca2+ across the plasma membrane (InsP3-induced Ca2+ influx, or IICI). IICR starts when InsP3 binds to its intracellular receptor (InsP3R), a ligand-gated Ca2+ channel that traverses the lipid membrane surrounding the ER. The resulting discharge of ER Ca2+ into the cytosol is often spatially complex, with periodic focal release of Ca2+ actively spreading to the rest of the cell through mechanisms that remain incompletely understood (18Thomas A.P. Bird G.S. Hajnoczky G. Robb-Gaspers L.D. Putney J.W. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 1505-1517Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar). IICI commonly follows IICR, thereby allowing cells to recharge their internal stores. Stimulation of Ca2+ influx appears closely linked to the depletion of the intracellular Ca2+ stores, a relationship known as capacitative Ca2+ entry. We do not yet understand how Ca2+ store depletion stimulates Ca2+ influx. Store depletion could communicate with the plasma membrane through a diffusible messenger (19Randriamampita C. Tsien R.Y.

Chem. 1974; 249: 974-979Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we do not yet know what role, if any, CRT plays in the regulation of the InsP3-induced Ca2+ signal. Whereas gene knock-out experiments indicate that CRT is not essential for IICR (11Coppolino M.G. Woodside M.J. Demaurex N. Grinstein S. St-Arnaud R. Dedhar S. Nature. 1997; 386: 843-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar), overexpression of CRT has been associated with a decrease in the magnitude of IICI in mammalian cell lines (26Bastianutto C. Clementi E. Docazzi F. Podini P. De Georgi F. Rizzutto R. Meldolesi J. Pozzan T. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 847-855Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 27Mery L. Mesaeli N. Michalak M. Opas M.

Cell. 1998; 9: 1513-1522Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). These results have prompted the hypothesis that CRT reduces capacitative Ca2+ entry by buffering the free Ca2+ concentration within the ER lumen ([Ca2+]ER) above the levels required to trigger capacitative Ca2+ influx. In this work, our objective was to put this hypothesis to a rigorous test by directly measuring [Ca2+]ER in a widely used model cell, the Xenopus oocyte. Our data indicate that CRT requires its high capacity Ca2+-binding domain both to attenuate the InsP3-induced decrease in [Ca2+]ER and to reduce the elevations of [Ca2+]i due to IICI. The ability of CRT to buffer [Ca2+]ER may thus be functionally relevant to the InsP3-induced Ca2+ signal. We inserted the CRT cDNA cloned from the HL60 human leukemia cell line (29Denning G.M. Leidal K.G. Holst V.A. Iyer S.S. Pearson D.W. Clark J.R. Nauseef W.M. Clark R.A.

To remove the C-domain (CRT-ΔC), we amplified the N and P domains of CRT (amino acids 2–315) and added a KDEL ER retrieval sequence at the C terminus (primers 1 and 2). The PCR fragment was digested with MluI and EcoRI and inserted between those sites in a modified pMT3. For the construct lacking the P-domain (CRT-ΔP), we amplified the N-domain (amino acids 2–197, primers 1 and 3) and the C-domain (amino acids 316–401, primers 4 and 5) separately. The PCR fragments were then respectively digested with MluI/SpeI and with SpeI/EcoRI and ligated between theMluI and the EcoRI sites of pMT3.

To ensure that the individual cells studied electrophysiologically expressed the protein of interest, plasmid cDNA coding for CRT or CRT mutants was co-injected with pMT3-sg25 (20:1 concentration ratio), a vector coding for an enhanced green fluorescent protein (GFP). We performed electrophysiology experiments on those live cells that showed the highest GFP fluorescence. We excised the “yellow chameleon-3er or -4er” (3er or 4er) cDNAs (gifts from Dr. Roger Y. Tsien, Howard Hughes Medical Institute, University of California, San Diego, CA) from the pcDNA vector and inserted them between theNotI and EcoRI sites of pMT3.

Upon Ca2+ binding, CaM enfolds M13 thereby creating FRET between YFP and CFP. To enable measurements of the relatively high [Ca2+]ER, CaM sequences of 3er and 4er were modified to lower their affinity for Ca2+ (44Miyawaki A. Liopis J. Helm R. McCaffery J.M. Aeams J.A. Ikura M. Tsien R.Y. Nature. 1997; 388: 882-887Crossref PubMed Scopus (2620) Google Scholar). 3er and 4er also include sequences from CRT that allow their retrieval into the ER lumen. To measure FRET, we illuminated oocytes expressing 3er/4er (λ = 440 ± 15 nm, DeltaRam monochromator, Photon Technology International, Monmouth Junction, NJ, 455DCLP dichroic mirror) and recorded the emission intensity at two wavelengths, 485 and 535 nm, using separate photomultiplier tubes (520DCLP dichroic mirror, D485/40M and D5356/30M emission filters, Chroma Technology, Brattleboro, VT). If we could not calibrate 3er in vivo, we could nevertheless use the 535/485 fluorescence ratio to compare [Ca2+]ER among cells submitted to identical illumination. In these experiments, the gains of the photomultiplier tubes were carefully matched, and neutral black levels were determined experimentally (45Lipp P. Niggli E. Cell Calcium. 1993; 14: 359-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Oocyte cryosections (5 μm thick) were incubated for 30 min first with 1/200–1/500 dilutions of the anti-CRT antibody and then with a fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-rabbit secondary antibody, and examined with a fluorescence microscope as described before (32DeLisle S. Blondel O. Longo F.J. Schnabel W.E. Bell G.I. Welsh M.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: C1255-C1261Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For ultrastructural studies, cryosections (10 μm thick) were fixed, incubated for 1 h in anti-CRT antibody and then overnight in anti-rabbit antibody conjugated to 5 nm gold particles (Janssen Life Sciences Products, Piscataway, NJ), and prepared for examination under in a Hitachi 7000 electron microscope (Hitachi Ltd., Tokyo) as described previously (32DeLisle S. Blondel O. Longo F.J. Schnabel W.E. Bell G.I. Welsh M.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: C1255-C1261Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Oocytes injected either with pMT3 alone or with pMT3-CRT were incubated in45Ca2+-containing solution (8 μCi/ml).45Ca2+-related counts increased gradually and reached a plateau at 36–48 h, indicating equilibration across the Ca2+-binding compartments of the oocyte. After a 72-h incubation period, chosen to ensure isotopic equilibrium, intact oocytes were washed 5 times in cold solution and individually transferred to scintillation vials for counting. Alternatively, the washed oocytes were combined and homogenized, and their microsomes were purified and recovered on filter paper prior to counting, as per our previously published methodology (33Parys J.B. Sernett S.W. DeLisle S. Snyder P.M. Welsh M.J. Campbell K.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 18776-18782Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Oocytes were injected with either fluo 3 alone (250 μm), Ca2+ orange alone (250 μm), or a mixture of fluo 3 (100 μm) and fura red (300 μm) (Molecular Probes). They were then stimulated with a 30-nl droplet of Ins(2,4,5)P3 (10 μm) and the resulting fluorescence visualized on a confocal microscope as described previously (46DeLisle S. Welsh M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 7963-7966Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Ca2+ wave amplitude, velocity, frequency, as well as rates of rise/decrease in [Ca2+]i at the wave fronts were determined as detailed before (32DeLisle S. Blondel O. Longo F.J. Schnabel W.E. Bell G.I. Welsh M.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: C1255-C1261Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To compare [Ca2+]i between different cells using visible excitation wavelengths, we ratioed the simultaneously measured fluorescence signal from fluo 3 and fura red (45Lipp P. Niggli E. Cell Calcium. 1993; 14: 359-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). The detailed validation of this technique in the oocyte has been previously published (32DeLisle S. Blondel O. Longo F.J. Schnabel W.E. Bell G.I. Welsh M.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: C1255-C1261Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Image analysis was performed using the NIH Image version 1.61 software. On a Western blot of microsomal proteins from which we have previously purified CRT, the ER lumenal protein calsequestrin and the InsP3R (33Parys J.B. Sernett S.W. DeLisle S. Snyder P.M. Welsh M.J.

Blood. 1997; 90: 372-381Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), labeled an ∼60-kDa protein (Fig.1, 1st lane). After injection with pMT3-CRT, the density of this band increased significantly, indicating overexpression of CRT (Fig. 1, 2nd lane). Immunostaining revealed reticular fluorescence that increased from the vegetal to the animal pole of the cell in a pattern similar to that of control cells, but much brighter (Fig.2). We observed a similar fluorescence pattern with overexpressed InsP3R (32DeLisle S. Blondel O. Longo F.J. Schnabel W.E. Bell G.I. Welsh M.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: C1255-C1261Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Under electron microscopy using a gold-labeled secondary antibody targeted at an anti-CRT primary antibody, the gold particles were found in association with membranous cisternae most likely representing elements of the ER (Fig. 3). There was no label associated with mitochondria or with other organelles. Given CRT's ER retrieval sequences and lack of hydrophobic regions that can stretch across lipid bilayers, our data suggest that CRT is overexpressed within the ER lumen.Figure 2Localization of CRT by immunofluorescence. Anti-CRT staining shows a marked increase in fluorescence signal in CRT-expressing oocytes (lower panels) compared with controls (upper panels). The reticular pattern, the subcortical columns (arrowheads), and the decreasing fluorescence from the animal pole (A andD) to the equatorial region (B and E) and to the vegetal pole (C and F) is typical of the ER distribution in oocytes. Oocytes exposed only to the secondary antibody were negative.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Figure 3Localization of CRT by immunogold staining.

Gold particles targeted against an anti-CRT antibody are associated with cisternae of endoplasmic reticulum (arrowheads).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To investigate the effect of CRT overexpression on Ca2+ influx, we microinjected either pMT3 or pMT3-CRT in oocytes. We then stimulated the cells with a saturating concentration of InsP3 (10 nl of 10−3m solution or a 10 μm average concentration) and assayed [Ca2+]i by measuring Ca2+-gated Cl− current with the two-electrode voltage clamp technique. The Ca2+-gated Cl− current reflects [Ca2+]i just beneath the plasma membrane (48Parker I. Miledi F.R.S. Proc. R. Soc. Lond. Ser. B Biol. Sci. 1986; 228: 307-315Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,49Gillo B. Lass Y. Nadler E. Oron Y. J. Physiol. (Lond. ). 1987; 392: 349-361Crossref Scopus (61) Google Scholar), where it is most likely to be affected by Ca2+ influx. The assay integrates the submembranous [Ca2+]ichanges across the entire surface of the plasma membrane, thereby maximizing our ability to detect changes in the magnitude of Ca2+ influx. In control cells, microinjection of InsP3 (10−3m in the pipette) causes a biphasic response; there is a short initial increase in [Ca2+]i followed by a slow increase (Fig.4 A). The fast initial component of the response, which is not affected by the removal of extracellular Ca2+, is due to the release of Ca2+ from the intracellular stores (50Snyder P.M. Krause K.-H. Welsh M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 11048-11051Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 51Hartzell H.C. J. Gen. Physiol. 1996; 108: 157-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). In contrast, the slow component of the response can be inhibited by decreasing the extracellular Ca2+ concentration or by adding inorganic Ca2+ channel blockers (Mn2+, Ni2+, and La3+) to the bath and thus depends on Ca2+influx (50Snyder P.M. Krause K.-H. Welsh M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 11048-11051Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 51Hartzell H.C. J. Gen.

Chem. 1997; 272: 9956-9961Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Although the magnitude of the Cl−currents due to IICR was similar to that of control cells (272 ± 28 nA in CRT versus 247 ± 23 nA in controls,n = 31 pairs of cells), the Ca2+influx-dependent Cl− current was reduced almost in half in cells overexpressing CRT (77 ± 15 nAversus 143 ± 19 nA in controls, n = 31 matched pairs of cells, one of which is shown in Fig. 4,p < 0.001). These results, which are consistent with those obtained in mammalian cell lines (26Bastianutto C. Clementi E. Docazzi F. Podini P. De Georgi F. Rizzutto R. Meldolesi J. Pozzan T. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 847-855Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 27Mery L. Mesaeli N. Michalak M. Opas M. Lew D. Krause K.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9332-9339Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar), indicate that CRT reduces the rise in [Ca2+]i due to Ca2+ influx. Direct measurements of whole cell current due to Ca2+ or Ba2+ entry have indicated that the Ca2+-gated Cl− current assay has a high sensitivity for measuring the magnitude of Ca2+ influx (22Yao Y. Ferrer-Montiel A.V. Montal M. Tsien R.Y. Cell. 1999; 98: 475-485Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar,43Yao Y. Tsien R.Y. J. Gen. Physiol. 1997; 109: 703-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Thus, our results suggest that CRT overexpression reduces the rate at which extracellular Ca2+ enters the cell. In the context of capacitative Ca2+ entry, CRT could reduce IICI by buffering [Ca2+]ER to levels above those required to stimulate Ca2+ influx. Because neither the precise value of [Ca2+]ER nor the degree to which CRT contributes to the overall Ca2+-binding properties of the ER lumenal milieu is presently known, we could not confidently predict if/how altered CRT levels affect [Ca2+]ER. To test this hypothesis, we therefore monitored [Ca2+]ER directly with an ER-targeted FRET indicator, chameleon 3er (3er) (44Miyawaki A. Liopis J. Helm R. McCaffery J.M. Aeams J.A. Ikura M. Tsien R.Y. Nature. 1997; 388: 882-887Crossref PubMed Scopus (2620) Google Scholar). At base line, the 535/485 fluorescence emission ratios in cells co-expressing 3er and CRT were similar to the ratios found in cells expressing 3er alone (1.08 ± 0.07 versus 1.09 ± 0.07, n = 16 matched cell pairs). Because the 3er indicator saturates at [Ca2+] in excess of 100 μm (44Miyawaki A. Liopis J. Helm R. McCaffery J.M. Aeams J.A. Ikura M. Tsien R.Y. Nature. 1997; 388: 882-887Crossref PubMed Scopus (2620) Google Scholar), we repeated the experiments, this time expressing a lower affinity indicator, 4er, that could report [Ca2+]ERbetween 10−4 and 10−2m. The 535/485 ratios in cells co-expressing 4er and CRT were also similar to the ratios found in control cells (0.79 ± 0.04 versus 0.81 ± 0.05, n = 6 matched cell pairs). These data indicate that overexpressed CRT does not measurably change the resting [Ca2+]ER. When microinjected with InsP3(10−4m in the pipette), the control oocyte showed a reversible decrease in the 535/485 fluorescence emission ratio of 3er, indicating a decrease in [Ca2+]ER (see Fig.5 A). As shown in Fig.5 B, cells co-expressing CRT reached a smaller InsP3-induced decline in the 535/485 emission ratio of 3er than did control cells (2.8 ± 0.8% versus 8.3 ± 0.6%, n = 16 matched cell pairs, p < 10−5), suggesting that CRT overexpression attenuates the InsP3-induced decline in [Ca2+]ER. The ability of CRT to maintain [Ca2+]ER near resting levels uncouples Ca2+ store depletion from intracellular InsP3 levels in a novel way; unlike the Ca2+ ATPase inhibitor thapsigargin, which deplete the stores at basal InsP3 levels, overexpressed CRT prevented store depletion despite high InsP3 levels. Recent evidence suggests that the role played by the InsP3R in Ca2+ influx extends beyond simply lowering [Ca2+]ER (25Ma H.-T. Patterson R.L. van Rossum D.B. Birnbaumer L. Mikoshiba K. Gill D.L. Science. 2000; 287: 1647-1651Crossref PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar). In this context, our direct measurements of [Ca2+]ER serve as a reminder that store depletion is required to stimulate Ca2+ influx and that elevated InsP3, by itself, is not sufficient. The simplest mechanism by which CRT could prevent the InsP3-induced decrease in [Ca2+]ER would be to inhibit IICR. However, our data suggested that this was not the case with saturating concentrations of InsP3; in the cells where CRT had decreased the Ca2+ influx-related Cl− current, there was no chang"

The inhibitory complexes formed between PN1 and FXIa are stable when subjected to reducing agents, SDS, and boiling, a characteristic of the acyl linkage formed between SERPINs and their cognate proteases. Using a sensitive fluorescence-quenched peptide substrate, theK assoc of PN1 for FXIa was determined to be 7.9 × 104m−1s−1 in the absence of heparin. In the presence of heparin, this rate was accelerated to 1.7 × 106, M−1 s−1, making PN1 a far better inhibitor of FXIa than C1 inhibitor, which is the only other SERPIN known to significantly inhibit FXIa. FXIa-PN1 complexes are shown to be internalized and degraded by human fibroblasts, most likely via the low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein (LRP), since degradation was strongly inhibited by the LRP agonist, receptor-associated protein. Since FXIa proteolytically modifies the amyloid precursor protein, this observation may suggest an accessory role for PN1 in the pathobiogenesis of Alzheimer's disease.

Goldsmith Jr., G.H. Blood. 1977; 50: 377-385Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). When activated by factor XIIa, each of the subunits of Factor XIa is cleaved and consists of a heavy and light chain held together by disulfide bonds (4Bouma B.N. Griffin J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 6432-6437Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7Fujikawa K. Chung D.W. Hendrickson L.E. Davie E.W.

Chem. 1983; 258: 9669-9675Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The serine protease enzymatic activity of Factor XIa resides within the light chain, and thus, each dimer of Factor XIa has two active sites (9Kurachi K. Davie E.W. Biochemistry. 1977; 16: 5831-5839Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Since Factor XIa activation is an irreversible process, the regulation of Factor XIa proteolytic activity is achieved through the action of specific inhibitors from at least two known classes of proteins. In the first class, four different members of the serine protease inhibitor (SERPIN) family have been characterized as irreversible inhibitors of Factor XIa (10Saito H. Goldsmith G.H. Moroi M. Aoki N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 2013-2017Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 11Heck L.W. Kaplan A.P. J. Exp.

Rosenberg R.D. Nature. 1973; 246: 355-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar). These include C1 inhibitor, α1-antitrypsin, α2-antiplasmin, and antithrombin III, with second order rate constants of 1.8, 0.1, 0.43, and 0.32 × 103m−1 s−1, respectively (14Wuillemin W.A. Eldering E. Citarella F. de Ruig C.P. ten Cate H. Hack C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12913-12918Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Of these four inhibitors, the second order rate constants for C1 inhibitor and antithrombin III are improved by approximately 100-fold in the presence of heparins in vitro. On the basis of rate constants, C1 inhibitor was thought to be the best SERPIN candidate as a physiological regulator of Factor XIa in plasma. In addition to the SERPIN inhibitors, Factor XIa is also potently inhibited by protease nexin 2 (PN2),1 which refers to the subset of the several differentially spliced forms (including the 751-residue isoform) of the amyloid precursor protein (APP), which contain a kunitz-type inhibitor domain. Although the inhibition of Factor XIa by APP/PN2 is reversible, with a k onof 2 × 106m−1s−1 and a k off of 8.0 × 104m−1s−1, it is still a more efficient inhibitor of Factor XIa than any of the SERPIN inhibitors (15Van Nostrand W.E. Wagner S.L. Farrow J.S. Cunningham D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 9591-9594Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Van Nostrand W.E. Thromb. Res. 1995; 78: 43-53Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). In addition, thek on is improved by a factor of 20 in the presence of the heparin, probably through a template mechanism (17Zhang Y. Scandura J.M. Van Nostrand W.E. Walsh P.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26139-26144Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Since APP/PN2 is abundant in platelets, it was thought to be the most probable primary physiological inhibitor of Factor XIa in plasma (18Van Nostrand W.E. Schmaier A.H. Farrow J.S. Cunningham D.D. Science. 1990; 248: 745-748Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). In addition to being inhibited by APP/PN2, FXIa also proteolytically cleaves APP/PN2 within the RHDS sequence of the amyloid β-peptide sequence associated with Alzheimer's disease (19Saporito-Irwin S.M. Van Nostrand W.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26265-26269Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). This cleavage occurs at low nanomolar concentrations of FXIa, which are likely to be physiological. As a consequence, the cell adhesive activities of APP/PN2 as well as its neuro-protective activities are abolished (19Saporito-Irwin S.M. Van Nostrand W.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26265-26269Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Thus, the leakage of FXIa into extravascular spaces, especially in neuronal tissue, may have severe consequences. In the present studies we discovered that Factor XIa is potently inhibited by PN1, a member of the SERPIN family. While screening a peptide library for sequences that would inhibit the low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein (LRP)-mediated cellular uptake of125I-Factor XIa-APP/PN2 complexes, we observed a radioactive band on SDS-PAGE that was the right size for a complex between Factor XIa and PN1. Further investigation revealed that indeed this was a complex between proteolytically active Factor XIa and PN1 present in the conditioned media of cells used in the screening assay that were overexpressing APP/PN2. We proceeded to characterize the interaction between PN1 and Factor XIa for several reasons. First, the best plasma SERPIN inhibitor of Factor XIa, C1 inhibitor, has a relatively slow reaction rate, even in the presence of heparin (14Wuillemin W.A. Eldering E. Citarella F. de Ruig C.P. ten Cate H. Hack C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12913-12918Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Second, although PN1 is not as abundant as APP/PN2 in platelets (18Van Nostrand W.E. Schmaier A.H. Farrow J.S. Cunningham D.D. Science. 1990; 248: 745-748Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar), PN1 is clearly present on the platelet surface and in α granules and may contribute to FXIa inhibition in plasma (20Gronke R.S. Bergman B.L. Baker J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 3030-3036Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21Gronke R.S. Knauer D.J. Veeraraghavan S. Baker J.B. Blood. 1989; 73: 472-478Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Third, APP/PN2 and PN1 share Factor XIa as a target protease, and PN1 may play an important regulatory role by preventing the proteolytic cleavage of APP/PN2 by FXIa, which results in the loss of APP/PN2 biological activity as a cell adhesion promoter and neuro-protective agent. Fourth, both PN1 and APP/PN2 protease-inhibitor complexes are endocytosed via the LRP. The LRP and several of its ligands have been implicated as genetic factors in Alzheimer's disease (22Van Uden E.

Harr S.D. Strickland D.K. Hyman B.T. Ann. Neurol. 1995; 37: 211-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). Our studies demonstrate that Factor XIa inhibition by PN1 has aK assoc of 2.0 × 106m−1 s−1, making it a 10-fold faster inhibitor of Factor XIa than C1 inhibitor when both reactions are carried out in the presence of heparin. The inhibitory complexes consist of SDS, heat, and reducing agent-resistant complexes between the light chain of Factor XIa and PN1. Initial studies on human fibroblasts indicate that Factor XIa-PN1 complexes are internalized by the LRP and eventually degraded in lysosomes. These studies are the first to demonstrate that PN1 is a potent inhibitor of Factor XIa and suggest that extravasated Factor XIa may be another physiologically important target of PN1. Purified Factor XIa and unfractionated heparin (160 units/mg, with an average molecular mass of 12 kDA) were purchased from Calbiochem. Size-classed heparin (15 kDa) was purchased from Neoparin, Inc., CA. Human protease nexin 1 was purified from serum-free medium conditioned for 48 h by human fibroblasts as described previously (25Howard E.W. Knauer D.J. J. Cell.

All other common shelf reagents were from either Sigma or Calbiochem. After purification, PN1 was active site-titrated with thrombin using a chromogenic substrate as described previously (27Howard E.W. Knauer D.J. J. Biol.

Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE on 10% polyacrylamide gels and fixed in methanol:acetic acid:water (5:1:5). Gels were dried and exposed to a Bio-Rad phosphoimaging screen overnight. Digitized images were developed using a Bio-Rad GS-250 Molecular Imager. A stably transfected line of 293 cells overexpressing APP751 (designated 293/751+) were maintained and sub-cultured as described previously (28Yang A.J. Knauer M. Burdick D.A. Glabe C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14786-14792Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Human foreskin fibroblasts were also cultured as described previously (27Howard E.W. Knauer D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 684-689Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For cell culture experiments, both types of cells were trypsinized and re-grown to confluence in 24-well plates. Experimental cultures were grown in serum-free medium for at least 24 h. Enzymatic assays were conducted in Tyrode's buffer, pH 7.4, containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin (16Van Nostrand W.E. Thromb. Res. 1995; 78: 43-53Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The amount of Factor XIa was constant in all of the assays, 0.3 nm, as was the concentration of the synthetic fluorogenic substrate, Boc-EAR-AMC, 100 μm. Other additions varied depending on the particular experiment (see Fig.5). The assays were conducted in a final reaction volume of 2.0 ml at a regulated temperature of 37 °C with constant stirring. The change in relative fluorescence was monitored over a time course with a sampling interval of 10 s. The samples were excited at 375 nm, and the emission was quantified at 445 nm.K assoc constants were calculated as described previously (29Donovan F.M. Vaughan P.J. Cunningham D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17199-17205Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using the following equation.Kassoc=−ln[Et]/[E0][I]·tEquation 1 Confluent cultures of HF cells were incubated with 125I-Factor XIa-PN1 complexes at a concentration of 100 ng/ml in binding medium at 37 °C. Binding medium consisted of bicarbonate-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin buffered to pH 7.4 with 20 mm Hepes. Samples of the medium were withdrawn at hourly intervals for precipitation with 10% trichloroacetic acid. Trichloroacetic acid-soluble radioactivity (degraded125I-Factor XIa) was quantified using a γ counter (30Knauer M.F. Kridel S.J. Hawley S.B. Knauer D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29039-29045Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Parallel samples of binding reactions were incubated in the absence of cells to determine background that has been subtracted. In our recent studies we have shown that the heparin binding site in PN1 plays an important role in the cell-surface binding and catabolic rate of thrombin-PN1 complexes (30Knauer M.F. Kridel S.J. Hawley S.B. Knauer D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29039-29045Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The experiment shown in Fig.1 was originally designed to determine if one of the heparin binding sites in APP751/PN2 might analogously play a role in the catabolism of 125I-FXIa-APP751/PN2 complexes. In Fig. 1 A, a synthetic peptide (pep12) corresponding to one of the heparin binding sites in APP751/PN2 (residues 96–110) (31Small D.H. Nurcombe V. Reed G. Clarris H. Moir R. Beyreuther K. Masters C.L. J. Neurosci. 1994; 14: 2117-2127Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was tested for its ability to inhibit the catabolism of125I-FXIa-APP751/PN2 complexes by 293/751+ cells, a 293 cell line overexpressing APP751/PN2. As controls, the heparin-binding peptide from PN1 (residues 70–87), which has been shown to inhibit the catabolism of PN1-thrombin complexes, and GST-RAP, an LRP agonist, were also tested in parallel. 125I-FXIa was pre-incubated with serum-free 293/751+-conditioned medium to allow complexes to form. Each peptide was added at a final concentration of 50 μg/ml, and then the reaction mixtures were incubated with HF cells for 3 h at 37 °C. Aliquots of the medium were precipitated in 10% trichloroacetic acid to assay for increases in trichloroacetic acid soluble radioactivity (125I-FXIa degradation products, primarily iodo-tyrosine). The APP751/PN2 heparin-binding peptide, pep12, had no significant effect on the rate of 125I-FXIa degradation (Fig. 1 A). Unexpectedly, however, the degradation rate of 125I-FXIa was markedly reduced to approximately 7.5 fmol by the PN1 heparin-binding peptide. We hypothesized that these data might be explained by formation of complexes between 125I-FXIa and another protease inhibitor, potentially PN1, if 293/751+ cells also were making significant quantities of the other inhibitor. Indeed, subsequent SDS-PAGE analysis of the conditioned media incubated with 125I-FXIa before addition to the HF cells revealed the presence of two high molecular weight complex bands (Fig. 1 B). The larger of the complex bands had an expected size of approximately 98 kDa, which corresponds to the size of a complex formed between the light chain of FXIa and secreted APP751/PN2 (Fig. 1 B, lane 2). However, the lower band had not been previously characterized, and we suspected it could correspond to complexes between 125I-FXIa and another protease inhibitor secreted by the 293/751+ cells. PN1 was a likely candidate for the second inhibitor due to the size of the complexes in the lower band and the data in Fig. 1 A. To test this directly, 30 ng of purified PN1 were incubated with 30 ng of125I-FXIa at 37 °C and electrophoresed in a parallel lane (Fig. 1 B, lane 3). Indeed, higher molecular weight complexes formed between these purified components were observed in lane 3, and they co-migrated with the lower molecular weight band of complexes observed in 293/751+ cell-conditioned medium (lane 2). The observed size (71 kDa) of these complexes between purified PN1 and FXIa corresponds to the molecular mass of PN1 (43 kDa) added to the molecular mass of the catalytically active light chain of FXIa (28 kDa). The formation of an inhibitory complex between FXIa and PN1 has not been previously reported, and the presence of this inhibitory complex in the conditioned media of the 293/751+ cells explains the inhibitory effect of the PN1 heparin-binding peptide on Factor XIa catabolism in Fig. 1 A. In fact, the inhibitor effect observed in Fig. 1 A was due to the PN1 heparin-binding peptide specifically inhibiting the internalization and catabolism of 125I-FXIa that had formed complexes with endogenously produced PN1 in the 293/751+ cell-conditioned medium. Since it has not previously been shown that PN1 is able to form an inhibitory complex with FXIa, we next tested complex formation over a broad range of PN1 concentrations to establish the range for completeness and kinetics of the reaction. 125I-FXIa, at a concentration of 2.5 nm, was incubated with the indicated concentrations of PN1 for 15 min at 37 °C (Fig.2 A). The reactions were terminated by the addition of sample buffer and resolved by SDS-PAGE to separate free 125I-FXIa from 125I-FXIa·PN1 complexes. The light and heavy chains of FXIa are resolved under the reducing conditions of the sample buffer (1% mercaptoethanol) into bands of approximately 28 and 51 kDa. The catalytic reactivity of the FXIa resides solely in the light chain, and so, although it forms a higher molecular weight complex with PN1, approximately 70 kDa, the intensity of the heavy chain of FXIa, remains unchanged. Approximately 50% of the 125I-FXIa was in complex at a PN1 concentration of 13.2 nm, and the reaction was essentially complete at a PN1 concentration of 33 nm. These data clearly show a dose dependence of FXIa inhibition, and based on the molarity of PN1 and FXIa in the reactions, suggests a rapid association rate. The PN1 used in these experiments was active site-titrated against human thrombin, and the molarities of PN1 presented are based on the active PN1 fraction. The amount of PN1 required to achieve full complex formation was in excess to the FXIa in the reaction, and this may be due to several factors including partitioning between cleaved PN1 acting as a substrate for FXIa and PN1 in complex with FXIa. Since this could call into question the potential role of PN1 as a physiological inhibitor of FXIa, we next tested the inhibitory activity of PN1 toward Factor XIa in the presence of heparin, which is abundant in the physiological environment at endothelial cell surfaces and in the subintima. To address whether PN1 might act as a substrate for FXIa, we next performed the titration experiment in the presence of 50 nmfractionated heparin (20 kDa) with reaction conditions and PN1 concentrations adjusted appropriately (Fig. 2 B). We chose the 20-kDa size class of heparin based on its ability to act as a template for the acceleration of FXIa inhibition by APP/PN2 (17Zhang Y. Scandura J.M. Van Nostrand W.E. Walsh P.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26139-26144Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Importantly, these data show that at a PN1 concentration of 5 nm, nearly all of the FXIa was sequestered into a high molecular weight complex. Since each FXIa has two active sites for each 160,000 kDa dimer, then the number of active sites is also at 5.0 nm. Thus, when placed at equimolar concentrations in the presence of heparin, all of the FXIa and PN1 are partitioned into a high molecular weight complex. Although we cannot rule out that some of the PN1 might be cleaved non-productively by acting as a substrate for FXIa in the absence of heparin, this is clearly not the case in the presence of heparin. The data strongly suggest that PN1 may indeed act as a physiological inhibitor of FXIa. To test the stability of125I-FXIa-PN1 complexes, the experiment shown in Fig. 2 was repeated with 125I-FXIa at a final concentration of 2.5 nm and PN1 at 26 nm. This time the reaction was equally divided into four samples. Half of the samples received an equal volume of SDS-PAGE sample buffer without reducing agent, whereas the other received sample buffer with reducing agent. One of each sample type was then boiled for 2 min before electrophoresis, whereas the other was left at room temperature (Fig.3). As expected, in the absence of reducing agent, the complexes migrated at a molecular mass of 120 kDa, the mass of one 125I-FXIa subunit (80 kDa) plus the molecular mass of one PN1 molecule. Also as expected, in the presence of reducing agent, the complexes migrated as a stoichiometric complex with a molecular mass of 70 kDa, the mass of one 125I-FXIa light chain plus the mass of one PN1 molecule. Under both reducing and non-reducing conditions, the complexes were in an apparent stoichiometry of 1:1 and were stable to boiling. This strongly suggests a covalent linkage between the two. Whether this covalent linkage is due to an SDS-induced acyl-linked complex from a stable tetrahedral intermediate or is the natural progression of the reaction remains unresolved, as it does for all other SERPIN-protease complexes. Since complex formation between FXIa and APP751/PN2 is heparin-accelerated (17Zhang Y. Scandura J.M. Van Nostrand W.E. Walsh P.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26139-26144Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) and PN1 is a heparin-activated SERPIN, we tested whether size-classed 20-kDa heparin (which corresponds to 64 saccharide units) could also accelerate inhibitory complex formation between FXIa and PN1. The activation of PN1 by heparin toward thrombin, another PN1 cognate protease, has been reasonably well characterized (32Scott R.W. Bergman B.L. Bajpai A. Hersh R.T. Rodriguez H. Jones B.N. Barreda C. Watts S. Baker J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 7029-7034Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We bracketed the optimal heparin concentration for PN1 activation toward thrombin, to look for activation of PN1 toward FXIa. PN1 (5 nm) and125I-FXIa (2.5 nm) were reacted for 1 min at 37 °C in the presence of the indicated concentrations of fractionated heparin (Fig. 4). The reactions were terminated and analyzed for complex formation by SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions as described in Fig. 3. In the absence of heparin and at heparin concentrations of 5 nm and below, no complex formation was observed during the 1-min incubation. At a heparin concentration of 20 nm and above, complex formation was driven to completion during the 1-min incubation. This narrow window between 5 and 20 nm for heparin activation is characteristic of the high affinity heparin-mediated acceleration of SERPIN-protease complex formation (33Kridel S.J. Chan W.W. Knauer D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20935-20941Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the concentration-dependent heparin-activated reactions between PN1 and FXIa and between PN1 and thrombin (data not shown) display nearly identical profiles, and both peak at a heparin concentration between 5 and 25 nm. To more precisely determine the rate of the inhibitory reaction between PN1 and FXIa and to accurately measure the effect of heparin on the reaction rate, we employed a fluorometric assay using the fluorogenic substrate, Boc-EAR-AMC (17Zhang Y. Scandura J.M. Van Nostrand W.E. Walsh P.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26139-26144Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). At sub-micromolar concentrations of reactants, the simple equation Kassoc=−ln[E] t/[E] 0[I]·tEquation 2 provides a good measure of the association rate between PN1 and its target proteases (29Donovan F.M. Vaughan P.J. Cunningham D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17199-17205Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Factor X Ia (0.3 nm) and PN1 (6.6n m) were incubated for the indicated times at 37 °C in a reaction volume of 100μl of Tyrode's buffer. The reactions were then diluted to a final volume of 2.0 ml, and residual protease activity was measured by the addition of Boc-EAR-AMC. Shown in Fig. 5 A are the progression curves of Boc-EAR-AMC cleavage by residual FXI a proteolytic activity over a 400-s time interval after the indicated pre-incubation time in the absence of heparin. Cleavage was monitored by the relative fluorescence increase at 445 nm after excitation at 375 nm. Relative to controls, FXI a activity was decreased approximately 90% by a 40-min pre-incubation with PN1. At all time points the data were linear, and these slopes were used to calculateK assoc of PN1 for FXIa using each of the time points. The average K assoc of PN1 for FXIa, 0.08 × 106m−1s−1, is shown in TableI. Also shown in the table for comparison is the K assoc of C1 inhibitor with FXIa and theK on of the reversible inhibitor, APP/PN2, with FXIa.Table IHeparin acceleration of Factor XIa inhibition rates for reversible and irreversible inhibitorsInhibitor of Factor XIaRate constant K assoc10 6 M −1 s −1Irreversible PN10.08 ± 0.01 PN1 + heparin1.7 ± 0.2 C1 inhibitor0.0018 (14Wuillemin W.A.

Unfractionated heparin was intentionally used in these experiments, so that the rate constants obtained could be directly compared with other studies where the inhibitory activities of antithrombin III, C1 inhibitor, and antitrypsin toward FXIa were investigated (14Wuillemin W.A. Eldering E. Citarella F. de Ruig C.P. ten Cate H. Hack C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12913-12918Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). In the presence of heparin, FXIa inhibition was nearly 70% complete by 4 min, as compared with 40 min in the absence of heparin (Figs. 5, A and B). A plot ofV/V 0 versus time of pre-incubation of inhibitor with protease in the presence and absence of heparin is shown in Fig. 5 C to directly compare the data in panels A and B. This graph clearly demonstrates an approximate 20-fold acceleration in the rate of inhibition of FXIa by PN1 in the presence of heparin. When the K assoc was calculated using the same method as in panel A, we arrived at aK assoc of 1.72 ± 0.2 × 106m−1 s−1 in the presence of heparin (Table I). This represents a 20-fold increase in theK assoc of PN1 for FXIa in the presence of heparin. Table I also compares PN1 to C1 inhibitor, the best SERPIN inhibitor of FXIa characterized to date. Significantly, PN1 inhibits FXIa 20 times faster than C1 inhibitor in the presence of heparin, which is thought to be a physiological inhibitor of FXIa in plasma. For another comparison, PN1 is considered to be a physiological inhibitor of both plasmin and urokinase, with K assocconstants for these proteases of 0.13 × 106m−1 s−1 and 0.15 × 106m−1 s−1, respectively (32Scott R.W. Bergman B.L. Bajpai A. Hersh R.T. Rodriguez H. Jones B.N. Barreda C. Watts S. Baker J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 7029-7034Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and these constants are 10 times slower than theK assoc of PN1 for FXIa in the presence of heparin. It is also worth noting that the inhibition of neither urokinase nor plasmin by PN1 is accelerated by heparin (32Scott R.W. Bergman B.L. Bajpai A. Hersh R.T. Rodriguez H. Jones B.N. Barreda C. Watts S. Baker J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 7029-7034Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although the reversible inhibitor, APP/PN2, has a K on for FXIa 15 times faster than K assoc of PN1, the interaction is non-covalent and occurs through the kunitz domain in APP/PN2 (Table I). This is a conceptually important difference, since FXIa in complex with PN1 is part of a suicide reaction that is not reversible, whereas FXIa incomplex with APP/PN2 has the potential to regain its proteolytic activity. Since PN1 has been shown to be present on the surface of platelets, which is the preferred site of FXI activation, this raises the possibility that PN1 may act as a threshold modulator of FXIa (34Baglia F.A. Walsh P.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20514-20519Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Since the rationale underlying the present study is that PN1 may act as an important regulator of extravasated FXIa into tissues, then tissues should have an adequate mechanism for the catabolism of FXIa-PN1 inhibitory complexes. In the case of thrombin-PN1 and uPA-PN1 complexes, cellular internalization is mediated by the LRP (35Knauer M.F. Crisp R.J. Kridel S.J. Knauer D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 275-281Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 36Conese M. Olson D. Blasi F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17886-17892Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This results in the transport of the inhibitory complexes to the lysosomes, where they are degraded. To determine if 125I-FXIa-PN1 complexes were also internalized via the LRP, we conducted the degradation experiment shown in Fig.6. Confluent cultures of normal HF cells were incubated with 125I-FXIa-PN1 complexes (100 ng/ml) in the absence and in the presence of the LRP inhibitory protein, RAP. RAP blocks the binding of all known LRP ligands and is routinely used to assess the role of the LRP in the endocytosis of LRP ligands (37Herz J. Goldstein J.L. Strickland D.K. Ho Y.K. Brown M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 21232-21238Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). At the indicated times, samples were removed from the cultures and analyzed for the appearance of trichloroacetic acid-soluble radioactivity (low molecular mass iodo-tyrosine products resulting from125I-FXIa-PN1 complex degradation). By the 4-h time point the HF cells degraded approximately 75 fmol of the125I-FXIa-PN1 complexes in the absence of RAP. In the presence of RAP, complex degradation was reduced to 10 fmol over the same time period. Since HF cells have little or no very low density lipoprotein receptor (which is also inhibited by RAP), these data strongly suggest that 125I-FXIa-PN1 complex internalization by HF cells is LRP-dependent. Whether the LRP interacts with the FXIa or the PN1 moiety of the complex needs to be addressed in future studies. In the present studies we initiated a series of experiments designed to investigate the role of the heparin binding site in APP/PN2 in FXIa-PN2 complex internalization and catabolism. During the course of these studies, we observed that FXIa not in complex with APP/PN2, probably generated through the dissociation of FXIa-APP/PN2 complexes (17Zhang Y. Scandura J.M. Van Nostrand W.E. Walsh P.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26139-26144Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), formed complexes with cell-secreted PN1 that were stable to SDS-PAGE. The 70-kDa complexes formed between PN1 and FXIa were further characterized and found to be stable to SDS-PAGE after boiling in the presence of reducing agents. This suggests that the complexes most likely resemble classic 1:1 stoichiometric, covalent SERPIN-protease complexes. We decided to pursue the interaction between PN1 and FXIa for several reasons. First, the inhibitor that is considered to be most likely physiologically relevant for FXIa is APP/PN2, and that inhibitory complex is non-covalent and subject to dissociation. Second, the only other SERPINs that are known to inhibit FXIa with reasonable rate constants are C1 inhibitor and antithrombin III. In the absence of heparin, both of these could be described as relatively poor inhibitors (K assoc, 1.8 and 0.32 × 103m−1 s−1, respectively). And third, these SERPIN inhibitors are primarily restricted to plasma, which raises the question of how extravasated FXIa is handled physiologically. PN1, which is restricted primarily to tissues, might be a good candidate molecule to serve this function in extra-vascular spaces. In our more detailed kinetic studies on the interactions of FXIa with PN1 using the very sensitive fluorogenic substrate Boc-EAR-AMC, we determined the K assoc to be 7.9 ± 2.0 × 104m−1s−1. This is nearly equal to theK assoc of PN1 for urokinase, for which PN1 is believed to be a physiological inhibitor. Unlike urokinase, PN1 inhibition of FXIa is accelerated in the presence of heparin, and theK assoc was markedly enhanced to 1.7 × 106m−1s−1. This makes PN1 a 10-times faster inhibitor of FXIa than C1 inhibitor in the presence of heparin. It is important to note that PN1 is most likely to encounter FXIa in a heparin-rich environment past the boundaries of endothelial cells in a situation where vascular integrity has been lost. Thus, the present data suggest that PN1 may play a significant role in the regulation of activated FXI. It is also worth noting that in the presence of heparin, PN1 acts exclusively as an inhibitor of FXIa and not as a substrate. When the products of the heparin-accelerated inhibitory reaction were analyzed, there was no evidence that any PN1 was partitioned into a cleaved form not in complex with FXIa. In the data shown in Fig.2 B, an amount of PN1 equimolar to FXIa was sufficient to entrap all of the FXIa in a high molecular weight inhibitory complex. Finally, the present data suggest that PN1 may play an important physiological role in the regulation FXIa, which has been shown to proteolytically modify APP/PN2 and augment its biological activities. Factor XIa that escapes into nervous tissue has the potential to cleave the APP and, thus, abrogate its cell adhesion and neuroprotective and growth-promoting activities (17Zhang Y. Scandura J.M.

Given the abundance of PN1 in nervous tissue, it probably assumes the role of the primary inhibitor of FXIa under these conditions. Although the present data do not precisely explain the presence of PN1 in the brain, it places PN1 present at the site of β-peptide generation along with FXIa that can proteolytically process APP751/PN2, altering its biological activities. The potent inhibition of FXIa by PN1 suggests that PN1 may play an important protective role against FXIa proteolytic activity in tissues. It will be very interesting in future studies to examine the interaction of FXIa-PN1 complexes with cells of neuronal origin and to determine how the complexes might be metabolized in neuronal tissues."

Here, using a dominant-negative p85, we confirmed the key role of EGF-induced PI3-kinase activation and sought to identify the mechanism by which this is effected. Our results show that EGF activates PI3-kinase with a time course similar to that of the association of p85 with three principal phosphotyrosine proteins (i.e. PY180, PY105, and PY52). We demonstrated that each formed a distinct p85-associated complex. PY180 and PY52 each constituted about 10% of EGF-activated PI3-kinase, whereas PY105 was responsible for 80%. PY105 associated with Grb2 and SHP-2, and although it behaved like Gab1, none of the latter was detected in rat liver. We therefore cloned a cDNA from rat liver, which was found to be 95% homologous to the mouse Grb2-associated binder 2 (Gab2) cDNA sequence. Using a specific Gab2 antibody, we demonstrated its expression in and association with p85, SHP-2, and Grb2 upon EGF treatment of rat hepatocytes. Gab2 accounted for most if not all of the PY105 species, since immunoprecipitation of Gab2 with specific antibodies demonstrated parallel immunodepletion of Gab2 and PY105 from the residual supernatants. We also found that the PI3-kinase activity associated with Gab2 was totally abolished by dominant negative p85. Thus, Gab2 appears to be the principal EGF-induced PY protein recruiting and activating PI3-kinase and mitogenesis.

Gab2 accounted for most if not all of the PY105 species, since immunoprecipitation of Gab2 with specific antibodies demonstrated parallel immunodepletion of Gab2 and PY105 from the residual supernatants. We also found that the PI3-kinase activity associated with Gab2 was totally abolished by dominant negative p85. Thus, Gab2 appears to be the principal EGF-induced PY protein recruiting and activating PI3-kinase and mitogenesis. phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase epidermal growth factor EGF receptor Grb2-associated binder 1 and 2, respectively growth factor receptor bound 2 Src homology 2 domain-containing protein-tyrosine phosphatase-2 Src homology 2 and 3 domain, respectively polymerase chain reaction polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis insulin receptor substrate immunoprecipitation Western blot Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3-kinase)1 is an enzyme that phosphorylates the D-3 position of the inositol ring of PI to produce three novel phosphoinositides: phosphatidylinositol 3-monophosphate, phosphatidylinositol 3,4-biphosphate, and phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (1Auger K.R.

In the case of EGF, studies in different cell lines have identified several possible mechanisms leading to PI3-kinase activation. Thus, in mouse fibroblast cell line overexpressing human EGFR (NRHER5), immunoprecipitates of EGFR were shown to contain PI3-kinase activity (15Thompson D.M. Cochet C. Chambaz E.M. Gill G.N. J. Biol.

In A431 cells and MDA-MB-468 breast cancer cell lines, tyrosine-phosphorylated ErbB3, a member of the EGFR family, was implicated in the activation of PI3-kinase upon EGF stimulation (17Kim H.H.

The aim of this work was to clarify the mechanism of PI3-kinase activation following EGF stimulation of primary rat hepatocytes, a relevant physiological system. By overexpressing a dominant-negative p85, we confirmed the key role of PI3-kinase in EGF-induced DNA-synthesis. We next characterized three different p85-associated complexes generated by EGF treatment and identified Gab2 as a key molecule responsible for EGF-induced PI3-kinase activation in rat hepatocytes.

Bergeron (McGill University, Montreal). The pShuttle-CMV and pAdEasy-2 vectors were generously provided by Dr. Bert Vogelstein (Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Baltimore, MD). All other reagents were obtained from Sigma and were of the highest grade available. Previous work has shown that the p85 deletion mutant lacking the p110 binding site works as a dominant negative regulator for wild-type p85 in competing for upstream docking proteins (25Dhand R. Hara K. Hiles I. Bax B. Gout I. Panayotou G. Fry M.J. Yonezawa K. Kasuga M. Waterfield M.D. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 511-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). The mutant p85(Δ478–513) was constructed as described previously (25Dhand R. Hara K. Hiles I. Bax B. Gout I. Panayotou G. Fry M.J. Yonezawa K. Kasuga M. Waterfield M.D. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 511-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). Briefly, the 478–513 coding region, corresponding to the p110 binding domain, was deleted from the wild-type p85 (a generous gift from Dr. Thomas Franke, Columbia University, NY) using PCR. Two PCR fragments (P1 and P2) were generated. P1 encompassed nucleotides 1–1431 and had aBglII site introduced at the 5′-end. P2 encompassed nucleotides 1542–2172 and had 30 bases complementary to the 3′-end of P1 product introduced at the 5′-end. After purification, the two PCR fragments were mixed, denaturated, and reannealed. Using primers at each end, the mutated p85 was then reamplified by PCR and subcloned into pShuttle-CMV vector digested by BglII andEcoRV. The pShuttle-CMV-Δp85 plasmid was then mixed with pAdEasy-1 vector to prepare recombinant adenovirus as described previously (26He T.C. Zhou S. da Costa L.T., Yu, J. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2509-2514Crossref PubMed Scopus (3256) Google Scholar). Primary hepatocytes, isolated from 160–180-g male Harlan Sprague-Dawley rats (Charles River, St. Constant, Quebec, Canada) by in situ liver perfusion with collagenase (protocol 4110) approved by McGill), were plated on a collagen matrix (Vitrogen-100). Cultures were prepared by seeding 1 × 106 cells onto 9.6-cm2 × 6-well plates (Corning Costar Corp., Cambridge, MA) or seeding 5 × 106 cells onto 78-cm2 culture dishes (Starstedt Canada, St. Laurent, Quebec, Canada). Cells were bathed for 24 h in seeding medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/Ham's F-12 containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 10 mm Hepes, 20 mm NaHCO3, 500 IU/ml penicillin, and 500 μg/ml streptomycin) and then for 48 h in serum-free medium that differed from the seeding medium in that it lacked fetal bovine serum and contained 1.25 μg/ml Fungizone, 0.4 mm ornithine, 2.25 μg/ml l-lactic acid, 2.5 × 10−8 m selenium, and 1 × 10−8m ethanolamine. In some experiments, treatment with adenovirus was performed after cell attachment. Cells were infected with stocks of either recombinant (AdΔp85) or wild-type (AdΔE1/ΔE3) adenovirus for 4 h at 37 °C. After viral exposure, wild type and Δp85- infected cells were serum-starved for 20 h in serum-free medium. After viral exposure, wild type and Δp85-infected cells were serum-starved for 20 h in serum-free medium, and then 100 nm insulin or EGF and [3H]thymidine (5 μCi/ml) was added to the medium. After an 18-h incubation, cells were rinsed twice with 3 ml of cold phosphate-buffered saline, incubated for 15 min at 4 °C in 10% trichloroacetic acid, solubilized at room temperature in 1 ml of 1n NaOH, and then transferred to scintillation vials and counted for 3H. After treatment with the test agents for the time and concentration indicated in the figure legends, primary rat hepatocytes were rinsed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.4) and solubilized with lysis buffer (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 100 mm sodium fluoride, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 200 μm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10% glycerol, and 1% Triton X-100). Cell lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C, and protein concentrations in the resulting supernatants were determined using the Bio-Rad protein assay (27Khan M.N.

Lysates (500 μg of protein) from EGF-treated (100 nm EGF for 1 min) or nontreated cells were immunoprecipitated in the presence of protein A-Sepharose, using different antibodies as indicated in the figure legends (Figs. 5 and6). Immunoprecipitates were extensively washed, and the protein A-Sepharose pellets were resuspended in 50 μl of kinase assay buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm EGTA) containing 0.5 mg/mll-α-phosphatidylinositol (Avanti Polar Lipids, Inc., Alabaster, AL) and assayed for PI3-kinase activity as described previously (11Band C.J.

A, hepatocytes were treated with (+) or without (−) 100 nm EGF for 1 min. Proteins, immunoprecipitated with anti-Gab1 (αGab1) or anti-Gab2 (αGab2), were resolved on 7.5% SDS-PAGE and subjected to immunoblotting with αGab1 (top) or αGab2 (bottom). Lysate (20 μg of protein) from nonstimulated A431 or HeLa cells was a positive control (PC) for Gab1 or Gab2, respectively. B, proteins, immunoprecipitated with αGab2, were resolved on 10% SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with αTyr(P) (first panel), αp85 (second panel), αSHP-2 (third panel), or αGrb2 (fourth panel). C, lysates from EGF-treated cells were incubated with αGab2 (to effect immunodepletion) or with normal IgG as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The supernatants from these incubations were further incubated with (upper left panel) or without (upper right panel) αp85. The supernatants from this latter incubation along with the original supernatants were subjected to 7.5% SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblotting with αTyr(P) (upper left panel) or αGab2 (upper right panel). The bar graph (bottom panel) represents quantification of the upper bands. Control refers to the bands obtained from supernatants not immunoprecipitated with αGab2. The data are expressed as a percentage of control values obtained for each analysis (mean ± S.E., four separate experiments).

After centrifugation, the resulting supernatants were incubated for 2 h at 4 °C with the indicated antibody. Protein A-Sepharose was then added to each sample and incubated for an additional 1 h. The beads were collected by centrifugation, washed three times in lysis buffer, and boiled in Laemmli sample buffer. After separation on SDS-PAGE, immunoprecipitated proteins were transferred to Immobilon-P membranes (Millipore Ltd., Mississauga, Ontario, Canada). For immunoblotting, membranes were probed with the indicated first antibody for 90 min followed by a 1-h incubation with 125I- or horseradish peroxidase-labeled goat anti-rabbit IgG except for the use of anti-Tyr(P), where the second antibody was 125I- or horseradish peroxidase-labeled goat anti-mouse IgG. Immunoreactive proteins were detected by autoradiography or by the ECL system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Densitometric quantifications of the signals were performed using the Bio-Rad densitometer model GS-700. Lysates (500 μg of protein) from EGF-treated cells (100 nm EGF for 1 min) were precleared using rabbit IgG in the presence of protein A-Sepharose for 1 h at 4 °C. After centrifugation, the resulting supernatants were incubated overnight at 4 °C with the indicated antibody. Protein A-Sepharose was then added to each sample and incubated for an additional 1 h. After centrifugation, the immunodepleted supernatants were equally divided into two fractions. One fraction was immunoprecipitated in the presence of protein A-Sepharose with the antibody used for the immunodepletion. After separation on SDS-PAGE, immunoprecipitated proteins were transferred to Immobilon-P membranes and immunoblotted with the same antibody. The other fraction was immunoprecipitated with anti-p85 antibody in the presence of protein A-Sepharose, run on SDS-PAGE, transferred to membranes, and blotted with anti-Tyr(P) antibody. As control for nonimmunodepleted samples, lysates (150 μg of protein) from EGF-treated (100 nm EGF for 1 min) or nontreated cells were immunoprecipitated with anti-p85 antibody after preclearing with rabbit IgG. Immunoprecipitated proteins were then detected by immunoblot with anti-Tyr(P) antibody. PI3-kinase activated by growth factors, including insulin and EGF, has been implicated in DNA synthesis in various cell lines (28McIlroy J. Chen D. Wjasow C. Michaeli T. Backer J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 248-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). We have previously shown that the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase pathway regulates DNA synthesis in response to insulin and EGF in primary rat hepatocyte cultures by using PI3-kinase inhibitors, wortmannin and LY294002 (11Band C.J. Mounier C. Posner B.I. Endocrinology. 1999; 140: 5626-5634Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). To further confirm this result, we used a recombinant adenovirus containing a cDNA encoding the p85 regulatory subunit, whose p110 binding region was deleted (25Dhand R. Hara K. Hiles I. Bax B. Gout I. Panayotou G. Fry M.J. Yonezawa K. Kasuga M. Waterfield M.D. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 511-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar, 29Klippel A. Escobedo J.A. Hu Q. Williams L.T. Mol. Cell.

Chem. 1998; 273: 28025-28031Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Infection efficiency was assessed in cells transiently infected with recombinant adenovirus by measuring Δp85 expression using a p85 antibody (Fig.1 A, right). The average expression of p85 was increased 9.3 ± 2.7-fold (mean ± S.E.) in cells infected with Δp85 recombinant adenovirus compared with cells infected only with the wild-type adenovirus. The effect of Δp85 expression was, in accordance with our study using the PI3-kinase pharmaceutical inhibitors (11Band C.J. Mounier C. Posner B.I. Endocrinology. 1999; 140: 5626-5634Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), to inhibit completely basal as well as insulin- and EGF-stimulated DNA synthesis (Fig.1 B). This confirmed the critical role for PI3-kinase in mediating DNA synthesis in these cells. The mechanism by which insulin stimulates PI3-kinase activity is well known (12Backer J.M. Myers Jr M.G. Shoelson S.E. Chin D.J. Sun X.J. Miralpeix M. Hu P. Margolis B. Skolnik E.Y. Schlessinger J. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3469-3479Crossref PubMed Scopus (822) Google Scholar, 13Hadari Y.R. Tzahar E. Nadiv O.

Kadowaki T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5698-5701Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Since the mechanism for EGF is less clear, we sought to evaluate it in primary rat hepatocytes. Cells were stimulated at different times with 100 nm EGF, and tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins were immunoprecipitated using anti-Tyr(P) antibody (Fig.2 A). After immunoprecipitation, PI3-kinase activity (Fig. 2 A,solid circles) was measured as well as the amount of p85 protein (Fig. 2 A, open triangles) present in the Tyr(P) pellets. As shown, EGF augmented PI3-kinase activity in Tyr(P) immunoprecipitates and the association of p85 with particular PY proteins. The activation of PI3-kinase activity and the association of p85 with PY proteins were maximum at 30 s and then declined to basal levels by 10 min after EGF. To identify the PY proteins associated with p85, we subjected the immunoprecipitate generated with anti-p85 antibody to SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblotting with anti-Tyr(P) antibody as shown in Fig. 2 B. Following EGF stimulation, three major PY protein bands were evident at 180, 105, and 52 kDa (a minor band at 46-kDa was also seen) as indicated in Fig.2 B. The time course of p85 association with these PY proteins was assessed (Fig. 2 C). Our results show that the tyrosine phosphorylation of each band reached a maximum level at 30 s and then declined to basal level. Only the tyrosine phosphorylation of the 105-kDa protein (Fig. 2 C,middle) followed the same pattern as total EGF-induced PI3-kinase activity (anti-Tyr(P) (αPY) immunoprecipitates, Fig. 2 A) by declining to basal levels 10 min after exposure to EGF. These results demonstrate that EGF-induced PI3-kinase activation correlates with the association of p85 with three PY proteins, among which the one migrating at 105 kDa showed the best correlation. Using specific antibodies, we found that the PY180 species was largely accounted for by ErbB3, a member of the EGFR protein family (31Carver R.S. Sliwkowski M.X. Sitaric S. Russell W.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13491-13496Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), and that PY52 was accounted for by Shc, an adapter protein tyrosine-phosphorylated in response to EGF (32Ruff-Jamison S. McGlade S.J. Pawson T. Chen K. Cohen S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7610-7612Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 33Rozakis-Adcock M. McGlade J. Mbamalu G. Pelicci G. Daly R. Li W. Batzer A. Thomas S. Brugge J. Pelicci P.G. Nature. 1992; 360: 689-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (828) Google Scholar). Neither of these species associated with p105 (data not shown). Since the time course of tyrosine phosphorylation of p105 best correlated with the time course of EGF-induced PI-3 kinase activation (Fig. 2 C), we examined in detail the EGF-induced complex formed by p105 and p85 in primary rat hepatocytes. In agreement with an earlier report (34Takahashi Y. Akanuma Y. Yazaki Y. Kadowaki T. J. Cell. Physiol. 1999; 178: 69-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar), we found that the association of SHP-2 with p85 increased 4–5-fold after EGF stimulation (Fig. 3 A,top and bottom, compare lanes 3 and4). Interestingly, we also found that SHP-2 associated with EGFR (top panel, lanes 5 and 6) but not with ErbB3 (top panel, lanes 1 and2). Since SHP-2 associated with p85, we determined if it was part of the complex formed by p85 and p105 by assessing which EGF-induced PY proteins are present in SHP-2 immunoprecipitates. Following EGF treatment (Fig. 3 B, lane 4) four PY proteins were detected in SHP-2 immunoprecipitates with molecular masses of ∼180, 105, 67, and 52 kDa. It is clear that SHP-2 associates with the EGFR (Fig. 3 A, lanes 5 and6). The band detected at 180 kDa in the SHP-2 immunoprecipitates (Fig. 3 B, lane 4) thus corresponds to PY-EGFR. The 67-kDa protein corresponds to PY-SHP-2 (data not shown), which was not readily detected in p85 immunoprecipitates (Fig. 3 B, lane 2) due to the smaller quantity of SHP-2 present in the latter than in SHP-2 immunoprecipitates (Fig. 3 A, compare top,lanes 7 and 8, with bottom, lanes 3and 4). A band migrating at 105 kDa, as in anti-p85 immunoprecipitates, is observed in both control and EGF-stimulated hepatocytes (compare lane 2 with lanes 3 and4). Since SHP-2 associates with Shc upon EGF treatment of hepatocytes (data not shown), the 52-kDa protein is probably PY-Shc. The association of SHP-2 with the 105-kDa protein led us to determine whether this protein was the same p105 as that associated with p85. We therefore immunodepleted SHP-2 molecules by preadsorbing lysates from EGF-treated cells with SHP-2 antibody and then tested for the presence of PY-p105 in anti-p85 immunoprecipitates. The efficiency of the SHP-2 immunodepletion was confirmed by demonstrating the full removal of SHP-2 proteins from the supernatant of SHP-2 immunoprecipitates (Fig. 3 C, top). Using the immunodepleted SHP-2 supernatants (Fig. 3 C,bottom), we showed that after anti-p85 immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting with Tyr(P) antibody, the intensity of the p105 band decreased to essentially the same level as observed in lysates from control nonimmunodepleted cells (compare Basal and SN lanes). It is of interest to note that the intensities of the 180-kDa (ErbB3) and 52-kDa (Shc) bands were not affected by the SHP-2 immunodepletion. These results demonstrate that in primary rat hepatocytes, EGF treatment affects the association of p85 with SHP-2 and p105. EGF has been shown to induce the coupling of SHP-2 to Grb2 via the COOH-terminal SH3 domain of Grb2 (35Wong L. Johnson G.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20981-20984Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). In addition, a direct association of Grb2 and p85, mediated by the SH3 domains of Grb2 and the proline-rich motifs of p85, has also been reported (36Wang J. Auger K.R. Jarvis L. Shi Y. Roberts T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12774-12780Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). We therefore evaluated the extent of Grb2 association with SHP-2 and p85. Lysates from control and EGF-stimulated cells were immunoprecipitated with anti-Grb2 antibody and subjected to anti-SHP-2, anti-p85, and anti-Grb2 immunoblotting. Grb2 was shown to associate with SHP-2 (Fig.4 A, top) and p85 (Fig. 4 A, middle), and this was increased following EGF stimulation. These results indicated that Grb2 might engage in the complex of p85 with SHP-2 and p105. We thus assessed which PY proteins are present in Grb2 immunoprecipitates after EGF treatment. With anti-Tyr(P) immunoblotting we detected four Tyr(P) bands (Fig. 4 B, lane 4), and identified the 180-kDa protein as PY-EGFR, the 67-kDa protein as PY-SHP-2, and the 52- and 46-kDa proteins as PY-Shc (data not shown). A PY protein, migrating at 105 kDa, was also detected in Grb2 immunoprecipitates of lysate from EGF-stimulated cells. Immunodepletion of Grb2 from the lysates was performed to determine if the p105 protein present in the anti-p85 immunoprecipitates was the same as that associated with Grb2. As with the SHP-2 study, the efficiency of the immunod"
https://openalex.org/W1981731457,"The role of the Gla domain of human prothrombin in interaction with the prothrombinase complex was studied using a peptide with the sequence of the first 46 residues of human prothrombin, PT-(1–46). Intrinsic fluorescence measurements showed that PT-(1–46) undergoes a conformational alteration upon binding calcium; this conclusion is supported by one-dimensional1H NMR spectroscopy, which identifies a change in the chemical environment of tryptophan 41. PT-(1–46) binds phospholipid membranes in a calcium-dependent manner with aK d of 0.5 μm and inhibits thrombin generation by the prothrombinase complex with a K iof 0.8 μm. In the absence of phospholipid membranes, PT-(1–46) inhibits thrombin generation by factor Xa in the presence but not absence of factor Va, suggesting that PT-(1–46) inhibits prothrombin-factor Va binding. The addition of factor Va to PT-(1–46) labeled with the fluorophore sulfosuccinimidyl-7-amino-4-methylcoumarin-3-acetic acid (PT-(1–46)AMCA) caused a concentration-dependent quenching of AMCA fluorescence, providing direct evidence of a PT-(1–46)-factor Va interaction. The K d for this interaction was 1.3 μm. These results indicate that the N-terminal Gla domain of human prothrombin is a functional unit that has a binding site for factor Va. The prothrombin Gla domain is important for interaction of the substrate with the prothrombinase complex.

Prothrombin is activated to thrombin by the enzyme factor Xa in the presence of phospholipid membranes and factor Va. Although factor Xa is able to convert prothrombin to thrombin in solution, the presence of phospholipid membranes and factor Va results in a 100,000-fold acceleration in thrombin generation allowing this enzymatic reaction to proceed at a physiologically relevant rate (1Rosing J. Tans G. Govers-Riemslag J.W. Zwaal R.F. Hemker H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 274-283Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Phospholipid membranes decrease the apparent K m of factor Xa for prothrombin approximately 100-fold, and factor Va increases the k cat of factor Xa for prothrombin approximately 3000-fold (1Rosing J. Tans G. Govers-Riemslag J.W. Zwaal R.F. Hemker H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 274-283Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Prothrombin is composed of five domains; an N-terminal γ-carboxyglutamic acid (Gla)1 domain, an aromatic amino acid stack domain, two kringle domains, and a C-terminal serine protease domain. The N-terminal Gla domain contains 10 Gla residues that are responsible for the calcium binding properties of prothrombin. The Gla domain defines the binding of vitamin K-dependent proteins to phospholipid membranes (for review, see Refs. 2Furie B. Furie B.C. Cell. 1988; 53: 505-518Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (998) Google Scholar and 3Furie B. Furie B.C. N. Engl. J. Med. 1992; 326: 800-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar). Upon binding calcium ions, prothrombin undergoes two sequential conformational alterations, one can be detected spectroscopically (4Nelsestuen G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 5648-5656Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and both can be detected with conformation-specific antibodies (5Furie B. Furie B.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 9766-9771Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The second conformational change, which is supported only by calcium or strontium ions, is necessary to allow prothrombin to bind phospholipid membranes (6Borowski M. Furie B.C. Bauminger S. Furie B. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 14969-14975Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The crystal structure of bovine prothrombin fragment 1, which comprises the Gla, aromatic amino acid stack, and first kringle domains, has been solved both in the absence (7Seshadri T.P. Tulinsky A. Skrzypczak-Jankun E. Park C.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 220: 481-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) and presence of calcium ions (8Soriano-Garcia M. Padmanabhan K. de Vos A.M. Tulinsky A. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 2554-2566Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). The latter structure demonstrates that five calcium ions are chelated by six Gla residues (Gla7, Gla8, Gla17, Gla26, Gla27, Gla30), rendering 4 of the calcium residues inaccessible to solvent. Two additional calcium ions are bound to Gla residues 15, 20, and 21, and remain exposed to solvent. The sequestration of calcium ions in the interior of the protein results in the burying of the N-terminal alanine and contributes to the structural stability of the amino-terminal domain (8Soriano-Garcia M. Padmanabhan K. de Vos A.M. Tulinsky A. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 2554-2566Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). In human prothrombin, site-directed mutagenesis studies demonstrate that Gla16, Gla26, and Gla29 (equivalent to Gla15, Gla27, and Gla30 in bovine prothrombin) are critical for phospholipid binding (9Ratcliffe J.V. Furie B. Furie B.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24339-24345Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The Gla domain of the vitamin K-dependent proteins serves functions in addition to mediating phospholipid binding. A mutation in the Gla domain of factor IX (Gly12 → Arg) results in defective activation of factor X by the complete tenase complex in the presence but not absence of factor VIIIa (10Larson P.J. Stanfield-Oakley S.A. VanDusen W.J. Kasper C.K. Smith K.J. Monroe D.M. High K.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3869-3876Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). A mutation in tissue factor, the cofactor of factor VIIa, results in defective activation of factor X but not Gla-domainless factor X by the factor VIIa-tissue factor complex (11Huang Q. Neuenschwander P.F. Rezaie A.R. Morrissey J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21752-21757Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Furthermore, computational protein-protein docking analysis of the factor VIIa-tissue factor-factor Xa complex suggests interactive sites between the Gla domain of factor Xa and tissue factor-factor VIIa (12Ruf W. Shobe J. Rao S.M. Dickinson C.D. Olson A. Edgington T.S. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 1957-1966Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Although the N-terminal 12 residues of the Gla domain are important for phospholipid binding (13Freedman S.J. Blostein M.D. Baleja J.D. Jacobs M. Furie B.C. Furie B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16227-16236Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar), the C-terminal region of the Gla domain may be involved in protein-protein interactions. A chimeric protein C molecule in which the Gla domain of the protein was replaced with the corresponding region of prothrombin renders activated protein C activity independent of its cofactor, protein S. This suggests that the Gla domain of protein C is required for protein S cofactor activity. This protein S-independent activity has been localized to residues 23–46 of the Gla domain of protein C (14Smirnov M.D. Safa O. Regan L. Mather T. Stearns-Kurosawa D.J. Kurosawa S. Rezaie A.R.

J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5462-5468Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Domains within prothrombin that have been shown to bind to factor Va include the kringle 2 domain (16Kotkow K.J. Deitcher S.R. Furie B. Furie B.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4551-4557Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) and the kringle 1 domain (17Deguchi H. Takeya H. Gabazza E.C. Nishioka J. Suzuki K. Biochem. J. 1997; 321(Pt 3): 729-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). However, the Gla domain of prothrombin may be important for factor Va binding when these proteins are assembled on membranes. Such a hypothesis is consistent with factor Va and prothrombin interacting through several contact sites located in different domains. This paradigm has been demonstrated in the factor VIIa-tissue factor complex, in which the crystal structure identifies multiple interactive sites between the two proteins, including a hydrophobic interaction between the C-terminal helix of the Gla domain of factor VIIa and the second fibronectin domain of tissue factor (18Banner D.W. D'Arcy A. Chene C. Winkler F.K. Guha A. Konigsberg W.H. Nemerson Y. Kirchhofer D. Nature. 1996; 380: 41-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (691) Google Scholar). To gain insight into the structure/function relationships of the Gla domain of prothrombin, we have synthesized and characterized the properties of a peptide comprising the Gla and aromatic amino acid stack domains of human prothrombin. The results demonstrate that this peptide binds calcium, binds to phospholipid membranes, and inhibits the prothrombinase complex. Using this synthetic Gla domain, we demonstrate a direct interaction between the Gla domain of human prothrombin and factor Va. Human prothrombin, human factor IXa, human factor Xa, and human factor Va were purchased from Hematologic Technologies. Chromogenic substrate S-2238 was purchased from Diapharma Group Inc. Phosphatidylserine and phosphatidylcholine were obtained from Avanti Polar Lipids. Sulfosuccinimidyl-7-amino-4-methylcoumarin-3-acetic acid (AMCA) was purchased from Pierce. Rabbit IgG was purchased from Sigma. PT-(1–46) was synthesized as described previously for factor IX-(1–47) (19Jacobs M. Freedman S.J. Furie B.C. Furie B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25494-25501Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with the following modifications. The cleavage reaction was performed in trifluoroacetic acid/1,2-ethanedithiol/thioanisole/water/phenol (10:2.5:5:5:5, v/v) for 5 h at 25 °C. An intramolecular disulfide bond was formed by dialyzing the crude peptide (2 mg/ml) against 4 liters of 50 mm ammonium bicarbonate, pH 8.0. at 25 °C for 24 h. Following oxidation, solvent was removed from crude peptide by lyophilization. The crude, oxidized and deprotected peptide was purified by HPLC using an RP C18 column (Vydac, 250 × 21.5 mm). A linear gradient from 30 to 45% Buffer B (Buffer A: 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, water; Buffer B: 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, acetonitrile) over 60 min was employed. The column eluate was monitored at 214 nm and 280 nm. The amino acid sequence of the purified peptide was verified using an ABI Procise model 491 protein sequencer. The molecular mass of the peptide was determined by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry on a Voyager linear MALDI-TOF spectrometer (PerSeptive Biosystems). The mass spectrometry analysis was performed with a nitrogen laser at 337 nm, employing either linear mode-positive or -negative ionizations. Amino acid analysis was performed on an acid hydrolysate using a Picotag system (Waters). The percentage of free sulfhydryl groups remaining on PT-(1–46) after oxidation was determined by an Ellman assay (20Ellman G.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1959; 82: 70-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (21762) Google Scholar). PT-(1–46) was dialyzed into 0.1 m sodium phosphate, pH 8.0, added to 1.8 mm 5,5′-dithio-bis(2-nitrobenzoic acid), and product formation was assayed by measuring the absorption at 412 nm using modified l-cysteine as a standard. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was performed under non-reducing and reducing conditions according to Schagger and von Jagow (21Schagger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10527) Google Scholar). The peptides were visualized with Coomassie Blue. Small unilamellar phospholipid vesicles (PC:PS, 60:40) were prepared by the method of Barenholz (22Barenholz Y. Gibbes D. Litman B.J. Goll J. Thompson T.E. Carlson R.D. Biochemistry. 1977; 16: 2806-2810Crossref PubMed Scopus (730) Google Scholar). Phospholipids in chloroform were dried at 45 °C under N2, washed three times with methylene chloride, resuspended in 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, and sonicated in a bath sonicator until the solution cleared. The suspension of phospholipid vesicles was centrifuged, first at 160,000 × g for 30 min and then at 250,000 ×g for 90 min in a Beckman L8–80M ultracentrifuge using a Ti70.1 rotor. The supernatant contained the small unilamellar phospholipid vesicles. Phospholipid concentrations were determined by phosphorus analysis (23Chen P.S. Toribara T.Y. Warner H. Anal. Chem. 1956; 28: 1756-1758Crossref Scopus (5840) Google Scholar). The binding of PT-(1–46) to phospholipid vesicles was evaluated by 90° light scatter according to the method of Nelsestuen and Lim (24Nelsestuen G.L. Lim T.K. Biochemistry. 1977; 16: 4164-4171Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar) on an SLM 8000C fluorescence spectrophotometer. The peptide was dissolved in 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 2 mm CaCl2. Aliquots of the peptide were added to 3 ml of buffer containing 9.4 μm small unilamellar phospholipid vesicles (PC:PS, 60:40) to achieve the final peptide concentration shown. The sample was excited at a wavelength of 320 nm with a slit width of 4 nm, and emission was monitored at a wavelength of 320 nm with a slit width of 16 nm. Dissociation constants were calculated according to the equations of Lim et al.(24Nelsestuen G.L. Lim T.K. Biochemistry. 1977; 16: 4164-4171Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar):(I/Io) 1/2=M2/M1Equation 1 where I is the scatter intensity of phospholipid plus protein corrected for increases in scatter intensity due to the protein itself. Io is the scatter intensity of phospholipid alone corrected for the decrease in intensity due to dilution with each addition of protein, and M2/M1 is the molecular weight ratio of the protein-phospholipid vesicle complex to phospholipid vesicles alone. The light scattering signal is related to the proportion of binding sites occupied by PT-(1–46):M2M1−1MsatM1−1=[PT­(1–46):PLn][PLt/n]Equation 2 where PT-(1–46):PL n is the concentration of phospholipid binding sites occupied by peptide,PL t is the total concentration (μm) of phospholipid, and n is the number of phospholipid monomers per binding site. Msat/M1is the signal due to light scattering of PT-(1–46) bound to phospholipid when all the binding sites for PT-(1–46) are occupied. Dissociation constants were calculated using a simple bimolecular model analogous to that used by Gilbert et al. (25Gilbert G.E. Furie B.C. Furie B. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 815-822Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar):M2M1=MsatM1−1Equation 3 Kd+[PT­(1–46) t]+[PLt/n]−(Kd+[PT­(1–46) t]+[PLt/n]) 2−4[PT­(1–46) t][PLt/n]2[PLt/n]+1 The initial value of M2/M1 is adjusted to zero by subtraction of 1. Msat/M1 is similarly normalized. PT-(1–46)t is the total concentration (μm) of peptide. The equilibrium binding constant,K d, was determined by fitting the light scattering data to the above equation using non-linear regression analyses with SigmaPlot for Windows 4.0 (SPSS). Fluorescence quenching experiments were performed at 25 °C using an SLM 8000C fluorescence spectrophotometer. PT-(1–46) (4.4 μm) was dissolved in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, previously treated with Chelex 100. The sample was irradiated at 280 nm using a slit width of 4 nm, and the emission was monitored at 340 nm using a slit width of 16 nm. The titrations were performed by the addition of CaCl2 to the final concentration indicated (26Nelsestuen G.L. Broderius M. Zytkovicz T.H. Howard J.B. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1975; 65: 233-240Google Scholar). At the completion of titration, the reversibility of metal-induced quenching was tested by the addition of EDTA. The NMR sample contained 0.15 mm PT-(1–46) in 100 mm d 4-acetate, 1 m NaCl, at pH 5.5 with 10% D2O as the deuterium lock signal. Prior to the CaCl2 titration, this sample was heated to approximately 50 °C at a neutral pH of 7.0 in the presence of Chelex 100 to ensure that all trace metal ions were removed. Spectra were collected on a Bruker AMX-500 spectrometer with a proton frequency of 500.14 MHz. One-dimensional spectra were acquired at 25 °C with 16,000 real data points, 2,048 summed scans, and a spectral width of 12,045.1 Hz. Following data acquisition, each spectrum was processed by applying a squared sine bell window function shifted by 30°. The carrier frequency was set on the water resonance, which was suppressed using presaturation. The prothrombinase assay was a modification of that of Rosing et al. (1Rosing J. Tans G. Govers-Riemslag J.W. Zwaal R.F. Hemker H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 274-283Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The assay was performed in Titretek (ICN Biomedicals Inc., Aurora) microtiter plates at 25 °C. The reaction mixture (40 μl) contained 0.1 nm factor Xa, 5 nm factor Va, 1.25 μm phospholipid vesicles (PC:PS, 60:40), and varying concentrations of PT-(1–46) in 150 mm NaCl, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 2 mm CaCl2, and 0.1% bovine serum albumin. The reaction was initiated by the addition of 20 μl of prothrombin (final concentration, 300 nm) and stopped 60 s later by adding 20 μl of buffer containing 150 mm NaCl, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 20 mmEDTA, and 0.1% bovine serum albumin. Thrombin activity was measured at 25 °C using the chromogenic substrate S-2238 (0.25 mg/ml) on a Molecular Devices enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay plate reader. For assays performed in the absence of phospholipid membranes, the concentration of factor Xa was 1.7 nm when factor Va (1.56 nm) was present and factor Xa was 5 nm when factor Va was omitted. The concentration of prothrombin was 300 nm for both conditions. The reaction was stopped after 60 min. For assays performed in the absence of factor Va but in the presence of phospholipid membranes, the reaction time was 5 min. Reactant concentrations were 1 nm factor Xa, 1.25 μm phospholipid vesicles, and 300 nmprothrombin. The K i for PT-(1–46) inhibition of prothrombin activation by prothrombinase was determined graphically using the method of Dixon (27Dixon M. Webb E.C. Enzymes. Second Ed. Academic Press, New York1964Google Scholar). Reactions were performed with 0.1 nmfactor Xa, 5 nm factor Va, 1.25 μmphospholipid vesicles at three different concentrations of prothrombin, namely, 50, 75, and 100 nm in the presence of varying concentrations of PT-(1–46) as indicated. A K i for PT-(1–46) inhibition of factor Xa (1 nm) activation of prothrombin in the absence of factor Va was calculated in a similar fashion except the concentrations of prothrombin were 100, 400, and 800 nm and phospholipid vesicles were 1.25 μm. AK i for PT-(1–46) inhibition of factor Xa (5 nm) activation of prothrombin in the absence of phospholipid membranes was also determined. Reactant concentrations were 5 nm factor Xa, 25 nm factor Va, and 150, 300, or 450 nm prothrombin. To label PT-(1–46) with AMCA-Sulfo-N-hydroxysuccinimide, 100 μg of peptide was dissolved in 200 μl of 150 mm NaCl, 50 mmsodium borate, pH 8.5, and 1 mm CaCl2. AMCA (10 μl, 0.67 mg/ml in water) was added, and the mixture was incubated at 25 °C for 60 min shielded from light. The reaction was stopped with 100 μl of 0.2 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, and the resulting product was dialyzed against Tris-buffered saline, pH 7.4, to remove any free AMCA. PT-(1–46)AMCA (150 μg) in 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, was added to a gel filtration column (D-Salt Extracellulose Desalting Column from Pierce, molecular weight cutoff 5000) and eluted with 150 mm NaCl, 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.4. Fractions (0.5 ml) were collected, and the absorbance at 340 nm was measured. After labeling and dialysis, PT-(1–46)AMCA was subjected to analytical HPLC on a C18 column (Vydac, 2.2 × 25 cm) employing a linear gradient of 35–45% Buffer B (buffer A: 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, water; Buffer B: 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid acetonitrile) over 30 min. Peaks were detected with a fluorescence detector (Beckman) using an excitation wavelength of 350 nm and an emission wavelength of 450 nm. Collected peaks were analyzed by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry on a Voyager linear MALDI-TOF spectrometer. Binding of factor Va to PT-(1–46)AMCA was monitored by quenching of AMCA fluorescence upon addition of factor Va using a Photon Technology International fluorescence spectrophotometer (Barnegat, NJ). The excitation wavelength was 350 nm with a slit width of 1 nm; emission scans were monitored from 400 to 500 nm with a slit width of 8 nm. Aliquots of factor Va in Tris-buffered saline, pH 7.4, 2 mmCaCl2, 0.001% Tween 80 were added to 0.1 μmPT-(1–46)AMCA in the same buffer. Correction was made for changes in fluorescence signal due to the addition of buffer alone. Factor Va was added in aliquots of 0.25–0.5 μm up to a concentration of 3 μm. At the end of the titration, excess unlabeled PT-(1–46) was added to assess the reversibility of the fluorescence change. As a negative control, rabbit IgG was added to 0.1 μm PT-(1–46) up to a concentration of 3 μM. The binding affinity of factor Va for PT-(1–46) was calculated from fluorescence quenching data using a bimolecular equilibrium model as described previously (28Croce K. Freedman S.J. Furie B.C. Furie B. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 16472-16480Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). A peptide consisting of the γ-carboxylated N-terminal 46 residues of human prothrombin, PT-(1–46), was synthesized by solid phase peptide synthesis usingN-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl/N-methylpyrrolidone chemistry (Fig. 1). Following synthesis, the peptide was air-oxidized at pH 8.0 at room temperature for 24 h and purified using reverse phase HPLC. Automated Edman degradation revealed that the synthetic peptide had the correct sequence; amino acid analysis also confirmed the expected amino acid composition of the peptide. The peptide had the expected decarboxylated molecular mass of 5268 daltons (decarboxylation occurs during ionization) determined by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry in linear mode-negative ionization. An Ellman assay for free sulfhydryls of the oxidized, purified peptide revealed that the molar ratio of cysteine to half-cystine was less than 10%. The purified peptide was subjected to SDS-gel electrophoresis in the presence and absence of 10% β-mercaptoethanol. A single band migrating with a molecular weight of about 6000 was visible in the oxidized form of the peptide, confirming that dimerization or multimerization had not occurred during disulfide bond formation (Fig.2). To determine whether PT-(1–46) undergoes a conformational alteration upon binding calcium ions, we measured the effect of increasing CaCl2 concentration on PT-(1–46) intrinsic fluorescence. When irradiated at a wavelength of 280 nm, PT-(1–46) has an emission maximum at 340 nm. The single tryptophan residue at position 41 accounts for this intrinsic fluorescence. The intrinsic fluorescence of PT-(1–46) was quenched with increasing CaCl2concentration, reaching a maximal quenching of 55% (Fig.3). Half-maximal quenching was observed at 0.2 mm CaCl2. This effect was reversed by addition of EDTA. These results indicate that PT-(1–46) undergoes a change in its tertiary structure upon binding calcium ions, similar to that observed with factor IX-(1–47) (19Jacobs M. Freedman S.J. Furie B.C. Furie B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25494-25501Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), prothrombin fragment 1 (29Prendergast F.G. Mann K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 840-850Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and prothrombin (4Nelsestuen G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 5648-5656Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The calcium-induced structural perturbation of PT-(1–46) was assessed using one-dimensional 1H NMR spectroscopy (Fig.4). The peptide was initially rendered metal-free using Chelex 100. The proton resonances associated with the metal-free conformer of PT-(1–46) suggest that the peptide is partially structured, with the spectral dispersion associated with the amide protons shifted by greater that 0.15 parts per million (ppm) from their random coil values (30Wuthrich K. NMR of Proteins and Nucleic Acids. J. Wiley and Sons, New York1986Crossref Google Scholar). However, the γ-protons associated with the malonate-like side chains of the 10 Gla residues were spectrally degenerate within a limited frequency envelope in this metal-free conformer (data not shown). To assess the ability of the peptide to bind calcium ions, a series of one-dimensional spectra were collected at increasing molar equivalents of CaCl2 to peptide. Following the addition of CaCl2, the proton frequencies showed increased spectral dispersion in all regions of the spectrum, including the amide proton region (Fig. 4). Many of the amide protons were shifted downfield (>0.25 ppm), the γ-protons became spectrally dispersed, and many of the α-protons were shifted upfield from their random coil values indicative of increased helical structure at concentrations of calcium ions in excess of 40 equivalents (30Wuthrich K. NMR of Proteins and Nucleic Acids. J. Wiley and Sons, New York1986Crossref Google Scholar, 31Wishart D.S. Sykes B.D. Richards F.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 222: 311-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (1794) Google Scholar). The presence of two resonances for the indole proton (Nε1) of tryptophan 41 (9.9 and 10.1 ppm) in the one-dimensional spectra illustrates that the metal-free and calcium-induced structures are in slow exchange on the NMR time scale. The metal-free resonance remains sharp, suggesting that the correlation time (τc) of this conformer is shorter. The calcium-induced resonance is shifted upfield and broadened, identifying the presence of a new structure that places the tryptophan moiety in an altered chemical environment. At elevated calcium ion concentrations, this resonance broadens due to self-aggregation of the peptide. We determined that PT-(1–46) binds to phospholipid membranes in a calcium-dependent manner analogous to prothrombin. Binding was measured by the relative 90° light scattering technique. When increasing amounts of PT-(1–46) were added to phospholipid vesicles (PC:PS, 60:40) in the presence of 2 mm CaCl2,saturable binding was observed (Fig. 5). A dissociation constant, K d, of 0.5 ± 0.2 μm with an n value of 50 phospholipid monomers per binding site was calculated by fitting the data to a bimolecular equilibrium model. The binding was reversible following the addition of excess EDTA. When PT-(1–46) was incubated with prothrombinase in the presence of the substrate prothrombin, thrombin generation was inhibited. Thrombin generation was inhibited 70% at a concentration of 40 μmPT-(1–46). Higher concentrations of peptide could not be tested due to aggregation (Fig. 6 A). PT-(1–46) inhibition of prothrombin activation by prothrombinase fits a model of competitive inhibition. A K i of 0.8 μm was measured (Fig. 6 B). To further elucidate the mechanism by which PT-(1–46) inhibits prothrombin activation, the ability of PT-(1–46) to inhibit prothrombin cleavage by factor Xa in the presence of phospholipid membranes and absence of factor Va was measured. The K i for inhibition of prothrombin activation under these conditions was 2.0 ± 0.5 μm, similar to the K i of inhibition for the prothrombinase complex (Fig.7).Figure 7PT-(1–46) inhibition of thrombin generation on phospholipid membranes. PT-(1–46), at the indicated concentrations, was incubated with 1 nm factor Xa and 1.25 μm phospholipid membranes in 150 mm NaCl, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 2 mm CaCl2 at 25 °C.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To test our hypothesis that the Gla domain of prothrombin, in addition to binding to phospholipid membranes, binds directly to factor Va, we assessed the ability of PT-(1–46) to inhibit prothrombin activation by factor Xa and factor Va in the absence of phospholipid. As indicated in Fig. 8, PT-(1–46) inhibits at least 70% of the thrombin generation in the absence of phospholipid membranes and in the presence of factor Va. A K i of 14.9 ± 1 μm was determined for inhibition of this reaction by PT-(1–46). In the absence of both phospholipid membranes and factor Va, no inhibition was observed (Fig. 8). PT-(1–46) is able to inhibit the generation of thrombin in the absence of phospholipid membranes, and this inhibition is dependent on the presence of facto"

WT1-responsive promoters have been described; however, in large part, it remains unclear which potential downstream genes are physiologically relevant and mediate the function of WT1 in tumorigenesis and development. To identify genes regulated by WT1 in vivo, we used a dominant-negative version of WT1 to modulate WT1 activity in a Wilms tumor cell line. Screening oligonucleotide arrays with RNA from these cells uncovered a number of genes whose expression was altered by abrogation of WT1 function. Several of the genes encode members of the CCN family of growth regulators. The promoter of one of these genes, connective tissue growth factor (CTGF), is suppressed by WT1 both in its endogenous location and in reporter constructs. WT1 regulation of CTGF expression is not mediated by previously identified WT1 recognition elements and may therefore involve a novel mechanism.

A subset (5–10%) of Wilms tumors is caused by mutations in the tumor suppressor gene, WT1(reviewed in Refs. 1Coppes M.J. Campbell C.E. Williams B.R.G. Wilms Tumor: Clinical and Molecular Characterization. R. G. Landes Co., Austin, TX1995Crossref Google Scholar and 2Reddy J.C. Licht J.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1287: 1-28PubMed Google Scholar). In addition to its role in tumorigenesis, WT1 is also required for normal kidney and urogenital development.WT1 is expressed in a temporally and spatially restricted pattern in the developing kidney and urogenital structures, andWT1 knockout mice die before birth with both kidney and urogenital development blocked at an early stage (3Kreidberg J.A. Sariola H. Loring J.M. Maeda M. Pelletier J. Housman D. Jaenisch R. Cell. 1993; 74: 679-691Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1636) Google Scholar). Based upon these findings, it has been suggested that WT1 is required for the expression of signaling molecules and receptors involved in the reciprocal inductive events of early kidney differentiation (reviewed in Ref. 4Englert C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 389-393Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Involvement of WT1 in normal development is further substantiated by the presence of constitutional heterozygous WT1 mutations in patients with congenital syndromes associated with Wilms tumor (reviewed in Ref. 1Coppes M.J. Campbell C.E. Williams B.R.G. Wilms Tumor: Clinical and Molecular Characterization. R. G. Landes Co., Austin, TX1995Crossref Google Scholar). Both the WAGR syndrome and the Denys-Drash syndrome (DDS)1 are characterized in part by genitourinary malformations as well as predisposition to development of Wilms tumors.Although it is clear that WT1 plays an important role in both development and tumorigenesis, the mechanisms through which it functions in these processes remain poorly understood. WT1 has been implicated in such diverse pathways as RNA splicing, DNA replication, and apoptosis (reviewed in Refs. 2Reddy J.C. Licht J.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1287: 1-28PubMed Google Scholar and 4Englert C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 389-393Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The most well characterized function of WT1, however, is that of a transcription factor. The amino terminus of WT1 is rich in proline and glutamine, a feature characteristic of transactivation domains, and the carboxyl terminus contains four C2H2 zinc finger DNA-binding motifs and a nuclear localization signal sequence. In vivo, there are four major isoforms of WT1 generated by alternative splicing at two sites. Splicing of exon 5 removes 17 amino acids from the middle of the protein, and a second alternative splicing event removes three amino acids (KTS) from between the third and fourth zinc fingers of the protein. The four isoforms of WT1 are present in a constant ratio that is conserved among species, suggesting that they have non-overlapping functions.WT1 binds to DNA via its zinc finger motifs, but this binding is isoform-dependent, with the −KTS and +KTS isoforms binding with distinct affinities to somewhat different sets of sequences (reviewed in Ref. 2Reddy J.C. Licht J.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1287: 1-28PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, the binding of each isoform is only relatively sequence-specific. For example, the −KTS isoforms of WT1 bind sequences resembling the EGR1 consensus (5′-CGC5GC-3′) as well as TC-rich motifs. Upon binding to DNA, WT1 has the capacity to act as either a transcriptional activator or repressor. Most of the experiments done to assess these functions have involved transient transfection with engineered reporter constructs into cells that do not normally express WT1. The results from these experiments vary significantly depending upon experimental conditions such as the cell type and isoform of WT1 used and the exact sequence and arrangement of WT1-binding sites within the reporter.The function of WT1 as a transcriptional regulator in vivois likely affected by post-translational modification and interaction with other proteins. Serine phosphorylation within the zinc finger domain of WT1 has been shown to interfere with nuclear localization and DNA binding (5Sakamoto Y. Yoshida M. Semba K. Hunter T. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 2001-2012Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 6Ye Y. Raychaudhuri B. Gurney A. Campbell C.E. Williams B.R. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5606-5615Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). WT1 physically associates with other cellular proteins, including SF1 (7Nachtigal M.W. Hirokawa Y. Enyeart-VanHouten D.L. Flanagan J.N. Hammer G.D. Ingraham H.A. Cell. 1998; 93: 445-454Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar), p53 (8Maheswaran S. Park S. Bernard A. Morris J.F.

These interactions affect the ability of both partners to regulate transcription. For example, it has been shown that WT1 functions as a transcriptional repressor in the presence of wild-type p53, but functions as an activator in its absence (8Maheswaran S. Park S. Bernard A. Morris J.F. Rauscher III, F.J. Hill D.E. Haber D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90 (. J.): 5100-5104FCrossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). However, these conclusions were drawn from experiments performed in cells that do not express endogenous WT1, and WT1 has also been shown to have transcriptional regulatory capabilities that are independent of p53 (10Duarte A. Caricasole A. Graham C.F. Ward A. Br. J. Cancer. 1998; 77: 253-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar).Given the heterogeneity of sequences that can be bound by WT1 in different circumstances, it is difficult to predict which genes may be relevant targets of WT1 in vivo. Nevertheless, a number of potential WT1 targets have been identified in model systems (reviewed in Ref. 2Reddy J.C. Licht J.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1287: 1-28PubMed Google Scholar). Many of these genes encode products that are involved in the regulation of cell growth and/or differentiation such as growth factors and their receptors. However, with the possible exception of IGF-2 (11Drummond I.A. Madden S.L. Rohwer-Nutter P. Bell G.I. Sukhatme V.P. Rauscher III, F.J. Science. 1992; 257: 674-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar, 12Reeve A.E. Eccles M.R. Wilkins R.J. Bell G.I. Millow L.J. Nature. 1985; 317: 258-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar), most of these putative target genes have only been indirectly implicated in Wilms tumorigenesis through the ability of WT1 to regulate their promoters in transient transfection/reporter construct assays.To identify physiologically relevant transcriptional targets of WT1, we used a dominant-negative mutant version of WT1 to inhibit the function of the endogenous wild-type protein expressed in a Wilms tumor cell line, WiT49. Dominant-negative WT1 mutations are found in patients with DDS, which is characterized by genitourinary malformations, progressive renal failure, and predisposition to development of Wilms tumor (reviewed in Ref. 1Coppes M.J. Campbell C.E. Williams B.R.G. Wilms Tumor: Clinical and Molecular Characterization. R. G. Landes Co., Austin, TX1995Crossref Google Scholar). In contrast to what is observed for sporadic Wilms tumors, nearly 100% of DDS-associated Wilms tumors can be accounted for by mutations in WT1. Furthermore, the spectrum of WT1 mutations seen in DDS is unique in that they are nearly all point mutations within the exons encoding the zinc fingers of the protein. Interestingly, the phenotype associated with DDS point mutations is much more severe than that associated with larger deletions encompassing the region of the point mutation. This suggests that production of DDS mutant protein may be more deleterious than production of no WT1 at all. DDS point mutations abrogate the ability of WT1 to bind to DNA and function as a transcriptional regulator (13Borel F. Barilla K.C. Hamilton T.B. Iskandar M. Romaniuk P.J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 12070-12076Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 14Little M. Holmes G. Bickmore W. van Heyningen V. Hastie N. Wainwright B. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1995; 4: 351-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Furthermore, since WT1 self-associates, the mutant protein is capable of blocking the activity of the wild-type protein and acting as a dominant-negative protein (15Holmes G. Boterashvili S. English M. Wainwright B. Licht J. Little M. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1997; 233: 723-728Google Scholar, 16Moffett P. Bruening W. Nakagama H. Bardeesy N. Housman D. Housman D.E. Pelletier J. Proc. Natl.

Chem. 1995; 270: 10878-10884Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Further evidence that DDS mutant forms of WT1 act as dominant-negative proteins in vivo is provided by the fact that DDS mutations are heterozygous in the germ line of patients and are reduced to homozygosity only in the Wilms tumor itself. Therefore, the genitourinary malformations and progressive nephropathy seen in DDS patients must be due to deleterious actions of the point mutant form of WT1 (reviewed in Ref. 18Hastie N.D. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1992; 1: 293-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar).To identify WT1-regulated transcripts that might play a role in DDS or Wilms tumorigenesis, we generated an expression profile for WT1-expressing Wilms tumor cells and for the same cells stably expressing DDS-WT1 by probing GeneChip high-density oligonucleotide arrays (19Lockhart D.J. Dong H. Byrne M.C. Follettie M.T. Gallo M.V. Chee M.S. Mittmann M. Wang C. Kobayashi M. Horton H. Brown E.L. Nat. Biotechnol. 1996; 14: 1675-1680Crossref PubMed Scopus (2794) Google Scholar, 20Wodicka L. Dong H. Mittmann M. Ho M.H. Lockhart D.J. Nat. Biotechnol. 1997; 15: 1359-1367Crossref PubMed Scopus (856) Google Scholar). Seventy-one genes were identified whose expression was altered by 2.6-fold or more upon expression of DDS-WT1. These genes represent potential in vivo targets of WT1 and may therefore play important roles in Wilms tumorigenesis and/or normal kidney or urogenital development. One of the differentially expressed genes, connective tissue growth factor (CTGF), was analyzed in detail and found to be transcriptionally repressed by WT1.DISCUSSIONTo address the function of WT1 in its native setting, we established a Wilms tumor cell line, WiT49, from a xenograft of an aggressive tumor metastasis.2 Immunohistochemical analysis of various markers showed that the cell line contains both blastemal and epithelial components, features characteristic of primary Wilms tumors. WiT49A cells express high levels of mutant p53 and levels of wild-type WT1 comparable to those present in fetal kidney. Thus, WiT49 cells represent the subset of Wilms tumors that do not contain WT1 mutations (∼90% of the cases) and actually express WT1 at a relatively high level. The ability to propagate WiT49 cells in culture is likely dependent upon their p53 mutation. However, it has been reported that p53 physically interacts with WT1 and can modulate its transcriptional activity in some experimental situations (8Maheswaran S. Park S. Bernard A. Morris J.F. Rauscher III, F.J. Hill D.E. Haber D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90 (. J.): 5100-5104FCrossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). Consequently, it will be interesting to assess the gene expression profile of WiT49 cells conditionally expressing wild-type p53.Since WiT49 represents cell types that normally express WT1, we used a naturally occurring dominant-negative mutant, DDS-WT1, to modulate WT1 function and to uncover WT1 target genes. DDS-WT1 expression was sufficient to inhibit the function of the wild-type protein as evidenced by altered expression of a WT1-responsive reporter gene as well as the endogenous IGF-1R gene. Furthermore, DDS-WT1 transfectants displayed a growth advantage under certain conditions in comparison with control cells. For these reasons, we believe that this system has the potential to reveal differences in gene expression that are dependent upon WT1 activity. Screening of oligonucleotide arrays allowed analysis of the expression of ∼6800 known human genes. Seventy-one (∼1%) genes showed significant changes of >2.6-fold upon inhibition of WT1 function. This is a relatively small number of changes, as might be expected since clones N1 and D5 are presumably identical to one another in all ways except for WT1 activity. In contrast, when the expression profile of either clone N1 or D5 was compared with that of the fibrosarcoma-derived HT1080 cell line (36Der S.D. Zhou A. Williams B.R.G. Silverman R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 15623-15628Crossref PubMed Scopus (1519) Google Scholar), several hundred genes showed significant changes, and the changes were of much greater magnitude (up to 250-fold). This large number of expression changes reflects the many differences between fibrosarcoma cells and kidney blastemal cells.We originally expected that the GeneChip experiment would confirm putative WT1 target genes that have been identified in other systems. However, although probes for a number of these genes (such asWT1, epidermal growth factor receptor, IGF-1R, etc.) were present on the GeneChips, our experiment did not show that their expression was altered by inhibition of WT1 function by DDS-WT1. A probable explanation for this is that the probe sets for these genes on the chip are not functional. The probes are designed by Affymetrix using a computer algorithm and are not actually tested for hybridization or specificity. In fact, WT1 was called “absent” for both clones N1 and D5; however, we know that the WT1 protein is present in clone N1 and overexpressed in clone D5. Examination of the region of the chip containing the WT1 probe set showed that there was indeed no hybridization to any of the 20 probes in the set for either clone N1 or D5.GeneChip analysis of clones N1 and D5 identified a number of new potential WT1 target genes. For some of these, such asDOC-1, it is difficult to make a direct link as to how they might function as downstream effectors of WT1 since there is no functional information available for the gene product (32Mok S.C.

Likewise, the positive regulation of MAGE-3 (and MAGE-1,MAGE-2, and MAGE-12) gene expression by WT1 that is suggested by our results has unclear functional implications. The genes of the MAGE family encode tumor-specific antigens that are expressed in many different tumor types, but not in normal tissues except for testes (25De Plaen E. Arden K. Traversari C. Gaforio J.J. Szikora J.P. De Smet C. Brasseur F. van der Bruggen P. Lethe B. Lurquin C. Brasseur R. Chomez P. DeBacker O. Cavenee W. Boon T.

Med. 1994; 179: 921-930Crossref PubMed Scopus (731) Google Scholar). Since many human cancers have inappropriate expression of one or more MAGE genes, the alteredMAGE gene expression identified here may not be a direct result of WT1 activity, but rather a secondary reflection of the transformed phenotype of WiT49 cells.In contrast to the genes described above, CTGF is likely to be abona fide transcriptional target of WT1. Two independent lines of evidence support this. First, as revealed by GeneChip analysis and confirmed by Northern blotting, the CTGF gene is up-regulated in DDS-WT1-expressing WiT49 clones as compared with control clones. Second, the CTGF promoter is repressed by wild-type WT1 in cotransfection experiments and is constitutively more active in DDS-WT1-expressing clones than in control clones. These results indicate that WT1 negatively regulates CTGF expression in vivo. The placement of CTGF downstream of WT1 suggests that it may mediate the essential functions of WT1 in development and/or tumorigenesis. Several features of CTGF make it a good candidate to fill such a role. CTGF was originally identified as a mitogen secreted by vascular endothelial cells with homology to the v-src-induced immediate-early gene product CEF-10(33Bradham D.M. Igarashi A. Potter R.L. Grotendorst G.R. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 114: 1285-1294Crossref PubMed Scopus (802) Google Scholar). Subsequently, a family of genes, including CTGF, was delineated based upon homology to immediate-early genes and to genes encoding IGFBPs (Ref. 29Kim H.S. Nagalla S.R. Oh Y. Wilson E. Roberts Jr., C.T. Rosenfeld R.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 12981-12986Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar; reviewed in Ref. 37Brigstock D.R. Endocr. Rev. 1999; 20: 189-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar. This family, termed CCN after three of its members (CTGF,CEF-10/C YR61,N ovH), also includes theMAC25 (30Oh Y. Nagalla S.R.

Nagamachi Y. Takeuchi K. Shiroishi T. Toma H. Yokota J. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 187: 289-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar), and WISP1–3genes (39Pennica D. Swanson T.A. Welsh J.W.

Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14717-14722Crossref PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar). The proteins encoded by members of this gene family are all secreted and have similar primary structures including an N-terminal cysteine-rich IGFBP domain.As predicted by the presence of the IGFBP domain, several CCN proteins, including CTGF and MAC25, have been shown to bind IGFs (29Kim H.S. Nagalla S.R. Oh Y. Wilson E. Roberts Jr., C.T. Rosenfeld R.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 12981-12986Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar, 30Oh Y. Nagalla S.R. Yamanaka Y. Kim H.-S. Wilson E. Rosenfeld R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30322-30325Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). However, in contrast to the classical IGFBP-1–6, members of the CCN family have only low affinity for IGFs (29Kim H.S. Nagalla S.R. Oh Y. Wilson E. Roberts Jr., C.T. Rosenfeld R.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 12981-12986Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar), and some members are also capable of binding insulin (40Yamanaka Y. Wilson E.M. Rosenfeld R.G. Oh Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30729-30734Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). These differences are presumably due to the presence of a second cysteine-rich IGFBP domain in IGFBP-1–6 that is lacking in CCN proteins. IGFBPs are critical components of IGF signaling pathways, serving to protect the growth factors from degradation, but also limiting their binding to cell-surface receptors (reviewed in Ref. 41Drop S.L. Schuller A.G. Lindenbergh-Kortleve D.J. Groffen C. Brinkman A. Zwarthoff E.C. Growth Regul. 1992; 2: 69-79PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, both IGFBP-1–6 and the CCN family of low-affinity IGFBPs likely function at least in part to modulate the actions of IGFs in the regulation of cell growth.IGF signaling is thought to play a critical role in the development and progression of Wilms tumorigenesis (reviewed in Ref. 2Reddy J.C. Licht J.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1287: 1-28PubMed Google Scholar). Overexpression of the imprinted IGF-2 gene, which resides at 11p15, is one of the most consistent features of Wilms tumors. This overexpression may arise from loss of heterozygosity, loss of imprinting, or mutation of WT1, which can repress the IGF-2 promoter. The cognate receptor for IGF-2, IGF-1R, is also a target of WT1-mediated transcriptional suppression and is frequently overexpressed in Wilms tumors. Overexpression of both the growth factor and its receptor is thought to result in activation of an autocrine loop that leads to dysregulated proliferation. Given the important role of IGFs in Wilms tumorigenesis as well as normal embryonic development, it is conceivable that modulation of IGF signaling by IGFBPs such as CTGF may be critical to both processes.CTGF was originally identified as a mitogen (33Bradham D.M. Igarashi A. Potter R.L. Grotendorst G.R. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 114: 1285-1294Crossref PubMed Scopus (802) Google Scholar), and other members of the CCN family such as CYR61 (42Kireeva M.L. Mo F.E. Yang G.P. Lau L.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1326-1334Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar) have also been shown to promote cell growth. In contrast, some members of the family such as MAC25 (43Swisshelm K. Ryan K. Tsuchiya K. Sager R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4472-4476Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar, 44Kato M.V. Sato H. Tsukada T. Ikawa Y. Aizawa S. Nagayoshi M. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 1361-1364PubMed Google Scholar) and ELM1 (38Hashimoto Y. Shindo-Okada N. Tani M. Nagamachi Y. Takeuchi K. Shiroishi T. Toma H. Yokota J. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 187: 289-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar) appear to be negative growth regulators. We have found that abrogation of WT1 activity leads to both elevated CTGF expression and enhanced growth under certain conditions. Although these results are consistent with the definition of CTGF as a mitogen, it remains unclear whether CTGF is directly responsible for the growth phenotype of DDS-WT1-expressing WiT49 cells.The IGFBP function of CCN proteins likely accounts for their ability to regulate growth at least in part; however, there is also evidence that these proteins may act in IGF-independent pathways as well. For example, the murine ortholog of CTGF, FISP12, has been shown to promote adhesion, migration, and survival of vascular endothelial cells as well as neovascularization in vivo (45Babic A.M. Chen C.-C. Lau L.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2958-2966Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Several of the CCN proteins have been shown to associate with the extracellular matrix, and CTGF also stimulates extracellular matrix production and deposition (46Kireeva M.L. Latinkic B.V. Kolesnikova T.V. Chen C.-C. Yang G.P. Abler A.S. Lau L.F. Exp. Cell. Res. 1997; 233: 63-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar, 47Frazier K. Williams S. Kothapalli D. Klapper H. Grotendorst G.R. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1996; 107: 404-411Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (670) Google Scholar). Transforming growth factor-β-induced CTGF has been shown to be responsible for extracellular matrix production by fibroblasts during wound healing and in fibrotic disorders (48Grotendorst G.R. Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 1997; 8: 171-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (676) Google Scholar). Furthermore, hyperglycemia has also been shown to induce CTGF expression, which results in an accumulation of the extracellular matrix (49Murphy M. Godson C. Cannon S. Kato S. Mackenzie H.S. Martin F. Brady H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5830-5834Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). This has been suggested to be a mechanism behind the nephropathy that leads to renal failure in diabetic patients. Similarly, it is possible that overexpression of CTGF due to WT1 mutation accounts for the renal fibrosis and ultimate failure that is observed in patients with DDS (50Ito Y. Aten J. Bende R.J. Oemar B.S. Rabelink T.J. Weening J.J. Goldschmeding R. Kidney Int. 1998; 53: 853-861Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar).Our interest in CTGF as a potential downstream effector of WT1 is bolstered by the fact that expression of another member of the CCN family of genes was also altered by inhibition of WT1 function in clone D5. The MAC25 gene was identified as being down-regulated 6.1-fold in clone D5 as compared with clone N1 in the GeneChip experiment. This suggests that WT1 normally activates MAC25expression, whereas it suppresses CTGF expression. The opposite effects of WT1 on expression of these two genes is interesting given that they have been reported to have opposite effects on cellular growth. As described above, MAC25 inhibits proliferation (43Swisshelm K. Ryan K. Tsuchiya K. Sager R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4472-4476Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar, 44Kato M.V. Sato H. Tsukada T. Ikawa Y. Aizawa S. Nagayoshi M. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 1361-1364PubMed Google Scholar), whereas CTGF stimulates growth (33Bradham D.M. Igarashi A. Potter R.L. Grotendorst G.R. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 114: 1285-1294Crossref PubMed Scopus (802) Google Scholar). Thus, both the induction of MAC25 and the suppression of CTGF are consistent with WT1 functioning as a growth suppressor.Involvement of CTGF in Wilms tumorigenesis is also supported by its homology to NovH (51Martinerie C. Viegas-Pequignot E. Guenard I. Dutrillaux B. Nguyen V.C. Bernheim A. Perbal B. Oncogene. 1992; 7: 2529-2534PubMed Google Scholar). The NovH gene was not identified in our GeneChip experiment as being WT1-regulated; however, previous studies have shown that the chicken Nov gene is overexpressed in avian nephroblastoma, a model for Wilms tumor (52Joliot V. Martinerie C. Dambrine G. Plassiart G. Brisac M. Crochet J. Perbal B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 10-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). Furthermore, expression of the human NovH gene is elevated in some primary Wilms tumors, with the levels of NovH and WT1 inversely correlated (53Martinerie C. Huff V. Joubert I. Badzioch M. Saunders G. Strong L. Perbal B. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 2729-2732PubMed Google Scholar), and the NovH promoter is repressed by WT1 in cotransfection assays (54Martinerie C. Chevalier G. Rauscher III, F.J. Perbal B. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 1479-1492PubMed Google Scholar). Together with our evidence for WT1 regulation of CTGF expression, the relation of CTGF to other genes and functions implicated in kidney development and tumorigenesis suggests that the CCN family of proteins are likely downstream effectors of WT1 function in vivo.In theory, downstream targets of WT1 may be oncogenes or tumor suppressor genes themselves. Since all Wilms tumors share certain defining characteristics, but only a small fraction of them harborWT1 mutations, it is reasonable to expect that some tumors will show dysregulation or mutation of other genes that fu"
https://openalex.org/W2012441680,"Protein methylation reactions can play important roles in cell physiology. After labeling intact Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells withS-adenosyl-l-[methyl-3H]methionine, we identified a major methylated 49-kDa polypeptide containing [3H]methyl groups in two distinct types of linkages. Peptide sequence analysis of the purified methylated protein revealed that it is eukaryotic elongation factor 1A (eEF1A, formerly EF-1α), the protein that forms a complex with GTP and aminoacyl-tRNAs for binding to the ribosomal A site during protein translation. Previous studies have shown that eEF1A is methylated on several internal lysine residues to give mono-, di-, and tri-N-ε-methyl-lysine derivatives. We confirm this finding but also detect methylation that is released as volatile methyl groups after base hydrolysis, characteristic of ester linkages. In cycloheximide-treated cells, methyl esterified eEF1A was detected largely in the ribosome and polysome fractions; little or no methylated protein was found in the soluble fraction. Because the base-labile, volatile [methyl-3H]radioactivity of eEF1A could be released by trypsin treatment but not by carboxypeptidase Y or chymotrypsin treatment, we suggest that the methyl ester is present on the α-carboxyl group of its C-terminal lysine residue. From the results of pulse-chase experiments using radiolabeled intact yeast cells, we find that the N-methylated lysine residues of eEF1A are stable over 4 h, whereas the eEF1A carboxyl methyl ester has a half-life of less than 10 min. The rapid turnover of the methyl ester suggests that the methylation/demethylation of eEF1A at the C-terminal carboxyl group may represent a novel mode of regulation of the activity of this protein in yeast.

A large number of protein phosphorylation and dephosphorylation reactions are involved in a variety of cell signaling and metabolic control reactions where specific kinases phosphorylate proteins using the γ-phosphate group of ATP and dephosphorylation of these proteins occurs through the action of phosphatases (4Graves J.D. Krebs E.G. Pharmacol. Ther. 1999; 82: 111-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). In a much smaller number of cases, methylation and demethylation reactions are also involved in cell signaling and, potentially, metabolic regulation (5Clarke S. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1993; 5: 977-983Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Methyltransferases use the methyl donor group onS-adenosylmethionine (AdoMet)1 to methylate various substrates; methylesterases act to demethylate them. The yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae contains theSTE14 isoprenylcysteine methyltransferase that has been shown to methylate a wide range of proteins within the cell (6Young S.G. Ambroziak P. Kim E.

Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 9806-9812Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Its known substrates include the small G-proteins RAS1 and RAS2 and the secreted peptide a-factor (8Hrycyna C.A. Clarke S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 5071-5076Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 9Hrycyna C., A. Sapperstein S.K. Clarke S. Michaelis S.M.

The specific role of this methyltransferase is unknown, but it has been suggested that methylation of its products increases their hydrophobicity to help direct them to the membrane, decreases their rate of proteolytic degradation, and may modulate their protein-protein interactions involved in cell signaling (6Young S.G. Ambroziak P. Kim E. Clarke S. Tamanoi F. Sigman D.S. 3 rd Edition. in Protein Lipidation: The Enzymes. 21. Academic Press, San Diego, CA2000: 155-213Google Scholar). In an attempt to find new reversible AdoMet-dependent methylation/demethylation reactions in yeast, we constructed a mutant strain (MY101) lacking the gene that encodes theSTE14 methyltransferase and also the two genes encoding the AdoMet synthetases (SAM1 and SAM2). Yeast cells contain a specific permease in the outer membrane that actively takes up AdoMet from the surrounding medium (11Murphy J.T. Spence K.D. J. Bacteriol. 1972; 109: 499-504Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Because of its AdoMet synthetase defect, MY101 depends on exogenous AdoMet for growth. We thus supplied isotopically labeled [methyl-3H]AdoMet during log phase growth and analyzed in vivo radiolabeled proteins. We found a major methylated 49-kDa species that contains both amino-methylated and carboxyl-methylated linkages. We purified the methylated 49-kDa protein from a radiolabeled yeast cytosolic extract and performed N-terminal sequence analysis of its tryptic peptides. This work revealed that the 49-kDa polypeptide is elongation factor 1A (eEF1A), which leads aminoacylated-tRNAs to their codon-dependent placement in the A site of the ribosome (12Merrick W.C. Microbiol. Rev. 1992; 56: 291-315Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). eEF1A has already been purified and characterized from S. cerevisiae (13Thiele D. Cottrelle P. Iborra F. Buhler J.-M. Sentenac A.

It is known to contain internal amino-methylated lysine residues (16Cavallius J. Zoll W. Chakraburtty K. Merrick W.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1163: 75-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) with unknown function(s) (17Cavallius J. Popkie A.P. Merrick W.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1350: 345-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). However, the existence of the C-terminal carboxyl methyl ester identified in this study has not been previously recognized. The rapid turnover of the methyl ester of eEF1A in intact cells indicates that its function may be reversibly regulated by this modification. S. cerevisiae strain W744-1A (MATa his3 leu2 ade2 trp1 ura3 sam1::LEU2 sam2::HIS3) was provided by Dr. Yolande Surdin-Kerjan at the Center de Genetique Moleculaire (Gif-sur-Yvette, France). Strain MY101(ste14::URA3, otherwise isogenic toW744-1A) was constructed by transforming strainW744-1A with the ClaI-BamHI fragment of plasmid pSM284 (a gift from Dr. Susan Michaelis at Johns Hopkins University) that contains the STE14 gene with a portion of its coding region replaced by the URA3 coding sequence (10Sapperstein S. Berkower C. Michaelis S. Mol. Cell Biol. 1994; 14: 1438-1449Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar).URA + transformants were selected and tested to show the ste14-defective mating phenotype. Cells were grown at 30 °C in YPD medium (1% (w/v) yeast extract (Difco Laboratories), 2% (w/v) bacto-peptone (Difco), and 2% (w/v)d-glucose) supplemented with a final concentration of 100 μm S-adenosyl-l-methionine HSO4− salt (AdoMet) from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. Strain MY101 was grown to early log phase (A 600 nm between 0.6 and 0.8). Generally, an aliquot of 5 A 600 nm units (5 × 108 cells) was harvested by centrifugation at 1000 × g for 3 min at room temperature. Cells were washed three times with 1 ml of YPD medium. The final pellet (in a 1.5-ml polypropylene microcentrifuge tube) was resuspended in YPD containingS-adenosyl-l-[methyl-3H]methionine ([3H]AdoMet) (892 μl of YPD + 108 μl [3H]AdoMet from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, 77 Ci/mmol, 1 mCi/ml in dilute HCl (pH 2–2.5), ethanol (9:1 v/v)) to give a final concentration of [3H]AdoMet of 1.4 μm. Cells were incubated in a gyratory shaker at 225 rpm for 30 min at 30 °C, then pelleted at 13,600 × g at room temperature for 1 min, and finally washed twice with 1 ml of water. In cases where more cells were labeled, the volume of reagents were adjusted proportionally. Isotopically labeled cells prepared as described above were resuspended in 50 μl of a lysis solution containing 1% SDS (w/v) and 0.67 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride; the latter was prepared from a 100 mm stock in Me2SO. For column chromatography experiments, the lysis solution contained 20 mm MES-Tris, pH 6.5, and a protease inhibitor mixture (described below) instead of SDS. Glass beads (0.2 g, acid-washed, and 0.5-mm diameter from Biospec Products, Inc.) were then added to the cell suspension, and the tube was vortexed for 1 min followed by an incubation on ice for 1 min. This cycle was repeated seven times. Approximately 40 μl of this extract (300–400 μg of total protein) was removed with a micropipet tip; this fraction was used as the “cell lysate.” Nonisotopically labeled cell extracts were prepared using French pressure cell lysis. Cell cultures (1 liter) were grown at 30 °C to an A 600 nm of 2.0. Cells were harvested at 4,400 × g for 7 min at 4 °C and washed with 20 ml of 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5. The resulting cell pellet (5.5 g of wet weight) was resuspended in 11 ml of the same buffer. A mixture of protease inhibitors in Me2SO was added to give final concentrations of 1 mm benzamidine, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 μg/ml aprotonin, and 2 μg/ml pepstatin. The cell suspension was passed twice through a French pressure cell at 20,000 p.s.i., and the resulting lysate was spun at 23,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The supernatant from this centrifugation was utilized for purification of the 49-kDa polypeptide. Unless otherwise described, samples were resuspended in an equal volume of sample buffer (35.5% (v/v) glycerol, 15% (v/v) β-mercaptoethanol, 6% (w/v) SDS, 0.18 m Tris-Cl, pH 6.8, 0.005% (w/v) bromphenol blue), heated at 100 °C for 5 min, and loaded onto 1.5- or 0.8-mm-thick slab gels containing a stacking gel and a 10.5-cm resolving gel in the Tris/glycine buffer system (18Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206631) Google Scholar). The resolving gel was made from 10 or 12% (w/v) acrylamide and 0.28 or 0.43% (w/v)N,N-methylenebisacrylamide, respectively. Molecular mass standards (Bio-Rad number 161-0304) were used at 2 μg of protein each. Samples were electrophoresed with a constant current (35 mA for thick gels and 5–10 mA for thin gels) until the dye front ran off the end of the resolving gel. Gels were stained for 15 min with 0.1% Coomassie Brilliant Blue in 50% methanol and 10% acetic acid in water, destained overnight in 5% methanol and 10% acetic acid in water, washed for 10 min in 5% glycerol, and then vacuum-dried at 65 °C for 70 min onto Whatman 3MM chromatography paper. Dried gel lanes 0.8 cm wide were cut into 0.3-cm slices unless otherwise indicated. To release [3H]methyl esters from polypeptides, 150 μl of 1.5 mNa2CO3 (pH measured at 12) was added to each gel slice in a 1.5-ml polypropylene microcentrifuge tube. In control experiments, 150 μl of 2 m NaOH, 0.2 m HCl, or water was added instead of the 1.5 mNa2CO3. These uncapped tubes were carefully placed into 20-ml plastic scintillation vials containing 5 ml of Safety Solve counting fluid (Research Products International, Mt. Prospect, IL), so that no counting fluid entered the microcentrifuge tube. The vials were then capped tightly, incubated for 24 h at 37 °C, and then counted in a Beckman LS6500 scintillation counter. Here, [3H]methanol resulting from base-catalyzed hydrolysis of protein [3H]methyl esters diffuses from the microcentrifuge tube through the vapor phase and accumulates in the counting fluid. To determine the total radioactivity present in each gel slice, 1 ml of 30% H2O2 was gently added to each microcentrifuge tube within the vials after they were counted for [3H]methanol. Vials were capped loosely and incubated at 37 °C for an additional 24 h. Vials were then tightly capped, shaken vigorously to mix the contents of the vial, and counted. Polypeptides from in vivo [3H]AdoMet-labeled cell lysate were separated by 10% acrylamide SDS gel electrophoresis as described above. The 49-kDa region was identified in an unstained portion of the wet gel relative to an adjacent lane containing molecular mass markers whose positions were identified by Coomassie staining. This region was cut into 0.3-cm slices, and each slice was placed into a 13 × 100-mm tube containing 1 ml of 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5. Each slice was finely chopped with the tip of a narrow spatula, and the tube was then capped and placed on an orbital shaker at 100 rpm at room temperature for about 18 h. An aliquot (50 μl) of the eluted polypeptides was counted for radioactivity to determine which tube(s) contained the [3H]methylated 49-kDa polypeptide. The eluted 49-kDa polypeptide (25 μl) was mixed with 25 μl of 25% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid in a 6 × 50-mm glass vial, incubated at room temperature for 20 min, and then spun at 4000 × g for 25 min at room temperature. The pellet was washed once with acetone (100 μl, −20 °C), dried, and then acid-hydrolyzed in 6 n HCl at 110 °C for 20 h in a Waters Pico-Tag vapor-phase apparatus. For thin layer chromatography, the hydrolysate was mixed with unlabeledN-ε-monomethyl-lysine, N-ε-dimethyl-lysine, and N-ε-trimethyl-lysine and chromatographed on a 20-cm silica plate in methanol, 28% ammonium hydroxide (3:1). The position of the standards were determined from ninhydrin staining; the lane was then cut into 1-cm slices for quantitation of the radioactivity. Slices from a 0.8-mm-thick dried 12% acrylamide gel in the 49-kDa region were mixed with either 250 μl of 1 μg/ml trypsin (Sigma, Type XI, bovine pancreas), 1 μg/ml chymotrypsin (Sigma, Type II, bovine pancreas), or 50 μg/ml carboxypeptidase Y (CPY) (Sigma,S. cerevisiae) each in a solution of 0.2 m Tris, 0.1 m citrate, pH 6, and 1% Triton X-100. In control experiments, 250 μl of 1.5 mNa2CO3 was used. The reactions proceeded in uncapped tubes placed carefully in scintillation vials containing 5 ml of counting fluid. The vials were capped tightly and incubated for 24 h at 37 °C (trypsin and 1.5 mNa2CO3) or 30 °C (chymotrypsin and CPY). [3H]Methyl esters and total radioactivity were analyzed as described above. Yeast contain numerous methyl esterified polypeptides, many of which are formed by the action of theSTE14 AdoMet-dependent C-terminal isoprenylcysteine methyltransferase (7Hrycyna C.A. Yang M.C. Clarke S. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 9806-9812Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). To identify novel methyl esterified proteins in yeast that may represent new types of reversible covalent modification, we utilized a ste14 mutant strain where the gene for the isoprenylcysteine methyltransferase is disrupted. Yeast cells are able to take up AdoMet from the medium (11Murphy J.T. Spence K.D. J. Bacteriol. 1972; 109: 499-504Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); this allows yeast methyl-accepting species to be efficiently radiolabeled in vivo using [methyl-3H]AdoMet in the culture medium. Theste14 strain utilized in this study (MY101) also contains mutations in the genes encoding AdoMet synthetasesSAM1 and SAM2. These mutations make the cells dependent upon exogenously added AdoMet for growth and reduce the isotopic dilution of exogenous radiolabeled AdoMet by endogenously synthesized material within the cell. S. cerevisiae strain MY101 was thus labeled in vivo with [methyl-3H]AdoMet to identify non-STE14-dependent methyl-accepting proteins as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Cellular lysates were analyzed for the presence of polypeptide-bound [3H]methyl esters after fractionation by SDS gel electrophoresis. Here, gel slices were treated with mild base (1.5 mNa2CO3) to release volatile [3H]methanol, which can be trapped in scintillation fluid. Fig. 1 A shows that a major 49-kDa methyl esterified polypeptide exists in these cells. Mild acid treatment (0.2 m HCl) of the 49-kDa species also releases volatile radioactivity as [3H]methanol, although in smaller amounts than the mild base treatment (Fig. 1 A). However, when the gel slice was simply incubated in water, little or no volatile radioactivity was released from the 49-kDa polypeptide (Fig.1 A). When the gel slices of the fractionated polypeptides were treated with a stronger base (2 m NaOH), volatile [3H]methylamine (from methylated arginine residues) was released from several polypeptides (Fig. 1 B and Ref. 20Gary J.D. Lin W-J. Yang M.C. Herschman H.R. Clarke S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12585-12594Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar) in addition to [3H]methanol from methyl esters. However, a similar amount of radioactivity was released at the 49-kDa position with either 2 m NaOH or 1.5 mNa2CO3, suggesting that methylated arginine residues are not present in this material. We also determined the total amount of radioactivity in each of the gel slices (Fig. 1 B). Interestingly, the amount of [3H]methanol released from the 49-kDa polypeptide was only about 5% of the total radioactivity found in the region of the 49-kDa polypeptide (Fig. 1, compare A and B). This result indicates that the polypeptide(s) in the 49-kDa region contain at least two types of methyl groups: one is in a base-labile methyl ester linkage (seen with the release of [3H]methanol in Fig. 1 A), and one is in a base-stable linkage, which would be expected for methylamine derivatives such as methyl lysine or methyl histidine. The amount of [3H]methyl esters incorporated into the 49-kDa polypeptide was found to be similar when cells were incubated with 2% glycerol in place of 2% d-glucose in the YPD medium, or when cells were labeled in a synthetic medium in the absence of a major carbon source (0.5% ammonium sulfate, 0.17% yeast nitrogen base (lacking amino acids), 0.008% adenine, and 0.0008% tryptophan). These results suggest that the protein methyl ester formation occurs during fermentative and nonfermentative growth conditions, as well as under nongrowth conditions. We have not attempted to characterize the radioactive peaks shown in Fig. 1 aside from the 49-kDa component. However, the broad 24-kDa peak appears to represent mostly methyl esters linked to RNA, because it largely disappears upon treatment with RNase (7Hrycyna C.A. Yang M.C. Clarke S. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 9806-9812Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The smaller methyl ester peaks in the range of 32–40-kDa may be minor methylated species or degradation products of the 49-kDa component. In vivo [3H]AdoMet-labeled 49-kDa polypeptide from MY101 cells was eluted from the SDS gel matrix and was subjected to strong acid hydrolysis to identify the major nonesterified methylated amino acid species as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The resulting acid hydrolysate was mixed with nonisotopically labeled standards ofN-ε-trimethyl-lysine and 3-methyl-histidine. The mixture was applied to a sulfonated polystyrene-based high resolution cation exchange column (Beckman amino acid analysis resin AA-15, Ref. 20Gary J.D. Lin W-J. Yang M.C. Herschman H.R. Clarke S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12585-12594Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar) that separates methyl derivatives of lysine from methyl derivatives of histidine. We found that a major peak of radioactivity co-eluted with the methyl lysine standard, whereas no radioactivity coeluted with the methyl histidine standard (data not shown). Thin layer chromatography of the acid hydrolysis products revealed that 29% of the radioactivity comigrated with the N-ε-monomethyl-lysine standard, 62% comigrated with the N-ε-dimethyl-lysine standard, and 9% comigrated with the N-ε-trimethyl-lysine standard. It thus appears that the side chain amino group of lysine residues is a major site of methylation in the 49-kDa polypeptide. An in vivo[3H]AdoMet-labeled cytosolic extract was fractionated on a CM52 carboxymethyl cellulose column to separate the [3H]methylated 49-kDa polypeptide from other polypeptides (Fig. 2). We found that the [3H]methyl esterified polypeptide eluted both in the flow-through and salt-eluted fractions (Fig. 2). The ratio of base-labile and base-stable material was similar in each of the fractions, indicating that these species comigrated under these conditions. Interestingly, we found that a major 49-kDa Coomassie Blue staining band followed the [3H]methyl radioactivity throughout the column, suggesting that the methylated species might be an abundant polypeptide in the cell. In fact, in the 200 mmNaCl eluted material, the only major Coomassie-staining polypeptide was a 49-kDa species that co-electrophoresed with both the total and methyl ester radioactivity (Fig. 2, fractions 21 and22). The additional peak of radioactivity (Fig. 2,fraction 30) was not investigated; we detected no Coomassie or silver staining polypeptide. It thus appears that a single abundant 49-kDa polypeptide may contain two types of methyl linkages.Figure 3Ribosome-bound eEF1A is methyl esterified. S. cerevisiae strain MY101 was labeled with [3H]AdoMet as in Fig. 1. Ribosomes were then isolated by a protocol based on that described by Savitz and Meyer (19Savitz A.J. Meyer D.I. J. Biol.

Cells were washed twice with H2O and lysed in low salt buffer (50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 25 mmpotassium acetate, 5 mm magnesium acetate, and 0.67 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) with glass beads. The cell lysate was diluted to 10 ml with low salt buffer and placed on a 15-ml cushion of 2.1 m sucrose in low salt buffer. The mixture was centrifuged at 110,000 × g for 24 h at 4 °C. The pellet containing intact ribosomes was resuspended in 1.5 ml of high salt buffer (50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 950 mm potassium acetate, and 5 mm magnesium acetate) and transferred to a 2-ml cushion of 1.8 m sucrose in high salt buffer and centrifuged at 110,000 × g for 24 h at 4 °C. The pellet, containing ribosome-bound proteins, was resuspended in 500 μl of LSB containing 0.25 msucrose, and 30 μl was analyzed by 12% polyacrylamide SDS gel electrophoresis (A). Dried gel slices in the 49-kDa region were cut as illustrated and analyzed for [3H]methyl esters (B, squares) using 1.5 mNa2CO3; total radioactivity (B,solid line) was determined using 30% H2O2, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Here, the major 49-kDa polypeptide (eEF1A) is contained entirely within slice 3; slice 4 contains the clear area below this polypeptide, slice 5 contains a minor polypeptide of about 46-kDa, and the other slices represent flanking regions.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Figure 1Evidence for an abundant methyl esterified 49-kDa polypeptide in yeast.

This mixture was applied to a 15-ml carboxymethyl cellulose column (CM52 from Whatman) equilibrated with 20 mm MES-Tris, pH 6.5, and 25% glycerol buffer at room temperature.

Many of the proteins regulating these activities recognize their chromatin-binding targets in a DNA sequence-dependent manner. In addition, the nucleus contains numerous proteins, such as HMG1 proteins, that bind to their chromatin targets without apparent specificity for the underlying DNA sequence. The high mobility group (HMG) proteins affect the expression of many genes, most probably by altering the local structure of DNA or chromatin and by inducing a conformation that facilitates the binding of specific regulatory factors (1Bustin M. Reeves R. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol. Biol. 1996; 54: 35-100Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Bustin M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 5237-5246Crossref PubMed Scopus (758) Google Scholar). Each type of HMG subgroup has a characteristic binding site; however, the main mechanisms for targeting the proteins to these sites or to specific regions in chromatin are not fully understood. The HMG-14/-17 proteins are the only nuclear proteins known to preferentially bind to the 147-base pair nucleosome core particles,i.e. to the building block of the chromatin fiber (3Sandeen G. Wood W.I. Felsenfeld G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1980; 8: 3757-3778Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). These proteins can function as architectural elements that unfold the chromatin fiber (4Postnikov Y.V. Trieschmann L. Rickers A. Bustin M. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 252: 423-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 5Postnikov Y.V. Herrera J.E. Hock R. Scheer U. Bustin M. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 274: 454-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). All the nucleosomes in the chromatin can bind these proteins; however, the amount of HMG-14/-17 in the nucleus is limited (6Jones E.W. The HMG Chromosomal Proteins. Academic Press, London1982Google Scholar). Therefore, in vivo, only a small fraction of the nucleosomes in cellular chromatin contains these HMGs. The HMG-17 nucleosomes are clustered into domains and can serve to decompact the structure of the 30-nm chromatin fiber, thereby reducing the repressive activity of chromatin. The intranuclear distribution of both HMG-14 and HMG-17 is dynamic and not uniform (7Phair R.D. Misteli T. Nature. 2000; 404: 604-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (964) Google Scholar, 8Hock R. Wilde F. Scheer U. Bustin M. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1427-1436Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The proteins are not associated with chromatin during metaphase and re-enter the nucleus, in a facilitated process, only after the formation of the nuclear membrane (8Hock R. Wilde F. Scheer U. Bustin M. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1427-1436Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Thus, their cellular location is cell cycle related. In addition, the intranuclear organization of the proteins depends on transcriptional activity. At high levels of transcriptional activity the proteins are dispersed into small foci, while at low levels of transcriptional activity they are organized into larger clusters (9Hock R. Scheer U. Bustin M. Wilde F. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6992-7001Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The molecular mechanisms that regulate the intranuclear distribution and chromatin organization of these proteins are not known. One possibility is that certain nucleosomes contain unique sequences with high affinity for HMG-14/-17 proteins. Alternatively, the HMG-14/-17 proteins are targeted to specific regions with the assistance of other proteins. It is relevant that activities known to modify the chromatin structure such as histone acetylases, histone deacetylases, and chromatin remodeling complexes are present in the nucleus as high molecular weight multiprotein complexes. Here we investigate several mechanisms that may determine the distribution of the HMG-14/-17 proteins in chromatin. First, we use chromatin immunoprecipitation assays (ChIP) to examine whether any DNA class, such as transcriptionally active chromatin regions, or repetitive DNA sequences, are significantly enriched in HMG-17 protein. We find that the HMG-17 content in chromatin regions containing the transcribed T-cell receptor ζ gene from mouse thymus is only 1.5 times higher than in chromatin regions containing a non-transcribed gene. Similar levels of enrichment were observed previously by other approaches. In all these studies the choice of gene examined is arbitrary, and does not exclude the possibility that chromatin regions containing a particular subset of genes are highly enriched in HMG-14/-17 proteins. We therefore used a modification of the random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) method (10Williams J.G. Kubelik A.R. Livak K.J. Rafalski J.A. Tingey S.V. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 6531-6535Crossref PubMed Scopus (10672) Google Scholar) to screen the nucleosomes obtained from the entire genome, and search for DNA sequence elements that would serve to target HMG-14/-17 proteins to particular nucleosomes. We find that HMG-14/-17 proteins preferentially bind to DNA regions depleted of CG and enriched in AT and TA; however, this preference is not sufficient to target the proteins to specific regions in chromatin. Our results clearly indicate that the genome does not contain sequences that serve as HMG-14/-17-binding sites. By fractionating a nuclear extract we obtained a high molecular weight multiprotein complex containing non-nucleosome-bound HMG-17. We therefore suggest that in the nucleus the proteins are present as multiprotein complexes, and that components of this complex affect the intranuclear organization and chromatin binding of HMG-14/-17 proteins. Mouse thymus mononucleosome preparation and immunoprecipitation with antibodies to HMG-17 was carried out as described before (5Postnikov Y.V. Herrera J.E. Hock R. Scheer U. Bustin M. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 274: 454-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Three DNA preparations (T-DNA for total mononucleosome preparation, IP-DNA for immunoprecipitate, and S-DNA for supernatant) were blotted to nylon membranes and probed with the following probes: 1) mouse high Co t-1 DNA (Life Technologies); 2) mouse repetitive B1 element-containing plasmid derived from the α-fetoprotein gene (11Young P.R. Scott R.W. Hamer D.H. Tilghman S.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1982; 10: 3099-3116Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar); and 3) a sequence specific to the T-cell receptor ζ gene (12Weissman A.M. Baniyash M. Hou D. Samelson L.E. Burgess W.H. Klausner R.D. Science. 1988; 239: 1018-1021Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). DNA was labeled by T7 QuickPrime random-priming kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and hybridized as described below. Recombinant human HMG-14 and HMG-17 proteins were expressed using the T7 expression system and vector pVEX11 and purified as described before (13Postnikov Y.V. Lehn D.A. Robinson R.C. Friedman F.K. Shiloach J. Bustin M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4520-4526Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Nucleosome core particles were isolated from chicken red blood cells (14Ausio J. Dong F. van Holde K.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1989; 206: 451-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). The histone content of the nucleosomes was monitored by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Triton-acid-urea gel electrophoresis (15Dimitrov S.I. Wolffe A.P. Methods. 1997; 12: 57-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Gel mobility shift assays of HMG-nucleosome complexes were carried out in 2 × TBE buffer, (1 × TBE buffer = 90 mm Tris, 90 mmborate, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.4). In brief, 50 pmol of core particles were incubated with 5–150 pmol of HMG protein, in a volume of 50 μl, at 4 °C for 10 min. 10 μl of 20% Ficoll 400 were dispensed to each tube and the reaction mixture was loaded on a 5% native polyacrylamide gel, run, and stained with ethidium bromide. The core particles that were shifted at a low HMG:core particle ratio (below 1) were denoted as high affinity (HA) core particles. Typically, these were less than 15% of the total DNA (as measured by ethidium bromide staining). Conversely, the nucleosome cores that have not been shifted at HMG:core particles ratio of about 3 (approximately 15% of total particle population) were denoted as low affinity (LA) cores. Bands of interest were excised from the gel, and the DNA extracted by diffusion from crushed gels. The preparations served as DNA templates for PCR with RAPD primers. Sucrose density gradient-purified HeLa mononucleosomes were prepared as described previously (16O'Neill T.E. Roberge M. Bradbury E.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 223: 67-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), except that buffer A contained a complete mixture of protease inhibitors (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Immunoprecipitation was done using affinity pure antibodies and immobilized Protein A. DNAs were extracted from the immunoprecipitates and the supernatants, and denoted as IP-DNA and S-DNA, respectively. For each RAPD reaction, a set of three 10-base oligonucleotide primers was used to amplify various preparations of nucleosomal DNA. About 100 primers for RAPD reactions were purchased from Operon Technologies. They were selected with the requirements that the G+C content should be 60 to 70%, and no self-complementary ends were allowed. By using three primers per one reaction an average of 60 PCR products were observed. This number of fragments can be reliably resolved and analyzed using short sequencing gels. The primers were grouped into 30 sets of 3 primers each, ensuring no internal priming sites for the two other primers in a set (the complete list is available upon request). Pre-mixed sets of primers were end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP by T4 polynucleotide kinase and used to amplify 100 ng of DNA. The cycling reactions were performed at 94 °C for 1 min, 45 °C for 1 min, 72 °C for 1 min, 30 cycles. After PCR, gel loading dye was added to the reaction mixtures and a 3-μl aliquot loaded onto 40-cm sequencing gels and run for 1.5 h, at constant power (30 W). The gel was transferred onto Whatman 3MM paper and the PCR products visualized by PhosphorImager (Storm Instrument, Molecular Dynamics). The rest of the reaction mixture was loaded on preparative sequencing gels. The bands were excised from the preparative gels and subjected to a second round of PCR using the original set of RAPD primers, which were phosphorylated with cold dATP. The ends of the PCR products were blunted using Klenow and the reaction mixture loaded on 8% PAGE in 1 × TBE buffer. The bands were visualized by staining with ethidium bromide, and the DNAs eluted and ligated into the SmaI site of a pUC18 cloning vector. The DNA preparations (the same as were used for RAPD reaction) were extracted from the native gel, denatured, and slot blotted onto a nylon membrane (S&S, Nytran, 0.45 μm) in three dilutions (150, 50, and 15 ng). The DNA probes were labeled with the T7 QuickPrime Kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Hybridizations were done in 5 × Denhardt, 6 × SSC, 0.5% SDS, salmon sperm DNA (20 μg/ml) at 65 °C for 4 h. The blots were washed once with 2 × SSC, 0.1% SDS at 65 °C for 30 min and 3 times with 0.1 × SSC, 0.1% SDS at 65 °C for 5 min. Cloned RAPD fragments were excised from vectors and then purified by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The ends of the DNA fragment were filled-in with Klenow enzyme and [α-32P]dNTP. Nucleosome reconstitutions were carried out by the exchange technique (17Hayes J.J. Lee K.M. Methods. 1997; 12: 2-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), using chicken blood core particles as the histone octamer donors. HMG-14/-17 proteins were added to the reconstituted nucleosomes and HMG·CP complexes were analyzed as described above. These reaction mixtures contained 100 mexcess of cold competitor DNA to minimize the effects of the slight fluctuations in concentration of the purified cloned fragment. The cloned RAPD bands were sequenced using USB Sequenase version 2.0 kit and 40-cm long 8% electrolyte-gradient polyacrylamide gel. GenBank homology searches were done using the Blast program. Multiple alignments were done using Clustal W (version 1.74). Di- and trinucleotide frequency analysis was done as described by others (18Karlin S. Mrazek J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 10227-10232Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). The average roll angle, tilt angle, and twist angle of each cloned DNA sequence predicted from the di- and trinucleotide frequency were calculated using available software DNA tools (19Ulyanov N.B. James T.L. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 261: 90-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 20Munteanu M.G. Vlahovicek K. Parthasarathy S. Simon I. Sangor S. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 341-347Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Selected cloned sequences were treated with Sss I methylase (CpG methylase, New England BioLabs), and an aliquot was digested by HpaII to verify the effectiveness of methylation as described previously (21Nightingale K. Wolffe A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4197-4200Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Then, the DNA was end-labeled, reconstituted into nucleosomes by the exchange method as described above, and titrated with increasing amounts of HMG-14 or HMG-17. The reaction mixture was loaded on native 5% polyacrylamide gel run in 2 × TBE. The gels were dried, autoradiographed, and the resulting bands were quantified with a PhosphorImager. The presence of HMG-17 during the various purification steps was followed by Western analysis. After every round of chromatography, the HMG-17 containing fractions were dialyzed against the initial buffer of the next chromatography step and concentrated as required. Nuclear extracts from exponentially growing HeLa S3 cells were prepared as described (22Dignam J.D. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 182: 194-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). The nuclear extract was applied to a Superose 6 column eluted with in 100 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.2. The fraction containing HMG-17 was dialyzed against 100 mmsodium phosphate, pH 6, loaded onto a Mono S HR 5/5 column and the proteins were eluted using linear 0 to 1 m NaCl gradient. The HMG-17 containing fraction was concentrated and size fractionated on BioSep SEC S3000 (Phenomenex) in 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.2. The HMG-17 containing fraction was concentrated, and fractionated on a Mono Q HR 5/5 column eluted with a sodium chloride gradient from 0.1 to 0.6 m in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.8. The proteins in the various fractions were analyzed by electrophoresis in SDS-containing 15% polyacrylamide gels and visualized by silver staining of 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and silver staining. Initially, we examined whether in a differentiated tissue, such as mouse thymus, HMG-17 protein is associated with a specific class of DNA sequence. Chromatin isolated from mouse thymus nuclei was digested with micrococcal nuclease, fractionated on sucrose gradients, and the mononucleosomes containing HMG-17 protein were immunoprecipitated using affinity pure antibodies. Approximately 1% of the DNA was recovered in the immunoprecipitates. Membranes with equal amounts of total input DNA (T-DNA), immunoprecipitated DNA (IP-DNA), and DNA from the mononucleosomes that remained in the supernatant (S-DNA), were hybridized with the following32P-labeled probes: T-DNA, IP-DNA, B1-DNA (a highly Alu-like repetitive element found in >105 copies per genome), mouse high Co t-1 DNA, α-satellite DNA, and a probe for the T-cell receptor ζ gene, known to be expressed in the mouse thymus. All the probes hybridize with equal efficiency to the T-DNA and S-DNA (Fig.1). The IP-DNA was depleted of the repetitive B1 sequences and slightly enriched in high Co t-1 DNA. The IP-DNA, i.e. the HMG-containing mononucleosomes, was also enriched (1.5 times) in ζ gene sequences. The differences in the amount of HMG-17 protein associated with various types of DNA were not significant. Therefore, we conclude that this protein is not permanently and exclusively associated with any specific class of DNA, including the DNA in transcriptionally active chromatin regions. This conclusion is in full agreement with previous information obtained by various immunofractionation approaches (23Postnikov Y.V. Shick V.V. Belyavsky A.V. Khrapko K.R. Brodolin K.L. Nikolskaya T.A. Mirzabekov A.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 717-725Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 24Druckmann S. Mendelson E. Landsman D. Bustin M. Exp. Cell Res. 1986; 166: 486-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), and also with the more recent finding that the intranuclear organization of the proteins is dynamic (7Phair R.D. Misteli T. Nature. 2000; 404: 604-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (964) Google Scholar, 8Hock R. Wilde F. Scheer U. Bustin M. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1427-1436Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), i.e. their interaction with any particular chromatin region is temporary rather than permanent. Usually, results obtained by ChIP assays are dependent on the choice of the probes and do not provide information on potential DNA sequence elements that may regulate the binding of HMG-14/-17 proteins to nucleosomes. Therefore we used an alternative approach, a modification of the RAPD method, to scan all of the possible HMG:core particles. This approach does not require the use of arbitrarily chosen probes. The specific binding of HMG-14/-17 to nucleosome core particles (Fig.2 A) can be detected by mobility shift assays, in which the HMG·CP complex migrates slower than the free CP. A gradual increase in the HMG:CP molar ratio results in a concomitant increase in the relative amount of the HMG·CP complex (Fig. 2 B). The nucleosomes with the highest affinity for HMG-14/-17 will form complexes with the protein first. We reconstituted the total population of chicken blood CP with various amounts of HMG-14 or HMG-17 and separated the HMG·CP complexes from free CP by electrophoresis on native nucleoprotein gels. The CP that formed complexes with either HMG-14 or HMG-17 at a low protein:CP ratio (less than 1), when approximately 15% of the total CP were shifted, were denoted as “high affinity HMG-14/-17 CP” (HA-CP in Fig. 2B), and the DNA excised from these bands was denoted as “HMG-14/-17 high affinity DNA” (HA-DNA). The CP that remained uncomplexed at relative high protein:CP ratios (molar ratio 3:1), when over 80% of the CP were shifted, were denoted as “low affinity HMG-14/-17 CP” (LA-CP in Fig. 2B), and the DNA extracted from these bands was denoted as “HMG-14/-17-low affinity DNA” (LA-DNA). The DNA, extracted from the total population of CP (CP in lane 1 in Fig. 2 B), was denoted as “total CP DNA” (T-DNA). The average length of the nucleosomal DNA was the same in all the DNA populations, as assessed by electrophoresis of 32P-end labeled DNA on sequencing gels and autoradiography (not shown). Likewise, electrophoresis in Triton-acid-urea gels did not reveal significant differences in the acetylation state of the core histones in all the populations of core particles (not shown). To examine whether the binding of HMG-14/-17 proteins to CP is affected by the sequence of the nucleosomal DNA, we used a modification of the RAPD procedure to search for differences between the HA-(14 or 17)-DNA, LA-(14 or 17)-DNA, and T-DNA preparations. The DNAs were amplified using different sets of 32P-labeled RAPD primers. The radioactive PCR products were resolved by electrophoresis on sequencing gels and then visualized by autoradiography (Fig.3 A). Control reactions, in which DNA was not added, contained only short 15–25-nucleotide long PCR bands, which could be the products of primer dimerization at low annealing temperature. Therefore, in all the lanes, the bands migrating at these positions were ignored. For analysis, each lane was scanned, the background subtracted, and the scans superimposed. The results clearly indicate that most of the bands with identical mobility have the same intensity in all the tracks (Fig.3 A). There was no marked difference in the RAPD pattern generated from CP complexed with either HMG-14 or HMG-17 proteins. In more than 1000 bands generated from 30 RAPD reactions we detected only one specific band generated from the DNA isolated from the CP that preferentially bound to HMG-17, and one specific band generated by the CP that preferentially bound HMG-14. However, the autoradiography signals of about 4% of the bands in the HA-DNA tracks, and of 2% of bands in the LA-DNA tracks, were at least twice more intense than that of the corresponding bands in the T-DNA tracks. These results suggest that a small fraction of the total core particles binds HMG-14/-17 protein with either a higher (bands enriched in the HA-DNA tracks) or lower (bands enriched in the LA-tracks) affinity than the average particle. To examine the DNA in the nucleosome particles that bind HMG-14/-17 with an affinity that is different from the average, we isolated, cloned, and sequenced all the PCR fragments that were highly enriched in either HA-DNA or LA-DNA (HA bands and LA bands). A total of 83 clones were analyzed (Table I). Since HMG-14 and HMG-17 proteins generated very similar RAPD patterns we did not distinguish between those originating from the HMG-14·CP complexes from those originating form HMG-17·CP complexes. As controls, we cloned and sequenced 41 fragments, that were equally intense in both HA- and LA- DNAs. These are named AA clones (AA stands for “average affinity”).Table IStatistics of RAPDLA clonesAA clonesHA clonesNumber of clones144128Total length (bp)155347303190Average length/per clone (bp)110.9115.4113.9 Open table in a new tab We performed two kinds of tests to verify that the DNAs identified by RAPD indeed had some property that was different from the average DNA. First, we tested whether the DNA rehybridized to the selected bands with the expected intensity. Slot-blot analysis, in which the cloned DNAs were used as probes for HA-DNA, LA-DNA, or T-DNA indicated that the cloned sequences do indeed hybridize with the expected intensity (Fig. 3 B). Thus, HA clone 42.1a.7 that was enriched in an RAPD reaction with HA-DNA, preferentially hybridized to HA-DNA on a membrane. As expected, AA clone 48.6b.2 that was cloned as one of the control sequences, did not show any preference for either LA-DNA or HA-DNA, while LA clone 40.1c.6 preferentially hybridizes to LA-DNA. The results corroborate the RAPD data. Second, we tested whether the cloned DNAs can be complexed with histones to reconstitute nucleosomes with the expected affinity for HMG-14/-17 proteins. Clones with inserts longer than 140 bp were reconstituted into nucleosomes and tested for affinity for HMG-14 or HMG-17 proteins by gel mobility shift assays (Fig. 3 C). The affinity constant of HMG-14 and HMG-17 for nucleosomes is 1.1 and 0.5 × 107, respectively (15Dimitrov S.I. Wolffe A.P. Methods. 1997; 12: 57-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). We found that nucleosomes reconstituted using the DNA from HA clones (40.1a.5 and H015–3, lanes 1–6) have higher affinity for HMG proteins (∼2.05 × 107 for HMG-14 and 0.95 × 107 for HMG-17), while the nucleosomes reconstituted using the DNA from LA clones (40.1c.7 and 48.5c.1, lanes 7–12) had a lower affinity for HMG-14/-17 (∼0.25 × 107and 0.15 × 107, respectively) (Fig. 3 C). Thus, in lanes 2, 3, 5, and 6 most of the CPs, reconstituted on HA clone DNAs, were associated with HMG proteins while in lanes 8, 9, 11, and 12 most of the CPs, reconstituted on LA clone DNAs, were not associated with HMG proteins at similar protein concentrations. Thus, the RAPD reaction is suitable for isolating the DNA from nucleosomes that vary in their affinity for HMG-14/-17 proteins To examine whether the sequences from the various DNA pools contain common sequence motifs, we performed multiple alignment analysis of all the sequences in both orientations. The analysis did not detect any common motifs in any of the DNA pools, even though we limited the number of aligned sequences to five at a time, checked all the possible combinations of five sequences, and also calculated the average pairwise alignment per each nucleotide. A Blast search of the GenBank data base with each of the sequences detected seven clones having 85–100% identity with known sequences. One of the HA clones was homologous to a region located 300 bp downstream from the protein phosphatase inhibitor 2 gene, and another HA clone to a region located 500 bp upstream from the acyl CoA-binding protein/diazepam-binding inhibitor gene. Three AA clones contained regions homologous to the transcribed portion of the chicken neuropeptide Y gene, to chicken endogenous proviral avian retroviral LTR and to Mus musculus uroplakin II gene. One LA clone was similar to a known sequence of a CpG island, and the other one contained an Alu-like repeat. We conclude that in vitro, the binding of HMG-14/-17 to nucleosome cores is not dependent on a specific DNA sequence element. We next performed a similar analysis with HMG-17 containing nucleosomes isolated by immunoprecipitation of HeLa chromatin. These particles should be representative of the in vivo HMG·CP complexes. We immunoprecipitated HMG:CP particles as described before (see previous section) and analyzed the DNA isolated from both the immunoprecipitated nucleosomes and from the nucleosomes that remained in the supernatant, by the RAPD procedure using the primer sets that were used in the in vitro experiments. Most of the bands generated by the entire sets of primers were common to two DNA pools; however, several primer sets generated bands that were specific to either the immunoprecipitated DNA (IP-DNA) or the DNA that remained in the supernatant (S-DNA, Fig.4). We reasoned that the RAPD bands enriched in the IP-DNA lanes were preferentially associated with HMG-17in vivo. Conversely, the bands were enriched in the S-DNA lanes, originated from the core particles that in vivo had low affinity for HMG-17. We isolated and sequenced 6 clones from each type of DNA (IP clones and S clones, respectively) and analyzed them by the same parameters as the CP isolated from the in vitroreactions (Fig. 3 A). We did not obtain a consensus sequence and a Blast search did not yield any significant hits. We conclude therefore that the genome does not contain unique DNA sequence motifs that target HMG-14/-17 proteins to specific regions in chromatin. It is important to note that in these studies we analyzed individual RAPD fragments with total length of more than 105 base pairs (35 RAPD reactions, 50 bands in each, with an average length of 80 bp per band). This number of base pairs includes all possible genomic hexamers 25 times, all possible heptamers 7 times, and all possible octamers 1.5 times. Consensus sequences for abundant regulatory factors are of limited length. For example, the consensus sequence for the TATA-binding protein (TBP) is shorter than 7 bp. Therefore, any putative short consensus sequence regulating the binding of HMG-14/-17 proteins (either positively or negatively) to core particles would have been present in the samples that we analyzed. Thus, our studies indicate that the genome does not contain specific short sequence elements that target HMG-14/-17 proteins to specific sites. Both in vivo and in vitro HMG-14/-17 proteins bind to nucleosome cores to form complexes containing either two molecules of HMG-14 or two molecules of HMG-17. Our finding that the RAPD patterns generated by the nucleosome cores interacting with HMG-14 are indistinguishable from those generated by HMG-17, provides additional support for the conclusion that the DNA sequence is not a significant factor in determining the binding of these proteins to core particles. Nevertheless, the RAPD analysis suggests that the affinity of about 6% of the core particles is either higher (4%), or lower (2%) than that of the bulk core particles. To further characterize the DNA in the various nucleosome core pools, we grouped all HA, AA, and LA clones into separate pools and calculated the observed versus expected frequencies for mono-, di-, and trinucleotides. As indicated in Fig.5 A, the 3 pools had a very similar content of mononucleotides. However, the 3 DNA pools differed in the frequency of some of the dinucleotides. Most strikingly, the frequency of the dinucleotide CG (arrowhead) was 3 times lower in HA clones (observed versus expected frequency 0.22) than that in the LA clones. Indeed, a plot of the distribution of CG occurrences in all the individual clones indicates that the sequences derived from HA-DNA have a significantly lower content of CG than those derived from LA-DNA (Fig. 5 C). In addition, the frequencies for GG, CC, TA, and AT dimers in HA-DNA were 25–40% higher than in LA-DNA. The trinucleotide frequency distribution of the clones reflected their dinucleotide content. Thus, the majority of the triplets were uniformly dispersed between all DNA pools (not shown). All the trinucleotides that were strongly under-represented in HA-DNA contained the dinucleotide CG. The 4 dinucleotides CC, GG, AT, or TA were not present in these CG-containing trinucleotides, but were over-represented in other trinucleotides that were prevalent in HA-DNA. We note that all these differences between the HA-DNA and LA-DNA are internally consistent, since the frequency distribution of the dinucleotides within each DNA pool was very close to the inverted complementary dinucleotide. For example, the dinucleotide frequency of GG is equal to that of CC. Likewise, the frequency of almost every dinucleotide, if increased for HA clones, was decreased in LA clones, and vice versa (in 13 out of 16 combinations). We also note that the dinucleotide frequencies of all the clones, i.e. the overall low content of CG (and not GC) and TA, and the high frequencies of AG, CT, TG, and CA, are characteristic of the chicken genome. We also analyzed certain structural characteristics of the various sequences. We calculated the local maximum, minimum, and average bendability for each clone, and averaged the values for the HA-, AA-, and LA-DNA pools. Although the DNA in the HA clones was relatively untwisted, none of these calculations showed statistically significant differences between the various DNA pools. The distribution frequency of the di- and trinucleotides and the physical characteristics of the DNA in the clones obtained from the mononucleosomes isolated from HeLa were the same as in the clones obtained from the in vitro reactions. Thus, the clones generated by the IP-DNA, i.e. from mononucleosomes that were associated with HMG-17, had both a lower frequency of CG (observedversus expected ratio 0.23), and a higher frequency of CC, GG, AT, and TA than the clones generated from the mononucleosomes that remained in the supernatant (Fig. 5 B). An obvious explanation of the dinucleotide frequency data would be that HMG-14/-17 proteins bind weaker to nucleosomes containing methylated DNA, since CG sequences are known methylation sites in DNA. We therefore reconstituted nucleosomes on Sss I-methylated cloned DNAs from either HA-DNA or LA-DNA. Mobility shift assays indicated that methylation did not affect the binding of HMG-14/-17 proteins to either DNA or cores particles (not shown). Thus, we conclude that the under-representation of CG in the HA-DNA does not reflect a lower affinity of HMG-14/-17 proteins to methylated DNA. In summary, the characteristics of the nucleosomal DNA in the HMG-17-containing mononucleosomes isolated from HeLa cells by the ChIP procedure were similar to those in the chicken CP that associated with HMG-14/-17 in vitro. HMG-14/-17 proteins preferentially bind to nucleosomes in which the DNA has a relatively low content of CG dinucleotides and is somewhat enriched in TA and AT dinucleotides. However, based on the measurements of the affinity constants for the binding of HMG-14/-17 to sequences with different dinucleotide frequencies, we conclude that the dinucleotide composition is not a major factor in regulating the interaction of the proteins with chromatin. Thus, our major conclusion is that the genome does not contain specific DNA sequence elements that serve to target these proteins to nucleosomes, i.e. the organization of HMG-14/-17 in chromatin is not dependent on direct, specific interactions between the nucleosomal DNA and the HMG-14/-17 proteins. The absence of DNA sequence elements that specifically bind HMG-14/-17 protein raises the possibility that the proteins are actively targeted to specific regions, perhaps in association with other proteins,i.e. as multiprotein complexes. Indeed other nuclear activities known to target and modify chromatin have been isolated as large complexes containing several proteins. We searched for the presence of such tentative complexes, by fractionating a nuclear extract of HeLa S3 cells on size exclusion columns. Western analysis of fractions obtained from a BioSep SEC S3000 column revealed the presence of two major HMG-17-containing peaks (Fig.6 B). The first peak eluted with the void volume, i.e. contained complexes larger than 700 kDa, while the second peak contained free HMG-17 protein. High molecular weight complex containing HMG-17 protein has been partially purified by several chromatographic steps (Fig. 6 A). We used Western blotting to confirm the presence of HMG-17 protein and silver staining of 15% polyacrylamide gels to analyze the protein composition of the peaks. We observed 8–10 protein bands that consistently co-purified with HMG-17 protein (Fig. 6 C). These finding strongly suggest that HeLa nuclei contain a large portion of HMG-17 associated with other proteins in a multiprotein complex. This article contains two major new findings. First, we conclusively demonstrate that the genome does not contain DNA sequences that target the HMG-14/-17 proteins to specific nucleosomes. Thus, the organization of HMG-14/-17 proteins is not dependent on direct interactions between the sequence of the nucleosomal DNA and HMG-14/-17 proteins. We suggest that the association of the proteins with a specific region in chromatin may be transient, dependent on the metabolic state of a cell, and independent of the sequence of the nucleosomal DNA. This observation fully agrees with recent photobleaching experiments indicating that in living cells, both HMG-14 and HMG-17 move rapidly and constantly throughout the entire nucleus in a diffusion driven, Brownian-type motion. Second, we demonstrate that in the nucleus HMG-17 is associated with other proteins to form a high molecular weight, multiprotein complex. Although this complex is not fully characterized, its occurrence provides a conceptual framework to explain the dynamics of the intracellular organization of HMG-14/-17 proteins. We suggest that the intracellular trafficking and chromatin targeting of HMG-14/-17 proteins are regulated by proteins that interact with these HMGs and form a multiprotein complex."

CP2, a factor homologous to Drosophila Elf-1 and previously found to be a critical regulator of several viral and cellular genes in response to developmental signals, is rapidly activated in T helper (Th) cells in response to mitogenic stimulation. Here we show that overexpression of CP2 enhances interleukin (IL)-4 promoter-driven chloramphenicol acetyltransferase expression, while repressing IL-2 promoter activity, in transiently transfected Jurkat cells. A CP2-protected element, partially overlapping the nuclear factor of activated T cell-binding P2 sequence, was required for IL-4 promoter activation in CP2-overexpressing Jurkat cells. This CP2-response element is the site of a cooperative interaction between CP2 and an inducible heteromeric co-factor(s). Mutation of conserved nucleotide contacts within the CP2-response element prevented CP2 binding and significantly reduced constitutive and induced IL-4 promoter activity. Expression of a CP2 mutant lacking the Elf-1-homology region of the DNA-binding domain inhibited IL-4 promoter activity in a dominant negative fashion in transiently transfected Jurkat cells. Moreover, overexpressed CP2 markedly enhanced, while its dominant negative mutant consistently suppressed, expression of the endogenous IL-4 gene in the murine Th2 cell line D10. Taken together, these findings point to CP2 as a critical IL-4 transactivator in Th cells.

Paul W.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 264: 20525-20528Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). IL-4 is typically expressed in (and, at the same time, promotes the differentiation of) the T helper 2 (Th2) functional subset of CD4+ T cells, thereby playing a pivotal role in the regulation of humoral and allergic responses. Conversely, Th1 cell-associated cytokines, such as IL-2 and interferon-γ, are central to the development of cell-mediated, delayed type, and autoimmune responses (2O'Garra A. Immunity. 1998; 8: 275-283Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1337) Google Scholar). The biochemical and molecular mechanisms accounting for polarized expression of cytokine genes in T cells have been the focus of a number of studies over the past few years (3Fitch F.W. McKisic M.D. Lancki D.W. Gajewski T.F. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1993; 11: 29-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). Calcineurin-mediated activation of members of the nuclear factor of activated T cell (NFAT) family of transcription factors has been associated with antigen-dependent cytokine gene expression in both Th1 and Th2 cells (4Rao A. Luo C. Hogan P.G. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1997; 15: 707-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (2195) Google Scholar). However, NFAT-directed IL-4 transcription is preferentially induced in Th2 cells, presumably due to the involvement of Th2-restricted co-factors (5Li B. Tournier C. Davis R.J. Flavell R.A. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 420-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar, 6Ho I.-C. Hodge M.R. Rooney J.W. Glimcher L.H. Cell. 1996; 85: 973-983Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (596) Google Scholar). It is likely that the commitment toward an IL-4-producing, Th2 phenotype is the outcome of a complex, dynamic interaction of multiple transcriptional regulators rather than the effect of a single protein. Irrespective of the cytokine milieu leading to preferential Th1 or Th2 differentiation (2O'Garra A. Immunity. 1998; 8: 275-283Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1337) Google Scholar), priming of T cells by antigen or mitogens is a requirement for IL-4 but not IL-2 production (7Weinberg A.D. English M. Swain S.L. J. Immunol. 1990; 144: 1800-1807PubMed Google Scholar). In fact, the IL-4 gene is only transcribed in actively dividing T cells, while IL-2 expression occurs independently of the cell cycle (8Bird J.J. Brown D.R. Mullen A.C. Moskowitz N.H. Mahowald M.A. Sider J.R. Gajewski T.F. Wang C.R. Reiner S.L. Immunity. 1998; 9: 229-237Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (739) Google Scholar). T cell priming affects the expression and/or activation of a number of factors presumably involved in the regulation of cytokine genes. For example, primed T cells express higher levels of NFAT-1 and support greater NFAT-directed transcription than naive T cells (9Cron R.Q. Bort S.J. Wang Y. Brunvand M.W. Lewis D.B. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 860-870PubMed Google Scholar). An earlier study also showed rapid and marked up-regulation of the DNA binding activity of the transcription factor CP2 following mitogenic stimulation of peripheral blood naive T cells, suggesting the involvement of this protein in the activation of immediate and/or early genes in these cells (10Volker J.L. Rameh L.E. Zhu Q. DeCaprio J. Hansen U. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1435-1446Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). CP2, also known as leader-binding protein (LBP)-1c (11Yoon J.-B. Li G. Roeder R.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1776-1785Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) or late simian virus 40 factor (12Shirra M.K. Zhu Q. Huang H.-C. Pallas D. Hansen U. Mol. Cell.

In this study, we investigated the contribution of CP2 to the mechanisms regulating expression of the two pivotal T cell-restricted cytokines IL-2 and IL-4. A line of Jurkat T cells, which constitutively expresses IL-4 and produces IL-2 and interferon-γ following activation, was a gift by Dr. Jack L. Strominger (Harvard University). Cells were cultured in RPMI (Mediatech, Herndon, VA), containing 2 mml-glutamine, 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (Gemini Bio-Products, Calabasas, CA), and 50 μg/ml gentamicin (complete medium). Aliquots of cells frozen at early passages were recovered from liquid nitrogen and used for experiments between 1 and 6 weeks after thawing. The murine conalbumin-specific Th2 clone D10.G4.1 (D10; American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA) was maintained in culture by biweekly restimulation with antigen and irradiated (2,000 rads) syngeneic splenocytes as antigen-presenting cells in RPMI supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 2 mml-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 50 μm2-mercaptoethanol. IL-4 expression in these cultures was verified using a sensitive commercial enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (Cytoscreen-US™, BIOSOURCE International, Camarillo, CA). The IL-4 promoter fragments used in this study were generated by polymerase chain reaction using human genomic DNA as a template and cloned into the HindIII and XbaI sites of a Bluescript vector (Stratagene Cloning Systems, La Jolla, CA). An XbaI-tailed oligonucleotide, corresponding to bp +36 to +55 of the human IL-4 gene, and one of eightHindIII-tailed oligonucleotides, corresponding to bp −741 to −722, −311 to −292, −265 to −246, −225 to −206, −175 to −156, −145 to −126, −95 to −76, or −65 to −46, were used to introduce the appropriate restriction sites at the invariant 3′- and at the 5′-ends, respectively. After sequence verification, each fragment was inserted into the HindIII and XbaI sites of the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT)-expressing reporter vector, pCAT-Basic (Promega, Madison, WI) to construct the corresponding reporter plasmids IL-4.741, IL-4.311,IL-4.265, IL-4.225, IL-4.175,IL-4.145, IL-4.95, and IL-4.65 (21Georas S. Cumberland J. Burke T. Park E. Ono S. Casolaro V. Leukemia. 2000; 14: 629-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). An IL-4.225 plasmid carrying two point mutations within the CP2-response element (CPRE) was generated by site-directed mutagenesis (QuikChange™; Stratagene). The following mutagenic primer (mutations are underlined) and its complement were synthesized (Genosys Biotechnologies, The Woodlands, TX): 5′-CATTTTCCTATTGGTATTATTTCACAGGAACATTTTACCTG-3′. The CP2 expression plasmid was generated by insertion of the murine CP2 cDNA into the HindIII and NotI sites of a pRc/CMV vector (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA) (14Lim L.C. Fang L. Swendeman S.L.

A CP2 mutant lacking the Elf-1-homologous region of the DNA-binding domain (ΔElf-1) was generated from a full-length template as described (22Zhong F. Swendeman S.L. Popik W. Pitha P.M. Sheffery M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21269-21276Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and inserted into the same vector. TheIL-2.15ΔCX reporter plasmid, bearing bp −319 to +52 of the human IL-2 gene in pCAT-Basic (23Shaw J.-P. Utz P.J. Durand D.B. Toole J.J. Emmel E.A. Crabtree G.R. Science. 1988; 241: 202-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar), has been kindly donated by Dr. Gerald R. Crabtree (Stanford University, Stanford, CA). Jurkat cells (0.5–1 × 106/ml) were transfected with 1 μg of reporter plasmids and 2 μg of expression plasmids by 48-h culture in 5 ml of complete medium containing 5.2 mg/ml LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.) as described (24Casolaro V. Georas S.N. Song Z. Zubkoff I.D. Abdulkadir S.A. Thanos D. Ono S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 11623-11627Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Equal amounts of the corresponding noncoding vectors were added to control samples to yield a constant amount (3 μg) of DNA in each transfection. Where indicated, cells were stimulated 16–18 h before harvest. 40–80 μg of proteins extracted from each sample were analyzed for CAT concentration using a commercial enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). In all experiments, CAT concentrations were normalized by total protein content, measured in cell lysates using the Bradford reagent (Bio-Rad). D10 cells (5 × 107 cells/ml) were separated from irradiated splenocytes by centrifugation onto a Ficoll-Isopaque gradient (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and then electroporated (960 microfarads, 270 V) with 45 μg of expression or control plasmids in 0.4 ml of serum-free RPMI using a Gene Pulser II System (Bio-Rad). Following 20-h recovery in complete medium, D10 cells were seeded on plates coated with 1 μg/ml anti-CD3 antibody (clone 145–2C11; BD PharMingen, San Diego, CA) and then incubated for 16 h prior to RNA extraction. Total RNA was extracted from D10 cells using RNAzol B (Tel-Test, Inc., Friendswood, TX). Specific antisense DNA templates for murine IL-4 and for the internal control glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) were purchased (BD PharMingen). These were used to synthesize the α-[32P]UTP (3,000 Ci/mmol, 10 mCi/ml; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech)-labeled probes in the presence of a GACU pool using a T7 RNA polymerase (Promega). Riboprobes (500,000 cpm) were hybridized with 5–15 μg of target RNA at 45 °C, followed by digestion with RNase A (Promega) for 30 min at 30 °C as described (25Song Z. Krishna S. Thanos D. Strominger J.L. Ono S.J. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 180: 1763-1774Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The samples were loaded on an acrylamide-urea sequencing gel next to labeled DNA molecular weight markers and next to the labeled probes and run at 50 watts in 45 mm Tris, pH 8.2, 45 mm boric acid, and 1 mm EDTA. The gel was adsorbed to filter paper, dried under vacuum, and exposed to film (X-OmatTM AR; Eastman Kodak Co.) at −70 °C with an intensifying screen. Autoradiographs were quantified by computerized densitometry using a Kodak Digital Science Electrophoresis Documentation and Analysis System. Results are shown as the ratio of IL-4/GAPDH densitometric units. Nuclear extracts were prepared by a modification of a described protocol (26Li Y. Ross J. Scheppler J.A. Franza Jr., B.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 1883-1893Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Jurkat cells (2–5 × 107) were allowed to swell in 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 30 mm KCl, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 μg/ml aprotinin and then lysed (5 min, 4 °C) by the addition of 0.075% Nonidet P-40. Nuclei were isolated by centrifugation (4 min, 3,000 rpm) and then extracted (40 min, 4 °C) in 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 420 mm KCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, and 20% glycerol. Extracts were separated from cellular debris and membranes (10 min, 14,000 rpm), aliquoted, quick-frozen in liquid nitrogen, and then stored at −80 °C. Protein concentrations in all extracts were measured by the Bradford protocol (Bio-Rad). Recombinant CP2 (rCP2) was prepared and enriched as described previously (14Lim L.C. Fang L. Swendeman S.L. Sheffery M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 18008-18017Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The following oligonucleotides and their complements were synthesized (Genosys Biotechnologies): 5′-TGCTGAAACTTTGTAGTTAATTTTTTAAAAAGGTTTCATTTTCCTATTGG-3′ (225), 5′-AGGTTTCATTTTCCTATTGGTCTGATTTCACAGGAACATTTTACCTGTTT-3′ (195), 5′-TCTGATTTCACAGGAACATTTTACCTGTTT-3′ (175), 5′-TTGGTCTGATTTCACAGGAACAT-3′ (IL-4 CPRE), 5′-TTGGTATTATTTCACAGGAACAT-3′ (IL-4 CPRE MUT), and 5′-TAGAGCAAGCACAAACCAGGCCAA-3′ (α-globin CPRE). These were either 5′-end-labeled using T4 polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA) and [γ-32P]ATP or labeled by random hexamer priming using the Klenow fragment (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and [α-32P]dCTP (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). In both cases, radiolabeled probes were purified by spin column chromatography (ProbeQuant; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and then by electroelution from 4% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gels. For EMSA, probes (10,000–30,000 cpm, corresponding to 5–20 fmol) were incubated (20–30 min, 25 °C) with 1–5 μg of nuclear extracts or 10–100 ng of rCP2 in 15 μl of 12 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 50 mm KCl, 0.5 mm MgCl2, 0.12 mm EDTA, 0.12 mm EGTA, 4 mmdithiothreitol, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 12% glycerol, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 30 μg/ml (10 μg/ml in the case of rCP2) poly(dI-dC) (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Where indicated, 20 min after the addition of the probe, the binding reactions were incubated (30 min, 4 °C) with rabbit antisera specific for the transcription factors CP2 (16Lim L.C. Swendeman S.L. Sheffery M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 828-835Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), NFAT-1 (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., Lake Placid, NY), CCAAT-binding factor (CBF)-A (Accurate Chemical & Scientific, Westbury, NY), or signal transducer and activator of transcription 6 (STAT6) (Santa Cruz Biotechnologies, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA). This led, under the experimental conditions described, to ablation of the immunoreactive complexes, with almost no detectable “supershift” (14Lim L.C. Fang L. Swendeman S.L. Sheffery M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 18008-18017Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Free probes and DNA-protein complexes were resolved by electrophoresis on 4% native polyacrylamide gels in 45 mmTris, pH 8.2, 45 mm boric acid, 1 mm EDTA, and 1% glycerol and then visualized by autoradiography of fixed and dried gels. Footprinting experiments were performed as described (27Sigman D.S. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 9097-9105Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). To identify discrete nucleotide contacts for rCP2 within the CP2-responsive IL-4 promoter region, a 195–146 oligonucleotide was 5′-end-labeled on the coding or noncoding strand and then incubated (30 min, 25 °C) with 100 ng of rCP2 in 25 μl of EMSA buffer (described above). Samples were electrophoresed on a 4% native polyacrylamide gel, which was then immersed into a solution containing 10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 0.2 mm1,10-phenanthroline, and 0.045 mm CuSO4(Sigma). The chemical nuclease reaction was started by the addition of mercaptopropionic acid (Sigma) to 0.05%, allowed to proceed for 12 min at 25 °C, and then quenched in 2 mm2,9-dimethyl-1,10-phenanthroline (Sigma). Free DNA and DNA-protein complexes, visualized by autoradiography, were eluted from the gel matrix (18 h at 37 °C) in 0.5 m ammonium acetate, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, and 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate. Equivalent amounts of DNA from each sample and of a Maxam-Gilbert G+A ladder of the same probe (27Sigman D.S. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 9097-9105Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar) were resolved by electrophoresis on an 8% acrylamide, 7 m urea gel. Several potential CP2 elements are located within the proximal 300 bp of the human IL-4 promoter. We analyzed the effect of transient CP2 overexpression on CAT gene expression driven by an IL-4 promoter region included between bp −311 and +55 in the human T cell line Jurkat. In agreement with previous studies (24Casolaro V. Georas S.N. Song Z. Zubkoff I.D. Abdulkadir S.A. Thanos D. Ono S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 11623-11627Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 28Arai N. Nomura D. Villaret D. DeWaal-Malefijt R. Seiki M. Yoshida M. Minoshima S. Fukuyama R. Maekawa M. Kudoh J. Shimizu N.

Immunol. 1992; 148: 1913-1918PubMed Google Scholar), we found that these cells are in a preactivated state with respect to IL-4 expression, characterized by constitutively elevated IL-4 mRNA accumulation (data not shown) and promoter activity (Fig.1). Constitutive IL-4 promoter activity was enhanced up to 5-fold in Jurkat cells transiently transfected with a CP2 expression plasmid (Fig. 1). CP2 overexpression resulted in less noticeable increase of IL-4 promoter activity in cells stimulated with PMA (10 ng/ml) and the Ca2+ ionophore A23187 (1 μm), presumably due to the contribution of endogenous CP2 to IL-4 activation in these cells (see below). In striking contrast, PMA- and A23187-induced IL-2 promoter activity was reduced by up to 80% in CP2-overexpressing cells (Fig. 1). To map the IL-4 promoter element(s) necessary for transactivation by CP2, we generated a panel of deletional mutants for use in reporter studies (Fig.2 A) (21Georas S. Cumberland J. Burke T. Park E. Ono S. Casolaro V. Leukemia. 2000; 14: 629-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Transiently overexpressed CP2 was more effective on promoter constructs truncated at bp −265 or −225 than on IL-4.311 or IL-4.741 (Fig. 2 B). However, removal of the region spanning bp −225 to −176 decreased transcriptional activation in CP2-overexpressing cells by almost 4-fold, while constructs truncated at bp −145 through −65 were unresponsive to the factor (Fig. 2 B). This indicated that a CPRE is located between bp −175 and −146, although additional nucleotide contacts upstream of bp −175 might be required for full promoter inducibility by CP2. The IL-4 promoter region included between bp −225 and −146, shown in Fig. 2 C, harbors a number of elements contributing to a varying degree to IL-4 transcriptional activation (21Georas S. Cumberland J. Burke T. Park E. Ono S. Casolaro V. Leukemia. 2000; 14: 629-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 30Takemoto N. Koyano-Nakagawa N. Arai N. Arai K. Yokota T. Int. Immunol. 1997; 9: 1329-1338Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 31Li-Weber M. Davydov I.V. Krafft H. Krammer P.H. J. Immunol. 1994; 153: 4122-4133PubMed Google Scholar). To verify whether CP2 can directly bind to elements located within this IL-4 promoter region, we generated three oligonucleotides spanning partially overlapping sequences for use in EMSA (Fig. 2 C). rCP2, used at a concentration (100 ng/15 μl) sufficient for saturation of an α-globin consensus oligonucleotide (Fig.2 D, lane 1), did not bind to oligonucleotides 175–146 (lane 2) and225–176 (lane 4). Since nucleotide contacts in both subregions might be required for CP2 binding, we also used as a probe an oligonucleotide (195–146) including the proximal 20 bp of the 225–176 segment in addition to175–146 (Fig. 2C). This resulted in consistent formation of a CP2 complex of apparently lower affinity than that formed on the α-globin probe (Fig. 2 D, lane 3). A complex of faster mobility also formed on the195-146 oligonucleotide, which was accounted for by binding of monomeric CP2, as assessed by coincubation with CP2-specific antibodies (data not shown). To define the nucleotide contacts necessary for CP2 binding to this region of the IL-4 promoter, we analyzed the pattern of protection from chemical cleavage of a 195–146 oligonucleotide following EMSA with rCP2. In experiments using copper-phenanthroline as the cleaving agent (27Sigman D.S. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 9097-9105Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar), rCP2 (100 ng) protected a sequence extending from bp −177 to −158 (Fig. 2 E). A CPRE (−174CTGATTTCACAGG−162) is recognizable within this sequence. Its homology to CP2 elements identified within other cellular and viral promoters is shown in Fig. 2 F. The IL-4 CPRE displays a conserved (−165CAGG−162) and an imperfect CNRG motif (−174CTGA−171) separated by a 5-bp linker. A constitutive CP2-immunoreactive complex was formed in EMSA using a consensus α-globin CP2 oligonucleotide and nuclear extracts from Jurkat cells (Fig. 3, A and B). CP2 nuclear expression and/or DNA binding activity in these cells was not affected by stimulation with PMA and A23187 (Fig. 3 A,lanes 2 and 3). Four complexes were detectable in EMSA with Jurkat nuclear extracts and a similar length oligonucleotide probe centered on the IL-4 promoter CPRE (lanes 4–6). Differently from the α-globin complex, Ca2+-mediated stimulation did affect formation of the slower mobility complexes I and II, with consistently increased formation of complex II and diminished complex I formation (lane 5). Both complexes appeared to contain immunoreactive CP2, as indicated by the neutralizing effect of rabbit anti-CP2 antibodies (Fig. 3 B, lane 6), while neither complex reacted to CBF-A-, NFAT-1-, or STAT6-specific antibodies (lanes 7 and 8 and data not shown). Complexes III and IV apparently consisted of unrelated constitutive nuclear protein(s) of unclear sequence specificity. To elucidate the contribution of endogenously expressed CP2 to constitutive and inducible activity of the IL-4 promoter, we analyzed CAT expression in Jurkat cells transiently transfected with plasmids carrying point mutations within the IL-4 CPRE that would selectively affect the formation of the CP2-containing complexes. Disruption of the distal CNRG motif (−174ATTATTTCACAGG−162) was sufficient to markedly decrease CP2 binding in EMSA using Jurkat nuclear extracts (Fig. 3 C) or rCP2 (not shown). This was accompanied by an almost 50% decrease in constitutive and induced CAT expression in Jurkat cells transiently transfected with anIL-4.225 plasmid carrying the same mutation within the CPRE (Fig. 3 D). To further assess the contribution of endogenous CP2 to IL-4 promoter activity, we generated, for use in transient transfection experiments, a plasmid encoding a CP2 polypeptide lacking the Elf-1 homology region of the DNA-binding domain (13Uv A.E. Thompson C.R.L. Bray S.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 4020-4031Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and referred to as ΔElf-1 mutant. In a previous study, this mutant did not bind to DNA and specifically inhibited binding of full-length CP2 in a dominant negative fashion (22Zhong F. Swendeman S.L. Popik W. Pitha P.M. Sheffery M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21269-21276Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Its overexpression inhibited by >75% constitutive IL-4 promoter activity in Jurkat cells (Fig. 4 A). A similar degree of IL-4 promoter inhibition was seen in cells stimulated with A23187, while IL-2 promoter activity was fundamentally unaffected (data not shown). Up-regulation of IL-4 promoter activity in CP2-overexpressing Jurkat cells was often paralleled by markedly increased IL-4 secretion, suggesting direct activation of the endogenous IL-4 gene (data not shown). However, due to low level expression of IL-4 and the poor transfection efficiency in these cells, the effect of overexpressed ΔElf-1 CP2 was far less apparent (not shown). To elucidate the role of CP2 in transcriptional activation of the endogenous IL-4 gene, we therefore assessed the effect of overexpressed CP2 polypeptides on IL-4 transcript accumulation in the murine Th2 cell line D10. As shown in Fig. 4, B and C, D10 cells transfected to higher than 50% efficiency with a full-length CP2-encoding plasmid expressed, upon CD3 ligation, markedly higher levels of IL-4 mRNA than cells transfected with the corresponding noncoding plasmid. In contrast, and in clear agreement with our findings shown in Fig. 4 A, overexpression of the dominant negative ΔElf-1 mutant consistently interfered with CD3-dependent activation of the IL-4 gene in D10 cells. In this study, we provide the first evidence of the involvement of CP2, the prototypical member of a novel family of transcription factors related to the Drosophila developmental protein Elf-1, in the regulation of cytokine genes expressed in T cells. CP2 has been involved in gene regulation in a variety of cell lineages, where it can act as both a transcriptional activator and a repressor (14Lim L.C. Fang L. Swendeman S.L. Sheffery M. J. Biol.

Gal11 and the general transcription factor (TF) IIE are involved in regulation of the protein kinase activity of TFIIH that phosphorylates the carboxyl-terminal domain of RNA polymerase II. We have previously shown that Gal11 binds the small and large subunits of TFIIE at two Gal11 domains, A and B, respectively, which are important for normal function of Gal11 in vivo. Here we demonstrate that Gal11 binds directly to TFIIH through domain A in vitro. A null mutation in GAL11 caused lethality of cells when combined with temperature-sensitive mutations in the genes encoding TFIIE or the carboxyl-terminal domain kinase, indicating the presence of genetic interactions between Gal11 and these proteins. Mutational depletion of Gal11 or TFIIE caused inefficient opening of the transcription initiation region, but had no significant effect on TATA-binding protein occupancy of the TATA sequence in vivo. These results suggest that the functions of Gal11 and TFIIE are necessary after recruitment of TATA-binding protein to the TATA box presumably at the step of stable preinitiation complex formation and/or promoter melting.

A priori, the function can be divided at least into two groups according to their roles in Mediator: the receiver/conveyer of an activator signal(s) and the modulator of the activity of RNA polymerase II. Several reports have revealed physical interactions between Mediator components and natural or artificial activators, suggesting that such components play the former role (4Lee Y.C. Park J.M. Min S.

Mutational depletion of Mediator subunit Gal11 results in inefficient transcription of various genes (17Sakurai H. Fukasawa T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32663-32669Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Purified or recombinant Gal11 stimulates basal transcription in a cell-free system reconstituted with recombinant or highly purified general transcription factors and RNA polymerase II (18Sakurai H.

The following observations suggested that Gal11 and the general transcription factor (TF) IIE, while interacting with each other, function in a common regulatory pathway. First, two domains of Gal11, A and B, which are essential for its in vivofunction, make contacts with the small (Tfa2) and large (Tfa1) subunits of TFIIE, respectively (17Sakurai H. Fukasawa T. J.

Second, yeast cells expressing a mutant form of TFIIE that fails to bind Gal11 show phenotypes similar to those of gal11 null mutants (17Sakurai H. Fukasawa T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32663-32669Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Third, Gal11 cooperates with TFIIE to stimulate CTD phosphorylation catalyzed by TFIIH (19Sakurai H. Fukasawa T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9534-9538Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of the CTD associates with transition from initiation to elongation in the synthesis of transcript (20Dahmus M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19009-19012Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar). Therefore, it may be in this process that Gal11 and TFIIE function to regulate transcription. In this study, we present biochemical and genetic evidence indicating the existence of physical as well as functional connections among Gal11, TFIIE, and TFIIH. We also show that the functions of Gal11 and TFIIE are necessary after the binding of TATA-binding protein (TBP) to the TATA box using an in vivo potassium permanganate footprint technique. Furthermore, we describe analyses of yeast cells containing mutations in GAL11, MED2,PGD1, or SIN4, which encode proteins that form a subcomplex in Mediator (3Lee Y.C. Kim Y.-J. Mol. Cell.

These results have revealed functional interactions among these proteins and thereby shed light on the question of how Mediator regulates RNA polymerase II activity. The wild-type TFA1(HS33), mutant tfa1-21 (HS46), wild-typeGAL11 (NOY396), and null mutant gal11 (HS16) strains were described previously (18Sakurai H. Kim Y.-J. Ohishi T. Kornberg R.D. Fukasawa T.

Recombinant Tfa1, Tfa2, and glutathioneS-transferase (GST) fusion proteins were produced inEscherichia coli and purified as described (17Sakurai H. Fukasawa T. J. Biol.

Each of the GST fusion proteins was immobilized on glutathione-agarose (Sigma) as described (17Sakurai H. Fukasawa T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32663-32669Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The resin was equilibrated with buffer A (17Sakurai H. Fukasawa T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32663-32669Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) containing 0.1 m potassium acetate (buffer A-0.1) and incubated with purified proteins for 1 h on ice. After washing the resin with buffer A-0.1, bound proteins were eluted with buffer containing 20 mm glutathione, 0.1 m Hepes-KOH, pH 7.6, 0.1 m potassium acetate, 1 mm EDTA, and 20% glycerol. Bound and unbound proteins were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and analyzed by immunoblotting by the use of an enhanced chemiluminescent detection system (ECL, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). For the experiment in Fig. 1 C, bound proteins were eluted with buffer A-0.5. Bound and unbound proteins were precipitated by 10% trichloroacetic acid, separated on an SDS-polyacrylamide gel, and visualized by silver staining. Potassium permanganate (KMnO4) footprint analysis was carried out as described (28Giardina C. Perez-Riba M. Lis J.T. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 2190-2200Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 29Giardina C. Lis J.T. Science. 1993; 261: 759-762Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Yeast cells were grown in YPD or YPGal medium (15 ml) toA 600 nm = 1.0. Cells collected by centrifugation were resuspended in 0.6 ml of the medium used and treated with 25 mm KMnO4 for 2 min at room temperature. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 12 ml of sorbitol solution (0.9 m sorbitol, 0.1 mTris-HCl, pH 7.6, 50 mm EDTA, and 40 mm2-mercaptoethanol). DNA was purified, treated with 1 mpiperidine at 90 °C for 30 min, and recovered by ethanol precipitation (29Giardina C. Lis J.T. Science. 1993; 261: 759-762Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Linker ligation-mediated PCR was carried out as described (28Giardina C. Perez-Riba M. Lis J.T.

A DNA sample was subjected to primer extension with primer-1 using DeepVent DNA polymerase (New England Biolabs Inc.) and then ligated with a linker for 12 h. After ethanol precipitation, the DNA sample was used for PCR with linker primer and primer-1 and then with 5′ end-labeled primer-2. The primers used are as follows:GAL7 5′ primer-1,−150GGACTGGCTATACAGTGTTC−131;GAL7 5′ primer-2,−93GCTATGTTCAGTTAGTTTGGCTAGC−69;GAL7 TATA primer-1,−195AGAGGGTCCAAAAAGCGCTCG−175;GAL7 TATA primer-2,−179GCTCGGACAACTGTTGACCGTGATC−155;GAL7 3′ primer-1,+120CTTTTAGCTCTGTGTGGAGA+101; andGAL7 3′ primer-2,+105GGAGAAACTAAGATCCATGAATCGG+81. Direct binding of Gal11 to TFIIH was tested by protein affinity chromatography. The GST/Gal11 fusion protein (Fig.1 A) immobilized on glutathione-agarose was incubated with TFIIH purified from yeast. After extensive washing, bound and unbound proteins were subjected to immunoblotting and probed with an antibody raised against the 73-kDa subunit (Tfb1) of TFIIH (30Gileadi O. Feaver W.J. Kornberg R.D. Science. 1992; 257: 1389-1392Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1 B(middle panel, lane 2), most of Tfb1 was detected in the bound fraction when TFIIH was incubated with GST/Gal11-immobilized resin. When TFIIH was incubated with control resin with GST alone, Tfb1 was exclusively detected in the unbound fraction (lane 1). This observation suggests that Gal11 specifically binds to TFIIH in vitro. To dissect the Gal11 region involved in binding to TFIIH, various deletion derivatives of Gal11 were constructed (Fig. 1 A). The results show that the Gal11 region at amino acids 866–929 is necessary for binding (Fig. 1 B, lanes 3–7). The proteins retained on the GST/Gal11-(866–929) resin were also analyzed by silver staining. As shown in Fig. 1 C (lane 1), the TFIIH sample used for the assay contained the TFIIH subunits and small amounts of contaminating proteins. (Although bands corresponding to Ssl1, Ccl1, and Kin28 may not be seen in this figure, we could unambiguously recognize these proteins in the original gel. We were unable to resolve Tfb3 and Tfb4 in our electrophoresis system because the two proteins have a similar molecular mass (5Hampsey M. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1998; 62: 465-503Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 27Svejstrup J.Q. Feaver W.J. LaPointe J. Kornberg R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28044-28048Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).) The TFIIH subunits were significantly enriched in the bound fraction, whereas a major part of each contaminating protein was contained in the unbound fraction (compare lanes 2 and 3). A band with a molecular size similar to that of Rad3 was seen in the unbound fraction, however. We did not ascertain whether this band represents Rad3 or a contaminating protein. We also could not identify Kin28 on the gel because it comigrated with GST/Gal11-(866–929), which was dissociated from glutathione-agarose during the binding reaction. These results strongly suggest that Gal11 directly binds to TFIIH via its genuine subunit(s), but not via the contaminating proteins, even though we were unable to identify definitively all of the TFIIH subunits in the Gal11-bound fraction for technical reasons. It remains to be determined which subunit(s) of TFIIH binds to Gal11. The Gal11 region from amino acids 866 to 929 designated domain A is necessary for normal function in vivo as well as for binding to the small subunit (Tfa2) of TFIIE in vitro (17Sakurai H. Fukasawa T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32663-32669Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 18Sakurai H. Kim Y.-J. Ohishi T. Kornberg R.D. Fukasawa T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 9488-9492Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). It was therefore interesting to analyze the effect of Tfa2 on the interaction between domain A and TFIIH. As shown in Fig.2 A (lanes 3–5), the addition of increasing amounts of Tfa2 to the mixture containing GST/domain A and TFIIH resulted in decreases in the Tfb1 subunit in the bound fractions. However, a Tfa2 derivative, Tfa2-N302, which lacks the domain A-binding region in Tfa2 (17Sakurai H. Fukasawa T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32663-32669Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), showed a marginal effect on TFIIH binding (lane 6). The domain A-TFIIH interaction was inhibited specifically with Tfa2, suggesting that both TFIIH and Tfa2 bind the identical or an overlapping region in domain A of Gal11. To further analyze the effect of TFIIE on the Gal11-TFIIH interaction, GST/Gal11-immobilized resin was incubated with TFIIH in the presence or absence of TFIIE subunits (Fig. 2 B). In this experiment, the amount of immobilized GST/Gal11 was reduced such that ∼30% of input Tfb1 was retained on the resin (lane 5). In accordance with the experiment in Fig. 2 A, the addition of Tfa2 caused a decrease in Tfb1 in the bound fraction and an increase in the unbound fraction (compare lanes 5 and 6). By contrast, Tfa1 (large subunit) slightly stimulated the binding of TFIIH to the GST/Gal11 resin (lane 7), and the Gal11-TFIIH interaction was significantly enhanced by the addition of both TFIIE subunits (lane 8). Because Tfa1 binds both Gal11 (17Sakurai H. Fukasawa T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32663-32669Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 18Sakurai H. Kim Y.-J. Ohishi T. Kornberg R.D. Fukasawa T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 9488-9492Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) and TFIIH (31Bushnell D.A. Bamdad C. Kornberg R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20170-20174Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), Tfa1 would be capable of bridging the Gal11-TFIIH interaction. It is therefore tempting to assume that Gal11, TFIIE, and TFIIH form a ternary complex. Further experiments are required to test this notion,e.g. by isolating the Gal11·TFIIE·TFIIH complex. Note that Tfa2 inhibited the Gal11-TFIIH interaction and that such an inhibitory effect was not observed in the presence of Tfa1 (comparelanes 6 and 8). Perhaps, conformation of Tfa2 changes through binding to Tfa1, which would alleviate the inhibitory effect on the Gal11-TFIIH interaction. Previously, we have shown that cells producing a TFIIE mutant lacking the Gal11-binding regions (TFIIE-ΔC) show phenotypes similar to those ofgal11 (gal11 Δ) null strains (17Sakurai H. Fukasawa T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32663-32669Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The combination of TFIIE-ΔC withgal11 Δ did not enhance the phenotypes of either single mutation, suggesting that TFIIE and Gal11 function through a common pathway in transcription (17Sakurai H. Fukasawa T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32663-32669Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Here we analyzed phenotypes of gal11 Δ cells when combined with a temperature-sensitive mutation in the TFA1 gene (tfa1-21) (23Sakurai H. Ohishi T. Fukasawa T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15936-15942Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). A TRP1-marked plasmid harboring the tfa1-21 gene was introduced intotfa1 Δ gal11 Δ cells containing a wild-type TFA1 plasmid marked withURA3. To shuffle out the TFA1-bearing plasmid, transformants were replica-plated onto medium containing 5-FOA. As shown in Fig. 3 A, transformants failed to grow on a 5-FOA-containing plate, indicating that cells containing both the tfa1-21 andgal11 null mutations are nonviable. We next analyzed the effect of the combination of tfa1-21 with a null mutation in MED2, PGD1, or SIN4, encoding Mediator subunits that are known to form a subcomplex with Gal11 (3Lee Y.C. Kim Y.-J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5364-5370Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 4Lee Y.C. Park J.M. Min S. Han S.J. Kim Y.-J. Mol. Cell.

A. 1995; 92: 10864-10868Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). A null mutation in either MED2 orPGD1 caused lethality in a tfa1-21background, whereas sin4 Δ tfa1-21 was viable (Fig. 3 A). We further studied interactions between Tfa1 and the Mediator subunits by examining whether the lethal phenotype of cells containing double mutations, i.e. tfa1-21 and a null mutation in one of the Mediator components, could be suppressed by overexpressing a heterogeneous Mediator component (Fig. 3 B). The synthetic lethality of tfa1-21 gal11 Δ was not suppressed by introducing MED2, PGD1, or SIN4 with a high-copy plasmid. Interestingly, the lethality oftfa1-21 med2 Δ andtfa1-21 pgd1 Δ was suppressed by introducing GAL11 with a high-copy plasmid. These results suggest that Gal11 becomes indispensable for growth intfa1-21 cells and that Gal11 is functionally impaired in tfa1-21 med2 Δ andtfa1-21 pgd1 Δ cells despite the fact that Gal11 should be produced in these cells (see “Discussion”). TheKIN28 gene encodes the CTD kinase subunit of TFIIH (32Feaver W.J. Svejstrup J.Q. Henry N.L. Kornberg R.D. Cell. 1994; 79: 1103-1109Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). A search for mutations co-lethal with a temperature-sensitive mutation in that gene (kin28-ts3) led to the discovery of genetic interactions between KIN28 and various genes such asSIN4; TFIIH subunit-encoding CCL1,RIG2/TFB3, and RAD3; and molecular chaperone-encoding STI1 and CDC37 (33Valay J.G. Simon M. Dubois M.F. Bensaude O. Facca C. Faye G. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 249: 535-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 34Faye G. Simon M. Valay J.G. Fesquet D. Facca C. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1997; 255: 460-466Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Because Gal11 is involved in the regulation of CTD phosphorylation by TFIIH (19Sakurai H. Fukasawa T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9534-9538Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), we suspected that GAL11 could genetically interact with KIN28 as well. We then constructed thekin28-ts3 gal11 Δ strain containingGAL11 on a URA3-marked plasmid. Cells were transformed with either a plasmid harboring GAL11 or a vacant vector, and the requirement of GAL11 for growth was tested by a plasmid shuffling experiment. As shown in Fig.3 C, transformants harboring the vacant vector failed to grow on a 5-FOA-containing plate, indicating that cells containing bothkin28-ts3 and gal11 Δ mutations are non-viable. This synthetic lethal phenotype was not suppressed by overexpressing MED2, PGD1, orSIN4. To explore which step of the transcription process is impaired by thetfa1-21 and gal11 Δmutations, we employed the in vivo potassium permanganate footprint technique (Fig. 4). Base modification by KMnO4 occurs preferentially in T residues in single-stranded DNA; and therefore, this reagent has been used for analysis of the open polymerase complex and polymerase paused complex (28Giardina C. Perez-Riba M. Lis J.T. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 2190-2200Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 29Giardina C. Lis J.T.

Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 5652-5658Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Since both TFIIE and Gal11 are necessary for full activation of GAL7 by Gal4 in response to galactose (18Sakurai H. Kim Y.-J. Ohishi T. Kornberg R.D. Fukasawa T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 9488-9492Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar,23Sakurai H. Ohishi T. Fukasawa T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15936-15942Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), we analyzed the effects of the tfa1-21 andgal11 Δ mutations on structural change of theGAL7 promoter. When wild-type TFA1 cells were grown in glucose medium, KMnO4-reactive T residues were observed at nucleotides −7 and −9 on the bottom strand ofGAL7 (Fig. 4 A, lane 1). Under the galactose-induced condition, every T residue from nucleotides −33 to +26 became hypersensitive to KMnO4 (lane 2). On the top strand, reactive T residues were detected at nucleotides −31 and −40 in glucose-grown cells, and the addition of galactose induced reactivity of T residues from nucleotides −42 to +17 (lanes 7 and 8). As summarized in Fig.5, activation of GAL7 caused the creation of a hypersensitive region ∼70 bases in length initiated at 21 base p"

This long (600 nucleotides) leader contains several short open reading frames (sORFs) and folds into an extended hairpin structure with three main stable stem sections. Translation initiation downstream of the leader is cap-dependent and occurs via ribosomal shunt under the control of two cis elements, a short open reading frame A (sORF A) followed by stem section 1. Here we show that a second similar configuration comprising sORF B followed by stem section 2 also allows shunting. The efficiency of the secondary shunt was greatly increased when stem section 1 was destabilized. In addition, we present evidence that a significant fraction of reinitiation-competent ribosomes that escape both shunt events migrate linearly via the structured central region but are intercepted by internal AUG start codons.

Sci. 1990; 87: 8301-8305Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). Reinitiation in eukaryotes appears to be inefficient and one or two small upstream ORFs1 (uORFs) can reduce protein yields considerably, whereas long ORFs will usually abolish it (2Kozak M. Gene. 1999; 234: 187-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (1116) Google Scholar, 4Kozak M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 3438-3445Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar, 5Fütterer J. Hohn T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 3851-3857Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The ability of ribosomes to reinitiate translation at downstream AUGs after scanning correlates negatively with the length of the upstream ORF (5Fütterer J. Hohn T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 3851-3857Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 6Luukkonen B.G. Tan W. Schwartz S. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 4086-4094Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Longer intergenic distances favor reinitiation (4Kozak M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 3438-3445Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar, 6Luukkonen B.G. Tan W. Schwartz S. J.

It is thought that initiation factors dissociate from the ribosome upon each initiation event, and the limiting parameter for subsequent reinitiation is the time needed to reacquire these factors (8Merrick W.C. Enzyme. 1990; 44: 1217-122513Crossref Scopus (21) Google Scholar). In the case of multiple short uORFs, ribosomes can bypass (or scan through) other uORFs after translation of the first one and become competent to translate a main ORF located further downstream. The best known example is the regulated translation of the GCN4 mRNA in yeast. In this case, ribosomes must translate the 5′ proximal uORF, uORF 1, then resume scanning to reinitiate at either uORF 4 or at the main ORF depending on the availability of the eIF-2/GTP/Met-tRNAiMet ternary complex (9Dever T.E. Feng L. Wek R.C. Cigan A.M. Donahue T.F. Hinnebusch A.G. Cell. 1992; 68: 585-596Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (559) Google Scholar). An alternative strategy used by a number of cellular mRNAs and many viruses involves direct ribosome binding at the mRNA start codon (or upstream of it) mediated by an internal ribosome entry site (10Belsham G.J.

A second alternative to the linear scanning route is a ribosome shunt, as shown for the RNAs of Sendai virus (12Curran J. Kolakofsky D.

The shunt process allows ribosomes to bypass RNA regions that may include AUG codons and secondary structures inhibiting linear migration (for review, see Ref.20Hohn T. Dominguez D.I.

The CaMV 35 S RNA leader contains seven to eight sORFs and folds into an elongated hairpin structure comprising three main stem sections (21Hemmings-Mieszczak M. Steger G. Hohn T. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 267: 1075-11088Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). It does not function as an internal ribosome entry site when placed between two cistrons (22Dominguez D.I. Ryabova L.A.

Expression downstream of the 35 S RNA leader occurs via ribosome shunt, which requires three ciselements within the leader, a capped 5′ end (14Fütterer J. Gordon K. Sanfaçon H. Bonneville J.M.

Chem. 2000; 275: 17288-17296Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The elongated hairpin structure promotes shunting by bringing the shunt “take off” and “landing” sites into close spatial proximity (15Fütterer J. Kiss-László Z. Hohn T.

Shunting does not require viral or specific host factors, because it functions in plant protoplasts, wheat germ extract, and reticulocyte lysate (14Fütterer J. Gordon K. Sanfaçon H. Bonneville J.M.

In this study we applied in vitro and in vivotranslation systems to study the mechanisms by which the complex leader of the CaMV 35 S RNA regulates polycistronic translation from this RNA. Inspection of the CaMV leader sequence revealed that the combination of an sORF followed by a stem section is repeated (sORF B/stem section 2; see Fig. 1 B). In this paper we show that this second configuration also supports shunting. We also demonstrate that ribosome migration controlled by the CaMV 35 S RNA leader is characterized by both continuous and discontinuous scanning. Plasmid LmF-CAT (Lm) containing the T7 promoter, the whole CaMV S strain (28Franck A. Guilley H. Jonard G. Richards K.E. Hirth L. Cell. 1980; 21: 285-294Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar) leader carrying a deletion of A592 (numbering is from the 5′ end of the 35 S RNA), and the CAT reporter gene fused to the AUG of ORF VII were described previously (22Dominguez D.I.

A series of derivatives lacking parts of the leader or having mutated leader sequences are listed in TableI. The insertion of a double-stranded oligonucleotide between theClaI–NcoI sites in Lm yielded L/AUG569 resulting in insertion of an AUG codon just downstream of the shunt landing site. Mutation of the sORF A stop codon was achieved by the insertion of oligonucleotides of the desired sequence between the XhoI–NheI sites in Lm resulting in an A::B fusion ORF, (LsA::B). In Lst1− and Lst1−/AUG569, stem section 1 is disrupted with several point mutations as described previously (22Dominguez D.I. Ryabova L.A. Pooggin M.M. Schmidt-Puchta W. Fütterer J. Hohn T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3669-3678Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). To create a deletion mutant of stem section 1 with an A*B ORF fusion, LsA*B, a truncatedXhoI–SpeI fragment lacking positions 72–112 was introduced into Lm. To remove the sORF F′ start codon in LsA*B, theBglII–ClaI fragments were replaced by polymerase chain reaction-amplified fragments with mutations of A529 to g and G531 to a, to yield plasmid LsA*B/F′−. Clone LsA*B/st2a− was made by the insertion of a double-stranded oligonucleotide between theNheI–SpeI sites in LsA*B. Constructs LsA*B/st2c* and LsA*B/st2c− were made by replacing theSpeI–BglII fragment of LsA*B with appropriate oligonucleotides (see Fig. 2 C). Cassette mutagenesis of combinations of individual sORFs (AUG start codons were replaced by UAG stop codons) in LsA*B was carried out by insertion of double-stranded oligonucleotides between the XhoI–SpeI sites resulting in constructs LsA−*B, LsA*B−, LsA−*B−, and LsA*B::C. Plasmids LsE−, LsD−E−, LsD−E−E′−, LsA*B/E−, LsA*B/D−E−, and LsA*B/D−E−E′− containing point mutations in the AUG codons of sORFs (see Fig. 3 B) were subcloned as BglII–ClaI fragments from the leader of strain CM4–184, where these mutations had been introduced by polymerase chain reaction-mediated mutagenesis (25Pooggin M.M.

Plasmids LCwt and LCwt/F′− containing the 35 S RNA promoter and the complete CaMV leader with and without sORF F′ AUG were derived from LC20 (14Fütterer J. Gordon K. Sanfaçon H. Bonneville J.M. Hohn T. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 1697-170715Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) by subcloning BglII–ClaI fragments of LsA*B and LsA*B/F′−, respectively. Plasmids LCsA*B and LCsA*B/F′− differ from LCwt and LCwt/F′−, respectively, by a deletion of stem section 1 (from position 70 to 110), creating an A*B fusion sORF, and were constructed by introducing the same BglII–ClaI fragments into a pLC20 derivative carrying the deletion (kindly provided by Dr. J. Fütterer). RNA secondary structure analysis was performed using theMFOLD program (Wisconsin Package, Version 6.0; Genetics Group, Madison, WI) at 25 °C (29Zuker M. Methods Enzymol. 1989; 180: 262-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar). T7 plasmids were linearized withAcc65I and transcribed in the presence of the cap analogue7mGpppG (in 6-fold excess over GTP) by incubation with T7 RNA polymerase (Biofinex), according to the protocol of Gurevich (30Gurevich V.V. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 275: 382-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The integrity of the synthesized transcripts was evaluated on a 6% denaturing polyacrylamide gel. RNA was quantified by measuring absorbance at 260 nm. Wheat germ extract was prepared according to Roberts and Paterson (31Roberts B.E. Paterson B.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1973; 70: 2330-2334Crossref PubMed Scopus (936) Google Scholar). Rabbit reticulocyte lysate (gel-filtered) was from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. 0.1 pmol/μl of each transcript was used for in vitro translation. The capped mRNA has been shown to be relatively stable during 40 min of incubation in vitro (26Ryabova L.A. Hohn T. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 817-829PubMed Google Scholar). In vitro translation reactions with wheat germ extract (WGE) or rabbit reticulocyte lysate (RRL) were performed as described in (26Ryabova L.A. Hohn T. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 817-829PubMed Google Scholar). 3 μl of translation reaction mixtures were resolved on high cross-linking (16.5% T (total percentage concentration of acrylamide and bisacrylamide) and 6% C (percentage concentration of the cross-linker)) Tricine-SDS polyacrylamide gels as described by Schagger and von Jagow (32Schagger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-37931Crossref PubMed Scopus (10410) Google Scholar). Gels were fixed in the presence of 10% glycerol, dried at 50 °C overnight, and exposed to x-ray film (Fuji). Gels were also analyzed using a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). The transient expression experiments in Orychophragmus violaceusprotoplasts were performed as described (27Pooggin M.M. Hohn T. Fütterer J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17288-17296Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). CAT-expressing plasmids (10 μg) were always cotransfected with 2.5 μg of β-glucuronidase-expressing plasmid (pV594) to serve as an internal standard of transfection efficiency. For transactivation, 5 μg of plasmid pHELP7 (33Bonneville J. Sanfaçon H. Fütterer J. Hohn T. Cell. 1989; 59: 1135-1143Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar) expressing the TAV protein was also added. For each CAT construct, transfections were repeated three times (± TAV) in independent batches of protoplasts. CAT expression was always calculated relative to the β-glucuronidase activity of internal controls. CAT protein levels and β-glucuronidase activities were measured by a CAT ELISA assay (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and a 4-methylumbelliteryl β-d-glucuronide fluorimetric assay, respectively. Our basic test construct (Lm; Fig.1, A and B) contains the CaMV leader with a frameshift mutation in sORF F bringing it in frame with ORF VII, which it normally overlaps (LCwt; Fig.1 A). Thus, the sORF F start codon, the internal F′ AUG, and several functional non-AUG codons (26Ryabova L.A. Hohn T. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 817-829PubMed Google Scholar) are in-frame with the start codon of ORF VII (see Fig. 1, A and B). In this study the CAT reporter gene was placed downstream of the CaMV leader at the position of the original ORF VII. In a WGE translation system, a battery of CAT-related bands corresponding to initiation events at these start codons is revealed (Fig. 1 D, lane 1). Some of the following are produced by shunting via stem section 1: N::CAT, N′::CAT, N""::CAT, and CAT; these start codons are located downstream of the shunt landing site (26Ryabova L.A. Hohn T. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 817-829PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, because the F and F′ AUGs are located upstream of the main shunt landing site, they must be reached either by linearly migrating ribosomes or by a secondary shunt event. Previous results have shown that integrity of stem section 1 is critical for an efficient ribosome shunt (22Dominguez D.I. Ryabova L.A. Pooggin M.M. Schmidt-Puchta W. Fütterer J. Hohn T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3669-3678Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 26Ryabova L.A. Hohn T. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 817-829PubMed Google Scholar). Indeed, disruption of stem section 1 by destabilizing mutations (Lst1−) or by ribosomes translating an elongated A::B fusion ORF, LsA::B, results in a substantial decrease in synthesis of CAT, N::CAT, N′::CAT, and N""::CAT proteins (Fig. 1 D, lanes 2 and3). In both cases, the major initiation event now takes place at the AUG of F′. Given that the upstream start codon of F is in a better initiation context (ggaAUGc) than that of F′ (cuaAUGa, lacking a purine at position −3 and a guanosine at position +4, with respect to the A of the start codon (2Kozak M. Gene. 1999; 234: 187-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (1116) Google Scholar)), it is unlikely that F′::CAT ORF is translated only by linearly migrating ribosomes. An extra AUG codon inserted just downstream of the shunt landing site at the position of the first non-AUG codon (L/AUG569) was efficiently recognized by shunting ribosomes, whereas expression from the downstream CAT ORF was inhibited (Fig. 1 D, lane 4). Recognition of AUG569 was impaired by mutations destabilizing stem section 1 (Lst1−/AUG569; Fig. 1 D, lane 5) proving that shunting ribosomes rather than scanning ribosomes utilize this AUG. Again, there was a concomitant increase in translation from the F′ AUG. Thus, the start codon of sORF F′ is preferentially recognized in mutants with a destabilized stem section 1 despite the presence of the remaining structured regions of the leader and multiple internal sORFs. One explanation could be that the F′ AUG is recognized via an alternative shunt event at the base of stem section 2 initiated by ribosomes that have translated sORFs B or A::B. To test this hypothesis, a stem section 1 deletion mutant was constructed in which the 5′ arm of stem section 1 was removed. This deletion removes the region between sORFs A and B resulting in a novel sORF, sORF A*B (LsA*B). The predicted secondary structure of this construct is shown in Fig. 1 C. Our model places a putative second shunt landing site between the F and F′ AUGs. The main polypeptide translated from this mRNA comigrated with F′::CAT polypeptides translated from Lst1−mRNA (Fig. 1 E, cf. lanes 1and2). To ensure that the start codon of sORF F′ is the real start site of the observed fusion polypeptide, this AUG was mutated to GUA. As a result, the F′::CAT band disappeared, and there was a concomitant increase in CAT ORF expression (Fig.1 E, lane 3). We assume that ribosomes that would have otherwise recognized the F′ AUG now scan further downstream and initiate efficiently at the CAT AUG. Initiation of translation in LsA*B occurred also at F AUG with an efficiency of ∼20% (Fig. 1 E, lane 2). Most likely, translation-competent ribosomes could reach this AUG by a scanning-reinitiation process in contrast to initiation via shunting at the internal F′ AUG. Insertion of a strong hairpin into theBglII site (see Fig. 1 C) in the center of the LsA*B and Lst1− constructs (LsA*B(ks) and Lst1−(ks)) abolished F::CAT translation, indicating that the AUG of F is indeed recognized by ribosomes linearly migrating through stem section 3 (Fig. 1 E, lanes 4 and 5). In contrast, translation of F′::CAT was only slightly affected by the scanning-inhibiting stable stem, thus supporting our hypothesis that F′::CAT is translated via an alternative ribosomal shunt. sORF A*B in LsA*B contains two in-frame AUGs, one at the start position and one at the original start codon of sORF B (now internal). These were mutated to stop codons in different combinations (Fig. 2 A). Removal of the first AUG (LsA−*B) revealed that the 9-nt-long sORF B alone can promote shunting more efficiently than the longer 18-nt sORF A*B fusion (Fig. 2 B, lanes 1 and 2). CAT, but not F::CAT, expression was also increased in this mutant, perhaps because of leaky scanning through the AUG of F′. Removal of both AUGs together (LsA−*B−), or elongation of sORF A*B until the stop codon of sORF C (LsA*B::C), had a strong inhibitory effect on F′::CAT production (Fig. 2 B, lanes 3and 4), confirming the requirement of a sORF terminating in front of stem section 2 for efficient second shunt. We subdivided stem section 2 into the following 3 regions as indicated in Fig. 1 C; 2a (upstream of sORF C), 2b (sORF C), and 2c (downstream of sORF C; st2a, st2b, and st2c). The base paired regions, 2a or 2c, were destroyed separately by introduction of point mutations into the left arm of st 2 (LsA*B/st2a− and LsA*B/st2c−; Fig. 2 C). Disruption of st2a in the LsA*B construct caused an increase in F::CAT production and a significant reduction of F′::CAT synthesis (Fig.2 D, lane 2), suggesting that it is a key element for the alternative shunt. Disruption of st 2c was less inhibitory (Fig. 2 D, lane 3). Stabilization of st 2c (mutant LsA*B/st2c*) caused a roughly 2-fold increase in F′::CAT protein production (Fig. 2 D, lane 4), with concomitant reduction of F::CAT protein production. Thus, destabilization of stem section 2 led to a higher level of F::CAT ORF translation and a lower level of F′ CAT ORF translation, whereas stabilization had the opposite effect, indicating that linear migration of ribosomes through stem section 2, as well as the second shunt, was affected. In summary, there is strong evidence that the combination of sORF B and stem section 2 promotes an alternative shunt event in the structured region of the CaMV 35 S RNA leader. To address whether the second shunt operates in vivo, CaMV leader-CAT transcription units were introduced into expression vectors under the control of the 35 S RNA promoter and terminator (see “Materials and Methods”). To visualize the second shunt-mediated expression, we took advantage of the natural configuration of sORF F′ that overlaps, and therefore down-regulates, the first ORF following the leader (ORF VII in the viral context or the CAT ORF in this study). According to thein vitro results (Fig. 1 E, cf. lanes 2and 3), the sORF F′ AUG is first recognized by ribosomes arriving by the second shunt. These ribosomes translate sORF F′ and would therefore not initiate at the AUG of the CAT ORF. In the absence of the F′ AUG, translation would initiate at the CAT AUG. Because thein vivo expression system measures only translation of CAT protein, comparison of CAT expression levels in the presence and absence of the sORF F′ AUG indirectly measures the efficiency of the second shunt. CAT expression obtained with the wild type CaMV leader construct (LCwt; see Fig. 1 A) was set to 100% (TableII). Translation of CAT downstream of the wild type"

These proteins are encoded by two embedded genes, the VAChT gene lying within the first intron of the ChAT gene. In the nervous system, both ChAT and VAChT are synthesized only in cholinergic neurons, and it is therefore likely that the cell type-specific expression of their genes is coordinately regulated. It has been suggested that a 2336-base pair genomic region upstream from the ChAT and VAChT coding sequences drives ChAT gene expression in cholinergic structures. We investigated whether this region also regulates VAChT gene transcription. Transfection assays showed that this region strongly represses the activity of the native VAChT promoters in non-neuronal cells, but has no major effect in neuronal cells whether or not they express the endogenous ChAT and VAChT genes. The silencer activity of this region is mediated solely by a repressor element 1 or neuron-restrictive silencer element (RE1/NRSE). Moreover, several proteins, including RE1-silencing transcription factor or neuron-restrictive silencer factor, are recruited by this regulatory sequence.

The expression of ChAT and VAChT proteins is tightly linked. Both ChAT and VAChT are absolutely required for cholinergic neurotransmission (1Rand J.B. Russell R.L. Genetics. 1984; 106: 227-248Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and, in the nervous system, these proteins are only synthesized in cholinergic cells. Moreover, ChAT and VAChT are both expressed from the same gene locus, referred to as “cholinergic gene locus.” Indeed, in nematode,Drosophila, and mammals, the VAChT gene resides within the first intron of the ChAT gene and in the same transcriptional orientation (Fig. 1; Refs. 2Alfonso A.

In this species, the 5′ end of the ChAT gene is composed of three non-coding exons, designated R, N, and M, that are alternatively contained into five different mRNAs (Fig. 1; Ref. 7Kengaku M. Misawa H. Deguchi T. Brain Res. Mol. Brain Res. 1993; 18: 71-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). These transcripts are generated from several promoters, two of them lying upstream from exons R and M (Fig. 1; Refs. 8Ibanez C. Persson H. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1991; 3: 1309-1315Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 9Bejanin S. Habert E. Berrard S. Edwards J.B. Loeffler J.P. Mallet J. J.

Multiple promoter regions have also been identified for the VAChT gene and give rise to five VAChT mRNAs with different 5′-untranslated sequences. One promoter, located upstream from the exon R, may be common to the ChAT gene, whereas two VAChT-specific promoters lie downstream from this exon (Fig. 1; Refs. 3Bejanin S. Cervini R. Mallet J.

This unusual organization for two functionally related mammalian genes suggests that the ChAT and VAChT genes may be co-regulated. Indeed, coordinated up-regulation of ChAT and VAChT transcripts by various extracellular factors such as leukemia inhibitory factor, ciliary neurotrophic factor, retinoic acid, cAMP, glucocorticoids, nerve growth factor, and even stress has been demonstrated (12Berrard S.

Kawashima K. J. Neurosci. Res. 1999; 57: 381-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Moreover, several studies have reported that, in most regions of the central nervous system, ChAT and VAChT mRNAs and proteins have a comparable anatomical distribution and are co-localized within the same neurons (20Schäfer M.K. Weihe E. Varoqui H. Eiden L.E. Erickson J.D. J. Mol. Neurosci. 1994; 5: 1-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 21Schäfer M.K. Weihe E. Erickson J.D. Eiden L.E. J. Mol.

Therefore, the ChAT and VAChT genes may share transcriptional regulatory sequences that restrict their expression to cholinergic neurons. Transient transfection experiments previously revealed that the 3-kilobase pair genomic sequence upstream from the translation initiation site of VAChT (regions 2 and 3, Fig. 2) does not contain such regulatory DNA sequences (8Ibanez C. Persson H. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1991; 3: 1309-1315Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 11Cervini R. Houhou L. Pradat P.F. Bejanin S. Mallet J. Berrard S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24654-24657Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). In contrast, various data suggest that a 2336-bp region just upstream and designated region 1 (Fig. 2) regulates the cholinergic neuron-specific expression of the ChAT gene. (i) In non-neuronal cells, in vitro, this region is able to repress the activity of the ChAT/VAChT promoter region 2, as well as that of a heterologous promoter (8Ibanez C. Persson H. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1991; 3: 1309-1315Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 24Lönnerberg P. Schoenherr C.J. Anderson D.J. Ibanez C.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 33358-33365Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar); (ii) in transgenic mice, region 1 drove the expression of a downstream heterologous promoter in various cholinergic structures (25Lönnerberg P. Lendahl U. Funakoshi H. Arhlund-Richter L. Persson H. Ibanez C.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4046-4050Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar); (iii) the pattern of transgene expression in the brain of these mice paralleled both qualitatively and quantitatively that of endogenous ChAT mRNAs; and (iv) in spinal cord, transgene expression was developmentally regulated, similarly to the endogenous ChAT gene. Region 1 contains a 21-bp sequence homologous to the neuron-restrictive silencer element (NRSE, Ref. 26Mori N. Schoenherr C. Vandenbergh D.J. Anderson D.J. Neuron. 1992; 9: 45-54Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar) of the SCG10 gene or repressor element 1 (RE1, Ref. 27Kraner S.D. Chong J.A. Tsay H.J. Mandel G. Neuron. 1992; 9: 37-44Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar) of the type II sodium channel gene. A similar motif is present in the regulatory regions of several other genes whose expression is restricted to neurons (28Schoenherr C.J. Paquette A.J. Anderson D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 9881-9886Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). The transcription factor that binds RE1/NRSE is a zinc-finger repressor protein designated REST (for RE1-silencing transcription factor, Ref. 29Chong J.A. Tapia-Ramirez J. Kim S. Toledo-Aral J.J. Zheng Y. Boutros M.C. Altshuller Y.M. Frohman M.A. Kraner S.D. Mandel G. Cell. 1995; 80: 949-957Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (906) Google Scholar) or NRSF (for neuron-restrictive silencer factor, Ref. 30Schoenherr C.J. Anderson D.J. Science. 1995; 267: 1360-1363Crossref PubMed Scopus (910) Google Scholar). REST/NRSF mRNA and protein have been detected in a majority of non-neuronal cell types and in undifferentiated neuronal progenitors (29Chong J.A. Tapia-Ramirez J. Kim S. Toledo-Aral J.J. Zheng Y. Boutros M.C. Altshuller Y.M. Frohman M.A. Kraner S.D. Mandel G. Cell. 1995; 80: 949-957Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (906) Google Scholar, 30Schoenherr C.J. Anderson D.J. Science. 1995; 267: 1360-1363Crossref PubMed Scopus (910) Google Scholar), suggesting that REST/NRSF prevents full expression of the neuronal phenotype during early neurogenesis. In addition, REST/NRSF mRNA is differentially expressed in mature neurons of the adult brain (31Palm K. Belluardo N. Metsis M. Timmusk T. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 1280-1296Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). REST/NRSF may thus be also required for the differential expression of target genes in different neuronal subpopulations. The RE1/NRSE of region 1, in vitro, represses the expression of a heterologous downstream promoter in non-neuronal cells by binding REST/NRSF (24Lönnerberg P. Schoenherr C.J. Anderson D.J. Ibanez C.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 33358-33365Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). We investigated whether region 1 and more specifically RE1/NRSE are also involved in the cell-specific regulation of the VAChT gene expression in the rat. Transient transfections of non-neuronal and neuronal-like cells revealed that region 1 and RE1/NRSE are parts of a regulatory mechanism that strongly represses VAChT gene expression in non-neuronal cells, but not in neuronal cells. We also demonstrated the existence in non-neuronal cells of several nuclear proteins or protein complexes that interact specifically with this silencer element. Region 1 and RE1/NRSE may thus co-regulate both ChAT and VAChT gene expression. Moreover, the cholinergic specific expression of VAChT gene requires the contribution of additional control elements of the cholinergic gene locus. Total RNA was purified from indicated cell lines by the RNable method (Eurobio) and quantified spectrophotometrically. Single-stranded cDNAs were synthesized with avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase (Promega) using 1 μg of RNA as the template and random hexamers (pd(N)6, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) as primers. Reactions without RNA or without reverse transcriptase were used as controls. A Prolabo thermal cycler was used for PCR with one eighth of the reverse transcription reaction mix as template and Taq DNA polymerase (Promega), as described previously (12Berrard S. Varoqui H. Cervini R. Israël M. Mallet J. Diebler M.F. J. Neurochem. 1995; 65: 939-942Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). The number of PCR cycles was 22 for G3PDH, 32 for VAChT, and 35 for ChAT and REST/NRSF cDNA amplifications. The sequences of the primers used are as follows: ChAT (+), GTCTTGGATGTTGTCATTAATTTC; ChAT (−), TCTCTGGTAAAGCCTGTAGTAAGC; VAChT (+), CACCAAACTGTCGGAAGCGGTG; VAChT(−), GCAGCGAAGAGCGTGGCATAGTC; REST/NRSF (+), GAGTCTGAAGAACAGTTCGTACAT; REST/NRSF (−), CTTGAAGTTGCTCCTATCGGCTGT; G3PDH (+), ACCACAGTCCATGCCATCAC; G3PDH (−), TCCACCACCCTGTTGCTGTA. Various fragments of the promoter region of the rat VAChT gene (Fig. 2) were subcloned into the promoterless plasmid KSluc, upstream from the luciferase reporter gene and downstream from a transcription terminator. The KSluc was constructed by W. Faust and A. M. Catherin. 2W. Faust and A. M. Catherin, unpublished results. To simplify the plasmid nomenclature, we designated as 1, 2, and 3 the 2336-bpEcoRI/HindIII fragment upstream from the VAChT gene promoters, the 1895-bp HindIII/HindIII fragment containing the ChAT/VAChT promoter upstream from exon R, and the 1026-bpHindIII/SphI fragment containing the two VAChT promoters downstream from exon R, respectively (Fig. 2). DNA fragments 2, 3, 23, and 123 were prepared by appropriate digestion of a largerEcoRI/EcoRI genomic fragment of 7334 bp, obtained from a rat ChAT/VAChT genomic λEMBL3 clone isolated previously (9Bejanin S. Habert E. Berrard S. Edwards J.B. Loeffler J.P. Mallet J. J. Neurochem. 1992; 58: 1580-1583Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) and subcloned into pBSKS+ (Bluescript; Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). These fragments were inserted into the uniqueHindIII site of KSluc to generate the reporter plasmids designated pl-2, pl-3, pl-23, and pl-123, respectively. The plasmid pl-m123, which contains a two-base substitution mutation in the RE1/NRSE sequence, was generated from pl-123 by mutagenesis using theCLONTECH Transformer site-directed mutagenesis kit. The plasmids pl-13 and pl-m13 were obtained from pl-123 and pl-m123, respectively, by excision of fragment 2 by HindIII digestion, followed by self-ligation of the plasmids. Cloning junctions and the RE1/NRSE mutation were confirmed by DNA sequence analysis. Two complementary oligonucleotides (cgcgTCCAGCACCACGGACAGTTCCa and cgcgtGGAACTGTCCGTGGTGCTGGA) containing the sequence of the region 1 RE1/NRSE flanked by MluI restriction sites, were annealed. The resulting double-stranded oligonucleotide was inserted into theMluI site of the pPGK-luc vector, described in Ref. 32Millecamps S. Kiefer H. Navarro V. Geoffroy M.C. Robert J.J. Finiels F. Mallet J. Barkats M. Nat. Biotechnol. 1999; 17: 865-869Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, upstream from the phosphoglycerate kinase (PGK) promoter, to generate pPGK-luc-1, or oligomerized four times in the same orientation to create pPGK-luc-4. The number and orientation of the RE1/NRSE were checked by PCR and sequencing. Plasmid DNA was purified either by two successive equilibrium centrifugations in CsCl gradients followed by a 48-h dialysis against water, or by using the Jetstar plasmid purification system (Genomed). DNA was quantified spectrophotometrically and by scanning pictures of ethidium bromide-stained DNA after migration on 1% agarose gel. The cell lines FR3T3 (Fisher rat fibroblast), N2A (mouse neuroblastoma), and NG108-15 (mouse neuroblastoma N18TG-2 × rat glioma C6BU-1) were grown at 37 °C in a 7% (NG108-15) or 5% (N2A, FR3T3) CO2 atmosphere in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) with 10% fetal calf serum (ATGC, Inc.). For NG108-15, the culture medium was supplemented with 1 mm sodium pyruvate, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 1× HAT solution (100 μm hypoxanthine, 0.4 μm aminopterin, 16 μm thymidine). Transfections were performed by the calcium phosphate precipitation method (N2A and NG108-15) or by electroporation with a single electrical pulse at 240 V using a Bio-Rad Gene Pulser (FR3T3). Cells (106) were transfected with mixtures of 1 pmol of each reporter plasmid, 4 μg of a SV40 promoter-chloramphenicol acetyltransferase vector (pCAT3-Control Vector, Promega) as an internal control to correct for differences in transfection efficiency, and a carrier DNA (pBluescript, Stratagene) to give a total amount of 12 μg of DNA. For N2A and NG108-15 cells, medium was changed 16 h after transfection. Cells were harvested 40 h after transfection. Luciferase activity was normalized with chloramphenicol acetyltransferase activity determined in the same extract (33Boularand S. Darmon M.C. Ravassard P. Mallet J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3757-3764Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). For each cell line, five to eight independent transfection experiments were performed. In each experiment, constructs were transfected in triplicate. For each construct, at least three independently prepared plasmid DNA samples were used. When the normalized activities driven by different constructs were compared, all the plasmids were prepared the same day. The data were analyzed by using the SAS statistical software (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC). Differences between the different groups (cell lines and/or constructs) were tested by analysis of variance (SAS/GLM procedure). The p-values corresponding to the two by two comparison were also computed (SAS/Ismeans and pdiff options; the test corresponds to the standardt test when no more than one explanatory factor is present). The homogeneity of the results according to the DNA preparation and the transfection experiment were tested by introducing these variables as explanatory factors into the analysis of variance models. Results obtained with small subsamples were checked by non-parametric tests. Nuclear extracts were prepared from 108 cells as already described (34Schreiber E. Matthias P. Muller M.M. Schaffner W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 6419Crossref PubMed Scopus (3903) Google Scholar) with the following modifications: (i) in buffers A and C, EDTA and EGTA were omitted and ZnSO4 was added to a final concentration of 1 μm, together with an additional mixture of protease inhibitors (0.1 unit/ml aprotinin, 1 μm pepstatin, 1 μm leupeptin, 1 mm iodoacetamide); (ii) nuclear extracts were dialyzed against buffer D (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 250 mmKCl, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 1 μm ZnSO4, 25% glycerol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mmiodoacetamide). Protein concentrations were determined using the Bio-Rad assay system. The probe was prepared using a 49-mer double-stranded oligonucleotide, labeled with [α-32P]dCTP by Klenow filling-in, and purified following electrophoresis on a 8% polyacrylamide gel. The binding reaction was performed in a final volume of 20 μl in buffer D containing 10% glycerol. Nuclear extracts (10 μg) were preincubated for 10 min on ice in buffer D complemented with 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 2 μg of poly(dI-dC), and 50 ng of sonicated single-stranded herring sperm DNA. The 32P-end-labeled probe (10 fmol) was added either with or without a molar excess of a competitor oligonucleotide as indicated, and the binding reaction was continued for another 20 min at room temperature. For supershift experiments, either preimmune serum (1 μg) or 1 or 2 μg of an anti-REST/NRSF polyclonal antibody (a generous gift from Dr. Gail Mandel, State University of New York, Stony Brook, NY) was preincubated with the binding reaction prior to addition of the probe. The DNA-protein complexes were resolved by electrophoresis on pre-run 6% native polyacrylamide gels in 0.25× Tris borate/EDTA buffer. The following chemically synthesized double-stranded oligonucleotides with SalI overhangs were used as probes or competitors (unrelated nucleotides are shown in lowercase letters, and mutated nucleotides are underlined): wtRE1/NRSE, tcgacTAGGAACTGTCCAGCACCACGGACAGTTCCGGGAGCCGCg; mRE1/NRSE, tcgacTAGGAACTGTCCAGCACCACTTACAGTTCCGGGAGCCGCg; Y-TPH, tcgacCCTTCTCATTGGCCGCTGCCCAGCTg. Our previous studies have shown that the rat VAChT gene can be transcribed from two distinct domains of the cholinergic gene locus: (i) one upstream from exon R (region 2, Fig.2), which also promotes the transcription of the ChAT gene (3Bejanin S. Cervini R. Mallet J. Berrard S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21944-21947Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Cervini R. Houhou L. Pradat P.F. Bejanin S. Mallet J. Berrard S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24654-24657Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar); (ii) one downstream from exon R (region 3, Fig. 2), which contains two distinct promoters for the VAChT gene. Both promoter regions 2 and 3 are constitutively functional in cholinergic cells, non-cholinergic neurons, and non-neuronal cells (11Cervini R. Houhou L. Pradat P.F. Bejanin S. Mallet J. Berrard S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24654-24657Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Here, we used transient transfections to examine the potential involvement of a 5′ upstream domain, region 1, in the regulation of the cell type-specific expression of the VAChT gene. Reporter plasmids were constructed, in which different combinations of the VAChT promoter regions 2 and 3, with or without region 1, were fused to the firefly luciferase reporter gene (Fig. 2). These constructs were used to transfect three murine cell lines chosen for their different properties: NG108-15 (a cholinergic hybrid line), N2A (a non-cholinergic neuroblastoma line), and FR3T3 (a non-neuronal fibroblast line). The presence of ChAT and VAChT mRNAs in NG108-15 was confirmed by RT-PCR experiments. These two transcripts were not detectable in N2A or FR3T3 (Fig. 3). These cell lines were also tested for the presence of REST/NRSF transcripts. In our PCR conditions, REST/NRSF mRNA was only detected in FR3T3 (Fig. 3), indicating that NG108-15 and N2A do not normally express high amounts of REST/NRSF and thus behave as neuronal cells. Numerous independent transfection experiments were performed in NG108-15, N2A, and FR3T3 with different sets of DNA preparations. When cells from the same line were transfected simultaneously with different plasmid preparations of a given construction, the normalized luciferase activities obtained were variable and thus dependent on the DNA preparation, whatever the cell line. Therefore, to compare the transcriptional activities of different constructs, each transfection experiment was carried out with plasmid DNAs that were all prepared at the same time and by the same protocol. However, in each cell line, the order of magnitude of normalized activities of the constructs varied from one experiment to another, whereas the ratio values between the normalized activities of two constructs were similar in the different experiments. We thus present the results of the normalized luciferase activities measured in several independent transient transfection experiments as ratio values obtained with different constructs On the basis of these results, two different statistical analysis were performed (Fig. 4). We first verified in NG108-15, N2A, and FR3T3 our previous observation in other cells (11Cervini R. Houhou L. Pradat P.F. Bejanin S. Mallet J. Berrard S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24654-24657Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) that the VAChT promoter regions 2 and 3 can be constitutively transcribed. This confirmed that both regions lack the regulatory motifs responsible for the cholinergic cell-specific expression of the VAChT gene. We next examined the influence of region 1 on the transcriptional activities of the VAChT promoter regions 2 and 3. As shown on Fig. 4(A and D) (ratios pl-123/pl-23 and pl-13/pl-3), the effect of region 1 in neuronal cells was significantly different from that in fibroblastic cells, whereas there was no major difference between its effects in cholinergic and non-cholinergic neuronal cells. In the NG108-15 cell line, transcription from the VAChT gene promoters of regions 2 and 3 together was slightly lower (25%) in the presence than absence of region 1 (Fig. 4 A). This reduction was not observed when region 1 was placed directly adjacent to region 3 (Fig.4 D). In N2A cell line, region 1 had no significant effect on the transcriptional activity of the whole VAChT promoter region 23 (Fig. 4 A), or on that of region 3 alone (Fig.4 D). Region 1 is thus ineffective in these cells. In contrast, region 1 substantially down-regulated the downstream VAChT promoters in fibroblastic cells FR3T3; the promoter activities of regions 23 and 3 were about 4-fold lower in the presence than the absence of region 1 (Fig. 4, A and D). Thus, this regulatory region exhibits a silencer function on the VAChT gene promoters, but only in non-neuronal cells. Note, however, that region 1 by itself was not sufficient to completely abolish these promoter activities in FR3T3 cells in our experimental conditions. Region 1 contains a sequence homologous to RE1/NRSE (24Lönnerberg P. Schoenherr C.J. Anderson D.J. Ibanez C.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 33358-33365Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), and this sequence may be responsible for repression of VAChT gene transcription in non-neuronal cells. The contribution of RE1/NRSE was explored by introducing point mutations into its sequence in the construct pl-123 and the chimeric construct pl-13. Two juxtaposing guanines near the center of RE1/NRSE were replaced by thymines. This mutation was previously shown to inactivate the RE1/NRSE motif of the SCG10 gene by abolishing the DNA binding of the repressor protein and thus its silencing activity (26Mori N. Schoenherr C.

Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 5303-5308Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar).Coupling between protein folding and allostery in the GroE system has recently been demonstrated in vitro (14Yifrach O. Horovitz A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 1521-1524Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The importance of the allosteric properties of GroEL for its function in vivoremains, however, unclear. It has been questioned due to (i) the fact that the allosteric transitions of GroEL take place in vitroat subphysiological (micromolar) concentrations of ATP (13Yifrach O. Horovitz A. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 5303-5308Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar), and (ii) the finding that the apical domain of GroEL, which is devoid of ATPase activity, is active in vivo (15Chatellier J. Hill F. Lund P.A. Fersht A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9861-9866Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). More recently, it has been demonstrated that the oligomeric structure of GroEL is required for biological activity because of the need for an intact cavity (16Wang J.D. Michelitsch M.D. Weissman J.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 12163-12168Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 17Weber F. Keppel F. Georgopoulos C. Hayer-Hartl M.K. Hartl F.-U. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 977-985Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Evidence for the importance of the oligomeric structure of GroEL for activity in vivo owing to the requirement for proper allosteric communication within and between rings has, however, not been reported. We decided to begin addressing this issue by generatingE. coli strains that express only plasmid-derived GroEL which is either wild type (as a control) or mutant with modified allosteric properties. The following GroEL mutants with different altered allosteric properties were chosen for analysis as follows: (i) GroEL(K4E) with disrupted inter-subunit contacts (18Horovitz A. Bochkareva E.S. Girshovich A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9957-9959Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19White Z.W. Fisher K.E. Eisenstein E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20404-20409Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar); (ii) GroEL(R13G, A126V) with intact positive cooperativity and disrupted negative cooperativity (20Aharoni A. Horovitz A. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 258: 732-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar); (iii) GroEL(R197A) with strongly diminished positive cooperativity and weakened negative cooperativity (12Yifrach O. Horovitz A. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 243: 397-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar); (iv) GroEL(E409A, R501A) with increased positive and slightly weakened negative cooperativity (21Aharoni A. Horovitz A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1698-1702Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), and (v) GroEL(R501A) with weakened positive cooperativity and disrupted negative cooperativity (21Aharoni A. Horovitz A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1698-1702Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). To date, there have been very few studies on the in vivo consequences of mutations in GroEL known to modify its properties in vitro (see, for example, Ref. 22Fenton W.A. Kashi Y. Furtak K. Horwich A.L. Nature. 1994; 371: 614-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar). Herein, we show that such mutations affect the function of GroEL in vivo (in cells that lack background chromosomal wild-type GroEL) and demonstrate that the effects depend on the physiological conditions and are protein substrate-specific.DISCUSSIONBacteriophage P1 transduction was used to generate E. coli TG1 strains that express only plasmid-derived wild-type GroEL or mutants with various modified and well characterized allosteric properties. The effects of these mutations on the function of GroELin vivo were studied using the following two assays: (i) propagation of phages λ, T4, and T5 and (ii) the bioluminescence of cells containing the full lux operon of V. fischeri. The GroE system was first identified by genetic studies of bacteriophage growth (30Georgopoulos C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1992; 17: 295-299Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Bacteriophages λ (31Sternberg N. J. Mol. Biol. 1973; 76: 25-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 32Georgopoulos C.P. Hendrix R.W. Casjens S.R. Kaiser A.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1973; 76: 45-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar) and T5 (33Zweig M. Cummings D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1973; 80: 505-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) employ the host GroE system for the folding of their own proteins. Bacteriophage T4 uses host GroEL but its own co-chaperonin, Gp31, for the folding of its major capsid protein, Gp23 (34Laemmli U.K. Beguin F. Gujer-Kellenberger G. J. Mol. Biol. 1970; 47: 69-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar, 35van der Vies S.M. Gatenby A.A. Georgopoulos C. Nature. 1994; 368: 654-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Luminescence inV. fischeri cells and in E. coli cells that contain the lux genes requires the product of theluxR gene which activates transcription of thelux operon upon binding to an autoinducer (27Ulitzur S. Dunlap P.V. Photochem. Photobiol. 1995; 62: 625-632Crossref Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The GroE system is believed to facilitate the folding in vivo of the LuxR protein (36Dolan K.M. Greenberg E.P. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 5132-5135Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 37Adar Y.Y. Ulitzur S. J. Biolumin. Chemilumin. 1993; 8: 261-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) and possibly also the luciferase α (LuxA) and β (LuxB) subunits (38Fedorov A.N. Baldwin T.O. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 268: 712-723Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The lux operon also containsluxC, luxD, and luxE which code for enzymes required for synthesis of the long chain aldehyde luciferase substrate, luxI which codes for an enzyme involved in autoinducer synthesis and luxG which codes for a protein with unknown function (27Ulitzur S. Dunlap P.V. Photochem. Photobiol. 1995; 62: 625-632Crossref Scopus (44) Google Scholar).The functional consequences in vivo of mutations that alter the allosteric properties of GroEL are found in this study to be protein substrate-specific. Cells containing GroEL(R197A), for example, grow poorly at 37 (not shown) and 42 °C (Fig. 1) and do not support growth of phage λ but do support growth of phages T4 and T5 (Fig. 2) and the folding of the lux operon gene products and other proteins that may be required for light production (Figs. 3 and 4). Cells containing GroEL(R501A) or GroEL(R13G, A126V), on the other hand, support the growth of phages λ, T4, and T5 (not shown) but not the folding at 28 °C of one or more of the proteins required for bioluminescence (Figs. 3 and 4). The need for specific allosteric properties in GroEL therefore depends on the nature of the protein substrates.The requirement for the GroE system for folding in vivo can be circumvented by changing conditions in a substrate-specific manner. All the TG1ΔEL/pBADEL strains examined in this study produce light at 20 °C (Fig. 4 B), thus suggesting that unassisted folding of the proteins required for bioluminescence is more efficient at this temperature as, for example, observed in the case of ribulose-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (7Viitanen P.V. Lubben T.H. Reed J. Goloubinoff P. O'Keefe D.P. Lorimer G.H. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 5665-5671Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). All the TG1ΔEL/pBADEL strains examined in this study also produce light at 28 °C when inducer is added (not shown), perhaps because the active conformation of LuxR is stabilized in its presence (27Ulitzur S. Dunlap P.V. Photochem. Photobiol. 1995; 62: 625-632Crossref Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Light production by cells containing GroEL(R501A) or GroEL(R13G, A126V) at 28 °C is, however, very low in the presence of inducer. Interestingly, the TG1ΔEL/pBADEL(R197A) strain which grows poorly at 37 and 42 °C is the only one that produces relatively more light at a low cell density, perhaps because folding of proteins which inhibit luminescence, such as LexA (27Ulitzur S. Dunlap P.V. Photochem. Photobiol. 1995; 62: 625-632Crossref Scopus (44) Google Scholar), is not facilitated by GroEL(R197A).The effects in vivo of mutations in GroEL are also found to depend on its level of expression. If the GroEL mutant has low affinity for unfolded protein substrates then increasing its concentration may reduce the effect of the mutation in vivo. This may explain why the TG1ΔEL/pBADEL(R197A) strain is not viable at 37 °C when the concentration of arabinose is less than 0.002% (Fig. 2). If, however, the GroEL mutant binds unfolded proteins but does not release them (i.e. it is a “trap” mutant), then lowering its concentration may diminish the effect of the mutation. For example, all the TG1ΔEL/pBADEL strains produce less light at 28 °C in the presence of 0.2% arabinose than in the presence of 0.02% arabinose (not shown). Changes in the expression level of GroEL also alter the GroEL/GroES ratio in the cell which, although physiologically important, does not affect the conclusions in this study since the amount of GroEL in the different strains was determined to be the same (not shown).An understanding of how the mutations in GroEL affect its functionin vivo requires identification of the relevant substrate protein(s) whose misfolding leads to the observed phenotype and establishing the mechanism by which the mutation causes the misfolding. Here, we concentrated on trying to understand the reasons for differences in bioluminescence of the different TG1ΔEL/pBADEL strains containing the lux operon. We initially focused on LuxR as the substrate of GroEL because of reports in the literature that GroE facilitates the folding in vivo of the LuxR protein (36Dolan K.M. Greenberg E.P. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 5132-5135Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,37Adar Y.Y. Ulitzur S. J. Biolumin. Chemilumin. 1993; 8: 261-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). GroEL was found to bind denatured LuxR and release it in an ATP- and GroES-dependent manner, but no differences in binding or release of LuxR by the different mutants were observed (not shown) in agreement with the small effect of the autoinducer on light production by the TG1ΔEL/pBADEL(R501A) and TG1ΔEL/pBADEL(R13G, A126V) strains. Next we analyzed GroE-assisted reactivation of denatured α and β luciferase subunits. The GroE system was previously shown to facilitate the in vitro folding of bacterial luciferase from Vibrio harveyi (38Fedorov A.N. Baldwin T.O. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 268: 712-723Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The extent of reactivation of α and β luciferase subunits by wild-type GroEL and the various mutants, in the presence of GroES and ATP, was found to be similar except in the case of GroEL(R13G, A126V) where the yield was about 50% that of the others (Fig. 5 C). GroEL(R13G, A126V) lacks negative cooperativity between rings but has intact intra-ring positive cooperativity and ak cat of ATP hydrolysis similar to that of wild-type GroEL (20Aharoni A. Horovitz A. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 258: 732-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). This mutant was also found to differ from wild-type GroEL and the other mutants in being able to release bound luciferase in the presence of ATP alone (Fig. 5 B). It was recently shown that the ATP-bound conformation of GroEL(A126V) is similar to the GroES-bound conformation of wild-type GroEL (39Llorca O. Perez-Perez J. Carrascosa J.L. Galan A. Muga A. Valpuesta J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32925-32932Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) thus explaining why ATP by itself can trigger release of substrates bound to GroEL(R13G, A126V). ATP-triggered release of luciferase subunits in a conformation not yet committed to fold may contribute to the lower yield of folding in the presence of GroEL(R13G, A126V) relative to wild-type GroEL. The GroEL(A126V) mutant was also found to form symmetric 2:1 GroES-GroEL complexes (39Llorca O. Perez-Perez J. Carrascosa J.L. Galan A. Muga A. Valpuesta J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32925-32932Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) in which substrate-binding sites are blocked. These properties of GroEL(A126V) may explain why cells containing GroEL(R13G, A126V) do not produce light at 28 °C. We do not yet know which proteins required for bioluminescence fail to fold in the presence of GroEL(R501A) and also which proteins involved in cell growth and λ phage propagation fail to fold in the presence of GroEL(R197A) at 25 and 37 °C.Our results suggest that mutations that perturb specific steps in the reaction cycle of GroEL are likely to be relatively more damaging. For example, cells containing only GroEL(D398A), which is defective in ATP hydrolysis, are not viable (not shown), whereas cells containing GroEL(K4E), which tends to dissociate into monomers (18Horovitz A. Bochkareva E.S. Girshovich A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9957-9959Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19White Z.W. Fisher K.E. Eisenstein E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20404-20409Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), exhibit a normal phenotype. This phenotype may be due, in part, to assembly into oligomeric structures in the presence of physiological concentrations of ATP (data not shown). GroEL(K4E) and also minichaperones (15Chatellier J. Hill F. Lund P.A. Fersht A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9861-9866Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) may retain some chaperoning function owing to mass action without trapping substrate proteins.In summary, our results indicate that allosteric communication in GroEL is important for the in vivo folding of a subset of substrates under certain physiological conditions. The poor growth of TG1ΔEL/pBADEL(R197A) at 42 °C and the formation of inclusion bodies in these cells (not shown) suggests that intact positive cooperativity may be of particular importance under stress conditions. Disrupted positive cooperativity reduces the shift in equilibrium under stress conditions toward the protein acceptor state of GroEL. Hartl and co-workers (40Houry W.A. Frishman D. Eckerskorn C. Lottspeich F. Hartl F.-U. Nature. 1999; 402: 147-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar) recently identified a set of in vivosubstrates of GroEL. Our results suggest that a “universal” set of protein substrates does not exist and that the set of substrates that interact with GroEL in vivo depends on the physiological conditions. The Escherichia coli GroE system facilitates protein folding in vivo and in vitro in an ATP-dependent manner (for recent reviews see, for example, Refs. 1Sigler P.B. Xu Z. Rye H.S. Burston S.G.

Coupling between protein folding and allostery in the GroE system has recently been demonstrated in vitro (14Yifrach O. Horovitz A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 1521-1524Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The importance of the allosteric properties of GroEL for its function in vivoremains, however, unclear. It has been questioned due to (i) the fact that the allosteric transitions of GroEL take place in vitroat subphysiological (micromolar) concentrations of ATP (13Yifrach O. Horovitz A. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 5303-5308Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar), and (ii) the finding that the apical domain of GroEL, which is devoid of ATPase activity, is active in vivo (15Chatellier J. Hill F. Lund P.A. Fersht A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9861-9866Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). More recently, it has been demonstrated that the oligomeric structure of GroEL is required for biological activity because of the need for an intact cavity (16Wang J.D. Michelitsch M.D. Weissman J.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 12163-12168Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 17Weber F. Keppel F. Georgopoulos C. Hayer-Hartl M.K. Hartl F.-U. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 977-985Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Evidence for the importance of the oligomeric structure of GroEL for activity in vivo owing to the requirement for proper allosteric communication within and between rings has, however, not been reported. We decided to begin addressing this issue by generatingE. coli strains that express only plasmid-derived GroEL which is either wild type (as a control) or mutant with modified allosteric properties. The following GroEL mutants with different altered allosteric properties were chosen for analysis as follows: (i) GroEL(K4E) with disrupted inter-subunit contacts (18Horovitz A. Bochkareva E.S. Girshovich A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9957-9959Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19White Z.W. Fisher K.E. Eisenstein E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20404-20409Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar); (ii) GroEL(R13G, A126V) with intact positive cooperativity and disrupted negative cooperativity (20Aharoni A. Horovitz A. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 258: 732-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar); (iii) GroEL(R197A) with strongly diminished positive cooperativity and weakened negative cooperativity (12Yifrach O. Horovitz A. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 243: 397-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar); (iv) GroEL(E409A, R501A) with increased positive and slightly weakened negative cooperativity (21Aharoni A. Horovitz A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1698-1702Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), and (v) GroEL(R501A) with weakened positive cooperativity and disrupted negative cooperativity (21Aharoni A. Horovitz A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1698-1702Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). To date, there have been very few studies on the in vivo consequences of mutations in GroEL known to modify its properties in vitro (see, for example, Ref. 22Fenton W.A. Kashi Y. Furtak K. Horwich A.L. Nature. 1994; 371: 614-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar). Herein, we show that such mutations affect the function of GroEL in vivo (in cells that lack background chromosomal wild-type GroEL) and demonstrate that the effects depend on the physiological conditions and are protein substrate-specific. DISCUSSIONBacteriophage P1 transduction was used to generate E. coli TG1 strains that express only plasmid-derived wild-type GroEL or mutants with various modified and well characterized allosteric properties. The effects of these mutations on the function of GroELin vivo were studied using the following two assays: (i) propagation of phages λ, T4, and T5 and (ii) the bioluminescence of cells containing the full lux operon of V. fischeri. The GroE system was first identified by genetic studies of bacteriophage growth (30Georgopoulos C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1992; 17: 295-299Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Bacteriophages λ (31Sternberg N. J. Mol. Biol. 1973; 76: 25-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 32Georgopoulos C.P. Hendrix R.W. Casjens S.R. Kaiser A.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1973; 76: 45-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar) and T5 (33Zweig M. Cummings D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1973; 80: 505-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) employ the host GroE system for the folding of their own proteins. Bacteriophage T4 uses host GroEL but its own co-chaperonin, Gp31, for the folding of its major capsid protein, Gp23 (34Laemmli U.K. Beguin F. Gujer-Kellenberger G. J. Mol. Biol. 1970; 47: 69-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar, 35van der Vies S.M. Gatenby A.A. Georgopoulos C. Nature. 1994; 368: 654-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Luminescence inV. fischeri cells and in E. coli cells that contain the lux genes requires the product of theluxR gene which activates transcription of thelux operon upon binding to an autoinducer (27Ulitzur S. Dunlap P.V. Photochem. Photobiol. 1995; 62: 625-632Crossref Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The GroE system is believed to facilitate the folding in vivo of the LuxR protein (36Dolan K.M. Greenberg E.P. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 5132-5135Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 37Adar Y.Y. Ulitzur S. J. Biolumin. Chemilumin. 1993; 8: 261-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) and possibly also the luciferase α (LuxA) and β (LuxB) subunits (38Fedorov A.N. Baldwin T.O. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 268: 712-723Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The lux operon also containsluxC, luxD, and luxE which code for enzymes required for synthesis of the long chain aldehyde luciferase substrate, luxI which codes for an enzyme involved in autoinducer synthesis and luxG which codes for a protein with unknown function (27Ulitzur S. Dunlap P.V. Photochem. Photobiol. 1995; 62: 625-632Crossref Scopus (44) Google Scholar).The functional consequences in vivo of mutations that alter the allosteric properties of GroEL are found in this study to be protein substrate-specific. Cells containing GroEL(R197A), for example, grow poorly at 37 (not shown) and 42 °C (Fig. 1) and do not support growth of phage λ but do support growth of phages T4 and T5 (Fig. 2) and the folding of the lux operon gene products and other proteins that may be required for light production (Figs. 3 and 4). Cells containing GroEL(R501A) or GroEL(R13G, A126V), on the other hand, support the growth of phages λ, T4, and T5 (not shown) but not the folding at 28 °C of one or more of the proteins required for bioluminescence (Figs. 3 and 4). The need for specific allosteric properties in GroEL therefore depends on the nature of the protein substrates.The requirement for the GroE system for folding in vivo can be circumvented by changing conditions in a substrate-specific manner. All the TG1ΔEL/pBADEL strains examined in this study produce light at 20 °C (Fig. 4 B), thus suggesting that unassisted folding of the proteins required for bioluminescence is more efficient at this temperature as, for example, observed in the case of ribulose-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (7Viitanen P.V. Lubben T.H. Reed J. Goloubinoff P. O'Keefe D.P. Lorimer G.H. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 5665-5671Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). All the TG1ΔEL/pBADEL strains examined in this study also produce light at 28 °C when inducer is added (not shown), perhaps because the active conformation of LuxR is stabilized in its presence (27Ulitzur S. Dunlap P.V. Photochem. Photobiol. 1995; 62: 625-632Crossref Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Light production by cells containing GroEL(R501A) or GroEL(R13G, A126V) at 28 °C is, however, very low in the presence of inducer. Interestingly, the TG1ΔEL/pBADEL(R197A) strain which grows poorly at 37 and 42 °C is the only one that produces relatively more light at a low cell density, perhaps because folding of proteins which inhibit luminescence, such as LexA (27Ulitzur S. Dunlap P.V. Photochem. Photobiol. 1995; 62: 625-632Crossref Scopus (44) Google Scholar), is not facilitated by GroEL(R197A).The effects in vivo of mutations in GroEL are also found to depend on its level of expression. If the GroEL mutant has low affinity for unfolded protein substrates then increasing its concentration may reduce the effect of the mutation in vivo. This may explain why the TG1ΔEL/pBADEL(R197A) strain is not viable at 37 °C when the concentration of arabinose is less than 0.002% (Fig. 2). If, however, the GroEL mutant binds unfolded proteins but does not release them (i.e. it is a “trap” mutant), then lowering its concentration may diminish the effect of the mutation. For example, all the TG1ΔEL/pBADEL strains produce less light at 28 °C in the presence of 0.2% arabinose than in the presence of 0.02% arabinose (not shown). Changes in the expression level of GroEL also alter the GroEL/GroES ratio in the cell which, although physiologically important, does not affect the conclusions in this study since the amount of GroEL in the different strains was determined to be the same (not shown).An understanding of how the mutations in GroEL affect its functionin vivo requires identification of the relevant substrate protein(s) whose misfolding leads to the observed phenotype and establishing the mechanism by which the mutation causes the misfolding. Here, we concentrated on trying to understand the reasons for differences in bioluminescence of the different TG1ΔEL/pBADEL strains containing the lux operon. We initially focused on LuxR as the substrate of GroEL because of reports in the literature that GroE facilitates the folding in vivo of the LuxR protein (36Dolan K.M. Greenberg E.P. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 5132-5135Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,37Adar Y.Y. Ulitzur S. J. Biolumin. Chemilumin. 1993; 8: 261-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). GroEL was found to bind denatured LuxR and release it in an ATP- and GroES-dependent manner, but no differences in binding or release of LuxR by the different mutants were observed (not shown) in agreement with the small effect of the autoinducer on light production by the TG1ΔEL/pBADEL(R501A) and TG1ΔEL/pBADEL(R13G, A126V) strains. Next we analyzed GroE-assisted reactivation of denatured α and β luciferase subunits. The GroE system was previously shown to facilitate the in vitro folding of bacterial luciferase from Vibrio harveyi (38Fedorov A.N. Baldwin T.O. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 268: 712-723Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The extent of reactivation of α and β luciferase subunits by wild-type GroEL and the various mutants, in the presence of GroES and ATP, was found to be similar except in the case of GroEL(R13G, A126V) where the yield was about 50% that of the others (Fig. 5 C). GroEL(R13G, A126V) lacks negative cooperativity between rings but has intact intra-ring positive cooperativity and ak cat of ATP hydrolysis similar to that of wild-type GroEL (20Aharoni A. Horovitz A. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 258: 732-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). This mutant was also found to differ from wild-type GroEL and the other mutants in being able to release bound luciferase in the presence of ATP alone (Fig. 5 B). It was recently shown that the ATP-bound conformation of GroEL(A126V) is similar to the GroES-bound conformation of wild-type GroEL (39Llorca O. Perez-Perez J. Carrascosa J.L. Galan A. Muga A. Valpuesta J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32925-32932Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) thus explaining why ATP by itself can trigger release of substrates bound to GroEL(R13G, A126V). ATP-triggered release of luciferase subunits in a conformation not yet committed to fold may contribute to the lower yield of folding in the presence of GroEL(R13G, A126V) relative to wild-type GroEL. The GroEL(A126V) mutant was also found to form symmetric 2:1 GroES-GroEL complexes (39Llorca O. Perez-Perez J. Carrascosa J.L. Galan A. Muga A. Valpuesta J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32925-32932Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) in which substrate-binding sites are blocked. These properties of GroEL(A126V) may explain why cells containing GroEL(R13G, A126V) do not produce light at 28 °C. We do not yet know which proteins required for bioluminescence fail to fold in the presence of GroEL(R501A) and also which proteins involved in cell growth and λ phage propagation fail to fold in the presence of GroEL(R197A) at 25 and 37 °C.Our results suggest that mutations that perturb specific steps in the reaction cycle of GroEL are likely to be relatively more damaging. For example, cells containing only GroEL(D398A), which is defective in ATP hydrolysis, are not viable (not shown), whereas cells containing GroEL(K4E), which tends to dissociate into monomers (18Horovitz A. Bochkareva E.S. Girshovich A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9957-9959Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19White Z.W. Fisher K.E. Eisenstein E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20404-20409Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), exhibit a normal phenotype. This phenotype may be due, in part, to assembly into oligomeric structures in the presence of physiological concentrations of ATP (data not shown). GroEL(K4E) and also minichaperones (15Chatellier J. Hill F. Lund P.A. Fersht A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9861-9866Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) may retain some chaperoning function owing to mass action without trapping substrate proteins.In summary, our results indicate that allosteric communication in GroEL is important for the in vivo folding of a subset of substrates under certain physiological conditions. The poor growth of TG1ΔEL/pBADEL(R197A) at 42 °C and the formation of inclusion bodies in these cells (not shown) suggests that intact positive cooperativity may be of particular importance under stress conditions. Disrupted positive cooperativity reduces the shift in equilibrium under stress conditions toward the protein acceptor state of GroEL. Hartl and co-workers (40Houry W.A. Frishman D. Eckerskorn C. Lottspeich F. Hartl F.-U. Nature. 1999; 402: 147-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar) recently identified a set of in vivosubstrates of GroEL. Our results suggest that a “universal” set of protein substrates does not exist and that the set of substrates that interact with GroEL in vivo depends on the physiological conditions. Bacteriophage P1 transduction was used to generate E. coli TG1 strains that express only plasmid-derived wild-type GroEL or mutants with various modified and well characterized allosteric properties.

Luminescence inV. fischeri cells and in E. coli cells that contain the lux genes requires the product of theluxR gene which activates transcription of thelux operon upon binding to an autoinducer (27Ulitzur S. Dunlap P.V. Photochem. Photobiol. 1995; 62: 625-632Crossref Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The GroE system is believed to facilitate the folding in vivo of the LuxR protein (36Dolan K.M. Greenberg E.P.

Chemilumin. 1993; 8: 261-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) and possibly also the luciferase α (LuxA) and β (LuxB) subunits (38Fedorov A.N. Baldwin T.O. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 268: 712-723Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The lux operon also containsluxC, luxD, and luxE which code for enzymes required for synthesis of the long chain aldehyde luciferase substrate, luxI which codes for an enzyme involved in autoinducer synthesis and luxG which codes for a protein with unknown function (27Ulitzur S.

The functional consequences in vivo of mutations that alter the allosteric properties of GroEL are found in this study to be protein substrate-specific. Cells containing GroEL(R197A), for example, grow poorly at 37 (not shown) and 42 °C (Fig. 1) and do not support growth of phage λ but do support growth of phages T4 and T5 (Fig. 2) and the folding of the lux operon gene products and other proteins that may be required for light production (Figs. 3 and 4). Cells containing GroEL(R501A) or GroEL(R13G, A126V), on the other hand, support the growth of phages λ, T4, and T5 (not shown) but not the folding at 28 °C of one or more of the proteins required for bioluminescence (Figs. 3 and 4). The need for specific allosteric properties in GroEL therefore depends on the nature of the protein substrates. The requirement for the GroE system for folding in vivo can be circumvented by changing conditions in a substrate-specific manner. All the TG1ΔEL/pBADEL strains examined in this study produce light at 20 °C (Fig. 4 B), thus suggesting that unassisted folding of the proteins required for bioluminescence is more efficient at this temperature as, for example, observed in the case of ribulose-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (7Viitanen P.V.

All the TG1ΔEL/pBADEL strains examined in this study also produce light at 28 °C when inducer is added (not shown), perhaps because the active conformation of LuxR is stabilized in its presence (27Ulitzur S. Dunlap P.V. Photochem. Photobiol. 1995; 62: 625-632Crossref Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Light production by cells containing GroEL(R501A) or GroEL(R13G, A126V) at 28 °C is, however, very low in the presence of inducer. Interestingly, the TG1ΔEL/pBADEL(R197A) strain which grows poorly at 37 and 42 °C is the only one that produces relatively more light at a low cell density, perhaps because folding of proteins which inhibit luminescence, such as LexA (27Ulitzur S.

The effects in vivo of mutations in GroEL are also found to depend on its level of expression. If the GroEL mutant has low affinity for unfolded protein substrates then increasing its concentration may reduce the effect of the mutation in vivo. This may explain why the TG1ΔEL/pBADEL(R197A) strain is not viable at 37 °C when the concentration of arabinose is less than 0.002% (Fig. 2). If, however, the GroEL mutant binds unfolded proteins but does not release them (i.e. it is a “trap” mutant), then lowering its concentration may diminish the effect of the mutation. For example, all the TG1ΔEL/pBADEL strains produce less light at 28 °C in the presence of 0.2% arabinose than in the presence of 0.02% arabinose (not shown). Changes in the expression level of GroEL also alter the GroEL/GroES ratio in the cell which, although physiologically important, does not affect the conclusions in this study since the amount of GroEL in the different strains was determined to be the same (not shown). An understanding of how the mutations in GroEL affect its functionin vivo requires identification of the relevant substrate protein(s) whose misfolding leads to the observed phenotype and establishing the mechanism by which the mutation causes the misfolding. Here, we concentrated on trying to understand the reasons for differences in bioluminescence of the different TG1ΔEL/pBADEL strains containing the lux operon.

GroEL was found to bind denatured LuxR and release it in an ATP- and GroES-dependent manner, but no differences in binding or release of LuxR by the different mutants were observed (not shown) in agreement with the small effect of the autoinducer on light production by the TG1ΔEL/pBADEL(R501A) and TG1ΔEL/pBADEL(R13G, A126V) strains. Next we analyzed GroE-assisted reactivation of denatured α and β luciferase subunits. The GroE system was previously shown to facilitate the in vitro folding of bacterial luciferase from Vibrio harveyi (38Fedorov A.N. Baldwin T.O. J. Mol.

This mutant was also found to differ from wild-type GroEL and the other mutants in being able to release bound luciferase in the presence of ATP alone (Fig. 5 B). It was recently shown that the ATP-bound conformation of GroEL(A126V) is similar to the GroES-bound conformation of wild-type GroEL (39Llorca O. Perez-Perez J. Carrascosa J.L. Galan A. Muga A.

These properties of GroEL(A126V) may explain why cells containing GroEL(R13G, A126V) do not produce light at 28 °C. We do not yet know which proteins required for bioluminescence fail to fold in the presence of GroEL(R501A) and also which proteins involved in cell growth and λ phage propagation fail to fold in the presence of GroEL(R197A) at 25 and 37 °C.
