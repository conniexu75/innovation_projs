https://openalex.org/W1595443666,"Enterokinase (enteropeptidase, EC 3.4.4.8) has been purified from porcine duodenal extracts by chromatography on DEAE-cellulose, carboxymethyl cellulose, Sephadex G-100, and Sephadex G-200. The final product was found to be homogeneous by a number of tests. Its specific activity against trypsinogen (nanomoles of trypsinogen activated per 30 min per mg) was 6550, which represented a 650-fold purification over the first clear extract. The preparation was still contaminated, however, by traces of aminopeptidase activity. Porcine enterokinase activates bovine trypsinogen much better than does bovine trypsin (Km 6 times lower and kcat 2000 times higher). This property arises from the fact that the specificity site of enterokinase recognizes in trypsinogen not merely the basic residue of the -Lys-Ile-bond (residues 6 and 7) which is split during activation of the zymogen but also recognizes the sequence -Asp4-Lys (residues 2 to 6) which is present in all of the trypsinogens so far studied. By contrast, aspartyl residues are known to slow down the action of trypsin on the zymogen (autoactivation). The sequence -Asp4-Lys appears to be essential for the interaction of enterokinase with peptide or protein substrates and inhibitors. For example, the enzyme does not cleave the peptide Val-Ala2-Lys-Ile-Val-Gly and it does not activate chymotrypsinogen A. It does not hydrolyze the fully denatured S-carboxymethyl derivative of chymotrypsinogen and it cleaves exclusively the -Lys-Ile-bond (residues 6 and 7) in S-carboxymethylated bovine trypsinogen. Moreover, enterokinase is not inhibited by relatively high concentrations of soybean trypsin inhibitor or the two pancreatic inhibitors described by Kunitz and Kazal. On the other hand, enterokinase is similar to trypsin in several respects. For example, it is inhibited by α-tosylly-sine chloromethyl ketone and by diisopropylphosphorofluoridate, which suggests that an active serine and a histidine residue participate in the catalytic action of enterokinase. Moreover, enterokinase cleaves the synthetic trypsin substrates benzoylarginine ethyl ester and tosylarginine methyl ester. This probably means that the specificity site of enterokinase is composed of several subsites. One, possibly similar to that of trypsin, is responsible for the binding of low molecular weight basic substrates and inhibitors. The others, responsible for the interactions with aspartyl side chains, participate in the selective union of the enzyme with peptides or protein substrates and inhibitors. The properties of enterokinase suggest that it initiates the activation of trypsinogen which occurs in the duodenum. Therefore, it appears to be a key enzyme of digestion since trypsin is responsible for the activation of all of the other pancreatic zymogens."

Treatment of rats with 6-hydroxydopamine, a drug which destroys sympathetic nerve terminals, leads to a decrease in serum dopamine-β-hydroxylase activity. The decrease is not due to an effect on the adrenal medulla or to an increase in circulating inhibitor or inhibitors of enzyme. These data represent evidence that at least a portion of the circulating dopamine-β-hydroxylase activity arises from sympathetic nerve terminals."
https://openalex.org/W1573144364,"The regulation of albumin synthesis and serum protein secretion was studied in regenerating rat liver by measuring incorporation of 14C-leucine. Albumin was isolated to radiochemical purity, utilizing a method which eliminates the influence of precursor pool changes on protein labeling. Changes in the size of the product pool were measured. The following results were obtained. 1. The time period between intracaval injection of 14Cleucine and the appearance of radioactive protein in the blood (secretion time) decreased from 15 min for normal animals to a minimum of 10 min at 48 hours after removal of 70% of the liver. 2. At 10 min after intracaval injection of 14C-leucine, 3.5% of total protein radioactivity was found in albumin in normal liver, whereas in regenerating liver only 1.4% of the total protein radioactivity was incorporated into albumin. 3. Albumin concentration in the serum decreased from 29.2 mg of albumin per ml of serum for normal rats to a minimum of 17.3 mg of albumin per ml of serum at 4 days after partial hepatectomy. 4. The half-life of albumin was 2.66 days for normal rats and 2.13 days for animals, 48 hours after partial hepatectomy. 5. The intravascular pool of albumin decreased from 100 mg of albumin per 100 g, body wt, in normal rats to 57.8 mg of albumin per 100 g, body wt, in partially hepatectomized animals, 48 hours after operation. The extravascular and the total body pool of albumin also decreased after partial hepatectomy to a minimum at 24 hours after the operation. In contrast to the intravascular pool, the extravascular and the total body pool increased again, reaching a plateau between 2 and 4 days after the operation. 6. During regeneration, the proportion of leucine to other amino acids in total liver protein did not change. Also, this proportion did not differ significantly from that found in serum albumin. 7. The net rate of albumin synthesis changed only slightly from 20.1 mg of albumin per day per g of liver for normal to 23.9 mg albumin per day per g of liver for regenerating liver 48 hours after partial hepatectomy. In contrast, the net rate of synthesis of total liver protein increased from 576 mg protein per day per g of liver in normal rats to 1710 mg of protein per day per g of liver in rats 48 hours after partial hepatectomy."

https://openalex.org/W1583217938,"Abstract A glucosyltransferase has been prepared from rat kidney cortex which is involved in the assembly of the hydroxylysine-linked glucosylgalactose disaccharide units of basement membranes and collagens. This enzyme has been purified from the high speed supernatant of the kidney cortex of 10-day-old rats by ammonium sulfate fractionation and Bio-Gel filtration. It has also been obtained by ultrasonic treatment of a particulate fraction from the kidney cortex. The enzyme was found to transfer glucose from UDP-glucose to hydroxylysine-linked galactose, either in high or low molecular weight compounds. These acceptors include native collagen from varied sources, glomerular basement membrane from which the glucose had been selectively removed, peptides containing galactosylhydroxylysine or galactosylhydroxylysine itself. The Km values for native calf skin collagen and glucose-free basement membrane were found to be 1.3 and 1.6 x 10-4 m, respectively, while that for galactosylhydroxylysine-containing peptides was determined to be 1.2 x 10-3 m, indicating that the enzyme has a greater affinity for the high molecular weight acceptors. Characterization of the product indicated that the enzyme formed the naturally occurring hydroxylysine-linked disaccharide (2 - O - α - d - glucopyranosyl - d - galactose). This enzyme may be designated as a UDP-glucose:galactosylhydroxylysine-collagen (basement membrane) glucosyltransferase, its primary role in kidney cortex being to participate in basement membrane synthesis. It was found that the e-amino group of the hydroxylysine, which is vicinal to the hydroxyl group to which galactose is attached, has to be unsubstituted in order for a compound to serve as an acceptor. The enzyme was inactive toward substrates containing terminal galactose residues linked to other amino acids or sugars, including sialic acid-free thyroglobulin glycopeptides, earthworm cuticle collagen glycopeptides, or lactose. Galactosylsphingosine (psychosine), however, was found to be an acceptor for this enzyme. Glucosylgalactosylsphingosine was formed and this transfer activity was shown by competitive inhibition studies to be a function of the same enzymatic site as is involved in the formation of glucosylgalactosylhydroxylysine. This lack of specificity is believed to be caused by the similarity which exists between the glycosidic linkage region of galactosylhydroxylysine and galactosylsphingosine. Although UDP-glucose was the preferred glycosyl donor for the glucosyltransferase with a Km value of 3.1 x 10-5 m, TDP- and CDP-glucose could serve in this capacity to a limited extent. The enzyme was found to have an absolute requirement for a divalent cation, manganese being the most effective. The pH optimum was 7.4. It was shown that the glucosyltransferase, working in concert with a kidney galactosyltransferase, could effect the synthesis of the hydroxylysine-linked disaccharide unit."
https://openalex.org/W1486356174,Rat brain enzyme preparations catalyze the transfer of N-acetylgalactosamine from UDP-N-acetylgalactosamine to monosialyl- and disialyl-lactosylceramide. The respective in vitro synthetized reaction products are acceptors of galactose when UDP-galactose is present in the system. The similarities of kinetic parameters for the corresponding steps suggest that an analogous sequence of reactions is involved in the synthesis of the gangliosides galactosyl-N-acetylgalactosaminyl-[N-acetylneuraminyl]-galactosylglucosylceramide and galactosyl-N-acetylgalactosaminyl-[N-acetylneuraminyl-N-acetylneuraminyl]-galactosylglucosylceramide.
https://openalex.org/W1602103868,"Abstract The tissue distribution in the rat of the glucosyl- and galactosyltransferases involved in the biosynthesis of the hydroxylysine-linked disaccharide (2-O-α-d-glucopyranosyl-d-galactose) and monosaccharide (galactose) units has been investigated. High levels of these enzymes have been found in tissues rich in collagen and basement membranes, including cartilage, uterus, skin, spleen, lung, kidney cortex, and thyroid. Low levels were present in liver, while brain and heart were almost devoid of these enzymes. The relative amounts of these two glycosyltransferases varied, with cartilage, skin, spleen, and lung having similar levels of the two enzymes, while in kidney, thyroid, and uterus there was more of the glucosyl-than the galactosyltransferase. The two enzymes could be purified from cartilage by Bio-Gel A-1.5m filtration in a manner similar to that previously used for the kidney cortex. The activity of the two glycosyltransferases varied with age in a parallel manner, reaching a maximum at about 9 days after birth, and falling off thereafter to reach levels of about 10% of the maximum in the mature animals. A marked increase in the level of the glucosyltransferase of the uterus was observed in pregnancy, with a doubling of the specific activity and a 16-fold increase in the total activity. The enzyme decreased toward normal in the postpartum state. Measurement of the glucosyltransferase in the renal cortex of alloxan diabetic rats indicated a highly significant increase in activity over age-matched normals, and was believed to reflect an increased synthesis of basement membrane in the diabetic kidney. Differential centrifugation of kidney cortex homogenates in buffered sucrose indicated that both the glucosyl- and galactosyltransferase were present primarily in a rapidly sedimenting particle fraction (650 and 2000 x g), as well as in the high speed supernatant (100,000 x g). The amount of enzyme in the supernatant varied with the medium used for homogenization."

Incubation of whole cells with tritiated formate, tritiated succinate, and glucose labeled with tritium in various positions failed to result in the labeling of the monoenoic acid product. In contrast, experiments performed in D2O indicated that deuterium was incorporated at the cis double bond(s) reduced by the microorganism. This reduction, which takes place stereospecifically, was found to occur by cis addition to the d side of cis-9, trans-11-octadecadienoic acid, an intermediate in the biohydrogenation of linoleic acid. The distribution of deuterium at the reduced carbon atoms shows an isotope effect and leads to the speculation that reduction occurs by addition of a proton and hydride ion mediated by an unknown carrier."

https://openalex.org/W3208643662,"The foregoing studies are intended to define a differentiation process and to permit genetic access to the mechanisms that control this process. In order to elucidate the basic mechanisms whereby a cell dictates its own defined morphogenic changes, we have found it helpful to study an organism that can be manipulated both biochemically and genetically. We have attempted to develop the studies initiated by Poindexter,Stove and Stanier, and Schmidt and Stanier (16, 17, 20) with the Caulobacter genus so that these bacteria can serve as a model system for prokaryotic differentiation. The Caulobacter life cycle, defined in synchronously growing cultures, includes a sequential series of morphological changes that occur at specific times in the cycle and at specific locations in the cell. Six distinct cellular characteristics, which are peculiar to these bacteria, have been defined and include (i) the synthesis of a polar organelle which may be membranous (21-23), (ii) a satellite DNA in the stalked cell (26), (iii) pili to which RNA bacteriophage specifically adsorb (16, 33), (iv) a single polar flagellum(17), (v) a lipopolysaccharide phage receptor site (27), and (vi) new cell wall material at the flagellated pole of the cell giving rise to a stalk (19, 20). Cell division, essential for the viability of the organism, is dependent on the irreversible differentiation of a flagellated swarmer cell to a mature stalked cell. The specific features of the Caulobacter system which make it a system of choice for studies of the control of sequential events resulting in cellular differentiation can be summarized as follows. 1) Cell populations can be synchronized, and homogeneous populations at each stage in the differentiation cycle can thus be obtained. 2) A specific technique has been developed whereby the progress of the differentiation cycle can be accurately measured by adsorption of labeled RNA phage or penetration of labeled phage DNA into specific cell forms. This technique can be used to select for mutants blocked in the various stages of morphogenesis. 3) Temperature-sensitive mutants of Caulobacter that are restricted in macromolecular synthesis and development at elevated temperatures have been isolated. 4) Genetic exchange in the Calflobacter genus has been demonstrated and is now being defined. Two questions related to control processes can now readily be approached experimentally. (i) Is the temporal progression of events occurring during bacterial differentiation controlled by regulator gene products? (ii) Is the differentiation cycle like a biosynthetic pathway where one event must follow another? The availability of temperature-sensitive mutants blocked at various stages of development permits access to both questions. An interesting feature of the differentiation cycle is that the polar organelle may represent a special segregated unit which is operative in the control of the differentiation process. Perhaps the sequential morphogenic changes exhibited by Caulobacter are dependent on the initial synthesis of this organelle. Because the ultimate expression of cell changes are dependent on selective protein synthesis, specific messenger RNA production-either from DNA present in an organelle or from the chromosome-may prove to be a controlling factor in cell differentiation. We have begun studies with RNA polymerase purified from Caulobacter crescentus to determine whether cell factors or alterations in the enzyme structure serve to change the specificity of transcription during the cell cycle. Control of sequential cell changes at the level of transcription has long been postulated and has recently been substantiated in the case of Bacillus sporulation (6). The Caulobacter bacteria now present another system in which direct analysis of these control mechanisms is feasible."

The time course of the reaction is independent of the wave length of the observing light. In phosphate buffers at pH 7, or on the addition of 2,3-diphosphoglycerate or of inositol hexaphosphate to bis-tris buffers, isosbestic points are no longer found and the time course of the reaction varies with the wave length of the observing light.

https://openalex.org/W1543615719,"Abstract Arginine racemase has been purified approximately 5400-fold and crystallized from an extract of Pseudomonas graveolens. The purification procedure consists of sonic disruption, ammonium sulfate fractionation, treatment with 1-butanol, DEAE-cellulose and DEAE-Sephadex column chromatography, and Sephadex G-150 gel filtration, followed by crystallization. The purified enzyme is homogeneous by the criteria of ultracentrifugation (s020,w = 5.2 S) and disc gel electrophoresis. The molecular weight is 167,000, assuming a partial specific volume of 0.74. The enzyme is yellow in solution and exhibits an absorption maximum at 420 mµ. The absorption spectrum is shifted neither by varying pH of the enzyme nor by addition of arginine. One mole of pyridoxal 5'-phosphate is tightly bound per 42,000 g of enzyme. The apoenzyme was obtained by dialysis against phenylhydrazine solution. Addition of pyridoxal 5'-phosphate caused return of the 420 mµ absorption peak and reconstitution of activity. Reduction of arginine racemase with sodium borohydride shifted the 420 mµ peak to about 315 mµ, and destroyed the racemase activity. The enzyme catalyzes racemization of lysine, arginine, e-N-acetyllysine, ornithine, 2,3-diaminopropionate, homoarginine, 2,4-diaminobutyrate, ethionine, citrulline, homocitrulline, δ-N-acetylornithine, theanine, glutamine, and methionine in this order, when examined at pH 10.0. Maximum activities for arginine, lysine, theanine, and ornithine are found in the pH regions of 9.0 to 10.6, 7.5 to 10.6, 7.0 to 10.0, and 6.5 to 9.0, respectively. The following Michaelis constants were determined: d-arginine, 1.0 x 10-3 m, and pyridoxal 5'-phosphate, 4.0 x 10-7 m. The enzyme activity was inhibited by hydroxylamine and d- and l-penicillamine."
https://openalex.org/W1495406918,"Abstract The amino acid compositions of the isolated α and β chains from purified adult cat hemoglobins A and B have been determined. The data indicate that the α chains are similar but the β chains differ by about four substitutions. Amino-terminal analysis has shown the presence of the typical Val-Leu sequence in the cat α chains. However, the two β chains differ at their amino terminals. NH2-terminal glycine is found in the A-β and a serine with a blocked α-NH2 group occurs in this position in the B-β chain. The amino-terminal tryptic peptides of both β chains have been isolated and their sequences partially characterized. The effects of 2,3-diphosphoglycerate and ATP on the oxygen saturation curves of isolated cat hemoglobins A and B (HbA and HbB) have been investigated. Cat HbA, with free β chain NH2 termini, is sensitive to 2,3-diphosphoglycerate and ATP, whereas cat HbB, with blocked β chain NH2 termini, is insensitive to these effector molecules. The oxygen affinities of the hemolysates containing mixtures of HbA and HbB are changed by 2,3-diphosphoglycerate or ATP in proportion to the ratio of HbA to HbB in the hemolysate. The work provides support for a role of the NH2 terminus of the β chain in the control of oxygen binding in hemoglobin."
https://openalex.org/W1546342862,"Abstract A mutant of Saccharomyces cerevisiae which issues cytoplasmic petite (ρ-) progeny at 18° or during growth at 28° on medium containing 3 mg per ml of chloramphenicol was examined to determine the fate of mitochondrial membrane proteins and mitochondrial DNA during the petite induction process. Labeling of mitochondria in vivo with radioactive leucine in the presence of 200 µg per ml of cycloheximide and subsequent separation of the labeled proteins on sodium dodecyl sulfate acrylamide gels yields a gel pattern consisting of seven or eight protein species ranging in molecular weight from 13,000 to 45,000. This pattern is much simpler than that obtained from mitochondria isolated from cells labeled in vivo without drugs and presumably represents products of mitochondrial protein synthesis. The mitochondrial gel profile of the mutant strain 1121, when compared with that of parent strain 55-R5-3C, undergoes striking alterations during petite induction at 18° which include (a) a loss of a molecular weight 41,000 component, (b) a decrease in the synthesis of a 24,000 component, and (c) an apparent increase in low molecular weight (13,000) material. Changes in the mitochondrial gel profile of strain 1121 during petite induction by growth at 28° in the presence of chloramphenicol are restricted to a decrease in the appearance of a molecular weight 41,000 component. Growth of strain 1121 at 18° results in an apparent decrease of mitochondrial DNA from the bulk population. The subcloning of randomly selected cytoplasmic petites issued at 18° by strain 1121 gives two types of cells, those with detectable mitochondrial DNA and those apparently lacking mitochondrial DNA, illustrating a genetic heterogeneity in the 18° petite population. We suggest that the alterations in the 1121 gel profiles of mitochondria obtained from cells during 18° growth or growth at 28° with chloramphenicol reflect the improper formation of a membrane component related to the maintenance of the ρ+ genotype."

Adjacent regions antagonized the central region, for stimulation of either inhibited the discharge resulting from stimulation of the central region."
https://openalex.org/W1949974879,"Abstract Two forms of acetoacetyl-coenzyme A thiolase, both clearly separated from β-hydroxy-β-methylglutaryl-CoA synthase, have been partially purified from yeast. The isoelectric points of the two enzymes are 5.3 (thiolase 5.3) and 7.8 (thiolase 7.8). Thiolase 5.3 has a molecular weight of about 1.4 x 105 daltons. It shows a ping pong pattern of kinetics and has a Km for acetoacetyl-CoA of 3.5 x 10-4 m and for CoA of 1.6 x 10-4 m. Thiolase 7.8 has a molecular weight of about 0.65 x 105 daltons. The Km for acetoaceyl-CoA is 2 x 10-5 m, while the Km for CoA is less than 10-6 m. Both enzymes are completely inhibited by iodoacetamide and both are protected from inhibition if previously incubated with substrate. However, thiolase 5.3 requires higher concentrations of substrate for protection. Both enzymes use only acetoacetyl-CoA as β-ketothioester. CoA is the best thiol substrate, but other thiol donors are active. Thiolase 5.3 has a sharp pH optimum at pH 8.8, whereas thiolase 7.8 has a broad optimum from pH 7.6 to 9. Thiolase 5.3 is not effected by treatment with sodium borohydride. When thiolase 7.8 is treated with borohydride, the enzyme is inhibited when substrate is present and is activated when substrate is absent. On the basis of kinetic properties and the effects of sodium borohydride and iodoacetamide, an enzymatic mechanism is proposed for the reaction which involves the formation of a thiolimidate intermediate."

https://openalex.org/W1509805334,"Abstract Arginine racemase from Pseudomonas graveolens is inactivated by preliminary incubation with l- or d-ornithine, δ-N-acetyl-l-ornithine, and l-2,4-diaminobutyrate at pH 10.0. Loss of the enzyme activity is associated with formation of a new spectrum with an absorption maximum in the region of 320 mµ and disappearance of a peak at 420 mµ. The inactivation is prevented, and the inactivated enzyme is reactivated by addition of pyruvate or oxaloacetate. Addition of pyridoxal 5'-phosphate has substantially no effect. Exhaustive dialysis of the enzyme treated with ornithine leads to loss of the absorption at about 320 mµ to yield apoenzyme. The apoenzyme is reactivated by adding either pyridoxal 5'-phosphate alone or pyridoxamine 5'-phosphate plus pyruvate. Inactivation appears to be due to formation of bound pyridoxamine 5'-phosphate from bound pyridoxal 5'-phosphate by transamination with ornithine, which is converted into Δ1-pyrroline-2-carboxylic acid, the intramolecularly dehydrated form of α-keto-δ-aminovaleric acid. Pyridoxamine 5'-phosphate formed is tightly bound to the protein moiety and dissociates from the enzyme only after long dialysis. The enzyme catalyzes transamination between l- or d-ornithine (or certain other amino acids) and pyruvate (or certain other α-keto acids). There is correlation between the amino acids that cause inactivation and those that transaminate, and between the α-keto acids that reactivate the inactivated enzyme and those that transaminate. The rate of transamination is very low as compared to that of racemization. The enzyme exhibits optimal activity at about pH 11 for transamination. The racemase is only slightly inactivated by incubation with ornithine in the lower pH region in which the rate of transamination is low."
https://openalex.org/W1504589768,"Abstract UDP-glucuronic acid pyrophosphorylase was purified approximately 80-fold from barley seedlings by ammonium sulfate fractionation and column chromatography on DEAE-cellulose and Sephadex G-100. The partially purified enzyme can be assayed radiochemically in either the forward or reverse direction and has Km values of 0.33 mm and 0.5 mm for d-glucuronic acid 1-phosphate and UDP-d-glucuronic acid, respectively. Its pH optimum lies between pH 8 and 9. The equilibrium constant of the reaction is 2.9 measured in the direction of glucuronic acid 1-phosphate formation. Mg2+ best fulfills the requirement for divalent cations. However, this dependency is related to substrate concentration, and, on the basis of kinetic experiments, an Mg2+:UTP ratio of 2:1 in the forward direction and an Mg2+ to pyrophosphate ratio of about 1:1 in the reverse direction appear to be required for maximum activity. Excess Mg2+ inhibits the reaction. The total activity of the enzyme increased 15-fold during the first 6 days of germination and is present in amounts potentially sufficient to meet the full needs of the young plant for UDP-glucuronic acid in cell wall polysaccharide biosynthesis. By contrast, levels of UDP-glucose dehydrogenase were very low. This suggests that the pathway myo-inositol → glucuronic acid → glucuronic acid 1-phosphate → UDP-glucuronic acid may be the predominant route whereby UDP-glucuronic acid is formed in the young barley seedling."

The catabolic sequence in this pathway is: l-arginine → α-ketoarginine → γ-guanidinobutyrate → γ-aminobutyrate. Isotope from l-[U-14C]arginine is incorporated into trapping pools of all three intermediates and isotope from α-keto[U-14C]arginine is incorporated into pools of γ-guanidinobutyrate and γ-aminobutyrate. Cell-free extracts of cultures grown on l-arginine are induced for the evolution of ammonia from l-arginine, for the evolution of CO2 from α-ketoarginine, and for the hydrolytic removal of urea from γ-guanidinobutyrate. Cultures grown on dl-malate and exposed to l-arginine induce the synthesis of an l-arginine uptake system and of three enzymes of l-arginine catabolism. Induction of all three enzymes is coordinate but is preceded by induction of the uptake system."

The amounts vary with the vitamin A status of the liver and show an inverse relation to the concentration of ubiquinone. The results suggest a specific role of the Golgi apparatus in the mobilization or action, or both, of vitamin A compounds."
https://openalex.org/W1501515050,"Abstract C1 transfer to the Δ24 bond of 8,24-lanostadien-3β-ol (lanosterol) or of 9,19-cyclo-24-lanosten-3β-ol (cycloartenol) was inhibited by triparanol when either of the two steroids was incubated with methionine as the C1 source in a cell-free system from germinating peas. Specificity was demonstrated by the failure of triparanol to inhibit any of the steps between mevalonate and squalene. The mechanism of inhibition is probably through coordination of the lone electron pair of the nitrogen atom of triparanol with the electrophilic center of the enzyme which then interferes with binding of the Δ24 substrate to the enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1532746392,"Abstract A radioimmunoassay was used to detect luteinizing hormone (LH) bound to washed Leydig tumor cells. Tumor cell suspensions were incubated with LH at 37° and washed repeatedly by centrifugation with isotonic 0.9% NaCl solution. The tumor cells contained large quantities of LH even after they were washed sufficiently to produce a 106-fold dilution of unbound LH. Six washings (106-fold dilution) were no more effective in removing LH from the cells than three washings (103-fold dilution). Binding was not influenced by the temperature at which the cells were washed. The extent of LH binding was related to the number of cells, with approximately 5300 ± 960 molecules of LH bound per cell. LH binding was also proportional to the same concentrations of LH which produced a steroidogenic dose response curve. The binding constant of 1.5 x 10-8 m was considered to be higher than that expected for nontumorous tissues. Tumor cells bound more LH than did erythrocytes or thymocytes under the same conditions."
https://openalex.org/W1512332002,"Abstract δ-Aminolevulinate dehydratase purified from livers of Swiss Webster mice has a molecular weight of 250,000 by sedimentation-diffusion, gel filtration chromatography, and centrifugation in sucrose gradients. Each mole of enzyme can bind 6 moles of substrate as shown by reduction of the intermediate Schiff base with NaBH4. Denaturation with 6 m guanidine hydrochloride or sodium dodecyl sulfate in the presence of reducing agents dissociates the native enzyme into subunits of 39,500 molecular weight. No NH2-terminal amino acid can be detected after reaction with dansyl chloride. There are 14 arginine and 12 lysine residues per 39,500 g of δ-aminolevulinate dehydratase polypeptide. Hydrolysis with trypsin yields approximately 27 peptides, 14 of which contain arginine. All evidence is consistent with mouse liver δ-aminolevulinate dehydratase being composed of six identical polypeptide chains. Alleles at the levulinate locus control the level of hepatic δ-aminolevulinate dehydratase by regulating the rate at which the enzyme is synthesized. Combined isotopic and immunochemical techniques reveal no differences in the subunit composition, number of active sites, or pattern of tryptic peptides between δ-aminolevulinate dehydratase from inbred strains of mice homozygous for different alleles at the levulinate locus. These results provide additional evidence that mutations of the levulinate locus do not affect the primary structure of hepatic δ-aminolevulinate dehydratase."

https://openalex.org/W1509551765,"Abstract Two forms of acetoacetyl-CoA thiolase with different properties have been found in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The enzyme with isoelectric point pH 5.3 (thiolase 5.3) is found in the cytosol while that with isoelectric point pH 7.8 (thiolase 7.8) occurs in the mitochondria. When yeast are grown on glucose under aerobic conditions, thiolase activity shows two increases in activity during the growth period. Early in log phase, there is an increase in thiolase activity which subsequently reaches a plateau level. A second increase in activity at mid-log phase attains a peak value before decaying in late log to stationary phase. The biphasic curve is also observed during anaerobic growth on glucose or aerobic growth on galactose, indicating that removal of catabolite repression by glucose is unrelated to the rise in activity during midlog phase growth. A method for distinguishing the activities of both forms was developed. The early log phase activity contains predominantly thiolase 7.8, while the midlog phase increase in activity is due to thiolase 5.3. Growth on galactose, which provides higher levels of mitochondria in early log phase, indicated increased thiolase 7.8 activity. Since the same enzyme appears in anaerobic growth, it indicates that thiolase 7.8 is also located in the promitochondria. Yeast grown aerobically on glucose in the presence of d-threochloramphenicol, an inhibitor of mitochondrial development, exhibited no thiolase 7.8 activity, indicating that the expression of this enzyme is related to mitochondrial development. Thiolase 5.3 was not affected. The possibility that thiolase controls the level of acetoacetyl-CoA and acetyl-CoA, negative and positive effectors of pyruvic carboxylase, is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1548956980,"Abstract The labile sulfur of adrenodoxin was attacked by a nucleophile, triphenyl phosphine. The product was triphenyl phosphine sulfide regardless of the presence of O2. The stoichiometry between labile sulfur which disappeared and triphenyl phosphine sulfide formed was found to be 1:1. The initial rate of the reaction follows second order kinetics with a rate constant of 2 to 3 x 103 m-1 min-1 at 38° (pH 8.8) under aerobic and anaerobic conditions. The product of the minor reaction was found to be pyruvate after acid hydrolysis of the protein. The amount of pyruvate formed (about 1 mole per mole of protein) is roughly equal to those of cysteine residues lost and H2S evolved. There was no significant formation of alanine and serine by this reaction. The triphenyl phosphine-treated protein has no iron, no labile sulfur, one disulfide bond, 1 dehydroalanine, and 2 cysteine residues per molecule of the protein. On the basis of these observations, it is concluded that, upon reaction of triphenyl phosphine with adrenodoxin, the labile sulfur is removed as the phosphine sulfide, and that one of the sulfur atoms of the cysteine residues is liberated as H2S and results in the dehydroalanine residue in the polypeptide chain, which is quantitatively converted into pyruvate upon acid hydrolysis. This phenomenon is in contrast with the acid treatment which removes the labile sulfur as H2S but does not produce dehydroalanine. From the results of the triphenyl phosphine reactivity of model metal-sulfur compounds, Ni(C6H5CS3)(C6H5CS2) and Fe(C6H5CS3)2(C6H5CS2),it would be likely that the iron-sulfur grouping of adrenodoxin as its oxidation-reduction center consists of Fe—S—S— linkage, because the above model compounds contain the metal—S—S— linkage, as judged by x-ray crystallography (D. Coucouvanis and S. J. Lippard, J. Amer. Chem. Soc., 90, 3281 (1968)), and they react with triphenyl phosphine to yield its sulfide."
https://openalex.org/W2005249727,"It is not necessary that proline be hydroxylated for the completion and release of nascent collagen chains from polysomes. Hydroxylation of collagen proline in vivo normally takes place predominantly on nascent polypeptides; however, in the presence of an inhibitor of hydroxylation, unhydroxylated chains are released. These chains may subsequently be hydroxylated when the inhibition is removed. The results clarify a controversy over the site of proline hydroxylation."
https://openalex.org/W1576414414,"Abstract Thyroxine stimulates microsomal protein synthesis in vitro in the absence of mitochondria. Contrary to the reports of other investigators (Sokoloff, L., and Kaufman, S., J. Biol. Chem., 236, 795 (1961)), a stimulatory effect is observed when mitochondria are replaced by a phosphocreatine ATP-generating system if an appropriate Mg++ concentration is used. The effect observed in mitochondria-free systems is independent of changes in ATP concentration during the incubation. These findings imply that a significant contribution of mitochondria in previously reported protein synthetic systems relates to a capacity to generate ATP. The elimination of mitochondria as a requisite for thyroxine-stimulated protein synthesis simplifies future investigations of the mechanism of such stimulation in subcellular systems."

https://openalex.org/W1567290634,"A reductive synthesis of phenylpyruvate from phenylacetyl coenzyme A and bicarbonate was obtained in cell-free extracts from the photosynthetic bacterium Chromatium. This phenylpyruvate synthase activity—which appears to be distinct from pyruvate synthase—depends on the reducing power of ferredoxin and requires thiamine pyrophosphate as a coenzyme. Of several ferredoxins assayed, the native ferredoxin from Chromatium was found to be the most effective for phenylpyruvate synthesis. The enzyme extract also catalyzed the conversion of phenylpyruvate to phenylalanine (in the presence of an amino group donor) and the activation of phenylacetate to the phenylacetyl-CoA derivative. Thus, a net synthesis of phenylalanine from phenylacetate and CO2 was accomplished. Closely associated with the phenylpyruvate synthase reaction was an exchange reaction between 14C-bicarbonate and phenylpyruvate. The exchange reaction required thiamine pyrophosphate and CoA as cofactors. Apart from Chromatium, phenylpyruvate synthase and phenylpyruvate-bicarbonate exchange activities were also found in cell-free extracts from the green photosynthetic bacteria Chlorobium thiosulfatophilum and Chloropseudomonas ethylicum."
https://openalex.org/W1573169449,"Abstract The amino acid sequence of the coat protein from the RNA bacteriophage Qβ has been determined. Tryptic peptides which were obtained from the oxidized protein accounted for all of the amino acid residues in the protein. The sequence of the tryptic peptides was established by a combination of enzymatic fragmentation and Edman degradation. The tryptic peptides were ordered on the basis of overlap peptides obtained from chymotrypsin and thermolysin digests of the protein. The Qβ coat protein contains 131 residues, 2 more than the f2 or R17 coat proteins. The f2 and Qβ coat proteins have only 30 residues in common, even if five insertions and five deletions are allowed in the comparison. The regions of identity are clustered in intermittent stretches 3 to 5 residues in length near the middle of the sequence."

There was a significant decrease of CAT activity per milligram of protein in myasthenic muscle compared to normal muscle, and there was no difference in acetylcholinesterase activity per milligram of protein in the same muscle homogenates. Substrate concentration curves for acetyl coenzyme A and CAT also showed a significant reduction in the maximum rate of product formation (V(max)) per milligram of protein between myasthenic and normal muscle. It is postulated that binding of substrate to CAT is being inhibited by an inhibitor present in muscle."
