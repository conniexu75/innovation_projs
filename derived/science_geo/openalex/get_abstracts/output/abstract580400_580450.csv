https://openalex.org/W2588639388,"Positivity towards meat consumption remains strong, despite evidence of negative environmental and ethical outcomes. Although awareness of these repercussions is rising, there is still public resistance to removing meat from our diets. One potential method to alleviate these effects is to produce in vitro meat: meat grown in a laboratory that does not carry the same environmental or ethical concerns. However, there is limited research examining public attitudes towards in vitro meat, thus we know little about the capacity for it be accepted by consumers. This study aimed to examine perceptions of in vitro meat and identify potential barriers that might prevent engagement. Through conducting an online survey with US participants, we identified that although most respondents were willing to try in vitro meat, only one third were definitely or probably willing to eat in vitro meat regularly or as a replacement for farmed meat. Men were more receptive to it than women, as were politically liberal respondents compared with conservative ones. Vegetarians and vegans were more likely to perceive benefits compared to farmed meat, but they were less likely to want to try it than meat eaters. The main concerns were an anticipated high price, limited taste and appeal and a concern that the product was unnatural. It is concluded that people in the USA are likely to try in vitro meat, but few believed that it would replace farmed meat in their diet."

Cui et al. found that this relationship, the Wiedemann-Franz law, holds down to the atomic scale in gold and platinum (see the Perspective by Segal). They made thermal and electrical conductance measurements through a point contact only one atom thick. In gold, the thermal and electrical conductance was quantized, owing to the electronic band structure of the metal. The experiments pave the way for high-resolution calorimetry and other thermal measurements at the nanoscale. Science , this issue p. 1192 ; see also p. 1125"

The second phase is impaired in patients with type II diabetes, underscoring the importance of understanding its molecular basis. Lees et al. report a mechanism through which TMEM24, a lipid transport protein that concentrates at endoplasmic reticulum–plasma membrane contact sites, regulates the pulsatility of cytosolic Ca 2+ and phosphoinositide signaling.

https://openalex.org/W2588577136,"Objective Circulating microparticles (cMPs) are phospholipid-rich vesicles released from cells when activated or injured, and contribute to the formation of intracoronary thrombi. Tissue factor (TF, CD142) is the main trigger of fibrin formation and TF-carrying cMPs are considered one of the most procoagulant cMPs. Similar types of atherosclerotic lesions may lead to different types of AMI, although the mechanisms behind are unresolved. Therefore, we aimed to investigate the phenotype of cMPs found in plasma of ACS patients and its relation to AMI severity and thrombotic burden. Methods In a cross-sectional study, two hundred patients aged 75±4 years were included in the study 2–8 weeks after suffering an AMI. Annexin V positive (AV+)-cMPs derived from blood and vascular cells were measured by flow cytometry. Plasma procoagulant activity (TF-PCA) was measured through a chromogenic assay. Results STEMI patients (n = 75) showed higher levels of platelet-derived cMPs [CD61+/AV+, CD31+/AV+, CD42b+/AV+ and CD31+/CD42b+/AV+, P = 0.048, 0.038, 0.009 and 0.006, respectively], compared to NSTEMI patients (n = 125). Patients who suffered a heart failure during AMI (n = 17) had increased levels of platelet (CD61+)-and monocyte (CD14+)-derived cMPs carrying TF (CD142+) (P<0.0001 and 0.004, respectively). Additionally, NYHA class III (n = 23) patients showed higher levels of CD142+/AV+, CD14+/AV+ and CD14+/CD142+/AV+ cMPs than those in class I/II (P = 0.001, 0.015 and 0.014, respectively). The levels of these cMPs positively correlated with TF-PCA (r≥0.166, P≤0.027, all). Conclusions Platelets and monocytes remain activated in AMI patients treated as per guidelines and release cMPs that discriminate AMI severity. Therefore, TF-MPs, and platelet- and monocyte-MPs may reflect thrombotic burden in AMI patients."
https://openalex.org/W2588121500,"Imputation of human leukocyte antigen (HLA) alleles from SNP-level data is attractive due to importance of HLA alleles in human disease, widespread availability of genome-wide association study (GWAS) data, and expertise required for HLA sequencing. However, comprehensive evaluations of HLA imputations programs are limited. We compared HLA imputation results of HIBAG, SNP2HLA, and HLA*IMP:02 to sequenced HLA alleles in 3,265 samples from BioVU, a de-identified electronic health record database coupled to a DNA biorepository. We performed four-digit HLA sequencing for HLA-A, -B, -C, -DRB1, -DPB1, and -DQB1 using long-read 454 FLX sequencing. All samples were genotyped using both the Illumina HumanExome BeadChip platform and a GWAS platform. Call rates and concordance rates were compared by platform, frequency of allele, and race/ethnicity. Overall concordance rates were similar between programs in European Americans (EA) (0.975 [SNP2HLA]; 0.939 [HLA*IMP:02]; 0.976 [HIBAG]). SNP2HLA provided a significant advantage in terms of call rate and the number of alleles imputed. Concordance rates were lower overall for African Americans (AAs). These observations were consistent when accuracy was compared across HLA loci. All imputation programs performed similarly for low frequency HLA alleles. Higher concordance rates were observed when HLA alleles were imputed from GWAS platforms versus the HumanExome BeadChip, suggesting that high genomic coverage is preferred as input for HLA allelic imputation. These findings provide guidance on the best use of HLA imputation methods and elucidate their limitations."

https://openalex.org/W2588943247,"Bovine serum albumin (BSA) is an important transport protein of the blood and its aggregation/fibrillation would adversely affect its transport ability leading to metabolic disorder. Therefore, understanding the mechanism of fibrillation/aggregation of BSA and design of suitable inhibitor molecules for stabilizing its native conformation, are of utmost importance. The qualitative and quantitative aspects of the effect of osmolytes (proline, hydroxyproline, glycine betaine, sarcosine and sorbitol) on heat induced aggregation/fibrillation of BSA at physiological pH (pH 7.4) have been studied employing a combination of fluorescence spectroscopy, Rayleigh scattering, isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC), dynamic light scattering (DLS) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Formation of fibrils by BSA under the given conditions was confirmed from increase in fluorescence emission intensities of Thioflavin T over a time period of 600 minutes and TEM images. Absence of change in fluorescence emission intensities of 8-Anilinonaphthalene-1-sulfonic acid (ANS) in presence of native and aggregated BSA signify the absence of any amorphous aggregates. ITC results have provided important insights on the energetics of interaction of these osmolytes with different stages of the fibrillar aggregates of BSA, thereby suggesting the possible modes/mechanism of inhibition of BSA fibrillation by these osmolytes. The heats of interaction of the osmolytes with different stages of fibrillation of BSA do not follow a trend, suggesting that the interactions of stages of BSA aggregates are osmolyte specific. Among the osmolytes used here, we found glycine betaine to be supporting and promoting the aggregation process while hydroxyproline to be maximally efficient in suppressing the fibrillation process of BSA, followed by sorbitol, sarcosine and proline in the following order of their decreasing potency: Hydroxyproline> Sorbitol> Sarcosine> Proline> Glycine betaine."

On the basis of morphological characters and using the ITS1-5.8S-ITS2 region of the rDNA and the cytochrome oxidase subunit 1 (COI) as barcode genes, one of the two taxa was provisionally named as Phytophthora sp. prodigiosa, being closely related to but distinct from P. insolita, a species in Phytophthora Clade 9, while the other one, was closely related to but distinct from the Clade 2 species P. meadii and was informally designated as Phytophthora sp. mekongensis. Isolates of P. sp. prodigiosa and P. sp. mekongensis were also obtained from necrotic fibrous roots of Volkamer lemon (C. volkameriana) rootstocks grafted with 'King' mandarin (Citrus nobilis) and from trees of pomelo, respectively, in other provinces of the Mekong River Delta, indicating a widespread occurrence of both Phytophthora species in this citrus-growing area. Koch's postulates were fulfilled via pathogenicity tests on fruits of various Citrus species, including pomelo, grapefruit (Citrus x paradisi), sweet orange (Citrus x sinensis) and bergamot (Citrus x bergamia) as well as on the rootstock of 2-year-old trees of pomelo and sweet orange on 'Carrizo' citrange (C. sinensis 'Washington Navel' x Poncirus trifoliata). This is the first report of a Phytophthora species from Clade 2 other than P. citricola and P. citrophthora as causal agent of fruit brown rot of Citrus worldwide and the first report of P. insolita complex in Vietnam. Results indicate that likely Vietnam is still an unexplored reservoir of Phytophthora diversity."
https://openalex.org/W2588549714,"Bacterial sepsis involves a complex interaction between the host immune response and bacterial LPS. LPS binds Toll-like receptor (TLR) 4, which leads to the release of proinflammatory cytokines that are essential for a potent innate immune response against pathogens. The innate immune system is tightly regulated, as excessive inflammation can lead to organ failure and death. MicroRNAs have recently emerged as important regulators of the innate immune system. Here we determined the function of miR-718, which is conserved across mammals and overlaps with the 5′ UTR of the interleukin 1 receptor-associated kinase (IRAK1) gene. As IRAK1 is a key component of innate immune signaling pathways that are downstream of most TLRs, we hypothesized that miR-718 helps regulate the innate immune response. Activation of TLR4, but not TLR3, induced the expression of miR-718 in macrophages. miR-718 expression was also induced in the spleens of mice upon LPS injection. miR-718 modulates PI3K/Akt signaling by directly down-regulating phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), thereby promoting phosphorylation of Akt, which leads to a decrease in proinflammatory cytokine production. Phosphorylated Akt induces let-7e expression, which, in turn, down-regulates TLR4 and further diminishes TLR4-mediated proinflammatory signals. Decreased miR-718 expression is associated with bacterial burden during Neisseria gonorrhoeae infection and alters the infection dynamics of N. gonorrhoeae in vitro. Furthermore, miR-718 regulates the induction of LPS tolerance in macrophages. We propose a role for miR-718 in controlling TLR4 signaling and inflammatory cytokine signaling through a negative feedback regulation loop involving down-regulation of TLR4, IRAK1, and NF-κB.

Although endotoxin was discovered well over a century ago, the fundamental role of circulating endotoxin in the blood of most patients with septic shock remains enigmatic and a subject of considerable controversy (5Opal S.M. Endotoxins and other sepsis triggers.Contrib. Nephrol. 2010; 167: 14-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). The most potent microbial mediator implicated in the pathogenesis of sepsis and septic shock is bacterial LPS.

LPS engages the TLR4/MD2 receptor complex, leading to recruitment of MyD88. The MyD88-TLR4/MD2 signaling complex then recruits IRAK1, a key regulatory kinase in the TLR4/MD2 receptor pathway, which plays an essential role in TLR4 signaling (6Kawagoe T. Sato S. Matsushita K.

IRAK1 is phosphorylated during LPS activation, and the levels of IRAK1 protein subsequently decline as the protein is degraded. This chain of events triggers NF-κB activation, which results in the transcription of proinflammatory genes. The rapid induction of cytokines such as TNFα, IL-1β, and IL-6 is essential for immediate defense against infection and a long-lasting adaptive immunity against pathogens (11Suffredini A.F.

Although cytokine production is important for the efficient control of the dissemination of invading pathogens, overproduction of these cytokines (a condition known as septic shock syndrome) is harmful for the host and may lead to tissue damage, organ failure, and death (13Beutler B.

Thus, TLRs are double-edged swords, and abnormal activation of their signaling can be deleterious.

Recently, microRNAs (miRNAs) have emerged as key regulators of TLR signaling, and several miRNAs are induced by TLR activation, targeting mRNAs of genes that encode components of the TLR signaling pathway (14O'Neill L.A. Sheedy F.J. McCoy C.E. MicroRNAs: the fine-tuners of Toll-like receptor signalling.Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2011; 11: 163-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (706) Google Scholar). miRNAs are endogenous 18- to 24-nucleotide single-stranded noncoding RNA molecules that perform important regulatory functions in animals by targeting mRNAs for cleavage or translational repression. This process involves base-pairing between the miRNAs and a partially complementary sequence in the 3′ UTRs of their target mRNAs (15Bartel D.P.

Many mammalian miRNAs are located within introns or exons of other protein-coding and non-coding genes (17Griffiths-Jones S. Saini H.K. van Dongen S.

Despite the large number of miRNAs transcribed from host genes, only a few have been studied in detail, and any functional relationship with their host genes is poorly understood. Here we report that the evolutionarily conserved miR-718, which overlaps with the 5′ UTR of the IRAK1 gene, is induced by LPS and is a negative regulator of inflammation in macrophages. We determined the role of miR-718 in mediating innate immune responses and the mechanism by which it controls the intensity of the inflammatory response in macrophages through targeting PTEN (a protein/lipid phosphatase that acts as a negative regulator of the PI3K/Akt pathway). Understanding the role of miR-718 in LPS-activated cells may help with the design of novel interventions for sepsis and potentially expand the use of Anti-miR-718 to treat inflammatory diseases beyond sepsis. Using our genome analysis pipeline, we identified several miRNAs that are hosted by innate immunity protein-coding genes (supplemental Table S1). We prioritized miR-718 for further study, as it was within the 5′ UTR of IRAK1, which encodes interleukin 1 receptor-associated kinase 1, a key component of TLR and IL-1R signaling pathways (Fig. 1, A and B). Furthermore, pre-miR-718 is highly conserved in mammals (Fig. 1C), prompting us to further characterize its role in the regulation of inflammation. miR-718 also overlaps with the 5′ UTR of Irak1 in the mouse genome (Fig. 1D). In immortalized BMDMs (iBMDMs), miR-718 was induced by LPS (Fig. 2A) and lipo-oligosaccharide stimulation (supplemental Fig. S1A), both of which are strong stimulators of IRAK1. This is similar to miR-146, which is a classical LPS-induced miRNA (supplemental Fig. S1B). In contrast, miR-718 was not induced in iBMDMs stimulated with poly(I:C), a TLR3 ligand (supplemental Fig. S1A). miR-718 was not induced in IRAK1-deficient cells, consistent with the large deletion in the region of the IRAK1 gene in these mice that encompasses the miR-718 locus; i.e. IRAK1 knockout mice are actually Irak1/miR-718 double knockouts (dKOs) (Fig. 2A) (8Thomas J.A. Allen J.L. Tsen M. Dubnicoff T. Danao J. Liao X.C. Cao Z. Wasserman S.A. Impaired cytokine signaling in mice lacking the IL-1 receptor-associated kinase.J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 978-984Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To identify maximal induction of miR-718 expression upon bacterial infection, we infected iBMDMs with Neisseria gonorrhoeae at an increasing multiplicity of infection (m.o.i.). miR-718 was induced in a dose-dependent manner in N. gonorrhoeae-infected wild-type macrophages (Fig. 2B) but not in Irak1/miR-718-dKO macrophages. miR-718 was also induced in other cell types, such as immortalized microglia cells (Fig. 2C). To examine whether miR-718 was induced under in vivo conditions, we determined the expression of miR-718 in the spleens of mice intraperitoneally injected with LPS. miR-718 levels were significantly increased 4 h after LPS administration (Fig. 2D). Because miR-718 was induced in LPS-stimulated macrophages, we investigated whether miR-718 miRNA regulates immune genes. Using lentiviral vectors, we generated a stable miR-718-expressing cell line (miR-718). This system allows the expression of miRNA precursor transcripts in their native sequence context to ensure interaction with endogenous processing machinery, leading to authentic mature miRNAs. As a control, we generated a stable cell line expressing the corresponding empty vector (Con miR). We also used shRNA-mediated miR-718 knockdown to establish a stable cell line suppressing miR-718 (Anti-miR-718) and used the corresponding empty vector to generate a stable control cell line (Con Inh). To assess the kinetics of LPS-induced miR-718 expression, IRAK1 expression, and TNFα production, miR-718 and Anti-miR-718 macrophages were treated with LPS and harvested at various time points from 2 to 24 h. miR-718 was potently induced within 2 h of stimulation, peaked at 12 h, and was significantly decreased at 24 h, suggesting that miR-718 is an early-induced miRNA (Fig. 3, A and B). Increased expression of miR-718 led to decreased expression of Irak1 mRNA (Fig. 3C). Similarly, decreased expression of miR-718 led to increased expression of Irak1 mRNA (Fig. 3D). TNFα protein levels were decreased when miR-718 was overexpressed (Fig. 3E) and increased when miR-718 was silenced (Fig. 3F). Similar trends were observed for TNFα production at various concentrations of LPS (supplemental Fig. S2, A and B). Cells treated with LPS and nigericin also secreted less IL-1β when miR-718 was overexpressed (supplemental Fig. S2C). We confirmed that Irak1 protein levels were significantly decreased in miR-718-overexpressing macrophages, including under basal conditions when endogenous miR-718 levels are low (Fig. 2G). Infection of Anti-miR-718 cells with various m.o.i. of N. gonorrhoeae led to a significant increase in TNFα production (supplemental Fig. S2D). Upon recognition of specific pathogen-associated molecular patterns, most TLRs activate pathways that lead to the nuclear translocation of the transcription factor NF-κB, which regulates the transcription of proinflammatory cytokines. To investigate whether miR-718 expression affects NF-κB activity, we co-transfected an NF-κB-Luc reporter construct as well as an miR-718 construct or an empty vector into 293T cells. We detected a significant decrease in NF-κB activity in the presence of miR-718, suggesting that miR-718 negatively regulates NF-κB activity (Fig. 4A and supplemental Fig. S3A). In the canonical NF-κB pathway, the p65 (RelA) and p50 subunits form heterodimers that bind DNA and regulate transcription. In a resting state, these subunits interact with IκBα in the cytoplasm. Upon activation of this pathway, IκBα is ubiquitinated and degraded, which leads to the release of the p65 and p50 subunits and their subsequent translocation into the nucleus. In miR-718 cells, IkBα degradation is inhibited upon LPS stimulation (Fig. 4B), suggesting that it is still bound to p65 in the cytosol. To confirm these results, we stained for p65 and performed immunofluorescence studies to assess p65 translocation into the nucleus in the presence and absence of miR-718. In resting cells, p65 is predominantly located in the cytosol of macrophages (Fig. 4, C, first and third rows, and D). In control cells, LPS stimulation resulted in the rapid translocation of p65 into the nucleus in the vast majority of cells (Fig. 4, C, second row, and D), whereas, in macrophages expressing miR-718, p65 failed to translocate into the nucleus in most of the cells (Fig. 4, C, fourth row, and D), suggesting that there is a distinct intracellular distribution of p65 and, therefore, NF-κB activation in macrophages expressing miR-718. Although we demonstrated that miR-718 controls proinflammatory cytokine production, its direct target(s) remained to be identified. Based on sequence complementarity between miR-718 and PTEN mRNA, PTEN was a predicted miR-718 target (Fig. 5A). PTEN was recently confirmed by another study to be targeted by miR-718 (23Xue M. Yao S. Hu M. Li W. Hao T. Zhou F. Zhu X. Lu H. Qin D. Yan Q. Zhu J. Gao S.J. Lu C.

To validate that miR-718 suppresses PTEN expression and function and to determine whether miR-718 could directly repress PTEN mRNA through a 3′ UTR interaction, we co-transfected 293T cells with a PTEN-3′ UTR-Luc reporter construct in the absence and presence of the miR-718 expression vector. We observed a significant reduction in luciferase levels in cells co-expressing PTEN-3′ UTR-Luc and miR-718 (Fig. 5B and supplemental Fig. S4A). In contrast, no change in luciferase activity was observed in the presence of miR-416, suggesting that PTEN is specifically targeted by miR-718 (Fig. 5B). PTEN is a PI3K-specific phosphatase that negatively regulates the Akt signaling pathway, and levels of PTEN expression inversely correlate with Akt phosphorylation (24Wan X. Helman L.J. Levels of PTEN protein modulate Akt phosphorylation on serine 473, but not on threonine 308, in IGF-II-overexpressing rhabdomyosarcomas cells.Oncogene. 2003; 22: 8205-8211Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Thus, we examined the protein levels of PTEN and phosphorylated Akt in macrophages overexpressing miR-718. As expected, overexpression of miR-718 led to decreased expression of PTEN and increased levels of phosphorylated Akt (Fig. 5C). Immunofluorescence studies also demonstrated that PTEN was down-regulated in miR-718 macrophages (Fig. 5D, bottom panels), whereas it was highly expressed in Anti-miR-718 macrophages (supplemental Fig. S4B, bottom panel). In contrast, the phosphorylated form of Akt was highly expressed in miR-718 macrophages (Fig. 5E, bottom panels), whereas it was down-regulated in Anti-miR-718 macrophages (supplemental Fig. S4C, bottom panel). These data suggest that PTEN protein levels are decreased by overexpression of miR-718, which, in turn, enhances PI3K/Akt signaling. The Akt pathway prevents excessive innate immune responses via limiting Th1 polarization (25Fukao T. Koyasu S. PI3K and negative regulation of TLR signaling.Trends Immunol. 2003; 24: 358-363Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (514) Google Scholar, 26Fukao T. Tanabe M. Terauchi Y. Ota T. Matsuda S.

To assess whether the miR-718-induced suppression of proinflammatory cytokine expression occurred through the activation of the Akt pathway, we inactivated Akt using Akt inhibitor IV. miR-718 macrophages failed to suppress TNFα production in the presence of the Akt inhibitor (Fig. 5F). We confirmed these results by using two additional Akt inhibitors (API-1 and MK-2206) (supplemental Fig. S4, D and E) and Anti-miR-718 cells (supplemental Fig. S4F). Overall, these data indicated that, by targeting PTEN, miR-718 suppresses the production of proinflammatory cytokines through activation of Akt. LPS induces the release of proinflammatory cytokines through the innate immune receptor TLR4. Cell surface expression of TLR4 impacts the extent of this response and, therefore, should be tightly regulated. To test whether miR-718 expression can affect TLR4, we measured TLR4 cell surface expression by flow cytometric analysis of unstimulated and LPS-stimulated Con miR and miR-718 macrophages. LPS stimulation down-regulated TLR4 expression in Con miR cells (Fig. 6A). In contrast, TLR4 was already expressed at low levels in unstimulated miR-718 macrophages, and, therefore, LPS stimulation only caused a minor reduction in TLR4 levels. To confirm these results, we used a strategy in which cell surface proteins were biotinylated and subsequently immunoprecipitated and purified using NeutrAvidin gel. We observed reduced biotinylated TLR4 in miR-718 cells compared with Con miR cells, suggesting that miR-718 is inducing the internalization and subsequent degradation of the receptor (Fig. 6B). There was no significant change in cell surface expression of TLR4 in Irak1/miR-718-dKO macrophages, suggesting that miR-718 expression is indeed required to suppress TLR4 expression and functions as a physiological inhibitor of TLR4 expression. To test whether miR-718 suppresses TLR4 expression via activation of Akt, we pretreated unstimulated and LPS-stimulated Con miR, miR-718, and TLR4-KO macrophages with an Akt inhibitor. In the presence of Akt inhibitor IV, miR-718 failed to suppress TLR4 expression, suggesting that miR-718-mediated down-regulation of TLR4 is through the activation of Akt (Fig. 6C). These results were confirmed using an additional Akt inhibitor (MK-2206) (supplemental Fig. S5A). Phosphorylated Akt induces the production of let-7e, which targets TLR4 (27Androulidaki A.

To test whether miR-718 is suppressing TLR4 through the Akt-mediated induction of let-7e, we pretreated unstimulated and LPS-stimulated Con miR and miR-718 macrophages with an Akt inhibitor. miR-718 induced let-7e production in an Akt-dependent manner, as let-7e production was markedly decreased in the presence of Akt inhibitor IV (Fig. 6D) A similar experiment using an additional Akt inhibitor (MK-2206) was performed, and similar results were obtained (supplemental Fig. S5B). Finally, to determine whether miR-718-mediated suppression of TLR4 expression is via let-7e, we transfected Con miR, miR-718, and TLR4-KO macrophages with let-7e antisense. In the absence of let-7e, miR-718 failed to repress TLR4 expression (Fig. 6E), whereas introduction of let-7e restored the ability of miR-718 to suppress TLR4 expression, as determined by qPCR (Fig. 6F). These results suggest that the Akt-mediated up-regulation of let-7e is crucial for miR-718 to suppress TLR4 expression. To determine whether the suppression of the LPS-triggered TLR4 signaling responses in miR-718 macrophages is derived from the altered expression of let-7e, we transfected Con miR and miR-718 macrophages with as-let-7e and stimulated the cells with LPS. In the absence of let-7e, miR-718 no longer repressed TNFα production (Fig. 6G), whereas the introduction of let-7e abolished TNFα production (supplemental Fig. S5C). These results suggest that let-7e mediates the miR-718 suppression of TNFα production. Given that miR-718 affects PTEN expression and Akt regulates endotoxin sensitivity and tolerance (27Androulidaki A. Iliopoulos D. Arranz A. Doxaki C. Schworer S. Zacharioudaki V. Margioris A.N. Tsichlis P.N. Tsatsanis C. The kinase Akt1 controls macrophage response to lipopolysaccharide by regulating microRNAs.Immunity. 2009; 31: 220-231Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar), we investigated whether miR-718 controls LPS tolerance. BMDMs were primed with a low concentration of LPS for 18 h, and then the cells were washed and restimulated with various concentrations of LPS for 5 h. TNFα was measured in the culture supernatants. miR-718 macrophages became tolerant to subsequent LPS stimulation and produced significantly lower levels of TNFα (supplemental Fig. S6A), whereas blockade of miR-718 expression abrogated the induction of LPS-induced tolerance (supplemental Fig. S6B). These results suggest that miR-718 mediates LPS tolerance in macrophages. To test directly whether miR-718 expression is involved in macrophage immune responses against N. gonorrhoeae infection, we infected Con Inh and Anti-miR-718 macrophages with N. gonorrhoeae and assessed the number of colony-forming units detected over time in cells. Anti-miR-718 macrophages exhibited the ability to control N. gonorrhoeae replication, and markedly fewer bacteria were recovered from Anti-miR-718 macrophages compared with Con Inh macrophages (supplemental Fig. S6C). In contrast, a significantly higher bacterial burden was detected in miR-718 macrophages (supplemental Fig. S6D). Overall, these results suggest that miR-718 contributes to immune responses against N. gonorrhoeae infection. We demonstrate that miR-718 is an anti-inflammatory miRNA that overlaps with the 5′ UTR of the Irak1 gene. Indeed, the coupled expression of miR-718 and its host transcript, Irak1, ensures that this miRNA will be available to regulate Irak1 whenever it is activated (29Barik S. An intronic microRNA silences genes that are functionally antagonistic to its host gene.Nucleic Acids Res. 2008; 36: 5232-5241Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). There are other examples of miRNAs encoded within protein-coding genes that regulate their host gene; for example, the expression of miR-9-1, which is encoded in intron 2 of the human CROC-4 gene, highly correlates with the expression of this gene (30Jeffrey P.L. Capes-Davis A. Dunn J.M. Tolhurst O. Seeto G. Hannan A.J. Lin S.L. CROC-4: a novel brain specific transcriptional activator of c-fos expressed from proliferation through to maturation of multiple neuronal cell types.Mol. Cell Neurosci. 2000; 16: 185-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Irak1 is a key component of an inflammatory pathway that is downstream of most TLRs. The transcription of miR-718 from the same genomic location provides a tightly controlled negative feedback loop that potentially protects mammals from excessive inflammation and tissue damage. We validated PTEN as a target of miR-718. PTEN was originally identified as a tumor suppressor gene, mutated in various cancers (31Li J. Yen C. Liaw D. Podsypanina K. Bose S. Wang S.I. Puc J.

https://openalex.org/W2588529042,"Background Existing studies have suggested decreased adherence and rebound in mortality in perinatally HIV-infected adolescents receiving antiretroviral therapy (ART) as compared to adults and young children. Methods We used both quantitative and qualitative approaches to identify factors influencing adherence among perinatally infected adolescents in Thailand. We analyzed data from 568 pairs of perinatally infected adolescents (aged 12–19) and their primary caregivers in the Teens Living With Antiretrovirals (TEEWA) study, a cross-sectional survey conducted in 2010–2012. We also conducted 12 in-depth interviews in 2014 with infected adolescents or their primary caregivers to elicit experiences of living with long-term ART. Results From the quantitative analysis, a total of 275 (48.4%) adolescents had evidence of suboptimal adherence based on this composite outcome: adolescents self-reported missing doses in the past 7 days, caregiver rating of overall adherence as suboptimal, or latest HIV-RNA viral load ≥1000 copies/ml. In multivariate logistic regression analysis, younger age, having grandparents or extended family members as the primary caregiver, caregiver-assessed poor intellectual ability, having a boy/girlfriend, frequent online chatting, self-reported unhappiness and easiness in asking doctors questions were significantly associated with suboptimal adherence. From the in-depth interviews, tensed relationships with caregivers, forgetfulness due to busy schedules, and fear of disclosing HIV status to others, especially boy/girlfriends, were important contributors to suboptimal adherence. Social and emotional support and counseling from peer group was consistently reported as a strong adherence-promoting factor. Conclusion Our findings highlight unique barriers of ART adherence among the perinatally infected adolescents. Future interventions should be targeted at helping adolescents to improve interpersonal relationships and build adaptive skills in recognizing and addressing challenging situations related to ART taking."
https://openalex.org/W2588195875,"During gestation, fetal nutrition is entirely dependent on maternal diet. Maternal consumption of excess fat during pregnancy has been linked to an increased risk of neurologic disorders in offspring, including attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder, autism, and schizophrenia. In a mouse model, high-fat diet (HFD)-fed offspring have cognitive and executive function deficits as well as whole-genome DNA and promoter-specific hypomethylation in multiple brain regions. Dietary methyl donor supplementation during pregnancy or adulthood has been used to alter DNA methylation and behavior. Given that extensive brain development occurs during early postnatal life-particularly within the prefrontal cortex (PFC), a brain region critical for executive function-we examined whether early life methyl donor supplementation (e.g., during adolescence) could ameliorate executive function deficits observed in offspring that were exposed to maternal HFD. By using operant testing, progressive ratio, and the PFC-dependent 5-choice serial reaction timed task (5-CSRTT), we determined that F1 female offspring (B6D2F1/J) from HFD-fed dams have decreased motivation (decreased progressive ratio breakpoint) and require a longer stimulus length to complete the 5-CSRTT task successfully, whereas early life methyl donor supplementation increased motivation and shortened the minimum stimulus length required for a correct response in the 5-CSRTT. Of interest, we found that expression of 2 chemokines, CCL2 and CXCL10, correlated with the median stimulus length in the 5-CSRTT. Furthermore, we found that acute adult supplementation of methyl donors increased motivation in HFD-fed offspring and those who previously received supplementation with methyl donors. These data point to early life as a sensitive time during which dietary methyl donor supplementation can alter PFC-dependent cognitive behaviors.-McKee, S. E., Grissom, N. M., Herdt, C. T., Reyes, T. M. Methyl donor supplementation alters cognitive performance and motivation in female offspring from high-fat diet-fed dams."
https://openalex.org/W2587824133,"We tested the hypothesis that a 6-week regimen of simvastatin would attenuate skeletal muscle adaptation to low-intensity exercise. Male C57BL/6J wildtype mice were subjected to 6-weeks of voluntary wheel running or normal cage activities with or without simvastatin treatment (20 mg/kg/d, n = 7-8 per group). Adaptations in in vivo fatigue resistance were determined by a treadmill running test, and by ankle plantarflexor contractile assessment. The tibialis anterior, gastrocnemius, and plantaris muscles were evaluated for exercised-induced mitochondrial adaptations (i.e., biogenesis, function, autophagy). There was no difference in weekly wheel running distance between control and simvastatin-treated mice (P = 0.51). Trained mice had greater treadmill running distance (296%, P<0.001), and ankle plantarflexor contractile fatigue resistance (9%, P<0.05) compared to sedentary mice, independent of simvastatin treatment. At the cellular level, trained mice had greater mitochondrial biogenesis (e.g., ~2-fold greater PGC1α expression, P<0.05) and mitochondrial content (e.g., 25% greater citrate synthase activity, P<0.05), independent of simvastatin treatment. Mitochondrial autophagy-related protein contents were greater in trained mice (e.g., 40% greater Bnip3, P<0.05), independent of simvastatin treatment. However, Drp1, a marker of mitochondrial fission, was less in simvastatin treated mice, independent of exercise training, and there was a significant interaction between training and statin treatment (P<0.022) for LC3-II protein content, a marker of autophagy flux. These data indicate that whole body and skeletal muscle adaptations to endurance exercise training are attainable with simvastatin treatment, but simvastatin may have side effects on muscle mitochondrial maintenance via autophagy, which could have long-term implications on muscle health."

Most of currently available drugs for insomnia develop dependency and/or adverse effects. Hence natural therapies could be an alternative choice of treatment for insomnia. The root or whole plant extract of Ashwagandha (Withania somnifera) has been used to induce sleep in Indian system of traditional home medicine, Ayurveda. However, its active somnogenic components remain unidentified. We investigated the effect of various components of Ashwagandha leaf on sleep regulation by oral administration in mice. We found that the alcoholic extract that contained high amount of active withanolides was ineffective to induce sleep in mice. However, the water extract which contain triethylene glycol as a major component induced significant amount of non-rapid eye movement sleep with slight change in rapid eye movement sleep. Commercially available triethylene glycol also increased non-rapid eye movement sleep in mice in a dose-dependent (10–30 mg/mouse) manner. These results clearly demonstrated that triethylene glycol is an active sleep-inducing component of Ashwagandha leaves and could potentially be useful for insomnia therapy."

These unique changes allowed us to assess the impact of the different pneumococcal vaccination policies on PCV13 uptake in infants and on the incidence rate (IR) of invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) in children <15 years old. In this prospective, active, surveillance study, we estimated PCV13 uptakes, IR and incidence rate ratios (IRR) for total IPD and for IPD caused by PCV13- and non-PCV13 serotypes in children <15 years, stratified by age, in four periods with different vaccination policies: fully government-funded PCV7 vaccination, fully government-funded PCV13, mixed public/private funding and only private funding. Vaccine uptakes reached 95% in periods with public-funded pneumococcal vaccination, but fell to 67% in the private funding period. Overall, IR of IPD decreased by 68% (p<0.001) in 2014–15, due to 93% reduction in the IR of PCV13-type IPD (p<0.001) without significant changes in non-PCV13-type IPD. A fully government-funded PCV13 vaccination program lead to high vaccine uptake and dramatic reductions in both overall and PCV13-type IPD IR. When this program was switched to private PCV13 vaccination, there was a fall in vaccine coverage and stagnation in the decline of PCV13-type IPD with data suggesting a weakening of herd immunity."
https://openalex.org/W2588897494,"Mannan binding lectin (MBL), initially reported to activate the complement pathway, is also known to be involved in the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases. We report a thus far unknown function of MBL as a suppressor of T-cell activation. MBL markedly inhibited T-cell proliferation induced by anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 antibodies. Moreover, the presence of MBL during T-cell priming interfered with proximal T-cell receptor signaling by decreasing phosphorylation of Lck, ZAP-70, and LAT. MBL bound to T cells through interaction between the collagen-like region of MBL and calreticulin (CRT) expressed on the T-cell surface. The neutralizing antibody against CRT abrogated MBL-mediated suppression of T-cell proliferation, suggesting that MBL down-modulates T-cell proliferation via cell surface CRT. We further demonstrated that the feature of MBL-mediated T-cell suppression is shared by other serum collectins (e.g., C1q and collectin 11). The concentrations of MBL correlated negatively with in vivo T-cell activation status in patients with early-stage silicosis. Furthermore, MBL efficiently inhibited activation and proliferation of autoreactive T cells derived from patients with silicosis, indicating that MBL serves as a negative feedback control of the T-cell responses.-Zhao, N., Wu, J., Xiong, S., Zhang, L., Lu, X., Chen, S., Wu, Q., Wang, H., Liu, Y., Chen, Z., Zuo, D.

https://openalex.org/W2588656651,"For broadly distributed, often overexploited species such as elasmobranchs (sharks and rays), conservation management would benefit from understanding how life history traits change in response to local environmental and ecological factors. However, fishing obfuscates this objective by causing complex and often mixed effects on the life histories of target species. Disentangling the many drivers of life history variability requires knowledge of elasmobranch populations in the absence of fishing, which is rarely available. Here, we describe the growth, maximum size, sex ratios, size at maturity, and offer a direct estimate of survival of an unfished population of grey reef sharks (Carcharhinus amblyrhynchos) using data from an eight year tag-recapture study. We then synthesized published information on the life history of C. amblyrhynchos from across its geographic range, and for the first time, we attempted to disentangle the contribution of fishing from geographic variation in an elasmobranch species. For Palmyra’s unfished C. amblyrhynchos population, the von Bertalanffy growth function (VBGF) growth coefficient k was 0.05 and asymptotic length L∞ was 163.3 cm total length (TL). Maximum size was 175.5 cm TL from a female shark, length at maturity was estimated at 116.7–123.2 cm TL for male sharks, maximum lifespan estimated from VBGF parameters was 18.1 years for both sexes combined, and annual survival was 0.74 year-1. Consistent with findings from studies on other elasmobranch species, we found significant intraspecific variability in reported life history traits of C. amblyrhynchos. However, contrary to what others have reported, we did not find consistent patterns in life history variability as a function of biogeography or fishing. Ultimately, the substantial, but not yet predictable variability in life history traits observed for C. amblyrhynchos across its geographic range suggests that regional management may be necessary to set sustainable harvest targets and to recover this and other shark species globally."

Few studies have been focused on the maturity that has been considered as one of the most critical traits for the determination of the adaptation-growing region of the soybean. In the current study, two hundred and ninty-nine accessions of MCC planted for two years at four locations namely in Heihe, Harbin, Jining and Wuhan cities in China were used to assess the variation of maturity in MCC and identify the integrated effect of 4 E loci on flowering and maturity time in soybean. Forty-two North American varieties served as references of maturity groups (MG). Each accession in MCC was classified by comparing with the MG references in the days from VE (emergence) and physiological maturity (R7). The results showed that MCC covered a large range of MGs from MG000 to MGIX/X. Original locations and sowing types were revealed as the major affecting factors for maturity groups of the MCC accessions. The ratio of the reproductive period to the vegetative period (R/V) varied among MCC accessions. Genotyping of 4 maturity genes (i.e. E1, E2, E3 and E4) in 228 accessions indicated that recessive alleles e1, e2, e3 and e4 promoted earlier flowering and shortened the maturity time with different effects, while the dominate alleles were always detected in accessions with longer maturity. The allelic combinations determined the diversification of soybean maturity groups and adaptation to different regions. Our results indicated that the maturity of Chinese soybean MCC showed genetic diversities in phenotype and genotype, which provided information for further MG classification, geographic adaptation analysis of Chinese soybean cultivars, as well as developing new soybean varieties with adaptation to specific regions."
https://openalex.org/W2587787356,"Background Interest in nephrology careers among internal medicine residents in the United States is declining. Our objective was to assess the impact of the presence of a nephrology fellowship training program on perceptions and career interest in nephrology among internal medicine residents. A secondary objective was to identify commonly endorsed negative perceptions of nephrology among internal medicine residents. Methods This was a repeated cross-sectional survey of internal medicine residents before (Group 1) and 3 years after (Group 2) the establishment of nephrology fellowship programs at two institutions. The primary outcome was the percentage of residents indicating nephrology as a career interest in Group 1 vs. Group 2. Secondary outcomes included the frequency that residents agreed with negative statements about nephrology. Results 131 (80.9%) of 162 residents completed the survey. 19 (14.8%) residents indicated interest in a nephrology career, with 8 (6.3%) indicating nephrology as their first choice. There was no difference in career interest in nephrology between residents who were exposed to nephrology fellows during residency training (Group 2) and residents who were not (Group 1). The most commonly endorsed negative perceptions of nephrology were: nephrology fellows have long hours/burdensome call (36 [28.1%] of residents agreed or strongly agreed), practicing nephrologists must take frequent/difficult call (35 [27.6%] agreed or strongly agreed), and nephrology has few opportunities for procedures (35 [27.3%] agreed or strongly agreed). More residents in Group 2 agreed that nephrology is poorly paid (8.9% in Group 1 vs. 20.8% in Group 2, P = 0.04), whereas more residents in Group 1 agreed that nephrologists must take frequent/difficult call (40.0% in Group 1 vs. 18.1% in Group 2, P = 0.02). Conclusions The initiation of a nephrology fellowship program was not associated with an increase in internal medicine residents’ interest in nephrology careers. Residents endorsed several negative perceptions of nephrology, which may affect career choice."
https://openalex.org/W2588153308,"It is commonly assumed that how individuals identify on the political spectrum-whether liberal, conservative, or moderate-has a universal meaning when it comes to policy stances and voting behavior. But, does political identity mean the same thing from place to place? Using data collected from across the U.S. we find that even when people share the same political identity, those in ""bluer"" locations are more likely to support left-leaning policies and vote for Democratic candidates than those in ""redder"" locations. Because the meaning of political identity is inconsistent across locations, individuals who share the same political identity sometimes espouse opposing policy stances. Meanwhile, those with opposing identities sometimes endorse identical policy stances. Such findings suggest that researchers, campaigners, and pollsters must use caution when extrapolating policy preferences and voting behavior from political identity, and that animosity toward the other end of the political spectrum is sometimes misplaced."
https://openalex.org/W2588771218,"Mutations in retinitis pigmentosa 2 (RP2) account for 10–20% of X-linked retinitis pigmentosa (RP) cases. The encoded RP2 protein is implicated in ciliary trafficking of myristoylated and prenylated proteins in photoreceptor cells. To date >70 mutations in RP2 have been identified. How these mutations disrupt the function of RP2 is not fully understood. Here we report a novel in-frame 12-bp deletion (c.357_368del, p.Pro120_Gly123del) in zebrafish rp2. The mutant zebrafish shows reduced rod phototransduction proteins and progressive retinal degeneration. Interestingly, the protein level of mutant Rp2 is almost undetectable, whereas its mRNA level is near normal, indicating a possible post-translational effect of the mutation. Consistent with this hypothesis, the equivalent 12-bp deletion in human RP2 markedly impairs RP2 protein stability and reduces its protein level. Furthermore, we found that a majority of the RP2 pathogenic mutations (including missense, single-residue deletion, and C-terminal truncation mutations) severely destabilize the RP2 protein. The destabilized RP2 mutant proteins are degraded via the proteasome pathway, resulting in dramatically decreased protein levels. The remaining non-destabilizing mutations T87I, R118H/R118G/R118L/R118C, E138G, and R211H/R211L are suggested to impair the interaction between RP2 and its protein partners (such as ARL3) or with as yet unknown partners. By utilizing a combination of in silico, in vitro, and in vivo approaches, our work comprehensively indicates that loss of RP2 protein structural stability is the predominating pathogenic consequence for most RP2 mutations. Our study also reveals a role of the C-terminal domain of RP2 in maintaining the overall protein stability. Mutations in retinitis pigmentosa 2 (RP2) account for 10–20% of X-linked retinitis pigmentosa (RP) cases. The encoded RP2 protein is implicated in ciliary trafficking of myristoylated and prenylated proteins in photoreceptor cells. To date >70 mutations in RP2 have been identified. How these mutations disrupt the function of RP2 is not fully understood. Here we report a novel in-frame 12-bp deletion (c.357_368del, p.Pro120_Gly123del) in zebrafish rp2. The mutant zebrafish shows reduced rod phototransduction proteins and progressive retinal degeneration. Interestingly, the protein level of mutant Rp2 is almost undetectable, whereas its mRNA level is near normal, indicating a possible post-translational effect of the mutation. Consistent with this hypothesis, the equivalent 12-bp deletion in human RP2 markedly impairs RP2 protein stability and reduces its protein level. Furthermore, we found that a majority of the RP2 pathogenic mutations (including missense, single-residue deletion, and C-terminal truncation mutations) severely destabilize the RP2 protein. The destabilized RP2 mutant proteins are degraded via the proteasome pathway, resulting in dramatically decreased protein levels. The remaining non-destabilizing mutations T87I, R118H/R118G/R118L/R118C, E138G, and R211H/R211L are suggested to impair the interaction between RP2 and its protein partners (such as ARL3) or with as yet unknown partners.

By acting as a GTPase-activating protein (GAP) specifically for ARL3, RP2 plays a role in the ciliary trafficking of myristoylated and prenylated proteins (5.Zhang H. Hanke-Gogokhia C. Jiang L. Li X.

Binding of RP2 to GNB1 also facilitates the membrane association and traffic of GNB1 probably in an ARL3-independent manner (14.Schwarz N. Novoselova T.V. Wait R. Hardcastle A.J. Cheetham M.E. The X-linked retinitis pigmentosa protein RP2 facilitates G protein traffic.Hum. Mol. Genet. 2012; 21: 863-873Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The pathogenic mutations R118H and E138G drastically reduce the affinity of RP2 to ARL3 (11.Kühnel K. Veltel S. Schlichting I. Wittinghofer A.

The C-terminal NDPK domain of RP2 shows sequence and structure similarity to the nucleotide diphosphate kinases. Nevertheless, due to the variations around the active site, it is unlikely that RP2 protein has kinase activity (11.Kühnel K. Veltel S. Schlichting I. Wittinghofer A. Crystal structure of the human retinitis pigmentosa 2 protein and its interaction with Arl3.Structure. 2006; 14: 367-378Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 18.Yoon J.H. Qiu J. Cai S. Chen Y. Cheetham M.E. Shen B. Pfeifer G.P. The retinitis pigmentosa-mutated RP2 protein exhibits exonuclease activity and translocates to the nucleus in response to DNA damage.Exp. Cell Res. 2006; 312: 1323-1334Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The physiological functions of this domain remain unclear. To date, >70 pathogenic mutations in RP2 have been identified (Human Gene Mutation Database) (19.Stenson P.D. Mort M. Ball E.V. Shaw K. Phillips A. Cooper D.N. The Human Gene Mutation Database: building a comprehensive mutation repository for clinical and molecular genetics, diagnostic testing and personalized genomic medicine.Hum. Genet. 2014; 133: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (953) Google Scholar). More than ⅔ of these mutations are predicted to result in C-terminal truncated RP2 proteins or the complete loss of the RP2 gene. The most common truncation mutation, Arg120Ter, has been reported to cause loss of the entire RP2 protein, probably due to nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (20.Mears A.J. Gieser L. Yan D. Chen C. Fahrner S. Hiriyanna S. Fujita R. Jacobson S.G. Sieving P.A. Swaroop A. Protein-truncation mutations in the RP2 gene in a North American cohort of families with X-linked retinitis pigmentosa.Am. J.

In vitro analysis of aminoglycoside therapy for the Arg120stop nonsense mutation in RP2 patients.J. Med. Genet. 2002; 39: 62-67Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The remaining mutations in RP2 are missense or small in-frame deletions. With the exception of R118H and E138G, little is known about the effects of these mutations on the structure and function of RP2 protein. In the present study we obtained a novel rp2 mutant zebrafish line carrying a 12-bp in-frame deletion mutation (4-residue deletion at protein level) generated by the transcription activator-like effector nuclease (TALEN) technology. The retinal phenotype and molecular etiology of the novel rp2 mutant zebrafish was determined. Furthermore, we revealed that like the 12-bp deletion identified in zebrafish rp2, most of the missense and C-terminal truncation mutations identified in RP2 patients destabilized the RP2 protein and caused protein degradation through the proteasome pathway. We previously reported the generation of rp2 knock-out zebrafish by TALEN technology that resulted in a frameshift mutation (c.359_363del, named del5) causing null allele of rp2 (7.Liu F. Chen J. Yu S. Raghupathy R.K. Liu X. Qin Y. Li C. Huang M. Liao S. Wang J. Zou J. Shu X. Tang Z. Liu M. Knockout of RP2 decreases GRK1 and rod transducin subunits and leads to photoreceptor degeneration in zebrafish.Hum. Mol. Genet. 2015; 24: 4648-4659Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). In this study we identified a novel rp2 mutant zebrafish line carrying a 12-bp in-frame deletion (c.357_368del, named del12). The del12 mutation is predicted to cause deletion of four-conserved amino acid residues (Pro-120, Val-121, Lys-122, and Gly-123) located in the TBCC domain of Rp2 at the protein level. Homozygotes were screened out and confirmed by DNA sequencing (Fig. 1A). Like the rp2 knock-out zebrafish (7.Liu F. Chen J. Yu S. Raghupathy R.K. Liu X. Qin Y. Li C. Huang M. Liao S. Wang J. Zou J. Shu X. Tang Z. Liu M. Knockout of RP2 decreases GRK1 and rod transducin subunits and leads to photoreceptor degeneration in zebrafish.Hum. Mol. Genet. 2015; 24: 4648-4659Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), the del12 homozygous mutants did not show any apparent developmental defects and grew and bred normally. Intriguingly, using the anti-zebrafish Rp2 antibody described previously (7.Liu F. Chen J. Yu S. Raghupathy R.K. Liu X. Qin Y. Li C. Huang M. Liao S. Wang J. Zou J. Shu X. Tang Z. Liu M. Knockout of RP2 decreases GRK1 and rod transducin subunits and leads to photoreceptor degeneration in zebrafish.Hum. Mol. Genet. 2015; 24: 4648-4659Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), we found that the Rp2 protein levels were reduced to ∼10% in del12 homozygotes (Fig. 1B) and 60–80% in del12 heterozygotes (supplemental Fig. S1) in Western blot analysis. Furthermore, we examined the localization of Rp2 in WT and del12 mutant retinas at the age of 3 months under dark- and light-adapted conditions. In WT retinas, Rp2 was mainly associated with the plasma membrane of photoreceptor cells from the synapses to the outer segments. But in the del12 mutant retinas, Rp2 signals were much weaker (Fig. 1C and supplemental Fig. S2), which is in agreement with the Western blot results. To test if the loss of Rp2 protein was due to the reduction of rp2 mRNA, quantitative reverse transcription PCR (RT-qPCR) was performed using WT and mutant (del5 and del12) zebrafish eyes. Unlike the del5 mutant mRNA levels, which were decreased to ∼15% of WT group by nonsense-mediated decay, the del12 mutant mRNA levels were slightly reduced to >80% of WT group (Fig. 1D). Because the mild reduction of del12 mutant mRNA is unlikely to cause the near complete loss of Rp2 protein, we reasoned that there might be a post-translational mechanism degrading the mutant Rp2 protein. As the del12 mutants showed very low levels of Rp2 protein, we speculated that the normal function of Rp2 might be abolished or at least impaired. To validate this we first chose several proteins that had been studied in the rp2 knock-out zebrafish (7.Liu F. Chen J. Yu S. Raghupathy R.K. Liu X. Qin Y. Li C. Huang M. Liao S. Wang J. Zou J. Shu X. Tang Z. Liu M. Knockout of RP2 decreases GRK1 and rod transducin subunits and leads to photoreceptor degeneration in zebrafish.Hum. Mol. Genet. 2015; 24: 4648-4659Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) and detected their protein levels in WT and del12 mutant zebrafish by Western blot. The prenylated Pde6b and Grk1 and the myristoylated Gnat1, which participate in the phototransduction process of rod cells, are candidate trafficking substrates regulated by the RP2-ARL3 complex (22.Baehr W. Membrane protein transport in photoreceptors: the function of PDEδ: the Proctor lecture.Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2014; 55: 8653-8666Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). All of them were down-regulated in the del12 mutants at the ages of 1 month (Fig. 2A) and 2 months (Fig. 2B). The degrees of down-regulation of the three proteins in the del12 mutants were similar to those of the rp2 knock-out (del5) zebrafish. GNB1 and GNB3 are the β subunit of the rod and cone transducin complex, respectively. RP2 interacts with GNB1 but not GNB3 (14.Schwarz N. Novoselova T.V. Wait R. Hardcastle A.J. Cheetham M.E. The X-linked retinitis pigmentosa protein RP2 facilitates G protein traffic.Hum. Mol. Genet. 2012; 21: 863-873Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). In the del12 mutant zebrafish, the protein levels of Gnb1 were reduced, whereas Gnb3 levels were unchanged. Additionally, we checked the expression of two other Rp2-interacting proteins, Arl3 and Nsf (23.Holopainen J.M. Cheng C.L. Molday L.L. Johal G. Coleman J. Dyka F. Hii T. Ahn J. Molday R.S. Interaction and localization of the retinitis pigmentosa protein RP2 and NSF in retinal photoreceptor cells.Biochemistry. 2010; 49: 7439-7447Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Their protein levels were unaffected in both rp2 mutant zebrafish lines (Fig. 2, A and B and supplemental Fig. S1). To assess the retinal phenotype of the del12 mutant zebrafish, we used the peanut lectin (PNA) and the anti-rhodopsin (4D2) antibody to label the outer segments of cones and rods, respectively. At the age of 6 months, the outer segments of rods in del12 mutant zebrafish showed a reduction in length as compared with WT zebrafish, whereas the outer segments of cones were mildly affected (Fig. 2C). Furthermore, we performed transmission electron microscopy assays on the retinas of 7-month-old WT and del12 mutant zebrafish. The del12 mutant zebrafish also showed shortened outer segments of photoreceptors when compared with WT (Fig. 2D). These results suggest that the del12 mutant zebrafish exhibits similar molecular defects and retinal phenotypes observed previously in the rp2 knock-out zebrafish (7.Liu F. Chen J. Yu S. Raghupathy R.K. Liu X. Qin Y. Li C. Huang M. Liao S. Wang J. Zou J. Shu X. Tang Z. Liu M. Knockout of RP2 decreases GRK1 and rod transducin subunits and leads to photoreceptor degeneration in zebrafish.Hum. Mol. Genet. 2015; 24: 4648-4659Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The four residues affected by the del12 mutation are identical between human and zebrafish RP2 proteins. We constructed an equivalent del12 mutation by deleting the corresponding four residues (Pro-95, Val-96, Lys-97, and Gly-98) in human RP2 and then expressed the WT and del12 mutant RP2 protein with a C-terminal GFP or FLAG tag in ARPE-19 cells. Because the expression was controlled by the CMV promoter, without the 5′- and 3′-UTR of native RP2 mRNA, the interference of possible regulatory mechanisms acting on mRNA levels was excluded. We found that the protein levels of del12 mutant RP2 were reduced to ∼30% (GFP-tagged) and 15% (FLAG-tagged) of WT (Fig. 3, A and B). We also detected the expression levels of del12 mutant RP2 in two other human cell lines (H1299 and HepG2) and obtained similar results (supplemental Fig. S3). These results suggest that the biological process causing the decrease of the del12 mutant protein is similar in human and zebrafish and present in different cell types. As the Pro-95 residue was affected by the del12 mutation and a pathogenic mutation in the same codon (P95L) has been identified in RP patients (24.Sharon D. Bruns G.A. McGee T.L. Sandberg M.A. Berson E.L. Dryja T.P. X-linked retinitis pigmentosa: mutation spectrum of the RPGR and RP2 genes and correlation with visual function.Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2000; 41: 2712-2721PubMed Google Scholar), we then examined the expression level of P95L mutant RP2 in ARPE-19 cells. Similar to the del12 mutation, P95L reduced the protein levels of RP2 to ∼30% (Fig. 3, C and D) when compared with WT or the R118H mutation, which does not affect the protein levels (25.Schwahn U. Paland N. Techritz S. Lenzner S. Berger W. Mutations in the X-linked RP2 gene cause intracellular misrouting and loss of the protein.Hum. Mol. Genet. 2001; 10: 1177-1183Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Two other nearby pathogenic mutations, C86Y (24.Sharon D. Bruns G.A. McGee T.L. Sandberg M.A. Berson E.L. Dryja T.P. X-linked retinitis pigmentosa: mutation spectrum of the RPGR and RP2 genes and correlation with visual function.Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2000; 41: 2712-2721PubMed Google Scholar) and C108G (20.Mears A.J. Gieser L. Yan D. Chen C. Fahrner S. Hiriyanna S. Fujita R. Jacobson S.G. Sieving P.A. Swaroop A. Protein-truncation mutations in the RP2 gene in a North American cohort of families with X-linked retinitis pigmentosa.Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1999; 64: 897-900Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), also showed similar effects on the protein levels of RP2 in the expression experiments (Fig. 3, C and D). These results suggest that the del12 mutation and the nearby C68Y, P95L, and C108G missense mutations might cause retinal degenerations through a shared mechanism that dramatically decreases the protein levels of RP2. Crystal structure studies of RP2 revealed that the N-terminal domain of RP2 forms a parallel β-helix (residues 34–192) with a tightly packed and mainly hydrophobic core (11.Kühnel K. Veltel S. Schlichting I. Wittinghofer A. Crystal structure of the human retinitis pigmentosa 2 protein and its interaction with Arl3.Structure. 2006; 14: 367-378Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The Pro-95, Val-96, Lys-97, and Gly-98 affected by the del12 mutation make up part of the β-strand (residues 90–103) that participate in the β-sheet formation within this β-helix domain. Analysis of the intraprotein interactions (26.Tina K.G. Bhadra R. Srinivasan N. PIC: Protein Interactions Calculator.Nucleic Acids Res. 2007; 35: W473-W476Crossref PubMed Scopus (723) Google Scholar) of the four residues based on the human RP2 crystal structure reveals that these residues support critical β-helix stabilizing main-chain to main-chain hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interactions that are required for core structural stability of the protein (Fig. 3E). For example, Val-96 is involved in main-chain to main-chain H-bonds with the residue Ala-113 in another β-strand. Therefore, deletion of these four residues might compromise the folding of the parallel β-helix and in turn the overall protein conformation, which would likely cause rapid degradation of the mutant protein. To substantiate the prediction, we expressed and purified the WT, del12, P95L, and R118H forms of human RP2 protein with an N-terminal GST tag in Escherichia coli cells. Under the same conditions the WT and R118H forms of RP2 were mainly soluble and present in the supernatants of cell lysates, whereas the majority of del12 and P95L mutant RP2 formed inclusion bodies in the precipitates (supplemental Fig. S4). Differential scanning fluorometry (DSF) was used to determine the thermal stabilities of the purified RP2 proteins. The R118H group showed similar patterns of fluorescence to the WT group (Fig. 3F, blue and green lines). Meanwhile, the del12 and P95L groups exhibited high initial fluorescence signals at low temperatures (Fig. 3F, red and purple lines), suggesting the proteins were not well folded at all. These results indicate the del12 and P95L mutant RP2 proteins were unstable and more inclined to be unfolded and aggregated than WT RP2 protein. To date, >70 pathogenic mutations in RP2 have been reported in the literature, including 22 missense or small in-frame deletion mutations (19.Stenson P.D. Mort M. Ball E.V. Shaw K. Phillips A. Cooper D.N. The Human Gene Mutation Database: building a comprehensive mutation repository for clinical and molecular genetics, diagnostic testing and personalized genomic medicine.Hum. Genet. 2014; 133: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (953) Google Scholar). As the C86Y, P95L, and C108G mutations clearly decrease the protein levels of RP2, we next wanted to know if the remaining RP2 missense or small in-frame deletion mutations showed similar effects. A total of 19 RP2 additional mutations (see Fig. 4A) were constructed and heterogeneously expressed in ARPE-19 cells. Protein levels of WT and mutant RP2 were detected by Western blot. In summary, 12 mutations, G2V (3.Pelletier V. Jambou M. Delphin N. Zinovieva E. Stum M. Gigarel N. Dollfus H. Hamel C. Toutain A. Dufier J.L. Roche O. Munnich A. Bonnefont J.P. Kaplan J. Rozet J.M.

https://openalex.org/W2588712378,"A new analytical method based on solvent extraction, followed by continuous solid-phase extraction (SPE) clean-up using a polymeric sorbent, was demonstrated to be applicable for the detection of ivermectin in complex biological matrices of dung beetles (hemolymph, excreta or dry tissues) using liquid chromatography combined with positive electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry (LC/ESI+–MS/MS). Using a signal-to-noise ratio of 3:1, the limit of detection (LOD) in the insect matrices at trace levels was 0.01 ng g–1 and the limit of quantification (LOQ) was 0.1 ng g–1. The proposed method was successfully used to quantitatively determine the levels of ivermectin in the analysis of small samples in in vivo and post mortem samples, demonstrating the usefulness for quantitative analyses that are focused on future pharmacokinetic and bioavailability studies in insects and the establishment of a new protocol to study the impact of ivermectin on non-target arthropods such as dung beetles and other insects that are related with the “dung community”. Because satisfactory precision and accuracy values were obtained in both in vivo matrices, we suggest that the method can be consistently used for quantitative determinations that are focused on future pharmacokinetic and bioavailability studies in insects. Furthermore, this new analytical method was successfully applied to biological samples of dead dung beetles from the field suggesting that the method can be used to establish a new routine analysis of ivermectin residues in insect carcasses that is applied to complement typical mortality tests."
https://openalex.org/W2588381839,"Functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) was adopted to investigate the cortical neural correlates of visual fatigue during binocular depth perception for different disparities (from 0.1° to 1.5°). By using a slow event-related paradigm, the oxyhaemoglobin (HbO) responses to fused binocular stimuli presented by the random-dot stereogram (RDS) were recorded over the whole visual dorsal area. To extract from an HbO curve the characteristics that are correlated with subjective experiences of stereopsis and visual fatigue, we proposed a novel method to fit the time-course HbO curve with various response functions which could reflect various processes of binocular depth perception. Our results indicate that the parietal-occipital cortices are spatially correlated with binocular depth perception and that the process of depth perception includes two steps, associated with generating and sustaining stereovision. Visual fatigue is caused mainly by generating stereovision, while the amplitude of the haemodynamic response corresponding to sustaining stereovision is correlated with stereopsis. Combining statistical parameter analysis and the fitted time-course analysis, fNIRS could be a promising method to study visual fatigue and possibly other multi-process neural bases."
https://openalex.org/W2588495189,"Many classification methods have been proposed based on magnetic resonance images. Most methods rely on measures such as volume, the cerebral cortical thickness and grey matter density. These measures are susceptible to the performance of registration and limited in representation of anatomical structure. This paper proposes a two-stage local feature fusion method, in which deformable registration is not desired and anatomical information is represented from moderate scale.Keypoints are firstly extracted from scale-space to represent anatomical structure. Then, two kinds of local features are calculated around the keypoints, one for correspondence and the other for representation. Scores are assigned for keypoints to quantify their effect in classification. The sum of scores for all effective keypoints is used to determine which group the test subject belongs to.We apply this method to magnetic resonance images of Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease. The advantage of local feature in correspondence and representation contributes to the final classification. With the help of local feature (Scale Invariant Feature Transform, SIFT) in correspondence, the performance becomes better. Local feature (Histogram of Oriented Gradient, HOG) extracted from 16×16 cell block obtains better results compared with 4×4 and 8×8 cell block.This paper presents a method which combines the effect of SIFT descriptor in correspondence and the representation ability of HOG descriptor in anatomical structure. This method has the potential in distinguishing patients with brain disease from controls."

Bacterial invasion into deeper tissues is associated with colonization and immune evasion mechanisms. Thus, pneumococci express a versatile repertoire of surface proteins sequestering and interacting specifically with components of the human extracellular matrix and serum. Hic, a PspC-like pneumococcal surface protein, possesses vitronectin and factor H binding activity. Here, we show that heterologously expressed Hic domains interact, similar to the classical PspC molecule, with human matricellular thrombospondin-1 (hTSP-1). Binding studies with isolated human thrombospondin-1 and various Hic domains suggest that the interaction between hTSP-1 and Hic differs from binding to vitronectin and factor H. Binding of Hic to hTSP-1 is inhibited by heparin and chondroitin sulfate A, indicating binding to the N-terminal globular domain or type I repeats of hTSP-1. Competitive inhibition experiments with other pneumococcal hTSP-1 adhesins demonstrated that PspC and PspC-like Hic recognize similar domains, whereas PavB and Hic can bind simultaneously to hTSP-1. In conclusion, Hic binds specifically hTSP-1; however, truncation in the N-terminal part of Hic decreases the binding activity, suggesting that the full length of the α-helical regions of Hic is required for an optimal interaction.

https://openalex.org/W2588719186,"Previous studies have shown that flow cytometry is a reliable test to quantify platelet function in stored platelet concentrates (PC). It is thought that flow cytometry is laborious and hence expensive. We have optimized the flow cytometry-based quantification of agonist induced platelet activation (PACT) to a labor, time and more cost-efficient test. Currently the quality of PCs is only monitored by visual inspection, because available assays are unreliable or too laborious for use in a clinical transfusion laboratory. Therefore, the PACT was applied to monitor PC activation during storage.The optimized PACT was used to monitor 5 PCs during 10 days of storage. In brief, optimized PACT uses a ready-to-use reaction mix, which is stable at -20°C. When needed, a test strip is thawed and platelet activation is initiated by mixing PC with PACT. PACT was based on the following agonists: adenosine diphosphate (ADP), collagen-related peptide (CRP) and thrombin receptor-activating peptide (TRAP-6). Platelet activation was measured as P-selectin expression. Light transmission aggregometry (LTA) was performed as a reference.Both PACT and LTA showed platelet function decline during 10-day storage after stimulation with ADP and collagen/CRP; furthermore, PACT showed decreasing TRAP-induced activation. Major differences between the two tests are that PACT is able to measure the status of platelets in the absence of agonists, and it can differentiate between the number of activated platelets and the amount of activation, whereas LTA only measures aggregation in response to an agonist. Also, PACT is more time-efficient compared to LTA and allows high-throughput analysis.PACT is an optimized platelet function test that can be used to monitor the activation of PCs. PACT has the same accuracy as LTA with regard to monitoring PCs, but it is superior to both LTA and conventional flow cytometry based tests with regard to labor-, time- and cost efficiency."

https://openalex.org/W2588959824,"The present study tested the hypothesis that maternal smoke exposure results in fetal lung growth retardation due to dysregulation in various signaling pathways, including the Wnt (wingless-related integration site)/β-catenin pathway. Pregnant female C57BL/6J mice were exposed to cigarette smoke (100–150 mg/m3) or room air, and offspring were humanely killed on 12.5, 14.5, 16.5, and 18.5 d post coitum (dpc). We assessed lung stereology with Cavalieri estimation; apoptosis with proliferating cell nuclear antigen, TUNEL, and caspase assays; and gene expression with quantitative PCR (qPCR) and RNA sequencing on lung epithelium and mesenchyme retrieved by laser capture microdissection. Results demonstrated a significant decrease in body weight and lung volume of smoke-exposed embryos. At 16.5 dpc, the reduction in lung volume was due to loss of lung mesenchymal tissue correlating with a decrease in cell proliferation (n = 10; air: 61.65% vs. smoke: 44.21%, P < 0.05). RNA sequence analysis demonstrated an alteration in the Wnt pathway, and qPCR confirmed an increased expression of secreted frizzled-related protein 1 (sFRP-1) [n = 12; relative quantification (RQ) 1 vs. 2.33, P < 0.05] and down-regulation of Cyclin D1 (n = 7; RQ 1 vs. 0.61, P < 0.05) in mesenchymal tissue.

https://openalex.org/W2587885745,"Objective Accumulating data have recently underlined argon´s neuroprotective potential. However, to the best of our knowledge, no data are available on the cerebrovascular effects of argon (Ar) in humans. We hypothesized that argon inhalation does not affect mean blood flow velocity of the middle cerebral artery (Vmca), cerebral flow index (FI), zero flow pressure (ZFP), effective cerebral perfusion pressure (CPPe), resistance area product (RAP) and the arterio-jugular venous content differences of oxygen (AJVDO2), glucose (AJVDG), and lactate (AJVDL) in anesthetized patients. Materials and methods In a secondary analysis of an earlier controlled cross-over trial we compared parameters of the cerebral circulation under 15 minutes exposure to 70%Ar/30%O2 versus 70%N2/30%O2 in 29 male patients under fentanyl-midazolam anaesthesia before coronary surgery. Vmca was measured by transcranial Doppler sonography. ZFP and RAP were estimated by linear regression analysis of pressure-flow velocity relationships of the middle cerebral artery. CPPe was calculated as the difference between mean arterial pressure and ZFP. AJVDO2, AJVDG and AJVDL were calculated as the differences in contents between arterial and jugular-venous blood of oxygen, glucose, and lactate. Statistical analysis was done by t-tests and ANOVA. Results Mechanical ventilation with 70% Ar did not cause any significant changes in mean arterial pressure, Vmca, FI, ZFP, CPPe, RAP, AJVDO2, AJVDG, and AJVDL. Discussion Short-term inhalation of 70% Ar does not affect global cerebral circulation or metabolism in male humans under general anaesthesia."
https://openalex.org/W2587912542,"Prior studies indicated that CD8+ T cells responding to a surrogate single antigen expressed by Y. pseudotuberculosis, ovalbumin, were insufficient to protect against yersiniosis. Herein we tested the hypothesis that CD8+ T cells reactive to the natural Yersinia antigen YopE would be more effective at providing mucosal protection. We first confirmed that immunization with the attenuated ksgA- strain of Y. pseudotuberculosis generated YopE-specific CD8+ T cells. These T cells were protective against challenge with virulent Listeria monocytogenes expressing secreted YopE. Mice immunized with an attenuated L. monocytogenes YopE+ strain generated large numbers of functional YopE-specific CD8+ T cells, and initially controlled a systemic challenge with virulent Y. pseudotuberculosis, yet eventually succumbed to yersiniosis. Mice vaccinated with a YopE peptide and cholera toxin vaccine generated robust T cell responses, providing protection to 60% of the mice challenged mucosally but failed to show complete protection against systemic infection with virulent Y. pseudotuberculosis. These studies demonstrate that vaccination with recombinant YopE vaccines can generate YopE-specific CD8+ T cells, that can provide significant mucosal protection but these cells are insufficient to provide sterilizing immunity against systemic Y. pseudotuberculosis infection. Our studies have implications for Yersinia vaccine development studies."

https://openalex.org/W2587927725,"The metastasis suppressor KISS1 is reported to be involved in the progression of several solid neoplasias, making it a promising molecular target for controlling their metastasis. The KISS1 sequence contains an N-terminal secretion signal and several dibasic sequences that are proposed to be the proteolytic cleavage sites. We present the first structural characterization of KISS1 by circular dichroism, multi-angle light scattering, small angle X-Ray scattering and NMR spectroscopy. An analysis of the KISS1 backbone NMR chemical shifts does not reveal any preferential conformation and deviation from a random coil ensemble. The backbone 15N transverse relaxation times indicate a mildly reduced mobility for two regions that are rich in bulky residues. The small angle X-ray scattering curve of KISS1 is likewise consistent with a predominantly random coil ensemble, although an ensemble optimization analysis indicates some preference for more extended conformations possibly due to positive charge repulsion between the abundant basic residues. Our results support the hypothesis that KISS1 mostly samples a random coil conformational space, which is consistent with its high susceptibility to proteolysis and the generation of Kisspeptin fragments."
https://openalex.org/W2588289445,"Research on Brain Computer Interfaces (BCI) often aims to provide solutions for vulnerable populations, such as individuals with diseases, conditions or disabilities that keep them from using traditional interfaces. Such research thereby contributes to the public good. This contribution to the public good corresponds to a broader drive of research and funding policy that focuses on promoting beneficial societal impact. One way of achieving this is to engage with the public. In practical terms this can be done by integrating civil society organisations (CSOs) in research. The open question at the heart of this paper is whether and how such CSO integration can transform the research and contribute to the public good. To answer this question the paper describes five detailed qualitative case studies of research projects including CSOs. The paper finds that transformative impact of CSO integration is possible but by no means assured. It provides recommendations on how transformative impact can be promoted."

https://openalex.org/W2588768562,"We sought to determine if connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) is necessary for the formation of corneal haze after corneal injury. Mice with post-natal, tamoxifen-induced, knockout of CTGF were subjected to excimer laser phototherapeutic keratectomy (PTK) and the corneas were allowed to heal. The extent of scaring was observed in non-induced mice, heterozygotes, and full homozygous knockout mice and quantified by macrophotography. The eyes from these mice were collected after euthanization for re-genotyping to control for possible Cre-mosaicism. Primary corneal fibroblasts from CTGF knockout corneas were established in a gel plug assay. The plug was removed, simulating an injury, and the rate of hole closure and the capacity for these cells to form light reflecting cells in response to CTGF and platelet-derived growth factor B (PDGF-B) were tested and compared to wild-type cells. We found that independent of genotype, each group of mice was still capable of forming light reflecting haze in the cornea after laser ablation (p = 0.40). Results from the gel plug closure rate in primary cell cultures of knockout cells were not statistically different from serum starved wild-type cells, independent of treatment. Compared to the serum starved wild-type cells, stimulation with PDGF-BB significantly increased the KO cell culture's light reflection (p = 0.03). Most interestingly, both reflective cultures were positive for α-SMA, but the cellular morphology and levels of α-SMA were distinct and not in proportion to the light reflection seen. This new work demonstrates that corneas without CTGF can still form sub-epithelial haze, and that the light reflecting phenotype can be reproduced in culture. These data support the possibilities of growth factor redundancy and that multiple pro-haze pathways exist."

When exposed to food or cold temperatures, affected children nodded their heads uncontrollably. Over time the seizures often worsened, leaving the children severely disabled. Many died of malnutrition, accidents, or secondary infections. The outbreak triggered an intense hunt for the cause, but searches for viruses, bacteria, environmental toxins, genetic factors, and nutritional deficits all came up empty. One key clue: Areas with nodding disease also had high rates of infection with the parasite Onchocerca volvulus , best known for causing so-called river blindness.

University administrators worry that the declines, as much as 30% from 2016 levels in some programs, reflect heightened fears among foreign-born students that the United States is tightening its borders. Given the timing, the officials suspect the cause is President Donald Trump's anti-immigrant rhetoric during the campaign and his election, rather than the White House's 27 January travel ban against seven Muslim-majority countries, which is now in legal limbo. A continued downturn, officials say, could threaten U.S. global leadership in science and engineering by shrinking the pool of talent available to carry out academic research. It could also hinder innovation in industry, given that most foreign-born engineering students take jobs with U.S. companies after graduation."
