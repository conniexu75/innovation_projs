https://openalex.org/W2047807627,"The herbicide 2-chloro-4,6-bis(ethylamino)-s-triazine (simazine) is converted to 2-hydroxy-4,6-bis(ethylamino)-s-triazine (hydroxysimazine) in vivo by corn seedlings and in vitro by corn extracts. Hydroxysimazine is considered to be a detoxified form of the herbicide. In vitro conversion was produced by reacting simazine with either a cyclic hydroxamate (2,4-dihydroxy-3-keto-7-methoxy-1,4-benzoxazine) or its glucoside. The latter compounds may mediate at least some of the in vivo conversion in corn."

https://openalex.org/W2053791475,"The earliest pottery-producing culture on the coast of Ecuador, the Valdivia culture, shows many striking similarities in decoration and vessel shape to pottery of eastern Asia. In Japan, resemblances are closest to the Middle Jomon period. Both early Valdivia and Middle Jomon are dated between 2000 and 3000 B.C. A transpacific contact from Asia to Ecuador during this time is postulated."

https://openalex.org/W2031364769,"Two new Permian insect-bearing beds are reported. To date, these are geologically the oldest and youngest found in the Wellington formation of Kansas and Oklahoma. Altogether, six such beds are now known. When these beds are stratigraphically placed in relative elevation above the marine Herington limestone, they are found to recur at intervals of approximately 100 feet."

https://openalex.org/W2089240560,"Until a few years ago it was possible to account for nearly all the aspects of human color perception on the basis of the three-color theory, but such is no longer the case. This is largely due to improvements in the older methods of investigation and to the invention of new ones. Among the latter may be mentioned the microelectrode technique of Granit and the retinal direction effect of Stiles and Crawford. Modern requirements are met by a polychromatic theory, comprising 7 types of receptor, but there is no necessity for these to have such narrow spectral response curves as those exhibited by Granit's modulators. Modifications of the three- and four-color theories have been examined to see to what extent they can be made to fit in with experimental results. Particular notice has been taken of the possibility that there is polychromatism of the retinal receptors, but trichromatism of the nerve paths which connect these to the brain or even of the brain itself. The conclusion arrived at is that there must be polychromatism throughout the entire visual mechanism for color perception if a complete account is to be given of all the known facts."
