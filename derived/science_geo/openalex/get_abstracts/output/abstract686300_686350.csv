https://openalex.org/W4205536705,"Climate change is expected to impact a large number of organisms in many ecosystems, including several threatened mammals. A better understanding of climate impacts on species can make conservation efforts more effective. The Himalayan ibex (Capra ibex sibirica) and blue sheep (Pseudois nayaur) are economically important wild ungulates in northern Pakistan because they are sought-after hunting trophies. However, both species are threatened due to several human-induced factors, and these factors are expected to aggravate under changing climate in the High Himalayas. In this study, we investigated populations of ibex and blue sheep in the Pamir-Karakoram mountains in order to (i) update and validate their geographical distributions through empirical data; (ii) understand range shifts under climate change scenarios; and (iii) predict future habitats to aid long-term conservation planning. Presence records of target species were collected through camera trapping and sightings in the field. We constructed Maximum Entropy (MaxEnt) model on presence record and six key climatic variables to predict the current and future distributions of ibex and blue sheep. Two representative concentration pathways (4.5 and 8.5) and two-time projections (2050 and 2070) were used for future range predictions. Our results indicated that ca. 37% and 9% of the total study area (Gilgit-Baltistan) was suitable under current climatic conditions for Himalayan ibex and blue sheep, respectively. Annual mean precipitation was a key determinant of suitable habitat for both ungulate species. Under changing climate scenarios, both species will lose a significant part of their habitats, particularly in the Himalayan and Hindu Kush ranges. The Pamir-Karakoram ranges will serve as climate refugia for both species. This area shall remain focus of future conservation efforts to protect Pakistan's mountain ungulates."
https://openalex.org/W4207030134,"Populist attitudes are generally measured in surveys through three necessary and non-compensatory elements of populism, namely anti-elitism, people-centrism, and Manicheanism. Using Comparative Study of Electoral Systems Module 5 (2016–2020) data for 30 countries, we evaluate whether this approach explains voting for populist parties across countries in Asia, Europe and the Americas. We show that the existing scales of populist attitudes effectively explain voting for populists in countries where populist leaders and parties are in opposition but fail to explain voting for populist parties in countries where they are in power . We argue that current approaches assume “the elite” to mean “politicians”, thus failing to capture attitudes towards “non-political elites” often targeted by populists in office—in particular, journalists, academics/experts, bureaucrats, and corporate business leaders. The results reveal limits to the usefulness of existing survey batteries in cross-national studies of populism and emphasize the need to develop approaches that are more generalizable across political and national contexts."

Current estimates of the number of people living with neuromuscular disease (NMD) have largely been based on secondary care data sources and lacked direct denominators.To estimate trends in the recording of neuromuscular disease in UK primary care between 2000-2019.The Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD) database was searched electronically to estimate incidence and prevalence rates (per 100,000) for a range of NMDs in each year. To compare trends over time, rates were age standardised to the most recent CPRD population (2019).Approximately 13 million patients were actively registered in each year. By 2019, 28,230 active patients had ever received a NMD diagnosis (223.6), which was higher among males (239.0) than females (208.3). The most common classifications were Guillain-Barre syndrome (40.1), myasthenia gravis (33.7), muscular dystrophy (29.5), Charcot-Marie-Tooth (29.5) and inflammatory myopathies (25.0). Since 2000, overall prevalence grew by 63%, with the largest increases seen at older ages (≥65-years). However, overall incidence remained constant, though myasthenia gravis incidence has risen steadily since 2008, while new cases of muscular dystrophy fell over the same period.Lifetime recording of many NMDs on primary care records exceed current estimates of people living with these conditions; these are important data for health service and care planning. Temporal trends suggest this number is steadily increasing, and while this may partially be due to better recording, it cannot be simply explained by new cases, as incidence remained constant. The increase in prevalence among older ages suggests increases in life expectancy among those living with NMDs may have occurred."
https://openalex.org/W4206211335,"Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a prevalent neurodevelopmental condition characterized by diminished attentional control. Critically, these difficulties are related to negative consequences in real-life functioning both during development and into adulthood. There is now growing evidence that modulating the underlying neural circuits related to attention can improve behavior and brain function in children with ADHD. We have previously shown that game-based digital therapeutics targeting a key neural marker of attention-midline frontal theta (MFT)-yield positive effects on attentional control in several populations. However, the effects of such digital therapeutics in children with ADHD and no other comorbidities has not been yet examined. To address this gap, we assessed a sample of 25 children with ADHD (8-12 years old) on neural, behavioral, and clinical metrics of attention before and after a 4-week at-home intervention on an iPad targeting MFT circuitry. We found that children showed enhancements on a neural measure of attention (MFT power), as well as on objective behavioral measures of attention and parent reports of clinical ADHD symptoms. Importantly, we observed relationships between the neural and behavioral cognitive improvements, demonstrating that those children who showed the largest intervention-related neural gains were also those that improved the most on the behavioral tasks indexing attention. These findings provide support for using targeted, digital therapeutics to enhance multiple features of attentional control in children with ADHD.

https://openalex.org/W4226366416,"Cancer immunotherapies, such as checkpoint blockade of programmed cell death protein-1 (PD-1), represents a breakthrough in cancer treatment, resulting in unprecedented results in terms of overall and progression-free survival. Discovery and development of novel anti PD-1 inhibitors remains a field of intense investigation, where novel monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) and novel antibody formats (e.g., novel isotype, bispecific mAb and low-molecular-weight compounds) are major source of future therapeutic candidates. HLX10, a fully humanized IgG4 monoclonal antibody against PD-1 receptor, increased functional activities of human T-cells and showed in vitro, and anti-tumor activity in several tumor models. The combined inhibition of PD-1/PDL-1 and angiogenesis pathways using anti-VEGF antibody may enhance a sustained suppression of cancer-related angiogenesis and tumor elimination. To elucidate HLX10's mode of action, we solved the structure of HLX10 in complex with PD-1 receptor. Detailed epitope analysis showed that HLX10 has a unique mode of recognition compared to the clinically approved PD1 antibodies Pembrolizumab and Nivolumab. Notably, HLX10's epitope was closer to Pembrolizumab's epitope than Nivolumab's epitope. However, HLX10 and Pembrolizumab showed an opposite heavy chain (HC) and light chain (LC) usage, which recognizes several overlapping amino acid residues on PD-1. We compared HLX10 to Nivolumab and Pembrolizumab and it showed similar or better bioactivity in vitro and in vivo, providing a rationale for clinical evaluation in cancer immunotherapy."
https://openalex.org/W4205172674,"Diseases from food of animal origin are common health problems in Ethiopia. A cross-sectional study was carried out to estimate health and economic burden, and to identify demographic factors associated with community awareness of foodborne zoonotic diseases in Amhara region, Ethiopia. Data was collected from 435 households in three towns: Gondar, Lalibela and Debark. A retrospective data was also collected from health records in each town. The health burden due to zoonotic diseases was estimated at 0.2, 0.1 and 1.3 DALYs per household per year and at 73.2, 146.6 and 1,689.5 DALYs out of 100,000 populations per year in Gondar, Lalibela and Debark, respectively. The overall health burden due to foodborne zoonotic diseases (aggregated over the 435 households in the three towns) was estimated to be 89.9 DALYs per 100,000 populations per year. The economic impact of foodborne zoonotic diseases in the three towns of Amhara regional state was 278.98 Ethiopian Birr (ETB) (1ETB = 0.025 US Dollar) per household per year and 121,355.68 ETB per year. Costs of preventive measures followed by costs of patients' time made the highest contribution while costs of diagnosis made the lowest contribution to the total economic burden of foodborne zoonotic diseases. From a total of 435 respondents, 305 (70.1%) had known the presence of zoonotic diseases. Level of education, number of families in the house and income were highly associated with awareness of zoonosis. Although majority of respondents had known zoonotic diseases exists (70.1%) and disease can be acquired from animal source food (63.2%), the health and economic burden associated to foodborne zoonotic diseases are still high. Therefore, changing mindset and practical training aiming in controlling foodborne zoonotic diseases may be suggested to the community in the health improvement extension service."
https://openalex.org/W4206017121,"In this era, deep learning-based medical image analysis has become a reliable source in assisting medical practitioners for various retinal disease diagnosis like hypertension, diabetic retinopathy (DR), arteriosclerosis glaucoma, and macular edema etc. Among these retinal diseases, DR can lead to vision detachment in diabetic patients which cause swelling of these retinal blood vessels or even can create new vessels. This creation or the new vessels and swelling can be analyzed as biomarker for screening and analysis of DR. Deep learning-based semantic segmentation of these vessels can be an effective tool to detect changes in retinal vasculature for diagnostic purposes. This segmentation task becomes challenging because of the low-quality retinal images with different image acquisition conditions, and intensity variations. Existing retinal blood vessels segmentation methods require a large number of trainable parameters for training of their networks. This paper introduces a novel Dense Aggregation Vessel Segmentation Network (DAVS-Net), which can achieve high segmentation performance with only a few trainable parameters. For faster convergence, this network uses an encoder-decoder framework in which edge information is transferred from the first layers of the encoder to the last layer of the decoder. Performance of the proposed network is evaluated on publicly available retinal blood vessels datasets of DRIVE, CHASE_DB1, and STARE. Proposed method achieved state-of-the-art segmentation accuracy using a few number of trainable parameters."
https://openalex.org/W4207074814,"Qualitative health data are rarely shared in the United States (U.S.). This is unfortunate because gathering qualitative data is labor and time-intensive, and data sharing enables secondary research, training, and transparency. A new U.S. federal policy mandates data sharing by 2023, and is agnostic to data type. We surveyed U.S. qualitative researchers (N = 425) on the barriers and facilitators of sharing qualitative health or sensitive research data. Most researchers (96%) have never shared qualitative data in a repository. Primary concerns were lack of participant permission to share data, data sensitivity, and breaching trust. Researcher willingness to share would increase if participants agreed and if sharing increased the societal impact of their research. Key resources to increase willingness to share were funding, guidance, and de-identification assistance. Public health and biomedical researchers were most willing to share. Qualitative researchers need to prepare for this new reality as sharing qualitative data requires unique considerations."
https://openalex.org/W4225725885,"Characterization of protein complexes, i.e. sets of proteins assembling into a single larger physical entity, is important, as such assemblies play many essential roles in cells such as gene regulation. From networks of protein-protein interactions, potential protein complexes can be identified computationally through the application of community detection methods, which flag groups of entities interacting with each other in certain patterns. Most community detection algorithms tend to be unsupervised and assume that communities are dense network subgraphs, which is not always true, as protein complexes can exhibit diverse network topologies. The few existing supervised machine learning methods are serial and can potentially be improved in terms of accuracy and scalability by using better-suited machine learning models and parallel algorithms. Here, we present Super.Complex, a distributed, supervised AutoML-based pipeline for overlapping community detection in weighted networks. We also propose three new evaluation measures for the outstanding issue of comparing sets of learned and known communities satisfactorily. Super.Complex learns a community fitness function from known communities using an AutoML method and applies this fitness function to detect new communities. A heuristic local search algorithm finds maximally scoring communities, and a parallel implementation can be run on a computer cluster for scaling to large networks. On a yeast protein-interaction network, Super.Complex outperforms 6 other supervised and 4 unsupervised methods. Application of Super.Complex to a human protein-interaction network with ~8k nodes and ~60k edges yields 1,028 protein complexes, with 234 complexes linked to SARS-CoV-2, the COVID-19 virus, with 111 uncharacterized proteins present in 103 learned complexes. Super.Complex is generalizable with the ability to improve results by incorporating domain-specific features. Learned community characteristics can also be transferred from existing applications to detect communities in a new application with no known communities.

https://openalex.org/W4205580827,"Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) is a dose-limiting adverse reaction in cancer patients treated with several cytotoxic anticancer agents including paclitaxel. Duloxetine, an antidepressant known as a serotonin-noradrenalin reuptake inhibitor, is the only agent that has moderate evidence for the use to treat painful CIPN. The present retrospective cohort study aimed to analyze risk factors for paclitaxel-induced peripheral neuropathy (PIPN), and investigate ongoing prescription drug use for PIPN in Japan. Female breast and gynecologic cancer patients who underwent paclitaxel-based chemotherapy at a single center in Japan between January 2016 and December 2019 were enrolled in this study. Patients' information obtained from electronic medical records were statistically analyzed to test possible risk factors on PIPN diagnosis. Patients' age, total paclitaxel dose, the history of female hormone-related diseases, hypertension and body mass index (BMI), but not additional platinum agents, were significantly associated with increased PIPN diagnosis. Drugs prescribed for PIPN included duloxetine, pregabalin, mecobalamin and Goshajinkigan, a polyherbal medicine, regardless of poor evidence for their effectiveness against CIPN, and were greatly different between breast and gynecologic cancer patients diagnosed with PIPN at the departments of Surgery and Gynecology, respectively. Thus, older age, greater total paclitaxel dose, the history of estrogen-related diseases, hypertension and BMI are considered risk factors for PIPN in paclitaxel-based chemotherapy of female cancer patients. It appears an urgent need to establish a guideline of evidence-based pharmacotherapy for PIPN."
https://openalex.org/W4205803464,"Soil loss caused by erosion is a global problem. Therefore, the assessment of soil erosion and the its driving mechanism are of great significance to soil conservation. However, soil erosion is affected by both climate change and human activities, which have not been quantified, and few researchers studied the differences in the driving mechanisms of soil erosion depending on the land use type. Therefore, the spatiotemporal characteristics and changing trends of soil erosion in the Dongting Lake Basin were analyzed in this study. Geographic detectors were used to identify the dominant factors affecting soil erosion in different land use types. In this study, a sensitivity experiment was conducted to clarify the relative contributions of climate change and human activities to soil erosion changes. In addition, we studied the effects of different land use types and vegetation cover restoration on soil erosion. The results show that soil erosion in the Dongting Lake Basin decreased from 2000 to 2018. Human activities represented by land use types and vegetation coverage significantly contributed to the alleviation of soil erosion in the Dongting Lake Basin, whereas climate change represented by rainfall slightly aggravated soil erosion in the study area. The restoration of grassland vegetation and transfer of cultivated land to woodlands in the study area improved the soil erosion. The slope steepness is the key factor affecting the intensity of soil erosion in dry land, paddy fields, and unused land, whereas the vegetation coverage is the key factor affecting the intensity of soil erosion in woodland, garden land, and grassland. Detailed spatiotemporally mapping of soil erosion was used to determine the connections between soil erosion and potential drivers, which have important implications for vegetation restoration and the optimization of land use planning."
https://openalex.org/W4206636654,"Objective Identify risk factors for poor pain outcomes six months after primary knee replacement surgery. Methods Observational cohort study on patients receiving primary knee replacement from the UK Clinical Practice Research Datalink, Hospital Episode Statistics and Patient Reported Outcomes. A wide range of variables routinely collected in primary and secondary care were identified as potential predictors of worsening or only minor improvement in pain, based on the Oxford Knee Score pain subscale. Results are presented as relative risk ratios and adjusted risk differences (ARD) by fitting a generalized linear model with a binomial error structure and log link function. Results Information was available for 4,750 patients from 2009 to 2016, with a mean age of 69, of whom 56.1% were female. 10.4% of patients had poor pain outcomes. The strongest effects were seen for pre-operative factors: mild knee pain symptoms at the time of surgery (ARD 18.2% (95% Confidence Interval 13.6, 22.8), smoking 12.0% (95% CI:7.3, 16.6), living in the most deprived areas 5.6% (95% CI:2.3, 9.0) and obesity class II 6.3% (95% CI:3.0, 9.7). Important risk factors with more moderate effects included a history of previous knee arthroscopy surgery 4.6% (95% CI:2.5, 6.6), and use of opioids 3.4% (95% CI:1.4, 5.3) within three months after surgery. Those patients with worsening pain state change had more complications by 3 months (11.8% among those in a worse pain state vs. 2.7% with the same pain state). Conclusions We quantified the relative importance of individual risk factors including mild pre-operative pain, smoking, deprivation, obesity and opioid use in terms of the absolute proportions of patients achieving poor pain outcomes. These findings will support development of interventions to reduce the numbers of patients who have poor pain outcomes."
https://openalex.org/W4226421961,"Lipolysis and the release of fatty acids to supply energy fuel to other organs, such as between meals, during exercise, and starvation, are fundamental functions of the adipose tissue. The intracellular lipolytic pathway in adipocytes is activated by adrenaline and noradrenaline, and inhibited by insulin. Circulating fatty acids are elevated in type 2 diabetic individuals. The mechanisms behind this elevation are not fully known, and to increase the knowledge a link between the systemic circulation and intracellular lipolysis is key. However, data on lipolysis and knowledge from in vitro systems have not been linked to corresponding in vivo data and knowledge in vivo. Here, we use mathematical modelling to provide such a link. We examine mechanisms of insulin action by combining in vivo and in vitro data into an integrated mathematical model that can explain all data. Furthermore, the model can describe independent data not used for training the model. We show the usefulness of the model by simulating new and more challenging experimental setups in silico, e.g. the extracellular concentration of fatty acids during an insulin clamp, and the difference in such simulations between individuals with and without type 2 diabetes. Our work provides a new platform for model-based analysis of adipose tissue lipolysis, under both non-diabetic and type 2 diabetic conditions."
https://openalex.org/W4205170248,"Traffic speed is important to public health as it is a major contributory factor to collision risk and casualty severity. 20mph (32km/h) speed limit interventions are an increasingly common approach to address this transport and health challenge, but a more developed evidence base is needed to understand their effects. This study describes the changes in traffic speed and traffic volume in the City of Edinburgh, pre- and 12 months post-implementation of phased city-wide 20mph speed limits from 2016-2018.The City of Edinburgh Council collected speed and volume data across one full week (24 hours a day) pre- and post-20mph speed limits for 66 streets. The pre- and post-speed limit intervention data were compared using measures of central tendency, dispersion, and basic t-tests. The changes were assessed at different aggregations and evaluated for statistical significance (alpha = 0.05). A mixed effects model was used to model speed reduction, in the presence of key variables such as baseline traffic speed and time of day.City-wide, a statistically significant reduction in mean speed of 1.34mph (95% CI 0.95 to 1.72) was observed at 12 months post-implementation, representing a 5.7% reduction. Reductions in speed were observed throughout the day and across the week, and larger reductions in speed were observed on roads with higher initial speeds. Mean 7-day volume of traffic was found to be lower by 86 vehicles (95% CI: -112 to 286) representing a reduction of 2.4% across the city of Edinburgh (p = 0.39) but with the direction of effect uncertain.The implementation of the city-wide 20mph speed limit intervention was associated with meaningful reductions in traffic speeds but not volume. The reduction observed in road traffic speed may act as a mechanism to lessen the frequency and severity of collisions and casualties, increase road safety, and improve liveability."

We evaluated the clinical characteristics of patients with primary rhegmatogenous retinal detachment (RRD) during the state of emergency for COVID-19 pandemic in Japan. We also reviewed measures against the COVID-19 pandemic in our institute with a focus on RRD treatment. Retrospectively, patients who underwent initial RRD surgery during the state of emergency between April 7, 2020 and May 25, 2020 were included. For comparison, we recruited patients who underwent surgery for initial RRD during the same period in the last 2 years (2018 and 2019). Data related to the number of surgeries, age, gender, macular detachment, proliferative vitreoretinopathy (PVR), preoperative visual acuity, surgical techniques, the time between the onset and hospitalization and/or surgery of the 2020 cohort were analyzed and compared with those of the 2018 and 2019 cohorts. Furthermore, we reviewed measures taken against COVID-19 in our institute. The number of RRD patients during the state of emergency tended to be lower than that within the last 2 years. Relatively lesser female (vs. male) patients were observed in the 2020 cohort than in the last 2 years (P = 0.084). In contrast, among all cohorts, no significant differences were observed in the incidence of macula-off and PVR, preoperative visual acuity, and the time period between symptom onset and hospitalization and/or surgery. This is the first report to show the clinical patterns of RRD during COVID-19 pandemic in Japan. Despite the state of emergency for the COVID-19 pandemic, no delay in the patient's initial visit to the hospital and surgery was observed. Further studies, including multicenter researches, are important for investigating the influence of COVID-19 on urgent ocular diseases."
https://openalex.org/W4205667377,"Background Interventions to improve HIV service uptake are increasingly addressing inequitable and restrictive gender norms. Yet comparatively little is known about which gender norms are most salient for HIV testing and treatment and how changing these specific norms translates into HIV service uptake. To explore these questions, we implemented a qualitative study during a community mobilization trial targeting social barriers to HIV service uptake in South Africa. Methods We conducted 55 in-depth interviews in 2018, during the final months of a three-year intervention in rural Mpumalanga province. Participants included 25 intervention community members (48% women) and 30 intervention staff/community-opinion-leaders (70% women). Data were analyzed using an inductive-deductive approach. Results We identified three avenues for gender norms change which, when coupled with other strategies, were described to support HIV service uptake: (1) Challenging norms around male toughness/avoidance of help-seeking, combined with information on the health and preventive benefits of early antiretroviral therapy (ART), eased men’s fears of a positive diagnosis and facilitated HIV service uptake. (2) Challenging norms about men’s expected control over women, combined with communication and conflict resolution skill-building, encouraged couple support around HIV service uptake. (3) Challenging norms around women being solely responsible for the family’s health, combined with information about sero-discordance and why both members of the couple should be tested, encouraged men to test for HIV rather than relying on their partner’s results. Facility-level barriers such as long wait times continued to prevent some men from accessing care. Conclusions Despite continued facility-level barriers, we found that promoting critical reflection around several specific gender norms, coupled with information (e.g., benefits of ART) and skill-building (e.g., communication), were perceived to support men’s and women’s engagement in HIV services. There is a need to identify and tailor programming around specific gender norms that hinder HIV service uptake."
https://openalex.org/W4206261123,"Mangrove ecosystems, where litter and organic components are degraded and converted into detrital materials, support rich coastal fisheries resources. Sesarmid (Grapsidae) crabs, which feed on mangrove litter, play a crucial role in material flow in carbon-rich and nitrogen-limited mangrove ecosystems; however, the process of assimilation and conversion into detritus has not been well studied. In this study, we performed microbiome analyses of intestinal bacteria from three species of mangrove crab and five sediment positions in the mud lobster mounds, including the crab burrow wall, to study the interactive roles of crabs and sediment in metabolism. Metagenome analysis revealed species-dependent intestinal profiles, especially in Neosarmatium smithi , while the sediment microbiome was similar in all positions, albeit with some regional dependency. The microbiome profiles of crab intestines and sediments were significantly different in the MDS analysis based on OTU similarity; however, 579 OTUs (about 70% of reads in the crab intestinal microbiome) were identical between the intestinal and sediment bacteria. In the phenotype prediction, cellulose degradation was observed in the crab intestine. Cellulase activity was detected in both crab intestine and sediment. This could be mainly ascribed to Demequinaceae , which was predominantly found in the crab intestines and burrow walls. Nitrogen fixation was also enriched in both the crab intestines and sediments, and was supported by the nitrogenase assay. Similar to earlier reports, sulfur-related families were highly enriched in the sediment, presumably degrading organic compounds as terminal electron acceptors under anaerobic conditions. These results suggest that mangrove crabs and habitat sediment both contribute to carbon and nitrogen cycling in the mangrove ecosystem via these two key reactions."
https://openalex.org/W4205560961,"Allergic airway disease is the most common chronic airway inflammatory disorder in developed countries. House dust mite, cockroach, and mold are the leading allergens in most tropical and subtropical countries, including Taiwan. As allergen avoidance is difficult for patients allergic to these perennial indoor allergens, allergen-specific immunotherapy (ASIT) is the only available allergen-specific and disease-modifying treatment. However, for patients sensitized to multiple allergens, ASIT using each corresponding allergen is cumbersome. In the present study, we developed a recombinant L. lactis vaccine against the three most common indoor aeroallergens and investigated its effectiveness for preventing respiratory allergy and safety in mice. Three recombinant clones of Der p 2 (mite), Per a 2 (roach), and Cla c 14 (mold) were constructed individually in pNZ8149 vector and then electroporated into host strain L.lactis NZ3900. BALB/c mice were fed with the triple vaccine 5 times per week for 4 weeks prior to sensitization. The effectiveness and safety profile were then determined. Oral administration of the triple vaccine significantly alleviated allergen-induced airway hyper-responsiveness in the vaccinated mice. The allergen-specific IgG2a was upregulated. IL-4 and IL-13 mRNA expressions as well as inflammatory cell infiltration in the lungs decreased significantly in the vaccinated groups. No body weight loss or abnormal findings in the liver and kidneys were found in any of the groups of mice. This is the first report to describe a triple-aeroallergen vaccine using a food-grade lactococcal expression system. We developed a convenient oral delivery system and intend to extend this research to develop a vaccination that can be self-administered at home by patients."

The high-quality development of industry is the foundation of a sustainable and healthy growth of national economy, and is of great significance to improve people's living standards, and to meet people's needs for a better life.We develop an evaluation index system of high-quality development of industry from the perspectives of industrial benefit, innovation ability, coordination ability, green ability, opening ability and sharing ability. Based on a panel data of 30 provinces in China during 1999-2018, we evaluate the level of high-quality development of industry using the entropy-weight method and Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to an Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) method. Meanwhile we select six specific years and adopt the Natural Breaks method to classify the provinces according to their levels. At last, Moran's I index is used to analyze the spatial correlation among the provinces.Opening ability and innovation ability are found to have greater impacts on industrial high-quality development than other indices, and their influence has been increasing in recent years. There are large spatial and temporal differences among different provinces. Municipalities and coastal provinces are found to be at constantly high levels. The levels in the central region dropped first and then increased, however it was the opposite in the western region. In the northeast region, the levels fluctuated greatly. Overall, the high-quality development of industry among China's provinces shows positive spatial correlation. Most provinces in China are in High-High and Low-Low clustering States. The High-High clustering type is mainly distributed in the eastern region and the Low-Low clustering type is mainly distributed in the western and central regions.(1) Innovation ability and open ability are the most important factors. (2) Green ability has not sufficiently contributed to China's industrial development. (3) Regional and time evolution differences are significant. (4) There is a significant and stable spatial clustering effect in the high-quality development of industry among China's provinces."

We assess the impact of rice quality on rice prices, food security, and environmental sustainability in Bangladesh. We find that while price varies as expected for most quality attributes, it is unaffected by a broken percentage below 24.9 percent. This reveals a potential inefficiency, considering the average 5 percent broken rate observed in the market. An increase in the broken rate of milled rice within the limits supported by our findings can, ceteris paribus, increase rice rations by 4.66 million a year, or conversely, yield the current number of rice rations using 170.79 thousand fewer hectares and cutting emissions by 1.48 million metric tons of CO2 equivalent.

https://openalex.org/W4206137796,"Nanoparticles made of the coat protein of papaya mosaic virus (PapMV) and a single-strand RNA were previously shown to be an efficient antigen presentation system for the trigger of cellular immunity. Engineering of PapMV nano with a cytotoxic T lymphocyte epitope was previously shown activating specific T lymphocytes through a proteasome-independent major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC-I) cross-presentation. In this study, we provide new insights into the mechanism of the MHC-I cross-presentation mediated by PapMV nanoparticles. We demonstrate that PapMV nanoparticles do not require the transporter associated with antigen presentation (TAP), but rather depend on lysosome acidification and cathepsin S protease activity for presentation of the T cell epitope. We have also linked the induction of autophagy with this vacuolar MHC-I cross-presentation process. Interestingly, autophagy is induced in antigen-presenting cells after PapMV nanoparticles exposure and inhibition of autophagy reduce MHC-I cross-presentation. This study demonstrates that autophagy is associated with TAP- and proteasome-independent MHC-I cross-presentation. A deeper understanding of the autophagy-dependent MHC-I cross-presentation will be useful in designing vaccination platforms that aim to trigger an efficient cytotoxic T lymphocyte response."

The present study aimed to investigate the behavioral, health related and demographic risk factors associated with deaths due to floods. We measured the odds ratio and investigated the contribution and significance of the factors in relation to mortality. This case-control study was conducted in the cities affected by flood in Iran. Data were collected on the flood victims using a questionnaire. Survivors, a member of the flood victim’s family, were interviewed. In total, 77 subjects completed the survey in the case group, and 310 subjects completed the survey in the control group. The findings indicated that factors such as the age of less than 18 years, low literacy, being trapped in buildings/cars, and risky behaviors increased the risk of flood deaths. Regarding the behavioral factors, perceived/real swimming skills increased the risk of flood deaths although it may seem paradoxical. This increment is due to increased self confidence in time of flood. On the other hand, skills and abilities such as evacuation, requesting help, and escape decreased the risk of flood deaths. According to the results, the adoption of support strategies, protecting vulnerable groups, and improving the socioeconomic status of flood-prone areas could prevent and reduce the risk of flood deaths."

However, most of the existing credit scoring models either ignore this relationship or consider a simple connection information. This study assesses the applicants' relation in terms of their distance estimated based on their characteristics. This information is then utilized in a proposed spatial probit model to reflect the different degree of borrowers' relation on the default prediction of loan applicant. We apply this method to peer-to-peer Lending Club Loan data. Empirical results show that the consideration of information on the spatial autocorrelation among loan applicants can provide high predictive power for defaults."
https://openalex.org/W4205668490,"SARS-CoV-2 has clearly shown that efficient management of infectious diseases requires a top-down approach which must be complemented with a bottom-up response to be effective. Here we investigate a novel approach to surveillance for transboundary animal diseases using African Swine (ASF) fever as a model. We collected data both at a population level and at the local level on information-seeking behavior respectively through digital data and targeted questionnaire-based surveys to relevant stakeholders such as pig farmers and veterinary authorities. Our study shows how information-seeking behavior and resulting public attention during an epidemic, can be identified through novel data streams from digital platforms such as Wikipedia. Leveraging attention in a critical moment can be key to providing the correct information at the right moment, especially to an interested cohort of people. We also bring evidence on how field surveys aimed at local workers and veterinary authorities remain a crucial tool to assess more in-depth preparedness and awareness among front-line actors. We conclude that these two tools should be used in combination to maximize the outcome of surveillance and prevention activities for selected transboundary animal diseases such as ASF."

Lifestyle changes in a positive direction may reduce morbidity and mortality in patients with diabetes. The main objective of this study was to test the association between lifestyle changes based on online information seeking and discussing the information with a doctor.In this cross-sectional study we used e-mail survey data from 1250 members of The Norwegian Diabetes Association, collected in 2018. Included in the analyses were 847 men and women aged 18 to 89 years diagnosed with diabetes and who reported use of eHealth within the previous year. We used descriptive statistics to estimate lifestyle changes based on information from the internet. Logistic regressions were used to estimate the associations between lifestyle changes after online information seeking and discussing the information with a doctor. Analyses were adjusted for gender, age, education, and self-rated health.Lifestyle changes accomplished after online information seeking was reported by 46.9% (397/847) of the participants. The odds of changing lifestyle were more than doubled for those who had discussed information from the internet with a doctor (odds ratio 2.54, confidence interval 1.90-3.40). The odds of lifestyle changes were lower in the age groups 30-39 years and 60 years and over, compared to those aged 18-29 years (the reference group). Lifestyle changes were not associated with gender, education, or self-rated health.Our findings indicate that health-care professionals can play an important role in lifestyle changes additional to health-advice found on the internet. This study underlines the importance of easily accessible high-quality online information, as well as the importance of making room for discussing lifestyle in the clinical encounter."

However, modeling crown for individual tree is still challenging with the complex crown structure and changeable environmental conditions. This study was conducted to explore model in modeling the photosynthesis light response curve of the tree crown of young Larix principis-rupprechtii Mayr. Plantation. The rectangular hyperbolic model (RHM), non-rectangular hyperbolic model (NRHM), exponential model (EM) and modified rectangular hyperbolic model (MRHM) were used to model the photosynthetic light response curves. The fitting accuracy of these models was tested by comparing determinants coefficients (R2), mean square errors (MSE) and Akaike information criterion (AIC). The results showed that the mean value of R2 of MRHM (R2 = 0.9687) was the highest, whereas MSE value (MSE = 0.0748) and AIC value (AIC = -39.21) were the lowest. The order of fitting accuracy of the four models for Pn-PAR response curve was as follows: MRHM > EM > NRHM > RHM. In addition, the light saturation point (LSP) obtained by MRHM was slightly lower than the observed values, whereas the maximum net photosynthetic rates (Pmax) modeled by the four models were close to the measured values. Therefore, MRHM was superior to other three models in describing the photosynthetic response curve, the accurate values were that the quantum efficiency (α), maximum net photosynthetic rate (Pmax), light saturation point (LSP), light compensation point (LCP) and respiration rate (Rd) were 0.06, 6.06 μmol·m-2s-1, 802.68 μmol·m-2s-1, 10.76 μmol·m-2s-1 and 0.60 μmol·m-2s-1. Moreover, the photosynthetic response parameters values among different layers were also significant. Our findings have critical implications for parameter calibration of photosynthetic models and thus robust prediction of photosynthetic response in forests."
https://openalex.org/W4206799749,"Although children are overall sensitive to inequality and prefer fair allocation of resources, they also often display ingroup favouritism. Inquiring about the factors that can shape the tension between these two driving forces in children, we focused on the role of parents. Extending the limited literature in this field, the present work examined whether individual differences in 3-to 11-year-old White children's (N = 154, 78 boys) evaluations of fair versus pro-ingroup behaviours in an intergroup context vary as a function of both mothers' and fathers' social dominance orientation (SDO), right-wing authoritarianism (RWA), and moral foundations. Parents completed a questionnaire. Children were presented with a scenario in which two ingroup members distributed candies to two other children, one White and one Black, either in an egalitarian way or displaying a clear ingroup favouritism. Afterwards, their attitudes towards the two ingroup members who had distributed the candies were assessed through both an Implicit Association Test and explicit questions. Although children displayed on average an explicit preference for the fair over the pro-ingroup target, this preference did not emerge at the implicit level. Most importantly, both children's explicit and implicit attitudes were related to mothers' SDO, indicating that at increasing level of mothers' SDO children's inequality aversion tended to drop. Overall, these results emphasize the relevance of mothers' support for social hierarchy in relation to the way in which children balance the two competing drives of equality endorsement and pro-ingroup bias."

Mature biofilm of C. albicans was formed on denture base acrylic resin samples and the fungicidal effect of the extracts was evaluated by Alamar Blue® assay, counting colony-forming units (CFU/mL) and confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM). Cytotoxicity of extracts from Cryptocarya species was evaluated by AlamarBlue® assay, using normal oral keratinocytes (NOK) cells. In additional, Analysis of plant extracts by ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography-diode array detector-tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-DAD-MS) was performed. The results showed significant reduction in the cellular metabolism and in the number of CFU/mL of C. albicans (p<0.05). The concentration of 0.045 g/mL completely inhibited the number of CFU/mL. Regarding cytotoxicity, all extracts decreased cell viability compared to the control group. CLSM analysis showed predominance of live cells, but with a great difference between the groups. Antimicrobial activity of extracts from Cryptocarya on C. albicans biofilm was confirmed. However, all extracts showed toxicity on NOK cells."

We developed ""HEART"", a lay counselor-administered relationship assessment tool, for the CHARISMA pilot. The five-scale tool assesses participants' endorsement of Traditional Values (TV), her HIV Prevention Readiness (HPR) and levels of partner support (PS), abuse and control (PAC), and resistance to HIV prevention (PR), guiding decisions about which of three counselling modules to offer (partner communication/A; ring disclosure/B; and IPV prevention/C).We correlated baseline scores on HEART subscales with a) independent measures of relationship stability, disclosure and IPV to assess construct validity, and b) with specific modules offered to determine how HEART was used in the pilot. We examined changes in HEART scores at three and six months. Finally, we ran separate growth models for each subscale to examine changes in scores, accounting for partnership changes and counseling module(s) received.Baseline HEART scores correlated as predicted among subscales and with other measures. Reliabilities for four subscales were 0.75 or higher. Women who disclosed study participation and ring use scored higher on PS and lower on PR. Women experiencing IPV scored lower on PS, and higher on PAC and PR. During the pilot, 82% of women received one and 17% received two or more modules; over half received the IPV module. Women with higher PAC and PR scores were more likely to receive the IPV than the communication or disclosure modules. Over time, the TV, PAC and PR scores decreased, and PS score increased. Receiving the IPV module was associated with a decreased PAC score.These data offer preliminary evidence for HEART construct and predictive validity and support its further evaluation to guide implementation and monitor the impact of the CHARISMA intervention in a randomized controlled evaluation."
https://openalex.org/W4205587013,"Pruning residues can have a high quality as feedstock for energy purposes and are largely available in Europe. However, it is still an untapped resource. Such scarce use is due to the need to optimize their supply chain in term of collection machines and the associate cost of collection. A modular chipper (prototype PC50) for pruning harvest was developed. Such prototype is adaptable to various harvesting logistics and may produce a higher quality woodchip compared with the one produced by shredders available in the market. In this work, we tested the performance and quality of the product delivered by the prototype PC50 in various conditions and plant species, after a modulation of the machine settings (counter-rotating toothed rollers [CRR] speed), loading systems ([LS], either big bag or container), and knife types ([KT], either discontinuous hoe shaped knives or continuous helicoidal knives). To take into account of the covariates in the experiment (Cropping season and plant species), LSmeans were computed to have an unbiased estimate of the treatments means. The modulation of LS and KT scarcely affected the performance of the machine. In particular, the choice of the KT affected the field efficiency when the LS was a Tilting box but not a Big Bag. Whereas the continuous knife resulted in a 97% higher material capacity compared to hoe shape knives, the last of which the amount of short sized (<16 mm) fractions compared to helicoidal knives. No role of the CCR was found on the machine performance, but increasing CRR speed reduced the chip apparent bulk density and the fraction chips with a size <8 mm."
https://openalex.org/W4206011805,"Single-molecule force spectroscopy (SMFS) instruments (e.g., magnetic and optical tweezers) often use video tracking to measure the three-dimensional position of micron-scale beads under an applied force. The force in these experiments is calibrated by comparing the bead trajectory to a thermal motion-based model with the drag coefficient, γ, and trap spring constant, κ, as parameters. Estimating accurate parameters is complicated by systematic biases from spectral distortions, the camera exposure time, parasitic noise, and least-squares fitting methods. However, while robust calibration methods exist that correct for these biases, they are not always used because they can be complex to implement computationally. To address this barrier, we present Tweezepy: a Python package for calibrating forces in SMFS video-tracking experiments. Tweezepy uses maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) to estimate parameters and their uncertainties from a single bead trajectory via the power spectral density (PSD) and Allan variance (AV). It is well-documented, fast, easy to use, and accounts for most common sources of biases in SMFS video-tracking experiments. Here, we provide a comprehensive overview of Tweezepy's calibration scheme, including a review of the theory underlying thermal motion-based parameter estimates, a discussion of the PSD, AV, and MLE, and an explanation of their implementation."
https://openalex.org/W4206147126,"Many long-distance migratory birds use habitats that are scattered across continents and confront hazards throughout the annual cycle that may be population-limiting. Identifying where and when populations spend their time is fundamental to effective management. We tracked 34 adult whimbrels (Numenius phaeopus) from two breeding populations (Mackenzie Delta and Hudson Bay) with satellite transmitters to document the structure of their annual cycles. The two populations differed in their use of migratory pathways and their seasonal schedules. Mackenzie Delta whimbrels made long (22,800 km) loop migrations with different autumn and spring routes. Hudson Bay whimbrels made shorter (17,500 km) and more direct migrations along the same route during autumn and spring. The two populations overlap on the winter grounds and within one spring staging area. Mackenzie Delta whimbrels left the breeding ground, arrived on winter grounds, left winter grounds and arrived on spring staging areas earlier compared to whimbrels from Hudson Bay. For both populations, migration speed was significantly higher during spring compared to autumn migration. Faster migration was achieved by having fewer and shorter stopovers en route. We identified five migratory staging areas including four that were used during autumn and two that were used during spring. Whimbrels tracked for multiple years had high (98%) fidelity to staging areas. We documented dozens of locations where birds stopped for short periods along nearly all migration routes. The consistent use of very few staging areas suggests that these areas are integral to the annual cycle of both populations and have high conservation value."

Measures of simple proportion, population-based fatality rate, ""impact factor"" and crash severity are compared between disaggregated groups using Chi-Square analysis, with the Cramer's V statistic used to assess effect size.Key findings show a higher pedestrian risk in relation to public transport vehicles and area-level influences such as the nature of roads or extent of urbanity; higher passenger risk in relation to public transport vehicles and rurality; and higher risk for female road users in relation to public transport vehicles. The findings have implications for prioritising a range of deprivation-related structural effects. In addition, we present a ""User-System-Context"" conceptual framework that allows for a holistic approach to addressing vulnerability in the transport system. The findings provide an important avenue for addressing the persistently large burden of road traffic crashes and injuries in the country."

Spanish primary sources were consulted at the Red Cross Documentation Centre Archive in Madrid, the General Military Archive in Ávila, the Municipal Newspaper Archive in Madrid, and the archives of Spanish daily newspapers ABC and La Vanguardia. The following variables were analysed: duration, entry requirements, and theoretical content of the training courses. Consolidated Criteria for Reporting Qualitative Research (COREQ) has been used.Both sides in the conflict offered a varied training programme, which was supported by official institutions and private initiatives. The courses lasted between one week and two months. Entry requirements were influenced by education level, age, moral conduct, health status, and social and political background. Training content focused on the techniques needed in conflict settings and covered specific moral values.Despite the different social and political characteristics of the two warring factions, the variety of training programmes on offer, the entry requirements, and the theoretical content of volunteer nurse training were similar on both sides. At the end of the Spanish Civil War, volunteer nurses on the Republican side suffered reprisals or had to go into exile. We now know that some countries involved in World War II provided training courses for volunteer nurses. It would therefore be interesting to ascertain whether Spanish volunteer nurses contributed their experience to these courses."
https://openalex.org/W4205264104,"This study investigates the impact of a theatre-based vocal empowerment program on the vocal and language characteristics and the self-perceptions of young bilingual Egyptian women. The program used applied theatre, a dramatic practice that promotes civic action by utilizing improvisational techniques to engage participants in exploring solutions to self-identified community concerns. These techniques supported participants' pursuit of vocal empowerment: the ability to comfortably express their intended content with a clear audible voice, accompanied by the belief that what they had to say was worthwhile. The program was implemented in Alexandria and Aswan, two Egyptian cities in different regions of the country, with distinct socio-economic profiles. Thirty-six young women from Aswan and nineteen from Alexandria participated. The program was facilitated in Arabic, for 90 minutes per day over twelve consecutive days in 2018. Participants in both groups spoke Arabic as a home language and studied English in school settings but differed in their educational experiences and English proficiency. The vocal and language characteristics of each participant were tested in Arabic and English pre- and post- program using a spontaneous speech task and a reading aloud task. Their self-perceptions were evaluated through a vocal self-perception survey. Results indicated that participants responded differently in each city. In Alexandria, participants showed significant improvement in language skills (e.g., mean length of utterance). In contrast, participants in Aswan showed a significant change in fundamental frequency. Overall, the self-surveys indicated that all participants experienced an increased sense of confidence, a stronger belief in self-authorship, and an increased desire to voice their opinions clearly in public; however, there were subtle differences between the groups. In analyzing these results, we conclude that to design effective vocal empowerment outreach programs internationally, it is necessary to consider participants' cultural backgrounds, language diversity, and socio-economic status."

https://openalex.org/W4206275512,"Leukocyte (white blood cell, WBC) count is an essential factor that physicians use to diagnose infections and provide adequate treatment. Currently, WBC count is determined manually or semi-automatically, which often leads to miscounting. In this paper, we propose an automated method that uses a bioinspired segmentation mimicking the human perception of color. It is based on the claim that a person can locate WBCs in a blood smear image via the high chromatic contrast. First, by applying principal component analysis over RGB, HSV, and L*a*b* spaces, with specific combinations, pixels of leukocytes present high chromatic variance; this results in increased contrast with the average hue of the other blood smear elements. Second, chromaticity is processed as a feature, without separating hue components; this is different to most of the current automation that perform mathematical operations between hue components in an intuitive way. As a result of this systematic method, WBC recognition is computationally efficient, overlapping WBCs are separated, and the final count is more precise. In experiments with the ALL-IDB benchmark, the performance of the proposed segmentation was assessed by comparing the WBC from the processed images with the ground truth. Compared with previous methods, the proposed method achieved similar results in sensitivity and precision and approximately 0.2% higher specificity and 0.3% higher accuracy for pixel classification in the segmentation stage; as well, the counting results are similar to previous works."

https://openalex.org/W4206668534,"Diagnostic tests for hearing impairment not only determines the presence (or absence) of hearing loss, but also evaluates its degree and type, and provides physicians with essential data for future treatment and rehabilitation. Therefore, accurately measuring hearing loss conditions is very important for proper patient understanding and treatment. In current-day practice, to quantify the level of hearing loss, physicians exploit specialized test scores such as the pure-tone audiometry (PTA) thresholds and speech discrimination scores (SDS) as quantitative metrics in examining a patient’s auditory function. However, given that these metrics can be easily affected by various human factors, which includes intentional (or accidental) patient intervention, there are needs to cross validate the accuracy of each metric. By understanding a “normal” relationship between the SDS and PTA, physicians can reveal the need for re-testing, additional testing in different dimensions, and also potential malingering cases. For this purpose, in this work, we propose a prediction model for estimating the SDS of a patient by using PTA thresholds via a Random Forest-based machine learning approach to overcome the limitations of the conventional statistical (or even manual) methods. For designing and evaluating the Random Forest-based prediction model, we collected a large-scale dataset from 12,697 subjects, and report a SDS level prediction accuracy of 95.05% and 96.64% for the left and right ears, respectively. We also present comparisons with other widely-used machine learning algorithms (e.g., Support Vector Machine, Multi-layer Perceptron) to show the effectiveness of our proposed Random Forest-based approach. Results obtained from this study provides implications and potential feasibility in providing a practically-applicable screening tool for identifying patient-intended malingering in hearing loss-related tests."

Case positive data from the counties surrounding each plant showed peak positive SARS-CoV-2 cases from 12-55 days before the virus was detected in the plant, indicating that environmental sampling is likely a lagging indicator of community and plant infection."
https://openalex.org/W4207001143,"Affective touch refers to the emotional and motivational facets of tactile sensation and has been linked to the activation of a specialised system of mechanosensory afferents (the CT system), that respond optimally to slow caress-like touch. Affective touch has been shown to play an important role in the building of the bodily self: the multisensory integrated global awareness of one's own body. Here we investigated the effects of affective touch on subsequent tactile awareness and multisensory integration using the Somatic Signal Detection Task (SSDT). During the SSDT, participants were required to detect near-threshold tactile stimulation on their cheek, in the presence/absence of a concomitant light. Participants repeated the SSDT twice, before and after receiving a touch manipulation. Participants were divided into two groups: one received affective touch (CT optimal; n = 32), and the second received non-affective touch (non-CT optimal; n = 34). Levels of arousal (skin conductance levels, SCLs) and mood changes after the touch manipulation were also measured. Affective touch led to an increase in tactile accuracy, as indicated by less false reports of touch and a trend towards higher tactile sensitivity during the subsequent SSDT. Conversely, non-affective touch was found to induce a partial decrease in the correct detection of touch possibly due to a desensitization of skin mechanoreceptors. Both affective and non-affective touch induced a more positive mood and higher SCLs in participants. The increase in SCLs was greater after affective touch. We conclude that receiving affective touch enhances the sense of bodily self therefore increasing perceptual accuracy and awareness. Higher SCLs are suggested to be a possible mediator linking affective touch to a greater tactile accuracy. Clinical implications are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W4205524791,"Contrast sensitivity is reduced in older adults and is often measured at an overall perceptual level. Recent human psychophysical studies have provided paradigms to measure contrast sensitivity independently in the magnocellular (MC) and parvocellular (PC) visual pathways and have reported desensitization in the MC pathway after flicker adaptation. The current study investigates the influence of aging on contrast sensitivity and on the desensitization effect in the two visual pathways. The steady- and pulsed-pedestal paradigms were used to measure contrast sensitivity under two adaptation conditions in 45 observers. In the non-flicker adaptation condition, observers adapted to a pedestal array of four 1°×1° squares presented with a steady luminance; in the flicker adaptation condition, observers adapted to a square-wave modulated luminance flicker of 7.5 Hz and 50% contrast. Results showed significant age-related contrast sensitivity reductions in the MC and PC pathways, with a significantly larger decrease of contrast sensitivity for individuals older than 50 years of age in the MC pathway but not in the PC pathway. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that sensitivity reduction observed at the overall perceptual level likely comes from both the MC and PC visual pathways, with a more dramatic reduction resulting from the MC pathway for adults &gt;50 years of age. In addition, a similar desensitization effect from flicker adaptation was observed in the MC pathway for all ages, which suggests that aging may not affect the process of visual adaptation to rapid luminance flicker."

High contact surfaces within space vehicles provide an opportunity for bacterial adhesion, which can lead to biofilm formation or disease transmission. This study evaluates the performance of several nonfouling polymers using citizen science, to identify the best performing chemistry for future applications as bacteria resistant coatings. The specific polymer chemistries tested were zwitterionic sulfobetaine methacrylate (SBMA), and polyampholytes composed of [2-(acryloyloxy)ethyl] trimethylammonium chloride and 2-carboxyethyl acrylate (TMA/CAA), or TMA and 3-sulfopropyl methacrylate (TMA/SA). Each polymer chemistry is known to exhibit bacteria resistance, and this study provides a direct side-by-side comparison between the chemistries using a citizen science approach. Nearly 100 citizen scientists returned results comparing the performance of these polymers over repeat exposure to bacteria and 30 total days of growth. The results demonstrate that TMA/CAA polyampholyte hydrogels show the best long-term resistance to bacteria adhesion."
https://openalex.org/W4206606128,"The unusual blue color polymorphism of lingcod ( Ophiodon elongatus ) is the subject of much speculation but little empirical research; ~20% of lingcod individuals exhibit this striking blue color morph, which is discrete from and found within the same populations as the more common brown morph. In other species, color polymorphisms are intimately linked with host–parasite interactions, which led us to ask whether blue coloration in lingcod might be associated with parasitism, either as cause or effect. To test how color and parasitism are related in this host species, we performed parasitological dissection of 89 lingcod individuals collected across more than 26 degrees of latitude from Alaska, Washington, and California, USA. We found that male lingcod carried 1.89 times more parasites if they were blue than if they were brown, whereas there was no difference in parasite burden between blue and brown female lingcod. Blue individuals of both sexes had lower hepatosomatic index (i.e., relative liver weight) values than did brown individuals, indicating that blueness is associated with poor body condition. The immune systems of male vertebrates are typically less effective than those of females, due to the immunocompromising properties of male sex hormones; this might explain why blueness is associated with elevated parasite burdens in males but not in females. What remains to be determined is whether parasites induce physiological damage that produces blueness or if both blue coloration and parasite burden are driven by some unmeasured variable, such as starvation. Although our study cannot discriminate between these possibilities, our data suggest that the immune system could be involved in the blue color polymorphism–an exciting jumping-off point for future research to definitively identify the cause of lingcod blueness and a hint that immunocompetence and parasitism may play a role in lingcod population dynamics."
https://openalex.org/W4206910273,"This paper provides the details of a study on the effects of electron radiation on the Performance of Inters-satellite Optical Wireless Communication (IsOWC). Academia and industry focus on solutions that can improve performance and reduce the cost of IsWOC systems. Spacecraft, space stations, satellites, and astronauts are exposed to an increased level of radiation when in space, so it is essential to evaluate the risks and performance effects associated with extended radiation exposures in missions and space travel in general. This investigation focuses on LEO, especially in the near-equatorial radiation environment. Radiation experiments supported with simulations have made it possible to obtain and evaluate the electron radiation impact on optoelectronics at the device level and system level performances. The electron radiation has induced a system degradation of 70%. This result demonstrates the importance of such an investigation to predict and take necessary and suitable reliable quality service for future space missions."

All patients with diabetes who were 18 years and above and who were on follow up and registered were included in the study and those with Gestational DM were excluded.Multivariable logistic regression analysis.Responsive respondents scored high in self-care practice score as compared to other respondents. educational status, information sources, knowledge, and preferred message appeals were independent predictors of controlling the danger of diabetes.There is a significant gap in controlling the danger of diabetes. Variables like the level of education, knowledge of diabetes mellitus, information sources, and message appeals were independent predictors of controlling the danger of diabetes. Designing message having higher efficacy while maintaining the level of threat is the best that fits the existing audience's message processing to bring about desired diabetic self-care Practice."
https://openalex.org/W4207034277,"Non-adherence to Tuberculosis (TB) medication is a serious threat to TB prevention and control programs, especially in resource-limited settings. The growth of the popularity of mobile phones provides opportunities to address non-adherence, by facilitating direct communication more frequently between healthcare providers and patients through SMS texts and voice phone calls. However, the existing evidence is inconsistent about the effect of SMS interventions on TB treatment adherence. Such interventions are also seldom developed based on appropriate theoretical foundations. Therefore, there is a reason to approach this problem more rigorously, by developing the intervention systematically with evidence-based theory and conducting the trial with strong measurement methods.This study is a single-blind parallel-group design individual randomized control trial. A total of 186 participants (93 per group) will be individually randomized into one of the two groups with a 1:1 allocation ratio by a computer-generated algorithm. Group one (intervention) participants will receive daily SMS texts and weekly phone calls concerning their daily medication intake and medication refill clinic visit reminder and group two (control) participants will receive the same routine standard treatment care as the intervention group, but no SMS text and phone calls. All participants will be followed for two months of home-based self-administered medication during the continuation phases of the standard treatment period. Urine test for the presence of isoniazid (INH) drug metabolites in urine will be undertaken at the random point at the fourth and eighth weeks of intervention to measure medication adherence. Medication adherence will also be assessed by self-report measurements using the AIDS Clinical Trial Group adherence (ACTG) and Visual Analogue Scales (VAS) questionnaires, and clinic appointment attendance registration. Multivariable regression model analysis will be employed to assess the effect of the Ma-MAS intervention at a significance level of P-value < 0.05 with a 95% confidence interval.For this trial, a mobile-assisted medication adherence intervention will first be developed systematically based on the Medical Research Council framework using appropriate behavioural theory and evidence. The trial will then evaluate the effect of SMS texts and phone calls on TB medication adherence. Evidence generated from this trial will be highly valuable for policymakers, program managers, and healthcare providers working in Ethiopia and beyond.The trial is registered in the Pan-Africa Clinical Trials Registry with trial number PACTR202002831201865."
https://openalex.org/W4207063575,"Obesity promotes type 2 diabetes and cardiometabolic pathologies. Vertical sleeve gastrectomy (VSG) is used to treat obesity resulting in long-term weight loss and health improvements that precede weight loss; however, the mechanisms underlying the immediate benefits remain incompletely understood. Because adipose plays a crucial role in energy homeostasis and utilization, we hypothesized that VSG exerts its influences, in part, by modulating adipose functional states. We applied single-cell ATAC sequencing and lipid profiling to inguinal and epididymal adipose depots from mice that received sham surgery or VSG. We observed depot-specific cellular composition and chromatin accessibility patterns that were altered by VSG. Specifically, accessibility at Scd1, a fatty acid desaturase, was substantially reduced after VSG in mature adipocytes of inguinal but not epididymal depots. This was accompanied by reduced accumulation of SCD1-produced unsaturated fatty acids. Given these findings and reports that reductions in Scd1 attenuate obesity and insulin resistance our results suggest VSG exerts its beneficial effects through an inguinal depot-specific reduction of SCD1 activity."
