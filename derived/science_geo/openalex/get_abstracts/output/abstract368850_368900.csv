https://openalex.org/W2108365736,"Over the last two winters, there have been large-scale, unexplained losses of managed honey bee (Apis mellifera L.) colonies in the United States. In the absence of a known cause, this syndrome was named Colony Collapse Disorder (CCD) because the main trait was a rapid loss of adult worker bees. We initiated a descriptive epizootiological study in order to better characterize CCD and compare risk factor exposure between populations afflicted by and not afflicted by CCD.Of 61 quantified variables (including adult bee physiology, pathogen loads, and pesticide levels), no single measure emerged as a most-likely cause of CCD. Bees in CCD colonies had higher pathogen loads and were co-infected with a greater number of pathogens than control populations, suggesting either an increased exposure to pathogens or a reduced resistance of bees toward pathogens. Levels of the synthetic acaricide coumaphos (used by beekeepers to control the parasitic mite Varroa destructor) were higher in control colonies than CCD-affected colonies.This is the first comprehensive survey of CCD-affected bee populations that suggests CCD involves an interaction between pathogens and other stress factors. We present evidence that this condition is contagious or the result of exposure to a common risk factor. Potentially important areas for future hypothesis-driven research, including the possible legacy effect of mite parasitism and the role of honey bee resistance to pesticides, are highlighted."

https://openalex.org/W2068701052,"Polymerization of actin filaments directed by the actin-related protein (Arp)2/3 complex supports many types of cellular movements. However, questions remain regarding the relative contributions of Arp2/3 complex versus other mechanisms of actin filament nucleation to processes such as path finding by neuronal growth cones; this is because of the lack of simple methods to inhibit Arp2/3 complex reversibly in living cells. Here we describe two classes of small molecules that bind to different sites on the Arp2/3 complex and inhibit its ability to nucleate actin filaments. CK-0944636 binds between Arp2 and Arp3, where it appears to block movement of Arp2 and Arp3 into their active conformation. CK-0993548 inserts into the hydrophobic core of Arp3 and alters its conformation. Both classes of compounds inhibit formation of actin filament comet tails by Listeria and podosomes by monocytes. Two inhibitors with different mechanisms of action provide a powerful approach for studying the Arp2/3 complex in living cells."

Laurence Corey and colleagues provide a potential mechanism underlying this observation, showing that even after acyclovir treatment for the HSV-2 infection, many inflammatory and immune cells possessing the receptors required for HIV infection persist in the mucosa, making the initial 'spark' of infection more likely. To explore the mechanism by which herpes simplex virus (HSV)-2 infection is related to HIV-1 acquisition, we conducted in situ analysis of the cellular infiltrate from sequential biopsies of HSV-2 lesions from patients on and off antiviral therapy. CD4+ and CD8+ T cells and a mixed population of plasmacytoid and myeloid dendritic cells (DCs), including cells expressing the C-type lectin receptor DC-SIGN, persisted at sites of HSV-2 reactivation for months after healing, even with daily antiviral therapy. The CD4+ T cells that persisted reacted to HSV-2 antigen, were enriched for expression of the chemokine receptor CCR5, and were contiguous to DCs expressing the interleukin-3 receptor CD123 or DC-SIGN. Ex vivo infection with a CCR5-tropic strain of HIV-1 revealed greater concentrations of integrated HIV-1 DNA in cells derived from healed genital lesion biopsies than in cells from control skin biopsies. The persistence and enrichment of HIV receptor–positive inflammatory cells in the genitalia help explain the inability of anti–HSV-2 therapy to reduce HIV acquisition."

https://openalex.org/W2098876955,"A major obstacle to understanding the functional importance of dimerization between class A G protein–coupled receptors (GPCRs) has been the methodological limitation in achieving control of the identity of the components comprising the signaling unit. We have developed a functional complementation assay that enables such control, and we demonstrate it here for the human dopamine D2 receptor. The minimal signaling unit, two receptors and a single G protein, is maximally activated by agonist binding to a single protomer, which suggests an asymmetrical activated dimer. Inverse agonist binding to the second protomer enhances signaling, whereas agonist binding to the second protomer blunts signaling. Ligand-independent constitutive activation of the second protomer also inhibits signaling. Thus, GPCR dimer function can be modulated by the activity state of the second protomer, which for a heterodimer may be altered in pathological states. Our new methodology also makes possible the characterization of signaling from a defined heterodimer unit."
https://openalex.org/W2137186819,"Epithelial ovarian cancer has a major heritable component, but the known susceptibility genes explain less than half the excess familial risk. We performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) to identify common ovarian cancer susceptibility alleles. We evaluated 507,094 SNPs genotyped in 1,817 cases and 2,353 controls from the UK and approximately 2 million imputed SNPs. We genotyped the 22,790 top ranked SNPs in 4,274 cases and 4,809 controls of European ancestry from Europe, USA and Australia. We identified 12 SNPs at 9p22 associated with disease risk (P < 10(-8)). The most significant SNP (rs3814113; P = 2.5 x 10(-17)) was genotyped in a further 2,670 ovarian cancer cases and 4,668 controls, confirming its association (combined data odds ratio (OR) = 0.82, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.79-0.86, P(trend) = 5.1 x 10(-19)). The association differs by histological subtype, being strongest for serous ovarian cancers (OR 0.77, 95% CI 0.73-0.81, P(trend) = 4.1 x 10(-21))."

https://openalex.org/W1989418404,"The authors report a successfully targeted reinnervation of hindlimb sensory fibers projection into the CNS following spinal cord injury in rats. Cervical level 1 lesions followed by expression of the neurotrophin NT-3 in the appropriate brainstem target led to proper targeting of regenerating axons. A principal objective of spinal cord injury (SCI) research is the restoration of axonal connectivity to denervated targets. We tested the hypothesis that chemotropic mechanisms would guide regenerating spinal cord axons to appropriate brainstem targets. We subjected rats to cervical level 1 (C1) lesions and combinatorial treatments to elicit axonal bridging into and beyond lesion sites. Lentiviral vectors expressing neurotrophin-3 (NT-3) were then injected into an appropriate brainstem target, the nucleus gracilis, and an inappropriate target, the reticular formation. NT-3 expression in the correct target led to reinnervation of the nucleus gracilis in a dose-related fashion, whereas NT-3 expression in the reticular formation led to mistargeting of regenerating axons. Axons regenerating into the nucleus gracilis formed axodendritic synapses containing rounded vesicles, reflective of pre-injury synaptic architecture. Thus, we report for the first time, to the best of our knowledge, the reinnervation of brainstem targets after SCI and an essential role for chemotropic axon guidance in target selection."

https://openalex.org/W2088217887,"Coffee is predicted to be severely affected by climate change. We determined the thermal tolerance of the coffee berry borer, Hypothenemus hampei, the most devastating pest of coffee worldwide, and make inferences on the possible effects of climate change using climatic data from Colombia, Kenya, Tanzania, and Ethiopia. For this, the effect of eight temperature regimes (15, 20, 23, 25, 27, 30, 33 and 35 degrees C) on the bionomics of H. hampei was studied. Successful egg to adult development occurred between 20-30 degrees C. Using linear regression and a modified Logan model, the lower and upper thresholds for development were estimated at 14.9 and 32 degrees C, respectively. In Kenya and Colombia, the number of pest generations per year was considerably and positively correlated with the warming tolerance. Analysing 32 years of climatic data from Jimma (Ethiopia) revealed that before 1984 it was too cold for H. hampei to complete even one generation per year, but thereafter, because of rising temperatures in the area, 1-2 generations per year/coffee season could be completed. Calculated data on warming tolerance and thermal safety margins of H. hampei for the three East African locations showed considerably high variability compared to the Colombian site. The model indicates that for every 1 degrees C rise in thermal optimum (T(opt.)), the maximum intrinsic rate of increase (r(max)) will increase by an average of 8.5%. The effects of climate change on the further range of H. hampei distribution and possible adaption strategies are discussed.

https://openalex.org/W2112476814,"Background Generalised spike wave (GSW) discharges are the electroencephalographic (EEG) hallmark of absence seizures, clinically characterised by a transitory interruption of ongoing activities and impaired consciousness, occurring during states of reduced awareness. Several theories have been proposed to explain the pathophysiology of GSW discharges and the role of thalamus and cortex as generators. In this work we extend the existing theories by hypothesizing a role for the precuneus, a brain region neglected in previous works on GSW generation but already known to be linked to consciousness and awareness. We analysed fMRI data using dynamic causal modelling (DCM) to investigate the effective connectivity between precuneus, thalamus and prefrontal cortex in patients with GSW discharges. Methodology and Principal Findings We analysed fMRI data from seven patients affected by Idiopathic Generalized Epilepsy (IGE) with frequent GSW discharges and significant GSW-correlated haemodynamic signal changes in the thalamus, the prefrontal cortex and the precuneus. Using DCM we assessed their effective connectivity, i.e. which region drives another region. Three dynamic causal models were constructed: GSW was modelled as autonomous input to the thalamus (model A), ventromedial prefrontal cortex (model B), and precuneus (model C). Bayesian model comparison revealed Model C (GSW as autonomous input to precuneus), to be the best in 5 patients while model A prevailed in two cases. At the group level model C dominated and at the population-level the p value of model C was ∼1. Conclusion Our results provide strong evidence that activity in the precuneus gates GSW discharges in the thalamo-(fronto) cortical network. This study is the first demonstration of a causal link between haemodynamic changes in the precuneus - an index of awareness - and the occurrence of pathological discharges in epilepsy."
https://openalex.org/W1986615911,"The enzyme serine palmitoyltransferase (SPT) catalyzes the rate-limiting step in the de novo synthesis of sphingolipids. Previously the mammalian SPT was described as a heterodimer composed of two subunits, SPTLC1 and SPTLC2. Recently we identified a novel third SPT subunit (SPTLC3). SPTLC3 shows about 68% identity to SPTLC2 and also includes a pyridoxal phosphate consensus motif. Here we report that the overexpression of SPTLC3 in HEK293 cells leads to the formation of two new sphingoid base metabolites, namely C(16)-sphinganine and C(16)-sphingosine. SPTLC3-expressing cells have higher in vitro SPT activities with lauryl- and myristoyl-CoA than SPTLC2-expressing cells, and SPTLC3 mRNA expression levels correlate closely with the C(16)-sphinganine synthesis rates in various human and murine cell lines. Approximately 15% of the total sphingolipids in human plasma contain a C(16) backbone and are found in the high density and low density but not the very low density lipoprotein fraction. In conclusion, we show that the SPTLC3 subunit generates C(16)-sphingoid bases and that sphingolipids with a C(16) backbone constitute a significant proportion of human plasma sphingolipids."
https://openalex.org/W2152179057,"Objectives To estimate HIV prevalence and characterize risk factors among young adults in Asembo, rural western Kenya. Design Community-based cross-sectional survey. Methods From a demographic surveillance system, we selected a random sample of residents aged 13-34 years, who were contacted at home and invited to a nearby mobile study site. Consent procedures for non-emancipated minors required assent and parental consent. From October 2003 - April 2004, consenting participants were interviewed on risk behavior and tested for HIV and HSV-2. HIV voluntary counseling and testing was offered. Results Of 2606 eligible residents, 1822 (70%) enrolled. Primary reasons for refusal included not wanting blood taken, not wanting to learn HIV status, and partner/parental objection. Females comprised 53% of 1762 participants providing blood. Adjusted HIV prevalence was 15.4% overall: 20.5% among females and 10.2% among males. HIV prevalence was highest in women aged 25-29 years (36.5%) and men aged 30-34 years (41.1%). HSV-2 prevalence was 40.0% overall: 53% among females, 25.8% among males. In multivariate models stratified by gender and marital status, HIV infection was strongly associated with age, higher number of sex partners, widowhood, and HSV-2 seropositivity. Conclusions Asembo has extremely high HIV and HSV-2 prevalence, and probable high incidence, among young adults. Further research on circumstances around HIV acquisition in young women and novel prevention strategies (vaccines, microbicides, pre-exposure prophylaxis, HSV-2 prevention, etc.) are urgently needed."

https://openalex.org/W1990389546,"Background This study advances the clinical development of the RTS,S/AS01B candidate malaria vaccine to malaria endemic populations. As a primary objective it compares the safety and reactogenicity of RTS,S/AS01B to the more extensively evaluated RTS,S/AS02A vaccine. Methodology A Phase IIb, single centre, double-blind, controlled trial of 6 months duration with a subsequent 6 month single-blind follow-up conducted in Kisumu West District, Kenya between August 2005 and August 2006. 255 healthy adults aged 18 to 35 years were randomized (1∶1∶1) to receive 3 doses of RTS,S/AS02A, RTS,S/AS01B or rabies vaccine (Rabipur®; Chiron Behring GmbH) at months 0, 1, 2. The primary objective was the occurrence of severe (grade 3) solicited or unsolicited general (i.e. systemic) adverse events (AEs) during 7 days follow up after each vaccination. Principal Findings Both candidate vaccines had a good safety profile and were well tolerated. One grade 3 systemic AE occurred within 7 days of vaccination (RTS,S/AS01B group). No unsolicited AEs or SAEs were related to vaccine. A marked increase in anti-CS antibody GMTs was observed post Dose 2 of both RTS,S/AS01B (31.6 EU/mL [95% CI: 23.9 to 41.6]) and RTS,S/AS02A (16.7 EU/mL [95% CI: 12.9 to 21.7]). A further increase was observed post Dose 3 in both the RTS,S/AS01B (41.4 EU/mL [95% CI: 31.7 to 54.2]) and RTS,S/AS02A (21.4 EU/mL [95% CI: 16.0 to 28.7]) groups. Anti-CS antibody GMTs were significantly greater with RTS,S/AS01B compared to RTS,S/AS02A at all time points post Dose 2 and Dose 3. Both candidate vaccines produced strong anti-HBs responses. Vaccine efficacy in the RTS,S/AS01B group was 29.5% (95% CI: −15.4 to 56.9, p = 0.164) and in the RTS,S/AS02A group 31.7% (95% CI: −11.6 to 58.2, p = 0.128). Conclusions Both candidate malaria vaccines were well tolerated over a 12 month surveillance period. A more favorable immunogenicity profile was observed with RTS,S/AS01B than with RTS,S/AS02A.

https://openalex.org/W2063591253,"Neutrophils play a major role in inflammation by releasing large amounts of ROS produced by NADPH-oxidase and myeloperoxidase (MPO). The proinflammatory cytokine TNFalpha primes ROS production through phosphorylation of the NADPH-oxidase subunit p47phox on Ser345. Conventional anti-inflammatory therapies remain partially successful and may have side effects. Therefore, regulation of neutrophil activation by natural dietary components represents an alternative therapeutic strategy in inflammatory diseases such as inflammatory bowel diseases. The aim of this study was to assess the effect of punicic acid, a conjugated linolenic fatty acid from pomegranate seed oil on TNFalpha-induced neutrophil hyperactivation in vitro and on colon inflammation in vivo.We analyzed the effect of punicic acid on TNFalpha-induced neutrophil upregulation of ROS production in vitro and on TNBS-induced rat colon inflammation. Results show that punicic acid inhibited TNFalpha-induced priming of ROS production in vitro while preserving formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine (fMLP)-induced response. This effect was mediated by the inhibition of Ser345-p47phox phosphorylation and upstream kinase p38MAPK. Punicic acid also inhibited fMLP- and TNFalpha+fMLP-induced MPO extracellular release from neutrophils. In vivo experiments showed that punicic acid and pomegranate seed oil intake decreased neutrophil-activation and ROS/MPO-mediated tissue damage as measured by F2-isoprostane release and protected rats from TNBS-induced colon inflammation.These data show that punicic acid exerts a potent anti-inflammatory effect through inhibition of TNFalpha-induced priming of NADPH oxidase by targeting the p38MAPKinase/Ser345-p47phox-axis and MPO release. This natural dietary compound may provide a novel alternative therapeutic strategy in inflammatory diseases such as inflammatory bowel diseases."

https://openalex.org/W2060539323,"Background AGO1 associates with microRNAs (miRNAs) and regulates mRNAs through cleavage and translational repression. AGO1 homeostasis entails DCL1-dependent production of miR168 from MIR168a and MIR168b transcripts, post-transcriptional stabilization of miR168 by AGO1, and AGO1-catalyzed miR168-guided cleavage of AGO1 mRNA. Principal Findings This study reveals that MIR168a is highly expressed and predominantly produces a 21-nt miR168 species. By contrast, MIR168b is expressed at low levels and produces an equal amount of 21- and 22-nt miR168 species. Only the 21-nt miR168 is preferentially stabilized by AGO1, and consequently, the accumulation of the 22-nt but not the 21-nt miR168 is reduced when DCL1 activity is impaired. mir168a mutants with strongly reduced levels of 21-nt miR168 are viable but exhibit developmental defects, particularly during environmentally challenging conditions. Conclusions/Significance These results suggest that 22-nt miR168 ensures basal cleavage of AGO1 mRNA whereas 21-nt miR168 permits an effective response to endogenous or environmental fluctuations owing to its preferential stabilization by AGO1."

https://openalex.org/W2049784848,"Background Circadian clocks govern daily physiological and molecular rhythms, and putative rhythms in expression of xenobiotic metabolizing (XM) genes have been described in both insects and mammals. Such rhythms could have important consequences for outcomes of chemical exposures at different times of day. To determine whether reported XM gene expression rhythms result in functional rhythms, we examined daily profiles of enzyme activity and dose responses to the pesticides propoxur, deltamethrin, fipronil, and malathion. Methodology/Principal Findings Published microarray expression data were examined for temporal patterns. Male Drosophila were collected for ethoxycoumarin-O-deethylase (ECOD), esterase, glutathione-S-transferase (GST), and, and uridine 5′-diphosphoglucosyltransferase (UGT) enzyme activity assays, or subjected to dose-response tests at four hour intervals throughout the day in both light/dark and constant light conditions. Peak expression of several XM genes cluster in late afternoon. Significant diurnal variation was observed in ECOD and UGT enzyme activity, however, no significant daily variation was observed in esterase or GST activity. Daily profiles of susceptibility to lethality after acute exposure to propoxur and fipronil showed significantly increased resistance in midday, while susceptibility to deltamethrin and malathion varied little. In constant light, which interferes with clock function, the daily variation in susceptibility to propoxur and in ECOD and UGT enzyme activity was depressed. Conclusions/Significance Expression and activities of specific XM enzymes fluctuate during the day, and for specific insecticides, the concentration resulting in 50% mortality varies significantly during the day. Time of day of chemical exposure should be an important consideration in experimental design, use of pesticides, and human risk assessment."
https://openalex.org/W1976966398,"Activation of ligand-gated channels is initiated by the binding of small molecules at extracellular sites and culminates with the opening of a membrane-embedded pore. To investigate how perturbations at ligand-binding domains influence the gating reaction, we examined current traces recorded from individual NMDA receptors in the presence of several subunit-specific partial agonists. We found that low-efficacy agonists acting at either the glycine-binding or the glutamate-binding NMDA receptor subunits had very similar effects on the receptor's activation reaction, possibly reflecting a high degree of coupling between the two subunit types during gating. In addition, we found that partial agonists increased the height of all energy barriers encountered by NMDA receptors during activation. This result stands in sharp contrast to the localized effects that have been observed for pentameric ligand-gated channels and may represent a previously unknown mechanism by which partial agonists reduce receptor activity."

https://openalex.org/W2161402890,"Background and Aims Excessive uptake of commensal bacterial antigens through a permeable intestinal barrier may influence host responses to specific antigen in a genetically predisposed host. The aim of this study was to investigate whether intestinal barrier dysfunction induced by indomethacin treatment affects the host response to intestinal microbiota in gluten-sensitized HLA-DQ8/HCD4 mice. Methodology/Principal Findings HLA-DQ8/HCD4 mice were sensitized with gluten, and gavaged with indomethacin plus gluten. Intestinal permeability was assessed by Ussing chamber; epithelial cell (EC) ultra-structure by electron microscopy; RNA expression of genes coding for junctional proteins by Q-real-time PCR; immune response by in-vitro antigen-specific T-cell proliferation and cytokine analysis by cytometric bead array; intestinal microbiota by fluorescence in situ hybridization and analysis of systemic antibodies against intestinal microbiota by surface staining of live bacteria with serum followed by FACS analysis. Indomethacin led to a more pronounced increase in intestinal permeability in gluten-sensitized mice. These changes were accompanied by severe EC damage, decreased E-cadherin RNA level, elevated IFN-γ in splenocyte culture supernatant, and production of significant IgM antibody against intestinal microbiota. Conclusion Indomethacin potentiates barrier dysfunction and EC injury induced by gluten, affects systemic IFN-γ production and the host response to intestinal microbiota antigens in HLA-DQ8/HCD4 mice. The results suggest that environmental factors that alter the intestinal barrier may predispose individuals to an increased susceptibility to gluten through a bystander immune activation to intestinal microbiota."

https://openalex.org/W2086285109,"Background Overall expression of neurotrophins in the respiratory tract is upregulated in infants infected by the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), but it is unclear where (structural vs. inflammatory cells, upper vs. lower airways) and why, these changes occur. We analyzed systematically the expression of neurotrophic factors and receptors following RSV infection of human nasal, tracheal, and bronchial epithelial cells, and tested the hypothesis that neurotrophins work as innate survival factors for infected respiratory epithelia. Methodology Expression of neurotrophic factors (nerve growth factor, NGF; brain-derived neurotrophic factor, BDNF) and receptors (trkA, trkB, p75) was analyzed at the protein level by immunofluorescence and flow cytometry and at the mRNA level by real-time PCR. Targeted siRNA was utilized to blunt NGF expression, and its effect on virus-induced apoptosis/necrosis was evaluated by flow cytometry following annexin V/7-AAD staining. Principal Findings RSV infection was more efficient in cells from more distal (bronchial) vs. more proximal origin. In bronchial cells, RSV infection induced transcript and protein overexpression of NGF and its high-affinity receptor trkA, with concomitant downregulation of the low-affinity p75NTR. In contrast, tracheal cells exhibited an increase in BDNF, trkA and trkB, and nasal cells increased only trkA. RSV-infected bronchial cells transfected with NGF-specific siRNA exhibited decreased trkA and increased p75NTR expression. Furthermore, the survival of bronchial epithelial cells was dramatically decreased when their endogenous NGF supply was depleted prior to RSV infection. Conclusions/Significance RSV infection of the distal airway epithelium, but not of the more proximal sections, results in overexpression of NGF and its trkA receptor, while the other p75NTR receptor is markedly downregulated. This pattern of neurotrophin expression confers protection against virus-induced apoptosis, and its inhibition amplifies programmed cell death in the infected bronchial epithelium. Thus, pharmacologic modulation of NGF expression may offer a promising new approach for management of common respiratory infections."
https://openalex.org/W2095069029,"Translationally Controlled Tumor Protein (TCTP) found in nasal lavage fluids of allergic patients was named IgE-dependent histamine-releasing factor (HRF). Human recombinant HRF (HrHRF) has been recently reported to be much less effective than HRF produced from activated mononuclear cells (HRFmn).We found that only NH(2)-terminal truncated, but not C-terminal truncated, TCTP shows cytokine releasing activity compared to full-length TCTP. Interestingly, only NH(2)-terminal truncated TCTP, unlike full-length TCTP, forms dimers through intermolecular disulfide bonds. We tested the activity of dimerized full-length TCTP generated by fusing it to rabbit Fc region. The untruncated-full length protein (Fc-HrTCTP) was more active than HrTCTP in BEAS-2B cells, suggesting that dimerization of TCTP, rather than truncation, is essential for the activation of TCTP in allergic responses. We used confocal microscopy to evaluate the affinity of TCTPs to its putative receptor. We detected stronger fluorescence in the plasma membrane of BEAS-2B cells incubated with Del-N11TCTP than those incubated with rat recombinant TCTP (RrTCTP). Allergenic activity of Del-N11TCTP prompted us to see whether the NH(2)-terminal truncated TCTP can induce allergic airway inflammation in vivo. While RrTCTP had no influence on airway inflammation, Del-N11TCTP increased goblet cell hyperplasia in both lung and rhinal cavity. The dimerized protein was found in sera from allergic patients, and bronchoalveolar lavage fluids from airway inflamed mice.Dimerization of TCTP seems to be essential for its cytokine-like activity. Our study has potential to enhance the understanding of pathogenesis of allergic disease and provide a target for allergic drug development."
https://openalex.org/W2060042773,"Common variable immunodeficiency disorder (CVID) is a heterogeneous syndrome, characterized by deficient antibody production and recurrent bacterial infections in addition abnormalities in T cells. CD4(+)CD25(high) regulatory T cells (Treg) are essential modulators of immune responses, including down-modulation of immune response to pathogens, allergens, cancer cells and self-antigens.In this study we set out to investigate the frequency of Treg cells in CVID patients and correlate with their immune activation status.Sixteen patients (6 males and 10 females) with CVID who had been treated with regular intravenous immunoglobulin and 14 controls were enrolled. Quantitative analyses of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were performed by multiparametric flow cytometry using the following cell markers: CD38, HLA-DR, CCR5 (immune activation); CD4, CD25, FOXP3, CD127, and OX40 (Treg cells); Ki-67 and IFN-gamma (intracellular cytokine).A significantly lower proportion of CD4(+)CD25(high)FOXP3 T cells was observed in CVID patients compared with healthy controls (P<0.05). In addition to a higher proportion of CD8(+) T cells from CVID patients expressing the activation markers, CD38(+) and HLA-DR(+) (P<0.05), we observed no significant correlation between Tregs and immune activation.Our results demonstrate that a reduction in Treg cells could have impaired immune function in CVID patients."
https://openalex.org/W2092549115,"The family of zinc finger-containing GATA transcription factors plays critical roles in cell lineage specification during early embryonic development and organ formation. GATA4 and GATA6 were found to be frequently lost in ovarian cancer, and the loss is proposed to account for dedifferentiation of the cancer cells.We further investigated the expression of GATA4 and GATA6 in ovarian surface epithelial lesions and histological subtypes of ovarian carcinomas by immunostaining. GATA4 and GATA6 were found to be absent in high percentages (80 to 90%) of serous, clear cell, and endometrioid ovarian cancer examined. In contrast, both were found positive in 11 out of 12 cases of mucinous carcinomas, suggesting the expression of the GATA factors can distinguish mucinous cancer from other histological subtypes. GATA4 was frequently lost in preneoplastic lesions such as morphologically normal inclusion cysts and epithelial hyperplasia adjacent to malignant cells. The loss of GATA6 correlates closely with neoplastic morphological transformation of ovarian surface epithelia. In culture, GATA4 expression was progressively reduced upon passaging primary ovarian surface epithelial cells, which correlated with changes in histone modification of the GATA4 locus. A reduced GATA6 gene dosage as in GATA6 (+/-) mice led to an increased pre-neoplastic changes and inclusion cysts in the ovaries, suggesting the loss of GATA6 contributes to ovarian cancer development.This study suggests that the expression status of GATA4 and GATA6 may dictate distinct pathologic pathways leading to serous or mucinous ovarian carcinomas. The readily loss of GATA4 expression through changes in chromatin conformation suggests a potential non-phenotypic initiating event, leading to subsequent loss of GATA6, morphological transformation, and ultimate tumorigenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2159341699,"The glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) is a potent survival factor for several neuronal populations in different brain regions, including the hippocampus. However, no information is available on the: (1) hippocampal subregions involved in the GDNF-neuroprotective actions upon excitotoxicity, (2) identity of GDNF-responsive hippocampal cells, (3) transduction pathways involved in the GDNF-mediated neuroprotection in the hippocampus. We addressed these questions in organotypic hippocampal slices exposed to GDNF in presence of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) by immunoblotting, immunohistochemistry, and confocal analysis. In hippocampal slices GDNF acts through the activation of the tyrosine kinase receptor, Ret, without involving the NCAM-mediated pathway. Both Ret and ERK phosphorylation mainly occurred in the CA3 region where the two activated proteins co-localized. GDNF protected in a greater extent CA3 rather than CA1 following NMDA exposure. This neuroprotective effect targeted preferentially neurons, as assessed by NeuN staining. GDNF neuroprotection was associated with a significant increase of Ret phosphorylation in both CA3 and CA1. Interestingly, confocal images revealed that upon NMDA exposure, Ret activation occurred in microglial cells in the CA3 and CA1 following GDNF exposure. Collectively, this study shows that CA3 and CA1 hippocampal regions are highly responsive to GDNF-induced Ret activation and neuroprotection, and suggest that, upon excitotoxicity, such neuroprotection involves a GDNF modulation of microglial cell activity."
https://openalex.org/W2002030049,"The different pocket proteins are established as negative cell cycle regulators. With regard to the repressor functions of pocket proteins in cellular senescence, studies so far have mainly focused on pRb/p105. Here, we show that in a broad range of wild-type p53-expressing human tumor cells, and in human diploid fibroblasts, Rb2/p130 is the dominating pocket protein in replicative and in accelerated senescence. Senescent cells are arrested at the transition from late G1- to early S-phase, as indicated by the absence of S- and G2-phase cyclins A and B. Expression of cyclin A and entry into S-phase resumed after RNA interference-mediated knockdown of Rb2/p130. Activation of different upstream pathways by overexpression of either p21 or p16 converged on Rb2/p130 accumulation and induced senescence. In contrast, p53- or p21-negative cells treated with DNA-damaging agents failed to accumulate Rb2/p130 and to enter senescence. Our data suggest that Rb2/p130 is a member of the p53–p21 DNA damage signaling cascade, and represents the essential pocket protein family member needed for the induction of any type of senescence."
https://openalex.org/W2040824787,"The Mycobacterium tuberculosis Beijing strains are a family highly prevalent in Asia and have recently spread worldwide, causing a number of epidemics, suggesting that they express virulence factors not found in other M. tuberculosis strains. Accordingly, we looked for putative characteristic compounds by comparing the lipid profiles of several Beijing and non-Beijing strains. All the Beijing strains analyzed were found to synthesize structural variants of two well known characteristic lipids of the tubercle bacillus, namely phthiocerol dimycocerosates (DIM) and eventually phenolglycolipids (PGL). These variants were not found in non-Beijing M. tuberculosis isolates. Structural elucidation of these variants showed that they consist of phthiotriol and glycosylated phenolphthiotriol dimycocerosates, eventually acylated with 1 mol of palmitic acid, in addition to the conventional acylation of the β-diol by mycocerosic acids. We demonstrated that this unusual lipid profile resulted from a single point mutation in the Rv2952 gene, which encodes the S-adenosylmethionine-dependent methyltransferase participating to the O-methylation of the third hydroxyl of the phthiotriol and phenolphthiotriol in the biosynthetic pathway of DIM and PGL. Consistently, the mutated enzyme exhibited in vitro a much lower O-methyltransferase activity than did the wild-type Rv2952. We finally demonstrated that the structural variants of DIM and PGL fulfill the same function in the cell envelope and virulence than their conventional counterparts.

The factors contributing to the development of tuberculosis after infection with the etiologic agent of this disease, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, are not completely understood. It is currently thought that the genetic traits of both host and pathogen influence the outcome of the disease (1Caws M. Thwaites G. Dunstan S. Hawn T.R. Lan N.T. Thuong N.T. Stepniewska K.

On the pathogen side, molecular epidemiological studies have differentiated clinical isolates of M. tuberculosis into defined genetically related lineages (3Gagneux S. Small P.M. Lancet Infect. Dis. 2007; 7: 328-337Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (547) Google Scholar). One of the most important worldwide lineages, the “Beijing” lineage, was initially described by van Soolingen et al. (4van Soolingen D. Qian L. de Haas P.E. Douglas J.T. Traore H. Portaels F. Qing H.Z. Enkhsaikan D. Nymadawa P. van Embden J.D. J. Clin. Microbiol. 1995; 33: 3234-3238Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) who showed that more than 85% of M. tuberculosis isolates from the Beijing region belong to this genetically conserved genotype. The Beijing strains were grouped together on the basis of their highly similar multicopy IS6110 restriction fragment polymorphism patterns, the deletion of spacers 1–34 in the direct repeat region found in all M. tuberculosis strains, and the insertion of IS6110 into the dnaA-dnaN locus (5Kremer K. Glynn J.R. Lillebaek T. Niemann S. Kurepina N.E. Kreiswirth B.N. Bifani P.J. van Soolingen D. J. Clin. Microbiol. 2004; 42: 4040-4049Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). This genotype family of M. tuberculosis is highly prevalent in Southeast Asia, where more than 50% of the strains isolated correspond to the Beijing genotype (6European Concerted Action on New Generation Genetic Markers and Techniques for the Epidemiology and Control of TuberculosisEmerg. Inf. Dis. 2006; 12: 736-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). However, these strains have spread worldwide and have been responsible for major outbreaks of tuberculosis. The “W” strain responsible for a multidrug-resistant tuberculosis in the New York region, for example, belongs to this genotype (7Bifani P.J. Plikaytis B.B. Kapur V. Stockbauer K. Pan X. Lutfey M.L.

A Beijing strain was introduced into Gran-Canaria Island in 1993 and rapidly spread; this strain accounted for 27.1% of tuberculosis cases on the island in 1996 (9Caminero J.A. Pena M.J. Campos-Herrero M.I. Rodríguez J.C. García I. Cabrera P. Lafoz C. Samper S. Takiff H. Afonso O. Pavón J.M. Torres M.J. van Soolingen D. Enarson D.A. Martin C. Am. J. Resp. Crit.

This spread of Beijing strains from the region of the world in which they are endemic to other areas in which they have become epidemic suggests that these strains may be more virulent than others. Consistent with this hypothesis, several studies have demonstrated that mice infected with Beijing strains die more rapidly than mice infected with other strains (10López B. Aguilar D. Orozco H.

This hypervirulence phenotype has been associated with a failure of Beijing strains to induce or to maintain an adequate Th1-type immune response (10López B. Aguilar D. Orozco H. Burger M. Espitia C.

A recent study suggests that patients infected with Beijing strains are more likely to develop extrathoracic tuberculosis than people infected with strains of other lineages (14Kong Y. Cave M.D. Zhang L. Foxman B. Marrs C.F. Bates J.H. Yang Z.H. J. Clin. Microbiol. 2007; 45: 409-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). This observation is consistent with the results obtained in a rabbit model with the Beijing strain HN878, which was found more likely to infect the brain and to disseminate (15Tsenova L. Ellison E. Harbacheuski R. Moreira A.L. Kurepina N. Reed M.B. Mathema B. Barry 3rd, C.E. Kaplan G. J. Infect. Dis. 2005; 192: 98-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). A recent study in Vietnam pointed out that the typical lineage of Beijing genotype strains is more frequently found in patients who received a Bacillus Calmette-Guérin vaccination. This suggests that bacteria of this lineage are more capable of circumventing Bacillus Calmette-Guérin-induced immunity (16Kremer K. van der Werf M.J. Au B.K. Kam K.M. van Doorn H.R. Borgdroff M.W. van Soolingen D. Emerg. Inf. Dis. 2009; 15: 335-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). In the case of the HN878 strain, the production of a phenolic glycolipid (PGL) 3The abbreviations used are: PGLphenolglycolipidDIMphthiocerol dimycocerosatesHyghygromycinKmkanamycinMALDI-TOFmatrix-assisted laser desorption-ionization time-of-flightcfucolony-forming unitELISAenzyme-linked immunosorbent assayTNF-αtumor necrosis factor-αILinterleukinBMDMbone marrow-derived macrophageMICminimal inhibitory concentration. 3The abbreviations used are: PGLphenolglycolipidDIMphthiocerol dimycocerosatesHyghygromycinKmkanamycinMALDI-TOFmatrix-assisted laser desorption-ionization time-of-flightcfucolony-forming unitELISAenzyme-linked immunosorbent assayTNF-αtumor necrosis factor-αILinterleukinBMDMbone marrow-derived macrophageMICminimal inhibitory concentration. was shown to be important for the hypervirulent phenotype. The disruption of pks15/1, a PGL biosynthetic gene (17Constant P. Perez E. Malaga W. Lanéelle M.A. Saurel O. Daffé M. Guilhot C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 38148-38158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar), in strain HN878 increased the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines by infected murine bone marrow macrophages and decreased the virulence of the bacterium in the mouse and rabbit disease models (13Reed M.B. Domenech P. Manca C. Su H. Barczak A.K. Kreiswirth B.N. Kaplan G. Barry 3rd, C.E. Nature. 2004; 431: 84-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (592) Google Scholar, 15Tsenova L. Ellison E. Harbacheuski R.

PGL are very unusual molecules with a lipid core and a saccharide domain. The lipid core is formed by a long chain β-diol, naturally occurring as a diester of polymethyl-branched fatty acids and common to phthiocerol dimycocerosates (DIM), another group of lipids found in the cell envelope of M. tuberculosis and a few other slow-growing Mycobacterium species (18Daffé M. Laneelle M.A. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1988; 134: 2049-2055PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 1A). In the major form of PGL from M. tuberculosis (PGL-tb), this lipid core is ω-terminated by an aromatic nucleus glycosylated with a 2,3,4-tri-O-methyl-l-fucopyranosyl-(α1→3)-l-rhamnopyranosyl-(α1→3)-2-O-methyl-l-rhamnopyranosyl-(α1→) (19Daffé M. Lacave C. Lanéelle M.A. Lanéelle G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1987; 167: 155-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1A). This structure is specific to M. tuberculosis and Mycobacterium canettii (18Daffé M. Laneelle M.A. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1988; 134: 2049-2055PubMed Google Scholar, 20Malaga W. Constant P. Euphrasie D. Cataldi A. Daffé M. Reyrat J.M. Guilhot C. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 15177-15184Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Only a few M. tuberculosis strains synthesize PGL-tb because of a natural frameshift mutation in the pks15/1 gene (17Constant P. Perez E. Malaga W. Lanéelle M.A. Saurel O. Daffé M. Guilhot C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 38148-38158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Thus, based on the results of Reed et al. (13Reed M.B. Domenech P. Manca C. Su H. Barczak A.K. Kreiswirth B.N. Kaplan G. Barry 3rd, C.E. Nature. 2004; 431: 84-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (592) Google Scholar), it was thought that the production of this glycolipid was the principal cause of hypervirulence in Beijing strains. However, even within the Beijing lineage, only a minority of isolates produce PGL-tb (21Reed M.B. Gagneux S. Deriemer K. Small P.M. Barry 3rd, C.E. J. Bacteriol. 2007; 189: 2583-2589Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 22Sinsimer D. Huet G. Manca C. Tsenova L. Koo M.S. Kurepina N. Kana B. Mathema B. Marras S.A. Kreiswirth B.N. Guilhot C. Kaplan G. Infect. Immun. 2008; 76: 3027-3036Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). In addition, complementation of the laboratory strain H37Rv with a functional pks15/1 allele, allowing the production of PGL-tb, does not significantly increase the virulence of this strain in the mouse and rabbit models (22Sinsimer D. Huet G. Manca C. Tsenova L. Koo M.S. Kurepina N. Kana B. Mathema B. Marras S.A. Kreiswirth B.N. Guilhot C. Kaplan G. Infect. Immun. 2008; 76: 3027-3036Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). The molecular reasons for the higher virulence of strains of the Beijing lineage therefore remain unclear. phenolglycolipid phthiocerol dimycocerosates hygromycin kanamycin matrix-assisted laser desorption-ionization time-of-flight colony-forming unit enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay tumor necrosis factor-α interleukin bone marrow-derived macrophage minimal inhibitory concentration. phenolglycolipid phthiocerol dimycocerosates hygromycin kanamycin matrix-assisted laser desorption-ionization time-of-flight colony-forming unit enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay tumor necrosis factor-α interleukin bone marrow-derived macrophage minimal inhibitory concentration. In this study, we identified a mutation specific to the Beijing lineage that affected the activity of an enzyme involved in PGL-tb and DIM biosynthetic pathways. We analyzed the impact of this mutation on the structure of these compounds and explored the potential changes in cell envelope function and virulence induced by this mutation. M. tuberculosis Beijing strains were obtained from the collection of the National Institute for Public Health and the Environment (Bilthoven, The Netherlands), with the exception of Beijing strains HN878 and 1237 that were kindly provided by Prof. Clifton Barry III (Tuberculosis Research Section, National Institutes of Health, Rockville, MD) and Prof. Carlos Martin (Grupo de Genetica de Micobacterias, Universidad de Zaragoza, Spain) respectively. M. tuberculosis strains were grown at 37 °C in Middlebrook 7H9 broth (Invitrogen) containing ADC (0.2% dextrose, 0.5% bovine serum albumin fraction V, 0.0003% beef catalase) and 0.05% Tween 80 when necessary, and on solid Middlebrook 7H11 broth containing OADC (ADC plus 0.005% oleic acid). When required, kanamycin (Km) and hygromycin (Hyg) were used at concentrations of 40 and 50 μg·ml−1, respectively. Plasmids were propagated at 37 °C in Escherichia coli DH5α in LB broth or LB agar (Invitrogen) supplemented with either Km (40 μg·ml−1) or Hyg (200 μg·ml−1). Genomic DNA was used as the template for PCR amplification of the Rv2952 gene with specific primers binding 91 bp upstream and 64 bp downstream from the Rv2952 gene as follows: 2952 forward (5′-GGATGTCATGGCATCGACCG-3′) and 2952 reverse (5′-ATATAGAACGATGTCGAACTCG-3′). The PCR was performed on a GeneAmp PCR System 2700 thermocycler (Applied Biosystems) in a final volume of 50 μl containing 2.5 units of TaqDNA polymerase (New England Biolabs), 10% DMSO, and 1 μm of each primer. Reactions were initiated by denaturation for 5 min at 94 °C, and primer extension was then carried out over 30 cycles of denaturation for 30 s at 94 °C, annealing for 30 s at 57 °C, and extension for 1 min at 72 °C. A final extension of 10 min at 72 °C was then applied. PCR products were analyzed by electrophoresis in a 0.8% agarose gel. The 968-bp fragment was purified with the QIAquick purification kit (Qiagen, Courtaboeuf, France) and inserted into the pGEM®-T vector (Promega). Sequencing was carried out by Millegen (Labège, France) with the SP6 and T7 primers. A region covering the Rv2952 gene, from 500 bp upstream from the start codon to 8 bp downstream from the stop codon, was amplified by PCR from the M. tuberculosis H37Rv and HN878 strains with the primers Rv2952M (5′-TATATGACGTCGGATTGCGCCGACCTGCA-3′) and Rv2952N (5′-TATATACTAGTCAGTCCTTGGTGAAGCAGTA-3′). The PCR products were purified, digested with AatII and SpeI, and inserted between the AatII and SpeI sites of pMIP12d vector (20Malaga W. Constant P. Euphrasie D. Cataldi A. Daffé M. Reyrat J.M. Guilhot C. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 15177-15184Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The inserts were recovered from these plasmids as AatII-NheI fragments containing the transcription terminator ESAT 6. These fragments were inserted into AatII + NheI-digested pMV361 vector to give rise to p2952wt and p2952mu. These plasmids were transferred alone or with pPET1 into H37Rv, HN878, and 94-1707 cells by electroporation. Transformants were selected onto 7H11 plates supplemented with OADC, Km, and Hyg when required. The Rv2952 or Rv2952 G176R proteins were produced in E. coli using a T7 promoter expression system. The corresponding genes were cloned upstream in a His tag coding sequence in plasmid pET26b (Novagen). E. coli BL21(DE3) strains were transformed with each construct and the empty vector and grown in 10 ml of LB medium supplemented with antibiotics. At an A600 nm of 0.4, expression of Rv2952 (or the mutated protein) was induced by adding 0.1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside and a further incubation for 6 h at 20 °C. Cells were collected by centrifugation, and stored at −20 °C. After thawing at room temperature, cells were resuspended in 1 ml of buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8) and sonicated using a Vibra cell apparatus (Bioblock Scientific), three times for 20 s (microtip 4, 50% duty cycle), in ice. The cleared lysates were obtained following centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 15 min. Protein concentration was assayed using the method of Bradford (Bio-Rad protein assay), and the amounts of Rv2952 and Rv2952 G176R proteins in these extracts were evaluated by Western blot using anti-His antibodies (Rockland), revelation with ECL Western blotting detection system (GE Healthcare), and quantification of the signal using GS800 calibrated densitometer and Quantity One 4.6.3 software (Bio-Rad). Two substrates were used for O-methyltransferase activity as follows: the phthiotriol dimycocerosates prepared from M. tuberculosis, the natural substrate of the enzyme, and the 2-hexadecanol (Aldrich) chosen for its structural analogy with phthiocerol and relatives, especially phthiocerol B (18Daffé M. Laneelle M.A. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1988; 134: 2049-2055PubMed Google Scholar) and for the putative solubility problem with very long chain compounds as the C80–90 DIM-like compounds in in vitro tests. The lipids were dissolved at 60 mm for 2-hexadecanol and 1.5 mm for phthiotriol dimycocerosates in dimethyl sulfoxide, and S-[methyl-14C]adenosyl-l-methionine, specific activity 50.43 mCi·mmol −1 (PerkinElmer Life Sciences), was used as a tracer. The assay buffer was 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8. Briefly, in a final volume of 275 μl, 50–200 μl of protein crude extracts (0.5 mg·ml−1) were incubated at 37 °C for 1 h under agitation (200 rpm) in the presence of lipid substrates (10 μl) and S-[methyl-14C]adenosyl-l-methionine (28 μl). The reaction was stopped by adding a few drops of 20% H2SO4, and the reaction products were extracted three times with diethyl ether. The upper organic phases were pooled, washed with water until neutrality, and dried under air stream. The whole resulting material, dissolved in diethyl ether (30 μl), was spotted on TLC and run with petroleum ether/ether 9:1 (v/v) before exposure to Typhoon Imager (Amersham Biosciences) for the detection of labeled lipids. In initial experiments, kinetics of product formation was determined by stopping the reaction at 5, 10, 15, 20, 30, and 60 min and 6 h (data not shown). The incubation time (1 h) of subsequent experiments was chosen because the reaction was in initial velocity phase. Each strain was cultured (16 ml) to exponential growth phase and labeled by incubation with 0.625 μCi·ml−1 [1-14C]propionate (specific activity of 54 Ci·mol−1) for 24 h with continuous shaking. Lipids were extracted by adding 2 volumes of CH3OH and 1 volume of CHCl3 to 0.8 volume of culture, to yield a homogeneous one-phase mixture. After incubation for 2 days, the mixture was partitioned into two phases by adding 1 volume of H2O/CHCl3 (1:1, v/v). The organic phase was recovered. The extraction was repeated once by adding 1 volume of CHCl3 to the aqueous phase. The organic phases were pooled, washed at least twice with water, and dried before analysis. The dried lipid extracts from each culture were dissolved in 100 μl of CHCl3, and 30 μl of this preparation were spotted onto a Silica Gel 60 TLC plate (20 × 20 cm; Merck). The TLC plate was run in CHCl3/CH3OH (95:5, v/v) or in petroleum ether/diethyl ether (90:10, v/v) for PGL and DIM analysis, respectively. Labeled lipids were visualized with a Typhoon PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences). The production of various PGL and DIM forms was quantified by comparing the number of counts/min obtained for the lipid of interest with the total number of counts/min spotted. As the various PGL and DIM forms produced in the same batch of culture are expected to be labeled at the same position and with the same efficiency, comparison of this ratio provided a good evaluation of the relative amount of each DIM and PGL variant. For nonradioactive analysis, bacterial cells were harvested from 125-ml cultures in Sauton's medium, and lipids were extracted by a first incubation in CHCl3/CH3OH (1:2, v/v) for 2 days at room temperature and then in CHCl3/CH3OH (2:1, v/v). The two organic phases were pooled, washed twice with water, and dried before analysis. Extracted mycobacterial lipids were analyzed by TLC after resuspension in CHCl3 at a final concentration of 20 mg·ml−1. Equivalent amounts of each extract were spotted on TLC plates. DIM and PGL were visualized by spraying the plates with 10% phosphomolybdic acid in ethanol or with a 0.2% anthrone solution in concentrated H2SO4, respectively, followed by heating. For structural analysis, lipids were fractionated by chromatography on a Florisil column. Increasing concentrations of diethyl ether in petroleum ether or CH3OH in CHCl3 were used as eluents to obtain various members of the DIM and PGL family, respectively. The fractions containing the product of interest were then pooled and separated on preparative TLC. An enriched fraction was then finally recovered by scraping the silica gel from the plates. Purified molecules were analyzed by matrix-assisted laser desorption-ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry, as described previously (23Laval F. Lanéelle M.A. Déon C. Monsarrat B. Daffé M. Anal. Chem. 2001; 73: 4537-4544Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Spectra were acquired in reflectron mode, with an Applied Biosystems 4700 analyzer mass spectrometer (Applied Biosystems, Framingham) equipped with an Nd:YAG laser (wavelength 355 nm; pulse <500 ps; repetition rate 200 Hz). A total of 2500 shots were accumulated in positive ion mode, and mass spectrometry data were acquired with the default calibration for the instrument. NMR spectroscopy experiments were carried out at 295 K on a Bruker AVANCE spectrometer operating at 600,13 MHz with a 5-mm triple resonance TCI 1H 13C 15N pulsed field z-gradient cryoprobe. Samples were dissolved in 99.9% CDCl3. Chemical shifts are expressed in parts/million using the chloroform signal as an internal reference (7.23 ppm). Cultures of strains used for SDS resistance assays were grown to mid-exponential growth phase in 7H9 supplemented with ADC, 0.05% Tween 80, and Km when necessary. Cultures were centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min at room temperature in a Jouan CR412 centrifuge with a T4 swing out rotor. The cells were then resuspended in 7H9-ADC without Tween 80 and incubated at 37 °C for 48 h. Bacterial concentration was evaluated by measuring the absorbance at 600 nm, and 10-ml cultures were inoculated to a final A600 of 0.02. SDS was added to each culture at a final concentration of 0.1%. Aliquots were collected after 0, 1, 4, and 8 days of growth, and the number of viable bacteria remaining was evaluated by plating serial dilutions on solid medium. Bacteria were prepared 48 h before plating from frozen stocks of known concentrations. Stocks were centrifuged and bacteria were resuspended in 7H9 and incubated at 37 °C for 2 days. Serial dilutions were then plated on 7H11 containing various concentration of rifampicin, isoniazid, or ethambutol and incubated for 3–4 weeks at 37 °C. For all the drugs tested, the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) corresponded to the minimal drug concentrations resulting in decreases of more than 90% in cfu counts. For the mixed infection experiments in mice, the M. tuberculosis HN878 and 94-1707 wild-type strains were transformed with the modified mycobacterial plasmid pMV361Hy derived from the pMV361 plasmid in which the Km resistance cassette was replaced by a Hyg resistance marker. The inoculum was prepared by mixing HN878:pMV361Hy cells with HN878:p2952wt cells, or 94-1707:pMV361Hy/94-1707:p2952wt, at a final concentration of 2.5 × 106 cfu·ml−1 for each strain. The concentration of the inoculum was determined by plating serial dilutions on 7H11 plates containing either Km or Hyg. Fifteen BALB/c mice were infected intranasally with 20 μl (1 × 105 cfu) of the inoculum, and for each infection group, five mice from each group were killed 1, 21, and 42 days after infection, and the numbers of colony-forming units present in lungs and spleen (except for day 1 after infection) were determined by plating serial dilutions on 7H11 plates containing either Km or Hyg serial dilutions of homogenates obtained from the organs by homogenizing tissues in 5 ml of NaCl/Pi supplemented with 0.05% Tween 80. All investigations in mice were carried out in accordance with CNRS guidelines for animal experimentation and were approved by the “Comité Regional d'Ethique pour l'Expérimentation Animale.” We generated bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDM) by flushing bone marrow cells from the femurs of ∼8-week-old B6D2 F1 mice into high glucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 20% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (Dutscher), 10% L929 conditioned medium, and 2 mm glutamine. For the infection assays, mouse bone marrow cells were seeded at a density of 2 × 105 cells per well in 24-well plates and allowed to differentiate for 7 days. Bacteria used for the infection were freshly prepared in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 20% fetal calf serum and 2 mm glutamine. Bacterial concentration was adjusted to a final concentration of 3.3 × 106 bacteria per ml on the basis of absorbance 600 nm. An aliquot of the M. tuberculosis suspensions used to infect macrophages was spread on 7H11 plates to determine the number of bacteria in the inoculum more precisely. Infection assays were carried out as follows. The culture medium of each well was removed, and the cells were washed once with 500 μl of phosphate-buffered saline. We then added 300 μl of the mycobacterial suspension to obtain a multiplicity of infection of 5:1 (bacilli/BMDM). Control wells containing uninfected macrophages were filled with 300 μl of fresh medium. Infected and uninfected cultures were incubated for 4 h at 37 °C in an atmosphere containing 5% CO2. Infection was terminated by removing the overlaying medium and washing each well three times with 500 μl of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium before adding 400 μl of fresh culture medium per well. At 5 and 24 h the supernatants were recovered and analyzed for the presence of TNF-α, IL-10, IL-12p70, and MCP-1 by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) (R & D Systems). Statistical analysis of the data were carried out with a one-way analysis of variance test to determine the significance of differences between the cytokine levels. M. tuberculosis strains are known to produce species-specific lipids that are critical for their virulence (24Daffé M. Draper P. Adv. Microb. Physiol. 1998; 39: 131-203Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 25Guilhot C. Chalut C. Daffé M. The Mycobacterial Cell Envelope.in: Daffé M. Reyrat J.M. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D.

Some strains also elaborate the structurally related glycosylated phenolphthiocerol dimycocerosates (PGL-tb; Fig. 1A). These variants have different mobilities on TLC, and thus their production can be analyzed by this method. TLC analysis of the lipids of various clinical isolates of M. tuberculosis showed a special lipid profile for the Beijing isolates, particularly in the migration area of DIM (Fig. 1B) and PGL (data not shown).

https://openalex.org/W2000182700,"While stress is known to impact reproductive performance, the pathways involved are not entirely understood. Corticosteroid effects on the functioning of the hypothalamus-pituitary-gonadal axis are thought to be a key aspect of stress-mediated reproductive dysfunction. A vital component of the stress response is the pituitary secretion of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), which binds to the melanocortin 2 receptor (MC2R) in the adrenal glands and activates cortisol biosynthesis. We recently reported MC2R mRNA abundance in fish gonads leading to the hypothesis that ACTH may be directly involved in gonadal steroid modulation. Using zebrafish (Danio rerio) ovarian follicles, we tested the hypothesis that acute ACTH stimulation modulates cortisol and estradiol (E(2)) secretion. ACTH neither affected cortisol nor unstimulated E(2) release from ovarian follicles. However, ACTH suppressed human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG)-stimulated E(2) secretion in a dose-related manner, with a maximum decrease of 62% observed at 1 I.U. ACTH mL(-1). This effect of ACTH on E(2) release was not observed in the presence of either 8-bromo-cAMP or forskolin, suggesting that the mechanism(s) involved in steroid attenuation was upstream of adenylyl cyclase activation. Overall, our results suggest that a stress-induced rise in plasma ACTH levels may initiate a rapid down-regulation of acute stimulated E(2) biosynthesis in the zebrafish ovary, underscoring a novel physiological role for this pituitary peptide in modulating reproductive activity."
https://openalex.org/W2098783586,"Reconstructing the history of divergence and gene flow between closely-related organisms has long been a difficult task of evolutionary genetics. Recently, new approaches based on the coalescence theory have been developed to test the existence of gene flow during the process of divergence. The deep sea is a motivating place to apply these new approaches. Differentiation by adaptation can be driven by the heterogeneity of the hydrothermal environment while populations should not have been strongly perturbed by climatic oscillations, the main cause of geographic isolation at the surface.Samples of DNA sequences were obtained for seven nuclear loci and a mitochondrial locus in order to conduct a multi-locus analysis of divergence and gene flow between two closely related and hybridizing species of hydrothermal vent mussels, Bathymodiolus azoricus and B. puteoserpentis. The analysis revealed that (i) the two species have started to diverge approximately 0.760 million years ago, (ii) the B. azoricus population size was 2 to 5 time greater than the B. puteoserpentis and the ancestral population and (iii) gene flow between the two species occurred over the complete species range and was mainly asymmetric, at least for the chromosomal regions studied.A long history of gene flow has been detected between the two Bathymodiolus species. However, it proved very difficult to conclusively distinguish secondary introgression from ongoing parapatric differentiation. As powerful as coalescence approaches could be, we are left by the fact that natural populations often deviates from standard assumptions of the underlying model. A more direct observation of the history of recombination at one of the seven loci studied suggests an initial period of allopatric differentiation during which recombination was blocked between lineages. Even in the deep sea, geographic isolation may well be a crucial promoter of speciation."
https://openalex.org/W2070736788,"Reduced expression of the CDK inhibitor p27Kip1 (p27) in human lung cancer correlates with tumor aggressiveness and poor prognosis. However, the regulation of p27 expression and the role of p27 during lung cancer are poorly understood. Urethane-induced lung tumors in mice frequently harbor mutations in the Kras oncogene, and in this study, we use this model to address the regulation of p27 during tumorigenesis. The Ras effector Akt is known to regulate p27 mRNA abundance by phosphorylating and inactivating the FOXO transcription factors. Phosphorylated Akt and FOXO proteins were both increased in lung tumors, correlating with a reduction in p27 mRNA transcript. Akt also directly phosphorylates p27 and regulates its nuclear/cytoplasmic localization. Tumors showed a reduced nuclear/cytoplasmic ratio of p27 protein, together with an increase in phosphorylated Thr197 p27 in the cytoplasmic pool. Treatment of lung tumor-bearing mice with the phosphoinositol-3 kinase inhibitor LY294002 induced a rapid decrease in phosphorylated Akt and phosphorylated p27, concomitant with an increase in nuclear p27. Germline p27 deficiency accelerated both the growth and malignant progression of urethane-induced lung tumors, and did so in a cell autonomous manner, confirming a causal role of p27 in tumor suppression. These results show that p27 is a potent barrier to the growth and malignant progression of Kras-initiated lung tumors. Further, the reduction of nuclear p27 in tumors is mediated by oncogene signaling pathways, which can be reversed by pharmacological agents."
https://openalex.org/W1982407302,"ErbB2/HER2/Neu-overexpressing breast cancers are characterized by poor survival due to high proliferation and metastasis rates and identifying downstream targets of ErbB2 should facilitate developing novel therapies for this disease. Gene expression profiling revealed the transcriptional regulator LIM-only protein 4 (LMO4) is upregulated during ErbB2-induced mouse mammary gland tumorigenesis. Although LMO4 is frequently overexpressed in breast cancer and LMO4-overexpressing mice develop mammary epithelial tumors, the mechanisms involved are unknown. In this study, we report that LMO4 is a downstream target of ErbB2 and PI3K in ErbB2-dependent breast cancer cells. Furthermore, LMO4 silencing reduces proliferation of these cells, inducing a G2/M arrest that was associated with decreased cullin-3, an E3-ubiquitin ligase component important for mitosis. Loss of LMO4 subsequently results in reduced Cyclin D1 and Cyclin E. Further supporting a role for LMO4 in modulating proliferation by regulating cullin-3 expression, we found that LMO4 expression oscillates throughout the cell cycle with maximum expression occurring during G2/M and these changes precede oscillations in cullin-3 levels. LMO4 levels are also highest in high-grade/less differentiated breast cancers, which are characteristically highly proliferative. We conclude that LMO4 is a novel cell cycle regulator with a key role in mediating ErbB2-induced proliferation, a hallmark of ErbB2-positive disease."
https://openalex.org/W2115438873,"We have extensively investigated the mechanical properties of passive eye muscles, in vivo, in anesthetized and paralyzed monkeys. The complexity inherent in rheological measurements makes it desirable to present the results in terms of a mathematical model. Because Fung's quasi-linear viscoelastic (QLV) model has been particularly successful in capturing the viscoelastic properties of passive biological tissues, here we analyze this dataset within the framework of Fung's theory.We found that the basic properties assumed under the QLV theory (separability and superposition) are not typical of passive eye muscles. We show that some recent extensions of Fung's model can deal successfully with the lack of separability, but fail to reproduce the deviation from superposition.While appealing for their elegance, the QLV model and its descendants are not able to capture the complex mechanical properties of passive eye muscles. In particular, our measurements suggest that in a passive extraocular muscle the force does not depend on the entire length history, but to a great extent is only a function of the last elongation to which it has been subjected. It is currently unknown whether other passive biological tissues behave similarly."
https://openalex.org/W2150249391,"G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) have been extremely successful drug targets for a multitude of diseases from heart failure to depression. This superfamily of cell surface receptors have not, however, been widely considered as a viable target in cancer treatment. In this study we show that a classical G(q/11)-coupled GPCR, the M(3)-muscarinic receptor, was able to regulate apoptosis through receptors that are endogenously expressed in the human neuroblastoma cell line, SH-SY5Y, and when ectopically expressed in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. Stimulation of the M(3)-muscarinic receptor was shown to inhibit the ability of the DNA-damaging chemotherapeutic agent, etoposide, from mediating apoptosis. This protective response in CHO cells correlated with the ability of the receptor to regulate the expression levels of p53. In contrast, stimulation of endogenous muscarinic receptors in SH-SY5Y cells did not regulate p53 expression but rather was able to inhibit p53 translocation to the mitochondria and p53 phosphorylation at serine 15 and 37. This study suggests the possibility that a GPCR can regulate the apoptotic properties of a chemotherapeutic DNA-damaging agent by regulating the expression, subcellular trafficking and modification of p53 in a manner that is, in part, dependent on the cell type."
https://openalex.org/W2073844968,"The study of protein-protein interactions is becoming increasingly important for understanding the regulation of many cellular processes. The ability to quantify the strength with which two binding partners interact is desirable but the accurate determination of equilibrium binding constants is a difficult process. The use of Luminescence Resonance Energy Transfer (LRET) provides a homogeneous binding assay that can be used for the detection of protein-protein interactions. Previously, we developed an LRET assay to screen for small molecule inhibitors of the interaction of σ70 with theβ' coiled-coil fragment (amino acids 100–309). Here we describe an LRET binding assay used to monitor the interaction of E. coli σ70 and σ32 with core RNA polymerase along with the controls to verify the system. This approach generates fluorescently labeled proteins through the random labeling of lysine residues which enables the use of the LRET assay for proteins for which the creation of single cysteine mutants is not feasible. With the LRET binding assay, we are able to show that the interaction of σ70 with core RNAP is much more sensitive to NaCl than to potassium glutamate (KGlu), whereas the σ32 interaction with core RNAP is insensitive to both salts even at concentrations >500 mM. We also find that the interaction of σ32 with core RNAP is stronger than σ70 with core RNAP, under all conditions tested. This work establishes a consistent set of conditions for the comparison of the binding affinities of the E.coli sigma factors with core RNA polymerase. The examination of the importance of salt conditions in the binding of these proteins could have implications in both in vitro assay conditions and in vivo function."
https://openalex.org/W1978100445,"Removal of a small segment of tail at weaning is a common method used to obtain tissue for the isolation of genomic DNA to identify genetically modified mice. When genetically manipulated mice are used for pain research, this practice could result in confounding changes to the animals' responses to noxious stimuli. In this study, we sought to systematically investigate whether tail biopsy representative of that used in standard genotyping methods affects behavioral responses to a battery of tests of nociception. Wild-type littermate C57BL/6J and 129S6 female and male mice received either tail biopsies or control procedural handling at Day 21 after birth and were then tested at 6-9 weeks for mechanical and thermal sensitivity. C57BL/6J mice were also tested in the formalin model of inflammatory pain. In all tests performed (von Frey, Hargreaves, modified Randall Selitto, and formalin), C57BL/6J tail-biopsied animals' behavioral responses were not significantly different from control animals. In 129S6 animals, tail biopsy did not have a significant effect on behavioral responses in either sex to the von Frey and the modified Randall-Selitto tests of mechanical sensitivity. Interestingly, however, both sexes exhibited small but significant differences between tail biopsied and control responses to a radiant heat stimulus. These results indicate that tail biopsy for genotyping purposes has no effect on nocifensive behavioral responses of C57BL/6J mice, and in 129S6 mice, causes only a minor alteration in response to a radiant heat stimulus while other nocifensive behavioral responses are unchanged. The small effect seen is modality- and strain-specific."
https://openalex.org/W2041045781,"Fluid handling technology is acquiring an ever more prominent place in laboratory science whether it is in simple buffer exchange systems, perfusion chambers, or advanced microfluidic devices. Many of these applications remain the providence of laboratories at large institutions with a great deal of expertise and specialized equipment. Even with the expansion of these techniques, limitations remain that frequently prevent the coupling of controlled fluid flow with other technologies, such as coupling microfluidics and high-resolution position and force measurements by optical trapping microscopy.Here we present a method for fabrication of multiple-input laminar flow devices that are optically clear [glass] on each face, chemically inert, reusable, inexpensive, and can be fabricated on the benchtop in approximately one hour. Further these devices are designed to allow flow regulation by a simple gravity method thus requiring no specialized equipment to drive flow. Here we use these devices to perform total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy measurements as well as position sensitive optical trapping experiments.Flow chamber technology needs to be more accessible to the general scientific community. The method presented here is versatile and robust. These devices use standard slides and coverslips making them compatible with nearly all types and models of light microscopes. These devices meet the needs of groups doing advanced optical trapping experiments, but could also be adapted by nearly any lab that has a function for solution flow coupled with microscopy."
https://openalex.org/W2162511416,"A better understanding of the size and abundance of open reading frames (ORFS) in whole genomes may shed light on the factors that control genome complexity. Here we examine the statistical distributions of open reading frames (i.e. distribution of start and stop codons) in the fully sequenced genomes of 297 prokaryotes, and 14 eukaryotes.By fitting mixture models to data from whole genome sequences we show that the size-frequency distributions for ORFS are strikingly similar across prokaryotic and eukaryotic genomes. Moreover, we show that i) a large fraction (60-80%) of ORF size-frequency distributions can be predicted a priori with a stochastic assembly model based on GC content, and that (ii) size-frequency distributions of the remaining ""non-random"" ORFs are well-fitted by log-normal or gamma distributions, and similar to the size distributions of annotated proteins.Our findings suggest stochastic processes have played a primary role in the evolution of genome complexity, and that common processes govern the conservation and loss of functional genomics units in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes."
