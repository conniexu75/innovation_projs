https://openalex.org/W2129900561,"The long-standing rationalist tradition in moral psychology emphasizes the role of reason in moral judgment. A more recent trend places increased emphasis on emotion. Although both reason and emotion are likely to play important roles in moral judgment, relatively little is known about their neural correlates, the nature of their interaction, and the factors that modulate their respective behavioral influences in the context of moral judgment. In two functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies using moral dilemmas as probes, we apply the methods of cognitive neuroscience to the study of moral judgment. We argue that moral dilemmas vary systematically in the extent to which they engage emotional processing and that these variations in emotional engagement influence moral judgment. These results may shed light on some puzzling patterns in moral judgment observed by contemporary philosophers."

https://openalex.org/W2090530117,"Computer networks are inherently social networks, linking people, organizations, and knowledge. They are social institutions that should not be studied in isolation but as integrated into everyday lives. The proliferation of computer networks has facilitated a deemphasis on group solidarities at work and in the community and afforded a turn to networked societies that are loosely bounded and sparsely knit. The Internet increases people's social capital, increasing contact with friends and relatives who live nearby and far away. New tools must be developed to help people navigate and find knowledge in complex, fragmented, networked societies."

Co-regulated genes were grouped together and visualized in a three-dimensional expression map that displays correlations of gene expression profiles as distances in two dimensions and gene density in the third dimension. The gene expression map can be used as a gene discovery tool to identify genes that are co-regulated with known sets of genes (such as heat shock, growth control genes, germ line genes, and so forth) or to uncover previously unknown genetic functions (such as genomic instability in males and sperm caused by specific transposons)."
https://openalex.org/W2136545880,"We have identified a homolog of the mammalian p53 tumor suppressor protein in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans that is expressed ubiquitously in embryos. The gene encoding this protein, cep-1, promotes DNA damage-induced apoptosis and is required for normal meiotic chromosome segregation in the germ line. Moreover, although somatic apoptosis is unaffected, cep-1 mutants show hypersensitivity to hypoxia-induced lethality and decreased longevity in response to starvation-induced stress. Overexpression of CEP-1 promotes widespread caspase-independent cell death, demonstrating the critical importance of regulating p53 function at appropriate levels. These findings show that C. elegans p53 mediates multiple stress responses in the soma, and mediates apoptosis and meiotic chromosome segregation in the germ line."
https://openalex.org/W2085327127,Device-quality copper and nickel films were deposited onto planar and etched silicon substrates by the reduction of soluble organometallic compounds with hydrogen in a supercritical carbon dioxide solution. Exceptional step coverage on complex surfaces and complete filling of high-aspect-ratio features of less than 100 nanometers width were achieved. Nickel was deposited at 60°C by the reduction of bis(cyclopentadienyl)nickel and copper was deposited from either copper(I) or copper(II) compounds onto the native oxide of silicon or metal nitrides with seed layers at temperatures up to 200°C and directly on each surface at temperatures above 250°C. The latter approach provides a single-step means for achieving high-aspect-ratio feature fill necessary for copper interconnect structures in future generations of integrated circuits.

https://openalex.org/W2027817200,"One of the most common signatures of highly malignant tumors is their capacity to metabolize more glucose to lactic acid than their tissues of origin. Hepatomas exhibiting this phenotype are dependent on the high expression of type II hexokinase, which supplies such tumors with abundant amounts of glucose 6-phosphate, a significant carbon and energy source especially under hypoxic conditions. Here we report that the distal region of the hepatoma type II hexokinase promoter displays consensus motifs for hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF-1) that overlap E-box sequences known to be related in other gene promoters to glucose response. Moreover, we show that subjecting transfected hepatoma cells to hypoxic conditions activates the type II hexokinase promoter almost 3-fold, a value that approaches 7-fold in the presence of glucose. Consistent with these findings is the induction under hypoxic conditions of the HIF-1 protein. Reporter gene analyses with a series of nested deletion mutants of the hepatoma type II hexokinase promoter show that a significant fraction of the total activation observed under hypoxic conditions localizes to the distal region where the overlapping HIF-1/E-box sequences are located. Finally, DNase I footprint analysis with a segment of the promoter containing these elements reveals the binding of several nuclear proteins. In summary, these novel studies identify and characterize a marked glucose-modulated activation response of the type II hexokinase gene to hypoxic conditions within highly glycolytic hepatoma cells, a property that may help assure that such cells exhibit a growth and survival advantage over their parental cells of origin.

Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 3735-3739Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar, 7Bustamante E. Morris H.P. Pedersen P.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 8699-8704Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which catalyzes the first step in the glycolytic pathway, thus committing glucose to metabolism as glucose 6-phosphate. In rapidly growing hepatomas, it is type II hexokinase, a form that binds to the outer mitochondrial membrane, that is the predominant overexpressed isozyme (8Nakashima R. Paggi M.G. Scott L.J. Pedersen P.L. Cancer Res. 1988; 48: 913-919PubMed Google Scholar, 9Shinohara Y. Ichihara J. Terada H. FEBS Lett. 1991; 291: 55-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 10Mathupala S.P. Rempel A. Pedersen P.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16918-16925Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). In previous reports, we have described the isolation and characterization of the hepatoma type II hexokinase promoter and shown that it contains many apparent response elements (10Mathupala S.P. Rempel A. Pedersen P.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16918-16925Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 11Rempel A. Mathupala S.P. Griffin C.A. Hawkins A.L.

The most notable of these elements, from the point of view of glucose metabolism, are those for glucose, insulin, and cAMP, all of which activate the promoter in freshly isolated, transfected hepatoma cells (10Mathupala S.P. Rempel A. Pedersen P.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16918-16925Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 11Rempel A. Mathupala S.P. Griffin C.A. Hawkins A.L.

The promoter also contains response elements for the tumor suppressor p53, which, in mutated form, also activates the type II hexokinase promoter (13Mathupala S.P. Heese C. Pedersen P.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22776-22780Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). Although significant, the activation response obtained for each of these ligands or factors is modest ranging from approximately 1.5- to 3-fold in reporter gene assays where -fold activation is calculated relative to a physiological background containing pyruvate (10Mathupala S.P. Rempel A. Pedersen P.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16918-16925Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 12Rempel A. Mathupala S.P. Pedersen P.L.

Chem. 1997; 272: 22776-22780Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). Recently, our attention has turned to an investigation of the effects of hypoxic conditions on the hepatoma type II hexokinase promoter as such conditions are likely to be one of the greatest stresses experienced by cancer cells (14Graeber T.G. Osmanian C. Jacks T. Housman D.E. Koch C.J. Lowe S.W. Giaccia A.J. Nature. 1996; 379: 88-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (2171) Google Scholar, 15Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Nature. 1996; 379: 19-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Such conditions occur within the tumor interior as a result of rapid cell proliferation that outpaces the growth of oxygen-supplying blood vessels. This slows or incapacitates the oxygen-dependent mitochondrial ATP generating system and forces the glycolytic system to compensate for this loss in ATP production. As type II hexokinase catalyzes the first step of glycolysis in rapidly proliferating hepatomas, it seems reasonable to predict that its promoter is designed to elicit a robust activation response to hypoxic conditions. Significantly, in recent years a number of genes regulated by cellular oxygen concentration have been identified, including the hematopoietic factor erythropoietin, the angiogenesis mediator vascular endothelial growth factor, certain genes of the glycolytic pathway, and isoforms of the glucose transporter at the cell surface (reviewed in Refs. 16Semenza G.L. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1998; 8: 588-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (934) Google Scholar and17Semenza G.L. Respir. Res. 2000; 1: 159-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Central to this regulation is hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1),1 a heterodimeric protein (18Wang G.L. Semenza G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1230-1237Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1729) Google Scholar) that binds most frequently to the core sequence 5′-RCGTG-3′ (R = purine) (17Semenza G.L. Respir. Res. 2000; 1: 159-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar), but in some promoters also to the modified core sequence 5′-RCGTC-3′ (19Firth J.D. Ebert B.L. Pugh G.W. Ratcliffe P.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 6496-6500Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar). Once bound to a gene's promoter via these binding sites, HIF-1 exerts its effect on gene transcription by mechanisms that remain to be elucidated (17Semenza G.L. Respir. Res. 2000; 1: 159-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). With the above thoughts and information serving as a guide, we proceeded to identify HIF-1 binding sites on the hepatoma type II hexokinase promoter and to characterize in some detail the promoter's capacity to be regulated under hypoxic conditions. As predicted above and described in detail below, hypoxic stress significantly activates the promoter, a response that is further accentuated by physiological concentrations of glucose and correlates with the induction of HIF-1 expression. The pGL2-Basic luciferase reporter vector, the pSV-β-galactosidase control vector, and the luciferase assay system were from Promega. The TD-20e luminometer for chemiluminescence measurements and the portable anaerobic chamber were purchased from Turner Designs and Fisher, respectively. The cell porator (electroporator) for transfecting mammalian cells, restriction enzymes, DNA modifying enzymes, and an antibiotic-antimycotic mixture were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. The glucose-deficient RPMI 1640 tissue culture medium was from Sigma. The Maxi Prep plasmid purification system used to prepare plasmid DNA for transfections was from Qiagen, and the monoclonal antibody against the α subunit of HIF-1 (HIF-1α) was from Novus Biologicals. Polyvinylidene difluoride membranes were from Bio-Rad, and the ECL chemiluminescence system for detecting the antibody was from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech.[α-32P]dATP (3000 Ci/mmol) and [α-35S]dATP (1000 Ci/mmol) were from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. A gas mixture of 1% O2, 5% CO2, and 94% N2 was obtained from MG Industries. The 4.3-kbp proximal promoter of the type II hexokinase gene derived from AS-30D hepatoma cells was isolated, sequenced, and characterized as described in earlier reports from this laboratory (10Mathupala S.P. Rempel A. Pedersen P.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16918-16925Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 11Rempel A. Mathupala S.P. Griffin C.A. Hawkins A.L.

Pedersen P.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22776-22780Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). Female Sprague-Dawley rats were obtained from Charles River Laboratories. Their care and use in the experiments described below was approved by and conducted in accordance with the guidelines of the Johns Hopkins University Animal Care and Use Committee. The AS-30D hepatoma cell line, an established model cell line exhibiting a high glycolytic rate (6Bustamante E. Pedersen P.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 3735-3739Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar, 7Bustamante E. Morris H.P. Pedersen P.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 8699-8704Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), is routinely maintained and propagated in the laboratory of the corresponding author. AS-30D hepatoma cells were propagated in the peritoneal cavity of female Sprague-Dawley rats (100–150 g) and isolated as described previously using glucose-supplemented RPMI 1640 medium, in the absence of serum (8Nakashima R. Paggi M.G. Scott L.J. Pedersen P.L. Cancer Res. 1988; 48: 913-919PubMed Google Scholar). They were then resuspended at a final concentration of 50 × 106 cells ml−1 for transient transfection studies (10Mathupala S.P. Rempel A. Pedersen P.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16918-16925Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). To assess the levels of HIF-1 in AS-30D hepatoma cells, the cells were washed once in Dulbecco's modified phosphate-buffered saline (Ca2+- and Mg2+-free). Nuclear extracts were prepared from the washed cells as described below, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting using the HIF-1 antibody from Novus Biologicals, the reliability of which has been documented in recent reports (20Agani F.H. Pichiule P. Chavez J.C. LaManna J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35863-35867Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar, 21Gardner L. Li Q. Park M.S. Flanagan W.M. Semenza G.L. Dang C.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 7919-7926Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). For Western blotting, samples of nuclear extracts from AS-30D hepatoma cells were subjected to SDS-PAGE on 7.5% gels, which were then transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes in CAPS buffer (10 mm CAPS, 10% v/v methanol, pH 11). The membranes were probed with an anti-HIF-1α monoclonal antibody, according to the manufacturer's instructions, and detected by an ECL chemiluminescence system. Nuclear extracts were prepared according to the method of Dignam et al. (22Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9160) Google Scholar) from nuclei isolated from fresh AS-30D hepatoma cells and then stored at −80 °C until use. The preparation of the hepatoma type II hexokinase promoter-luciferase construct containing the full-length 4.3-kbp promoter for reporter gene analysis has been described in an earlier report from this laboratory (10Mathupala S.P. Rempel A. Pedersen P.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16918-16925Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). To generate reporter gene constructs containing nested deletion mutants, the parent plasmid construct was double digested at two restriction sites of the multiple cloning site of the pGL2 vector. KpnI (which creates an exonuclease III-resistant 3′ terminus at the multiple cloning site), andMluI (which creates an exonuclease III-sensitive restriction site within the multiple cloning site adjacent to the 5′ end of the cloned promoter) were used for the directional deletions into the cloned promoter. Nested deletions were generated at 30 °C using exonuclease III and nuclease S1 (23Ausubel F.M. Grant R. Kingston R. Moore R.E. Seiman D.D. Seiman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, CD–ROM Version 3.7. (5b). Greene Publishing Associates/Wiley Interscience, New York1994Google Scholar, 24Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar), at a reaction concentration of 150 units of exonuclease III/pmol of susceptible 3′ ends. Aliquots of plasmid DNA were recovered at 1-min intervals, placed on ice until after addition of EDTA to quench the reaction, extracted with phenol/chloroform, and then precipitated with ethanol. The plasmids were then recircularized with T4 DNA ligase. Mutants with 1-kilobase deletions in the promoter were selected by agarose gel electrophoresis. After the residual length of the promoter inserts was confirmed by DNA sequencing, they were transformed into Escherichia coli SURE cells for maintenance. These were then transformed into methylation-deficient E. coli SCS 110 cells, and plasmids subsequently prepared from these cells were used for reporter gene analysis. Transient transfection conditions for the full-length hexokinase promoter-luciferase construct and the β-galactosidase control vector have been reported previously (10Mathupala S.P. Rempel A. Pedersen P.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16918-16925Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). The same transfection conditions were used in this study for these constructs and also for the constructs containing the nested deletion mutants. Briefly, equimolar concentrations of reporter gene vector DNA (equivalent to 10 μg of the 4.3-kbp full-length promoter-luciferase reporter gene construct) were maintained during transfections with the nested deletion mutant constructs (i.e. 8.7, 7.8, 6.8, 5.9, and 5.7 μg, respectively, of 3-, 2-, 1-, 0.1-, and 0-kbp promoter containing nested deletion mutant plasmids). The β-galactosidase vector (2.5 μg) was used as a control in all transfections, where 25 × 106 hepatoma cells (in 0.5 ml) were used per transfection. The cells and reporter gene constructs were incubated on ice for 10 min and electroporated at 200 V, 800 microfarads. After an additional 10-min recovery period on ice, the transfected AS-30D hepatoma cells were plated into 10 ml of RPMI 1640 glucose-deficient medium supplemented with 2 mm glutamine, 1 mmpyruvate, 25 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), and an antibiotic-antimycotic mixture. For studies in the presence of glucose, the medium was supplemented with 5 mm glucose. For optimal results under normoxic conditions, incubation of cells was carried out at 37 °C in 5% CO2 and 95% atmospheric air for 24 h. The cells were then subjected to lysis using a cold buffer containing 0.6% Triton X-l00, 0.1 m potassium phosphate, and 1 mm DTT, pH 7.8 (25Showe M. Williams P. Showe L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 3153-3157Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Finally, aliquots (10 and 50 μl) were used to assay luciferase and β-galactosidase activity, respectively. To expose transfected cells to hypoxia, parallel sets of 100-mm tissue culture dishes containing 25 × 106 transfected cells/plate were placed in a portable anaerobic chamber. This was sealed and flushed with an “anaerobic” gas mixture of 1% O2, 5% CO2, 94% N2 for 2 min, followed by five successive evacuations (at low vacuum, ∼1–2 p.s.i.) and re-pressurization (with the same gas mixture at ∼1–2 p.s.i.) steps. The chamber was finally flushed again with the anaerobic gas mixture, the evacuation/pressurization ports sealed, and transferred to a 37 °C incubator. For optimal results, cells were recovered 12–16 h after transfection, washed once in 10 ml of Dulbecco's modified phosphate-buffered saline (Ca2+- and Mg2+-deficient), and lysed in 100 μl of cold lysis buffer (0.625% Triton X-100, 0.1 m potassium phosphate, 1 mm DTT, pH 7.8). Aliquots (10 and 50 μl) were then assayed for luciferase and β-galactosidase activities, respectively. These enzyme assays were carried out essentially as described by the suppliers of the reporter gene vectors (Promega). Luciferase activity (A) was measured by luminometry using a Turner TD-20e luminometer and recorded as relative light units. The system contained 10 μl of cell lysate and l00 μl of a mixture containing 470 μm luciferin, 530 μm ATP, 270 μm CoA, 2.67 mm MgSO4, 1.07 mm (MgCO3)4Mg(OH)2·5H2O, 33 mm DTT, and 0.1m EDTA, pH 7.8, 25 °C. β-Galactosidase activity (B) was measured using a PerkinElmer Life Sciences Lambda 3B spectrophotometer and recorded as the absorbance at 420 nm. The system contained 50 μl of cell lysate, 100 μl of water, and 150 μl of 2× β-galactosidase assay reagent (1.33 mg/mlO-nitrophenyl-β-d-galactopyranoside, 120 mm Na2HPO4, 80 mmNaH2PO4, 2 mm MgCl2, 100 mm β-mercaptoethanol, pH 7.4). The mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 8 h and then quenched on ice, centrifuged, and the supernatant assayed for β-galactosidase activity. Values A/B that normalized the various transfections were then obtained. In these experiments, endogenous β-galactosidase activity, i.e. the activity in nontransfected AS-30D cells, was found in control experiments to be no more than 1/20 that of experimental values obtained for transfected cells. -Fold activations were calculated by dividing the normalized values (A/B) obtained for the 4.3-kbp promoter, or nested deletion mutants therefrom (in the presence of glucose alone, hypoxia alone, or glucose + hypoxia) by normalized values obtained using pyruvate-containing post-transfection medium in the absence of these additions (glucose or hypoxic conditions). Each experiment was carried out multiple times and mean values reported. DNase I footprint assays were adapted from methods by Kingston (26Kingston, R. E. (1994) Current Protocols in Molecular Biology (Ausubel, F. M., Brent, R., Kingston, R. E., Moore, D. D., Seiman, J. G., Smith, J.

DNA binding reactions were performed in 35 μl of binding buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 5 mm DTT, 1 mm MgCl2, 60 mm KCl) with 2 ng (≅2 × 105 cpm) of DNA template end-labeled by Klenow fill-in reactions (23Ausubel F.M.

Reactions were incubated for 20 min on ice, followed by a 60-s digestion at 25 °C with 0.3–5 μl of a freshly diluted DNase I solution (0.05 μg/μl). The digestion reactions were stopped by the addition of 100 μl of stop buffer (1% SDS, 20 mm EDTA, 200 mm NaCl, 250 μg/ml yeast tRNA). The sample was extracted with phenol-chloroform and precipitated with two volumes of ethanol. The DNA pellets were dried and resuspended in loading buffer (99% formamide, 0.05% bromphenol blue, 0.05% xylene cyanol), incubated 5 min at 68 °C, and loaded on a 6% polyacrylamide, 8.3m urea, sequencing gel. The gels were subjected to electrophoresis in 1× Tris borate-EDTA, dried, and then subjected to autoradiography for 1–6 h prior to film development. In an earlier report (10Mathupala S.P. Rempel A. Pedersen P.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16918-16925Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar), we presented the sequence of the 4.3-kbp proximal promoter region of the hepatoma type II hexokinase gene, (GenBankTM accession number U19605), identified an E-box (CACGTG) in the distal region (Fig.1 A), and demonstrated using reporter gene analysis that the promoter undergoes a modest activation response (2–3-fold) in the presence of a high concentration of glucose (25 mm). Results presented in Fig. 1 B summarize the results of further analyses of the distal region from −3620 to −3919 kbp for HIF-1 motifs (5′-RCGTG-3′ or 5′-RCGTC-3′). Significantly, both visual inspection and the use of a computer algorithm (Signal-Scan; Ref. 30Prestridge D.S. Comput. Appl. Biosci. 1991; 7: 203-206PubMed Google Scholar) revealed the presence of one HIF-1 motif (5′-RCGTG-3′) overlapping the previously identified E-box (CACGTG), and a second HIF-1 motif (5′-RCGTC-3′) about 50 base pairs upstream overlapping a sequence (CACGTC) with 83% identity to the E-box. The identification of two overlapping E-box/HIF-1 sequences within the distal region of the type II hexokinase promoter raised the possibility that this promoter may be responsive to hypoxic conditions by a process that is modulated by glucose. To test this possibility, AS-30D hepatoma cells freshly isolated from the host animals were transfected with a full-length type II hexokinase promoter-luciferase reporter gene construct and exposed in standard medium in separate experiments to three sets of conditions: hypoxia alone (1% O2, 5% CO2, 94% N2), normoxia alone (5 mm glucose, 5% CO2, 95% atmospheric air), and hypoxia plus glucose. As shown in Fig.1 C, hypoxic conditions alone activate the promoter almost 3-fold relative to that observed in the presence of a pyruvate containing “background” medium. However, in the presence of hypoxic conditions plus glucose, the latter of which activates the promoter only about 2-fold, the total activation response approaches 7-fold, a value considerably higher than that expected (approximately 5-fold) had the hypoxia + glucose responses been additive. Moreover, this was a reproducible observation in experiments conducted with AS-30D hepatoma cells from different animals. Thus, these results provide evidence that the hepatoma type II hexokinase promoter is activated by hypoxic conditions in hepatoma cells, and that this response is positively modulated in the presence of a concentration of glucose (5 mm) within the physiological range. The experiments described above showing that the AS-30D hepatoma type II hexokinase promoter is activated by hypoxic conditions in cells freshly isolated from the host animal implicate the presence of the HIF-I protein. This was confirmed by subjecting nuclear extracts from these cells first to SDS-PAGE (Fig.2 A, left lanes 1and 2) and then to Western blot analysis using an HIF-1α subunit antibody (Fig. 2 A, right lanes 1 and2). Subsequent experiments carried out by subjecting AS-30D hepatoma cells in tissue culture to normoxic, hypoxic, or hypoxic plus glucose conditions confirmed that HIF-1α subunit levels in these cells are very dependent on oxygen concentration (Fig. 2 B). Thus, cells maintained under normoxic conditions expressed much less HIF-1α subunit than cells maintained under hypoxic conditions (Fig.2 B, lower panel, compare lanes 1 and 2 with lanes 3 and 4). Glucose was without effect on the protein expression levels of the HIF-1α subunit under the same conditions (Fig. 2 B,lower panel, compare lane 3 withlane 4). In all of these experiments, the apparent molecular mass of the expressed HIF-1α subunit was about l00 kDa: a value that correlates closely to that of the calculated value of 93.3 kDa (GenBank™ accession no. Y09507). Taken together with the experiments described above, these results implicate the HIF-1α subunit as acting within the distal region of the type II hexokinase promoter and participating, at least in part, in the promoter's activation response to hypoxic conditions. These results also indicate that the role of glucose in enhancing the promoter's activation response to hypoxic conditions (Fig.1 C) is not the result of an effect on HIF-1α subunit expression. A plasmid constructed for luciferase reporter gene analysis using the full-length promoter (Fig. 3 A) formed the basis for the deletion analysis study to functionally locate the primary regions within the promoter that are responsive to hypoxia. As described in detail under “Methods,” a series of nested deletion mutants (plasmids B–F) that maintained ∼1-kbp deletions at the 5′ terminus (Fig. 3 B) were selected from the larger pool of deletion mutants generated. During transfection assays with the selected nested deletion mutants, equimolar concentrations of reporter gene vectors equivalent to 10 μg of the 4.3-kbp full-length promoter-luciferase reporter gene construct (plasmid A) were maintained together with β-galactosidase control vector at concentrations indicated under “Methods.” Analysis of these clones by reporter gene analysis under these conditions enabled us to identify the distal 1 kbp of the hepatoma type II hexokinase promoter as a significant contributor to its response to hypoxic conditions in the presence of a physiological concentration (5 mm) of glucose (Fig. 3 C). This region of the promoter also contributes in part to the total glucose response. In both cases, the remaining part of the total hypoxic response and the total glucose response appears to localize to the proximal region of the type II hexokinase promoter, as plasmid F lacking the TATA region shows almost negligible responses to hypoxia and glucose in reporter gene analysis. Nuclear extracts prepared from AS-30D hepatoma cells freshly isolated from the host animal were used in DNase I footprint analysis of the distal region of the type II hexokinase promoter containing the two overlapping E-box/HIF-1 sequences. Significantly, as shown in Fig.4 A, these two sequences were found to be protected, indicating that nuclear proteins (potential transcription factors) are present in this hepatoma cell line that bind at these sites. In addition, results of the DNase I footprint analysis revealed that four other sequences near the two overlapping E-box/HIF-1 sequences also bind nuclear factors. Of these, one is a potential Sp1 element (5′-GTGCAC-3′) that overlaps one of the two overlapping E-box/HIF-1 sequences, whereas two others are identified as potential C/EBP and GATA-1 response elements (Fig. 4 B). The fourth protected sequence has no specific identification at present. These data are consistent with the results presented earlier in this report and add additional support for the view that the E-box/HIF-l overlapping sequences located in the distal region of the hepatoma type II hexokinase promoter play a role in this promoter's response to hypoxia and glucose. Results of experiments reported here provide new insights into the mode of regulation of the gene encoding hepatoma type II hexokinase, the predominant hexokinase isoform expressed in poorly differentiated, rapidly growing hepatomas exhibiting the high glucose catabolic phenotype (6Bustamante E. Pedersen P.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 3735-3739Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar, 7Bustamante E. Morris H.P. Pedersen P.L. J. Biol.

Specifically, we have shown that the promoter for this enzyme contains in its distal region two overlapping E-box/HIF-1 sequences separated by about 50 base pairs (Fig. 1 B) that are known to be associated in other gene promoters (16Semenza G.L. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1998; 8: 588-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (934) Google Scholar, 17Semenza G.L. Respir. Res. 2000; 1: 159-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 18Wang G.L. Semenza G.L.

Chem. 2000; 275: 31555-31558Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar) with responsiveness to glucose (E-box) or hypoxic conditions (HIF-1). In addition, we have shown that activation of the type II hexokinase gene promoter in transfected hepatoma cells, freshly isolated from the host animal, approaches 7-fold in the presence of hypoxic conditions and a physiological concentration (5 mm) of glucose (Figs.1 C and 3 C). Significantly, this is the highest activation response we have observed to date for this promoter. Correlating well with these observations are the following three additional findings reported here. (a) Nuclear extracts from hepatoma cells freshly isolated from the host animal express the HIF-1α subunit protein (Fig. 2 A); (b) expression of this protein within these cells can be regulated by oxygen concentration (Fig. 2 B); and (c) protein factors within the same nuclear hepatoma extracts bind to the overlapping E-box/HIF-1 sequences located within the distal region of the type II hexokinase promoter (Fig. 4). Finally, results presented here show also that the response of the type II hexokinase gene promoter to both glucose and hypoxic conditions is not confined to its distal region, but involves significantly the proximal region as well (Fig. 3 C). Elements in this region remain to be identified and studied in detail. Here we have built on preliminary data reported by us previously (31Mathupala S.P. Rempel A. Pedersen P.L. FASEB J. 1996; 10: A1514Google Scholar) and characterized the molecular interactions and their induction under hypoxia in detail. Consistent with this latter finding is the recent result reported by others (32Riddle S.R. Ahmad A. Ahmad S. Deeb S.S. Malkki M. Schneider B.K. Allen C.B. White C.W. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 278: L407-L416Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) that, in the A549 human lung cell line, the proximal region of the type II hexokinase promoter also contributes significantly to hexokinase expression under hypoxic conditions. The apparent synergism between glucose and hypoxic conditions reported here in activating hepatoma type II hexokinase gene expression has, to our knowledge, not been observed previously for a tumor-associated metabolic gene and deserves further investigation, particularly as it relates to biosynthetic enzymes involved in the rapid production of cell building blocks during tumorigenesis. Thus, for cancer cells to survive within a tumor that is proliferating faster than its vascular system, they must be able to thrive in a hypoxic environment and, in so doing, must not only utilize glucose as the major or sole energy source, but as a major carbon source for biosynthesis as well. Therefore, when faced with such a life or death situation, tumor cells subjected to hypoxic conditions may rely not only on glucose + hypoxic response elements within the promoters of their key glycolytic genes, but in the promoters of their biosynthesis-related genes as well. The results of studies reported here may be relevant also to tumor metastasis. As indicated in earlier reports (14Graeber T.G. Osmanian C. Jacks T. Housman D.E. Koch C.J. Lowe S.W. Giaccia A.J. Nature. 1996; 379: 88-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (2171) Google Scholar, 15Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Nature. 1996; 379: 19-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar), tumor cells subjected to hypoxic stress may acquire additional mutations in tumor suppressor genes like p53 leading to the development of a clonal population of more aggressive cancer cells with the capacity to metastasize and ultimately kill the host (14Graeber T.G.

Nature. 1996; 379: 19-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). If such events are found to contribute significantly to tumor metastasis, it seems likely that the gene encoding type II hexokinase that can be markedly activated by hypoxic conditions in the presence of glucose will be involved.

Concerns have been raised, however, that the limits of silicon technology may soon be reached. Analysis of fundamental, material, device, circuit, and system limits reveals that silicon technology has an enormous remaining potential to achieve terascale integration (TSI) of more than 1 trillion transistors per chip. Such massive-scale integration is feasible assuming the development and economical mass production of double-gate metal-oxide-semiconductor field effect transistors with gate oxide thickness of about 1 nanometer, silicon channel thickness of about 3 nanometers, and channel length of about 10 nanometers. The development of interconnecting wires for these transistors presents a major challenge to the achievement of nanoelectronics for TSI."

These findings contribute to a global assessment of the biogeography of chemosynthetic faunas and indicate that the Indian Ocean vent community follows asymmetric assembly rules biased toward Pacific evolutionary alliances."

https://openalex.org/W2103618523,"The peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) are a family of fatty acid-activated transcription factors which control lipid homeostasis and cellular differentiation. PPARα (NR1C1) controls lipid oxidation and clearance in hepatocytes and PPARγ (NR1C3) promotes preadipocyte differentiation and lipogenesis. Drugs that activate PPARα are effective in lowering plasma levels of lipids and have been used in the management of hyperlipidemia. PPARγ agonists increase insulin sensitivity and are used in the management of type 2 diabetes. In contrast, there are no marketed drugs that selectively target PPARδ (NR1C2) and the physiological roles of PPARδ are unclear. In this report we demonstrate that the expression of PPARδ is increased during the differentiation of human macrophages in vitro. In addition, a highly selective agonist of PPARδ (compound F) promotes lipid accumulation in primary human macrophages and in macrophages derived from the human monocytic cell line, THP-1. Compound F increases the expression of genes involved in lipid uptake and storage such as the class A and B scavenger receptors (SRA, CD36) and adipophilin. PPARδ activation also represses key genes involved in lipid metabolism and efflux, i.e.cholesterol 27-hydroxylase and apolipoprotein E. We have generated THP-1 sublines that overexpress PPARδ and have confirmed that PPARδ is a powerful promoter of macrophage lipid accumulation.

Desvergne B. Wahli W. Nature. 2000; 405: 421-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (1636) Google Scholar). They are members of the nuclear receptor family and form obligate heterodimers with the retinoid X receptor (2Kliewer S.A. Umesono K. Noonan D.J. Heyman R.A. Evans R.M.

PPARα1 is highly expressed in the rodent liver, where its activation up-regulates β-oxidation and thus promotes lipid clearance. PPARα agonists, such as the fibrates, are effective lipid-lowering drugs. PPARγ, which is activated by 15 deoxy-Δ12,14PGJ2 and the thiazolidinedione class of insulin-sensitizing drugs, is expressed particularly in adipose tissue, where it initiates the differentiation cascade (3Tontonoz P.

Among its known target genes are adipocyte fatty acid-binding protein and fatty acid synthase, which are effectors of lipid accumulation during adipogenesis. PPARγ has also been studied for its role in the formation of the atherosclerotic plaque, a lesion consisting of an accumulation of lipid-laden macrophages within the intima of the arterial wall. These studies started with the observation that PPARγ up-regulates CD36 (scavenger receptor-class B) expression in macrophages. This facilitates uptake of modified plasma low density lipoproteins into the macrophages potentially leading to the formation of foam cells (5Nagy L. Tontonoz P. Alvarez J.G. Chen H. Evans R.M.

However, plaque formation is also appreciated to be an inflammatory response and it has been shown that activators of PPARγ inhibit the production of inflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin-6 and interleukin-1β (7Chawla A.

ABCA1 is a member of the ATP-binding cassette transporter family and it is involved in the control of the apoA1-mediated cholesterol efflux from macrophages and other peripheral lipid stores. Mutations in this protein occur in patients with Tangiers disease, a syndrome that is characterized by the pathological accumulation of cholesterol esters in many tissues. Up-regulation of ABCA1 may promote cholesterol clearance, and overall, PPARγ appears to be a negative regulator of cholesterol accumulation (16Moore K.J. Rosen E.D. Fitzgerald M.L. Randow F.

PPARδ, also known as PPARβ, NUC1, and FAAR, has been shown to be expressed in a wide range of tissues, but progress in understanding the function of this protein has been hampered by the lack of selective ligands. PPARδ has recently been implicated in a wide range of physiological and pathophysiological processes such as embryonic implantation, wound healing, inflammation, cancer, and osteoporosis (23Lim H.

In this report, we show that PPARδ mRNA and protein levels are dramatically elevated during macrophage differentiation and provide both genetic and pharmacological evidence that PPARδ is a positive effector of lipid accumulation in human macrophage cultures. We also show that PPARδ coordinates a complex pattern of gene expression controlling lipid uptake, transport, storage, metabolism, and efflux. Human monocytes were isolated from buffy coat preparations of whole blood taken from healthy volunteers. In brief, the buffy coat was mixed with OptiprepTM (Robbins Scientific Ltd.) in a ratio of 2.5:1 and then overlaid with a discontinuous OptiprepTM gradient, prepared according to the reagent datasheet. Following centrifugation for 25 min at 600 × g the monocyte layer formed within the top 5–10 ml of the gradient was removed, washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and resuspended in RPMI 1640, supplemented with 2 mm glutamine and 10% human serum (Sigma). Cell viability was assessed by the ability to exclude trypan blue and was typically 95%. Monocyte purity was determined by differential counts of DiffQuik (Porvair Sciences Ltd.) stained cell preparations and was typically >95%. For monocyte-macrophage differentiation, monocytes isolated as above were resuspended in culture medium at a density of 2.5 × 106/ml and seeded into 12-well tissue culture plates; medium was changed every 48 h. LDL, oxidized LDL, and lipid-depleted serum was obtained from Intracel Corporation. COS-1 cells were transfected by a DEAE-dextran method as previously described (30Cullen B.R. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 152: 692-693Google Scholar). The reporter construct pFABPLUC contains 4 copies of the peroxisome proliferator response element from the human liver FABP gene in front of the herpes simplex virus-thymidine kinase promoter, cloned immediately upstream of the cDNA encoding firefly luciferase in pGLBAS (Promega). The PPAR expression vectors contained the coding sequence for human PPARα, -δ, and -γ under the control of the enhancer/promoter of the human cytomegalovirus. PSVβGal was co-transfected with each sample to act as an internal control for transfection. Cell lysates were prepared and luciferase and β-galactosidase activities were assayed using kits as described by the manufacturer (Promega). Data are presented as the relative light units obtained with the luciferase assay divided by the absorbance obtained at 405 nm in the β-galactosidase assays (Luc/β-galactosidase). THP-1 cells were obtained from ATCC. Cultures were grown in RPMI supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum. Differentiation was initiated by the addition of 5 ng/ml PMA in the above medium. All drugs were added in Me2SO and were replaced at intervals of 48 h. After 4 days the cells were fixed with 0.66% paraformaldehyde then stained with Oil red O (Sigma) and hematoxylin (Sigma). Quantification of lipid accumulation was achieved by extracting Oil red O from stained cells with isopropyl alcohol and measuring the optical density of the extract at 510 nm. The value obtained using a control culture was subtracted from the resulting values. The Oil red O absorbance was corrected by co-staining DNA with SYBR green dye (Molecular Probes) and quantified on a Labsystems FluoroSkan Ascent FL microplate fluorimeter. Cell number was determined from a standard curve. The entire coding sequence of human PPARδ was subcloned, in both sense and antisense orientations, into the eukaryotic expression vector pCLDN (31Brighty D.W. Rosenberg M. Chen I.S. Ivey-Hoyle M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 7802-7805Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The resulting plasmids were transfected into THP-1 cells using a modified DEAE-dextran procedure (32Wu H. Moulton K. Horvai A. Parik S. Glass C.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2129-2139Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The cells were maintained in medium containing 1 mg/ml G418 and 10% THP-1 conditioned medium, with rigorous washing procedures to remove dead cells. This was continued until cell killing stopped and robust growth was observed. We obtained six independently transfected polyclonal populations each of pCLDN (empty vector) and pCLDNPPARδ (SENSE). Cultures were lysed in SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis loading buffer and analyzed by Western blotting using standard procedures. The PPARδ antiserum (obtained from Dr. David Bell) was used at a 1:2000 dilution and the anti-AFAR antiserum (obtained from Dr. John Hayes) was used at a 1:3000 dilution. A peroxidase-conjugated mouse anti-rabbit IgG antiserum (Sigma) was used as a secondary detection reagent at 1:3000 and the results were visualized using enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL+) as described by the manufacturer (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Cultures were treated as above and then extracted with methanol/chloroform/phosphate-buffered saline (1:1:1, v/v) containing stigmasterol as an internal standard for cholesterol. The organic phase was analyzed for cholesterol with and without saponification by GC-MS using a Finnegan ThermoQuest Trace 2000. Triglycerides were quantified colorimetrically using a kit from Sigma and triolein as a standard. Protein concentrations were determined using the Bio-Rad Protein assay reagent. THP-1 cells were differentiated with PMA in the absence or presence of 100 nm compound F for 3 days. PPARδ SENSE cells were differentiated with PMA for 3 days. The cells were labeled with 2 μCi (40 nmol) of [4-14C]cholesterol (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in 2 ml of medium containing 10% fetal calf serum for 3 h. ApoA1 specific efflux was determined as previously described (33Oliver Jr., W.R. Shenk J.L. Snaith M.R. Russell C.S. Plunket K.D. Bodkin N.L. Lewis M.C. Winegar D.A. Sznaidman M.L. Lambert M.H.

For apoA1 independent efflux assays the cells were incubated a further 120 h in medium containing 10% fetal calf serum. Radioactivity release into the medium was determined by scintillation counting at 1, 4, 18, 24, 48, 72, and 120 h. All cultures incorporated similar levels (between 80 and 95%) of the labeled cholesterol. Cell viability was similar between cultures using this procedure. RNA was extracted from THP-1 cells using TRIZOL reagent as recommended by the manufacturer. cDNA was synthesized from such RNA using “You-Prime Ready-To-Go” beads from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. TAQMANTM real time PCR analysis was applied using prepared reagents from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. The primers and probes will be described elsewhere. 2L. Patel and C. Macphee, manuscript in preparation. Relative levels of mRNA were calculated using the values obtained with each target gene compared with the values obtained with the 18 S ribosomal RNA probes. All graphs and statistics were prepared using Graphpad Prism for the Macintosh v3.0 (Graphpad Inc., San Diego, CA). Nonlinear regression was applied using a sigmoidal response model for the dose response to compound F in transient transfection experiments (Fig. 3). p values displayed in Figs. 7, B and C, and 8 E were calculated using a standard Student's t test.Figure 7Cholesterol efflux is modulated selectively by PPAR δ. PMA-differentiated THP-1 cells were treated with increasing concentrations of compound F (CF) or 500 nm rosiglitazone (Ros) for 48 h and analyzed for cholesterol 27-hydroxylase (A) and apolipoprotein E (C) mRNA levels by TAQMANTM procedures. PMA-differentiated THP-1 and PPARδSENSE cells were analyzed for cholesterol 27-hydroxylase (B) and apolipoprotein E (D) mRNA levels by TAQMANTM procedures.

We confirmed previous observations that PPARγ protein levels are increased during this process (5Nagy L. Tontonoz P. Alvarez J.G. Chen H. Evans R.M.

Interestingly, we also found that PPARδ levels are markedly increased during macrophage differentiation. PPARα protein was also detectable, but was not greatly altered during differentiation. This pattern of regulation was confirmed at the mRNA level (Fig. 1 B). We then examined the effect of rosiglitazone, a highly selective PPARγ agonist, on the accumulation of lipid in primary human macrophages under normal culture conditions (10% human serum) (Fig. 2, A versus B). We observed that rosiglitazone (1 μm) partially inhibited the accumulation of lipid under such conditions. We also found that rosiglitazone did not stimulate lipid accumulation in primary macrophages in lipid-depleted serum alone, or supplemented with 100 μg/ml normal or oxidized low density lipoproteins (Fig. 2 C, nLDL and oxLDL, respectively). In view of the marked induction of PPARδ during human macrophage differentiation, we investigated whether it may be a regulatory factor in the process of lipid accumulation. Investigations into the role of PPARδ in lipid metabolism have been hampered by the lack of PPAR selective agonists. A series of compounds has recently been described as having selectivity for PPARδ (33Oliver Jr., W.R. Shenk J.L. Snaith M.R. Russell C.S. Plunket K.D. Bodkin N.L. Lewis M.C. Winegar D.A. Sznaidman M.L. Lambert M.H. Xu H.E. Sternbach D.D. Kliewer S.A. Hansen B.C. Willson T.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 5306-5311Crossref PubMed Scopus (956) Google Scholar, 34Leibowitz, M. D., Berger, J. P., Moller, D. E., Auwerx, J., and Berger, G. D. (1997) Compound F. International Patent Publication No. WO 97/28149.Google Scholar), and we have synthesized one of these compounds (compound F) that has an EC50 of 2 nm for hPPARδ, 400 nmfor hPPARγ, and >1 μm for hPPARα (Fig.3 A). Interestingly, this compound has no selectivity between mouse PPARγ and -δ (data not shown). Human macrophages were therefore treated with compound F (100 nm) in the presence of serum, resulting in a profound increase in lipid accumulation (Fig. 3 B). The formation of foam cells is thought to be promoted by modified lipoproteins in vivo. We therefore tested the ability of compound F to facilitate lipid accumulation in the presence of oxidized LDL (Fig.3 C). Oxidized LDL is a stimulus for lipid accumulation in human macrophages and addition of increasing concentrations of compound F stimulates further increases in lipid accumulation. The dose response of this lipid accumulation was very similar to the concentrations required for activation of PPARδ in COS-1 cells and occurred at concentrations well below those required for the activation of PPARγ and -α. Importantly, lipid loading was not observed with normal LDL or lipid-depleted serum at any concentration of compound F (data not shown). This demonstrates that the action of compound F is dependent on the nature and availability of the lipid donors in the culture medium. To obtain further evidence that PPARδ is involved in macrophage lipid accumulation we utilized a cell line model where the levels of PPARδ could be modulated genetically. The human monocytic cell line, THP-1, can be differentiated into adherent macrophage-like cells by the addition of phorbol ester to the culture medium. Measurement of PPAR mRNA levels following phorbol ester treatment showed that PPARα expression remained unchanged during differentiation (Fig. 4 A). The levels of both PPARγ and -δ mRNA were greatly increased upon differentiation (50- and 34-fold, respectively). These findings are similar to those obtained during the differentiation of primary macrophages (Fig. 1). To determine whether the PPARs were involved in lipid accumulation, THP-1 cells were treated with activators of PPARα, -γ, and -δ in the presence of serum. No change in lipid accumulation was observed on the addition of the PPARα activator, Wy14,643, or the PPARγ activator, rosiglitazone (Fig. 4 B). However, when THP-1 cells were treated with compound F, a marked increase in intracellular lipid was observed (Fig. 4 B). The EC50 of compound F for this effect was higher than that observed for the primary monocytes (∼400 nm, Fig.4 C). The effect of compound F was further enhanced by the addition of the RXR agonist, LG100268 (Fig. 4 D); further supporting the action of a PPAR/RXR heterodimer in this process. There was a high degree of similarity in the findings with those obtained in primary macrophages indicating that THP-1 cells provide a good model for studying the role of PPARδ in macrophage lipid accumulation. The lipid accumulation phenotype observed with compound F may reflect regulation of a number of aspects of lipid transport and metabolism in these cells. Recent studies have shown that rosiglitazone modulates lipid uptake by transcriptional regulation of the class B scavenger receptor CD36, but that this is balanced by increases in efflux via ABCA1 and decreases in the class A scavenger receptor, SRA (16Moore K.J. Rosen E.D. Fitzgerald M.L. Randow F. Andersson L.P. Altshuler D. Milstone D.S. Mortensen R.M. Spiegelman B.M. Freeman M.W. Nat. Med. 2001; 7: 41-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar). We therefore investigated the effects of compound F on the expression of a range of genes known to determine lipid balance in macrophages. We performed a dose-response experiment with PPARδ selective concentrations of compound F and compared these treatments to a saturating dose of rosiglitazone (500 nm) (Fig.5 A). We observed that CD36 is effectively induced (6-fold) by 10 nm compound F, and that this induction is greater than that seen with 500 nmrosiglitazone (2–3-fold). This suggests that CD36 is a target gene for both PPARδ and PPARγ. The class A scavenger receptor was also slightly increased by 10 nm compound F (2.5-fold), whereas rosiglitazone does not modify the expression of this gene. The gene encoding the adipose-type fatty acid-binding protein (AFABP) is highly regulated by both rosiglitazone and 10 nm compound F, again showing an overlapping set of target genes. However, the gene encoding the lipid-vesicle coat protein, adipophilin is very selectively regulated by compound F (10-fold versus 3-fold with rosiglitazone). The selectivity for activation of SRA, CD36, and adipophilin was confirmed in a time course study (Fig. 5 B) where it was clear that compound F mediates a larger and more sustained induction of these gene products relative to rosiglitazone. The induction of SRA was very modest but sustained, in contrast no significant induction with rosiglitazone was seen at any time point. CD36 induction by compound F appeared to be diminished at longer time points but adipophilin was highly induced throughout the experiment. To obtain evidence for a direct role for PPARδ in macrophage lipid accumulation, we generated THP-1 sublines that overexpressed PPARδ (PPARδSENSE). Constitutive expression of PPARδ in the PPARδSENSE cells was confirmed by Western blotting (Fig. 6 A). In agreement with the effects of the PPARδ agonist, PPARδ SENSE cell lines were extremely lipid-laden when compared with the wild type cells, even in the absence of added PPAR ligand (but in the presence of serum) (Fig.6 B). This response is very rapid with very obviously lipid-laden cells appearing 3 days after differentiation, whereas compound F promotes lipid accumulation much more slowly, only becoming visible after 7 to 10 days of treatment (data not shown). We used gas chromatography/mass spectrophotometry to measure the levels of free and esterified cholesterol present in THP-1 cells differentiated with PMA with and without compound F (100 nm), and in differentiated PPARδSENSE cells (Fig. 6 C). We found that compound F treatment resulted in a 50% increase in cholesterol esters compared with the untreated cells, however, the levels of free cholesterol were seen to be increased in the PPARδSENSE cells. This difference may lie in the kinetics of lipid accumulation in the SENSE cells where visible lipid accumulation occurs much more rapidly than in the compound F-treated THP-1 cells. This may deplete the cells of cholesterol acceptors within the cell thus resulting in an accumulation of free cholesterol. This hypothesis is supported by the observation that triglyceride levels are massively increased in the PPARδSENSE cells (Fig. 6 D). Interestingly, triglyceride accumulation in conjunction with cholesterol is a characteristic of human rather than rodent macrophages (35Kritharides L. Christian A. Stoudt G. Morel D. Rothblat G.H.

Many PX domain-containing proteins are involved in vesicular trafficking, protein sorting, and lipid modification. The presence of a central P XXP motif in most (but not all) PX domains stimulated the initial suggestion that they represent binding partners for SH3 domains (1Ponting C.P. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 2353-2357Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar) and therefore may direct inter- and/or intramolecular protein-protein interactions. In support of this, the PX domain from p47phox was recently shown to interact, albeit weakly, with the C-terminal SH3 domain from the same protein (2Hiroaki H. Ago T. Ito T. Sumimoto H. Kohda D. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 526-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). A different class of PX domain ligand was recently reported by several groups who described binding of PX domains to phosphoinositides. Specifically, the PX domains from the yeast vacuolar t-SNARE Vam7p (3Cheever M.L. Sato T.K. de Beer T. Kutateladze T.G. Emr S.D. Overduin M. Nat.

Simonsen A. Stenmark H. Biochem. J. 2001; 355: 249-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Isolated PX domains from p40phoxand SNX3 were found to be independently capable of localizing to endosomal structures in vivo in a manner that depends upon their ability to bind PtdIns-3-P and on PI-3-kinase activity (5Xu Y.

Similarly, analysis of deletion mutants indicated that the Vam7p PX domain is sufficient for localization of that protein to vacuoles and endosomes in yeast (3Cheever M.L. Sato T.K. de Beer T. Kutateladze T.G. Emr S.D. Overduin M. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 613-618Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). Other phosphoinositides have been reported as the preferred ligands for certain PX domains. The PX domain from the C2-containing PtdIns kinase phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI-3-K) appeared to recognize PtdIns(4,5)P2 (4Song X. Xu W. Zhang A. Huang G. Liang X. Virbasius J.V. Czech M.P. Zhou G.W. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 8940-8944Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), the p47phox PX domain showed a preference for PtdIns(3,4)P2 (6Kanai F. Liu H. Field S.J. Akbary H. Matsuo T. Brown G.E. Cantley L.C. Yaffe M.B. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 675-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar), and the PX domain from cytokine-independent survival kinase bound equivalently to PtdIns(4,5)P2, PtdIns(3,5)P2, and PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 (9Xu J. Liu D. Gill G. Songyang Z. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 154: 699-705Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The structure of the p40phox PX domain was determined using NMR (2Hiroaki H. Ago T. Ito T. Sumimoto H. Kohda D. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 526-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar) and was found to have a novel α + β fold with no resemblance to other known phosphoinositide-binding domains (10Hurley J.H. Misra S. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 2000; 29: 49-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar, 11Ford M.G. Pearse B.M. Higgins M.K. Vallis Y. Owen D.J. Gibson A. Hopkins C.R. Evans P.R. McMahon H.T. Science. 2001; 291: 1051-1055Crossref PubMed Scopus (596) Google Scholar). Analysis of chemical shift perturbations upon PtdIns-3-P binding to the Vam7p PX domain (3Cheever M.L. Sato T.K. de Beer T. Kutateladze T.G. Emr S.D. Overduin M. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 613-618Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar) indicated that the phosphoinositide-binding site is close to the P XXP motif at which SH3 domain binding is likely and further implied that communication between the two binding sites may occur (12Prehoda K.E. Lim W.A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 570-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Thus, phosphoinositide binding and SH3 domain binding by PX domains may be coordinated in some manner to regulate membrane recruitment of PX domain-containing proteins. Since PX domains appear to represent a novel phosphoinositide-binding module (13Wishart M.J. Taylor G.S. Dixon J.E. Cell. 2001; 105: 817-820Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar), we were interested to determine the range of their phosphoinositide-binding specificities and affinities to compare them with pleckstrin homology (PH) domains (which vary widely in affinity and specificity (14Lemmon M.A. Ferguson K.M. Biochem. J. 2000; 350: 1-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (612) Google Scholar)) and FYVE domains (which all appear to recognize PtrdIns-3-P with roughly comparable affinities (8Gillooly D.J. Simonsen A. Stenmark H. Biochem. J. 2001; 355: 249-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar)). The SMART data base (15Schultz J. Copley R.R. Doerks T. Ponting C.P. Bork P. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 231-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (1018) Google Scholar) identifies 57 PX domains in humans but only 15 in yeast. Therefore, for a genome-wide perspective, we chose to analyze all PX domains from S. cerevisiae. Our findings suggest that all yeast PX domains specifically recognize PtdIns-3-P. Four of the 15 PX domains bind this phosphoinositide with high affinity, while the remainder bind with only low affinity indicating a requirement for additional components in their membrane recruitment. Most interestingly, proteins with low affinity PX domains appear most often to participate in the formation of large complexes that may be targeted only through multivalent PX domain interactions to specific cellular membranes. DNA encoding protein fragments that correspond to the relevant PX domains were amplified by polymerase chain reaction from yeast genomic DNA and subcloned into pGSTag (16Ron D. Dressler H.

The protein fragments expressed (fused to GST) were: Mdm1p-(776–908) SNX3/Grd19p-(1–162), Vam7p-(1–129), Yhr105wp-(65–214), Bem3p-(502–637), Mvp1p-(121–258), Spo14p-(304–498), Vps5p-(271–397), Ykr078wp-(108–258), Bem1p-(269–418), SNX4-(20–170), Vps17p-(88–234), Ydr425wp-(112–241), Ydl113cp-(150–316), andYpr097wp-(264–508). GST fusion proteins produced from pGSTag contain a protein kinase A phosphorylation site between GST and the PX domain. GST fusion proteins were produced and (where required) labeled with 32P using protein kinase A as described (17Kavran J.M. Klein D.E. Lee A. Falasca M. Isakoff S.J. Skolnik E.Y. Lemmon M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30497-30508Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). 32P-labeled GST-PX domain proteins (at 0.5 μg/ml) were used to probe bovine serum albumin-blocked nitrocellulose filters on which had been spotted phosphoinositides (1 μl at 2 mg/ml) in the pattern shown in the legend to Fig. 3. Dot-blots were then processed exactly as described (17Kavran J.M. Klein D.E. Lee A. Falasca M. Isakoff S.J. Skolnik E.Y. Lemmon M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30497-30508Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar), and bound radioactivity was visualized with a phosphorimaging device. Dioleoylphosphatidylcholine (DOPC) vesicles with or without 3% (mol/mol) PtdIns-3-P (Matreya Inc, Pleasant Gap, PA) were prepared by extrusion through a 0.1-μm polycarbonate membrane. A vesicle suspension (at 1.5 mm total lipid) was passed over an L1 sensor chip surface (BIAcore) in a BIAcore X instrument, resulting in a signal of 5000 to 7000 response units (RU). Binding of GST-PX domain fusion proteins was measured by passing protein at a range of concentrations over both a surface bearing PtdIns-3-P-containing-vesicles and a surface bearing pure DOPC vesicles. The signal from the DOPC surface was subtracted from that measured simultaneously for the PtdIns-3-P surface to correct for nonspecific binding and refractive index effects. Experiments were all performed at 25 °C in 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, containing 150 mm NaCl. A 10-μl injection of 100 mm NaOH was used to regenerate the lipid surface after each experimental injection. Positive control experiments demonstrated that this regeneration step did not compromise the surface detectably. A new sensor chip surface was generated each day, since signals obtained with positive control proteins (HRS1-FYVE, PLCδ-PH) were found to decay over a period of 24 h. New sensor chip surfaces gave responses within 10% of one another using standard positive control FYVE or PH domain proteins. Binding data for GST-PX domain proteins are plotted in Figs. 4 and 5 as the percent of maximal binding against protein concentration injected (estimated from Coomassie-stained SDS-PAGE gels with albumin standards; see Fig. 2). For ‘high affinity’ PX domains, percent maximal binding was determined at each concentration (c) as (RUc/RUsat) × 100, where RUc is the response at concentration, and RUsat is the maximum response measured at saturation. RUsat ranged from ∼2000 RU to 4000 RU for the high affinity PX domains in different experiments, and a mean value of RUsat was used to calculate percent saturation for the low affinity PX domains shown.Figure 5Comparison of PX , FYVE, and PH domain binding. The Mdm1p PX domain (as a GST fusion protein) bound to PtdIns-3-P vesicles in SPR studies with an affinity similar to PtdIns-3-P binding by the GST/Hrs1-FYVE domain and PtdIns(4,5)P2 binding by GST/PLCδ-PH. By contrast, the Mdm1p PX domain did not bind to vesicles containing 3% PtdIns-4-P or PtdIns(4,5)P2 (Echelon). Essentially identical results for binding specificity were obtained in parallel experiments for the other high affinity PX domains, from SNX3/Grd19, Vam7p, and Yhr105wp. Experiments were performed as described under “Experimental Procedures”. In equivalent experiments, monomeric (non GST fusion) forms of the Hrs1 FYVE domain and the PLC-δ1 PH domain bound to PtdIns-3-P and PtdIns(4,5)P2 with KD values of ∼2.5 μm and 2.0 μm, respectively in agreement with those measured using other techniques (18Sankaran V.G.

As mentioned in the text, some proteins in the lower panel (Spo14p-PX, Mvp1p-PX, and Ykr078wp-PX) were only partially soluble, and Ydr425wp-PX was produced at low levels.

Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 613-618Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). The predicted PX domain from Ypr097wp is a clear outlier since it lacks several conserved features and has large (>45 amino acids) insertions in both the presumed α1/α2 and α2/α3loops. To analyze phospholipid binding we expressed all 15 of the yeast PX domains in Escherichia coli as GST fusion proteins (see “Experimental Procedures”). Most of the fusion proteins were readily and solubly expressed (Fig. 2) and could be obtained in milligram quantities. Exceptions to this were the Spo14p, Mvp1p, and Ykr078wp PX domains that were only partially soluble and the Ydr425wp PX domain, which was expressed only at low levels. To compare phosphoinositide-binding specificities of the 15 PX domains we employed a dot-blot overlay assay, previously used to study lipid binding by PH and FYVE domains (17Kavran J.M. Klein D.E. Lee A. Falasca M. Isakoff S.J. Skolnik E.Y. Lemmon M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30497-30508Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar, 18Sankaran V.G. Klein D.E. Sachdeva M.M. Lemmon M.A. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 8581-8587Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). In this qualitative assay, nitrocellulose filters on which different phosphoinositides have been immobilized are probed with 32P-labeled GST fusion proteins. As shown in Fig. 3, all yeast PX domains displayed a strong preference for PtdIns-3-P (top left spot in each blot) over other phosphoinositides. The exception was Ypr097wp, the significant sequence outlier noted above. In at least 8 of the cases, PtdIns-3-P was the only phospholipid detectably recognized. In other cases such as Vps17p and Ydl113cp, phosphoinositide binding appeared more promiscuous, but PtdIns-3-P was clearly preferred. These data therefore appear to define PtdIns-3-P as a target of all PX domains in yeast. This situation contrasts with that for PH domains, which vary significantly in both the extent and nature of their phosphoinositide-binding specificity (14Lemmon M.A. Ferguson K.M. Biochem. J. 2000; 350: 1-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (612) Google Scholar). Instead, yeast PX domains are more similar as a group to FYVE domains, which all bind PtdIns-3-P (8Gillooly D.J. Simonsen A. Stenmark H. Biochem. J. 2001; 355: 249-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). For a more quantitative view of PtdIns-3-P recognition by yeast PX domains, we next used SPR to analyze their binding to immobilized vesicles containing 3% (mol/mol) PtdIns-3-P in a phosphatidylcholine background. SPR studies were performed with the highly expressed GST fusion proteins shown in the top part of Fig. 2. As shown in Fig. 4, four of these PX domains (those from Mdm1p, SNX3/Grd19p, Vam7p, and Yhr105wp) bound to PtdIns-3-P with relatively high affinity (apparent KD values for GST fusion proteins of 0.15 to 0.5 μm; see below). The remaining PX domains bound to the same vesicles with only low affinity (apparent KD values ≥ 100 μm). The distinction between high affinity and low affinity PX domains is clearly illustrated in Fig. 4 by the fact that SNX3-PX saturates a PtdIns-3-P-containing-sensor surface when injected at less than 1 μm, while Bem1p-PX and SNX4-PX show only low-level binding even when injected at 50–70 μm (2–3 mg/ml). Since many of the highly expressed and most well behaved PX domains fall into the low affinity category (see Fig. 2), we are confident that weak binding does not simply reflect the quality of our protein preparations. Our data therefore suggest the existence of at least two categories of S. cerevisiae PX domains: those that bind PtdIns-3-P with relatively high affinity (the four grouped at the top of Figs. 1 and 3), and those that bind specifically to PtdIns-3-P but with low affinity (the remainder). Additionally, we find that specific recognition of PtdIns-3-P does not necessarily coincide with high binding affinity. We next compared PtdIns-3-P binding by high affinity PX domains with phosphoinositide binding by well characterized PH and FYVE domains. Since GST dimerization can affect binding studies that employ SPR (19Ladbury J.E. Lemmon M.A. Zhou M. Green J. Botfield M. Schlessinger J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3199-3203Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar), we compared GST-PX domains with GST fusion proteins of the Hrs1 FYVE domain (Hrs1-FYVE) and the phospholipase C-δ1 PH domain (PLCδ-PH), which specifically recognize PtdIns-3-P (8Gillooly D.J. Simonsen A. Stenmark H. Biochem. J. 2001; 355: 249-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar) and PtdIns(4,5)P2 (20Lemmon M.A. Ferguson K.M. O'Brien R. Sigler P.B. Schlessinger J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10472-10476Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar), respectively. As shown in Fig.5, PtdIns-3-P binding by a high affinity PX domain (apparent KD ≈ 0.3 μm for Mdm1p-PX) is quantitatively indistinguishable from PtdIns-3-P binding by Hrs1-FYVE or from PtdIns(4,5)P2 binding by PLCδ-PH. We have previously reported using other techniques that monomeric Hrs1-FYVE binds equivalent PtdIns-3-P-containing vesicles with a KD of 2.5 μm (18Sankaran V.G. Klein D.E. Sachdeva M.M. Lemmon M.A. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 8581-8587Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) and that a PLCδ-PH monomer binds equivalent PtdIns(4,5)P2-containing vesicles with a KD of 1.7 μm (20Lemmon M.A. Ferguson K.M. O'Brien R. Sigler P.B. Schlessinger J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10472-10476Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar). SPR studies of these monomeric proteins gave identical results (not shown). Therefore, a reasonable estimate of KD values for PtdIns-3-P binding by monomeric PX domains (without fusion to GST) from the high affinity category is ∼2–3 μm. Fig. 5 shows that Mdm1p-PX does not bind detectably to PtdIns-4-P or PtdIns(4,5)P2 in SPR studies. Very similar results were obtained in identical experiments for the PX domains from SNX3/Grd19p, Vam7p, and Yhr105wp (Fig. 4 and data not shown). Our SPR data argue that only four of the 15 yeast PX domains (the high affinity PX domains) might be independently capable of driving localization of their host proteins to endosomes by binding PtdIns-3-P as reported for the isolated PX domain from mammalian p40phox (6Kanai F. Liu H. Field S.J. Akbary H. Matsuo T. Brown G.E. Cantley L.C. Yaffe M.B. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 675-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar, 7Ellson C.D. Gobert-Gosse S. Anderson K.E.

Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 679-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). These PX domains therefore have properties analogous to those of FYVE domains, which recognize membranes of the endosomal trafficking system. Two of the high affinity yeast PX domains occur in proteins that consist of little more than a PX domain: the sorting nexins SNX3/Grd19p (162 amino acids) and Yhr105wp (214 amino acids). Yeast SNX3/Grd19p is predominantly cytoplasmic but localizes to a prevacuolar endosome-like organelle that accumulates in vps27-mutant yeast (21Voos W. Stevens T.H. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 577-590Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Mammalian SNX3 (also 162 amino acids) specifically recognizes PtdIns-3-P and associates with endosomes in a PI-3-kinase-dependent manner (5Xu Y. Hortsman H. Seet L. Wong S.H. Hong W. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 658-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). Yhr105wp is most closely related in sequence and architecture to SNX3/Grd19p and may function similarly to regulate endosomal trafficking. The high affinity Vam7p PX domain comprises the N-terminal half of a 317-amino acid protein, and in vivo studies of deletion mutants indicate that it is sufficient for targeting Vam7p to the yeast vacuole, where it acts as a t-SNARE (3Cheever M.L. Sato T.K. de Beer T. Kutateladze T.G. Emr S.D. Overduin M. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 613-618Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). The remaining yeast protein with a high affinity PX domain is Mdm1p, a 51-kDa protein that functions in nuclear and mitochondrial inheritance and localizes to punctate structures that are distributed throughout the yeast cytoplasm (22McConnell S.J. Yaffe M.P. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 118: 385-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Although not previously implicated in Mdm1p function, our finding that PtdIns-3-P binds strongly and specifically to the Mdm1p PX domain plus a report that several mutations in the Mdm1p PX domain affect nuclear and/or mitochondrial inheritance (23Fisk H.A. Yaffe M.P. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 485-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) suggest an important role for PtdIns-3-P binding in Mdm1p action. Excluding Ypr097wp, all remaining yeast PX domains appear to bind PtdIns-3-P specifically, but with such low affinity that they cannot possibly drive membrane localization independently. Instead, these low affinity PX domains may only contribute to membrane association together with other domains in the same protein or multi-protein complex. For example, the PX domain of Spo14p and Bem3p is followed immediately by a PH domain, with which it may cooperate in driving membrane association. Alternatively, homo- and/or hetero-oligomerization of proteins containing low affinity PX domains could enhance their effective PtdIns-3-P binding affinity or avidity. For example, Bem1p is a scaffolding protein that forms complexes with several proteins, some of which have PH domains (24Bose I. Irazoqui J.E. Moskow J.J. Bardes E.S. Zyla T.R. Lew D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 7176-7186Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar) at sites of bud emergence. Perhaps the clearest illustration of this point, however, is seen with the sorting nexins that regulate membrane traffic. Several of the 16 mammalian sorting nexins have been studied biochemically and most form both homo- and hetero-oligomers (25Kurten R.C. Eddington A.D. Chowdhury P. Smith R.D. Davidson A.D. Shank B.B. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 1743-1756Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 26Haft C.R. de la Luz Sierra M. Barr V.A. Haft D.H. Taylor S.I. Mol. Cell.

Yhr105wp is the only other yeast-sorting nexin that lacks substantial sequence outside the PX domain and is also the only example other than SNX3 that has a high affinity PX domain. Thus, all of the yeast sorting nexins that cannot oligomerize seem to have high affinity PX domains. By contrast, all of the yeast sorting nexins with low affinity PX domains have the capacity to increase their PtdIns-3-P binding avidity through self-association and/or interaction with other related proteins. For example, SNX1 appears to form homo-oligomers through C-terminal coiled-coil motifs (25Kurten R.C. Eddington A.D. Chowdhury P. Smith R.D. Davidson A.D. Shank B.B. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 1743-1756Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) that are critical for the endosomal localization of SNX1 (29Teasdale R.D. Loci D. Houghton F. Karlsson L. Gleeson P.A. Biochem. J. 2001; 358: 7-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Yeast SNX4 was found in high-throughput two-hybrid screens to interact with both Ydr425wp (30Ito T. Chiba T. Ozawa R. Yoshida M.

Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 665-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar) and has been localized to an endosomal compartment in vivo (25Kurten R.C. Eddington A.D. Chowdhury P. Smith R.D. Davidson A.D. Shank B.B. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 1743-1756Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 33Nothwehr S.F. Hindes A.E. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 1063-1072Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Vps5p forms heteromeric complexes with Vps17p, which also has a low affinity PX domain, and this interaction is necessary for membrane association of Vps5p (32Horazdovsky B.F. Davies B.A. Seaman M.N. McLaughlin S.A. Yoon S. Emr S.D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 1529-1541Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Along with Vps35p, Vps29p, and Vps26p (which do not have PX domains), Vps5p and Vps17p assemble to form the “retromer” on prevacuolar membranes (34Seaman M.N.J. McCaffery J.M. Emr S.D. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 665-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar). A Vps35p/Vps29p/Vps26p subcomplex is believed to recognize cargo for retrieval from this endosomal compartment to the Golgi, and a Vps5p/Vps17p complex is then thought to be recruited to membranes bearing this subcomplex to complete retromer formation. A requirement for cooperative PtdIns-3-P binding by the Vps5p and Vps17p PX domains, coincident with their heteromeric assembly, would ensure that the retromer only forms at endosomal membranes containing PtdIns-3-P. The characteristics of proteins with low affinity PX domains suggest that their primary role is to provide specificity but that other (possibly protein) targets are needed besides PtdIns-3-P to drive membrane association. Recognition of the well conserved P XXP motif in PX domains by SH3 domains could provide this additional targeting in at least some cases. It is likely that the additional targets will only recruit PX domain-containing proteins when they occur alongside PtdIns-3-P in endosomal compartments. By contrast, it is possible that proteins with high affinity PX domains are targeted to all locations at which PtdIns-3-P is present. It might therefore be anticipated that proteins with low affinity PX domains will be found only in specific endosomal subcompartments, perhaps defined by non-lipid targets, while endosomal targeting of proteins with high affinity PX domains will be more general. Analysis of PX domain sequences does not provide any clear clues as to what distinguishes high affinity from low affinity PX domains. All key conserved residues and most of those implicated in PtdIns-3-P binding (3Cheever M.L. Sato T.K. de Beer T. Kutateladze T.G. Emr S.D. Overduin M. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 613-618Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar) are maintained in both categories as expected since PtdIns-3-P specificity is maintained. In that sense, yeast PX domains differ starkly from PH domains. Whereas PX domains remain PtdIns-3-P-specific, but vary greatly in their affinity, specificity and high affinity usually coincide in the case of PH domains. Furthermore, unlike PX domains, PH domains that bind weakly to phosphoinositides are always quite promiscuous (14Lemmon M.A. Ferguson K.M. Biochem. J. 2000; 350: 1-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (612) Google Scholar). It remains to be seen whether all or most mammalian PX domains will specifically recognize PtdIns-3-P or whether other phosphoinositides might be recognized. Song et al. (4Song X. Xu W. Zhang A. Huang G. Liang X. Virbasius J.V. Czech M.P. Zhou G.W. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 8940-8944Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) have reported that the PX domain from the C2-containing PtdIns kinase PI-3-kinase, which has no ortholog in S. cerevisiae, binds specifically to PtdIns(4,5)P2. Kanai et al. (6Kanai F. Liu H. Field S.J. Akbary H. Matsuo T. Brown G.E. Cantley L.C. Yaffe M.B. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 675-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar) reported that the p47phoxPX domain prefers PtdIns(3,4)P2. Thus, the expansion of the PX domain family in going from yeast to humans may include additional phosphoinositide targets, although all S. cerevisiae PX domains specifically recognize PtdIns-3-P.

https://openalex.org/W2067700245,"Transcription factor TFIID, composed of TBP and TAFII subunits, is a central component of the RNA polymerase II machinery. Here, we report that the tissue-selective TAFII105 subunit of TFIID is essential for proper development and function of the mouse ovary. Female mice lacking TAFII105 are viable but infertile because of a defect in folliculogenesis correlating with restricted expression of TAFII105 in the granulosa cells of the ovarian follicle. Gene expression profiling has uncovered a defective inhibin-activin signaling pathway in TAFII105-deficient ovaries. Together, these studies suggest that TAFII105 mediates the transcription of a subset of genes required for proper folliculogenesis in the ovary and establishes TAFII105 as a cell type-specific component of the mammalian transcriptional machinery."

The community is building the Virtual Observatory, an organization of this worldwide data into a coherent whole that can be accessed by anyone, in any form, from anywhere. The resulting system will dramatically improve our ability to do multi-spectral and temporal studies that integrate data from multiple instruments. The Virtual Observatory data also provide a wonderful base for teaching astronomy, scientific discovery, and computational science. Many fields are now coping with a rapidly mounting problem: how to organize, use, and make sense of the enormous amounts of data generated by today's instruments and experiments. The data should be accessible to scientists and educators so that the gap between cutting-edge research and education and public knowledge is minimized and should be presented in a form that will facilitate integrative research. This problem is becoming particularly acute in many fields, notably genomics, neuroscience, and astrophysics. The availability of the Internet is allowing new ideas and concepts for data sharing and use. Here we describe a plan to develop an Internet data resource in astronomy to help address this problem in which, because of the nature of the data and analyses required of them, the data remain widely distributed rather than gathered in one or a few databases (e.g., GenBank). This approach may be applicable to many other fields. Our goal is to make the Internet act as the world's best telescope—a World-Wide Telescope. Today, there are many impressive archives painstakingly constructed from observations associated with an instrument. The Hubble Space Telescope (HST) (1), the Chandra X-Ray Observatory (2), the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) (3), the Two Micron All Sky Survey (2MASS) (4), and the Digitized Palomar Observatory Sky Survey (DPOSS) (5) are examples of this. Each of these archives is interesting in itself, but temporal and multi-spectral studies require combining data from multiple instruments. Furthermore, yearly advances in electronics bring new instruments, doubling the amount of data we collect each year ( Fig. 1 ). For example, approximately a gigapixel is deployed on all telescopes today, and new gigapixel instruments are under construction. A night's observation requires a few hundred gigabytes of memory. The processed data for a single spectral band over the whole sky, a few terabytes. It is impossible for each astronomer to have a private copy of all the data they use. Many of these new instruments are being used for systematic surveys of our galaxy and of the distant universe. Together they will give us an unprecedented catalog to study the evolving universe, provided that the data can be systematically studied in an integrated fashion. Online archives already contain raw and derived astronomical observations of billions of objects from both temporal and multi-spectral surveys. Together, they house an order of magnitude more data than any single instrument. In addition, all the astronomy literature is online and is cross-indexed with the observations (6, 7). Why is it necessary to study the sky in such detail? Celestial objects radiate energy over an extremely wide range of wavelengths from radio waves to infrared, optical to ultraviolet, x-rays and even gamma rays. Each of these observations carries important information about the nature of the objects. The same physical object can appear to be totally different in different wavebands ( Fig. 2 ). A young spiral galaxy appears as many concentrated “blobs,” the so-called HII regions in the ultraviolet, whereas in the optical it appears as smooth spiral arms. A galaxy cluster can only be seen as an aggregation of galaxies in the optical, whereas x-ray observations show the hot and diffuse gas between the galaxies. The physical processes inside these objects can only be understood by combining observations at several wavelengths. Today, we already have large sky coverage in 10 spectral regions; soon we will have additional data in at least five more bands. These will reside in different archives, making their integration all the more complicated. Raw astronomy data is complex. It can be in the form of fluxes measured in finite size pixels on the sky, spectra (flux as a function of wavelength), individual photon events, or even phase information from the interference of radio waves. In many other disciplines, once data is collected, it can be frozen and distributed to other locations. This is not the case for astronomy. Astronomy data needs to be calibrated for the transmission of the atmosphere and for the response of the instruments. This requires an exquisite understanding of all the properties of the whole system, which sometimes takes several years. With each new understanding of how corrections should be made, the data are reprocessed and recalibrated. As a result, data in astronomy stays “live” much longer than in other disciplines—it needs an active “curation,” mostly by the expert group that collected the data. Consequently, astronomy data reside at many different geographical locations, and that will not change. There will not be a central “Astronomy database.” Each group has its own historical reasons to archive the data one way or another. Any solution that tries to federate the astronomy data sets must start with the premise that this trend is not going to change substantially in the near future; there is no top-down way to simultaneously rebuild all data sources. To solve these problems, the astrophysical community is developing the World-Wide Telescope, often called the “Virtual Observatory” (8). In this approach, the data will primarily be accessed via digital archives that are widely distributed. The actual telescopes will either be dedicated to surveys that feed the archives, or telescopes will be scheduled to follow up on “interesting” phenomena found in the archives. Astronomers will look for patterns in the data—spectral and temporal, known and unknown—and use these to study various object classes. They will have a variety of tools at their fingertips: a unified search engine, to collect and aggregate data from several large archives simultaneously, and a huge distributed computing resource, to perform the analyses close to the data, in order to avoid moving petabytes of data across the networks. Other sciences have comparable efforts of putting all their data online and in the public domain—GenBank in genomics is a good example—but so far these are centralized rather than federated systems. The Virtual Observatory will give everyone access to data that span the entire spectrum, the entire sky, all historical observations, and all the literature. For publications, data will reside at a few sites maintained by the publishers. These archive sites will support simple searches. More complex analyses will be done with imported data extracts at the user's facility. Time on the instrument will be available to all. Thus, the Virtual Observatory should make it easy to conduct such temporal and multi-spectral studies by automating the discovery and the assembly of the necessary data. One of the main uses of the Virtual Observatory will be to facilitate searches where statistics are critical. We need large samples of galaxies in order to understand the fine details of the expanding universe and of galaxy formation. These statistical studies require multicolor imaging of millions of galaxies and measurement of their distances. We need to perform statistical analyses as a function of their observed type, environment, and distance. Other projects study rare objects, ones that do not fit typical patterns; they search for the needles in the haystack. To this end, the use of multi-spectral observations is an enormous help. Colors of objects reflect their temperature. And in the expanding Universe, the light emitted by distant objects is redshifted. Therefore, searching for extremely red objects finds either extremely cold objects or extremely distant ones. Data mining studies of extremely red objects discovered distant quasars, the latest at a redshift of 6.28 (9). Mining the 2MASS and SDSS archives found many cold objects such as brown dwarfs, which are bigger than a planet yet smaller than a star. These are good examples of multiwavelength searches not possible with a single observation of the sky, done by hand today, automated in the future. We do not even know all of the data that existed; we will have to discover them on the fly."

Rotationally inelastic collisions of nitric oxide (NO) molecules with Ar atoms were studied by combining crossed molecular beams, circularly polarized resonant multiphoton ionization probing, and velocity-mapped ion imaging detection. The observed sense of NO product rotation varies with deflection angle and is a strong function of the NO final rotational state. The largest preferences for sense of rotation are observed at the highest kinematically allowed product rotational states; for lower rotational states, the variation with deflection angle becomes oscillatory. Quantum calculations on the most recently reported NO-Ar potential give good agreement with the observed oscillation patterns in the sense of rotation."
https://openalex.org/W1567175690,"Only a few of the dozen or so known stellar-mass black holes have been observed away from the plane of the Galaxy1. Those few could have been ejected from the plane as a result of a ‘kick’ received during a supernova explosion, or they could be remnants of the population of massive stars formed in the early stages of evolution of the Galaxy. Determining their orbital motion should help to distinguish between these options. Here we report the transverse motion (in the plane of the sky) for the black-hole X-ray nova XTE J1118+480 (refs 2, 3, 4, 5), from which we derive a large space velocity. This X-ray binary system has an eccentric orbit around the Galactic Centre, like most objects in the halo of the Galaxy, such as ancient stars and globular clusters. The properties of the system suggest that its age is comparable to or greater than the age of the Galactic disk. Only an extraordinary ‘kick’ from a supernova could have launched the black hole into an orbit like this from a birthplace in the disk of the Galaxy."
https://openalex.org/W2029022233,"We have identified an active normal fault in the epicentral area of the Basel (Switzerland) earthquake of 18 October 1356, the largest historical seismic event in central Europe. The event of 1356 and two prehistoric events have been characterized on the fault with geomorphological analysis, geophysical prospecting, and trenching. Carbon-14 dating indicates that the youngest event occurred in the interval 610 to 1475 A.D. and may correspond to the 1356 Basel earthquake. The occurrence of the three earthquakes induced a total of 1.8 meters of vertical displacement in the past 8500 years for a mean uplift rate of 0.21 millimeters per year. These successive ruptures on the normal fault indicate the potential for strong ground movements in the Basel region and should be taken into account to refine the seismic hazard estimates along the Rhine graben."

OLE1 gene expression is regulated by unsaturated fatty acids, which repress transcription and destabilize the OLE1 mRNA. Expression of OLE1 is activated by N-terminal proteolytic fragments of two homologous endoplasmic reticulum membrane proteins, Spt23p and Mga2p. Disruption of either gene does not significantly affect cell growth or fatty acid metabolism; cells that contain null alleles of both genes, however, are unsaturated fatty acid auxotrophs. An analysis of spt23Δand mga2Δ strains shows that Spt23p and Mga2p differentially activate and regulate OLE1 transcription. In glucose-grown cells, both genes activate transcription to similar levels of activity. Expressed alone, Mga2p induces high levels of OLE1 transcription in cells exposed to cobalt or grown in glycerol-containing medium. Spt23p expressed alone activates OLE1 transcription to levels similar to those in wild type cells. OLE1 expression is strongly repressed by unsaturated fatty acids in spt23Δ or mga2Δ cells, under all growth conditions. To test if OLE1 expression is controlled by fatty acids at the level of membrane proteolysis, soluble N-terminal fragments of Spt23p and Mga2p that lack their membrane-spanning regions (Δtm) were expressed under the control of their native promoters in spt23Δ;mga2Δcells. Under those conditions, Mga2pΔtm acts as a powerful transcription activator that is strongly repressed by unsaturated fatty acids. By comparison, the Spt23pΔtm polypeptide weakly activates transcription and shows little regulation by unsaturated fatty acids. Co-expression of the two soluble fragments results in activation to levels observed with the Mga2pΔtm protein alone. The fatty acid repression of transcription under those conditions is attenuated by Spt23Δtm, however, suggesting that the two proteins may interact to modulate OLE1 gene expression.

Because of the importance of lipids to numerous cellular functions, eukaryotes have developed complex mechanisms for regulating lipid biosynthetic activity and membrane lipid composition. The Saccharomyces OLE1 1 gene is a central enzyme in cellular lipid metabolism. It encodes a Δ-9 fatty acid desaturase, an intrinsic membrane enzyme that converts saturated fatty acyl-CoA substrates to monounsaturated fatty acid species by an oxygen-dependent mechanism (1Stukey J.E.

The unsaturated fatty acid products of Ole1p compose 75–80% of the fatty acyl groups in membrane lipids, and the regulation of its activity plays a dominant role in governing the composition and physical properties of membranes in growing cells. Expression of the OLE1 gene is regulated by a number of physiological and nutritional controls, including nutrient fatty acids (3McDonough V.M. Stukey J.E. Martin C.E. J. Biol.

We have shown previously that unsaturated fatty acids exhibit strong repressive effects on OLE1 expression at the levels of transcription (6Choi J.Y. Stukey J. Hwang S.Y. Martin C.E. J. Biol.

Chem. 1996; 271: 25801-25809Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Fatty acid-mediated repression of transcription is mediated through at least two elements in the OLE1 promoter. The fatty acid regulated (FAR) sequences (6Choi J.Y. Stukey J. Hwang S.Y. Martin C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3581-3589Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar) act as a primary transcription activation region under aerobic conditions. It can activate and confer fatty acid-mediated repression on a foreign gene when placed upstream of the Saccharomyces CYC1 basal promoter elements. We have also identified a second low oxygen response element (LORE) that is positioned ∼200 bases downstream from the FAR element (7Vasconcelles M.J. Jiang Y. McDaid K. Gilooly L. Wretzel S. Porter D.L. Martin C.E. Goldberg M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14374-14384Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). That element acts with the FAR element to strongly activate transcription in response to hypoxic conditions and on induction by cobalt, which is thought to interfere with an unidentified oxygen sensor. Tandem copies of the LORE element that are placed in a heterologous promoter exhibit hypoxic induced transcription activation and can be repressed by unsaturated fatty acids (7Vasconcelles M.J.

Chem. 2000; 275: 32379-32382Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar) have identified regulatory circuits that employ intrinsic membrane proteins that act as lipid sensors. These control gene activity by a process that involves regulated intramembrane proteolysis (10Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 11041-11048Crossref PubMed Scopus (1098) Google Scholar, 11Osborne T.F. J. Biol.

The most well studied example is that of the sterol regulatory element-binding protein (SREBP), which is an integral endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane protein. Under conditions of sterol depletion, SREBP is cleaved by two membrane-bound proteases, releasing a soluble N-terminal polypeptide that contains DNA binding and transcription activation domains that participate in the activation of a number of lipid metabolic genes (10Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 11041-11048Crossref PubMed Scopus (1098) Google Scholar). A second proteolytic activation mechanism of membrane proteins that controls Saccharomyces cerevisiae OLE1 gene expression has been described recently (12Zhang S. Skalsky Y. Garfinkel D.J. Genetics. 1999; 151: 473-483Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13Zhang S. Burkett T.J. Yamashita I. Garfinkel D.J. Mol. Cell.

Cell. 2000; 102: 577-586Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). SPT23 and MGA2are homologous genes that encode ER-resident membrane proteins. Disruption of either gene has little effect on the growth or production of unsaturated fatty acids, whereas disruption of both creates a synthetic auxotrophy for unsaturated fatty acids due to the loss of OLE1 expression (12Zhang S. Skalsky Y. Garfinkel D.J. Genetics. 1999; 151: 473-483Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Expression of N-terminal fragments of Spt23p and Mga2p further showed that those polypeptides, although they lack a functional DNA binding domain, serve as co-activators of OLE1 transcription (12Zhang S. Skalsky Y. Garfinkel D.J. Genetics. 1999; 151: 473-483Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13Zhang S. Burkett T.J. Yamashita I. Garfinkel D.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4718-4729Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Membrane-bound Spt23p and Mga2p are apparently converted to these soluble active forms in vivo via a ubiquitin-mediated mechanism that involves the cleavage of a soluble 90-kDa N-terminal fragment from its inactive 120-kDa membrane-bound precursor by the 26 S proteosome (14Hoppe T. Matuschewski K. Rape M. Schlenker S. Ulrich H.D. Jentsch S. Cell. 2000; 102: 577-586Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). Evidence from those studies suggests that Spt23p processing may be selectively regulated by unsaturated fatty acids. The unsaturated fatty acids 16:1, 18:2, and 18:3 inhibited processing of Spt23p to its active 90-kDa form, whereas exposure to 18:1 failed to block the proteolytic step. The lack of inhibition of Spt23p proteolysis by the fatty acid that has the highest melting temperature suggests that the regulation mechanism might detect changes in membrane “fluidity” caused by the incorporation of the fatty acids into membrane lipids. We have determined recently (15Jiang Y. Vasconcelles M.J. Wretzel S. Light A. Martin C.E. Goldberg M.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 6161-6169Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) that Mga2p is essential for the hypoxic induction of OLE1 gene expression and that it is a component of the LORE DNA binding complex under those conditions.

To investigate whether the inhibition of Spt23p processing (and presumably a similar effect associated with Mga2p) is the basis for the fatty acid-mediated regulation of transcription, we tested the ability of cells to regulate OLE1 transcription when only soluble forms of the two proteins were expressed. In this paper, we demonstrate that Spt23p and Mga2p have distinct but overlapping functions with respect to the activation of OLE1 transcription. Evidence is presented that OLE1 expression is strongly repressed by unsaturated fatty acids when activated by a soluble form of Mga2p and that Spt23p may act either as an activator of OLE1 transcription or as a negative modulator of Mga2p fatty acid-mediated regulation. S. cerevisiae strains used in this study are shown in Table I. Plasmids constructed for this study are shown in TableII. Standard yeast genetics methods were used for construction of strains bearing the appropriate mutations or gene disruptions.

The SPT23 gene was isolated using the PCR primer pair SF and SR, which amplifies a fragment extending from bases −1003 to +2152 of the chromosomal gene. Amplified fragments were ligated into vector pCRscript SK+. To assemble the gene disruption construct, a fragment extending from residues −48 to +1351 was removed by restriction digestion with XbaI and SpeI. The remaining vector fragment containing flanking SPT23 sequences was blunt-ended and ligated with a blunt-ended HindIII fragment derived from the Saccharomyces LEU2 gene to create the vector pCRspt23Δ::LEU2. The chromosomal SPT23gene was disrupted by transformation of the DTY11A strain with a DNA fragment isolated from the vector by digestion with restriction enzymes PstI and NotI. The MGA2 gene was cloned using a similar strategy using the PCR primer pair MF and MR, which amplified a fragment extending from nucleotides −242 to +2992 of the chromosomal DNA. The gene disruption construct was created by replacing an XbaI/HpaI fragment with the LEU2 gene to create vector pCRmga2Δ::LEU2 by the above procedure. The chromosomal MGA2 gene was disrupted with a DNA fragment derived from the vector by digestion with the restriction enzymes PstI and NotI. Strains containing disrupted forms of both spt23Δ and mga2Δ genes were constructed by crossing strains containing a disruption of one of the two genes. The diploid parent strain was sporulated, and haploid progeny were screened by comparison of growth on agar medium containing 0.5 mm 16:1 and 0.5 mm 18:1 or no fatty acids. Candidate strains that did not grow on the fatty acid-free medium were verified as authentic spt23Δ;mga2Δ strains by PCR analysis of both genes. To construct plasmids that express the ∼90-kDa soluble forms of Spt23p and Mga2p under control of their native promoters, DNA fragments were amplified from their respective genes with oligonucleotide pairs MGApro-F/MGA2rev2 and SPTpro-F/SPT23rev1. Each amplified gene fragment was cloned into pCR-Script SK+ to yield plasmids pCRmga2NΔtm and pCRspt23NΔtm. Fragments containing the promoter and protein-coding sequences for each gene were then isolated by NotI and XhoI digestion and inserted into the centromeric plasmid pRS413 (Stratagene) yielding plasmids pRSmga2NΔtm and pRSspt23NΔtm. β-Galactosidase activities of cells containing the lacZ reporter plasmids were performed as described previously (6Choi J.Y. Stukey J. Hwang S.Y. Martin C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3581-3589Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Cell densities for the assays were determined by measurement at A600, and corrections for light scattering were made at A550. At least three independent transformants were assayed for each experiment, and β-galactosidase activities are the result of at least three independent experiments. Each experimental assay was performed in duplicate. Cells containing OLE1 promoter::lacZ reporter genes were tested according to protocols published previously (3McDonough V.M. Stukey J.E.

Cells were pre-grown in the appropriate SDt dropout medium supplemented with 1% tergitol and 1 mm 18:2. Those cultures were used to inoculate (at 1/10 volume) fresh fatty acid-free medium or medium containing 1 mm 18:2, metal ions, or carbon source. Cells were then incubated for 6–24 h and harvested by centrifugation for analysis of β-galactosidase activity. RNA was isolated for Northern blot analysis and quantification by PhosphorImaging as described previously (5Gonzalez C.I. Martin C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25801-25809Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Fatty acid methyl esters were extracted from cell pellets derived from strains grown on fatty acid-free medium and were first washed with cold water. Strains grown on fatty acid-supplemented media were first washed with 1% tergitol in deionized water and then cold water. Methyl esters were analyzed by gas chromatography as described previously (17Oh C.S. Toke D.A. Mandala S. Martin C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17376-17384Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). To examine the independent roles of the SPT23 and MGA2 genes on OLE1expression, we tested the effects on growth and cellular fatty acid composition in strains that contained disrupted forms of the two genes (Table IV). Although there were reduced levels of 16:1 in the gene disrupted strains, these were compensated for by increases in 18:1, so that all strains contained >68% total (16:1 + 18:1) unsaturated fatty acids. This indicates that disruption of either gene does not produce strong effects on overall OLE1 expression under normal laboratory growth conditions. A spt23Δ;mga2Δ strain containing null alleles in both genes, however, exhibited a strict requirement for unsaturated fatty acids on liquid minimal medium, which supports the previous observations (12Zhang S. Skalsky Y. Garfinkel D.J. Genetics. 1999; 151: 473-483Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) that SPT23 and MGA2 have overlapping functions that are essential for OLE1 gene expression.Table IVFatty acid composition of strains that contain disrupted alleles of SPT23 and MGA2StrainFatty acid14:014:116:016:118:018:126:026:0-OH16:1+18:1DTY11A2.42 ± 0.011.68 ± 0.3516.78 ± 2.7041.59 ± 8.714.23 ± 0.9629.39 ± 4.231.02 ± 0.672.89 ± 0.5170.98mga2Δ;SPT232.62 ± 0.272.30 ± 0.3917.36 ± 0.3436.54 ± 1.534.53 ± 0.0832.21 ± 1.611.39 ± 0.143.04 ± 0.0968.75spt23Δ;MGA21.57 ± 0.181.80 ± 1.9714.40 ± 1.333.62 ± 0.454.86 ± 0.6639.12 ± 0.851.48 ± 0.053.16 ± 0.1872.74Cells were grown to mid-logarithmic phase at 30 °C in fatty acid-free SDt medium.

Cells were harvested and washed by centrifugation and subjected to HCl methanolysis as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Data represent the results of analysis of lipids from three independent cultures of each strain ± S.D. Previous studies (12Zhang S. Skalsky Y. Garfinkel D.J. Genetics. 1999; 151: 473-483Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) using a strain that contained a disrupted MGA2 gene and a temperature-sensitive allele of SPT23 showed that very high levels of unsaturated fatty acids (∼50%) persist in cellular lipids 15 h after a shift from permissive to restrictive temperatures. This suggested that high basal levels of OLE1 expression might occur in the absence of both proteins. To determine whether OLE1 continues to be expressed under those conditions, we examined the effects of fatty acid deprivation on the growth and relative desaturase activity of wild type and spt23Δ;mga2Δ cells that contained disrupted forms of both genes (Fig. 1, A and B). To monitor the in vivo activity of the desaturase, the spt23Δ;mga2Δ and wild type strains were initially grown on medium containing linoleic acid (18:2). Under those conditions, wild type desaturase activity is repressed, and over multiple generations, the endogenous 16:1 and 18:1 products of the enzyme are replaced in cellular lipids by the exogenous 18:2. Cells were then transferred to fatty acid-free medium to follow the induction of Ole1p-dependent desaturase activity. When the spt23Δ;mga2Δ cells were transferred to fatty acid-free medium, growth proceeded at wild type rates for ∼2 generations before slowing, and stationary growth occurred ∼3.5 generations after the transfer. In both strains the most abundant fatty acids at the time of transfer were 18:2 (∼70 weight %) and the saturated species 16:0 and 18:0 (∼20 weight %) (Fig. 1 B). Very low cumulative levels of 16:1 and 18:1 were found in the wild type (∼7%) and spt23Δ;mga2Δ (∼5%) strains, suggesting that OLE1 might be expressed at low basal levels, even under fatty acid-repressed conditions. The wild type cells exhibited the previously observed pattern of OLE1 induction after transfer to fatty acid-free medium. Eight hours after the transfer, levels of the assimilated 18:2 dropped ∼5-fold, and the 16:1 and 18:1 products of the induced desaturase increased to greater than 60% of the total fatty acid mass. Under the same conditions, the spt23Δ;mga2Δ cells showed no significant increases in 16:1 and 18:1 levels, indicating that OLE1 expression was not induced by fatty acid depletion significantly above the previously observed basal levels. At the same time, there was a striking increase in saturated fatty acids and a reduction in 18:2 in the spt23Δ;mga2Δ strain, which would be expected if saturated fatty acid synthesis continued in the absence of induced desaturase activity. The small differences in unsaturated fatty acid levels in wild type, spt23Δ, and mga2Δ cells suggested that either gene could independently activate and regulate OLE1 expression under normal laboratory growth conditions. This was confirmed by quantitative Northern blot experiments (Fig.2) that showed that disruption of either gene did not affect OLE1 steady state mRNA levels in either fatty acid-free or"

Charo I.F. Parise L.V. Fitzgerald L.A. Blood. 1988; 71: 831-843Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Interaction between αIIbβ3 and fibrinogen is mediated by the C-terminal γ-chain sequence of fibrinogen (2Kloczewiak M. Timmons S. Hawiger J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1982; 107: 181-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). αIIbβ3 also binds to von Willebrand factor, vitronectin, and fibronectin through RGD sequences in these ligands (3Pytela R. Pierschbacher M.D. Ginsberg M.H. Plow E.F. Ruoslahti E. Science. 1986; 231: 1559-1562Crossref PubMed Scopus (664) Google Scholar). The αIIb subunit has seven repeated sequences of ∼60–70 residues each in its N-terminal portion. Repeats 4–7 have putative divalent cation binding motifs of the general structure D XD XDG XXD. Although a αIIbβ3-fibrinogen interaction is a therapeutic target, how ligands interact with αIIbβ3 has not been established. The second putative cation binding site of αIIb (residues 294–314 in N-terminal repeat 5 of αIIb) can be chemically cross-linked to the fibrinogen γ-chain C-terminal dodecapeptide (HHLGGAKQAGDV400–411) (4D'Souza S. Ginsberg M.H. Burke T.A. Plow E.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 3440-3446Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This peptide and antibodies against it have been shown to block binding of fibrinogen to αIIbβ3 (5D'Souza S. Ginsberg M.H. Matsueda G.R. Plow E.F.

On the other hand, several lines of evidence suggest that the ligand binding site(s) in αIIb are located in repeats 2–4. The 334 N-terminal residues in αIIb regulate the ligand binding specificity of αIIbβ3 (10Loftus J.C. Halloran C.E. Ginsberg M.H. Feigen L.P. Zablocki J.A. Smith J.W. J. Biol.

A recombinant αIIbβ3 fragment that is composed of residues 1–233 of αIIb and residues 111–318 of β3 (designated “mini-integrin”) has been shown to bind to an RGD-containing peptide (11McKay B.S.

Mutating several amino acid residues that are clustered in the predicted loops in repeat 3 of the α subunit, or swapping the predicted loops in repeats 2–4, has been shown to block ligand binding of α4β1, α5β1, and αIIbβ3 (17Irie A. Kamata T. Puzon-McLaughlin W. Takada Y. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5542-5549Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 18Kamata T. Irie A. Takada Y. J. Biol.

We have recently localized epitopes for ligand-mimetic anti-αIIbβ3antibodies (OP-G2 and LJ-CP3) within repeats 2–4 (16Puzon-McLaughlin W. Kamata T. Takada Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7795-7802Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). However, these results do not rule out the possibility that ligands bind to other sequences of the αIIb subunit. In this study, we designed experiments to localize the ligand contact surface in αIIb using loop swapping and site-directed mutagenesis. We systematically swapped all 27 predicted loops, the most likely candidates for ligand binding sites (19Brandon C. Tooze J. Introduction to Protein Structure. Garland Publishing, Inc., New York1991Google Scholar), in the αIIb N-terminal sequence repeats with the corresponding regions of α4 or α5. We found that ligand binding was not affected by 19 of 27 swapping mutations using fibrinogen and ligand-mimetic mAbs as ligands, effectively ruling out the possibility that a major ligand binding site is located in repeats 1, 6, and 7. In contrast, swapping eight predicted loops in repeats 2–4 and one at the boundary between repeats 4 and 5 of αIIb completely blocked αIIbβ3 interaction with ligands. We then identified several discontinuous residues within these predicted loops. It has been proposed that the N-terminal seven sequence repeats are folded into a β-propeller domain comprising seven four-stranded β-sheets arranged in a torus around a 7-fold pseudosymmetrical axis (20Springer T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 65-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). We found that most of the residues that are critical for ligand binding are clustered in the proposed β-propeller model. These results predict that the ligand binding interface in αIIbβ3 localizes on the outer edge of the top and on the side of the β-propeller. mAb 15 (21) was a kind gift from M. H.

After washing with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, cells were incubated with fluorescein-isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (BIOSOURCE, Camarillo, CA) for 30 min on ice. Human fibrinogen (Enzyme Research Laboratories, South Bend, IN) was labeled with FITC as described previously (32Xia Z. Wong T. Liu Q. Kasirer-Friede A. Brown E. Frojmovic M.M. Br. J.

Cells were washed with modified Tyrode-Hepes buffer (5 mm Hepes, 5 mmglucose, 0.2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 1 × Tyrode's solution) supplemented with 2 mm CaCl2 and 2 mm MgCl2. Cells were then incubated with 150 μg/ml FITC-labeled fibrinogen in the presence of 10 μg/ml control mouse IgG or PT25-2 in the same buffer for 30 min. After removing unbound fibrinogen, cells were resuspended in Hepes-buffered saline supplemented with 2 mm CaCl2 and 2 mm MgCl2. Binding of fibrinogen (FITC staining) was analyzed on a gated subset of cells highly positive for αIIbβ3 expression (PE staining) in FACScan. Relative fibrinogen binding was calculated as (FPT −FmIgG)/(FwPT −FwmIgG), where FPT is the median fluorescence intensity of fibrinogen binding in the presence of PT25-2, FmIgG is the median fluorescence intensity of fibrinogen binding in the presence of normal mouse IgG,FwPT is the median fluorescence intensity of fibrinogen binding to cells expressing wt αIIbβ3 in the presence of PT25-2, and FwmIgG is the median fluorescence intensity of fibrinogen binding to cells expressing wt αIIbβ3 in the presence of normal mouse IgG. Relative αIIbβ3 expression is a ratio of the median fluorescence intensity of PL98DF6 binding to the gated population to the median fluorescence intensity of PL98DF6 binding to the gated population expressing wt αIIbβ3. Modeling was done with SegMod (35Levitt M. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 226: 507-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar) of LOOK, version 2.0.5 (Molecular Applications Group, Palo Alto, CA) and MODELLER Release 4 (http://guitar.rockefeller.edu/modeler) (36Sali A. Blundell T.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 234: 779-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (10636) Google Scholar). Templates were 1tbg, 1gof, and 1kap (http://www.pdb.bnl.gov). A LOOK model was made using the alignment shown in Fig. 1 between αIIb and G protein transducin β subunit (37Sondek J. Bohm A. Lambright D.G. Hamm H.E. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1996; 379: 369-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (709) Google Scholar) (1tbg, gbeta). Additionally, three 3-4 loop templates of W5 of 1gof were used as templates for the 3-4 loops of W5, W6, and W7 as described previously (38Oxvig C. Springer T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 4870-4875Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The 1-2 loops were then excised from W4–W7 of this model, and Ca2+ binding loops from 1kap were superimposed using four β-strand residues on either side of this loop from 1kap and 1tbg. A final model was made with MODELLER using the entire LOOK model as the initial (.ini) file, and using as templates 1) four different 1kap files containing only the residues shown in Fig. 1 and Ca2+ ions (39Springer T.A. Jing H. Takagi J. Cell. 2000; 102: 275-277Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar); 2) the LOOK model of αIIb deleting the residues aligning with the 1kap loops and additionally two residues before and one residue after these loops in W4 and W5, and four residues before and one residue after these loops in W6 and W7; and 3) four circularly permuted, superimposed 1tbg β-propeller domains beginning with residue Thr-86 as shown in Fig. 1 or beginning with residues Glu-130, Thr-173, or Glu-215 (see 20). We generated an αIIb β-propeller model based on the alignment of αIIb with the heterotrimeric G protein β subunit β-propeller domain (Fig. 1). The β-propeller contains seven radially arranged β-sheets, also called “W” because of their W-like topology, with four anti-parallel β-strands and three connecting loops within each sheet. In this model, the 1-2 and 3-4 loops, which connect β-strands 1 and 2 and β-strands 3 and 4, respectively, are located in the lower face of the model. The 4-1 loops, which connect β-strand 4 of one W with β-strand 1 of the next W, and the 2-3 loops, which connect β-strands 2 and 3, are located very close to each other in the upper face of the domain. Fig. 1 shows an alignment of the αIIbsequence with those of integrin α4 and α5subunits and the β-propeller domain of the G protein β subunit. The loops of each W are named after the β-strands they connect. To identify the αIIb sequences that are critical for ligand binding, we systematically replaced 27 predicted loop structures within residues 1–452 with the corresponding regions of α4 or α5 (Fig. 1), which have ligand binding specificities different from that of αIIb. The segments that were swapped are boxed in Fig. 1. This strategy is based on the premise that swapping homologous residues will block the ligand binding function if the swapped region determines the ligand binding function. This strategy has been used successfully to identify regions that are critical for ligand binding in several integrin α subunits (40Irie A. Kamata T. Takada Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 7198-7203Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 41Zhang X.-P. Puzon-McLaughlin W. Irie A. Kovach A. Prokopishyn N.L. Laferté L. Takeuchi K.-I. Tsuji T. Takada Y. Biochemistry. 1999; 43: 14424-14431Crossref Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The resulting αIIbswapping mutants were transiently expressed in CHO cells that homogeneously express wt human β3 (β3-CHO cells). The 27 swapping mutants were all surface expressed based on flow cytometry of transfected cells. Typically 50–80% of transfected cells were positive with anti-αIIb mAb PL98DF6 (data not shown). We studied the ability of the αIIb swapping mutants to bind to fibrinogen. Binding of FITC-labeled soluble fibrinogen to CHO cells expressing αIIbβ3(αIIbβ3-CHO) was detected by flow cytometry. The αIIbβ3 expressed in CHO cells has been reported to be a low affinity form (42O'Toole T. Loftus J. Du X. Glass A. Ruggeri Z. Shattil S. Plow E. Ginsberg M. Cell Regul. 1990; 1: 883-893Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). Although αIIbβ3-CHO cells adhere to immobilized fibrinogen without activation, αIIbβ3 must be activated with mAb PT25-2 to bind to soluble fibrinogen. The mAb PT25-2 recognizes and activates αIIbβ3, but not αvβ3 (endogenous hamster αv/exogenous human β3), indicating that binding of FITC-labeled fibrinogen to αIIbβ3-CHO cells in the presence of PT25-2 is αIIbβ3-specific (18Kamata T. Irie A. Takada Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18610-18615Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Under the conditions used, parent CHO cells or β3-CHO cells that express only αvβ3 did not bind to fibrinogen. Most of the swapping mutants (19 of 27) bound to fibrinogen upon activation with PT25-2 (Fig. 2), indicating that major ligand binding sites are not present in these predicted loops. In contrast, the W2:4-1 (residues 73–90), W2:2-3 (residues 110–129), W3:4-1 (residues 147–166), W3:2-3 (residues 188–193), W3:3-4 (residues 200–208), W4:4-1 (residues 217–235), W4:2-3 (residues 259–264), and W5:4-1 (residues 283–285) swapping mutants did not bind to soluble fibrinogen, although PT25-2 recognized these swapping mutants as shown by flow cytometry (TableII).Table IIReactivity of αIIb swapping mutants with anti-αIIbβ3 mAbsPredicted loopsOP-G2LJ-CP32G12A2A9AP-2LJ-CP8LJ-P9PT25–2W1:4–14+3+4+4+4+4+4+4+W1:1–24+4+4+4+4+4+4+4+W1:2–34+3+3+4+4+4+4+4+W1:3–44+4+4+4+4+4+4+4+W2:4–1––+––––2+W2:1–23+2+4+3+4+3+4+4+W2:2–3––+––––4+W2:3–44+4+4+4+4+4+4+4+W3:4–1–––––––3+W3:1–24+3+4+4+4+4+4+4+W3:2–3––+–+–+4+W3:3–4–––––––3+W4:4–1–––2+2++2+3+W4:1–24+3+4+4+4+4+4+2+W4:2–34+3+4+3+4+4+3+4+W4:3–44+4+4+4+4+4+4+4+W5:4–13+2+4+4+4+4+4+4+W5:1–24+4+4+4+4+4+4+2+W5:2–34+4+4+4+4+4+4+4+W5:3–44+4+4+4+4+4+4++W6:4–14+4+4+4+4+4+4+4+W6:1–24+3+4+4+4+4+4+4+W6:2–34+3+4+4+4+4+4+4+W6:3–44+4+4+4+4+4+4+4+W7:4–14+3+4+4+4+4+4+4+W7:1–24+3+4+4+4+4+4+4+W7:2–34+4+4+4+4+4+4+4+The αIIb swapping mutants were transiently transfected in β3-CHO cells.

The W5:3-4 swapping mutant also abolished fibrinogen binding; however, the reactivity of this swapping mutant with activating mAb PT25-2 was significantly impaired (Table II). The epitope for PT25-2 localizes within 335–338 of αIIb as shown with human-to-mouse αIIb mutants (16Puzon-McLaughlin W. Kamata T. Takada Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7795-7802Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). We thus suspected that the W5:3-4 swapping mutant could not bind to fibrinogen because it could not be activated with PT25-2. To test this hypothesis, we expressed the W5:3-4 αIIb swapping mutant together with truncated β3, which lacks most of the β3 cytoplasmic domain. It has been reported that truncation of the β3cytoplasmic domain constitutively activates αIIbβ3 and allows fibrinogen binding without further activation (34Hughes P. O'Toole T. Ylanne J. Shattil S. Ginsberg M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12411-12417Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). In agreement, CHO cells expressing wt or W5:3-4 mutant αIIb together with truncated β3 bound fibrinogen in the absence of PT25-2 (data not shown). Therefore, it is highly likely that the W5:3-4 swapping mutant has an intact fibrinogen binding site. The anti-human αIIbβ3-specific mAbs, OP-G2 (25Tomiyama Y. Tsubakio T. Piotrowicz R.S. Kurata Y. Loftus J.C. Kunicki T.J. Blood. 1992; 79: 2303-2312Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and LJ-CP3 (26Niiya K. Hodson E. Bader R. Byers-Ward V. Koziol J.A. Plow E.F. Ruggeri Z.M. Blood. 1987; 70: 475-483Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), have been shown to have a tripeptide RYD sequence that mimics the RGD sequence in the CDR3 region of the heavy chain (43Taub R. Gould R.J.

Gorski J. Kumar A. Kieber-Emmons T. Kunicki T. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 18085-18092Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (Table I). These mAbs inhibit fibrinogen binding to platelets and fibrinogen-dependent aggregation of platelets. Binding of these mAbs is cation-dependent and is completely blocked by RGD-containing peptides. OP-G2 and LJ-CP3 can bind to nonactivated αIIbβ3, and their binding increases upon activation. The ligand-mimetic properties of these mAbs suggest that they have structural and functional similarities to native ligands (e.g. fibrinogen). Structure-function studies of these mAbs indicate that the RYD sequence in their CDR3 in the heavy chain occupies the same space as RGD in conformationally constrained, bioactive αIIbβ3 ligands (45Prammer K.V. Boyer J. Ugen K. Shattil S.J. Kieber-Emmons T. Receptor. 1994; 4: 93-108PubMed Google Scholar). We studied the effect of swapping mutations on binding of ligand-mimetic mAbs to αIIbβ3 using flow cytometry. Of 27 swapping mutants, only the W2:4-1, W2:2-3, W3:4-1, W3:2-3, W3:3-4, and W4:4-1 swapping mutants abolished binding of OP-G2 and LJ-CP3 (Table II). The mutant W2:1-2 and W5:4-1 partially reduced binding. The other 19 swapping mutants bound OP-G2 and LJ-CP3 at levels comparable to that of wt αIIbβ3 (Table II). These data indicate that swapping the W2:4-1, W2:2-3, W3:4-1, W3:2-3, W3:3-4, and W4:4-1 predicted loops completely blocks binding of ligand-mimetic mAbs. We studied the reactivity of several function-blocking anti-αIIbβ3 mAbs to the swapping mutants to establish whether any changes in their adhesive function might result from a major change in their tertiary structure rather than in the region of contact with fibrinogen or ligand-mimetic antibodies (TableI). All mAbs tested bound to the 21 noninhibitory swapping mutants at a level comparable to that of wt αIIbβ3, indicating that these mutations did not induce gross conformational changes in αIIbβ3. We found that the W2:4-1, W2:2-3, W3:4-1, W3:2-3, and W3:3-4 swapping mutants do not bind to mAbs 2G12, A2A9, AP-2, LJ-CP8, and LJ-P9 (Table II). The W4:4-1 swapping mutant showed significantly reduced binding to mAbs 2G12 and LJ-CP8. These mAbs are all function-blocking, and several of them have been mapped within or close to the putative ligand binding pocket at the α/β boundary (16Puzon-McLaughlin W. Kamata T. Takada Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7795-7802Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Binding of activating mAb PT25-2, which recognizes the non-ligand binding site of αIIb (16Puzon-McLaughlin W. Kamata T. Takada Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7795-7802Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), was not affected by these swapping mutations. Thus it is possible that the W2:4-1, W2:2-3, W3:4-1, W3:2-3, W3:3-4, and W4:4-1 swapping mutations induced local conformational changes within and around the putative ligand binding sites. To identify critical residues for ligand binding, we mutated individual residues within the W2:4-1, W2:2-3, W3:4-1, W3:2-3, W3:3-4, W4:4-1, W4:2-3, and W5:4-1 predicted loops to Ala. We studied the binding of FITC-labeled fibrinogen, or ligand-mimetic mAbs, to CHO cells transiently expressing αIIbβ3 point mutants (Fig.3). We found that the D74A, L84A, F87A, W110A, Q111A, H112A, W113A, N114A, E117A, K124A, T125A, R147A, Y155A, F160A, D163A, K164A, R165A, Y166A, V200A, I203A, F204A, Y207A, S222A, D224A, S226A, F231A, D232A, Y234, W260, L264A, Q284A, and M285A mutations significantly blocked fibrinogen binding (less than 33% of wt). The previously described Y189A, Y190A, F191A, and G193A mutants (18Kamata T. Irie A. Takada Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18610-18615Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) used as controls also blocked fibrinogen binding. In addition, mutating several residues surrounding these critical residues also had a moderate blocking effect on fibrinogen binding (Fig. 3). The effect of point mutations on OP-G2 and LJ-CP3 binding was similar to their effect on fibrinogen binding with several exceptions. The F160A, Q284A, and M285A mutations that block fibrinogen binding did not significantly affect OP-G2 and LJ-CP3 binding (TableIII). The D159A mutation abolished LJ-CP3 binding, but not fibrinogen binding, to αIIbβ3; the mutation probably destroyed the LJ-CP3 epitope (residues 156–162 in αIIb) (TableIII).Table IIIReactivity of selected αIIb point mutants with anti-αIIbβ3 mAbsResiduesOP-G2LJ-CP32G12A2A9AP-2LJ-CP8LJ-P9PT25–2D74A3+2+3+3+3+3+3+4+T83A3+2+4+4+4+4+4+4+L84A3++3+3+3+3+3+3+F87A2++3+3+3+3+3+3+W110A2++2+2+2+3+3+3+Q111A4+3+4+4+4+4+4+4+H112A2+2+3+3+3+3+3+3+W113A++2+2+2+2+2+3+N114A3+2+3+3+3+3+3+4+E117A3+3+4+4+4+4+–4+E121A3+2+4+3+3+4+4+4+K124A2+2+3+3+3+3+3+3+T125A3+2+4+4+4+4+4+4+R147A+–2+2+2+2+2+3+Y155A2++3+3+3+3+3+3+D159A3+–4+4+4+4+4+4+F160A4"

Expression of the operon encoding AT is induced by uncharged tRNATrp. AT associates with TRAP, the trp operon attenuation protein, and inhibits its binding to its target RNA sequences. This relieves TRAP-mediated transcription termination and translation inhibition, increasing the rate of tryptophan biosynthesis. AT binds to TRAP primarily when it is in the tryptophan-activated state. The 53-residue AT polypeptide is homologous to the zinc-binding domain of DnaJ.

Acta. 1997; 1546: 7-9Google Scholar). CT is highly expressed during the perinatal period and the expression of CT is positively associated with hepatic cell division (20Sesca E. Perletti G.P.

Chem. 1997; 272: 13146-13151Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) isolated and characterized the murine CTα gene and demonstrated that the exon/intron organization of the gene corresponded to enzyme functional domains and the gene possessed two transcriptional start sites. Our laboratory has begun studies on the transcriptional regulation of the CTα gene. Bakovic et al. (23Bakovic M. Waite K. Tang W. Tabas I. Vance D.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1438: 147-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) isolated the CTα promoter and characterized its regulatory elements and associated factors. The CTα promoter lacks a TAT(A/C)AAT box but contains GC-rich regions. The 5′-terminal ∼200 bp of the proximal promoter contains four consensus elements for nuclear factor Ap1, overlapping sites for NFκB, E2F, and Elk-1, one sterol response element (24Lagace T.A. Storey M.K. Ridgway N.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14367-14374Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 25Kast H.R. Nguyen C.M. Anisfeld A.M. Ericsson J. Edwards P.A. J. Lipid Res. 2001; 42: 1266-1272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and 3 regulatory GC regions having Sp1-related motifs: a “loose” Sp1 site at −31/−9, a cluster of three overlapping Sp1 sites (−88/−50), and a canonical Sp1-binding site (−148/−128). These three Sp1-binding regions have basal, activator, and suppressor promoter activity, respectively (23Bakovic M. Waite K. Tang W. Tabas I. Vance D.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1438: 147-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Moreover, Sp1, Sp2, and Sp3 can competitively bind to these regions and the relative abundance of these factors dictates overall promoter activity of the CTα gene (26Bakovic M. Waite K. Vance D.E. J. Lipid Res. 2000; 41: 583-594Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). More recently we have shown that transcriptional enhancer factor 4 may stimulate the expression of the CTα gene (27Sugimoto H. Bakovic M. Yamashita S. Vance D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12338-12344Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Lagace et al. (24Lagace T.A. Storey M.K. Ridgway N.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14367-14374Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) have shown that the sterol response element-binding protein stimulates PC biosynthesis indirectly but does not appear to alter transcription of the CTα gene via the sterol response element. In contrast, Kast et al. (25Kast H.R. Nguyen C.M. Anisfeld A.M. Ericsson J. Edwards P.A. J. Lipid Res. 2001; 42: 1266-1272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) reported a functional sterol response element 156 bp upstream of the transcription start site. They reported induction of CTα mRNA and reporter constructs when Chinese hamster ovary cells or THP-1-derived macrophages were cultured in lipoprotein-deficient serum for 24 h. The induction of CT mRNA agrees with results from Ryan et al. (28Ryan A.J. McCoy D.M. Mathuyr S.N. Field F.J. Mallampalli R.K. J. Lipid Res. 2000; 41: 1268-1277Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) who showed that lipoprotein-deficient serum induces CTα mRNA and protein in an alveolar type II epithelial cell line (MLE-12). Whether or not transcriptional regulation of the CTα gene occurs as a consequence of cell division has not been previously investigated. Phospholipid biosynthesis is an important aspect of the cell cycle due to the doubling of PC mass prior to mitosis. PC biosynthesis also increases when quiescent cells are triggered to enter the cell cycle by different types of stimuli (16Tessner T.G. Rock C.O. Kalmar G.B. Cornell R.B. Jackowski S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 16261-16264Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29Warden C.H. Friedkin M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1984; 792: 270-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 30Warden C.H.

J. 1991; 278: 347-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Stimulated PC synthesis was attributed to an increase in either choline kinase activity (29Warden C.H. Friedkin M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1984; 792: 270-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) or in the activity and expression of CT occurring in the first hours after stimulation (16Tessner T.G. Rock C.O. Kalmar G.B.

Cornell R.B. vanGolde L.M.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 214: 927-933Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Earlier studies suggested that a net increase in membrane phospholipid formation may occur sometime after the cells have exited G1when stimulated with either platelet-derived growth factor (33Habenicht A.J.R. Glomset J.A. Goerig M. Gronwald R. Grulich J. Loth U. Schettler G. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 1370-1373Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or concanavalin A + interleukin-2 (34Gross G. Danzel M. Fischer W. Brand K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 962: 220-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). These two studies, however, were not designed to explore the rate of phospholipid synthesis. Jackowski (35Jackowski S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3858-3867Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) demonstrated in a macrophage cell line that PC accumulated during the S phase of the cell cycle, while total CT activity was maximal during G1. In fact, both biosynthesis and catabolism were occurring simultaneously in G1, but subsequently PC degradation was attenuated during S phase leading to a net increase in PC mass (35Jackowski S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3858-3867Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Evidence from our (36Terce F. Brunt H. Vance D.E. J. Lipid Res. 1994; 35: 2130-2142Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and another laboratory (37Cornell R. Grove G.L. Rothblat G.H. Horwitz A.F. Exp. Cell. Res. 1977; 109: 299-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) implicates membrane PC content as an important factor in cell cycle progression through G1 and S phase. Decreased PC synthesis and mass and cell growth arrest in G1 occurs in C3H/10T1/2 fibroblasts, W1–38 fibroblasts, and L6 myoblasts deprived of choline. Choline addition (or lyso-PC, which can rapidly form PC) restored PC content and allowed these cells to progress into S phase. Delipidated serum by itself did not effectively restore cell cycling (36Terce F. Brunt H. Vance D.E. J. Lipid Res. 1994; 35: 2130-2142Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, serum growth factors cannot substitute for choline in cell cycle re-establishment subsequent to choline deprivation. Therefore, PC has an essential role in cell division. In addition, the finding that choline addition during G1 permits normal entry into S phase suggests a PC requirement late in G1 (36Terce F. Brunt H. Vance D.E. J. Lipid Res. 1994; 35: 2130-2142Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The present study demonstrates for the first time that the transcription of the CTα gene is enhanced during the S phase of the cell cycle. C3H10T1/2 mouse embryo fibroblasts, clone 8 (38Reznikoff C.A. Brankow D.W. Heilderberg C. Cancer Res. 1973; 33: 3231-3238PubMed Google Scholar) were provided by Dr. W. J. Vaartjes, Utrecht, The Netherlands. These cells are highly sensitive to post-confluence inhibition of division and can be synchronized in G0 phase by serum deprivation. Cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with penicillin G (100 units/ml), streptomycin (100 μg/ml), and 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) in a 5% CO2humidified incubator at 37 °C. Subconfluent cells were passaged every 3–4 days. Luciferase reporter plasmids containing serial deletions at the 5′-end of the murine CTα gene, LUC.C8 (−201/+38), LUC.D1 (−90/+38), LUC.D2 (−130/+38), and LUC.D3 (−52/+38) have been described (23Bakovic M. Waite K. Tang W. Tabas I. Vance D.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1438: 147-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Cells grown in T75 flasks at 20–30% confluence were co-transfected with the respective CTα promoter-luciferase vector and the pRCMV vector (empty vector with a neomycin resistance cassette) at a 20:1 ratio by the calcium phosphate method (39DiNocera P.P. Dawid I.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 7095-7098Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). The calcium phosphate-DNA precipitates were left on the cells for 48 h prior to splitting the cells into two 100-mm dishes. The cells were then exposed to 1 mg/ml gentamycin (Life Technologies, Inc.). Medium was changed 2–3 times per week. Individual colonies were harvested by typsinization 14–21 days after selection and maintained in the above medium with gentamycin (0.5 mg/ml). Pools of at least 10–15 individual colonies for each construct were screened for stable incorporation of the CTα promoter using luciferase activity assays. Luciferase assays were performed using the Promega assay system, as recommended by the manufacturer and a Lumat L99501 luminometer. Luciferase activity was normalized to the protein content and/or cell number. At least two stable cell lines from each pool containing different length promoter-reporter constructs were chosen for testing luciferase expression during the cell cycle by using the same methodology. The change in promoter activity during different stages of the cell cycle was expressed relative to luciferase expression in quiescent cells or G0 stage of the cell cycle. Cell lines that contained various length promoter-reporter constructs and wild-type C3H10T1/2 cells were plated at a density of ∼2.4 × 103 cells/cm2and grown for 12 h in DMEM with 10% FBS. To synchronize cells in G0 phase of the cell cycle, the cells were maintained for 48 h in a serum-deficient medium (0.5% FBS). The cell cycle was initiated by changing the quiescent cells to DMEM containing normal serum, 10% FBS. The control set for each analysis described was maintained on the serum-deficient medium. Each 1–2 h after serum addition, cells were collected in duplicate for measuring luciferase activity and other cell cycle parameters. Separate duplicate/triplicate experiments were performed for examining different cell cycle parameters such as thymidine incorporation, luciferase assays, CT activity, and mRNA analysis. To define the fraction of cells in different stages of cell growth after serum addition, the synchronized cells were washed with PBS, collected at different time points by trypsinization, fixed in 70% ethanol, and stored at −20 °C. Fluorescent-activated cell sorter analysis was performed at wavelengths between 610 and 630 nm using propidium iodide as a marker for DNA. For the analysis of DNA synthetic rates, [3H]thymidine (0.5 μCi, 1 μm) was added to triplicate 35-mm dishes 1 h before cells were harvested. At each time point, the medium was aspirated and the cells were washed three times with ice-cold PBS and treated with 10% ice-cold trichloroacetic acid for 10 min on ice to precipitate DNA. The dishes were washed twice with 10% trichloroacetic acid and the precipitated material was scraped into 0.2% SDS in 0.1n NaOH. Radioactivity associated with the trichloroacetic acid precipitate was measured by liquid scintillation spectrometry. Cells grown to different stages of the cell cycle were collected from duplicate 150-mm dishes and total mRNA was isolated by using the TRIZOL reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.). 3 μg of total RNA was reverse transcribed using Superscript II reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies, Inc.) and subjected to 30 cycles of PCR amplification (95 °C for 1 min, 45 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 2 min). The CTα specific primers used were 5′-ATGCACAGTGTTCAGCCAA-3′ (forward) and 5′-GGGCTTACTAAAGTCAACTTCAA-3′ (reverse) and they produce an ∼200-bp CTα fragment. Cyclophilin primers 5′-TCTTCTTGCTGGTCTTGCCATTCC-3′ (forward) and 5′-TCCAAAGACAGCAGAAAACTT-3′ (reverse) were used to generate a 308-bp product to serve as a RT-PCR control (PCR conditions: 33 cycles at 94 °C for 1 min, 60 °C for 2 min, 72 °C for 2 min). Proteins from cell lysates collected during different stages of the cell cycle (20 μg of protein/lane) were resolved by electrophoresis on SDS- (8 or 10%) polyacrylamide gels and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Immunoblotting for CTα was performed by incubation of the membranes with a polyclonal antibody against 45 amino acids of the C-terminal phosphorylation domain of CTα (provided by Prof. Martin Post, Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, Canada) (40Yang J. Wang J. Tseu I. Kuliszewski M. Lee W. Post M. Biochem. J. 1997; 325: 29-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). This antibody does not cross-react with CTβ isoforms because of sequence divergence in the C-terminal phosphorylation domain (12Lydidis A. Murti K.G. Jackowski S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14022-14039Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 13Lykidis A. Baburina I. Jackowski S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26992-27001Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). The secondary antibody was goat anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to horseradish peroxidase. Immunoreactive bands were analyzed by the chemiluminescence method according to the manufacturer's instructions (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). CT activity during the cell cycle progression was assayed in C3H10T1/2 fibroblast homogenates by measuring the incorporation of [3H]phosphocholine into CDP-[3H]choline. The cells were washed three times with ice-cold PBS and scraped with a rubber policeman into homogenizing buffer consisting of: 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 mm NaF, 100 μm Na3VO4, and 100 μg/ml each of leupeptin and aprotinin. Cells were sonicated for 25 s at 4 °C and the sonicate was stored at −20 °C or −70 °C. The standard CT assay contained 25 μg of cell protein mixed in a buffer with 57.8 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 40 mm NaCl, 1.78 mm EDTA, 8.9 mm magnesium acetate, 1.5 mm [3H]phosphocholine, 3 mm CTP, and 0.2 mm phosphatidylcholineoleate (1:1) vesicles in a final volume of 100 μl. The incubations were for 15 min at 37 °C and the reactions were stopped by transferring the tubes into an 80 °C water bath for 2 min. Samples were centrifuged at 2000 rpm for 5 min in a bench-top centrifuge and an aliquot of supernatant was spotted on Silica Gel 60 thin-layer plates. Plates were developed in a solvent system of methanol, 0.6% NaCl and concentrated NH4OH (10:10:0.9, v/v). CDP-[3H]choline formation was identified by co-migration with a standard, scraped from the plate, and quantified by liquid scintillation spectrometry. Cells grown in duplicate 100-mm dishes were labeled for 10 min at 37 °C with 5 μCi/ml [methyl-3H]choline (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Incorporation of label was stopped by removing the medium, washing the cells three times with ice-cold buffer (50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.15 m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA), and rapidly freezing the cells at −20 °C. Cells were harvested in PBS, pelleted by centrifugation, re-suspended in PBS, and sonicated. Lipids were extracted and PC purified by thin-layer chromatography on Silica Gel G-60 plates with chloroform/methanol/acetic acid/formic acid/water (70:30:12:4:1) as a developing solvent. PC was visualized by iodine vapor, scraped from the plate, and the radioactivity in PC was measured by liquid scintillation spectrometry. For PC mass determination, cells were cultured and harvested as described above, except the radioactivity was omitted. PC mass was determined by measuring the phosphorus content (41Rouser G. Siakotos A.N. Fleisher S. Lipids. 1966; 1: 85-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (1319) Google Scholar). Incubation at a low serum concentration (0.5% FBS) for 48 h arrested C3H10T1/2 fibroblasts at the G0/G1 stage of the cell cycle, which represented between 70 and 75% of the cells as determined by fluorescent-activated cell sorter analysis (Fig.1). The incorporation of [3H]thymidine into DNA was negligible in the serum-starved cells (Fig. 2). The addition of 10% FBS resulted in a wave of [3H]thymidine incorporation beginning 12–14 h after addition of serum, peaking at 22 h, and declining thereafter.Figure 2Incorporation of [3H]thymidine into acid-insoluble material at different times after the addition of FBS to quiescent C3H10T1/2 cells. Cells were incubated with [3H]thymidine for 1 h at various times after the addition of 10% FBS to cultured fibroblasts and harvested. The data represent the mean ± S.E. for three experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We tested the expression of CTα mRNA by RT-PCR analysis of total RNA isolated from cells at time 0 and at various times during the cell cycle. As shown in Fig. 3, the level of mRNA was increased at 16 and 20 h post-addition of serum coincident with the peak of [3H]thymidine incorporation into DNA. The levels of mRNA for cyclophilin remained constant during this time period. We next utilized CTα promoter-reporter assays to test if the increase in CTα mRNA during the cell cycle might be due to enhanced transcriptional activity of the CTα gene. The activity of different CTα promoter-luciferase constructs was tested after stable expression. C3H10T1/2 cells were shown previously to contain adequate levels of nuclear factors to support the activation of the CTα promoter-luciferase constructs (23Bakovic M. Waite K. Tang W. Tabas I. Vance D.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1438: 147-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig.4, for the −201/+38 promoter, addition of 10% FBS to quiescent cells resulted in increased luciferase activity beginning at 10–12 h post-serum stimulation, peaking at 20–24 h and declining thereafter. This rise in reporter activity was coincident, within experimental error, with the increase in CTα mRNA at 16–20 h (Fig. 3).Figure 4Luciferase reporter activity throughout the cell cycle with the C8 (−201/+38) CTαpromoter. A cell line stably transfected with a CTα (−201/+38) luciferase reporter construct was incubated in DMEM + 0.5% FBS for 48 h followed by addition of FBS to a final concentration of 10%. Relative luciferase activity at various time points post-serum stimulation was calculated as a ratio of luciferase activity at a time point versus the luciferase activity at t = 0 (quiescent cells, before serum addition). The results are the mean ± S.E. for six to seven experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Previously we established that the removal of sequences 5′ to position −201 in the CTα promoter did not significantly alter luciferase expression (−201/+38 versus −2086/+38) (23Bakovic M. Waite K. Tang W. Tabas I. Vance D.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1438: 147-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). In the current experiments, deletion of 71 bp in the 3′ direction (−201/+38 versus −130/+38) resulted in an average 45% reduction in reporter activity (Fig. 5 compared with Fig. 4). The time post-serum addition for the increase in −130/+38-luciferase reporter activity was similar to CTα mRNA (Fig. 3) and the −201/+38-luciferase reporter construct (Fig. 4). A more truncated promoter (−52/+38) did not show a change in luciferase activity during the cell cycle (Fig. 6). Also shown in Fig. 6 are the results from other cell lines that stably expressed one of the promoter constructs. From the results in Figs.Figure 4, Figure 5, Figure 6, we established that the promoter regulatory elements between −52 and −130 are involved in positive regulation of CTα transcription during the late G1/S phase of the cell cycle.Figure 6Maximum luciferase reporter activities for various cell lines that stably expressed CT α promoter constructs. Luciferase activities were measured in two cell lines (C8-3 and C8-10) that express the −201/+35 luciferase reporter, two cell lines (D2-10 and D2-22) that express the -130/+38 luciferase reporter, and three cell lines (D3-1, D3-3, and D3-1B) that express the -52/+38 luciferase reporter after the addition of 10% FBS to quiescent C3H10T1/2 cells in culture. The maximal activity obtained during a cell cycle is plotted. The results are the mean ± S.E. for five experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Thus, we conclude that there is enhanced transcription of the CTα gene occurring during the S phase of the cell cycle in C3H10T1/2 murine fibroblasts. The promoter elements between −130 and −52 are required for this regulation. The incorporation of [3H]choline into PC was stimulated 2-fold between 6 and 8 h after the addition of 10% FBS compared with that in quiescent cells in 0.5% FBS (Fig. 7 A). Incorporation of label increased until 16–18 h at which time there was a 4-fold increase compared with early time points. Subsequently, there was a decline in [3H]choline incorporation to basal levels at 24 h after the addition of serum. The mass of PC also increased (Fig. 7 B). CT activity (Fig. 8) was also enhanced more than 2-fold compared with quiescent cells (t = 0) 6 h after the addition of serum. CT enzyme activity continued to rise gradually for an additional 16 h, at which time there was a 4-fold increase versus quiescent cells. By 24 h CT activity was still 2-fold higher than observed at time 0. We report for the first time regulation of the transcriptional expression of an enzyme in mammalian phospholipid biosynthesis during the cell cycle. Intuitively one might have expected increased transcription would occur prior to enhanced PC biosynthesis that has been shown to be required for cell division (36Terce F. Brunt H. Vance D.E. J. Lipid Res. 1994; 35: 2130-2142Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Our studies clearly show this is not the case. Increased PC synthesis occurs during the G1 phase of the cell cycle prior to enhanced transcription of the CTα gene that occurs during the S phase of the cell cycle. This result is in line with the long-held view that PC synthesis can be rapidly modulated by reversible binding of CTα to cellular membranes (1Vance D.E. Vance D.E. Phosphatidylcholine Metabolism.

Thus, cells can respond to a need for PC in seconds without the need for an increase in transcription/translation. Since PC is critical for cell survival (36Terce F. Brunt H. Vance D.E. J. Lipid Res. 1994; 35: 2130-2142Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 45Esko J.D. Wermuth M.M. Raetz C.R.H. J. Biol.

Che. 1996; 271: 14668-14671Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar) such a rapid mechanism for regulating PC synthesis might have had evolutionary value. The increase in CTα transcription during the S phase appears to be important for increasing the level of CTα in a cell in preparation for cell division. The major increase in [3H]choline incorporation into PC occurred during the G1 phase of the cell cycle. This observation agrees with studies in a macrophage cell line that is dependent on colony stimulating factor (16Tessner T.G. Rock C.O. Kalmar G.B. Cornell R.B. Jackowski S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 16261-16264Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 35Jackowski S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3858-3867Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Our results with respect to mRNA measurements were different from those reported with the macrophage cell line (16Tessner T.G. Rock C.O. Kalmar G.B. Cornell R.B. Jackowski S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 16261-16264Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We observed no increase in CTα mRNA until the S phase whereas a rapid increase in CT mRNA (CTβ was not known in 1991) was reported in the macrophage cell line shortly after the addition of colony stimulating factor. This increase in mRNA was attributed to enhanced stability but CT transcription rates were not measured (16Tessner T.G. Rock C.O. Kalmar G.B. Cornell R.B. Jackowski S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 16261-16264Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The subcellular location of CTα during the cell cycle was studied in IIC9 fibroblasts when serum was added to quiescent cells (47Northwood I.C. Tong A.H.Y. Crawford B. Drobnies A.E. Cornell R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26240-26248Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). They found a redistribution of CTα from the nucleus to the endoplasmic reticulum early in G1that correlated with rapid synthesis of PC. In contrast, such a re-distribution was not observed in other cell lines with CTα tagged with green fluorescent protein (48DeLong C.J. Qin L. Cui Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32325-32330Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). All the studies agree that there is a stimulation of PC biosynthesis in the G1 phase of the cell cycle. Despite dozens of immunoblots with different antibodies to CTα, we were not able to obtain sufficient specificity to have confidence in these experiments. Thus, although the same antibody had little to no cross-reactivity with homogenates of Chinese hamster ovary cells, we obtained ∼10 immunoreacting bands in extracts from C3H10T1/2 fibroblasts. Thus, we could not measure the amount of CTα protein in these experiments nor could we study the state of phosphorylation. The studies reported in this paper provide the basis for future investigations on identification of the trans-activating factors responsible for enhanced transcription of the CTα gene during the S phase of the cell cycle. The two obvious candidates are Sp1 and transcription enhancer factor 4, both of which have been shown to bind in the −130/−52 region of the CTα promoter (23Bakovic M. Waite K. Tang W. Tabas I. Vance D.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1438: 147-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 27Sugimoto H. Bakovic M. Yamashita S. Vance D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12338-12344Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The −90/−52 region of the CTα promoter contains a multiple binding site for Sp1 which enhanced luciferase expression (23Bakovic M. Waite K. Tang W. Tabas I. Vance D.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1438: 147-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Another Sp1 element (−144 to −136, antisense orientation) attenuated CTα promoter activity in both C3H10T1/2 and RH-7777 McArdle cells when transiently transfected with the −201/+38 promoter construct (23Bakovic M. Waite K. Tang W. Tabas I. Vance D.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1438: 147-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). In those studies, the deletion of 71 bp (−201/+38 versus−130/+38) resulted in a 2.5–3-fold enhanced expression of the reporter gene. Thus, the increased promoter activity observed in this study with the −201/+38 promoter construct (compared with the −130/+38 construct) during the S phase of the cell cycle in the C3H10T1/2 cells was unexpected and the mechanism of activation is unclear. It is known that silencers can exert negative control on constitutive promoters in many genes but the exact mechanism is not well defined (49). It may be that these silencers are down-regulated during the cell cycle or inhibited during the S phase of the cell cycle. Alternatively, there may be differences in promoter activation in this region in stable (this study) versus transiently transfected cells (49). Moreover, when the −201/+38 construct was co-transfected with a Sp1 expression construct (pPacSp1) into Sp1-deficient Drosophila Schneider 2 cells, a marked increase in luciferase activity was noted (−202/+38 versus−130/+38) (26Bakovic M. Waite K. Vance D.E. J. Lipid Res. 2000; 41: 583-594Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Clearly, there is much to be learned about the relationships among the various elements in the CTα promoter and the trans-acting factors. In conclusion, increased transcription of the CTα gene occurs during the S phase of the cell cycle in C3H10T1/2 cells. This increase provides sufficient enzyme for PC biosynthesis in both daughter cells after mitosis.

Hydrophobicity analysis of GPAT predicts two transmembrane domains (TMDs), residues 472–493 and 576–592. Residues 224–323 correspond to the active site of the enzyme, which is believed to lie on the cytosolic face of the outer mitochondrial membrane. Protease treatment of rat liver mitochondria revealed that GPAT has a membrane-protected segment of 14 kDa that could correspond to the mass of the two predicted TMDs plus a loop between aa 494 and 575. Recombinant GPAT constructs containing tagged epitopes were transiently expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells and immunolocalized. Both the C and N termini epitope tags could be detected after selective permeabilization of only the plasma membrane, indicating that both termini face the cytosol. A 6–8-fold increase in GPAT-specific activity in the transfected cells confirmed correct protein folding and orientation. When the C terminus and loop-tagged GPAT construct was immunoassayed, the epitope at the C terminus could be detected when the plasma membrane was permeabilized, but loop-epitope accessibility required disruption of the outer mitochondrial membrane. Similar results were observed when GPAT was truncated before the second TMD, again consistent with an orientation in which the loop faces the mitochondrial intermembrane space. Although protease digestion of the HA-tagged loop resulted in preservation of a 14-kDa fragment, consistent with a membrane protected loop domain, neither the truncated nor loop-tagged enzymes conferred GPAT activity when overexpressed, suggesting that the loop plays a critical structural or regulatory role for GPAT function. Based on these data, we propose a GPAT topography model with two transmembrane domains in which both the N (aa 1–471) and C (aa 593–end) termini face the cytosol and a single loop (aa 494–575) faces the intermembrane space.

Nutr. 2000; 20: 77-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). Mammalian cells contain two GPAT isozymes that have different cellular locations, one in the endoplasmic reticulum and the other in mitochondria, that can be distinguished by sensitivity to inactivation by sulfhydryl reagents. The mitochondrial GPAT is an outer mitochondrial membrane (OMM) protein composing about 10% of the total enzymatic activity in most mammalian tissues. In liver, however, GPAT specific activity is similar in the two subcellular organelles. Only the mitochondrial GPAT isoform has been cloned. Recombinant mouse (3Yet S.-F. Lee S. Hahm Y.T. Sul H.S. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 9486-9491Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) and rat (4Bhat B.G. Wang P. Kim J.-H. Black T.M. Lewin T.M. Fiedorek T.F. Coleman R.A. Biochim. Biophys.

Alignment of rat mitochondrial GPAT with other acyltransferases shows four homology blocks (5Lewin T.M. Wang P. Coleman R.A. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 5764-5771Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar), and when conserved amino acids within these regions are mutated, GPAT activity is altered or abolished (5Lewin T.M. Wang P. Coleman R.A. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 5764-5771Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar, 6Heath R.J. Rock C.O. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 1425-1430Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7Dircks L.K.

Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 1944-1946Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Kinetic studies using recombinant GPAT with site-directed mutations in this region identify specific amino acids that contribute to substrate binding or to catalysis. Thus, it was surprising that a recent report in this journal did not include information on these extensive studies but concluded that the active site region of GPAT lay in a domain on the side of the mitochondrial membrane opposite to the substrate binding and catalytic domains (9Balija B.S. Chakraborty T.R. Nikonov A.V. Morimoto T. Haldar D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 31668-31673Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Identification of the structure and orientation of membrane proteins is essential to elucidate enzyme interactions with substrates and products, especially when these are also hydrophobic. Furthermore, knowledge of the orientation of membrane domains is critical in determining their accessibility to regulatory signals. To clarify the orientation of mitochondrial GPAT and the topography of its active site in the OMM, we used native mitochondria and recombinant epitope-tagged proteins expressed in cultured CHO cells to probe the positions of the different domains. Rabbit polyclonal anti-GPAT antibody raised against the gel-purified protein expressed in bacteria was commercially produced by Immunodynamics, La Jolla, CA. Monoclonal antibodies against the epitopes used were from Sigma (anti-FLAG), Invitrogen (Carlsbad, CA, anti-Myc), and Covance (Princeton, NJ; anti-HA). Mitochondrial marker Mito-Tracker CMX-Ros was from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). Tissue culture and transfection media and reagents were from Life Technologies-Invitrogen (Princeton, NJ). Proteases and protease inhibitors were purchased from Sigma and Life Technologies. Female (150–200 g) Sprague-Dawley rats were housed on a 12-h/12-h light/dark cycle with free access to water and fed ad libitum with Purina rat chow. They were then fasted for 48 h and refed for 24 h with a high sucrose (69.5%), low fat (0.5%) diet (Dyets Inc.) to up-regulate mitochondrial GPAT expression (10Shin D.-H. Paulauskis J.D. Moustaid N. Sul H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 23834-23839Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Animals were killed by CO2 narcosis. After dissection, livers were immediately placed on ice and homogenized in Buffer A (0.25m sucrose, 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 10 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol). Mitochondria were isolated by differential centrifugation (11Fleischer S. McIntyre J.O. Vidal J.C. Methods Enzymol. 1979; 55: 32-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), resuspended in Buffer A, and stored in aliquots at −80 °C. Protein concentrations were determined by the BCA method (Pierce) using bovine serum albumin as the standard. Mitochondria were analyzed for protease-protected fragments after preincubation with buffer (Control) or with 1% Triton X-100 to disrupt the OMM. The integrity of the OMM was determined by measuring the activity of the intermembrane space marker, adenylate kinase (12Schnaitman C. Greenawalt J.W. J. Cell Biol. 1968; 38: 158-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (1010) Google Scholar). To determine the accessibility of GPAT domains to protease, 350 μg of mitochondrial protein was then incubated in a final volume of 0.1 ml with selected proteases. For proteinase K, 20 μg of protease was added with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.25 m sucrose, and 2 mm CaCl2 for 30 min on ice. The reaction was stopped by adding 1 mm AEBSF (4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride), 2 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 100 μm leupeptin, and 2 μg/ml aprotinin. After 5 min the samples were centrifuged at 11,000 × g for 5 min, and the pellet was used for immunodetection of GPAT fragments. For Glu-C endoproteinase (V8 protease), the mitochondria (350 μg of protein) were incubated with 0.062 V8 protease units in 50 mm ammonium acetate buffer, pH 4.0, for 90 min at 22 °C. The reaction was stopped by adding 0.1 mm 2,4-diisochlorocoumarin and incubating for 5 min on ice. For chymotrypsin, mitochondria (350 μg of protein) were incubated with 20 μg of the protease in 0.125 m sucrose, 0.5 mm CaCl2, and 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, at 22 °C for 30 min. The reaction was stopped by adding 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. For trypsin, mitochondria (200 μg) were incubated with 25 μg/ml protease in 0.125m sucrose and 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, at 22 °C for 20 min. The reaction was stopped with the addition of 2 mg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor. Four GPAT constructs were made (Fig. 3). The cDNA encoding the complete open reading frame of rat liver mitochondrial GPAT (4Bhat B.G. Wang P. Kim J.-H. Black T.M. Lewin T.M. Fiedorek T.F. Coleman R.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1439: 415-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) was first subcloned in pcDNA3.1 (Invitrogen) digested withBamHI-XhoI (pcDNA3.1-GPAT). A FLAG epitope at the C terminus was added by a two-step polymerase chain reaction procedure in which the 30 nucleotides encoding the epitope, anXbaI restriction site, and a stop codon were added at the 3′ end of the open reading frame (13Igal, R. A., Wang, S., Gonzalez-Baro, M., and Coleman, R. A. (August 23, 2001) J. Biol. Chem.10.1074/jbc.M103386200.Google Scholar). The polymerase chain reaction product was then inserted in the BamHI-XbaI sites of the multicloning site of pcDNA3.1. This construct pcDNA3.1-GPAT-FLAG is referred to as GFLAG. To insert hemagglutinin (HA) epitopes, mutagenesis was performed using the Gene Editor system (Promega). For the mutagenic reactions, GPAT-FLAG (BamHI-XbaI) was subcloned into pGEM-11Zf(+) (Promega), and this construct, pGEM11Z-GPAT-FLAG, was used as a template. The HA epitope was inserted near the N terminus after amino acid 33 using a mutagenic primer (75 nucleotides) that contains the 27 nucleotides (in bold in the nucleotide sequence below) that encode the HA epitope (YPYDVPDYA) flanked with 22 GPAT cDNA complementary bases at the 5′ end and 26 bases at the 3′ end. The sequence of the mutagenic primer was: ATGTAAACACACGAATGAGGACTACCCATATGACGTCCCGGACTACGCCTGGGTTGACTGTGGCTTCAAACCTAC. Correct insertion of the epitope was corroborated by DNA sequencing and by restriction digestion with NdeI (the NdeI site is underlined in the mutagenic primer sequences). The mutated plasmid, pGEM11f(+)-GPAT-FLAG-HA33, was then digested with BamHI andXbaI and subcloned into the BamHI-XbaI sites of pcDNA3.1 to generate pcDNA3.1-GPAT-FLAG-HA33 (HA33). Insertion of the HA after amino acid 496 was performed similarly, using the mutagenic primer (74 nucleotides long) GCCTGCTCCTCTACAGACACTACCCATATGACGTCCCGGACTACGCCAGGCAGGGA- ATCCACCTCTCCACGCTG to obtain the construct pGEM11f(+)-GPAT-FLAG-HA496. After subcloning into pcDNA 3.1, the construct pcDNA3.1-GPAT-FLAG-HA496 (HA496) was obtained. To construct GPAT truncated after amino acid 576, pcDNA3.1-GPAT was used as a template for polymerase chain reaction. A 5′ primer contained the BamHI site and the first bases of the GPAT open reading frame, and a 3′ primer contained an XhoI site and 21 complementary bases to the GPAT codons that encode amino acids 570- 576. The polymerase chain reaction product was then subcloned in theBamHI-XhoI sites of the plasmid pcDNA3.1-Myc-His (Invitrogen). The construct pcDNA3.1-GPATtr576-Myc (Tr576Myc) was confirmed by DNA sequencing. CHO K1 cells were grown in minimum essential medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin at 37 °C with 5% CO2. Cells were grown in 100-mm dishes to 70–80% confluence and then transfected with the constructs GFLAG, HA33, HA496, and Tr576Myc or with the empty vector pcDNA3.1. Cationic liposomes (LipofectAMINE, Life technologies) were used following the product instructions. After 27 h, the cells were harvested, homogenized in Buffer A, and centrifuged at 20,000 ×g for 20 min. The cellular particulate pellet was resuspended in buffer A, separated into aliquots, and stored at −80 °C. Protein was determined using bovine serum albumin as a standard (14Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Immunocytochemistry was performed as described (15Lin S. Cheng D. Liu M.S. Chen J. Chang T.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23276-23285Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). CHO K1 cells (106 cells) were seeded in sterile 100-mm tissue culture dishes, each containing 4–5 sterile glass coverslips, incubated at 37 °C until they reached 70% confluence, and then transfected with the epitope-tagged GPAT constructs. After 27 h, the cells were washed in PBS and incubated for 25 min with 0.1 μm Texas red mitochondrial marker in culture media. The cells were then rinsed with PBS and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min at 23 °C. After washing in PBS, cells were permeabilized with 5 μg/ml digitonin in buffer B (0.3 m sucrose, 25 mm MgCl2, 0.1 m KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm PIPES, pH 6.8) for 5 min on ice or with 1% Triton X-100 in PBS for 30 min at 23 °C. Cells were incubated in the following dilutions of the primary antibody: 1:1000 of anti-FLAG, 1:500 of anti-HA, and 1:500 of anti-Myc. After a 60-min incubation, cells were washed in PBS and incubated for 45 min in a 1:200 dilution of the fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated secondary antibody:goat anti-mouse IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Finally, cells were washed in PBS and the coverslips mounted. Cells were visualized with a Zeiss LSH 210 fluorescence microscope equipped with green and blue filters. The mitochondrial protease digestion products were separated on a 4–20% gradient (8% for the cellular particulate of CHO cells expressing recombinant GPAT) polyacrylamide gel containing 1% SDS and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Bio-Rad). For chemiluminescent detection, immunoreactive bands were visualized by incubating the membrane with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit and anti-mouse IgG and PicoWest reagents (Pierce). GPAT was assayed in rat liver mitochondria (20–80 μg of protein) and in total particulate preparations from CHO cells expressing the recombinant GPAT constructs (40–80 μg of protein). The assay was performed at 23 °C with 300 μm[3H]glycerol 3-phosphate and 112.5 μmpalmitoyl-CoA in the presence or absence of 1 mm N-ethylmaleimide to inhibit the microsomal isoform (16Coleman R.A. Haynes E.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 450-465Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Microsomal GPAT was estimated by subtracting theN-ethylmaleimide-resistant activity (mitochondrial GPAT) from the total. All assays measured initial rates (5Lewin T.M. Wang P. Coleman R.A. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 5764-5771Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). [3H]Glycerol-3-phosphate was synthesized enzymatically (17Chang Y.-Y. Kennedy E.P. J. Lipid Res. 1967; 8: 447-455Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). GPAT activity was also assayed with immobilized palmitoyl-CoA on agarose beads (180 μm) (Sigma) using rat liver mitochondria or CHO cell total particulate preparations under isosmotic conditions (intact) or hyposmotic conditions (10 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.4), which disrupted the OMM. Disruption of the OMM was monitored by loss of adenylate kinase activity. The GPAT amino acid sequence deduced from the cDNA complete open reading frame was examined using algorithms that predict the possible location of TMDs based on the hydrophobicity of the residues. Four different programs available on the Internet (TMPred (18Hofmann K. Stoffel W. Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler. 1993; 374: 166Google Scholar), TMHMM (19Sonnhammer E.L.L. von Heijne G. Krogh A. Proc. Int. Conf. Intell. Syst. Mol. Biol. 1998; 6: 175-182PubMed Google Scholar), DAS (20Cserzo M. Wallin E. Simon I. von Heijne G. Elofsson A. Protein Eng. 1997; 10: 673-676Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and SOSUI) strongly predicted the presence of two TMDs between amino acids 472–493 and 576–592 (Fig.1 A). These two TMDs were the only ones predicted by TMHMM and SOSUI. These programs also identify three non-membrane segments: an N-terminal region (aa 1–471), a loop region (aa 494–575), and a C-terminal region (aa 593–828). DAS and TMPred predict two additional TMDs between residues 184–203 and 235–254. These predicted TMDs have lower scores, and because the region aa 235–254 lies between two highly conserved regions that correspond to the active site of GPAT (5Lewin T.M. Wang P. Coleman R.A. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 5764-5771Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar, 6Heath R.J. Rock C.O. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 1425-1430Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8Heath R.J. Rock C.O. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 1944-1946Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), this predicted TMD is highly improbable because it would cause portions of the active site to lie on opposite faces of the OMM. The TMD predicted for aa 184–203 is the only possible one between the N terminus and the active site domain. Specific experiments were carried out to determine the existence of this TMD and the two prime TMD predictions. When rat liver mitochondria were treated with different specific and nonspecific proteases and the reaction products were blotted with a polyclonal anti-full-length GPAT antibody, several immunoreactive bands were detected (Fig.2, A–C), suggesting that the OMM had acted as a barrier for the proteolysis. One of the bands (13.5/16 kDa) corresponds approximately to the size of the loop plus the two TMDs (calculated: 13.6 kDa). The higher molecular mass bands (23, 26, 28, and 31 kDa) might result from incomplete hydrolysis of protected sites within nearby membrane-associated regions. As previously reported (21Hesler C.B. Carroll M.A. Haldar D. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 7452-7456Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), trypsin did not hydrolyze GPAT unless the OMM was disrupted (Fig. 2 D). To determine the orientation of GPAT, several constructs were designed to contain specific epitopes in the domains delimited by the two TMDs or truncations of GPAT proximal to the second TMD (Fig. 1 B). CHO K1 cells were transiently transfected with these constructs, and the expression of GPAT was monitored by Western blot both with the specific antibodies for the epitopes (anti-FLAG, anti-HA, and anti-Myc) and with assays for GPAT activity (Fig.3). Although the four proteins corresponding to the different constructs were expressed with the correct predicted molecular weights, only the GPAT transfectants with epitopes added at the C terminus (GFLAG) or near the N terminus (HA33) were active. Compared with vector-transfected control cells membranes, GFLAG and HA33 cells had 6–8-fold increases in mitochondrial GPAT specific activity. Cells transfected with GPAT constructs containing the HA epitope in the loop (HA496) or with the truncated construct (Tr576Myc), however, expressed GPAT activity similar to the vector-transfected control. This lack of activity was surprising because neither of the loop constructs was near the active site domain, and in both, the active site domain remained on the opposite, cytosolic side of the OMM (see below). Because previous studies indicated that the active site of GPAT faces the cytosol (21Hesler C.B. Carroll M.A. Haldar D. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 7452-7456Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Dircks L.K. Sul H.S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1348: 17-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 23Chakraborty T.R. Vancura A. Balija V.S. Haldar D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29786-29790Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), we tested GPAT activity in CHO cell total particulate preparations by using immobilized palmitoyl-CoA as a substrate to corroborate the correct insertion of the recombinant proteins (Table I). GPAT was able to access agarose-bound palmitoyl-CoA under isosmotic conditions when the OMM was intact, showing that the active site of the enzyme faces the cytosol and can interact with agarose beads that cannot cross the membrane. Furthermore, disruption of the OMM under hyposmotic conditions did not increase GPAT activity, indicating a lack of latency of GPAT activity. The integrity of the OMM under each condition was confirmed by assaying the activity of the intermembrane marker, adenylate kinase. Full adenylate kinase activity was present in the membranes treated with isosmotic buffer, whereas 75% of adenylate kinase activity was lost after incubation with the hyposmotic buffer. Similar results were obtained when we tested the GPAT activity in intact and hyposmotic-swelled rat liver mitochondria. GPAT specific activity in intact mitochondria (adenylate kinase 100% active) was 0.62 nmol/min/mg of protein and in OMM-disrupted mitochondria (adenylate kinase 22% active) was 0.58 nmol/min/mg of protein.Table IThe active site of GPAT faces the cytosolIsotonicHypotonicGPAT-FLAGGPAT activity0.280.26AK activity (%)10025GPAT-HA33GPAT activity0.300.30AK activity (%)10023N-Ethylmaleimide-resistant (mitochondrial) GPAT activity was measured with agarose-immobilized palmitoyl-CoA as a substrate in total particulate preparations from CHO cells expressing GPAT-FLAG and GPAT-HA33 after either disruption by hypotonic swelling or incubation under isotonic conditions.

In each of the epitope- tagged GPAT transfectants, the location of each epitope relative to the OMM was determined by probing with specific fluorescent antibodies after digitonin or Triton X-100 treatment. Digitonin permeabilizes only the plasma membrane, whereas Triton X-100 permeabilizes intracellular membranes, including the OMM (24Roitelman J. Olender E.H. Bar-Nun S. Dunn W.A. Simoni R.D. J.

We confirmed this differential permeabilization by examining the susceptibility of adenylate kinase to protease digestion. When cells were incubated with 50 μg/ml proteinase K and then permeabilized with digitonin, adenylate kinase activity in both total cellular particulate and intact CHO cells was 100% of control activity, showing a lack of protease entry into the intermembrane space. In contrast, cells or total cellular particulate fractions permeabilized with 1% Triton X-100 lost 75% of the adenylate kinase activity, indicating disruption of the OMM that allowed proteinase K to have access to the enzyme. Fluorescent images for the FLAG, HA, and Myc epitope antibodies (green) or the mitochondrial marker (red) were analyzed either after the plasma membrane was permeabilized with digitonin or after the intracellular membranes were permeabilized with Triton X-100 (Fig.4). Specificity of the antibody signal was tested by probing control CHO cells transfected with the empty plasmid with both the primary antibody (anti-HA, anti-FLAG, or anti-Myc) and the fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled secondary antibody. CHO cells expressing the epitope-tagged GPAT constructs were also probed with only the secondary antibody. In both cases, the fluorescent signal remained at background values (results not shown). The CHO cells expressing recombinant epitope-tagged GPAT exhibited an antibody-staining pattern within discrete structures in the cytoplasm, similar to the mitochondrial localization signal. The results show that the C terminus of GPAT faces the cytosol, because in the full-length GPAT construct tagged in the C terminus (GFLAG), this epitope was recognized in digitonin-treated cells when only the plasma membrane was permeabilized (Fig. 4). As expected, no change in staining was observed when these cells were permeabilized with Triton X-100. Similarly, the full-length GPAT containing an HA epitope near the N terminus (HA33) could be probed with anti-HA antibody after permeabilization with either digitonin or Triton X-100, showing that in this construct the N terminus is exposed to the cytosol. Both GFLAG and HA33 transfectants expressed high GPAT activity (8- and 6-fold more than control cells) (Fig. 3) and had their active sites exposed on the cytosolic surface, as evidenced by activity with agarose-linked palmitoyl-CoA substrate (Table I). These data indicate that the N and C termini and the active site of GPAT all face the cytosolic face of the OMM. Two constructs were made to test the presence of the putative loop between residues 472–493 and 576–592. CHO cells transfected with HA496 were identified with the HA antibody only after permeabilization with Triton X-100 but not after digitonin. This difference indicates that the HA epitope was not accessible to the antibody unless the OMM was disrupted. As was observed in GFLAG and HA33 transfectants, the C-terminal FLAG epitope present in the HA496 transfectants remained accessible to the FLAG antibody in digitonin-permeabilized cells, indicating that the C terminus of this construct was in its usual position on the cytoplasmic face of the OMM. The correct orientation of the GPAT-HA496 construct was further verified in total membrane fractions obtained from CHO cells that expressed HA496. When these membranes were exposed to proteinase K, anti-HA antibody detected a membrane-protected fragment whose molecular mass (∼14 kDa) matches the calculated molecular mass of the loop plus the two TMDs (Fig.5). This fragment did not react with the anti-FLAG antibody, consistent with protease degradation of the FLAG epitope and C terminus on the cytosolic face of the OMM. Adenylate kinase activity corroborated the integrity of the OMM. Similarly with the second loop construct, Tr576Myc, which is truncated just before the second TMD, cells became stained with the Myc antibody only after intracellular membranes had been disrupted with Triton X-100; the Myc epitope was not accessible to the antibody in cells permeabilized with digitonin, indicating that the shortened C terminus was located in the intermembrane space. Taken as a whole, these results indicate that GPAT C- and N-terminal domains are located in the cytosolic face of the OMM and that the loop lies in the intermembrane space. The mitochondrial isoform of GPAT is an intrinsic membrane protein (1Bell R.M. Coleman R.A. Annu. Rev.

https://openalex.org/W2103285380,"The fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR)-2 gene contains two mutually exclusive exons, K-SAM and BEK. We made a cell line designed to become drug-resistant on repression of BEK exon splicing. One drug-resistant derivative of this line carried an insertion within the BEK exon of a sequence containing at least two independent splicing silencers. One silencer was a pyrimidine-rich sequence, which markedly increased binding of polypyrimidine tract-binding protein to the BEK exon. The BEK exon binds to polypyrimidine tract-binding protein even in the silencer's absence. Several exonic pyrimidine runs are required for this binding, and they are also required for overexpression of polypyrimidine tract-binding protein to repress BEK exon splicing. These results show that binding of polypyrimidine tract-binding protein to exon sequences can repress splicing. In epithelial cells, the K-SAM exon is spliced in preference to the BEK exon, whose splicing is repressed. Mutation of the BEK exon pyrimidine runs decreases this repression. If this mutation is combined with the deletion of a sequence in the intron upstream from the BEK exon, a complete switch from K-SAM to BEK exon splicing ensues. Binding of polypyrimidine tract binding protein to the BEK exon thus participates in the K-SAM/BEK alternative splicing choice."

The current model holds that theClock- and cycle-encoded products (CLK and CYC) activate period (per) and timeless (tim) transcription. After the PER and TIM proteins accumulate in the cytoplasm and form heterodimers, the proteins translocate to the nucleus and negatively regulate their own genes by interfering with both CLK and CYC (1Saez L.

However, little is known about circadian clock-regulated output genes, which are thought to be regulated by these clock genes and to control physiological and behavioral rhythms. Recently, the pigment-dispersing factor (PDF) and the Drosophila lark gene, which encodes an RNA-binding protein, have been demonstrated to be circadian clock-regulated output genes, and the strains of Drosophilathat are mutant for these genes are defective in the rhythm of eclosion (7McNeil G.P.

Neurosci. 2000; 20: 3339-3353Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These genes are expressed in the brain; in contrast, few circadian clock-regulated output genes have been described in the peripheral tissues. It has been suggested that the intracellular second messenger cGMP plays a functional role in eclosion behavior. cGMP levels in the ganglion increase at the time of eclosion, and injection of cGMP into pharate pupae prior to natural eclosion induces eclosion behavior in the silk moth, Bombyx mori (10Shibanaka Y. Hayashi H. Okada N. Fujita N. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 180: 881-886Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). cGMP formation is catalyzed by guanylyl cyclases (GCs)1. Two types of GC have been described: the soluble type and the receptor type. The soluble-type GC is mainly activated by nitric oxide (NO) (11Ignarro L.J. Adams J.B. Horwitz P.M. Wood K.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 4997-5002Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and plays an important role in neuronal development (12Ball E.E. Truman J.W. J. Comp. Neurol. 1998; 394: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The receptor-type GC is generally a peptide hormone receptor similar to the receptor for the mammalian atrial natriuretic peptide hormone (13Chinkers M. Garbers D.L. Chang M.-S. Lowe D.G. Chin H. Goeddel D.V. Schulz S. Nature. 1989; 338: 78-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (890) Google Scholar) and consists of four domains: extracellular, single transmembrane, kinase-like, and guanylyl cyclase. The binding of a ligand to the extracellular domain activates the intracellular guanylyl cyclase domain. Phosphorylation of the kinase-like domain modulates the GC domain (14Koller K.J. Lipari M.T. Goeddel D.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5997-6003Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In insects, three receptor-type GCs have been identified in the embryo and the nervous system of Drosophila melanogaster (15Gigliotti S. Cavaliere V. Manzi A. Tino A. Graziani F. Malva C. Dev. Biol. 1993; 159: 450-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 16Liu W. Yoon J. Chen L. Pak W.L. J. Biol.

Another three putative receptor-type GCs are listed in the Drosophila genome sequence data base (flybase.bio.indiana.edu/). We identified a receptor-type GC gene,BmGC-I, from the silk moth B. mori, which is present in the flight muscle, antennal lobe, antennal neuron, thoracic ganglion, Malpighian tubules, and midgut (18Tanoue S. Sumida S. Suetsugu T. Endo Y. Nishioka T. Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2001; 31: 971-979Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). However, the physiological roles of BmGC-I have not yet been well elucidated. In this study, we demonstrate that the expression of BmGC-I is regulated under the circadian clock in the flight muscles and that it is involved in eclosion behavior. BmGC-I protein expression and cGMP levels are high during the initiation of the eclosion event that occurs at the beginning of the photoperiod. The rhythms of BmGC-I protein expression, cGMP levels, and eclosion shift with the environmental photoperiodic cycle and exhibit free-running in constant light. These results suggest that BmGC-I is a putative circadian clock-regulated output gene that controls eclosion behavior in peripheral tissues. Pupae of B. mori were obtained from Kyoya Corp., Kyoto, Japan and reared at 25 °C under a 14-h light/10-h dark cycle. Pharate pupae were anesthetized with diethyl ether, and the flight muscles were dissected out and quickly used for measurement of cGMP, extraction and purification of RNA, and Western blotting. RNA was isolated from the flight muscles of pharate pupae 0–2 days before eclosion using the guanidine thiocyanate method (19Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 1. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 7.23-7.25Google Scholar). Aliquots of total RNA were treated with deoxyribonuclease I (Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Ltd.) for 1 h at 37 °C. RT-PCR was performed using a commercial RT-PCR kit (Takara Shuzo Co., Ltd.). 1.0 μg of total RNA was used for cDNA synthesis. PCR amplifications of the synthesized cDNA were performed according to the following schedule: 94 °C for 1 min, 62 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 1.34 min, for 30 cycles. The specific primers for BmGC-I were 5′-GGCTGTCACAAAGCAGGACG-3′ and 5′-CCGTTGCTGTTTATTACAACC-3′, corresponding to nucleotides 227–246 and 1241–1261 in the extracellular domain (Fig. 1 A). The specific primers for the Actin gene were 5′-ATGTGCAAGGCCGGTTTCGC-3′ and 5′-CGACACGCAGCTCATTGTAG-3′, corresponding to nucleotides 49–68 and 284–351 (20Nicole M. Gaillard J. Prudhomme J.-C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 2781Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Products were then analyzed on a 1.0% agarose gel and stained with ethidium bromide. The sizes of the amplified products were 1035 base pairs (BmGC-I) and 303 base pairs (Actin). Flight muscles dissected from pharate pupae were quickly frozen in liquid nitrogen and homogenized in 6% trichloroacetic acid. Homogenized samples were washed four times with a 5× volume of diethyl ether and lyophilized. Lyophilized samples were weighed and dissolved in 1 ml of a 0.05 m sodium acetate buffer (pH 5.8) containing 0.02% (w/v) bovine serum albumin. Two 50-μl aliquots were assayed for cGMP using a commercial cGMP enzyme immunoassay kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) after acetylation. Tissues dissected from pharate pupae were homogenized in buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5, 250 mm sucrose, 10 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20 μg/ml aprotinin, 20 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 mm dithiothreitol). Homogenized samples were centrifuged at 1000 × g for 3 min, and the supernatants were collected. Proteins in the homogenate were determined using the dye-binding method (21Piece J. Suelter C.H. Anal. Biochem. 1977; 81: 478-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Fifty micrograms of homogenate were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis on a 7.5% polyacrylamide gel and transferred to a polyvinylidine difluoride membrane. The membranes were blocked in 10% milk protein in PBS-T (2.68 mm KCl, 8.1 mmNa2HPO4, 1.47 mmKH2PO4, pH 7.4, and 1% Tween) for 1 h and incubated for 1 h in a rabbit anti-BmGC-I polyclonal antibody (dilution 1:1000; generation of the anti-BmGC-I antibody is described in Ref. 18Tanoue S. Sumida S. Suetsugu T. Endo Y. Nishioka T. Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2001; 31: 971-979Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The membranes were rinsed in PBS-T and incubated for 1 h in horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibody (dilution 1:1000; New England Biolabs, Inc.). The reaction was visualized by incubation in a chemiluminescent substrate (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for 1 min and exposed to x-ray film (Kodak Co.). Protein expression signals were scanned into a computer using a scanner (Epson Co.) and quantified with NIH image 1.62 software. To examine the temporal pattern of BmGC-ImRNA expression in the flight muscles, we used RT-PCR to amplify 1035 base pairs of mRNA from the extracellular domain (Fig. 1 A). Dissected flight muscles were collected from pharate pupae over 24 h at 2–4 h intervals in a 14-h light (Zeitgeber time (ZT) 0-ZT 14)/10-h dark (ZT 14-ZT 24) cycle. The PCR amplification products were confirmed to be the products of the BmGC-Igene using DNA sequence analysis. We also confirmed that genomic DNA was not amplified in the absence of reverse transcriptase.BmGC-I mRNA was detected from approximately ZT 10 to ZT 18 (Fig. 1 B). The temporal pattern of the BmGC-ImRNA expression exhibited free-running from the first day under constant light conditions (Fig. 1 C). We analyzed the expression rhythm of the BmGC-I protein using Western blotting analysis. Western blotting analysis showed that the BmGC-I protein was expressed between about ZT 22 and ZT 24, a 4–5-h delay relative to the mRNA expression (Fig. 1 D). The lag of 4–5 h between mRNA expression and protein expression is characteristic of circadian clock genes such as per andtim (22So W.V. Rosbash M. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7146-7155Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). The BmGC-I protein expression also exhibited a free-running rhythm under constant light (Fig. 1 E), and the peak of the BmGC-I protein expression under constant light advanced about 2 h from that under the 14-h light/10-h dark cycle (Fig. 1,D and E). To assess the BmGC-I activity in the flight muscles throughout the 24-h cycle, we measured cGMP levels using an enzyme immunoassay for cGMP. The peak of the cGMP levels was at the subjective beginning of the photoperiod and coincided with that of the BmGC-I protein expression under the 14-h light/10-h dark cycle and under constant light (Fig. 2, A and B). We also found that the peak of cGMP levels coincided with that of eclosion events (Fig. 2, C and D). These results indicate that the BmGC-I protein expression is regulated under the circadian clock and is related to eclosion behavior in the flight muscles. The circadian expression of the BmGC-I was slightly affected by constant light; under constant light conditions, the peak of the BmGC-I protein expression, cGMP levels, and eclosion advanced about 2 h from those under the entrained condition (Figs. 1, D andE, and 2). In previous studies, the phase of eclosion rhythm slightly advances by the first day in constant light (10Shibanaka Y. Hayashi H. Okada N. Fujita N. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 180: 881-886Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 23Truman J.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1971; 68: 595-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), and these results were in agreement with previous reports. In insects, the circadian clock synchronizes to the photoperiodic cycle. In Drosophila, the phase of the locomotor activity rhythm shifts with a light flash in the dark period, and expression rhythms of several circadian clock genes synchronize to the photoperiodic cycle (24Suri V. Qian Z. Hall J.C. Rosbash M. Neuron. 1998; 21: 225-234Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). To test whether the rhythm of the BmGC-I protein expression also synchronizes to the photoperiodic cycle, we assessed induction of the BmGC-I protein expression under a condition in which the beginning of the photoperiod was shifted to ZT 20, 4 h prior to the beginning of the entrained photoperiod. The BmGC-I protein expression shifted to ZT 21, 1 h after the beginning of the first photoperiod in the new photoperiodic cycle (Fig. 3 A). The peaks of adult eclosion events and of cGMP levels also shifted to ZT 21 (Fig. 3,B and C). These results indicate that the BmGC-I protein expression, cGMP levels, and eclosion rhythm shift with the new photoperiodic cycle. The products of the circadian clock genes are expressed widely inDrosophila tissues: the per gene product, PER, is expressed in the antennae, alimentary canal, Malpighian tubule, ovaries, and compound eyes (25Siwicki K.K. Eastman C. Petersen G. Rosbash M. Hall J.C. Neuron. 1988; 1: 141-150Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar, 26Giebultowicz J.M. Hege D.M. Nature. 1997; 386: 664Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). In the silk moth, BmGC-I protein (and mRNA) are expressed widely in the antennae, legs, midgut, and ganglion in addition to the flight muscles (18Tanoue S. Sumida S. Suetsugu T. Endo Y. Nishioka T. Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2001; 31: 971-979Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Here we examined the BmGC-I expression rhythm in the legs, midgut, antennae, and ganglion using Western blotting analysis and RT-PCR. In the legs, the BmGC-I protein was expressed at ZT 24 but not at ZT 12 (Fig. 4 A), and BmGC-Igene expression was observed at ZT 18 but not at ZT 6 (Fig. 4 B). In the midgut, antennae, and thoracic ganglion, the BmGC-I protein was expressed at both ZT 12 and ZT 24 (Fig. 4 A), and RT-PCR analysis showed that the BmGC-Igene is expressed at both ZT18 and ZT 6 (Fig. 4 B). These results indicate that the BmGC-I expression is regulated under the circadian clock in the muscles and legs but not in the antennae, midgut, or thoracic ganglion. BmGC-I is a putative peptide hormone receptor whose ligand has not been identified. The amino acid sequence of BmGC-I is most closely related to the mammalian atrial natriuretic peptide hormone receptors (18Tanoue S. Sumida S. Suetsugu T. Endo Y. Nishioka T. Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2001; 31: 971-979Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), and it is likely that the putative ligand is a member of the atrial natriuretic peptide hormone family. Here we have demonstrated that BmGC-I protein expression and the peak of cGMP levels in the flight muscles occur near the initiation of eclosion events at the beginning of the photoperiod. These all exhibited free-running under conditions of constant light (Figs. 1 and2). The BmGC-I protein expression, the peak of cGMP levels, and the peak of eclosion shifted when the beginning of the photoperiod was shifted 4 h prior to that of the entrained condition (Fig. 3). In a previous study, cGMP was suggested to be the second messenger in eclosion events, because injection of cGMP to pharate pupae prior to natural eclosion induces eclosion behavior (10Shibanaka Y. Hayashi H. Okada N. Fujita N. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 180: 881-886Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Furthermore, peptide hormones are thought to be essential for circadian output; for example, the pigment-dispersing factor gene in Drosophila and the vasopressin gene in rodents are circadian clock-regulated output genes (27Renn S.C.P. Park J.H. Rosbash M. Hall J.C. Taghert P.H. Cell. 1999; 99: 791-802Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (867) Google Scholar, 28Jin X. Shearman L.P. Weaver D.R. Zylka M.J. DeVries G.J. Reppert S.M. Cell. 1999; 96: 57-68Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (792) Google Scholar). In light of these reports, we suggest that the putative peptide hormone receptor BmGC-I is a circadian clock-regulated output gene that is involved in eclosion in the flight muscles. BmGC-I is expressed widely in the silk moth and is found in the antennae, the thoracic ganglion, and the legs in addition to the flight muscles (18Tanoue S. Sumida S. Suetsugu T. Endo Y. Nishioka T. Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2001; 31: 971-979Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The rhythmic expression of BmGC-I was observed in the flight muscles and the legs but not in the antennae, thoracic ganglion, or the midgut (Fig. 4), suggesting that the functional role of BmGC-I differs from tissue to tissue. In insects, cGMP plays different physiological roles in various tissues, including reception of sex pheromones in male antennae (29Ziegelberger G. van den Berg M.J. Kaissling K.-E. Schultz J.E. J. Neurosci. 1990; 10: 1217-1225Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 30Boekhoff I. Seifert E. Göggerle S. Lindemann M. Krüger B.-W. Breer H. Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1993; 23: 757-762Crossref Scopus (64) Google Scholar), development in neurons (12Ball E.E. Truman J.W. J. Comp. Neurol. 1998; 394: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 31Gibbs S.M. Truman J.W. Neuron. 1998; 20: 83-93Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar), and diuresis in the Malpighian tubules (32O'Donnel M.J. Dow J.A.T. Huesmann G.R. Tublitz N.J. Maddrell S.H.P. J. Exp. Biol. 1996; 199: 1163-1175PubMed Google Scholar, 33Quilan M.C. Tublitz N.J. O'Donnel M.J. J. Exp. Biol. 1997; 200: 2363-2367PubMed Google Scholar). However, the physiological role of cGMP in the flight muscles is not well understood. In mammalian skeletal muscles, cGMP mediates oxidation of glucose, inhibition of glycogen synthesis, release of lactate, and transport of glucose (34Young M.E. Rad J.K. Leighton B. Biochem. J. 1997; 322: 223-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar, 35Young M.E. Leighton B. FEBS Lett. 1998; 424: 79-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Levels of glucose, lipids, and glycogen in skeletal muscle have been demonstrated to follow circadian rhythms in rat (36Benavides A. Siches M. Llobera M. Am. Physiol. Soc. 1998; 275: R811-R817PubMed Google Scholar). It is therefore possible that the rhythm of the BmGC-I expression is relevant to the circadian rhythm of glucose metabolism and that BmGC-I stimulates glucose utilization for muscle contraction. Silk moth pupae frequently contract muscles to cast off pupal skin at eclosion and thus are likely to use glucose at that time. It is important to identify the ligand of BmGC-I to elucidate the physiological roles that it might play in the flight muscles at the time of eclosion. The rhythm of the BmGC-I expression in the flight muscles synchronized to the environmental photocycle, shifting when the beginning of the photoperiod was shifted from ZT 24 to ZT 20 (Fig. 3). This raises the question of how photoreception regulates BmGC-I protein expression in the flight muscles. In Drosophila, the peripheral tissues have a photoreceptor to synchronize the circadian rhythms with the environmental photocycle independently of the compound eyes and brain (37Plautz J.D. Kaneko M. Hall J.C. Kay S.A. Science. 1997; 278: 1632-1635Crossref PubMed Scopus (554) Google Scholar). The putative photoreceptor for synchronizing to the environmental photocycle, CRY, has been identified, and a Drosophilastrain with a mutant cry gene exhibits poor synchronization to the photocycle (38Stanewsky R. Kaneko M. Emery P. Beretta B. Wager-Smith K. Kay S.A. Rosbash M. Hall J.C. Cell. 1998; 95: 681-692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (778) Google Scholar, 39Emery P. Stanewsky R. Helfrich-Föster C. Emery-Le M. Hall J.C. Rosbash M. Neuron. 2000; 26: 493-504Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). CRY interacts with TIM (40Ceriani M.F. Darlington T.K. Staknis D. Màs P. Petti A.A. Weitz C.J. Kay S.A. Science. 1999; 285: 553-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar), and TIM protein is degraded when a light is flashed during the dark period (24Suri V. Qian Z. Hall J.C. Rosbash M. Neuron. 1998; 21: 225-234Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar,41Hunter-Ensor M. Ousley A. Sehgal A. Cell. 1996; 84: 677-685Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). This suggests that TIM has a functional role in synchronizing the circadian clock to the environmental photocycle. CRY and TIM may thus mediate the synchronization of the BmGC-I protein expression rhythm to environmental photocycle. In this study, we demonstrate that the expression of the receptor-type guanylyl cyclase BmGC-I in the silk moth flight muscle exhibits a circadian rhythm and that BmGC-I is involved in eclosion behavior. Furthermore, we suggest that the BmGC-I gene is a putative circadian clock-regulated output gene. Previous studies have described circadian clock-regulated output genes in the central nervous system (7McNeil G.P. Zhang X. Genova G. Jackson F.R. Neuron. 1998; 20: 297-303Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 8Park J.H. Helfrich-Föster C. Lee G. Liu L. Rosbash M. Hall C.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Neurosci. 2000; 20: 3339-3353Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), but no such genes have been reported in the peripheral tissues of insects. The expression of the BmGC-I gene in the peripheral tissues of the silk moth provides a key for the elucidation of the molecular mechanisms of eclosion behavior that are controlled by the circadian clock genes."

The results provide a rationale for an empirical rule used by chemists to compare structures of reactants, intermediates, and products. Wales also derives a quantitative law relating energy barriers, vibration frequencies, and path lengths, which were previously thought to be unrelated. The theory may help explain the complex behavior of such diverse systems as glasses, clusters, and proteins.
