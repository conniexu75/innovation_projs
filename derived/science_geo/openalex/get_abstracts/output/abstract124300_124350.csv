To understand the molecular mechanisms that govern this function, we characterized apoptosis in cardiac muscle cells following serum deprivation. Cardiotrophin 1 (CT-1), a potent cardiac survival factor (Sheng, Z., Pennica, D., Wood, W. I., and Chien, K. R. (1996) Development (Camb.) 122, 419-428), is capable of inhibiting apoptosis in cardiac myocytes. To explore the potential downstream pathways that might be responsible for this effect, we documented that CT-1 activated both signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3)- and mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase-dependent pathways. The transfection of a MAP kinase kinase 1 (MEK1) dominant negative mutant cDNA into myocardial cells blocked the antiapoptotic effects of CT-1, indicating a requirement of the MAP kinase pathway for the survival effect of CT-1. A MEK-specific inhibitor (PD098059) (Dudley, D. T., Pang, L., Decker, S.-J., Bridges, A. J., and Saltiel, A. R. (1995) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 92, 7686-7689) is capable of blocking the activation of MAP kinase, as well as the survival effect of CT-1. In contrast, this inhibitor did not block the activation of STAT3, nor did it have any effect on the hypertrophic response elicited following stimulation of CT-1. Therefore, CT-1 promotes cardiac myocyte survival via the activation of an antiapoptotic signaling pathway that requires MAP kinases, whereas the hypertrophy induced by CT-1 may be mediated by alternative pathways, e.g. Janus kinase/STAT or MEK kinase/c-Jun NH2-terminal protein kinase.

INTRODUCTIONCardiac muscle cell survival plays a critical role in maintaining the normal function of the heart and possibly in cardiac development. Adult cardiac muscle cells are terminally differentiated and therefore have lost their proliferative capacity. In contrast to skeletal muscle, the myocardium does not contain satellite heart muscle cells, and irreversible heart injury results in scarring and an eventual decrease in global cardiac function. In response to mechanical stimuli and hemodynamic stress, the adult myocardium activates an adaptive hypertrophic response that is characterized by an increase in myocardial cell size without a concomitant increase in myocyte number (For review, see Refs. 1Chien K.R.

However, during long-standing exposure to hypertension or other forms of hemodynamic stress, a distinct form of myocardial cell hypertrophy can be activated in which the heart becomes dilated and individual cardiac myocytes exhibit an increase in cell length, reflecting the addition of new sarcomeric units in series (3Wollert K.C.

This dilatation of the heart is usually accompanied by fibrosis, microscarring, and the loss of viable cardiac myocytes throughout the myocardium. As a result of cardiac dilatation and myocyte dropout, the myocardium ultimately develops an irreversible loss of function and ensuing cardiac muscle failure (4Colucci W.S. Braunwald E. Braunwald E. Heart Disease, A Textbook of Cardiovascular Medicine. W. B. Saunders Co., Philadelphia1996: 394-420Google Scholar). As such, the identification of the signaling pathways that mediate distinct forms of cardiac muscle cell hypertrophy, dysfunction, and cardiac muscle cell survival are critical to the ultimate elucidation of the molecular basis of cardiac muscle failure.By coupling expression cloning with an embryonic stem cell-based model of in vitro cardiogenesis (5Pennica D.

Importantly, cardiotrophin 1 has been shown to be capable of promoting survival of both embryonic and neonatal rat ventricular muscle cells (8Sheng Z. Pennica D. Wood W.I. Chien K.R. Development (Camb.). 1996; 122: 419-428Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recent studies have demonstrated that CT-1 exerts its effects on cardiac muscle cell hypertrophy through promoting the heterodimerization of gp130 with the leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) receptor Î², both of which are required for the activation of the downstream hypertrophic response (3Wollert K.C. Taga T. Saito M. Narazaki M. Kishimoto T. Glembotski C.C. Vernallis A.B. Heath J.K. Pennica D. Wood W.I. Chien K.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9535-9545Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). Relatively less is known concerning the mechanisms by which CT-1 promotes cardiac myocyte survival. It is unclear whether this effect is based on a generalized trophic effect or a specific requirement for CT-1 for long-term myocyte survival or whether it reflects the activation of signaling pathways that can act to block programmed cell death of cardiac myocytes, i.e. apoptosis. In addition, it is unknown whether divergent or convergent downstream signaling pathways mediate these two distinct effects of CT-1 on myocyte survival and hypertrophic responses.To address these questions, the current study reports the characterization of an in vitro cardiac muscle assay system in which apoptosis is induced following serum deprivation of myocytes that are plated at a relatively low density. In this assay system, we document the onset of cardiac myocyte cell death via apoptotic pathways by two independent criteria, i.e. scoring for nuclear changes associated with apoptosis and the presence of internucleosomal DNA fragmentation. The addition of CT-1 is capable of promoting cardiac myocyte survival and blocking apoptosis. To explore the potential downstream pathways that might be responsible for this effect, we documented that CT-1 is capable of activating both STAT3- and MAP kinase-dependent pathways. To directly relate the activation of these pathways to the biological functions of CT-1, we transfected a MAP kinase kinase 1 (MEK1) dominant negative mutant cDNA into neonatal ventricular myocardial cells and found that the mutant was capable of blocking the antiapoptotic effects of CT-1 on individual cardiac myocytes, thereby indicating a requirement of MAP kinase activity for the survival effect of CT-1 on cardiac myocytes. In addition, in studies applying the MEK inhibitor (PD098059) (9Dudley D.T. Pang L. Decker S.-J. Bridges A.J. Saltiel A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7686-7689Crossref PubMed Scopus (2584) Google Scholar), we observed that the inhibitor was capable of blocking the activation of MAP kinase, as well as the survival effect of CT-1. The inhibitor displayed specificity for the MAP kinase pathway, as it did not inhibit the activation of STAT3, nor did it have any effect on the hypertrophic response elicited following stimulation of CT-1. Taken together, these studies indicate that CT-1 promotes cardiac myocyte survival by preventing apoptosis through a signaling pathway that requires MAP kinase. In addition, MAP kinase does not appear to be required for the activation of a CT-1-dependent hypertrophic response, indicating that CT-1 uses divergent signaling pathways for the activation of the survival and hypertrophic responses, the latter of which may be mediated by a JAK/STAT or MEK kinase/c-Jun NH2-terminal protein kinase pathway.

Using these sequences, we isolated full-length cDNA encoding a protein of 96 amino acid residues with 20-28% identity to other CC chemokines. By Northern blot, this chemokine was mainly expressed in liver among various tissues and strongly induced in several human cell lines by phorbol myristate acetate. We thus designated this chemokine as LARC from iver and ctivation-egulated hemokine. We mapped the LARC gene close to the chromosomal marker D2S159 at chromosome 2q33-q37 by somatic cell and radiation hybrid mappings and isolated two yeast artificial chromosome clones containing the LARC gene from this region. To prepare LARC, we subcloned the cDNA into a baculovirus vector and expressed it in insect cells. The secreted protein started at Ala-27 and was significantly chemotactic for lymphocytes. At a concentration of 1 Î¼g/ml, it also showed a weak chemotactic activity for granulocytes. Unlike other CC chemokines, however, LARC was not chemotactic for monocytic THP-1 cells or blood monocytes. LARC tagged with secreted alkaline phosphatase-(His)6 bound specifically to lymphocytes, the binding being competed only by LARC and not by other CC or CXC chemokines. Scatchard analysis revealed a single class of receptors for LARC on lymphocytes with a Kd of 0.4 nM and 2100 sites/cell. Collectively, LARC is a novel CC chemokine, which may represent a new group of CC chemokines localized on chromosome 2.

Chemokines are a large family of small cytokines involved in a variety of immunoregulatory and proinflammatory responses, primarily by virtue of their leukocyte chemotaxis activity (1Oppenheim J.J.

Based on whether the first two of the four conserved cysteine residues are juxtaposed or separated by a single amino acid residue, this family is subdivided into two groups, the CXC and the CC chemokines. Recently, a new chemokine-like molecule, lymphotactin/SCM-1, which lacks the first and the third conserved cysteine residues, has been isolated and may represent a third group C (4Kelner G.S.

In general, CXC chemokines are potent chemoattractants for neutrophils, whereas CC chemokines are chemotactic mainly for monocytes and also for basophils, eosinophils, and lymphocytes with variable selectivity. Lymphotactin/SCM-1 has been shown to attract lymphocytes. In addition to chemotactic activities, some chemokines have regulatory roles in hematopoiesis (7Broxmeyer H.E. Cooper S. Hague N.

Therefore, there might still exist uncovered chemokines expressed in other cell types and tissues. Currently, world-wide efforts to find all human genes, approximately â¼100,000, are in progress as part of the human genome project. Accordingly, cDNAs from libraries of various human tissues are sequenced from both 5â²- and 3â²-ends, and their partial, âsingle passâ cDNA sequences are deposited as expressed sequence tags (ESTs) 1The abbreviations used are:ESTsexpressed sequence tagsYACyeast artificial chromosomedbESTexpressed sequence tag data baseFCSfetal calf serumPMAphorbol 12-myristate 13-acetateRACErapid amplification of cDNA endsPCRpolymerase chain reactionGAPDHglyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenaseSTSsequence tagged siteMES2-morpholinoethanesulfonic acidkb.kilobase pair(s)SEAPsecreted alkaline phosphatasePLAPplacental alkaline phosphatasePBSphosphate-buffered salineAPalkaline phosphataseIL-8interleukin 8. in the public data bases. Recently we found four ESTs encoding CC chemokine-like proteins in the EST data base (dbEST), a division of GenBank (20Boguski M.S. Lowe T.M.J. Tolstoshev C.M. Nat. Genet. 1993; 4: 332-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (1140) Google Scholar). The genes of these four ESTs have been mapped in a yeast artificial chromosome (YAC) contig covering the CC chemokine gene cluster on human chromosome 17q11.2 (20Boguski M.S. Lowe T.M.J. Tolstoshev C.M. Nat. Genet. 1993; 4: 332-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (1140) Google Scholar). This demonstrates that the dbEST is a good source for new chemokines. Furthermore, the YAC contig may be useful to quickly assign new chemokine genes within the cluster. expressed sequence tags yeast artificial chromosome expressed sequence tag data base fetal calf serum phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate rapid amplification of cDNA ends polymerase chain reaction glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase sequence tagged site 2-morpholinoethanesulfonic acid kilobase pair(s) secreted alkaline phosphatase placental alkaline phosphatase phosphate-buffered saline alkaline phosphatase interleukin 8. Here we report the identification of a fifth new CC chemokine, termed LARC (iver and ctivation-egulated hemokine) from the dbEST. This new CC chemokine is different from other CC chemokine members in several respects. 1) LARC is only distantly related to other CC chemokines, and its gene is located on a different chromosome than other CC chemokines. 2) Unlike other CC chemokines, LARC is not chemotactic for monocytes but is primarily a lymphocyte chemoattractant. 3) Lymphocytes display a single class of receptors for LARC that is not shared by other CC or CXC chemokines. The dbEST (21Naruse K. Ueno M. Satoh T. Nomiyama H. Tei H. Takeda M. Ledbetter D.H. Van Coillie E. Opdenakker G. Gunge N. Sakaki Y. Iio M. Miura R. Genomics. 1996; 34: 236-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) was searched with various CC chemokine nucleotide sequences or amino acid sequences as queries using the data base search and analysis service Search Launcher (22Smith R.F. Wiese B.A. Wojzynski M.K. Davison D.B. Worley K.C. Genome Res. 1996; 6: 454-462Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) available on the World Wide Web. The program used was Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (23Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (70758) Google Scholar). Human histiocytic lymphoma cell line U937 was grown in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS) and stimulated with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) at a concentration of 50 ng/ml for 6 h. Poly(A)+ RNA was prepared using the QuickPrep mRNA purification kit (Pharmacia Biotech, Uppsala, Sweden). cDNA was synthesized by the rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) method (24Frohman M.A. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 218: 340-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar) using the Marathon cDNA amplification kit (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA). Briefly, the double-stranded cDNA was synthesized from poly(A)+ RNA using a cDNA synthesis primer supplied in the kit. The cDNA adaptors were then ligated at both ends of the cDNA. The adaptor-ligated cDNA was then amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with one of the gene-specific primers derived from an EST sequence (GenBank accession number D31065) (5â² oligomer: GTACTCAACACTGAGCAGATCT and 3â² oligomer: AGGTGGAGTAGCAGCACT) and an AP1 primer which is complementary to part of the cDNA adaptor and supplied in the kit. PCR was performed in a 50-Î¼l reaction mixture containing 0.25 mM each of the dNTPs, 50 pmol of each of the primers, 2.5 units of TAKARA LA Taq (Takara, Kyoto, Japan), 1 Ã buffer supplied with the polymerase, and 0.55 Î¼g of TaqStart antibody (Clontech). The PCR conditions were as follows: 94Â°C, 30 s; 60Â°C, 30 s; 68Â°C, 3 min, for 30 cycles. The products were inserted into a pGEM-T vector (Promega, Madison, WI) and sequenced on both strands using gene-specific and commercial primers. A human liver cDNA library, constructed with random hexamers and cloned in the Î»gt11 vector, was screened using the LARC 3â²-RACE fragment (Fig. 1) as a probe according to standard methods (25Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The library was kindly provided by Dr. M. Takiguchi of Kumamoto University Medical School. The cDNA fragments of the positive clones were excised with EcoRI and inserted into pBluescript II KS+ (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) and sequenced. Poly(A)+ RNA was prepared from U937, K562, an erythroleukemia cell line, Jurkat, a T cell line, and Bowes melanoma cells. Messenger RNAs were extracted from cells without or with PMA treatment (50 ng/ml, 6 h). After electrophoresis in a 1% formaldehyde-agarose gel (2 Î¼g per lane), RNAs were blotted onto a nylon membrane. Northern blot filters containing human poly(A)+ RNA from various tissues (2 Î¼g per lane) were purchased from Clontech. Filters were hybridized with the 32P-labeled LARC cDNA probe in a solution containing 5 Ã SSPE, 10 Ã Denhardt's solution, 100 Î¼g/ml denatured salmon sperm DNA, 2% sodium dodecyl sulfate, and 50% formamide at 42Â°C overnight and washed at 50Â°C for 20 min in 0.1 Ã SSC, 0.1% SDS. After autoradiography, filters were reprobed with a human glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) cDNA probe. The LARC and GAPDH probes were prepared by labeling the 3â²-RACE cDNA fragment (Fig. 1) and the HindIII-XbaI fragment (0.5 kb) of the human GAPDH cDNA clone pKS321 (26Tokunaga K. Nakamura Y. Sakata K. Fujimori K. Ohkubo M. Sawada K. Sakiyama S. Cancer Res. 1987; 47: 5616-5619PubMed Google Scholar), respectively. Using the 5â² and 3â² oligomers described as above as a primer pair, PCR was performed on the National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS) human monochromosomal somatic cell hybrid mapping panel No. 2 version 2 (Coriell Cell Repositories, Camden, NJ) and on the GeneBridge 4 Radiation Hybrid panel (27Gyapay G. Schmitt K. Fizames C. Jones H. Vega-Czarny N. Spillett D. Muselet D. Prud'Homme J.-F. Dib C. Auffray C. Morissette J. Weissenbach J. Goodfellow P.N. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1996; 5: 339-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar) consisting of 91 hybrid DNAs (Research Genetics, Huntsville, AL), for chromosomal mapping and radiation hybrid mapping, respectively. The PCR conditions for amplification of the LARC-specific sequence were 35 cycles of 94Â°C, 30 s; 60Â°C, 30 s; 72Â°C, 1 min, in a 5-Î¼l reaction buffer containing 0.25 mM of each of the dNTPs, 50 pmol of each of the primers, and 0.125 units of TAKARA Taq (Takara). PCR products were electrophoresed on 2% agarose gels. Using these primers, PCR is expected to generate a 100-base pair fragment. The radiation hybrid mapping data were sent to the Radiation Hybrid server at the Whitehead Institute/MIT Center for Genome Research for analysis. According to the radiation hybrid mapping data, the YAC data base at Whitehead Institute/MIT Center for Genome Research was searched for CEPH mega-YAC clones containing a sequence tagged site (STS) D2S159. The YACs containing D2S159 were grown in AHC medium, and total yeast DNA from individual YAC clones was prepared as described (28Green E.D. Olson M.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 1213-1217Crossref PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar). The presence of a D2S159 STS in these clones was confirmed by PCR using the primers listed in the Genome Data base (accession ID: 188410). YACs containing the LARC gene were identified by PCR analysis using 50 ng of these DNAs. The PCR conditions were as described above. LARC protein was prepared using a baculovirus expression system. The LARC cDNA fragment containing the entire coding region was excised with BglII (5â²-noncoding region) and NotI (cDNA synthesis primer sequence) from the 3â²-RACE cDNA and subcloned into the BamHI-NotI sites of the pVL1393 baculovirus transfer vector (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA), downstream of the polyhedrin gene promoter. The resulting recombinant plasmid, termed pVL-LARC, was identified by restriction mapping. Spodoptera frugiperda Sf9 cells were cotransfected with pVL-LARC DNA and the linearized Autographa californica nuclear polyhedrosis virus DNA (Clontech) using Lipofectin (Life Technologies, Inc.). In the Sf9 cells, homologous recombination occurs between the LARC sequence in the transfer vector and the polyhedrin gene sequence of A. californica nuclear polyhedrosis virus. The recombinant viruses were subsequently isolated by limiting dilution. For expression of the recombinant LARC, Trichoplusia ni BTI-TN-5B1-4 cells were infected with the recombinant viruses at m.o.i. of 10-20. The Sf9 and BTI-TN-5B1-4 cells were maintained at 27Â°C in EX-CELL 400 medium (JRH Biosciences, Lenexa, KS). The culture supernatants collected 2 days after infection were mixed with 1/10 volume of 500 mM MES (pH 6.5) and applied to a 1-ml cation-exchange HiTrap-S column (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) equilibrated with a buffer containing 50 mM MES (pH 6.5) and 100 mM NaCl. The column on a fast protein liquid chromatographic system (Pharmacia Biotech) was eluted at a rate of 1 ml/min with a 45-ml linear gradient of 0.1-1.0 M NaCl in 50 mM MES. The fractions containing recombinant LARC were pooled and injected into a reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography column (4.6 Ã 250 mm Cosmocil 5C4-AR-300) (Cosmo Bio, Tokyo, Japan) equilibrated with 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid. The column was eluted with a 100-ml linear gradient of 20-40% acetonitrile in 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. Fractions containing recombinant LARC were pooled and lyophilized. Protein concentrations were determined by the BCA kit (Pierce). Endotoxin levels were determined by the Limulus amoebocyte lysate assay (QCL-1000) (Bio Whitaker, Walkersville, MD) and were <4 pg/Î¼g recombinant LARC. NH2-terminal sequence analysis was performed on a protein sequencer (Shimazu, Tokyo, Japan). Polymorphonuclear neutrophils and mononuclear cells in heparinized human peripheral blood from single donors were separated by gradient centrifugation (30 min, 400 Ã g) on Ficoll/sodium metrizoate (Lymphoprep, Nyegaard, Oslo, Norway). The cell pellets, containing granulocytes and erythrocytes, were suspended in hydroxyethyl starch (Plasmasteril, Fresenius AG, Bad Homburg, Germany) for 30 min to remove erythrocytes by sedimentation. Residual erythrocytes were lysed by hypotonic shock in double distilled water (30 s). The total mononuclear cell fraction was used as a source for monocytes and lymphocytes. Blood lymphocytes were further purified by incubating mononuclear cells for 30 min at 4Â°C with paramagnetic microbeads conjugated with monoclonal antibody against CD14 expressed on monocytes. The cell suspension was passed over a column placed in a magnetic field (VarioMACS, Miltenyl Biotec, Bergisch, Germany). Alternatively, monocytes and lymphocytes were isolated by magnetic cell sorting (VarioMACS) using positive selection with anti-CD14 or anti-CD3, respectively. After positive or negative magnetic cell sorting, a cell purity (analyzed by fluorescence-activated cell sorter) of more than 80% was reached for monocytes (CD14+) and lymphocytes (CD3+). Purified granulocytes, mononuclear cells, lymphocytes, and THP-1 cells were washed, counted, and resuspended at 1 Ã 106, 2 Ã 106, 1 Ã 107, and 0.5 Ã 106 cells/ml, respectively, in HBSS (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with pyrogen-free human plasma protein (1 mg/ml albumin, Cohn fraction V). The monocytic THP-1 cells, grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% FCS (Life Technologies, Inc.), were used in the chemotaxis assay as an alternative for fresh monocytes. Migration of cells was assessed in a microchamber (NeuroProbe, Cabin John, MD) as described previously (29Van Damme J. Conings R. Balkwill F.R. Cytokines: A Practical Approach. IRL Press at Oxford University Press, Oxford1994: 215-224Google Scholar). Briefly, the lower compartments of the microchamber were filled with dilutions of chemokine (27 Î¼l) or with control buffer and the upper compartments with 50 Î¼l of cell suspension. The two compartments were separated by a 5-Î¼m pore size polycarbonate filter (Nuclepore, Pleasanton, CA). Polyvinylpyrrolidone-free filters were used for neutrophils and lymphocytes and polyvinylpyrrolidone-treated filters for monocytes and THP-1 cells. For lymphocyte chemotaxis, the membranes were coated with 20 Î¼g/ml fibronectin (Life Technologies, Inc.) for 24 h at 4Â°C. After incubation at 37Â°C for 45 min (neutrophils), 2 h (monocytes, THP-1 cells), or 4 h (lymphocytes), the filters were removed from the chambers, fixed, and stained with Diff-Quick (Harleco, Gibbstown, NJ). Finally, the cells of 10 oil immersion fields were counted. The chemotactic index was calculated from the number of cells migrated to the test sample divided by the number of cells migrated to the control. Synthetic human MCP-3 and natural IL-8, purified to homogeneity (29Van Damme J. Conings R. Balkwill F.R. Cytokines: A Practical Approach. IRL Press at Oxford University Press, Oxford1994: 215-224Google Scholar), were used as positive controls. LARC was expressed as a soluble fusion protein with secreted alkaline phosphatase (SEAP) containing a (His)6 COOH-terminal tag. For this purpose, a SEAP(His)6 tag vector, termed pDREF-SEAP(His)6-Hyg, was constructed as follows. Using the pSEAP-Enhancer (Clontech) as a template, the (His)6 coding sequence was introduced at the COOH-terminal region of SEAP by PCR using the 5â² XbaI-AP primer (5â²-CGCAGCTCCGGAATCATCCCAGTTGAGGAGGAGAAC) and the 3â² AP(His)6-NotI primer (5â²-CGCTCAGTGATGGTGATGGTGATGACCCGGGTGCGCGGCGTCGGT). The PCR product containing the XbaI-SEAP-(His)6-NotI sequence was digested with XbaI and NotI and inserted into the XbaI-NotI sites of pDREF-Hyg (18Imai T. Yoshida T. Baba M. Nishimura M. Kakizaki M. Yoshie O. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21514-21521Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). Prior to subcloning of the LARC cDNA into this vector, the 5â²-RACE LARC cDNA was amplified by PCR using the 5â² SalI-LARC primer (5â²-CGCAAAACCATGTGCTGTACCAAG) and the 3â² LARC-XbaI primer (5â²-CGCCATGTTCTTGACTTTTTTACT). After digestion with SalI and XbaI, the product was ligated into the SalI-XbaI sites of the pDREF-SEAP(His)6 vector. The vector is a derivative of the signal sequence trap vector pDREF-CD4ST (18Imai T. Yoshida T. Baba M. Nishimura M. Kakizaki M. Yoshie O. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21514-21521Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar), and the signal-deleted CD4 coding sequence in the pDREF-CD4ST was replaced with SEAP(His)6. This subcloning engineered a five-amino acid linker (Ser-Arg-Ser-Ser-Gly) between the NCC-7 and the SEAP(His)6. To produce the LARC-SEAP fusion protein, 293/EBNA-1 cells (Invitrogen) were transfected with the expression vector using lipofectamin (Life Technologies, Inc.). The 293/EBNA-1 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% FCS. The transfected cells were incubated for 3-4 days in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% FCS. The culture supernatant was centrifuged, filtered (0.45 Î¼m), and stored at 4Â°C with 20 mM HEPES (pH 7.4) and 0.02% sodium azide. For NH2-terminal sequence analysis, the fusion protein was purified by affinity chromatography on nickel agarose (QIAGEN, Hilden, Germany). The concentration of LARC-SEAP was estimated by sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Briefly, 96-well microtiter plates (Maxsorb, Nunc, Roskilde, Denmark) were coated with anti-placental alkaline phosphatase (anti-PLAP) monoclonal antibody (Medix Biotech, Foster City, CA) (2 Î¼g/ml in 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 9.5)). After blocking nonspecific binding sites with 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), the samples were titrated in T-PBS (0.02% Tween 20 in PBS). After incubation for 1 h at room temperature, the plates were washed with T-PBS, incubated with biotinylated rabbit anti-PLAP antibody diluted 1:500 for 1 h at room temperature, washed again, and incubated with peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) for 30 min. After washing, bound peroxidase was detected by 3,3â²-5,5â²-tetramethylbenzidine. The reaction was stopped by adding 1 N H2SO4, and the absorbance was read at 450 nm. Alkaline phosphatase (AP) activities were determined by a chemiluminescent assay using the Great EscApe Detection Kit (Clontech). Purified PLAP (Cosmo Bio) was used to generate standard curves. AP activities are expressed here as relative light unit/s; 1 pmol of SEAP(His)6 and LARC-SEAP(His)6 corresponds to approximately 8.7 Ã 107 and 1.7 Ã 108 relative light unit/s, respectively. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were isolated from venous blood obtained from healthy adult donors using Ficoll-Paque (Pharmacia Biotech). Monocytes and lymphocytes were incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-CD14 antibody and separated by MACS (Miltenyi Biotec, Bergisch, Germany). The purity of the cells was >98% as determined by flow cytometry on a FACStar Plus (Beckton Dickinson, Mountain View, CA). For displacement experiments, 2 Ã 105 cells were incubated for 1 h at room temperature with diluted supernatant containing 1 nM of SEAP(His)6 or LARC-SEAP(His)6 in the presence of increasing concentrations of unlabeled chemokines in 200 Î¼l of RPMI 1640 containing 20 mM HEPES (pH 7.4), 1% bovine serum albumin, and 0.02% sodium azide. MCP-1 and TARC were prepared as described (18Imai T. Yoshida T. Baba M. Nishimura M. Kakizaki M. Yoshie O. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21514-21521Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). MIP-1Î±/LD78Î±, RANTES, and interleukin-8 (IL-8) were purchased from PeproTech (Rocky Hill, NJ). For saturation experiments, cells were incubated for 1 h at 15Â°C with increasing concentrations of LARC-SEAP(His)6 in the presence or absence of 1 Î¼M unlabeled LARC. After incubation, cells were washed five times and lysed in 50 Î¼l of 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 1% Triton X-100. Samples were heated at 65Â°C for 10 min to inactivate cellular phosphatase and then centrifuged. Bound AP activity in 25 Î¼l of the lysate was determined by the chemiluminescence assay as described above. All samples were assayed in duplicate. The binding data were analyzed by the LIGAND program. To find new members of the human CC chemokine family, we have searched the dbEST with various CC chemokine amino acid sequences and nucleotide sequences. This search identified five novel CC chemokine-like molecules encoded by single-pass cDNA sequences. Four of these were mapped within a YAC contig containing the human CC chemokine gene cluster on chromosome 17q11.2, providing additional evidence that they are indeed CC chemokine members (20Boguski M.S. Lowe T.M.J. Tolstoshev C.M. Nat. Genet. 1993; 4: 332-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (1140) Google Scholar). Another molecule, later termed LARC (iver and ctivation-egulated hemokine (see below)), was encoded by EST sequences, D17181, D31065, D82589, T27336, and T27433 (GenBank accession numbers), but its gene was not present in the YAC contig (data not shown). Sequence length, orientation, and the cDNA library of each EST clone are shown in Fig. 1. To clone the full-length cDNA of LARC, we first utilized the RACE method. Since a preliminary reverse transcriptase-PCR analysis showed that the LARC mRNA is expressed in PMA-stimulated macrophage-like U937 cells, we used the cDNA prepared from the PMA-stimulated U937 mRNA for the RACE reaction.

This effect can also be elicited by the Î²2-adrenergic receptor but is not mimicked by elevation of intracellular cAMP levels. In the present work, we report that stimulation of the A2A-adenosine receptor and of the Î²2-adrenergic receptor activates mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAP kinase) in human endothelial cells based on the following criteria: adenosine analogues and Î²-adrenergic agonists cause an (i) increase in tyrosine phosphorylation of the p42 isoform and to a lesser extent of the p44 isoform of MAP kinase and (ii) stimulate the phosphorylation of myelin basic protein by MAP kinase; (iii) this is accompanied by a redistribution of the enzyme to the perinuclear region. Pretreatment of the cells with cholera toxin (to down-regulate GsÎ±) abolishes activation of MAP kinase by isoproterenol but not that induced by adenosine analogues. In addition, MAP kinase stimulation via the A2A-adenosine receptor is neither impaired following pretreatment of the cells with pertussis toxin (to block Gi-dependent pathways) nor affected by GF109203X (1 Î¼M; to inhibit typical protein kinase C isoforms) nor by a monoclonal antibody, which blocks epidermal growth factor-dependent signaling. In contrast, MAP kinase activation is blocked by PD 098059, an inhibitor of MAP kinase kinase 1 (MEK1) activation, which also blunts the A2A-adenosine receptor-mediated increase in [3H]thymidine incorporation. Activation of the A2A-adenosine receptor is associated with increased levels of GTP-bound p21ras. Thus, our experiments define stimulation of MAP kinase as the candidate cellular target mediating the mitogenic action of the A2A-adenosine receptor on primary human endothelial cells; the signaling pathway operates via p21ras and MEK1 but is independent of Gi, Gs, and the typical protein kinase C isoforms. This implies an additional G protein which links this prototypical Gs-coupled receptor to the MAP kinase cascade.

The animals were kept on standard laboratory diet and starved for 24 h before being sacrificed.

Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (213462) Google Scholar).Synthesis of Aminochrome and Related CompoundsOxidation of dopamine to aminochrome was performed as described previously (4Segura-Aguilar J. Lind C. Chem. Biol. Interact. 1989; 72: 309-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). The oxidizing agent was the Mn3+-pyrophosphate complex prepared as described by Archibald and Fridovich (23Archibald F.S. Fridovich I. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1982; 214: 452-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). Oxidation of 4-S-glutathionyl-5,6-dihydroxyindoline to 4-S-glutathionyl-5,6-dihydroxyindole was performed as described by Mason (24Mason H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1948; 172: 83-99Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Three-hundred microliters of 12 M HCl was added to 1 ml of 300 Î¼M 4-S-glutathionyl-5,6-dihydroxyindoline solution in 25 mM sodium phosphate, pH 6.5, to decrease the pH to 1.3. The reaction mixture was incubated for 30 min at room temperature. The absorption spectra before and after oxidation of the indoline ring to indole were recorded.Assay ConditionsConjugation of Aminochrome with GlutathioneThe standard assay system for measuring conjugation of aminochrome with GSH catalyzed by GSTs contained 0.1 M sodium phosphate, pH 6.5, 1 mM GSH, and 300 Î¼M aminochrome at 30Â°C. The reaction was started by the addition of GST. The reaction was recorded by monitoring the decrease in aminochrome absorption at 475 nm. The reaction rate was calculated by using the extinction coefficient of aminochrome of 3058 Mâ1 cmâ1 (4Segura-Aguilar J. Lind C. Chem. Biol. Interact. 1989; 72: 309-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar).Aminochrome Reduction Catalyzed by NADPH-Cytochrome P450 ReductaseThe assay system of 1 ml contained 50 mM Tris-Cl, pH 6.5, 0.25 M sucrose, 30 Î¼M aminochrome, 1 mM (when present) GSH, 60 Î¼g (when present) of GST M1-1 or 8 Î¼g (when present) of GST M2-2, and 250 Î¼M NADPH. The formation of aminochrome (4Segura-Aguilar J. Lind C. Chem. Biol. Interact. 1989; 72: 309-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar) was allowed to proceed for 2 min in the cuvette before the addition of GSH and NADPH. The reaction was started by the addition of GST and 5 Î¼g of purified NADPH-cytochrome P450 reductase at 30Â°C. The reaction was monitored by recording NADPH oxidation at 340 nm (using an extinction coefficient of 6220 Mâ1 cmâ1) (4Segura-Aguilar J. Lind C. Chem. Biol.

(King's Lynn, United Kingdom).NMR Studies of the Reaction ProductFor the structural analysis 300 Î¼M aminochrome and 1 mM GSH were incubated with 100 Î¼g of GST M1-1 in 100 ml of 0.1 M sodium phosphate, pH 6.5, for 30 min. The aqueous solution was diluted with 1-butanol and concentrated to 25 ml under reduced pressure. More 1-butanol was added, and the concentration procedure was repeated until all traces of water were removed. The resulting solution was concentrated to 0.5 ml. The residue was mixed with diethyl ether (10 ml), and acetic anhydride (0.5 ml) was added, followed by triethylamine (1 ml) and 4-dimethylaminopyridine (catalytic amount). The resultant mixture gave a clear solution after 10 min and was stirred for a further 2 h, during which time considerable darkening occurred. The reaction mixture was poured into saturated sodium hydrogen carbonate solution (50 ml), extracted with dichloromethane (5 Ã 50 ml), dried with sodium sulfate, and concentrated. The residue was purified on a silica gel column (0.5 Ã 20 cm) using a stepwise gradient of ethyl acetate in pentane (0-100%) followed by ethanol in ethyl acetate (0-30%) as eluent. The major fraction was isolated and analyzed in CDCl3 solution by NMR spectroscopy. NMR spectra were recorded at 399.78 MHz using a JEOL JNM400 spectrometer. Standard pulse sequences were used for double quantum-filtered COSY and NOESY (nuclear Overhauser enhancement spectroscopy) spectra; for the latter, mixing times were varied between 100 and 600 ms.DISCUSSIONAminochrome is the product of the oxidation of dopamine to o-quinone followed by cyclization of its aminoethyl chain at physiological pH. It has been proposed that the formation of aminochrome and the subsequent generation of reactive oxygen species are involved in the neurodegenerative processes that occur in dopaminergic neurons in the nigrostriatal system in Parkinson's disease (9Baez S. Linderson Y. Segura-Aguilar J. Biochem. Mol. Med. 1995; 54: 12-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 10Graham D.G. Neurotoxicology (Little Rock). 1984; 5: 83-96PubMed Google Scholar) and in the mesolimbic system in schizophrenia (11Cadet J.L. Kahler L.A. Neurosci. Biobehav. Rev. 1994; 18: 457-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 12Smythies J. Proc. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 1996; 263: 487-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar).The results presented in this paper demonstrate that human GSTs catalyze the reductive conjugation of aminochrome to 4-S-glutathionyl-5,6-dihydroxyindoline (Scheme 1). The NMR studies showed that the structure of the acetylated derivative produced for analysis was 4-S-[(acetylglutamoyl)-N-cysteinyl-N-glycinyl]-5,6-diacetoxyindole. We conclude that the structure of the product of the GST-catalyzed reaction is 4-S-glutathionyl-5,6-dihydroxyindoline since the spectrum of the corresponding oxidized (nonacetylated) compound, 4-S-glutathionyl-5,6-dihydroxyindole, is not the same as the conjugate (4-S-glutathionyl-5,6-dihydroxyindoline) enzymatically produced. The two peaks of 4-S-glutathionylleucoaminochrome at 278 and 295 nm are shifted to 295 and 307 nm in 4-S-glutathionyl-5,6-dihydroxyindole due to oxidation of the dihydroxyindoline followed by acid-catalyzed isomerization to indole during the workup and acylation procedures required for NMR analysis.GSTs are known to have broad and overlapping substrate specificities, but only a few of their numerous substrates are so markedly preferentially used by one isoenzyme as aminochrome. With this substrate, GST M2-2 has a specific activity >200-fold above that of any other GST (Table I). Another example is 2-cyano-1,3-dimethyl-1-nitrosoguanidine, for which GST M2-2 is also the most active enzyme by almost 2 orders of magnitude (26Mannervik B. Widersten M. Pacifici G.M. Fracchia G.N. Advances in Drug Metabolism in Man. European Commission, Luxembourg, Belgium1995: 407-459Google Scholar). The finding that aminochrome is an excellent GST substrate extends the number of physiologically occurring compounds that serve as substrates for GSTs. Aminochrome is a product of oxidative metabolism, like many other pathophysiologically relevant GST substrates such as alkenals and hydroperoxides generated by biological oxidations and radical reactions (27Berhane K. Widersten M. EngstrÃ¶m Ã. Kozarich J.W. Mannervik B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1480-1484Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar).NADPH-cytochrome P450 reductase and NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase catalyze one- and two-electron reduction of aminochrome to o-semiquinone and leucoaminochrome (o-hydroquinone), respectively. These products are oxidized by O2, yielding reactive oxygen species. However, a major difference in the rate of oxidation of o-semiquinone and o-hydroquinone forms has been observed (4Segura-Aguilar J. Lind C. Chem. Biol. Interact. 1989; 72: 309-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 9Baez S. Linderson Y. Segura-Aguilar J. Biochem. Mol. Med. 1995; 54: 12-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The autoxidation of o-semiquinone is too fast to be recorded by conventional steady-state kinetics, whereas the autoxidation of the o-hydroquinone can readily be monitored by the decrease in the quinone absorption peak at 475 nm. The lability of o-semiquinone and leucoaminochrome in the presence of oxygen contrasts with the chemical stability of 4-S-glutathionyl-5,6-dihydroxyindoline since no oxidation was observed during conjugation or after the completion of the reaction. The reactivity of 4-S-glutathionyl-5,6-dihydroxyindoline was found to be completely different from that of leucoaminochrome and o-semiquinone. Molecular oxygen (O2) is mainly responsible for oxidation of o-semiquinone (91% of the total oxygen-dependent autoxidation) (9Baez S. Linderson Y. Segura-Aguilar J. Biochem. Mol. Med. 1995; 54: 12-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), while superoxide radicals are mainly responsible for oxidation of the leucoaminochrome (89% of the total oxygen-dependent autoxidation) (4Segura-Aguilar J. Lind C. Chem. Biol. Interact. 1989; 72: 309-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 9Baez S. Linderson Y. Segura-Aguilar J. Biochem. Mol. Med. 1995; 54: 12-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). However, superoxide radicals, hydrogen peroxide, and molecular oxygen are not able to oxidize 4-S-glutathionyl-5,6-dihydroxyindoline under the conditions investigated.It seems reasonable to consider glutathione conjugation of aminochrome as a reaction terminating any possible redox cycling since it prevents the formation of reactive oxygen species during one- or two-electron reduction of aminochrome. It is obvious that a very small amount of aminochrome can give rise to a large production of reactive oxygen species due the redox cycling properties of aminochrome, emphasizing the importance of the glutathione conjugation. Our results show that GST M2-2, as well as GST M1-1, by a competing conjugation reaction prevents autoxidation otherwise elicited by the reduction of aminochrome catalyzed by NADPH-cytochrome P450 reductase (Fig. 5). One-electron reduction of aminochrome catalyzed by NADPH-cytochrome P450 reductase has been postulated to be the mechanism of formation of reactive oxygen species, which can cause neurodegeneration that in the nigrostriatal system may result in Parkinson's disease or in the mesolimbic system in schizophrenia (9Baez S. Linderson Y. Segura-Aguilar J. Biochem. Mol. Med. 1995; 54: 12-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar).The glutathione conjugation catalyzed by class Mu GSTs seems to be the most important of the reported antioxidant reactions related to aminochrome metabolism since this reaction prevents the redox cycling between oxidized and reduced forms of aminochrome as a consequence of the chemical stability of 4-S-glutathionyl-5,6-dihydroxyindoline. NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase has also been postulated to provide an important cellular defense against formation of reactive oxygen species since the reaction catalyzed by NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase competes with one-electron donors such as NADPH-cytochrome P450 reductase for the reduction of aminochrome to leucoaminochrome (4Segura-Aguilar J. Lind C. Chem. Biol. Interact. 1989; 72: 309-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). However, the antioxidant role of NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase is dependent on the presence of superoxide dismutase, catalase, or GSH peroxidase, which inhibit leucoaminochrome autoxidation, or on the action of conjugation enzymes such as sulfotransferase or catechol ortho-methyltransferase. It seems plausible that human subjects with low expression or lack of the genes coding for NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase, GST M1-1, and/or GST M2-2 will be at higher risk for neurodegeneration of the dopaminergic nigrostriatal or mesolimbic system, which may result in the development of Parkinson's disease and schizophrenia, respectively.We conclude that GST M2-2 efficiently catalyzes the conjugation of aminochrome, thus preventing the formation of reactive oxygen species. Other GSTs, such as the class Mu enzymes GST M1-1 and GST M3-3, also promote this conjugation reaction, albeit with much lower catalytic activities. We cannot disregard the possibility that other enzymes not yet tested also play a role in detoxication of aminochrome. An example is GST M5-5, which has been cloned from a cDNA library from the frontal cortex of human brain (28Takahashi Y. Campbell E.A. Hirata Y. Takayama T. Listowsky I. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8893-8898Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To establish the physiological relevance of the GST activity to neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's disease and schizophrenia, it is necessary to explore the regional distribution of GST M2-2 and other class Mu GSTs in the brain and in the dopaminergic system.

https://openalex.org/W2009676510,"The synthesis of prostaglandins (PGs) is regulated by the arachidonic acid release by phospholipase A2 (PLA2) and its conversion to PGs by cyclooxygenase (COX). In the present study, we examined the regulation of PG synthesis by interleukin (IL)-1Î± in primary mouse osteoblastic cells isolated from mouse calvaria. Although IL-1Î± greatly enhanced cox-2 mRNA expression and its protein levels, PGE2 was not produced until 24 h. When arachidonic acid was added to osteoblastic cells precultured with IL-1Î± for 24 h, PGE2 was produced within 10 min. Of several growth factors tested, platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) specifically initiated the rapid synthesis of PGE2, which was markedly suppressed by a selective inhibitor of cox-2 (NS-398). In mouse osteoblastic cells, cytosolic PLA2 (cPLA2) mRNA and its protein were constitutively expressed and increased approximately 2-fold by IL-1Î±, but secretory PLA2 mRNA was not detected. PDGF rapidly stimulated PLA2 activity, which was blocked completely by a cPLA2 inhibitor (arachidonyltrifluoromethyl ketone). The PDGF-induced cPLA2 activation was accompanied by phosphorylation of its protein. These results indicate that cox-2 induction by IL-1Î± is not sufficient, but cPLA2 activation by PDGF is crucial for IL-1Î±-induced PGE2 synthesis in mouse osteoblasts. The synthesis of prostaglandins (PGs) is regulated by the arachidonic acid release by phospholipase A2 (PLA2) and its conversion to PGs by cyclooxygenase (COX). In the present study, we examined the regulation of PG synthesis by interleukin (IL)-1Î± in primary mouse osteoblastic cells isolated from mouse calvaria. Although IL-1Î± greatly enhanced cox-2 mRNA expression and its protein levels, PGE2 was not produced until 24 h. When arachidonic acid was added to osteoblastic cells precultured with IL-1Î± for 24 h, PGE2 was produced within 10 min. Of several growth factors tested, platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) specifically initiated the rapid synthesis of PGE2, which was markedly suppressed by a selective inhibitor of cox-2 (NS-398). In mouse osteoblastic cells, cytosolic PLA2 (cPLA2) mRNA and its protein were constitutively expressed and increased approximately 2-fold by IL-1Î±, but secretory PLA2 mRNA was not detected. PDGF rapidly stimulated PLA2 activity, which was blocked completely by a cPLA2 inhibitor (arachidonyltrifluoromethyl ketone).

We have now identified neonatal rat cardiomyocyte mRNAs rapidly sensitive to doxorubicin, or its congener daunomycin, including transcripts of nuclear genes encoding enzymes critical in production of energy in cardiomyocytes: ADP/ATP translocase, a heart- and muscle-specific isoform; Reiske iron-sulfur protein (RISP), a ubiquitously expressed electron transport chain component; and a muscle isozyme of phosphofructokinase. Loss of these mRNAs following doxorubicin or daunomycin is evident as early as 2 h and precedes significant reduction of intracellular ATP. ATP levels in control cardiomyocytes (17.9 Â± 2.9 nM/mg of protein) fall only after 14 h and reach residual levels of 10.4 Â± 0.9 nM (doxorubicin; p = <0.006) and 6.7 Â± 1.9 nM (daunomycin; p = <0.001) by 24 h. Loss of mRNAs generating ATP was highly selective since mRNAs for other energy production enzymes, (cytochrome c, cytochrome b, and malate dehydrogenase), and genes important in glycolysis (pyruvate kinase and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase) were unaffected even at 24 and 48 h. The drugs had no effect on levels of ubiquitously expressed RISP mRNA in fibroblasts.

INTRODUCTIONWe have sought to explain the selective and cumulative dose-dependent cardiac toxicity of doxorubicin (Dox), 1The abbreviations used are:DoxdoxorubicinDndaunomycinANTADP/ATP translocaseRISPReiske iron-sulfur proteinPFKphosphofructokinasePCRpolymerase chain reaction. an anthracycline drug widely used for the treatment of various cancers. Biochemical and physiological data favor the hypothesis that the general antineoplastic cytotoxicity of anthracyclines stems from the formation of reactive free radical species whose intermediates interact with and damage cellular membranes (1Olson R.D. Mushlin P.S. FASEB J. 1990; 4: 3076-3086Crossref PubMed Scopus (622) Google Scholar). The interactions of free radicals, including Dox-Fe3+, with mitochondrial membranes and proteins of the respiratory chain (2Rajagopalan S. Politi P.M. Sinha B.K. Myers C.E. Cancer Res. 1988; 48: 4766-4769PubMed Google Scholar, 3Singal P.K. Siveski I.N. Hill M. Thomas T.P. Li T. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 1995; 27: 1055-1063Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar) may also account for the observed depletion of ATP in the hearts of Dox-treated animals (4Bianchi C. Bagnato A. Paggi M.G. Floridi A. Exp. Mol. Pathol. 1987; 46: 123-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 5Kapelko V.I. Veksler V.I. Popovich M.I. Biomed. Sci. 1990; 1: 77-83PubMed Google Scholar). While such events also clearly progress in myocardium, they do not explain the cardiospecific tissue toxicity of the anthracycline drugs that leads to the irreversible degenerative cardiomyopathy (6Singal P.K. Deally C.M. Weinberg L.E. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 1987; 19: 817-828Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar) and limits the amount of the drug that can be administered.Our previous work (7Kurabayashi M. Jeyaseelan R.

Biol. 1995; 15: 6386-6397Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) has focused on alternative mechanisms that might explain the cardioselective toxicity. Dox alters transcriptional events specific to the myocardium. Initially we demonstrated that Dox selectively inhibits the accumulation of mRNA of heart-specific genes in cardiomyocytes (10Ito H. Miller S.C. Billingham M.E. Akimoto H. Torti S.V. Wade R. Gahlmann R. Lyons G. Kedes L. Torti F.M. Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 4275-4279Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar) and inhibits the transcription of muscle-specific genes in skeletal muscle cells without affecting the transcription of housekeeping genes (7Kurabayashi M. Jeyaseelan R. Kedes L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5524-5529Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Our subsequent studies showed that Dox blocks such transcription at least in part due to the transcriptional induction of a dominant negative regulator, Id (11Kurabayashi M. Jeyaseelan R. Kedes L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6031-6039Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and possibly also by inhibiting the DNA binding capacity of transcription factors active in cardiomyocytes such as MEF2 (11Kurabayashi M. Jeyaseelan R. Kedes L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6031-6039Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Id can form heterodimers through its helix-loop-helix motif with E proteins (which are ubiquitously expressed basic helix-loop-helix proteins) and thus prevent the formation of functional E proteins heterodimers (12Benezra R. Davis R.L. Lockshon D. Turner D.L. Weintraub H. Cell. 1990; 61: 49-59Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1791) Google Scholar). More recently we demonstrated by several criteria that Dox-induced protein kinase-mediated phosphorylation is involved in myofibrillar degeneration (13Sussman M.A. Hamm-Alvarez S.F. Vilalta P.M. Welch S. Kedes L. Circ. Res. 1997; 80: 52-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) and that the activation of specific regulatory elements in the Id promoter by Dox is mediated through novel Dox-induced kinase signaling pathways independent of Ca2+/phospholipid-dependent protein kinase (protein kinase C), cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase (protein kinase A) and tyrosine kinase (9Kurabayashi M. Dutta S. Jeyaseelan R. Kedes L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6386-6397Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar).Although the generation of free radicals by Dox occurs in all cell types, it might yet play a critical role in initiating these cardiac-sensitive transcriptional events. This form of oxidative stress alters the structure and function of lipid components that act as precursors of second messengers (14Trush M.A. Kensler T.W. Free Radical Biol. Med. 1991; 10: 201-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). In this way Dox could indirectly effect the activation of Ca2+/phospholipid-dependent protein kinase C and the regulation of the concentration of free cytosolic Ca2+ (15Nishizuka Y. Science. 1992; 258: 607-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (4214) Google Scholar, 16Asaoka Y. Nakamura S. Yoshida K. Nishizuka Y. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1992; 17: 414-417Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar, 17Nishizuka Y. Neurosci. Res. 1992; 15: 3-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), thus interfering with many inositol phospholipid-mediated signaling events including the alteration of tissue-specific transcriptional programs. In our search for additional cardiocyte expression programs that might be selectively disrupted by Dox, we have discovered that within several hours Dox dramatically and selectively suppresses the expression of several nuclear genes encoding enzymes that play central roles in normal energy production. One of these genes, ADP/ATP translocase, is a heart- and muscle-specific isoform. A second encodes the Reiske iron-sulfur protein, a ubiquitously expressed component of the electron transport chain. A third mRNA, encoding the critical metabolic enzyme 6-phosphofructo-1-kinase, is a muscle isozyme (M), which is the most abundant isoform in heart muscle (18Dunaway G.A. Kasten T.P. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 1985; 17: 947-957Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar).DISCUSSIONDoxorubicin is a highly effective cytotoxic antineoplastic agent used in a wide variety of malignancies. Its use is limited because of a cumulative, dose-dependent irreversible cardiomyopathy observed in patients who receive a dose of greater than 550 mg/m2 (6Singal P.K. Deally C.M. Weinberg L.E. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 1987; 19: 817-828Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar). Previous reports revealed that the level of ATP in the perfused heart is reduced following Dox treatment (4Bianchi C. Bagnato A. Paggi M.G. Floridi A. Exp. Mol. Pathol. 1987; 46: 123-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 27Azuma J. Sperelakis N. Hasegawa H. Tanimoto T. Vogel S. Ogura K. Awata N. Sawamura A. Harada H. Ishiyama T. Morita Y.

Physiol. 1991; 261: 39-44PubMed Google Scholar). Isolated mitochondria from Dox-treated hearts also showed uncoupling of oxidative phosphorylation (6Singal P.K. Deally C.M. Weinberg L.E. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 1987; 19: 817-828Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar). However, the molecular mechanisms that lead to reduced levels of ATP are unclear.Following exposure to Dox there are rapidly reduced levels of mRNAs for key enzymes responsible for fundamental energy production in myocardiocytes, including ANT1, RISP, and PFK. Although the loss of templates for sarcomeric proteins that we have reported earlier may well contribute to the myofibrillar degeneration that is a hallmark of Dox-induced cardiotoxicity (7Kurabayashi M. Jeyaseelan R. Kedes L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5524-5529Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Kurabayashi M. Dutta S. Jeyaseelan R. Kedes L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6386-6397Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 11Kurabayashi M. Jeyaseelan R. Kedes L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6031-6039Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the rapid changes in ATP production that would follow from reduction of these key metabolic enzymatic activities might well be more central to the effects of the anthracycline drugs. The depletion of cytosolic ATP would likely lead to more serious consequences in the heart compared to most other organs since the heart needs a continuous supply of ATP for its uninterrupted contraction-relaxation cycle. This could be one of the reasons why Dox damages the heart while other organs are relatively unaffected.A less likely possibility is that Dox damages the mitochondria and depletes ATP stores and subsequent feedback mechanisms repress expression of the nuclear genes we have evaluated. We are unaware of any studies that demonstrate a negative feedback by depletion of mitochondrial energy stores on nuclear-encoded genes involved in energy production. Furthermore, the kinetics of our observations strongly suggests that the transcriptional effects of the drugs precedes significant effects on intracellular energy stores. Whether we consider as evidence the persistence of cell beating or of ATP levels, it is most likely that the effects of the drugs on intracellular energy stores at least follow their impact on transcription of specific genes. Finally, the transcriptional inhibition appears to be highly selective, since other nuclear genes that encode components of the electron transport chain are unaffected. If the mechanism of transcriptional repression were a feedback secondary to general depletion of energy stores or nonselective mitochondrial damage, a more general effect on gene expression might be expected.Several alternative mechanisms may explain the selective effects of Dox on gene expression in the heart. Dox generates free radicals that lead to lipid peroxidation and membrane instability including leakage of calcium by the sarcoplasmic reticulum (1Olson R.D. Mushlin P.S. FASEB J. 1990; 4: 3076-3086Crossref PubMed Scopus (622) Google Scholar, 2Rajagopalan S. Politi P.M. Sinha B.K. Myers C.E.

Such events may directly impact intracellular signaling pathways that initiate in the membrane and also involve intracellular calcium homeostasis (1Olson R.D. Mushlin P.S. FASEB J. 1990; 4: 3076-3086Crossref PubMed Scopus (622) Google Scholar, 30Singal P.K. Pierce G.N. Am. J. Physiol. 1986; 250: H419-H425PubMed Google Scholar, 37Singal P.K. Forbes M.S. Sperelakis N. Can. J. Physiol. Pharmacol. 1984; 62: 1239-1244Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), but these would not necessarily be cardiac-specific effects. However, the up-regulation of dominant transcriptional repressors such as Id or interference with the function of critical cardiac transcriptional activators such as MEF2 (1Olson R.D. Mushlin P.S. FASEB J. 1990; 4: 3076-3086Crossref PubMed Scopus (622) Google Scholar, 7Kurabayashi M. Jeyaseelan R. Kedes L. J. Biol.

Chem. 1994; 269: 6031-6039Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) might play a key role in the myocardiocyte response to Dox. Since ANT1 is a cardiac-specific isoform, its repression would be cardiac-limited.A number of genes expressed both in the myocardium and in skeletal muscle have cardiac- and muscle-specific transcription regulatory elements (38Christensen T.H. Prentice H. Gahlmann R. Kedes L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 6752-6765Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 39Parmacek M.S. Vora A.J. Shen T. Barr E. Jung F. Leiden J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 1967-1976Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). It will be of interest to determine whether the RISP or PFK promoters contain two sets of cis-acting regulatory elements, those that interact with ubiquitous transcription factors and those that are active only in myocardium. In the event, interference by Dox with such cardiac regulatory effectors would selectively reduce only cardiac expression of the RISP or PFK genes. Alternatively we have not ruled out the possibility that the RISP or PFK mRNAs represent cardiac specific transcripts.ADP/ATP translocase, a key protein involved in aerobic energy metabolism in every cell type, is located in the inner mitochondrial membrane. There are three known isoforms, ANT1, ANT2, and ANT3, each encoded by a nuclear gene (40Lunardi J. Attardi G. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 16534-16540Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 41Lunardi J. Hurko O. Engel W.K. Attardi G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15267-15270Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Based on the energy requirements, the expression patterns of the different isoforms varies leading to alterations in the ADP/ATP transport functions. For example, the ANT expression patterns are different in liver and heart mitochondria, as are the kinetics of ADP/ATP exchange, and also vary under changing conditions of energy demand (42Klingenberg M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1989; 270: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar, 43Klingenberg M. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1993; 25: 447-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) or at different stages of human muscle development (40Lunardi J. Attardi G. J. Biol.

Chem. 1991; 266: 16534-16540Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 41Lunardi J. Hurko O. Engel W.K. Attardi G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15267-15270Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) nuclear-encoded mitochondrial isoform. ANT1 translocates newly synthesized ATP from inner side of the mitochondria to the cytosol, and ADP from cytosol to the inner side of the mitochondria (44Brandolin G. Le S.A. Trezeguet V. Lauquin G.J. Vignais P.V. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1993; 25: 459-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). This polypeptide constitutes almost 10% of the total inner mitochondrial membrane protein, and its function is critical in maintenance of cytosolic ATP concentration (44Brandolin G. Le S.A. Trezeguet V. Lauquin G.J. Vignais P.V. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1993; 25: 459-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar).RISP is also a nuclear-encoded mitochondrial protein (29Ohnishi T. Sled V.D. Rudnitzky N.I. Meinhardt S.W. Yagi T. Hatefi Y. Link T. von Jagow G. Saribas A.S. Daldal F. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1994; 22: 191-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar, 45Thomson A.J. Breton J. George S.J. Butt J.N. Armstrong F.A. Hatchikian E.C. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1991; 19: 594-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). RISP contains a [2Fe-2S] cluster, an integral part of the cytochrome bc1 complex, essential for the electron transport system in mitochondria and for the synthesis of ATP (29Ohnishi T. Sled V.D. Rudnitzky N.I. Meinhardt S.W. Yagi T. Hatefi Y. Link T. von Jagow G. Saribas A.S. Daldal F. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1994; 22: 191-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar, 45Thomson A.J. Breton J. George S.J. Butt J.N. Armstrong F.A. Hatchikian E.C. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1991; 19: 594-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). The cytochrome bc1 complex could not perform its function without RISP because of the lack of iron-sulfur reaction centers (28Brandt U. Trumpower B. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1994; 29: 165-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar, 45Thomson A.J. Breton J. George S.J. Butt J.N. Armstrong F.A. Hatchikian E.C. Biochem. Soc.

Repression of RISP would disrupt the electron transport chain and drastically reduce ATP production. Within a matter of a few hours Dox rapidly depletes the myocardiocyte, but not HeLa or 10T1/2 cells, of the nuclear-encoded RISP mRNA, and by 24 h there is no trace of residual messenger. It appears that only the transcriptional program that regulates RISP in cardiomyocytes but not in non-muscle cells is sensitive to Dox.PFK, the third mRNA we found to be selectively depressed by Dox treatment of cardiocytes, encodes a key enzyme in the glycolytic pathway (49Depre C. Veitch K. Hue L. Acta Cardiol. 1993; 48: 147-164PubMed Google Scholar). Clinical PFK deficiency is often associated with severe myopathic symptoms attesting to its role in maintaining energy stores (50Gekakis N. Sul H.S.

Cardiol. 1985; 17: 947-957Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) but is also expressed in non-muscle tissues (56Dunaway G.A. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1983; 52: 75-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 57Dunaway G.A. Kasten T.P. Sebo T. Trapp R. Biochem. J. 1988; 251: 677-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar).Depletion of any one of these three proteins would likely have severe consequences on ATP production in cardiomyocytes. Dox exposure clearly led to a significant reduction of ATP content (Fig. 3B). As argued earlier, we infer that the down-regulation of these three mRNAs and, presumably, the proteins they encode, is responsible, at least in part, for the subsequent depletion of ATP. The heart in particular has a continuous need for ATP and energy. Depletion of cytosolic ATP eventually leads to diminution of the strength of cardiac contraction-relaxation. Moreover, the assembly and maintenance of myofilaments is dependent on ATP. Thus, in addition to the down-regulation of contractile protein gene expression by Dox, depletion of cellular ATP stores may also directly contribute to the myofibrillar degeneration associated with Dox cytotoxicity.Although it has been known that the ATP content in the whole heart is depleted after treatment of animals with Dox (6Singal P.K.

One outcome of our studies clearly establishes that Dox or Dn treatment is associated with a decrease of ATP in cardiomyocytes.Do these observations allow us to propose a more unified hypothesis regarding the mechanisms of Dox cardiotoxicity? In Fig. 5 we have attempted to represent some testable connections between these complex observation. Generation of free radicals and subsequent peroxidation of lipid membranes by Dox could be responsible for most if not all subsequent events. The link between membrane damage and subsequent perturbations of intracellular second messenger signaling pathways remains a likely possibility. Such events could well be responsible for the transcriptional events we have observed including the induction of the negative regulator Id and the subsequent suppression of tissue-specific transcript including those encoding myofibrillar proteins and proteins of the key energy production pathways described here. These events as well as direct membrane injury to mitochondria could both contribute to the depletion of intracellular ATP stores, myofibrillar degeneration, and the subsequent cardiotoxic effects. INTRODUCTIONWe have sought to explain the selective and cumulative dose-dependent cardiac toxicity of doxorubicin (Dox), 1The abbreviations used are:DoxdoxorubicinDndaunomycinANTADP/ATP translocaseRISPReiske iron-sulfur proteinPFKphosphofructokinasePCRpolymerase chain reaction. an anthracycline drug widely used for the treatment of various cancers. Biochemical and physiological data favor the hypothesis that the general antineoplastic cytotoxicity of anthracyclines stems from the formation of reactive free radical species whose intermediates interact with and damage cellular membranes (1Olson R.D. Mushlin P.S. FASEB J. 1990; 4: 3076-3086Crossref PubMed Scopus (622) Google Scholar). The interactions of free radicals, including Dox-Fe3+, with mitochondrial membranes and proteins of the respiratory chain (2Rajagopalan S. Politi P.M. Sinha B.K. Myers C.E. Cancer Res. 1988; 48: 4766-4769PubMed Google Scholar, 3Singal P.K. Siveski I.N. Hill M. Thomas T.P. Li T. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 1995; 27: 1055-1063Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar) may also account for the observed depletion of ATP in the hearts of Dox-treated animals (4Bianchi C. Bagnato A. Paggi M.G. Floridi A. Exp. Mol. Pathol. 1987; 46: 123-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 5Kapelko V.I. Veksler V.I. Popovich M.I. Biomed. Sci. 1990; 1: 77-83PubMed Google Scholar). While such events also clearly progress in myocardium, they do not explain the cardiospecific tissue toxicity of the anthracycline drugs that leads to the irreversible degenerative cardiomyopathy (6Singal P.K. Deally C.M. Weinberg L.E. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 1987; 19: 817-828Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar) and limits the amount of the drug that can be administered.Our previous work (7Kurabayashi M. Jeyaseelan R.

Dox alters transcriptional events specific to the myocardium. Initially we demonstrated that Dox selectively inhibits the accumulation of mRNA of heart-specific genes in cardiomyocytes (10Ito H. Miller S.C. Billingham M.E. Akimoto H. Torti S.V. Wade R. Gahlmann R. Lyons G. Kedes L. Torti F.M. Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Jeyaseelan R. Kedes L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5524-5529Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Our subsequent studies showed that Dox blocks such transcription at least in part due to the transcriptional induction of a dominant negative regulator, Id (11Kurabayashi M. Jeyaseelan R. Kedes L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6031-6039Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and possibly also by inhibiting the DNA binding capacity of transcription factors active in cardiomyocytes such as MEF2 (11Kurabayashi M. Jeyaseelan R. Kedes L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6031-6039Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Id can form heterodimers through its helix-loop-helix motif with E proteins (which are ubiquitously expressed basic helix-loop-helix proteins) and thus prevent the formation of functional E proteins heterodimers (12Benezra R. Davis R.L. Lockshon D. Turner D.L. Weintraub H. Cell. 1990; 61: 49-59Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1791) Google Scholar). More recently we demonstrated by several criteria that Dox-induced protein kinase-mediated phosphorylation is involved in myofibrillar degeneration (13Sussman M.A. Hamm-Alvarez S.F. Vilalta P.M. Welch S. Kedes L. Circ. Res. 1997; 80: 52-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) and that the activation of specific regulatory elements in the Id promoter by Dox is mediated through novel Dox-induced kinase signaling pathways independent of Ca2+/phospholipid-dependent protein kinase (protein kinase C), cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase (protein kinase A) and tyrosine kinase (9Kurabayashi M.

This tagged hormone has intact biological activity, high affinity and specific binding to the receptor, and enhanced fluorescent emission upon receptor binding. Using BODIPY-calcitriol, here we monitored the subcellular distribution of VDR in living cultured cells by microscopy. Time course studies showed that an equilibrium between the cytoplasmic and nuclear hormone binding developed within 5 min and was maintained thereafter. We found a substantial proportion of VDR residing in the cytoplasm, colocalized with endoplasmic reticulum, the Golgi complex, and microtubules. Confocal microscopy clarified the presence of VDR within discrete regions of the nucleus and along the nuclear envelope. There was no VDR in the plasma membrane. Low affinity BODIPY-calcitriol binding sites were in the mitochondria. Mutations in the VDR gene selectively and specifically altered BODIPY-calcitriol distribution. Defects in the hormone binding region of VDR prevented both nuclear and cytoplasmic hormone binding. Defects in the DNA binding region decreased the nuclear retention of VDR and prevented localization to nuclear foci. These results with BODIPY-calcitriol reveal cytoplasmic VDR localization in living cells and open the possibility of studying the three-dimensional architecture of intranuclear target sites.

In the present studies we have examined the location of thrombin receptors in resting platelets and followed their redistribution during platelet activation. The results reveal several new aspects of thrombin receptor biology. 1) On resting platelets, approximately two-thirds of the receptors were located in the plasma membrane. The remainder were present in the membranes of the surface connecting system. 2) When platelets were activated by ADP or a thromboxane analog, thrombin receptors that were initially in the surface connecting system were exposed on the platelet surface, increasing the number of detectable receptors by 40% and presumably making them available for subsequent activation by thrombin. 3) Platelet activation by thrombin rapidly abolished the binding of the antibodies whose epitopes are sensitive to receptor cleavage and left the platelets in a state refractory to both thrombin and the agonist peptide, SFLLRN. This was accompanied by a 60% decrease in the binding of receptor antibodies directed COOH-terminal to the cleavage site irrespective of whether the receptors were activated proteolytically by thrombin or nonproteolytically by SFLLRN. 4) The loss of antibody binding sites caused by thrombin was due in part to receptor internalization and in part to the shedding of thrombin receptors into membrane microparticles, especially under conditions in which aggregation was allowed to occur. However, at least 40% of the cleaved receptors remained on the platelet surface. 5) Lacking the ability to synthesize new receptors and lacking an intracellular reserve of preformed receptors comparable to that found in endothelial cells, platelets were unable to repopulate their surface with intact receptors following exposure to thrombin. This difference underlies the ability of endothelial cells to recover responsiveness to thrombin rapidly while platelets do not, despite the presence on both of the same receptor for thrombin.

https://openalex.org/W2127209361,"The previously demonstrated functional and physical interaction of the SH2 domain protein-tyrosine phosphatase SHP-1 with the epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor (Tomic, S., Greiser, U., Lammers, R., Kharitonenkov, A., Imyanitov, E., Ullrich, A., and BÃ¶hmer, F. D. (1995) J. Biol. Chem. 270, 21277-21284) was investigated with respect to the involved structural elements of SHP-1. Various mutants of SHP-1 were transiently expressed in 293 or COS-7 cells and analyzed for their capacity to associate with immobilized autophosphorylated EGF receptor in vitro and to dephosphorylate coexpressed EGF receptor in intact cells. Inactivating point mutation of the C-terminal SH2 domain reduced the association weakly, point mutation of the N-terminal SH2 domain reduced association strongly and the respective double mutation abolished association totally. The capacity of SHP-1 to dephosphorylate coexpressed EGF receptor was impaired by all point mutations.

As native SHP-2, the chimera lacked activity toward the receptor when they contained the catalytic domain of SHP-2, despite their capacity to associate with the receptor and to dephosphorylate an artificial phosphopeptide.

The phosphorylation level of activated growth factor receptors with endowed tyrosine kinase activity is the net result of tyrosine specific autophosphorylation (1Ullrich A. Schlessinger J.

Since important aspects of receptor signaling depend on receptor autophosphorylation, the dephosphorylation reaction is believed to attenuate the receptor signal. Therefore, the identification and characterization of the PTPs involved in growth factor receptor dephosphorylation is of high interest. The SH2 domains containing PTPs SHP-1 and SHP-2 (2Feng G.S.

One important pathway seems to involve tyrosine phosphorylation of receptor-bound SHP-2 at the C terminus, which leads to subsequent association of Grb2 and activation of the Sos/Ras/Raf/MAPK-signaling cascade (10Bennett A.M.

SHP-2 and SHP-1 enzyme activity is negatively controlled by the N-terminal SH2 domain.

With some low molecular weight substrates in vitro, in particular p-nitrophenylphosphate at acidic pH, SHP-1 exhibits a higher intrinsic activity than SHP-2 (22Zhao Z. Bouchard P. Diltz C.D.

Chem. 1994; 269: 8780-8785Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). SHP-1 seems to be involved in negative regulation of receptor signaling and in receptor dephosphorylation in hematopoietic cells, as has been shown for Kit/SCF receptor (24Yi T. Ihle J.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 3350-3358Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar) and CSF-1 receptor (25Chen H.E. Chang S. Trub T. Neel B.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 3685-3697Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Also, receptors without intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity including the erythropoietin receptor (26Klingmuller U. Lorenz U. Cantley L.C. Neel B.G. Lodish H.F. Cell. 1995; 80: 729-738Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (842) Google Scholar), the interleukin-3 receptor (27Yi T.L. Mui A.L.F. Krystal G. Ihle J.N. Mol. Cell.

Science. 1995; 268: 293-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar) are subject to negative regulation by SHP-1. Interaction of the erythropoietin receptor with SHP-1 is mediated by the N-terminal SH2 domain of the PTP recognizing the sequence PHLK(P)Y429LYLV in the phosphorylated cytoplasmic domain of the receptor. Recruitment of SHP-1 to the erythropoietin receptor leads to strong elevation of its PTP activity and dephosphorylation of the receptor-associated tyrosine kinase JAK-2 and possibly other tyrosine phosphorylated targets in the proximity of the receptor. In turn, the erythropoietin signal is attenuated (26Klingmuller U. Lorenz U. Cantley L.C. Neel B.G. Lodish H.F. Cell. 1995; 80: 729-738Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (842) Google Scholar). Interaction of SHP-1 with the FcÎ³IIB1 receptor is mediated via the C-terminal SH2 domain of the PTP, recognizing the phosphopeptide sequence ENL(P)YEGLN (28D'Ambrosio D. Hippen K.L. Minskoff S.A. Mellman I. Pani G. Siminovitch K.A. Cambier J.C. Science. 1995; 268: 293-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar). For the CSF-1 receptor, no direct association of SHP-1 has been detectable (24Yi T. Ihle J.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 3350-3358Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). In this case, the interaction leading to negative regulation might be mediated by the adapter protein Grb2 and another as yet unidentified Mr 130,000 adapter protein (25Chen H.E. Chang S. Trub T. Neel B.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 3685-3697Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Comparatively little is known about the physiological substrates of SHP-2. SHP-2 potently dephosphorylates its own C terminus, and therefore one function of its PTP activity might be to regulate its own phosphorylation state and thus signaling activity mediated by the C-terminal Grb2-association (29Stein-Gerlach M.S. Kharitonenkov A. Vogel W. Ali S. Ullrich A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24635-24637Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Recently, the Drosophila protein daughter of sevenless (DOS) has been identified as a target of corkscrew, the Drosophila homolog of SHP-2 (30Herbst R. Carroll P.M. Allard J.D. Schilling J. Raabe T. Simon M.A. Cell. 1996; 85: 899-909Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). It has, therefore, been speculated that mammalian homologs of DOS do exist and possibly present preferred cellular substrates for SHP-2 (30Herbst R. Carroll P.M. Allard J.D. Schilling J. Raabe T. Simon M.A. Cell. 1996; 85: 899-909Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Apart from hematopoietic cells, SHP-1 is also expressed in epithelial cells (31Shen S.H. Bastien L. Posner B.I. Chretien P. Nature. 1991; 352: 736-739Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar, 32Banville D. Stocco R. Shen S.H. Genomics. 1995; 27: 165-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) and might be important for modulation of resident receptors in these cells. In an attempt to identify PTPs involved in negative regulation of the EGF receptor, we characterized PTP activity copurifying with the receptor from A431 human epidermoid carcinoma cells (5Tomic S. Greiser U. Lammers R. Kharitonenkov A. Imyanitov E. Ullrich A. BÃ¶hmer F.-D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21277-21284Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Both SHP-1 and SHP-2 were present in the receptor preparations and also associated with the EGF receptor in vitro and in intact A431 cells. We found that SHP-1 avidly dephosphorylates autophosphorylated EGF receptor in vitro and upon transient coexpression with the receptor in 293 cells and presumably contributes to EGF receptor dephosphorylation in A431 cells. SHP-2 had no detectable activity toward the receptor (5Tomic S. Greiser U. Lammers R. Kharitonenkov A. Imyanitov E. Ullrich A. BÃ¶hmer F.-D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21277-21284Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). To better understand the SHP-1/EGF receptor interaction and the structural basis for the strikingly different activity of SHP-1 and SHP-2 toward the receptor, we generated a series of SHP-1 mutants and chimeric PTPs from SHP-1 and SHP-2 and analyzed them with respect to association with the EGF receptor and receptor dephosphorylation. We find that both SH2 domains of SHP-1 are important for interaction with the receptor and that the capacity for receptor dephosphorylation is determined by the catalytic domain. The SHP-1 cDNA used throughout this study was obtained by standard procedures from an SK-BR3 cDNA library and corresponds to the 597-amino acid splice variant of SHP-1, which is predominantly expressed in epithelial cells (32Banville D. Stocco R. Shen S.H. Genomics. 1995; 27: 165-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). The N-terminal sequence and numbering is identical to the one depicted in Shen et al. (31Shen S.H. Bastien L. Posner B.I. Chretien P. Nature. 1991; 352: 736-739Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). Thus, Arg-32 and Arg-138 in our SHP-1 variant correspond to Arg-30 and Arg-136, respectively, of hematopoietic SHP-1 (33Plutzky J. Neel B.G. Rosenberg R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 1123-1127Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). All PCR reactions were carried out with Pfu polymerase (Stratagene, Heidelberg) for 25 cycles. All cloning operations were carried out with the respective DNAs in pBluescript KS(â) (Stratagene, Heidelberg). The final constructs were verified by DNA sequencing (T7 sequencing kit, Pharmacia, Uppsala) and subsequently subcloned into the eucaryotic expression vector pRK5 RS (34Lammers R. Bossenmaier B. Cool D.E. Tonks N.K. Schlessinger J. Fischer E.H. Ullrich A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22456-22462Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The Arg-32 â Lys (R32K) mutation in the N-terminal SH2 domain was generated by PCR-based mutagenesis, using the primers 1C-E, 5â²-AAG AAT TCC CCT ACA GAG AGA TGC TGT CC-3â²; RKNSH2, 5â²-CAC GGA AGC TTC CTG GCT AAG CCC AGT CGC AAG AAC C-3â²; RKNSH2r, 5â²-CCA GGA AGC TTC CGT GGA CAC CTC GGC CC-3â²; and 2C, 5â²-CCG GAA TTC GGC GCC TGA GGC CTC CTC AAT-3â². The PCR fragments generated with the primer pairs 1C-E/RKNSH2r and RKNSH2/2C and SHP-1 DNA as a template were cloned separately into pBluescript KS (EcoRI-HindIII, HindIII-KpnI) and subsequently joined. A part of the resulting joined DNA fragment containing the mutated sequence was excised by digestion with EcoRI-BamHI and exchanged with the corresponding DNA stretch of native SHP-1 DNA to yield SHP-1 R32K. Mutation of Arg-138 in the C-terminal SH2 domain was carried out similarly, by using primers 1C-E; RKCSH2, 5â²-GAG CCA TGG ACG TTT CTT GTG AAG GAG AGC CTC AGC CAG3-â²; RKCSH2r, 5â²-AAA CGT CCA TGG CTC GCC CTT GGC CTG CAG-3â²; and C-HCS, 5â²-CAA TGT CAC AGT CCA GGC CC-3â². The two PCR fragments obtained with the primer pairs 1C-E/RKCSH2r and RKCSH2/C-HCS) were cloned into pBluescript, reisolated, and thereafter ligated together. BstEII digestion of this construct yielded a fragment containing the mutated sequence which was used to replace the normal corresponding part in SHP-1 to yield SHP-1 R138K. Exchange of this fragment in SHP-1 R32K yielded the double point mutant SHP-1 R32K,R138K. To obtain SHP-1ÎSH2, SHP-1 DNA was digested with BstEII and EcoRI. This treatment removed all DNA 5â² of the codon for Met-172, leaving Met-172 intact. To obtain SHP-1 ÎN-SH2, SHP-1 DNA was digested with BamHI and XhoI, and the ends were filled with Pfu polymerase. This fragment was ligated into EcoRV-digested pRK5 RS. Ligation of the filled BamHI 5â²-end of the SHP-1 fragment to the 3â²-end of the EcoRV-digested vector generated a Met-codon in frame with the remaining sequence of SHP-1 (amino acids 56-597). SHP-1ÎN-SH2, R138K was obtained by the identical procedure from SHP-1 R138K. The chimera are composed of SH2 domains (SH2), the âhingeâ part (hg), and the catalytic part (CAT) derived from SHP-1 or SHP-2 and are designated as depicted in Fig. 1, using raised â1â or â2â to indicate the origin of the respective domain. Chimera SH21hg1CAT2, SH22hg2CAT1, SH21hg2CAT2, and SH22hg1CAT1 were obtained by PCR amplification of SHP-1 and SHP-2 fragments with suitable cloning sites at one end and EcoRI sites at the internal ends intended for the fusion. The individual fragments were initially separately cloned into pBluescript KS and subsequently joined. Employing this method, an additional Glu-Phe dipeptide sequence corresponding to the EcoRI site was introduced at the fusion site of these chimeric molecules. SH21hg1CAT2 was constructed using the primers 1C, 5â²-AGA TCA AGC TTC CCT ACA GAG AGA TGC TGT CC-3â², and 5C, 5â²-CCG GAA TTC GTT CTC TGG CCG CTG CCC-3â², to amplify an SH21hg1fragment with a 5â² HindIII and a 3â² EcoRI site from SHP-1 DNA. The CAT2 fragment with a 5â² EcoRI site and a 3â² XbaI site was generated using the primers 6D, 5â²-CCG GAA TTC AAA AAT AGA TAT AAA AAC ATC CTG CCC-3â², and 4D, 5â²-CTA GTC TAG ATC ATC TGA AAC TTT TCT GCT GTT G3-â², and SHP-2 DNA as a template. Both fragments were cloned in pBluescript KS, joined at the EcoRI site, and subcloned in pRK5 RS. SH22hg2CAT1 was assembled in the same way from SH22hg2 (5â² HindIII, primers 1D, 5â²-AGA TCA AGC TTG GGA GGA ACA TGA CAT CGC GG-3â² and 5D, 5â²-CCG GAA TTC GTT TTT GTT TTC TTG CCT TTG ACC-3â², template SHP-2), and CAT1 (primers 6C, 5â²-CCG GAA TTC AAG GGC AAG AAC CGC TAC AAG-3â² and 4C, 5â²-CTA GTC TAG AGG ACA GCA CCG CTC ACT TCC T-3â², 3â² XbaI). SH21hg2CAT2 was assembled from SH21 (5â² HindIII, primers 1C and 2C) and hg2CAT2 (primers 3D, 5â²-CCG GAA TTC CTT AAC ACG ACT CGT ATA AAT GC-3â², and 4D). SH22hg1CAT1was assembled from SH22 (primers 1D and 2D, 5â²-CCG GAA TTC GGG CTG CTT GAG TTG TAG TAC-3â²) and hg1CAT1 (primers 3C, 5â²-CCG GAA TTC GTC TAC CTG CGG CAG CCG TAC-3â², and 4C). To obtain chimera SH22hg2/1CAT1, a fragment of SHP-2 DNA comprising the sequence corresponding to the SH2 domains and part of the hinge domain was amplified using primers D-Nt, 5â²-CCC GAA TTC ATG ACA TCG CGG AGA TGG-3â², and D-int, 5â²-CCC GAA TTC TTC CCA AAA GCC TTG TTT-3â², and a fragment of SHP-1 DNA comprising the sequence corresponding to part of the hinge domain and the catalytic part including the C-terminal tail was amplified using the primers C-int, 5â²-CCC GAA TTC GAG AGT TTG CAG AAG CAG-3â², and C-Ct, 5â²-CCC CTC GAG TCA CTT CCT CTT GAG GGA-3â². The internal primers generated new EcoRI sites between Glu-249 and Phe-250 in SHP-1 and correspondingly Glu-250 and Phe-251 in SHP-2 without changing the corresponding amino acid sequence GFWEEF in this part of the hinge region, which is identical in both PTPs. The fragments were cloned into pBluescript KS, fused using the newly created EcoRI sites, and subcloned into pRK5 RS. To obtain the chimera SHP-1 tail2, an existing PstI site in the DNA corresponding to the highly conserved amino acid sequence VHCSAG (SHP-1 AS 453-458 or SHP-2 AS 457-462) was used. A DNA fragment corresponding to the last 135 amino acids of SHP-2 was excised with PstI from the previously generated CAT2 DNA and used to replace the respective fragment in SHP-1 DNA. Transfections were carried out using the cytomegalovirus promotor-driven expression vector pRK5 RS, 293 human embryonal kidney cells, or COS-7 cells (German Collection of Microorganisms and Cell Cultures, DSM ACC 60) by a Ca2+ precipitation method, as described previously (34Lammers R. Bossenmaier B. Cool D.E. Tonks N.K. Schlessinger J. Fischer E.H. Ullrich A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22456-22462Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). 293 cells were transiently transfected with the various PTP constructs. Cell lysates were obtained in the absence of PTP inhibitors and directly assayed for PTP activity using [32P]Raytide as a substrate as described previously (5Tomic S. Greiser U. Lammers R.

The amount of lysate protein was titrated in each assay to fall into the linear range of the method. Data from different assay series were normalized by computing the ratio from the activity in lysates of PTP expression plasmid-transfected cells and the activity in the lysate of cells mock-transfected in parallel. Anti-SHP-1 CT was obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA; catalogue no. sc-287). Anti-SHP-1 SH2 polyclonal rabbit antiserum was described by D'Ambrosio et al. (28D'Ambrosio D. Hippen K.L. Minskoff S.A. Mellman I. Pani G. Siminovitch K.A. Cambier J.C. Science. 1995; 268: 293-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar) and kindly provided by Dr. J. C. Cambier (Denver, CO). Monoclonal anti-SHP-2 SH2 and polyclonal anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies were from Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY; catalogue nos. P17420 and P11230, respectively). The EGF receptor was detected with a polyclonal anti-EGF receptor antibody from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (catalogue no. sc-03) or in some experiments with a monoclonal antibody from Transduction Laboratories (catalogue no. E12020). For association assays, the monoclonal anti-EGF receptor antibody mab425, which is directed against the extracelullar domain of the receptor, was used. The latter antibody was kindly provided by Dr. A. Luckenbach (Merck, Darmstadt). Mab425 anti-EGF receptor antibodies were covalently coupled to protein A-Sepharose beads (Pharmacia, Uppsala). For this, 1 mg antibody was incubated with 0.6 ml of phosphate-buffered saline-washed protein A-Sepharose for 1 h at 4Â°C with end-over-end rotation. The beads were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline and twice with 0.1 M sodium borate, pH 9.0 (borate buffer), and the volume was adjusted to 1.2 ml with borate buffer. Dimethyl pimelimidate (Sigma) was added to a final concentration of 20 mM, and the mixture was incubated for 30 min at room temperature. The reaction was quenched by two washes with 0.2 M ethanolamine, pH 8.0, and subsequent incubation in this solution overnight at 4Â°C. The beads were sequentially washed with 50 mM glycine, pH 3.0, 1 M Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, and twice with phosphate-buffered saline. The association assays were carried out using these beads (âmab425 beadsâ) as described previously (5Tomic S. Greiser U. Lammers R. Kharitonenkov A. Imyanitov E. Ullrich A. BÃ¶hmer F.-D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21277-21284Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). In brief, 20 Î¼l of beads (1:1 suspension) were incubated with lysates of EGF receptor overexpressing or mock transfected 293 cells in the presence or absence of ATP and kinase buffer (see the figure legends). The beads were subsequently washed and exposed to PTP inhibitor-containing lysates of 293 cells overexpressing the different PTP constructs for 1 h at 4Â°C. For the direct comparisons made in case of the SHP-1 SH2 domain mutants, the same amounts of expressed PTP were included in the incubations. Thereafter, the beads were washed, and the amount of bound PTP was evaluated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and immunoblotting. PTPs and EGF receptor were coexpressed in 293 cells as described previously (5Tomic S. Greiser U. Lammers R. Kharitonenkov A. Imyanitov E. Ullrich A. BÃ¶hmer F.-D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21277-21284Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Lysate aliquots, normalized for EGF receptor amounts, were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and immunoblotted with polyclonal anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies, to estimate the EGF receptor phosphorylation level in the absence or presence of the different PTPs. To judge the effect of PTP expression on phosphorylation of endogenous EGF receptors in COS-7 cells, EGF receptors were immunoprecipitated from PTP expression plasmid- or mock-transfected cells using mab425 anti-EGF receptor antibodies and subsequently analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies. To test the requirement of the SH2 domains of SHP-1 for its previously demonstrated association with the EGF receptor, Arg to Lys (RK) point mutants or amino-terminal truncation mutants of SHP-1 were generated as depicted in Fig. 1. Identical RK mutations have been shown before (20Sugimoto S. Wandless T.J. Shoelson S.E. Neel B.G. Walsh C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13614-13622Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 35Pei D.H. Wang J. Walsh C.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 1141-1145Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar) to severely impair the functionality of the concerned SH2 domains. The mutated SHP-1 molecules were expressed in 293 cells and analyzed for their association with immobilized, autophosphorylated EGF receptor. As shown in Fig. 2 (lane 4 versus lane 2), mutation of the N-terminal SH2 domain (SHP-1 R32K) strongly reduced the amount of EGF receptor-bound SHP-1, however, some association was still detectable. Very similarly, truncation of the N-terminal SH2 domain reduced but not abolished the association (Fig. 2, lane 10). The corresponding inactivating mutation of the C-terminal SH2 domain (SHP-1 R138K) reduced the amount of associated SHP-1 weakly but reproducibly (Fig. 2, lane 6). In four experiments the signal of associated SHP-1 R138K was 73 Â± 4% compared to native SHP-1 (100%) as revealed by densitometric analysis. The double point mutant SHP-1 R32K,R138K or SHP-1 lacking both SH2 domains (SHP-1Î SH2) were completely unable to associate with the EGF receptor (Fig. 2, lanes 8 and 12). Taken together, the data suggest that both SH2 domains are important for the association of SHP-1 with the EGF receptor; however, the C-terminal SH2 domain contributes to a lesser extent to the association than the N-terminal SH2 domain. All SH2 domain mutants of SHP-1 exhibited catalytic activity. Lysates of 293 cells overexpressing SHP-1 or the various mutants displayed 1.4-2.2-fold PTP activity compared with mock-transfected cells when assayed toward the synthetic peptide substrate [32P]Raytide (not shown). To analyze the effect of SH2 domain mutations on the functional interaction of SHP-1 with the EGF receptor, the various SHP-1 mutants were coexpressed with the EGF receptor in 293 cells. Subsequently, the cells were stimulated with EGF, and the autophosphorylation level of the EGF receptor coexpressed with the PTP mutants was compared to that of cells expressing EGF receptor in the absence of PTP or in the presence of SHP-1. As shown in Fig. 3A (lane 3 versus lane 2) and demonstrated before (4Vogel W. Lammers R. Huang J. Ullrich A. Science. 1993; 259: 1611-1614Crossref PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar, 5Tomic S.

Cyclins and cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) 1The abbreviations used are: CDKcyclin-dependent kinaseCAKCDK-activating kinaseGSHglutathioneGSTglutathione S-transferasePAStaphylococcus aureus protein APAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresisPCRpolymerase chain reaction. are key regulators of the eukaryotic cell cycle (1Murray A.

Cell. 1994; 79: 563-571Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (683) Google Scholar). Cdk2 is associated with A- and E-type cyclins, and the respective complexes are believed to control the S phase and G1-S transition, respectively (3Sherr C.J.

The activity of CDKs is tightly regulated by an intricate system of protein-protein interaction and phosphorylation (5Morgan D.O. Nature. 1995; 374: 131-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (2916) Google Scholar). The activation of CDKs, by definition, requires the association with cyclin partners. Full activation of CDKs requires in addition the phosphorylation of Thr-161/Thr-160, which lies in the activating T-loop in the crystal structure of Cdk2 (6Russo A.A. Jeffrey P.D. Pavletich N.P. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 696-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar, 7De Bondt H.L. Rosenblatt J. Jancarik J. Jones H.D. Morgan D.O. Kim S.-H.

The Thr-161/Thr-160 residue is phosphorylated by the CDK-activating kinase (CAK), which is composed of a cyclin H-Cdk7 complex and a RING finger protein subunit MAT1 (8Poon R.Y.C. Hunter T. Curr. Biol. 1995; 5: 1243-1247Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The activity of CDKs can be inhibited by phosphorylation of Thr-14 and Tyr-15 by the Wee1 and Myt1 protein kinases (9Mueller P.R. Coleman T.R. Kumagai A. Dunphy W.G. Science. 1995; 270: 86-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar). Furthermore, CDKs can be inactivated by binding to CDK inhibitors like those from the p21cip1/WAF1 family (p21cip1/WAF1, p27kip1, and p57kip2) and the p16INK4A family (p16INK4A, p15INK4B, p18INK4C, p19INK4D) (10Sherr C.J. Roberts J.M. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1149-1163Crossref PubMed Scopus (3200) Google Scholar). It has become clear that not all cyclins and CDKs function in cell cycle control. Examples of cyclins and CDKs that function in non-cell cycle regulating events are mounting; for instance, cyclin HÂ·;Cdk7 and cyclin CÂ·;Cdk8 in the TFIIH subunit of the RNA polymerase II holoenzyme have possible roles in phosphorylating the C-terminal domain of RNA polymerase II (8Poon R.Y.C.

Dudek H. Kwon Y.T. Ramos Y.F.M. Tsai L.-H. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 816-825Crossref PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar). A fundamental role for p35Â·;Cdk5 is supported by the findings that targeted disruption of the p35 gene in the mouse leads to severe defects in laminar organization of neurons in the neocortex and cerebellum, 2L.-H. Tsai, personal communication. and targeted disruption of Cdk5 gene leads to abnormal corticogenesis, lesions in the central nervous system, and perinatal death (29Ohshima T. Ward J.M. Huh C.-G. Longenecker G. Veeranna Pant H.C. Brady R.O. Martin L.J. Kulkarni A.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 11173-11178Crossref PubMed Scopus (798) Google Scholar). Although p35 shares little sequence similarity to cyclin, computer modeling predicts that p35 may fold into cyclin-like tertiary structure and activate Cdk5 in a manner similar to a cyclin (30Brown N.R.

This is reminiscent of the two repeating cyclin folds found in cyclin A, which lack sequence homology but nevertheless have an identical structure (31Jeffrey P. Russo A.A. Polyak K. Gibbs E. Hurwitz J. MassaguÃ© J. Pavletich N.P. Nature. 1995; 376: 313-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (1203) Google Scholar). Even though p35 may adopt a cyclin-like structure and can activate Cdk5, the regulation of p35Â·;Cdk5 appears to be very much distinct from other cyclinÂ·;CDK complexes. Activation of typical cyclinÂ·;CDK complexes requires phosphorylation of Thr-161 or equivalent residues, but p35Â·;Cdk5 is active as a histone H1 kinase in the absence of phosphorylation by other protein kinases (32Qi Z. Huang Q.-Q. Lee K.-Y. Lew J. Wang J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10847-10854Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), despite the fact that the surrounding sequences of Ser-159 in Cdk5 (the Thr-161-equivalent residue) are similar to other CDKs. Moreover, no autophosphorylation of Cdk5 was observed under those conditions (32Qi Z. Huang Q.-Q. Lee K.-Y. Lew J. Wang J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10847-10854Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Unlike most other cyclinÂ·;CDK complexes, p35Â·;Cdk5 is not inhibited by the p21cip1/WAF1 (33Harper J.W. Elledge S.J. Keyomarsi K. Dynlacht B. Tsai L.-H. Zhang P. Dobrowolski S. Bai C.

There is some evidence, however, that a population of p35Â·;Cdk5 exists as an inactive form within a macromolecular structure, suggesting p35Â·;Cdk5 may bind to inhibitors in the brain (35Lee K.-Y. Rosales J.L. Tang D. Wang J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1538-1543Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Here we investigated the mechanism of activation of Cdk5 in vitro. We have defined distinct regions in p35 required either for binding to Cdk5 or activation of Cdk5. Residues â¼150-200 of p35 were sufficient for binding to Cdk5 in vitro, but residues â¼279-291 were in addition critical for activation of Cdk5. The regulation of p35Â·;Cdk5 is likely to be very different from that of other cyclinÂ·;CDK pairs, because unlike cyclin AÂ·;Cdk2, p35Â·;Cdk5 was not activated by CAK or inhibited by Wee1 under the same conditions.

Expression of GST- and histidine-tagged proteins in bacteria and purification with GSH-agarose and Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose chromatography respectively were as described (41Poon R.Y.C. Toyoshima H. Hunter T. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 1197-1213Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). Transcription of mRNA in vitro (42Nielsen D.A. Shapiro D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1986; 14: 5936Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) and translation in reticulocyte lysate in the presence of [35S]methionine (43Jackson R.J. Hunt T. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 96: 50-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar) was as described. In some experiments, reticulocyte lysate was supplemented with 1/10 volume of Xenopus egg extract as described (38Kobayashi H. Steward E. Poon R. Adamczewski J.P. Gannon J. Hunt T. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1992; 3: 1279-1294Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). GST-p25 or mutants (1 Î¼g) were incubated with reticulocyte lysate programmed with CDK mRNAs (5 Î¼l) at 23Â°C for 30 min. GST-p25 was then recovered with 15 Î¼l of GSH-agarose in 250 Î¼l of bead buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 5 mM NaF, 250 mM NaCl, 5 mM EDTA, 5 mM EGTA, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 2 Î¼g/ml aprotinin, 15 Î¼g/ml benzamidine, 1 Î¼g/ml leupeptin, 10 Î¼g/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor). After incubation at 4Â°C with end-to-end rotation for 45 min, the beads were washed three times with 250 Î¼l of bead buffer, transferred to new tubes, and washed twice more with bead buffer. The samples were then dissolved in 30 Î¼l of SDS-sample buffer, and the bound CDKs were detected by SDS-PAGE followed by PhosphorImager analysis (Molecular Dynamics). Purified proteins (1-3 Î¼l) or immunoprecipitates equilibrated with kinase buffer (80 mM Na-Î²-glycerophosphate, pH 7.4, 20 mM EGTA, 15 mM Mg(OAc)2, and 1 mM dithiothreitol) were mixed with 10 Î¼l of kinase buffer containing 50 Î¼M ATP, 1.25 Î¼Ci of [Î³-32P]ATP, and 1 Î¼g of histone H1. The samples were incubated at 23Â°C for 30 min, and the reactions were terminated by addition of 30 Î¼l of SDS-sample buffer. The samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE, and phosphorylation was detected with a PhosphorImager. Anti-mouse Cdk7 (CAK) antibody and immunoprecipitation of CAK from Swiss 3T3 cells were as described (44Poon R.Y.C. Yamashita K. Howell M. Ershler M.A. Belyavsky A. Hunt T. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 2789-2799PubMed Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting were performed as described (45Poon R.Y.C. Jiang W. Toyoshima H. Hunter T. J. Biol.

To identify the regions in p35 that are important for the activation of Cdk5, we constructed truncation mutants of p35 and tested their ability to bind and activate Cdk5 in vitro. Full-length p35 contains 307 amino acids and the originally identified 25-kDa proteolytic fragment of p35 contains residues 99-307. The 25-kDa proteolytic fragment is active in vivo (15Lew J.

Chem. 1995; 270: 10847-10854Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). A GST-fusion protein containing residues 109-291 (designated as GST-p25 here) is also active as a Cdk5 activator (32Qi Z. Huang Q.-Q. Lee K.-Y. Lew J. Wang J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10847-10854Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). We sought to define the minimum region of GST-p25 that is required for Cdk5 binding and activation. GST-p25 and deletion mutants derived from it were expressed in bacteria and purified by GSH-agarose chromatography. We then tested their binding to human Cdk5 and to other CDKs and CDK-related proteins (Cdc2, Cdk2, Cdk3, Cdk4, Cdk5, Cdk6, Cdk7, and PCTAIRE1, a CDK-related protein) synthesized in a mRNA-dependent rabbit reticulocyte lysate in the presence of [35S]methionine. Only Cdk5 bound strongly to GST-p25 under our assay conditions (Fig. 1). Cdc2, Cdk2, Cdk3, Cdk7, and PCTAIRE all bound weakly to GST-p25; interaction between GST-p25 and endogenous Cdk2 was also detected when GST-p25 was added to a cell extract (data not shown). The significance of these interactions will be explored below. Using the above binding assay, we compared the affinity of Cdk5 for GST-p25 to various GST-fusion proteins containing C-terminal and N-terminal deletions of p35. The p35 deletion mutants and their relationship to p35/p25 are summarized schematically in Fig. 2. Deletion of p25 from the N terminus up to residue 122 (NÎ122) had little effect on its binding to Cdk5, and deletion up to residue 147 (NÎ147) only slightly impaired binding to Cdk5 (Fig. 3A). In contrast, deletion up to residue 200 (NÎ200) abolished binding to Cdk5. Similarly, deletions from the C terminus of p25 had little effect on the binding to Cdk5 up to residue 198 (CÎ198). There was a slight reduction in the affinity of CÎ179 for Cdk5. Further deletions from the C terminus resulted in greater reduction of Cdk5 binding (CÎ159) and finally a complete loss of Cdk5 binding (CÎ139).Fig. 3Binding and activation of Cdk5 to p25 and deletion mutants. A, binding of Cdk5 to p25 and mutants. Cdk5 translated in a reticulocyte lysate in the presence of [35S]methionine (5 Î¼l) was incubated with 1 Î¼l of GST-p25 (lane 1), N-terminal deletion mutants of GST-p25: NÎ122 (lane 2) NÎ147 (lane 3), NÎ200 (lane 4), or C-terminal deletion mutants of GST-p25: CÎ279 (lane 5), CÎ251 (lane 6), CÎ198 (lane 7), CÎ179 (lane 8), CÎ159 (lane 9), CÎ139 (lane 10) at 23Â°C for 30 min. The GST-p25 or mutants were then recovered with GSH-agarose as described under âExperimental Procedures.â The samples were dissolved in SDS-sample buffer, and the bound Cdk5 was detected by SDS-PAGE followed by analysis with a PhosphorImager. B, activation of Cdk5 by p25 and mutants. Bacterially expressed GST-Cdk5 (100 ng) was mixed with GST-p25 or mutants (100 ng) as in A. The histone H1 kinase activities of the reactions were assayed as described under âExperimental Procedures.âView Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) In addition to assaying binding to in vitro translated Cdk5, we also assayed whether GST-p25 and its mutants could stimulate the kinase activity of bacterially expressed GST-Cdk5 (Fig. 3B). Deletion from the N terminus of p25 resulted in a progressive reduction of histone H1 kinase activity associated with Cdk5, resembling the decrease of Cdk5 binding activity shown above. In contrast, even the smallest deletion from the C terminus we tested (CÎ279) resulted in the complete loss of histone H1 kinase activity associated with Cdk5. These results were surprising because the C-terminal deletions of p25 up to residue 159 could still bind well to Cdk5 (Fig. 3A). Similar results were obtained by using bacterially expressed p25 mutants and in vitro translated Cdk5. 4R. Y. C. Poon, J. Lew, and T. Hunter, unpublished data. The Cdk5-binding and Cdk5-activating activities of p35/p25 and deletion mutants are summarized in Fig. 2. The indicated ability of full-length p35 to bind and activate Cdk5 has not been confirmed experimentally, because GST-p35 could not be produced in soluble form under the conditions used successfully for the expression of GST-p25 or other deletion mutants. In fact, it is unclear whether p35Â·;Cdk5 complex is active as a kinase; there are indications that p25Â·;Cdk5 is active but p35Â·;Cdk5 is present in an inactive complex in the brain (35Lee K.-Y. Rosales J.L. Tang D. Wang J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1538-1543Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Taken together, these results indicate that the region of p35 that interacts with Cdk5 is residues â¼150-200 and that the C-terminal region â¼279-291 is essential for the activation of Cdk5. Deletion of either the binding domain or the activating domain of p35 was sufficient to prevent the activation of Cdk5. In principle, mutants like CÎ279, CÎ251, or CÎ198, which bind to Cdk5 but do not activate, could be used as dominant-negative suppressors of p35. To test whether such p25 C-terminal deletion mutants could act in dominant-negative fashion, GST-Cdk5 was mixed with GST-p25 and increasing amounts of CÎ251 mutant (Fig. 4). The histone H1 kinase activity associated with Cdk5 was progressively reduced in the presence of increasing amounts of CÎ251, indicating that CÎ251 could compete with GST-p25 for binding to Cdk5. Nearly complete inhibition of Cdk5 activation was observed with a 10-fold excess of CÎ251 over p25. To investigate the activation of Cdk5 by p35 further, we explored whether the weak interactions between GST-p25 and other CDKs, like Cdk2, observed in Fig. 1 were of any significance relative to that between GST-p25 and Cdk5. As previously reported, the histone H1 kinase activity of bacterially expressed GST-Cdk2 was activated weakly by just mixing with bacterially expressed cyclin A (protein A (PA)-cyclin A fusion protein); the PA-cyclin AÂ·;GST-Cdk2 complex was further activated by phosphorylation of Thr-160 by CAK (36Poon R.Y.C. Yamashita K. Adamczewski J.P. Hunt T. Shuttleworth J. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3123-3132Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar, 46Connell-Crowley L. Solomon M.J. Wei N. Harper J.W. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1993; 4: 79-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar) (Fig. 5, lanes 4 and 7). As expected, both the K33R (changing the lysine in the ATP-binding site of Cdk2 to arginine) and T160A (changing the activating Thr-160 to alanine) mutants of GST-Cdk2 were not activated by cyclin A in the presence of CAK (Fig. 5, lanes 5, 6, 8, and 9). GST-p25 was also able to activate the kinase activity of GST-Cdk2 slightly, roughly to the level of activity of cyclin AÂ·;Cdk2 in the absence of Thr-160 phosphorylation (Fig. 5, lane 10). The T160A mutant but not the K33R mutant of Cdk2 was likewise weakly activated by GST-p25 (Fig. 5, lanes 11 and 12). In contrast to the activation with cyclin A, however, no further activation of GST-p25Â·;Cdk2 was seen in the presence of CAK (Fig. 5, lanes 13-15). GST-Cdk2 can be phosphorylated by CAK even in the absence of cyclin subunit (36Poon R.Y.C. Yamashita K. Adamczewski J.P. Hunt T. Shuttleworth J. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3123-3132Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar), and phosphorylation of GST-Cdk2 by CAK was also observed in the presence of GST-p25 (data not shown); hence, the lack of further activation of GST-p25Â·;Cdk2 complex was not due to a block of CAK phosphorylation. Given the fact that the weak kinase activity of cyclin AÂ·;Cdk2 in the absence of Thr-160 phosphorylation may not have a physiological role, it seems unlikely that the weak activation of Cdk2 by p25 will be of physiological significance. Given that the activity of p25Â·;Cdk2 was not affected by the presence or absence of CAK, we next investigated whether the kinase activity of p25Â·;Cdk5 complex could be regulated by CAK. As shown before, GST-Cdk2 is activated when bound to a bacterially expressed histidine-tagged cyclin A (cyclin A-H6) and is phosphorylated on Thr-160 by CAK (Fig. 6A, lane 6); as shown above Cdk2 was not activated by GST-p25 (lane 7). In contrast, GST-Cdk5 was not activated by cyclin A but was activated by p25 irrespective whether CAK was present or not. We also constructed a GST-cyclin A-p35 fusion protein containing the first cyclin-fold of cyclin A (residues 171-303) that interacts with Cdk2 (31Jeffrey P. Russo A.A. Polyak K. Gibbs E. Hurwitz J. MassaguÃ© J. Pavletich N.P. Nature. 1995; 376: 313-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (1203) Google Scholar) and the activating domain of p35 (residues 228-291), in the hope that the fusion protein might bind to Cdk2 and activate its kinase activity in the absence of Thr-160 phosphorylation. But not too surprisingly, this cyclin A-p35 fusion construct turned out to be unable to activate either Cdk2 or Cdk5 (lanes 8 and 16). These data showed that p25Â·;Cdk5 could not be further activated by CAK under the similar conditions when"

A major step in understanding the mechanism of the p55 receptor has been the identification of the interacting protein, TRADD, which accounts for signals leading to apoptosis and increased gene expression through NF-ÎºB-mediated events (7Hsu H. Xiong J. Goeddel D.V. Cell. 1995; 81: 495-504Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1721) Google Scholar). Likewise, the p75 receptor is capable of signal transduction through the association of ring finger proteins, such as TRAF1 and TRAF2, with the cytoplasmic domain of p75 (8Rothe M. Sarma V.

The interaction of TRADD with the p55 TNF receptor has revealed the importance of protein-protein interactions via a region of homology called the âdeath domain.â This sequence has been found in a variety of transmembrane and cytosolic molecules and is usually localized at the C-terminal region of each protein. The functional significance of this domain has been demonstrated in studies with the p55 TNF receptor and the Fas antigen, which contain similar functional death domain sequences (10Chinnaiyan A.M. Tepper C.G. Seldin M.F. O'Rourke K. Kischkel F.C. Hellbardt S. Krammer P.H. Peter M.E. Dixit V.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4961-4965Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (705) Google Scholar). The binding of p55 receptors to TRADD, a cytoplasmic protein containing a death domain, and the binding of the Fas antigen to FADD, an analogous protein, have been localized to an 80-amino acid region at the C terminus of both receptors. While overexpression of TRADD or FADD in heterologous cells leads to cell death (7Hsu H. Xiong J. Goeddel D.V. Cell. 1995; 81: 495-504Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1721) Google Scholar, 11Chinnaiyan A.M. O'Rourke K. Tewari M. Dixit V.M.

Chem. 1993; 268: 10932-10937Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A link to the interleukin converting enzyme/ced-3 protease family was made recently with the identification of a cysteine protease, FLICE/MACH, which interacts with the death effector domain of FADD (13Boldin M.P. Goncharov T.M. Goltsev Y.V. Wallach D. Cell. 1996; 85: 803-815Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2096) Google Scholar, 14Muzio M. Chinnaiyan A.M. Fischkel F.C. O'Rourke K. Shevchenko A.

The connection of the Fas antigen and the p55 TNF receptor with a member of the interleukin converting enzyme protease family provides a mechanism for how cell death signals are initiated by ligand-receptor interactions. While cell death can be instigated by TNF-Î± and represents the major signaling function of the Fas antigen, TNF-Î± can participate in many other diverse activities, including the synthesis of proinflammatory mediators and cell proliferation and differentiation (15Heller R.A. Kronke M. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 5-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar), neuroprotection (16Cheng B. Christakos S. Mattson M.P. Neuron. 1994; 12: 139-153Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (595) Google Scholar), and synaptic transmission (17Tancredi V. D'Arcangelo G. Grassi F. Tarroni P. Palmieri Santoni A. Eusebi F. Neurosci. Lett. 1992; 146: 176-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). The striking interactions of the C-terminal half of the intracellular domain of the p55 receptor raise the issue of the functional significance of the juxtamembrane region of the p55 receptor. This region is â¼100 amino acids in length, is rich in proline residues, and is not required for TNF-mediated cellular cytotoxicity. Here we report the interaction of the juxtamembrane region of the p55 TNF receptor with phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate 5-kinase (PIP5K), an enzyme that produces phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2). PIP5K is a significant enzymatic activity to be linked to TNF signaling since its product, PIP2, is a critical second messenger intermediate that also has many direct modulatory effects. Moreover, this study has identified a new member of the PIP5K family, PIP5KIIÎ². The association of the p55 receptor with PIP5K indicates how diverse functions are encoded in the TNF receptor structure to generate multiple signal transduction events after ligand binding. HeLa, U373, and MCF7 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. In experiments using TNF, the cells were transferred to serum-free medium when an 80% confluency was reached. The cells were serum-starved for 12-24 h before TNF was added at a final concentration of 100 ng/ml. Cells (10-cm dish) were harvested at appropriate time intervals, washed three times in cold phosphate-buffered saline, and lysed in 500 Î¼l of cold lysis buffer (20 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 25 mMÎ²-glycerophosphate, 137 mM NaCl, 100 mM EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 2 mM sodium pyrophosphate, 100 Î¼M sodium vanadate, 0.5 mM LiCl, 1 Î¼g/ml leupeptin, 2 Î¼g/ml aprotinin, and 25 Î¼g/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). The cell debris was pelleted after a 20-min incubation on ice. The lysates were stored frozen at â70Â°C. The yeast expression vector pSD.04, containing the lexA DNA-binding domain (18Dalton S. Treisman R. Cell. 1992; 68: 597-612Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar), was used for these studies. All recombinant clones were generated by PCR using primers containing a 5â²-NotI linker and a 3â²-SpeI linker. The bait used in the primary screening protocol was Y1 (residues 204-280 of the human p55 receptor). Other regions of the human p55 receptor used were Y2 (residues 278-364), Y3 (residues 324-426), Y4 (residues 204-364), and Y5 (residues 204-426). Other constructs used the cytoplasmic domains of the Fas antigen, p75 TNF receptor, and p75 neurotrophin receptor. The primers for the baits were as follows: Y1, 5â²-primer (5â²-ATTTGCGGCCGCCATGTATCGCTACCAACGG-3â²) and 3â²-primer (5â²-CTAACTAGTTCAAGCCGCAAAGTTGGG-3â²); Y2, 5â²-primer (5â²-ATTTGCGGCCGCTTTGCGGCTCCCCGCAGA-3â²) and 3â²-primer (5â²-CTAACTAGTTCACCCGTTCTGCAGCTC-3â²); Y3, 5â²-primer (5â²-ATTTGCGGCCGCCACTGATGACCCCGCGACG-3â²) and 3â²-primer (5â²-CTAACTAGTTCATCTGAGAAGACTGGG-3â²); Y4, 5â²-primer (5â²-ATTTGCGGCCGCCATGTATCGCTACCAACGG-3â²) and 3â²-primer (5â²-CTAACTAGTTCACCCGTTCTGCAGCTC-3â²); Y5, 5â²-primer (5â²-ATTTGCGGCCGCCATGTATCGCTACCAACGG-3â²) and 3â²-primer (5â²-CTAACTAGTTCATCTGAGAAGACTGGG-3â²); Fas antigen, 5â²-primer (5â²-ATTTGCGGCCGCCCGAAAGTACCGGAAAAGA-3â²) and 3â²-primer (5â²-CTAACTAGTTCACTCCAGACATTGTCC-3â²); and p75 TNF receptor, 5â²-primer (5â²-AAATTTGCGGCCGCCATGACCCAGGTGAAAAAGAAG-3â²) and 3â²-primer (5â²-CTAACTAGTTTAACTGGGCTTCATCCCAGC-3â²). For each PCR fragment, the reaction mixture (100 Î¼l) contained the primers at 1 ng/Î¼l; the DNA template at 0.1 ng/Î¼l; 200 nM each dATP, dCTP, dGTP, and dTTP; 1 Ã Pfu buffer; and 1.25 units of cloned Pfu polymerase (Stratagene). The PCR conditions for Y1, Y2, and Y3 were as follows: 1 cycle at 85Â°C for 8 min followed by 5 cycles at 94Â°C for 2 min, annealing temperature of 30Â°C for 1.5 min, and extension temperature of 72Â°C for 1 min and 25 cycles at 94Â°C for 2 min, 60Â°C for 1.5 min, and 72Â°C for 1 min. This was followed by a final cycle of 72Â°C for 4 min. For the Fas antigen, the PCR conditions were similar, except the annealing temperature was 50Â°C. For the p75 TNF receptor, the annealing temperature was 55Â°C. The DNA templates were pCMVp55 and pCMVp75 (19Hsu K. Chao M.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16430-16436Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and pCMVmFas (20Orlinick J.R. Chao M.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8627-8632Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). These conditions yielded PCR fragments of the expected sizes. The PCR fragments were phenol/chloroform-extracted, ethanol-precipitated, and digested with NotI and SpeI before ligation in the lexA DNA-binding yeast expression vector. Transformants were screened by restriction digestion and verified by DNA sequencing. Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain S260, which contains a lexA operator-lacZ reporter gene, was maintained as described (18Dalton S. Treisman R. Cell. 1992; 68: 597-612Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar). The baits were transformed into S. cerevisiae (21Kurschner C. Morgan J.I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 246-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), and the transformants were selected and maintained on Trpâ plates and Trpâ medium. Log phase cells (1010) were cotransformed with 150 Î¼g of murine cerebellar library DNA constructed in the VP16 activation domain according to published procedures (21Kurschner C. Morgan J.I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 246-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The cotransformants were plated on Amersham Hybond-N filters laid on UraâTrpâ plates containing 2% glucose. After incubation at 30Â°C for 48 h, the filters were transferred to similar plates containing 2% galactose and further incubated for 24 h to induce expression of the VP16-cDNA fusion proteins encoded by the library plasmids. Interacting proteins were detected by a qualitative colony Î²-galactosidase activity assay as described (18Dalton S. Treisman R. Cell. 1992; 68: 597-612Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar). Colonies positive for Î²-galactosidase were streaked on UraâTrpâ plates. The yeast plasmids were rescued by transforming into Escherichia coli and were subjected to DNA sequencing analysis (Sequenase). The cytoplasmic (residues 204-426), juxtamembrane (residues 204-337), and death domain (residues 340-426) regions of human p55 were amplified using PCR. The primers used were as follows: for the cytoplasmic domain, 5â²-primer (5â²-AAAGGATCCATGTATCGCTAC-3â²) and 3â²-primer (5â²-GAGTCGACCTCTGAGAAGACT-3â²); for the juxtamembrane region, 5â²-primer (5â²-AAAGGATCCTGTATCGCTAC-3â²) and 3â²-primer (5â²-GAGTCGACCTCACACGTTCTC-3â²); and for for the death domain, 5â²-primer (5â²-AAAGGATCCTTGCGCTGGAAG-3â²) and 3â²-primer (5â²-GAGTCGACCTCTGAGAAGACT-3â²). A BamHI linker was incorporated into the 5â²-primers, and a SalI linker was incorporated into the 3â²-primers. PCRs were carried as described above using 30 cycles with a melting temperature of 94Â°C for 2 min, an annealing temperature of 48Â°C for 1 min, and an extension temperature of 72Â°C for 2 min. The PCR fragments were digested with BamHI and SalI and ligated into pGSTag (22Ron D. Dressler H. BioTechniques. 1992; 13: 866-869PubMed Google Scholar). Large-scale GST fusion proteins expressed from the various constructs were purified according to published procedures (23Darnay B.G. Reddy S.A.G. Aggarwal B.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20299-20304Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For making GST and MBP fusion proteins of clone 11 (c11), the yeast library plasmid corresponding to c11 was used as a template to amplify the library insert. In both cases, the 5â²-primer (5â²-AAAGGATCCGGTGGGGAATTCCCA-3â²) and the 3â²-primer (5â²-TATCTAGACTAGTCTAATCGATCTCGAGCCA-3â²) had a BamHI linker incorporated in the 5â²-primer. The fragment was PCR-amplified as described above using the conditions described for the p75 TNF receptor. The fragment was digested with BamHI and XbaI and ligated separately into pGSTag and pMAL-c2 (New England Biolabs Inc.). The positive clones were tested for their ability to yield fusion proteins of the expected sizes after isopropyl-1-thio-Î²-D-galactopyranoside induction (0.5 mM). The GST fusion protein was purified as described (23Darnay B.G. Reddy S.A.G. Aggarwal B.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20299-20304Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the MBP fusion protein was purified using the protocol provided by New England Biolabs Inc. The GST-c11 and MBP-c11 fusion proteins were denatured in SDS and used as immunogens to generate polyclonal antibodies (Pocono Farms). In a data base search, the PIP5KIIÎ± sequence (GenBankâ¢/EMBL accession number U14957) matched the HFBEP52 (GenBankâ¢/EMBL accession number T07883) expressed sequence tag from the human infant brain cDNA library with 70.5% identity. This 2.7-kb clone was obtained and sequenced (Sequenase Version 2.0, U. S. Biochemical Corp.). A 2.0-kb EcoRI fragment corresponding largely to the 3â²-untranslated region of this clone was used to screen 8 Ã 105 plaques from a human fetal brain Î»DR2 cDNA library (CLONTECH). The plaques were transferred to nitrocellulose filters and hybridized with the probe at 42Â°C in 5 Ã SSPE, 5 Ã Denhardt's solution, 50% formamide, 0.1% SDS, and 100 Î¼g/ml salmon sperm DNA. These filters were washed at high stringency (65Â°C, 0.01 Ã SSC and 0.01% SDS) for 20 min. Eleven positive clones were obtained, plaque-purified, and converted to their respective phagemids. Upon sequencing, two clones were found to extend the sequence of HFBEP52 in both the 5â²- and 3â²-directions. Additional sequencing of the 5â²-region was done on an Applied Biosystems Model 373 sequencer at the University of Wisconsin Biotechnology Center. This revealed a putative start site within the context of a Kozak consensus sequence (24Kozak M. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 887-903Crossref PubMed Scopus (1445) Google Scholar) that was preceded by upstream stop codons in all three reading frames. This evidence demonstrated that a full-length open reading frame for PIP5KIIÎ² had been obtained. A human multiple tissue Northern blot (CLONTECH) was probed with a 1.7-kb KpnI fragment of HFBEP52, which lies entirely within the 3â²-untranslated region of PIP5KIIÎ². The DNA fragment was gel-purified following restriction enzyme digestion and labeled by random priming with [Î±-32P]ATP and Klenow DNA polymerase. Hybridization and washing were performed as outlined by the manufacturer, and the membrane was exposed to film overnight. The 1.2-kb open reading frame of PIP5KIIÎ² was amplified by PCR (30 cycles at 94Â°C for 1 min, 55Â°C for 1 min, and 72Â°C for 3 min followed by an extension temperature of 72Â°C for 10 min) using native Pfu polymerase (Stratagene) and the following primers: 5â²-GCCGCCGCCATGTCGTCC-3â² (forward) and 5â²-GCTGAAGGTAAACTACG-3â² (reverse). The forward primer was designed to anneal over the start codon (in boldface) and to introduce a BamHI site (underlined) just upstream of the start site, while the reverse primer was designed to anneal over the stop codon (in boldface) and to introduce a XhoI site (underlined) just downstream of the termination codon. These PCR products were sucloned into the BamHI and XhoI sites of pBluescript SK(â) (Stratagene). The entire insert was sequenced to confirm that no errors had been introduced by PCR. The BamHI/XhoI fragment was then subcloned into pET28b (Novagen) for the purpose of expressing a hexahistidine fusion version of PIP5KIIÎ² (His-PIP5KIIÎ²). E. coli strain BL21(Î»DE3) was transformed with either pET28b containing the PIP5KIIÎ² open reading frame or just pET28b. For the initial expression, these strains were grown at 37Â°C to A600 = 0.6, induced with 1 mM isopropyl-1-thio-Î²-D-galactopyranoside, and incubated at 37Â°C for an additional 3 h. The cells were pelleted and resuspended in 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and 2 mM EDTA. Next, 4000 units of Ready-lyse solution (Epicentre Technologies Corp.) was added to the resuspended cells, and Triton X-100 was added to a final concentration of 0.1%. After incubating the cells at 30Â°C for 15 min, they were sonicated at 70 watts twice for 10 s. These lysates were centrifuged at 12,000 Ã g for 15 min at 4Â°C, and the supernatant was decanted. The pellet was dissolved in 1 Ã SDS-PAGE sample buffer, while an aliquot of the supernatant was mixed with an equal volume of 2 Ã sample buffer. All samples were boiled for 10 min and analyzed by SDS-PAGE in the presence of 250 mMÎ²-mercaptoethanol. His-PIP5KIIÎ² was purified by Ni2+ chelate chromatography. The strain containing the His-PIP5KIIÎ² open reading frame was grown at 30Â°C to A600 = 0.6, induced with 1 mM isopropyl-1-thio-Î²-D-galactopyranoside, and incubated at 30Â°C for an additional 3 h. The cells were centrifuged and resuspended in 8 ml of 1 Ã binding buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 500 mM NaCl, and 5 mM imidazole). After sonication with three 20-s pulses at 70 watts, the extract was centrifuged at â¼39,000 Ã g for 20 min at 4Â°C and passed through a 0.45-Î¼m syringe filter. An aliquot of this extract was set aside, and the rest was purified on a 2.5-ml gravity-packed column of His-Bind resin (Novagen). Bound proteins were eluted in three 5-ml fractions. Each of these fractions was dialyzed overnight at 4Â°C against 2.0 liters of phosphate-buffered saline. The supernatants of the crude fraction of His-PIP5KIIÎ² and of partially purified His-PIP5KIIÎ² were assayed for phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate 5-kinase activity as described previously (25Boronenkov I.V. Anderson R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2881-2884Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar) with some modifications. Kinase activity was assayed in 50-Î¼l reactions done for 20 min at room temperature in a final concentration of 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 0.5 mM EGTA, 10 mM MgCl2, 160 Î¼M phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate (Sigma), 50 Î¼M ATP, and 10 Î¼Ci of [Î³-32P]ATP. The lipids were extracted, and the labeled products were separated by thin layer chromatography and detected by autoradiography. Western BlottingâProteins were transferred to nitrocellulose (Micron Separations, Inc.) following SDS-PAGE. Antibodies were incubated with the membrane for 1 h at room temperature following blocking with 5% powdered milk in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.2% Tween 20. The primary antibody was raised against the MBP-c11 fusion protein and was detected by chemiluminescence using a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) and LumiGLO substrates (Kierkegaard and Perry Laboratories, Inc.). GST fusion proteins containing the cytoplasmic, the juxtamembrane, or the death domain of the p55 fusion protein were purified on glutathione-Sepharose beads, and 100 Î¼l of the fusion protein on the glutathione beads was incubated with 3 Î¼g of purified MBP-c11. The reaction volume was brought up to 500 Î¼l with 50 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 200 mM NaCl, 20 mM EDTA, and 0.1% Nonidet P-40. After incubation at 4Â°C for 1 h, the slurry was washed three times with the same buffer. The slurry was then boiled in SDS-PAGE buffer, and the samples were loaded on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and electrophoresed at 100 V until the dye front reached the bottom of the gel. The gel was then transferred to an Immobilon-P transfer membrane (Millipore Corp.), and immunoblotting was carried out using chemiluminescence. The primary antibody was the rabbit anti-MBP antibody (New England Biolabs Inc.) used at a 1:1000 dilution. The secondary antibody was a peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Sigma) used at a 1:15,000 dilution. Cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. Near confluency, the cells were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline, scraped, and centrifuged. The cells were lysed in 500 Î¼l of radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (50 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM EDTA, 1% Triton, and 0.4% SDS) supplemented with protease inhibitors. Lysates were incubated on ice for 30 min; the cell debris was removed by centrifugation; and an aliquot of the lysate was used to determine protein concentration using the Bio-Rad reagent. Lysates (4 mg) were subjected to immunoprecipitation in a final volume of 500 Î¼l of radioimmune precipitation assay buffer. Antibodies against PIP5K (protein A-purified) that were coupled to Affi-Gel-10 beads (Bio-Rad) were added to the lysate, and the mixture was incubated at 4Â°C for 1 h. In separate reactions, lysates were incubated either with 100 Î¼l of protein A-purified anti-p55 antibodies (Genzyme Corp.) coupled to Affi-Gel-10 beads or with nonspecific goat serum. The immunoprecipitate was washed three times in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer and boiled for 30 s in SDS-PAGE buffer. The sample was subjected to electrophoresis on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Chemiluminescence was carried out using the ECL procedure (Amersham Corp.). The p55 TNF receptor is a transmembrane protein with four extracellular cysteine-rich repeats and an intracellular domain of 222 amino acids. While the sequences responsible for mediating cytotoxicity (6Tartaglia L.A. Ayres T.M. Wong G.H.W. Goeddel D.V. Cell. 1993; 74: 845-853Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1159) Google Scholar) and aggregation of the p55 receptor (26Song H.Y. Dunbar J.D. Donner D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22492-22495Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) have been localized to the death domain in the C-terminal half of the cytoplasmic tail, the functional significance of the juxtamembrane region has not been fully defined. To identify cellular proteins that bound specifically to the juxtamembrane domain of the p55 TNF receptor, a recombinant LexA fusion protein was generated that contained amino acids 204-280 (Y1), beginning at the end of the transmembrane domain and extending to the middle of the cytoplasmic domain. Y1 did not contain sequences representing the death domain of p55. The Y1 domain was then used as the bait in the yeast two-hybrid screen. A mouse cerebellar cDNA library was used to screen for proteins that interacted specifically with the Y1 region. The library was engineered in a yeast expression vector containing VP16 as the activation domain (18Dalton S. Treisman R. Cell. 1992; 68: 597-612Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar). Colonies were obtained following cotransformation of the S260 yeast strain with the Y1-LexA construct, and the cDNA library colonies were analyzed by Î²-galactosidase activity measurements. Of 1.5 Ã 107 cotransformants, 20 cDNAs were found to be positive using Î²-galactosidase activity as a measure of the activation of the Y1-LexA construct. After tests for specificity and DNA sequence analysis were conducted, one positive clone of 0.7 kb in size (c11) was pursued for further analysis. The yeast two-hybrid assay was further used to test the specificity of the interaction. For this purpose, four other LexA fusion proteins containing different regions of p55 were generated. These proteins are schematically represented in Fig. 1. Each construct (called Y2, Y3, Y4, and Y5) encoded different segments of the intracellular domain of p55, including the juxtamembrane region, the C-terminal death domain (Y3), or both regions (Y4, Y5). The interaction of c11 with the p55 receptor was found to be confined to sequences representing the juxtamembrane region. Cotransformation of yeast strain S260 with each of these constructs and the plasmid harboring c11 rescued from the initial screening indicates that p55 constructs containing the death domain (Y3) or LexA alone did not yield any Î²-galactosidase activity, whereas other constructs containing p55 juxtamembrane sequences (Y1, Y4, and Y5) gave positive Î²-galactosidase activity (Fig. 1). This analysis was also extended to the cytoplasmic regions of the p75 TNF receptor, the Fas antigen, and the p75 neurotrophin receptor. No interactions were detected between c11 and LexA constructs containing these receptor sequences (Fig. 1). In support of this observation is the fact that there is little similarity in sequence between these family members in the juxtamembrane region. Therefore, the yeast two-hybrid results indicate that the protein expressed from the c11 cDNA specifically associates with the juxtamembrane domain of the p55 TNF receptor. Sequence analysis revealed that the mouse c11 cDNA clone encoded a protein that was highly homologous to human PIP5KII cloned previously (25Boronenkov I.V. Anderson R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2881-2884Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). The c11 cDNA sequence showed 77% (protein level: 83%) identity to the published sequence of PIP5K cloned from a human placental cDNA library (Fig. 2B). The PIP5K enzymes have been defined as types I and II on the basis of their elution from a phosphocellulose ion exchange column.

https://openalex.org/W2072982978,"Site-directed mutagenesis has been used to identify residues that ligate Ca2- and sugar to the fourth C-type carbohydrate-recognition domain (CRD) of the macrophage mannose receptor. CRD-4 is the only one of the eight CRDs of the mannose receptor to exhibit detectable monosaccharide binding when expressed in isolation, and it is central to ligand binding by the receptor. CRD-4 requires two Ca2- for sugar binding, like the CRD of rat serum mannose-binding protein (MBP-A). Sequence comparisons between the two CRDs suggest that the binding site for one Ca2-, which ligates directly to the bound sugar in MBP-A, is conserved in CRD-4 but that the auxiliary Ca2- binding site is not. Mutation of the four residues at positions in CRD-4 equivalent to the auxiliary Ca2- binding site in MBP-A indicates that only one, Asn728, is involved in ligation of Ca2-. Alanine-scanning mutagenesis was used to identify two other asparagine residues and one glutamic acid residue that are probably involved in ligation of the auxiliary Ca2- to CRD-4. Sequence comparisons with other C-type CRDs suggest that the proposed binding site for the auxiliary Ca2- in CRD-4 of the mannose receptor is unique. Evidence that the conserved Ca2- in CRD-4 bridges between the protein and bound sugar in a manner analogous to MBP-A was obtained by mutation of one of the amino acid side chains at this site. Ring current shifts seen in the 1H NMR spectra of methyl glycosides of mannose, GlcNAc, and fucose in the presence of CRD-4 and site-directed mutagenesis indicate that a stacking interaction with Tyr729 is also involved in binding of sugars to CRD-4. This interaction contributes about 25% of the total free energy of binding to mannose. C-5 and C-6 of mannose interact with Tyr729, whereas C-2 of GlcNAc is closest to this residue, indicating that these two sugars bind to CRD-4 in opposite orientations. Sequence comparisons with other mannose/GlcNAc-specific C-type CRDs suggest that use of a stacking interaction in the binding of these sugars is probably unique to CRD-4 of the mannose receptor.

Many proteins of both plants and animals are involved in recognition of complex carbohydrates attached to proteins or lipids (1Drickamer K. Taylor M.E. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1993; 9: 237-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (710) Google Scholar, 2Weis W.I. Drickamer K. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 441-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (1006) Google Scholar). One such protein, the macrophage mannose receptor, binds terminal mannose, fucose, or N-acetylglucosamine residues of glycoconjugates in a Ca2--dependent manner. The receptor acts as a molecular scavenger by clearing endogenous glycoproteins bearing high mannose oligosaccharides as well as pathogenic microorganisms (1Drickamer K. Taylor M.E. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1993; 9: 237-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (710) Google Scholar). The extracellular region of the mannose receptor contains an N-terminal cysteine-rich domain and a fibronectin type II repeat as well as eight C-type carbohydrate-recognition domains (CRDs), 1The abbreviations used are: CRDcarbohydrate-recognition domainMBPmannose-binding proteinMBP-Aserum mannose-binding proteinMBP-Cliver mannose-binding proteinBSAbovine serum albumin. which make it a member of the C-type lectin family (3Taylor M.E.

The C-type lectin family is a large and diverse group of proteins characterized by homologous CRDs that generally mediate Ca2--dependent sugar recognition (4Drickamer K. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1993; 3: 393-400Crossref Scopus (211) Google Scholar). Well characterized members of the C-type lectin family include the mammalian mannose-binding proteins (MBPs), the hepatic asialoglycoprotein receptor, and the selectins (1Drickamer K. Taylor M.E. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1993; 9: 237-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (710) Google Scholar, 2Weis W.I. Drickamer K. Annu. Rev.

Details of how different animal and plant proteins recognize carbohydrates are becoming clearer, due to the availability of crystal structures of the proteins in complex with sugar ligands (2Weis W.I. Drickamer K. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 441-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (1006) Google Scholar). Crystal structures of two C-type CRDs, those of rat serum MBP (MBP-A), and rat liver MBP (MBP-C) have been solved in complex with sugar ligands (5Weis W.I. Drickamer K. Hendrickson W.A. Nature. 1992; 360: 127-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (852) Google Scholar, 6Ng K.K.-S. Drickamer K. Weis W.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 663-674Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). The C-type CRD of E-selectin has also been crystallized, but without bound sugar (7Graves B.J. Crowther R.L. Chandram C. Rumberger J.M. Li S. Huang K.-S. Presky D.H. Familletti P.C. Wolitzky B.A. Burns D.K. Nature. 1994; 367: 532-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar). Examination of these crystal structures, combined with other physical techniques and mutagenesis have established some of the molecular mechanisms involved in sugar recognition by C-type CRDs (2Weis W.I. Drickamer K. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 441-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (1006) Google Scholar). However, little is known about the molecular mechanisms of carbohydrate recognition by the C-type CRDs of the mannose receptor. Analysis of sugar recognition by the mannose receptor is complicated by the presence of eight different C-type CRDs in a single polypeptide. Apart from the mannose receptor, two other proteins, a phospholipase A2 receptor of muscle and an endocytic receptor called DEC-205, located on dendritic cells, have multiple CRDs in a single polypeptide (8Lambeau G. Ancian P. Barhanin J. Lazdunski M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1575-1578Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Ishizaki J. Hanasaki K. Higashino K. Kishino J. Kikuchi N. Ohara O. Arita H. J.

Nature. 1995; 375: 151-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (806) Google Scholar). These two proteins are very divergent from other groups of C-type lectins and probably do not bind carbohydrates. The CRDs of the mannose receptor are also quite divergent from the prototypes of the C-type lectin family, but most of them contain at least some of the residues shown to be important for sugar recognition. Of the eight CRDs, only CRD-4 has been shown to bind monosaccharides when expressed in isolation, although other CRDs must contribute to binding of oligosaccharides, since CRDs 4-8 must be present to achieve the affinity of the intact receptor for natural ligands (11Taylor M.E. Bezouska K. Drickamer K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1719-1726Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Taylor M.E. Drickamer K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 399-404Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Since CRD-4 is the smallest piece of the receptor that retains the ability to interact with sugars, an understanding of the molecular mechanism of sugar binding by this CRD would be a first step toward understanding how the whole receptor recognizes its natural ligands. Ligand binding studies with expressed CRD-4 have shown that the domain requires two Ca2- for sugar binding and that a ternary complex is formed between protein, sugar, and Ca2- (13Mullin N.P. Hall K.T. Taylor M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28405-28413Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Ca2- binding is pH-dependent, and a conformational change in CRD-4 due to loss of Ca2- binding at low pH probably contributes to release of glycoconjugates by the mannose receptor in endosomes (13Mullin N.P. Hall K.T. Taylor M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28405-28413Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The fact that CRD-4 requires two Ca2- for sugar binding is surprising, since sequence comparisons with other C-type CRDs suggest that it might only bind one Ca2-. The most informative comparison is with the extensively studied CRD of rat serum mannose-binding protein (MBP-A). CRD-4 and the CRD of MBP-A show very similar monosaccharide specificities. Although they share only 28% sequence identity overall, it is likely that they interact with sugars in similar ways (13Mullin N.P. Hall K.T. Taylor M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28405-28413Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the crystal structure of the CRD of MBP-A in complex with an oligosaccharide ligand, one Ca2- (designated Ca2- 2) ligates directly to the sugar, while the other (designated Ca2- 1) is thought to be necessary for the correct positioning of the loops forming the sugar binding site (5Weis W.I. Drickamer K. Hendrickson W.A. Nature. 1992; 360: 127-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (852) Google Scholar). Alignment of the sequences of CRD-4 and MBP-A shows that all of the residues ligating Ca2- 2 in MBP-A are present in CRD-4, suggesting that one of the two Ca2- bound to CRD-4 is ligated at a conserved site (Fig. 1). At this conserved Ca2- binding site in MBP-A (Fig. 1), each side-chain forms a hydrogen bond to hydroxyl group 3 or 4 of mannose, as well as ligating Ca2-, which also ligates directly to hydroxyl groups 3 and 4 of mannose (5Weis W.I. Drickamer K. Hendrickson W.A. Nature. 1992; 360: 127-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (852) Google Scholar). Thus, a ternary complex between protein, sugar, and Ca2- is formed. The same type of ternary complex is seen in the crystal structure of the CRD of rat liver mannose-binding protein (MBP-C) (6Ng K.K.-S. Drickamer K. Weis W.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 663-674Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). The conservation of these Ca2- ligands in CRD-4, combined with the fact that a ternary complex is also formed in CRD-4, suggests that the interaction of protein, Ca2-, and sugar at this site in CRD-4 is very similar to that seen in the mannose-binding proteins (13Mullin N.P. Hall K.T. Taylor M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28405-28413Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Only one of the four residues ligating the auxiliary Ca2- in MBP-A is present in CRD-4 (Fig. 1). In crystals of the CRD of MBP-C, two Ca2- are ligated at the same sites as in MBP-A (6Ng K.K.-S. Drickamer K. Weis W.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 663-674Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). In contrast, the crystal structure of the CRD of E-selectin reveals bound Ca2- only at the site corresponding to the conserved Ca2- in MBP-A, and binding studies in solution confirm that there is a single Ca2- binding site in this CRD (7Graves B.J. Crowther R.L. Chandram C. Rumberger J.M. Li S. Huang K.-S. Presky D.H. Familletti P.C. Wolitzky B.A. Burns D.K. Nature. 1994; 367: 532-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar, 14Anostario Jr., M. Huang K.-S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8138-8144Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Like CRD-4, the selectin CRD lacks the residues involved in Ca2- coordination at the auxiliary site in MBP-A. Thus, the mode of binding of the second Ca2- to CRD-4 must be different from that of many other C-type CRDs. Although it is probable that the major interaction between sugars and C-type CRDs, including CRD-4 of the mannose receptor, is via direct ligation to a conserved Ca2-, there are likely to be other contacts between the protein and sugar. In MBP-A, interaction between bound sugar and the Î²-carbon of a histidine residue, His189, contributes significantly to the overall binding energy (15Iobst S.T. Wormald M.R. Weis W.I. Dwek R.A. Drickamer K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15505-15511Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It is probable that additional contacts between CRD-4 and bound sugar will be different from those seen in MBP-A. In MBP-A, binding of the auxiliary Ca2- is responsible for correct positioning of loops around the other Ca2- to which the sugar ligates (5Weis W.I. Drickamer K. Hendrickson W.A. Nature. 1992; 360: 127-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (852) Google Scholar). If, as suggested by the sequence comparisons, the mode of ligation of the auxiliary Ca2- in CRD-4 is different from that seen in MBP-A, the position of the loops near the sugar binding site is likely to be different. In order to clarify how CRD-4 of the mannose receptor binds two Ca2- in the absence of amino acid residues corresponding to one of the sites in MBP-A, site-directed mutagenesis experiments have been undertaken to identify residues involved in ligating each of the two Ca2- to CRD-4. NMR studies designed to probe the nature of the molecular interactions between CRD-4 and monosaccharides have also been undertaken. The results suggest that one Ca2- is ligated to CRD-4 in the same way as in MBP-A but that CRD-4 has a unique binding site for the auxiliary Ca2-. In addition to direct ligation of sugar at the conserved Ca2- site, a hydrophobic stacking interaction between the bound sugar and a tyrosine residue contributes about 25% of the overall binding energy. Bovine serum albumin, N-tosylphenylethyl chloromethyl ketone-treated trypsin, monosaccharides, D2O, and deuterated buffer components were from Sigma. Deuterated imidazole was from Cambridge Isotope Laboratories. Restriction enzymes and other DNA modification enzymes were from New England Biolabs. The Sequenase II kit for DNA sequencing and Na125I were obtained from Amersham Corp. Mannose31-BSA was purchased from EY Laboratories. Volumetric CaCl2 solution was from BDH, and Immulon 96-well microtiter plates were from Dynatech. Mannose-Sepharose was prepared using the divinylsulfone method (16Fornstedt N. Porath J. FEBS Lett. 1975; 57: 187-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). Mutagenesis was performed on a fragment corresponding to bases 2000-2467 of a cDNA for the human macrophage mannose receptor (3Taylor M.E. Conary J.T. Lennartz M.R. Stahl P.D. Drickamer K. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 12156-12162Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) inserted into the vector pUC19 grown in Escherichia coli strain HB101. Synthetic oligonucleotides were inserted at appropriate restriction sites using standard recombinant DNA procedures. Modified XhoI-BamHI fragments were transferred into a CRD-4 expression plasmid derived from pINIIIompA3 (11Taylor M.E. Bezouska K. Drickamer K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1719-1726Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and transformed into E. coli strain JA221. Plasmids were sequenced to verify the mutations made. Mutant proteins were prepared using the procedure developed for wild type CRD-4 (13Mullin N.P. Hall K.T. Taylor M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28405-28413Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Growth, induction, and harvesting of transformed bacteria were exactly as described for wild type CRD-4 (13Mullin N.P. Hall K.T. Taylor M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28405-28413Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The procedure for purification of expressed mutant domains from the bacterial cell lysates was modified slightly to allow for any decrease in sugar affinity due to the mutations. Pelleted bacteria from 1 liter of culture were lysed by sonication in 50 ml of loading buffer (25 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 1.25 M NaCl, 3 mM CaCl2). The lysate was spun at 45,000 rpm for 1 h in a Beckman 55.2Ti rotor. The supernatant (50 ml) was passed over a 10-ml column of mannose-Sepharose equilibrated with loading buffer. The column was washed with 10 ml of wash buffer (25 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 1.25 M NaCl, 20 mM CaCl2), followed by a further 15 fractions (2 ml) of wash buffer. The column was eluted with 10 aliquots (2 ml) of elution buffer (25 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.8), 1.25 M NaCl, 2.5 mM EDTA). Both wash fractions and elution fractions were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and fractions containing pure domains were pooled for analysis. Under these conditions, wild type CRD-4 binds to the column and only elutes upon the addition of EDTA-containing buffer. Some mutant domains eluted from the column during the wash before the addition of EDTA. Mutant CRDs were classified into four groups with phenotypes characterized by their behavior on the mannose-Sepharose column: (a) wild type or tight binding proteins eluted only after 10-12 ml of elution buffer; (b) intermediate binding proteins started to elute after 24-30 ml of wash buffer; (c) weak binding proteins were seen in all wash fractions; and (d) nonbinding proteins were only detected in the flow-through and the first 10 ml of wash buffer. Protein for NMR experiments was further purified by reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography on a C3 column, as described previously (13Mullin N.P. Hall K.T. Taylor M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28405-28413Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Bacterial lysates containing expressed proteins were prepared as described above. Lysates were dialyzed extensively against water and freeze-dried. Dried lysates were resuspended to a concentration of 65 mg/ml in 25 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.8), 1.25 M NaCl, and either 1 or 25 mM CaCl2. Trypsin was added to give a concentration of 1 mg/ml, and reactions were incubated at 3Â°C. Reactions were stopped at various time intervals by the addition of an equal volume of 2 Ã SDS gel sample buffer containing 20 mM EDTA and 2% 2-mercaptoethanol followed by boiling at 100Â°C for 5 min. The products of the reaction were analyzed by SDS-gel electrophoresis followed by immunoblotting. Protease-resistant CRD-4 was detected by autoradiography after incubation of the blot with a rabbit polyclonal anti-mannose receptor antibody, raised against a fragment of the receptor consisting of CRDs 4-7 produced in insect cells (12Taylor M.E. Drickamer K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 399-404Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), followed by 125I-labeled protein A. The resistant material was quantified using the Macintosh Image 1.49 application. Ca2--dependence of mutant CRD-4 binding to 125I-Man-BSA was determined using a solid phase binding assay described previously for wild type CRD-4 (13Mullin N.P. Hall K.T. Taylor M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28405-28413Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Serial 1:1.5 dilutions of CaCl2 in 2 Ã blocking buffer were prepared starting at 150 mM or 50 mM. To these, 125I-Man-BSA was added to give a final ligand concentration of 0.75 Î¼g/ml. Aliquots (75 Î¼l) of these mixtures were then added to duplicate wells of CRD-4-coated plates. At least two assays were performed for each mutant protein. The resulting data were fitted to equations for both first order (Equation 1) and second order (Equation 2) processes using a nonlinear least squares fitting program (Sigmaplot, Jandel Scientific). (Eq. 1) (Eq. 2) Closeness of fit to each equation was measured by comparing the summed squared residuals. Competition assays using 125I-Man31-BSA as test ligand were performed as described previously (11Taylor M.E. Bezouska K. Drickamer K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1719-1726Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Values for Ki, corresponding to the concentration of monosaccharide that gives 50% inhibition of test ligand binding, were calculated using the nonlinear, least squares fitting program. Mean Â± S.D. values of three independent assays performed in duplicate were used to calculate Ki values relative to the Ki for mannose. NMR binding assays were performed basically as described for the CRD of MBP-A (15Iobst S.T. Wormald M.R. Weis W.I. Dwek R.A. Drickamer K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15505-15511Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), except that the protein was not exchanged into D2O. Protein was dissolved in D2O and adjusted to 25 mM deuterated imidazole-HCl, pH 7.2, 0.5 M NaCl, and 5 mM CaCl2, using concentrated stock solutions. The final volume was 0.55 ml at a protein concentration of approximately 5-10 mg/ml. Titrations were performed by adding concentrated stock solutions of sugars (0.137 M and 1.1 M) in D2O. One-dimensional 1H NMR spectra were recorded on a Varian Unity 500 MHz spectrometer at a temperature of 30Â°C. Chemical shifts were measured relative to an internal HDO standard, referenced 4.78 ppm from sodium 4,4-dimethyl-4-silapentane-1-sulfonate. Peak shifts that occurred upon the addition of sugar were analyzed using the following equation. (Eq. 3) Î´Î´ is the shift in the peak position at a given glycoside concentration relative to the peak position in the protein spectrum in the absence of sugar, Î´Î´B is the difference in peak positions between the glycoside-protein complex and the free protein, and KD is the concentration of glycoside that gives half-maximal change in chemical shift. Î´Î´B and KD were calculated using the nonlinear least squares fitting program. To confirm the proposed role of the conserved Ca2- binding site in CRD-4 (Fig. 1), site-directed mutagenesis was used to assess the role of Glu733 in sugar and Ca2- binding. If the pattern of ligation in CRD-4 is the same as in MBP-A, the side chain of Glu733 should form a coordinate bond to Ca2- and a hydrogen bond to hydroxyl 3 or 4 of mannose. Mutation of Glu733 to Gln should produce a domain that does not bind sugar, since the hydrogen bond donor for the sugar hydroxyl has been removed. However, the carbonyl oxygen of Gln can form a coordinate bond with Ca2-, so Ca2- binding should be unaffected. A similar phenotype has been seen in MBP-A when Asn187 is mutated to Asp or Glu185 is changed to Gln (5Weis W.I. Drickamer K. Hendrickson W.A. Nature. 1992; 360: 127-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (852) Google Scholar, 15Iobst S.T. Wormald M.R. Weis W.I. Dwek R.A. Drickamer K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15505-15511Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, mutation of Glu733 to Ala would perturb Ca2- binding as well as sugar binding. Mutation of Glu733 in CRD-4 to either Gln or Ala resulted in domains that do not bind to mannose-Sepharose, indicating that sugar binding activity is lost. The Ca2- binding properties of these domains were investigated using proteolysis (Fig. 2). Since the lack of sugar binding activity made it difficult to isolate the two mutant domains, protease resistance experiments were carried out on bacterial lysates containing the expressed domains. CRD-4, like MBP-A, is resistant to proteolysis in the presence of Ca2-, and two Ca2- must bind to the CRD to render it fully resistant to protease (13Mullin N.P. Hall K.T. Taylor M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28405-28413Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, a mutation affecting Ca2- binding would be expected to produce a domain that is less resistant to proteolysis. In the presence of 25 mM Ca2-, both wild type CRD-4 and the Glu733â Gln mutant are resistant to proteolysis by trypsin (Fig. 2A). However, the Glu733â Ala mutant shows susceptibility to proteolysis, with approximately 50% of the protein being digested over the time course of the experiment. In the presence of 1 mM Ca2- all of the domains show susceptibility to proteolysis, but the degree of susceptibility differs (Fig. 2B). For wild type CRD-4 and the Glu733â Gln mutant, approximately 60% of the protein is still intact after 80 min, but for the Glu733â Ala mutant the amount of CRD-4 remaining drops to below 50% in only 20 min. Since the Glu733â Gln mutant shows the same degree of resistance to proteolysis as does wild type CRD-4, at both Ca2- concentrations, this domain must still bind two Ca2-. Loss of resistance to protease in the presence of Ca2- by the Glu733â Ala mutant indicates that this domain does not bind two Ca2-. The phenotypes produced by the two mutations at position 733 suggest that the pattern of ligation at the conserved Ca2- site in CRD-4 is like that of MBP-A rather than E-selectin, in which the equivalent glutamate (Glu88) is replaced as a Ca2- ligand by a water molecule ligated to an adjacent asparagine side chain (7Graves B.J. Crowther R.L. Chandram C. Rumberger J.M. Li S. Huang K.-S. Presky D.H. Familletti P.C. Wolitzky B.A. Burns D.K. Nature. 1994; 367: 532-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar). Glu733 in CRD-4 must act as a ligand for both Ca2- and a hydroxyl group of mannose. Residues ligating Ca2- 1 in the crystal structure of MBP-A and residues at the equivalent positions in a molecular model of CRD-4 are shown in Fig. 1. Only the glutamate residue of MBP-A is absolutely conserved in CRD-4. The two tyrosine residues at this site in CRD-4 would not be predicted to be involved in Ca2- binding, because OH groups of tyrosines have not been seen to ligate Ca2- in any other Ca2--binding proteins (17Nayal M. Di Cera E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 817-821Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 18Jernigan R. Raghunathan G. Baha I. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1994; 4: 256-263Crossref Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Substitution of Asp188 of MBP-A by asparagine in CRD-4 is conservative, because the carbonyl oxygen atom of asparagine can ligate Ca2-. The auxiliary Ca2- binding site in MBP-C is identical to the site in MBP-A, except that in this case Asp188 is also replaced by asparagine (6Ng K.K.-S. Drickamer K. Weis W.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 663-674Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Thus, at the site equivalent to the Ca2- 1 binding site in MBP-A, the only residues of CRD-4 with side chains that could ligate Ca2- are Asn728 and Glu706. To identify amino acid residues involved in ligation of Ca2- at the auxiliary site in CRD-4, potential Ca2- ligands were mutated either to alanine or phenylalanine. An initial assessment of whether a mutation alters the Ca2- binding properties of the domain was made by observing the behavior of the protein on the mannose-Sepharose column used to purify the domains, as described under âExperimental Procedures.â Mutation of Glu706 to Ala or mutation of either Tyr701 or Tyr734 to Phe had no effect on the ability of CRD-4 to bind to mannose-Sepharose; each of these three mutant domains was eluted from the column only in the presence of EDTA. If, as in MBP-A, the role of Ca2- at the auxiliary site of CRD-4 is in orientation of the loops forming the sugar binding site rather than in direct ligation of sugar, mutations leading to loss of Ca2- at this site should not abolish sugar binding altogether. Loss of Ca2- from the auxiliary site would, however, be expected to decrease the affinity of the CRD for Ca2- at the conserved site, so that sugar binding would be affected at low Ca2- concentrations. Since these three mutants do not show reduced binding to mannose-Sepharose under the conditions used, it seems unlikely that these residues play a role in Ca2- binding. In order to confirm this conclusion, the Ca2- binding properties of the domains were further investigated using a solid phase binding assay that measured Ca2--dependent binding of CRD-4 to 125I-Man-BSA. By fitting the data to equations for either first or second order dependence on Ca2-, it was possible to determine whether the mutant CRDs bound one or two Ca2- and to obtain values for the apparent KCa. A mutation that eliminated the auxiliary Ca2- binding site would be predicted to change the dependence on Ca2- from second order to first order and to increase the apparent KCa. Ca2- dependence of binding to 125I-Man-BSA is shown in Fig. 3. Like wild type CRD-4 (Fig. 3A), each of these domains show second order dependence on Ca2- for binding to 125I-Man-BSA, with values for KCa almost identical to wild type (Table I). The results indicate that Glu706, Tyr701, and Tyr734 are not involved in ligation of Ca2- to CRD-4.Table ICa2"

In this report, we characterize the binding of SH2CHK to specific phosphotyrosine sites on the c-KIT protein sequence. Phosphopeptide inhibition of the in vitro interaction of SH2CHK-glutathione S-transferase fusion protein/c-KIT from SCF/KL-treated Mo7e megakaryocytic cells indicated that two sites on c-KIT were able to bind SH2CHK. These sites were the Tyr568/570 diphosphorylated sequence and the monophosphorylated Tyr721 sequence.To confirm this, we precipitated native CHK from cellular extracts using phosphorylated peptides linked to Affi-Gel 15. In addition, purified SH2CHK-glutathione S-transferase fusion protein was precipitated with the same peptide beads. All of the peptide bead-binding studies were consistent with the direct binding of SH2CHK to phosphorylated Tyr568/570 and Tyr721 sites. Binding of FYN and SHC to the diphosphorylated Tyr568/570 site was observed, while binding of Csk to this site was not observed. The SH2CHK binding to the two sites is direct and not through phosphorylated intermediates such as FYN or SHC. Site-directed mutagenesis of the full-length c-KIT cDNA followed by transient transfection indicated that only the Tyr568/570, and not the Tyr721, is able to bind SH2CHK.

The kinase is composed of 527 amino acids and has highest homology (â¼50% identity overall) with the human Csk, a kinase which is known to phosphorylate the C-terminal tyrosine of SRC family kinases. Such phosphorylation results in the inactivation of these SRC kinases (3Okada M. Nakagawa H. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 20886-20893Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 4Nada S. Okada M.

Like Csk, CHK contains SH3, SH2, and tyrosine kinase domains positioned from the N terminus to the C terminus. Both kinases lack N-terminal myristoylation sites and autophosphorylation sites.

Murine counterparts to CHK have been found by a number of investigators. These have been designated as Ntk, which is cloned from mouse fetal thymus (8Chow L.M.L. Davidson D. Fournel M. Gosselin D. Lemieux S. Lyn M.S. Kozak C.A. Matis L.A. Veillette A. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 3437-3448PubMed Google Scholar), and Ctk, which is cloned from mouse brain (9Klages S. Adam D. Class K. Fargnoli J.

The Ntk protein is reported to be of two molecular weights, 52 and 56 kilodaltons, and results from alternate transcriptional splicing, while the Ctk was reported to be of only 52 kilodaltons. It is the 56-kilodalton murine form which most closely resembles human CHK. Human CHK has also been cloned by Sakano et al. (10Sakano S. Iwama A. Inazawa J. Ariyama T. Ohno M. Suda T. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 1155-1161PubMed Google Scholar) from megakaryoblastic leukemia cells and designated HYL. Another human CHK-like form possessing a molecular weight of 57 kilodaltons (designated LSK), which is nearly identical to CHK, was identified in natural killer cells and in activated T cells (11McVicar D.W. Lal B.K. Lloyd A. Kawamura M. Chen Y.Q. Zhang X. Staples J.E. Ortaldo J.R. O'Shea J.J. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 2037-2044PubMed Google Scholar). We recently found that in CMK cells stimulated by stem cell factor/kit ligand (SCF/KL), CHK associates with tyrosine phosphorylated c-KIT through its SH2 domain (12Jhun B.H. Rivnay B. Price D. Avraham H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9661-9666Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). c-KIT functions as a growth factor receptor for myeloid and erythroid lineages and promotes the survival of primitive stem cells (13Ulich T.R. DelCastillo J. McNiece I.K. Yi E.S. Alzona C.D. Yin S. Zsebo K.M. Blood. 1991; 78: 1954-1962Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Mice with defective c-KIT (W) are anemic and deficient in hematopoietic progenitor cells (14Reith A.D. Bernstein A. Genome Anal. 1991; 3: 105-133Google Scholar). Since the SRC family kinase FYN is also known to bind to the related PDGF receptor (15Alonso G. Koegl M. Mazurenko N. Courtneidge S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9840-9848Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar), we hypothesized that the binding of CHK by c-KIT would bring CHK into proximity to the bound SRC kinases. In this report, we have characterized the binding of the SH2CHK domain to specific tyrosine phosphorylated sites on c-KIT by phosphopeptide inhibition of c-KIT/CHKSH2, by binding of SH2CHK or native CHK to phosphopeptide beads, and by site-specific mutagenesis of c-KIT cDNA. Interestingly, we also found that the SRC family kinase FYN binds to one of these sites on c-KIT through its SH2 domain. The adapter protein SHC was similarly shown to bind to this site. These findings are in agreement with previous studies on the PDGF receptor (15Alonso G. Koegl M. Mazurenko N. Courtneidge S.A. J. Biol.

Our results indicate that SH2CHK binds directly to c-KIT at the Tyr568/570 site and does not bind through intermediates such as FYN or SHC. Thus, it is likely that the biological effect of CHK in hematopoietic cells is through direct, site-specific binding to c-KIT. Tyrosine-phosphorylated and nonphosphorylated synthetic peptides were obtained from the Dana Farber Cancer Institute Molecular Biology Core Facility (Boston, MA). Peptides were analyzed for purity by high pressure liquid chromatography, mass spectroscopy, and amino acid analysis. SH2CHK-GST fusion protein was prepared as described previously (12Jhun B.H. Rivnay B. Price D. Avraham H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9661-9666Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). PI3-kinase p85Î± SH2-GST fusion protein was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Anti-GST monoclonal antibodies were produced against Schistosoma japonicum glutathione S-transferase according to the procedure of Harlow and Lane (18Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988: 139-318Google Scholar). Anti-CHK polyclonal antibody (anti-LSK), anti-SHC polyclonal antibody (C-20), and anti-FYN polyclonal antibody were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Anti-SHC monoclonal antibody S14620 and anti-p85 polyclonal antibody were purchased from Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY). Anti-c-KIT polyclonal and recombinant SCF/KL were generously provided by Dr. B. Bennett, Amgen Inc. (Thousand Oaks, CA). Interleukin-3 and GM-CSF were purchased from R & D Systems (Minneapolis, MN). All other reagents were from Sigma unless otherwise specified. Factor-dependent megakaryocytic Mo7e cells were grown in RPMI 1640 medium (Mediatech, Washington, D. C.) including 20% fetal bovine serum, 10 ng/ml interleukin-3, 10 ng/ml GM-CSF, 100 IU/ml penicillin, and 10 Î¼g/ml streptomycin. Prior to stimulation with SCF/KL, cells were starved for 15 h in RPMI 1640 medium with 1% fetal bovine serum, 100 IU/ml penicillin, and 10 Î¼g/ml streptomycin. Serum-starved Mo7e cells (2 Ã 106/ml) were stimulated with 500 ng/ml SCF/KL at 37Â°C for 2 min and centrifuged for 2 min at 2200 rpm. Cell pellets were placed on ice and solubilized in 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 137 mM NaCl, 1 mM CaCl2, 1 mM MgCl2, 10% glycerol, 1.0% Nonidet P-40, 1 mM Na3VO4, 2 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 Î¼g/ml leupeptin, and 10 Î¼g/ml aprotinin (lysis buffer). Cell lysates (40 Ã 106 cells/ml) were mixed briefly and centrifuged for 15 min at 4800 rpm. During centrifugation, SH2-GST fusion proteins (10 Î¼g/incubation) were preincubated with 0.5 ml of lysis buffer along with synthetic peptides at twice the specified concentration. Cell supernatants (0.5 ml, equivalent to 20 Ã 106 cells) were added to SH2CHK-GST fusion protein plus peptide. Lysates were rotated during incubation for 1 h at 5Â°C and then precipitated by the addition of Glutathione-Sepharose 4B (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) for 0.5 h at 5Â°C. Precipitates were washed by centrifugation and resuspension in 1 ml of lysis buffer (repeated three times). SDS sample buffer was added to washed precipitates, and the samples were run on 7.5% polyacrylamide SDS-PAGE. Proteins were transferred onto nitrocellulose filters (Bio-Rad). Transfers were blocked by 4% bovine serum albumin in 0.1% Tween 20, phosphate-buffered saline (PBST). Primary antibody incubation for 1.5 h was followed by washing in PBST. Horseradish peroxidase-linked secondary antibody incubation was in PBST for 45 min. After washing in PBST, transfers were treated with ECL chemiluminescent reagent (Amersham Corp.) and exposed to x-ray film. Mo7e cell extract supernatants prepared as described above were also immunoprecipitated by specified antibodies. Incubations of 20 Ã 106 cell equivalents with 1 Î¼g of affinity-purified antibody were for 1.5 h at 5Â°C with rotation. Protein G-Sepharose (Pierce) was added, and incubation was continued for 0.5 h. Precipitates were centrifuged and resuspended in 1 ml of lysis buffer (repeated three times). SDS sample buffer was added to precipitates, and samples were run on 10% or 7.5% polyacrylamide SDS-PAGE. Gels were transferred onto nitrocellulose and immunoblotting was conducted as in the previous section. Phosphorylated and nonphosphorylated peptides were linked to Affi-Gel 15 by adding 1 Î¼mol of peptide in 40 mM MOPS buffer, pH 7.4, to a 0.5-ml bed volume of washed beads. After reaction for 1 h at room temperature, Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, was added to a final 50 mM concentration to block unreacted sites. After incubation overnight at 5Â°C, the resin was washed with 0.5 M NaCl, 50 mM MOPS, pH 7.4, followed by 50 mM MOPS, pH 7.4, and stored at 5Â°C with 1 mM sodium azide as a preservative. In order to test for peptide linkage, we measured the A280 of the initial supernatant of the peptide-bead reaction and compared this to the A280 prior to linkage, correcting for dilution. In all cases, 80-90% of the peptide was linked to the beads. Peptide beads (15-Î¼l bead volume) were incubated with 10 Î¼g of SH2CHK in 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 137 mM NaCl, 1 mM CaCl2, 1 mM MgCl2, 10% glycerol, 1.0% Nonidet P-40, 1 mM Na3VO4, and 2 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (association buffer). Incubation was for 1.5 h at 5Â°C. The beads were centrifuged and resuspended in 1 ml of association buffer (repeated three times). SDS sample buffer was added to the washed precipitates, and the samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by transfer to nitrocellulose and immunoblotting as described above with anti-GST as the primary antibody. In order to test binding of native CHK to the peptide beads, 15 Î¼l of beads were incubated with 1 ml of Mo7e extract (20 Ã 106 cells equivalent) prepared as described in the previous section. Extracts were incubated for 1.5 h at 5Â°C, with gentle mixing. Precipitates were treated with SDS sample buffer and subjected to SDS-PAGE/Western blotting with anti-CHK or other antibodies, followed by the appropriate secondary antibody and ECL development. Nitrocellulose filters were stripped for reblotting by incubating in 0.2 M glycine, 0.5 M NaCl, pH 2.8. After neutralization with Tris base, the blots were extensively washed with deionized water. Site-directed mutagenesis of full-length c-KIT cDNA in the pCVN vector (19Yarden Y. Kuang W-J. Yang-Feng T. Cpossens L. Munemitsu S. Dull T.J. Chen E. Schlessinger J. Franke U. Ullrich A. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 3341-3351Crossref PubMed Scopus (1330) Google Scholar) (a gift of Dr. Yosef Yarden, Weizmann Institute, Rehovot, Israel) was performed using the Quickchange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). In order to change selected tyrosines to phenylalanines, we used the following synthetic oligonucleotides: GAG GAG ATA AAT GGA AAC AAT GTT TAC ATA GAC CCA ACA C (Tyr568â Phe) and GC AGC GAT AGT ACT AAT GAG ATG GAC ATG AAA CCT GGA G (Tyr721â Phe). The mutant and wild type c-KIT inserts were excised from the pCVN vector with BamHI/XbaI exonucleases and inserted into pcDNA3 vectors for use in the transient transfection experiments. Wild type and mutant c-KIT pcDNA3 vectors were co-transfected into COS 7 cells along with a Î²-galactosidase pSV reporter plasmid (Promega, Madison, WI). For each 10-cm plate of COS 7 cells, 10 Î¼g of c-KIT pcDNA3 plus 5 Î¼g of Î²-galactosidase pSV DNA were co-transfected using LipofectAMINE reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.). After 5 h of transfection, full medium was added, and cells were continued in culture for another 48-72 h. At this time, cells were serum-starved, stimulated with SCF/KL (10 min, 350 ng/ml), and harvested into lysis buffer (as described in the previous section). Supernatants were then subjected to precipitation by SH2CHK-GST fusion protein as described in the previous section. Glutathione-Sepharose precipitates were resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose followed by Western blotting with c-KIT polyclonal antibody. In each case, amounts of extract used in precipitation were normalized for the expression of Î²-galactosidase as measured by an O-nitrophenyl Î²-D-galactopyranoside reporter assay (Promega). In order to identify the tyrosine phosphorylation on c-KIT which is critical for SH2CHK association, we synthesized a series of tyrosine-phosphorylated heptapeptides derived from the cytoplasmic portion of human c-KIT. Since SH2 domains usually associate with residues on the C-terminal side of phosphotyrosine, we chose peptide sequences with tyrosine as the N-terminal residue. We did not include phosphotyrosine sites within the two catalytic domains of c-KIT. These peptides were used to inhibit the interaction of c-KIT from SCF/KL-activated Mo7e cells and the SH2CHK-GST fusion protein as described under âExperimental Procedures.â Complexes of c-KIT and SH2CHK-GST were shown by the presence of c-KIT in washed SH2CHK-GST precipitates (Fig. 1, A and B). Of the peptides that inhibited complex formation, the most significant was the Y*MDMKPG peptide (Fig. 1A, lane 10) with approximately 80% inhibition of association at 100 Î¼M peptide. The nonphosphorylated YMDMKPG peptide failed to inhibit complex formation in this assay (Fig. 2, lane 5). We also found a slight inhibition by the peptide Y*VYIDPT (Fig. 1, lane 9). Recently, it has been reported that the analogous peptide sequence in the PDGF receptor is a site for binding of FYN (15Alonso G. Koegl M. Mazurenko N. Courtneidge S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9840-9848Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar) and of SHC (16Mori S. Ronnstrand L. Koutaro V. Engstrom A. Courtneidge S.A. Claesson-Welsh L. Heldin C.H. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2257-2264Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar, 17Yokote K. Mori S. Hansen K. McGlade J. Dawson T. Heldin C.-H. Claesson-Welsh L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15337-15343Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the case of FYN, binding was significantly greater when both tyrosines of the sequence were phosphorylated. We tested whether this would be the case with SH2CHK binding to c-KIT. As shown in Fig. 2, the diphosphorylated peptide Y*VY*IDPT (lane 1) gave significantly greater inhibition than did the monophosphorylated Y*VYIDPT (lane 2). Furthermore, the monophosphorylated Y*IDPTQL failed to give significant inhibition (Fig. 1, lane 3). Thus, both phosphates are required for inhibition at this site. In order to test the relative abilities of Y*MDMKPG and Y*VY*IDPT to inhibit SH2CHK/c-KIT interaction, various concentrations of peptide from 5 Î¼M to 100 Î¼M were tested (Fig. 3). Densitometry of c-KIT bands (not shown) indicated an IC50 of â¼50 Î¼M for both peptides. In a similar experiment substituting SH3-SH2CHK for SH2CHK, both peptides inhibited to the same extent but with a slightly lower IC50 of 20 Î¼M. These results indicated that binding of CHK is primarily at the Tyr721 and Tyr568/570 sites on c-KIT.Fig. 2Phosphorylation-dependent inhibition of SH2CHK/c-KIT by monophosphorylated Tyr721 and diphosphorylated Tyr568/570 peptides. Extracts from SCF/KL stimulated Mo7e cells were incubated with SH2CHK along with phosphorylated or nonphosphorylated peptides as indicated above each lane.

Extracts from SCF/KL-stimulated Mo7e cells were incubated with either SH2CHK-GST (panels A and C) or with SH3-SH2CHK-GST (panels B and D) in the presence of increasing concentrations of Y*VY*IDPT (panels A and B) or Y*MDMKPG (panels C and D). Western immunoblotting was with anti-c-KIT antibody.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) In order to further test the binding of CHK to the phosphorylated Tyr721 and Tyr768/770 sites, we linked these peptides to Affi-Gel 15 beads, and the association of either SH2CHK-GST fusion protein or native CHK from crude extracts of Mo7e cells was analyzed. As is shown in Fig. 4A, SH2CHK-GST associated in a phosphotyrosine-dependent manner to Y*MDMKPG and Y*VY*IDPT linked to beads as shown by an anti-GST immunoblot of the precipitates. In a control precipitation, GST alone did not associate with the beads (Fig. 4B). A non-receptor peptide derived from the Tyr416 phosphorylation site of FYN (IEDNEY*TARQGA) showed very little phosphate-dependent association to SH2CHK. We also observed association of SH2CHK to the phosphorylated C-terminal tyrosine peptide of SRC kinases (EPQY*QPGENL) (Fig. 4A, lane 8). When we looked at the association of native CHK to peptide beads as shown by anti-CHK immunoblotting, we observed a similar specificity (Fig. 5A). This specificity was in agreement with the peptide inhibition experiments and also indicated that the association was by direct binding of the SH2CHK domain to the tyrosine-phosphorylated site(s) on c-KIT.Fig. 5Association of native CHK and other extract components to phosphopeptide beads. Extracts from SCF/KL-stimulated Mo7e cells were incubated with phosphorylated and nonphosphorylated peptides linked to Affi-Gel 15 beads. Washed precipitates were run on SDS-PAGE. Transfers were immunoblotted with anti-CHK (panel A), anti-FYN (panel B), anti-SHC (panel C), and anti-Csk (panel D). Arrows indicate the presence of the associated proteins.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We have shown by peptide inhibition that the PI3-kinase SH2p85Î± binds specifically to the Y*MDMKPG peptide as does SH2CHK (data not shown). To confirm that CHK binding to c-KIT is not indirectly via PI3-kinase p85, we stripped and reblotted the transfers from Fig. 1 with anti-p85 subunit antibody (Fig. 6). The distribution of p85 in this blot was similar to the distribution of c-KIT seen in Fig. 1. Thus the lack of p85 in the Y*MDMKPG-inhibited precipitate indicates that both p85 and CHK are competing for the same site. If CHK was binding through p85, inhibition with Y*MDMKPG would dissociate only c-KIT from the complex and would retain p85 in the SH2CHK-GST precipitate. In the case of the phosphorylated Tyr568/570 site, we have demonstrated by immunoblotting that association of crude extracts to peptide beads resulted in not only CHK, but also FYN and SHC binding at this di-phosphorylated site (Fig. 5, B and C). Csk did not associate with the diphosphorylated site and only slightly associated with the monophosphorylated site (Fig. 5D, left panel). This result was observed in spite of having a large amount of Csk in the crude extract (Fig. 5D, right panel). In order to confirm that the CHK association at this site was direct, and not through either FYN or SHC, we studied the association of Mo7e extracts to peptide beads with SCF/KL-activated and nonactivated extracts. As can be seen in Fig. 7, there was no observable difference in the association of CHK to the beads when comparing SCF/KL-activated and nonactivated extracts. Thus, it is unlikely that CHK associated with c-KIT through another component which itself was tyrosine-phosphorylated in the course of activation. Experiments attempting to co-precipitate SHC and CHK were negative (data not shown). Experiments attempting to inhibit the SH2CHK/c-KIT receptor complex with phosphopeptides present in SRC kinases were also negative (data not shown), again emphasizing that FYN and SHC were not intermediaries in CHK/c-KIT binding.Fig. 7Lack of dependence of CHK/c-KIT phosphopeptide association on activation of cells by SCF/KL. Extracts from Mo7e cells activated by SCF/KL (left 3 lanes of panels A and B) or not activated by SCF/KL (right 3 lanes of panels A and B) were associated with the phosphorylated or nonphosphorylated peptides linked to beads as indicated above each lane. Phosphorylated peptide associations were conducted in duplicate, while nonphosphorylated peptide associations were done singly. Western immunoblotting was performed with anti-CHK antibody; the arrow indicates the position of the CHK protein.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) In order to confirm the significance of the binding of SH2CHK to the activated c-KIT at the Tyr721 and Tyr568/570 sites, we constructed mutant c-KIT cDNAs for either Tyr721â Phe (designated 2162 c-KIT) or Tyr568â Phe (designated 1702 c-KIT) and attempted to demonstrate whether these mutant proteins were still able to associate with the SH2CHK. As can be seen in Fig. 8B, the wild type, Tyr568â Phe (1702), and Tyr721â Phe (2162) c-KIT constructs expressed comparable amounts of c-KIT protein as observed in c-KIT Western blots of crude extracts from the transfectants, when corrected for the extent of transfection as measured by the Î²-galactosidase reporter assay. When such extracts were precipitated by anti-c-KIT antibody and blotted with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody, comparable SCF/KL-dependent phosphorylation was observed for wild type and both mutant c-KIT proteins (data not shown). This indicated that the expressed protein is capable of ligand stimulated tyrosine autophosphorylation even with the replacement of the specific tyrosines by phenylalanines. When wild type c-KIT-expressing cell extracts were incubated with SH2CHK-GST, c-KIT associated in an SCF/KL-dependent manner as was observed with endogenous c-KIT (Fig. 8A, lanes 1 an 2). As expected, no c-KIT association was observed in the GST control precipitation (Fig. 8A, lane 8). In these experiments, when SH2CHK was incubated with either of the two mutant c-KIT-expressing extracts, the SCF/KL-activated Tyr568â Phe c-KIT was completely unable to associate (lanes 3 and 4), while the Tyr721â Phe c-KIT still retained the ability to associate with SH2CHK-GST in an SCF/KL-dependent manner (lanes 5 and 6). In this report, we have identified the sites of binding of the SH2CHK domain in the activated human c-KIT. Initial studies involving phosphopeptide inhibition indicated that it was the monophosphorylated Tyr721 and the diphosphorylated Tyr568/570 sites on c-KIT which were important in binding SH2CHK. To test the relative affinities of the two sites, the concentration dependence of the two phosphopeptides for inhibition of the c-KIT/SH2CHK interaction was assessed. Both peptides appeared to inhibit c-KIT/SH2CHK equally well. As has been shown with the PDGF receptor in the binding of SH2FYN to the diphosphorylated site, the second phosphotyrosine of Y*VY*IDPT resembles the glutamic acid which is present in the high affinity Y*EEI peptide as predicted (15Alonso G. Koegl M. Mazurenko N. Courtneidge S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9840-9848Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar, 19Yarden Y. Kuang W-J. Yang-Feng T. Cpossens L. Munemitsu S. Dull T.J. Chen E. Schlessinger J. Franke U. Ullrich A. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 3341-3351Crossref PubMed Scopus (1330) Google Scholar). The PI3-kinase site, on the other hand, has a glutamate residue at the +2 position. However, like the diphosphorylated site, the PI3-kinase site has hydrophobic amino acids at the +1 and +3 positions. Thus, it is not surprising that the SH2CHK was capable of being competed by the Y*VY*IDPT and the Y*MDMKPG peptides. The SH2FYN and SH2SHC both favored the binding to the Tyr568/570 site over the Tyr721 site. Studies of SH2SHC binding to activated PDGF receptor indicated binding to multiple sites (17Yokote K. Mori S. Hansen K. McGlade J. Dawson T. Heldin C.-H. Claesson-Welsh L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15337-15343Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, in these studies, binding of the diphosphorylated Tyr579/581 peptide was not analyzed in the peptide association experiments. Thus, it is likely in the case of the PDGF receptor that binding of SHC is favored at the Tyr579/581 site in light of our results. Other studies of FYN binding to the PDGF receptor (15Alonso G. Koegl M. Mazurenko N. Courtneidge S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9840-9848Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar) showed a clear preference for the diphosphorylated Tyr579/581 site over other sites. The binding affinity of FYN to the PDGF receptor (IC50 = 2 Î¼M) was higher than was the binding of c-KIT to CHK (IC50 = 50 Î¼M for SH2CHK/c-KIT and 20 Î¼M for SH3-SH2CHK/c-KIT). This difference may be due to a less native structure in the isolated SH2 compared to the intact protein. The lowering of the IC50 in the case of SH3-SH2CHK/c-KIT is consistent with this. Thus, had we utilized the native CHK, we might have seen an even lower IC50. However, both Tyr568/570 and Tyr721 peptides showed a reduction in IC50 when SH3-SH2CHK was bound to c-KIT, indicating that the relative bindings of native CHK to the two sites are likely to be similar. To demonstrate that the interaction of SH2CHK at the two c-KIT sites is direct and not mediated by other proteins in the system, we showed that native CHK from cell extracts as well as a bacterial SH2CHK-GST fusion protein can bind to phosphorylated peptides linked to beads. This was an unequivocal indication that the CHK/c-KIT interaction was direct and not a result of binding via intermediates in the crude extracts. The possibility of intermediates in the binding was a concern because the sites identified are known to bind other SH2-containing proteins. The Tyr721 site is known to bind the p85 regulatory subunit of the PI3-kinase (20Serve H. Hsu Y-C. Besmer P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6026-6030Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the PDGF receptor, the analogous Tyr579/581 juxtamembrane site is known to bind SH2 domains of SHC and SRC family kinases (15Alonso G. Koegl M. Mazurenko N. Courtneidge S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9840-9848Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar, 16Mori S. Ronnstrand L. Koutaro V. Engstrom A. Courtneidge S.A. Claesson-Welsh L. Heldin C.H. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2257-2264Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar, 17Yokote K. Mori S. Hansen K. McGlade J. Dawson T. Heldin C.-H. Claesson-Welsh L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15337-15343Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The demonstration of direct binding could not completely rule out an additional association via FYN or SHC. Our results of blotting the peptide bead/lysate precipitates with anti-SHC and anti-FYN confirmed that indeed, SHC and FYN were binding to the juxtamembrane phosphorylated Tyr568/570 sequence of c-KIT. If these or other components were to serve as intermediates or adapters in the binding of SH2CHK to c-KIT, they themselves would have to be phosphorylated. However, nearly all tyrosine phosphorylation occurs after growth factor stimulation. Thus, the fact that there was no difference in association of peptide beads to CHK from SCF/KL-activated or nonactivated cells indicated that, again, an intermediate was unlikely. Therefore, it was reasonable to expect that we would not be able to co-precipitate SHC and SH2CHK, or that SRC phosphorylation site peptides would not interfere with SH2CHK/c-KIT interaction. It is also notable that blotting the precipitates of extracts and peptide beads with anti-Csk did not show significant binding to the Tyr568/570 site, but did show some weak binding to the Tyr721 site. This observation is in spite of the fact that a significant amount of Csk was present in the crude lysates of these cells. Specificity of SH2Csk as determined by peptide libraries (19Yarden Y. Kuang W-J. Yang-Feng T. Cpossens L. Munemitsu S. Dull T.J. Chen E. Schlessinger J. Franke U. Ullrich A. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 3341-3351Crossref PubMed Scopus (1330) Google Scholar) shows a preference for Y*TKM. The similarity to the site Y*MDMKPG particularly at the +1 and +3 positions may explain the slight binding to this peptide. Csk has been shown to bind to tyrosine-phosphorylated paxillin, tensin, and focal adhesion kinase (FAK) (21Sabe H. Hata A. Okada M. Nakagawa H. Hanafusa H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 3984-3988Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar, 22Berman M. Jonkov V. Virtanen I. Alitalo K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 711-722Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This emphasizes the role of Csk in the regulation of SRC kinases located in focal adhesions. There have been no reports in the literature of Csk having the ability to bind to growth factor activated receptor tyrosine kinases. Thus, it is more likely that SRC family kinases bound to growth factor receptors such as c-KIT are phosphorylated and down-regulated by CHK and not Csk. The implication of the c-KIT site directed mutagenesis is that in the association of SH2CHK to intact c-KIT, only the Tyr568/570 site is effectively able to bind while the Tyr721 site is not able to bind this SH2. This is in apparent contradiction to the data involving phosphopeptide inhibition and direct binding of CHK to phosphopeptide beads. A possible explanation for this is that the heptapeptides used in the experiments do not accurately reflect the 3-dimensional structure of the native c-KIT. Thus, the Y*MDMKPG peptide may resemble the Y*VY*IDPT peptide sufficiently such that it could compete for the Tyr568/570 site. It may also be that this Y*MDMKPG peptide linked to beads, is able to bind to the SH2CHK even though the native c-KIT is unable to bind to SH2CHK at the Tyr721 site. The mutagenesis experiment on the other hand does not rely on peptides to distinguish the binding and more accurately reflects the specificities of the protein-protein interactions. Furthermore, the mutation experiment indicates that there are no other sites on c-KIT that are able to bind the SH2CHK since binding was completely abolished by the mutation at the Tyr568 site. Thus, the data taken together indicate that it is only the Tyr568/570 site that is able to bind CHK through its SH2 domain. A potential model for the regulation of SRC kinase by CHK involves the SCF/KL stimulated dimerization of c-KIT, one bearing an activated SRC kinase and the other bearing the CHK kinase. This dimerization would bring activated SRC kinase into proximity to CHK, leading to the down-regulation of SRC kinase activity. Further studies will be needed to establish whether SRC kinase bound to c-KIT is the primary target for CHK, and to elucidate the downstream effects resulting from these interactions.

The modulation of resistance to DOX, paclitaxel, vinblastine, and etoposide was also determined by MTT assays in the presence of the MDR modulator PSC (2 Î¼M) or verapamil 6 Î¼M. These concentrations of the modulators are noncytotoxic and completely reverse resistance to DOX in our cellular MDR models. The modulation ratio was obtained by comparing IC50 values in the presence and absence of modulators (22Chen G. JaffrÃ©zou J.-P. Fleming W.H. DurÃ¡n G.E. Sikic B.I. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 4980-4987PubMed Google Scholar). Intracellular drug accumulation was quantified using radiolabeled drugs as described previously (23Beketic-Oreskovic L. DurÃ¡n G.E. Chen G.

The flow cytometric analysis of Rh-123 retention and P-gp expression were determined by a dual laser flow cytometer (FACS-IIâ¢; Becton-Dickinson Corp., Mountain View, CA). Double labeling was performed with Rh-123 and the monoclonal antibody UIC2 Immunotech, Inc. (Westbrook, ME). The oligonucleotides used as amplimers in this study were synthesized by Operon Technologies (Alameda, CA) and Ana-Gen Inc. (Palo Alto, CA).

Open table in a new tab The isolation of total RNA and procedures of RT-PCR were performed as previously reported (22Chen G. JaffrÃ©zou J.-P. Fleming W.H. DurÃ¡n G.E. Sikic B.I. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 4980-4987PubMed Google Scholar, 23Beketic-Oreskovic L. DurÃ¡n G.E. Chen G. Dumontet C. Sikic B.I. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1995; 87: 1593-1602Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). PCR conditions for each pair of primers were determined by evaluating the linearity of the generation of PCR products with serial dilutions of cDNA (5, 25, 50, and 100 ng per reaction). Reactions were determined to be in the linear range of amplification by comparison of at least two dilutions of each sample and two cycle end points. All PCR experiments were performed on RNAs from several different preparations. mdr1 PCR products were subjected to heteroduplex analysis using the mutation detection enhancement system (J.T. Baker Inc.). An 8-12% MDEâ¢ Gel (J.T. Baker) was used and stained with ethidium bromide, and the desired products were located on an ultraviolet transilluminator and photographed. The results were further assessed by DNA sequencing of the PCR products (Amersham Life Science Inc.). Sequences were obtained from several preparations of cDNA, and these were compared with the parental cell line, Dx5 and the published human mdr1 sequence (27Chen C. Clark D. Ueda K. Pastan I. Gottesman M.M. Roninson I.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 506-514Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In order to identify the presence of the mutation in genomic DNA of DxP cells, we isolated genomic DNA from MES-SA, Dx5, and DxP cells. The PCR products were obtained by amplifying the target region using genomic specific primers located in introns 9 and 10, which are adjacent to exon 10 of mdr1: forward primer, 5â²-ATGGATCCTCTTCACATTCCTCAGGTAT-3â²; reverse primer, 5â²-CTCTCGAGGGCCAACTCAGACTTACATTAT-3â² (27Chen C.

Heteroduplex analysis was performed, and heteroduplex bands were subjected to PCR reamplification. The bands were purified from 8% polyacrylamide gel and subcloned into the pGEM-T vector (Promega). Individual clones were selected for sequencing. Western blotting with chemiluminescent detection (ECL kit, Amersham Corp.) was used for the analysis of P-gp and Topo IIÎ± proteins. Total cell lysates from the exponentially growing cells were used for P-gp immunoblotting (22Chen G. JaffrÃ©zou J.-P. Fleming W.H. DurÃ¡n G.E. Sikic B.I.

Plasma membranes for photoaffinity labeling were prepared as described (28Chambers T.C. McAvoy E.M. Jacobs J.W. Eilon G. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 7679-7686Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), followed by assays of displacement of the P-gp probes [125I]iodoarylazidoprazosin and [3H]azidopine (29JaffrÃ©zou J.-P. Chen G. DurÃ¡n G.E. Muller C. Bordier C. Laurent G. Sikic B.I. Levade T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1266: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). MES-SA, Dx5, and DxP cells (100 Î¼g of protein) were incubated with [125I]iodoarylazidoprazosin (81.4 TBq/mmol; DuPont NEN) and [3H]Azidopine (Amersham) in the presence or absence of modulators in a 10 mM Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.4) at a final volume of 50 Î¼l. These preparations were incubated at 25Â°C for 1 h in the dark, followed by a 20-min exposure to a 254-nm UV source (UVP, Inc., San Gabriel, CA). 50 Î¼l of loading buffer was added, and proteins were separated on an 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, dried, and analyzed by autoradiography. Subcloning of cells was performed by limiting dilution. Both resistant and revertant clones were analyzed for the MDR phenotype, drug accumulation, and RT-PCR or heteroduplex as described above. A cDNA library was constructed from DxP cells in Î»gt10 phage, and mutant mdr1 clones were identified by hybridization, digested with NotI, and subcloned into the expression vector NotI site of pcDNA3 (Invitrogen). The plasmid pcDMDR1.4, which codes for wild-type P-gp was obtained by subcloning a BamHI-XhoI fragment of pMDR2000XS containing mdr1 sequence from position â140 to position 4240 into pcDNA3 multiple cloning sites. An additional mutant mdr1 plasmid, pcDMDR3.5, was derived by replacing a 211-base pair NsiI-SfuI fragment of mdr1 from pMDR2000XS with a PCR fragment from DxP cells spanning the position Phe335 deletion. Transfection of drug-sensitive MES-SA cells and K562 cells was performed by electroporation (30Baum C. Foster P. Hegewisch-Becker S. Harbers K. Biotechniques. 1994; 17: 1058-1062PubMed Google Scholar) and Lipofectin-mediated DNA transfer (Life Technologies, Inc.). Recipient cells (2 Ã 107), were transfected with 10 Î¼g of plasmid. In a transient transfection assay, the MDR phenotype was tested after 48 h of incubation. Stably transfected cells were obtained by selection with G418 (800 Î¼g/ml) for 14 days. Stepwise selection of the MDR human sarcoma cell line Dx5 in the presence of increasing DOX concentrations and constant exposure to PSC (2 Î¼M) resulted, over a 1-year period, in the stably DOX- and PSC-resistant cell line, DxP. Karyotypic analysis revealed 47 or 48 chromosomes in both the Dx5 and DxP cells with a similar G-banding pattern of chromosome 7 (data not shown). Fluorescence in situ hybridization demonstrated two copies of chromosome 7 in both Dx5 and DxP cells, whereas parental, drug-sensitive MES-SA cells have 45 chromosomes and one chromosome 7 (24Harker W.G. MacKintosh F.R. Sikic B.I. Cancer Res. 1983; 43: 4943-4950PubMed Google Scholar, 25Harker W.G. Sikic B.I. Cancer Res. 1985; 45: 4091-4096PubMed Google Scholar). The drug resistance phenotype of DxP cells is shown in Table II and Fig. 1. Their level of resistance to the anthracycline DOX is similar to that of the parental Dx5 cells, with a slightly decreased cross-resistance to daunorubicin. The most notable alterations were found in levels of resistance to dactinomycin and Vinca alkaloids. Resistance to vinblastine decreased 17-fold, to vincristine 25-fold, and to vinorelbine 9-fold (to a level similar to that of drug-sensitive MES-SA cells). Resistance to amsacrine decreased 13-fold, and sensitivity to dactinomycin was completely restored. This cell line maintained high levels of resistance to colchicine and paclitaxel (TaxolÂ®), and moderately decreased resistance to podophyllotoxins (etoposide and teniposide). There was no significant difference in cellular generation time (22 h) compared with parental Dx5 cells.Table II.The multidrug resistance phenotype of Dx5 and DxP cellsCytotoxin-Fold Resistancea-Fold resistance was determined as described under âExperimental Procedures.â Values are the means of at least three to six independent experiments.MES-SADx5DxPDx5/DxPb-Fold resistance difference in DxP cells compared with parental Dx5 cells.AnthracyclinesDaunorubicin1 (20)cValues in parenthesis represent the IC50 values (nM of drug-sensitive MES-SA cells.75253Doxorubicin1 (40)80771Anti-microtubuleColchicine1 (1)79751Paclitaxel1 (1)1751002Vinblastine1 (4)2431417Vincristine1 (2)199825Vinorelbine1 (60)1729EpipodophyllotoxinsEtoposide1 (500)42172Teniposide1 (100)135533OthersAmsacrine1 (100)26213Dactinomycin1 (0.3)1831183a -Fold resistance was determined as described under âExperimental Procedures.â Values are the means of at least three to six independent experiments.b -Fold resistance difference in DxP cells compared with parental Dx5 cells.c Values in parenthesis represent the IC50 values (nM of drug-sensitive MES-SA cells. Open table in a new tab Modulation of resistance to several MDR-related cytotoxins by PSC (2 Î¼M), cyclosporine (3 Î¼M), and verapamil (6 Î¼M) was examined by the MTT assay. PSC, the most potent of the modulators used, completely restored the sensitivity of the highly multidrug-resistant cell line Dx5 to DOX, vinblastine, paclitaxel, vincristine, and colchicine, relative to the drug-sensitive MES-SA cells. In contrast, DxP cells were almost completely resistant to the modulating effects of PSC, substantially resistant to cyclosporine, and somewhat less resistant to modulation by verapamil (Table III, Fig. 1).Table III.Modulation of multidrug resistance in Dx5 and DxP cellsCytotoxin-Fold resistanceaFold resistance was determined as described under âExperimental Procedures.âMES-SADx5DxPDoxorubicin18077+2 Î¼M PSC1153+3 Î¼M Cyclosporine0.5230+6 Î¼M Verapamil0.5418Paclitaxel1175100+2 Î¼M PSC0.3-1bIncreased sensitivity to cytotoxins was observed occasionally in MES-SA cells treated with MDR modulators, although these cells do not express mdr1.15+3 Î¼M Cyclosporine0.5-11338+6 Î¼M Verapamil0.3-12544Vinblastine124314+2 Î¼M PSC0.3-1112+3 Î¼M Cyclosporine0.5-167+6 Î¼M Verapamil0.4-143Vincristine11998+2 Î¼M PSC0.717+6 Î¼M Verapamil0.3-173Colchicine17975+2 Î¼M PSC1170+3 Î¼M Cyclosporine1630+6 Î¼M Verapamil11230Etoposide14218+2 Î¼M PSC1118a Fold resistance was determined as described under âExperimental Procedures.âb Increased sensitivity to cytotoxins was observed occasionally in MES-SA cells treated with MDR modulators, although these cells do not express mdr1. Open table in a new tab Total RNA was extracted from isolated DxP clones and analyzed by RT-PCR for the presence of mdr1, Topo IIÎ±, Topo IIÎ², and mrp transcripts (Fig. 2). In comparison with the parental Dx5 cells, DxP displayed levels of mdr1 transcripts similar to the parental Dx5 cells. The expression of mrp was compared with MES-SA and Dx5 cells and with normal human lung tissue as a positive control. A similar level of expression of mrp was observed in human lung tissue, MES-SA sarcoma cells (data not shown), and Dx5 and DxP cells. While no significant difference was seen in Topo IIÎ± transcripts, DxP cells manifested a 2-fold elevation of Topo IIÎ² expression relative to Dx5 cells (Fig. 2). P-gp expression and function were analyzed by RT-PCR, immunoblotting with the C219 antibody, and flow cytometry with the antibody UIC2 (Fig. 3, Fig. 4). Dx5 and DxP cells displayed similarly high levels of expression of P-gp. Immunohistochemical staining of cells with the MRK16 and C219 antibodies confirmed that the expression of P-gp on DxP cells was predominantly localized to the plasma membrane and similar in amount to that observed in Dx5 cells (data not shown).Fig. 4Functional analysis of Rh-123 retention and P-gp expression in DxP cells by flow cytometry. Cells were incubated first with rhodamine 123 for 40 min with or without the MDR modulators verapamil (VER) and PSC and then with either the UIC2 antibody or an IgG2a isotype control (40 Î¼g/ml) for 20 min and subsequently with Texas Red-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG2a secondary antibody for another 20 min. The upper panels (MES-SA cells) and middle panels (Dx5 cells) were used as negative and positive controls, respectively, for MDR. The left column depicts cells without MDR modulators, the middle column includes 8 Î¼M verapamil, and the right column includes 2 Î¼M PSC. One of three separate experiments is depicted.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Expression of Topo IIÎ± isoforms by immunoblotting revealed a slight increase in DxP compared with Dx5 cells. Neither Dx5 nor DxP cells had detectable expression of the p110 major vault protein, although the drug-sensitive MES-SA cells from which Dx5 cells were originally derived are weakly positive for p110 (data not shown). The cellular accumulation of the fluorescent P-gp substrate Rh-123 was markedly decreased in Dx5 cells, as expected for MDR cells (Fig. 4). In contrast, DxP cells (although expressing abundant P-gp by UIC2 staining) manifested Rh-123 retention similar to the MDR-negative MES-SA cell line. PSC (2 Î¼M) completely restored Rh-123 accumulation in the Dx5 cell line, to levels similar to MES-SA and DxP cells (Fig. 4). Intracellular accumulations of [3H]daunorubicin, [3H]vinblastine, and [3H]cyclosporine were measured to compare the function of P-gp in Dx5 and DxP cells. Both Dx5 and DxP cells displayed similar decreases in [3H]daunorubicin accumulation, relative to the MES-SA cell line, while the accumulation of [3H]vinblastine was approximately 3-fold higher in DxP than Dx5 cells (Fig. 5, A and"
https://openalex.org/W2076023322,"NRE1 is a DNA sequence element through which Ku antigen/DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK) catalytic subunit represses the induction of mouse mammary tumor virus transcription by glucocorticoids. Although Ku is an avid binder of DNA ends and has the ability to translocate along DNA, we report that direct sequence-specific Ku binding occurs with higher affinity (Kd = 0.84 Â± 0.24 nM) than DNA end binding. Comparison of Ku binding to several sequences over which Ku can accumulate revealed two classes of sequence. Sequences with similarity to NRE1 competed efficiently for NRE1 binding. Conversely, sequences lacking similarity to NRE1 competed poorly for Ku and were not recognized in the absence of DNA ends. Phosphorylation of glucocorticoid receptor (GR) fusion proteins by DNA-PK reflected Ku DNA-binding preferences and demonstrated that co-localization of GR with DNA-PK on DNA in cis was critical for efficient phosphorylation. Phosphorylation of the GR fusion protein by DNA-PK mapped to a single site, Ser-527. This site occurs adjacent the GR nuclear localization sequence between the DNA and ligand binding domains of GR, and thus its phosphorylation, if confirmed, has the potential to affect receptor function in vivo.

Specific targeting of DNA-PK to DNA binding sites in vivo is likely to be critical for determining substrate phosphorylation for two reasons. First, the affinity of DNA-PK for substrate (Km = 210 Î¼M) is low. Second, DNA-PK is a broad specificity kinase with a very simple recognition sequence (Ser-Gln or Thr-Gln) (1Anderson C.W.

Remarkably, once bound to DNA, Ku is able to translocate from its point of entry (8de Vries E. van Driel W. Bergsma W.G. Arnberg A.C. van der Vliet P.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1989; 208: 65-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). However, while Ku translocates freely along DNA in vitro, it appears to be unable to translocate through a nucleosome (10Paillard S. Strauss F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 5619-5624Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Thus, the effective range of Ku translocation in vivo is likely to be quite limited. DNA-PKcs has extensive similarity to the Ataxia telangiectasia gene product and to the family of lipid kinases that includes phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (11Hartley K.O. Gell D. Smith G.C.M.

Recently, DNA-PK has been shown to play important roles in double-stranded DNA break repair and V(D)J recombination (14Roth D.B. Lindahl T. Gellert M. Curr. Biol. 1995; 5: 496-499Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar).

DNA-PKcs has been shown to be required for the resolution of coding ends during V(D)J recombination, and mutation in DNA-PKcs has been proposed to account for the defects in the severe combined immunodeficient (SCID) mouse. In addition to recruiting DNA-PKcs to repair and recombination sites, Ku is proposed to protect the ends of recombination and repair intermediates from exonuclease digestion (23Rathmell W.K. Chu G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 7623-7627Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). The relaxed substrate specificity of DNA-PK in vitro has led to proposals for its participation in other nuclear processes, particularly transcription and DNA replication. For example, a role for DNA-PK in repressing RNA polymerase I transcription has been suggested (24Kuhn A. Stefanovsky V. Grummt I. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 2057-2063Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 25Kuhn A. Gottlieb T.M. Jackson S.P. Grummt I.

Additionally, a large number of sequence-specific transcription factors have been shown to be substrates for DNA-PK in vitro (1Anderson C.W. Lees-Miller S.P. Crit. Rev. Eukaryot. Gene Exp. 1992; 2: 283-314PubMed Google Scholar, 27Finnie N. Gottlieb T. Hartley K. Jackson S.P. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1993; 21: 930-935Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 28Weigel N.L. Carter T.H. Schrader W.T. O'Malley B.W. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 8-14PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting a role in the regulation of transcription by RNA polymerase II. Indeed, DNA-PK has recently been shown to be associated with the RNA polymerase II holoenzyme (29Maldonado E. Shiekhattar R. Sheldon M. Cho H. Drapkin R. Rickert P. Lees E. Anderson C.W. Linn S. Reinberg D. Nature. 1996; 381: 86-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). As the targeting of Ku to transcriptional regulatory regions by translocation from DNA ends is likely to very limited, the potential ability of Ku to bind directly to transcriptional regulatory elements has generated considerable interest. Over the past several years, there have been numerous reports of the accumulation of Ku in vitro over DNA sequence elements that function to regulate transcription (9Falzon M. Fewell J.W. Kuff E.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10546-10552Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 30Genersch E. Eckerskorn C. Lottspeich F. Herzog C. Kuhn K. Poschl E.

It has not been clear, however, whether the presence of Ku over these sequences represented direct sequence-specific DNA recognition or the accumulation of Ku translocated from the ends of the DNA fragments employed. Recently, we demonstrated that a DNA sequence element, NRE1 (negative regulatory element 1), in the long terminal repeat (LTR) of mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV) is a direct, sequence-specific, DNA binding site for Ku/DNA-PKcs in the absence of DNA ends or other structural features (38Giffin W. Torrance H. Rodda D.J. Prefontaine G.G. Pope L. Hache R.G.J. Nature. 1996; 380: 265-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). In transfection experiments, NRE1 specifically repressed glucocorticoid hormone activated MMTV transcription in a Ku- and DNA-PKcs-dependent manner. Further, in vitro, DNA-PK efficiently directed the phosphorylation of glucocorticoid receptor (GR) and octamer transcription factor 1 (Oct-1), two transcription factors that bind the MMTV promoter in vivo in response to glucocorticoids (39Bruggemeier U. Kalff M. Franke S. Scheidereit C. Beato M. Cell. 1991; 64: 565-572Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 40Archer T.K. Lefebvre P. Wolford R.G. Hager G.L.

EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1737-1751Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). In the experiments presented here, we have examined the DNA requirements for Ku binding and DNA-PK phosphorylation of rat GR in detail. Our results demonstrate that sequence-specific Ku binding to NRE1 is strongly preferred to DNA end binding and that DNA-PK catalytic activity closely parallels Ku DNA-binding preferences. Furthermore, our data indicate that only the subset of previously proposed sequence-specific Ku binding sites with similarity to NRE1 are likely to be direct sequence-specific Ku binding sites. Experiments with a GR fusion protein substrate indicated that linkage of DNA-PK and substrate in cis on DNA markedly increased the efficiency of substrate phosphorylation. Intriguingly, phosphorylation of the GR fusion protein occurred at Ser-527, in the region of the receptor connecting the DNA and ligand binding domains and immediately adjacent to the dominant nuclear localization sequence of the receptor. Oligonucleotides were synthesized on a Beckman Oligo 1000 DNA synthesizer. Sequences of the upper-strands of oligonucleotides are shown in Fig. 1, except for the oligonucleotide containing a binding site for nuclear factor 1 (NF1), upper strand (5â²-GTTCTTTTGGAATCTATCCAAGTCTTA-3â²). The NRE1 and PRE oligonucleotides have been described previously (42Giffin W. Torrance H. Saffran H. MacLeod H.L. Hache R.J.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1449-1459Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Microcircles containing the GR- or C3H-MMTV NRE1 elements, four copies of a consensus octamer motifs, the U1 small nuclear RNA PSE, rc-mos IAP enhancer core or HSE were prepared as described previously from 223- or 292-bp pBluescript fragments containing one (NRE1, U1, IAP, HSE) or four copies (octamer) of the individual oligonucleotides cloned into the SmaI site of pBluescript (38Giffin W. Torrance H. Rodda D.J. Prefontaine G.G. Pope L. Hache R.G.J. Nature. 1996; 380: 265-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Purified recircularized DNA was completely resistant to S1 nuclease, exonuclease III, and Bal31. Expression and purification of Ku from insect cells was essentially by the protocol of Ono et al. (43Ono M. Tucker P.W. Capra J.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 3918-3924Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Baculovirus expression vectors VBB2-Kup86 and VBB2-Kup70tH6, encoding the p86 subunit and a hexahistidine-tagged p70 subunit of human Ku autoantigen, respectively, were co-infected into Sf9 cells. Three days post-infection, cells were harvested and lysed by sonication in 40 mM HEPES, pH 7.9, 1 mM EDTA, 2 mM dithiothreitol, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 1 Î¼g/ml leupeptin, 1 Î¼g/ml pepstatin, and 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Ku heterodimers were then purified using a Ni2- affinity resin (His-Bind Resin, Novagen). pGEX-2T-X568 encoding glutathione S-transferase GR fusion protein containing amino acids 407-568 of rat GR (GST-GR) was created by cloning the BamHI-EcoRI fragment of pSP64X568 (44Rusconi S. Yamamoto K.R. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 1309-1315Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar) in frame into the BamHI-EcoRI sites of pGEX-2T (Pharmacia). pGEX-2T-C500Y encoding GST-GR containing a Cys â Tyr mutation at position 500 of the DBD (GST-GRC500Y) was created by introduction of a BamHI-SmaI fragment of pT7C500Y (45Schena M. Freedman L.P. Yamamoto K.R. Genes Dev. 1989; 3: 1590-1601Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar) in frame into the BamHI-SmaI sites of pGEX-2T. GST fusion proteins were expressed in E. coli by growing transformed cells at 3Â°C overnight, followed by induction with 1 mM isopropyl-1-thio-Î²-D-galactopyranoside for 4-16 h at 23Â°C. Induced bacteria were harvested and resuspended in lysis buffer (25 mM HEPES, pH 7.9, 100 mM KCl, 20% glycerol, 2 mM EDTA, 0.2 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) supplemented with 100 Î¼g/ml lysozyme and incubated for 10 min at 4Â°C. Cells and DNA were sheared by passage through a series of 18-, 20-, and 25-gauge needles, followed by sonication 10 times for 40 s in the presence of 0.1% Nonidet P-40 at 4Â°C. Lysates were centrifuged 10 min at 10,000 Ã g, and the supernatants were incubated with 3 ml of glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) for 90 min. The beads were subsequently washed five times with 10 bed volumes of lysis buffer and three times with 20 bed volumes of 60% lysis buffer containing 0.1% Nonidet P-40. GST-GR beads were stored at 4Â°C with 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and 0.02% NaN3. To separate the GST domain from the DBD, 20 Î¼l of a 1:1 slurry of beads were incubated with 0.5 units of thrombin (Novagen) at room temperature for 30 min. pHC17 and pHC364 have been described previously (46Mink S. Ponta H. Cato A.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 2017-2024Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Linear and covalently closed circular plasmids were prepared as described previously (38Giffin W. Torrance H. Rodda D.J. Prefontaine G.G. Pope L. Hache R.G.J. Nature. 1996; 380: 265-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Covalently closed circular plasmids were completely resistant to digestion with exonuclease III, Bal31, and S1 nuclease. Binding of purified baculoviral Ku to 10.8 pmol of 32P-kinased microcircle DNA was performed in 20 Î¼l of 12 mM HEPES, pH 7.9, 12% glycerol, 60 mM KCl, 0.12 mM EDTA, 1 Î¼g of BSA. 1 Î¼g of highly sheared calf thymus DNA was included in assays with Jurkat nuclear extracts. Binding reactions were incubated for 20 min at room temperature. Monoclonal antibodies included in mobility shift incubations included Ku antibody 162 (47Reeves W.H. J. Exp. Med. 1985; 161: 18-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar), octamer transcription factor-homeodomain antibody YL 15 (48Lai J.S. Herr W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 6958-6962Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar), and GR antibody BuGR (49Gametchu B. Harrison R. Endocrinology. 1984; 114: 274-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). For competition experiments, increasing concentrations of unlabeled oligonucleotides were added with the 32P-labeled GR-MMTV NRE1 microcircle to the binding mix prior to addition of Ku. Protein-DNA complexes were resolved by electrophoresis on 3% polyacrylamide gels (acrylamide/bisacrylamide = 30:1) in 0.5 Ã TBE for 300 V-h. Gels were dried and exposed to autoradiography film (DuPont) using Reflection intensifying screens (DuPont) and/or quantified by phosphorimage analysis using a Bio-Rad GS-525 Molecular Imager System. The dissociation constant (Kd) of baculovirus-expressed Ku for NRE1 containing microcircles was determined in a manner similar to that described previously (50Fujita T. Nolan G.P. Ghosh S. Baltimore D. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 775-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar, 51Fuernkranz H.A. Wang Y. Karathanasis S.K. Mak P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 5665-5671Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 52Gualberto A. Patrick R.M. Walsh K. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 815-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). EMSA was performed with a constant amount of recombinant Ku incubated with an increasing concentration of DNA (2.7-43.5 pmol) in a 40-Î¼l reaction volume. After electrophoresis the bound and free DNA were quantified by phosphorimager. To determine the concentration of bound DNA, a standard curve was created using the total (bound - free) adjusted volume (counts Ã mm2) from the phosphorimager versus concentration of total DNA. Total DNA concentration was determined by subsequent scintillation counting of excised bands (Beckman LS-3801). Labeling efficiency was 100%, as formation of covalently closed microcircles required incorporation of [Î±-32P]dATP during fill in of the XhoI site prior to microcircle ligation. Kd was determined by Scatchard analysis (Kd = â1/slope) in three independent trials and expressed as mean Â± S.E. Phosphorylation of GST-GR by DNA-PK was performed essentially as described previously (38Giffin W. Torrance H. Rodda D.J. Prefontaine G.G. Pope L. Hache R.G.J. Nature. 1996; 380: 265-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar) using 10 ng of supercoiled, linear, or covalently closed circular pHC17 or pHC364. Plasmids were linearized with HindIII as indicated and, in some instances, recircularized with T4 DNA ligase. Supercoiled, covalently closed circular, and linear plasmids were purified through agarose gels prior to use in kinase assays. Kinase reactions were carried out for 15 min at 30Â°C in kinase buffer (50 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 100 mM KCl, 10 mM MgCl2, 0.2 mM EGTA) using 10 ng of plasmid DNA, 0.5 units of DNA-PK (Promega), 5 Î¼Ci of [Î²-32P]ATP (6000 Ci/mmol, DuPont), and 5-15 Î¼l of a 1:1 slurry of GST-GR bound to glutathione-Sepharose beads, prewashed twice in kinase buffer. Following kinasing, the beads were washed three times in kinase buffer to remove free [Î²-32P]ATP. The GST-GR was eluted by boiling in SDS-PAGE sample buffer prior to or following thrombin cleavage as indicated. 32P incorporation was determined by autoradiography or phosphorimage analysis of 12% SDS-PAGE gels. Phosphorylated GST-GR was recovered from SDS-PAGE gels, digested with L-1-tosylamido-2-phenylethyl chloromethyl ketone-treated trypsin, and analyzed by reverse-phase HPLC and electrophoresis on 40% alkaline polyacrylamide gels as described previously (53Zhang Y. Beck C.A. Poletti A. Edwards D.P. Weigel N.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31034-31040Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Prior to further manipulation, tryptic peptides were eluted from alkaline polyacrylamide gels, dried, redissolved in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, and purified over SepPak C18 columns (Millipore). Digestion of purified phosphopeptide with sequencing grade endoproteinase AspN (Boehringer Manheim) was performed using 0.2 Î¼g of AspN (54Drapeau G.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 839-840Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) in 200 Î¼l of 50 mM sodium phosphate buffer, pH 8.0, for 8-16 h at 3Â°C. Additional aliquots of AspN were added at 4-h intervals. Digestion products were resolved on 40% alkaline polyacrylamide gels (55West M.H.P. Wu S. Bonner W.M. Electrophoresis. 1984; 5: 133-138Crossref Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Manual [32P]phosphate release studies were performed on purified peptide according to a protocol originally described by Sullivan and Wong (56Sullivan S. Wong C.W. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 197: 65-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), as modified by Zhang et al. (53Zhang Y. Beck C.A. Poletti A. Edwards D.P. Weigel N.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31034-31040Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Phenylisothiocyanate was obtained from J. T. Baker Inc. Triethylamine, 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide, and trifluoroacetic acid were obtained from Sigma. Sequelon-AA membrane was obtained from Millipore Corp. (Milford, MA). Recently, we demonstrated that Ku antigen bound on fully relaxed, covalently closed circular DNA, to a region of the LTR from the GR strain of MMTV (â397 and â375) centered over NRE1 (38Giffin W. Torrance H. Rodda D.J. Prefontaine G.G. Pope L. Hache R.G.J. Nature. 1996; 380: 265-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Furthermore, in EMSA a 23-bp oligonucleotide spanning LTR sequences â398 and â376 was sufficient for Ku binding to a microcircle (38Giffin W. Torrance H. Rodda D.J. Prefontaine G.G. Pope L. Hache R.G.J. Nature. 1996; 380: 265-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Previously, a number of other potential sequence-specific Ku binding sites had been proposed (9Falzon M.

However, these experiments could not distinguish between direct sequence-specific binding of Ku and accumulation of Ku translocated from a DNA end. Alignment of these proposed Ku binding sites with NRE1 revealed two types of DNA sequence, several examples of which are displayed in Fig. 1. First, regulatory elements flanking the murine c-myc gene (57Kakkis E. Calame K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 7031-7035Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 58Kakkis E. Riggs K.J. Gillespie W. Calame K. Nature. 1989; 339: 718-722Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) and in the LTR of human T cell leukemia virus (HTLV) (36Okumura K. Takagi S. Sakaguchi G. Naito K.

FEBS Lett. 1994; 356: 94-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) have the same overall polypurine character as NRE1 and considerable sequence identity (Fig. 1A). In the C3H strain of MMTV, there is a similar conservation over NRE1 and this region of the C3H LTR has similarly been implicated in regulating viral transcription (59Lee J.W. Moffitt P.G. Morley K.L. Peterson D.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 24101-24108Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 60Morley K.L. Toohey M.G. Peterson D.O.

A second category of potential sequence-specific Ku binding site is composed of sequences with no apparent homology to NRE1, or even to each other (Fig. 1B). This group of sequences includes the octamer motif bound by octamer transcription factors (34May G. Sutton C. Gould H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 3052-3059Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), a heat shock response element (31Kim D. Ouyang H. Yang S.-H. Nussenzweig A. Burgman P. Li G.C. J. Biol.

https://openalex.org/W1992615534,"Sphingosine, sphinganine, and other long-chain (sphingoid) bases are highly bioactive intermediates of sphingolipid metabolism that have diverse effects when added to cells, including the inhibition of protein kinase C (PKC) as evaluated by both enzymatic activity and [<sup>3</sup>H]phorbol dibutyrate ([<sup>3</sup>H]PDBu) binding. Nonetheless, changes in endogenous sphingoid bases have not been proven to affect PKC or other signal transduction pathways. We have discovered recently that changing J774A.1 cells to new medium results in up to 10-fold increases in sphingoid bases (Smith, E. R., and Merrill, A. H., Jr. (1995) <i>J. Biol. Chem.</i> 270, 18749-18758); therefore, this system was used to elevate sphingosine and sphinganine and determine if PKC was affected. Incubation of J774A.1 cells in new medium for 30 min increased the levels of these endogenous sphingoid bases to approximately 0.5 nmol/mg of protein and decreased [<sup>3</sup>H]PDBu binding by 40-60%. Addition of NH<sub>4</sub>Cl, which suppresses the change in sphingosine, restored [<sup>3</sup>H]PDBu binding. Elevation of endogenous sphinganine by a second method (addition of fumonisin B<sub>1</sub>, an inhibitor of ceramide synthase) also reduced [<sup>3</sup>H]PDBu binding; therefore, elevations in sphingosine and sphinganine can both affect PKC. The elevation in sphingoid bases was also associated with an increase in the amount of PKC-Î´ (the major PKC isozyme in J774A.1 cells) in the cytosol, as determined by activity assays and immunoblot analyses. Changing the culture medium affected other PKC isozymes, increased cellular levels of diacylglycerol, dihydroceramide, and ceramide, and altered the expression of two genes (the expression of JE was increased, and the induction of MnSOD by TNF-Î± was potentiated). Thus, changing the culture medium has numerous effects on J774A.1 cells, including the modulation of PKC by endogenous sphingoid bases."

NO covalently attacks the heme moiety of soluble guanylate cyclase, activating the enzyme, and thereby elevating intracellular cGMP concentrations (15Ignarro L.J. Degna J.N. Baricos W.H.

This increase in cGMP subsequently activates certain protein kinases, which phosphorylate target proteins involved in regulation of cell function (17Ignarro L.J. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1990; 67: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar, 18Stewart A.G. Phan L.H. Grigoriadis G. Microsurgery. 1994; 15: 693-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 19Kuo P.C.

Although the role of cGMP as a NO second messenger is undisputed, some findings have led to speculation about the existence of cGMP-independent signal transduction pathways for NO.First, NO is a free radical with the ability to react with a variety of enzymes besides soluble guanylate cyclase. NO has been shown to catalyze the covalent binding of NAD to glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (20McDonald L.J. Moss J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6238-6241Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar), oxidize iron-containing proteins such as aconitase or ribonucleotide reductase (21Drapier J.C. Hibbs Jr., J.B. J. Clin.

For example, the synthesis of tumor necrosis factor Î± (TNFÎ±), a proinflammatory cytokine implicated in tissue injury and shock (27Tracey K.J. Beutler B. Lowry S.F. Merryweather J. Wolpe S. Milsark I.W. Hariri R.J. Fahey III, T.J. Zentella A. Albert J.D. Shires G.T. Cerami A. Science. 1986; 234: 470-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (2107) Google Scholar), is increased in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (28Van Dervort A.L. Yan L. Madara P.J. Cobb P.J. Wesley R.A. Corriveau C.C. Tropea M.M. Danner R.L. J. Immunol. 1994; 152: 4102-4109PubMed Google Scholar) and lipopolysaccharide-stimulated neutrophil preparations (29Lander H.M. Sehajpal P. Levine D.M. Novogrodsky A. J. Immunol. 1993; 150: 1509-1516PubMed Google Scholar) by exogenous NO. Although NO increases cGMP concentrations in these cells, cGMP analogs have no effect on TNFÎ± production (28Van Dervort A.L. Yan L. Madara P.J. Cobb P.J. Wesley R.A. Corriveau C.C. Tropea M.M.

Collectively, these investigations suggest that NO might use cGMP-independent signaling pathways for some of its cellular functions.Recently, adenylate cyclase has been added to the list of enzymes that can be modified by NO (30Duhe R.J. Nielsen M.D. Dittman A.H. Villacres E.C. Choi E-J. Storm D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7290-7296Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Treatment of cell membranes with NO decreases cAMP production by inhibiting calmodulin activation of type I adenylate cyclase, presumably through thiol nitrosylation at the calmodulin-binding site (30Duhe R.J.

Pfeuffer T. Carafoli E. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 6081-6088Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Notably, increases in cAMP in leukocytes activate cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA). This kinase phosphorylates transcription factors that bind to the cAMP-response element on the TNFÎ± promoter, thereby inhibiting TNFÎ± mRNA transcription (32Economou J.S. Rhoades K. Essner R.

Frose R.A. Immunology. 1995; 84: 446-452PubMed Google Scholar). The effect of NO on type I adenylate cyclase suggests that NO might up-regulate TNFÎ± synthesis in human monocytes by decreasing cAMP concentrations.We investigated this question using U937 cells, a human monocytic cell line that differentiates into monocyte-macrophage-like cells and produces TNFÎ± when exposed to phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) (36SundstrÃ¶m C. Nilsson K. Int. J. Cancer. 1976; 17: 565-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (1947) Google Scholar, 37Hass R. Lonnemann G. MÃ¤nnel D. Topley N. Hartmann A. KÃ¶hler L. Resch K. Goppelt-StrÃ¼be M.

The specific objectives were as follows: 1) to demonstrate that NO up-regulates TNFÎ± production in PMA-differentiated U937 cells and test the cGMP-dependence of this effect; 2) to determine whether NO alters resting or stimulated cAMP concentrations in intact cells; 3) to investigate the effect of inhibitors or activators of PKA on NO-stimulated TNFÎ± production in this system; and 4) to determine if NO-induced changes in TNFÎ± mRNA levels were consistent with a cAMP mechanism.DISCUSSIONWe demonstrated that NO increased TNFÎ± production in PMA-differentiated U937 cells by decreasing intracellular cAMP levels, indicating that NO uses cAMP, rather than cGMP as a second messenger for some of its cellular effects. This conclusion is based on these findings: 1) two structurally dissimilar NO donors increased TNFÎ± production in a dose-dependent manner; 2) both SNP and SNAP increased cGMP concentrations in human neutrophil cultures, but had no effect on cGMP concentrations in PMA-differentiated U937 cell cultures; 3) cell-permeable analogs of cGMP, 8-bromo-cGMP and Bt2cGMP, did not alter TNFÎ± production by PMA-differentiated U937 cells; 4) SNP or SNAP not only decreased intracellular cAMP in a dose-dependent manner, but also blunted isoproterenol- and PGE2-stimulated cAMP responses in PMA-differentiated U937 cells; 5) an inhibitor of PKA, H89, increased TNFÎ± release in the absence but not in the presence of SNAP; 6) conversely, an activator of PKA, Bt2cAMP, abolished the effect of SNAP on TNFÎ± production; and 7) finally, NO donors and Bt2cAMP but not 8-bromo-cGMP caused changes in relative TNFÎ± mRNA levels that were consistent with a cAMP mechanism for the observed effects of NO. Collectively, these experiments demonstrate that NO-induced up-regulation of TNFÎ± production in this human cell line uses cAMP, not cGMP, as its second messenger.Many of the known effects of NO have been attributed to its ability to generate cGMP through its action on soluble guanylate cyclase (15Ignarro L.J. Degna J.N. Baricos W.H. Kadowitz P.J. Wolin M.S. Biochem. Biophys. Acta. 1982; 718: 49-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar, 16Craven P.A. DeRubertis F.R. J. Biol.

Grigoriadis G. Microsurgery. 1994; 15: 693-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). However, we were unable to demonstrate that NO donors increase cGMP in either naive or differentiated U937 cells. It seems unlikely that our inability to detect NO-stimulated increases in cGMP was due to degradation of cGMP. U937 cells have extremely low cGMP hydrolytic activity and do not contain the cGMP-specific PDE isoenzyme (PDE V) (45Torphy T.J. Zhou H-L. Cieslinski L.B. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1992; 263: 1195-1205PubMed Google Scholar, 46Barnette M.S. Grous M. Burman M. Cieslinski L.B. Huang L. Torphy T.J. Am. Rev. Resp. Dis. 1992; 145: A282-A283Google Scholar). Furthermore, our experiments were conducted in the presence of a potent, nonselective PDE inhibitor. These data indicate that U937 cells lack NO-sensitive soluble guanylate cyclase. Moreover, membrane permeable cGMP analogs, 8-bromo-cGMP and Bt2cGMP, were unable to mimic the effect of NO on TNFÎ± production, a finding that has also been reported in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells and neutrophil preparations (28Van Dervort A.L. Yan L. Madara P.J. Cobb P.J. Wesley R.A. Corriveau C.C. Tropea M.M. Danner R.L. J. Immunol. 1994; 152: 4102-4109PubMed Google Scholar, 29Lander H.M. Sehajpal P. Levine D.M. Novogrodsky A. J. Immunol. 1993; 150: 1509-1516PubMed Google Scholar). These results further suggest that NO regulates TNFÎ± production in PMA-differentiated U937 cells by a cGMP-independent mechanism.The ability of NO to decrease intracellular cAMP levels and blunt isoproterenol- and PGE2-stimulated cAMP responses provide direct evidence for our speculation that NO increases TNFÎ± production in PMA-differentiated U937 cells by decreasing cAMP levels. Decreases in intracellular cAMP can result either from its reduced synthesis by adenylate cyclase or from increased catabolism due to increased PDE activity (47Gill G.N. Gim W. Adv. Cyclic. Nucleotide Res. 1979; 10: 93-106PubMed Google Scholar). The result that NO decreased cAMP concentrations in the presence of IBMX, a nonspecific PDE inhibitor, support the hypothesis that changes in cAMP levels were due to decreased synthesis, rather than increased catabolism by PDE. Interestingly, cGMP can either increase cAMP hydrolysis by activating PDE II (45Torphy T.J. Zhou H-L. Cieslinski L.B. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1992; 263: 1195-1205PubMed Google Scholar, 46Barnette M.S. Grous M. Burman M. Cieslinski L.B. Huang L. Torphy T.J. Am. Rev. Resp. Dis. 1992; 145: A282-A283Google Scholar) or decrease cAMP hydrolysis by inhibiting PDE III (48Sonnebury W.K. Beavo J.A. Adv. Pharmacol. 1994; 26: 87-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 49Beavo J.A. Physiol. Rev. 1995; 75: 725-748Crossref PubMed Scopus (1634) Google Scholar). Increased or decreased cAMP hydrolysis mediated by cGMP is unlikely in our experiments since U937 cells lack PDE II activity (45Torphy T.J. Zhou H-L. Cieslinski L.B. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1992; 263: 1195-1205PubMed Google Scholar, 46Barnette M.S. Grous M. Burman M. Cieslinski L.B. Huang L. Torphy T.J. Am. Rev. Resp. Dis. 1992; 145: A282-A283Google Scholar), a PDE inhibitor was used, and as shown here, U937 cells do not produce cGMP in response to a NO signal. However, in other cell types that contain NO-sensitive soluble guanylate cyclase, the ability of NO to decrease cAMP production may be masked by decreased cAMP hydrolysis via cGMP-mediated inhibition of PDE III activity (48Sonnebury W.K. Beavo J.A. Adv. Pharmacol. 1994; 26: 87-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 49Beavo J.A. Physiol. Rev. 1995; 75: 725-748Crossref PubMed Scopus (1634) Google Scholar, 50Turner N.C. Lamb J.

Pharmacol. 1991; 17: 424-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar).As already noted, NO has been shown to inhibit calmodulin-dependent adenylate cyclase activity in isolated cell membranes by oxidizing cysteine residues at the calmodulin-binding site (30Duhe R.J. Nielsen M.D. Dittman A.H. Villacres E.C. Choi E-J. Storm D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7290-7296Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Other studies have shown that calcium ionophores potentiate cAMP responses in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells and neutrophils stimulated with isoproterenol and PGE2, and this potentiation was inhibited by calmodulin inhibitors (52Iannone M.A. Wolberg G. Zimmerman T.P. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1991; 42,: S105-S111Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 53Ishitoya J. Takenawa T. J. Immunol. 1987; 138: 1201-1207PubMed Google Scholar, 54Dooper M.W.S.M. Hoekstra Y. Timmermans A.D.E. Monchy J.G.R. Kauffman H.F. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1994; 47: 289-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). These observations indicate that the calmodulindependent adenylate cyclase subtype that is inhibited by NO is present in human leukocytes. Although this suggests a possible mechanism for NO modulation of intracellular cAMP levels, other possibilities exist. Substitution of cysteine residues for other amino acids in the Î²2-adrenergic receptor markedly shifts the dose-response curve to the right for isoproterenol-stimulated increases in intracellular cAMP concentrations (55Savarese T.M. Fraser C.M. Biochem. J. 1992; 283: 1-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar). This suggests that NO could reduce agonist-stimulated cAMP responses by decreasing receptor affinity through the nitrosylation of key cysteine-containing domains.Inhibitors and activators of PKA were used to further explore the possibility that NO was using a cAMP-dependent signaling pathway. H89, a specific cell-permeable inhibitor of PKA (56Chijiwa T. Mishima A. Hagiwara M. Sano M. Hayashi K. Inoue T. Naito K. Toshioka T. Hidaka H. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 5267-5272Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), dose-dependently increased TNFÎ± release. This finding demonstrates in PMA-differentiated U937 cells that basal cAMP levels and the resulting degree of PKA activation are inhibitory of TNFÎ± synthesis. Interestingly, H89, at the doses tested, did not further up-regulate SNAP-induced TNFÎ± production, suggesting that PKA was maximally inactivated by the decrease in cAMP levels caused by NO. In contrast, Bt2cAMP only slightly suppressed basal TNFÎ± release, but completely abolished SNAP-induced increases in TNFÎ± production. This cAMP analog can permeate cell membranes and is resistant to hydrolysis by PDE (57Postenak T. Weiman G. Methods Enzymol. 1974; 38: 399-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), enabling it to persist in cell cultures and mimic prolonged elevations of intracellular cAMP. Toxicity caused by the butyrate moiety of the Bt2cAMP molecule was unlikely to be responsible for this effect, since the concentrations of Bt2cAMP used were relatively low and Bt2cGMP (up to 1 mM), which also contains a butyrate moiety did not alter TNFÎ± production. Furthermore, cell viability by trypan blue exclusion was not decreased by Bt2cAMP. Together, these results reinforced our conclusion that NO increases TNFÎ± production in PMA-differentiated U937 cells by decreasing cAMP levels.Similarly, NO donors were also found to increase relative TNFÎ± mRNA levels and Bt2cAMP completely prevented this effect. An analog of cGMP, 8-bromo-cGMP, had no effect. These results are consistent with a cAMP mechanism acting at the level of transcription for the observed effects of NO on TNFÎ± production in PMA-differentiated U937 cells. Evidence is also available that cAMP can down-regulate TNFÎ± expression at a post-transcriptional level in monocytes and macrophages (58Kunkel S.L. Spengler M. May M.A. Spengler R. Larrick J.

Pharmacol. 1995; 48: 747-757PubMed Google Scholar).Previously, NO was demonstrated to increase TNFÎ± mRNA levels in HL-60 cells (61Magrinat G. Nickmason S. Shami P.J. Weinberg J.B. Blood. 1992; 180: 1880-1884Crossref Google Scholar), but we found no change in TNFÎ± mRNA levels in human neutrophil preparations (28Van Dervort A.L. Yan L. Madara P.J. Cobb P.J. Wesley R.A. Corriveau C.C. Tropea M.M. Danner R.L. J. Immunol. 1994; 152: 4102-4109PubMed Google Scholar). These inconsistent findings may be ascribed to the different methods employed to measure mRNA levels. In our present study, we measured TNFÎ± mRNA levels using a RPA, which may be quantitatively more reliable than the reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction assay used in our previous experiments with neutrophils (28Van Dervort A.L. Yan L. Madara P.J. Cobb P.J. Wesley R.A. Corriveau C.C. Tropea M.M. Danner R.L. J. Immunol. 1994; 152: 4102-4109PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, differentiated U937 cells may contain more copies of TNFÎ± mRNA than neutrophils. Besides the cAMP mechanism, our data do not exclude the possibility of additional mechanisms for the up-regulation of TNFÎ± production by NO. For example, NO could activate or induce other transcription factors, such as NF-ÎºB (29Lander H.M. Sehajpal P. Levine D.M. Novogrodsky A. J. Immunol. 1993; 150: 1509-1516PubMed Google Scholar).In conclusion, the present study indicates that NO increase TNFÎ± production in PMA-differentiated U937 cells by decreasing intracellular cAMP. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration in intact cells that NO signal transduction can use cAMP rather than cGMP to regulate cell function.

Med. 1995; 27: 359-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Most of these effects are mediated through a unique cGMP signaling pathway. NO covalently attacks the heme moiety of soluble guanylate cyclase, activating the enzyme, and thereby elevating intracellular cGMP concentrations (15Ignarro L.J. Degna J.N. Baricos W.H. Kadowitz P.J. Wolin M.S. Biochem. Biophys. Acta. 1982; 718: 49-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar, 16Craven P.A. DeRubertis F.R. J. Biol.

This increase in cGMP subsequently activates certain protein kinases, which phosphorylate target proteins involved in regulation of cell function (17Ignarro L.J. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1990; 67: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar, 18Stewart A.G. Phan L.H. Grigoriadis G. Microsurgery. 1994; 15: 693-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 19Kuo P.C. Schroeder R.A. Ann. Surg. 1995; 221: 220-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). Although the role of cGMP as a NO second messenger is undisputed, some findings have led to speculation about the existence of cGMP-independent signal transduction pathways for NO.First, NO is a free radical with the ability to react with a variety of enzymes besides soluble guanylate cyclase. NO has been shown to catalyze the covalent binding of NAD to glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (20McDonald L.J. Moss J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6238-6241Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar), oxidize iron-containing proteins such as aconitase or ribonucleotide reductase (21Drapier J.C. Hibbs Jr., J.B. J. Clin.

Chem. 1995; 270: 7017-7020Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). Second, some effects of NO cannot be reproduced with cell permeable cGMP analogs. For example, the synthesis of tumor necrosis factor Î± (TNFÎ±), a proinflammatory cytokine implicated in tissue injury and shock (27Tracey K.J. Beutler B. Lowry S.F. Merryweather J. Wolpe S. Milsark I.W. Hariri R.J. Fahey III, T.J. Zentella A. Albert J.D. Shires G.T. Cerami A. Science. 1986; 234: 470-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (2107) Google Scholar), is increased in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (28Van Dervort A.L. Yan L. Madara P.J. Cobb P.J. Wesley R.A. Corriveau C.C. Tropea M.M. Danner R.L. J. Immunol. 1994; 152: 4102-4109PubMed Google Scholar) and lipopolysaccharide-stimulated neutrophil preparations (29Lander H.M. Sehajpal P. Levine D.M. Novogrodsky A. J. Immunol. 1993; 150: 1509-1516PubMed Google Scholar) by exogenous NO. Although NO increases cGMP concentrations in these cells, cGMP analogs have no effect on TNFÎ± production (28Van Dervort A.L. Yan L. Madara P.J. Cobb P.J. Wesley R.A. Corriveau C.C. Tropea M.M.

Collectively, these investigations suggest that NO might use cGMP-independent signaling pathways for some of its cellular functions.Recently, adenylate cyclase has been added to the list of enzymes that can be modified by NO (30Duhe R.J. Nielsen M.D. Dittman A.H. Villacres E.C. Choi E-J. Storm D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7290-7296Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Treatment of cell membranes with NO decreases cAMP production by inhibiting calmodulin activation of type I adenylate cyclase, presumably through thiol nitrosylation at the calmodulin-binding site (30Duhe R.J.

Pfeuffer T. Carafoli E. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 6081-6088Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Notably, increases in cAMP in leukocytes activate cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA). This kinase phosphorylates transcription factors that bind to the cAMP-response element on the TNFÎ± promoter, thereby inhibiting TNFÎ± mRNA transcription (32Economou J.S. Rhoades K. Essner R.

Frose R.A. Immunology. 1995; 84: 446-452PubMed Google Scholar). The effect of NO on type I adenylate cyclase suggests that NO might up-regulate TNFÎ± synthesis in human monocytes by decreasing cAMP concentrations.We investigated this question using U937 cells, a human monocytic cell line that differentiates into monocyte-macrophage-like cells and produces TNFÎ± when exposed to phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) (36SundstrÃ¶m C.

The specific objectives were as follows: 1) to demonstrate that NO up-regulates TNFÎ± production in PMA-differentiated U937 cells and test the cGMP-dependence of this effect; 2) to determine whether NO alters resting or stimulated cAMP concentrations in intact cells; 3) to investigate the effect of inhibitors or activators of PKA on NO-stimulated TNFÎ± production in this system; and 4) to determine if NO-induced changes in TNFÎ± mRNA levels were consistent with a cAMP mechanism."

G proteins mediate numerous cellular processes by traversing a cycle of GTP binding and hydrolysis. Bound GTP activates a G protein such that it can stimulate a downstream effector protein. Activation is terminated when the bound GTP is hydrolyzed to GDP, which does not activate. Each step of the cycle is controlled, such that both steady-state GTPase activity and the concentrations of the active and inactive forms are highly regulated. Activation of heterotrimeric G proteins is promoted by seven-span cell-surface receptors that facilitate GDP release and GTP binding. Small monomeric G proteins (Ras, Rac, Rho, Arf, etc.) are activated by cytosolic proteins that similarly facilitate GTP binding. In many cases, hydrolysis of bound GTP, the deactivation step, is accelerated by GTPase-activating proteins, or GAPs 1The abbreviations used are: GAPGTPase-activating proteinPMSFphenylmethylsulfonyl fluorideDTTdithiothreitolGTPÎ³Sguanosine 5â²-O-thiotriphosphateCHAPS3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid.

GAPs appear to fulfill at least one of four definable roles. Some GAPs for monomeric signaling G proteins, such as Ras GAP, appear to attenuate G protein signal amplitude in response to inputs from inhibitory signaling pathways (1, 2, for review). GAPs for the monomeric G proteins involved in cytoplasmic vesicle trafficking are thought to act by terminating a G protein-dependent assembly or transit step. Some effector proteins that are regulated by heterotrimeric G proteins also act as GAPs for their G protein regulators. The GAP activities of these effectors, such as phospholipase C-Î² (5Berstein G.

G protein GAP activity can potentially be used to identify and purify regulators of G protein function or to point to novel inputs to G protein signaling pathways. For GAPs that are also effectors, their identification can indicate what downstream signals the G protein mediates. We began a search for new GAPs for heterotrimeric G proteins by looking for a GAP for Gz, a pertussis toxin-insensitive member of the Gi family that is abundant in brain, adrenal medulla, and platelets (16Casey P.J.

Second, Gz hydrolyzes bound GTP very slowly (16Casey P.J. Fong H.K.W. Simon M.I. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 2383-2390Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Its activation lifetime is about 7 min, which seems incompatible with normal signaling functions unless a GAP accelerates deactivation. Last, the slow hydrolytic rate simplifies design of an assay for a GAP.

GÎ±z-agarose was prepared according to Mumby et al. (28Mumby S.M. Casey P.J. Gilman A.G. Gutowski S. Sternweis P.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Methods Enzymol. 1978; 53: 222-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar), and other detergents were purchased from various suppliers. [Î³-32P]GTP was either purchased or synthesized (30Johnson R.A. Walseth T.F. Adv. Cyclic Nucleotide Res. 1979; 10: 135-168PubMed Google Scholar) and purified as described (6Biddlecome G.H. Berstein G. Ross E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7999-8007Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). [Î³-32P]GTP was bound to GÎ±z by incubating 10-50 pmol of GÎ±z for 20 min at 30Â°C in 200 Î¼l of 25 mM NaHepes (pH 7.5), 3 mM DTT, 0.1% Triton X-100, 1 mM EDTA, 2.5 Î¼M [Î³-32P]GTP (20-80 cpm/fmol), and sufficient MgCl2 to provide 1 Î¼M free Mg2+. After incubation, [Î³-32P]GTP and [32P]orthophosphate were removed by chromatography on a 2-ml column of Sephadex G25, which was run in the same buffer but without GTP or MgCl2. GÎ±z-bound [Î³-32P]GTP was determined by nitrocellulose binding assay (31Brandt D.R. Ross E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 266-272Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and was usually 25% of the total GÎ±z, with the remainder bound to GDP. Hydrolysis of GÎ±z-bound [Î³-32P]GTP in routine GAP assays was measured by incubation of the substrate (usually â¼1-2 nM) in the buffer used for its preparation but including 1 mM free Mg2+, 10 Î¼g/ml bovine albumin, and 5 mM nonradioactive GTP. Unlabeled GTP was added to inhibit nucleoside triphosphatase activity present in crude GAP fractions in the event that any [Î³-32P]GTP dissociated from GÎ±z. Assays were carried out at 15Â°C for times that varied from 30 s to 60 min. Hydrolysis of bound [Î³-32P]GTP was measured as release of [32P]orthophosphate (31Brandt D.R. Ross E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 266-272Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Hydrolysis followed a single exponential time course. Hydrolysis is expressed either as the amount of bound GTP hydrolyzed at early times (quasilinear time course) or as a first-order rate constant. 2For a GAP in rapid equilibrium with the GTP-bound form of GÎ±z and for kgap > khydrol, the scheme below predicts a single exponential time course for total GTP hydrolysis. The apparent hydrolytic rate constant, kapp, is an average of kgap and khydrol, weighted by the ratio kâ1/k1 and by the concentration of GAP. If background hydrolysis (assayed in the absence of GAP) is subtracted from total hydrolysis, then GAP activity can also be described by analogy to steady-state enzyme kinetics: GÎ±z-GTP is the substrate, Km = ((kâ1+ kgap)/k1) and, for [GAP] < [GÎ±z-GTP], Vmax = (kgap)Â·;[GAP]. GAP presumably dissociates from GÎ±z-GDP immediately after hydrolysis (Fig. 7).GÎ±z-GTPâkhydrolGÎ±z-GTP + Pik1ââkâ1GAP-GÎ±z-GTPâkgapGAP-GÎ±z-GDP + Pi(Eq. 1) GAP-independent hydrolysis is subtracted from all data except in Figs. 1, 6, and 8B.Fig. 6Effect of Mg2+ on Gz GAP activity.

The rate of hydrolysis of [Î³-32P]GTP bound to GÎ±o and GÎ±i1 was measured at 15Â°C essentially as described previously (26Higashijima T. Burnier J. Ross E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 14176-14186Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), except that the buffer for the initial [Î³-32P]GTP binding reaction contained 5 mM EDTA, and hydrolysis was initiated by adding 6.0 mM MgCl2 plus 0.1 mM unlabeled GTP. The concentration of GÎ±-bound [Î³-32P]GTP at initiation of the hydrolysis reaction is given as the total amount of [32P]orthophosphate released during the reaction. Gz GAP was purified from bovine cerebral cortical membranes prepared according to Sternweis and Pang (32Sternweis P.C. Pang I.-H. Hulme E.C. Receptor-Effector Coupling: A Practical Approach. Oxford University Press, Oxford1990: 1-30Google Scholar). All procedures were performed at 0-4Â°C except where explicitly noted. In practice, we pool active fractions from multiple runs of the Q-Sepharose column before gel filtration and pool several gel filtration peaks for GÎ±z affinity chromatography. Combining preparations in this way improves both the yield and purification. However, Table II is an example of an early preparation that was completed exactly as described below.Table IIPurification of GÎ±z GAP from bovine brainTotal proteinSpecific activityPurificationYieldmgunit/mg-fold%Triton X-100 extract13,50035(1.0)(100)DEAE-Sephacel7,500501.580Q-Sepharose1,0001303.727Ultrogel AcA-34601,0002912.5GÎ±z-agarose0.635,0001,0004.4Phenyl-Sepharose0.045280,0008,0002.7 Open table in a new tab Membranes were washed once in 50 mM Tris-Cl (pH 7.5), 1 mM DTT, 1 mM EDTA, 0.5 M NaCl, and 0.1 mM PMSF and resuspended to 2.5 mg/ml in 20 mM NaHepes (pH 7.5), 0.1 mM EDTA, 0.3 mM PMSF, and 2% Triton X-100. The suspension was sloshed for 25 min at 30Â°C and centrifuged for 40 min at 150,000 Ã g. The supernatant was loaded on a DEAE-Sephacel column (700 ml) that was equilibrated with Buffer 1 (20 mM NaHepes (pH 7.5), 0.1 mM EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1 mM PMSF). The column was washed with Buffer 1 and eluted with a gradient of 0-300 mM NaCl in Buffer 1. Both Gz GAP activity and protein were eluted in parallel as a broad, asymmetric peak. Active fractions were pooled and diluted 3-fold with Buffer 2 (20 mM NaHepes (pH 7.5), 0.1 mM EDTA, 1 mM DTT, 1% cholate, 0.1 mM PMSF). DTT was added to a final concentration of 20 mM, and the solution was applied to a column of Q-Sepharose that had been equilibrated with Buffer 2. The column was washed sequentially with Buffer 2, Buffer 2 plus 0.1 M NaCl, and Buffer 2 plus 0.25 M NaCl, and then eluted with a gradient of 0.25-0.55 M NaCl in Buffer 2. Protein and GAP activity again eluted as a broad peak. Active fractions were concentrated on an Amicon PM30 membrane and chromatographed on a column of Ultrogel AcA-34 equilibrated with Buffer 2 plus 0.1 M NaCl. A typical elution profile is shown in Fig. 2. The second peak of GAP activity was pooled and concentrated by adsorption to Mono Q and elution with a gradient of 0.1-0.55 M NaCl in Buffer 2. For affinity chromatography, pooled Mono Q fractions were diluted 20-fold with Buffer 3 (25 mM NaHepes (pH 7.5), 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM DTT, 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.25% cholate, 0.1 mM PMSF, 10 Î¼M GDP, 30 Î¼M AlCl3, 5 mM MgCl2, 10 mM NaF) and applied to a column of GÎ±z-agarose that was equilibrated with Buffer 3. The column was washed with Buffer 3 plus 25 mM NaCl, and GAP activity was eluted with a gradient of 25-500 mM NaCl in Buffer 4 (Buffer 3 but containing 0.5% cholate and without AlCl3, MgCl2, or NaF). Peak fractions were pooled, concentrated by adsorption and elution from Q Sepharose as described above, and diluted 8-fold with Buffer 5 (20 mM NaHepes (pH 7.5), 1 mM DTT, 0.1 mM EDTA, 1 M NaCl, 0.1 mM PMSF). The pool was applied to a column of phenyl-Sepharose equilibrated with Buffer 5 plus 0.2% cholate and washed with 5 volumes of the same buffer. GAP activity was eluted with a discontinuous gradient of 0.2-1.0% cholate (0.2% steps) in Buffer 5 but without NaCl (see Fig. 3). Gz GAP was co-reconstituted with GÎ±zÎ²Î³ and m2 muscarinic cholinergic receptor into unilamellar phospholipid vesicles (phosphatidylserine:phosphatidylethanolamine:cholesteryl hemisuccinate, 5:8:1) according to the method of Parker et al. (23Parker E.M. Kameyama K. Higashijima T. Ross E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 519-527Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Trimeric Gz was prepared by mixing GDP-bound GÎ±z with GÎ²1Î³2 (Î±:Î²Î³ = 0.4) before reconstitution (26Higashijima T. Burnier J. Ross E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 14176-14186Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). GÎ±z was routinely quantitated according to the binding of 10 Î¼M [35S]GTPÎ³S for 1.5 h at 30Â°C (31Brandt D.R. Ross E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 266-272Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Binding of [Î³-32P] and [Î±-32P]GTP to Gz was also measured by the nitrocellulose binding assay (31Brandt D.R. Ross E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 266-272Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Protein was measured by amido black binding (33Schaffner W. Weissmann C. Anal. Biochem. 1973; 56: 502-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (1953) Google Scholar). Standard procedures were used for SDS-gel electrophoresis (34Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207233) Google Scholar) and staining with Coomassie Blue or silver (35Wray W. Boulikas T. Wray V.P. Hancock R. Anal. Biochem. 1981; 118: 197-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (2501) Google Scholar). For samples in which GAP activity was to be measured after electrophoresis, samples were denatured in sample buffer (34Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207233) Google Scholar) that contained 1% SDS and 10 mM DTT. Gz GAP activity was extracted from slices of SDS-polyacrylamide gels and renatured by homogenizing the gel in 5-10 volumes of renaturation buffer (20 mM NaHepes (pH 7.5), 1 mM DTT, 0.1 mM EDTA, 1% Triton X-100) and shaking overnight at 0Â°C. The concentration of free Mg2+ in assay buffers that contained significant concentrations of both EDTA and GTP was calibrated as described by Huskens and Sherry (36Huskens J. Sherry A.D. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1996; 118: 4396-4404Crossref Scopus (56) Google Scholar). We used the GÎ±z-[Î³-32P]GTP complex as substrate to test for the presence of proteins that can increase the rate of hydrolysis of GÎ±z-bound GTP. Purified GÎ±z hydrolyzes bound GTP very slowly (16Casey P.J. Fong H.K.W. Simon M.I. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 2383-2390Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), such that GÎ±z-[Î³-32P]GTP can be prepared and purified with good yield. About 25% of total GÎ±z is bound to [Î³-32P]GTP after gel filtration, with the rest bound to unlabeled GDP. Under standard assay conditions at 15Â°C, GTP bound to GÎ±z is hydrolyzed with a rate constant, khydrol, of about 0.014 minâ1, which corresponds to a t1/2 of about 50 min (Fig. 1). Addition of a crude membrane fraction from bovine brain increased the rate of hydrolysis of GÎ±z-bound GTP dramatically (Fig. 1A). Hydrolysis was a single component, first-order reaction over a 10-fold range of rates, and rate constants increased linearly with increasing amounts of membrane protein (Fig. 1B). These data indicate the existence of a GTPase-accelerating activity in bovine brain, i.e. a Gz GAP. Based on the linearity of GTP hydrolysis with added membrane protein, we defined a unit of Gz GAP activity as an increment in the hydrolytic rate constant of 1.0 minâ1. Both the basal rate of GTP hydrolysis by GÎ±z and the GAP activities of several tissues were quite reproducible in this assay. The hydrolysis-accelerating activity is evidently that of a protein. In membranes, activity was destroyed by incubation with 6.7 Î¼g/ml trypsin, 20 Î¼g/ml chymotrypsin plus detergent or 0.5 mM N-ethylmaleimide. Added detergent markedly sensitized the GAP to proteolysis. Release of [32P]orthophosphate in GAP assays such as shown in Fig. 1 reflects only hydrolysis of [Î³-32P]GTP bound to GÎ±z rather than dissociation followed by hydrolysis catalyzed by other nucleoside triphosphatases in the membranes. Dissociation of GTP from GÎ±z was unmeasurably slow, as estimated either by comparing the loss of bound [Î³-32P]GTP with the appearance of [32P]orthophosphate or by monitoring the dissociation of [Î±-32P]GTP. The rate of formation of [32P]orthophosphate was equal both to the rate of loss of GÎ±z-bound [Î³-32P]GTP and to the rate of conversion of bound [Î±-32P]GTP to bound [Î±-32P]GDP (not shown), either with or without added membrane protein. Furthermore, the reaction is carried out in the presence of 5 mM free GTP to block any other nucleoside triphosphatase activity. In control experiments, no hydrolysis was observed when free [Î³-32P]GTP was substituted for GÎ±z-[Î³-32P]GTP (not shown). Homogenates of several mammalian tissues and cultured cells were screened for Gz GAP activity (Table I), and its distribution was found to be similar to that of GÎ±z itself (16-19; confirmed qualitatively by anti-Î±z immunoblot durning this study). Activity was highest in cerebral cortex, although there was considerable activity in membranes of spleen and retina. Peripheral fat, lung, platelets, and testis also displayed readily measurable activity. Several other tissues displayed low activity, which may represent contamination by adipose, neuronal, or vascular tissue or the action of other GAPs with low activity toward Gz. We do not know how many proteins in these tissues display Gz GAP activity. Among the cultured cells tested, C6 glioma cells displayed activity similar to that of brain, 20-50 units/mg depending upon the source of the cells and the culture conditions. Several other cell lines displayed more modest activities. Gz GAP activity was low in S49 murine lymphoma cells and was barely detected in Sf9 cells. Because activity was highest in brain and bovine brain is readily obtainable, we concentrated on this source and have not attempted to determine the multiplicity of Gz GAPs in other tissues.Table IDistribution of Gz GAP activityGAP activityunits/mg proteinCerebral cortex38Spleen12Retina10Fat2.1Lung1.8Platelet1Kidney, heart, liver, testis, pancreas, erythrocyte0.1-0.5Skeletal muscle0.04C6 glioma22-47CHO11Sf9, S49, Ins-10.2-0.65Other cell lines293, 8PP15, 7RP16, L, 1321N1, Cos, MDCK, NG108, MA1042.5-6.5 Open table in a new tab There is no soluble Gz GAP activity detectable in brain homogenates (<2%). Gz GAP behaves as an integral membrane protein and is difficult to solubilize. It is not extracted by washing at high or low ionic strength and is not solubilized by many detergents. At 0Â°C, neither cholate, deoxycholate, Lubrol PX, Triton X-100, CHAPS, digitonin, nor several other detergents solubilized any Gz GAP activity. Small and irreproducible amounts of activity were solubilized by dodecyl maltoside and lauroyl sucrose. Fortunately, incubation of membranes with 2% Triton X-100 at 30Â°C released considerable Gz GAP activity into a 200,000 Ã g supernatant. This apparently soluble GAP was still badly aggregated, however, and substantial increases in specific activity were not obtained by chromatography in multiple systems. Two sequential rounds of anion exchange chromatography, which included transfer from Triton X-100 to cholate, provided little purification and substantial loss of activity (Table II) but did allow subsequent purification. Although about half of the Gz GAP activity remained aggregated, the other half behaved as an apparently monodisperse species of reasonable molecular size and was thus purified about 20-fold by gel filtration in cholate (Fig. 2). This soluble material was used for further purification. After gel filtration, Gz GAP activity was appreciably purified by affinity chromatography on GÎ±z-agarose. GAP activity bound to the column when the covalently coupled GÎ±z was activated with either GTPÎ³S or with GDP/AlF4 but not when the GÎ±z was in the nonactivated, GDP-bound form (not shown). For purification, peak fractions from gel filtration were applied to Al3+/F4â-activated GÎ±z-agarose, and after extensive washing, GAP activity was eluted by removal of Al3+, Fâ, and Mg2+ and increasing the concentration of detergent and salt. Further purification of Gz GAP was achieved by phenyl-Sepharose chromatography (Fig. 3). Gz GAP activity was consistently eluted from phenyl-Sepharose in two peaks. This was true for multiple elution protocols that included increasing the concentration of detergent and/or decreasing the concentration of s"

A likely mediator of this silencing is the neuron-restrictive silencer element/repressor element 1 (NRSE/RE1), which is present 837 base pairs (bp) upstream from the transcription initiation site of the m4 mAChR gene (Wood, I. C., Roopra, A., Harrington, C., and Buckley, N. J. (1995) J. Biol. Chem. 270, 30933-30940; Mieda, M., Haga, T., and Saffen, D. W. (1996) J. Biol. Chem. 271, 5177-5182). In the present study, we examined whether this putative NRSE/RE1 functions as a silencer. Transient expression assays using m4 mAChR promoter/luciferase expression vectors showed that the m4 NRSE/RE1 is necessary and sufficient to repress m4 promoter activity in non-neuronal L6 cells. m4 promoter activity was only partially repressed, however, in neuronal NG108-15 cells exogenously expressing the neuronal-restrictive silencer factor/RE1-silencing transcription factor (NRSF/REST). By contrast, the promoter activity of the type II sodium channel (NaII) gene was nearly completely repressed in NRSF/REST-expressing NG108-15 cells. Experiments with expression vectors containing chimeric promoters revealed that the NRSE/RE1 elements derived from both the m4 and NaII genes are independently sufficient to silence NaII gene promoter activity, but only partially repress m4 mAChR gene promoter activity in NRSF/REST-expressing NG108-15 cells. Thus, the repression activity of NRSF/REST depends upon the species of promoter to which it is linked. Gel-shift assays showed that the NRSF/REST is the only protein that binds to a 92-bp segment from the m4 mAChR promoter containing NRSE/RE1. This and the fact that m4 promoter activity was completely repressed in L6 cells suggest that the proteins that bind to the m4 constitutive promoter may be different from those in NG108-15 cells. Deletion analysis of the m4 constitutive promoter revealed that a 90-bp segment immediately upstream from the transcription initiation site contains significant promoter activity. Gel-shift assays revealed that several proteins in nuclear extracts prepared from L6 and NG108-15 cells bind to this 90-bp segment and that some of these proteins are L6 or NG108-15 cell-specific.

https://openalex.org/W2036276321,"We have isolated a 27-kDa protein that binds to cytoplasmic dynein. Microsequencing of a 17-amino acid peptide of this polypeptide yielded a sequence which completely matched the predicted sequence of the Î² subunit of casein kinase II, a highly conserved serine/threonine kinase. Affinity chromatography using a dynein column indicates that both the Î± and Î² subunits of casein kinase II are retained by the column from rat brain cytosol. Although dynactin is also bound to the column, casein kinase II is not a dynactin subunit. Casein kinase II does not co-immunoprecipitate with dynactin, and it binds to a dynein intermediate chain column which has been preblocked with excess p150<sup>Glued</sup>, a treatment that inhibits the binding of dynactin from cytosol. Bacterially expressed and purified rat dynein intermediate chain can be phosphorylated by casein kinase II <i>in vitro</i>. Further, native cytoplasmic dynein purified from rat brain can also be phosphorylated by casein kinase II <i>in vitro</i>. We propose that CKII may be involved in the regulation of dynein function possibly by altering its cargo specificity or its ability to interact with dynactin."
https://openalex.org/W2031620010,"The N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) subtype of glutamate receptor plays important roles in synaptic plasticity, the induction of long term potentiation, and excitotoxicity. Mechanisms governing the regulation of expression of its subunit genes remain largely unknown. The promoter of the essential subunit of the NMDA receptor heteromer, NMDAR1, contains DNA binding elements recognized by the nerve growth factor-inducible/early growth reaction factor (NGFI/Egr) family of transcription factors that are rapidly induced by neurotrophins, such as nerve growth factor (NGF). This study examined the effect of NGF on the activity of the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor subunit 1 (NMDAR1) promoter/luciferase reporter constructs in PC12 cells, which contain the high affinity TrkA receptor for NGF and the low affinity p75NTR receptor for neurotrophins. NGF up-regulated the activity of the NMDAR1 promoter by 3-4-fold in a time- and dose-dependent manner. 5â² deletional analysis of the promoter indicated that the responsive element(s) resides in the proximal region containing GSG and Sp1 sites. Mutational analysis of these sites revealed that both were important for NGF regulation. Transient expression of Egr-1 increased activity of the wild type promoter but failed to increase activity of a GSG mutant promoter. Other neurotrophins did not activate the promoter, while K-252a inhibited the action of NGF. These results suggest that the NGF effect is mediated by the high affinity NGF receptor, Trk A and that neurotrophin binding to the low affinity neurotrophin receptor, p75NTR, alone does not affect the promoter activity. Our results suggest that NGF is able to up-regulate the activity of the NMDAR1 promoter and may play a role in controlling the expression levels of NMDA receptors. The N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) subtype of glutamate receptor plays important roles in synaptic plasticity, the induction of long term potentiation, and excitotoxicity. Mechanisms governing the regulation of expression of its subunit genes remain largely unknown. The promoter of the essential subunit of the NMDA receptor heteromer, NMDAR1, contains DNA binding elements recognized by the nerve growth factor-inducible/early growth reaction factor (NGFI/Egr) family of transcription factors that are rapidly induced by neurotrophins, such as nerve growth factor (NGF). This study examined the effect of NGF on the activity of the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor subunit 1 (NMDAR1) promoter/luciferase reporter constructs in PC12 cells, which contain the high affinity TrkA receptor for NGF and the low affinity p75NTR receptor for neurotrophins. NGF up-regulated the activity of the NMDAR1 promoter by 3-4-fold in a time- and dose-dependent manner. 5â² deletional analysis of the promoter indicated that the responsive element(s) resides in the proximal region containing GSG and Sp1 sites. Mutational analysis of these sites revealed that both were important for NGF regulation. Transient expression of Egr-1 increased activity of the wild type promoter but failed to increase activity of a GSG mutant promoter. Other neurotrophins did not activate the promoter, while K-252a inhibited the action of NGF. These results suggest that the NGF effect is mediated by the high affinity NGF receptor, Trk A and that neurotrophin binding to the low affinity neurotrophin receptor, p75NTR, alone does not affect the promoter activity. Our results suggest that NGF is able to up-regulate the activity of the NMDAR1 promoter and may play a role in controlling the expression levels of NMDA receptors."

INTRODUCTIONDuring development of many organisms, protein kinases function in signaling pathways important for proper morphogenesis and cell fate determination. Their activity can either be stimulatory, such as that of Sevenless receptor kinase (reviewed in Ref. 1Simon M.A. Dev. Biol. 1994; 166: 431-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), or inhibitory, as exemplified by the inactivation of cAMP-dependent protein kinase through the Hedgehog cascade (reviewed in Ref. 2Perrimon N. Cell. 1995; 80: 517-520Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Therefore, to understand the basic cellular processes involved during development requires knowledge of how the relevant kinase(s) is regulated, as well as how its target substrates are affected by phosphorylation.The TSL gene was identified by mutational analysis in Arabidopsis thaliana as a gene required for proper development of the flower and the margins of the leaf (3Roe J.L. Rivin C.J. Sessions R.A. Feldmann K.A. Zambryski P.C. Cell. 1993; 75: 939-950Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). tsl loss of function mutations are recessive and cause a phenotype characterized by two major floral defects. First, there is a stochastic decrease in the number of floral organs, implying that TSL functions at an early stage during flower formation, perhaps regulating the establishment of organ primordia by promoting specific cell divisions within the floral meristem. Second, specific regions of the ovule-housing organ, the gynoecium, fail to develop properly suggesting that TSL also may function to pattern developmental programs within an organ type (3Roe J.L. Rivin C.J. Sessions R.A. Feldmann K.A. Zambryski P.C. Cell. 1993; 75: 939-950Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). 1Roe, J. L., Nemhauser, J. L., and Zambryski, P. C. (1997) Plant Cell, in press.TSL encodes a 688-amino acid protein (TSL) which is a putative serine/threonine protein kinase with a COOH-terminal catalytic domain (amino acids 409-688) and an NH2-terminal domain (amino acids 1-408) of unknown function (3Roe J.L. Rivin C.J. Sessions R.A. Feldmann K.A. Zambryski P.C. Cell. 1993; 75: 939-950Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Recent data base searches suggest that TSL is a member of an evolutionarily conserved protein kinase subfamily with closely-related homologs found in Caenorhabditis elegans, Caenorhabditis briggsae, humans, and maize. 2J. L. Roe, unpublished observation. The presence of TSL homologs in both plant and animal kingdoms implies the protein performs a fundamental function. Consistent with this hypothesis, TSL is expressed in all organs of the plant (3Roe J.L. Rivin C.J. Sessions R.A. Feldmann K.A. Zambryski P.C. Cell. 1993; 75: 939-950Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar).The utilization of the same signaling components in multiple developmental pathways is emerging as a common theme in many organsims (1Simon M.A. Dev. Biol. 1994; 166: 431-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 4Siegfried E. Perrimon N. BioEssays. 1994; 16: 395-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 5Hammerschmidt M. Bitgood M.J.

Perrimon N. Dev. Biol. 1994; 166: 380-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). The requirement for TSL function at several stages of development suggests that this putative protein kinase is regulated in response to different unidentified developmental cues. The TSL NH2-terminal domain contains sequence motifs, such as a coiled-coil region and three consensus nuclear localization signal (NLS) 3The abbreviations used are:NLSnuclear localization signalGSTglutathione S-transferasePAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresisPipes1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acidMBPmyelin basic proteinGUSÎ²-glucuronidaseDBDDNA-binding domain. sequences, which together could participate in modulating the activity of the COOH-terminal catalytic domain. The existence of multiple NLS sequences in the NH2-terminal domain may direct the subcellular localization of the protein, permitting access to potential regulatory factors and target substrates. The coiled-coil region, including a leucine-zipper motif, may participate in protein-protein interactions that affect kinase activity. Such interactions could include the formation of TSL oligomers. The ligand-binding induced dimerization of receptor protein kinases is known to be critical for kinase activation (8Heldin C.-H. Cell. 1995; 80: 213-223Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1427) Google Scholar, 9Ullrich A. Schlessinger J. Cell. 1990; 61: 203-212Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4581) Google Scholar). However, oligomerization has only recently been found to provide a possible means of regulation of non-receptor protein kinases (10Farrar M.A. Alberola-Ila J. Perlmutter R.M. Nature. 1996; 383: 178-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar, 11Luo Z. Tzivion G. Belshaw P.J. Vavvas D. Marshall M. Avruch J. Nature. 1996; 383: 181-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar).To begin to understand the basic properties of the TSL protein kinase and its regulation, we have isolated catalytically active TSL from yeast and characterized that activity in vitro. In this report, we show that TSL is a nuclear serine/threonine protein kinase and is capable of autophosphorylation in trans. The TSL NH2-terminal domain also is shown to mediate oligomerization in the two-hybrid system. Deletion mutants, analyzed for both their enzymatic activity in vitro and ability to oligomerize in the two-hybrid system, indicate that TSL requires self-association for protein kinase activity.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESStrainsEscherichia coli DH5 (Fâ, recA1, endA1, hsdR17, supE44, thi1, gyrA, relA1) was the recipient for all plasmid transformations.

(14Bowman S. Tischfield J.A. Stambrook P.J. Technique, J. Methods Cell Mol. Biol. 1990; 2: 254-260Google Scholar). The fragment was subcloned into pBluescriptSK+ at the EcoRI site to generate pTK2E. This plasmid was subsequently used to exchange the mutant fragment with wild-type fragments in the precursor plasmids where appropriate.GST Fusion PlasmidsYEpLG-GST 4C. Inouye and J.

It also contains the coding sequence for GST under GAL1 control followed by a polylinker. TSL sequences from precursor plasmids were subcloned into the polylinker region of YEpLG-GST such that the TSL coding sequences were in-frame with GST (details will be provided upon request).Two-hybrid ContructsTSL sequences from the precursor plasmids described above were subcloned into the two-hybrid vectors pAS1 (12Durfee T.

Gottschling, unpublished data. containing a translation start followed by a 6x Myc-epitope tag and polylinker, into the plant expression vector, pART7 (16Gleave A.P. Plant Mol. Biol. 1992; 20: 1203-1207Crossref PubMed Scopus (860) Google Scholar). The sequence for full-length TSL was introduced into pA6M to create pA6M/TSL.2 (for this subcloning only, the sequence at the translational start site of TSL was changed to introduce an NcoI site, resulting in a serine to alanine change at the second residue in TSL to create TSL.2). Deletion mutants were introduced into pA6M by excising appropriate restriction fragments from precursor plasmids and ligating to pA6M.GUS Expression PlasmidspRTL2GUS, an expression plasmid containing the GUS reporter gene under the control of the CaMV35S promoter has been described (17Restrepo M.A. Freed D.D.

For galactose inductions, transformants were grown overnight in 10 ml of SC media lacking leucine and containing 2% raffinose and 0.2% sucrose. 10 ml of fresh media was added and cells grown an additional 4 h. Galactose was added to 2% and cells grown another 4 h. Cells were pelleted by centrifugation and resuspended in lysis 250 buffer (50 mM Tris (pH 7.4), 250 mM NaCl, 5 mM EDTA, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 50 mM sodium fluoride, supplemented with phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (100 Î¼g/ml), aprotinin (2 Î¼g/ml), leupeptin (2 Î¼g/ml), pepstatin A (1 Î¼g/ml), dithiothreitol (1 mM), and benzamidine (1 mM)) prior to freezing. Glass beads were added to thawed samples and cells lysed by vortexing. Extracts were cleared by centrifugation (14,000 Ã g for 20 min at 4Â°C) and protein concentration of supernatants estimated by OD280. Equal protein amounts were mixed with glutathione-agarose beads (Sigma) for 1 h at 4Â°C. Bound fractions were washed extensively with lysis 250 buffer. For all purifications, a ratio of 1 mg of protein extract/100 Î¼l bed volume of glutathione-agarose beads was used.Western Blot AnalysisBound GST fusion proteins from equivalent aliquots of glutathione-agarose beads (10-Î¼l bed volume) purified as above were eluted by boiling in Laemmli sample buffer and separated by SDS-PAGE (19Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206024) Google Scholar). For Western blots in Figs. 2A and 5A, the entire sample was loaded, and in Fig. 7A, one-half volume of eluted proteins was loaded. Gels were transferred to Immobilon-P and immunoblots were performed using rabbit anti-GST polyclonal antiserum, horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (Bio-Rad), and detection with enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham). Blots were treated with Western blocking buffer (50 mM Tris, pH 7.6, 150 mM NaCl, 0.05% Tween-20, 3% non-fat dry milk) for at least an hour, incubated overnight in primary antibody (1:1000) at 4Â°C, washed 3 times 20 min each at room temperature, incubated 1 h in secondary antibody (1:3000), washed 3 times 20 min each. All incubations and washes were performed in Western blocking buffer. After the final wash, blots were rinsed in Western blocking buffer without milk and subjected to chemiluminescent detection.Fig. 5Protein kinase activity of TSL deletion mutants correlates with their ability to oligomerize.

Laemmli sample buffer was added, samples were boiled for 3 min, centrifuged, and the supernatant was analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Kinase assays in Fig. 7B were washed in kinase buffer after the reaction prior to elution in Laemmli sample buffer. In kinase assays in Fig. 2, B and D, and Fig. 5B, the entire reaction was loaded, whereas in Fig. 7B, one-fourth volume of the reaction was loaded.Phosphoamino Acid AnalysisAliquots of purified GST-TSL were allowed to autophosphorylate as described above. Pellets were washed once in kinase buffer, samples were boiled after addition of Laemmli sample buffer and electrophoresed on an SDS-polyacrylamide gel. The portion of the gel containing the phosphorylated protein was transferred to Immobilon-P (Amersham) by electroblotting. The 32P-containing portion of the membrane was excised, and the sample was hydrolyzed by incubating the membrane in 6 N HCl for 1 h at 100Â°C (20Kamps M.P. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 201: 21-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). The supernatant was dried, redried twice after resuspension in H2O, and analyzed by TLC and autoradiography by the method of Cooper et al. (21Cooper J.A. Sefton B.M. Hunter T.

Y153 transformants were grown in 3 ml of SC media lacking tryptophan and leucine to OD600 1.0-1.5. Cells were then prepared and permeabilized as described (22Guarente L. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 101: 181-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (871) Google Scholar), except cell pellets were resuspended in 900 Î¼l of H buffer (100 mM HEPES, 150 mM NaCl, 2 mM MgCl2, 1% bovine serum albumin, pH 7.0) and 100 Î¼l of 50 mM chlorophenyl red-Î²-D-galactopyranoside was added following permeabilization.

Cell. 1992; 68: 109-118Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar) supplemented with 0.4% mannitol for 16-24 h. For immunofluoresence staining, cells were fixed with 3.7% (w/v) formaldehyde in fixation buffer (100 mM Pipes (pH 6.9), 10 mM EGTA, 5 mM MgSO4, 10% Me2SO, 100 Î¼g/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) for 45 min at room temperature. Fixed cells were permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100 in fixation buffer for 5 min. All antibody and washing steps were performed in blocking buffer (0.1 M Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.15 M NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20, 5% (w/v) dry milk). Myc epitope-tagged proteins were detected using the monoclonal antibody, 9E10 (BAbCO), and a goat anti-mouse fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated secondary antibody (Calbiochem). Cells were resuspended in Citifluor (Ted Pella, Inc.) prior to visualization. Digital images of fluorescein isothiocyanate or 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole fluorescence, or of Normarski differential interference contrast, were obtained using a Zeiss Axiophot fluoresence microscope with a CCD camera. GUS staining was performed as described previously (24Howard E.A. Zupan J.R. Citovsky V. Zambryski P.C. Cell. 1992; 68: 109-118Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). When color developed, cells were photographed by bright-field illumination on a Zeiss Axiophot.DISCUSSIONThe loss of TSL gene function results in a mutant phenotype affecting both leaf and flower morphology, and TSL appears to function during both early and late stages of flower development (3Roe J.L. Rivin C.J. Sessions R.A. Feldmann K.A. Zambryski P.C. Cell. 1993; 75: 939-950Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). These results suggest that the TSL gene product participates in a commonly used developmental pathway. Sequence analysis predicted TSL to be a serine/threonine protein kinase composed of a carboxyl-terminal catalytic domain and a large amino-terminal regulatory domain. We have shown here that TSL is indeed a protein kinase which autophosphorylates on both serine and threonine residues. That a kinase-dead mutant can serve as a substrate for the wild-type protein demonstrates that some, if not all, sites are phosphorylated in trans. Furthermore, TSL can phosphorylate exogenous substrates such as MBP and casein in vitro.TSL function presumably is tightly controlled during Arabidopsis development. We have shown that the TSL NH2-terminal domain contributes at least two regulatory activities to the protein. First, this domain contains three NLS sequences, at least one of which appears to be functional in targeting TSL to the plant cell nucleus. Deletion of the first two NLS consensus sequences results in a cytoplasmically localized protein, suggesting that one or both of these NLS sequences are essential for nuclear localization. The third NLS is not sufficient for nuclear targeting. Catalytic activity is not required for the nuclear localizing function as the NH2-terminal domain alone efficiently targets a heterologous protein to the plant cell nucleus. Reciprocally, the deletion mutant ÎN171 is not nuclear-localized, but is catalytically active in vitro, suggesting that nuclear localization is not required for catalytic activity.The second regulatory function of the NH2-terminal domain is to mediate TSL oligomerization. Deletions studies indicate that at least the first Î±-helical segment of the coiled-coil region is critical for TSL oligomerization. The leucine-zipper motif found in the second Î±-helical segment is not sufficient for oligomerization, and its contribution to TSL function is not yet clear. Importantly, deletion mutants revealed a strict correlation between oligomerization in the two-hybrid system and the ability to both autophosphorylate and transphosphorylate exogenous substrates in vitro. That the catalytic domain of TSL alone is inactive indicates that the NH2-terminal domain must positively regulate the protein. Together, these data strongly suggest that oligomerization of TSL is required for activation of the catalytic domain. Although this interaction likely is due to direct binding of TSL molecules, it is possible that a cofactor present in the yeast cell mediates this apparent self-interaction.The kinase-dead K438E mutant can interact with itself and wild-type TSL, demonstrating that catalytic activity is not required for oligomerization. Based on values obtained for activation of the reporter gene in the two-hybrid assay, K438E apparently interacts with wild-type TSL more strongly than either protein interacts with itself. Perhaps this heterotypic combination represents an intermediate state where autophosphorylation of only one molecule in a complex has occurred and this intermediate is more stable. Functionally, it is not yet known whether a heterotypic complex is catalytically active. If not, the K438E mutant would be expected to exert a dominant negative effect when expressed in wild-type plants. In contrast, the NH2-terminal domain alone (NTÎN73) cannot interact with near full-length TSL containing the catalytic domain (ÎN73) and therefore, presumably will not function as a dominant-negative mutation. Experiments are underway to test these hypotheses.Ligand-mediated dimerization is generally required for activation of receptor protein kinases (reviewed in Refs. 8Heldin C.-H. Cell. 1995; 80: 213-223Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1427) Google Scholar and 9Ullrich A. Schlessinger J. Cell. 1990; 61: 203-212Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4581) Google Scholar). However, oligomerization is not a common mechanism of regulation for a non-receptor kinase, such as TSL. Recent results suggest that oligomerization plays a role in Raf-1 kinase activation (10Farrar M.A. Alberola-Ila J. Perlmutter R.M.

Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 9387-9395Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), have been shown to exist as dimers, although the functional relevance of dimerization is not clear. Studies with double-stranded RNA-dependent protein kinase deletion mutants demonstrated that the catalytic domain alone, although unable to dimerize, was fully active in vivo (40Wu S. Kaufman R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1756-1763Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). In the case of the cGMP-dependent protein kinases isoforms, it is not known if dimerization is required for catalytic activity. Finally, the crystal structure of the regulatory domain of Lck, a Src family member, revealed that this domain dimerized, but again, it is unknown whether dimerization plays a role in regulating kinase activity (41Eck M.J. Atwell S.K. Shoelson S.E. Harrison S.C. Nature. 1994; 368: 764-769Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar).The apparent dependence of TSL catalytic activity on oligomerization argues that TSL self-association via the NH2-terminal domain transmits a conformational change to the catalytic domain, analogous to the effect of dimerization on receptor tyrosine kinases (reviewed in Ref. 9Ullrich A. Schlessinger J. Cell. 1990; 61: 203-212Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4581) Google Scholar). Dimerization per se is insufficient for activation, as GST can dimerize (42Walker J. Crowley P. Moreman A.D. Barrett J. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1993; 61: 255-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), and therefore, even the catalytically inactive GST-TSL deletion mutants may exist as dimers. TSL self-association mediated by its coiled-coil region, then, may not act merely to bring the catalytic domains into proximity with one another, but instead may cause the protein to adopt a highly specific structure. This conformational change may either allow the catalytic domain to take on a fully active structure, or permit an intermediate that allows one TSL molecule to activate another via trans-autophosphorylation. This is in contrast to other examples where activation of a protein kinase can be induced by fusion to a heterologous dimerization domain (Refs. 10Farrar M.A. Alberola-Ila J. Perlmutter R.M. Nature. 1996; 383: 178-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar and 11Luo Z. Tzivion G. Belshaw P.J. Vavvas D. Marshall M. Avruch J. Nature. 1996; 383: 181-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar, and reviewed in Ref. 8Heldin C.-H.

Chem. 1996; 271: 15353-15357Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). However, we cannot exclude the possibility that TSL activation requires complexes larger than dimers, and thus dimerization via GST might be insufficient for activation.How, then, might TSL oligomerization be controlled? Two obvious possibilities exist. First, the protein may spontaneously form oligomers with a subsequent modification(s) serving as the rate-limiting step for kinase activation. Second, the protein could normally adopt a structure that is unable to oligomerize. An activating event, such as ligand-binding or phosphorylation of a critical residue(s), would then occur to allow TSL self-ass"

Whereas it is established that the C-terminal folding domain binds to Î±2MR/LRP, it remains uncertain whether it binds to heparin and to HSPG. To identify segments important for binding to Î±2MR/LRP and to clarify possible binding to heparin, we produced constructs of the human C-terminal folding domain, LpL-(313-448), and of the fragment LpL-(347-448) in Escherichia coli. In addition to binding to Î±2MR/LRP, LpL-(313-448) displayed binding to heparin with an affinity similar to that of the LpL monomer, whereas it bound poorly to lipoprotein particles. Moreover, LpL-(313-448) displayed heparin sensitive binding to normal, but not to HSPG deficient Chinese hamster ovary cells. LpL-(313-448) and LpL-(347-448) showed similar affinities for binding to both purified Î±2MR/LRP and to heparin.

Recent results provide evidence that the uptake via Î±2MR/LRP occurs in vivo, since remnant lipoproteins accumulate in mice that express reduced amounts of Î±2MR/LRP and also lack functional LDL receptors (5Willnow T.E.

It has been suggested that the LpL-mediated pathway may be particularly important in the vascular wall, since Î±2MR/LRP is abundant in macrophages and smooth muscle cells of atherosclerotic lesions and since LpL is secreted by macrophages in the lesions (6Luoma J.

LpL binds to cell surface heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPG) as reflected in its strong affinity for binding to heparin. This property is physiologically important for the docking on endothelial cells exposing the lipase to circulating lipoproteins. LpL also binds to HSPG of other cell types as recently shown directly by immunofluorescence studies (8Fernandez Borja M. Bellido D. Makiya R. David G. Olivecrona G. Reina M. VilarÃ³ S. Cell Motil.

In addition, the docking of LpL on HSPG of cells rich in Î±2MR/LRP is important for uptake of LpL and for LpL-mediated uptake of lipoproteins via this receptor (4Krapp A. Ahle S. Kersting S. Hua Y.

LpL is a member of the mammalian lipase family also comprising the homologous hepatic and pancreatic lipases. The crystallographic structure of pancreatic lipase (12Winkler F.K. D'Arcy A. Hunziker W. Nature. 1990; 343: 771-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (1024) Google Scholar) shows that it consists of two folding domains, a larger N-terminal and a smaller C-terminal domain. Based upon the similarities in sequence it is thought that the domain organization is similar for LpL, and a three-dimensional model was recently proposed (13van Tilbeurgh H. Roussel A. Lalouel J.-M. Cambillau C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4626-4633Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). LpL circulates both as a 96-kDa homodimer, which is the normally secreted and catalytically active form, and as a catalytically inactive monomer (14Osborne J.C. Bengtsson-Olivecrona G. Lee N.S.

Although not known, it is likely that the LpL dimer is arranged head-to-tail in a way that allows enough space for conformational changes following substrate binding (13van Tilbeurgh H. Roussel A. Lalouel J.-M. Cambillau C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4626-4633Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The dimeric structure of LpL causes an increase in the affinity for heparin, presumably because sites in both monomers can participate in binding of one heparin molecule (13van Tilbeurgh H. Roussel A. Lalouel J.-M. Cambillau C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4626-4633Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and helps efficient Î±2MR/LRP-mediated lipoprotein uptake, possibly because only the dimer can bind to a lipoprotein particle and to the receptor at the same time (10NykjÃ¦r A.

Lipidol. 1994; 5: 117-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). The C-terminal folding domain of the human lipase, comprising residues 313-448, is important for binding to Î±2MR/LRP and also participates in binding to lipoprotein particles and to heparin. Thus, it is known that sequences within aa 378-423 largely account for the affinity to Î±2MR/LRP (11NykjÃ¦r A. Nielsen M. Lookene A. Meyer M. RÃ¸igaard H. Etzerodt M. Beisiegel U. Olivecrona G. Gliemann J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31747-31755Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The presence of a secondary lipid binding site in the C-terminal folding domain is strongly suggested by the finding that truncation of LpL at residue 390, which does not disrupt the dimeric structure, abolishes binding to particles such as chylomicrons (19Lookene A. Bengtsson-Olivecrona G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 213: 185-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) and rabbit Î²-VLDL (10NykjÃ¦r A. Bengtsson-Olivecrona G. Lookene A. Moestrup S.K. Petersen C.M.

In addition, LpL-(313-448) has been reported to mediate binding of lipoproteins to Î±2MR/LRP (20Williams S.E. Inoue I. Tran H. Fry G.L. Pladet M.W. Iverius P.-H. Lalouel J.-M. Chappell D.A. Strickland D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8653-8658Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Mutational studies have suggested that the secondary lipid binding site includes the tryptophan residues 390 and 393 (17Krapp A. Zhang H. Ginzinger D. Liu M.S. Lindberg A. Olivecrona G. Hayden M.R. Beisiegel U. J. Lipid Res. 1995; 36: 2362-2373Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Williams S.E. Inoue I. Tran H. Fry G.L. Pladet M.W. Iverius P.-H. Lalouel J.-M. Chappell D.A. Strickland D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8653-8658Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Previous results concerning heparin binding affinity of the C-terminal domain have been ambiguous. Studies including LpL-hepatic lipase chimeras strongly suggest that the C-terminal folding domain has a site for binding of heparin (21Davis R.C. Wong H. Nikazy J. Wang K. Han Q. Schotz M.C. J. Biol.

Lalouel J.-M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8447-8457Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This is in accordance with the result that heparin abolishes binding of a C-terminal LpL fragment (residues 378-423) to Î±2MR/LRP, which itself does not bind heparin. Earlier studies of mutated LpL species have shown that candidate segments comprising residues 390-393 and 439-448 appear not to contribute to the heparin affinity (16Ma Y. Henderson H.E. Liu M.S. Zhang H. Forsythe I.J. Clarke Lewis I. Hayden M.R. Brunzell J.D. J. Lipid Res. 1994; 35: 2049-2059Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Finally, the result that dimeric LpL-(1-390) and LpL-(1-448) are eluted at the same salt concentrations following heparin affinity chromatography (19Lookene A. Bengtsson-Olivecrona G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 213: 185-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) may be taken as an argument against a separate functional heparin binding site in the C-terminal folding domain. The purpose of the present work was to identify segments important for the receptor recognition of the C-terminal folding domain, to clarify whether the domain binds to lipoproteins, and to characterize possible binding to heparin and to HSPG. We report that the C-terminal folding domain binds poorly to lipoproteins, whereas the domain does bind to heparin and to cellular HSPG. Moreover, we provide evidence that two segments are important for binding to the receptor, one of them overlapping with the heparin binding domain.

The construct H6FX-LpL-(347-448), containing the hexahistidine-factor X substrate sequence MGSH6SIEGR and aa 347-448 of human LpL, was prepared as described by Nielsen et al. (24Nielsen M.S.

This and other constructs containing human LpL sequences are referred to as LpL constructs. H6FX-LpL-(313-448) was generated in the same way, except that the primer 5â²-CAGGATCCATCGAGGGTAGGGTCTTCCATTACCAAGTA-3â² was used for the N-terminal. The mutated H6FX-LpL-(347-448) constructs were generated using full-length human LpL cDNAs containing different point mutations and deletions generated as described previously (16Ma Y. Henderson H.E.

All LpL fragment constructs were cDNA-sequenced to eliminate possible PCR errors. The recombinant C-terminal folding domain construct, H6FX-LpL-(313-448), and the recombinant wild-type and mutated LpL fragment constructs were expressed in Escherichia coli DH1 cells and purified on a Ni2+ nitriloacetic acid column (11NykjÃ¦r A.

The recombinant proteins were more than 95% pure, as judged from Coomassie Brilliant Blue-stained SDS-polyacrylamide gels, and were generally soluble in concentrations up to 20-50 Î¼M in aqueous buffer. The H6FX-LpL-(313-448) construct, referred to as LpL-(313-448), was 125I-iodinated to a specific activity of about 4 Ã 106 Bq/mol using chloramine T as the oxidizing agent (11NykjÃ¦r A. Nielsen M.

Î±2MR/LRP was immobilized in Maxisorp, and bLpL and recombinant LpL fragments were immobilized in Polysorp microtiter wells (both from NUNC, Denmark) by incubation for 2 h at 20Â°C in 50 mM NaHCO3, pH 9.6, as described previously (10NykjÃ¦r A.

Separate experiments showed that the bLpL was catalytically inactive after immobilization to the wells, 2A. Lookene and G. Olivecrona, unpublished observation. and the immobilized lipase is therefore thought to be in monomeric form. After washing, the wells were blocked in 5% bovine serum albumin when using 125I-Î±2MR/LRP or 125I-LpL-(313-448), and with 2% Tween 20 when using [3H]tinzaparin. All incubations in microtiter wells were performed for 16 h at 4Â°C in 100 Î¼l of 140 mM NaCl, 10 mM Hepes, 2 mM CaCl2, 1% bovine serum albumin, pH 7.8. Following washing with 2 Ã 200 Î¼l of incubation buffer, bound radioactivity was removed with 10% SDS and counted. Competition-inhibition curves were drawn as the best least square fit to triplicate determinations using the equation b/f = R/(Ki+ F), where b/f is the ratio of bound and free labeled ligand, R is the concentration of binding sites immobilized in the well, and F is the concentration of free competitor. COS-1 cells (American Type Culture Collection CRL 1650) were incubated in monolayers (about 3 Ã 105 cells/ml) as described previously (24Nielsen M.S. Nykjaer A. Warshawsky I. Schwartz A.L.

After incubation for 4 h at 37Â°C, degradation of 125I-Î²-VLDL was assessed by measuring radioactivity in the medium soluble in 12% trichloroacetic acid. After washing, the cells were lysed in 1 M NaOH and assayed for cell-associated radioactivity. Normal human skin fibroblasts were obtained as described previously (8Fernandez Borja M. Bellido D. Makiya R. David G. Olivecrona G. Reina M. VilarÃ³ S. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1995; 30: 89-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) and cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal calf serum containing glutamine (2 mM), penicillin, and streptomycin. Wild-type and mutant (CHO-745) Chinese hamster ovary cells lacking heparan sulfate and chrondroitin sulfate glycosaminoglycans (28Esko J.D. Rostand K.S. Weinke J.L. Science. 1988; 241: 1092-1096Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar) were kindly provided by Dr. J. D. Esko, Department of Biochemistry, University of Alabama at Birmingham. The CHO cells were grown in Ham's F-12 culture medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, glutamine, and antibiotics. Cells were plated on glass coverslips for immunofluorescence experiments and used between the 3rd and 4th day of seeding. The binding of bLpL (2.5 Î¼g/ml) or LpL(313-448) (25 Î¼g/ml) to fibroblasts and CHO cells was performed by incubating prechilled cells for 30 min at 4Â°C in Dulbecco' modified Eagle's medium containing 20 mM Hepes (pH 7.4) and 1% defatted bovine serum albumin. The cells were then fixed for 15 min at room temperature in 3% paraformaldehyde, 2% sucrose, 0.1 mM phosphate buffer, pH 7.4. After rinsing twice in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, 10 mM phosphate, 150 mM NaCl, pH 7.4) containing 20 mM glycine, the fixed cells were blocked with PBS-glycine containing 1% bovine serum albumin. As a primary antibody, we used the monoclonal antibody 5D2 (Oncogene) at dilution 1:100. This antibody is reported to react within residues 396-405 of the C-terminal folding domain (11NykjÃ¦r A. Nielsen M. Lookene A. Meyer M. RÃ¸igaard H. Etzerodt M. Beisiegel U. Olivecrona G. Gliemann J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31747-31755Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29Liu M.S. Ma Y. Hayden M.R. Brunzell J.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1128: 113-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), and separate analysis showed that it did not react with the peptide comprising aa 402-423 used in inhibition experiments. A fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse IgG (F(abâ²)2 fragment, DAKO, Denmark) at dilution 1:50 was used to visualize the primary antibody. Both antibodies were diluted in PBS-glycine, 1% bovine serum albumin. The primary antibody was applied for 45 min at 37Â°C and, following washing in PBS-glycine for 15 min, the secondary antibody was applied for 45 min. The coverslips were then labeled with the nuclear stain Hoechst 33342, mounted upside-down on a glass slide with a drop of Immunofluore (ICN Biomedicals) and viewed on a Zeiss Axioskop equipped for epifluorescence. For confocal microscopy studies we used a Leica TCS 4D confocal scanning laser microscope adapted to an inverted Leitz DMIRBE microscope and a 63Ã (numerical aperture 1.4, oil) Leitz Plan-Apo objective. Fluorescein isothiocyanate was excited at 488-nm lines from a 75-mW krypton-argon laser. Each image was the average of four serial scans at the confocal microscope normal scan rate (30Pagan R. Martin I. Alonso A. Llobera M. VilarÃ³ S. Exp. Cell Res. 1996; 222: 333-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Image sizes were 512 Ã 512 and were photographed on a color high resolution video printer. The results are representative for at least five separate experiments. We first examined whether the the C-terminal folding domain of the human lipase, LpL-(313-448), has an affinity toward Î±2MR/LRP similar to that of the fragment, LpL-(347-448). Fig. 1 shows binding of 125I-labeled folding domain to immobilized purified Î±2MR/LRP. The binding was completely inhibited by unlabeled LpL-(313-448) or LpL-(347-448) at high concentrations. The potency of the fragment toward inhibition of the binding of 125I-LpL-(313-448) was similar to or slightly lower than that of the folding domain. Other experiments (not shown) demonstrated complete inhibition of the binding of tracer in the presence of heparin (10 units/ml). In the reverse experiment, 125I-labeled Î±2MR/LRP was bound to immobilized bovine LpL, and the inhibitory potencies of LpL-(313-448) and LpL-(347-448) were again found to be similar and inhibitable by heparin (not shown). We decided to use the LpL-(347-448) fragment as the basis for mutational analysis since the yields of the recombinant products were satisfactory. The inhibitory potencies toward binding of 125I-Î±2MR/LRP to immobilized bLpL were measured as illustrated in Fig. 2. The results summarized in Table I show that deletion of aa 380-384 caused a 10-20-fold reduction in the inhibitory potency. Deletion of aa 390-393, or exchange with the equivalent aa in human hepatic lipase, had no effect. Deletion of a large segment comprising aa 404-430 also caused a marked reduction in the inhibitory potency, whereas the deletion of aa 404-414 caused only an approximately 4-fold reduction. The displayed point mutations had little or no effects. Previous results have shown that LpL-(378-448) and LpL-(378-423) have the same affinity to Î±2MR/LRP (11NykjÃ¦r A. Nielsen M. Lookene A.

When taken together, the results therefore indicate that two segments rich in basic residues are important for the interaction with receptor: aa 380-384 (LKWKS) and aa 404-423 (IRVKAGETQKKVIFCSREKV).Table ICompetition of mutated LpL-(347-448) constructs for binding of 125I-Î±2MR/LRP to bLpLUnlabeled LpL-(347-448) constructsInhibition of 125I-Î±2MR/LRP binding to bLpL (Ki)nMWild-type11-20Gly409â Arg11-21Trp390â Ala13-15Trp393â Ala17-30del390-39314-25390-393LpL to HL14-18del380-384>250del404-430â¼250del404-41447-62 Open table in a new tab It has been reported that LpL-(313-448) (20Williams S.E.

We therefore compared the abilities of the folding domain, LpL-(313-448), and the fragment, LpL-(347-448), to bind 125I-labeled rabbit Î²-VLDL. Fig. 3A shows that LpL-(347-448) does not bind Î²-VLDL. The binding of Î²-VLDL to LpL-(313-448) was confirmed, although this binding is poor compared with the binding to bLpL. Fig. 3B shows that LpL-(313-448) can mediate binding of Î²-VLDL to Î±2MR/LRP, although poorly, and that the concentrations of LpL-(313-448) required for the mediation of lipoprotein binding are more than 100-fold higher than those needed for bLpL. Finally, Fig. 4 shows that, whereas 100 nM bLpL clearly mediates degradation of 125I-Î²-VLDL in COS-1 cells, which express abundant Î±2MR/LRP (24Nielsen M.S. Nykjaer A. Warshawsky I. Schwartz A.L.

We therefore conclude that the C-terminal folding domain cannot on its own mediate efficient uptake of lipoproteins.Fig. 4Degradation of 125I-Î²-VLDL mediated by LpL.

Heparin, when added, was at 200 units/ml. By the end of the incubation, the amount of radioactivity associated with the cells (open bars) and the trichloroacetic acid-soluble (hatched bars) and -precipitable (filled bars) radioactivity in the medium were determined.

Metastatic NIH 3T3 fibroblasts transformed by different activated ras genes showed two different protease phenotypes, rasuPA+/CLâ and rasCL+/uPAâ (Zhang, J-Y., and Schultz, R. M. (1992) Cancer Research 52, 6682-6689). Phenotype rasuPA+/CLâ is dependent on expression of the serine-type protease urokinase plasminogen activator (uPA) and the phenotype rasCL+/uPAâ on the cystine-type protease cathepsin L (CL) for lung colonization in experimental metastasis. The existence of multiple invasive phenotypes on ras-isoform transformation implied the activation of alternative pathways downstream from Ras. We now show that c-Raf-1, extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase (ERK)-1, and ERK-2 are hyperphosphorylated, and the ERK activity is high in both the uPA- and CL-dependent ras-transformed invasive phenotypes. Levels of c-Jun and c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK) activity are also high in the uPA-dependent phenotype, but they are almost undetectable in the CL-dependent phenotype. The uPA Ras-response element is a PEA3/URTF element, and mobility shift assays show a strong PEA3/URTF protein band in the uPA-dependent phenotype. This band is competed by a consensus AP-1 DNA sequence and by antibodies to PEA3 and c-Jun. Thus, the uPA-invasive phenotype appears to require the activation of Ets/PEA3 and c-Jun transcription factors activated by the ERK and JNK pathways, while the CL-invasive phenotype appears to require ERK activity with suppression of JNK and c-Jun activities. These postulates are supported by the introduction of a dominant negative c-Jun, TAM67, into cells of phenotype rasuPA+/CLâ, which down-regulated the high uPA mRNA levels characteristic of this phenotype to basal levels and up-regulated basal levels of CL mRNA to levels similar to those observed in cells of phenotype rasCL+/uPAâ. We conclude that the JNK pathway acts as a switch between two distinct protease phenotypes that are redundant in their abilities to grow tumors and metastasize.

Since any one migrating cell only expresses or induces a limited spectrum of these proteases, redundant protease mechanisms must exist for cellular migration through ECM under both normal and pathological conditions. Furthermore, switching between redundant mechanisms may be a common event. For example, prior data have shown a dependence on plasminogen activator activity in the cellular invasions that occur during fertilization, embryogenesis, angiogenesis, neuronal development, and macrophage migration (1Lison D.

In a previous report, we showed two distinct ras-transformed metastatic phenotypes in NIH 3T3 fibroblasts, based on differences in expression of either uPA or CL and the corresponding ability of either uPA or CL to facilitate lung colonization in nude mice (11Zhang J-Y. Schultz R.M. Cancer Res. 1992; 52: 6682-6689PubMed Google Scholar). The NIH 3T3 cells transformed by the EJ/vHa-ras gene are an example of phenotype rasuPA+/CLâ. These cells showed a high constitutive expression of uPA, low constitutive expression of CL, and uPA-dependent (CL-independent) lung colonization in nude mice. In contrast, NIH 3T3 cells transformed by the RAS1Leudel gene were of phenotype rasCL+/uPAâ. These cells showed high constitutive expression of CL, low constitutive expression of uPA, and CL-dependent (uPA-independent) lung colonization (11Zhang J-Y. Schultz R.M. Cancer Res. 1992; 52: 6682-6689PubMed Google Scholar). A role for uPA in invasion and metastasis has been demonstrated by experiments in which metastasis was inhibited by anti-uPA antibodies and by the expression of uPA sense or antisense cDNAs in transformed cells that either promoted or inhibited, respectively, tumor cell invasion and metastasis (12Ossowski L.

Pro-uPA may be secreted by migrating or stromal cells in the environment of migrating cells and may be activated while bound to specific uPA receptors expressed on the cell surface of invading cells (15Blasi F. Bioessays. 1993; 15: 105-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar). uPA promotes the degradation of ECM proteins either acting alone or through activation of plasminogen to plasmin (6Mignatti P. Rifkin D.B. Physiol. Rev. 1993; 73: 161-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (1180) Google Scholar), which, in turn, may initiate an extracellular cascade leading to the activation of the pro-metalloproteinases (6Mignatti P.

A possible role for CL in invasion and metastasis is supported by reports of a correlation between a high CL expression and high levels of invasion or metastasis in particular tumor types (reviewed by Gottesman and co-workers (7Chauhan S.S. Goldstein L.J. Gottesman M.M. Cancer Res. 1991; 51: 1478-1481PubMed Google Scholar)). CL is secreted by transformed cells in the pro-form and is processed extracellularly to an enzymatically active form (18Dehrmann F.M. Coetzer T.H.T. Pike R.N. Dennison C. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 324: 93-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 19Ishidoh K. Kominami E. FEBS Lett. 1994; 352: 281-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 20Heidtmann H.H. Salge U. Havemann K. Kirschke H. Wiederanders B. Oncol. Res. 1993; 5: 441-451PubMed Google Scholar). CL has been shown to act on types I and IV collagens and other major components of the ECM (21Reddy G.K. Dhar S.C. Int. J. Biochem. 1992; 24: 1465-1473Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 22Guinec N. Dalet-Fumeron V. Pagano M. Biol. Chem.

FEBS Lett. 1993; 321: 247-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Multiple pathways, in addition to the c-Raf â ERK pathway, have recently been shown to be activated by Ras (24Marshall M.S. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 1311-1318Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar, 25White M.A. Nicolette C. Minden A. Polverino A. Van Aelst L. Karin M. Wigler M.H. Cell. 1995; 80: 533-541Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (628) Google Scholar). Ras may thus be a switching molecule that interprets multiple cellular physiological signals to control such diverse physiological processes as proliferation and differentiation (26Cowley S. Paterson H. Kemp P. Marshall C.J. Cell. 1994; 77: 841-852Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1854) Google Scholar) through selective activation of downstream pathways. Different Ras isoforms may discriminate between downstream pathways through structurally-dependent differences in affinities for downstream effector protein molecules (27Minato T. Wang J. Akasaka K. Okada T. Suzuki N. Kataoka T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20845-20851Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), resulting in an affinity-dependent selection among the possible downstream effectors and their corresponding pathways. This paper will provide evidence that the Ras â ERK and Ras â JNK pathways are required for the rasuPA+/CLâ phenotype; while in the rasCL+/uPAâ phenotype, the ERK pathway is activated, but the JNK pathway leading to the activation of c-Jun is inhibited. These data support a hypothesis that the JNK pathway regulates a switch between two different transformed phenotypes that carry out metastasis by different protease mechanisms. NIH 3T3 cells and NIH 3T3 cells containing the EJ/vHa-ras and RAS1Leudel oncogene constructs were originally obtained from Merck Sharp & Dohme Research Laboratories (West Point, PA) and cultured at low passage number as described previously by Bradley et al. (28Bradley M.O. Kraynak A.R. Storer R.D. Gibbs J.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 5277-5281Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) The characteristics and metastatic potential of these transformed cells have been previously reported by Bradley et al. (28Bradley M.O. Kraynak A.R. Storer R.D. Gibbs J.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 5277-5281Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) and by Zhang and Schultz (11Zhang J-Y. Schultz R.M. Cancer Res. 1992; 52: 6682-6689PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 Î¼g/ml streptomycin at 37Â°C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere as described previously (11Zhang J-Y. Schultz R.M. Cancer Res. 1992; 52: 6682-6689PubMed Google Scholar). Nuclear extracts were prepared by the method of Digman et al. (29Digman J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9164) Google Scholar) from NIH 3T3 (control), EJ/vHa-ras, and RAS1Leudel cells. The cells (1 Ã 107) were washed with cold PBS and suspended in hypotonic buffer (10 mM HEPES (pH 7.9), 1.5 mM MgCl2, 10 mM KCl, 0.5 mM DTT, and 0.2 mM in freshly added phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). The swollen cells were homogenized, and the nuclei were pelleted and resuspended in extraction buffer (20 mM HEPES (pH 7.9), 25% glycerol, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 20 mM KCl, 0.2 mM EDTA, 0.5 mM DTT, and 0.2 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). A high salt buffer (with 2 M KCl in place of 20 mM KCl) was added dropwise to release soluble proteins. The solution was centrifuged, the supernatant was dialyzed, and the protein concentrations in the extracts were determined by a Bio-Rad protein kit with bovine serum albumin solutions as standards and normalized so that each aliquot contained an equivalent concentration of protein. The aliquots were stored at â80Â°C until utilized. Double-stranded DNA oligonucleotides were purified by agarose gel electrophoresis and labeled with [32P]ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase for 30 min at 37Â°C. The nuclear extracts (1-2 Î¼g of protein) were preincubated at room temperature in a reaction mixture containing 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 50 mM NaCl, 1 mM MgCl2, 0.5 mM EDTA, 0.5 mM DTT, 10% glycerol (w/v), 2 Î¼g of poly(dI-dC) and unlabeled competitor oligonucleotide or antibody (when utilized) at room temperature for 15 min. The labeled probe (1 ng) was added, and the incubation continued for another 20 min. The protein-DNA complexes were resolved on a 4% non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel at room temperature in 0.5 Ã TBE (1 Ã TBE was 89 mM in Tris-HCl, 2.5 mM EDTA, and 89 mM boric acid) at 100 V for 3 h, and the gels were dried and analyzed by autoradiography. Cells (2 Ã 105 cells/well) were plated onto a 6-well plate and grown overnight at 37Â°C in a 5% CO2 incubator. The cells were washed with cold PBS and lysed with 400-500 Î¼l of RIPA buffer (10 mM sodium phosphate (pH 7.5), 100 mM NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 2 Î¼g/ml aprotinin, and 100 Î¼M sodium orthovanadate). Lysates were assayed for total cell protein (Bio-Rad protein kit) and normalized for protein concentrations. The samples were boiled at 95Â°C for 5 min in SDS-PAGE buffer. About 25-50 Î¼g of total protein was loaded per lane onto a 12% polyacrylamide gel (30% acrylamide/0.8% bisacrylamide) and electrophoresed in a Protean mini-gel apparatus at 150 V for 1.5 h. The separated proteins were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane in a Bio-Rad transblot apparatus at 200 mA for 90 min in cold transfer buffer (20% methanol/0.05% SDS, 25 mM Tris, 192 mM glycine). The blots were blocked for 1 h in 5% (w/v) non-fat dried milk in Tris-buffered saline (TBS) (20 mM Tris, 137 mM NaCl). They were washed in 0.1% Tween-20 in TBS (TBST) and incubated in a 1:500 dilution of primary rabbit polyclonal antibody (10 Î¼g/0.1 ml) for 1 h, followed by three washes in TBST. The membranes were then incubated in a 1:5000 dilution of goat anti-rabbit peroxidase (standard solution of 1 Î¼g/ml) secondary antibody for 1 h. The membranes were washed in TBST, and immunoreactivity was detected by the enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) protocol (Amersham, Life Science, Inc.) with the chemiluminescence recorded on Kodak X-Omat film. In some experiments, visualization of antigen was made with an alkaline phosphatase secondary antibody and BCIP (bromochloroindoyl phosphate) and NBT (nitro blue tetrazolium) as chromogenic substrates. All antibodies for Western blot analyses and for immunoprecipitation were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). The specific antibodies used in this work are identified in the respective figure legends. Cells were plated in 6-well plates as described above. Prior to [32P]phosphate-labeling, the cells were starved for phosphate for 1 h in phosphate-free DMEM (Life Technologies, Inc.) containing 10% FBS that had previously been dialyzed against phosphate-free DMEM. Orthophosphate (100 Î¼Ci 32P) was added to each well and incubated for 4 h. The radiolabeled cells were washed with cold PBS and lysed with RIPA buffer, and equal amounts of RIPA-buffered lysate from each cell line (normalized by their protein concentrations) were treated overnight for immunoprecipitation by addition of the indicated antiserum and protein A/G-Sepharose beads. The immune complexes were collected by centrifugation for 30 min at 2500 rpm in a microcentrifuge and washed 4 times with 1 ml of RIPA buffer. Samples were boiled in SDS-PAGE sample buffer and resolved on a 12% SDS-PAGE gel. The gels were transferred and analyzed by autoradiography with quantification by densitometry (Bio-Imaging analyzer). The procedure was similar to that previously described by Gotoh et al. (30Gotoh Y. Nishida E. Yamashita T. Hoshi M. Kawakami M. Sakai H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 193: 661-669Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). Cells were plated as in the Western blot analysis procedure and lysed with RIPA buffer, the lysates were normalized for protein concentration, and the samples were boiled in the SDS-PAGE sample buffer. Approximately 50 Î¼g of protein were loaded per lane in an SDS-PAGE 12% polyacrylamide gel in which myelin basic protein (Sigma) was incorporated at a concentration of 0.4 mg/ml. After electrophoresis, the gel was washed twice with 20% (v/v) 2-propanol in 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) for 30 min each wash, followed by a wash with 5 mM mercaptoethanol in 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4). The gel was further washed twice (30 min each) with 6 M guanidine HCl in 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4). The proteins were renatured by incubating the gel overnight in 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) containing 0.04% (v/v) Tween 40 and 5 mM mercaptoethanol at 4Â°C. The gel was preincubated at 30Â°C for 30 min in 50 mM HEPES, 100 Î¼M sodium orthovanadate, 10 mM magnesium chloride, and 5 mM mercaptoethanol. The gel was then placed in the same buffer containing 50 Î¼M cold ATP and 100 Î¼Ci [32P]ATP for 1 h at 30Â°C. After extensive washing with 5% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid and 10 mM sodium pyrophosphate, the gels were dried and autoradiographed. The relative intensity of the 32P-bands were determined by densitometry (Bio-Imaging analyzer). The plasmid pGEX-GST-c-Jun-1-135 synthesized by J. R. Woodgett (31Kyriakis J.M. Banerjee P. Nikolakaki E. Dai T. Rubie E.A. Ahmad M.F. Abruch J. Woodgett J.R. Nature. 1994; 369: 156-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (2415) Google Scholar) was obtained from J. M. Kyriakis (Massachusetts General Hospital) and used to transform Escherichia coli. The GST-c-Jun substrate for JNK was isolated as described by Frangioni and Neel (32Frangioni J.V. Neel B.G. Anal. Biochem. 1993; 210: 179-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (833) Google Scholar). GST-c-Jun was attached to hexylglutathione-agarose beads (Sigma) and used to assay JNK as described by Westwick and Brenner (33Westwick J.K. Brenner D.A. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 255: 342-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The cellular lysates incubated with the GST-Jun-agarose were obtained from NIH 3T3 cells and ras-transformed NIH 3T3 cells grown in 100 mm plates, were washed with ice-cold PBS, and were treated with cell lysis buffer (20 mM HEPES, 25% glycerol, 0.42 M NaCl, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 0.2 mM EDTA, 0.5 mM DTT and 0.3% Nonidet P-40). After 30 min at 4Â°C, the plates were scraped and the lysate clarified by centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 10 min. The supernatant was assayed for protein concentration by the Bio-Rad protein kit, normalized for protein concentration, and stored in aliquots at â80Â°C. For the kinase assay, 80 Î¼g protein aliquots were incubated with 1 Î¼g of GST-c-Jun bound to glutathione-agarose beads for 3 h at 4Â°C. The kinase assay was carried out as described by Westwick and Brenner (33Westwick J.K. Brenner D.A. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 255: 342-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), and the 32P-c-Jun-GST product was analyzed in a 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. The gel was dried and exposed overnight for autoradiography with quantification by densitometry. The mouse CL cDNA in pUC-19 was a gift from G. Gary Sahagian (Tufts University School of Medicine, MA), and the mouse uPA cDNA plasmid pDB4501 (a mouse uPA PstI-HindIII cDNA fragment in pSP64) was a gift of Dominique Belin (Center Medical Universitaire, Switzerland). The CL mRNA 32P-labeled hybridization probe was produced from the 766-base pair EcoRI fragment of the pUC19-CL by random priming (Ready-to-Go Kit, Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). The 32P-labeled uPA mRNA antisense hybridization probe was prepared using SP6 RNA polymerase (Life Technologies, Inc.) from the SP6 promoter site in the pDB4501 plasmid. The plasmid pCMV-TAM67 containing the dominant negative c-Jun, TAM67, and the control plasmid pCMV (empty vector) were a generous gift from Michael J. Birrer (NCI, MD). TAM67 is a deletion mutant of the c-jun gene that lacks the N-terminal transactivation domain (amino acids 3-122) (34Brown P.H. Alani R. Preis L.H. Birrer M.J. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 877-886PubMed Google Scholar, 35Brown P.H. Chen T.K. Birrer M.J. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 791-799PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were co-transfected with pcDNA3 (Invitrogen, CA) along with pCMV-TAM67 or pCMV (empty vector) using the calcium phosphate method (36Wigler M. Silverstein S. Lee L.S. Pellicer A. Cheng Y. Axel R. Cell. 1977; 11: 223-232Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (845) Google Scholar). In brief, cells were grown to a concentration of 3 Ã 105 cells/100-mm dish, the media replaced with 5 ml of serum-free DMEM, and incubated 2 h. Cells were then exposed in DNA/calcium phosphate solution (2 Î¼g of pCMV-TAM67 or of pCMV-empty vector along with 1 Î¼g of pcDNA3 and made up to 10 Î¼g of DNA with salmon sperm DNA) for 4 h, were rinsed with PBS, and were grown overnight in 10% FBS-DMEM. The following day, cells were divided into three 100-mm plates, and the media was changed to 10% FBS-DMEM containing 200 Î¼g/ml G418. After 48 h, the concentration of G418 was increased to 600 Î¼g/ml, and the cells were selected for 14 to 21 days. G418-resistant colonies were isolated for expansion using cloning cylinders, and cells were maintained in 10% FBS-DMEM containing 200 Î¼g/ml G418 until analysis. The presence of TAM67 mRNA, which migrates lower than indigenous c-Jun mRNA (2.7 or 3.0 kb), in the transfected cell colonies was shown by Northern analysis for TAM67 using a BamHI fragment from pCMV-TAM67 to hybridize with TAM67 mRNA (868 base pairs). The persistence of the transformed phenotype in the TAM67 expressing cells was shown by the ability of the cells to form colonies in soft agar, utilizing the procedure of Cox and Der (37Cox A.D. Der C.J. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 238: 277-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Several parallel pathways are known to exist downstream from Ras (24Marshall M.S. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 1311-1318Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar, 25White M.A. Nicolette C. Minden A. Polverino A. Van Aelst L. Karin M. Wigler M.H.

A well characterized downstream pathway is from Ras â c-Raf-1 â MEK â ERK-1/ERK-2 (Fig. 1). The phosphorylation of transcription factors by the ERKs activate the expression of genes that are believed to cause new DNA synthesis and cell division (24Marshall M.S. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 1311-1318Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar, 38Khosravi-Far R. Der C.J. Cancer Metastasis Rev. 1994; 13: 67-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). A parallel kinase cascade pathway from Ras utilizes the Ras-like p21 GTP binding proteins Rac and CDC42, leading to the activation of JNK and p38 kinase. Activation of JNK leads to the phosphorylation and activation of the transcription factors c-Jun and ATF-2 (24Marshall M.S.

In this work, we have compared the signal transduction pathway from Ras to ERK and Ras to JNK in EJ/vHa-ras-transformed (phenotype rasuPA+/CLâ), RAS1Leudel-transformed (phenotype rasCL+/uPAâ), and untransformed NIH 3T3 fibroblasts to determine the Ras downstream signals that may regulate the switching between the uPA-dependent and CL-dependent invasion mechanisms. The relative concentrations of c-Raf-1 and the MAP kinases ERK-1 and ERK-2 were determined by Western blot analysis (Fig. 2). The levels of c-Raf-1, ERK1, and ERK2 were not significantly different between the untransformed NIH 3T3 cells and the EJ/vHa-ras- or RAS1Leudel-transformed NIH 3T3 cells. Therefore, differences between the untransformed and Ras-transformed phenotypes are not due to underlying differences in the concentrations of these downstream Ras signal transduction proteins. Activation of protein molecules downstream from Ras in the Raf â MEK â ERK kinase cascade occurs on their phosphorylation by the preceding kinase in the cascade (44Crespo P. Xu N. Daniotti J.L.

Additionally, the COX Vb gene encodes multiple mRNAs that exhibit 5â² heterogeneity due to transcription initiation at multiple initiator sites (5Basu A. Avadhani N.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15450-15456Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Sucharov C. Basu A. Avadhani N.G. Gene Exp. 1996; 5: 93-111Google Scholar).The immediate upstream region of the mouse COX Vb gene consists of a TATA-less GC-rich sequence characteristic of a number of âhousekeepingâ genes. The basal promoter region has been mapped to the â8 to +40 region of the gene, which contains several protein-binding motifs. At least five of these protein-binding motifs correspond to discrete transcription initiation sites (10Sucharov C. Basu A. Avadhani N.G. Gene Exp. 1996; 5: 93-111Google Scholar). Initiation of RNA mapping to the +1 position of the promoter has been shown previously to depend upon a YY-1-binding initiator motif (12Basu A. Park K. Atchison M.L. Carter R.S. Avadhani N.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4188-4196Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recently we have found that the GA-binding protein factor-binding Ets repeat sequence GTTCCCGGAAG at the +17 to +26 position also functions as an independent initiator for transcription of two clusters of RNAs mapping to the +18/19 and +23/24 regions (10Sucharov C. Basu A. Avadhani N.G. Gene Exp. 1996; 5: 93-111Google Scholar).Although the COX Vb gene is constitutively expressed, its level of expression varies in different tissues. C0X Vb mRNA is 10-20-fold more abundant in the heart and kidney as compared to the liver. Furthermore, the COX Vb mRNA level increases markedly during induced differentiation of C2C12 myoblasts into myotubes. In the present study we have investigated the contributions of various protein-binding motifs from the 5â² distal region of the promoter in the overall transcriptional rates of the promoter. We have identified a negative regulatory region, which encompasses a YY-1-like (YY-1â²) and CArG-like (CArGâ²) consensus motifs flanking a GTG element (13Zhao X.-A. Hung M.-C. Mol. Cell Biol. 1992; 12: 2739-2748Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), a novel enhancer found in the neu oncogene promoter. Results presented in this paper show that factor YY-1 binding to the downstream CArGâ² motif is important for the activity of the negative enhancer. Our results therefore suggest that in addition to the multiple positive cis acting elements (7Carter R.S. Bhat N.K. Basu A. Avadhani N.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23418-23426Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Carter R.S. Avadhani N.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4381-4387Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Lenka N. Basu A.

Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 380-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar), a negative enhancer region is involved in the complex regulatory circuit of the COX Vb gene expression.DISCUSSIONSubunit Vb of the mammalian COX is classified as a ubiquitously expressed subunit of the enzyme complex (2Capaldi R.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1990; 59: 569-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar). Results presented in this study, along with previous results (5Basu A. Avadhani N.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15450-15456Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Sucharov C. Basu A. Avadhani N.G. Gene Exp. 1996; 5: 93-111Google Scholar), demonstrate that the relative abundance of the COX Vb mRNA in different tissues varies markedly; the mouse kidney and heart contain about 10-20-fold higher level of the mRNA than the liver (Fig. 1A). Furthermore, a 4-6-fold higher level of the mRNA is detected during induced differentiation of C2C12 myocytes. Our results suggest that widely varying levels of Cox Vb mRNA transcription in different tissues are due to the presence of an unusual negative regulatory element at the 5â² distal region of the promoter, whose suppressor activity appears to vary in different cell types and during induced myogenesis. The activity of this negative enhancer is regulated by transcription factor YY-1 in conjunction with other protein factors that bind to this region in a sequence- and tissue-specific manner.Results of deletion analyses (Fig. 3, Fig. 4) show that the negative regulatory region spans sequences â481 to â321, and consists of two distinct domains. A region between â481 and â390 contains three different sequence motifs showing partial consensus to the YY-1-binding site (NF-E1â²), a GTG enhancer element, and a CArG-like element (CArGâ²). The second region between â390 and â321 contains an Ets sequence motif, which binds to an unknown factor from 3T3, liver, and C2C12 nuclear extracts (results not shown). All three upstream region sequence motifs, YY-1â², GTG, and CArGâ², stimulated transcription of the TKCAT promoter in 3T3, Hep 3B, and C2C12 cells at different levels (Fig. 5). All three DNA motifs exhibited distinctly different patterns of protein binding with nuclear extracts from liver and C2C12 myotubes (Fig. 9), suggesting that the cell- or tissue-specific binding patterns may reflect upon the differing levels of transcription activation with these activator motifs in different cells. The three motifs placed together in a tandem array, as they exist in the COX Vb promoter, nearly completely reversed the transcriptional activity obtained with the individual sequence motifs. The transcriptional down-regulation of the heterologous promoter was more pronounced when further downstream sequences up to â320 were linked to the TKCAT promoter or the mouse COXIV promoter (Fig. 5). It is therefore likely that the 90-bp region, containing the three protein-binding motifs, together with the flanking downstream sequence is involved in conferring the negative regulatory activity.An interesting observation of this study relates to the unusual nature of YY-1 binding to the negative regulatory region. Gel mobility shift patterns in Fig. 6 show that the YY-1â² and CArGâ² sequences fail to bind to bacterially expressed purified YY-1 factor under conditions that detect only complexes with slow off rates. Under conditions that detect rapidly dissociating complexes, however, the CArGâ² sequence motif, but not the YY-1â² motif binds to the YY-1 factor (Fig. 6). The 90-bp DNA probe containing all three sequence motifs, on the other hand, binds to the YY-1 factor under slow off rate conditions and the bound complex yields a single-site methylation footprint, which maps to the CArGâ² sequence region. Thus, although the CArGâ² sequence region appears to provide the site for binding, the overall binding efficiency appears to be modulated by a still unknown sequence or structure within the 90-bp DNA sequence. YY-1 is a multifunctional factor, which functions both as a transcriptional activator and a repressor (18Bushmeyer S. Park K. Atchison M.L. J. Biol.

Gilman M.Z. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 2497-2509Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar) of different promoters under different cellular conditions and in different cell systems. Additionally, YY-1 binding is known to induce DNA bending in some cases (35Natesan S. Gilman M.Z. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 2497-2509Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). In the present case, YY-1 binding may induce similar DNA bending, facilitating specific interactions between protein-bound complexes at both upstream and downstream regions of the COX Vb negative enhancer.Experiments in Fig. 10 (A and D), demonstrating a 60% suppression of transcription in 3T3 and C2C12 myoblasts by co-expression with YY-1 cDNA, provide evidence for its involvement in the negative regulation of the COX Vb gene under transient transfection conditions. Several lines of evidence suggest that the YY-1-mediated inhibition is specific. First, as shown in Fig. 10, the YY-1-mediated inhibition is dose-dependent. Results of cotransfection with various deletion constructs of YY-1 (expressed as Gal-4 fusion proteins) in Fig. 11 demonstrate that the DNA binding and repressor domains of YY-1 are essential for transcription suppression of the COX Vb promoter, while the transcription activation domain is not necessary. Third, mutations targeted to the CArGâ² region of the promoter resulted in vastly reduced YY-1 binding and reduced effectiveness of the negative enhancer (Fig. 10, C and D). It is therefore likely that the relative levels of YY-1 in a given cell type may determine the level of expression of the COX Vb gene. It is also likely that other tissue-specific factors binding to the CArGâ² or other flanking motifs might affect the binding or the activity of the YY-1 factor. It was recently reported that although nuclear extract from differentiated chick embryonic myocytes contained YY-1 protein, its DNA binding efficiency was reduced, possibly due to interference from another muscle-specific factor (36Lee T.-C. Shi Y. Schwartz R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 9814-9818Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). It is known that a number of different nuclear protein factors, including Sp1 (37Lee J.S. Galvin K.M. Shi Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6145-6149Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar), E1A (38Lewis B.A. Tullis G. Seto E. Horihoshi N. Weinmann R. Shenk T. J.

Science. 1993; 262: 1889-1892Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar), interact with YY-1 and modulate its functional properties. Our results showing a reduced transcription activity of the â481/CArGâ²M1 and â481/CArGâ²M2 constructs in differentiated myotube suggests that in the context of the COX Vb promoter, the CArGâ² sequence functions as a transcription activator in differentiated myocytes, and mutations in this region may affect the binding of myotube-specific transcriptional activator protein(s).A number of different negative enhancer mechanisms have been reported (41Levine M. Manley J.L. Cell. 1989; 59: 405-408Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar, 42Johnson A.D. Cell. 1995; 81: 655-658Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar), including the repression due to competition for DNA-binding sites, the quenching mechanism, where the repressor interferes with the function of activator(s) without inhibiting its binding ability, and the direct repression where the negative regulatory factor blocks the activity of the basal transcription complex. It appears likely that the COX Vb negative regulatory region represents a mechanism similar to the quenching phenomenon. The activity of the negative enhancer may require specific interactions between proteins bound to the upstream 90-bp DNA sequence with those bound to sequences downstream of the â390 region, although the details of this interaction currently remain unknown. We also postulate that positive acting sequence motifs like YY-1â², GTG, and CArGâ², when correctly juxtaposed to the downstream regulatory region, alter the activity of various transactivator proteins, with the net effect being the transcriptional repression of the promoter. Recent studies have shown that in a number of different promoters, regulatory regions consist of alternatively positioned positive and negative acting regulatory elements. In the case of the low density lipoprotein receptor gene, the sterol-dependent binding of a protein to a regulatory sequence inhibits or alters the activity of an adjacent Sp1 factor-binding site (43Dawson P.A.

Chem. 1991; 266: 24471-24476Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), transcriptional regulation involves interaction between both positive and negative elements. Currently the nature of proteins binding to the individual sequence motifs of the COX Vb negative regulatory region, the nature of interaction between the various bound complexes, and the precise role of the YY-1 in mediating these interactions remain unknown. Further experiments are under way to elucidate these mechanisms.

The nucleophilic attack on a specific phosphodiester bond is followed by the covalent attachment of the recombinase to the target sequence through a phosphoamino acid linkage.An interesting issue in the chemistry of site-specific recombination is the position of the donor of the nucleophile in the synaptic complex. Does the recombinase that donates the nucleophilic amino acid bind immediately adjacent to the site of cleavage (cis cleavage) or does the donor lie somewhere else in the synaptic complex (trans cleavage)? For the Î²Î´ resolvase, the answer was that cleavage took place in cis, as intuitively expected (6Grindley N.D.F. Science. 1993; 262: 738-740Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 9Droge P.

Cell. 1992; 69: 647-658Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar) showed that the Flp recombinase, a member of the integrase family, cleaved in trans. trans cleavage may occur in one of three ways. trans-horizontal cleavage means that the nucleophile donor is across the core from the site of cleavage but on the same recombination target molecule. trans-Vertical and trans-diagonal cleavage mean that the nucleophile donor resides on a different DNA target site in the synaptic complex from the one being cleaved (see Refs. 10Chen J.-W.

Biol. 1995; 51: 53-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). These latter two modes of cleavage imply that a synaptic complex must assemble before cleavage can occur. Recent evidence from the Jayaram laboratory (12Lee J. Whang I. Lee J. Jayaram M. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5346-5354Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) suggests that trans cleavage by Flp takes place by a trans-horizontal mechanism, i.e. it does not require prior synapsis of the two Flp recognition target sites. trans cleavage is also observed for the R recombinase of the 2-Î¼m-like plasmid of Zygosaccharomyces rouxxi (13Yang S.H. Jayaram M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12789-12796Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Flp has recently been shown to resolve synthetic Holliday junctions in trans (14Dixon J.E. Shaikh A.C. Sadowski P.D. Molec. Microbiol. 1995; 18: 449-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar).These studies have stimulated an examination of the mode of cleavage by other site-specific recombinases of both the transpositional and conservative varieties (for discussion see Refs. 15Stark W.M.

Although initial evidence supported a trans cleavage mode for the Î» integrase protein acting on the attL site (20Han Y.W. Gumport R.I. Gardner J.F. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4577-4584Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), subsequent studies showed that Î» integrase resolves Holliday intermediates by cis cleavage (21Nunes-DÃ¼by S.E. Tirumalai R.S. Dorgai L. Yagil E. Weisberg R.A. Landy A. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4421-4430Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Likewise the XerC/XerD recombinase, also a member of the integrase family, is thought to cleave in cis (22Arciszewska L.K. Sherratt D.J. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2112-2120Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar).Because of the apparent diversity among members of the integrase family with respect to their mode of cleavage, it was of interest to examine other integrase family members for their mechanism of cleavage. The Cre protein of bacteriophage P1 is a well characterized recombinase of the integrase family (23Abremski K. Hoess R. Sternberg N. Cell. 1983; 32: 1301-1311Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). Its biological function is to resolve dimeric P1 plasmids to monomers and hence to aid partition of the plasmid (24Austin S. Ziese M. Sternberg N. Cell. 1981; 25: 729-736Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). Cre catalyzes reciprocal recombination between its lox sites (Fig. 1). The lox sites are similar to the Flp recognition target sites of Flp in both overall architecture and actual sequence (25Vetter D. Andrews B.J. Roberts-Beatty L. Sadowski P.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 7284-7288Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Furthermore, both the Cre and Flp proteins promote efficient recombination in vitro without the requirement for any accessory proteins.We have used half- and full-lox sites to show that the Cre protein, like the Flp protein, executes cleavage in trans. These studies extend the diversity of the cleavage mechanisms among the members of the integrase family. This is the first example of a prokaryotic member of the integrase family that cleaves in trans.DISCUSSIONThe results presented in this paper support a trans cleavage mechanism for the Cre recombinase. A cleavage-competent Cre protein (either Cre or CreHis) when bound to a noncleavable half-lox site (B) was able to complement the cleavage defect of CreHis Y324C or Cre25. This effect was not due to dissociation of the cleavage-competent Cre from its half-site and its reassociation with the partner site (Figs. 4a and 5). The results were strengthened by the finding that cleavage of the X25 site by the CreHis protein was greatly stimulated by the presence of the Cre protein bound to a full- or half-lox site. (Fig. 4, Fig. 5, Fig. 6). Finally, we found that the stimulation of cleavage was sensitive to dilution; diluting the prebinding mixtures into a greater volume caused a diminution of cleavage. This suggests that cleavage requires an intermolecular reaction and hence does not occur in cis.Do our results provide any information about the mode of cleavage, i.e. does it occur by a trans-horizontal, trans-vertical, or trans-diagonal mechanism? The use of half-sites makes an assignment of a cleavage mode difficult and, in part, semantic. However, the fact that Cre (although not CreHis) cleaves the X25 half-site is compatible with the formation of a homodimeric complex (Fig. 7a) followed by cleavage in a trans-horizontal mode. Cre bound to the X25 half-site is able to form homodimers, and cleavage occurs in such dimers (data not shown). The CreHis protein can form such dimers (data not shown) but cannot carry out cleavage in them. Mixing of the CreHis-bound B half-site with the Cre-bound X25 site had two effects: cleavage by the CreHis and by Cre of the X25 half-site were both greatly stimulated. As illustrated in Fig. 7a, Cre would cleave the X25 site trans-horizontally, whereas CreHis bound to the B half-site would be stimulated to cleave the X25 site trans-vertically, perhaps by virtue of its incorporation into a synaptic complex. If the positions of the proteins are reversed (not shown, CreHis on X25 site and Cre on B), trans-horizontal cleavage of the X25 site by CreHis might be stimulated by its incorporation into a synaptic complex with a homodimer of the Cre-bound B site. Alternatively, mixed dimers of X25-bound Cre and B-bound CreHis might assemble, and trans-horizontal cleavages of X25 by CreHis and trans-vertical cleavages of X25 by Cre might occur (Fig. 7b). Reversal of the locations of the two proteins would lead to the opposite result.Fig. 7Assembly of synaptic complexes from half-lox sites. a, synaptic complex of half-site homodimers. Cre (circles) bound to the X25 site forms homodimers and cleaves the site trans-horizontally. Synapsis with a dimer of B sites loaded with the CreHis protein (triangles) allows trans-vertical cleavage of the X25 site by CreHis. Reversal of the positions of the proteins would give a similar result. b, synaptic complex of half-site heterodimers. A heterodimer of an X25 half-site loaded with Cre (circle) forms a heterodimer with a B site loaded with CreHis (triangle) which cleaves the X25 site trans-horizontally. The Cre protein then cleaves another X25 site in the synaptic complex trans-vertically.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The use of a full-site removes some of the ambiguity caused by the use of complementing half-sites. The full-lox site bound by CreHis dramatically stimulated the cleavage of the X25 site by CreHis (Fig. 8a). Here the cleavages could be both trans-vertical/-diagonal or trans-horizontal. CreHis bound to the full-lox site (Fig. 8b) clearly complemented the cleavage defect of the CreHis Y324C protein bound to the X25 site. By definition this must have occurred by a trans-vertical or -diagonal mechanism. But, interestingly, the presence of a full-site loaded with a cleavage-incompetent Cre protein also greatly stimulated the cleavage of the X25 site by CreHis (Fig. 8c). We hypothesize that the occupied lox site may stabilize the X25 sites bound with CreHis in a higher order complex or synaptosome (Fig. 8c). In this structure the CreHis can now cleave, probably trans-horizontally. It should be noted that Qian and Cox (36Qian X. Cox M.M. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2053-2064Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) have recently proposed that an asymmetric complex consisting of three bound molecules of Flp protein is responsible for cleavage in the synaptic complex. In their model, cleavage takes place by both trans-horizontal and trans-vertical modes. Such a mixed mode of cleavage is compatible with our data for Cre.Fig. 8Assembly of synaptic complexes from full- and half-lox sites. a, CreHis (triangles) on the full-lox site cleaves an X25 half-site trans-vertically, and this stimulates another CreHis molecule in the synaptic complex to cleave trans-horizontally. b, CreHis on the full-lox site cleaves an X25 site occupied by the CreHis Y324C (squares) protein trans-vertically. c, the full-lox site is occupied by the cleavage-incompetent CreHis Y324C protein (squares). This mediates the assembly of a homodimer of the X25 site loaded with the CreHis (triangles) and stimulates the CreHis to cleave trans-horizontally.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Thus the mechanism of the Cre protein seems most closely parallel to the Flp paradigm. Flp was shown to cleave half-Flp recognition target sites in trans (10Chen J.-W. Lee J. Jayaram M. Cell. 1992; 69: 647-658Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar), and recent experiments support a trans-horizontal mechanism (12Lee J. Whang I. Lee J. Jayaram M. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5346-5354Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The Flp protein cleaves Holliday junctions in trans (14Dixon J.E. Shaikh A.C. Sadowski P.D. Molec. Microbiol. 1995; 18: 449-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), whereas the Î» integrase cleaves such structures in cis (21Nunes-DÃ¼by S.E. Tirumalai R.S. Dorgai L. Yagil E. Weisberg R.A. Landy A. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4421-4430Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). A recent alignment of the integrase family members by Blakely and Sherratt (37Blakely G.W. Sherratt D.J. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 20: 234-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) suggested a possible correlation between the spacing of a conserved glycine residue (314 of Cre) and the nucleophilic tyrosine (324 of Cre) and the ability to cleave in trans. The spacing was 10-11 amino acids for the prokaryotic members of the family, two of which are known to cleave in cis, but was 14 amino acids for the eukaryotic members (Flp and Flp-like proteins), two of which have been shown to cleave in trans. However, the Cre protein cleaves in trans in spite of a spacing of 11 amino acids between the glycine and the nucleophilic tyrosine. On the other hand, both Cre and Flp have simple target sites, have relaxed topological requirements, and can perform the entire reaction in vitro without addition of accessory factors. It is possible that the ability to cleave in trans is a reflection of the relative simplicity of the Cre and Flp reactions. INTRODUCTIONSite-specific recombination occurs in a multiprotein-DNA complex whose proper assembly ensures that the reaction progresses in an orderly manner (1Craig N.L. Annu. Rev.

Recombination occurs following two pairs of strand exchanges and ligation of the DNAs in a novel (recombinant) form.The canonical DNA target site for conservative site-specific recombinases consists of two inverted recombinase-binding sites that surround an âoverlapâ or âcoreâ region. DNA cleavage and subsequent strand exchanges take place on the top or bottom strands at the margins of this core. (In the lox site, the target of the Cre recombinase, we define this core region as the 6 bp between the top and bottom strand cleavage sites.) The DNA cleavage event promoted by site-specific recombinases is catalyzed by a nucleophilic hydroxylated amino acid. A serine is used by the resolvase/invertase family members (6Grindley N.D.F. Science. 1993; 262: 738-740Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), whereas the integrase family members use tyrosine (7Argos P. Landy A. Abremski K. Egan J.B. Haggard-Ljungquist E. Hoess R.H.

Cell. 1983; 32: 1301-1311Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). Its biological function is to resolve dimeric P1 plasmids to monomers and hence to aid partition of the plasmid (24Austin S. Ziese M. Sternberg N. Cell. 1981; 25: 729-736Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). Cre catalyzes reciprocal recombination between its lox sites (Fig. 1). The lox sites are similar to the Flp recognition target sites of Flp in both overall architecture and actual sequence (25Vetter D. Andrews B.J. Roberts-Beatty L. Sadowski P.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 7284-7288Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Furthermore, both the Cre and Flp proteins promote efficient recombination in vitro without the requirement for any accessory proteins. We have used half- and full-lox sites to show that the Cre protein, like the Flp protein, executes cleavage in trans. These studies extend the diversity of the cleavage mechanisms among the members of the integrase family. This is the first example of a prokaryotic member of the integrase family that cleaves in trans. DISCUSSIONThe results presented in this paper support a trans cleavage mechanism for the Cre recombinase. A cleavage-competent Cre protein (either Cre or CreHis) when bound to a noncleavable half-lox site (B) was able to complement the cleavage defect of CreHis Y324C or Cre25. This effect was not due to dissociation of the cleavage-competent Cre from its half-site and its reassociation with the partner site (Figs. 4a and 5). The results were strengthened by the finding that cleavage of the X25 site by the CreHis protein was greatly stimulated by the presence of the Cre protein bound to a full- or half-lox site. (Fig. 4, Fig. 5, Fig. 6). Finally, we found that the stimulation of cleavage was sensitive to dilution; diluting the prebinding mixtures into a greater volume caused a diminution of cleavage. This suggests that cleavage requires an intermolecular reaction and hence does not occur in cis.Do our results provide any information about the mode of cleavage, i.e. does it occur by a trans-horizontal, trans-vertical, or trans-diagonal mechanism? The use of half-sites makes an assignment of a cleavage mode difficult and, in part, semantic. However, the fact that Cre (although not CreHis) cleaves the X25 half-site is compatible with the formation of a homodimeric complex (Fig. 7a) followed by cleavage in a trans-horizontal mode. Cre bound to the X25 half-site is able to form homodimers, and cleavage occurs in such dimers (data not shown). The CreHis protein can form such dimers (data not shown) but cannot carry out cleavage in them. Mixing of the CreHis-bound B half-site with the Cre-bound X25 site had two effects: cleavage by the CreHis and by Cre of the X25 half-site were both greatly stimulated. As illustrated in Fig. 7a, Cre would cleave the X25 site trans-horizontally, whereas CreHis bound to the B half-site would be stimulated to cleave the X25 site trans-vertically, perhaps by virtue of its incorporation into a synaptic complex. If the positions of the proteins are reversed (not shown, CreHis on X25 site and Cre on B), trans-horizontal cleavage of the X25 site by CreHis might be stimulated by its incorporation into a synaptic complex with a homodimer of the Cre-bound B site. Alternatively, mixed dimers of X25-bound Cre and B-bound CreHis might assemble, and trans-horizontal cleavages of X25 by CreHis and trans-vertical cleavages of X25 by Cre might occur (Fig. 7b). Reversal of the locations of the two proteins would lead to the opposite result.The use of a full-site removes some of the ambiguity caused by the use of complementing half-sites. The full-lox site bound by CreHis dramatically stimulated the cleavage of the X25 site by CreHis (Fig. 8a). Here the cleavages could be both trans-vertical/-diagonal or trans-horizontal. CreHis bound to the full-lox site (Fig. 8b) clearly complemented the cleavage defect of the CreHis Y324C protein bound to the X25 site. By definition this must have occurred by a trans-vertical or -diagonal mechanism. But, interestingly, the presence of a full-site loaded with a cleavage-incompetent Cre protein also greatly stimulated the cleavage of the X25 site by CreHis (Fig. 8c). We hypothesize that the occupied lox site may stabilize the X25 sites bound with CreHis in a higher order complex or synaptosome (Fig. 8c). In this structure the CreHis can now cleave, probably trans-horizontally. It should be noted that Qian and Cox (36Qian X. Cox M.M. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2053-2064Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) have recently proposed that an asymmetric complex consisting of three bound molecules of Flp protein is responsible for cleavage in the synaptic complex. In their model, cleavage takes place by both trans-horizontal and trans-vertical modes. Such a mixed mode of cleavage is compatible with our data for Cre.Fig. 8Assembly of synaptic complexes from full- and half-lox sites. a, CreHis (triangles) on the full-lox site cleaves an X25 half-site trans-vertically, and this stimulates another CreHis molecule in the synaptic complex to cleave trans-horizontally. b, CreHis on the full-lox site cleaves an X25 site occupied by the CreHis Y324C (squares) protein trans-vertically. c, the full-lox site is occupied by the cleavage-incompetent CreHis Y324C protein (squares).

Flp was shown to cleave half-Flp recognition target sites in trans (10Chen J.-W. Lee J. Jayaram M.

Microbiol. 1996; 20: 234-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) suggested a possible correlation between the spacing of a conserved glycine residue (314 of Cre) and the nucleophilic tyrosine (324 of Cre) and the ability to cleave in trans. The spacing was 10-11 amino acids for the prokaryotic members of the family, two of which are known to cleave in cis, but was 14 amino acids for the eukaryotic members (Flp and Flp-like proteins), two of which have been shown to cleave in trans. However, the Cre protein cleaves in trans in spite of a spacing of 11 amino acids between the glycine and the nucleophilic tyrosine. On the other hand, both Cre and Flp have simple target sites, have relaxed topological requirements, and can perform the entire reaction in vitro without addition of accessory factors. It is possible that the ability to cleave in trans is a reflection of the relative simplicity of the Cre and Flp reactions. The results presented in this paper support a trans cleavage mechanism for the Cre recombinase.

Binding led to changes in tertiary structure as witnessed by an increase in tryptophan fluorescence, a red shift of the tryptophan maximum emission wavelength, and a change in the near UV CD spectrum. In contrast to what was observed for the soluble form of the toxin, 78% of the tryptophan residues in the membrane-bound form were accessible to the hydrophilic quencher KI. At this stage, the tryptophan residues were not in the immediate vicinity of the lipid bilayer. Upon membrane insertion, a second conformational change occurred resulting in a dramatic drop of the near UV CD signal but an increase of the far UV signal. Tryptophan residues were no longer accessible to KI but could be quenched by brominated lipids.

Sf9 insect cells were grown in TNM-FH medium with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum and 100 Î¼g of gentamicin/ml. Approximately 3 Ã 106 insect cells were infected with baculovirus encoding either a protein tyrosine phosphatase MEG-01 that served as a ânegative controlâ (34Gu M. York J.D. Warshawsky I.

For assays of enzyme activity, the cells were harvested from 60-mm dishes 3 days after infection and sonicated in 300 Î¼l of Tris, pH 7.5 (20 mM), NaCl (150 mM), MgCl2 (3 mM), EGTA (2 mM), Î²-mercaptoethanol (10 mM), phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (1 mM), benzamidine (10 Î¼g/ml), pepstatin A (1 Î¼M), and leupeptin (10 Î¼g/ml).

Assay of 5-phosphatase activity using [32P]Ins(1,4,5)P3, [3H]Ins(1,3,4,5)P4, and [3H]PtdIns(4,5)P2 was as described (35Connolly T.M. Bross T.E. Majerus P.W. J. Biol.

Chem. 1994; 269: 8716-8720Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using vesicles composed of 0.5 mg of PtdIns(4,5)P2 and 0.5 mg of phosphatidylserine and recombinant PtdIns 3-kinase (39Hu Q. Klippel A. Muslin A.J. Fantl W.J. Williams L.T. Science. 1995; 268: 100-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar) immunoprecipitated from COS cell lysates with antibody directed against an HA tag in 1 ml. TLC purified [32P]PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 was evaporated under N2 with phosphatidylserine and resuspended into vesicles with approximately 0.5 mg of phosphatidylserine/ml. Reaction mixtures (25 Î¼l) contained the indicated amounts of Sf9 supernatant in Tris, pH 7.5 (50 Î¼M), MgCl2 (10 mM), and 600-1500 cpm of [32P]PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 in vesicles with 2.5 Î¼g of phosphatidylserine. Reaction mixtures were incubated at 37Â°C for up to 30 min. Hydrolysis was determined as described (38Norris F.A. Majerus P.W. J. Biol.

The products formed from incubation of SIP-110 with [3H]Ins(1,3,4,5)P4 were separated by HPLC on an Adsorbosphere SAX column equilibrated in 20 mM NH4H2PO4 at pH 3.5. Products were eluted with a linear gradient from 0 to 0.75 M NH4H2PO4 over 100 min. The products formed from incubation of SIP-110 product with inositol polyphosphate-1-phosphatase (40York J.D.

Auethavekiat V. Majerus P.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16128-16133Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) were separated by HPLC on a Partisil 10 SAX column equilibrated in 40 mM ammonium formate/formic acid, pH 3.5. Products were eluted with ammonium formate/formic acid, pH 3.5, 60-400 mM for 30 min, 800-1300 mM for 33 min, 1300-1850 mM for the next 10 min, and 1850-3000 for the final 46 min. One-ml fractions were collected, and radioactivity was measured in a liquid scintillation counter. All immunoblotting was done with anti-HA antibody used at 120 ng/ml. Secondary antibody was horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG from Bio-Rad (1:5000 dilution), and blots were developed using ECL (Amersham). For experiments determining the association of SIP-110 with GRB2, Sf9 cells expressing SIP-110, native GRB2, GRB2 dbm, or GRB3.3 were lysed in Tris, pH 8 (20 mM), NaCl (140 mM), glycerol (10%), Triton X-100 (1%), MgCl2 (3 mM), phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (1 mM), benzamidine (10 Î¼g/ml), pepstatin A (1 Î¼M), and leupeptin (10 Î¼g/ml). Lysates were centrifuged at 16,000 Ã g for 10 min and the relative amount of recombinant protein in each lysate was determined by Western blotting with anti-HA antibody. Equimolar amounts of SIP-110 and GRB2 were mixed with either anti-Myc or anti-HA antibody in a 1:50 dilution and incubated at 4Â°C overnight. Protein A-Sepharose (20 Î¼l 50%) was added for 3 h and the protein A-Sepharose pellet was washed three times in the lysis buffer described above and three times in Tris, pH 7.5 (50 mM), and MgCl2 (3 mM). Equal portions of each pellet were assayed for SIP-110 Ins(1,3,4,5)P4 hydrolyzing activity or Western blotting with anti-HA antibody. For experiments using bacterial GRB2, GRB2 was purified on glutathione-agarose according to standard protocols and the amount of GRB2 was measured as absorbance at 280 nm. This GRB2 was mixed with SIP-110 from non-detergent-containing supernatants of Sf9 cells prepared as described for enzyme assays and assayed for hydrolysis of Ins(1,3,4,5)P4 or PtdIns(3,4,5)P3. We expressed SIP-110 in Sf9 cells and assayed the soluble crude recombinant enzyme for the ability to hydrolyze soluble inositol polyphosphates. Hydrolysis of [3H]Ins(1,3,4,5)P4 to an apparent InsP3 product was Mg2+ dependent while extracts from Sf9 cells expressing an irrelevant tyrosine phosphatase as a control did not hydrolyze this substrate. We confirmed that substrate hydrolysis in Sf9 supernatants expressing SIP-110 was due to the SIP-110 by immunoprecipitating that protein with a monoclonal antibody to a hemagglutinin (HA) tag at the N terminus of the recombinant protein. Increasing amounts of antibody depleted InsP4 hydrolyzing activity from Sf9 supernantants and resulted in appearance of activity in the protein A-Sepharose pellet (Fig. 1A). Amounts of antiserum required to immunoprecipitate InsP4 hydrolyzing activity correlated with the amount of antiserum necessary to immunoprecipitate SIP-110 protein as determined by Western blotting with anti-HA antiserum (Fig. 1B). We next determined the product of SIP-110 hydrolysis of Ins(1,3,4,5)P4. [3H]Ins(1,3,4,5)P4 was hydrolyzed to completion with recombinant SIP-110 and the reaction mixture was chromatographed by Adsorbosphere SAX HPLC. The product eluted as a single peak in the position of Ins(1,3,4)P3, slightly earlier than a [32P]Ins(1,4,5)P3 internal standard (Fig. 2A). To confirm that the product of SIP-110 is Ins(1,3,4)P3, we further hydrolyzed this product with two other purified recombinant inositol polyphosphate phosphatases that remove specific phosphates from Ins(1,3,4)P3. Inositol polyphosphate-1-phosphatase further converted the SIP-110 product [3H]InsP3 to an [3H]InsP2 that eluted from Partisil 10 SAX HPLC slower than the [32P]Ins(1,4)P2 internal standard in the position of Ins(3,4)P2 (41Norris F.A. Auethavekiat V. Majerus P.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16128-16133Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2B). Inositol polyphosphate-4-phosphatase converted the SIP-110 [3H]InsP3 product to an [3H]InsP2 that eluted from Partisil 10 SAX HPLC faster than the [32P]Ins(1,4)P2 internal standard in the position of Ins(1,3)P2 (42Bansal V.S. Inhorn R.C. Majerus P.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 9444-9447Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 2C). Thus SIP-110 is an inositol polyphosphate-5-phosphatase that converts Ins(1,3,4,5)P4 to Ins(1,3,4)P3. Of all soluble inositol polyphosphates tested as substrates for SIP-110, only Ins(1,3,4,5)P4 was hydrolyzed (Table I). Most interestingly, there was no detectable hydrolysis of [32P]Ins(1,4,5)P3 in numerous experiments performed under a wide range of pH conditions with a variety of salt and metal ion additions. This specificity for Ins(1,3,4,5)P4 is distinct from the substrate specificity of other cloned or described 5-phosphatases that hydrolyze Ins(1,4,5)P3 in addition to Ins(1,3,4,5)P4. A number of unlabeled inositol phosphate isomers were tested for their ability to serve as inhibitors of the hydrolysis of Ins(1,3,4,5)P4 by SIP-110. Only two isomers, Ins(1,3,4)P3 and Ins(1,5,6)P3 gave greater inhibition than additional unlabeled Ins(1,3,4,5)P4 substrate at the concentrations tested. Inhibition by Ins(1,3,4)P3 most likely reflects product inhibition. Ins(1,5,6)P3 was identified as a product of the metabolism of InsP5 from avian erythrocytes (43Stephens L.R. Downes C.P. Biochem. J. 1990; 265: 435-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar).

Open table in a new tab The substrate concentration dependence of hydrolysis of Ins(1,3,4,5)P4 was measured as shown in Fig. 3. Purified SIP-110 hydrolyzed [3H]Ins(1,3,4,5)P4 to Ins(1,3,4)P3 with a Km of 16 Â± 2.1 Î¼M (S.E., n = 4) and a Vm of 9.3 Â± 1.4 Î¼mol/min/mg SIP-110 protein. The catalytic efficiency of this enzyme towards Ins(1,3,4,5)P2 (Vm/Km) is 0.58 indicating that it is the best enzyme in utilizing this substrate compared to the other 5-phosphatases studied to date (29Zhang S. Jefferson A.B. Auethavekiat V. Majerus P.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4853-4856Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). A number of inositol polyphosphate-5-phosphatases have recently been shown to hydrolyze phosphatidylinositol phosphates. Consequently, we tested SIP-110 for its ability to hydrolyze PtdIns(4,5)P2 and PtdIns(3,4,5)P3. SIP-110 hydrolyzes [32P]PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 in a concentration (Fig. 4A) and time (data not shown) dependent manner. We detected no hydrolysis of [3H]PtdIns(4,5)P2 under a variety of conditions with amounts of SIP-110 1000-fold greater than were necessary to detect hydrolysis of PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 (Fig. 4A). We also tested three additional recombinant 5-phosphatases, 5-phosphatase I, 5-phosphatase II, and OCRL for their ability to hydrolyze [32P]PtdIns(3,4,5)P3. OCRL and 5-phosphatase II hydrolyze [32P]PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 to [32P]PtdInsP2 (Fig. 4B). 5-Phosphatase I which does not hydrolyze PtdIns(4,5)P2 (44Matzaris M. Jackson S.P. Laxminarayan K.M. Speed C.J. Mitchell C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3397-3402Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) also failed to hydrolyze [32P]PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 even with 10-fold more enzyme than was necessary to detect hydrolysis by active 5-phosphatases (Fig. 4B). We compared the three active 5-phosphatases in their ability to hydrolyze [32P]PtdIns(3,4,5)P3. OCRL had the highest first-order rate constant (21.5 Â± 4.5/min after 1 and 3 min of hydrolysis). 5-Phosphatase II and SIP-110 hydrolyzed [32P]PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 with first-order rate constants of 2.5 Â± 1.0/min and 1.3 Â± 0.5/min, respectively, after 1 and 3 min of hydrolysis. Thus, at least three 5-phosphatases can utilize PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 as a substrate. Consistent with its preference for PtdIns(4,5)P2 as a substrate when compared to Ins(1,4,5)P3 and Ins(1,3,4,5)P4, OCRL also rapidly hydrolyzes PtdIns(3,4,5)P3. We confirmed that the SIP-110 protein was responsible for both the IP4 and PrdIns(3,4,5)P3 hydrolyzing activity by examining the heat intactivation of purified SIP-110 at 42Â°C. The IP4 hydrolyzing activity and the PtdInsP3 hydrolyzing activity inactivate at essentially the same rate proving that the two activities reside in the same protein (Fig. 5). Further confirmation came from studies using SIP-110 with a mutation of aspartic acid 460 to alanine in the region of homology to other 5-phosphatases. A similar mutation in 5-phosphatase type II resulted in an inactive enzyme. SIP-110 D460A had no activity for either InsP4 or PtdInsP3 (Ref. 45Jefferson A.B. Majerus P.W. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 7890-7894Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, data not shown). SIP-110 was initially cloned as a GRB2-binding protein. We next determined the stoichiometry of GRB2 binding to SIP-110 and whether the binding affected enzyme activity. In the experiment shown in Fig. 6, we mixed HA-tagged SIP-110 from Sf9 cell detergent lysates with equimolar amounts of native or mutant Myc-, HA-tagged GRB2. GRB2 dbm contains an inactivating single point mutation in each SH3 domain that inhibits association of SIP-110 in COS cells (19Burgering B.M.T. Cotter P.J. Nature. 1995; 376: 599-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (1880) Google Scholar). GRB3.3 contains an inactivating SH2 domain deletion while retaining functional SH3 domains (31Fath I. Schweighoffer F. Rey I. Multon M-C. Boiziau J. Duchesne M. Tocque B. Science. 1994; 264: 971-974Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). We immunoprecipitated the GRB2 with antiserum to its Myc epitope and analyzed the association of SIP-110 with GRB2 by Western blotting with anti-HA antiserum or by assaying for [3H]Ins(1,3,4,5)P4 hydrolysis. As shown in Fig. 6A, SIP-110 associates with native GRB2 in a stoichiometry of 1 GRB2:0.7 SIP-110 (0.7 Â± 0.1, n = 5), suggesting that the stoichiometry likely is 1:1. SIP-110 failed to bind in detectable amounts to GRB2 dbm confirming that the binding of SIP-110 is via the SH3 domains of GRB2. SIP-110 also binds to GRB3.3 although less well than to native GRB2 (ratio of GRB2 to SIP-110 is 12:1). We then assayed each immunoprecipitate for [3H]Ins(1,3,4,5)P4 hydrolyzing activity. As shown in Fig. 6B, there was [3H]Ins(1,3,4,5)P4 hydrolyzing activity in each GRB2 immunoprecipitate that contained SIP-110 protein. As a more accurate estimation of enzyme activity when associated with GRB2, we mixed SIP-110 with native GRB2 or GRB2 dbm as for immunoprecipitations above, but assayed SIP-110 activity without addition of antiserum or protein A-Sepharose. SIP-110 supernatant hydrolyzed 5.5 Â± 1.8 pmol of [3H]InsP4/min after incubation with equimolar amounts of native GRB2 supernatant and 5.2 Â± 1.2 pmol of [3H]InsP4/min after incubation with equimolar amounts of GRB2 dbm supernatant. Since these experiments were done with detergent lysates of GRB2 and SIP-110 and it was possible this might interfere with an effect of GRB2 on activity, we repeated them using bacterially-expressed GRB2 and SIP-110 from non-detergent cell sonicates. We assayed 0.3 pmol of SIP-110 with increasing amounts of purified bacterial"
https://openalex.org/W1999527118,"Based on the finding that a series of engineered proOmpAs containing disulfide-bridged loops of different sizes at different positions exhibits a discontinuous mode of polypeptide transit across the cytoplasmic membrane of Escherichia coli, we suggested previously that the translocation of preproteins takes place at every 30 amino acid residues (Uchida, K., Mori, H., and Mizushima, S. (1995) J. Biol. Chem. 270, 30862-30868). In the present study, we investigated the molecular mechanism underlying this stepwise translocation. Deletion or relocation of hydrophobic segments of the mature domain of proOmpA (H1, residues 233-237; H2, residues 261-265) significantly altered the pattern of the stepwise translocation. The stepwise mode of polypeptide insertion was also observed with reconstituted proteoliposomes comprising purified SecA, SecY, and SecE. Cross-linking experiments involving a photoactivable cross-linker revealed that SecY and SecA are the components which interact with the hydrophobic segment of proOmpA. The present results indicate that the hydrophobic segments of the mature domains of preproteins interact with membrane embedded translocase during polypeptide transit across the membrane, which causes a discontinuous mode of polypeptide movement."

We introduced one of these mutations, Asp-556 â Gly, into the rat LH/hCG receptor and demonstrated that the mutant receptor constitutively activated adenylate cyclase in transfected 293 T cells. The cell surface expression of the mutant receptor was lower than that of the wild type receptor. Pulse-chase studies showed that the 73-kDa precursor of both the mutant and wild type receptors was synthesized at comparable efficiencies. However, post-translational processing of the mutant receptor to the mature 92-kDa form, which has N-linked complex type oligosaccharide chains, was impaired. Sensitivity of the mutant receptor to peptide-N-glycanase F and endoglycosidase H, and insensitivity to sialidase indicated that the 73-kDa species represents the high mannose form that has not yet been trafficked through the medial and trans Golgi. Additionally, although the wild type receptor was palmitoylated, the mutant receptor was not. Although the high mannose 73-kDa species is capable of binding LH/hCG, our results show that post-translational processing in the Golgi is required for the mature 92-kDa receptor to reach the cell surface.

Gunaga K.P. Fertil. Steril. 1974; 25: 732-750Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The interaction of LH/hCG with its receptor activates adenylate cyclase, resulting in an increase in cyclic AMP that stimulates steroid hormone production (2Kawate N. Menon K.M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30651-30658Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 3Segaloff D.L. Ascoli M. Endocr. Rev. 1993; 14: 324-347PubMed Google Scholar, 4Hunzicker-Dunn M. Birmbaumer L. Ascoli M. Luteinizing Hormone Action and Receptors. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1985: 57-134Google Scholar). The LH/hCG receptor belongs to the family of Gs protein-coupled receptors, and the deduced amino acid sequence of the LH/hCG receptor contains an extracellular domain, a seven-helix transmembrane domain, and a cytoplasmic carboxyl terminus region (5McFarland K.C.

Recently, constitutively activating mutations of the receptor have been identified that are associated with male precocious puberty (6Shenker S. Laue L. Kosugi S. Merendino Jr., J.J. Takashi M.

One of the constitutively activating mutations involves a single base transition from A to G in the LH/hCG receptor gene. This mutation results in the substitution of glycine for aspartic acid 578 in the sixth transmembrane domain of the receptor (6Shenker S. Laue L. Kosugi S. Merendino Jr., J.J. Takashi M. Cutler Jr., G.B. Nature. 1993; 365: 652-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (646) Google Scholar).Pulse-chase studies have shown that the LH/hCG receptor is synthesized as a precursor protein, which is processed post-translationally to a mature form of 85-92 kDa (2Kawate N. Menon K.M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30651-30658Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14Hipkin R.W. Sanchez-Yague J. Ascoli M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 2210-2218Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The post-translational events involve processing of N-linked high mannose oligosaccharides to complex N-linked oligosaccharides. Additionally, conserved cysteine residues present in the cytoplasmic tail undergo palmitoylation (2Kawate N. Menon K.M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30651-30658Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Zhu H. Wang H. Ascoli M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 141-150Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The mature receptor is then trafficked to the cell surface. Since our initial 125I-labeled hCG binding assays suggested that there were fewer mutant receptors than wild type receptors at the cell surface, we examined whether the processing and subsequent trafficking of the mutant receptor to the cell surface differs from that of the wild type receptor. We now present evidence to show that the cell surface expression of the mutant receptor is greatly reduced due to its inability to undergo processing in the Golgi.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials[3H]Palmitic acid (35.9 Ci/mmol), [3H]mannose (21 Ci/mmol), and Entensifyâ¢ were purchased from Dupont NEN.

Plasmids were purified before transfection either by two cesium chloride-ethidium bromide density gradient centrifugations or with Qiagen 2500 columns.Transient Expression of LH/hCG Receptor cDNA293T cells were grown in DMEM containing 4500 mg/liter glucose, 50 Î¼g/ml gentamicin, 2 units/ml nystatin, 10 mM Hepes, and 10% fetal bovine serum at 37Â°C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2. Exponentially growing 293 T cells were plated 6-9 h before transfection at cell densities of 2-3 Ã 106 cells/60-mm plate and 5-8 Ã 106 cells/100-mm plate. The 293 T cells were transfected by a calcium phosphate coprecipitation technique with 4 or 10 Î¼g of LH/hCG receptor cDNA constructs into 60- and 100-mm plates, respectively. Mock transfections were carried out using the pCMV4 vector lacking the LH/hCG receptor cDNA. The cells were subjected to the following analyses 60 h after transfection.125I-hCG Binding to Intact Transfected CellsHighly purified hCG (CR-127) was radioiodinated with chloramine T (17Azhar S. Menon K.M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 256: 6548-6555Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). Binding of 125I-hCG to intact transfected 293 T cells was performed as described previously (2Kawate N. Menon K.M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30651-30658Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, the cells were incubated at 4Â°C for 20 h (1-2 Ã 105 cells/tube) with increasing concentrations of 125I-hCG (0.45-90 ng/ml) in the presence or absence of a 1,000-fold excess of unlabeled hCG in a final volume of 0.4 ml. All determinations were performed in duplicate, and the binding affinity and maximal binding capacity were calculated with the Ligand program (18Munson P.J. Rodbard D. Anal. Biochem. 1980; 107: 220-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (7760) Google Scholar). The DNA content of the cells was measured by the method of Burton (19Burton K. Biochem.

Puett D. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 3986-3993Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The cells were washed free of DMEM and detached with 6 ml of ice-cold Buffer A (20 mM Hepes, pH 7.4, 0.15 M NaCl) containing protease inhibitors (5 mM EDTA, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mM benzamidine, 5 mM N-ethylmaleimide, 2 Î¼M leupeptin, and 2 Î¼M E64). The cell suspensions (1.5 ml) were centrifuged at 2,000 Ã g, and the cell pellets were resuspended in 0.24 ml of 1% Nonidet P-40 and 20% glycerol in Buffer A containing protease inhibitors. The cells were incubated on ice with vortexing for 10 s every 10 min, and at 30 min were pelleted at 12,000 Ã g for 15 min. The supernatant was diluted with 0.96 ml of 20% glycerol in Buffer A containing the protease inhibitors. The solubilized extracts (0.2 ml) were incubated with 90 ng/ml 125I-hCG at 4Â°C for 20 h in the presence or absence of a 1,000-fold excess of unlabeled hCG in a final assay volume of 0.4 ml (see Table II). For the Scatchard analysis, the concentrations of 125I-hCG used ranged from 1 to 90 ng/ml. After the incubation, the extracts were added to Whatman GF/B filters that had been soaked at least 1 h in 0.3% polyethylenimine in 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 9.1 (21Roche P. Bergert E.R. Ryan R.J. Endocrinology. 1985; 117: 790-792Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) and washed five times with phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1 M NaCl, 10 mM NaN3, and 1 mg/ml BSA. The filters were counted in a gamma counter. Total binding was established in triplicate and nonspecific binding in duplicate. Each assay was repeated twice and the data presented are representative of the results of a typical experiment.Table IISpecific binding of 125I-hCG to intact or solubilized 293 T cells expressing wild type or D556G LH/hCG receptorsReceptorIntact cellsSolubilized cellsSolubilized/Intactfmol 125I-hCG bound/Î¼g DNAWild type5348 Â± 205739 Â± 2281.1D556G1664 Â± 594419 Â± 1422.7 Open table in a new tab Cyclic AMP MeasurementsMeasurement of cyclic AMP followed the competitive protein binding assay of Gilman and Murad (22Gilman A.G.

All the determinations were performed in replicates of six, and the data were analyzed using the computer program Prism (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA).[35S]Cysteine Labeling and Chasing of Transfected CellsMedium was removed from 60-mm dishes and the transfected cells were preincubated at 37Â°C for 20 min in 6 ml of cysteine-free DMEM containing 10 mM Hepes (cysteine-free medium). The medium was replaced with 2 ml of cysteine-free medium containing 100 Î¼Ci/ml [35S]cysteine and incubated under 5% CO2 at 37Â°C for 1.5 h. The cells were then either processed for receptor purification or incubated for an additional 1-6 h as indicated in the figures in 4 ml of DMEM (4500 mg/liter) containing 50 Î¼g/ml gentamicin, 2 units/ml nystatin, 10 mM HEPES, and 10% fetal bovine serum.[3H]Mannose and [3H]Palmitic Acid Labeling of Transfected CellsDMEM (4500 mg/liter) was removed from 100-mm dishes, and the transfected cells were preincubated at 37Â°C in 10 ml of DMEM (1000 mg/liter glucose) containing 50 Î¼g/ml gentamicin, 2 units/ml nystatin, 10 mM Hepes, and 10% fetal bovine serum. After 20 min, the medium was replaced with 3.5 ml of the same solution containing 100 Î¼Ci of [3H]mannose and incubated under 5% CO2 at 37Â°C for 6 h. Labeling with [3H]palmitic acid was performed as described previously by our laboratory (2Kawate N. Menon K.M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30651-30658Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Purification of LH/hCG Receptor from Labeled Cells Using hCG-Affi-GelWe have previously described the means for the purification of the LH/hCG receptor using hCG-Affi-Gel (2Kawate N.

A. 1989; 86: 8294-8298Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Briefly, after solubilizing the cells, the supernatant was applied to Affi-Gel covalently linked to highly purified hCG. The affinity gel was maintained in suspension by end-over-end mixing at 4Â°C for 16 h. The gel was then washed several times, and the receptor eluted by incubation at room temperature for 15 min in 120 Î¼l of sample buffer (2% SDS, 10% glycerol, 20 mM EGTA, 0.5 mg/ml bromphenol blue, and 62.5 mM Tris, pH 6.8) containing a mixture of protease inhibitors (1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mM benzamidine, 1 mM N-ethylmaleimide, 2 Î¼M leupeptin, and 2 Î¼M E64). In reducing gels the sample buffer contained 50 mM dithiothreitol and 5%Î²-mercaptoethanol.Glycosidase Digestion of the Purified LH/hCG ReceptorFollowing elution from the Affi-Gel, the labeled receptor preparations were digested with one of the following glycosidases. For digestion with PNGase F, the receptor was eluted in 120 Î¼l of sample buffer containing 1%Î²-mercaptoethanol and denatured at 100Â°C for 10 min. Nonidet P-40 and PNGase F were added at final concentrations of 1% and 4 units/Î¼l, respectively, and the reaction mixture incubated at 37Â°C for 2 h. For digestion with Endo H or sialidase, the labeled receptor was eluted in 120 Î¼l of sample buffer containing 1%Î²-mercaptoethanol, 4 mM CaCl2, and no EGTA. After denaturation, Endo H or sialidase was added to give a final concentration of 4 units/Î¼l or 1.54 milliunits/Î¼l, respectively, and the samples were incubated at 37Â°C for 3 h. At the end of each incubation, the samples were heated to 95Â°C for 2 min. Immediately prior to SDS-PAGE, the samples were boiled for 10 min.SDS-PAGE, Fluorography, and AutoradiographyThe labeled proteins were subjected to 7.5% SDS-PAGE. The [35S]cysteine- and [3H] mannose-labeled proteins were electrophoresed under reducing conditions; the [3H]palmitic acid-labeled proteins were electrophoresed under nonreducing conditions. Fluorography was performed with Entensifyâ¢ according to the manufacturer's protocol. The gels were then dried at 80Â°C for 2 h and exposed to Kodak X-Omat AR film at â70Â°C for the times indicated in the figure legends.RESULTSThe conserved aspartic acid residue (556) in the sixth transmembrane domain of the rat LH/hCG receptor is analogous to aspartic acid 578 in the human LH/hCG receptor. Since the rat LH/hCG receptor is well characterized, aspartic acid 556 was mutated to glycine using site directed mutagenesis in order to produce a constitutively active form of the receptor. The mutant receptor was cloned into a mammalian expression vector, pCMV4, and expressed in human embryonic kidney cells expressing the large T antigen (293 T). Following transient transfection, the production of cyclic AMP in response to exogenous hCG was tested. Fig. 1 shows that cells transfected with mutant LH/hCG receptor cDNA produced cyclic AMP in the absence of hCG. The mutant receptor also responds in a dose dependent manner to increasing concentrations of hCG. At 100 ng/ml hCG, the highest concentration tested, the amount of cyclic AMP produced is similar to that seen in cells transfected with the wild type receptor. Thus, the D556G mutant rat receptor is constitutively activating like the D578G mutant human receptor, as has been shown previously (6Shenker S. Laue L. Kosugi S. Merendino Jr., J.J. Takashi M. Cutler Jr., G.B. Nature. 1993; 365: 652-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (646) Google Scholar). Assays of 125I-hCG binding to intact 293 T cells transiently transfected with either the wild type or the mutant receptor suggest that the number of mutant receptors at the cell surface is 4-fold lower than wild type (Fig. 2). However, the binding affinities (Kd) of the wild type and mutant receptors are similar (Table I).Fig. 2Binding of 125I-hCG to cell surface wild type or D556G LH/hCG receptor. 293 T cells were transiently transfected with wild type or D556G LH/hCG receptor and subjected to the 125I-hCG binding assay described under âExperimental Procedures.â Each point represents the mean Â± S.E. of three determinations for total binding and two determinations for nonspecific binding.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Table IBinding characteristics of the wild type and D556G LH/hCG receptors in 293 T cellsReceptorKdBmaxMfmol/Î¼g DNAWild type8.5 Ã 10â105.97D556G5.4 Ã 10â101.38 Open table in a new tab The possibility that the observed decrease in the cell surface expression of the mutant receptor was due to intracellular trapping was examined. When binding assays were performed at a saturating concentration of 125I-hCG using solubilized cells expressing the mutant receptor, a 3-fold increase in binding activity was observed over that seen, when the binding analysis was performed using intact cells (Table II). Solubilized cells expressing the wild type receptor showed only a slight increase in binding compared to the binding activity of intact cells. The increase in binding seen in cells expressing the mutant receptor is unlikely to be due to an increase in binding affinity. Scatchard analysis of 125I-hCG binding to solubilized cells revealed that the affinities of solubilized and cell surface mutant receptors are similar, with Kd values of 7.8 Ã 10â10M and 6.3 Ã 10â10M, respectively, (data not presented). These results demonstrate that the decreased cell surface expression of the mutant receptor is due to trapping of the receptor within the cell.Since the cell surface expression of the mutant receptor was lower than the wild type receptor, we investigated the differences in the processing of the mutant receptor that lead to diminished trafficking to the cell surface. For this purpose, 293 T cells expressing the wild type or mutant receptor were labeled with [35S]cysteine for 1.5 h and chased with unlabeled cysteine for up to 4 h. The labeled extracts were subjected to affinity chromatography on an hCG-Affi-Gel affinity matrix. An autoradiogram of the [35S]cysteine-labeled receptor is shown in Fig. 3. A prominent band corresponding to an apparent molecular mass of 73 kDa was visible at 0 h of chase in extracts of cells expressing the wild type receptor. In extracts of cells chased with unlabeled cysteine for 2 and 4 h, respectively, a decline in the 73-kDa band occurred with a concomitant increase in the 92-kDa species. The 92-kDa species represents the fully processed, post-translational, presumably cell surface receptor. In contrast, the mutant receptor shows a very different pattern during the same chase. The bulk of the 73-kDa species was not processed into the 92-kDa form; only a faint band of molecular mass approximating the 92-kDa species was seen in extracts of cells expressing the mutant receptor. These results suggest that the mutant receptor is not processed in the same manner as the wild type receptor.Fig. 3Pulse-chase labeling of wild type and D556G LH/hCG receptors expressed in 293 T cells. 293 T cells transiently transfected with wild type (WT) or D556G LH/hCG receptor were pulsed with [35S]cysteine for 1.5 h and chased in medium containing unlabeled cysteine for 0, 2, and 4 h. 293 T cells transfected with the vector pCMV4 (MT) were pulsed for 1.5 h and chased for 0 and 4 h. The labeled cells were solubilized and added to hCG-Affi-Gel columns. After elution, the bound materials were analyzed by SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions, followed by fluorography and autoradiography. The gel was exposed for 1 day.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Since the mutant receptor does not appear to undergo post-translational processing to the same extent as the wild type receptor, glycosylation studies were performed to elucidate possible differences in processing. The LH/hCG receptor is known to contain at least three complex type N-linked oligosaccharide chains (24Zhang R. Cai H. Fatima N. Buczko E. Dufau M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21722-21728Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 25PetÃ¤jÃ¤-Repo U.E. Biochem. J. 1994; 298: 361-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). It is also known that the synthesis of complex-type N-linked oligosaccharide chains begins with the cotranslational addition of core mannose rich oligosaccharide chains to the protein. These mannose rich chains are then trimmed and new sugars are added as the protein is processed through the Golgi (26Kornfeld R. Kornfeld S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1985; 54: 631-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (3751) Google Scholar). To determine whether the mutant receptor was glycosylated, cells expressing the wild type or mutant receptor were labeled with [35S]cysteine and chased with unlabeled cysteine for either 0, 1, 2, or 4 h. The receptors were solubilized, isolated, and then incubated in the presence or absence of PNGase F at 37Â°C for 2 h followed by SDS-PAGE. As shown in Fig. 4, the mutant receptor remained predominantly in the 73 kDa form at all chase times, whereas the wild type receptor was processed to the 92-kDa form with increasing chase times. After 4 h of chase, treatment of the wild type receptor with PNGase F removed the oligosaccharide chains from both the 92- and 73-kDa forms of the receptor to yield a 58-kDa species. Treatment of the mutant receptor with PNGase F also produced a 58- kDa species, demonstrating that the mutant receptor contains N-linked oligosaccharide chains.Fig. 4Digestion of labeled wild type and D556G LH/hCG receptors with PNGase F. 293 T cells transiently transfected with wild type (WT) or D556G LH/hCG receptor were pulsed with [35S]cysteine for 1.5 h and chased in medium containing unlabeled cysteine for 0, 1, 2, and 4 h. The labeled cells were solubilized and added to hCG-Affi-Gel columns. After elution, purified receptors from cells that had been chased for 4 h were treated with PNGase F (P) at 37Â°C for 2 h.

As shown in Fig. 5, the 73-kDa form of the wild type and mutant receptors incorporated [3H]mannose. It is of interest that a 92-kDa form was not visible for either the wild type or mutant receptor. Taken together, the results of the PNGase F digestion and [3H]mannose incorporation experiments demonstrate that the 73-kDa form of the mutant receptor contains N-linked oligosaccharides.Fig. 5Incorporation of [3H]mannose into wild type and D556G LH/hCG receptors. 293 T cells were transiently transfected with wild type (WT) or D556G LH/hCG receptor and labeled with [3H]mannose for 6 h.

Cells expressing the wild type or mutant receptor were labeled with [35S]cysteine for 1.5 h and chased for 2 h. After purification, the wild type and mutant receptors were treated with Endo H. Glycoproteins that have been processed beyond the endoplasmic reticulum are not expected to be sensitive Endo H (26Kornfeld R. Kornfeld S. Annu. Rev.

The 73-kDa form of both the mutant and wild type receptor, however, disappeared after Endo H digestion, coincident with the appearance of a 58-kDa band. Thus, susceptibility to Endo H treatment illustrates that the majority of the mutant receptor is unlikely to be processed beyond the cis Golgi.Fig. 6Endo H digestion of the labeled wild type and D556G LH/hCG receptors. 293 T cells transiently transfected with wild type (WT) or D556G LH/hCG receptor were pulsed with [35S]cysteine for 1.5 h and chased in medium containing unlabeled cysteine for 2 h.

Insertion of different deletions of the PAP I promoter region into the HindIII-XbaI restriction site of the pÎE1sp1B-CAT gave the pÎE1sp1B-CAT-317-PAP I, pÎE1sp1B-CAT-180-PAP I, pÎE1sp1B-CAT-118-PAP I, and pÎE1sp1B-CAT-61-PAP I vectors. These constructs contained nucleotides from position â317 to +10, â180 to +10, â118 to +10, and â61 to +10 of the PAP I promoter region, respectively (2Dusetti N. Frigerio J.M. Keim V. Dagorn J.C. Iovanna J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14470-14475Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To construct a positive control plasmid, 0.7 kilobase pairs of the cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter were excised from the pcDNA3 vector (Invitrogen) and then inserted into the pÎE1sp1B-CAT. The vector was named pÎE1sp1B-CAT-CMV. Recombinant adenovirus containing different PAP I promoter regions and/or the CMV promoter driving the CAT reporter gene were then obtained using cotransfection of these constructs and pJM17 (10Graham F.L. Smiley J. Russell W.C. Nairn R. J. Gen. Virol. 1977; 36: 59-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (3445) Google Scholar) in 293 cells. As a negative control, Ad.CAT adenovirus was constructed using the pÎE1sp1B-CAT plasmid. Adenoviral vectors were cloned by plaque assay, and isolated lysis plaques were used to amplify the virus as described previously (11Graham F.L. Prevec L. Methods Mol. Biol. 1991; 7: 109-128PubMed Google Scholar). Structures of all recombinant adenovirus vectors were confirmed by restriction mapping. Large scale production of recombinant adenovirus was performed in 293 cells grown in 15-cm culture dishes. The cells were grown using Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS), 4 mM glutamine, 50 units/ml penicillin, and 50 Î¼g/ml streptomycin. Infected cells were harvested by shaking 48 h post-infection and centrifuged at 1000 rpm for 10 min. The cell pellet was resuspended in 1/10 volumes of Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and lysed by freezing and thawing five times. The cell debris were removed by centrifugation. Then, the supernatant was centrifuged over a two-layer CsCl cushion (2.4 ml of density, 1.6 g/liter and 2.4 ml of density, 1.3 g/liter in 10 mM Tris, pH 8.0), for 1 h at 90,000 Ã g. The virus band was harvested, diluted in a CsCl solution (density 1.34 g/liter in 10 mMTris, pH 8.0), and centrifuged at 90.000 Ã g for 18 h. The main virus band was then collected, and excessive CsCl was removed by dialysis against PBS at 4Â°C overnight. Adenoviral vectors were titered by plaque assay on 293 cells, and the titer ranged between 1010 and 1011 plaque-forming units (pfu)/ml. 48 h before infection, AR-42J cells were plated in 6-cm plates at 1 Ã 106 cells per dish in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% FCS, 4 mM glutamine, 50 units/ml penicillin, and 50 Î¼g/ml streptomycin. The cells were infected in the same medium with 1% FCS at 10 pfu/cell during 90 min. Then, the medium was supplemented to 10% FCS and incubated for an additional 16 h. The medium was then aspirated and replaced by fresh medium containing 10% FCS. 48 h after infection, the medium was removed and replaced by current fresh medium containing 10% FCS and the indicated amount of stimulant (IFNÎ³, TNFÎ±, interleukin-1, H2O2, dexamethasone, and IL-6 alone or in combination with dexamethasone). 16 h later, the cells were harvested and extracts prepared for CAT assays. The recombinant adenoviruses (2 Ã 109 pfu) in 200 Î¼l of phosphate-buffered saline were injected into male mice 6-8 weeks old via the tail vein. 48 h later, an acute pancreatitis was induced by intraperitoneal injection of caerulein (50 Î¼g/kg of body weight) six times at 1-h intervals (12Lampel M. Kern H. Virchows Arch. 1977; 373: 107-117Crossref Scopus (583) Google Scholar). 48 h after the induction of pancreatitis, animals were sacrificed and the different organs excised. Control animals were injected with saline. Acute pancreatitis was confirmed by light microscopy. Harvested cells were lysed with 1 Ã lysis buffer (Promega) as described previously (5Dusetti N. Ortiz E. Mallo G. Dagorn J.C. Iovanna J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22417-22421Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Mice were sacrificed by cervical dislocation. Tissues were excised from animals and homogenized in 40 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mM EDTA, 150 mM NaCl containing 2 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 mM dithiothreitol, 10 Î¼g/ml aprotinin, 10 Î¼g/ml leupeptine, 10 Î¼g/ml bestatine, 2 mM benzoyl arginine, and 5 mM benzamidine and lysed by three freeze-thaw cycles. The lysate was heated at 65Â°C for 10 min and centrifuged at 16,000 Ã g for 10 min. The protein concentration was measured by the Bradford assay using bovine serum albumin as standard (13Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (211906) Google Scholar). The protein extract (100 Î¼g) was then assayed for CAT activity using [14C]chloramphenicol as a substrate and a phase extraction procedure (14Seed B. Sheen J.Y. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 67: 271-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (830) Google Scholar). One-half of each pancreas was fixed in Bouin's solution and embedded in paraffin blocks. Deparaffinized sections (6 Î¼m) were treated with hydrogen peroxide in methanol to block endogenous peroxidase activity, hydrated, and preincubated in 5% bovine serum albumin for 1 h to reduce nonspecific background. Sections were incubated overnight at room temperature in a humid chamber with anti-CAT-Dioxigenin (Boehringer Mannheim), diluted 1:20 in 1% bovine serum albumin in PBS. Thereafter, the sections were rinsed in PBS containing 0,05% Tween 20, incubated for 2 h at 37Â°C with a 1:250 dilution of Anti-Dioxigenin-POD (Boehringer Mannheim), and washed with PBS, 0.05% Tween 20. Finally, the immunoreactions were visualized by the nickel-enhanced diaminobenzidine reaction (15Gallyas F. Merchenthaler I. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1988; 36: 807-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). As a control to our experimental system, we evaluated the ability of the adenovirus vector containing the CAT gene driven by the ubiquitous CMV promoter to express in AR-42J cells the CAT enzyme activity. High levels of CAT activity were obtained 48 h after the infection with Ad.CMV.CAT (data not shown). In addition, no CAT activity was observed when cells were infected with the promoterless Ad.CAT adenovirus (data not shown). We could therefore analyze in the same setup the capacity of expression and induction of the PAP I promoter. Recombinant Ad.PAP(â1253/+10).CAT virus was used to infect AR-42J cells that were treated in a number of ways. Cells were stimulated with IL-1, IFNÎ³, TNFÎ±, H2O2, IL-6, dexamethasone, or IL-6 with dexamethasone. 16 h later, the activity of the reporter was measured in AR-42J cell extracts (Fig. 1). CAT activity was strongly induced by IL-6 with dexamethasone (about 90-fold). A lower but significant induction (about 3-fold) was also obtained after induction with dexamethasone alone or with H2O2. However, basal CAT activity was not modified after induction with IL-1, IL-6, IFNÎ³, or TNFÎ±. These results are in agreement with the induction of the endogenous PAP I gene expression in these cells, except for the absence of induction with IFNÎ³ and TNFÎ±. To eliminate the possibility that viral context altered the response to IFNÎ³ and TNFÎ±, a plasmid containing the same region of the PAP I promoter (p-1253/+10PAPI-CAT) (5Dusetti N. Ortiz E. Mallo G. Dagorn J.C. Iovanna J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22417-22421Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) was used to transfect these cells, and similar results have actually been obtained. To determine the minimal promoter region responsible for these functional characteristics, several recombinant adenoviruses containing progressive deletions of the PAP I promoter were constructed and analyzed after transduction in AR-42J cells. First, we tested their activity in the absence of stimulation. As shown in Fig. 2, deletion in the 5â² to 3â² direction resulted in a stepwise decrease of CAT activity in the AR-42J cells extracts, suggesting that the â1253/+10 region of the promoter contained more functional cis-acting elements than the other tested constructs. Second, to determine their capacity to respond to each stimulus, AR-42J cells were transduced with each recombinant adenovirus and then stimulated with different potential inductors. Fig. 3 shows that Ad.PAP(â1253/+10).CAT and Ad.PAP(â317/+10).CAT responded to dexamethasone, alone or in combination with IL-6, and to H2O2. Although the ratio (stimulated/non-stimulated) for both constructs was very similar, the absolute CAT activity values were lower for Ad.PAP(â317/+10).CAT. The Ad.PAP(â180/+10).CAT construct did not respond to dexamethasone and showed a strongly reduced induction by dexamethasone plus IL-6, while it still responded to H2O2. Finally, the Ad.PAP(â118/+10).CAT and Ad.PAP(â61/+10).CAT constructs did not show significant response after induction by a combination of dexamethasone and IL-6. Taken together, these results show that the Ad.PAP(â1253/+10).CAT adenovirus contains the PAP I promoter elements that confer the highest induced activity and was therefore chosen to perform the in vivo studies.Fig. 3Determination of the functional regions in the PAP I promoter.

Values represent the means of five independent experiments (Â± standard error).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The Ad.PAP(â1253/+10).CAT adenovirus was used to determine feasibility of transferring the adenovirus to the mouse pancreas and to analyze the effect of acute pancreatitis on CAT expression. As a control, a recombinant adenovirus in which CAT was driven by the CMV promoter was also designed. Successful adenovirus-mediated gene transfer to normal tissues had been reported, but whether pancreatic inflammation could influence expression of the transferred genes was unknown. Ad.CMV.CAT recombinant adenovirus (2 Ã 109 pfu) was injected into the tail vein of mice, and CAT activity was measured 96 h later in several tissues. CAT activity in control animals and in mice with acute pancreatitis is shown in Fig. 4. Liver, pancreas, and lung showed the most important CAT activities, without significant differences in animals with pancreatitis. Similar results were obtained when the intraperitoneal route was used to inject the adenovirus (data not shown). To examine the activity of the Ad.PAP(â1253/+10).CAT in mouse tissues, particularly in the pancreas, 2 Ã 109 pfu of recombinant adenovirus were administered to mice by intravenous injection via the tail vein, and 4 days later, CAT activity and CAT pancreatic distribution were examined as described under âMaterials and Methods.â Healthy mice and mice in which acute pancreatitis had been induced were treated in parallel. A low but significant CAT activity was obtained in the pancreas of control animals. Activity was about ten times higher in animals with pancreatitis. Only pancreatic acinar cells expressed CAT as judged by immunocytochemical staining (Fig. 5). A low CAT activity was also observed in some of the other tissues that we examined in control animals (stomach, duodenum, jejunum, ileum, colon, liver, brain, heart, lung, muscle), but that activity was not modified by acute pancreatitis. These results suggest that upon induction of acute pancreatitis the PAP I promoter is able to drive a pancreas-specific enhanced expression of the reporter gene in vivo. Acute pancreatitis is a pancreatic disease of variable intensity ranging from tissue edema to complete necrosis of the gland. When the acute episode is not fatal, it is followed by a complete recovery of functional pancreatic capacities and morphology (16Gyr K.E. Singer M. Sarles H. Gyr K.E. Singer M. Sarles H. Pancreatitis: Concepts and Classification. pp. xxiii-xxv, Elsevier, Amsterdam1984Google Scholar). The lethality is directly related to the severity of pancreatitis. Patients with acute pancreatitis die from systemic complications such as respiratory distress, renal or cardiac insufficiency, multiorgan failure, or local or systemic infections that occur more frequently in necrohemorrhagic pancreatitis (17Banks P.A. Go V.L.W. Dimagno E.P. Gardner J.D. Lebenthal E. Reber H.A. Scheele G.A. The Pancreas: Biology, Pathobiology, and Disease. Raven Press, New York1993: 593-611Google Scholar). No therapeutic approach has shown efficacy, perhaps with the exception of profilactic antibiotherapy (18Sainio V. Kemppainen E. Poulakkainen M. Taavitsainen M. Kivisaari L. Valtonen V. Haapiainen R.

Although pathophysiology of acute pancreatitis is not understood to the point of developing rational therapeutic approaches, several molecules might be helpful if delivered locally (19Van Laethem J.L.

Saluja A.K. Sengupta A. Saluja M. Steer M. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 269: C1295-C1304Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Specific tools are therefore required to act locally in the diseased pancreas. Gene transfer strategies recently developed for the purpose of gene therapy are therefore good candidates. Adenovirus has been extensively used as a vector in gene transfer experiments in vitro (23Berkner K.L. BioTechniques. 1988; 6: 616-629Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and in vivo (24Morgan R.C. Anderson W.F. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1993; 62: 191-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). The major advantages of adenoviral vectors for in vivo gene transfer are the wide variety of tissues that will take up the virus particles, the efficient transduction rate resulting in significant expression of the transduced genes, and the ability of targeting non-proliferative cells. Unlike retroviral vectors, they generally remain episomal and may not persist in the transduced cells. However, an immune response to the injected vector may interfere with repeated administration. Hence, the adenoviruses that have been recently engineered for gene therapy are already suitable vectors for targeting transient expression of molecules. In this work, our primary objective was to determine if an adenoviral vector could mediate the expression of a reporter gene driven by the PAP I promoter into the inflamed pancreas. The promoter was chosen because PAP I gene expression in pancreas is restricted to the acute phase of pancreatitis (6Orelle B. Keim V. Masciotra L. Dagorn J.C. Iovanna J.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 90: 2284-2291Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 7Iovanna J.L. Keim V. Michel R. Dagorn J.C. Am. J. Physiol. 1991; 261: G485-G489PubMed Google Scholar, 8Iovanna J.L. Orelle B.

In the rat, PAP I mRNA attains maximal expression within 12 h after the induction of an experimental acute pancreatitis and decreases to undetectable levels during the recovery period. We reasoned that, since the PAP I promoter is activated by nuclear factors present only within the inflamed pancreas, its activity will be down-regulated during organ recovery. Genes with potential therapeutic interest should then be expressed during the acute phase only if driven by the PAP I promoter instead of genes constitutively expressed in the healthy pancreas such as amylase, trypsinogen, or chymotrypsinogen. The first step to evaluate the potential use of the PAP I promoter for gene targeting to the diseased pancreas was to look whether the promoter would keep its properties when inserted into an adenoviral vector. Experiments in vitro showed that the adenoviral context did not modify substantially the behavior of the PAP I promoter. Results of CAT expression in AR-42J cells after transduction with recombinant adenovirus containing different regions of the PAP I promoter (Fig. 2, Fig. 3) were very similar to those in which plasmid constructs were used (5Dusetti N.

These results were in agreement with previous studies on endogenous PAP I gene expression (5Dusetti N. Ortiz E. Mallo G. Dagorn J.C. Iovanna J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22417-22421Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar).2 Experiments in vivo performed with the Ad.CMV.CAT adenovirus confirmed that the pancreas could be efficiently transduced with an adenovirus. In addition, pancreas seemed to be a tissue with particularly high capacity of infection (Fig. 4). In the healthy animal, a small but significant CAT expression was observed in pancreas and in some of the other tissues that we investigated. CAT activity in pancreas is a probable consequence of a slight inflammation of the tissue induced by viral infection, supported by our observation of variable degrees of lymphocytic infiltration in the pancreas of those animals (not shown). A similar situation was reported after intranasal inoculation of mice with type 5 adenovirus, where a pathological pneumonia-like response developed, independent of viral replication (27Ginsberg H.S. Moldawer L.L. Sehgal P.B. Redington M. Kilian P.L. Chanock R.M. Prince G.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 1651-1655Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). It is interesting to note that besides pancreas, the lung was the site of highest CAT expression in our experiments (Fig. 4). We draw special attention to a possible CAT expression in intestinal cells because even though PAP I expression was originally reported in the inflamed pancreas (8Iovanna J.L. Orelle B. Keim V. Dagorn J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 24664-24669Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we (28Iovanna J.L. Keim V. Bosshard A. Orelle B. Frigerio J.M. Dusetti N. Dagorn J.C. Am. J.

Previous studies on the PAP I promoter allowed characterization of the cis-acting elements, within the proximal â1253 base pairs of the promoter, responsible for pancreas-specific expression (26Dusetti N. Ortiz E. Dagorn J.C. Iovanna J.L. Biochem. J. 1995; 311: 643-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar) and pancreatic induction (5Dusetti N. Ortiz E. Mallo G. Dagorn J.C. Iovanna J.L. J. Biol.

Commun. 1994; 204: 238-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), but we failed to determine the cis-elements responsible for intestinal expression. One possible explanation is that these cis-regulatory regions are localized elsewhere, which would explain the lack of intestinal expression observed here. The most interesting finding was that infection with the recombinant Ad.PAP(â1253/+10).CAT adenovirus resulted in strong CAT expression in the pancreas of mice with experimental edematous pancreatitis. Histological analysis demonstrated that expression was indeed restricted to pancreatic acinar cells. The expression was at least 20 times higher in the pancreas than in other tissues, in which no changes were observed compared with control animals. The specificity of influence of the induction of the PAP I promoter was further evidenced by the lack of influence of pancreatitis on CAT expression driven by the CMV promoter. It was concluded that, upon infection with the Ad.PAP(â1253/+10).CAT adenovirus, the reporter gene was slightly expressed in normal pancreas and strongly expressed in pancreas of diseased animals; in addition, expression was pancreas-specific, at least among tissues tested in this study. The â1253/+10 fragment of the PAP I promoter appears therefore as a promising tool for targeting beneficial molecules to the pancreas during acute pancreatitis. Further assessment will require additional efforts, including investigation on cytotoxic side effects and the possible testing of other vectors. This is to our knowledge the first report of tissue-specific gene transfer in which expression of the targeted gene is up-regulated during disease. These results should stimulate studies on other disease-induced genes, whose promoters might also be useful tools for specific targeting of appropriate therapeutic genes. We are grateful to Dr. F. L. Graham for generously providing the pÎE1sp1B and JM17 plasmids and 293 cells. We also thank Dr. J. J. Robert for assistance with adenovirus purification."

Many gene loci exhibit changes in DHS patterns according to the developmental stage, indicating that along with cellular differentiation, individual cis-regulatory elements of a given gene locus display different activity patterns. It has been argued that a reorganization of chromatin at early stages of cellular differentiation may represent a priming step required for the assembly of an active transcription machinery at later stages of development (1Forrester W.C.

A negative regulatory element is located at â2.4 kb (â2.4-kb silencer), which has been implicated in the repression of the lysozyme locus in lysozyme non-expressing tissues (11Baniahmad A.

In turn, reporter gene constructs carrying particular cis-regulatory elements are only active when transfected into cell types displaying a DHS at the position of the same element (13Theisen M.

The analysis of lysozyme chromatin structure in retrovirally transformed chicken cell lines resembling multipotent myeloid progenitor cells (21Graf T. McNagny K. Brady G. Frampton J. Cell. 1992; 70: 201-213Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) and various macrophage maturation stages revealed that different sets of cis-regulatory elements are structurally reorganized at different developmental stages and thus are differentially active (20Huber M.C. Graf T. Sippel A.E. Bonifer C. DNA Cell Biol. 1995; 14: 397-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 22Sippel A.E. Borgmeyer U. PÃ¼schel A.W. Rupp R.A.W. Stief A. Strech-Jurk U. Theisen M. Results Probl. Cell Differ. 1987; 14: 255-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Multipotent progenitor cells do not transcribe the lysozyme gene and display the chromatin structure of the inactive locus. At the myeloblast stage, DHSs are formed at the â6.1- and the â3.9-kb (early) enhancers as well as at the promoter form. The silencer element is still active, as indicated by the presence of a DHS, whereas the (late) enhancer at â2.7 kb displays no DHS and thus is inactive at this differentiation stage. A low level of lysozyme mRNA can be measured. At later stages of differentiation, a switch in chromatin structure in the region between â2.7 and â2.4 kb is observed. The DHS at the â2.4-kb element disappears, until it is lost upon terminal differentiation and a new DHS at the â2.7-kb enhancer element is formed. Along with chromatin reorganization, transcription of the gene is up-regulated from a very low level in myeloblast-like cells to an almost 100-fold higher level in activated macrophage-like cells. These experiments correlate a high transcriptional level of the lysozyme gene with conditions where all enhancers are active and where the silencer element has been inactivated. We showed that the chromatin structure displayed by the lysozyme locus in the various chicken cell types is faithfully reformed in lysozyme expressing and non-expressing cells of transgenic mice. This holds true for the DHSâ and the nucleosomal phasing pattern as well as for the reorganization of the â2.4/â2.7-kb region after terminal macrophage differentiation (23Huber M.C. KrÃ¼ger G. Bonifer C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 1443-1453Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 24Faust N. Huber M.C. Sippel A.E. Bonifer C. Exp. Hematol. 1997; PubMed Google Scholar), demonstrating that the same chromatin rearrangements take place in both species. Our experiments in transgenic mice also showed that for position-independent expression of the lysozyme locus in mature macrophages, the presence of all cis-regulatory elements is necessary (25Bonifer C. Vidal M. Grosveld F. Sippel A.E. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 2843-2848Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar, 26Bonifer C. Yannoutsos N. KrÃ¼ger G. Grosveld F. Sippel A.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4202-4210Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). However, experiments with deletion mutants of the lysozyme locus in transgenic mice demonstrated that each enhancer region, despite their unique temporal regulation, is capable of driving macrophage-specific expression in mature macrophages (26Bonifer C. Yannoutsos N. KrÃ¼ger G. Grosveld F. Sippel A.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4202-4210Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). The question now remained of how the different cis-regulatory elements cooperate during earlier stages of cell differentiation. To this end, we have analyzed the time course of transcriptional activation of wild type and mutant lysozyme locus constructs during in vitro differentiation of myeloid precursor cells isolated from the bone marrow of transgenic mice. We show that constructs carrying a deletion of the late enhancer region including the silencer element are transcriptionally activated at the same developmental stage as the wild type locus carrying all cis-regulatory elements. The time course of activation of both constructs is indistinguishable, indicating a coincidence of structural reorganization of the early enhancers and the onset of mRNA synthesis. A construct in which the early enhancer has been deleted shows a delay in transcriptional activation. Our results suggest that the presence of the â2.4-kb silencer element on the wild type locus has no influence of the developmental onset of lysozyme locus activation, which is solely determined by the activity of the early enhancers. For each experiment four mice were killed by cervical dislocation. Bone marrow cells were flushed from femurs and tibias with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Cells were collected, washed once in PBS, and maintained on ice throughout the staining procedure. The cell suspension was depleted of red blood cells by hypotonic lysis with an ammonium chloride potassium buffer (Red Cell Lysis Buffer, Sigma). To remove debris, the suspension was centrifuged through a cushion of fetal calf serum (FCS; Life Technologies, Inc.). The remaining cells were washed once and resuspended in PBS supplemented with 3% FCS. After the suspension was passed through a cell strainer (Falcon/Becton Dickinson), 3.5 Ã 107 cells in a volume of 200 Î¼l were used for staining. To suppress nonspecific binding, cells were first incubated for 5 min with 15 Î¼l of rat serum. Afterwards cells were incubated for 15 min with 16 Î¼l of ER-MP20-FITC (BMA), washed with PBS, 3% FCS and subsequently incubated (5 min) with 16 Î¼l of biotinylated ER-MP12 (BMA), followed by an addition of 16 Î¼l of streptavidin-Red670 and another incubation of 15 min. After two washes, the cells were resuspended in PBS, 3% FCS to a final concentration of 2 Ã 106 cells/ml. Stained cells were analyzed and sorted on a FACStarplus (Becton Dickinson). The fluorescence intensity of individual cells was measured as relative fluorescence units. The purity of the sorted cell populations was determined by flow cytometry and exceeded 95%. In order to characterize cells differentiated in vitro by antibody staining, cells were stained with ER-MP12 and ER-MP20 as described above. In addition, cells were stained with R-phycoerythrin-coupled mAbs (Pharmingen) against B220 (RA3-6B2), Mac-1 (M1/70), F4/80 and IgM (isotype control). Stained cells were analyzed by flow cytometry. The medium used for the culture of sorted cells was IMDM (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% FCS, 5% conditioned medium containing IL-3, 10% L-cell conditioned medium containing M-CSF, 2 mM glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 units/ml streptomycin (Life Technologies, Inc.), and 1.5 Ã 10â4M monothioglycerol. Conditioned media were prepared as described (27Faust N. Bonifer C. Wiles M.V. Sippel A.E. DNA Cell Biol. 1994; 13: 901-907Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). After sorting the cell populations ER-MP12hi/ER-MP20â and ER-MP12â/ER-MP20hi were distributed into 24-well plates (Greiner) depending on the number of kinetic time points and were cultured in a humidified environment with 5% CO2 in air at a temperature of 37Â°C. Depending on the sorting efficiency 1.5-3 Ã 104 ER-MP12hi/20â and 8-10 Ã 104 ER-MP12/20hi cells were plated per well. When harvesting the cells in intervals of either 12 or 24 h over a period of 6 days, the adherent cell fractions were separated from the non-adherent fractions. When indicated, cells were stimulated with 5 Î¼g/ml LPS for 12 h. In order to obtain cells for antibody staining, cells were plated onto hydrophobic Petriperm cell culture dishes (Heraeus). Test experiments indicated that no difference in gene expression was found as compared with normal tissue culture dishes (data not shown). Total RNA was isolated from the adherent and non-adherent cells using 0.5 ml of RNAzolâ¢ B (Biotecx Laboratories, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. cDNA of isolated total RNAs from the different samples was prepared using random hexamers as primers and Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies, Inc.) in a reaction volume of 20 Î¼l under conditions recommended by the manufacturer. Per reaction 2 units of ribonuclease inhibitor (Life Technologies, Inc.) was added. cDNA was subsequently heated to 70Â°C for 5 min to inactivate reverse transcriptase. To ensure the use of comparable amounts of RNA and cDNA for the analysis of the different samples, the relative expression level of the housekeeping gene HPRT was used as a standard for calibration. Only in the linear range of PCR reactions is it possible to quantitate the intensity of PCR signals. The linear range of PCR reactions is defined as the range in which the use of double cDNA amounts correlates with a duplication of the signal intensity. To define the linear range, serial 1:2 dilutions of the different cDNA samples were used to perform a PCR with primers specific for HPRT. For further analysis of the expression level of the endogenous mouse lysozyme and the different constructs of the transgenic chicken lysozyme, only those cDNA concentrations were used which gave rise both to signal intensities for HPRT within the linear range as well as comparable intensities among the different samples. The corresponding sample used for HPRT calibration was further diluted 1:2, 1:10, and 1:50 and used to perform a PCR with primers specific for mouse lysozyme. Due to the different expression levels of chicken lysozyme transgenes in the different mouse lines and in the various differentiation stages, it was necessary to carry out PCR reactions with a different range of dilutions for each mouse line. Except for mouse line dXK.2, 1 Î¼l of the following serial dilutions from the determined dilution of every sample which gave rise to a linear HPRT-PCR signal were used to analyze the different mouse lines: mouse line XS.0b: 1:2, 1:10, 1:50; mouse line XSdSS.28: 1:2, 1:4, 1:8. For mouse line dXK.2, 4, 2, and 1 Î¼l were used. Primers used were as follows: HPRT, 5â²-CACAGGACTAGAACACCTGC-3â²; 5â²- GCTGGTGAAAAGGACCTCT-3â²; mouse lysozyme (m-lys), 5â²-ACCCAGCCTCCAGTCACCAT-3â², 5â²-CAGTGCTTTGGTCTCCACGG-3â²; chicken lysozyme (c-lys), 5â²-GATCGTCAGCGATGGAAACGGC-3â², 5â²-CTCACAGCCGGCAGCCTCTGAT-3â². HPRT-PCRs were performed with 1.25 mM MgCl2 and 18 pmol of each HPRT primer. PCRs for mouse lysozyme used 1.25 mM MgCl2 and 15 pmol of each m-lys primer, whereas chicken lysozyme PCRs were performed with 1.0 mM MgCl2 and 15 pmol of each c-lys primer. To every PCR reaction 1 Î¼l of the corresponding cDNA dilution was added. PCR reactions were done in a total volume of 30 Î¼l and with the use of 1.5 units of Taq polymerase (Life Technologies, Inc.). PCRs were carried out in a Trio-Thermoblock (Biometra) using a regimen of 94Â°C for 40 s, 55Â°C (HPRT) or 62Â°C (m-lys and c-lys) for 40 s, and 72Â°C for 1 min. After 35 cycles, the PCR was finished with a terminal elongation step of 72Â°C for 10 min. 15 Î¼l of each sample was loaded on a 6% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Gels were stained with ethidium bromide and photographed with a Cybertech-Videoprinter (Mitsubishi) under 245 nm of UV light. Bands on digitized videoprints were quantified with the Image 1.35 program on a Macintosh computer. Signal intensities for mouse and chicken lysozyme were normalized to the HPRT signal, and the absolute normalized expression level was calculated from these values by multiplication with the dilution factors. The different cis-regulatory elements of the lysozyme gene are structurally activated at different macrophage differentiation stages as indicated by a changing pattern of DHS in the 5â²-regulatory region of the lysozyme locus in various myeloid chicken cell lines (20Huber M.C. Graf T. Sippel A.E. Bonifer C. DNA Cell Biol. 1995; 14: 397-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1A). The highest transcriptional level is observed in cell lines representing activated macrophages that display DNase I hypersensitivity at the position of all enhancer elements and where the DHS at the silencer element at â2.4 kb has completely disappeared. In order to evaluate the contribution of different cis-regulatory region to the developmental control of lysozyme expression, we analyzed the time course of transcriptional activation in the three different mouse lines indicated in Fig. 1, B and C (26Bonifer C. Yannoutsos N. KrÃ¼ger G. Grosveld F. Sippel A.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4202-4210Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Mouse line XS.0b carries a construct with the full set of cis-regulatory elements, whereas the transgenes in mouse lines dXK.2 and XSdSS.28 carry either a deletion of the early enhancer region around â6.1 kb or a deletion of the late â2.7/â2.4-kb enhancer region, respectively. The presence or absence of domain bordering sequences has no influence on the expression of the different constructs in macrophages, as shown earlier (26Bonifer C. Yannoutsos N. KrÃ¼ger G. Grosveld F. Sippel A.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4202-4210Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). In order to follow transcriptional activation of wild type and mutant lysozyme loci, we set up an in vitro differentiation system based on enriched myeloid precursor cells as outlined in Fig. 2. It has been shown that developing macrophage precursors can be characterized by a differential expression of the ER-MP12 and the ER-MP20 surface antigens (28Leenen P.J.M. Slieker W.A.T. Melis M. van Ewijk W. Eur. J. Immunol. 1990; 20: 15-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 29Leenen P.J.M. Melis M. Slieker W.A.T. van Ewijk W. Eur. J. Immunol. 1990; 20: 27-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). The most immature macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF) responsive precursors express a high level of the ER-MP12 and no ER-MP20 antigen (Fig. 2). During macrophage maturation, ER-MP12 expression is gradually switched off, whereas expression of ER-MP20 is switched on. Bone marrow monocytes express a high level of the ER-MP20 antigen and have lost the ER-MP12 antigen (30de Bruijn M.F.T.R. Slieker W.A.T. van der Loo J.C.M. Voerman J.S.A. van Ewijk W. Leenen P.J.M. Eur. J. Immunol. 1994; 24: 2279-2284Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). We isolated ER-MP12hi/20â cells (ER-MP12hi population) by fluorescence activated cell sorting in order to follow gene expression during early macrophage differentiation. To compare the mRNA levels in monocytes differentiated in vitro with the level found in bone marrow monocytes, we also analyzed ER-MP12â/20hi cells (ER-MP20hi population). The isolated cell populations were cultivated under macrophage growth promoting conditions in the presence of M-CSF and interleukin-3 (IL-3) for a period of 6 days. Bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) is known to promote macrophage activation and has been shown to stimulate expression of the chicken lysozyme gene in chicken and mouse macrophages (10Altschmied J. MÃ¼ller M. Baniahmad S. Steiner S. Renkawitz R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 4975-4991Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 20Huber M.C. Graf T. Sippel A.E. Bonifer C.

Biochem. 1994; 226: 227-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). To examine at which stage of differentiation the cells acquire LPS responsiveness, cultures were treated with LPS for 12 h, either immediately after isolation or after 5 days of culture. Along with progressive macrophage maturation the cells acquire an adherent phenotype. Since we were interested in studying gene activation starting with a precursor population as immature as possible, we separated the cells into more mature adherent and immature non-adherent fractions. Cells were harvested at 12- or 24-h intervals as indicated in Fig. 2, and total RNA was prepared which was subjected to RT-PCR analysis for the expression of the following genes: HPRT as an internal calibration standard, the endogenous macrophage-specific mouse lysozyme M gene as a control marker for a successful and reproducible in vitro differentiation, and the chicken lysozyme transgene. In order to define the developmental stage at which transgene activation takes place, we immunostained cells at various time points of differentiation with labeled antibodies directed against markers indicative of different macrophage maturation stages (32Leenen P.J. de Bruijn M.F. Voerman J.S. Campbell P.A. van Ewijk W. J. Immunol. Methods. 1994; 174: 5-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). Macrophages developing from ER-MP12hi populations in vitro have up to now not been characterized in detail. The ER-MP12hi population consists mainly of small blast-like cells as described previously (30, data not shown). From day 3 of culture onwards, cells progressively acquire an adherent phenotype (see also Fig. 3). By day 6 most cells are adherent and from morphology and surface marker expression (Fig. 5) resemble monocytes. The ER-MP20hi population resembles monocytic cells, which adhere quickly within 12 h of culture (see Fig. 3). During progressive differentiation cells of both populations acquire the characteristic features of macrophages, like irregular shapes and granules.Fig. 5Immunophenotypic characterization of differentiating cells. Cell surface marker characterization of ER-MP12hi/20â (A) and ER-MP20hi/12â cells (B) during their in vitro differentiation in the presence of IL-3 and M-CSF and unseparated bone marrow (BM, upper panel, A). All samples were stained with biotinylated (+RED 670) ER-MP12, ER-MP20-FITC and the corresponding R-phycoerythrin-labeled third mAb specific for either of the indicated surface markers. A mAb against mouse IgM was used as an isotype-matched control (IgG 2b) for the macrophage-specific mAbs Mac-1 and F4/80. For analysis of the third mAb at day 0 live gates were set on either ER-MP12hi/20â (A) or ER-MP20hi/12â (B). Histograms in A were generated from 100,000 (bone marrow), about 1000 (day 0), 500 (day 1), 1000 (day 3), and 2000 (day 6) events; histograms in B were generated from about 5000 (day 0) and 500 (day 6) events.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) In order to further characterize cells developing in our culture system, we analyzed their proliferative capacity. In each respective differentiation culture we started with the same number of cells; hence, the comparison of the total amount of HPRT mRNA present in our RNA preparations from the different time points allowed an accurate description of relative cell numbers. In the same way, we could measure the proportion of adherent versus non-adherent cells. The result of this experiment is depicted in Fig. 3, which shows the relative increase in cell numbers and the changing proportion of adherent versus non-adherent cells in the different cell populations. An initial lag phase is observed for the ER-MP12hi culture which is due to the presence of contaminating non-myeloid cells dying in the first 2 days of in vitro differentiation (30de Bruijn M.F.T.R. Slieker W.A.T. van der Loo J.C.M. Voerman J.S.A. van Ewijk W. Leenen P.J.M. Eur. J. Immunol. 1994; 24: 2279-2284Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Thereafter, both cell populations show the same proliferative capacity. The proportion of adherent cells in the ER-MP20hi population is an order of magnitude higher compared with the ER-MP12hi population. Mature ER-MP20hi cells cease to proliferate toward the end of the culturing period. In contrast, the ER-MP12hi population contains a significant number of proliferating non-adherent precursor cells which successively mature and adhere. This indicates that the non-adherent fraction of the ER-MP12hi cell population contains the desired precursor cell types to use as a starting population for the analysis of the time course of transcriptional activation of different transgene constructs. Construct XS carries the full set of cis-regulatory elements of the lysozyme locus and is expressed at a high level in macrophages of transgenic mice and independent of the chromosomal position of the transgene (26Bonifer C. Yannoutsos N. KrÃ¼ger G. Grosveld F. Sippel A.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4202-4210Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar).

At the sequence, 5â²-GTC-3â², the primase synthesizes the dinucleotide pppAC; the cytidine residue of the recognition sequence is cryptic. Only tetraribonucleotides function as primers, but the specificity for the third and fourth position is not as stringent with a preference of CMP > AMP > UMP > GMP. The predominant recognition sites on M13 DNA are 5â²-(G/T)GGTC-3â² and 5â²-GTGTC-3â². Synthesis is usually limited to tetranucleotides, but T7 primase can synthesize longer oligoribonucleotides on templates containing long stretches of guanosine residues 5â² to the recognition sequence. The specificity beyond the first two positions of the primer increases as the length of the template on the 3â²-side of 5â²-GTC-3â² increases. On an oligonucleotide having 20 3â²-flanking cytidine residues GMP is incorporated at the third position; incorporation is reduced 4-fold when the flanking sequence reaches 65 residues, and little is incorporated on M13 templates. The presence of the 56-kDa gene 4 helicase decreases the incorporation of GMP on long templates. We propose that pausing is required for the incorporation of less preferred nucleotides and that pausing is decreased by the ability of the primase to translocate 5â² to 3â² on templates having long 3â²-flanking sequences.

Gene 4 of bacteriophage T7 encodes two co-linear proteins, a 56- and a 63-kDa protein (1Dunn J.J. Studier F.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1983; 166: 477-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (971) Google Scholar). In phage-infected cells, the two proteins are expressed in approximately equal amounts from two in-frame translation initiation sites 189 bases apart on the gene 4 transcript. Thus, the 56-kDa gene 4 protein lacks the 63 N-terminal amino acid residues of the 63-kDa gene 4 protein. The 56-kDa protein (helicase) binds to single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) 1The abbreviations used are: sssingle-stranded; nt, nucleotide(s). in the presence of a nucleoside triphosphate (dNTP) and then, in a reaction coupled to the hydrolysis of the dNTP, translocates 5â² to 3â² along the ssDNA (2Matson S.W.

The 63-amino acid N-terminal domain of the 63-kDa gene 4 protein (primase) contains a Cys4 zinc-binding motif (4Bernstein J.A. Richardson C.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3909-3916Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), a domain that enables the primase to synthesize oligoribonucleotides in a template mediated reaction. Although the zinc-binding motif is essential for primer synthesis (5Mendelman L.V. Beauchamp B.B. Richardson C.C. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3909-3916Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), it alone cannot account for the ability of the protein to recognize specific sequences on ssDNA (6Kusakabe T. Richardson C.C.

The 63-kDa gene 4 protein has helicase activity as well as primase activity, and it alone can support the growth of T7 bacteriophage in vivo (13Mendelman L.V. Notarnicola S.M. Richardson C.C. Proc.

DNA Replication. W. H. Freeman, New York1992: 275-306Google Scholar). The gene 4 primase of phage T7 catalyzes the template- directed synthesis of di-, tri-, tetra-, and pentaribonucleotides on ssDNA (16Scherzinger S. Lanka E. Hillenbrand G.

However, both in vivo and in vitro only tetra- and pentaribonucleotides can serve as functional primers for T7 DNA polymerase (17Romano L.J. Richardson C.C. J. Biol.

Studies employing synthetic oligonucleotide templates have demonstrated that the trinucleotide sequence 5â²-GTC-3â² is both necessary and sufficient for the protein-DNA interaction required to initiate oligoribonucleotide synthesis (19Mendelman L.V. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 23240-23250Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The 3â²-cytidine is required for recognition but is not copied into the primer. Although limited synthesis of pppAA dinucleotide has been observed to occur at the trinucleotide sequence 5â²-TTC-3â² under certain conditions, the pppAA dinucleotide is not extended further (6Kusakabe T.

Analysis of the oligoribonucleotide primers attached to the 5â²-end of Okazaki fragments both in vivo and in vitro has shown that the T7 primase synthesizes predominantly pppAC(C/A)(C/A) tetraribonucleotides; UMP and GMP are not found in the primers (17Romano L.J.

Gene 61 primase of bacteriophage T4 and DnaG primase of Escherichia coli also contain a single Cys4 type zinc motif at their N termini (5Mendelman L.V. Beauchamp B.B. Richardson C.C.

In contrast to these similarities among the three primases, the T4 and E. coli primases differ from the T7 primase in that the template sequence 5â² to the trinucleotide recognition sequence is less stringent both in regard to sequence and to the length that is copied (23Cha T.-A.

As a result the oligoribonucleotides found at the 5â²-termini of Okazaki fragments synthesized by the T4 and E. coli primases are ppp(A/G)C(N)3 or pppAG(N)9-11, respectively (28Nossal N.G. J. Biol.

The T4 and E. coli primase systems also differ from that of T7 in one other striking manner. Whereas the T7 63-kDa gene 4 protein catalyzes both helicase and primase activities, the T4 and E. coli helicase and primase activities reside within separate polypeptides (28Nossal N.G. J. Biol.

As a result the T7 primase is faced with the dilemma that upon reaching a primase recognition site it must either pause in its 5â² to 3â² translocation and synthesize a primer in the opposite direction or continue its role as a helicase. In this report we present evidence that the inherent translocation activity of the T7 primase plays a role in determining which potential sites in the template are used for oligoribonucleotide synthesis. The T7 63-kDa gene 4 protein used in these studies has Met at position 64 replaced by Gly but this protein has all of the catalytic properties of the wild-type protein (35Mendelman L.V.

Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 23240-23250Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The standard reaction (10 Î¼l) contained 40 mM Tris-Cl (pH 7.5), 10 mM MgCl2, 10 mM dithiothreitol, 50 Î¼g/ml bovine serum albumin, 50 mM potassium glutamate, 0.5 mM dTTP, 0.1 mM rNTPs, 10 nM M13 ssDNA or 100 nM oligonucleotides, and 60 nM (monomer) primase unless otherwise indicated. After incubation at 37Â°C for 60 min, the reaction was stopped by the addition of 20 Î¼l of sequencing dye (98% formamide, 10 mM EDTA (pH 8.0), 0.1% xylene cyanol FF, 0.1% bromphenol blue). The reaction mixtures were then heated at 95Â°C for 5 min. The products were separated by electrophoresis through 15 or 25% gels containing 50% urea. Formation of a minimal replication fork was carried out as follows. One nanomole of RF-1 oligonucleotide (71 nt) was phosphorylated using T4 polynucleotide kinase and mixed with 1 nmol of RF-3 (40 nt) in 100 mM Tris-Cl (pH 7.5). The mixture was heated at 95Â°C for 5 min and then slowly cooled to anneal, followed by ligation of the oligonucleotides by incubation overnight at 16Â°C using T4 ligase. The 71-nt closed circular DNA was isolated on a 10% urea-gel and then annealed with RF-2 oligonucleotide (75 nt) at a molar ratio of 1:3 at 65Â°C followed by cooling overnight. Reactions using the minimal replication fork (20 Î¼l) contained 40 mM Tris-Cl (pH 7.5), 10 mM MgCl2, 10 mM dithiothreitol, 50 Î¼g/ml bovine serum albumin, 50 mM potassium glutamate, 0.7 mM dTTP, 0.2 mM d(A,G,C)TPs, 0.1 mM [Î±-32P]CTP, 0.1 mM ATP or (A,G,U)TPs, 50 nM gene 5 DNA polymerase, 500 nM gene 2.5 protein, and 5 nM (hexamer) primase. The reactions were started by adding the replication fork to 25 nM. After incubation at 37Â°C for 5 min, the reactions were stopped by the addition of 5 Î¼l of 0.2 M EDTA. A portion of the reaction mixture (5 Î¼l) was mixed with 15 Î¼l of sequencing dye and applied directly to a 25% urea-gel for measurement of oligoribonucleotide synthesis. The remainder of the reaction (20 Î¼l) was deproteinized, and the DNA was precipitated with ethanol, digested with BamHI, and loaded onto a 6% urea-gel. After electrophoresis the DNA fragments containing ribonucleotide primer were visualized by autoradiography. The primers used by T7 DNA polymerase both in vivo and in vitro are exclusively tetra- or pentaribonucleotides (18Tabor S. Richardson C.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 205-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 20Fujiyama A. Kohara Y. Okazaki T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 903-907Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). However, in vitro both di- and triribonucleotides are synthesized by the 63-kDa gene 4 primase (16Scherzinger S. Lanka E. Hillenbrand G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1977; 4: 4151-4163Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 19Mendelman L.V. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 23240-23250Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We have previously shown that the minimal recognition sequence for the T7 primase is 5â²-GTC-3â² and at this site the gene 4 protein catalyzes the synthesis of the dinucleotide pppAC unless the proper nucleotides are present in the template for extension to tri- and tetranucleotides (19Mendelman L.V.

A. 1994; 91: 1233-12327Crossref Scopus (16) Google Scholar) revealed that pppAC is the only dinucleotide that can be extended to tetra- or pentanucleotide primers. The dinucleotides pppAA and very few pppGN are synthesized on M13 ssDNA but the pppAA is not extended to the trinucleotide (21Hine A.V. Richardson C.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1233-12327Crossref Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Although the nucleotides found at the first and second position of the functional primer are invariant, the specificity of subsequent nucleotides in the primer as well as the factors controlling the length of the primers have not been examined rigorously. Previous studies have demonstrated that although there is a strong preference for CMP and AMP to be incorporated after the first two nucleotides, the stringency for nucleotide incorporation is less at these positions (6Kusakabe T. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19563-19570Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 21Hine A.V. Richardson C.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1233-12327Crossref Scopus (16) Google Scholar). In order to determine the frequency with which each nucleotide is incorporated into primer, we have carried out oligonucleotide synthesis in reactions containing either M13 ssDNA or synthetic oligonucleotide templates and one of each of the four [Î±-32P]NTPs in the presence of the other three unlabeled rNTPs. Using the 7249-nt M13mp18 ssDNA and much shorter synthetic oligonucleotides, we demonstrated that nucleotide specificity is influenced by the length of the template. In addition, short oligonucleotide template enabled the examination of nucleotide incorporation at specific sequences. As shown in Fig. 1, A and B, when M13 ssDNA was used as a template, incorporation of GMP and UMP by gene 4 primase after the second position in the oligoribonucleotide was only 6.7 and 13.8%, respectively, compared with that of CMP. AMP was incorporated as well as CMP. In agreement with earlier studies pppAC and pppAA dinucleotides were synthesized, but only pppAC was extended (Fig. 1A). No significant amount of dinucleotide containing GMP or UMP was observed. As described above GTP can be used as the first nucleotide of the primer, albeit at very low frequency. Consequently, a portion of radioactivity observed with [Î±-32P]GTP is most likely due to incorporation of GTP as the first nucleotide. In addition to pppACC and pppACA trinucleotides in the middle two lanes, pppACU trinucleotide was also observed in the last three lanes. However, the pppACU trinucleotides were less efficiently extended to tetranucleotide primers. These results demonstrate that the gene 4 primase prefers CMP and AMP for incorporation after the second position of the primer. Although UMP can be incorporated, the resulting trinucleotides are less likely to be further extended. Although the length of the majority of primer synthesized by the gene 4 protein are limited to five nucleotides, further extension can occur as evidenced by the presence of a small amount of hexamer and heptamer seen in Fig. 1A. Since the gene 4 primase incorporates GMP and UMP poorly, this property may play a role in limiting the length of the oligoribonucleotide synthesized by the primase starting from a basic recognition site. In fact, inspection of the M13 ssDNA sequences reveals that the longest stretch of guanosine or thymidine residues following the recognition sequence 5â²-GTC-3â² is 5â²-TGGGGGTC-3â², a site that yields the heptanucleotide pppACCCCCCA observed in Fig. 1A. In order to determine whether the T7 primase has an inherent property limiting the length of primers synthesized to four or five nucleotides or if the length of the primer is, at least in part, determined by the DNA sequence, we constructed a template containing a repeat of 19 guanosine residues on the 5â²-side of the primase recognition site. On this template, T7 primase synthesizes long primers, up to 22 nt in length (Fig. 2). The presence of an additional nucleotide suggests that the primase adds a one nucleotide overhang upon reaching the 5â²-end of the template strand. The amount of oligoribonucleotide synthesized increased linearly, up to 60 min, and the proportional amount of short and long primers was roughly constant over this period. As shown in the previous section, gene 4 primase incorporates predominantly CMP and AMP after the second position in primers synthesized on M13 ssDNA. In order to compare more precisely the ability of the T7 primase to incorporate each of the four nucleotides at positions beyond the initial dinucleotides we have examined primer synthesis on synthetic oligonucleotides of known sequence. The templates shown in Fig. 3 varies in length from 25 to 80 nt, and they all contain the basic primase recognition site 5â²-GTC-3â² with variation in the sequence occurring on the 3â²-side of the recognition sequence (see Table I for complete sequences). Oligoribonucleotide synthesis reactions were carried out on the various templates shown in Fig. 3 in the presence of ATP, GTP, UTP, and [Î±-32P]CTP. To our surprise when these oligonucleotides were used as templates, GMP and UMP could be readily incorporated at the third and subsequent positions (Fig. 3A). The total amount of oligoribonucleotides having lengths greater than two residues is presented in Fig. 3B for each template. GMP (template 8) and UMP (template 9) can be incorporated into the third position of the primer when a cytidine or thymidine residue follow the basic recognition site in the template. Furthermore, these nucleotides can also be incorporated into the fourth position (templates 5 and 7, respectively). Incorporation of UMP is relatively low, but the amount incorporated is still comparable to that of CMP incorporated (compare template 1 and 9, Fig. 3, A and B). The relatively low synthesis of oligonucleotides on templates 1 and 2 is most likely due to length of the sequence 3â² to the recognition sequence 5â²-GTC-3â² on these templates (see below). Interestingly, in the case of template 8, once two GMP residues have been incorporated into the third and fourth positions, the oligoribonucleotide is efficiently extended as evidenced by the accumulation of primers greater than four in length. Thus the presence of guanosine on the 3â²-terminus of the primer does not inhibit its further extension by the primase. Two different primase recognition sites 5â²-AGGTC-3â² and 5â²-ATGTC-3â² are present in template 7, necessitating the incorporation of a uridine residue at the fourth position of the primer. Tetranucleotides are synthesized with equal efficiency on both. We have examined the ability of the T7 primase to use templates containing adenosine or cytidine in the fourth position of the template sequence, 5â²-G(A/C)GTC-3â², in the presence of a template containing the sequence, 5â²-GGGTC-3â² as a competitor. As shown in Fig. 4, all three templates alone were approximately equal in their ability to incorporate CMP, GMP, or UMP at the third position of the oligoribonucleotides. Interestingly, the oligoribonucleotides containing either GMP or UMP at the third position were far more efficiently extended to the 5â²-end of the polyguanosine-containing template than those incorporating CMP at this position (see âDiscussionâ). When each of the templates containing adenosine or cytidine at the fourth position of the recognition sequence were mixed with an equal amount of template containing guanosine at this position, the amount of primer synthesis was reduced by half. Since the reactions were performed under conditions of template excess, a reduction in the incorporation of GMP and UMP by 2-fold indicates that the adenosine or cytidine containing templates are used as well as the guanosine containing template. The three extensively studied prokaryotic DNA primases, E. coli DnaG protein, T4 gene 61 protein, and T7 gene 4 protein, all recognize a basic trinucleotide sequence in the template (23Cha T.-A.

For cell assays, 1 Ã 105 cells/ml were cultured for 7 days in the absence or presence of increased concentrations of vitamin C (0, 0.1, 0.3, 1, and 3 mM) prepared and added daily in fresh medium. On days 1, 3, 5, and 7, the cells were harvested, and cell number was determined by counting the cells in a Neubauer chamber. Cell viability was assayed by trypan blue exclusion and was always found to be >95%. Culture supernatants were assayed for virus production by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay of the p24 antigen (Coulter HIV-1 p24 antigen; Coulter Corp., Hialeah, FL). Uptake studies were performed as described (24Vera J.C. Rivas C.I. VelÃ¡squez F.V. Zhang R.H. Concha I.I. Golde D.W. J. Biol.

Briefly, 1 Ã 106 cells were incubated with 50 Î¼M dehydroascorbic acid (DHA) in the presence of 2 units of ascorbate oxidase (Sigma) and 0.5 Î¼Ci of L-[14C]ascorbic acid (specific activity, 8.2 mCi/mmol; DuPont NEN) at room temperature for 0, 5, 10, 20, 30, 45, and 60 min. For accumulation studies, cells were incubated for 60 min in the presence of 0.01, 0.03, 0.1, 0.3, 1, 3, and 10 mM dehydroascorbic acid. Cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline without Ca2+ and Mg2+ at 4Â°C before lysis with 60% methanol containing 1 mM EDTA. The cell-associated radioactivity was determined by scintillation spectrometry. For uptake of 2-deoxy-D-glucose (deoxyglucose), 1 Ã 106 cells were incubated with 0.2 mM deoxyglucose and 1.5 Î¼Ci of 2-[1,2-3H]deoxy-D-glucose (26.2 Ci/mmol, DuPont NEN) for 0, 5, 10, 30, 45, and 60 min. For uptake of 3-O-methyl-D-glucose (methylglucose, OMG), 1 Ã 106 cells were incubated with 1 mM methylglucose and 5 Î¼Ci of 3-O-D-[methyl-3H]glucose for 0, 5, 10, 20, 30, 45, and 60 s. For inhibition studies of deoxyglucose on the uptake of dehydroascorbic acid, 1 Ã 106 cells were incubated with 50 Î¼M dehydroascorbic acid, 2 units of ascorbate oxidase, and 0.5 Î¼Ci of L-[14C]ascorbic acid in the presence of increasing concentrations of deoxyglucose (0, 0.1, 1, 3, 10, 30, and 100 mM) and incubated for 30 s. The cell-associated radioactivity was determined by scintillation spectrometry. For Western blot analysis, 5 Ã 106 HIV-1-infected cells or their control uninfected cell lines were resuspended in cold 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, containing 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM EGTA, and protease inhibitors (50 Î¼g/ml aprotinin, 50 Î¼g/ml leupeptin, 50 Î¼g/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor, and 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). After sonication, cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 10,000 Ã g for 10 min at 4Â°C, and the supernatant was then centrifuged at 100,000 Ã g for 1 h at 4Â°C. The pellet was resuspended in cold 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, containing 150 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, 100 mM dithiothreitol, 0.2% SDS, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, and protease inhibitors (50 Î¼g/ml aprotinin, 50 Î¼g/ml leupeptin, 50 Î¼g/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor, and 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Samples were sonicated and resuspended with continuous shaking for 1 h at 4Â°C. After the supernatant was cleared at 100,000 Ã g for 60 min at 4Â°C, protein concentration was determined using a turbidimetric procedure (33Vera J.C. Anal. Biochem. 1988; 174: 187-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), and 50 Î¼g of protein from each cell line were separated by electrophoresis on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and transferred to Immobilon (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA). The glucose transporters were identified using anti-GLUT1, -GLUT2, -GLUT3, -GLUT4, and -GLUT5 antibodies (East Acres Biologicals, Southbridge, MA). The membranes were developed according to the ECL Western blotting analysis system (Amersham Corp.). For immunocytochemistry, cells were collected by centrifugation (Cytospin; Shandon Inc., Pittsburgh, PA) onto microscope slides, fixed in buffered formaldehyde-acetone for 30 s, and washed with phosphate-buffered saline. The fixed cells were incubated in a humid chamber for 60 min in phosphate-buffered saline containing 5% bovine serum albumin followed by incubation for 2 h at room temperature in the same buffer containing 1% bovine serum albumin, 0.3% Triton X-100, and anti-GLUT1, -GLUT2, -GLUT3, -GLUT4, and -GLUT5 antibodies (1:100). The cells were then washed and incubated with anti-rabbit IgG:fluorescein (1:50, Life Technologies, Inc.) for 1 h, washed, mounted, and observed by fluorescence microscopy. Preparation of infectious HIV-1 stock and infection of the cells was done as described (34Gartner S. Popovic M. Aldovini A. Walker B.D. Techniques in HIV Research. Stockton Press, New York1990: 53-70Crossref Google Scholar). Briefly, CEM cells were cultivated for 2 h with infectious HIV-1 stock obtained from the supernatant of the 3BH9 cells in the presence of 10 Î¼g/ml Polybrene (Sigma), washed, and cultured for several days (CEM-HIV cells). Initial studies indicated that four cell lines chronically infected with HIV-1 (J22, U1, ACH2, and 3BH9) (27Popovic M. Sarngadharan M.G. Read E. Gallo R.C.

In all of these cells, uptake of dehydroascorbic acid was linear for at least 10 min and approached a plateau at 60 min. On the other hand, uptake of reduced ascorbic acid proceeded in a linear fashion for the length of the 60-min incubation period but accounted for <5% of the uptake of dehydroascorbic acid under similar conditions (data not shown). In short period transport experiments, we observed that the cells failed to take up reduced ascorbic acid during the first 30 s of incubation, while the uptake of dehydroascorbic acid was very efficient and proceeded linearly for the duration of the incubation (data not shown). The uptake data are compatible with the oxidation of the ascorbic acid present in solution and the time-dependent generation of the transported substrate dehydroascorbic acid and are consistent with our previous findings that human host defense cells transport dehydroascorbic acid and do not transport ascorbic acid directly (22Vera J.C.

Four cell lines chronically infected with HIV-1 (J22, U1, ACH2, and 3BH9) showed an increased capacity to take up dehydroascorbic acid as compared with the uninfected parental cells HL-60, U937, CEM, and H9 (Fig. 1, A-D). As estimated from the slopes of the initial linear phase of uptake, infected cell lines (except U1) showed a â¼3-5-fold increase in their rate of uptake of dehydroascorbic acid. U1 cells showed a <2-fold increase in their uptake of dehydroascorbic acid. Furthermore, the infected cells showed an increased capacity to accumulate radioactive vitamin C at 60 min compared with the uninfected cells. The amount of radioactive material associated with the cells at the end of the 60-min incubation period greatly exceeded the amount expected for a transport mechanism of the facilitated type in which net uptake approaches zero when the intracellular concentration of the transported substrate equals its extracellular concentration. The data are consistent with the intracellular accumulation of the recently transported dehydroascorbic acid as ascorbic acid (data not shown; see also Refs. 22Vera J.C. Rivas C.I. Fischbarg J. Golde D.W. Nature. 1993; 364: 79-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar, 23Vera J.C. Rivas C.I. Zhang R.H. Farber C.M. Golde D.W.

The interpretation of uptake data in terms of the capacity of the cells to transport dehydroascorbic acid is confounded by the fact that long-term uptake experiments reflect both the transport of dehydroascorbic acid and its intracellular trapping as reduced ascorbic acid (22Vera J.C. Rivas C.I. Fischbarg J. Golde D.W. Nature. 1993; 364: 79-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar, 23Vera J.C. Rivas C.I. Zhang R.H. Farber C.M. Golde D.W.

We have shown with HL-60 cells that transport data can be obtained only from very short uptake experiments lasting 30 s or less (24Vera J.C. Rivas C.I. VelÃ¡squez F.V. Zhang R.H. Concha I.I. Golde D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23706-23712Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). We further explored the issue of vitamin C transport as distinct from accumulation. Short uptake experiments revealed that the initial rate of transport of dehydroascorbic acid was increased from â¼2-4-fold in the infected cell lines as compared to the respective uninfected controls, results that are consistent with the concept that the infected cells have a greater capacity than the uninfected controls to transport dehydroascorbic acid (Fig. 1, E-H). In addition, when the cells were incubated for 60 min in the presence of increasing concentrations of dehydroascorbic acid, the infected cells consistently accumulated 2-3 times more ascorbic acid than the respective uninfected controls (Fig. 1, I-L). These data also indicated that in cells incubated with concentrations of dehydroascorbic acid as high as 10 mM, >90% of the intracellularly accumulated radioactivity corresponded to ascorbic acid (data not shown), an observation consistent with the presence of mainly ascorbic acid in mammalian cells. Considering an intracellular exchange volume of â¼0.3-0.6 Î¼l/106 cells (data not shown; see also Refs. 22Vera J.C. Rivas C.I. Fischbarg J. Golde D.W. Nature. 1993; 364: 79-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar, 23Vera J.C. Rivas C.I. Zhang R.H. Farber C.M. Golde D.W. Blood. 1994; 84: 1628-1634Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 24Vera J.C.

Chem. 1995; 270: 23706-23712Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar), the infected cells accumulated from 30 to 130 mM ascorbic acid intracellularly when incubated in the presence of 10 mM dehydroascorbic acid (Fig. 1, I-L). Under similar conditions, the uninfected cells accumulated 15 to 60 mM ascorbic acid. These data support the notion that the infected cells possess an extraordinary capacity to reduce the increased amount of dehydroascorbic acid transported to ascorbic acid. The above results indicate that the HIV-1-infected cells accumulated more ascorbic acid intracellularly than the control cells through a mechanism involving increased transport of dehydroascorbic acid coupled to its intracellular reduction to ascorbic acid. The identity of the intracellular mechanisms involved in the reduction of dehydroascorbic acid to ascorbic acid remains controversial and appears considerably more complex than a simple chemical reaction involving the direct participation of reduced glutathione (11Meister A.

Given our previous information regarding the transport of dehydroascorbic acid in leukocytes, we hypothesized that increased expression of the glucose transporters in the HIV-1-infected cells could explain their increased transport of vitamin C. Transport and accumulation studies using deoxyglucose indicated that the HIV-1-infected cells had a markedly increased capacity to take up this substrate which is specific for the glucose transporters (42Simpson I.A. Cushman S.W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1986; 55: 1059-1089Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar, 43Carruthers A. Physiol. Rev. 1990; 70: 1135-1176Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar) as compared with uninfected cells (Fig. 2, A-D). The relative increase in deoxyglucose uptake paralleled that observed for the uptake of dehydroascorbic acid, an observation consistent with the concept that the increased transport of dehydroascorbic acid was related to the increased expression of glucose transporters in the infected cells. We analyzed the expression of glucose transporters in the infected cells by measuring the transport of methylglucose, an analog of glucose that is not metabolized and that enters the cells through the glucose transporters (42Simpson I.A. Cushman S.W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1986; 55: 1059-1089Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar, 43Carruthers A. Physiol. Rev. 1990; 70: 1135-1176Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). Methylglucose can be used as a reagent to isolate transport from accumulation and to relate variations in the rate of transport to changes in the number of glucose transporters. These studies showed increased transport of methylglucose in the HIV-infected cells compared with the uninfected controls (Fig. 2, E-H), confirming an increase in the number of functional glucose transporters in the HIV-1-infected cells. There was a close correlation between the increased expression of glucose transporters and increased ability of the HIV-1-infected cells to take up dehydroascorbic acid. We directly tested the participation of glucose transporters in the transport of dehydroascorbic acid in the different cells by determining the effect of increasing concentrations of deoxyglucose on transport. Deoxyglucose inhibited the uptake of dehydroascorbic acid in both the HIV-infected and uninfected cell lines in a dose-dependent manner and with a similar concentration dependence (Fig. 2, I-L). Fifty percent inhibition of uptake (ID50) was observed at â¼4 mM deoxyglucose, a value consistent with the affinity of GLUT1 for deoxyglucose (22Vera J.C. Rivas C.I. Fischbarg J. Golde D.W. Nature. 1993; 364: 79-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar, 23Vera J.C. Rivas C.I. Zhang R.H. Farber C.M. Golde D.W. Blood. 1994; 84: 1628-1634Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 24Vera J.C.

Complete inhibition of transport was observed at 50 mM deoxyglucose. These data confirm the transport of dehydroascorbic acid by facilitative glucose transporters in both the control and the infected cells. Six facilitative transporter isoforms have been described in mammalian cells (44Mueckler M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 219: 713-725Crossref PubMed Scopus (958) Google Scholar) of which five, GLUT1-GLUT5, are expressed on the plasma membrane and participate in the cellular uptake of hexoses. Immunoblotting experiments allowed us to identify GLUT1 as the major glucose transporter present in both the infected and the uninfected cell lines (Fig. 3B). No bands immunoreactive with anti-GLUT2, -GLUT3, -GLUT4, or -GLUT5 antibodies were observed in these experiments under conditions that showed strong reactivity with anti-GLUT1 (data not shown). When blots were overexposed, immunoreactive bands were observed in samples obtained from the U937, U1, HL-60, and J22 cells probed with the anti-GLUT5 antibody. The anti-GLUT1 antibody recognized a broad immunoreactive band apparently composed of several overlapping bands ranging from â¼40 to 80 Kd (Fig. 3B) in six of the eight cell lines studied. The T-lymphocytic cell lines ACH2 and H9 showed the presence of a broad GLUT1 immunoreactive band ranging from â¼55 to 120 Kd. Control experiments revealed that the anti-GLUT1 antibody identified a broad but much less heterogeneous immunoreactive band of 45-50 Kd in membranes prepared from human erythrocytes (data not shown). The broad immunoreactive bands were absent in membranes incubated with anti-GLUT1 preabsorbed with the peptide used to generate the antibody, indicating the specificity of the reaction (Fig. 3C). The immunoblotting experiments also revealed that there was an increased amount of GLUT1-immunoreactive material in the HIV-infected cells compared with the uninfected controls. These results are consistent with the transport experiments and indicate increased expression of GLUT1 in the HIV-infected cells. Immunolocalization studies using fluorescein-tagged antibodies also led to the identification of GLUT1 in the cell lines, with increased intensity of staining observed in the HIV-infected cells compared with the uninfected controls (Fig. 3A). As controls, cells were immunostained with anti-GLUT1 antibody previously preincubated with the peptide used to generate the antibody. No staining in either uninfected or infected cell lines was observed, confirming the specificity of the anti-GLUT1 immunoreactivity (data not shown). The previous data were obtained using cells chronically infected with HIV that were maintained in culture for a long time. To directly relate changes in vitamin C transport and accumulation to HIV infection, we studied vitamin C and hexose uptake in a freshly infected cell line. CEM cells were infected with HTLV-IIIB and production of p24 was monitored for 6 days after infection (Fig. 4A). The infected cells showed an increased ability to transport dehydroascorbic acid and accumulate ascorbic acid as compared with the mock-infected cells (Fig. 4, B-D). They also showed an increased capacity to take up deoxyglucose (Fig. 4E) and to transport methylglucose (Fig. 4F). Deoxyglucose at 50 mM completely inhibited the uptake of dehydroascorbic acid in both cell types, with an ID50 of â¼5 mM (Fig. 4G). These data indicate that the increased transport and accumulation of vitamin C observed in the HIV-infected cells are an early effect of the infection process that is maintained as a stable cell phenotype under conditions of chronic infection and long-term culture. To study the effect of vitamin C on cell survival and viral production, HIV-1-infected and uninfected control cells were incubated with various concentrations of ascorbic acid. At tested concentrations of 0.1-3 mM, vitamin C decreased the proliferation and survival of the uninfected cells (Fig. 5A, E, I, and M). Only a minor effect on cell proliferation was observed at 0.1 and 0.3 mM vitamin C, with the greatest effect seen in HL-60 (Fig. 5I) and H9 cells (Fig. 5E). A clear cytotoxic effect was observed when the cells were incubated with 1 mM vitamin C, with only the H9 cells showing some degree of proliferation under those conditions (Fig. 5E). No living cells were recovered from samples treated for 24 h with 3 mM vitamin C. Vitamin C had a complex effect on the proliferation and survival of the HIV-1-infected cells. The infected cell line 3BH9 showed a small (â¼50%) but consistent increase in proliferation when incubated in the presence of 0.1 and 0.3 mM vitamin C (Fig. 5F). On the other hand, 0.3 mM vitamin C preferentially decreased the proliferation of the HIV-1-infected lymphocytic cell line ACH2 (Fig. 5B) compared to the control cell line CEM (Fig. 5A). A similar effect was observed at 1 mM vitamin C for the lymphocytic cell line 3BH9 (Fig. 5F) and the monocytic cell line U1 (Fig. 5N). No cells other than the 3BH9 survived in the presence of 1 mM vitamin C for 7 days (Fig. 5F), and only dead cells were recovered from samples treated for 24 h or longer with 3 mM vitamin C (Fig. 5). With the exception of the cell line HL-60, which was similarly sensitive to high concentrations of vitamin C as the HIV-infected cell line J22, treating the cells for 1 week with pharmacological concentrations of vitamin C preferentially decreased the proliferation and survival of the HIV-infected cells compared with the uninfected control cells (Fig. 5, D, H, L, and P). The effect of vitamin C on viral production was cell line dependent, with decreased viral production observed in all cells at high vitamin C concentrations. At 3 mM, vitamin C caused a major decrease in p24 production by all the cell lines (Fig. 5, C, G, K, and O). In infected monocytic U1 cells, vitamin C caused decreased p24 production at all concentrations tested (Fig. 5, O and P). This effect was most marked at concentrations of vitamin C â¥0.3 mM. Vitamin C at 3 mM caused a 2-fold decrease in p24, a result that is consistent with the cytotoxic effect of this high concentration of vitamin C on the cells. On the other hand, 0.1 and 0.3 mM vitamin C induced an increase in the production of p24 by the T-lymphocytic cell line 3BH9 (Fig. 5, G and H). Similarly, 0.1 mM vitamin C also induced increased p24 production by the T-lymphocytic cell line ACH2 (Fig. 5, C and D). The ACH2 cells, however, were very sensitive to higher concentrations of vitamin C (Fig. 5B), and 0.3 mM vitamin C caused a decrease of 2 orders of magnitude in p24 in the culture supernatant (Fig. 5, C and D), although at that concentration vitamin C was not cytotoxic to the ACH2 cells. Vitamin C, at concentrations of 0.3 and 1 mM, caused a transient increase in p24 production by J22 cells that lasted for â¼4 days (Fig. 5K). After 7 days of exposure, however, vitamin C at 0.3 mM and higher caused decreased p24 production. Thus, only pharmacological concentrations of vitamin C consistently decreased p24 production in HIV-infected cells, whereas low vitamin C concentrations produced variable effects including increased p24 production. HIV infection leads ultimately to the development of AIDS and severe immunodeficiency. The mechanisms involved in this process are poorly understood, but it has been suggested that changes in redox metabolism in cells infected with HIV-1 are closely linked to the decrease in their functional capacity. Changes in intracellular concentrations of glutathione have been reported to occur after HIV infection with a decrease in the fraction of cells with high content of glutathione (8Roederer M. Staal F.J.T. Osada H. Herzenberg L.A. Herzenberg L.A. Int. Immunol. 1991; 3: 933-937Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). These findings led to the observation that high concentrations of N-acetylcysteine, a precursor of cellular glutathione, appeared to impair viral replication in some in vitro models, suggesting that manipulation of cellular redox metabolism could have potential clinical applications (10Staal F.J.T.

Our findings indicate that HIV infection of lymphoid, mononuclear phagocyte, and myeloid human hematopoietic cell lines leads to increased capacity of these cells to transport and accumulate vitamin C and glucose analogs. Our data point to the participation of facilitative glucose transporters in the transport of vitamin C in the HIV-infected as well as the control uninfected cells. Six different facilitative glucose transporters have been identified in mammalian cells of which five (GLUT1-GLUT5) are expressed on the cell surface and participate in the cellular uptake of hexoses (44Mueckler M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 219: 713-725Crossref PubMed Scopus (958) Google Scholar). We have shown that vitamin C is taken up by Xenopus laevis oocytes expressing the mammalian glucose transporters GLUT1, GLUT2, and GLUT4 and normal human neutrophils and HL-60 cells in the form of dehydroascorbic acid and trapped intracellularly by reduction to ascorbic acid (22Vera J.C.

The evidence is consistent with the concept that HIV-infected and uninfected white blood cells do not transport reduced ascorbic acid and that the basal uptake observed in long uptake assays is due to the oxidation of ascorbic acid in solution with the concomitant generation of the transported species dehydroascorbic acid (22Vera J.C.

Our data point to increased expression and function of the glucose transporter GLUT1 as the mechanism leading to the increased transport of vitamin C by HIV-infected cells. The cells were able to transport deoxyglucose, a substrate that is specific for the facilitative glucose transporters, and cells chronically and acutely infected with HIV showed an increased capacity to take up this substrate compared with the uninfected cells. In addition, infected cells also showed an increased capacity to transport methylglucose, an analog of glucose that is useful in assessing transport as distinct from accumulation. Competition studies showed that the transport of dehydroascorbic acid was inhibited by deoxyglucose. Moreover, the expression of GLUT1 is augmented in HIV-1-infected cells as indicated by the immunodetection studies. Thus, our results strongly support the concept that GLUT1 mediates the transport of dehydroascorbic acid in these cells and that the changes in the capacity of the HIV-infected cells to transport dehydroascorbic acid and hexoses reflect increased expression of GLUT1 in the cells. The increase in GLUT1 expression observed after infection with HIV, a nontransforming virus, is unprecedented. Although cell transformation after infection with oncogenic retroviruses leads to increased expression of GLUT1 (25Flier J.S. Mueckler M.M. Usher P. Lodish H.F. Science. 1987; 235: 1492-1495Crossref PubMed Scopus (692) Google Scholar, 26Birnbaum M.J. Haspel H.C. Rosen O.M. Science. 1987; 235: 1495-1498Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar), no effect on glucose transporter expression or function has been reported in cells infected with nontransforming retroviruses. The increased expression of GLUT1 in HIV-infected cells may have important implications for the physiology of the infected cells. One of the primary characteristics of cancer cells is an increased uptake and anaerobic metabolism of glucose. The increased glucose uptake may give the malignant cells an advantage in terms of growth and survival because glucose provides most of the fuel necessary for cell function. Because glucose must be taken up from the surrounding media and not from intracellular stores, cancer cells require an increased ability to transport glucose, a process mediated by overexpression of the glucose transporter GLUT1. Thus, our data suggest that HIV infection of host defense cells is associated with changes in the metabolic state of the cells as reflected by the increased expression of GLUT1 and the concomitant increased transport and metabolism of glucose. The observation that the HIV-infected cells possess an increased capacity to accumulate reduced ascorbic acid when incubated in the presence of dehydroascorbic acid may also have important physiological consequences for the infected cells. Vitamin C is fundamental to human physiology. Because humans cannot synthesize vitamin C, it must be provided exogenously in the diet and transported intracellularly. Prolonged absence of vitamin C in the diet leads to the development of scurvy with associated cellular dysfunction. Vitamin C is present in human cells at millimolar concentrations and has important roles in vascular and connective tissue integrity, normal hematopoiesis, leukocyte function, and defense against microorganisms. Our data are consistent with the concept that HIV-infected and uninfected white blood cells transport dehydroascorbic acid through the glucose transporter GLUT1. No definitive information is available regarding the mechanisms involved in the intracellular reduction of dehydroascorbic acid and trapping of ascorbic acid, or on the effect of increased intracellular concentrations of ascorbic acid on cellular physiology. In vivo animal studies have provided evidence for a coupling between the cellular levels of glutathione and vitamin C. In animals depleted of glutathione by treatment with buthionine sulfoximine, supplementation with vitamin C protected cells from oxidative damage (11Meister A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9397-9400Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, in scorbutic animals, supplementation with precursors of glutathione such as glutathione methyl ester protected the animals from early death (46Martensson J. Han J. Griffith O.W. Meister A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 317-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). There is, however, no direct evidence indicating a relationship between the differential capacity of cells to accumulate ascorbic acid and their respective intracellular concentrations of glutathione. Evidence is also lacking regarding the relationship of intracellular concentrations of ascorbic acid to the enzymes glutaredoxin and protein disulfide isomerase, both of which appear to possess glutathione-dependent dehydroascorbate reductase activity. Evidence is available suggesting that physiological concentrations of vitamin C may decrease HIV replication in in vitro models (12Harakeh S. Jariwalla R.J. Pauling L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 7245-7249Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Our data indicate, however, a complex effect of different concentrations of vitamin C on cell proliferation on HIV-infected and uninfected cells and on viral production by HIV-infected cells. The effect of vitamin C was clearly dose dependent and strongly affected by the cellular model studied. At vitamin C concentrations of 100 Î¼M, well within the physiological range, there was no correlation between the effects of the vitamin on cell proliferation (no effect or a small decrease or increase in both infected and uninfected cell lines) and on viral production (cell specific). We observed increased viral production by ACH2 cells in the presence of 100 Î¼M vitamin C and by 3BH9 cells in the presence of 0.1 and 0.3 mM vitamin C. On the other hand, a 1-week exposure to pharmacological concentrations of vitamin C generally decreased cell proliferation and survival of HIV-infected cells compared with the uninfected controls. Thus, the prominent decrease of viral production in cells exposed to millimolar concentrations of vitamin C was clearly related to the cytotoxic effect of vitamin C. Although the data provide a basis for understanding the interrelationship of vitamin C and HIV infection, the complexity of our observations and the lack of information of the molecular components that are part of the cellular mechanisms linking cellular vitamin C and viral production leave interpretation of the data incomplete in mechanistic terms. Overall, our results are compatible with evidence indicating that vitamin C and compounds that increase the cellular content of glutathione or affect the cellular redox potential are able to modulate viral production in short-term experiments in vitro, although their mechanisms of action remain a matter of controversy (6Nottet H.S. van Asbeck B.S. de Graaf L. de Vos N.M.

Our findings indicate that HIV infection increases vitamin C uptake in human lymphocytic, myeloid, and monocytic cell lines because of increased expression of glucose transporters and show that pharmacological concentrations of vitamin C are preferentially toxic to host defense cell lines infected with HIV. The data provide a foundation on which to begin to understand the interrelationship among vitamin C, HIV infection, and cell metabolism but do not address the therapeutic implications of vitamin C in AIDS."

One possible explanation for this effect is that the Ca2+ affinity of the regulatory protein troponin C decreases when sarcomere length is reduced.

In this protocol, [Ca2+] was rapidly increased by flash photolysis of caged Ca2+, and changes in [Ca2+] due to photolysis and the subsequent binding to troponin C were assessed using a Ca2+ fluorophore. Small bundles of fibers from rabbit skinned psoas muscles were loaded with Ca2+ fluorophore (Fluo-3) and caged Ca2+ (dimethoxynitrophenamine or o-nitrophenyl-EGTA). The bundles were then transferred to silicone oil, where [Ca2+]free, tension, and sarcomere length were monitored before and after photolysis of caged Ca2+. Upon photolysis of caged Ca2+, fluorescence increased and then decayed to a new steady-state level within â¼1 s, while tension increased to a new steady-state level within â¼1.5 s. After extracting troponin C, fibers did not generate tension following the flash, but steady-state post-flash fluorescence was significantly greater than when troponin C was present.

https://openalex.org/W2018721932,"Intracisternal A-particle (IAP) sequences are endogenous retrovirus-like elements present at 1,000 copies in the mouse genome. We had previously identified IAP-related transcripts of unusual size (6 and 10 kilobases (kb)), which are observed exclusively in the liver of the aging mouse. In this report, using cDNA libraries that we have constructed from the liver mRNAs of an aged DBA/2 mouse, we have cloned and entirely sequenced the corresponding cDNAs. Both are initiated within the 5â² long terminal repeat of a type IÎ1 IAP sequence, and correspond to a read-through into a unique flanking cellular sequence containing a 966-nucleotide open reading frame, located 3â² to the IAP sequence. The 6-kb IAP-related transcript corresponds to a post-transcriptional modification of the 10-kb mRNA, and is generated by a splicing event with the donor site in the IAP sequence, and the acceptor site 5â² to the open reading frame. This open reading frame is located on chromosome 3, is evolutionarily conserved, and discloses significant similarity to the yeast CCR4 transcription factor at the amino acid level. The specific expression of these age-induced transcripts, which account for more than 50% of the IAP-related transcripts in the liver of old mice, is therefore entirely consistent with the induction of a single genomic locus, thus strengthening the importance of position effects for the expression of transposable elements.

Lueders K.K. Adv. Cancer Res. 1988; 51: 183-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar, 2Heidmann O. Heidmann T. Cell. 1991; 64: 159-170Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). These sequences, 3.5-7.2 kb long, have been classified into different subgroups, each represented by a few hundred copies (3Shen-Ong G.L.C. Cole M.D. J. Virol. 1982; 42: 411-421Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 4Lueders K.K. Mietz J.A.

Like retroviruses, they contain two long terminal repeats (LTRs) with a U3-R-U5 organization, bordering gag-pol-like open reading frames. They are not infectious, and as expected disclose a severely truncated envelope gene. The LTRs contain the signals for the initiation and regulation of transcription (5â²-LTR) and for the polyadenylation of the transcripts (3â²-LTR). At least some of the IAP elements should still be functional as transposition events can be detected, either directly (2Heidmann O. Heidmann T. Cell. 1991; 64: 159-170Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar) or indirectly via the mutations that their transposition provoke, especially in tumor cells in culture where these elements are heavily transcribed and act as mutagenic agents (reviewed in Refs. 1Kuff E.L. Lueders K.K. Adv. Cancer Res. 1988; 51: 183-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar and 5Kuff E.L.

The in vivo pattern of expression of IAPs is complex, owing to the large number of these elements in the genome and to possible position effects. In an extensive in vivo analysis of IAP expression in transgenic mice, using LTR-driven reporter genes, we have previously identified a specific ânicheâ for expression of these elements in the stem cells of the germline (6Dupressoir A. Heidmann T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4495-4503Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Expression of the IAP transgenes in these cells was found to be position-independent, and should therefore reflect an intrinsic property of these elements. It is consistent with a possible role in adaptive processes, since transposition specifically in the germline should result in inherited mutations. However, global Northern blot analysis of endogenous IAP expression using appropriate probes have also revealed IAP transcripts in several mouse somatic tissues with, for instance, maximum expression in the thymus (reviewed in Refs. 1Kuff E.L. Lueders K.K. Adv. Cancer Res. 1988; 51: 183-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar and 7Dupressoir A. Puech A. Heidmann T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1264: 397-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The occurrence of such transcripts is intriguing, as expression of the IAP transgenes was not detected in these tissues, and a plausible interpretation could be that they simply originate from a limited number of IAP elements, which would be embedded, for instance, within genomic domains specifically activated in the corresponding tissues. An interesting situation was previously unraveled in an extensive analysis of IAP transcripts in the organs of aging mice (7Dupressoir A. Puech A. Heidmann T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1264: 397-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The rationale of this study was that aging is a process associated with cellular dysfunctions, for which it can be hypothesized (among other theories) that they result from an accumulation of somatic mutations (reviewed in Refs. 8Vojta P.J. Barrett J.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1242: 29-41PubMed Google Scholar, 9Jazwinski S.M. Science. 1996; 273: 54-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar, 10Smith J.R. Pereira-Smith O. Science. 1996; 273: 63-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar). These could be triggered by transposable elements, acting as insertion mutagens. In this respect, we had actually revealed IAP transcripts of abnormal size (6 and 10 kb) which are induced at least 30-fold in the liver of aged mice, whatever the mouse strain tested. A similar induction of gene transcription has only been rarely described in relation with aging, especially for potentially mutagenic transposable elements, and it was therefore of interest to characterize the IAP elements associated with these transcripts (i) to determine whether they correspond to âfunctionalâ IAP sequences, and (ii) to characterize the mechanisms of their induction upon aging. We have therefore constructed cDNA libraries with the RNAs from the liver of aged mice, and in this report we demonstrate that the IAP transcripts induced with age in fact originate from a single locus that we have cloned, and correspond to a read-through from a non-coding IAP element into the adjacent cellular DNA, which further contains an open reading frame with homology to a yeast transcription factor. These results demonstrate the importance of position effects on the expression of highly reiterated elements, and identify a locus that should now allow the characterization of domains or genes possibly directly associated with the aging process. Mice from four different inbred strains (C57BL/6, C57BL/10, BALB/c, and DBA/2) were obtained from Iffa-Credo Laboratories; they were housed individually in our animal facilities, where they were fed ad libitum. All mice were killed by cervical dislocation and had no evident pathology at the time of death. PCRs were performed with a Hybaid thermal cycler. 1 ng of plasmid DNA, 100 ng of genomic DNA, or 5 Î¼l of phage stock (previously submitted to three cycles of liquid nitrogen freezing and thawing) were amplified with 1 unit of Taq DNA polymerase in the buffer supplied by the manufacturer (Amersham). Initial denaturation was for 5 min at 95Â°C, followed by 30 cycles at 94Â°C for 1 min, 55Â°C for 1 min, and 72Â°C for 1 min. Final extension was at 72Â°C for 10 min.

Lueders K.K. Adv. Cancer Res. 1988; 51: 183-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). The IAP-env probe (nt 1782-2803, referring to the sequence in Ref. 13Reuss F.U. Schaller H.C. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 5702-5709Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was obtained by PCR amplification using primers IAPE1 and IAPE3 and mouse genomic DNA. The resulting PCR fragment (assayed by nucleotide sequencing) was inserted at the EcoRV site of pBluescript (Stratagene), from which it was then excised as a XbaI-SpeI fragment. Probe XH is a 300-bp XhoI-HindIII fragment from plasmid pA3-13 (see âResultsâ).

Poly(A)+ RNA was isolated from total RNA using a pre-packed spun column containing oligo(dT)-cellulose (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). For Northern blot analysis, 10 Î¼g of total RNA/lane were fractionated on agarose/formaldehyde gels. RNAs were transferred to a nylon membrane (Hybond N, Amersham) in 0.15 M NH4Ac buffer and hybridized with riboprobes or DNA probes. Loading of equal amounts of RNA in each lane was assessed with the BET-stained ribosomal RNAs upon UV illumination of the membrane. Prehybridization and hybridization were performed in 50% formamide with 0.75 M NaCl, 1% SDS, 50 Î¼g/ml salmon sperm DNA, and 5% dextran sulfate when using riboprobes, or with 7% SDS, 1 mM EDTA, 0.5 M NaHPO4, pH 7 (16Church G.M.

Hybridized blots were first rinsed in 2 Ã SSC at room temperature and then washed at 65Â°C (time length and SSC concentration varied depending on the probe; see figures).

High molecular weight DNAs were extracted from different tissues, which were first crushed on dry ice and then incubated overnight at 55Â°C in a solution containing 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.1 M NaCl, 25 mM EDTA, 1% SDS, and 150 Î¼g of proteinase K. DNA was phenol-chloroform-extracted, ethanol-precipitated, washed twice in 70% ethanol, dried under vacuum, and resuspended in TE buffer. DNA digestion was carried out with a 4-6-fold enzyme excess. Digested DNA was electrophoresed on 0.8% agarose gels, transferred to nylon membrane (Hybond N, Amersham), and cross-linked to the membrane using a Stratalinker apparatus (Stratagene). Hybridization and washing were carried out as described for Northern blot analysis. Two cDNA libraries (one oligo(dT)-primed and one random-primed) were constructed using the Î»Zap Express cDNA synthesis kit (Stratagene), following the manufacturer's instructions. Poly(A)+ RNA from an 18-month-old DBA/2 mouse liver was used for first-strand cDNA synthesis, using either poly(dT)-unidirectional primers or random-unidirectional linker primers, which both contain a XhoI site (Stratagene). Second-strand cDNA synthesis was followed by directional cloning into the EcoRI/XhoI sites of the Î»Zap Express arms. Ligated phage DNA was packaged in vitro using Gigapack II Gold packaging extracts (Stratagene). The libraries were subsequently amplified using XL1Blue MRFâ² as an host strain. 3.5 Ã 105 and 9 Ã 105 bacteriophage particles for the oligo(dT)-primed and the random-primed cDNA libraries, respectively, were plated at near confluence and duplicate filters were prepared. Differential screening with 32P-labeled probes was performed as described for Northern blot analysis. Positive Î»Zap clones were grown with helper phages, and plasmids containing cDNA inserts were rescued as pBK-CMV plasmids following the manufacturer's instructions. Sequencing was performed with overlapping subclones generated by either unidirectional deletions using internal restriction sites or an ExoIII nested deletion kit (Pharmacia), or by direct cloning of isolated fragments. Plasmid DNAs were affinity purified on Nucleobond AX Cartridges (Macherey-Nagel). Automated DNA sequencing were performed using the Taq dye primer cycle sequencing procedure with an Applied Biosystems Inc. model 373 apparatus. Homology searches were performed using the entire GenBankâ¢ and the NBRF/PIR data bases with the help of the French Bisance service (17Dessen P. Fondrat C. Valencien C. Mugnier C. Comput. Appl. Biosci. 1990; 6: 355-356PubMed Google Scholar). In situ hybridization experiments were carried out using metaphase spreads from a WMP male mouse, in which all the autosomes except 19 were in the form of metacentric robertsonian translocations. Concavalin A-stimulated lymphocytes were cultured at 37Â°C for 72 h with 5-bromodeoxyuridine added for the final 6 h of culture (60 Î¼g/ml of medium), to ensure a chromosomal R-banding of good quality. The pB2-16 clone containing a 2-kb insert in pBluescript was tritium-labeled by nick-translation to a specific activity of 2 Ã 108 dpm/Î¼g. The radiolabeled probe was hybridized to metaphase spreads at final concentration of 25 ng/ml hybridization solution as described previously (18Mattei M.-G. Philip N. Passage E. Moisan J.-P. Mandel J.-L. Mattei J.-F. Human Genet. 1985; 69: 268-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). After coating with nuclear track emulsion (Kodak NTB2), the slides were exposed for 20 days at 4Â°C, then developed. To avoid any slipping of silver grains during the banding procedure, chromosome spreads were first stained with buffered Giemsa solution and metaphases photographed. R-banding was then performed by the fluorochrome-photolysis-Giemsa method and metaphases rephotographed before analysis. As previously demonstrated and illustrated in Fig. 1A, Northern blot analysis, using an almost full-length IAP probe, of RNAs from the liver of aged mice reveals 10- and 6-kb transcripts not observed in the young mouse. These IAP ge-elated transcripts (IAP-AR1 and -AR2) are of abnormal size as compared to the canonical 7.2- and 5.4-kb transcripts classically observed in the mouse tissues, and they were first characterized by an extensive analysis using various IAP probes (see scheme in Fig. 1E). Probing Northern blots of liver mRNA from old mice with single-stranded IAP riboprobes (data not shown) first demonstrated that both IAP-AR transcripts are transcribed from the sense strand, as expected for normal IAP transcripts. Taking into account the abnormal length of the IAP-AR1 transcript, we then questioned whether it could correspond to an env-containing sequence; actually, full-length IAP transcripts characterized to date (i.e. 7.2 kb) all contain a truncated env gene, but Reuss and Schaller (13Reuss F.U. Schaller H.C. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 5702-5709Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) recently cloned a 4-kb cDNA coding for a related full-length envelope. As shown in Fig. 1B, hybridization with an env probe failed to detect any of the two IAP-AR transcripts even under prolonged exposure (only a minor transcript of 1.45 kb could be detected, possibly corresponding to an alternative splice of the previously characterized env transcript in Ref. 13Reuss F.U. Schaller H.C. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 5702-5709Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Finally, Northern blots were hybridized with a series of probes encompassing different IAP sub-domains (Fig. 1, B and E). Hybridization with an internal probe immediately adjacent to the 5â²-LTR (IAP-5â²), with the two probes in the pol region (IAP-pol1 and IAP-pol2), as well as with an LTR probe (not shown), in all cases detected the two IAP-AR transcripts (Fig. 1E). Only the IAP-3â² probe, located just 5â² to the 3â²-LTR, failed to detect IAP-AR2, but still detected IAP-AR1. Altogether, these results indicates that the 10- and 6-kb transcripts contain closely related IAP domains, characteristic of type I, type IÎ1, or type IIA elements. The features of the IAP-AR2 transcript do not correspond to those of any IAP transcripts characterized to date, and could result from a 3â² deletion within the progenitor IAP, or from a post-transcriptional modification; the IAP-AR1 transcript is not associated with a still hypothetical full-length gag-pol-env IAP, and most probably corresponds to an extended 5â² or 3â² read-through. To characterize further the IAP-AR transcripts, we constructed two cDNA libraries: a randomly primed cDNA library and an oligo(dT)-primed one. In both cases cDNAs were synthesized with poly(A)+ mRNAs from the liver of an 18-month-old DBA/2 mouse, as highest expression of both transcripts was observed in this strain (7Dupressoir A. Puech A. Heidmann T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1264: 397-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). According to the analysis above, no IAP probe could be used for a direct selective screening of the IAP-AR versus normal IAP transcripts. We therefore decided to clone the IAP-AR1 first, assuming that it corresponds to an IAP read-through transcript (see above), and even more precisely to a 3â² read-through (its level of transcription, in the sense orientation, was shown to vary among mouse strains as the canonical IAP transcripts (7Dupressoir A. Puech A. Heidmann T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1264: 397-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), strongly suggesting that it is initiated within an IAP LTR). Accordingly, the strategy for cloning was to screen the randomly primed cDNA library with a âborderâ IAP probe (IAP-3â²) and to select positive clones also containing non-IAP sequences. Twenty positive clones were therefore isolated and purified, and inserts subsequently excised as pBK plasmids (see âExperimental Proceduresâ). The fraction of IAP sequence contained in the cDNA inserts was determined after restriction of the plasmid DNAs, and hybridization of the blots on which they had been transferred with an IAP probe. Out of the 20 positive bacteriophage clones, 8 had non-IAP fragments larger than 500 bp and were sequenced. Hybridization of a XhoI-HindIII fragment (probe XH, see Fig. 1, C and E) originating from the 3â² region of one of the candidate clones (pA3-13; cDNAs were cloned in an oriented way), finally allowed us to detect the 10-kb IAP-AR1 transcript. Surprisingly, this fragment also detected the 6-kb IAP-AR2, as well as a 3-kb transcript, thus suggesting that these are alternatively spliced forms of the IAP-AR1 transcript. As illustrated in Fig. 1D using the same probe, these three transcripts could be detected in the liver mRNA originating from old mice of four different mouse strains (with varying intensity depending on the strain, as previously observed (7Dupressoir A. Puech A. Heidmann T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1264: 397-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) for an IAP probe), and they were all induced upon aging. These results suggest that the IAP-AR transcripts are originating from the same locus and confirm that their induction is a general feature related to aging in the liver. The complete characterization of the IAP-AR1 transcript was then achieved using probe XH, which was used to screen the 18-month-old liver oligo(dT)-primed cDNA library to clone the 3â² end of the 10-kb IAP-AR1 transcript (clones pB2-16 and pB4-28, Fig. 2). Screening of the randomly primed cDNA library finally allowed us to identify a clone containing the 5â² end of the transcript (clone pIII-3, Fig. 2; see below). Sequencing of the subclones provided the composite cDNA sequence of the 10-kb IAP-AR1 transcript (Fig. 3).Fig. 3Nucleotide sequence of the IAP-AR1 transcript. The sequence of the IAP-AR1 transcript is derived from the complete sequencing of the pIII-3 and pA3-13 cDNAs, and partial sequencing of the pB4-28 and pB2-16 clones (see Fig. 2); part of the internal IAP sequence is not represented (but complete sequence is available from GenBank, accession number U70139). The IAP LTRs (with U3, R, and U5) are boxed, as well as the B1 and B2 repeats and the 3â² end ORF; the splice donors (SD) and acceptors (SA) are indicated and underlined.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The strategy for cloning the 6-kb IAP-AR2 and the 3-kb transcripts was then rather straightforward, taking into account that both are positive for the XH probe. According to the data in Fig. 1, IAP-AR2 should be positive for the IAP-pol probes but, unlike IAP-AR1, should be negative for probe IAP-3â²: out of 10 clones positive for probe XH that we isolated from the oligo(dT)-primed cDNA library, one met these combined criteria (pB2-12, Fig. 2) and was entirely sequenced. Similarly, a cDNA for the 3-kb transcript should be positive for the XH probe, negative for both the IAP-3â² and the IAP-pol probes, and about 3 kb long: combination of these four criteria allowed us to identify a corresponding 3-kb cDNA (clone pB1-19, Fig. 2) that was also entirely sequenced. The IAP-AR1 cDNA discloses, within its 5â² half, the characteristic features of an IAP element. Two cDNA clones have been isolated with almost exactly the same most 5â² sequence, extending (within 10-15 bp) to the expected IAP transcription start site located at the 5â² end of the LTR R domain (Fig. 3). The downstream IAP sequences then disclose an overall 97% identity to the sequence of a type IÎ1 IAP element, and more precisely to the previously cloned and entirely sequenced IAP-IL3 element (12Ymer S. Tucker W.Q.J. Campbell H.D. Young I.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1986; 14: 5901-5918Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Both carry the same internal deletion covering the 3â² end of the putative gag gene and extending into the 5â² end of the putative pol gene. However, due to the occurrence of six stop codons within the normally in-phase fusion gag-pol gene, the long (3060 nt) contiguous ORF in IAP-IL3 is reduced to 1776 nt in IAP-AR. Translation and homology searches, however, indicate that both coding domains are still 99% identical. The 3â²-LTR contains the typical U3, R, and U5 subdomains, and is bracketed by the characteristic 4-bp inverted repeats (TGTT and AACA). Alignment of the IAP-AR and IAP-IL3 LTR sequences discloses strong similarities (97.6% identity, excluding the different number of internal repeats in the R domain, see below). Actually, the IAP-AR LTR sequence closely resembles that of the IAP elements specifically expressed in plasmacytomas, i.e. the PC-type IAPs according to the nomenclature in Refs. 19Mietz J.A. Fewell J.W. Kuff E.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 220-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar and 20Lueders K.K. Fewell J.W. Morozov V.E. Kuff E.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 7439-7446Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, and is clearly distinct from the LTR of IAP elements specifically activated in the thymus or in LPS-stimulated B cells, namely the LS-type IAPs (19Mietz J.A. Fewell J.W. Kuff E.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 220-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 20Lueders K.K. Fewell J.W. Morozov V.E. Kuff E.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 7439-7446Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). In the IAP R domains, internally located 13-bp direct repeats, from 1 to 6, are commonly observed (19Mietz J.A. Fewell J.W. Kuff E.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 220-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), which are most probably generated by the retrotransposition process (2Heidmann O. Heidmann T. Cell. 1991; 64: 159-170Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). The IAP-AR sequence contains six such repeats, whereas IAP-IL3 has only one. Finally, it is noteworthy that the IAP-AR R domain contains a canonical (AATAAA) polyadenylation signal which, furthermore, is located within a domain 100% identical (at least within 100 bp) to that of the âfunctionalâ polyadenylation signal (2Heidmann O. Heidmann T. Cell. 1991; 64: 159-170Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar) of the IAP-IL3 sequence. The IAP sequence within IAP-AR1 is then followed by a non-coding sequence containing 4 B1 and 1 B2 repeats. These are highly reiterated mobile elements of the mouse genome classically found in intronic domains, and which are closely related to the human Alu sequences (21Krayev A.S. Kramerov D.A. Skryabin K.G. Ryskov A.P. Bayev A.A. Georgiev G.P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1980; 8: 1201-1215Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar, 22Krayev A.S. Markusheva T.V. Kramerov D.A. Ryskov A.P. Skryabin K.G. Bayev A.A. Georgiev G.P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1982; 10: 7461-7475Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). All repeats except one are in an opposite transcriptional orientation as compared to IAP-AR1. The first B1 repeat is immediately adjacent to the IAP-3â² end, consistent with the fact that IAP sequences are found inserted preferentially close to such repeats (23Lueders K.K. Gene (Amst.). 1987; 52: 139-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). At the 3â² end of the IAP-AR1 cDNA, a 966-nt ORF (nt 7661-8632) can be found (see below), which is followed by a 1104-nt (nt 8633-9718) non-coding region ending with a poly(A) tail. As expected, a putative polyadenylation signal (AATAAA, nt 9704-9709) can be found 15 nt 5â² to this poly(A) tail. Analysis of the 6-kb IAP-AR2 and 3-kb transcripts (clones pB2-12 and pB1-19) reveals the existence of two splicing events (Fig. 2, Fig. 3, Fig. 4). The first splicing event may be described as a gag (nt 378)-"

To perform biological activities efficiently, protein molecules have often evolved mechanisms to couple functionally independent subunits. Such cooperative activity is known to be involved in the regulation of many protein functions including enzyme activity (1Schachman H.K. J. Biol.

Much of our understanding of this process has come from studies of mammalian hemoglobins (5Perutz M.F. Fermi G. Luisi B. Shaanan B. Liddington R.C. Acc. Chem. Res. 1987; 20: 309-321Crossref Scopus (418) Google Scholar, 6Ackers G.K. Doyle M.L. Myers D. Daugherty M.A. Science. 1992; 255: 54-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar), for which cooperativity manifests itself as a stepwise increase in oxygen affinity as oxygen binding proceeds. A particularly simple system for exploring cooperative protein function is the dimeric hemoglobin found in the blood clam Scapharca inaequivalvis, which binds oxygen with a Hill coefficient of 1.5 and shows no change in oxygen affinity or cooperativity as pH varies from 5.5 to 9.0 (7Chiancone E. Vecchini P. Verzili D. Ascoli F. Antonini E. J. Mol. Biol. 1981; 152: 577-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Although the tertiary structure of the subunits is similar to those of mammalian hemoglobins, the assembly into a cooperative complex is radically different (8Royer Jr., W.E. Hendrickson W.A. Chiancone E. Science. 1990; 249: 518-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar).

Intersubunit communication depends upon coupling ligand binding with interactions between subunits. As Wyman (11Wyman Jr., J. Adv. Protein Chem. 1948; 4: 407-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar) recognized nearly 50 years ago, cooperative interaction energy may be present as stabilizing energy between unliganded subunits (quaternary constraint; Ref. 12Monod J. Wyman J. Changeux J.-P. J. Mol. Biol. 1965; 12: 88-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (6174) Google Scholar) or liganded subunits (quaternary enhancement; Ref. 13Mills F.C. Ackers G.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 273-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). These alternate conditions can be distinguished either by measuring the strength of the subunit interface as a function of ligation or by following ligand affinity as subunit dissociation occurs. In the case of quaternary constraint (12Monod J. Wyman J. Changeux J.-P. J. Mol. Biol. 1965; 12: 88-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (6174) Google Scholar), the deoxygenated oligomer would be more tightly assembled than the liganded form, and, since the deoxy assemblage acts to lower oxygen affinity, subunit dissociation would result in increased oxygen affinity. In the case of quaternary enhancement (13Mills F.C. Ackers G.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 273-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), the opposite situation exists: the liganded complex would be more tightly assembled, and lower affinity would result from dissociation into subunits. In human hemoglobin, cooperativity results primarily from quaternary constraints in which the tight deoxy assemblage lowers the intrinsic subunit oxygen affinity, and binding of subsequent ligands leads to a stepwise reduction of these constraints (14Ackers G.K. Biophys. J. 1980; 32: 331-346Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Analysis of equilibrium binding data has suggested that the fourth ligand is bound with higher affinity than isolated chains, an effect termed quaternary enhancement (13Mills F.C. Ackers G.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 273-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). This interpretation has, however, been questioned on the basis of kinetic experiments that appear in conflict with the equilibrium results (see Refs. 15Gibson Q.H. Edelstein S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 516-519Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Philo J.S. Lary J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 139-143Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Ackers G.K. Johnson M.L.

In the case of a mutant human hemoglobin, Hb Ypsilanti (Î²99 Asp â Tyr), assembly of Î±Î² dimers into noncooperative tetramers results in an 85-fold increase in oxygen affinity (19Doyle M.L. Lew G. Turner G.J. Rucknagel D. Ackers G.K. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 1992; 14: 351-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), a clear example of quaternary enhancement. A key structural change upon ligand binding to Scapharca HbI is the extrusion of a phenylalanine (97) from the heme pocket into the subunit interface where it displaces a number of interfacial water molecules (Fig. 1). In deoxy-HbI packing of the Phe-97 side chain in the heme pocket appears to be largely responsible for the low oxygen affinity of this state, and its disposition is central to the proposed cooperative mechanism (9Royer Jr., W.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 235: 657-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). The ligand-linked movement of Phe-97 and disruption of interface water molecules led to the hypothesis that cooperativity in Scapharca HbI could result from quaternary enhancement rather than quaternary constraint. Binding of a ligand to an isolated subunit would require extrusion of Phe-97 into bulk water rather than the intersubunit interface. Since in the dimeric interface Phe-97 can interact with the methyl group of Thr-72â² (from the second subunit), Royer et al. (8Royer Jr., W.E. Hendrickson W.A. Chiancone E. Science. 1990; 249: 518-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) proposed that extrusion of Phe-97 would be more favorable in the dimer than in isolated subunits. This suggests that isolated subunits would bind oxygen with lower affinity than would subunits assembled in a dimer. Then, by the linkage between ligand binding and subunit association, a liganded dimer would be more tightly associated than an unliganded dimer. This appeared reasonable given the additional water molecules in the deoxy interface whose ordering is expected to be entropically unfavorable in contrast with the liganded interface in which additional hydrophobic interactions are present involving Phe-97. The present study was undertaken to test the hypothesis that quaternary enhancement underlies cooperativity in Scapharca dimeric hemoglobin. If this hypothesis were true, the liganded hemoglobin would be more tightly assembled than the unliganded hemoglobin, and oxygen affinity would decrease upon subunit dissociation. Our results demonstrate that the reverse is true: Scapharca dimeric hemoglobin, like human hemoglobin, is more tightly assembled in the unliganded state than in the liganded state, and subunit dissociation leads to an increase in oxygen affinity. Experiments were performed both with Scapharca HbI derived from the clam, kindly provided by Dr. E. Chiancone, University of Rome, and with bacterially expressed recombinant protein (20Summerford C.M. Pardanani A. Betts A.H. Poteete A.R. Colotti G. Royer Jr., W.E. Protein Eng. 1995; 8: 593-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). No differences in assembly were noted for samples from these two different sources. The standard buffer consisted of 0.1 M Tris with 1 mM Na2EDTA, titrated to pH 7.2 with concentrated HCl. Titration and pH measurement were carried out at 20Â°C for chromatography experiments and at room temperature (23Â°C) for centrifugation and oxygen binding experiments. Tris was purchased from Sigma; EDTA was obtained from Fisher Scientific. Analytical gel chromatography experiments were carried out with CO-saturated HbI and buffers using a Sephadex G-75 column (0.9 Ã 40 cm) thermostatted at 20Â°C. For these experiments, the CO-liganded derivative was chosen to minimize the effects of heme oxidation. The void and internal volumes of the column were determined with blue dextran and glycyl-glycine, respectively, and the quality of the column packing was determined from experiments on a variety of nonassociating proteins. Large zone chromatography experiments (21Valdes Jr., R. Ackers G.K. Methods Enzymol. 1979; 61: 74-81Google Scholar) were carried out at a variety of HbI concentrations. For each experiment, â¼25 ml of hemoglobin solution was prepared in standard buffer, filtered (Gelman 0.45 Î¼m) and loaded onto the Sephadex G-75 column. Concentration measurements were carried out spectrophotometrically, using an extinction coefficient of 0.202 (Î¼M heme)â1 for CO-liganded HbI (7Chiancone E. Vecchini P. Verzili D. Ascoli F. Antonini E. J. Mol. Biol. 1981; 152: 577-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). The flow rate of the column was controlled accurately at â¼15 ml/h using a peristaltic pump. Continuous absorbance measurements in the Soret region were made using a Shimadzu UV 160U spectrophotometer and recorded on an associated analog recorder. From experiments at each concentration, the elution volume was determined from the centroid position of the leading boundary of the column profile. The elution volume (V) was used to calculate the weight-average partition coefficient (w) by the relation w = (V â V0)/Vi, where V0 and Vi are the void and internal volumes of the column, respectively. For HbI, which undergoes monomer-dimer assembly (Eq. 1) where w is the weight-average partition coefficient; Ï1 and Ï2 are the partition coefficients for monomer and dimer, respectively; and f1 is the weight fraction of monomer in solution. The weight fraction monomer (f1) is given by (Eq. 2) where Ct is given in units of molar heme (monomer), and 2Ka is the equilibrium association constant for monomer-dimer assembly. (Eq. 3) Values of the monomer-dimer equilibrium constant (2Ka) and the partition coefficient for dimer (Ï2) are resolved from measurement of w as a function of protein concentration. Data analysis was carried out using nonlinear least squares methods (22Johnson M.L. Halvorson H.R. Ackers G.K. Biochemistry. 1976; 15: 5363-5371Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The analysis program uses a modified Gauss-Newton algorithm to obtain parameter values that correspond to a minimum in variance. For experiments on HbI, an independent estimate of the monomer partition coefficient (Ï1) was obtained by experiments using myoglobin (horse heart). This value was fixed to the experimental value of 0.4204 in all data analysis. An estimate of Ï2 (dimer partition coefficient) of 0.2828 Â± 0.0047 was obtained from the data analysis. Samples of HbI-O2 or HbI-CO at approximately 0.4 mg/ml were dialyzed overnight against the standard buffer. In the case of HbI-CO, all solutions were saturated with carbon monoxide. For a typical experiment, samples were diluted 10-fold, 20-fold, and 67-fold with buffer prior to loading in ultracentrifuge cells. For each dilution, 100 Î¼l of hemoglobin sample was loaded into one of the three solution channels of a 12-mm six-channel exterior loading analytical ultracentrifuge cell (23Ansevin A.T. Roark D.E. Yphantis D.A. Anal. Biochem. 1970; 34: 237-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) equipped with Quartz windows. The solution channels had previously been loaded with 10 Î¼l of a fluorocarbon oil (Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing Co., FC-43) to make the bottom of the solution visible. 120 Î¼l of dialyzed solvent was loaded into each of the three solvent channels. In some cases additional (higher or lower) loading concentrations were used. The cells were centrifuged at 30 krpm and 1Â°C overnight in a Beckman XLA analytical ultracentrifuge. Absorption data were acquired using the XLA scanning system (at 417 nm for HbI-O2 and 422 nm for HbI-CO), which records absorption as a function of distance from the center of rotation. The typical error in these readings is approximately 0.005 AU which, under these conditions, corresponds to a concentration error of about 0.5-1.5 Î¼g/ml. Absorption data were spaced at 10-Î¼m intervals down the cell and recorded every 4 h to test for equilibrium. When no change in the gradient was observed after subtracting successive scans, equilibrium was judged to be achieved. Equilibrium required about 35 h of centrifugation after which the final absorption measurements were recorded. Following the 30 krpm run, the centrifuge was accelerated to 40 krpm and maintained at this speed until equilibrium was obtained (about 38 h), permitting a second set of equilibrium measurements to be made. A second series of experiments was performed on other samples of HbI-O2 using the photoelectric scanner of the model E analytical ultracentrifuge. Absorption measurements at 416 and 432 nm were used to monitor the protein gradient. Samples at concentrations of 5, 10, and 20 Î¼g/ml were loaded in 30-mm optical path cells. The cells were centrifuged at 1 and 25Â°C at 30 and 40 krpm. Samples of deoxy-HbI were loaded into centrifuge cells in an anaerobic chamber (Anaerobe Systems, Santa Clara, CA) at concentrations similar to those used for liganded HbI as described above. A significant difficulty resulted from residual oxygen in cell material. Various strategies were pursued to eliminate oxygen from the sample such as using different cell materials (polystyrene and Kel-F), soaking cells in dithionite (sodium hydrosulfite, Sigma), and including dithionite in the deoxy-HbI samples. In the absence of dithionite, the deoxy absorption spectrum was lost within a few hours of loading. In the presence of dithionite, the samples, although maintaining a deoxy spectra, showed varying high values of Z-average molecular mass (Mz) indicating polymerization of HbI. In addition, subsequent exposure to oxygen in the presence of dithionite led to a nearly complete loss of absorbance. Finally, a satisfactory procedure was obtained by loading both solute and solvent channels of Kel-F cells with deoxy-HbI at about 0.4 mg/ml and a small quantity of dithionite and leaving them in the anaerobic chamber for several weeks. The cell solvent channels were then rinsed with several quantities of deoxygenated buffer and then loaded with buffer. The solution channels were rinsed with several volumes of the appropriately diluted deoxy-HbI solution before loading. The hemoglobin remained deoxy, as monitored by the ratio of absorbance at 432 nm to that at 416 nm, for several days of sedimentation at 1Â°C. The cells were centrifuged at 24 krpm until equilibrium was attained followed by centrifugation at 32 krpm. The lower speeds of the deoxy-HbI centrifugation, compared with those used for liganded HbI, were chosen because of the higher values of Mz observed for all deoxy-HbI samples. Absorption data were measured at 416 and 432 nm in the XLA scanning system. An additional deoxy experiment was performed with freshly dialyzed HbI several weeks later. After centrifugation of deoxygenated material, the cells were opened and exposed to air for several hours to permit oxygen binding. The cells were then centrifuged at 32 krpm until equilibrium was achieved. The concentration distribution at equilibrium was analyzed using a nonlinear least squares program (24Johnson M.L. Correia J.J. Halvorson H.R. Yphantis D.A. Biophys. J. 1981; 36: 575-588Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (778) Google Scholar) testing various models. A model assuming an ideal single species (ISS) was first fitted to the combined sets of data from the different sample loading concentrations and speeds of rotation. This provides the value of the molecular mass if an ideal species is present and an Mz if the material is nonideal or a mixture of species. Many other models were then examined: most notable for this experiment is the monomer-dimer model, which yields the molecular mass (M1) of the associating monomer and its association constant. Criteria for goodness of fit is that the root mean square error be small (usually less than 0.01 AU, or about 1 Î¼g/ml) and that it be random (small systematic error in the residuals). Calculation of molecular mass and equilibrium constant from the pattern of concentration with radius in the cell requires the knowledge of the partial specific volume of the protein (Î¥) in its solvent and the density of the solvent (Ï). Based on the amino acid sequence (25Petruzzelli R. Goffredo B.M. Barra D. Bossa F. Boffi A. Verzili D. Ascoli F. Chiancone E. FEBS Lett. 1985; 184: 328-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) the value of Î¥ was calculated as 0.745 (cm3/g). This does not include the heme group, which would be expected to increase its value. Values of Î¥ for human oxy- and deoxyhemoglobin have been reported to be 0.746 and 0.749, respectively, at 20Â°C and 0.09 M NaCl (28Kellett G.K. J. Mol. Biol. 1971; 59: 401-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). For the results reported here, a value of 0.75 was used. The density of the solvent was measured to be 1.004 g/cm3 with a Paar DMA 602 density meter at 20Â°C. (This was corrected to 1.006 and 1.003 g/cm3 at 1 and 25Â°C, respectively.) Oxygen binding to HbI at low concentrations (0.2-8 Î¼M) was followed by tonometric measurements (26Rossi-Fanelli A. Antonini E. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1958; 77: 478-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar) in the Soret region. Samples were deoxygenated at 4Â°C by flushing with nitrogen and were then equilibrated at 23Â°C. Air was introduced with the use of a 2.5-ml gas-tight Hamilton syringe (Fisher Scientific) through a rubber septum and allowed to equilibrate at 23Â°C for 10 min. Absorption readings were recorded at 416, 422, 424, and 434 nm. Significant loss of material was observed with samples at low concentration apparently due to adsorption to the glass tonometer. This problem was eliminated by coating the glass with bovine serum albumin (3 mg/ml) for 30 min prior to oxygen binding measurements. To minimize heme oxidation, the tonometer was also coated for 10 min with a solution containing an enzymatic reduction system (27Hayashi A. Suzuki T. Shin M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1973; 310: 309-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). Following rinsing, residual remaining components were sufficient to eliminate problems with oxidation. This method was used to minimize the strong absorption in the Soret region by catalase, which would obscure the hemoglobin contribution at very low concentrations. Large zone gel chromatography experiments were performed on HbI-CO with solutions ranging in concentration from approximately 5 to 0.05 Î¼M heme. Although the dimeric assemblage is quite stable, a clear increase in elution volume results as concentration is lowered, indicating detectable dissociation in this concentration range. Fig. 2 shows the weight average partition coefficients plotted as a function of HbI concentration along with a theoretical curve based on a best fit of the equilibrium constant and end points. This fit yielded a monomer-dimer association constant (2Ka) of 7.6 Ã 107Mâ1 (Table I).Table I.Association constants for Scapharca HbIMethodLigandTemperatureMz2KaaThe reported sedimentation values were converged upon using a fixed value of 33 kDa for the molecular mass of the dimer.

Open table in a new tab Sedimentation equilibrium experiments were performed in several runs of liganded (O2 or CO) HbI and two runs with unliganded HbI. For each run samples were loaded at three different protein concentrations and centrifuged at two different speeds, providing a total of six data sets/run. The centrifugal depleting effect at the meniscus and concentrating effect at the bottom of the cell result in a range of concentrations studied from lower than 0.06 Î¼M heme to as high as 10 Î¼M heme. Results of the sedimentation equilibrium experiments are presented in Table I. Values are included for the Mz based on the ISS model and for association constants based on a monomer-dimer equilibrium. Experiments were performed measuring absorbance at two wavelengths to observe any wavelength dependence of molecular mass which could indicate the presence of oxidized hemoglobin (28Kellett G.K. J. Mol. Biol. 1971; 59: 401-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The values at the two wavelengths were found to be within the confidence interval of the measurements, therefore averages of the values at both wavelengths are reported in Table I. For liganded species, fits obtained with the monomer-dimer model were significantly better than the fits obtained with the ISS model and far better than any of the other models considered. Although this can be seen from the lower degree of systematic error shown in Fig. 3, a more demanding measure of the superiority of the monomer-dimer model fit to the data is that the ratio of the variance of the two models favored the monomer-dimer fit over the ISS model to greater than a 99.7% confidence limit. In contrast to the liganded species, ultracentrifugation of the deoxygenated samples showed no measurable dissociation and indicated Mz values close to the molecular mass (33.1 kDa) of the dimer. In one experiment (labeled reoxy) following a run of deoxy sample, the cell was opened and allowed to equilibrate with oxygen, then resealed and centrifuged again. This experiment is in good agreement with the other oxyhemoglobin runs (Table I). As is clear from Table I, there is good agreement for the monomer-dimer association constant obtained by gel chromatography and sedimentation equilibrium for HbI-CO. However, lower association constants are observed for the oxygenated samples compared with the HbI-CO. This may reflect a real difference between HbI-CO and HbI-O2, despite their very similar structures (10Condon P.J. Royer Jr., W.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25259-25267Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), or it could result from a slight oxidation of the heme iron which was not detected. (Oxidation of HbI results in a hemichrome species that shows extensive dissociation, with an association constant of about 3 Ã 103Mâ1 at pH 7.0 (29Spagnuola C. Ascoli F. Chiancone E. Vecchini P. Antonini E. J. Mol. Biol. 1983; 164: 627-644Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar).) Thermodynamic coupling between ligation and subunit dissociation (14Ackers G.K. Biophys. J. 1980; 32: 331-346Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) predicts that given a tighter assemblage in the deoxy state compared with the oxy state, oxygen affinity of HbI should increase upon subunit dissociation. To test this prediction, we carried out oxygen binding experiments on solutions with hemoglobin concentrations between 0.2 and 8 Î¼M heme. In this concentration range, significant dissociation of liganded species is expected, based on the chromatography and sedimentation results discussed above. As concentration is lowered, a clear increase in oxygen affinity is observed as indicated by the decrease in p50 (Fig. 4). The observed increase in affinity is coupled with a decrease in cooperativity as evidenced by the Hill coefficient declining from 1.45 at 8 Î¼M heme to 1.25 at 0.2 Î¼M heme, indicative of partial dimer dissociation. Our experiments demonstrate that Scapharca HbI is more tightly assembled into a dimer in the absence of a heme ligand than it is once oxygen or carbon monoxide is bound. Consequently, the energetic coupling of subunit assembly and ligand binding, depicted in Fig. 5, requires that monomers will bind oxygen with higher affinity than dimers. This has been verified by oxygen binding measurements at low hemoglobin concentration which show increased oxygen affinity as a result of partial subunit dissociation. Thus, as in the case of human hemoglobin and other allosteric proteins, quaternary constraint underlies the cooperative mechanism. An important ramification of these experiments is that the more hydrated interface of deoxy-HbI is also the form with the greater subunit interface stability. It is relevant to note that no large quaternary structural changes occur upon ligand binding to HbI. Thus, differences in the stability of the dimer can be interpreted in light of the rather localized ligand-linked structural changes at the subunit interface. As shown in Fig. 1, the high resolution crystal structures reveal the presence of 17 well ordered water molecules arranged in a cluster in the core of the deoxy interface compared with 11 water molecules in HbI-CO or HbI-O2. This crystallographic observation has recently been extended by measurements of oxygen binding as a function of osmotic pressure which indicate that oxygen binding is coupled with the release of approximately six water molecules/hemoglobin dimer (30Royer Jr., W.E. Pardanani A. Gibson Q.H. Peterson E.S. Friedman J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14526-14531Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Significantly, the water molecules in the deoxy interface are more well ordered and provide more favorable hydrogen bonding than those in the liganded interfaces (9Royer Jr., W.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 235: 657-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 10Condon P.J. Royer Jr., W.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25259-25267Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Our present results suggest that these water molecules could contribute to interface stability, despite the entropic cost of their ordering. Removal of just two hydrogen bonds from the protein to the deoxy water cluster by mutation of Thr-72 to Val results in the loss of two water molecules and a 40-fold increase in oxygen affinity (30Royer Jr., W.E. Pardanani A. Gibson Q.H. Peterson E.S. Friedman J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14526-14531Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). This suggests a direct link between the integrity of the interface water cluster and maintenance of the low affinity deoxy conformation, further supporting a contribution by these water molecules to interface stability. Our experiments also reveal that isolated subunits of HbI bind oxygen with higher affinity than those in the dimeric assemblage. The high resolution crystal structures reveal a number of interactions between deoxy subunits which could stabilize their low affinity conformations. A key determinant of oxygen affinity appears to be the conformation of Phe-97 whose side chain packs tightly in the heme pocket in the deoxy state but is extruded into the subunit interface upon ligation (9Royer Jr., W.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 235: 657-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). When packed in the heme pocket, Phe-97 is thought to reduce oxygen affinity by restricting movement of the iron into the heme plane and by lengthening a hydrogen bond involving the proximal histidine (9Royer Jr., W.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 235: 657-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Coupled with the deoxy disposition of Phe-97 is a sharp bend of the F helix and a displacement of the heme group toward the subunit interface. The dimeric assemblage of deoxy-HbI appears to contribute to the stability of these conformations by providing hydrogen bond partners for main chain atoms of the bent F helix (from water molecules) and the heme propionate groups (from Lys-96â², Asn-100â², and water molecules). Thus, the interactions present in the subunit interface appear important for the stability of the low affinity conformation, which is consistent with our present results demonstrating increased oxygen affinity as partial subunit dissociation occurs. The assembly of subunits of Scapharca HbI into a highly stable dimer makes complete elucidation of the thermodynamic linkage between assembly and ligand binding difficult. The results presented here provide estimates for the dissociation constants of liganded forms, but the lack of any observable dissociation of the deoxygenated form precludes an estimate of its stability. As well, the strength of the dimeric interface prevents an accurate estimate of the oxygen affinity of dissociated monomers. To address these issues, we intend to use site-directed mutagenesis of HbI (20Summerford C.M. Pardanani A. Betts A.H. Poteete A.R. Colotti G. Royer Jr., W.E. Protein Eng. 1995; 8: 593-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) to probe the assembly reaction. We thank Drs. Emilia Chiancone and Gianni Colotti for providing purified Scapharca HbI used in our initial experiments and Animesh Pardanani for several helpful discussions."

The carcinogenic and mutagenic effects of BPDE depend on covalent modification of DNA and subsequent interactions with various polymerases. There are a large number of potential adducts which arise by the cis and trans openings of the epoxide group by the exocyclic N2, O6, or N-7 positions of guanine or N6 position of adenine or N4 position of cytidine. Structure-activity studies in several polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon systems have shown that closely related positional or stereoisomers have dramatically different tumorogenicities (10Amin S.

In agreement with the NMR studies, were the in vitro replication studies, using seven polymerases that included both prokaryotic and eukaryotic sources that suggested the C10R and C10S adducts were oriented to the 5â² and 3â² direction on the template, respectively (23Chary P.

In order to elucidate the molecular mechanisms by which polymerases could bypass a lesion site, and to gain an understanding of the structures within the polymerase that govern translesion synthesis, the study of enzymatic functions such as fidelity and regulation of DNA replication is critical. HIV-1 reverse transcriptase (HIV-1 RT) is a hypermutable enzyme that catalyzes the addition of approximately 20,000 nucleotides with extremely low fidelity during replication, resulting in mutations at a frequency of 1/1700 nucleotides inserted (35Patel P.H. Jacobo-Molina A. Ding J. Tantillo C. Clark A.D. Raag R. Nanni R.G. Hughes S.H. Arnold E. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 5351-5363Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 36Preston B.D. Poiesz B.J.

Both the crystal structure and the co-crystal structure with duplex DNA are known and numerous site-specific mutants that were designed with structure-function aspects in mind are readily available (38Bebenek K. Beard W.A. Casas-Finet J.R. Kim H-R Darden T.A. Wilson S.H. Kunkel T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19516-19523Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 39Sarafianos S.G.

This facilitates the choice of HIV-1 RT and its mutants as a unique system in which to monitor polymerase stalling as a diagnostic for adduct directed perturbations. Preliminary primer extension studies using HIV-1 RT revealed that the C10R and C10S BPDE-adducted templates gave different termination sites, but none formed full-length products, except (+)-anti-trans-BPDE (20Chary P. Lloyd R.S. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1996; 9: 409-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Therefore, the present study was undertaken in order to understand if termination occurred due to pausing of the polymerase in the vicinity of the lesion or due to dissociation of the enzyme from the TÂ·;P at this point and subsequent inability to re-initiate synthesis. Furthermore, an attempt has been made to characterize HIV-1 RT and two mutants of Î±-helix H (G262A and W266A) by determining their polymerization behavior on site- and stereospecifically adducted BPDE templates. Because the amino acid residues 262 and 266 are in contact with the duplex region in the vicinity of the DNA minor groove, relatively close to the 3â² terminus of the primer, these two mutants were utilized in the present study. Although these polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon adducts are not likely to be encountered by HIV-1 RT in vivo, they serve as an ideal model for examining the effect of bulky adducts on DNA processing by polymerases. The p66/p51 heterodimeric form of HIV-1 RT was expressed in Escherichia coli from a plasmid containing the precise coding region from HXB2 and was a generous gift from Dr. S. H. Wilson (University of Texas Medical Branch, Galveston, TX) (42Becerra S.P. Kumar A. Lewis M.S. Widen S.G. Abbotts J. Karawya E.M. Hughes S.H. Shiloach J. Wilson S.H. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 11708-11719Crossref Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The alanine-substituted mutant forms of HIV-1 RT, G262A and W266A, were also gifts from Drs. S. H. Wilson and T. A. Kunkel (38Bebenek K. Beard W.A. Casas-Finet J.R. Kim H-R Darden T.A. Wilson S.H. Kunkel T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19516-19523Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). The T4 polynucleotide kinase and T4 DNA ligase were obtained from New England Biolabs Inc. (Beverly, MA). The six stereochemically defined BPDE adducts were constructed on adenine N6 at position two of N-ras codon 61 within an 11-base oligodeoxynucleotide by the post-oligomerization strategy (43Kim S.J. Stone M.P. Harris C.M. Harris T.M. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1992; 114: 5480-5481Crossref Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The six lesions examined herein were (+)- or (â)-anti-trans-, (+)- or (â)-syn-trans-, and (+)- or (â)-anti-cis-BPDE adducts (Fig. 1). Deoxynucleoside triphosphates (100 mM) were obtained from Pharmacia Biotech Inc., and [Î³-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol) utilized for 5â² end labeling of oligodeoxynucleotides was purchased from DuPont NEN. Oligonucleotides of 17, 27, and 29 bases that were used as primers for DNA replication studies were synthesized on an automated Applied Biosystems 394 DNA/RNA synthesizer (Perkins-Elmer/Applied Biosystems Division, Foster City, CA), according to the manufacturer's protocol (Fig. 2). The six BPDE-adducted 11-mers were analyzed for their purity on 15% polyacrylamide sequencing gels prior to ligation with a 22-mer, using a 27-mer scaffold (23Chary P. Lloyd R.S. Nucleic Acids. Res. 1995; 23: 1398-1405Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 43Kim S.J. Stone M.P. Harris C.M. Harris T.M. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1992; 114: 5480-5481Crossref Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The primers and the adducted templates were purified on 10% polyacrylamide gels containing 8 M urea. The corresponding bands were excised, eluted in water, ethanol-precipitated, and excess urea eliminated by six to eight washes with cold absolute alcohol. Purified oligonucleotides and adducted templates were dissolved in water and the concentrations calculated by absorbance measured at 260 nm. In vitro replication assays using HIV-1 RT and its mutants, G262A and W266A, employed the following reaction mixture, with the final concentrations being 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 1.25 mM ATP, 0.3 mM each of the four deoxynucleotide triphosphates (dNTPs), 33 mM Tris-OAc (pH 7.8), 66 mM KOAc, and 10 mM MgOAc. To this reaction mixture were added the adducted or unadducted templates, which had been previously annealed to one of three primers (17-, 27-, or 29-mer) that were 5â²-labeled with [Î³-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol). The TÂ·;P ratio was 5:1 (250 fmol:50 fmol), and 25 fmol of enzyme were added per reaction in a total volume of 10 Î¼l, 37Â°C. At the end of 1 h, the reaction was terminated by the addition of 5 Î¼l of stop buffer (95% formamide, 20 mM EDTA, 0.05% bromphenol blue, and 0.05% xylene cyanol). Primer extension products were separated on 15% polyacrylamide sequencing gels (8.3 M urea) by electrophoresis at 2000 V for 4 h and visualized by autoradiography using Hyperfilm MP (Amersham Corp.). Primer annealing was determined by separation of the annealed mixture on a 10% native polyacrylamide gel, and in each case, more than 99% of the primer existed as a TÂ·;P complex prior to the addition of the enzyme. Quantitation of bands were performed by PhosphorImager analysis (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). The percentage of partial and full-length products were determined in relation to the amount of unextended primers. The conditions utilized in these assays were similar to those described for the primer extension studies, except that there was an initial extension of either unadducted or adducted templates using an unlabeled 29-mer primer. After an initial incubation of 30 min at 37Â°C, unadducted templates annealed to labeled 29-mer primers were added in 5-fold excess, to serve as a hot chase and to monitor for the presence of free enzyme. All four dNTPs (0.3 mM each) were added to the reaction mixture prior to addition of 40 fmol of enzyme. A similar experiment was designed to measure the initial binding of the polymerase to the various substrates. In these experiments each of the three templates was annealed with unlabeled 29-mer primer (5:1 ratio, respectively) and incubated with HIV-1 RT (10:1, primer:enzyme) for 20 min in the absence of dNTPs. Then a 5-fold excess of template, and 17-mer 32P-labeled primer, were added and the reactions initiated by the addition of 0.33 mM dATP and 0.33 mM dGTP only. Aliquots were taken at 0, 0.5, 2, 10, and 20 min and analyzed as described previously. The interactions between BPDE-adducted templates and polymerases under in vitro conditions most often result in replication termination in the vicinity of the DNA base lesion. The goal of this study was to determine whether correlations exist between three properties of polymeraseÂ·;DNA interactions: (i) the extension of a primer on the damaged template and the orientation of the adduct; (ii) the elongation of a primer on an adducted template and the binding of the polymerase to the TÂ·;P complex; and (iii) the ability to form full length products and the specific identity of amino acid residues in the polymerase. In order to study the structure-function interactions between polymerases and damaged DNA during replication, HIV-1 RT was chosen because of its processive nature, low fidelity, and lack of 3â²â 5â² exonucleolytic activity (36Preston B.D. Poiesz B.J. Loeb L.A. Science. 1988; 242: 1168-1171Crossref PubMed Scopus (689) Google Scholar, 37Roberts J.D. Bebenek K. Kunkel T.A. Science. 1988; 242: 1171-1173Crossref PubMed Scopus (735) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the resolution of its crystal and co-crystal structures gives an insight into the various subunits and subdomains and their probable functions (44Kohlstaedt L.A. Wang J. Friedman J.M. Rice P.A. Steitz T.A. Science. 1992; 256: 1783-1790Crossref PubMed Scopus (1763) Google Scholar, 45Jacobo-Molina A. Ding J. Nanni R.G. Clark Jr., A.D. Lux X. Tantillo C. Williams R.L. Kamer G.

HIV-1 RT is a heterodimer with two subunits, p66 and p51, of which both the polymerase and RNase H activities are limited to the p66 subunit. Furthermore, p66 forms a nucleic acid binding cleft constituting the fingers, palm, and thumb subdomains (45Jacobo-Molina A. Ding J. Nanni R.G. Clark Jr., A.D. Lux X. Tantillo C. Williams R.L. Kamer G. Ferris A.L. Clark P. Hizi A. Huges S.H. Arnold E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6320-6324Crossref PubMed Scopus (1122) Google Scholar). The amino acid residues from 257 to 266 are highly conserved and play an important role in catalytic cycling (41Beard W.A. Stahl S.J. Kim H-R. Bebenek K. Kumar A. Strub M-P. Becerra S.P. Kunkel T.A. Wilson S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28091-28097Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These constitute part of the Î±-helix H of the thumb subdomain and play an important role in the movement of the TÂ·;P strand during polymerization. Both the Î±-helices (H and I) track along the DNA 4 to 5 nucleotides from the 3â² primer terminus, with the Î±-helix H in close contact with the primer strand (45Jacobo-Molina A. Ding J. Nanni R.G. Clark Jr., A.D. Lux X. Tantillo C. Williams R.L. Kamer G. Ferris A.L. Clark P. Hizi A. Huges S.H. Arnold E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6320-6324Crossref PubMed Scopus (1122) Google Scholar). The selection of alanine substitution mutants, G262A and W266A, was pertinent because of their role in reduction of processivity and fidelity. Our expectation was that the results obtained using these mutants would shed light on how specific amino acid residues influence the replication fate of BPDE-adducted templates (Fig. 1, Fig. 2). Although enzyme-substrate interactions occur in the minor groove of the DNA, perturbations can be translated as alterations in the major groove, because the two regions are coupled. In order to study the factors that influence the replication of adducted DNAs, three primers were chosen that were 17, 27, and 29 bases in length with a common 5â² end (Fig. 2). These deoxyribonucleotides position their 3â²-OH 11 and 1 base(s) upstream and 1 base beyond the adduct and are indicated by a, b, and c, respectively (Fig. 3). The TÂ·;P complexes were formed with unadducted DNA (panel 1), and each of the six site- and stereospecifically modified BPDE-adducted templates (panels 2-7), and primer extension studies were performed using HIV-1 RT. The C10S and C10R adducted DNA are grouped as B and C, respectively. As shown in the control portion of this experiment (Fig. 3A), when any of the three primers were annealed to unadducted templates, the wild type HIV-1 RT was able to extend these primers to full-length 33-mers and also catalyze a 1 base, blunt-end addition with an efficiency greater than 50%. This non-template-directed extension can possibly be attributed to slippage of the newly synthesized primer strand and the polymerase. However, it seems less likely, because of the absence of homopolymeric or repeated sequences at the end of the single-stranded template (46Bebenek K. Abbotts J. Roberts J.D. Wilson S.H. Kunkel T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 16948-16956Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast to the results obtained by using the unadducted DNAs, two of the C10S adducted templates ((+)-syn-trans- and (â)-anti-cis-) adducts caused the polymerase to terminate 1 base 3â² to the damaged site, using a 17-mer primer (panel 3, lane a, and panel 4, lane a, respectively), resulting in the accumulation of products that were 27 bases in length. Little to no extension was visible with the 27-mer primer (panel 3, lane b, and panel 4, lane b, respectively). However, by using either of these primers, full-length products were obtained when an (+)-anti-trans-BPDE-adducted template (C10S) was utilized for primer extension (panel 2, lanes a and b). Also in contrast, all adducts bearing the R configuration at the C10 position (group C) of the BPDE moiety ((â)-anti-trans, (â)-syn-trans, and (+)-anti-cis) (panel 5, lanes a and b, and panel 6, lanes a and b, and panel 7, lanes a and b, respectively) did not promote termination 1 base prior to or opposite the lesion, but caused HIV-1 RT to form truncated products 1 base beyond the lesion, with generally negligible accumulation of full-length products. These reactions were performed under multiple hit conditions. However, observations under single hit conditions showed that both the C10R and C10S adducted templates formed truncated products that terminated one base prior to the lesion (data not shown). The primer extension results obtained using the adducted templates with a 29-mer primer, which initiates synthesis 1 base beyond the lesion are presented in lane c of panels 2-7. All the C10S BPDE-adducted templates ((+)-anti-trans, (+)-syn-trans, and (â)-anti-cis-) (panel 2, lane c, panel 3, lane c, and panel 4, lane c, respectively) allowed for the formation of full-length products when the lesion was located in the TÂ·;P stem. These fully extended products were formed at levels similar to the unadducted templates. In contrast, two of the three C10R adducted templates examined allowed negligible formation of full-length products. The (â)-syn-trans-BPDE-adducted template (panel 6, lane c) was unique in that a prominent termination site 4 bases beyond the site of lesion was observed in addition to a significant amount of fully extended products. In our subsequent experiments, similar observations were made when 73-mer unadducted and adducted DNAs were used as templates in which there is a 44-nucleotide single-stranded overhang (data not shown). These results indicate that the orientation of C10S and C10R BPDE adducts in the template strand has a major influence on protein-DNA interactions, independent of the length of the single-stranded template overhangs (data not shown). End effects are considered to play a role in nucleotide discrimination, especially in regard to the incorporation of dideoxynucleotides. However, there are reports to suggest that the catalytic efficiency of nucleotide incorporation is independent of the length of the template overhang and that the ability to place a nucleotide opposite the 5â² end of the template is the same as it is to place a nucleotide at any other position (35Patel P.H. Jacobo-Molina A. Ding J. Tantillo C. Clark A.D. Raag R. Nanni R.G. Hughes S.H. Arnold E. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 5351-5363Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Analyses of the data presented in Fig. 3 revealed that the most significant contrast between a matched set of C10S and C10R BPDE adducts was for the (+)- and (â)-anti-trans-lesions, such that all primers could be readily utilized for the (+)-anti-trans, while replication was blocked 1 base beyond the lesion for the (â)-anti-trans-containing template (panels 2 and 5, respectively). These data raised further questions regarding the mechanism by which the (â)-anti-trans-lesion blocked replication, while the (+)-anti-trans-lesion allowed facile bypass. One possibility for this apparent distinction could be the inability of the polymerase to bind to the (â)-anti-trans-BPDE-adducted template, once the primer had been extended 1 base beyond the lesion site. In order to determine whether there was differential binding and subsequent dissociation from a primer that is 1 base beyond the lesion, the following experiment was designed and carried out (Fig. 4). Three TÂ·;P complexes were formed wherein the template (33-mer) was either unadducted or contained a (+)- or (â)-anti-trans-BPDE lesion and the primer utilized (29-mer) was unlabeled. The TÂ·;P ratio was 5:1 to ensure complete primer annealing. Limiting amounts of polymerase were added in the absence of dNTPs, such that the primer:polymerase ratio was 10:1. This mixture was allowed to equilibrate initially for 20 min and then a 5-fold excess of unadducted T (33-mer)Â·;P (17-mer) complexes were added to each of the three samples, in which the primer was 32P-labeled. This incubation was carried out in the presence of dATP and dGTP alone, which allowed replication to occur exclusively on the labeled 17-mer primer strand, since the immediate upstream bases on its template were C, T, T, while the immediate bases that would need to be incorporated on the unlabeled 29-mer primer were A, G, G. Thus, the rate of extension of the labeled primer would be a measure of the relative binding and dissociation from the original templa"
