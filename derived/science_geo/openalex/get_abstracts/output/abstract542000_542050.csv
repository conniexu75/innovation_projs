https://openalex.org/W2218943248,"Individualized neuronal mutations in the human brain The neurons of the human brain can last for decades, carrying out computational and signaling functions. Lodato et al. analyzed the DNA of individual neurons sampled from postmortem human brains and found that individual neurons acquired somatic mutations (see the Perspective by Linnarsson). The mechanism of mutation involved gene transcription rather than DNA replication. Thus, postmitotic neurons would seem to be their own worst enemy: Genes used for neuronal function are the very genes put most at risk of somatic mutation.

High-precision (40)Ar/(39)Ar data indicate that these two mechanisms may be genetically related, and neither can be considered in isolation. The existing Deccan Traps magmatic system underwent a state shift approximately coincident with the Chicxulub impact and the terminal-Cretaceous mass extinctions, after which ~70% of the Traps' total volume was extruded in more massive and more episodic eruptions. Initiation of this new regime occurred within ~50,000 years of the impact, which is consistent with transient effects of impact-induced seismic energy. Postextinction recovery of marine ecosystems was probably suppressed until after the accelerated volcanism waned."
https://openalex.org/W2209562479,"Despite decades of study, the structures adopted to accommodate an excess proton in water and the mechanism by which they interconvert remain elusive. We used ultrafast two-dimensional infrared (2D IR) spectroscopy to investigate protons in aqueous hydrochloric acid solutions. By exciting O-H stretching vibrations and detecting the spectral response throughout the mid-IR region, we observed the interaction between the stretching and bending vibrations characteristic of the flanking waters of the Zundel complex, [H(H2O)2](+), at 3200 and 1760 cm(-1), respectively. From time-dependent shifts of the stretch-bend cross peak, we determined a lower limit on the lifetime of this complex of 480 femtoseconds. These results suggest a key role for the Zundel complex in aqueous proton transfer."
https://openalex.org/W2209524597,"Recently emerging two-dimensional (2D) superconductors in atomically thin layers and at heterogeneous interfaces are attracting growing interest in condensed matter physics. Here, we report that an ion-gated zirconium nitride chloride surface, exhibiting a dome-shaped phase diagram with a maximum critical temperature of 14.8 kelvin, behaves as a superconductor persisting to the 2D limit. The superconducting thickness estimated from the upper critical fields is ≅ 1.8 nanometers, which is thinner than one unit-cell. The majority of the vortex phase diagram down to 2 kelvin is occupied by a metallic state with a finite resistance, owing to the quantum creep of vortices caused by extremely weak pinning and disorder. Our findings highlight the potential of electric-field-induced superconductivity, establishing a new platform for accessing quantum phases in clean 2D superconductors."

To define some of these functions, Wu et al. made libraries of mutants of Bacteroides species known for their capacity to process otherwise intractable dietary fiber. Germ-free mice colonized with defined gut microbiota communities containing the mutants were fed specific diets containing different ratios of fat and fiber. Genes, strains, and species were identified that were associated with specific metabolic pathways. The community responses to dietary shifts were manipulated in an attempt to characterize species for their probiotic or therapeutic potential. Science , this issue 10.1126/science.aac5992 &gt;"

This motion, in the form of vacuum fluctuations, is generally considered to be an elusive phenomenon that manifests itself only indirectly. Here, we report direct detection of the vacuum fluctuations of electromagnetic radiation in free space. The ground-state electric-field variance is inversely proportional to the four-dimensional space-time volume, which we sampled electro-optically with tightly focused laser pulses lasting a few femtoseconds. Subcycle temporal readout and nonlinear coupling far from resonance provide signals from purely virtual photons without amplification. Our findings enable an extreme time-domain approach to quantum physics, with nondestructive access to the quantum state of light. Operating at multiterahertz frequencies, such techniques might also allow time-resolved studies of intrinsic fluctuations of elementary excitations in condensed matter."

In the central nervous system, GABA synthesis is usually mediated by two glutamate decarboxylases (GAD65 and GAD67). Kim et al. found that midbrain dopaminergic neurons use a different, evolutionary conserved GABA synthesis pathway that is independent of GAD65 and GAD67. These cells synthesize GABA from putrescine via the enzymes diamine oxidase and aldehyde dehydrogenase 1a1. GABA synthesized by this pathway accounts for approximately 70% of co-released GABA.

https://openalex.org/W2162938388,"Dendritic cells can capture and transfer retroviruses in vitro across synaptic cell-cell contacts to uninfected cells, a process called trans-infection. Whether trans-infection contributes to retroviral spread in vivo remains unknown. Here, we visualize how retroviruses disseminate in secondary lymphoid tissues of living mice. We demonstrate that murine leukemia virus (MLV) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) are first captured by sinus-lining macrophages. CD169/Siglec-1, an I-type lectin that recognizes gangliosides, captures the virus. MLV-laden macrophages then form long-lived synaptic contacts to trans-infect B-1 cells. Infected B-1 cells subsequently migrate into the lymph node to spread the infection through virological synapses. Robust infection in lymph nodes and spleen requires CD169, suggesting that a combination of fluid-based movement followed by CD169-dependent trans-infection can contribute to viral spread."

Environmental insults and growth defects can challenge these developmental programs. In order to limit the resultant variation, juvenile organisms buffer variability through homeostatic mechanisms, so that the correct final size is attained. Vallejo et al. report that the Drosophila brain mediates such homeostatic control via an insulin-like peptide Dilp8 binding to the relaxin hormone receptor Lgr3. Lgr3 neurons distribute this information to other neuronal populations to adjust the hormones ecdysone, insulin, and juvenile hormone in a manner that stabilizes body and organ size.

https://openalex.org/W2173144055,"Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a common cause of community-acquired and nosocomial-acquired pneumonia. The development of resistance of P. aeruginosa to antibiotics is increasing globally due to the overuse of antibiotics. This article examines, retrospectively, the antibiotic resistance in patients with community-acquired versus nosocomial-acquired pneumonia caused by P. aeruginosa or multidrug-resistant (MDR) P. aeruginosa.Data from patients with community-acquired and nosocomial-acquired pneumonia caused by P. aeruginosa and MDR P. aeruginosa were collected from the hospital charts at the HELIOS Clinic, Witten/Herdecke University, Wuppertal, Germany, between January 2004 and August 2014. An antibiogram was created from all study patients with community-acquired and nosocomial-acquired pneumonia caused by P. aeruginosa or MDR P. aeruginosa.A total of 168 patients with mean age 68.1 ± 12.8 (113 [67.3% males and 55 [32.7%] females) were identified; 91 (54.2%) had community-acquired and 77 (45.8%) had nosocomial-acquired pneumonia caused by P. aeruginosa. Patients with community-acquired versus nosocomial-acquired pneumonia had a mean age of 66.4 ± 13.8 vs. 70.1 ± 11.4 years [59 vs. 54 (64.8% vs. 70.1%) males and 32 vs. 23 (35.2% vs. 29.9%) females]. They included 41 (24.4%) patients with pneumonia due to MDR P. aeruginosa: 27 (65.9%) community-acquired and 14 (34.1%) nosocomial-acquired cases. P. aeruginosa and MDR P. aeruginosa showed a very high resistance to fosfomycin (community-acquired vs. nosocomial-acquired) (81.0% vs. 84.2%; 0 vs. 85.7%). A similar resistance pattern was seen with ciprofloxacin (35.2% vs. 24.0%; 70.4% vs. 61.5%), levofloxacin (34.6% vs. 24.5%; 66.7% vs. 64.3%), ceftazidime (15.9% vs. 30.9; 33.3% vs. 61.5%), piperacillin (24.2% vs. 29.9%; 44.4% vs. 57.1%), imipenem (28.6% vs. 27.3%; 55.6% vs. 50.0%), piperacillin and tazobactam (23.1% vs. 28.6%; 44.4% vs. 50.0%), tobramycin (28.0% vs. 17.2%; 52.0% vs. 27.3%), gentamicin (26.4% vs. 18.2%; 44.4% vs. 21.4%), and meropenem (20.2% vs. 20.3%; 42.3% vs. 50.0%). An elevated resistance of P. aeruginosa and MDR P. aeruginosa was found for cefepime (11.1% vs. 23.3%; 25.9% vs. 50.0%), and amikacin (10.2% vs. 9.1%; 27.3% vs. 9.1%). Neither pathogen was resistant to colistin (P = 0.574).While P. aeruginosa and MDR P. aeruginosa were resistant to a variety of commonly used antibiotics, they were not resistant to colistin in the few isolates recovered from patients with pneumonia."
https://openalex.org/W2103168411,"Calcineurin inhibitors, such as cyclosporine A and FK506, are used as immunosuppressant drugs, but their adverse effects on male reproductive function remain unclear. The testis expresses somatic calcineurin and a sperm-specific isoform that contains a catalytic subunit (PPP3CC) and a regulatory subunit (PPP3R2). We demonstrate herein that male mice lacking Ppp3cc or Ppp3r2 genes (knockout mice) are infertile, with reduced sperm motility owing to an inflexible midpiece. Treatment of mice with cyclosporine A or FK506 creates phenocopies of the sperm motility and morphological defects. These defects appear within 4 to 5 days of treatment, which indicates that sperm-specific calcineurin confers midpiece flexibility during epididymal transit. Male mouse fertility recovered a week after we discontinued treatment. Because human spermatozoa contain PPP3CC and PPP3R2 as a form of calcineurin, inhibition of this sperm-specific calcineurin may lead to the development of a reversible male contraceptive that would target spermatozoa in the epididymis."

We used ribosome profiling and RNA sequencing to quantify the translational status and transcript levels in the mouse hippocampus after contextual fear conditioning. We revealed three types of repressive regulations: translational suppression of ribosomal protein-coding genes in the hippocampus, learning-induced early translational repression of specific genes, and late persistent suppression of a subset of genes via inhibition of estrogen receptor 1 (ESR1/ERα) signaling. In behavioral analyses, overexpressing Nrsn1, one of the newly identified genes undergoing rapid translational repression, or activating ESR1 in the hippocampus impaired memory formation. Collectively, this study unveils the yet-unappreciated importance of gene repression mechanisms for memory formation."

When cloud liquid water is reduced upon mixing, droplets may evaporate uniformly across the population or, in the other extreme, a subset of droplets may evaporate completely, leaving the remaining drops unaffected. Here, we use airborne holographic imaging to visualize the spatial structure and droplet size distribution at the smallest turbulent scales, thereby observing their response to entrainment and mixing with clear air. The measurements reveal that turbulent clouds are inhomogeneous, with sharp transitions between cloud and clear air properties persisting to dissipative scales (<1 centimeter). The local droplet size distribution fluctuates strongly in number density but with a nearly unchanging mean droplet diameter."

This study assessed the utility of the novel non-invasive ophthalmic technique of corneal confocal microscopy in identifying neuropathy in patients with upper gastrointestinal cancer before and after platinum based chemotherapy. In this study, 21 subjects with upper gastrointestinal (oesophageal or gastric) cancer and 21 healthy control subjects underwent assessment of neuropathy using the neuropathy disability score, quantitative sensory testing for vibration perception threshold, warm and cold sensation thresholds, cold and heat induced pain thresholds, nerve conduction studies and corneal confocal microscopy. Patients with gastro-oesophageal cancer had higher heat induced pain (P = 0.04) and warm sensation (P = 0.03) thresholds with a significantly reduced sural sensory (P<0.01) and peroneal motor (P<0.01) nerve conduction velocity, corneal nerve fibre density (CNFD), nerve branch density (CNBD) and nerve fibre length (CNFL) (P<0.0001). Furthermore, CNFD correlated significantly with the time from presentation with symptoms to commencing chemotherapy (r = -0.54, P = 0.02), and CNFL (r = -0.8, P<0.0001) and CNBD (r = 0.63, P = 0.003) were related to the severity of lymph node involvement. After the 3rd cycle of chemotherapy, there was no change in any measure of neuropathy, except for a significant increase in CNFL (P = 0.003). Corneal confocal microscopy detects a small fibre neuropathy in this cohort of patients with upper gastrointestinal cancer, which was related to disease severity. Furthermore, the increase in CNFL after the chemotherapy may indicate nerve regeneration."
https://openalex.org/W2183411362,"Motivation facilitates recovery after neuronal damage, but its mechanism is elusive. It is generally thought that the nucleus accumbens (NAc) regulates motivation-driven effort but is not involved in the direct control of movement. Using causality analysis, we identified the flow of activity from the NAc to the sensorimotor cortex (SMC) during the recovery of dexterous finger movements after spinal cord injury at the cervical level in macaque monkeys. Furthermore, reversible pharmacological inactivation of the NAc during the early recovery period diminished high-frequency oscillatory activity in the SMC, which was accompanied by a transient deficit of amelioration in finger dexterity obtained by rehabilitation. These results demonstrate that during recovery after spinal damage, the NAc up-regulates the high-frequency activity of the SMC and is directly involved in the control of finger movements."

Functional patterns that have evolved during an ecosystem's history support significantly more stable communities than hypothetical alternatives."

While nuclear size is exquisitely controlled in different cell types, inappropriate nuclear enlargement is used to diagnose and stage cancer. Clarifying the functional significance of nuclear size necessitates an understanding of the mechanisms and proteins that control nuclear size. One structural component implicated in the regulation of nuclear morphology is the nuclear lamina, a meshwork of intermediate lamin filaments that lines the inner nuclear membrane. However, there has not been a systematic investigation of how the level and type of lamin expression influences nuclear size, in part due to difficulties in precisely controlling lamin expression levels in vivo. In this study, we circumvent this limitation by studying nuclei in Xenopus laevis egg and embryo extracts, open biochemical systems that allow for precise manipulation of lamin levels by the addition of recombinant proteins. We find that nuclear growth and size are sensitive to the levels of nuclear lamins, with low and high concentrations increasing and decreasing nuclear size, respectively. Interestingly, each type of lamin that we tested (lamins B1, B2, B3, and A) similarly affected nuclear size whether added alone or in combination, suggesting that total lamin concentration, and not lamin type, is more critical to determining nuclear size. Furthermore, we show that altering lamin levels in vivo, both in Xenopus embryos and mammalian tissue culture cells, also impacts nuclear size.

https://openalex.org/W2222165430,"Parathyroid-hormone-type 1 receptor (PTH1R) is extensively expressed in key regulatory organs for systemic mineral ion homeostasis, including kidney and bone. We investigated the bone-specific functions of PTH1R in modulating mineral ion homeostasis by generating a novel mouse model in which PTH1R is ablated in the limb mesenchyme using Prx1Cre transgenic mice. Such ablation decreased FGF23 protein and serum levels by 50%, despite normal Fgf23 mRNA levels in long bones. Circulating calcium and PTH levels were unchanged, but inorganic phosphate and 1,25(OH)2D3 levels were significantly decreased and accompanied by elevated urinary calcium and phosphate wasting. Key renal genes for balancing mineral ion homeostasis, calbindinD28k, Klotho, and Napi2a were suppressed by 30-40%. Intermittent hPTH(1-34) injections increased Fgf23 mRNA (7.3-fold), Nurr1 mRNA (3.1-fold), and serum intact-FGF23 (1.6-fold) in controls, but failed to induce Fgf23, Nurr1 mRNA, or intact FGF23 production in mutants. Moreover, a significant elevation in serum C-terminal-FGF23 levels (4-fold) was detected in both genotypes. PTH markedly downregulated Galnt3 expression (2.7-fold) in controls but not in mutants.

https://openalex.org/W2138774205,"Background The current clinical classification of chronic kidney disease (CKD) is not perfect and may be overestimating both the prevalence and the risk for progressive disease. Novel markers are being sought to identify those at risk of progression. This preliminary study evaluates the feasibility of magnetic resonance imaging based markers to identify early changes in CKD. Methods Fifty-nine subjects (22 healthy, 7 anemics with no renal disease, 30 subjects with CKD) participated. Data using 3D volume imaging, blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) and Diffusion MRI was acquired. BOLD MRI acquisition was repeated after 20 mg of iv furosemide. Results Compared to healthy subjects, those with CKD have lower renal parenchymal volumes (329.6±66.4 vs. 257.1±87.0 ml, p<0.005), higher cortical R2* values (19.7±3.2 vs. 23.2±6.3 s−1, p = 0.013) (suggesting higher levels of hypoxia) and lower response to furosemide on medullary R2* (6.9±3.3 vs. 3.1±7.5 s−1, p = 0.02). All three parameters showed significant correlation with estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). When the groups were matched for age and sex, cortical R2* and kidney volume still showed significant differences between CKD and healthy controls. The most interesting observation is that a small number of subjects (8 of 29) contributed to the increase in mean value observed in CKD. The difference in cortical R2* between these subjects compared to the rest were highly significant and had a large effect size (Cohen’s d = 3.5). While highly suggestive, future studies may be necessary to verify if such higher levels of hypoxia are indicative of progressive disease. Diffusion MRI showed no differences between CKD and healthy controls. Conclusions These data demonstrate that BOLD MRI can be used to identify enhanced hypoxia associated with CKD and the preliminary observations are consistent with the chronic hypoxia model for disease progression in CKD. Longitudinal studies are warranted to further verify these findings and assess their predictive value."
https://openalex.org/W2204442223,"Purpose To report the methodology and findings of a large scale investigation of burden and distribution of refractive error, from a contemporary and ethnically diverse study of health and disease in adults, in the UK. Methods U K Biobank, a unique contemporary resource for the study of health and disease, recruited more than half a million people aged 40–69 years. A subsample of 107,452 subjects undertook an enhanced ophthalmic examination which provided autorefraction data (a measure of refractive error). Refractive error status was categorised using the mean spherical equivalent refraction measure. Information on socio-demographic factors (age, gender, ethnicity, educational qualifications and accommodation tenure) was reported at the time of recruitment by questionnaire and face-to-face interview. Results Fifty four percent of participants aged 40–69 years had refractive error. Specifically 27% had myopia (4% high myopia), which was more common amongst younger people, those of higher socio-economic status, higher educational attainment, or of White or Chinese ethnicity. The frequency of hypermetropia increased with age (7% at 40–44 years increasing to 46% at 65–69 years), was higher in women and its severity was associated with ethnicity (moderate or high hypermetropia at least 30% less likely in non-White ethnic groups compared to White). Conclusions Refractive error is a significant public health issue for the UK and this study provides contemporary data on adults for planning services, health economic modelling and monitoring of secular trends. Further investigation of risk factors is necessary to inform strategies for prevention. There is scope to do this through the planned longitudinal extension of the UK Biobank study."
https://openalex.org/W1887762876,"Tetrabromobisphenol A (TBBPA) is one of the most widely used brominated flame retardants and has attracted more and more attention. In this work, the parent TBBPA with an initial concentration of 100 mg/L was completely removed after 6 min of ozonation at pH 8.0, and alkaline conditions favored a more rapid removal than acidic and neutral conditions. The presence of typical anions and humic acid did not significantly affect the degradation of TBBPA. The quenching test using isopropanol indicated that direct ozone oxidation played a dominant role during this process. Seventeen reaction intermediates and products were identified using an electrospray time-of-flight mass spectrometer. Notably, the generation of 2,4,6-tribromophenol was first observed in the degradation process of TBBPA. The evolution of reaction products showed that ozonation is an efficient treatment for removal of both TBBPA and intermediates. Sequential transformation of organic bromine to bromide and bromate was confirmed by ion chromatography analysis. Two primary reaction pathways that involve cleavage of central carbon atom and benzene ring cleavage concomitant with debromination were thus proposed and further justified by calculations of frontier electron densities. Furthermore, the total organic carbon data suggested a low mineralization rate, even after the complete removal of TBBPA. Meanwhile, the acute aqueous toxicity of reaction solutions to Photobacterium Phosphoreum and Daphnia magna was rapidly decreased during ozonation. In addition, no obvious difference in the attenuation of TBBPA was found by ozone oxidation using different water matrices, and the effectiveness in natural waters further demonstrates that ozonation can be adopted as a promising technique to treat TBBPA-contaminated waters."

https://openalex.org/W2131449959,"Millions of long-lasting insecticide treated nets (LLINs) have been distributed as part of the global malaria control strategy. LLIN ownership, however, does not necessarily guarantee use. Thus, even in the ideal setting in which universal coverage with LLINs has been achieved, maximal malaria protection will only be achieved if LLINs are used both correctly and consistently. This study investigated the factors associated with net use, independent of net ownership. Data were collected during a household survey conducted in Ebonyi State in southeastern Nigeria in November 2011 following a statewide mass LLIN distribution campaign and, in select locations, a community-based social behavior change (SBC) intervention. Logistic regression analyses, controlling for household bed net ownership, were conducted to examine the association between individual net use and various demographic, environmental, behavioral and social factors. The odds of net use increased among individuals who were exposed to tailored SBC in the context of a home visit (OR = 17.11; 95% CI 4.45–65.79) or who received greater degrees of social support from friends and family (ptrend < 0.001). Factors associated with decreased odds of net use included: increasing education level (ptrend = 0.020), increasing malaria knowledge level (ptrend = 0.022), and reporting any disadvantage of bed nets (OR = 0.39; 95% CI 0.23–0.78). The findings suggest that LLIN use is significantly influenced by social support and exposure to a malaria-related SBC home visit. The malaria community should thus further consider the importance of community outreach, interpersonal communication and social support on adoption of net use behaviors when designing future research and interventions."
https://openalex.org/W2268663278,"Cytomegalovirus (CMV) is a ubiquitous and persistent human pathogen that is kept in check by CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocytes. Individuals expressing the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecule HLA-A2 produce cytotoxic T lymphocytes bearing T cell receptors (TCRs) that recognize the immunodominant CMV epitope NLVPMVATV (NLV). The NLV-specific T cell repertoire is characterized by a high prevalence of TCRs that are frequently observed in multiple unrelated individuals. These public TCRs feature identical, or nearly identical, complementarity-determining region 3α (CDR3α) and/or CDR3β sequences. The TCRs may express public CDR3α motifs alone, public CDR3β motifs alone, or dual public CDR3αβ motifs. In addition, the same public CDR3α motif may pair with different CDR3β motifs (and the reverse), giving rise to highly diverse NLV-specific TCR repertoires. To investigate the structural underpinnings of this clonal diversity, we determined crystal structures of two public TCRs (C7 and C25) in complex with NLV·HLA-A2. These TCRs utilize completely different CDR3α and CDR3β motifs that, in addition, can associate with multiple variable α and variable β regions in NLV-specific T cell repertoires. The C7·NLV·HLA-A2 and C25·NLV·HLA-A2 complexes exhibit divergent TCR footprints on peptide-MHC such that C25 is more focused on the central portion of the NLV peptide than is C7. These structures combined with molecular modeling show how the public CDR3α motif of C25 may associate with different variable α regions and how the public CDR3α motif of C7 may pair with different CDR3β motifs. This interchangeability of TCR V regions and CDR3 motifs permits multiple structural solutions to binding an identical peptide-MHC ligand and thereby the generation of a clonally diverse public T cell response to CMV.

Individuals expressing the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecule HLA-A2 produce cytotoxic T lymphocytes bearing T cell receptors (TCRs) that recognize the immunodominant CMV epitope NLVPMVATV (NLV). The NLV-specific T cell repertoire is characterized by a high prevalence of TCRs that are frequently observed in multiple unrelated individuals. These public TCRs feature identical, or nearly identical, complementarity-determining region 3α (CDR3α) and/or CDR3β sequences. The TCRs may express public CDR3α motifs alone, public CDR3β motifs alone, or dual public CDR3αβ motifs. In addition, the same public CDR3α motif may pair with different CDR3β motifs (and the reverse), giving rise to highly diverse NLV-specific TCR repertoires. To investigate the structural underpinnings of this clonal diversity, we determined crystal structures of two public TCRs (C7 and C25) in complex with NLV·HLA-A2. These TCRs utilize completely different CDR3α and CDR3β motifs that, in addition, can associate with multiple variable α and variable β regions in NLV-specific T cell repertoires. The C7·NLV·HLA-A2 and C25·NLV·HLA-A2 complexes exhibit divergent TCR footprints on peptide-MHC such that C25 is more focused on the central portion of the NLV peptide than is C7. These structures combined with molecular modeling show how the public CDR3α motif of C25 may associate with different variable α regions and how the public CDR3α motif of C7 may pair with different CDR3β motifs. This interchangeability of TCR V regions and CDR3 motifs permits multiple structural solutions to binding an identical peptide-MHC ligand and thereby the generation of a clonally diverse public T cell response to CMV."
https://openalex.org/W2185447678,"Sperm-specific phospholipase C-ζ (PLCζ) is widely considered to be the physiological stimulus that triggers intracellular Ca2+ oscillations and egg activation during mammalian fertilization. Although PLCζ is structurally similar to PLCδ1, it lacks a pleckstrin homology domain, and it remains unclear how PLCζ targets its phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) membrane substrate. Recently, the PLCδ1 EF-hand domain was shown to bind to anionic phospholipids through a number of cationic residues, suggesting a potential mechanism for how PLCs might interact with their target membranes. Those critical cationic EF-hand residues in PLCδ1 are notably conserved in PLCζ. We investigated the potential role of these conserved cationic residues in PLCζ by generating a series of mutants that sequentially neutralized three positively charged residues (Lys-49, Lys-53, and Arg-57) within the mouse PLCζ EF-hand domain. Microinjection of the PLCζ EF-hand mutants into mouse eggs enabled their Ca2+ oscillation inducing activities to be compared with wild-type PLCζ. Furthermore, the mutant proteins were purified, and the in vitro PIP2 hydrolysis and binding properties were monitored. Our analysis suggests that PLCζ binds significantly to PIP2, but not to phosphatidic acid or phosphatidylserine, and that sequential reduction of the net positive charge within the first EF-hand domain of PLCζ significantly alters in vivo Ca2+ oscillation inducing activity and in vitro interaction with PIP2 without affecting its Ca2+ sensitivity. Our findings are consistent with theoretical predictions provided by a mathematical model that links oocyte Ca2+ frequency and the binding ability of different PLCζ mutants to PIP2. Moreover, a PLCζ mutant with mutations in the cationic residues within the first EF-hand domain and the XY linker region dramatically reduces the binding of PLCζ to PIP2, leading to complete abolishment of its Ca2+ oscillation inducing activity.

During fertilization, the spermatozoon initiates activation of egg development by triggering an acute rise in cytosolic free Ca2+ concentration (1Stricker S.A. Comparative biology of calcium signaling during fertilization and egg activation in animals.Dev. Biol. 1999; 211: 157-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (582) Google Scholar). In mammals, this manifests as a series of distinctive cytosolic Ca2+ oscillations, beginning soon after sperm-egg fusion and persisting for several hours (2Nomikos M. Kashir J. Swann K. Lai F.A.

The closest PLC homologue of sperm PLCζ is PLCδ1 (47% similarity, 33% identity), which is only able to cause Ca2+ oscillations in mouse eggs at non-physiological concentrations, because it has a >50-fold lower potency (2Nomikos M.

PLCζ is the smallest PLC with the simplest domain organization among all the mammalian isoforms. PLCζ consists of four tandem EF-hand domains, the characteristic X and Y catalytic domains in the center of the molecule, and a C-terminal C2 domain. All these domains are common to the other PLC isoforms (β, γ, δ, ϵ, and η), but they appear to individually have an essential role in the unique mode of regulation of this distinctive PLC isozyme (2Nomikos M.

A notable structural difference between PLCζ and the other somatic PLC isoforms is that PLCζ lacks a pleckstrin homology (PH) domain at the N terminus (2Nomikos M. Kashir J. Swann K. Lai F.A.

The membrane binding of somatic PLCs appears to be mediated by the PH domain, a well defined structural module of ∼120-amino acid residues identified in numerous proteins (14Dowler S. Currie R.A. Campbell D.G. Deak M. Kular G. Downes C.P. Alessi D.R. Identification of pleckstrin-homology-domain-containing proteins with novel phosphoinositide-binding specificities.Biochem. J. 2000; 351: 19-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar). The PH domain of PLCδ1 is essential for interaction with its phospholipid substrate PIP2 in the plasma membrane (15Lomasney J.W. Cheng H.F. Wang L.P. Kuan Y. Liu S. Fesik S.W. King K. Phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate binding to the pleckstrin homology domain of phospholipase C-δ1 enhances enzyme activity.J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25316-25326Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). The absence of a PH domain from PLCζ sequence raises questions about how PLCζ can bind to membranes. We have previously proposed that the PLCζ XY-linker, a segment between the X and Y catalytic domains that is notably different from the corresponding XY-linker region of somatic PLCs, is involved in the targeting of PLCζ to its membrane-bound substrate PIP2 (16Nomikos M. Mulgrew-Nesbitt A. Pallavi P. Mihalyne G. Zaitseva I. Swann K. Lai F.A. Murray D. McLaughlin S. Binding of phosphoinositide-specific phospholipase C-ζ (PLC-ζ) to phospholipid membranes: potential role of an unstructured cluster of basic residues.J. Biol.

The XY-linker region of PLCζ is extended in length and consists of more basic residues relative to its PLCδ1 counterpart. The affinity of the XY-linker for PIP2 appears to involve a polybasic charged region that is found in a number of other membrane-associated proteins (16Nomikos M. Mulgrew-Nesbitt A. Pallavi P. Mihalyne G. Zaitseva I. Swann K. Lai F.A. Murray D. McLaughlin S. Binding of phosphoinositide-specific phospholipase C-ζ (PLC-ζ) to phospholipid membranes: potential role of an unstructured cluster of basic residues.J. Biol.

Plasma membrane phosphoinositide organization by protein electrostatics.Nature. 2005; 438: 605-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (711) Google Scholar). These positively charged amino acids in the XY-linker appear to assist the anchoring of PLCζ to membranes by enhancing the local PIP2 concentration adjacent to the XY catalytic domain via electrostatic interactions with the negatively charged PIP2 (16Nomikos M. Mulgrew-Nesbitt A. Pallavi P. Mihalyne G. Zaitseva I. Swann K. Lai F.A. Murray D. McLaughlin S. Binding of phosphoinositide-specific phospholipase C-ζ (PLC-ζ) to phospholipid membranes: potential role of an unstructured cluster of basic residues.J. Biol.

Phospholipase Cζ binding to PtdIns(4,5)P2 requires the XY-linker region.J. Cell Sci. 2011; 124: 2582-2590Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). However, the XY-linker might not be the only domain that mediates the binding of PLCζ to PIP2-containing membranes. We have demonstrated that the absence of the XY-linker from PLCζ significantly diminishes, but does not completely abolish, the in vivo Ca2+ oscillation inducing activity (19Nomikos M. Elgmati K. Theodoridou M. Georgilis A. Gonzalez-Garcia J.R. Nounesis G. Swann K. Lai F.A. Novel regulation of PLCζ activity via its XY-linker.Biochem. J. 2011; 438: 427-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). This suggests that other domain(s) may also be involved in anchoring PLCζ to its target membrane. A recent study reported that the N-terminal lobe of the EF-hand domain of PLCδ1 binds anionic phospholipids, and this binding is due to interactions with cationic and hydrophobic residues in the first EF-hand sequence of PLCδ1 (20Cai J. Guo S. Lomasney J.W. Roberts M.F. Ca2+-independent binding of anionic phospholipids by phospholipase C δ1 EF-hand domain.J. Biol. Chem. 2013; 288: 37277-37288Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The authors propose a general mechanism that may apply to other PLC isoforms by suggesting that EF-hand domain interactions with anionic phospholipids in the target membrane provides a tether that facilitates proper substrate access and binding in the active site (20Cai J. Guo S. Lomasney J.W. Roberts M.F. Ca2+-independent binding of anionic phospholipids by phospholipase C δ1 EF-hand domain.J. Biol. Chem. 2013; 288: 37277-37288Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Importantly, the cationic residues in the first EF-hand domain of PLCδ1 that contribute to anionic lipid vesicle binding are all conserved in PLCζ. The aim of this study is to investigate the potential importance of a conserved cluster of cationic residues at the N-terminal lobe of the EF-hand domain of PLCζ in association with anionic lipids and its substrate PIP2. A series of full-length mouse PLCζ mutants were prepared that sequentially neutralized two positively charged lysine and one arginine residues within the first EF-hand domain. The Ca2+ oscillation-inducing properties of these mutants were experimentally tested relative to wild-type PLCζ by microinjection of cRNA into unfertilized mouse eggs. The various PLCζ mutants' enzymatic properties were analyzed using an in vitro PIP2 hydrolysis assay. A protein-lipid overlay and a liposome binding/enzyme assay were employed to assess the binding properties of wild-type PLCζ to phosphatidylserine (PS), phosphatidic acid (PA), and PIP2. Furthermore, the binding properties of mutant EF-hand PLCζ proteins to PIP2 were examined. Our results suggest that PLCζ possesses significant affinity only for PIP2 but not for PA or PS. We also find that sequential reduction of the net positive charge within the first EF-hand domain significantly reduces both in vivo Ca2+ oscillation inducing activity and the in vitro interaction of PLCζ with PIP2. Moreover, we show that a PLCζ mutant where three cationic residues within the first EF-hand domain and three cationic residues within the XY-linker region of PLCζ were substituted by alanine is unable to trigger Ca2+ oscillations in mouse eggs. In vitro biochemical characterization suggests that this PLCζ mutant displays dramatically reduced binding to PIP2-containing liposomes compared with the wild-type PLCζ. Thus, we propose a novel mechanism for the sperm PLCζ interaction with PIP2-containing membranes mediated by electrostatic interactions between the anionic PIP2 with both the first EF-hand domain and the XY-linker region of PLCζ, which are rich in cationic residues.

PLCζEFK49A,K53A,R57A (1–149 amino acids) was amplified from the PLCζK49A,K53A,R57A-luc plasmid by PCR with primers to incorporate a 5-KpnI site and a 3-EcoRI site and then cloned into the pCR3 vector. PLCζΔEFK374A,K375A,K377A (150–647 amino acids) was then amplified from the PLCζK374A,K375A,K377A-luc plasmid (17Nomikos M. Elgmati K. Theodoridou M. Calver B.L. Nounesis G. Swann K. Lai F.A. Phospholipase Cζ binding to PtdIns(4,5)P2 requires the XY-linker region.J.

Finally, luciferase was amplified from pGL2 with primers incorporating NotI sites, and the product was cloned into the NotI site of the pCR3-PLCζK49A,K53A,R57A,K374A,K375A,K377A plasmid. All the above PLCζ mutants were amplified from their corresponding pCR3 plasmid with the appropriate primers to incorporate a 5-SalI site and a 3-NotI site, and the products were cloned into the pETMM60 vector to enable bacterial protein expression. The primers used for the amplifications were as follows: 5′-GAACGTCGACATGGAAAGCCAACTTCATGAGCTCGC-3′ (forward) and 5′-GGAAGCGGCCGCTCACTCTCTGAAGTACCAAAC-3′ (reverse). Successful mutagenesis and cloning of the above expression vector constructs were confirmed by dideoxynucleotide sequencing (Applied Biosystems Big-Dye Version 3.1 chemistry and model 3730 automated capillary DNA sequencer by DNA Sequencing & ServicesTM). Following linearization of wild-type and mutated PLCζ plasmids, cRNA was synthesized using the mMessage Machine T7 kit (Ambion) and then was polyadenylated using the poly(A) tailing kit (Ambion), as per the manufacturer's instructions. Female mice were super-ovulated and mature MII eggs were collected from excised oviducts 13.5–14.5 h after injection of human chorionic gonadotrophin and maintained in droplets of M2 media (Sigma) under mineral oil at 37 °C. Experimental recordings of Ca2+ release or luciferase expression were carried out with mouse eggs in Hepes-buffered media (H-KSOM), as described previously (22Swann K. Measuring Ca2+ oscillations in mammalian eggs.Methods Mol. Biol. 2013; 957: 231-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). All compounds were from Sigma unless stated otherwise. All procedures using animals were performed in accordance with the United Kingdom Home Office Animals Procedures Act and were approved by the Cardiff University Animals Ethics Committee. Mouse eggs were washed in M2 and microinjected with cRNA diluted in injection buffer (120 mm KCl, 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4). The volume injected was estimated from the diameter of cytoplasmic displacement caused by the bolus injection. All injections were 3–5% of the oocyte volume. Eggs were microinjected with the appropriate cRNA in the injection buffer, mixed with an equal volume of 1 mm Oregon Green 1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid-dextran (Life Technologies, Inc.). Eggs were then maintained in H-KSOM containing 100 μm luciferin and imaged on a Nikon TE2000 microscope equipped with a cooled intensified CCD camera (Photek Ltd., UK). The luminescence (luciferase expression) and fluorescence (for Ca2+ measurements) from eggs were collected by switching back and forth between the two modes on a 10-s cycle (23Campbell K. Swann K. Ca2+ oscillations stimulate an ATP increase during fertilization of mouse eggs.Dev. Biol. 2006; 298: 225-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 24Swann K. Campbell K. Yu Y. Saunders C. Lai F.A. Use of luciferase chimaera to monitor PLCζ expression in mouse eggs.Methods Mol. Biol. 2009; 518: 17-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). These two signals were then displayed as two separate signals over the same time period for each egg. The fluorescent light used to measure Ca2+ is shown in relative units. Luminescence was recorded as photon counts/s and plotted as a running average over 5 min. All live imaging experiments on eggs were made during a 1-month period. For NusA-His6-fusion protein expression, Escherichia coli (BL21-CodonPlus(DE3)-RILP; Stratagene) cells were transformed with the appropriate pETMM60 plasmid and cultured at 37 °C until the A600 reached 0.6, and protein expression was induced for 18 h at 16 °C with 0.1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (ForMedium). Cells were harvested (6000 × g for 10 min), resuspended in PBS containing a protease inhibitor mixture (EDTA-free; Roche Applied Science), and sonicated four times for 15 s on ice. Soluble NusA-His6-tagged fusion protein was purified on nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid resin following standard procedures (Qiagen) and eluted with 250 mm imidazole. Eluted proteins were dialyzed overnight (10,000 molecular weight cutoff; Pierce) at 4 °C against 4 liters of PBS and concentrated with centrifugal concentrators (Sartorius; 10,000 molecular weight cutoff). PIP2 hydrolytic activity of recombinant PLCζ proteins was assayed as described previously (17Nomikos M. Elgmati K. Theodoridou M. Calver B.L. Nounesis G. Swann K. Lai F.A.

The assay conditions were optimized for linearity, requiring a 1-min incubation of 200 pmol of PLCζ protein sample at 25 °C. In assays to determine dependence on PIP2 concentration, 0.05 μCi of [3H]PIP2 was mixed with cold PIP2 to give the appropriate final concentration. In assays examining Ca2+ sensitivity, Ca2+ buffers were prepared by EGTA/CaCl2 admixture, as described previously (17Nomikos M. Elgmati K. Theodoridou M. Calver B.L. Nounesis G. Swann K. Lai F.A.

PIP array membranes (Echelon Biosciences) were blocked for 2 h with binding buffer (TBS-T: 20 mm Tris, 137 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20, pH 7.4) containing 3% bovine serum albumin (lipid-free) and incubated with 25 pmol of each NusA-PLCζ fusion protein for 1 h at room temperature. After washing three times in TBS-T, NusA-PLCζ fusion protein interaction with the inositol phosphate lipids was detected by first incubating the PIP array membranes with penta-His monoclonal antibody (Qiagen, 1:5000 dilution in 5 ml of binding buffer) overnight at 4 °C, followed by three 15-min washes.

The film was hydrated with 2 ml of PBS, and the resultant suspension was extruded through two stacked polycarbonate filters of 100-nm pore size. Twenty five cycles of extrusion were applied at 50 °C. Dynamic light scattering was employed to determine the size of the liposomes, which used a light scattering apparatus (AXIOS-150/EX, Triton Hellas, Thessaloniki, Greece) with a 30-milliwatt laser source and an Avalanche photodiode detector set at a 90° angle. Dynamic light scattering measurements of the extruded lipid preparation showed a narrow monomodal size distribution with average liposome diameter of 100 nm and a polydispersity index of 0.20–0.25.

https://openalex.org/W2218160659,"Under normal physiologic conditions, the glutathione S-transferase P1 (GSTP1) protein exists intracellularly as a dimer in reversible equilibrium with its monomeric subunits. In the latter form, GSTP1 binds to the mitogen-activated protein kinase, JNK, and inhibits JNK downstream signaling. In tumor cells, which frequently are characterized by constitutively high GSTP1 expression, GSTP1 undergoes phosphorylation by epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) at tyrosine residues 3, 7, and 198. Here we report on the effect of this EGFR-dependent GSTP1 tyrosine phosphorylation on the interaction of GSTP1 with JNK, on the regulation of JNK downstream signaling by GSTP1, and on tumor cell survival. Using in vitro and in vivo growing human brain tumors, we show that tyrosine phosphorylation shifts the GSTP1 dimer-monomer equilibrium to the monomeric state and facilitates the formation of the GSTP1-JNK complex, in which JNK is functionally inhibited. Targeted mutagenesis and functional analysis demonstrated that the increased GSTP1 binding to JNK results from phosphorylation of the GSTP1 C-terminal Tyr-198 by EGFR and is associated with a >2.5-fold decrease in JNK downstream signaling and a significant suppression of both spontaneous and drug-induced apoptosis in the tumor cells. The findings define a novel mechanism of regulatory control of JNK signaling that is mediated by the EGFR/GSTP1 cross-talk and provides a survival advantage for tumors with activated EGFR and high GSTP1 expression. The results lay the foundation for a novel strategy of dual EGFR/GSTP1 for treating EGFR+ve, GSTP1 expressing GBMs."
https://openalex.org/W2192559826,"High levels of β-amyloid (Aβ) in the brain and carriage of the APOE ε4 allele have each been linked to cognitive impairment in cognitively normal (CN) older adults. However, the relationship between these two biomarkers and cognitive decline is unclear. The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between cerebral Aβ level, APOE ε4 carrier status, and cognitive decline over 18 months, in 317 cognitively healthy (CN) older adults (47.6% males, 52.4% females) aged between 60 and 89 years (Mean = 69.9, SD = 6.8). Cognition was assessed using the Cogstate Brief Battery (CBB) and the California Verbal Learning Test, Second Edition (CVLT-II). Planned comparisons indicated that CN older adults with high Aβ who were also APOE ε4 carriers demonstrated the most pronounced decline in learning and working memory. In CN older adults who were APOE ε4 non-carriers, high Aβ was unrelated to cognitive decline in learning and working memory. Carriage of APOE ε4 in CN older adults with low Aβ was associated with a significantly increased rate of decline in learning and unexpectedly, improved cognitive performance on measures of verbal episodic memory over 18 months. These results suggest that Aβ and APOE ε4 interact to increase the rate of cognitive decline in CN older adults and provide further support for the use of Aβ and APOE ε4 as biomarkers of early Alzheimer’s disease."
https://openalex.org/W2191062646,"Spermatogenesis is a costly process that is expected to be under selection to maximise sperm quantity and quality. Testis size is often regarded as a proxy measure of sperm investment, implicitly overlooking the quantitative assessment of spermatogenesis. An enhanced understanding of testicular function, beyond testis size, may reveal further sexual traits involved in sperm quantity and quality. Here, we first estimated the inter-male variation in testicular function and sperm traits in red deer across the breeding and non-breeding seasons. Then, we analysed the relationships between the testis mass, eight parameters of spermatogenic function, and seven parameters of sperm quality. Our findings revealed that the Sertoli cell number and function parameters vary greatly between red deer males, and that spermatogenic activity co-varies with testis mass and sperm quality across the breeding and non-breeding seasons. For the first time in a seasonal breeder, we found that not only is the Sertoli cell number important in determining testis mass (r = 0.619, p = 0.007 and r = 0.248, p = 0.047 for the Sertoli cell number assessed by histology and cytology, respectively), but also sperm function (r = 0.703, p = 0.002 and r = 0.328, p = 0.012 for the Sertoli cell number assessed by histology and cytology, respectively). Testicular histology also revealed that a high Sertoli cell number per tubular cross-section is associated with high sperm production (r = 0.600, p = 0.009). Sperm production and function were also positively correlated (r = 0.384, p = 0.004), suggesting that these traits co-vary to maximise sperm fertilisation ability in red deer. In conclusion, our findings contribute to the understanding of the dynamics of spermatogenesis, and reveal new insights into the role of testicular function and the Sertoli cell number on testis size and sperm quality in red deer."
https://openalex.org/W2194144202,"Background Public hospitals deliver over ninety percent of all outpatient and inpatient services in China. Their quality is graded into three levels (A, B, and C) largely based on structural resources, but empirical evidence on the quality of process and outcome of care is extremely scarce. As expectations for quality care rise with higher living standards and cost of care, such evidence is urgently needed and vital to improve care and to inform future health reforms. Methods We compiled and analyzed a multicenter database of over 4 million inpatient discharge summary records to provide a comprehensive assessment of the level and variations in clinical outcomes of hospitalization at 39 tertiary hospitals in Beijing. We assessed six outcome measures of clinical quality: in-hospital mortality rates (RSMR) for AMI, stroke, pneumonia and CABG, post-procedural complication rate (RS-CR), and failure-to-rescue rate (RS-FTR). The measures were adjusted for pre-admission patient case-mix using indirect standardization method with hierarchical linear mixed models. Results We found good overall quality with large variations by hospital and condition (mean/range, in %): RSMR-AMI: 6.23 (2.37–14.48), RSMR-stroke: 4.18 (3.58–4.44), RSMR-pneumonia: 7.78 (7.20–8.59), RSMR-CABG: 1.93 (1.55–2.23), RS-CR: 11.38 (9.9–12.88), and RS-FTR: 6.41 (5.17–7.58). Hospital grade was not significantly associated with any risk-adjusted outcome measures. Conclusions Going to a higher grade public hospital does not always lead to better patient outcome because hospital grade only contains information about hospital structural resources. A hospital report card with some outcome measures of quality would provide valuable information to patients in choosing providers, and for regulators to identify gaps in health care quality. Reducing the variations in clinical practice and patient outcome should be a focus for policy makers in the next round of health sector reforms in China."
https://openalex.org/W1842086205,"Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI) has been prevalent in Indonesia since 2003 causing major losses to poultry production and human deaths. Live bird markets are considered high risk areas due to the density of large numbers of mixed poultry species of unknown disease status. Understanding trader knowledge and perceptions of HPAI and biosecurity is critical to reducing transmission risk and controlling the disease. An interview-administered survey was conducted at 17 live bird markets on the islands of Bali and Lombok in 2008 and 2009. A total of 413 live poultry traders were interviewed. Respondents were mostly male (89%) with a mean age of 45 years (range: 19–81). The main source of AI information was TV (78%), although personal communication was also identified to be an important source, particularly among female traders (60%) and respondents from Bali (43%). More than half (58%) of live poultry traders interviewed knew that infected birds can transmit HPAI viruses but were generally unaware that viruses can be introduced to markets by fomites. Cleaning cages and disposing of sick and dead birds were recognized as the most important steps to prevent the spread of disease by respondents. Two thirds (n = 277) of respondents were unwilling to report sudden or suspicious bird deaths to authorities. Bali vendors perceive biosecurity to be of higher importance than Lombok vendors and are more willing to improve biosecurity within markets than traders in Lombok. Collectors and traders selling large numbers (>214) of poultry, or selling both chickens and ducks, have better knowledge of HPAI transmission and prevention than vendors or traders selling smaller quantities or only one species of poultry. Education was strongly associated with better knowledge but did not influence positive reporting behavior. Our study reveals that most live poultry traders have limited knowledge of HPAI transmission and prevention and are generally reluctant to report bird deaths. Greater efforts are needed to engage local government, market managers and traders in education and awareness programs, regulatory measures and incentive mechanisms. Understanding and evaluating the social responses to such an integrated approach could lead to more effective HPAI prevention and control."
https://openalex.org/W2278057975,"Phospholemman (FXYD1) is a single-transmembrane protein regulator of Na,K-ATPase, expressed strongly in heart, skeletal muscle, and brain and phosphorylated by protein kinases A and C at Ser-68 and Ser-63, respectively. Binding of FXYD1 reduces Na,K-ATPase activity, and phosphorylation at Ser-68 or Ser-63 relieves the inhibition. Despite the accumulated information on physiological effects, whole cell studies provide only limited information on molecular mechanisms. As a complementary approach, we utilized purified human Na,K-ATPase (α1β1 and α2β1) reconstituted with FXYD1 or mutants S63E, S68E, and S63E,S68E that mimic phosphorylation at Ser-63 and Ser-68. Compared with control α1β1, FXYD1 reduces Vmax and turnover rate and raises K0.5Na. The phosphomimetic mutants reverse these effects and reduce K0.5Na below control K0.5Na. Effects on α2β1 are similar but smaller. Experiments in proteoliposomes reconstituted with α1β1 show analogous effects of FXYD1 on K0.5Na, which are abolished by phosphomimetic mutants and also by increasing mole fractions of DOPS in the proteoliposomes. Stopped-flow experiments using the dye RH421 show that FXYD1 slows the conformational transition E2(2K)ATP → E1(3Na)ATP but does not affect 3NaE1P → E2P3Na. This regulatory effect is explained simply by molecular modeling, which indicates that a cytoplasmic helix (residues 60–70) docks between the αN and αP domains in the E2 conformation, but docking is weaker in E1 (also for phosphomimetic mutants). Taken together with previous work showing that FXYD1 also raises binding affinity for the Na+-selective site III, these results provide a rather comprehensive picture of the regulatory mechanism of FXYD1 that complements the physiological studies.

Animal cells need an inwardly directed Na+ concentration gradient and an outwardly directed gradient for K+ ions in order to maintain viability. Numerous cellular functions depend on the presence of these electrochemical potential gradients; therefore, a strict regulation is required. The K+ gradient preferentially controls the electric membrane potential, and the Na+ gradient is required to fuel a variety of coupled transporters, such as the uptake of sugars, amino acids, or phosphate and the extrusion of Ca2+ at the expense of a Na+ influx into the cells. The primary actor maintaining the cation gradients is the Na,K-ATPase. Because the demand for the ion pump capacity differs widely between various types of cells, four α and three β isoforms are expressed and assembled as complexes at appropriately adapted densities in the various cell membranes (1.Blanco G. Mercer R.W. Isozymes of the Na-K-ATPase: heterogeneity in structure, diversity in function.Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: F633-F650PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, in specific tissues, such as excitable cells or kidney, the Na+ extrusion and K+ uptake capacity must be modulated acutely. For this purpose, a third, regulatory subunit, has evolved, and these subunits are referred to as the FXYD family (2.Cornelius F. Mahmmoud Y.A. Functional modulation of the sodium pump: the regulatory proteins “Fixit”.News Physiol. Sci. 2003; 18: 119-124PubMed Google Scholar, 3.Garty H. Karlish S.J.

Renal Physiol. 2006; 290: F241-F250Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). FXYD proteins are a group of seven short, single-transmembrane proteins named after the invariant extracellular motif FXYD (5.Sweadner K.J. Rael E. The FXYD gene family of small ion transport regulators or channels: cDNA sequence, protein signature sequence, and expression.Genomics. 2000; 68: 41-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). The molecular mechanism of the regulatory effects of these FXYD proteins is still under investigation. Many years before its function was revealed, FXYD1 (known also as phopholemman) was identified as the major substrate for PKA and PKC in the heart (6.Palmer C.J. Scott B.T. Jones L.R.

Donnet C. Wetzel R.K. Asinovski N.K. Jones L.R. Sweadner K.J. Phospholemman, a single-span membrane protein, is an accessory protein of Na,K-ATPase in cerebellum and choroid plexus.J.

Anat. 2010; 192: 7-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). According to NMR-spectroscopic investigations of purified FXYD1 in SDS-detergent micelles, the molecule is organized into four α-helices. H1 (Asp-12 to Gln-17) is located at the extracellular side; H2 (Ile-19 to Leu-36) forms the transmembrane domain; and the cytoplasmic domain contains two helices, H3 (Ser-37 to Lys-43) and H4 (Thr-59 to Ser-68) (10.Teriete P. Franzin C.M. Choi J. Marassi F.M. Structure of the Na,K-ATPase regulatory protein FXYD1 in micelles.Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 6774-6783Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Whereas helices H1, H2, and H3 are rigidly connected, H4 is linked to the others by a long and highly flexible loop. The high mobility of the C-terminal domain of all FXYD proteins, which contains H4 in FXYD1, is reflected in the fact that it is not resolved in any of the x-ray structures of crystallized Na,K-ATPase complexes containing FXYD2 and FXYD10, respectively (11.Morth J.P. Pedersen B.P. Toustrup-Jensen M.S. Sørensen T.L. Petersen J. Andersen J.P. Vilsen B. Nissen P.

Crystal structure of the sodium-potassium pump at 2.4 Å resolution.Nature. 2009; 459: 446-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar). In order to modulate the Na,K-ATPase activity in the short term, cells must be able to rapidly switch the regulatory function on and off. This switching function is largely attributable to the phosphorylation of FXYD1 by PKA and PKC. It has been found that this process occurs in vivo at residues Ser-63, Ser-68, and Thr-69, which are located in helix H4 (6.Palmer C.J. Scott B.T. Jones L.R.

For reconstitution with the Na,K-ATPase, FXYD1 was dialyzed against 500 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 0.1 mm DTT, and 25 mm MOPS, pH 7.4, and the His tag was removed by AcTev-protease as described (23.Mishra N.K.

The cleaved FXYD1 was then added to the solubilized yeast membranes with the Na,K-ATPase bound to BD-Talon beads at a molar ratio of 10:1 (FXYD1/Na,K-ATPase) and incubated overnight. After washing off the excess FXYD1, the αβFXYD1 complex was eluted as usual. Enzyme activity was measured using the PiColor Lock malachite green assay (Innova Biosciences) detecting free phosphate from ATP hydrolysis in a medium containing 130 mm NaCl, 20 mm KCl, 3 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 25 mm histidine, pH 7.4, and 1 mm ATP at 37 °C. For ion titrations, activity was measured at varying concentrations of Na+ plus choline chloride and KCl (80 mm) with constant total ionic strength (170 mm total). Data were fitted using KaleidaGraph (Synergy Software). Na+ ion titrations were fitted using the Hill equation. V ( [ Na + ] ) = V max ⋅ [ Na + ] n H ( K 0.5 Na ) n H + [ Na + ] n H (Eq. 1) Phosphoenzyme was determined as described previously (29.Haviv H. Habeck M. Kanai R. Toyoshima C. Karlish S.J.

Proteoliposomes were prepared with lipid mixtures of synthesized lipids. The composition of 34 mol % DPPC and 10 mol % cholesterol was kept constant, whereas DOPS was varied between 0 and 30 mol %, and DOPE was varied between 56 and 26 mol % to complement all compounds to 100 mol %. Due to the lower solubility of such lipid mixtures in DDM only, a solution of 1% DDM and 1% C12E8 in Buffer H (25 mm imidazole, 1 mm EDTA, 5 mm MgSO4, 5 mm Na2SO4, 70 mm K2SO4, pH 7.2) was chosen to solubilize the lipids. Proteoliposome formation containing recombinant α1His10-β1FXYD1 complexes was performed as described previously (24.Cirri E. Kirchner C. Becker S. Katz A. Karlish S.J. Apell H.J. Surface charges of the membrane crucially affect regulation of Na,K-ATPase by phospholemman (FXYD1).J. Membr. Biol. 2013; 246: 967-979Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). In short, to obtain a lipid concentration of 8 mg/ml, the desired lipid mixture was dissolved in Buffer H with 2% DDM. Sulfate was chosen as primary anion because it produces a significantly lower leak current than chloride (26.Apell H.J. Bersch B. Oxonol VI as an optical indicator for membrane potentials in lipid vesicles.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 903: 480-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). The purified recombinant enzyme complexes were diluted with Buffer H to obtain a protein concentration of 0.1 mg/ml and mixed with the lipid/DDM mixture at a ratio of 1:1 (v/v). Bio beads (1 mg of beads per 2 μl of lipid/DDM mixture) were added, and the mixture was incubated overnight at 6 °C under continuous stirring. The solution containing the vesicles was separated from the sedimented beads using capillary tips and stored at 0 °C. After a minimum of 3 h on ice, tight vesicles were ready for further use. Besides recombinant α1His10-β1 complexes with FXYD1 as control, preparations were assembled with enzyme complexes containing phosphorylated FXYD1-P (at Ser-68) or the S63E, S68E, and S63E,S68E mutants. The negatively charged fluorescent dye oxonol VI has been introduced previously as an indicator of inside-positive membrane potentials in vesicles (26.Apell H.J. Bersch B. Oxonol VI as an optical indicator for membrane potentials in lipid vesicles.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 903: 480-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar), and it has been shown to detect successfully the electrogenic pump activity of the α1His10-β1 reconstituted in proteoliposomes. Experiments were performed corresponding to a recent study from this laboratory (24.Cirri E. Kirchner C. Becker S. Katz A. Karlish S.J. Apell H.J. Surface charges of the membrane crucially affect regulation of Na,K-ATPase by phospholemman (FXYD1).J. Membr. Biol. 2013; 246: 967-979Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). In short, 1 ml of buffer solutions containing 25 mm imidazole, 1 mm EDTA, 2.5 mm MgSO4, and various concentrations of Na2SO4, pH 7.2, were thermally equilibrated in a cuvette equipped with a magnetic stirrer. Afterward, 25 nm oxonol VI and a volume of proteoliposomes corresponding to 80 μg/ml lipid were added. When a steady-state fluorescence level was obtained, 2.5 mm MgATP was added to trigger pump activity. The pump activity is reflected in a fluorescence increase that exponentially approaches a steady-state level at which the pump current is compensated by the leak current due to the membrane conductance. The experiments were carried out in a PerkinElmer Life Sciences LS 50B luminescence spectrometer. The excitation wavelength was set to 580 nm (slit width 15 nm), and the emission wavelength was set to 660 nm (slit width 15 nm). Measurements were performed at 20 °C. To allow a comparison between different experiments, the fluorescence changes were normalized with respect to the fluorescence level at membrane voltage 0 (F0) before the addition of ATP.

As a direct substrate of Cyclin E/CDK2, nuclear protein ataxia-telangiectasia (NPAT) is a crucial factor in regulating histone transcription and cell cycle progression. Here we identified that Cpn10/HSPE, a 10-kDa heat shock protein, is a novel interacting partner of NPAT. A pool of Cpn10 is colocalized with NPAT foci during G1 and S phases in nuclei. Gain- and loss-of-function experiments unraveled an essential role of Cpn10 in histone transcription. A conserved DLFD motif within Cpn10 was critical for targeting NPAT and modulating histone transcription. More importantly, knockdown of Cpn10 disrupted the focus formation of both NPAT and FADD-like interleukin-1β-converting enzyme-associated huge protein without affecting Coilin-positive Cajal bodies. Finally, Cpn10 is important for S phase progression and cell proliferation. Taken together, our finding revealed a novel role of Cpn10 in the spatial regulation of NPAT signaling and disclosed a previously unappreciated link between the heat shock protein and histone transcription regulation."
https://openalex.org/W2109796430,"The dengue virus (DENV) envelope protein domain III (ED3) has been suggested to contain receptor recognition sites and the critical neutralizing epitopes. Up to date, relatively little work has been done on fine mapping of neutralizing epitopes on ED3 for DENV4. In this study, a novel mouse type-specific neutralizing antibody 1G6 against DENV4 was obtained with both prophylactic and therapeutic effects. The epitope was mapped to residues 387–390 of DENV4 envelope protein. Furthermore, site-directed mutagenesis assay identified two critical residues (T388 and H390). The epitope is variable among different DENV serotypes but is highly conserved among four DENV4 genotypes. Affinity measurement showed that naturally occurring variations in ED3 outside the epitope region did not alter the binding of mAb 1G6. These findings expand our understanding of the interactions between neutralizing antibodies and the DENV4 and may be valuable for rational design of DENV vaccines and antiviral drugs."

https://openalex.org/W2266567022,"ADA3 (alteration/deficiency in activation 3) is a conserved component of several transcriptional co-activator and histone acetyltransferase (HAT) complexes. Recently, we generated Ada3 knock-out mice and demonstrated that deletion of Ada3 leads to early embryonic lethality. The use of Ada3(FL/FL) mouse embryonic fibroblasts with deletion of Ada3 using adenovirus Cre showed a critical role of ADA3 in cell cycle progression through mitosis. Here, we demonstrate an association of ADA3 with the higher order repeat region of the α-satellite region on human X chromosome centromeres that is consistent with its role in mitosis. Given the role of centromere proteins (CENPs) in mitosis, we next analyzed whether ADA3 associates with the centromere through CENPs. Both an in vivo proximity ligation assay and immunofluorescence studies confirmed the association of ADA3 with CENP-B protein, a highly conserved centromeric protein that binds to the 17-bp DNA sequences on α-satellite DNA. Deletional analysis showed that ADA3 directly associates with CENP-B through its N terminus, and a CENP-B binding-deficient mutant of ADA3 was incompetent in cell proliferation rescue. Notably, knockdown of ADA3 decreased binding of CENP-B onto the centromeres, suggesting that ADA3 is required for the loading of CENP-B onto the centromeres. Finally, we show that deletion of Ada3 from Ada3(FL/FL) mouse embryonic fibroblasts exhibited various chromosome segregation defects. Taken together, we demonstrate a novel ADA3 interaction with CENP-B-centromere that may account for its previously known function in mitosis. This study, together with its known function in maintaining genomic stability and its mislocalization in cancers, suggests an important role of ADA3 in mitosis."
https://openalex.org/W2173421769,"Our previous studies demonstrated that remote electro-stimulation (RES) increased myocardial GSK3 phosphorylation and attenuated ischemia/ reperfusion (I/R) injury in rat hearts. However, the role of various opioid receptors (OR) subtypes in preconditioned RES-induced myocardial protection remains unknown. We investigated the role of OR subtype signaling in RES-induced cardioprotection against I/R injury of the rat heart.Male Spraque-Dawley rats were used. RES was performed on median nerves area with/without pretreatment with various receptors antagonists such as opioid receptor (OR) subtype receptors (KOR, DOR, and MOR). The expressions of Akt, GSK3, and PKCε expression were analyzed by Western blotting. When RES was preconditioned before the I/R model, the rat's hemodynamic index, infarction size, mortality and serum CK-MB were evaluated. Our results showed that Akt, GSK3 and PKCε expression levels were significantly increased in the RES group compared to the sham group, which were blocked by pretreatment with specific antagonists targeting KOR and DOR, but not MOR subtype. Using the I/R model, the duration of arrhythmia and infarct size were both significantly attenuated in RES group. The mortality rates of the sham RES group, the RES group, RES group + KOR antagonist, RES group + DOR/MOR antagonists (KOR left), RES group + DOR antagonist, and RES group + KOR/MOR antagonists (DOR left) were 50%, 20%, 67%, 13%, 50% and 55%, respectively.The mechanism of RES-induced myocardial protection against I/R injury seems to involve multiple target pathways such as Akt, KOR and/or DOR signaling."
https://openalex.org/W2173088174,"The empirical mode decomposition is applied to analyze the intrinsic multi-scale dynamic behaviors of complex financial systems. In this approach, the time series of the price returns of each stock is decomposed into a small number of intrinsic mode functions, which represent the price motion from high frequency to low frequency. These intrinsic mode functions are then grouped into three modes, i.e., the fast mode, medium mode and slow mode. The probability distribution of returns and auto-correlation of volatilities for the fast and medium modes exhibit similar behaviors as those of the full time series, i.e., these characteristics are rather robust in multi time scale. However, the cross-correlation between individual stocks and the return-volatility correlation are time scale dependent. The structure of business sectors is mainly governed by the fast mode when returns are sampled at a couple of days, while by the medium mode when returns are sampled at dozens of days. More importantly, the leverage and anti-leverage effects are dominated by the medium mode."
https://openalex.org/W2240607464,"We recently characterized an autocrine renin angiotensin system (RAS) in canine heart. Activation of Angiotensin II Type 1 Receptors (AT1Rs) induced electrical remodeling, including inhibition of the transient outward potassium current Ito, prolongation of the action potential (AP), increased calcium entry and increased contractility. Electrical properties of the mouse heart are very different from those of dog heart, but if a similar system existed in mouse, it could be uniquely studied through genetic manipulations. To investigate the presence of a RAS in mouse, we measured APs and Ito in isolated myocytes. Application of angiotensin II (A2) for 2 or more hours reduced Ito magnitude, without affecting voltage dependence, and prolonged APs in a dose-dependent manner. Based on dose-inhibition curves, the fast and slow components of Ito (Ito,fast and IK,slow) appeared to be coherently regulated by [A2], with 50% inhibition at an A2 concentration of about 400 nM. This very high K0.5 is inconsistent with systemic A2 effects, but is consistent with an autocrine RAS in mouse heart. Pre-application of the microtubule destabilizing agent colchicine eliminated A2 effects on Ito and AP duration, suggesting these effects depend on intracellular trafficking. Application of the biased agonist SII ([Sar1-Ile4-Ile8]A2), which stimulates receptor internalization without G protein activation, caused Ito reduction and AP prolongation similar to A2-induced changes. These data demonstrate AT1R mediated regulation of Ito in mouse heart. Moreover, all measured properties parallel those measured in dog heart, suggesting an autocrine RAS may be a fundamental feedback system that is present across species."

We aimed to determine whether low-frequency rTMS induced lasting suppression of tinnitus by decreasing neural activity in the cortex, navigated by high-density electroencephalogram (EEG) source analysis, and the utility of EEG for targeting treatment.In this controlled three-armed trial, seven normal hearing patients with tonal tinnitus received a 10-day course of 1-Hz rTMS to the cortex, navigated by high-density EEG source analysis, to the left temporoparietal cortex region, and to the left temporoparietal with sham stimulation. The Tinnitus handicap inventory (THI) and a visual analog scale (VAS) were used to assess tinnitus severity and loudness. Measurements were taken before, and immediately, 2 weeks, and 4 weeks after the end of the interventions.Low-frequency rTMS decreased tinnitus significantly after active, but not sham, treatment. Responders in the EEG source analysis-based rTMS group, 71.4% (5/7) patients, experienced a significant reduction in tinnitus loudness, as evidenced by VAS scores. The target site of neuronal generators most consistently associated with a positive response was the frontal lobe in the right hemisphere, sourced using high-density EEG equipment, in the tinnitus patients. After left temporoparietal rTMS stimulation, 42.8% (3/7) patients experienced a decrease in tinnitus loudness.Active EEG source analysis based rTMS resulted in significant suppression in tinnitus loudness, showing the superiority of neuronavigation-guided coil positioning in dealing with tinnitus. Non-auditory areas should be considered in the pathophysiology of tinnitus. This knowledge in turn can contribute to investigate the pathophysiology of tinnitus."

We had previously demonstrated that a Chinese 2-herb formula (NF3) significantly stimulated angiogenesis of HUVEC in wound healing. However, the molecular mechanism has not yet been elucidated. In line with this, global expression profiling of NF3-treated HUVEC was performed so as to assess the regulatory role of NF3 involved in the underlying signaling pathways in wound healing angiogenesis. The microarray results illustrated that different panels of differentially expressed genes were strictly governed in NF3-treated HUVEC in a time-regulated manner. The microarray analysis followed by qRT-PCR and western blotting verification of NF3-treated HUVEC at 6 h revealed the involvement of various genes in diverse biological process, e.g., MAP3K14 in anti-inflammation; SLC5A8 in anti-tumorogenesis; DNAJB7 in protein translation; BIRC5, EPCAM, INSL4, MMP8 and NPR3 in cell proliferation; CXCR7, EPCAM, HAND1 and MMP8 in migration; CXCR7, EPCAM and MMP8 in tubular formation; and BIRC5, CXCR7, EPCAM, HAND1, MMP8 and UBD in angiogenesis. After 16 h incubation of NF3, other sets of genes were shown with differential expression in HUVEC, e.g., IL1RAPL2 and NR1H4 in anti-inflammation; miR28 in anti-tumorogenesis; GRIN1 and LCN1 in anti-oxidation; EPB41 in intracellular signal transduction; PRL and TFAP2A in cell proliferation; miR28, PRL and SCG2 in cell migration; PRL in tubular formation; and miR28, NR1H4 and PRL in angiogenesis.
