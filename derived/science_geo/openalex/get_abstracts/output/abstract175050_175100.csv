SurvivingOat3−/− animals appear healthy, are fertile, and do not exhibit any gross morphological tissue abnormalities. NoOat3 mRNA expression was detected in kidney, liver, or choroid plexus (CP) of Oat3−/− mice. A distinct phenotype manifested by a substantial loss of organic anion transport capacity in kidney and CP was identified. Uptake sensitive to inhibition by bromosulfophthalein or probenecid was observed for taurocholate, estrone sulfate, and para-aminohippurate in renal slices from wild-type mice, whereas inOat3−/− animals transport of these substances was greatly reduced. No discernable differences in uptake were observed between hepatic slices from wild-type andOat3−/− littermates, suggesting Oat3 does not play a major role in hepatic organic anion uptake. Cellular accumulation of fluorescein was reduced by ∼75% in CP fromOat3−/− mice. However, capillary accumulation of fluorescein-methotrexate was unchanged, indicating the effects of Oat3 loss are restricted to the entry step and that Oat3 is localized to the apical membrane of CP. These data indicate a key role for Oat3 in systemic detoxification and in control of the organic anion distribution in cerebrospinal fluid."

Most do not respond to secondary hormonal therapies, including AR antagonists, and the mechanisms of AR activation in these clinically androgen-independent tumors are unclear. Bicalutamide, the most widely used AR antagonist, is a competitive antagonist shown previously to stabilize AR association with cytosolic heat shock protein complexes. This study found nuclear AR expression in bicalutamide-treated androgen-independent PCa and found that bicalutamide could stimulate AR nuclear translocation. Moreover, specific DNA binding by the bicalutamide-liganded AR was demonstratedin vivo using a VP16-AR fusion protein and was confirmed by chromatin immunoprecipitation showing binding to the prostate-specific antigen enhancer in LNCaP PCa cells. Nonetheless, bicalutamide could not stimulate interactions between the AR N and C termini or recruitment of steroid receptor coactivator proteins (SRC-1 or -2), although SRC transfection augmented AR activity in the presence of dihydrotestosterone and inhibitory concentrations of bicalutamide. These results demonstrate that bicalutamide stimulates the assembly of a transcriptionally inactive AR on DNA and support altered coactivator (or corepressor) expression as a mechanism of bicalutamide-resistant androgen-independent PCa.

N. Engl. J. Med. 1994; 331: 996-1004Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). The effects of androgens on the normal prostate and PCa are mediated by binding to the androgen receptor (AR), a steroid hormone receptor member of the larger nuclear receptor superfamily (2Quigley C.A., De Bellis A. Marschke K.B. el Awady M.K. Wilson E.M. French F.S. Endocr. Rev. 1995; 16: 271-321Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Unfortunately, patients receiving androgen deprivation therapies invariably relapse with PCa that tends to be aggressive. In some cases, these relapsed tumors respond to secondary hormonal therapy or chemotherapy, but these responses are generally partial and transient, and no current therapies have been shown to prolong survival at this stage. Therefore, these prostate cancers that relapse after androgen deprivation therapy have been termed hormone refractory or androgen-independent and represent a major clinical challenge in PCa (3Bubley G.J. Balk S.P. Hematol. Oncol. Clin. North Am. 1996; 10: 713-725Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 4Jenster G. Semin.

Although these relapsed cancers are clinically androgen-independent, many lines of evidence indicate that the AR remains active and may contribute to their androgen-independent growth. Immunohistochemical data show that the AR is highly expressed by most androgen-independent PCa (6van der Kwast T.H. Schalken J. Ruizeveld de Winter J.A. van Vroonhoven C.C. Mulder E. Boersma W. Trapman J. Int. J. Cancer. 1991; 48: 189-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar, 7Hobisch A. Culig Z. Radmayr C. Bartsch G. Klocker H. Hittmair A. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 3068-3072PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, the AR appears to be transcriptionally active as most androgen-independent tumors express AR-regulated genes such as prostate-specific antigen (PSA). Consistent with these observations, AR mRNA appears to be increased in androgen-independent PCa, and the AR gene is amplified in ∼30% of cases (8Taplin M.E. Bubley G.J. Shuster T.D. Frantz M.E. Spooner A.E. Ogata G.K. Keer H.N. Balk S.P. N. Engl. J. Med. 1995; 332: 1393-1398Crossref PubMed Scopus (1040) Google Scholar, 9Visakorpi T. Hyytinen E. Koivisto P. Tanner M. Keinanen R. Palmberg C. Palotie A. Tammela T. Isola J. Kallioniemi O.P. Nat. Genet. 1995; 9: 401-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (1241) Google Scholar). These findings have suggested that AR expression is increased in response to androgen deprivation therapy to enhance activation by residual androgens, in particular weak adrenal-derived androgens that can be converted to testosterone and dihydrotestosterone (DHT). Consistent with this hypothesis, some androgen-independent PCa patients respond to secondary hormonal agents that antagonize adrenal hormone production or to AR antagonists that directly block androgen binding to the AR (10Scher H.I.

However, these responses to further AR blockade in androgen-independent PCa occur in a minority of patients and are generally transient. An alternative mechanism proposed to explain AR activity in androgen-independent PCa is AR mutations that result in constitutive activity or enhanced responses to other hormones. Several groups have found such mutant ARs with altered ligand responses, but their frequency in patients treated with androgen ablation monotherapy appears to be low (8Taplin M.E. Bubley G.J. Shuster T.D. Frantz M.E. Spooner A.E. Ogata G.K. Keer H.N. Balk S.P. N. Engl. J. Med. 1995; 332: 1393-1398Crossref PubMed Scopus (1040) Google Scholar, 12Culig Z. Hobisch A. Cronauer M.V. Cato A.C.

Med. 2000; 6: 703-706Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar). In contrast, AR mutations were found in ∼40% of patients who relapsed after initial combined therapy with the AR antagonist flutamide (15Taplin M.E. Bubley G.J., Ko, Y.J. Small E.J. Upton M. Rajeshkumar B. Balk S.P. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 2511-2515PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, these mutations resulted in mutant ARs that were strongly activated by flutamide and other steroid hormones, indicating selective pressure to maintain AR activity. This flutamide-treated patient population also had an increased response rate to secondary hormonal therapy with bicalutamide, an AR antagonist that remains effective against identified AR mutants (11Joyce R. Fenton M.A. Rode P. Constantine M. Gaynes L. Kolvenbag G. DeWolf W. Balk S. Taplin M.E. Bubley G.J. J. Urol. 1998; 159: 149-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). However, responses were generally partial and transient, further indicating a limited overall role for AR mutations as a mechanism for AR activity in androgen-independent PCa. Based on these observations, mechanisms proposed to account for AR activity in androgen-independent PCa should be consistent with and account for resistance to AR antagonists. The most widely used AR antagonists have been the steroidal drug cyproterone acetate and the nonsteroidal drugs flutamide and bicalutamide, which are all competitive antagonists of androgen binding (16Reid P. Kantoff P. Oh W. Investig. New Drugs. 1999; 17: 271-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Cyproterone acetate has significant AR agonist activity, whereas weak agonist activity has been shown for hydroxyflutamide, the active metabolite of flutamide (17Wong C. Kelce W.R. Sar M. Wilson E.M.

Trapman J. Brinkmann A.O. Mulder E. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1992; 41: 665-669Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). The unliganded AR associates with a heat shock protein 90 (HSP90) chaperone complex that facilitates ligand binding with subsequent conformational changes resulting in AR homodimerization, nuclear translocation, DNA binding, and transcriptional activation (20Brinkmann A.O. Blok L.J. de Ruiter P.E. Doesburg P. Steketee K. Berrevoets C.A. Trapman J. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1999; 69: 307-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). Previous studies in cell lines have indicated that the bicalutamide-liganded AR remains cytoplasmic- and HSP90-associated, which is not consistent with transcriptional activity (21Veldscholte J. Berrevoets C.A. Brinkmann A.O. Grootegoed J.A. Mulder E. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 2393-2399Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). This study further examined the effects of bicalutamide on the AR to identify mechanisms that may contribute to androgen-independent and bicalutamide-resistant AR activity in androgen-independent PCa. A human AR expression vector, pSVARo, was from A. Brinkmann (22Brinkmann A.O. Faber P.W. van Rooij H.C. Kuiper G.G. Ris C. Klaassen P. van der Korput J.A. Voorhorst M.M. van Laar J.H. Mulder E. J. Steroid Biochem. 1989; 34: 307-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). pRL-CMV, pG5-Luc, pBind, and pACT vectors were from Promega (Madison, WI). VP16 activation domain-AR expression vectors were generated in pACT containing the full-length AR (pACT-hAR) or the N-terminal AR (amino acids 1–505, pACT-ARN) (23Lu M.L. Schneider M.C. Zheng Y. Zhang X. Richie J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 13442-13451Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). The Gal4 DNA binding domain was fused to the AR ligand binding domain (amino acids 661–919) to generate pBind-ARLBD. The ARE4-Luc reporter contained four tandem androgen-responsive elements cloned into pGL3 (23Lu M.L. Schneider M.C. Zheng Y. Zhang X. Richie J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 13442-13451Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). Expression vectors for human SRC1 (pSG5-SRC1) and murine GRIP1 (pCMV-GRIP1) were from M. Brown (Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA) (24Onate S.A. Tsai S.Y. Tsai M.J. O'Malley B.W. Science. 1995; 270: 1354-1357Crossref PubMed Scopus (2058) Google Scholar, 25Hong H. Kohli K.

Bone marrow biopsies from patients with androgen-independent PCa being treated with bicalutamide were obtained as described (15Taplin M.E. Bubley G.J., Ko, Y.J. Small E.J. Upton M. Rajeshkumar B. Balk S.P. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 2511-2515PubMed Google Scholar) and were immunostained using a rabbit anti-AR N-terminal antibody (PG-21, Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY). Mouse prostates were harvested and immunostained with the same antibody, as described (26Stanbrough M. Leav I. Kwan P.W. Bubley G.J. Balk S.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 10823-10828Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). LNCaP cells were grown on coverslips in RPMI 1640 with 10% charcoal-dextran-stripped FCS (CS-FCS, Hyclone, Logan UT), which is steroid hormone-depleted. Cells were then treated with DHT (Sigma) or bicalutamide (provided by Astra-Zeneca, Wilmington, DE) as indicated, fixed in PBS/4% paraformaldehyde, and stained with the AR antibody and a secondary goat anti-mouse fluorescein isothiocyanate conjugate. CV1 cells were cultured in 24-well plates in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% FCS to ∼90% confluence. Cells were transfected by mixing the indicated amounts of plasmid DNA with 1.5 μl of LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen) in a final volume of 100 μl of Opti-MEM for 25 min at room temperature, which was then mixed with 0.5 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% CS-FCS and added to the cell culture wells. After 24 h, the culture medium was replaced with 0.2 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/10% CS-FCS with or without DHT or bicalutamide as indicated. After another 24 h, the cells were assayed for firefly and Renillaluciferase activities using the Dual-Luciferase reporter assay system (Promega). The results were normalized for the internalRenilla control and expressed as the mean relative light units plus standard deviation from triplicate or quadruplicate samples. The LNCaP PCa cell line was cultured in RPMI 1640/10% FCS until 70–80% confluent in 10-cm plates. They were then transferred to RPMI-160/10% CS-FCS for 24 h and treated with the indicated amount of DHT or bicalutamide for another 24 h. Cells were recovered by trypsin, washed, and resuspended in 0.5 ml of PBS/5 mm EDTA, and 0.7 ml of 95% ethanol was then added. On the day of analysis, RNase (2.5 μl at 10 mg/ml) was added for 30 min followed by 5 μl of an 0.5 mg/ml solution of propidium iodide. LNCaP cells grown to ∼80% confluence in 10-cm plates were switched to steroid hormone-depleted medium (RPMI 1640/10% CS-FCS) for 48 h and then exposed to 10 nm DHT or 100 μm bicalutamide for varying times. Plates were then rinsed with PBS and fixed for 10 min at room temperature with 1% formaldehyde in PBS. After rinsing twice with ice-cold PBS, cross-linking was terminated by scraping cells into 1 ml of 100 mm Tris, pH 9.4, and 10 mmdithiothreitol and incubating at 30 °C for 15 min. Cell pellets were then washed twice with PBS and resuspended in 0.3 ml of lysis buffer (1% SDS, 10 mm EDTA, 50 mm Tris, pH 8.1, and protease inhibitors). Chromatin was sheared to 300–1000 bp with three sequential 10-s pulses at 70% power with a microtip ultrasonic cell dismembrator (Fisher). Cell debris was pelleted at 10,000 ×g, and the supernatant was precleared with 10 μg of sheared salmon sperm DNA, 20 μl of nonimmune sera, and 20 μl of a 50% slurry of protein A-Sepharose. Immunoprecipitation was with 500 ng of AR N-terminal rabbit polyclonal antibody (PG-21, Upstate Biotechnology), 2 μg of sheared salmon sperm DNA, and 20 μl of a 50% slurry of protein A-Sepharose. Control immunoprecipitations were with 500 ng of a rabbit anti-platelet-derived growth factor receptor antibody (Upstate Biotechnology). Precipitates were washed three times with 300 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 2.7 mm KCl, 0.05% Tween 20, and 1% deoxycholate. Three additional washes with 10 mm Tris, 1 mm EDTA were performed, and beads were then eluted three times with 35 μl of 1% SDS and 100 mm NaHCO3 at 37 °C for 10 min each. Eluates were pooled and incubated at 65 °C overnight to reverse cross-links. Products were then purified with QIAquick PCR purification spin resin (Qiagen, Valencia, CA), and 10% of the eluate was subjected to 50 cycles of PCR amplification with steps of 95, 55, and 72 °C for 1 min each. The primers were TGAGAAACCTGAGATTAGGA and ATCTCTCTCAGATCCAGGCT, corresponding to nucleotides −4270 to −4250 and −4065 to −4045, respectively, in the PSA enhancer, which flank the major androgen-responsive element (ARE) regulating this gene (27Schuur E.R.

Commun. 1997; 231: 784-788Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). PCR products were analyzed by gel electrophoresis and ethidium bromide staining in 5% agarose gels. Inputs represent 5% of the DNA used for the AR immunoprecipitations, which was similarly treated to reverse cross-links and then PCR-amplified using the same PSA primers. Previous biochemical studies showed that bicalutamide can maintain the AR in a cytoplasmic complex with HSP90 (21Veldscholte J. Berrevoets C.A. Brinkmann A.O. Grootegoed J.A. Mulder E. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 2393-2399Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). Immunohistochemical studies of the AR in androgen-independent PCa have generally shown strong nuclear expression, but AR in bicalutamide-treated patients with androgen-independent PCa has not been specifically examined. Therefore, tumor-containing bone marrow biopsies obtained from bicalutamide-treated patients with androgen-independent PCa were examined for AR expression. The results demonstrated strong nuclear AR expression in each of four cases examined (Fig. 1, A–C, and data not shown). To determine whether nuclear localization was inhibited by bicalutamide in normal prostate epithelium, mice were treated with bicalutamide (1 mg in 0.1 ml of PBS by intraperitoneal injection every other day for 2 weeks), and their prostates were examined. The seminal vesicles in the treated mice were markedly shrunken, indicative of AR inhibition (not shown). However, immunohistochemistry showed strong nuclear AR expression in the prostate epithelium of both untreated and bicalutamide-treated mice (Fig. 1, E and F). These results demonstrated that bicalutamide did not prevent AR nuclear translocation in normal or malignant prostate epithelial cells. To assess the effect of bicalutamide on AR cellular localization in PCa cells in vitro, the LNCaP prostate cancer cell line was examined. LNCaP expresses a mutant AR that is activated by 8-hydroxyflutamide (the active metabolite of flutamide) but is still blocked by bicalutamide (19Veldscholte J. Berrevoets C.A. Ris-Stalpers C. Kuiper G.G. Jenster G. Trapman J. Brinkmann A.O. Mulder E. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1992; 41: 665-669Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar, 30Veldscholte J. Ris-Stalpers C. Kuiper G.G.

Moreover, bicalutamide can inhibit LNCaP growth and PSA production. Consistent with previous studies, immunofluorescence showed that the AR in LNCaP cells grown in steroid hormone-depleted medium was diffusely distributed in the cytoplasm and nucleus (Fig. 2 A). Treatment with DHT resulted in rapid nuclear accumulation with the AR being almost completely nuclear at 2 h (Fig. 2, B andC). Treatment with bicalutamide also resulted in rapid nuclear translocation (Fig. 2, D and E). Similar results have been obtained using transfected wild type AR in HeLa cells (data not shown). Taken together, these findings indicated that bicalutamide, in addition to not blocking nuclear expression of AR in prostate epithelium, had agonist activity with respect to AR nuclear translocation. Despite nuclear AR expression, bicalutamide can completely block DHT-stimulated AR transactivation and has no detectable partial agonist activity on the full-length AR (18Fenton M.A. Shuster T.D. Fertig A.M. Taplin M.E. Kolvenbag G. Bubley G.J. Balk S.P. Clin. Cancer Res. 1997; 3: 1383-1388PubMed Google Scholar). However, transcriptional activation by the full-length AR is a multistep process involving DNA binding, homodimerization, interaction between the AR N and C termini, and association with coactivator proteins. Therefore, to assess bicalutamide effects on DNA binding independent of these latter protein-protein interactions, the heterologous VP16 transactivation domain was fused to the N terminus of full-length AR. The VP16-AR (2–919) fusion protein was inactive in the absence of androgen but could be strongly stimulated by DHT (Fig.3 A, left panel). Bicalutamide similarly induced substantial activation of the VP16-AR (2–919) fusion (Fig. 3 A, right panel). Importantly, maximal activity was seen in the micromolar concentration range, well within the bicalutamide levels in patients treated with this drug (31Cockshott I.D. Cooper K.J. Sweetmore D.S. Blacklock N.J. Denis L. Eur. Urol. 1990; 18: 10-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Therefore, this result indicated that bicalutamide had partial agonist activity with respect to stimulating AR binding to DNA. Chromatin immunoprecipitation was used to further assess whether bicalutamide stimulated AR binding to an endogenous androgen-regulated gene. LNCaP or DU145 (AR-negative) PCa cells grown in steroid hormone-depleted medium were treated with DHT or bicalutamide. They were then examined by chromatin immunoprecipitation for AR binding to the PSA enhancer (−4270 to −4045 from the start site), which contains the major ARE regulating this gene and multiple weak AREs (27Schuur E.R.

Immunoprecipitates with an irrelevant antibody (anti-platelet-derived growth factor receptor) and AR immunoprecipitates from the DU145 cells or the untreated LNCaP cells contained little or no detectable PSA enhancer DNA (Fig.3 B). In contrast, both DHT and bicalutamide treatments stimulated AR association with the enhancer, further supporting the conclusion that bicalutamide stimulates AR binding to AREs. Previous studies showed that a ligand-dependent interaction between the AR N and C termini made a major contribution to AR transcriptional activity and that this interaction was not stimulated by antagonists including cyproterone acetate or flutamide (32Wong C.I.

A mammalian two-hybrid protein binding assay was similarly used to determine whether bicalutamide could stimulate this interaction. Cells were transfected with vectors encoding VP16-AR (2–505) and Gal4-AR (661–919) fusion proteins (corresponding to the AR N-terminal and ligand binding domains, respectively) in conjunction with a luciferase reporter gene regulated by tandem Gal4-responsive elements (pG5-Luc). There was no detectable interaction between these proteins in the absence of ligand, but the interaction could be strongly stimulated by DHT (Fig.4, left panel). In contrast, bicalutamide did not stimulate this interaction. The transcriptional activity of steroid hormone receptors is also mediated by ligand-dependent binding of coactivator proteins, in particular SRC-1 and -2 (35McKenna N.J. Lanz R.B. O'Malley B.W. Endocr. Rev. 1999; 20: 321-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (1655) Google Scholar), and increased expression of these coactivators has been reported in androgen-independent PCa (36Gregory C.W., He, B.

These coactivator proteins have leucine-X-X-leucine-leucine (LXXLL) motifs that mediate ligand-dependent binding to the ligand binding domain and contain a distinct site that binds to the N-terminal, with binding to the AR being mediated primarily by this latter N-terminal interaction (38Onate S.A.

To determine whether the bicalutamide-liganded AR could interact with SRC-1, cells were cotransfected with AR and SRC-1 expression vectors. Consistent with previous reports, SRC-1 could augment DHT-stimulated AR transcriptional activity (Fig. 5 A). However, SRC-1 did not stimulate AR activity in the absence of ligand or in the presence of bicalutamide. SRC-2 transfection similarly enhanced DHT-stimulated transcriptional activity (although the effect was more modest) but not ligand-independent or bicalutamide-mediated activity (Fig. 5 B). These results indicated that unliganded or bicalutamide-liganded AR could not associate with these coactivators, which did not support SRC-1 or SRC-2 overexpression as a mechanism of AR activity in androgen-independent PCa. Although the SRC proteins did not stimulate activity of the unliganded or bicalutamide-liganded AR, castrated males still produce androgens that can be converted to DHT in prostate cells. Therefore, further experiments addressed whether SRC proteins could enhance AR responses to lower levels of DHT. Dose response studies showed that SRC-1 transfection enhanced DHT-stimulated AR activity over a broad range of DHT concentrations (Fig. 5, C and D). However, a marked left shift in the dose response curve to lower DHT concentrations was not observed, suggesting that SRC-1 did not increase AR affinity for DHT. It was next determined whether SRC-1 overexpression diminished the ability of bicalutamide, at concentrations obtained in vivo, to inhibit DHT-stimulated AR transcriptional activity. As shown in Fig.6 A, bicalutamide at 5 μm could completely block the AR transcriptional activity stimulated by 10 nm DHT. In contrast, SRC-1-transfected cells treated with 10 nm DHT and 5 μmbicalutamide had substantial AR activity with lower but still detectable activity at 25 μm bicalutamide. Cotransfection with SRC-2 similarly stimulated AR transcriptional activity in the presence of DHT and 1–5 μm bicalutamide (Fig.6 B). Further dose response studies showed that SRC-1 transfection did not markedly alter the IC50 for bicalutamide, which was between 0.1 and 1 μm (data not shown). In conjunction with the above DHT dose response studies, these results indicated that SRC-1 was functioning primarily by augmenting the transcriptional activity of agonist-bound AR rather than by decreasing the ability of bicalutamide to compete with DHT for AR binding. A prediction based on the above data was that androgen-independent PCa cells overexpressing SRC proteins should respond to higher doses of bicalutamide or to more potent AR antagonists. Such AR-expressing cell lines derived from androgen-independent PCa are not available, but the LNCaP prostate cancer cell line has features of androgen-independent PCa. In particular, although LNCaP proliferation and PSA production are stimulated by DHT, they are only partially inhibited by bicalutamide at 5–10 μm. Therefore, the effects of higher bicalutamide concentrations on these cells were assessed. PSA production by LNCaP cells was inhibited progressively by bicalutamide concentrations up to 100 μm (Fig.7 A). Inhibition of LNCaP cell growth as assessed by the percentage of cells in S phase was also progressively inhibited at bicalutamide concentrations up to 40–80 μm (Fig. 7 B). The inhibitory effects of bicalutamide were abrogated by added DHT, indicating that the inhibition reflected AR blockade and not nonspecific toxicity due to the high bicalutamide concentrations (Fig. 7 C). These findings indicated that the AR in LNCaP cells remained active even at 10 μm bicalutamide and could be antagonized by higher concentrations of the drug. Previous reports have suggested that bicalutamide functioned as a pure antagonist by preventing AR DNA binding (18Fenton M.A. Shuster T.D. Fertig A.M. Taplin M.E. Kolvenbag G. Bubley G.J. Balk S.P.

Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 2393-2399Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). In contrast, the data reported here demonstrate that the bicalutamide-liganded AR localizes in the nucleus and, more importantly, that it can bind to AREs in episomal reporter genes and in the endogenous PSA promoter. However, the bicalutamide-liganded AR is transcriptionally inactive. Consistent with this lack of transcriptional activity, bicalutamide did not stimulate binding of the AR N terminus to the C-terminal ligand binding domain. Moreover, cotransfection of bicalutamide-treated cells with SRC-1 or -2 did not stimulate AR activity, indicating that these coactivator proteins did not interact with the bicalutamide-liganded AR. Taken together, these findings indicate that the bicalutamide-liganded AR binds to DNA but in a transcriptionally inactive conformation. The lack of AR N- and C-terminal interaction in the bicalutamide-liganded AR is not surprising as this is mediated by an LXXLL-like motif in the N terminus and is dependent on an agonist conformation in the ligand binding domain (40He B. Kemppainen J.A. Wilson E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 22986-22994Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). However, SRC-1 binding to the AR is primarily or exclusively through the N terminus as the LXXLL motifs in SRC-1 do not bind to the AR ligand binding domain (39Alen P. Claessens F. Verhoeven G. Rombauts W. Peeters B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 6085-6097Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar, 41Bevan C.L. Hoare S. Claessens F. Heery D.M. Parker M.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 8383-8392Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). The precise site in the AR N terminus that mediates SRC-1 binding has not been identified, but the lack of SRC-1 interaction with the bicalutamide-liganded AR indicates that the N-terminal binding site may be affected by ligand binding, possibly reflecting a role for the AR N- and C-terminal interaction in positioning or exposing the N-terminal SRC-1 binding site. Alternatively, binding of a corepressor to the bicalutamide-liganded AR could block SRC-1 binding or inhibit its coactivator functions (see below). Although SRC-1 and -2 did not stimulate transcriptional activation of the unliganded or bicalutamide-liganded AR, higher concentrations of bicalutamide were needed to block DHT-stimulated transcriptional activity in cells transfected with SRC-1 or -2. This did not appear to reflect an increase in the affinity for DHT relative to bicalutamide as SRC-1 transfection did not markedly alter the dose response to DHT or the apparent IC50 for bicalutamide inhibition of DHT-stimulated AR activity. The most straightforward explanation for these results is that SRC-1 and -2 are rate-limiting coactivators and enhance the transcriptional activity of the small fraction of DHT-liganded ARs. Importantly, this enhancement could be relevant in PCa patients being treated with androgen deprivation therapy (castration or luteinizing hormone releasing hormone agonist) in conjunction with bicalutamide. In this setting, in which there are still substantial levels of circulating androgens, increased expression of SRC proteins would diminish the efficacy of bicalutamide in blocking residual AR activity. Recent reports demonstrate that the AR can also bind to corepressor proteins, including nuclear corepressor (NCoR), indicating that corepressor binding could further contribute to the in vivo antagonist activity of bicalutamide (42Yu X., Li, P. Roeder R.G. Wang Z. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 4614-4625Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 43Cheng, S., Brzostek, S., Lee, S. R., Hollenberg, A. N., and Balk, S. P. (2002) Mol. Endocrinol., in pressGoogle Scholar, 44Shang Y. Myers M. Brown M. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 601-610Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (563) Google Scholar). This would suggest down-regulation of a corepressor as another mechanism for development of bicalutamide-resistant PCa. These data also suggest that bicalutamide may function as a selective AR modulator. However, in contrast to the selective estrogen receptor modulators tamoxifen and raloxifene, bicalutamide does not appear to activate the N-terminal activation function (AF-1) of the AR, and cell types or tissues in which bicalutamide functions as an AR agonist have not been identified. In summary, these results demonstrate that bicalutamide does not function as an AR antagonist by preventing AR binding to DNA but instead stimulates the assembly of a transcriptionally inactive receptor on DNA. These findings support a continued role for the AR in androgen-independent bicalutamide-resistant PCa and suggest that the increased expression of AR and transcriptional coactivator proteins in androgen-independent PCa may decrease the efficacy of bicalutamide in blocking AR activation by residual androgens. Importantly, this mechanism predicts that inhibition of adrenal androgen production in conjunction with bicalutamide (or more potent AR antagonists) may have efficacy in androgen-independent PCa.

Thus, endoglin expression is regulated during heart development in humans and chicken (15Qu R. Silver M.M. Letarte M.

Despite the data supporting an important role for endoglin in the TGF-β system, the molecular basis of endoglin function is still poorly understood. Several lines of evidence suggest that endoglin is not a receptorper se: (a) in endothelial cells, only a small percentage of endoglin molecules is capable of binding TGF-β; (b) endoglin does not bind ligand on its own but requires the presence of the signaling receptors (11Letamendı́a A.

All of these data suggest that endoglin association with the signaling receptors is critical for endoglin access to ligand and for its modulation of the ligand-induced cellular responses. Here, we have investigated the domains involved in the association between endoglin and the signaling receptors as well as the consequences of this interaction on the phosphorylation status of the proteins involved. The monkey kidney COS-7 and the rat myoblast L6E9 cell lines were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum in 5% CO2 at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere. COS-7 cells were transiently transfected with expression vectors encoding wild type and mutant constructs of endoglin, TβRI, or TβRII using LipofectAMINE Plus as indicated by the manufacturer (Invitrogen). Functional assays were carried out 48 h after transfection. Treatment of cells with recombinant human TGF-β1 (Peprotech) was performed at a concentration of 10 ng/ml for 30 min. Wild type human endoglin cDNA subcloned into the pCMV5 vector (11Letamendı́a A. Lastres P. Botella L.M. Raab U. Langa C. Velasco B. Attisano L. Bernabéu C. J. Biol.

The resulting PCR fragments were cloned into pDisplay (Invitrogen) expression vector, which allows expression of proteins on the cell surface. All endoglin constructs expressed from pDisplay contain the influenza hemagglutinin epitope HA at the NH2 terminus. The oligonucleotides used to prime the PCR synthesis of endoglin fragments were as follows: TMCT-Endo (amino acids 573–658), GAAGATCTAACATCATCAGCCCTGAC and TCCCCGCGGGGCTATGCCATGCTGCT; EC-Endo (amino acids 26–586), GGGGCCCAGCCGGCCGAAACAGTCCATTGT and TCCCCGCGGGGCCTTTGCTTGT; ECTM-Endo (amino acids 26–614), GGGGCCCAGCCGGCCGAAACAGTCCATTGT and TCCCCGCGGTCAGTAGATGTACCA; 558-Endo (amino acids 26–558), GGGGCCCAGCCGGCCGAAACAGTCCATTGT and TCCCCGCGGCCCGGTCTTGGG; 437-Endo (amino acids 26–437), GGGGCCCAGCCGGCCGAAACAGTCCATTGT and TCCCCGCGGTTTCCGCTGTGG; 437/586-Endo (amino acids 437–586), GGGGCCCAGCCGGCCGAAAAAGGTGCACTGC and TCCCCGCGGGCCTTTGCTTGT. The oligonucleotides were designed to introduce a SfiI restriction site at the 5′-end (except for the TMCT-Endo mutant, which contains a BglII restriction site) and a SacII site at the 3′-end of the endoglin DNA fragments. The reverse primers for TMCT-Endo and ECTM-Endo include a stop codon. All primer sequences for this study are given from 5′ to 3′. Full-length endoglin was also subcloned into the pDisplay vector to generate an HA epitope-tagged endoglin. The construct was engineered by PCR using forward primer that included a SfiI restriction site (GGGGCCCAGCCGGCCGAAACAGTCCATTGT) and reverse primer that included a stop codon and a SacII site (TCCCCGCGGGGCTATGCCATGCTGCT). The pCMV5 expression constructs containing cDNAs for TβRII/HA (tagged at the COOH terminus with the influenza hemagglutinin (HA) epitope), HA/TβRII (K277R) (tagged at the NH2 terminus with the HA epitope), TβRI/HA, TβRI (T204D)/HA, and TβRI (K232R)/HA have been described (23Labbe E.

To generate the GST-Ecyt fusion protein, the cytoplasmic domain of endoglin was amplified by PCR, using forward (5′-GAATTCTGGTACATCTACTCGCACACGC-3′) and reverse (5′-GGCTATGCCATGCTGCTGGTGG-3′) primers, and the product was cloned into pGEX-1λT (Amersham Biosciences). To generate the GST-GS/TβRI fusion protein, the juxtamembrane and GS domains of TβRI (amino acids 146–207) were amplified by PCR, using forward (5′-CGGGATCCATCTGCCACAACCGC-3′) and reverse (5′-CGGAATTCTTGTAACACAATAGTTCTCGC-3′) primers, and the product was cloned into pGEX4T-3 (Amersham Biosciences). Plasmids encoding GST-Smad2, GST-Smad3, and GST-Smad4 were kindly provided by Dr. Liliana Attisano (University of Toronto). Fusion proteins were expressed and purified according to the manufacturer's instructions. The endoglin-specific monoclonal antibodies P4A4 and P3D1 have been previously described, and they recognize epitopes contained within the fragments Tyr227–Gly331and Glu26–Gly230 of human endoglin, respectively (24Pichuantes S. Vera S. Bourdeau A. Pece N. Kumar S. Letarte M. Tissue Antigens. 1997; 50: 265-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). For recognition of TβRII and TβRI, specific polyclonal antibodies were used (C16 and V22, respectively; Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc., Santa Cruz, CA). Proteins tagged with the influenza virus HA epitope were detected with the monoclonal antibody 12CA5 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Cells were lysed at 4 °C for 30 min with lysis solution (50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm EGTA, 1% digitonin, 1 mm NaF, 10 mm NaVO4, 1 mmMo2VO4, and a mixture of protease inhibitors). Aliquots of total cell lysates containing equivalent amounts of total protein were precleared for 4 h with protein G or protein A coupled to Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) at 4 °C. Specific immunoprecipitations of the precleared lysates were carried out in the presence of the appropriate antibody, using protein G- or protein A-Sepharose. After overnight incubation at 4 °C, immunoprecipitates were isolated by centrifugation and washed three times with lysis buffer. When required, immunoprecipitates were incubated with alkaline phosphatase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) at 37 °C for 1 h. Total lysates and the precipitated proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and electrotransferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane for immunodetection with the indicated antibody. Immunodetection was performed with the SuperSignal chemiluminescent substrate (Pierce) according to the manufacturer's instructions. COS cells were transiently transfected with the indicated HA-tagged endoglin constructs. After 48 h, cells were incubated with the mouse monoclonal antibody 12CA5 (against the influenza virus HA epitope; Roche Molecular Biochemicals) for 30 min at 4 °C. After two washes with phosphate-buffered saline, fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled F(ab′)2 rabbit anti-mouse Ig was added, and incubation proceeded for an additional period of 30 min at 4 °C. Finally, cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, and their fluorescence was estimated with an EPICS-CS (Coulter Cientifica), using logarithmic amplifiers. Results are expressed as an expression index calculated as the percentage of marker-positive cells multiplied by their mean fluorescence intensity. Immunoprecipitates of TβRI or TβRII were washed twice with lysis buffer, washed once with kinase buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mmMnCl2, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mmCaCl2), and resuspended in 40 μl of kinase buffer with 5 μm ATP, 1 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol; Amersham Biosciences), and 2 μg of recombinant GST, GST-Ecyt, GST-GS/TβRI, GST-Smad2, GST-Smad3, or GST-Smad4. The reaction was incubated for 30 min at 37 °C. Phosphorylation was stopped by the addition of Laemmli sample buffer, and the products were resolved by SDS-PAGE. The incorporation of [32P]phosphate was visualized by autoradiography. Assays for TβR-II kinase activity were performed as described above but without adding GST proteins. COS-7 cells were transfected with TβRI, TβRII, and endoglin, as indicated. After 48 h, the cells were washed in phosphate-free medium (ICN Biomedicals) and metabolically labeled with 0.5 mCi/ml [32P]orthophosphate for 3 h. Cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline, lysed with lysis buffer, and immunoprecipitated with the appropriate antibodies. Immunoprecipitates were analyzed on SDS-polyacrylamide gels, and radiolabeled bands were detected by autoradiography and quantified by densitometry using a PhosphorImager 410 and ImageQuant software. The pARE-lux reporter vector, encoding the activin response element of Xenopus mix.2 promoter fused to the luciferase reporter gene, and the TGF-β transcriptional co-activator Fast-1 have been previously described (25Chen X.

L6E9 myoblasts were selected for these studies, because they do not express endoglin or its homologue betaglycan, and they have proved to be a useful model system to analyze the function of endoglin and betaglycan in TGF-β responses (11Letamendı́a A. Lastres P. Botella L.M. Raab U. Langa C. Velasco B. Attisano L. Bernabéu C. J. Biol.

Cell. 1993; 73: 1435-1444Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (778) Google Scholar). Activity of the TGF-β reporter construct was determined by transient transfection of L6E9myoblasts using Superfect (Qiagen). Briefly, cells in 24-well plates were transfected with the pARE reporter and the endoglin or Fast-1 expression vectors at densities of 5 × 104cells/well. The amount of DNA in each transfection was normalized by using the corresponding insertless expression vector as carrier. After 24 h, cells were washed with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium before incubation with 5 ng/ml TGF-β1 for an additional 24-h period. Relative luciferase units from triplicate samples were determined in a TD20/20 luminometer (Promega, Madison, WI). Each transfection experiment was performed at least four times with different DNA preparations. Correction for transfection efficiency was made by cotransfection with the β-galactosidase expression vector pCMV-β-galactosidase, and the corresponding enzymatic activity was determined using the Galacto-Light kit (Tropix). The mean and S.D. were calculated and experimental results of the promoter constructs were displayed either as arbitrary units of luciferase activity, or as a -fold induction with respect to the corresponding untreated sample. To study the interaction of endoglin with TβRI or TβRII, COS cells were transfected with the corresponding expression vectors in the absence of exogenous ligand, and cell lysates were subjected to specific immunoprecipitation, followed by Western blot analysis. As shown in Fig.1, endoglin co-immunoprecipitates with either TβRI or TβRII as revealed by immunodetection with antibodies to TβRI and TβRII, respectively (lanes 3 and6). Although the transfected COS cells express low levels of signaling receptors, no association between endoglin and the endogenous receptors could be detected (lanes 1 and4). These results demonstrate that endoglin interacts with TβRI and with TβRII in the absence of exogenous TGF-β and that the formation of the endoglin-TβRI or endoglin-TβRII complexes does not require the presence of TβRII or TβRI, respectively. To analyze whether the complex formation of endoglin with TβRI or TβRII was affected by the activation state of the signaling receptors, experiments were performed in the presence of exogenous ligand or signaling receptors with varying catalytic activities. First, COS cells were transfected with endoglin and TβRI or TβRII and cultured with different concentrations of fetal calf serum, either in the absence or in the presence of 10 ng/ml exogenous TGF-β1. Fetal calf serum is a minor source of TGF-β, and preliminary experiments indicated that 0.2% is the minimal concentration of fetal calf serum required for cell viability. As shown in Fig.2 A, the amount of TβRI (left upper panel) or TβRII (right upper panel) co-immunoprecipitated by anti-endoglin antibodies is similar for all treatments, suggesting that the addition of exogenous ligand does not affect the formation of endoglin-TβRI or endoglin-TβRII complexes. Since the active TGF-β receptor signaling complex requires both TβRI and TβRII, endoglin association was analyzed when both signaling receptors were cotransfected (Fig. 2 B). Again, exogenous TGF-β did not affect the formation of endoglin complexes with TβRI or TβRII. Next, COS cells were transfected with expression vectors for endoglin as well as wild type and different kinase mutant versions of the signaling receptors. As shown in Fig.2 C, the constitutively active TβRI (T204D) mutant, the constitutively inactive TβRI (K232R) mutant, and the wild type TβRI construct were able to associate with endoglin (upper left panel). Similarly, the kinase-inactive TβRII (K277R), and the wild type TβRII constructs showed interaction with endoglin (upper right panel). Taken together, these results suggest that endoglin association with TβRI and TβRII is independent of the activation state of the signaling receptors. To identify the region(s) involved in the association with the signaling receptors, several truncated versions of endoglin were generated (Fig. 3). Construct HA-TMCT-Endo lacks the extracellular domain, HA-EC-Endo lacks the cytoplasmic and transmembrane regions, and HA-ECTM-Endo only lacks the cytoplasmic domain. Additional mutants encoding only part of the extracellular domain (558-Endo, 437-Endo, and 437/586-Endo) were also analyzed. Constructs 437-Endo and 437/586-Endo were generated around the arginine at position 437, because several lines of investigation suggest that this residue might define a protein domain: (a) it is located at a putative protease cleavage site of the protein; (b) artificial constructs truncated at position 437 can be expressed upon transfection of mammalian cells; and (c) its codon is located in the border between exons 9b and 10 (29). In order to facilitate the analysis of the mutants, all constructs contained an epitope tag of HA at the amino terminus. Transfection of these constructs in COS cells confirmed that all mutant versions of endoglin were expressed as evidenced by Western blot analysis (Fig.3 B). Since the wild type endoglin is a disulfide-linked dimer (30Gougos A. Letarte M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 8361-8364Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we analyzed whether the truncated forms were also disulfide-linked by subjecting the lysates to electrophoresis under reducing or nonreducing conditions. As shown in Fig. 3 B, all of the constructs were expressed in a dimeric form. Interestingly, the smallest construct, TMCT-Endo, contains only one cysteine residue at position 582 of the extracellular domain, suggesting its involvement in the dimerization process. This was further demonstrated by generating the mutant construct TMCT-Endo/C582G, where the cysteine at 582 has been replaced by a glycine. Transfection of this mutant yielded a monomeric form of endoglin, as opposed to the dimer obtained with the TMCT-Endo plasmid (Fig. 3 C). Furthermore, similar to the wild type endoglin, all of the truncated forms were also expressed at the cell surface as demonstrated by flow cytometry analysis (Fig.3 D). To investigate whether the extracellular domain of endoglin was involved in the association with the signaling receptors, HA-ECTM-Endo, TβRI, and TβRII were expressed upon transfection in COS cells. Immunoprecipitation analysis with anti-TβRI and anti-TβRII demonstrated that HA-ECTM-Endo was co-precipitated only when TβRI or TβRII were expressed (Fig.4 A), indicating that the extracellular domain of endoglin interacts with both signaling receptors. Parallel studies with HA-EC-Endo construct, which does not contain the transmembrane domain of endoglin, revealed similar levels of truncated protein co-precipitated with anti-TβRI and anti-TβRII (Fig. 4 A), further confirming the involvement of the extracellular domain and suggesting a nonrelevant role for the transmembrane region in the interaction with the signaling receptors. Next, the interactions of different truncations of the extracellular domain of endoglin with TβRI and TβRII were analyzed. Immunoprecipitation studies with anti-endoglin, anti-TβRI, and anti-TβRII demonstrated that HA-558-Endo, HA-437-Endo, and HA-437/586-Endo co-precipitated with TβRI, whereas only HA-558-Endo and HA-437/586-Endo co-precipitated with TβRII (Fig. 4, Band C). These results suggest that (a) TβRII interacts with residues 437–558 of the extracellular domain of endoglin, a region proximal to the transmembrane domain and (b) TβRI interacts not only with residues 437–558 but also with a second region comprised between amino acids 26 and 437 of the extracellular domain of endoglin. When studying the interaction between two different transmembrane proteins, it is important to assess both the involvement of their extracellular domains and that of their cytoplasmic domains. Endoglin is constitutively phosphorylated in Ser/Thr residues (31Lastres P. Martı́n-Perez J. Langa C. Bernabeu C. Biochem. J. 1994; 301: 765-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 32Yamashita H. Ichijo H. Grimsby S. Morén A. Dijke P. Miyazono K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1995-2001Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and both signaling receptors are Ser/Thr kinases (33Wrana J.L. Attisano L. Cárcamo J. Zentella A. Doody J. Laiho M. Wang X.F.

Acta. 1997; 1333: F105-F150Crossref PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar), thus providing a hint for the participation of their cytoplasmic domains in protein association. To study the interaction between endoglin cytoplasmic domain and TβRI or TβRII, the HA-TMCT-Endo construct (lacking the extracellular domain) was co-transfected with wild type or kinase mutants of TβRI and TβRII (Fig.5). Immunoprecipitation analysis with anti-TβRI and anti-TβRII demonstrated that the cytoplasmic domain of endoglin associates with TβRI when the kinase domain is inactive (K232R) but not with the constitutively active (T204D) form (Fig.5 A). In the same experiment, a weak band of endoglin was found associated with the wild type TβRI. This association is probably due to the TβRI activation induced by oligomerization of the signaling receptors that occurs upon transfection (35Wrana J.L. Attisano L. Weiser R. Ventura F. Massagué J. Nature. 1994; 370: 341-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (2120) Google Scholar, 36Ventura F. Doody J. Liu F. Wrana J.L. Massagué J. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5581-5589Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). In addition, the cytoplasmic domain of endoglin interacts with both the active (wild type) and inactive (K277R) forms of TβRII (Fig.5 B). These results demonstrate that the endoglin cytoplasmic domain interacts with TβRI and with TβRII. A detailed analysis of the bands separated by SDS-PAGE, corresponding to the endoglin cytoplasmic domain, revealed that the electrophoretic mobility of the HA-TMCT-Endo associated with the constitutively active TβRII (wild type) was lower than that of the HA-TMCT-Endo associated with the kinase-inactive (K277R) form of TβRII (Fig. 5, B and C; upper panels). Similar electrophoretic differences were observed when analyzing the endoglin cytoplasmic domain in total lysates derived from cells overexpressing either the wild type or the constitutively inactive form of TβRII, respectively (Fig. 5, B andC; lower panels). It is well known that phosphorylated proteins migrate more slowly that the unphosphorylated forms, suggesting that the electrophoretic differences observed above might be due to different p"

Our results show that this region contains orthologues of the tryptophan repressor as well as the α and β subunits of tryptophan synthase. Results from reverse transcription-PCR and Western blot analyses indicate that the trpBA genes are transcribed, and protein products are expressed. The TrpB sequences from all serovars are highly conserved. In comparison with other tryptophan synthase β subunits, the chlamydial TrpB subunit retains all conserved amino acid residues required for β reaction activity. In contrast, the chlamydial TrpA sequences display numerous mutations, which distinguish them from TrpA sequences of all other prokaryotes. All ocular serovars contain a deletion mutation resulting in a truncated TrpA protein, which lacks α reaction activity. The TrpA protein from the genital serovars retains conserved amino acids required for catalysis but has mutated several active site residues involved in substrate binding. Complementation analysis inEscherchia coli strains, with defined mutations in tryptophan biosynthesis, and in vitro enzyme activity data, with cloned TrpB and TrpA proteins, indicate these mutations result in a TrpA protein that is unable to utilize indole glycerol 3-phosphate as substrate. In contrast, the chlamydial TrpB protein can carry out the β reaction, which catalyzes the formation of tryptophan from indole and serine. The activity of the chlamydial Trp B protein differs from that of the well characterized E. coli andSalmonella TrpBs in displaying an absolute requirement for full-length TrpA.

Chlamydial infection involves the attachment of the EB to a host cell and its subsequent internalization into a membrane-bound vesicle known as the chlamydial inclusion. Within this inclusion the EB differentiates into an RB, which then multiplies by binary fission. The daughter RBs then redifferentiate into EBs that are able to initiate new rounds of infection after release by host cell lysis (1Moulder J.W. Microbiol. Rev. 1991; 55: 143-190Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Chlamydia consists of three species that are important pathogens of humans. Chlamydia psittaci strains are primarily pathogens of birds and lower animals, but humans are occasional hosts of avian-acquired psittacosis (2Schachter J. Pathol. Immunopathol. Res. 1989; 8: 206-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 3Schachter J. Stephens R.S. Chlamydia Intracellular Biology, Pathogenesis, and Immunity. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1999: 139-170Google Scholar). The two major pathogens of humans are Chlamydia trachomatisand Chlamydia pneumoniae. C. pneumoniae is an important cause of community-acquired pneumoniae (4Kuo C.C. Jackson L.A. Campbell L.A. Grayston J.T. Clin. Microbiol. Rev. 1995; 8: 451-461Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and has been linked to the etiology of chronic heart disease (5Campbell L.A. Rosenfeld M. Kuo C.C. Trends Microbiol. 2000; 8: 255-257Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 6Kuo C. Campbell L.A. Mol. Med.

Cardiologia. 1997; 42: 1145-1151PubMed Google Scholar). C. trachomatiscomprises a family of antigenically related yet divergent organisms serologically classified into 15 distinct serovars based on antigenic variation of the major outer membrane protein of the organism (8Stephens R. Moulder J.W. Antigenic Variation of Chlamydia trachomatis. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1989Google Scholar). Curiously, the 15 different C. trachomatis serovars exhibit an extraordinary specificity in tissue tropism. For example, serovars A, B, Ba, and C are pathogens of the eye, where they infect columnar epithelial cells of the conjunctivae causing trachoma, a chronic inflammatory disease that is the leading cause of preventable blindness in the world (2Schachter J. Pathol. Immunopathol. Res. 1989; 8: 206-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 3Schachter J. Stephens R.S. Chlamydia Intracellular Biology, Pathogenesis, and Immunity.

The trachoma serovars are rarely isolated from the genital tract. On the other hand, serovars D-K are sexually transmitted pathogens that infect columnar epithelial cells of the genital tract (2Schachter J. Pathol. Immunopathol. Res. 1989; 8: 206-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 3Schachter J. Stephens R.S. Chlamydia Intracellular Biology, Pathogenesis, and Immunity. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1999: 139-170Google Scholar). These infections are the most common bacterial cause of sexually transmitted disease and in females cause pelvic inflammatory disease. The sexually transmitted disease serovars can cause neonatal conjunctivitis but have not been associated with blinding trachoma. Furthermore, although infections with both ocular (A-C) and genital serovars (D-K) are non-invasive and are restricted to the mucosal epithelium, those caused by the sexually transmitted lymphogranuloma venereum (LGV) serovars (L1, L2, and L3) are invasive (2Schachter J. Pathol. Immunopathol. Res. 1989; 8: 206-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 3Schachter J. Stephens R.S. Chlamydia Intracellular Biology, Pathogenesis, and Immunity. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1999: 139-170Google Scholar). The LGV strains penetrate the submucosal tissue, infect monocytes and macrophages, and disseminate to the local draining lymph nodes, where they produce a chronic granulomatous disease. The factor(s) that controls the non-invasive/invasive properties of these genital serovars has been correlated with the production of a chlamydial cytotoxin (10Belland R.J. Scidmore M.A. Crane D.D. Hogan D.M. Whitmire W. McClarty G. Caldwell H.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 13984-13989Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar); however, virulence factors that decide the distinctive ocular and genital tract tissue tropisms have yet to be discovered. T cells play an important role in the development of adaptive immunity against C. trachomatis mucosal infection, and interferon γ (IFN-γ) is key to this protective function (11Brunham R.C. Stephens R.S. Chlamydia Intracellular Biology, Pathogenesis, and Immunity. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1999: 211-238Google Scholar, 12Kim S.K. DeMars R. Curr. Opin.

The mechanism by which IFN-γ controls infection in vitro is by interfering with the replicative capacity of the parasite (14Beatty W.L. Morrison R.P. Byrne G.I. Microbiol. Rev. 1994; 58: 686-699Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15Beatty W.L. Belanger T.A. Desai A.A. Morrison R.P. Byrne G.I. Infect. Immun. 1994; 62: 3705-3711Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Through binding of the IFN-γ receptor, IFN-γ transcriptionally activates the expression of indoleamine-2,3-dioxygenase, which degradesl-tryptophan to l-kynurenine (16Taylor M.W. Feng G.S. FASEB J. 1991; 5: 2516-2522Crossref PubMed Scopus (933) Google Scholar, 17Boehm U. Klamp T. Groot M. Howard J.C. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1997; 15: 749-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (2495) Google Scholar). This cytokine-mediated host cell response deprives intracellular chlamydial RBs of tryptophan, which ultimately prevents their growth and replicative capabilities. Treatment of epithelial cells with high levels of IFN-γ completely inhibits growth, whereas subinhibitory concentrations induce the development of morphologically aberrant viable RB forms that have been implicated in the development of persistence (15Beatty W.L.

In addition, partial sequence information is available for C. trachomatis serovar L2 (chlamydia-www.Berkeley.edu:4231). The gene order and content among these organisms are remarkably similar, with the exception of a region termed the plasticity zone, which has undergone genetic reorganization to a greater extent than the rest of the chromosome (19Read T.D. Brunham R.C. Shen C. Gill S.R. Heidelberg J.F. White O. Hickey E.K. Peterson J. Utterback T. Berry K. Bass S. Linher K. Weidman J. Khouri H. Craven B. Bowman C. Dodson R. Gwinn M. Nelson W. DeBoy R. Kolonay J. McClarty G. Salzberg S.L. Eisen J. Fraser C.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 1397-1406Crossref PubMed Scopus (649) Google Scholar). Genes encoding enzymes required for the biosynthesis of tryptophan are found within the plasticity zone. However, the complement of trp genes within this region varies among the chlamydial species characterized to date. C. psittaci GPIC contains all of the genes of the tryptophan biosynthesis pathway with the exception of the first two enzymes encoded by trpE/G. In contrast, C. trachomatis serovar MoPn and C. pneumoniae do not encode any trp genes in the plasticity zone. Interestingly,C. trachomatis serovars D and L2 contain only a subset oftrp genes in their plasticity zone, trpR, encoding a putative tryptophan repressor, and trpA andtrpB, respectively, encoding homologues of the α (TrpA) and β (TrpB) subunits of tryptophan synthase (Fig.1). This is an unusual circumstance in that most other organisms studied to date, both prokaryotic and eukaryotic, have either the full complement of trp genes or lack them altogether. A further heterogeneity within thetrpA gene of C. trachomatis has been identified by Shaw et al. (22Shaw A.C. Christiansen G. Roepstorff P. Birkelund S. Microbes Infect. 2000; 2: 581-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) in that serovar A and C appear to encode a truncated version of TrpA compared with serovars D and L2 (22Shaw A.C. Christiansen G. Roepstorff P. Birkelund S. Microbes Infect. 2000; 2: 581-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The differences in the trp gene complement among the chlamydiae characterized thus far suggest that the ability to synthesize tryptophan de novo is not required and raises the possibility that these genes are in the process of being lost from the genome. Alternatively, these differences may be important with respect to the unique tissue tropism of chlamydial strains and permit serovar-specific survival or growth within different microenvironments of the host. Tryptophan synthase is a tetramer consisting of two α subunits and two β subunits (23Miles E.W. Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol. Biol. 1991; 64: 93-172PubMed Google Scholar, 24Miles E.W. Subcell.

This bifunctional enzyme catalyzes the two final steps in the biosynthesis of tryptophan (Fig. 1), which are the cleavage of indole glycerol 3-phosphate (IGP) to indole and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate (termed the α reaction and catalyzed by TrpA) followed by the β-replacement reaction of indole with serine to form tryptophan (the β reaction, catalyzed by TrpB). Extensive characterization of the Escherichia coli andSalmonella enzymes has demonstrated a large degree of allosteric regulation and cooperativity between the α and β subunits (23Miles E.W. Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol. Biol. 1991; 64: 93-172PubMed Google Scholar, 24Miles E.W. Subcell. Biochem. 1995; 24: 207-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 25Miles E.W. Chem. Rec. 2001; 1: 140-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). In fact, TrpA and TrpB exhibit little activity in their respective reactions in the absence of the other subunit (26Lane A.N. Kirschner K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1983; 129: 571-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 27Miles E.W. McPhie P. J. Biol.

Given the association of IFN-γ with chlamydial infections and its effect on tryptophan levels in the host cell and, thus, on chlamydial growth, encoding functional tryptophan synthase may be a survival factor for intracellular chlamydiae. However, IGP substrate for the α reaction in E. coli and Salmonella is supplied by the sequential activity of the other genes of the tryptophan biosynthesis pathway (TrpE, D, FC) (Fig. 1). C. trachomatis does not encode orthologues of TrpE, G, D, or C, although paradoxically, it does have an orthologue of TrpF, the gene for which lies outside the plasticity zone (18Stephens R.S.

Because mammalian cells lack the ability to biosynthesize tryptophan and C. trachomatis appears to lack the capability of IGP synthesis, it is unclear what the substrate for chlamydial TrpA would be. The present work involved a study of the diversity within thetrp region among all 15 C. trachomatis serovars and characterization of the functionality of the tryptophan synthase encoded therein. Here we report that all the C. trachomatistype strain serovars, with the exception of B and MoPn, encode homologues of trpB and trpA, that the gene products are found in both EBs and RBs, and that the ability to synthesize tryptophan differs among ocular and genital serovars. Furthermore, we provide evidence that the α subunit of C. trachomatis tryptophan synthase differs from that of other Gram-negative bacteria with respect to the utilization of IGP as a substrate. The bacterial strains and plasmids utilized in this study are listed in TableI. E. coli strains were grown in Luria-Bertani (LB) broth or on LB agar and in the presence of 100 μg ml−1 ampicillin in the case of pQE-80L transformants.C. trachomatis serovars were propagated in the HeLa 229 cervical carcinoma cell line (ATCC) maintained in minimal essential medium (MEM, Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (FCS) as described previously (29Tipples G. McClarty G. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 4932-4940Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For growth of C. trachomatis under tryptophan-free conditions, dialyzed FCS was used. C. trachomatis EBs were purified by density gradient centrifugation according to established procedures and stored in sucrose phosphate glycerol medium at −80 °C (30Caldwell H.D. Kromhout J.

McClarty G. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 4932-4940Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As a negative control, a mock-infected flask was prepared in the same manner but without the addition of EBs. The cells were incubated for 24 h at 37 °C, and then total RNA was prepared using Trizol reagent according to the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen). After treatment with amplification-grade DNase I (Invitrogen), 1 μg of RNA was reverse-transcribed using random hexamer primers and Thermoscript reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) and then treated with RNase H (Invitrogen). Primers specific for 16 S rRNA and thetrpB-trpA junction (Table II) were used to amplify products in PCR reaction mixtures containing 2 μl of cDNA, 0.2 μm primers, 0.2 mm dNTPs, 1.5 mmMgCl2, 1× Taq reaction buffer, and 5 units ofTaq DNA polymerase (Invitrogen). The cycling program was 3 min at 95 °C followed by 30 cycles of 30 s at 95 °C, 30 s at 60 °C, and 1.5 min at 72 °C. Products were separated on a 1.5% agarose-Tris-buffered EDTA gel and visualized by ethidium bromide staining. Purified EBs were lysed by suspension in Laemmli buffer followed by incubation at 95 °C for 10 min. Soluble proteins were fractionated by SDS-PAGE and electrophoretically transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. The membranes were blocked with 5% skim milk and then incubated with anti-TrpA antiserum followed by horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated goat anti-rabbit immunoglobulin or with anti-TrpB ascites followed by goat anti-mouse HRP. Bound antibodies were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence according to manufacturer's instructions (Amersham Biosciences). C. trachomatis and E. coli trp genes were amplified by PCR from purified chromosomal DNA using the reagent concentrations described for RT-PCR and the cycling program 3 min at 95 °C followed by 30 cycles of 1 min at 95 °C, 30 s at 50 °C, and 2 min at 72 °C. The PCR primer sequences are listed in Table II and were designed to include unique restriction sites for cloning. For construction of plasmids to co-express trpB andtrpA, the 5′-CttrpB and the 3′-CttrpAprimers were used in the PCR reaction. The PCR products were gel-purified, restricted with KpnI and SalI (forC. trachomatis) or BamHI and KpnI (forE. coli) and ligated to expression vector pQE-80L (Qiagen) cut with the corresponding restriction enzymes. Constructs were transformed into DH5α for screening, purified by miniprep, and then used to transform E. coli mutant strains for complementation assays. Constructs co-expressing serovar A trpB with serovar L2 trpA and vice versa were prepared as follows. TheC. trachomatis trpA gene has a unique SpeI site 73 bp downstream of the start codon in a region of sequence identity among all of the serovars. Plasmids pCFG6 (serovar A trpBA) and pCR3 (serovar L2 trpBA) were restricted withSpeI and KpnI, and the fragments were gel-purified. The trpA-containing fragment from pCR3 was then ligated to the trpB-containing fragment from pCFG6 to generate pCFG7. Similarly, pCFG8 was constructed by ligating thetrpA-containing fragment from pCFG6 to thetrpB-containing fragment from pCR3. The cells from stationary phase cultures of E. coli trp transformants were harvested by centrifugation and washed three times with sterile phosphate-buffered saline. The cell suspensions were then streaked onto minimal agar (1× M9 salts, 0.2% glucose, 0.2% casamino acids, 2 mm MgSO4, 0.2 mml-serine, 100 μg ml−1 ampicillin, and 50 μg ml−1 each thiamine, cysteine, and uracil) containing 100 μm indole, 50 μg ml−1l-tryptophan or without additional supplements. The plates were incubated for 48 h at 37 °C and then photographed. Five ml of stationary phase cultures of CY15077 trp transformants were used to inoculate 50 ml of LB broth containing 100 μg ml−1 ampicillin. After incubation with aeration for 2 h at 37 °C, the cultures were cooled to 18 °C, isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (Invitrogen) was added to a final concentration of 100 μm, and the cultures were incubated with aeration for a further 18 h at 18 °C. The cells were then harvested by centrifugation, resuspended in 3 ml of 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, and lysed by sonication on ice. Cell debris was removed by centrifugation, and the cleared lysates were kept on ice. Protein concentration was determined by Bradford assay using a commercial kit (Bio-Rad). One unit of activity is defined as the appearance of 0.1 μmol of product (α reaction) or the disappearance of 0.1 μm substrate (β and αβ reactions) in 20 min at 37 °C. The α reaction assays and the αβ reaction assays were performed using the methods of Smith and Yanofsky (32Smith O.H. Yanofsky C. Methods Enzymol. 1962; 5: 794-806Crossref Scopus (119) Google Scholar). The α reaction mixture contained 0.3 μmol of IGP, 100 μmol of phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, 2 μmol of NH2OH, and 70 μl of cell lysate in a final volume of 0.5 ml. The αβ reaction mixture contained 0.4 μmol of IGP, 80 μmol of l-serine, 0.03 μmol of pyridoxal phosphate, 100 μmol of Tris buffer, pH 7.8, 30 μl of saturated NaCl, and 70 μl of cell lysate in a final volume of 1 ml. The β reaction assays were performed using the method of Miles (33Miles E.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1970; 245: 6016-6025Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The β reaction mixture contained 0.1 μmol of indole, 20 μmol of l-serine, 0.0075 μmol of pyridoxal phosphate, 25 μmol of Tris buffer, pH 7.8, 7.5 μl of saturated NaCl, and 50 μl of cell lysate in a final volume of 250 μl. Specific activity (units mg−1) is reported as the average of triplicate determinations. Monolayers of HeLa 229 cells in 6-well plates were infected with C. trachomatis EBs at an m.o.i. of 3–5 IFU cell−1 in MEM plus 10% dialyzed fetal bovine serum supplemented with tryptophan (10 mg liter−1) lacking tryptophan or lacking tryptophan but supplemented with indole (100 μm) or varying concentrations of anthranilate. For tryptophan-free conditions, HeLa cells were incubated for 6 h in tryptophan-free MEM plus 10% dialyzed fetal bovine serum before infection with C. trachomatis to ensure depletion of endogenous tryptophan.

The intracellular source of calcium and the signaling pathway(s) triggering release have not been characterized, prompting our search for mediators of calcium signaling and microneme secretion in T. gondii. We identified two stimuli of microneme secretion, ryanodine and caffeine, which enhanced release of calcium from parasite intracellular stores. Ethanol, a previously characterized trigger of microneme secretion, stimulated an increase in parasite inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate, implying that this second messenger may mediate intracellular calcium release. Consistent with this observation, xestospongin C, an inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate receptor antagonist, inhibited microneme secretion and blocked parasite attachment and invasion of host cells. Collectively, these results suggest thatT. gondii possess an intracellular calcium release channel with properties of the inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate/ryanodine receptor superfamily. Intracellular calcium channels, previously studied almost exclusively in multicellular animals, appear to also be critical to the control of parasite calcium during the initial steps of host cell entry.

Members of this phylum share a common vulnerability when the process of invasion is compromised, yet diseases caused by apicomplexans remain among the most difficult to cure. The invasion process is rapid and marked by the sequential secretion of parasite organelles. Micronemes, rhoptries, and dense granule contents are released by invading parasites and participate in attachment, vacuole formation, and intracellular survival (1Carruthers V.B. Sibley L.D. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 73: 114-123PubMed Google Scholar). Understanding the mechanisms regulating parasite secretion could thus be useful in the design of new therapeutic strategies aimed at blocking invasion.Micronemes are the first secretory organelles to be discharged duringToxoplasma gondii invasion. Microneme proteins possess a variety of adhesive domains and include soluble and transmembrane forms (2Tomley F.M. Soldati D.S.

Sibley L.D. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 73: 114-123PubMed Google Scholar). Binding studies suggest that microneme proteins participate in attachment to host cell surfaces (4Garcia-Réguet N. Lebrun M.

For example, association of T. gondii tachyzoites with host cells results in increases in parasite [Ca2+] i (8Vieira M.C. Moreno S.N. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2000; 106: 157-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) and chelation of T. gondii [Ca2+] i blocks microneme secretion and invasion (9Carruthers V.B. Giddings O.K. Sibley L.D. Cell. Microbiol. 1999; 1: 225-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). Moreover, reagents that raise T. gondii [Ca2+] i levels stimulate microneme discharge in the absence of host cells (10Carruthers V.B. Sibley L.D. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 31: 421-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). These include Ca2+ ionophores ionomycin and A23187, as well as the sarco-endoplasmic reticulum ATPase inhibitor thapsigargin (10Carruthers V.B. Sibley L.D. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 31: 421-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). Identification of alcohols as potent artificial triggers of microneme secretion led to studies demonstrating that ethanol also raises parasite [Ca2+] i levels (11Carruthers V.B. Moreno S.N.J. Sibley L.D. Biochem. J. 1999; 342: 379-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar).T. gondii possess several intracellular stores of Ca2+, including the acidocalcisomes (12Moreno S.N.J. Zhong L. Biochem. J. 1996; 313: 655-659Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar), mitochondria, and the endoplasmic reticulum (13Pingret L. Millot J.M. Sharonov S. Bonhomme A. Manfait M. Pinon J.M. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1996; 44: 1123-1129Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Whether all or some of these stores participate in microneme secretion during host cell invasion is unknown. The mechanism of Ca2+-mediated microneme release in both artificially triggered and natural microneme secretion during invasion remains largely undefined.Regulated exocytosis is associated with fluxes in [Ca2+] i , although the exact step requiring Ca2+ is unclear and may depend on the system being studied (14Brunger A.T. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2000; 10: 293-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Ca2+ signaling involves the mobilization of Ca2+ from two sources: intracellular stores and the extracellular medium. In mammalian cells, the sarco-endoplasmic reticulum is a commonly utilized source of readily accessible [Ca2+] i , which can be rapidly mobilized under a variety of stimuli. Two types of sarco-endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ release channels have been identified in multicellular animals: the IP31 receptor and the ryanodine receptor, which are structurally similar and are thought to be evolutionarily related (15Sorrentino V. Barone V. Rossi D. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2000; 10: 662-667Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Binding of the second messenger IP3 to its receptor releases Ca2+ into the cytosol, whereas ryanodine receptors are modulated in some cells by cyclic ADP-ribose (16Guse A.H. Cell. Signal. 1999; 11: 309-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). This release of intracellular Ca2+can in some manner signal the activation of Ca2+ entry, a process known as capacitative Ca2+ entry (17Putney J.W., Jr. Cell Calcium. 1990; 11: 611-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (1257) Google Scholar).Neither IP3, ryanodine receptors, or capacitative Ca2+ entry have been identified in unicellular organisms, including yeast and protozoa. However, evidence linking IP3to [Ca2+] i flux has been described in several unicellular systems. Treatment of membrane vesicles fromCandida albicans (18Calvert C.M. Sanders D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7272-7280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) or Plasmodium chabaudi (19Passos A.P. Garcia C.R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 245: 155-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) with IP3 results in Ca2+ release and is blocked by the IP3 receptor antagonist heparin. IP3induces Ca2+ release from Euglena gracilismicrosomes in a dose-dependent manner (20Masuda W. Takenaka S. Tsuyama S. Tokunaga M. Yamaji R. Inui H. Miyatake K. Nakano Y. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. C Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1997; 118: 279-283PubMed Google Scholar). Carbachol stimulation of Trypanosoma cruzi results in increased [Ca2+] i and IP3 (21Marchesini N. Bollo M. Hernández G. Garrido M.N. Machado-Domenech E.E. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2002; 120: 83-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). In characean algae, introduction of IP3 produces action potentials, an event known to involve increases in cytoplasmic Ca2+ (22Thiel G. MacRobbie E.A.C. Hanke D.E. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 1737-1741Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Collectively, these studies indicate a potential role for IP3 in Ca2+-mediated signaling events among early branching unicellular eukaryotes.We were interested in determining whether IP3 functions as a mediator of microneme secretion by increasing parasite [Ca2+] i . In this work, we present evidence that T. gondii may possess intracellular release channels of the IP3/ryanodine receptor superfamily.DISCUSSIONCalcium-mediated exocytosis of T. gondii microneme proteins is a key step in the invasion of host cells. The control of intracellular Ca2+ levels in T. gondii is not well characterized, prompting our search for modulators of secretion whose target was well studied in other Ca2+ signaling systems. We identified ryanodine and caffeine, two ryanodine receptor agonists, as stimuli of Ca2+-mediated microneme secretion. We also found that the second messenger IP3 was induced upon ethanol stimulation of parasites. Finally, the IP3receptor antagonist xestospongin C inhibited the caffeine- and ethanol-induced increases in [Ca2+] i , as well as preventing microneme secretion, attachment, and invasion. Together, these results strongly suggest that channels of the IP3/ryanodine receptor superfamily in T. gondii mediate increases in [Ca2+] i , which in turn promote microneme secretion.Ryanodine is an active component of the botanical insecticide ryania, an alkaloid found in the shrub Ryania speciosa. Ryanodine has potent effects on a variety of multicellular organisms (25Dobrowolski J.M. Sibley L.D. Cell. 1996; 84: 933-939Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar). Receptors that release calcium from intracellular stores in response to ryanodine treatment have been described in vertebrates, where they usually are expressed in specialized neurosecretory or muscle cells (15Sorrentino V. Barone V. Rossi D. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2000; 10: 662-667Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Ryanodine receptors also exist in a variety of invertebrates including crustaceans, insects, and worms; however, they have not been described in unicellular organisms (32Sutko J.L. Airey J.A. Physiol. Rev. 1996; 76: 1027-1071Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). At micromolar levels ryanodine stabilizes ryanodine receptors in the open form, allowing Ca2+ liberation from the sarco-endoplasmic lumen (26Zucchi R. Ronca-Testoni S. Pharmacol. Rev. 1997; 49: 1-51PubMed Google Scholar). At higher concentrations, ryanodine receptor channels in rabbit skeletal sarcoplasmic reticulum vesicles are persistently blocked (33Buck E. Zimanyi I. Abramson J.J. Pessah I.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23560-23567Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We observed a similar biphasic dose response in T. gondii, and ryanodine stimulation of microneme secretion was dependent on both intracellular and extracellular calcium. Ryanodine stimulation of [Ca2+] i release has been shown to require extracellular calcium as part of its Ca2+-induced Ca2+ release mechanism, suggesting it may activate flux through plasma membrane channels and capacitative entry (17Putney J.W., Jr. Cell Calcium. 1990; 11: 611-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (1257) Google Scholar, 26Zucchi R.

The induction of calcium release in T. gondii treated with ryanodine parallels that in well studied systems, suggesting the existence of ryanodine-responsive calcium channels in this early branching eukaryote.Caffeine also induced microneme secretion by T. gondii, and was effective at doses that are 100-fold lower than its activity on mammalian cells. Unlike ryanodine, caffeine did not require extracellular Ca2+, a result similar to that reported for rat PC12 cells (35Koizumi S. Lipp P. Berridge M.J. Bootman M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33327-33333Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). In addition to acting on ryanodine-like calcium channels, caffeine and related alkylxanthines have been shown to inhibit cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterases (25Dobrowolski J.M. Sibley L.D. Cell. 1996; 84: 933-939Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar, 26Zucchi R. Ronca-Testoni S. Pharmacol. Rev. 1997; 49: 1-51PubMed Google Scholar, 33Buck E. Zimanyi I. Abramson J.J. Pessah I.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23560-23567Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The resulting increases in cyclic AMP and activation of protein kinase A can give rise to an increase in [Ca+2] i in mammalian cells (36Wayman G.A. Hinds T.R. Storm D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24108-24115Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Although isobutylmethylxanthine, a nonselective phosphodiesterase inhibitor, also stimulated microneme secretion by T. gondii, two drugs expected to directly increase cyclic AMP, forskolin and 8-bromo-cyclic AMP, had no affect on microneme secretion. Similarly, treatment of parasites with 8-bromo-cyclic GMP did not affect microneme secretion. Thus, while we cannot rule out possible inhibition of phosphodiesterases, the effect of caffeine in elevating [Ca2+] i in T. gondii does not seem to be due to this mechanism. A third possible mode of action is that caffeine may inhibit the sarco-endoplasmic reticulum type ATPase involved in refilling calcium stores. This would be consistent with the results showing a more sustained [Ca2+] i elevation with caffeine than with ryanodine in the absence of extracellular Ca2+(Fig. 2 B). While this pump is not yet characterized inT. gondii, studies in the ciliate Paramecium tetraurelia have shown that the sarco-endoplasmic reticulum ATPase is exquisitely sensitive to caffeine inhibition (37Kissmehl R. Huber S. Kottwitz B. Hauser K. Plattner H. Cell Calcium. 1998; 24: 193-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Ciliates are phylogenetically close relatives of the Apicomplexa. Determination of whether this mechanism for caffeine also operates in T. gondii and related parasites will require further study.Unlike paramecium, the [Ca2+] i pool in T. gondii is sensitive to thapsigargin (12Moreno S.N.J. Zhong L. Biochem. J. 1996; 313: 655-659Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar); however, ethanol stimulation of thapsigargin-pretreated parasites generates an additional increase in [Ca2+] i (11Carruthers V.B. Moreno S.N.J. Sibley L.D. Biochem. J. 1999; 342: 379-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar), implying that they also possess a thapsigargin-insensitive [Ca2+] i pool. Similarly, pretreatment with thapsigargin prior to stimulation with caffeine or ryanodine did not inhibit microneme secretion (data not shown), suggesting that this same thapsigargin-insensitive pool may be stimulated by caffeine or ryanodine.Our studies demonstrate that IP3 acts as a second messenger during the stimulation of tachyzoites with ethanol, a known Ca2+-mediated trigger of microneme secretion (11Carruthers V.B. Moreno S.N.J. Sibley L.D. Biochem. J. 1999; 342: 379-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). In higher eukaryotes, IP3 induces calcium release from channels located in the sarco-endoplasmic reticulum in a variety of cell types (38Berridge M.J. Nature. 1993; 361: 315-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (6148) Google Scholar). Typically, IP3 is produced along with diacylglycerol after hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate by inositol phospholipid-specific phospholipase C (PLC). In higher eukaryotes, this process is mediated by PLC-γ signaling through tyrosine kinase receptors and PLC-β activated via heterotrimeric G-proteins (39Berridge M.J. Lipp P. Bootman M.D. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 1: 11-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (4372) Google Scholar). Comparisons of PLC isoforms δ, γ, and β suggest that PLC-δ was present in single-celled eukaryotes, while the β and γ forms arose after the development of multicellular organisms ∼940 million years ago (40Koyanagi M. Ono K. Suga H. Iwabe N. Miyata T. FEBS Lett. 1998; 439: 66-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Consequently, parasites likely contain only the ancestral PLC-δ isoform. Consistent with this idea, T. cruzi contains a PLC-δ isoform (41Furuya T. Kashuba C. Docampo R. Moreno S.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6428-6438Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) and PLC-δ candidate sequences are present in the Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium vivax genomes (42Bahl A. Brunk B. Coppel R.L. Crabtree J. Diskin S.J. Fraunholz M.J. Grant G.R. Gupta D. Huestis R.L. Kissinger J.C. Labo P., Li, L. McWeeney S.K. Milgram A.J. Roos D.S. Schug J. Stoeckert C.J., Jr. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 87-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). While not conventionally associated with Ca2+ signaling, PLC-δ has recently been linked to Ca2+ transients associated with fertilization in mice (43Fukami K. Nakao K. Inoue T. Kataoka Y. Kurokawa M. Fissore R.A. Nakamura K. Katsuki M. Mikoshiba K. Yoshida N. Takenawa T. Science. 2001; 292: 920-923Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Thus, it is possible that PLC-δ plays an important role in protozoan calcium regulation.Previous evidence for IP3-responsive Ca2+release channels in unicellular organisms has been indirect.Entamoeba histolytica crude membranes bind radiolabeled IP3 (44Raha S. Dalal B. Biswas S. Biswas B.B. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1994; 65: 63-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), and a cross-reacting IP3 receptor antibody detects an appropriately sized protein in the ciliateBlepharisma japonicum (45Fabczak H. Walerczyk M. Groszynska G. Fabczak S. Photochem. Photobiol. 1999; 69: 254-258PubMed Google Scholar, 46Matsuoka T. Moriyama N. Kida A. Okuda K. Suzuki T. Kotsuki H. J. Photochem. Photobiol. B. Biol. 2000; 54: 131-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Combined with the present findings, these results indicate that single-celled eukaryotes also likely have intracellular calcium release channels that respond to IP3. However, our attempts to identify IP3 or ryanodine receptor channels in T. gondii using a cross-reactive antibody (mouse monoclonal antibody 34C anti-chicken ryanodine receptor) (47Airey J.A. Beck C.F. Murakami K. Tanksley S.J. Deerinck T.J. Ellisman M.H. Sutko J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 14187-14194Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) have not been successful. IP3 and ryanodine receptors are ∼40% homologous between Caenorhabditis elegans and vertebrates, and they are likely to be significantly more divergent in protozoa due to their early branching phylogenetic position (48Baldauf S.L. Roger A.J. Wenk-Siefert I. Doolittle W.F. Science. 2000; 290: 972-977Crossref PubMed Scopus (963) Google Scholar). We have analyzed the nearly complete genomes of P. falciparum (42Bahl A. Brunk B. Coppel R.L. Crabtree J. Diskin S.J. Fraunholz M.J. Grant G.R. Gupta D. Huestis R.L. Kissinger J.C. Labo P., Li, L. McWeeney S.K. Milgram A.J. Roos D.S. Schug J. Stoeckert C.J., Jr. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 87-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) and Cryptosporidium parvum(www.parvum.mic.vcu.edu/) and the Apicomplexan expressed sequence tag databases (paradb.cis.upenn.edu/) and found that these organisms do not contain well recognized motifs for IP3 or ryanodine receptors such as SPRY and MIR domains. Consequently, it is likely that protozoa such as T. gondiipossess intracellular calcium release channels that are unconventional in sequence and/or function.Our observations suggest that IP3 catalyzes [Ca2+] i release in the parasite through an intracellular channel related to the IP3ryanodine receptor superfamily during T. gondii invasion of host cells. To test whether production of IP3 was necessary for microneme secretion and host cell attachment, we utilized xestospongin C, a compound that inhibits IP3-dependent Ca2+ release from rat cerebellar microsomes (31Gafni J. Munsch J.A. Lam T.H. Catlin M.C. Costa L.G. Molinski T.F. Pessah I.N. Neuron. 1997; 19: 723-733Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (510) Google Scholar) and Dictyostelium vesicles (34Schaloske R. Schlatterer C. Malchow D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8404-8408Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Xestospongin C acts primarily as a competitive inhibitor of IP3 to block calcium release from IP3receptors; however, it can also inhibit ryanodine receptors with somewhat lower potency (31Gafni J. Munsch J.A. Lam T.H. Catlin M.C. Costa L.G. Molinski T.F. Pessah I.N. Neuron. 1997; 19: 723-733Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (510) Google Scholar). Xestospongin C treatment of T. gondii inhibited ethanol- and caffeine-mediated secretion of micronemes and prevented attachment and invasion of host cells. Together, these results imply that xestospongin C inhibits microneme secretion by modulating a T. gondii[Ca2+] i release channel that responds to IP3. These findings suggest that the engagement of natural ligands during host cell invasion may also give rise to IP3 to promote the observed increases in [Ca2+] i in the parasite reported previously (10Carruthers V.B. Sibley L.D. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 31: 421-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar).The results of our studies using Ca2+ release channel agonists and antagonists strongly suggest that the protozoan parasiteT. gondii possess intracellular calcium release channels of the IP3/ryanodine superfamily. Relatively low concentrations of caffeine, ryanodine, and xestospongin C affected microneme release, indicating that protozoa may be unusually sensitive to these agents that affect calcium channels. While we cannot rule out secondary effects on other pathways, the primary response observed to all these compounds is consistent with their acting on a calcium release channel. A model integrating our findings with a hypothetical signaling cascade is presented in Fig. 5. We show that ethanol increases IP3 production, a second messenger that could act to liberate the [Ca2+] i pool. We also show that ryanodine increases [Ca2+] i , suggesting it interacts directly with a putative [Ca2+] i release channel via a Ca2+-induced Ca2+ release mechanism. The calcium-dependent stimulation of microneme secretion by ryanodine, caffeine, or ethanol was thapsigargin-insensitive, indicating that this unique pool may be responsible for calcium signaling in parasites. During contact with host cells, it is likely that a similar cascade is triggered to release Ca2+ from an intracellular store and stimulate microneme secretion. A role for a putative parasite PLC in the conversion of phosphatidylinositol bisphosphate to IP3 and diacylglycerol is suggested by the available data but has not yet been directly demonstrated. The responsiveness to both IP3 and ryanodine suggests that calcium release channels may exist as two separate entities. However, we have not excluded the intriguing possibility that protozoa possess a single ancient channel displaying hybrid properties of both. Analysis of calcium channels in protozoa will be illuminating to studies of the function and evolution of eukaryotic calcium signaling proteins. Apicomplexans are unicellular parasites that must enter cells to replicate. Members of this phylum share a common vulnerability when the process of invasion is compromised, yet diseases caused by apicomplexans remain among the most difficult to cure. The invasion process is rapid and marked by the sequential secretion of parasite organelles. Micronemes, rhoptries, and dense granule contents are released by invading parasites and participate in attachment, vacuole formation, and intracellular survival (1Carruthers V.B. Sibley L.D. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 73: 114-123PubMed Google Scholar). Understanding the mechanisms regulating parasite secretion could thus be useful in the design of new therapeutic strategies aimed at blocking invasion. Micronemes are the first secretory organelles to be discharged duringToxoplasma gondii invasion. Microneme proteins possess a variety of adhesive domains and include soluble and transmembrane forms (2Tomley F.M. Soldati D.S. Trends Parasitol. 2001; 17: 81-88Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 3Soldati D. Dubremetz J.F. Lebrun M. Int. J. Parasitol. 2001; 31: 1293-1302Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Their release appears highly regulated in that host cell contact triggers a burst of microneme release (1Carruthers V.B. Sibley L.D. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 73: 114-123PubMed Google Scholar). Binding studies suggest that microneme proteins participate in attachment to host cell surfaces (4Garcia-Réguet N. Lebrun M.

Previous studies demonstrated that increases in intracellular calcium ([Ca2+] i ) mediate microneme secretion in T. gondii. For example, association of T. gondii tachyzoites with host cells results in increases in parasite [Ca2+] i (8Vieira M.C. Moreno S.N. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2000; 106: 157-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) and chelation of T. gondii [Ca2+] i blocks microneme secretion and invasion (9Carruthers V.B. Giddings O.K. Sibley L.D. Cell. Microbiol. 1999; 1: 225-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). Moreover, reagents that raise T. gondii [Ca2+] i levels stimulate microneme discharge in the absence of host cells (10Carruthers V.B. Sibley L.D. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 31: 421-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). These include Ca2+ ionophores ionomycin and A23187, as well as the sarco-endoplasmic reticulum ATPase inhibitor thapsigargin (10Carruthers V.B. Sibley L.D. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 31: 421-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). Identification of alcohols as potent artificial triggers of microneme secretion led to studies demonstrating that ethanol also raises parasite [Ca2+] i levels (11Carruthers V.B. Moreno S.N.J. Sibley L.D. Biochem. J. 1999; 342: 379-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar).T. gondii possess several intracellular stores of Ca2+, including the acidocalcisomes (12Moreno S.N.J. Zhong L. Biochem. J. 1996; 313: 655-659Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar), mitochondria, and the endoplasmic reticulum (13Pingret L. Millot J.M. Sharonov S. Bonhomme A. Manfait M. Pinon J.M. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1996; 44: 1123-1129Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Whether all or some of these stores participate in microneme secretion during host cell invasion is unknown. The mechanism of Ca2+-mediated microneme release in both artificially triggered and natural microneme secretion during invasion remains largely undefined. Regulated exocytosis is associated with fluxes in [Ca2+] i , although the exact step requiring Ca2+ is unclear and may depend on the system being studied (14Brunger A.T. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2000; 10: 293-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Ca2+ signaling involves the mobilization of Ca2+ from two sources: intracellular stores and the extracellular medium. In mammalian cells, the sarco-endoplasmic reticulum is a commonly utilized source of readily accessible [Ca2+] i , which can be rapidly mobilized under a variety of stimuli. Two types of sarco-endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ release channels have been identified in multicellular animals: the IP31 receptor and the ryanodine receptor, which are structurally similar and a"

Accessibility of ligand to receptor, is therefore, an important facet of biological regulation. Receptor expression on the cell surface is dictated, at least in part, by vesicle trafficking via regulation of receptor internalization. Receptor internalization (also termed endocytosis) is implicated in receptor resensitization, down-regulation, and more recently signal transduction (1Pierce K.L. Lefkowitz R.J. Nature Rev. Neurosci. 2001; 2: 727-733Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar, 2Ceresa B.P. Schmid S.L. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 204-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). Endocytosis of G protein-coupled receptors and receptor tyrosine kinases is dependent on the invagination, constriction, and fission of vesicles (clathrin-coated and caveolae) from the plasma membrane into the cytosol. Dynamin, a large GTPase, plays a crucial role in these steps of receptor-mediated endocytosis (3Hinshaw J.E. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2000; 16: 483-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (580) Google Scholar, 4Sever S. Damke H. Schmid S.L. Traffic. 2000; 1: 385-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar).The GTPase activity of dynamin is stimulated 5–10-fold over basal levels by self-assembly (5Warnock D.E. Hinshaw J.E. Schmid S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 64-68Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (205) Google Scholar). In the native state, dynamin exists as a homotetramer (6Muhlberg A.B. Warnock D.E. Schmid S.L. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6676-6683Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). At low ionic strength conditions (7Hinshaw J.E. Schmid S.L. Nature. 1995; 374: 190-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (654) Google Scholar), or in the presence of GDP and γ-phosphate analogues at physiological salt conditions (8Carr J.F. Hinshaw J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28030-28035Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), concentrated dynamin tetramers spontaneously self-assemble into spiral stacks of rings, similar to the structure which appears as an electron dense “collar” around the necks of endocytic pits observed at synaptic nerve terminals (9Kosaka T.

Nature. 1995; 374: 186-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (650) Google Scholar). Purified dynamin also assembles onto phospholipid liposomes to generate dynamin-coated helical tubes that constrict and vesiculate upon GTP addition (11Sweitzer S.M. Hinshaw J.E.

On the other hand, dynamin-decorated phospholipid nanotubes undergo nucleotide-dependent conformational changes causing extension in pitch along the dynamin helix without constriction or fragmentation (13Stowell M.H.B.

Nature. 2001; 410: 231-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar).Recently, the GTPase effector domain of dynamin was shown to play a role in self-assembly and subsequent increase in GTPase activity (6Muhlberg A.B.

Nature. 1999; 398: 481-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). The GTPase effector domain has an intrinsic GTPase activating protein activity and interacts with the N-terminal GTPase domain to stimulate GTP hydrolysis. Although the molecular details governing the action of dynamin in the fission of vesicles from the plasma membrane have been controversial, it is, nonetheless, clear that GTP binding and hydrolysis play critical roles (3Hinshaw J.E.

Furthermore, inhibition of the non-receptor tyrosine kinase c-Src attenuates stem cell factor-induced c-Kit internalization in hematopoietic cells (18Broudy V.C. Lin N.L. Liles C. Corey S.J. O'Laughlin B. Mou S. Linnekin D. Blood. 1999; 94: 1979-1986PubMed Google Scholar), antibody-induced internalization of neural cell adhesion molecule L1 in neuroblastoma cells (19Schmid R-S.

Brodsky F.M. Cell. 1999; 96: 677-687Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). Conversely, overexpression of c-Src causes an increase in EGFR internalization rate following EGF treatment (21Ware M.F. Tice D.A. Parsons S.J. Lauffenburger D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30185-30190Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar).Some components of the cellular endocytic machinery have been shown to undergo regulated tyrosine phosphorylation. In the case of EGFR internalization, one such target is clathrin. Stimulation with EGF increases c-Src-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation of clathrin, which regulates clathrin translocation to the plasma membrane (20Wilde A. Beattie E.C. Lem L. Riethof D.A. Liu S-H.

Another target is dynamin, which can directly interact with c-Src (22Foster-Barber A. Bishop J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The c-Src-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation of dynamin is required for agonist-induced endocytosis of β2-adrenergic (25Ahn S. Maudsley S. Luttrell L.M. Lefkowitz R.J. Daaka Y. J. Biol.

However, unlike clathrin, the mechanisms whereby phosphorylation of dynamin regulates receptor-mediated endocytosis are unclear.

Nature. 1999; 398: 481-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar) to recruit downstream effectors, which mediate the fission step. Regardless of which model is correct, it is an indisputable fact that control of dynamin GTPase activity is the key for endocytic vesicle formation (3Hinshaw J.E. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev.

Similarly, it is well established that dynamin self-assembles to form spiral structures on the neck of invaginated pits during endocytosis (9Kosaka T. Ikeda K. J.

Although a certain conformation of GTP-bound dynamin was proposed to favor self-assembly (8Carr J.F. Hinshaw J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28030-28035Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), regulatory mechanisms inducing and stabilizing the assembled dynamin structures remain unclear. The present data show that c-Src-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation promotes significant increases in dynamin self-assembly into helically interconnected rings and also stimulates the rate of GTP hydrolysis, both of which are hallmarks for dynamin execution of vesicle budding from the plasma membrane.Agonist stimulation triggers recruitment of c-Src and dynamin into the vicinity of activated receptor on the plasma membrane. Some receptors, such as EGFR (34Tice D.A. Biscardi J.S. Nickles A.L. Parsons S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 1415-1420Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar) and β3-AR (35Cao W. Luttrell L.M. Madvedev A.V. Pierce K.L. Daniel K.W. Dixon T.M. Lefkowitz R.J. Collins S. J. Biol.

Miller W.E. Maudsley S. Della Rocca G.J. Lin F.-T. Kawakatsu H. Owada K. Luttrell D.K. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Science. 1999; 283: 655-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (1250) Google Scholar), form complexes with c-Src via bridging adapter proteins. Dynamin translocates to the plasma membrane by direct interaction with phospholipids (37Salim K. Bottomlet M.J. Querfurth E. Zvelebil M.J. Gout I. Scaife R. Margolis R.L. Gigg R. Smith C.I.E. Driscoll P.C. Waterfield M.D. Panayotou G. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6241-6250Crossref PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar) and adapter proteins, such as amphyphisin (3Hinshaw J.E. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2000; 16: 483-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (580) Google Scholar, 38Schmid S.L. McNiven M.A. De Camilli P. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 504-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar). Once in close proximity to each other on the plasma membrane, c-Src phosphorylates dynamin. In support of this hypothesis is our finding that K44A dynamin, which is competent to translocate to invaginated pits on the plasma membrane following receptor activation, but which does not recycle to the cytosol because of its impaired ability to bind and hydrolyze GTP (32Damke H. Baba T. Warnock D.E. Schmid S.L. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 915-934Crossref PubMed Scopus (1034) Google Scholar, 33Damke H. Binns D.D. Ueda H. Schmid S.L. Baba T. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 2578-2589Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar), displays a significant increase in tyrosine phosphorylation compared with wild type dynamin (Fig. 1 A). Furthermore, disruption of c-Src recruitment to activated β2-AR inhibits tyrosine phosphorylation of dynamin (39Miller W.E. Mausdsley S. Ahn S. Khan K-D. Luttrell L.M. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11312-11319Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). These data suggest that dephosphorylation of dynamin occurs in the cytosol following GTP hydrolysis-induced disassembly.Phosphoamino acid analysis of in vitro c-Src-phosphorylated dynamin revealed two tyrosine residues, Tyr354 and Tyr597, to be phosphorylated (Fig. 3 C). However,in vivo analysis shows that Tyr597, but not Tyr354, becomes phosphorylated in response to EGF stimulation. Furthermore, phosphorylation of dynamin on Tyr597, but not Tyr354, appears to be required for EGF-induced EGFR internalization (Fig. 4). Tyr597 in dynamin also needs to be phosphorylated to mediate β2-AR internalization (25Ahn S. Maudsley S. Luttrell L.M. Lefkowitz R.J. Daaka Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1185-1188Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar) and expression of Y231F/Y597F dynamin inhibits M1 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor internalization (26Werbonat Y. Kleutges N. Jakobs K.H. van Koppen C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21969-21974Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Replacement of Tyr597 with Phe reduces the tyrosine phosphorylation-induced GTPase activity (Fig. 5 B) and self-assembly of dynamin (Fig. 6 B), suggesting that phosphorylation of Tyr597 regulates dynamin function in endocytosis of ligand-activated receptors by controlling self-assembly and subsequent GTP hydrolysis.Does tyrosine phosphorylation of dynamin play a role in clathrin-mediated endocytosis of constitutively recycling nutrient receptors, similar to ligand-induced internalization of signaling receptors? Vallis et al. (40Vallis Y. Wigge P. Marks B. Evans P.R. McMahon H.T. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 257-260Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar) showed that expression of bovine Y596F mutant dynamin I has no effect on transferrin uptake, suggesting that phosphorylation of Tyr596, which corresponds to the Tyr597 residue of rat dynamin I, is not required for constitutive endocytosis of nutrient receptors. It is possible that the function of dynamin is regulated differently for constitutive endocytosis of nutrient receptors, in the absence of tyrosine phosphorylation. In support of this hypothesis, the existence of two functionally and biochemically distinct subpopulations of clathrin-coated pits that mediate agonist-regulated internalization of the β2-AR and constitutive endocytosis of the transferrin receptor has been demonstrated (41Cao T.T. Mays R.W. von Zastrow M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24592-24602Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Alternatively, the tyrosine phosphorylation-induced assembled structure of dynamin may have an unidentified specific role for endocytosis of activated signaling receptors, which is not required for constitutive endocytosis of recycling receptors. In the case of EGFR endocytosis, one possibility is that tyrosine phosphorylation-induced dynamin self-assembly leads to recruitment of the ligand-activated receptor to the endocytic machinery. It has been suggested that biochemical differences between EGF and transferrin uptake mostly reflect specific requirements for the recruitment of the EGFR to coated pits (42Lameze C. Baba T. Redelmeier T.E. Schmid S.L. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1993; 4: 715-727Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). We also cannot exclude the possibility that the effect of Y597F dynamin on EGFR endocytosis may be indirect, such as by interfering with receptor activation, because expression of K44A dynamin was shown to alter high affinity binding of EGF to the receptor (43Ringerike T. Stang E. Johannessen L.E. Sandness D. Levy F.O. Madshus I.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16639-16642Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Currently, however, what determines this specificity of tyrosine phosphorylation-regulated function of dynamin in signaling receptor internalization is not known.How does tyrosine phosphorylation induce dynamin self-assembly? It is well established that phosphotyrosine residues primarily serve as docking sites for proteins containing Src homology (SH) 2 or phosphotyrosine-binding domains (44Hunter T. Cell. 2000; 100: 113-127Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2242) Google Scholar, 45Hubbard S.R. Till J.H. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 373-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (874) Google Scholar). Indeed, some dynamin-binding proteins stimulate the GTPase activity of dynamin (3Hinshaw J.E. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2000; 16: 483-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (580) Google Scholar, 38Schmid S.L. McNiven M.A. De Camilli P. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 504-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar). However, ourin vitro results using purified dynamin show that tyrosine phosphorylation per se increases the GTPase activity of dynamin. Additionally, dynamin itself does not contain SH2 or phosphotyrosine-binding domains, indicating a lack of potential intramolecular SH2 or phosphotyrosine-binding domain-mediated interactions in tyrosine-phosphorylated dynamin. Several lines of evidence have suggested that tyrosine phosphorylation of proteins may stimulate their enzymatic activity by inducing a local conformational change rather than by creating binding sites for other partners. For example, most protein-tyrosine kinases, including receptor tyrosine kinases and non-receptor tyrosine kinases such as Src, are activated by phosphorylation of tyrosine residues in the activation loop (45Hubbard S.R. Till J.H. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 373-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (874) Google Scholar). The SH2 domain-containing tyrosine phosphatase SHP-2 is tyrosine-phosphorylated in growth factor-stimulated cells, which leads to its activation (46Vogel W. Lammers R. Huang J. Ullrich A. Science. 1993; 259: 1611-1614Crossref PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar). Furthermore, it has been reported that c-Src phosphorylates the Gαs, Gαi, Gαo, and Gαq/11 GTPases (47Hausdorff W.P. Pitcher J.A. Luttrell D.K. Linder M.E. Kurose H. Parsons S.J. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5720-5724Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 48Umemori H. Inoue T. Kume S. Sekiyama N. Nagao M. Itosh H. Nakanishi S. Mikoshiba K. Yamamoto T. Science. 1997; 276: 1878-1881Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Inin vitro reconstitution assays, tyrosine-phosphorylated Gαs shows an increased rate of binding to GTPγS as well as an increased rate of receptor-stimulated GTP hydrolysis (47Hausdorff W.P. Pitcher J.A. Luttrell D.K. Linder M.E. Kurose H. Parsons S.J. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5720-5724Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Together, the present results suggest the possibility that tyrosine phosphorylation may induce a conformational change of dynamin, which favors self-assembly.Tyr597 is well conserved among dynamin isoforms and resides in the PH domain. This domain is required for endocytosis (49Artalejo C.R. Lemmon M.A. Schlessinger J. Palfrey H.C. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1565-1574Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 50Achiriloaie M. Barylko B. Albanesi J.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1410-1415Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar), presumably to recruit dynamin to the plasma membrane via binding to phospholipids (37Salim K. Bottomlet M.J. Querfurth E. Zvelebil M.J. Gout I. Scaife R. Margolis R.L. Gigg R. Smith C.I.E. Driscoll P.C. Waterfield M.D. Panayotou G. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6241-6250Crossref PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar). The contribution of the PH domain to dynamin self-assembly is not clear. In vitro, the PH domain was shown either not to participate (51Okamoto P.M. Tripet B. Litowski J. Hodges R.S. Vallee R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10277-10286Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 52Smirnova E. Shurland D-L. Newman-Smith E.D. Pishvaee B. van der Bliek A.M. J. Biol.

EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6676-6683Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar, 53Scaife R. Venien-Bryan C. Margolis R.L. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 17673-17679Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) of dynamin-dynamin interaction. However, it is not clear whether the dynamin proteins used in these studies were tyrosine phosphorylated. Interaction of the PH domain phosphorylated on Tyr597 with other domains of dynamin remains to be determined. On the other hand, whereas phosphorylation of Tyr354 in dynamin appears to be physiologically irrelevant, at least with regard to EGFR endocytosis, the in vitroresults demonstrate that phosphorylation of this residue exerts a positive effect on dynamin self-assembly and GTPase activity. Thus, it will be of interest to test whether phosphorylation of Tyr354 alters other functions of dynamin, such as rapid endocytosis of synaptic vesicles in nerve terminals (3Hinshaw J.E. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2000; 16: 483-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (580) Google Scholar, 38Schmid S.L. McNiven M.A. De Camilli P. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 504-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar), because the Tyr354 residue is exclusively found in neuronal dynamin I.In addition to being phosphorylated on tyrosine residues, neuronal dynamin I is also phosphorylated on a serine residue by protein kinase C in intact synaptosomes (54Robinson P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21637-21644Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In vitro, protein kinase C-mediated phosphorylation stimulates dynamin I GTPase activity (55Robinson P.J. Sontag J-M. Liu J-P. Fykse E-M. Slaughter C. McMahon H.T. Südhof T.C. Nature. 1993; 365: 163-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar), and increases binding to calcium (56Liu J-P. Zhang Q-X. Baldwin G. Robinson P.J. J. Neurochem. 1996; 66: 2074-2081Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), but blocks binding to phospholipids (57Powell K.A. Valova V.A. Malladi C.S. Jensen O.N. Larsen M.R. Robinson P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11610-11617Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Upon synaptic membrane depolarization, serine-phosphorylated dynamin I was dephosphorylated by the calcium-dependent phosphatase calcineurin (58Liu J-P. Sim A.T.R. Robinson P.J. Science. 1994; 265: 970-973Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar), which was required for endocytosis in nerve terminals (59Marks B. McMahon H.T. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 740-749Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). Calcineurin-mediated dephosphorylation restores the ability of dynamin to bind phospholipids (57Powell K.A. Valova V.A. Malladi C.S. Jensen O.N. Larsen M.R. Robinson P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11610-11617Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) and inhibits its GTPase activity (58Liu J-P. Sim A.T.R. Robinson P.J. Science. 1994; 265: 970-973Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar) in vitro. Thus, it will be of interest to examine the relationship between tyrosine and serine phosphorylation of dynamin I in nerve terminals and their impact on endocytosis.The effect of GTP binding on dynamin self-assembly is not entirely clear. In vitro, addition of GDP with γ-phosphate analogues induces dynamin self-assembly to generate spiral stacks (8Carr J.F. Hinshaw J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28030-28035Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), and treatment of isolated nerve terminals with GTPγS promotes tubular membrane invaginations decorated with electron-dense dynamin rings (10Takei K. McPherson P.S. Schmid S.L. De Camilli P. Nature. 1995; 374: 186-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (650) Google Scholar). However, the binding of guanine nucleotides GTPγS, GTP, or GDP destabilizes assembled dynamin structures (5Warnock D.E. Hinshaw J.E. Schmid S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 64-68Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (205) Google Scholar), and GTP binding-impaired K44A dynamin self-assembles, like wild type protein under low ionic strength conditions (5Warnock D.E. Hinshaw J.E. Schmid S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 64-68Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Our data show that tyrosine phosphorylation controls dynamin self-assembly (Fig. 6) even in the absence of guanine nucleotides (Fig. 7). Furthermore, stimulation with EGF promotes tyrosine phosphorylation of GTP binding-deficient K44A dynamin (Fig.1), suggesting that nucleotide binding was not required for tyrosine phosphorylation. It is not clear at this juncture whether c-Src-regulated tyrosine phosphorylation exerts any effect on the affinity of dynamin to bind these nucleotides. Dynamin can also generate helically assembled structures around phospholipid liposomes (11Sweitzer S.M. Hinshaw J.E. Cell. 1998; 93: 1021-1029Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (542) Google Scholar, 12Zhang P. Hinshaw J.E. Nat.

Nature. 2001; 410: 231-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar) in vitro, which were shown to undergo conformational changes in a nucleotide-dependent manner (11Sweitzer S.M. Hinshaw J.E.

Nature. 2001; 410: 231-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the recently resolved crystal structure of the dynamin GTPase domain (60Niemann H.H. Knetsch M.L.W. Scherer A. Manstein D.J. Kull F.J. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5813-5821Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) and three-dimensional reconstruction of dynamin in the constricted state (12Zhang P. Hinshaw J.E. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 922-926Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar) provides additional evidence for the requirement of dynamin self-assembly and conformational change in endocytic vesicle formation. Thus, it remains to be determined how tyrosine phosphorylation collaborates with the guanine nucleotide in the context of dynamin self-assembly and conformational change.Together, our results establish the novel paradigm that post-translational tyrosine phosphorylation of dynamin serves as a regulator of dynamin function in endocytosis of signaling receptors via control of self-assembly. Furthermore, the agonist-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of dynamin provides a mechanism by which tyrosine kinase receptors regulate their own accessibility to external stimulation and, as a"

Nicotinic acid specifically labeled on carbon 5 was synthesized and used in the growth medium as a precursor of pyridine nucleotides to allow for in vivo detection of13C-labeled NAD+ and NADH. The capacity ofL. lactis MG1363 to regenerate NAD+ was manipulated either by turning on NADH oxidase activity or by knocking out the gene encoding lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). An LDH−deficient strain was constructed by double crossover. Upon supply of glucose, NAD+ was constant and maximal (∼5 mm) in the parent strain (MG1363) but decreased abruptly in the LDH− strain both under aerobic and anaerobic conditions. NADH in MG1363 was always below the detection limit as long as glucose was available. The rate of glucose consumption under anaerobic conditions was 7-fold lower in the LDH− strain and NADH reached high levels (2.5 mm), reflecting severe limitation in regenerating NAD+. However, under aerobic conditions the glycolytic flux was nearly as high as in MG1363 despite the accumulation of NADH up to 1.5 mm. Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase was able to support a high flux even in the presence of NADH concentrations much higher than those of the parent strain. We interpret the data as showing that the glycolytic flux in wild type L. lactis is not primarily controlled at the level of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase by NADH. The ATP/ADP/Pi content could play an important role.

The relative simplicity of L. lactis metabolism that converts sugars via the glycolytic pathway to pyruvate, generating energy mainly through substrate level phosphorylation, makes it an attractive model organism to test metabolic engineering strategies. Moreover, the large number of genetic tools available for L. lactis (1de Vos W.M. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 1999; 2: 289-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar) and the recent release of the complete genome sequence are additional incentives to study the physiology of this organism in great depth (2Bolotin A. Wincker P. Mauger S. Jaillon O. Malarme K. Weissenbach J. Ehrlich S.D. Sorokin A. Genome Res. 2001; 11: 731-753Crossref PubMed Scopus (970) Google Scholar). Despite numerous studies, a satisfactory answer to the question, What controls the glycolytic flux in L. lactis? has not been put forward. During homolactic fermentation, regulation of the carbon flux has been associated with high levels of fructose 1,6-bisphosphate (FBP),1 which activates lactate dehydrogenase (LDH; EC 1.1.1.27) and pyruvate kinase (PK; EC2.7.1.40), directing the flux toward the production of lactate (3Cocaign-Bousquet M. Garrigues C. Loubiere P. Lindley N.D. Antonie Van Leeuwenhoek. 1996; 70: 253-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). A metabolic shift from homolactic (lactate production) to mixed acid fermentation (ethanol, acetate, and formate production) was observed in glucose-limited chemostat cultures (4Thomas T.D. Ellwood D.C. Longyear V.M. J. Bacteriol. 1979; 138: 109-117Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A deviation from homolactic fermentation was also reported under aerobic conditions (5Condon S. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 1987; 46: 269-280Crossref Google Scholar) or during the metabolism of galactose (6Thomas T.D. J. Bacteriol. 1976; 125: 1240-1242Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The formation of end products other than lactate in glucose-limited cultures was rationalized as being due to the reduction of LDH activity caused by lower levels of the effector, FBP, and to the relief of pyruvate formate lyase inhibition by the concomitant decrease of dihydroxyacetone phosphate and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate; on the other hand, the oxygen-induced metabolic shift would be explained by activation of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex under aerobic conditions (3Cocaign-Bousquet M.

Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 5282-5287Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar) downplayed the role of FBP, proposing that control of glycolysis was dependent on modulation of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH; EC 1.2.1.12) by NADH/NAD+ (7Garrigues C. Loubiere P. Lindley N.D. Cocaign-Bousquet M. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 5282-5287Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar), and earlier work based on inhibitor titrations also suggests GAPDH as a major site for glycolytic control (8Poolman B. Bosman B. Kiers J. Konings W.N. J. Bacteriol. 1987; 169: 5887-5890Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). L. lactis shows a remarkable versatility in regard to metabolic routes used to regenerate NAD+, a crucial process in this typical fermentative organism. The presence of NADH oxidase activity enables this organism to utilize oxygen, when available in the environment, as an acceptor for the reducing power in NADH, inducing a shift of the carbon flux to the production of acetate and acetoin (9Lopez de Felipe F. Kleerebezem M. de Vos W.M. Hugenholtz J. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 3804-3808Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). On the other hand, mutants with disruption of LDH, the main catalytic site for NAD+ regeneration, produced mannitol or ethanol as alternatives to lactate (10Neves A.R. Ramos A. Shearman C. Gasson M.J. Almeida J.S. Santos H. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 3859-3868Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 11Hols P. Ramos A. Hugenholtz J. Delcour J. de Vos W.M. Santos H. Kleerebezem M. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 5521-5526Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The ubiquitous role of pyridine nucleotides in the energy-transforming and redox reactions and their potential involvement in regulation of carbon fluxes has demanded the determination of the intracellular levels of NAD+ and NADH. However, reliable data on intracellular pools of NAD+ and NADH are hard to obtain. Most studies rely on analysis of cell extracts, which may not represent the composition of living cells in a specific metabolic state due to compound instability and/or unsatisfactory quenching of metabolism. NADH and NAD+ are acid and alkali labile, respectively, and we found that NADH was not fully stable under ethanol extraction conditions. Therefore, measurement of both oxidized and reduced forms requires that extraction be carried out in separate samples, with consequent impairment of reproducibility. These are probably the most important factors responsible for the discrepancies found in the literature for NAD+ and NADH concentrations in L. lactis (12Garrigues C. Goupil-Feuillerat N.

Firth A. J. Bacteriol. 1972; 111: 24-32Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, the development of techniques for monitoring these pools in a non-invasive way is mandatory. The fluorescence of NAD(P)H has been used for the characterization of intracellular pyridine nucleotide metabolism (22Harrison D.E. Chance B. Appl. Microbiol. 1970; 19: 446-450Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), but this methodology has the disadvantage of detecting the reduced forms only, and data obtained with this technique in whole cells should be regarded as qualitative rather than quantitative (Ref.23London R.E. Prog. Nucl. Magn. Reson. Spectrosc. 1988; 20: 337-383Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (123) Google Scholar and references therein). In vivo 13C NMR was used by Unkefer et al. to follow pyridine nucleotide metabolism in Escherichia coli and yeast cells (24Unkefer C.J. Blazer R.M. London R.E. Science. 1983; 222: 62-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). The ability of this method to monitor both the reduced and oxidized pools non-invasively allied to the concomitant observation of intracellular metabolites derived from13C substrates is expected to provide a more comprehensive and reliable insight into cell metabolism. In this study, we used this methodology to monitor the kinetics of the intracellular pools of NAD+, NADH, and several metabolic intermediates in the living cells of L. lactis without interfering with the cellular processes. Manipulation of the cell capacity to regenerate NAD+ was achieved either by turning on NADH oxidase activity (switching from anaerobic to aerobic conditions) or by knocking out the gene encoding lactate dehydrogenase, the main site for NADH oxidation in this organism. Regulation of glycolysis in L. lactis is discussed in the light of these in vivomeasurements. L. lactis MG1363 (parent strain) and FI9630, harboring anldh gene deletion, hereafter denoted as LDH−strain, were grown at 30 °C in a 2-liter vessel (B. Braun Biostat® MD) in the chemical-defined medium described by Poolman and Konings (25Poolman B. Konings W.N. J. Bacteriol. 1988; 170: 700-707Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) modified as follows. Aspartate and asparagine were omitted, and nicotinic acid (1 mg/liter) was replaced by [5-13C]nicotinic acid (5 mg/liter). Glucose was added to a final concentration of 1% (w/v), and the pH was kept at 6.5 by automatic addition of 10 n NaOH. Anaerobiosis was attained by flushing sterile argon through the medium in the fermenter for 1 h preceding inoculation. Dissolved oxygen was monitored with an oxygen electrode (Ingold). A specific air tension of 90% was maintained by automatic control of the airflow during aerobic growth. An L. lactis LDH-deficient strain was constructed by double crossover to ensure full stability of the gene knock-out and to avoid antibiotic selection. The pOri/pVE6007 two-plasmid system (26Leenhouts K. Buist G. Bolhuis A. ten Berge A. Kiel J. Mierau I. Dabrowska M. Venema G. Kok J. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1996; 253: 217-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar) was used to generate a food grade deletion of the ldh gene in MG1363. The upstream flanking fragment was cloned from pFI2320 as a 1.24-kb EcoRI-DraI fragment (equivalent to 1785–3025 bp; accession number L07920 (27Llanos R.M. Hillier A.J. Davidson B.E. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 6956-6964Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)). This fragment was cloned into pOri280 cut with EcoRI andSmaI to give pFI2277. The DNA sequence downstream of theldh gene was determined from pFI516 (28Griffin H.G. Swindell S.R. Gasson M.J. Gene. 1992; 122: 193-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) and used to design primers ldh3 (5′-CCGTCAGCCCGCGGCGCAATTGC-3′) and ldh4 (5′-GCAATCAAAGCTTCAGAAGCC-3′). These primers amplified the 950-bp downstream fragment, which was cloned into pCR2.1TOPO (Invitrogen) to give pFI2323. pFI2277 was cut with BglII, and the 1.98-kb BamHI-BglII fragment from pFI2323 was inserted. The orientation of the upstream and downstreamldh fragments was confirmed by PCR analysis and sequencing across the junction. This construct, named pFI2278, was electroporated into FI8645 (MG1363 pVE6007) to give FI9619. This strain was taken through the temperature shift protocol for single and double crossovers (26Leenhouts K. Buist G. Bolhuis A. ten Berge A. Kiel J. Mierau I. Dabrowska M. Venema G. Kok J. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1996; 253: 217-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar), giving FI9620 and FI9630, respectively. FI9630 was confirmed as a Δldh strain by PCR analysis, Southern blotting, and sequencing of the PCR product amplified across the deletion junction. The stability of the LDH deletion was assessed as described previously (10Neves A.R. Ramos A. Shearman C. Gasson M.J. Almeida J.S. Santos H. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 3859-3868Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). [5-13C]Nicotinic acid was synthesized starting from [1,3-13C]acetone (Cambridge Isotope Laboratories, MA) and o-aminobenzaldehyde. A modification of the method previously used to prepare [6-13C]nicotinamide was followed (29Bryson T.A. Wisowaty J.C. Dunlap R.B. Fisher R.R. Ellis P.D. J. Org. Chem. 1974; 39: 1158-1160Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Base-catalyzed condensation ofo-aminobenzaldehyde and [1,3-13C2]acetone afforded labeled quinaldine in 90% yield. Bromination was carried out as described in Vogel (30Vogel A.I. Vogel's Textbook of Practical Organic Chemistry. 5th Ed. Longman Scientific and Technical, Essex, England1989: 1062Google Scholar), also in high yield (96%), to produce tribromoquinaldine. The alternative method for this bromination (29Bryson T.A. Wisowaty J.C. Dunlap R.B. Fisher R.R. Ellis P.D. J. Org. Chem. 1974; 39: 1158-1160Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar) was not satisfactory in our hands. Hydrolysis of the tribromomethyl group was performed by heating in sulfuric acid until no more bromine vapors were observed. Oxidative degradation of the resulting acid with nitric acid had to be carried out under very careful control in a temperature-controlled oil bath. Heating below 260 °C resulted in the formation of several products, and heating even marginally above this temperature resulted in the formation of several products or the complete carbonization of the product. The acidic residue from this reaction was heated in the presence of methanol and trimethylorthoformate for 18 h to give the required diester in 75% yield for the two steps. Selective hydrolysis of the 2-carboxylate was carried out by refluxing the diester in a solution of potassium hydroxide (1.01 eq.) in methanol. The monoacid (80% yield) formed on acidifying was then decarboxylated by heating to reflux in anisole for 6 h. Without purification, the methyl ester was hydrolyzed by potassium hydroxide in water to yield nicotinic acid, which was extracted from the acidified aqueous phase continuously with dichloromethane. At least two extractions of up to a week were found necessary for optimum yields. Pure nicotinic acid was obtained in 90% overall yield from the monoacid. The overall yield for the entire process was 47%. Cells were harvested in mid-logarithmic growth phase (A 600 = 2.2), centrifuged, washed twice, and suspended to a protein concentration of 16.5 mg/ml in 50 mm KPi or Mes/KOH buffer, pH 6.5, for13C or 31P NMR experiments, respectively. To determine whether the metabolism was affected by the presence or absence of phosphate in the buffer, experiments using PIPES for13C NMR were also run. No changes in the dynamics and levels of intracellular metabolites, namely FBP, phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP), and 3-phosphoglycerate (3-PGA) were observed when PIPES instead of KPi was used (data not shown). Anaerobic experiments were performed as described before (31Neves A.R. Ramos A. Nunes M.C. Kleerebezem M. Hugenholtz J. de Vos W.M. Almeida J. Santos H. Biotechnol. Bioeng. 1999; 64: 200-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). For experiments under O2 atmosphere, a micro pO2 probe (Lazar Research Laboratories, Inc.) was included in the experimental set-up previously described (31Neves A.R. Ramos A. Nunes M.C. Kleerebezem M. Hugenholtz J. de Vos W.M. Almeida J. Santos H. Biotechnol. Bioeng. 1999; 64: 200-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). To ensure an adequate level of oxygenation, an air-lift system (32Santos H. Turner D.L. J. Magn. Reson. 1986; 68: 345-349Google Scholar) with pure oxygen was used inside the NMR tube, and in addition, pure oxygen was continuously bubbled through the cell suspension in the bioreactor. Spectra were acquired sequentially before and after addition of [1-13C]glucose (40 or 80 mm). After glucose exhaustion and when no changes in the resonances due to end products and intracellular metabolites were observed, an aliquot of the cell suspension was passed through a French press; the resulting cell extract was incubated at 80 °C (10 min) in a stoppered tube, cooled down on ice, and cell debris and denatured macromolecules were removed by centrifugation. The supernatant, designated herein as NMR sample extract, was used for quantification of end products and minor metabolites as previously described (10Neves A.R. Ramos A. Shearman C. Gasson M.J. Almeida J.S. Santos H. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 3859-3868Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Although individual experiments are illustrated in each figure, each type of in vivo NMR experiment was repeated at least twice, and the results were highly reproducible. The values reported are averages of 2–4 experiments, and the accuracy varied from 2% (end products) to 15% in the case of intracellular metabolites with concentrations below 5 mm. A cell suspension ofL. lactis MG1363 grown under anaerobiosis was prepared as described for in vivo NMR, except that ∼1 g of cells was suspended in a volume of 60 ml in ultrapure water. The suspension was transferred to 1.2 liters of cold ethanol 70% (v/v) and extracted as described by Ramos et al. (33Ramos A. Boels I.C. de Vos W.M. Santos H. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2001; 67: 33-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). During the extraction procedure, the pH was kept below 7.5 to avoid NAD+degradation. To substantiate the assignment to [5-13C]NAD+ of the resonance at 129.1 ppm observed in the 13C NMR spectrum of L. lactisbefore substrate addition, cell components present in the extract were separated by anion-exchange chromatography, the extract was loaded onto a QAE-Sephadex column equilibrated with 5 mm acetate buffer, pH 6.0, and the elution was performed with a linear gradient of 5 mm to 1 m acetate buffer, pH 6.0. Aliquots of each fraction were analyzed by 13C NMR, and fractions originating at the resonance at 129.1 ppm eluting between 0.5 and 0.6m acetate were pooled, lyophilized, and dissolved in2H2O. Assignment of [5-13C]NAD+ was performed by1H NMR and 13C NMR spectroscopy. The concentration of [5-13C]NAD+ was also measured in cell extracts by 1H NMR to provide a basis for comparison with in vivo determinations. Cell suspensions (anaerobic cultures) were prepared as described for NMR experiments, incubated at 30 °C for 15 min under an argon atmosphere, and extracted with ethanol as above. The lyophilized extracts were dissolved in 2H2O containing 5 mmEDTA; the concentration of [5-13C]NAD+ was determined by comparing the areas of its resonance in 1H- or 13C-relaxed spectra with the area of the resonance due to formate or [3-13C]lactate, added as internal standards for analysis by 1H NMR or 13C NMR, respectively. Lactate, acetoin, acetate, 2,3-butanediol, ethanol, and formate were quantified in NMR sample extracts by 1H NMR (10Neves A.R. Ramos A. Shearman C. Gasson M.J. Almeida J.S. Santos H. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 3859-3868Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). The concentration of minor products (e.g. pyruvate, ethanol, diacetyl) and metabolic intermediates that remained inside the cells (PEP, 3-PGA) was determined from the analysis of 13C spectra of NMR sample extracts as previously described (31Neves A.R. Ramos A. Nunes M.C. Kleerebezem M. Hugenholtz J. de Vos W.M. Almeida J. Santos H. Biotechnol. Bioeng. 1999; 64: 200-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). The concentration of labeled lactate determined by 1H NMR was used as a standard to calculate the concentration of the other metabolites in the sample, and the total amount of lactate was confirmed by enzymatic methods. Because of the fast pulsing conditions used for acquiring in vivo 13C spectra, correction factors have to be determined to convert peak intensities into concentrations. The correction factor for the C5 of NAD+ (0.64 ± 0.01) was determined as follows. A cell suspension was prepared as described above for 13C NMR experiments, 2.5 mm [3-13C]lactate was added, and circulation was started. In the absence of glucose, the intensity of the resonance due to C5 of NAD+ remained constant for a long period of time, enabling the acquisition of fully and partially relaxed spectra and the determination of correction factors. For the resonances due to C1 and C6 of FBP (0.48 ± 0.02), mannitol, and mannitol 1-phosphate (Mtl1P) (0.48 ± 0.01), the factors were determined from spectra of a perchloric acid extract, which was circulated through the NMR tube at a similar rate to that used for cell suspensions. Extracts were derived from suspensions of LDH− (Mtl1P and mannitol) or MG1363 cells (FBP) actively metabolizing [1-13C]glucose. The correction factors for the resonances due to C3 of 3-PGA and PEP (0.60 ± 0.02) were determined in a cell suspension ofL. lactis after the metabolism of [1-13C]glucose, since after glucose depletion the intracellular pools of these metabolites were stable. The quantitative kinetic data for intracellular metabolites were calculated from the areas of the relevant resonances by applying the correction factors and comparing with the intensity of the lactate resonance in the last spectrum of the sequence. For calculation of the correction factors13C NMR spectra were acquired with a 60° flip angle and a recycle delay of 0.3 s (saturating conditions) or 60.3 s (relaxed conditions). Average values derived from at least three independent experiments were used. The lower limit for in vivo NMR detection of NAD+ or NADH under these conditions was 0.5 mm. Intracellular metabolite concentrations were calculated using a value of 2.9 μl/mg protein for the intracellular volume of L. lactis (34Poolman B. Smid E.J. Veldkamp H. Konings W.N. J. Bacteriol. 1987; 169: 1460-1468Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). All NMR spectra of living cells were run at 30 °C with a quadruple-nucleus probe head on a Bruker DRX500 spectrometer. Acquisition of 31P NMR and 13C NMR spectra was performed as described by Neves et al. (31Neves A.R. Ramos A. Nunes M.C. Kleerebezem M. Hugenholtz J. de Vos W.M. Almeida J. Santos H. Biotechnol. Bioeng. 1999; 64: 200-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar); however, acquisition parameters for 13C NMR were modified as follows: data size, 16,000; recycle delay, 0.3 s; number of transients, 480. Carbon and phosphorus chemical shifts are referenced to the resonances of external methanol or H3PO4(85%) designated at 49.3 ppm and 0.0 ppm, respectively. All enzymes were assayed at 30 °C immediately after mechanical disruption of a cell suspension by passage through a French press (twice at 120 MPa) and centrifugation for 15 min at 30,000 × g to remove cell debris. The protein concentration was determined by the method of Bradford (35Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar).l-LDH was assayed as described by Garrigues et al. (7Garrigues C. Loubiere P. Lindley N.D. Cocaign-Bousquet M. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 5282-5287Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). GAPDH was assayed by the method of Even et al.(36Even S. Garrigues C. Loubiere P. Lindley N.D. Cocaign-Bousquet M. Metab. Eng. 1999; 1: 198-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). NADH oxidase activity was determined as described by Lopez de Felipe et al. (9Lopez de Felipe F. Kleerebezem M. de Vos W.M. Hugenholtz J. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 3804-3808Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Mtl1P dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.17), leading to the formation of Mtl1P, was measured using 0.3 mm NADH, and the reaction was initiated by the addition of 3 mm fructose 6-phosphate (10Neves A.R. Ramos A. Shearman C. Gasson M.J. Almeida J.S. Santos H. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 3859-3868Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). [1-13C]Glucose (99% enrichment) and [1,3-13C]acetone (99% enrichment) were obtained from Campro Scientific and Cambridge Isotope Laboratories, respectively. [3-13C]Lactate (99%) was supplied by A.R.C. Formic acid (sodium salt) was purchased from Merck. QAE-Sephadex A25 was obtained from Amersham Biosciences. All other chemicals were reagent grade. In most microbial systems NAD+ can be synthesized from aspartate (de novo pathway) or nicotinic acid (salvage pathway) (37Penfound T. Foster J.W. Escherichia coli and Salmonella: Cellular and Molecular Biology. 2nd Ed. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1996: 721-730Google Scholar). Because of the lack of information about the route of NAD+ synthesis in L. lactis, it was necessary to ascertain which precursor would achieve maximal labeling of the intracellular pool. Therefore, L. lactis was grown in chemical-defined medium without nicotinic acid or without aspartate and asparagine. In the absence of these amino acids, a slight decrease in the growth rate (μ) was observed: μ = 0.71 h−1 as compared with μ = 1.15 h−1 for the complete chemical-defined medium under anaerobiosis. No growth was detected when nicotinic acid was omitted. These data and the previous observation of the production of labeled aspartate from the metabolism of [1-13C]glucose (10Neves A.R. Ramos A. Shearman C. Gasson M.J. Almeida J.S. Santos H. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 3859-3868Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) led to the conclusion that nicotinic acid, but not aspartate, was essential for growth and, therefore, was the compound of choice to supply as a biosynthetic precursor of NAD+. In this work, aspartate and asparagine were omitted from the medium to ensure maximal labeling of the pyridine nucleotide pool. [5-13C]Nicotinic acid was synthesized, with an overall yield of 47% as described under “Materials and Methods” and used as the only nicotinic acid source for the growth of L. lactis. The purity of the labeled compound was evaluated both by13C NMR and 1H NMR spectroscopy, and no contaminants were detected in a 3.5 mm[5-13C]nicotinic acid solution (data not shown). A 13C spectrum of an anaerobic cell suspension of MG1363 cells grown on [5-13C]nicotinic acid is shown in Fig.1 A. The spectrum showed a single 13C resonance at 129.1 ppm, tentatively assigned to C5 of NAD+ by comparison with 13C NMR spectra of standards of NAD+, NADH, NADP+, and nicotinic acid (all at 20 mm in 50 mmKPi buffer, pH 6.5). Chemical shift values of C5 for the latter compounds were 129.1, 105.8, 129.1, and 124.5 ppm, respectively. To confirm the assignment, an ethanol extract of cells grown on [5-13C]nicotinic acid was prepared. After passage through an anion-exchange column, the fractions containing a 13C resonance at 129.1 ppm were pooled and lyophilized. The resulting sample was analyzed by 13C NMR (Fig. 1 B), and the resonance at 129.1 ppm was firmly assigned to carbon 5 (C5) of NAD+ by spiking the sample with the pure compound. A 1H NMR spectrum of the same sample confirmed the 13C NMR data (Fig.1 C). In addition, analysis o"

The glucocorticoid antagonist RU486 interferes with the steroid-mediated activation and can also exhibit partial agonist activity, a response in which corepressors have been implicated. Here we have shown that deletion of the N terminus of GR totally abolishes the agonist activity of RU486. Furthermore, we have demonstrated that corepressors bind directly to the RU486-bound GR as determined by glutathione S-transferase pull-down, mammalian two-hybrid assay, and coimmunoprecipitation. Fine mapping of the interaction regions within GR and the corepressor NCoR reveals a complex interaction profile that involves a number of domains in each protein. Notably, the N and the C termini of GR are both involved in corepressor binding. Thus, the N terminus of GR is a major determinant for RU486-dependent NCoR interaction as well as for RU486-mediated agonist activity.

On binding to glucocorticoid, the GR translocates to the nucleus and binds to specific palindromic DNA sequences in the promoter region of target genes. These binding sites function as glucocorticoid response elements (GRE), which confer glucocorticoid-dependent transcriptional regulation to the neighboring genes. Prominent examples of GRE-containing promoters are the tyrosine aminotransferase gene and the long terminal repeat in the mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV) genome (2Cole T.J. Blendy J.A. Monaghan A.P.

Similar to GR, the thyroid hormone receptor (TR) binds to thyroid hormone response elements (TRE) and modulates gene transcription. Repression by TR has been characterized in detail. In contrast to steroid hormone receptors, unliganded TR binds to TRE as well. Depending on the presence or absence of thyroid hormone (T3), TR induces or represses/silences gene transcription in an active manner (for review, see Ref. 8Yen P.M. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 1097-1142Crossref PubMed Scopus (1542) Google Scholar). This switch between repression and induction is controlled not only by the ligand but also by the nature of the DNA-binding element. So-called positive and negative response elements have been described (9Aranda A. Pascual A. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 1269-1304Crossref PubMed Scopus (1178) Google Scholar). As for steroid hormone receptors, gene activation requires the binding of coactivators, whereas gene repression is mediated by corepressors (for review, see Ref. 10Burke L.J. Baniahmad A. Faseb J. 2000; 14: 1876-1888Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). The search for corepressors conferring transcriptional repression of unliganded receptors led to the identification of a protein named nuclear corepressor (NCoR) and another factor called silencing mediator for retinoic acid and thyroid hormone receptors (SMRT) (11Chen J.D. Evans R.M. Nature. 1995; 377: 454-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (1712) Google Scholar, 12Horlein A.J. Naar A.M. Heinzel T. Torchia J. Gloss B. Kurokawa R. Ryan A. Kamei Y. Soderstrom M. Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Nature. 1995; 377: 397-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (1712) Google Scholar). In contrast to other corepressors like Alien (13Dressel U. Thormeyer D. Altincicek B. Paululat A. Eggert M. Schneider S. Tenbaum S.P. Renkawitz R. Baniahmad A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 3383-3394Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar) and Sharp (14Shi Y. Downes M. Xie W. Kao H.Y. Ordentlich P. Tsai C.C. Hon M. Evans R.M. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 1140-1151Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar), NCoR and SMRT are related both structurally and functionally. It has been shown that they interact strongly in vitro with unliganded TR and retinoic acid receptor (RAR) (11Chen J.D. Evans R.M. Nature. 1995; 377: 454-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (1712) Google Scholar, 12Horlein A.J. Naar A.M. Heinzel T. Torchia J. Gloss B. Kurokawa R. Ryan A. Kamei Y. Soderstrom M. Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Nature. 1995; 377: 397-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (1712) Google Scholar). The exchange of corepressor and coactivator complexes with opposite chromatin-modifying enzyme activity is therefore a possible mechanism for the ligand-induced switch of nuclear receptors between repression and activation (15Xu L. Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1999; 9: 140-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (814) Google Scholar, 16Pazin M.J. Kadonaga J.T.

Another aspect of steroid hormone action is the fact that hormone antagonists interfere with steroid-mediated activation but often confer a residual agonist activity to these receptors. By using a mammalian two-hybrid assay, it has been shown that the receptor corepressors NCoR and SMRT preferentially associate with the progesterone receptor occupied by the antagonist RU486 (18Jackson T.A.

The magnitude of the partial agonist activity of steroid antagonists and the dose-response curve of the agonist were shown to be influenced by the concentration of cofactors (18Jackson T.A.

Here, we have assessed whether the RU486-induced effects on GR are mediated by direct binding of NCoR and SMRT corepressors. In addition, we wanted to know which domains of the corepressor and of GR are required for the interaction. Using a mammalian one-hybrid assay, coimmunoprecipitation, and in vitro binding, we have demonstrated a RU486-dependent in vivointeraction involving several domains of the GR. Detailed in vitro binding analyses show a direct interaction and demonstrate the involvement of several corepressor domains and the N terminus of GR. The expression vectors for GR and GR deletion mutants (23Hollenberg S.M. Evans R.M. Cell. 1988; 55: 899-906Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (549) Google Scholar), VP16, VP16·cSMRT, and VP16·cNCoR (24Busch K. Martin B. Baniahmad A. Martial J.A. Renkawitz R. Muller M.

To generate the VP16·GR fusion construct, the cSMRT cDNA in VP16·cSMRT was replaced by in-frame insertion of GR cDNA obtained by digestion of pCMV-GST·hGR-(1–777) (25Schulz M. Schneider S. Lottspeich F. Renkawitz R. Eggert M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 280: 476-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) withBamHI and SmaI. The pRSV-TRβ plasmid and the corresponding empty vector and GRE2 constructs were as described (26Baniahmad A. Tsai S.Y. O'Malley B.W. Tsai M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

CV1 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% charcoal-treated fetal calf serum at 37 °C/5% CO2 in 6-well plates. Cells (105cells/well) were cotransfected with 0.88 μg of reporter plasmid and 0.18 μg of GR expression vector, unless otherwise stated, in 216 μl of transfection mixture using the CaPO4 method as described earlier (32Chen C. Okayama H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2745-2752Crossref PubMed Scopus (4821) Google Scholar). For overexpression of TRβ, 0.88 μg of pRSV-TRβ or empty vector was used. In modified mammalian two-hybrid experiments, 0.18 μg of either VP16·cNCoR, VP16·cSMRT, or VP16 expression vector was used. The total amount of transfected DNA was adjusted to 5.4 μg with pBluescript SKII (Stratagene). For hormonal studies, 10−7m hormone was added 12 h after transfection. Cells were harvested after 24–72 h and assayed for luciferase activity. All transfection assays shown were performed in duplicate or triplicate and were repeated at least twice. The error bars represent the mean ± S.D. Expression of GST and GST·NCoR proteins was induced in BL21(DE3) bacteria with 0.2 mm IPTG for 3 h at room temperature. Purification of the GST fusion proteins and interaction studies using in vitro translated, [35S]methionine-labeled GR were carried out as described earlier (33Baniahmad A. Thormeyer D. Renkawitz R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4259-4271Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Polyacrylamide gels were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue to ensure the presence of comparable amounts of GST fusion proteins in the binding reactions. Bound, labeled proteins were visualized by autoradiography. For full-length GR and GR-(418–777), RU486 (10−7m) was included during both the transcription/translation and binding reactions. 100 μl of GR-containing extract (derived from baculovirus-infected SF9 cells) was incubated with dexamethasone or RU486 for 5 min at 30 °C. Subsequently, 300 μl of 293T cell extract and NETN buffer (31Heinzel T. Lavinsky R.M. Mullen T.M. Soderstrom M. Laherty C.D. Torchia J. Yang W.M. Brard G. Ngo S.D. Davie J.R. Seto E. Eisenman R.N. Rose D.W. Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Nature. 1997; 387: 43-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (1084) Google Scholar) were added to a final volume of 800 μl. Immunoprecipitation was performed for 1 h at 4 °C with 5 μl of GR antibody (G85920, Transduction Laboratories) and 60 μl of protein A/G-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences). Bound proteins were washed 3–4 times with NETN. Proteins were solubilized with Laemmli buffer and heated to 100 °C for 5 min before loading onto SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Western blotting was carried out using antiserum to the C terminus of NCoR (31Heinzel T. Lavinsky R.M. Mullen T.M. Soderstrom M. Laherty C.D. Torchia J. Yang W.M. Brard G. Ngo S.D. Davie J.R. Seto E. Eisenman R.N. Rose D.W. Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Nature. 1997; 387: 43-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (1084) Google Scholar). To study the partial agonistic activity of the antihormone RU486 on the glucocorticoid receptor, we transfected the MMTV-Luc reporter construct into CV1 cells. Cells were either treated with ethanol, RU486, or dexamethasone (Fig. 1). Cotransfection of increasing amounts of GR expression vector showed no significant effect on the basal level activity of the reporter gene in the absence of hormone. Addition of an agonist, dexamethasone, resulted in strong reporter gene activation dependent on the amount of GR expression plasmid used. Incubation with the antihormone RU486 also resulted in transactivation dependent on the concentration of GR, although at a much lower level compared with the agonist dexamethasone. Clearly, RU486 induces the MMTV reporter gene to a much lesser extent than the agonist, but partial agonistic activity can be measured. To rule out the possibility that the low magnitude of agonistic activity mediated by RU486 was due to a reduced DNA binding of the RU486-complexed GR, we fused the VP16 transactivation domain to the GR sequence. In this way the nuclear translocation and DNA binding activity can be separated from the transactivation function of the DNA-bound receptor within the nucleus, because after nuclear translocation VP16 constructs transactivate the reporter gene efficiently. The results (Fig.2) show that in the presence of either dexamethasone or RU486 the VP16·GR fusion protein must have been translocated to the nucleus and bound to DNA with similar efficiency. In contrast, wild-type GR again only shows a partial agonistic activity in the presence of RU486. This result rules out the hypothesis that the partial agonistic activity of RU486 can be explained only by reduced DNA binding of an activated receptor. Rather, DNA-bound RU486-GR and dexamethasone-GR may recruit different transcription factor complexes. We therefore tested whether endogenous corepressors are involved in the limited activation by RU486. This was analyzed by overexpression of the thyroid hormone receptor, which interacts with corepressors only in the absence of thyroid hormone (11Chen J.D. Evans R.M. Nature. 1995; 377: 454-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (1712) Google Scholar, 12Horlein A.J. Naar A.M. Heinzel T. Torchia J. Gloss B. Kurokawa R. Ryan A. Kamei Y. Soderstrom M. Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Nature. 1995; 377: 397-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (1712) Google Scholar). Addition of hormone results in release of corepressors from TR. The MMTV-Luc reporter was cotransfected with expression vectors coding for GR and TRβ. As seen in Fig. 3, co-expression of TR leads to strong agonistic activity of RU486, concluding that unliganded TR squelches cofactors from RU486-bound GR. This increase in agonistic activity not only depends on the absence of T3but also on the presence of TR because cotransfection of the empty expression vector (control) had no effect. Such squelching experiments can be controlled by T3 (34Zhang X. Jeyakumar M. Petukhov S. Bagchi M.K. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 513-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 35Baniahmad A. Leng X. Burris T.P. Tsai S.Y. Tsai M.J. O'Malley B.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 76-86Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the presence of thyroid hormone, TR expression had no effect on the partial agonistic activity of RU486 (Fig. 3). The agonist activity of RU486 is enhanced by TR, and T3 relieves this enhancement.Figure 2RU486 does not inhibit DNA binding of GR. CV1 cells were cotransfected with the MMTV-Luc reporter and expression vectors for either wild-type GR or GR fused to the Vp16 activation domain. Cells were treated with the indicated hormones or vehicle (EtOH).

RLU, relative light units.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) These results strongly suggest that the activation function of RU486-complexed GR is impaired by binding to the same corepressors that bind to the unliganded TR. Unliganded TR binds to corepressors, including SMRT and NCoR. To test the possible interaction of GR with NCoR or SMRT, we performed a modified mammalian two-hybrid analysis. For this assay, we again used the MMTV-Luc reporter cotransfected with expression plasmids coding for full-length human GR and an expression plasmid coding for either a VP16 fusion with the C-terminal half of SMRT (VP16·cSMRT), the C-terminal half of NCoR (VP16·cNCoR), or the VP16 activation domain itself. When corepressor binding occurs, the VP16 domain should transactivate the reporter gene. In the presence of RU486 both fusion proteins, VP16·cSMRT and VP16·cNCoR, result in a strong activation, whereas the VP16 activation domain by itself has no effect (Fig. 4). This strong activation reflects the interaction with GR and is dependent on RU486, because the addition of dexamethasone results in only a marginal activation. Because the MMTV reporter contains several GR binding sites (28Gast A. Schneikert J. Cato A.C. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1998; 65: 117-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), we tested whether this strong RU486-dependent interaction of GR with VP16·cSMRT and VP16·cNCoR is dependent on the binding element. Use of a duplicated palindromic consensus binding site for GR (GRE2; Ref. 27Schule R. Muller M. Kaltschmidt C. Renkawitz R. Science. 1988; 242: 1418-1420Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar) in a luciferase reporter construct resulted in a similar RU486-dependent interaction and transactivation as seen with the MMTV-Luc reporter (data not shown), showing that this interaction is not restricted to GR bound to the MMTV promoter. In vivo complexes of corepressors NCoR or SMRT with the thyroid hormone receptor have been shown, as well as abrogation of corepressor binding by the addition of T3 in two-hybrid assays (11Chen J.D. Evans R.M. Nature. 1995; 377: 454-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (1712) Google Scholar, 12Horlein A.J. Naar A.M. Heinzel T. Torchia J. Gloss B. Kurokawa R. Ryan A. Kamei Y. Soderstrom M. Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Nature. 1995; 377: 397-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (1712) Google Scholar). Here, we analyzed whether the antagonist-bound GR is complexed with the corepressor NCoR in cell extracts. We enriched 293T cell extracts with baculovirus-expressed GR, immunoprecipitated the glucocorticoid receptor under various hormone conditions, and looked for coprecipitation of NCoR by Western blotting. Immunoprecipitation of GR in the presence of RU486 results in coprecipitation of NCoR, showing that NCoR is complexed with RU486-bound GR in cell extracts (Fig. 5). This binding is specific since no NCoR is coprecipitated with the same antibody in the absence of hormone. As expected from the weak interaction in a mammalian two-hybrid assay (Fig. 4) in the presence of dexamethasone, no complex could be detected. After having shown that the extent of agonist activity displayed by RU486-bound GR is dependent on the amount of available corepressors in the cell (see above), we wondered whether this RU486-mediated transactivation is confined to the C-terminal half of the receptor as has been shown for glucocorticoid-induced transactivation (36Webster N.J. Green S. Jin J.R. Chambon P. Cell. 1988; 54: 199-207Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar). Therefore we tested RU486-mediated transactivation of the MMTV-Luc reporter by wild-type GR (Fig. 6, GR 1–777), or a C-terminal region of GR (GR 418–777). Surprisingly, deletion of the N-terminal region in the receptor construct GR-(418–777) abolishes RU486-mediated induction, whereas the dexamethasone induction is retained (not shown). This demonstrates that the N terminus of GR is critical for RU486-mediated agonism. Consequently, we wanted to identify the domains of GR involved in corepressor binding. We utilized a modified mammalian two-hybrid system to delineate the regions of GR required for NCoR interaction. In this setup, the natural DNA binding domain of GR is used for DNA binding, and different GR deletions are tested for interaction with corepressor VP16 fusions. Full-length GR, GR-(1–777), was expressed together with VP16 or VP16·cNCoR (Fig.7 A). As seen above, there is a strong, 80-fold RU486-dependent interaction detected. Dexamethasone-induced activation by the VP16·cNCoR construct is only 6-fold (Fig. 7 D). The N-terminal deletion mutant GR-(418–777) results in a reduced activation by VP16·cNCoR (Fig. 7,B and D). With this deletion, both agonist and antagonist induce a similar weak interaction of the corepressor (about 5-fold, see Fig. 7 D), showing that the specific effect of the antihormone is completely abolished (Fig. 7 B). GR deletions of the C terminus result in receptor constructs mediating hormone-independent, constitutive gene activation (37Hollenberg S.M. Giguere V. Segui P. Evans R.M. Cell. 1987; 49: 39-46Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). Coexpression of VP16·cNCoR (Fig. 7, C and D) confers an interaction-mediated activation of moderate activity for the GR-(1–550) construct in contrast to the other deletions used, which show only a low level interaction. In particular, deletion of the N-terminal 261 amino acids results in a severe reduction in binding, indicating that this region is critical for interaction of NCoR with GR.Figure 7N-terminal as well as C-terminal domains of GR are required for efficient interaction with NCoR. The indicated GR constructs were analyzed for binding to VP16·NCoR in the modified mammalian two-hybrid system using the MMTV-Luc reporter. CV1 cells were cotransfected with MMTV-Luc, expression vectors, and the indicated proteins. Cells were harvested after 48 h and assayed for luciferase activity. Full-length GR (A) and GR constructs containing an intact ligand binding domain (B) were tested in the absence or presence of the indicated hormones. C, GR constructs in which the ligand binding domain is deleted were tested in the absence of hormone only. Luciferase activity is expressed asFold activation relative to VP16 in the absence of ligand.D, schematic view of full-length GR and GR deletion mutants used in A–C. The ligand binding domain (LBD) and the DNA binding domain (DBD) are marked. The strength of interaction is represented by the ratio of luciferase activity after transfection of VP16·cNCoR relative to the VP16 control under the same hormone conditions.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) From these data it can be concluded that both the N and the C termini regions of the receptor are required for efficient NCoR interaction. A major determinant for antagonist-dependent NCoR interaction is mediated by the N terminus of GR, as is the antagonist-mediated activation. In order to determine whether NCoR interacts directly with GR, bacterially expressed GST·NCoR fusion proteins were incubated within vitro translated, 35S radio-labeled full-length GR or deletion constructs (Fig.8). The longest NCoR construct that was used spans amino acids 1679 to 2453, a region containing three nuclear receptor interaction domains (Fig. 8 A, N1,N2, N3) that coordinate binding to the TR (38Hu X. Lazar M.A. Nature. 1999; 402: 93-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar, 39Nagy L. Kao H.Y. Love J.D., Li, C. Banayo E. Gooch J.T. Krishna V. Chatterjee K. Evans R.M. Schwabe J.W.

Rosenfeld M.G. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 3198-3208Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar). This GST·NCoR protein, bound to glutathione beads, retains full-length GR as well as the two deletion mutants, showing that NCoR can bind directly to GR (Fig. 8 C). Further delineation of the interaction domain within NCoR showed that the very C-terminal constructs, GST·NCoR-(2296–2453) and GST·NCoR-(2239–2453), do not interact with full-length GR or with GR deletions even when the N1 domain is present (Fig. 8 C). In contrast, GST·NCoR constructs spanning amino acids 1745–2215 and 1954–2453 clearly show an interaction, although reduced, with full-length GR. Electrophoretic migration of full-length GR is perturbed by the GST·NCoR protein 1745–2215, which migrates at the very same position. Individual combinations of all of the GR constructs with all of the GST·NCoR constructs show a complex pattern of NCoR as well as of GR domains involved in binding. In particular, the region of NCoR from 2239–2453, which contains the N1 domain, is not sufficient to bind GR. However, this domain contributes to binding to the GR region 1–488, because deletion of this region leads to a dramatic reduction in binding to GR region 1–488. Additionally, all of the NCoR constructs that bind to full-length GR are able to bind GR-(418–777). Therefore, both the receptor N terminus and the C terminus not only contribute to NCoR binding but can also bind individually. Furthermore, three NCoR regions from amino acids 1745–1954, 1954–2215, and 2239–2453 contribute to binding to GR. Thus, we have identified several domains of NCoR and GR that are involved in the direct interaction between these two factors. Steroid hormone receptors are ligand-inducible transcription factors that, after steroid binding, regulate genes harboring steroid response elements. So-called hormone antagonists are highly relevant for endocrine therapies because they prevent steroid receptors from binding to their natural ligands. Antihormones have been grouped according to their effect on the conformational change of the receptor observed after ligand binding. Type I antihormones induce a marginal change in the receptor such that it more resembles the inactive receptor conformation. Hormone antagonists classified into a group of a higher type number more resemble the fully induced receptor after agonist binding. Therefore, the antiglucocorticoid RU486 is often classified as a type II antagonist leading to a mixed agonist/antagonist transcriptional activity (41Beck C.A. Weigel N.L. Moyer M.L. Nordeen S.K.

The function of the glucocorticoid receptor bound to an agonist has been shown to be affected by overexpression of corepressors. In addition, the agonist activity of mixed antagonists is changed upon corepressor expression (45Song L.N. Huse B. Rusconi S. Simons S.S., Jr. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 24806-24816Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Here we have shown by in vitro binding that the glucocorticoid receptor is able to interact directly with the corepressor NCoR. Such an association is confirmed by an in vivo interaction assay, as well as by coimmunoprecipitation. Interestingly, both efficient coimmunoprecipitation and functionalin vivo interaction depend on the presence of RU486. In the presence of the agonist dexamethasone, NCoR is not immunoprecipitated with GR. Similarly, functional interaction of GR with either NCoR or SMRT is dependent on the presence of RU486 and is only weakly detectable in the presence of dexamethasone. Upon deletion of the N-terminal half of the glucocorticoid receptor, GR-(418–777), the strong RU486-specific two-hybrid interaction with VP16·cNCoR is lost, but the low level of dexamethasone-induced interaction is maintained. This result suggests that the N-terminal half of GR is required for efficient corepressor interaction. Similarly, deletion of the C-terminal ligand-binding domain diminishes corepressor interaction. Corepressor domains interacting with nuclear receptors have been characterized, in particular the consensus sequence (I/L)XX(I/V)I (CoRNR box) (38Hu X. Lazar M.A. Nature. 1999; 402: 93-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar, 39Nagy L. Kao H.Y. Love J.D., Li, C. Banayo E. Gooch J.T. Krishna V. Chatterjee K. Evans R.M. Schwabe J.W.

Rosenfeld M.G. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 3198-3208Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar). Detailed analyses of NCoR and SMRT have revealed a difference in these interaction domains between these corepressors. For NCoR, three interaction domains have been characterized that confer receptor specificity (46Cohen R.N. Brzostek S. Kim B. Chorev M. Wondisford F.E. Hollenberg A.N. Mol. Endocrinol. 2001; 15: 1049-1061Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 47Webb P. Anderson C.M. Valentine C. Nguyen P. Marimuthu A. West B.L. Baxter J.D. Kushner P.J. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 1976-1985Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Two of these domains are necessary for full interactions with nuclear receptors, with a specific decrease in binding of NCoR to TR in case of mutation of the N3 domain (46Cohen R.N. Brzostek S. Kim B. Chorev M. Wondisford F.E. Hollenberg A.N. Mol. Endocrinol. 2001; 15: 1049-1061Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). However, only the receptor C termini, not the N termini, have been analyzed in detail for corepressor interaction. Our analysis of in vitro interaction of NCoR with GR revealed a similar complexity. It is noteworthy that deletion of N1 reduced the binding to the N-terminal half of GR, GR-(1–488), whereas two of these interaction domains (N1 plus N2 or N2 plus N3) are sufficient for binding to full-length GR. Therefore, similar domains of NCoR involved in binding to the GR C terminus are also involved in binding to TR or RAR. The striking result of our experiments is that efficient GR/NCoR interaction depends on the antagonist RU486 and on the N-terminal receptor domain. Since ligand binding and ligand-induced conformational changes are confined to the C terminus, one might envisage cooperativity of both the N and C termini in binding to NCoR. In addition to corepressor binding, the receptor N terminus mediates agonist activity in the presence of RU486. This region has been shown to contain one of the major transcriptional activation functions (AF1; Ref. 29Giguere V. Hollenberg S.M. Rosenfeld M.G. Evans R.M. Cell. 1986; 46: 645-652Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (678) Google Scholar). RU486-induced transcriptional activity seems to be limited by corepressors, because corepressor squelching results in a strong receptor activation. Therefore, the ratio of simultaneously binding coactivators and corepressors may explain the transcriptional effects of GR by ligands with mixed agonist/antagonist activities (22Szapary D. Huang Y. Simons S.S., Jr. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 13: 2108-2121Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). The knowledge of these interaction mechanisms will, in the context of antihormone treatment, allow modulation of the mixed agonist/antagonist effects depending on the cell type and the respective cellular corepressor content.

Herein, we examined whether the overexpression of a human apoB transgene in the heart affects triglyceride accumulation and development of cardiac dysfunction in streptozotocin-treated diabetic mice. Blood glucose, plasma free fatty acids, and plasma triglycerides were similarly affected in diabetic wild type mice and diabetic apoB transgenic mice as compared with non-diabetic mice of the same genotype. After 12 weeks, heart triglycerides were increased by 48% in diabetic wild type mice. These mice displayed an increased expression of brain natriuretic peptide and deterioration of heart function on echocardiography. In diabetic apoB transgenic mice, heart triglyceride levels were identical to those in non-diabetic wild type and apoB transgenic mice, and brain natriuretic peptide expression as well as echocardiographic indexes of heart function were only marginally affected or unaffected. The findings suggest that triglyceride accumulation in the heart is important for development of diabetic cardiomyopathy in mice, and that lipoprotein formation by cardiomyocytes plays an integrated role in cardiac lipid metabolism.

This ability is dependent on the expression of the apoB and microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (MTP)1 genes (1Davis R.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1440: 1-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 2Wetterau J.R. Lin M.C. Jamil H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1345: 136-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). MTP transfers triglycerides onto the apoB polypeptide chain during its translation into the endoplasmic reticulum. ApoB serves as the principal structural protein in the resulting lipoprotein particles that are secreted from the cells. Studies of mice, which overexpress a human apoB transgene, revealed that cardiac myocytes in addition to hepatocytes and absorptive enterocytes also express the apoB and MTP genes (3Nielsen L.B. Veniant M. Boren J. Raabe M. Wong J.S. Tam C. Flynn L. Vanni-Reyes T. Gunn M.D. Goldberg I.J. Hamilton R.L. Young S.G.

Consequently, the heart secretes lipoproteins containing the full-length apoB100 protein rather than the truncated apoB48 protein (4Boren J. Veniant M.M. Young S.G. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 1197-1202Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Because the formation of apoB-containing lipoproteins serves as an effective means of secreting large amounts of triglycerides from liver and intestinal cells, we hypothesized previously that the physiological role of lipoprotein formation in the heart could be the removal of triglycerides from myocytes that are not used as fuel, i.e. a reverse triglyceride transport pathway (6Veniant M.M.

Lipidol. 1998; 9: 103-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Recently, the idea has been put forward that triglyceride accumulation in cardiac muscle cells adversely affects cardiac function (8Unger R.H. Orci L. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 312-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). Diabetes is associated with aberrations in cardiac fuel metabolism and a ∼2-fold increase in cardiac triglyceride content (9Heyliger C.E. Scarim A.L. Eymer V.P. Skau K.A. Powell D.M. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1997; 176: 281-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar, 10Heyliger C.E. Rodrigues B. McNeill J.H. Diabetes. 1986; 35: 1152-1157Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). In diabetic rats, this triglyceride accumulation occurs in parallel with compromised cardiac performance (11Joffe I.I. Travers K.E. Perreault-Micale C.L. Hampton T. Katz S.E. Morgan J.P. Douglas P.S. J. Am. Coll. Cardiol. 1999; 34: 2111-2119Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 12Hoit B.D. Castro C. Bultron G. Knight S. Matlib M.A. J.

Echocardiographic studies have also revealed abnormal cardiac function in young diabetic individuals without coronary heart disease (13Spector K.S Clin. Cardiol. 1998; 21: 885-887Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). It is unknown as to what extent triglyceride accumulation in cardiac myocytes affects the development of diabetes-induced cardiac dysfunction. In this study, we examined whether the overexpression of a human apolipoprotein B transgene in the heart might attenuate cardiac lipid accumulation and consequently modulate signs of cardiac dysfunction in streptozotocin-treated diabetic mice. 5–7-week-old wild type mice (C57BL/6 mice, 20 female and 20 male mice) and human apoB transgenic mice (C57BL/6NTac-TgN mice, 20 female and 20 male mice) were obtained from M&B (Ry, Denmark) housed at the Panum Institute, University of Copenhagen (Copenhagen, Denmark) and fed standard laboratory chow (Altromin number 1314, Rugaarden, Denmark). The apoB transgenic mice were generated with an ∼87-kilobase pair human genomic fragment from a genomic P1 bacteriophage clone, p158. This transgene directs human apoB overexpression in the liver and in the heart but not in the intestine (7McCormick S.P. Nielsen L.B. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 1998; 9: 103-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 14Linton M.F. Farese R.V., Jr. Chiesa G. Grass D.S. Chin P. Hammer R.E. Hobbs H.H. Young S.G. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 92: 3029-3037Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). The transgenic mice used in this study had been backcrossed to a C57Bl6 background >14 times. The study was approved by the Danish Government body supervising animal experiments (Dyreforsoegstilsynet). Streptozotocin (STZ) (40 μg/g/day) (Sigma) was injected intraperitoneally once a day for five consecutive days followed by a two-day recovery and injections for an additional 2 days. STZ (4 μg/μl) was dissolved in citrate buffer (0.05 m, pH 4.5, 4 °C), kept on ice, and injected within 20 min. Control mice received the citrate buffer vehicle (200 μl/mouse/day) following the same treatment regimen. Blood samples for plasma insulin and lipid analyses were drawn into tubes containing Na2-EDTA and centrifuged at ∼4000 × gfor 10 min at 4 °C. Plasma was stored at −80 °C until analyses. After echocardiographic examination, the heart and liver were removed and briefly rinsed in 0.9% NaCl (4 °C). The heart was carefully cleaned of pericardial fat. Cross-sectional slices of the ventricular portion of heart including right and left ventricular tissue and liver biopsies were snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −141 °C for subsequent lipid and RNA extraction. A ∼3-mm slice from the apex of the heart was fixed in 3% paraformaldehyde. The mice were anesthetized with a subcutaneous injection of 1:1 hypnorm (Fentanyl, Fluanisone (10 mg/ml), Janssen):diazepam (6 ml/kg) before transthoracic echocardiography, and Doppler flow analyses were performed with the Vivid Five instrument (GE Ultrasound, Copenhagen, Denmark) and a 10-MHz transducer head (15Bollano E. Omerovic E. Bohlooly-y M Kujacic V. Madhu B. Tornell J. Isaksson O. Soussi B. Schulze W., Fu, M.L. Matejka G. Waagstein F. Isgaard J. Endocrinology. 2000; 141: 2229-2235Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Echocardiographic investigations were repeated in each mouse after an intraperitoneal injection of dobutamine (1.0–1.5 μg/g body weight) (16Tanaka N. Dalton N. Mao L. Rockman H.A. Peterson K.L. Gottshall K.R. Hunter J.J. Chien K.R. Ross J., Jr. Circulation. 1996; 94: 1109-1117Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). Echocardiography and data analyses were performed by E. Bollano without any knowledge of treatment and mouse genotype. The glucose concentration in tail blood was determined with a Humacheck Plus glucose meter (Human, Wiesbaden, Germany). Plasma insulin was measured with ELISA by Dr. B. Rolin (Novo Nordisk A/S). Plasma lipid concentrations were determined with enzymatic kits: free fatty acids (Wako NEFA C kit, TriChem Aps, Frederikssund, Denmark), triglycerides (GPO-TRINDER, Sigma; this kit also measures free glycerol), total cholesterol (CHOD-PAP, Roche Molecular Biochemicals), and high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol (HDL-C, Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Lipids were extracted from heart (∼40 mg) and liver (∼140 mg) biopsies with chloroform/methanol. For enzymatic quantification of triglycerides, glycerol, and cholesterol with the same kits as for plasma analyses, the tissue extracts were redissolved in isopropyl alcohol with 1% Triton X-100 (2 μl/mg wet weight of tissue, Sigma). For thin layer chromatography (TLC) (17Ruiz J.I. Ochoa B. J. Lipid Res. 1997; 38: 1482-1489Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the extracts were redissolved in toluene (1 μl/mg wet weight of tissue). TLC plates (20 × 20 cm, DC-Fertigplatten SIL G-25, Macherey-Nagel, Düren, Germany) were impregnated with Na2-EDTA (1 mm, pH 5.5) by ascending development, dried, and washed in chloroform:methanol:water (60:40:10). After the activation of the TLC plates at 110 °C for 30 min, 1 μl of tissue extracts and standards was applied. The plates were developed in a six-step procedure using chloroform:methanol:water (60:40:10); chloroform:methanol:water (65:40:5); chloroform, methanol, ethyl acetate, 2-propanol, ethanol, 25% KCL (22:15:35:5:20:9); ethanol:toluene:diethyl ether (3:60:40); diethyl ether:n-heptan (8:94); and pure n-heptan. After development, the plates were placed in 10% cupric sulfate (w/v) in 8% phosphoric acid (v/v) for 10 s, dried with a hair dryer, and baked for 2 min at 200 °C. For quantification, the TLC plates were scanned at 300 × 300 dots/inch with a HP flatbed 4c/T scanner (Hewlett Packard, Copenhagen, Denmark). The digitized images were analyzed with Multi-analyst software (Bio-Rad). All of the samples were analyzed twice on different TLC plates. A linear regression analysis of the TLC-based cardiac triglyceride measurementsversus enzymatic cardiac triglyceride measurements yielded an r 2 = 0.91 (n = 80). Frozen heart and liver biopsies (40–50 mg) were homogenized with a Polytron PT1200CL (Buch & Holm, Herlev, Denmark) in TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). Total RNA was extracted according to the manual by the manufacturer and suspended in RNase-free H2O. The RNA concentration was calculated from the absorbance at 260 nm (A260). The RNA integrity was assured always by electrophoresis on a 1% agarose gel. First strand cDNA was synthesized from 1 μg of total RNA with Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (40 units, Roche A/S, Avedore, Denmark) and random hexamer primers in 10-μl reactions. The primers for amplification of mouse apoB, MTP, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, and β-actin are described elsewhere (18Bartels E.D. Lauritsen M. Nielsen L.B. Diabetes. 2002; 51: 1233-1239Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). The primers for brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) (5′-CTGAAGGTGCTGTCCCAGAT-3′ and 5′-GTTCTTTTGTGAGGCCTTGG-3′) and human apoB (5′-GGAGCTGCTGGACATTGCTA-3′ and 5′-ATGGCAGCTTTCTGGATCAT-3′) were obtained from Sigma-Genosys (Pampisford, United Kingdom). The human apoB transcript could not be amplified from wild type mouse liver cDNA, and the mouse apoB transcript could not be amplified from human HepG2 cell cDNA. The specificity of each PCR was further confirmed by DNA sequencing of upper and lower strands of PCR transcripts (18Bartels E.D. Lauritsen M. Nielsen L.B. Diabetes. 2002; 51: 1233-1239Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). We never observed any amplification of genomic DNA from the cDNA preparations. Quantitative real-time PCR analysis of mRNA expression was done with a LightCycler and the DNAmaster SYBR Green kit (Roche A/S). The PCR reactions (20 μl) contained 2 μl of SYBR Green I mixture, 2–3 mm MgCl2, 10 pmol of each primer, cDNA synthesized from 20 ng of total RNA, and PCR grade H2O. For each mRNA transcript in each tissue biopsy, the time point of the log-linear increase in amplified DNA during the PCR was determined with the fit-point option of the LightCycler software. The relationship between that time point and the relative concentration of an mRNA transcript was determined by analyzing in each run the dilution series of cDNA from wild type mouse livers or HepG2 cells (cDNA synthesized from 100, 20, 2, and 0.2 ng of total RNA). All differences among groups were analyzed with Student's t test. Injections of the pancreatic β-cell toxin STZ conferred a pronounced and sustained increase in blood glucose levels and a corresponding decrease in plasma insulin levels in male mice (TableI). However, in female mice, the diabetic response after STZ treatment was marginal (Table I). The blood glucose concentrations were similarly increased by STZ treatment in wild type and apoB transgenic mice (Table I). The plasma concentrations of triglycerides and free fatty acids were not affected significantly by STZ treatment in either apoB transgenic or wild type mice (Table I). As expected, apoB transgenic mice had higher total and VLDL+LDL plasma cholesterol concentrations than wild type mice (TableI).Table IBasic metabolic characteristicsWild typeApoB transgenicSTZControlSTZControlMale miceBody weight (g)23.8 ± 0.61-ap < 0.0005 compared with controls.25.4 ± 0.524.7 ± 0.81-ap < 0.0005 compared with controls.26.8 ± 0.3Blood glucose, fed15.5 ± 2.21-bp < 0.005.7.2 ± 0.316.5 ± 1.31-ap < 0.0005 compared with controls.7.8 ± 0.4Blood glucose, fasted11.6 ± 1.41-bp < 0.005.5.4 ± 0.312.7 ± 0.91-ap < 0.0005 compared with controls.6.2 ± 0.2Insulin, (pmol/liter)406 ± 751-cp < 0.05.750 ± 139364 ± 321-cp < 0.05.1021 ± 176Free fatty acids0.37 ± 0.020.31 ± 0.020.38 ± 0.030.35 ± 0.02Triglycerides0.77 ± 0.100.57 ± 0.061.14 ± 0.041.13 ± 0.06Free glycerol0.88 ± 0.031-cp < 0.05.0.77 ± 0.020.74 ± 0.020.80 ± 0.03Total cholesterol2.16 ± 0.141.81 ± 0.062.80 ± 0.152.48 ± 0.09HDL-cholesterol1.67 ± 0.121.70 ± 0.061.48 ± 0.061.61 ± 0.05VLDL+LDL-cholesterol0.49 ± 0.190.11 ± 0.021.32 ± 0.151-cp < 0.05.0.87 ± 0.10Female miceBody weight (g)21.7 ± 0.521.5 ± 0.421.0 ± 0.722.8 ± 0.3Blood glucose, fed6.9 ± 0.21-cp < 0.05.6.0 ± 0.310.0 ± 1.01-cp < 0.05.7.1 ± 0.2Blood glucose, fasted7.1 ± 0.21-ap < 0.0005 compared with controls.5.4 ± 0.29.0 ± 1.37.0 ± 0.3Insulin (pmol/liter)254 ± 44228 ± 29205 ± 28326 ± 65Free fatty acids0.36 ± 0.050.30 ± 0.030.42 ± 0.031-cp < 0.05.0.33 ± 0.03Triglycerides0.43 ± 0.020.44 ± 0.040.97 ± 0.060.89 ± 0.03Free glycerol0.68 ± 0.030.68 ± 0.020.67 ± 0.010.67 ± 0.02Total cholesterol1.59 ± 0.061.77 ± 0.112.67 ± 0.112.59 ± 0.11HDL-cholesterol1.45 ± 0.051.51 ± 0.061.36 ± 0.021.36 ± 0.05VLDL+LDL-cholesterol0.15 ± 0.050.28 ± 0.091.32 ± 0.121.23 ± 0.09Values are 12 weeks after STZ treatment.

The effects of STZ and apoB overexpression were observed throughout the study period. Values are the mean ± S.E.n = 10 in each group. Real-time PCR analyses were used to assess whether STZ-induced diabetes might affect heart or liver expression of the MTP or apoB genes. The cardiac MTP mRNA levels of male mice were increased significantly by STZ in both wild type and apoB transgenic mice (Fig.1A). In contrast, there was no effect of STZ-induced diabetes on MTP gene expression in the liver (Fig. 1A). The expression of MTP mRNA in the heart was ∼2 and ∼1% of the expression in the liver in STZ-treated and control mice, respectively. STZ treatment did not affect heart or liver expression of either the endogenous mouse apoB gene or the human apoB transgene (Fig. 1, B–C). Human apoB mRNA level in the heart of the transgenic mice was ∼4% of that in the liver. This finding is in close accordance with a previous estimate by RNase protection assays (3Nielsen L.B. Veniant M. Boren J. Raabe M. Wong J.S. Tam C. Flynn L. Vanni-Reyes T. Gunn M.D. Goldberg I.J. Hamilton R.L. Young S.G. Circulation. 1998; 98: 13-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). The heart expression of endogenous mouse apoB mRNA was ∼0.1% of that in the liver (Fig.1B). The overexpression of human apoB mRNA had no effect on mouse apoB or MTP mRNA expression. Cardiac and hepatic human apoB, mouse apoB, and MTP mRNA levels were similar in STZ-treated and control female mice (data not shown). In male wild type mice, STZ treatment increased the mean cardiac triglyceride content by 48% (p < 0.05) (Fig. 2A). In contrast, STZ treatment did not affect the cardiac triglyceride content of male apoB transgenic mice (Fig. 2A). In female mice, the cardiac triglyceride content was similar in STZ-treated and control wild type mice (4.3 ± 0.4 versus 4.1 ± 0.3 nmol/mg wet weight). The cardiac triglyceride content of non-diabetic control mice was unaffected by apoB overexpression (Fig. 2A). The enzymatic method for measuring triglycerides in cardiac biopsies also measured glycerol. In male mice, the heart glycerol content was increased in STZ-treated wild type mice compared with their controls, whereas there was no difference in the glycerol content between STZ-treated apoB transgenic mice and their controls (Fig.2B). STZ did not significantly affect free glycerol levels in either wild type or apoB transgenic female mice (data not shown). The levels of free glycerol were higher in apoB transgenic control mice than in wild type control mice (Fig. 2B). To assess whether the overexpression of the apoB transgene in the heart affected cardiac stores of other lipid classes than triglycerides, we measured a series of cardiac lipids in addition to triglycerides (TableII). There was no effect of STZ treatment or apoB overexpression on cardiac contents of cholesterol or phospholipids in male mice (Table II) or in female mice (data not shown). The TLC analysis confirmed the normalization of cardiac triglycerides in the STZ-treated apoB transgenic male mice (TableII).Table IIHeart and liver lipids in male miceWild typeApoB transgenicSTZControlSTZControlHeart Triglycerides (nmol/mg ww)5.1 ± 0.82-ap = 0.07 compared with control mice of the same genotype.3.5 ± 0.33.7 ± 0.43.9 ± 0.4 Free cholesterol (nmol/mg ww)2.7 ± 0.22.7 ± 0.22.7 ± 0.22.7 ± 0.1 Sphingomyelin (μg/mg ww)1.2 ± 0.11.1 ± 0.11.2 ± 0.11.1 ± 0.1 Phosphatidylcholine (μg/mg ww)16 ± 217 ± 216 ± 117 ± 1 Phosphatidylserine (μg/mg ww)1.0 ± 0.11.1 ± 0.11.1 ± 0.11.0 ± 0.04 Phosphatidylinositol (μg/mg ww)1.1 ± 0.11.1 ± 0.11.1 ± 0.11.1 ± 0.1 Phosphatidylethanolamine (μg/mg ww)13 ± 114 ± 113 ± 114 ± 1 Cardiolipin (μg/mg ww)4.5 ± 0.34.8 ± 0.24.5 ± 0.24.7 ± 0.2Liver Triglycerides (nmol/mg ww)11.0 ± 0.89.8 ± 0.710.3 ± 1.114.4 ± 1.22-bp < 0.05 compared with control mice of the same genotype.

The hepatic triglyceride content was lower in STZ-treated apoB transgenic male mice compared with control apoB transgenic male mice (Table II). A reduction of hepatic triglyceride stores in STZ-treated diabetic mice has been described previously (19Kunjathoor V.V. Wilson D.L. LeBoeuf R.C. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 97: 1767-1773Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Echocardiography and Doppler flow analyses showed that STZ-induced diabetes affects cardiac function of wild type male mice (Fig. 3, A–C, and TableIII). In accordance with previous findings in rats (11Joffe I.I. Travers K.E. Perreault-Micale C.L. Hampton T. Katz S.E. Morgan J.P. Douglas P.S. J. Am. Coll.

The indexes of systolic function (e.g.circumferential shortening (Fig. 3B) and diameter of the left ventricle at the end of the systole (Table III)) and diastolic function (E-wave deceleration time (Fig. 3C)) were affected negatively by STZ at the base-line recordings. For each of these parameters, the effect of STZ treatment was less pronounced and/or absent in apoB transgenic mice. In apoB transgenic male mice, the heart rate tended to be increased, whereas circumferential shortening, diameter of the left ventricle at the end of the systole, and E-wave deceleration time at base line were not significantly affected after STZ treatment (Fig. 3, B and C, and TableIII).Table IIIBiomechanical cardiac characteristics of male miceWild typeApoB transgenicSTZControlSTZControl Heart weight (mg/g body weight)4.3 ± 0.14.5 ± 0.14.4 ± 0.14.2 ± 0.1 Left ventricular diameter in diastole (mm)3.9 ± 0.13.8 ± 0.14.0 ± 0.14.0 ± 0.1Base line Heart rate (min−1)341 ± 15.2385 ± 22.2369 ± 17.5339 ± 13.3 Blood pressure (mm Hg)134 ± 6135 ± 6132 ± 4136 ± 4 Left ventricular diameter in systole (mm)2.3 ± 0.13-ap < 0.005.1.9 ± 0.12.3 ± 0.12.1 ± 0.1 Fractional shortening (%)41 ± 23-bp < 0.0005 compared with control mice of the same genotype.51 ± 143 ± 23-cp ≤ 0.05.49 ± 1 Left ventricular outflow velocity (m/sec)0.52 ± 0.030.55 ± 0.030.50 ± 0.020.50 ± 0.03 E/A2.3 ± 0.271.9 ± 0.111.9 ± 0.052.3 ± 0.19Stress Heart rate (min−1)645 ± 32644 ± 24663 ± 21649 ± 26 Blood pressure (mm Hg)151 ± 4160 ± 4153 ± 4153 ± 4 Fractional shortening (%)58 ± 23-ap < 0.005.66 ± 157 ± 23-ap < 0.005.67 ± 1 Circumferential shortening (circ/sec)8.8 ± 0.33-cp ≤ 0.05.10.4 ± 0.69.2 ± 0.53-cp ≤ 0.05.11.1 ± 0.7 Left ventricular outflow velocity (m/sec)0.49 ± 0.033-ap < 0.005.0.68 ± 0.040.52 ± 0.030.57 ± 0.03Cardiac performance was examined 12 weeks after STZ treatment with echocardiography and Doppler flow analysis.

Res. 2001; 51: 442-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). STZ-treated diabetic rats have increased BNP gene expression in the heart (21Walther T. Heringer-Walther S. Tschope R. Reinecke A. Schultheiss H.P. Tschope C. J. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 24: 391-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). In this study, STZ-treated wild type male mice had increased cardiac BNP mRNA levels compared with vehicle-treated wild type mice (Fig. 3D). In contrast, BNP gene expression was not affected by STZ treatment in the apoB transgenic male mice (Fig. 3D). Diabetes has also been associated with apoptosis of cardiac myocytes (22Frustaci A. Kajstura J. Chimenti C. Jakoniuk I. Leri A. Maseri A. Nadal-Ginard B. Anversa P. Circ. Res. 2000; 87: 1123-1132Crossref PubMed Scopus (706) Google Scholar). Terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase dUTP nick-end (TUNEL) staining of histological sections from the apical section of each mouse heart in this study revealed very few apoptotic cells with similar occurrence in STZ-treated and vehicle-treated mice (data not shown), and STZ treatment did not affect heart weight. The metabolism of fat is essential for the function of the heart. The present results suggest that accelerated lipoprotein formation by cardiac myocytes can remove excess triglycerides from the diabetic heart. This idea is in accordance with a recent seminal study (23Bjorkegren J. Veniant M. Kim S.K. Withycombe S.K. Wood P.A. Hellerstein M.K. Neese R.A. Young S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38511-38517Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), which demonstrated that hearts from apoB transgenic mice secrete more triglycerides in apoB-containing lipoproteins than control mice. Also, the overexpression of apoB decreased heart triglyceride stores in mice with a genetic defect in the metabolism of long chain fatty acids that results in cardiac triglyceride accumulation during prolonged fasting (23Bjorkegren J. Veniant M. Kim S.K. Withycombe S.K. Wood P.A. Hellerstein M.K. Neese R.A. Young S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38511-38517Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar).

Because the MTP mRNA expression levels were increased in the heart of diabetic mice, this study is compatible with the idea that lipoprotein secretion from the heart might be regulated. This notion has also gained support from studies of heart biopsies from patients undergoing cardiac surgery. 2L. B. Nielsen, submitted for publication. Those studies suggest that the MTP mRNA expression is increased in hypoxic human left ventricle compared with normoxic human left ventricle, and that the MTP mRNA level is negatively associated with cardiac triglyceride storage in patients with ischemic heart disease. An increase of lipoprotein secretion rates from cardiac myocytes during increased fat load (such as in diabetes with increased flux of free fatty acids into the heart and cardiac ischemia with decreased β-oxidation of fatty acids) could contribute to maintain a constant (low) level of triglycerides in cardiac myocytes. Remarkably, in this study, we only observed increased MTP gene expression in the heart and not in the livers of STZ-treated diabetic mice. The latter observation is in accordance with a more elaborate study of MTP in diabetic mouse livers (18Bartels E.D. Lauritsen M. Nielsen L.B. Diabetes. 2002; 51: 1233-1239Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Further studies are needed to determine whether it might be possible to increase lipoprotein secretion from the heart without increasing the secretion from the liver. We were able to test the functional consequences of cardiac triglyceride accumulation in the diabetic mouse heart, because cardiac triglyceride stores in diabetic mice were increased in wild type mice but were normal in apoB transgenic mice. Importantly, the blood levels of major cardiac fuel substrates (i.e. glucose, free fatty acids, and triglycerides) were similarly affected by STZ treatment in wild type and in apoB transgenic mice. Moreover, in the heart, the effect of apoB overexpression on cardiac lipids was confined to triglycerides, whereas there was no effect of apoB overexpression on cardiac cholesterol or phospholipid content. The assessments of cardiac BNP gene expression as well as biomechanical cardiac function suggested that a diabetes-specific affection of the heart in STZ-treated male mice is attenuated by a normalization of cardiac triglyceride stores. In apoB transgenic mice, several echocardiographic measures reflecting both systolic and diastolic function were either unaffected by STZ-induced diabetes or less affected than in wild type mice. This finding implies that lipoprotein secretion from the heart plays an integrated physiological role in cardiac function. Still, some parameters of systolic function during dobutamine stress were decreased by STZ treatment in both wild type and apoB transgenic mice. This indicates that the decline in systolic function of STZ-treated mice was not entirely related to cardiac triglyceride accumulation. A causal link of cardiac triglyceride accumulation and cardiac dysfunction has been proposed recently (8Unger R.H. Orci L. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 312-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). The normalization of cardiac triglycerides in genetically obese fa/fa rats with a peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ agonist attenuates the development of cardiac dysfunction (30Zhou Y.T. Grayburn P. Karim A. Shimabukuro M. Higa M. Baetens D. Orci L. Unger R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 1784-1789Crossref PubMed Scopus (1079) Google Scholar). Cardiac overexpression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α (31Finck B.N. Lehman J.J. Leone T.C. Welch M.J. Bennett M.J. Kovacs A. Han X. Gross R.W. Kozak R. Lopaschuk G.D. Kelly D.P. J.

Schaffer J.E. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 107: 813-822Crossref PubMed Scopus (622) Google Scholar) in mouse hearts both confer an increase in triglyceride stores and a concomitant decrease of cardiac function. This study supports the idea that a normalization of cardiac triglyceride stores improves cardiac function in diabetic mice. This conclusion may add evidence to an emerging concept (8Unger R.H. Orci L. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 312-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar, 32Chiu H.C. Kovacs A. Ford D.A. Hsu F.F. Garcia R. Herrero P. Saffitz J.E. Schaffer J.E. J. Clin.

Disord. 2000; 24, Suppl. 4: S28-S32Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar) that the accumulation of neutral lipids in cardiac myocytes causes “lipotoxic” heart disease. It is also conceivable that the accelerated removal of triglycerides by increased lipoprotein secretion affects intracellular fluxes of free fatty acids or perhaps cardiac fuel substrate utilization. An effect of apoB overexpression on intracellular intermediate metabolites in cardiomyocytes is compatible with the finding that cardiac free glycerol levels were increased in control apoB transgenic mice versus control wild type. In conclusion, this study supports the idea that lipoprotein formation by the heart plays an integrated role in cardiac lipid homeostasis and affects cardiac physiology in diabetic mice.

Questions remain as to why the mitochondria are required in that scenario. We investigated the molecular events that determined the need for the mitochondria by using an in vivo model of anti-Fas-induced hepatocyte apoptosis. In wild-type mice, Fas stimulation resulted in normal activation of caspase-3, with the generation of the active p19-p12 complex. Inbid-deficient mice, caspase-3 activation was arrested after the initial cleavage at Asp175. This allowed the generation of the p12 small subunit, but the p20 large subunit could not be further processed to the p19 subunit. The p20-p12 complex generated by Fas stimulation in bid-deficient hepatocytes was inactive, arresting the death program. Failure of p20/p12 caspase-3 to mature and to exhibit activity was because of the inhibition by the inhibitor-of-apoptosis proteins (IAPs), such as XIAP, and also to a low caspase-8 activity. This block could be overcome in wild-type mice by two mechanisms. Smac was released from mitochondria early following Fas activation and was competitively bound to the IAPs to reverse their effects. XIAP could also be cleaved, and this occurred later and was likely mediated by enhanced caspase activities. Both mechanisms were dependent on Bid and thus were not operative inbid-deficient hepatocytes. In conclusion, mitochondrial activation by Bid is required for reversing the IAP inhibition through Smac release. It is also required for the alternative activation of caspases through cytochrome c release, as demonstrated previously. Together, these events ensure a successful progression of the death program initiated by the death receptor activation in the hepatocyte.

There are two common signaling pathways that lead to the activation of the apoptosis-executing molecules, the caspases. In the death receptor pathway (the extrinsic pathway), binding of the death receptors (Fas, TNF1receptor 1, etc.) by the ligands (FasL, TNFα, etc.) or by the antagonist antibodies leads to the recruitment of adaptor molecules (FADD, TNF receptor 1-associated death domain protein (TRADD), etc.) and an initiator caspase, caspase-8, to the receptor complex.

Whether the death program is activated through the extrinsic or intrinsic pathway is determined not only by the type of death signal but also by the type of cell responding to the signals. For example, groups of certain tumor cell lines of lymphoid origin respond to the death receptor activation with different mechanisms. Whereas one group of cell lines (type I) can be promptly killed with the quick mobilization of FADD and caspase-8 in their receptor complex, the other group of cell lines (type II) is quite slow to mobilize the key molecules in response to the same treatment (25Scaffidi C.

Most interesting, overexpression of Bcl-2 or Bcl-xL, suppressors of the intrinsic pathway, can block the extrinsic pathway in type II cells but not in type I cells, suggesting that in type II cells the death signal is mainly transmitted through the intrinsic pathway (25Scaffidi C.

Thus there is apparently a cross-talk between the two death pathways. One mechanism for this cross-talk was revealed in the study of a pro-death Bcl-2 family protein, Bid, which was cloned on the basis of its interactions with other Bcl-2 family proteins (27Wang K. Yin X.M. Chao D.T. Milliman C.L. Korsmeyer S.J. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2859-2869Crossref PubMed Scopus (808) Google Scholar) and its cleavage by caspases (28Luo X. Budihardjo I. Zou H. Slaughter C.

As a result, a truncated Bid (tBid) is generated, which can then efficiently bind to the mitochondria and activate the intrinsic pathway (28Luo X. Budihardjo I. Zou H. Slaughter C. Wang X.

The significance of this cross-talk between the intrinsic and extrinsic pathways mediated by Bid seems dependent on cell type. Reminiscent of the original definition of type I and type II lymphocytes, in vivo studies comparing wild-type and bid-deficient mice indicated that cross-talk was critical for the death receptor activation-induced apoptosis in hepatocytes but not in thymocytes (31Yin X.M. Wang K. Gross A. Zhao Y. Zinkel S. Klocke B. Roth K.A. Korsmeyer S.J. Nature. 1999; 400: 886-891Crossref PubMed Scopus (867) Google Scholar,38Zhao Y., Li, S. Childs E.E. Kuharsky D.K. Yin X.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 27432-27440Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). In this scenario, the hepatocyte behaves more like a type II cell. The question remains why the mitochondrial pathway plays a much more significant role in the type II cell, such as the hepatocyte. We hypothesized that the extrinsic pathway in the hepatocyte was weak and inhibited so that, in the absence of mitochondrial activation, the death signals could not be completely transmitted from the death receptor complex to the effector caspases. Toward this end, we found that in the absence of Bid, and thus in the absence of mitochondrial activation, in vivo engagement of Fas receptors on hepatocytes could not lead to a full processing of caspase-3 and was accompanied by a very low caspase activity. This was most likely due to the inhibition by the IAP molecules, such as XIAP, as well as to a constitutively low caspase-8 activity. In wild-type animals, Bid could still be cleaved, and tBid induced the mitochondrial release of Smac, which antagonized the effects of XIAP. In addition, XIAP was also cleaved in a Bid-dependent fashion. These effects, together with the cytochrome c-directed caspase activation, led to a full recovery of caspase-3 activity. We concluded that type II cells, such as hepatocytes, require the activation of the intrinsic pathway in order to overcome the suppression of the extrinsic pathway by the IAP molecules. Furthermore, the molecular decision as to which pathway to employ after death receptor engagement seems to be dependent on the stoichiometric relationship among the activated caspase-8, IAPs, and Bid. Mice deficient in bid were established by gene targeting and had been backcrossed to the C57BL/6 background for 12 generations (31Yin X.M. Wang K. Gross A. Zhao Y. Zinkel S. Klocke B. Roth K.A.

They were maintained as homozygotes in a specific pathogen-free facility in compliance with National Institutes of Health and University of Pittsburgh policies. The following antibodies were used: anti-cytochrome c (BD PharMingen), anti-mouse caspase-3 (BD Transduction Laboratories), anti-caspase-8 (Stressgen), anti-caspase-9 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-XIAP (Transduction Laboratories), anti-Bid (27Wang K. Yin X.M. Chao D.T. Milliman C.L. Korsmeyer S.J. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2859-2869Crossref PubMed Scopus (808) Google Scholar), anti-Smac (8Du C. Fang M., Li, Y., Li, L. Wang X. Cell. 2000; 102: 33-42Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2941) Google Scholar), and anti-mouse FADD (39Zhang J. Winoto A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2756-2763Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Activated recombinant caspase-8 was purchased from BD PharMingen. Recombinant tBid, GST-XIAP (amino acids 1–358), and matured p25 Smac were prepared as described previously (18Chai J., Du, C., Wu, J.W. Kyin S. Wang X. Shi Y. Nature. 2000; 406: 855-862Crossref PubMed Scopus (716) Google Scholar,36Kim T.H. Zhao Y. Barber M.J. Kuharsky D.K. Yin X.M. J. Biol.

Mice were intravenously administered an anti-Fas antibody (clone Jo-2, BD PharMingen,) as specified in the figure legends. Liver homogenates were prepared and sub-fractionated as described previously (30Gross A. Yin X.M. Wang K. Wei M.C. Jockel J. Milliman C. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Korsmeyer S.J. J. Biol.

Briefly, each liver was homogenized in 6 ml of Buffer A (200 mm mannitol, 70 mm sucrose, 1 mm EGTA, 10 mm HEPES, 0.1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, pH 7.2) with a Wheaten Dounce glass homogenizer (type B pestle, twice) and centrifuged at 4 °C for 10 min at 600 × g (Sorvall RC5C, SS34). The supernatants were further centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 15 min. The supernatants were collected as the cytosol fraction. The pellet (heavy membranes or mitochondria) was washed once again in Buffer A by centrifugation at 600 × g for 5 min to remove any contaminating particles and then recovered by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 15 min. The isolated mitochondria were resuspended in Buffer A for Western blot analysis or in Buffer B (250 mm sucrose, 10 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.5, 2 mm KH2PO4, 5 mm sodium succinate, 25 μm EGTA, 0.1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) for functional assay. Liver cytosol (100 μg) or mitochondria (50 μg) were separated by a 12% SDS-PAGE followed by transfer to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes and blotted with various antibodies as indicated. Blots were developed by an ECL method (Pierce). Twenty (for caspase-3) or 50 μg (for caspase-8) of cytosol were incubated with 20 μmsite-specific tetrapeptide substrates (Ac-IETD-AFC for caspase-8, BD PharMingen; Ac-DEVD-AFC for caspase-3, Calbiochem) in a caspase assay buffer (20 mm PIPES, 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% (w/v) CHAPS, 10% (w/v) sucrose, pH 7.2) in a final volume of 200 μl. The release of the fluorogenic group AFC was determined after 1 h of incubation at 30 °C by a fluorescence spectrometer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences LS50-B) at the excitation wavelength of 405 nm and emission wavelength of 500 nm. The signals representative of caspase activities were corrected for the background. Liver cytosol (2–4 μg/μl) was incubated with activated recombinant caspase-8 (0.1–2 ng/μl, BD PharMingen) at 30 °C for 30–120 min. In some experiments, recombinant GST-XIAP proteins and/or Smac proteins were also added at designated concentrations. An aliquot of the cytosol (10 μg) was then separated on a 12% SDS-PAGE followed by Western blotting with the anti-caspase-3 antibody (Transduction Laboratories) or the anti-Bid antibody (27Wang K. Yin X.M. Chao D.T. Milliman C.L. Korsmeyer S.J. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2859-2869Crossref PubMed Scopus (808) Google Scholar). Another aliquot of cytosol containing 20–50 μg of proteins was analyzed for caspase-3 or caspase-8 activity, respectively. This was essentially performed as described previously (36Kim T.H. Zhao Y. Barber M.J. Kuharsky D.K. Yin X.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 39474-39481Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Briefly, recombinant tBid at various concentrations were admixed with 100 μg of hepatocyte mitochondria (2 mg/ml) in Buffer B with 4 mm MgCl2. After incubation at 30 °C for 60 min, the supernatants were separated from the mitochondria by centrifugation at 16,000 × g at 4 °C for 10 min (Biofuge Fresco, Heraeus Instruments, Inc.). Both fractions were then subjected to a 12% SDS-PAGE followed by Western blotting with the anti-Smac or the anti-cytochrome c antibody. The blots were visualized by the ECL method. Wild-type mice were treated with various doses of anti-Fas antibodies for different durations as indicated in the figure legends. Hepatic lysates were prepared in Buffer C (142.5 mm NaCl, 50 mmTris-HCl, 1 μm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40 with a mixture of protease inhibitors) with a Wheaten Dounce glass homogenizer (type B pestle). After 30 min of incubation with rotation, the lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 7,000 × g for 10 min. The supernatants were collected, and about 0.5 ml of each sample (400 μg/ml) was mixed with 30 μl of pre-swollen protein G-agarose bead mixture (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, CA) followed by incubation at 4 °C for 1 h. The beads were then precipitated and washed with Buffer C three times and then resuspended in the gel-loading buffer for SDS-PAGE. Western blot was conducted with the anti-FADD antibody or anti-caspase-8 antibody. Early work (40Woo M. Hakem A. Elia A.J. Hakem R. Duncan G.S. Patterson B.J. Mak T.W. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 4909-4916PubMed Google Scholar, 41Zheng T.S. Hunot S. Kuida K. Momoi T. Srinivasan A. Nicholson D.W. Lazebnik Y. Flavell R.A. Nat. Med. 2000; 6: 1241-1247Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar) has shown that caspase-3 is the main effector caspase in the liver responsible for Fas activation-induced hepatocyte apoptosis. However, deletion of caspase-3 can induce a compensatory increase of other caspases. Thuscaspase 3 −/− mice are still susceptible to this type of apoptosis (40Woo M. Hakem A. Elia A.J. Hakem R. Duncan G.S. Patterson B.J. Mak T.W. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 4909-4916PubMed Google Scholar, 41Zheng T.S. Hunot S. Kuida K. Momoi T. Srinivasan A. Nicholson D.W. Lazebnik Y. Flavell R.A. Nat. Med. 2000; 6: 1241-1247Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). In addition, liver damage also depends greatly on Bid-mediated mitochondrial activation, so in the absence of Bid and mitochondrial activation the activity of caspase-3 is low and the apoptosis is greatly reduced (31Yin X.M. Wang K. Gross A. Zhao Y. Zinkel S. Klocke B. Roth K.A. Korsmeyer S.J. Nature. 1999; 400: 886-891Crossref PubMed Scopus (867) Google Scholar). However, because caspase-8 has been shown to be able to activate caspase-3 directly in vitro(2Muzio M. Salvesen G.S. Dixit V. J. Biol.

We examined this dilemma by comparing caspase-3 activation in wild-type andbid-deficient mice following Fas stimulation. Mice were sacrificed at 1–8 h after the anti-Fas treatment. Liver homogenates were fractionated into the cytosol and the heavy membrane fraction enriched in mitochondria. Western blot with an anti-caspase-3 antibody recognizing the zymogen and the large subunit of the enzyme revealed that caspase-3 was activated about 2 h after the treatment in wild-type livers. The large subunits included both the p20 and p19 form; the latter was a further cleaved, matured form of the former (Fig. 1A). The p17 form of the large subunit was not observed in the current regime, perhaps due to a slow transition from the p19 as reported previously (3Stennicke H.R. Jurgensmeier J.M. Shin H. Deveraux Q. Wolf B.B. Yang X. Zhou Q. Ellerby H.M. Ellerby L.M. Bredesen D. Green D.R. Reed J.C. Froelich C.J. Salvesen G.S. J. Biol.

However, in the bid-deficient liver, only the p20 subunit was detected, although it appeared in the same time frame as in the wild-type liver. The determination of the size of the large subunits was facilitated with the use of fully processed recombinant caspase-3 composed of p17 and p12 subunits (data not shown).

We demonstrated recently that AR mRNA stability is a major determinant of AR gene expression in prostate and breast cancer cells and that androgens differentially regulate AR mRNA decay dependent on cell type (Yeap, B.

In transfection studies with LNCaP human prostate cancer cells, the AR UC-rich region reduced expression of a luciferase reporter gene. The AR UC-rich region was a target for cytoplasmic and nuclear RNA-binding proteins from human prostate and breast cancer cells as well as human testicular and breast cancer tissue. One of these proteins is HuR, a ubiquitously expressed member of the Elav/Hu family of RNA-binding proteins involved in the stabilization of several mRNAs. Poly(C)-binding protein-1 and -2 (CP1 and CP2), previously implicated in the control of mRNA turnover and translation, also bound avidly to the UC-rich region. Mutational analysis of the UC-rich region identified specific binding motifs for both HuR and the CPs. HuR and CP1 bound simultaneously to the UC-rich RNA and in a cooperative manner.

The binding of HuR, CP1, and CP2 to AR mRNA suggests a role for each of these proteins in the post-transcriptional regulation of AR expression in cancer cells. dihydrotestosterone androgen receptor wild-type androgen receptor adenylate/uridylate-rich element untranslated region poly(C)-binding protein epidermal growth factor receptor dithiothreitol phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride glutathione S-transferase 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid RNA electrophoretic mobility shift assay cytoplasmic extraction buffer UV cross-linking UV cross-linking/immunoprecipitation RNA·protein complex ribonucleoprotein The interaction between androgens such as dihydrotestosterone (DHT)1 and the androgen receptor (AR) plays a crucial role in the evolution of human prostate cancer, and modulation of this interaction represents a major therapeutic strategy (1Jenster G. Semin. Oncol. 1999; 26: 407-421PubMed Google Scholar, 2Goktas S. Crawford E.D. Semin. Oncol. 1999; 26: 162-173PubMed Google Scholar). The biological action of androgen is mediated via binding to the AR, a member of the nuclear hormone receptor family of transcription factors that regulate expression of androgen-responsive genes (3Chang C. Saltzman A. Yeh S. Young W. Keller E. Lee H.-J. Wang C. Mizokami A. Crit. Rev. Eukaryotic Gene Expression. 1995; 5: 97-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). Androgens promote the growth of prostate cancer cells, and androgen deprivation results in regression of most prostate cancers, although this effect is eventually abrogated by the emergence of androgen-insensitive disease. In contrast, AR expression correlates with better clinical outcome in human breast cancer (4Soreide J.A. Lea O.A. Varhaug J.E. Skarstein A. Kvinnsland S. Eur. J. Surg. Oncol. 1992; 18: 112-118PubMed Google Scholar, 5Birrell S.N. Roder D.M. Horsfall D.J. Bentel J.M. Tilley W.D. J. Clin. Oncol. 1995; 13: 1572-1577Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), and androgens have been shown to inhibit the growth of breast cancer cells expressing the AR (6Szelei J. Jimenez J. Sotto A.M. Luizzi M.F. Sonnenschein C. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 1406-1412Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 7Bentel J.M. Birrell S.N. Pickering M.A. Holds D.J. Horsfall D.J. Tilley W.D. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1999; 154: 11-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). To better understand the mechanisms underlying the expression of the AR gene, we recently utilized LNCaP prostate cancer cells and MDA453 breast cancer cells to determine the relative importance of transcriptional and post-transcriptional mechanisms in androgen-regulated AR gene expression (8Yeap B.B. Krueger R.G. Leedman P.J. Endocrinology. 1999; 140: 3282-3291Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). In LNCaP cells, androgens down-regulate transcription of the AR gene, but stabilize AR mRNA. In MDA453 cells, androgens produce rapid destabilization of AR mRNA in the absence of transcriptional change. These data suggest an important role for post-transcriptional events (in particular, AR mRNA turnover) in the regulation of AR gene expression in prostate and breast cancer cells. We therefore decided to investigate the mechanisms regulating AR mRNA stability. mRNA turnover is a central mechanism in the control of gene expression (9Peltz S.W. Brewer G. Bernstein P. Hart P.A. Ross J. Crit. Rev. Eukaryotic Gene Expression. 1991; 1: 99-126PubMed Google Scholar), where interactions between specific sequences within mRNA (cis-acting elements) and cellular RNA-binding proteins (trans-acting factors) regulate ribonuclease action and subsequent mRNA decay rates. Several cis-acting elements have been described, and the best characterized is the adenylate/uridylate (AU)-rich element (ARE). The ARE most often resides in the 3′-untranslated region (3′-UTR) and contains AUUUA pentamers and/or UUAUUUA(U/A)(U/A) nonamers (10Lagnado C.A. Brown C.Y. Goodall G.J. Mol. Cell.

AREs have been implicated in regulating the stability of labile cytokine and growth factor mRNAs via interactions with RNA-binding proteins such as the 44-kDa AU-binding factor (13Zhang W.

HuR is a ubiquitously expressed member of the Elav/Hu family of RNA-binding proteins, whose other members include Hel-N1, HuC, and HuD (17Keene J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 5-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). HuR has been shown to stabilize other mRNAs, including vascular endothelial growth factor (18Levy N.S. Chung S. Furneaux H. Levy A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6417-6423Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar) and p21WAF1 (19Wang W. Furneaux H. Cheng H. Caldwell M.C. Hutter D. Liu Y. Holbrook N. Gorospe M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 760-769Crossref PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar). In addition, HuR functions as a nuclear/cytoplasmic transport protein for mRNAs (17Keene J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 5-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar, 20Fan X.C. Steitz J.A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3448-3460Crossref PubMed Scopus (744) Google Scholar, 21Fan X.C. Steitz J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad.

Other non-ARE cis-elements have been described, including the U-rich polypyrimidine tract with a C(U)nC motif (23Bothwell A.L.M. Ballard D.W. Philbrick W.M. Lindwall G. Maher S.E. Bridgett M.M. Jamison S.F. Garcia-Blanco M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 24657-24663Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For example, a C(U)nC motif is present within a region of c-myc mRNA known to bind HuD, another member of the Elav/Hu family (24Chung S. Eckrich M. Perrone-Biozerozz N. Kohn D.T. Furneaux H. J. Biol.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3564-3569Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). In addition, a C-richcis-element with a consensus CCUCC or CCCUCCC sequence has been identified in a variety of mRNAs, including α-globin and erythropoietin (26Weiss I.M. Liebhaber S.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2457-2465Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 27Chkheidze A.N. Lyakhov D.L. Makeyev A.V. Morales J. Kong J. Liebhaber S.A. Mol. Cell.

This C-rich element is the target for several poly(C)-binding proteins (CPs; ∼43 kDa) (27Chkheidze A.N. Lyakhov D.L. Makeyev A.V. Morales J. Kong J. Liebhaber S.A. Mol. Cell.

The CPs have been implicated in both regulation of mRNA stability and translation initiation (27Chkheidze A.N. Lyakhov D.L. Makeyev A.V. Morales J. Kong J. Liebhaber S.A. Mol. Cell.

Higgs H.N. Larson R.E. French F.S. Wilson E.W. Mol. Endocrinol. 1988; 2: 1265-1275Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar). However, it does have a UC-rich region in the proximal 3′-UTR that shares significant homology with the U- and C-rich sequences described above and that could act as a cis-element and interact with RNA-binding proteins. Here, we show that this highly conserved UC-richcis-element binds several cytoplasmic and nuclear proteins from LNCaP and MDA453 cells as well as from human testicular and breast cancer extracts. One of these trans-acting factors is HuR. Two other proteins interacting with this region are poly(C)-binding protein-1 and -2 (CP1 and CP2). These are the first described AR mRNA-binding proteins. Furthermore, these proteins bind to the UC-rich region simultaneously, and each is closely associated with AR mRNA in LNCaP prostate cancer cells. Thus, the UC-rich region of AR mRNA is a target for at least three RNA-binding proteins that may have significant impact on the mRNA stability and/or translation of AR mRNA. Plasmid pARWt contains the UC-rich region of the human AR mRNA (5′-CTGGGCTTTTTTTTTCTCTTTCTCTCCTTTCTTTTTCTTCTTCCCTCCCTA-3′, 51 nucleotides from nucleotides 3275 to 3325 of the sequence of Lubahnet al. (32Lubahn D.B. Joseph D.R. Sar M. Tan J. Higgs H.N. Larson R.E. French F.S. Wilson E.W. Mol.

A series of mutations in pBluescript II KS+ (Mut-1–7; see Fig. 1B) were generated in the wild-type AR (ARWt) sequence by PCR. pRSV-Luc+UC contains the 51-nucleotide AR mRNA sequence detailed above cloned into the HpaI site of pRSV-Luc (33De Wet J.R. Wood K.V. DeLuca M. Helinski D.R. Subramani S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 725-737Crossref PubMed Scopus (2478) Google Scholar). The c-fos HuD sequence (5′-ATATTTATATTTTTATTTTATTTTTTT-3′) (34Ma W.-J. Cheng S. Campbell C. Wright A. Furneaux H. J. Biol.

HuR domains I (residues 2–106), I+II (residues 2–188), and III were cloned pGEX-4T1 (Amersham Biosciences). Full-length coding region constructs for CP1 and CP2 (from Dr. Mike Kiledjian) were cloned into pGEX-4T2. Purified rabbit antibodies against CP1 and CP2 (FF1 and FF3, respectively) were from Dr. Stephen Liebhaber (27Chkheidze A.N. Lyakhov D.L. Makeyev A.V. Morales J. Kong J. Liebhaber S.A. Mol. Cell.

Blood. 1999; 93: 2111-2120Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) were also used. A rabbit polyclonal antibody to human p21WAF1 (PC55, Oncogene Research Products, Cambridge MA) and a sheep polyclonal antibody to the human epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) (06-1229, Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., Lake Placid, NY) were also used. pIRE contains a conserved ferritin iron-responsive element cloned into pBluescript KS+ (35Leedman P.J.

Rutter W.J. Science. 1985; 230: 912-916Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). LNCaP (American Type Culture Collection CRL-1740), DU145 (HTB-81), and MDA453 (HTB-131) cells were grown in phenol red-free RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (dextran-charcoal stripped for experiments), 50 units/ml penicillin G, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin (Invitrogen). DHT (Sigma) was used at a final concentration of 10 nm in cell culture media. Human normal testicular and breast cancer tissue was obtained from fresh surgical specimens after the required pathological examination was performed. Tissues were stored at −80 °C until used for preparation of cytoplasmic extracts. LNCaP cells were grown to 70% confluence prior to transfection with 2 μg of either pRSV-Luc or pRSV-Luc+UC using FuGENE 6 transfection reagent (Roche Molecular Biochemicals GmbH, Mannheim, Germany). Cells were cotransfected simultaneously with 0.5 μg of pRSV-β-gal as a transfection control. Luciferase assays were performed in a Berthold AutoLumat LB953 luminometer. β-Galactosidase activity was assayed as previously described (37Rosenthal N. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 152: 704-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar). Cytoplasmic extracts from LNCaP, DU145, and MDA453 cells were prepared as previously described (38Thomson A.M.

Human testicular and breast cancer tissue was homogenized in buffer containing 0.32 m sucrose, 3 mmMgCl2, 40 mm KCl, 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 1 mm DTT, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 0.5 mmPMSF, and 10 μg/ml leupeptin using a sterile Dounce homogenizer. The homogenate was centrifuged at 4 °C for 10 min at 1000 ×g, and the resultant supernatant was centrifuged again at 4 °C for 1 h at 130,000 × g, followed by storage of the final supernatant in aliquots at −80 °C. Protein concentrations were estimated by the Bradford method (Bio-Rad). Nuclear extracts were prepared using a modified method of Ausubel et al. (40Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Short Protocols in Molecular Biology. 2nd Ed. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1992: 12.3-12.4Google Scholar). Briefly, LNCaP cells were washed, suspended in cold phosphate-buffered saline, and centrifuged at 4 °C for 5 min at 1800 ×g. The pellet was resuspended twice in hypotonic buffer (10 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm KCl, 0.2 mm PMSF, and 0.5 mmDTT) and kept on ice for 10 min. The cell suspension was homogenized with 10 strokes of a Dounce homogenizer and centrifuged at 4 °C for 15 min at 1500 × g. The resultant pellet of nuclei was resuspended directly in buffer containing 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 25% glycerol, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.5m KCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.2 mm PMSF, and 0.2 mm DTT and kept on ice for 30 min with regular mixing. An equal volume of buffer containing 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 25% glycerol, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.2 mm PMSF, and 0.2 mmDTT was added, followed by centrifugation at 4 °C for 30 min at 14,000 × g. The protein concentration of the supernatant was determined as described above prior to storage in aliquots at −80 °C. GST-HuR, GST-CP1, and GST-CP2 were prepared using Escherichia coliDH5α cells transformed with pGEX-HuR, pGEX-CP1, and pGEX-CP2, respectively. After induction at A600 = 0.6 with 0.5 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside, GST fusion protein was purified from bacteria lysed in 10 mm Tris (pH 7.8), 0.5 mm EDTA, 100 mm glucose, 0.4 mg/ml lysozyme, 0.13% Triton X-100, 0.5 mm PMSF, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 μg/ml leupeptin using glutathione beads (Sigma). The recombinant fusion protein was eluted with reduced glutathione after serial washes in buffer containing 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.6), 100 mm KCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 20% glycerol, 1 mm DTT, 0.5 mm PMSF, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, and 25 mm glutathione. GST fusion proteins were quantified; their purity was ascertained by SDS-PAGE; and they were stored in aliquots at −80 °C. Recombinant HuR domains I and I+II were prepared similarly to the GST-HuR fusion protein described above. Each construct was cloned into pGEX-4T1 and expressed in E. coli BL21-Codon Plus (Stratagene). After induction with 0.5 mmisopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside toA600 = 0.8, cells were resuspended in 50 mm Tris (pH 7.8), 200 mm NaCl, 1 mmEDTA, and 2 mm PMSF. Cells containing HuR domain III were resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.3), 1 mmEDTA, 0.5% Triton X-100, and 2 mm PMSF. Cells were lysed with a French press; the lysate was centrifuged at 15,000 ×g for 30 min; and GST fusion proteins were purified using glutathione-agarose beads with eight washes in the resuspension buffer without PMSF and EDTA. HuR fragments were cleaved from GST by the addition of 2.5 units/ml thrombin. HuR domain I was further purified by size-exclusion chromatography. The protein solution was dialyzed against 1000 times the volume of 50 mm Tris (pH 7.8) and applied to a Bio-Rad Bio-Prep SE 1000/17 column equilibrated in the same buffer. HuR domain I+II was further purified by size-exclusion and cation-exchange chromatography. The protein solution was dialyzed against 1000 times the volume of 50 mm MES (pH 6.2) and applied to the Bio-Rad Bio-Prep SE 1000/17 column equilibrated in the same buffer. The HuR domain I+II preparation was then eluted from a Bio-Rad UNO S6 cation-exchange column with a linear gradient at 40% 50 mm MES (pH 6.2) and 1 m KCl. CP1 was prepared as previously described by Kiledjian et al.(41Kiledjian M. Day N. Trifillis P. Methods (Duluth). 1999; 17: 84-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Linearized templates, ARWt, various mutant AR probes, and c-fosHuD were used in transcription reactions containing [32P]UTP (3000 Ci/mmol; Amersham Biosciences) with T7 RNA polymerase (Invitrogen) as described (38Thomson A.M.

REMSA was performed as described previously (35Leedman P.J. Stein A.R. Chin W.W. Rogers J.T. J. Biol.

For competition assays, unlabeled RNA transcripts (75–450 ng) or RNA homopolymers (75–300 ng; poly(U), poly(C), poly(A), Amersham Biosciences) were added to the reaction mixture for 10 min at 22 °C prior to incubation with labeled RNA probe. When REMSA was performed with GST fusion protein (∼100–400 ng), the CEB buffer contained 4 mm DTT, MnCl2, ZnCl2, and 10 mm sodium orthovanadate. For antibody supershifts with cytoplasmic and nuclear extracts, 1 μl of anti-HuR (∼7 mg/ml) or 0.5–1.0 μl of anti-CP (∼2 mg/ml) antibody was added after the RNase T1 step. For antibody supershifts of labeled riboprobe·GST fusion protein complexes, the GST fusion proteins were incubated with the CEB buffer and 150 μg of heparin for 10 min at 22 °C prior to incubation with labeled riboprobe. The antibody was then added, and the reaction was incubated on ice for 1 h and analyzed by PAGE as described above. The method for the UV cross-linking (UVXL) assay was as described (39Balmer L.A. Beveridge D.J. Jazayeri J.A. Thomson A.M. Walker C.E. Leedman P.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 2070-2084Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 42Thomson A.M. Rogers J.T. Leedman P.J. J. Biol.

For UV cross-linking/immunoprecipitation (UVXL/IP) studies, 50–100 μg of cytoplasmic extract and 500,000 cpm of probe were used, and the reaction volume was increased to 300 μl by addition of the CEB buffer after the RNase A incubation step. Two μl of anti-HuR or 1.5 μl of anti-CP1 or anti-CP2 antibody was added, and the mixture was rotated at 4 °C for 1 h. Protein G-Sepharose (30 μl; Sigma) was used to precipitate the anti-HuR antibody·RNA·protein complexes, and protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) for the anti-CP antibody complexes. The RNA·protein complexes were resolved by 8.5% SDS-PAGE and visualized using a PhosphorImager. LNCaP or MDA453 cells were grown to 70% confluence in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum in 75-cm2 flasks. The cells were harvested, washed twice with cold phosphate-buffered saline, and then lysed for 40 min on ice in 1.5 ml of CEB buffer containing standard protein inhibitors and 100 units of RNaseOUT (Invitrogen). The lysed cells were centrifuged at 12,000 ×g for 10 min at 4 °C, and 0.75 ml of supernatant was added to 10 μg of anti-HuR, anti-CP1, anti-CP2, or anti-p21WAF1 antibody. A control tube containing only lysate was also prepared. After incubation at 4 °C for 30 min, 5 μg each of protein A and protein G beads were added to all tubes, which were gently mixed for a further 30 min at 4 °C. The tubes were centrifuged at 2000 × g for 2 min, and the supernatants were removed for RNA extraction. The precipitated beads were washed with cold CEB buffer (5 × 1 ml) and then RNA-extracted with TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). Reverse transcription with oligo(dT) primer was performed on the extracted RNA using standard procedures. PCR was performed for 35 cycles with denaturation at 95 °C, annealing at 58 °C, and extension at 72 °C with primers 5′-ATGAACTTCGAATGAACTACATCAAGG-3′ and 5′-GGAACATGTTCATGACAGACTGTAC-3′ from exons 7 and 8 of the ARwt sequence. The PCR products were resolved on a 1% agarose gel. Transfection data are shown as means ± S.E. Statistical analysis was performed using Student's ttest with a p value of <0.05 regarded as significant. Based on our recent demonstration that AR mRNA stability plays an important role in the regulation of AR gene expression in at least two cancer cell types (prostate and breast) (8Yeap B.B. Krueger R.G. Leedman P.J. Endocrinology. 1999; 140: 3282-3291Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar), we undertook a detailed analysis of the AR mRNA to identify any regulatory cis-elements. Examination of the AR mRNA sequence (32Lubahn D.B. Joseph D.R. Sar M. Tan J. Higgs H.N. Larson R.E. French F.S. Wilson E.W. Mol. Endocrinol. 1988; 2: 1265-1275Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar) revealed there were no AREs present. However, it does contain a UC-rich region in the proximal portion of the 3′-UTR that is similar to other U-rich cis-elements. Interestingly, the location of the 51-nucleotide sequence is between 153 and 156 nucleotides from the stop codon in the human, mouse, and rat species (Fig. 1A). At the 5′-end of this region is a CUGGG motif conserved in all species. In the human AR mRNA, this 5-nucleotide sequence is followed immediately by a C(U)9C sequence, part of a 45-nucleotide UC-rich element comprising 29 uridine and 16 cytidine residues. This sequence is identical to that found in LNCaP cells (GenBankTM/EBI accession number M34233). The C(U)nC motif closely resembles the polypyrimidine tracts of Adenovirus 10 pre-mRNA and phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate RNA bound by the polypyrimidine tract-binding protein (23Bothwell A.L.M. Ballard D.W. Philbrick W.M. Lindwall G. Maher S.E. Bridgett M.M. Jamison S.F. Garcia-Blanco M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 24657-24663Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 1A). Additionally, Hel-N1 (human el av-like neuronal protein-1), a member of the Elav/Hu family of RNA-binding proteins, has been shown to interact with comparable U-rich regions that need not contain classical AUUUA or UUAUUUA(U/A)(U/A) sequences (43Levine T.D. Gao F. King P.H. Andrews L.G. Keene J.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 3494-3504Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). Similarly, a C(U)nC stretch is present within a region of c-myc mRNA known to bind HuD, another member of the Elav/Hu family that is restricted to the central nervous system (24Chung S. Eckrich M.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3564-3569Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1A). Interestingly, the 3′-end of the human AR mRNA UC-rich sequence contains a CCCUCCC motif that is conserved across species (Fig. 1A). The sequence CCUCC is a recognized human consensus RNA-binding site for the CPs (44Wang X. Liebhaber S.A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5040-5051Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Based on these sequence homologies, we reasoned that the AR UC-rich region may function as a cis-element in the regulation of AR mRNA turnover and be a target for the ubiquitous HuR protein and the CPs. To evaluate whether the AR UC-rich region may play a role in AR mRNA turnover, we generated constructs for use in a transfection assay utilizing a luciferase repor"

These acceptor proteins include those involved in modulation of chromatin structure, DNA synthesis, DNA repair, transcription, and cell cycle control. Thus, PARP-1 is believed to play a pivotal role in maintaining genome integrity through modulation of protein-protein and protein-DNA interactions. We previously described the association of PARP-1 with normal mammalian centromeres and human neocentromeres by affinity purification and immunofluorescence. Here we investigated the interaction of this protein with, and poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation of, three constitutive centromere proteins, Cenpa, Cenpb, and Cenpc, and a spindle checkpoint protein, Bub3. Immunoprecipitation and Western blot analyses demonstrate that Cenpa, Cenpb, and Bub3, but not Cenpc, interacted with PARP-1, and are poly(ADP-ribosyl)ated following induction of DNA damage. The results suggest a role of PARP-1 in centromere assembly/disassembly and checkpoint control. Demonstration of PARP-1-binding and poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation in three of the four proteins tested further suggests that many more centromere proteins may behave similarly and implicates PARP-1 as an important regulator of diverse centromere function.

These proteins can be generally classified as constitutive or transient proteins. Constitutive proteins (CENP-A, CENP-B, CENP-C, CENP-G, and CENP-H) reside at the centromere at all stages of the cell cycle, whereas the transient proteins (e.g. CENP-E, CENP-F, INCENP, survivin, MCAK, ZWINT-1, ZW10, MAD-1, MAD-2, BUB1, BUBR1, and BUB3) associate with the centromere during specific stages of the cell cycle.

We have previously shown that PARP-1 accumulates at active mammalian centromeres (including neocentromeres) on metaphase chromosomes (62Earle E. Saxena A. MacDonald A. Hudson D.F. Shaffer L.G. Saffery R. Cancilla M.R. Cutts S.M. Howman E. Choo K.H.A. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2000; 9: 187-194Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As a first step toward deciphering the possible functions of PARP-1 at the centromere, we investigated the association of PARP-1 with several centromere-specific proteins. By co-immunoprecipitation, we have identified CENP-A, CENP-B, and the spindle checkpoint protein, BUB3, but not CENP-C, as binding partners of PARP-1 and have demonstrated poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation of CENP-A, CENP-B, and BUB3 upon induction of DNA damage in cells. All cell lines, including wild-type mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells W9.5, ES-GFP, and ES-Cenpa:GFP, were grown in ES medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Trace Biosciences), leukemia inhibitory factor (ESGRO™, Chemicon International), and β-mercaptoethanol in the presence of 5% CO2 at 37 °C. The ES-GFP cell line was generated by electroporation of ES cells with plasmid pEGFP-C1 (Clonetech), which contained a neomycin-resistant gene and a gene expressing green fluorescent protein (GFP) using a Gene Pulsar transfection apparatus (Bio-Rad). Cells were allowed to grow for 24 h before the addition of 250 μg/ml G418 (Invitrogen) for selection of clones. ES-Cenpa:GFP was a heterozygous ES cell line containing one copy of the mouse Cenpa-GFP fusion protein. This cell line was generated using a targeted knock-in strategy, where GFP was placed at the C terminus of Cenpa. 2P. Kalitsis, E. Earle, K. Fowler, and K. M. A. Choo, manuscript in preparation. For the preparation of nuclear protein extracts, 107 cells were harvested and lysed in ice-cold lysis buffer as previously described (24Hudson D.F. Fowler K.J. Earle E. Saffery R. Kalitsis P.

Exponentially dividing ES cells were harvested and subjected to 10 or 30 Gy of γ irradiation at room temperature in an irradiator using cobalt 60 as a source at a rate of 30 Gy/1.2 min over a period of 0.4–1.2 min. Antisera used in this study included mouse monoclonal anti-PARP-1 antibody C2–10 (Trevigen, Gaithersburg, MD), mouse monoclonal anti-poly(ADP-ribose) antibody (PAR) (Trevigen, Gaithersburg, MD), goat polyclonal anti-GFP antibody (Rockland, Gilbertsville, PA), mouse monoclonal Cenpb 2D-7 (2Earnshaw W.C.

Mol. Genet. 2000; 9: 175-185Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies were purchased from Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories (West Grove, PA). Nuclear protein extracts (500 μl) were incubated with 5 μg of antisera overnight at 4 °C with gentle agitation. The extract/antibody mixtures were then incubated with 125 μl of 50% protein G-Sepharose resuspended in incubation buffer (50 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris, 5 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) containing a mixture of protease inhibitors (Complete™; Roche Molecular Biochemicals) for 3 h at room temperature with constant agitation. The Sepharose beads were then pelleted by centrifugation and washed in immunoprecipitation wash buffer (50 mm Tris, 10 mm EDTA, and 150 mm NaCl), prior to elution with incubation buffer containing 1% SDS. Protein samples were subjected to PAGE on 10% gel and were transferred to Hybond C (AmershamBiosciences) by standard Western blotting. Blots were incubated with the relevant primary antisera at dilutions recommended by the manufacturers. After washing in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween 20, blots were incubated with relevant horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antisera and developed using a chemiluminescence detection kit (Amersham Biosciences). To study the physical interaction of PARP-1 with centromere protein Cenpa, anti-PARP-1 antibody was used to immunoprecipitate the Cenpa:GFP fusion protein from nuclear cell extract prepared from the ES-Cenpa:GFP cell line (see “Materials and Methods”), followed by immunoblotting with anti-GFP antiserum. In a separate study,2 the Cenpa:GFP fusion protein has been shown to localize specifically to mouse centromeres and provide normal centromere function in the ES-Cenpa:GFP heterozygous cell line. A parental ES cell line W9.5 and an ES-GFP cell line overexpressing GFP were included as controls in the immunoprecipitation assays. A band of 43 kDa corresponding to the Cenpa:GFP fusion protein was observed when the ES-Cenpa:GFP nuclear extract, but not extracts from the W9.5 or ES-GFP cells, was used for immunoprecipitation (Fig. 1A). To confirm the specificity of this interaction, anti-GFP antibody was used to immunoprecipitate nuclear extracts from the same cell lines, followed by immunoblotting with anti-PARP-1 antibody. Two bands of ∼113 and 89 kDa, corresponding to the full-length and apoptotic fragments of PARP-1, were detected in the ES-Cenpa:GFP extract alone (Fig. 1B). These results therefore indicate that PARP-1 interacts with Cenpa. Sequence analysis of Cenpa revealed the presence of a consensus motif for poly(ADP-ribose) or PAR-binding domain at the C terminus of the protein, a region also showing high homology to histone H3 (65Pleschke J.M. Kleczkowska H.E. Strohm M. Althaus F.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40974-40980Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar) (Fig.2). We directly investigated the poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation status of Cenpa using anti-PAR antibody in immunoprecipitation experiments. The results indicated no detectable levels of poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation on Cenpa in normal cells (Fig. 1,C and E; 0 Gy). We next investigated the poly(ADP ribosyl)ation status of Cenpa following the induction of DNA damage. W9.5, ES-GFP, and ES-Cenpa:GFP cells were irradiated with either 10 Gy (Fig. 1, C andD) or 30 Gy (Fig. 1E) of γ radiation followed by immediate preparation of nuclear extracts. These were subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-PAR antibody and immunoblotting with anti-GFP antibody. As shown in Fig. 1, C and D, a low but reproducibly detectable level of poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation of the Cenpa:GFP protein was observed following irradiation at 10 Gy. The level of poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation of the Cenpa:GFP protein increased noticeably following irradiation at 30 Gy (Fig. 1E). These results indicate that Cenpa is significantly poly(ADP-ribosyl)ated following high dose irradiation. Anti-PARP-1 and anti-Cenpb antibodies were used to immunoprecipitate nuclear extracts from W9.5 cells, followed by immunoblotting with anti-Cenpb antibody. A band of 80-kDa corresponding to Cenpb was detected in immunoprecipitates using both of the primary antibodies, suggesting an interaction between PARP-1 and Cenpb (Fig.3A). This result was confirmed by performing the reverse experiment in which the anti-PARP-1 and anti-Cenpb immunoprecipitates were immunoblotted with anti-PARP-1 antibody. The results indicated the expected detection of the 113-kDa full-length PARP-1 and 89-kDa apoptotic fragment in both of the samples (Fig. 3B). Sequence analysis also revealed a possible PAR consensus domain in Cenpb (Fig. 2). Direct detection of poly(ADP-ribose) residues in normal W9.5 cells gave a negative result indicating an absence of significant poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation of this protein under normal conditions (Fig.3C, 0 Gy). When the cells were irradiated at 10 Gy before immunoprecipitation with either anti-PAR or anti-Cenpb antibody and immunoblotted with anti-Cenpb antibody, Cenpb was clearly detected in both of the immunoprecipitates (Fig. 3, C and D), indicating that Cenpb was poly(ADP-ribosyl)ated following 10 Gy of γ-radiation. Nuclear extracts from W9.5 cells immunoprecipitated with either anti-PARP-1 or anti-Cenpc antibody were subjected to Western blotting with either anti-PARP-1 antibody (Fig.4A) or anti-Cenpc antibody (Fig. 4B). Both the 113-kDa full-length PARP-1 and the 89-kDa apoptotic fragment were present when anti-PARP-1 antibody was used in the immunoprecipitation but were absent when anti-Cenpc was used instead (Fig. 4A). Similarly, in the reverse experiment, the 140-kDa Cenpc band was not detected in the anti-PARP-1 immunoprecipitate but was observed in the anti-Cenpc immunoprecipitate (Fig. 4B). Analysis of poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation status further indicated that Cenpc was not immunoprecipitated by anti-PAR antibody in nuclear extracts from both the nonirradiated ES cells (Fig.4C; 0 Gy) or cells irradiated with either 10 Gy (Fig. 4,C and D) or 30 Gy (data not shown). These combined results suggest that Cenpc does not interact with PARP-1 and is not poly(ADP-ribosyl)ated at detectable levels even following major DNA damage. In support of the latter conclusion, sequence analysis of Cenpc failed to show the presence of a consensus PAR-binding domain. Bub3 is a mitotic checkpoint protein that has previously been shown to accumulate at the centromere transiently (66Martinez-Exposito M.J. Kaplan K.B. Copeland J. Sorger P.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 8493-8498Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). We were interested in determining the association between PARP-1 and Bub3. When nuclear extracts from W9.5 cells were immunoprecipitated with anti-PARP-1 or anti-Bub3 antibody and probed with anti-Bub3 antibody, a band of 40 kDa corresponding to the Bub3 protein was detected in both of the immunoprecipitates (Fig. 5A). In the reverse experiment, where the same two immunoprecipitates were Western blotted and probed with anti-PARP-1 antibody, the bands corresponding to the full-length and apoptotic forms of PARP-1 were detected (Fig. 5B). These results therefore demonstrate a physical interaction between PARP-1 and Bub3. As with Cenpa and Cenpb, sequence analysis of Bub3 showed the presence of hydrophobic amino acids interspersed with basic amino acids, with an accumulation of basic residues at the N-terminal side of this motif, suggesting the possible presence of a PAR consensus domain (Fig. 2). Use of anti-PAR antibody in immunoprecipitation and Western blot analysis similarly detected no measurable levels of poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation in nonirradiated W9.5 cells (Fig. 5C, 0 Gy). Following 10 Gy of irradiation and upon immunoprecipitation with anti-PAR antibody and immunoblotting with anti-Bub3 antibody, a protein band of 40 kDa corresponding to Bub3 was detected (Fig. 5C), indicating that the Bub3 protein is poly(ADP-ribosyl)ated. The post-translational modification of centromere-associated proteins is now widely accepted as a mechanism for regulating kinetochore assembly and centromere activity.

We have previously demonstrated the association of PARP-1 with mammalian centromeric DNA and active centromeres, providing circumstantial evidence for PARP-1 function at the centromere (62Earle E. Saxena A. MacDonald A. Hudson D.F. Shaffer L.G. Saffery R. Cancilla M.R. Cutts S.M. Howman E. Choo K.H.A. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2000; 9: 187-194Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the present study, we show that PARP-1 interacts directly with Cenpa, Cenpb, and Bub3 under normal conditions. We further demonstrate that whereas no significant poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation of these proteins is measurable in unchallenged cells, all three proteins undergo poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation upon DNA damage induced by γ-irradiation. In contrast, Cenpc does not appear to either interact with PARP-1 or undergo poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation with or without induction of DNA damage. Given that 3 of 4 proteins tested proved to be substrates for PARP-1 binding and poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation and that in excess of 40 proteins have now been shown to associate with the mammalian centromere (1Choo K.H.A.

Here we show that similar to their yeast homologs, human ING1 proteins interact with proteins associated with histone acetyltransferase (HAT) activity, such as TRRAP, PCAF, CBP, and p300. Human ING1 immunocomplexes contain HAT activity, and overexpression of p33ING1b, but not of p47ING1a, induces hyperacetylation of histones H3 and H4, in vitro and in vivo at the single cell level. p47ING1a inhibits histone acetylation in vitro and in vivo and binds the histone deacetylase HDAC1. Finally, we present evidence indicating that p33ING1b affects the degree of physical association between proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) and p300, an association that has been proposed to link DNA repair to chromatin remodeling. Together with the finding that human ING1 proteins bind PCNA in a DNA damage-dependent manner, these data suggest that ING1 proteins provide a direct linkage between DNA repair, apoptosis, and chromatin remodeling via multiple HAT·ING1·PCNA protein complexes.

Finally, we have recently reported that p33ING1b was able to bind to PCNA in a DNA damage-inducible manner that was directly linked to the ability of p33ING1b to induce apoptosis (17Scott M.

Recent studies suggest that human ING1 proteins might be involved in chromatin remodeling functions via physical association with both histone acetyltransferases (HATs)1 and histone deacetylases (HDACs). We initially reported that an ING1 yeast homolog protein, Yng-2, was able to interact with Tra1 (23Loewith R. Meijer M. Lees-Miller S. Riabowol K. Young D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 3807-3816Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar), a protein that is part of HAT complexes such as SAGA and NuA4 (24Sterner D. Berger S. Microbiol. Mol. Biol.

Recently, while Yng-2 was shown to be essential for a Nu4A-mediated HAT activity controlling cell proliferation (26Choy J.S. Tobe B.T. Huh J.H. Kron S.J. J. Biol.

Despite these observations, neither the biochemical role(s) of human ING1 proteins in HAT-related functions nor the biological significance of these functions is fully understood. Furthermore, there is no information published regarding the functions and biological properties of p47ING1a, the other major human isoform of ING1. We have recently reported 2Vieyra, D., Toyama, T., Hara, Y., Boland, D., Johnston, R., and Riabowol, K. (2002) Cancer Res.62, in press.2Vieyra, D., Toyama, T., Hara, Y., Boland, D., Johnston, R., and Riabowol, K. (2002) Cancer Res.62, in press. that different ING1 proteins displayed isoform-dependent apoptotic properties correlated with differential binding affinity to chromatin. These observations led us to ask in the current study: (a) whether human ING1 proteins could physically associate with HATs in the same way as yeast Yng-2 associates with Tra1 (23Loewith R. Meijer M. Lees-Miller S. Riabowol K. Young D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 3807-3816Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar); (b) whether human ING1 immunocomplexes were able to co-precipitate HAT activity; (c) whether different human ING1 isoforms would display differential HAT/HDAC properties correlated with their differential binding to HATs, and if so (d) whether these ING1 biochemical functions correlated with any apoptotic effect. Finally, since p33ING1b was reported to be involved in UV-induced damage responses (30Cheung K.-J., Jr. Mitchell D. Lin P. Li G. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 4974-4977PubMed Google Scholar), and we observed an UV-dependent physical interaction between ING1 proteins and PCNA (17Scott M. Bonnefin P. Vieyra D. Boisvert F.M. Young D. Bazett-Jones D.P. Riabowol K. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 3455-3462Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which was functionally relevant for UV-mediated apoptosis (17Scott M. Bonnefin P. Vieyra D. Boisvert F.M. Young D. Bazett-Jones D.P. Riabowol K. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 3455-3462Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we asked (e) whether ING1 proteins could alter the recently noted association between p300 and PCNA (31Hasan S. Hassa P.O. Imhof R. Hottiger M.O. Nature. 2001; 410: 387-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar), an association that suggests a linkage exists between the repair of UV-damaged DNA and the global regulation of gene expression through histone acetylation (31Hasan S. Hassa P.O. Imhof R. Hottiger M.O. Nature. 2001; 410: 387-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). To address these questions, we have characterized the molecular, biochemical, and biological properties of the two major human ING1 isoforms, p47ING1a and p33ING1b, regarding their roles in functions related to the acetylation of chromatin. We present evidence indicating that similar to yeast ING1 immunocomplexes (23Loewith R. Meijer M. Lees-Miller S. Riabowol K. Young D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 3807-3816Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar), human ING1 immunocomplexes co-precipitate HAT activity. We show that ING1 proteins physically interact with proteins present in complexes containing HAT activity such as CBP, PCAF, p300, and TRRAP. TRRAP, the human homolog of yeast Tra1 which interacts with Yng-2 (23Loewith R. Meijer M. Lees-Miller S. Riabowol K. Young D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 3807-3816Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar), is a 434-kDa c-Myc-interacting nuclear protein that binds the c-Myc amino terminus and the E2F-1 transactivation domain and is an essential co-factor for c-Myc and adenovirus E1A-mediated oncogenic transformation (32McMahon S.B. Wood M.A. Cole M.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 556-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar); TRRAP recruits at least one HAT, hGCN5, to a complex containing c-Myc (24Sterner D. Berger S.

These physical associations, HAT activities and biological properties associated with ING1 proteins, were found in the present study to be isoform-dependent. Overexpression of p33ING1b, but not p47ING1a, induced apoptosis and hyperacetylation of histones H3 and H4 both in vitro and in vivo at a single cell level. Conversely, ectopic up-regulation of p47ING1a resulted in a decrease of the levels of histone acetylation in vitro and in vivo accompanied by no changes in the percentage of apoptosis compared with the empty vector control. In agreement with this observation, we have found that p47ING1a avidly binds to the histone deacetylase HDAC1. Finally, we present evidence indicating that p33ING1baffects the degree of physical association between PCNA and p300, an association that has been proposed to link DNA repair to chromatin remodeling functions (31Hasan S. Hassa P.O. Imhof R. Hottiger M.O. Nature. 2001; 410: 387-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Primary normal human diploid fibroblasts (Hs68; ATCC CRL#1635) and established human glioblastoma cells (SNB19; ATCC CRL#2219) were used in these studies, since Hs68 cells are phenotypically normal, and SNB19 cells have relatively high levels of endogenous ING1 proteins. For blocking HDAC activity (Fig. 6) a bolus of 5 mm sodium butyrate was added to the media for 24 h. For UV-irradiation experiments (Fig. 3), cell plates were rinsed thrice with PBS and exposed to UV (25 J/m2) as described previously (17Scott M. Bonnefin P. Vieyra D. Boisvert F.M. Young D.

Hs68 cells transfected with empty vector (V), p47ING1a (a), or p33ING1b (b) expression constructs were harvested under non-denaturing conditions, and resulting lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-p300 or anti-HDAC1 antibodies. Aliquots of each lysate were isolated and blotted in parallel and served as a positive control for ING1 isoform expression and blotting efficiency as shown in the third panel of A(Lysate). Equal amounts of these immunoprecipitates and the aliquots of lysates were separated by PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose, and blotted with anti-ING1 (A) or anti-PCNA (B) antibodies. Signs “+” and “−” in B refer to whether ING1 transfectants were UV-irradiated with 25 J/m2 (+), which is known to induce an interaction between p33ING1b and PCNA (17Scott M. Bonnefin P. Vieyra D. Boisvert F.M. Young D. Bazett-Jones D.P. Riabowol K. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 3455-3462Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), or not (−). In B, “low b” indicates cells transfected with 20% (2 μg) of the amount of ING1b expression constructs normally used, which led to lower levels of p33ING1b than regular ING1b transfectants (indicated simply as b and see panel C). C and D show control Western blots of lysates, which verify expression of the transfected constructs. Note that while HDAC1 binds to both ING1 proteins, p300 binds strongly to p33ING1b(A). Also note that overexpression of p33ING1bdecreases the amount of PCNA recovered in p300 immunoprecipitates after UV irradiation (B), suggesting that high levels of p33ING1b might physically interfere with the p300-PCNA interaction.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) ING1 cDNAs (8Ma D. Lawless D. Riabowol K. Nat. Genet. 1999; 23: 373PubMed Google Scholar) were subcloned into pCI vector (Promega). All experiments included parallel controls of cells transfected with green fluorescent protein (GFP) (CLONTECH) expression plasmids to determine the proportion of transfected cells. Cells were electroporated as described previously (17Scott M. Bonnefin P. Vieyra D. Boisvert F.M. Young D. Bazett-Jones D.P. Riabowol K. J.

For Western blots (Fig. 6), cells were co-transfected with ING1 and GFP expression constructs at an ING1:GFP plasmid ratio of 4:1. ING1 polyclonal rabbit antibodies (2Garkavtsev I. Kazarov A.

We also used rabbit polyclonal anti-acetyllysine (New England Biolabs #9441S and Upstate Biotech #06-933), anti-CBP (Santa Cruz #sc-583), anti-PCAF (Santa Cruz #sc-6301), anti-p300 (Santa Cruz #sc-584), anti-TRRAP (33McMahon S.B.

Cole M.D. Cell. 1998; 94: 363-374Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar), and goat polyclonal anti-GCN5 (Santa Cruz #sc-6302) antibodies. Both rabbit and mouse anti-ING1 antibodies were raised against a GST-ING1 fusion protein and both recognize native and denatured forms of p33ING1b and p47ING1a, as well as the truncated p24ING1c isoform (8Ma D. Lawless D. Riabowol K. Nat. Genet. 1999; 23: 373PubMed Google Scholar, 35Boland D. Olineck V. Bonnefin P. Vieyra D. Parr E. Riabowol K. Hybridoma. 2000; 19: 161-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The ING1 monoclonals were not frozen before use. Immunoprecipitations used 5 μl of polyclonal or affinity-purified monoclonal anti-ING1 antibodies or 50 μl of concentrated hybridoma supernatant. Western blots were done with 1:500 to 1:1000 dilutions of polyclonal or affinity-purified monoclonal antibodies or with monoclonal hybridoma supernatants diluted 1:1 with the same buffer used to dilute polyclonal antibodies. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies against the appropriate species that were used for Western blotting were from AmershamBiosciences and were all used at 1:1000. Acetylated histones were visualized using antibodies recognizing either diacetylated histone H3 (Upstate #06-599) or histone H4 acetylated on lysine 5 (Upstate #06-759). For assays shown in Fig. 6, cells were co-transfected with ING1 and GFP expression constructs. 48 h later, green cells were sorted by FACS and harvested for Western blot assays. Cells were cultured, microinjected, fixed, and mounted as described (17Scott M. Bonnefin P. Vieyra D. Boisvert F.M. Young D. Bazett-Jones D.P. Riabowol K. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 3455-3462Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 37Riabowol K.T. Draetta G. Brizuela L. Vendre D. Beach D. Cell. 1989; 57: 393-401Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). Acetylated histones were visualized using the above-mentioned antibodies according to the supplier's recommendations. After washing, cells were incubated with the secondary antibodies goat anti-rabbit IgG (Cy3, Chemicon) or goat anti-mouse IgG (Alexa 488, Cedarlane or Cy5, Chemicon). After rinsing, the samples were mounted in 1 μg/ml paraphenylenediamine in PBS, 90% glycerol that also contained the DNA-specific dye DAPI at 1 μg/ml. Imaging was performed using a 14-bit cooled CCD camera (Princeton Instruments) mounted on a Leica DMRE immunofluorescence microscope. For signal density quantitation, the nuclear signal of acetylated histones was integrated for injected and non-injected cells, using ERGOvista v4.4 software. For analysis of apoptosis, cells electroporated with ING1 expression constructs were harvested at 48 h, fixed in 70% ethanol/PBS, on ice for 1 h after which they were subjected to analysis or were kept at −20 °C for no more than 1 week. Before analysis using a Becton Dickinson FACS scanner, ethanol was removed, and cells were resuspended in PBS for 10 min, after which they were pelleted, the PBS was removed, and the cells were treated with staining solution (5 μg/ml propidium iodide (Sigma), 1 mg/ml RNase A (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) in PBS). Analyses of flow cytometry data were done using ModFit software (Verity Inc.). For preparation of lysates from ING1/GFP transfectants (Fig. 6), electroporated cells were harvested at 48 h, rinsed in PBS, and kept alive in media containing 1% serum on ice until being sorted by FACS. Green cells (positive transfectants) were collected, harvested, and their lysates were used for Western blot experiments. Based on our finding that a yeast ING1 homolog physically interacted with Tra1 (23Loewith R. Meijer M. Lees-Miller S. Riabowol K. Young D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 3807-3816Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar), we asked whether human ING1 proteins would be able to bind to TRRAP, the human homolog of Tra1, as well as to other proteins of the GNAT and MYST HAT superfamilies (24Sterner D. Berger S. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2000; 64: 435-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (1397) Google Scholar, 32McMahon S.B. Wood M.A. Cole M.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 556-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar). To test this hypothesis, we made use of immunoprecipitation-Western (IP-W) assays. As shown in Fig.1, A–D, immunoprecipitation of endogenous ING1 proteins from lysates of SNB19 cells co-precipitated several HATs, including TRRAP, PCAF, and CBP. Although we were able to find a weak physical association between ING1 proteins and PCAF, which is a member of the hGNC5 family of HATs (24Sterner D. Berger S. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2000; 64: 435-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (1397) Google Scholar), we were unable to find any interaction between ING1 proteins and hGCN5 (Fig. 1C). To confirm that the interaction between ING1 and one of the HAT complex proteins was specific, we tested whether anti-CBP, but not rabbit preimmune control immunoprecipitates, was able to co-immunoprecipitate ING1 proteins. As shown in Fig. 1E, a weak but reproducible band in the anti-CBP lane corroborated the idea that the ING1-CBP interaction was specific. Similar results were obtained in primary fibroblast cells (data not shown). Because of this apparently weak association between CBP and ING1 proteins, we wanted to test whether this interaction was increased upon ectopic up-regulation of these proteins. For this purpose, we performed IP-W assays on lysates of primary human fibroblasts overexpressing these proteins upon co-transfection of constructs encoding CBP and either p47ING1a, p33ING1b, or empty expression vector (indicated as a, b, and v in Fig.2). IP-W assays showed that while both ING1 isoforms bound CBP, p33ING1b appeared to bind it much more avidly than p47ING1a (Fig. 2A). To confirm that the difference in the affinity of ING1 isoforms by CBP was not due to different expression levels of these proteins (i.e. as a consequence of differences in the efficiencies of transfection), we performed anti-ING1 (Fig. 2B) and anti-CBP (Fig.2C) Western assays on the total lysates used in Fig.2A. As shown in Fig. 2, B and C, the level of CBP was very similar in the three lanes, and the levels of both p33ING1b and p47ING1a were also similar, confirming that the difference in the binding affinity of ING1 isoforms for CBP was not an artifact due to variable transfection or expression efficiencies.FIG. 2p47ING1a and p33ING1binteract with CBP. Hs68 cells transfected with empty vector as a negative control (V), p47ING1a (a), or p33ING1b (b) expression constructs were harvested under non-denaturing conditions, and their lysates were immunoprecipitated with either preimmune sera (PI) or with anti-CBP antibodies. These immunoprecipitates were separated by PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose, and blotted with anti-ING1 antibodies as shown in A. Aliquots of the same lysates used inA were electrophoresed, and separated proteins were assayed by Western blotting to test for the levels of ING1 proteins (B) or CBP (C). Note that although both ING1 proteins bind to CBP, p33ING1b binds considerably more avidly.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Since ING1 proteins were able to bind to CBP (Figs. 1 and 2) and to PCNA (17Scott M.

Physiol. 1999; 181: 218-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar), and a recent report has indicated that p300 was able to bind PCNA through an unidentified nuclear protein (31Hasan S. Hassa P.O. Imhof R. Hottiger M.O. Nature. 2001; 410: 387-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar), we asked whether p47ING1a and/or p33ING1b bound p300, and if so: (a) whether ING1 proteins would be present in the same complex as p300 and PCNA and (b) whether altering the levels of cellular ING1 proteins would affect the interaction between p300 and PCNA. To address the first point, we performed p300 and ING1 IP-W assays on lysates of primary human fibroblasts transiently transfected with ING1 expression constructs. As shown in the leftmost panel of Fig.3A, we found that ING1 proteins bound p300 in an isoform-dependent manner. Anti-p300 immunoprecipitates contained p33ING1b, but not p47ING1a. Since it was recently reported that p33ING1b was able to bind to HDAC1 (28Skowyra D. Zeremski M. Neznanov N., Li, M. Choi Y Uesugi M. Hauser C.A., Gu, W. Gudkov A. Qin J. J. Biol.

Biol. 2002; 22: 835-848Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar), we used anti-HDAC1 antibodies as positive control for our IP-W assay. Data shown in the second panel of Fig. 3A confirmed the reported association between p33ING1b and HDAC1 in our normal human fibroblast model and demonstrated a novel and robust physical interaction between p47ING1a and HDAC1. To test whether increased levels of p33ING1b could affect the formation of p300·PCNA complexes (31Hasan S. Hassa P.O. Imhof R. Hottiger M.O. Nature. 2001; 410: 387-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar), we followed a similar strategy. Since p33ING1b and PCNA associate in an UV-inducible manner (17Scott M. Bonnefin P. Vieyra D. Boisvert F.M. Young D. Bazett-Jones D.P. Riabowol K. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 3455-3462Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we tested for the presence of PCNA and ING1 proteins in anti-p300 immunoprecipitates from lysates of ING1 transient transfectants subjected to UV-irradiation (Fig. 3, B–D). Fig. 3C shows that ING1 transfection resulted in the expected overexpression of p47ING1a and p33ING1b in the absence and in the presence of UV. Fig.3D shows that PCNA levels were not altered appreciably under these conditions. Aliquots of the same cell lysates blotted in Fig. 3, C and D, were immunoprecipitated with anti-p300 antibodies, and immunoprecipitates were blotted with anti-PCNA antibodies (Fig. 3B). As shown in Fig. 3B, p300 and PCNA were found together in complexes that were not altered by UV alone (lanes with vector transfected) as reported previously (31Hasan S. Hassa P.O. Imhof R. Hottiger M.O. Nature. 2001; 410: 387-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). However, while high levels of p47ING1a did not appreciably alter the amount of PCNA complexed with p300, and low levels of p33ING1b had a modest effect, overexpression of higher levels of p33ING1b selectively interfered with the p300-PCNA interaction following UV exposure (compare lane b− to lane b+ in Fig. 3B).

In vitro studies indicate that ACBP may regulate the availability of acyl-CoA esters for various metabolic and regulatory purposes. The protein is particularly abundant in cells with a high level of lipogenesis and de novo fatty acid synthesis and is significantly induced during adipocyte differentiation. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the regulation of ACBP expression in mammalian cells have remained largely unknown. Here we report that ACBP is a novel peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)γ target gene. The rat ACBP gene is directly activated by PPARγ/retinoid X receptor α (RXRα) and PPARα/RXRα, but not by PPARδ/RXRα, through a PPAR-response element in intron 1, which is functionally conserved in the human ACBP gene. The intronic PPAR-response element (PPRE) mediates induction by endogenous PPARγ in murine adipocytes and confers responsiveness to the PPARγ-selective ligand BRL49653.

The protein has been found in all eukaryotes investigated to date from mammals to yeasts and plants and is structurally and functionally highly conserved through evolution (1Kragelund B.B. Knudsen J. Poulsen F.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1441: 150-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). However, with the exception of the recently identified testis-specific protein known as endozepine-like peptide, ACBPs diverge significantly at a structural and functional level from other mammalian lipid-binding proteins. Whereas members of the fatty acid-binding protein family have a so-called β-barrel structure and bind a broad spectrum of fatty acids and fatty acid derivatives, ACBP has a four α-helix bundle structure and binds specifically acyl-CoA esters by docking the hydrocarbon chain into the lipophilic pocket and using the CoA moiety as a lid (1Kragelund B.B. Knudsen J. Poulsen F.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1441: 150-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). In vitro investigations have shown that ACBP is able to protect efficiently acyl-CoA esters from hydrolysis by thioesterases and that it can function both as acceptor and donor of acyl-CoA esters (2Rasmussen J.T. Rosendal J. Knudsen J. Biochem. J. 1993; 292: 907-913Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Thus, ACBP relieves acyl-CoA inhibition of long chain acyl-CoA synthetase, acetyl-CoA carboxylase, and adenine nucleotide transferase (2Rasmussen J.T. Rosendal J. Knudsen J. Biochem. J. 1993; 292: 907-913Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar) and regulates acyl-CoA:cholesterol acyltransferase activity (3Kerkhoff C. Beuck M. Threige R.J. Spener F. Knudsen J. Schmitz G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1346: 163-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Furthermore, ACBP is able to transport acyl-CoA esters and donate these to mitochondrial β-oxidation (4Rasmussen J.T. Faergeman N.J. Kristiansen K. Knudsen J. Biochem.

Overexpression of ACBP in yeast significantly increases the acyl-CoA pool size, indicating that ACBP can generate an intracellular acyl-CoA pool (9Mandrup S. Jepsen R. Skøtt H. Rosendal J. Højrup P.

Jensen G. Andreasen P.H. Gregersen N. Knudsen J. Kristiansen K. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 228: 1011-1022Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), and ACBP appears to be ubiquitously expressed from early stages of mammalian embryogenesis (12Bürgi B. Lichtensteiger W. Lauber M.E. Schlumpf M. J. Neuroendocrinol. 1999; 11: 85-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) as well as in adult tissues (reviewed in Ref. 13Knudsen J. Mandrup S. Rasmussen J.T. Andreasen P.H. Poulsen F. Kristiansen K. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1993; 123: 129-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). However, the level of ACBP differs markedly among different cell types. Cell types with a high level of ACBP expression include hepatocytes, steroidogenic cells, and adipocytes. The expression of the mammalian ACBP gene is regulated with the feeding status. Fasting of rats results in a significant decrease in ACBP mRNA and protein in the liver, whereas the level in heart and kidney is unaffected (6Bhuiyan J. Pritchard P.H. Pande S.V. Seccombe D.W. Metabolism. 1995; 44: 1185-1189Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 14Sterchele P.F. Vanden Heuvel J.P. Davis J.W. Shrago E. Knudsen J. Peterson R.E. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1994; 48: 955-966Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). In contrast, conditions that inducede novo fatty acid synthesis appear to induce ACBP expression (15Swinnen J.V. Vercaeren I. Esquenet M. Heyns W. Verhoeven G. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1996; 118: 65-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Similarly, ACBP expression is induced during in vitro differentiation of 3T3-L1 preadipocytes (16Hansen H.O. Andreasen P.H. Mandrup S. Kristiansen K. Knudsen J. Biochem. J. 1991; 277: 341-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), a process that is accompanied by a marked triglyceride accumulation and de novo fatty acid synthesis. The proximal promoter of the human ACBP gene has been shown to contain a sterol regulatory element that was activated by sterol regulatory element-binding protein (SREBP-1)/adipocyte determination and differentiation factor 1 in transient transfections (17Swinnen J.V. Alen P. Heyns W. Verhoeven G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19938-19944Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). This transcription factor has been shown recently to be involved in the coordinated induction by insulin of genes involved in lipogenesis (18Foretz M. Guichard C. Ferre P. Foufelle F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 12737-12742Crossref PubMed Scopus (599) Google Scholar, 19Koo S.H. Dutcher A.K. Towle H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 9437-9445Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar), and it is therefore possible that SREBP-1 regulates ACBP in response to fasting and feeding. Interestingly, ACBP expression is not only increased by conditions that favor de novo fatty acid synthesis. High fat feeding of rats leads to elevated levels of ACBP in the liver (6Bhuiyan J. Pritchard P.H. Pande S.V. Seccombe D.W. Metabolism. 1995; 44: 1185-1189Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), and various peroxisome proliferators, which are known as potent inducers of liver mitochondrial and peroxisomal β-oxidation, induce ACBP mRNA and protein expression in the liver (14Sterchele P.F.

Lillehaug J.R. Berge R.K. Xenobiotica. 1995; 25: 1181-1194Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) and ACBP protein expression in isolated hepatocytes (21Vanden Heuvel J.P. Sterchele P.F. Nesbit D.J. Peterson R.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1177: 183-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The stimulation of liver lipid catabolism by these compounds is known to be mediated by an activation of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α (PPARα) (22Lee S.S. Pineau T. Drago J. Lee E.J. Owens J.W. Kroetz D.L. Fernandez S.P. Westphal H. Gonzalez F.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3012-3022Crossref PubMed Scopus (1506) Google Scholar, 23Aoyama T. Peters J.M. Iritani N.

Chem. 1998; 273: 5678-5684Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (754) Google Scholar), suggesting that ACBP may be a PPARα target gene. Although ACBP expression has been reported to increase in the liver by prolonged exposure to PPARα activators, a functional PPAR-response element (PPRE) has never been identified in the ACBP gene, and it is unknown whether the ACBP gene is a direct target of the PPARs. In this report we demonstrate unequivocally that ACBP is a PPARγ target gene, which is activated by PPARγ-selective ligands in adipose tissue as well as in adipocyte cell lines, and we demonstrate the existence of a functional PPRE in intron 1 of the rat ACBP gene. This PPRE confers PPARα and PPARγ responsiveness to the promoter and is functionally conserved between humans and rodents. In adipocytes, the intronic PPRE mediates transcriptional activation in response to treatment with the PPARγ-selective ligand BRL49653. Chromatin immunoprecipitation shows that the PPRE binds PPARγ/RXR in vivo. These results show that ACBP expression is directly regulated by PPARγ and possibly also PPARα through the intronic PPRE. C57BL-Ksdb/db mice at the age of 12 weeks were divided into groups of 6 animals and dosed once daily for 10 days with rosiglitazone (1.0, 3, or 10 mg/kg/dosing) or vehicle (0.2% CMC + 0.4% Tween 80 in saline) by oral gavage. At the end of the dosing period, animals were killed by decapitation, and white adipose tissue (epididymal fat pads) was removed and frozen in liquid nitrogen, and RNA was isolated by RNazol (BioSite, Täby, Sweden) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Equal amounts of total RNA from all animals in each group were pooled. All animal experiments were conducted in accordance with the Danish law. Pooled total RNA isolated from the white adipose tissue was DNase-treated, and three independent reverse transcription reactions were performed using Superscript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's instructions. mRNA expression levels were determined using real time fluorescent detection in a Lightcycler instrument (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and the following primer combinations: 5′-AGCCAACTGATGAAGAGATG-f-3′ and 5′-AGGCATTATGTCCTCACAGG-r-3′ for ACBP, 5′-ATGCCTTTGTGGGAACCTGG-f-3′; 5′-CCCAGTTTGAAGGAAATCTCGG-r-3′ for adipocyte lipid-binding protein (aP2). mRNA expression levels were determined twice in each 1st strand synthesis reaction and normalized to the expression levels of 18 S rRNA as described by the vendor (Applied Biosystems). 3T3-L1, NIH-3T3, and 293 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) (Invitrogen) containing 4500 mg/liter glucose supplemented with 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 62.5 μg/ml penicillin, 8 μg/ml biotin, and 8 μg/ml pantothenic acid. Standard 3T3-L1 and NIH-3T3 culture media contained 10% calf serum (Sigma). Standard 293 media contained 10% fetal calf serum (FCS) (Invitrogen). Medium was exchanged every other day. Differentiation of 3T3-L1 cells was obtained by exposing 2-day post-confluent cells (designated day 0 cells) to DMEM containing 10% FCS (Invitrogen) supplemented with 1 μm dexamethasone (Sigma), 0.5 mm 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (Aldrich), and 1 μg/ml insulin (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). At day 2 cells were fed DMEM containing FCS and 1 μg/ml insulin, thereafter cells were maintained in DMEM and FCS. RNA was isolated (24Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63232) Google Scholar) from 3T3-L1 cells at day −2, 0, 1–4, 6, 8, and 10 of differentiation. At day 10, cells were exposed to Me2SO, 1 μm BRL49653 in Me2SO, 15 μg/ml cycloheximide, or 1 μmBRL49653 + 15 μg/ml cycloheximide. RNA was isolated after 2, 6, and 12 h of incubation. RNA was analyzed by Northern blotting with a 32P-labeled rat ACBP cDNA fragment as probe. Signals were quantified by PhosphorImaging. The membranes were stripped and reprobed with a labeled mouse adipocyte lipid-binding protein (ALBP) cDNA probe and finally with the human 28 S rRNA probe. 3T3-L1 cells from day −2, 0, 1–4, 6, 8, and 10 were lysed in 0.5 ml of 2.5% SDS sample buffer per 10-cm dish. Lysates were subjected to SDS-PAGE. Approximately 20 μg of cellular protein was loaded per lane. The separated proteins were transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane and stained with Ponceau S for control of equal loading. The membranes were blocked in 5% (w/v) nonfat dry milk, incubated with affinity-purified rabbit anti-mouse ACBP for 1 h, and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (Dako) for another hour. Immunoreactive protein bands were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences). Nuclei were purified from 3T3-L1 preadipocytes or adipocytes by a modification (25Swick A.G. Blake M.C. Kahn J.W. Azizkhan J.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 9291-9304Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) of the procedure of Dignam et al. (26Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9164) Google Scholar). Nuclear extracts were prepared as described by Lavery and Schibler (27Lavery D.J. Schibler U. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1871-1884Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar) using a 1× NUN solution (0.3 m NaCl, 1 m urea, 1% Nonidet P-40, 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, and 1 mmdithiothreitol). Protein concentrations were determined using Bradford protein assay reagent (Bio-Rad). Rat liver nuclear extract was prepared from 3-month-old Sprague-Dawley rats weighing ∼300 g according to the procedure described by Gorskiet al. (28Gorski K. Carneiro M. Schibler U. Cell. 1986; 47: 767-776Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (973) Google Scholar) except that the second purification of the nuclei was omitted, and protease inhibitors (1 μg/μl leupeptin, 1 μg/μl antipain, 1 μg/μl pepstatin, and 0.01 TIU/ml aprotinin) were added to all buffers just prior to use. In vitro translations were performed using TnT kit according to the recommendations of the manufacturer (Promega). Double-stranded oligonucleotides corresponding to the rat ACBP intron 1 DR-1, rat ACBP upstream DR-1, and human ACBP intron 1 DR-1 were labeled using [γ-32P]ATP and polynucleotide kinase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Nuclear extracts (2–4 μg) or in vitro translated proteins were incubated 20 min on ice in binding buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 40 mm KCl, 1 mm dithioerythritol, 4% glycerol, and 0.05% Nonidet P-40, 2.4 μg of poly(dI-dC)). Subsequently 2 × 105 cpm of 32P-labeled oligonucleotide was added, and the mixture was incubated for 20 min at room temperature. For competition assays, 10-fold excess of a homologous or heterologous competitor was mixed with the labeled probe and added to the preincubation mixture. Free DNA and DNA-protein complexes were resolved by electrophoresis in 0.5× TBE, 5% polyacrylamide gels. Plasmids used in transient transfections were pTK-3x- PPRE-luc (29Kliewer S.A. Umesono K. Noonan D.J. Heyman R.A. Evans R.M. Nature. 1992; 358: 771-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (1525) Google Scholar), pTK-3xACBP-PPRE-luc, and pTK-luc. The plasmid pTK3xACBP-PPRE was made from pTK-3xPPRE-luc by replacement of the three copies of ACO PPRE with three copies of the rat ACBP intronic PPRE inserted in the same orientation and with the same spacing as the original ACO PPREs. Rat ACBP promoter reporter constructs rACBP(−392/+1)-luc, rACBP(−1512/+1)-luc, and rACBP(−1535/+1)-luc were constructed by inserting the respective promoter fragments in the pGL3-basic vector (Promega). Rat ACBP promoter construct rACBP(−392/+979)-luc, rACBP(−1512/+979)-luc, rACBP(−1535/+979)-luc, rACBP(−392/+979)ΔPPRE-luc, rACBP(−1512/+979)ΔPPRE-luc, and rACBP(−1535/+979)-luc were constructed by inserting the respective promoter/exon 1 and intron 1 sequence in pGL3-basic so that the reading frame of ACBP exon 2 was fused in-frame with that of luciferase. The intronic PPRE (GGGACAGAGGTCA) was mutated to GTTTTTTTTGTCA in the ΔPPRE constructs. Human ACBP promoter reporter constructs hACBP(−516/+5)-luc, hACBP(−516/+1136)-luc, and hACBP(−516/+1136)ΔPPRE-luc were constructed similarly. The intronic PPRE (GGGACAGAGGTCG) was mutated to GTTTTTTTTGTCG in the ΔPPRE constructs. For expression of PPARs and RXRα, the expression plasmids pSG5-PPARα (30Tugwood J.D. Issemann I. Anderson R.G.

Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 329-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (1069) Google Scholar) were used. pCMV-β-galactosidase-control (Promega) was used for normalization, and pBluescriptKS (Stratagene), pSG5 (Stratagene), and/or pcDNA were used to adjust to equal DNA load and promoter load, respectively. NIH-3T3 and 293 cells were transfected at 50–70% confluency in 60-mm dishes or 6-well plates using the DC-Chol lipofection procedure (34Gao X. Huang L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 179: 280-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (907) Google Scholar) and a total of 5 or 2.5 μg, respectively, of DNA/plate/well. Following 6 h of incubation with DNA mixture, the medium was changed to DMEM and 10% resin-charcoal-stripped calf serum (for NIH-3T3) or FCS (for 293) supplemented with PPAR activator or vehicle (Me2SO) alone. 3T3-L1 cells were transfected at day 4 of differentiation using the LipofectAMINE Plus procedure (Invitrogen). Transfections were performed in 12-well plates with a total of 1 μg/well. After 3 h of incubation with the DNA mixture, medium was changed to serum-free DMEM supplemented with PPAR activator or vehicle (Me2SO) alone. Cells were harvested 20 h later in lysis buffer (Tropix), and the lysates were stored at −80 °C. All transfections were performed as triplicates. Luciferase and β-galactosidase assays were performed as described previously (35Helledie T. Antonius M. Sørensen R.V. Hertzel A.V. Bernlohr D.A. Kølvraa S. Kristiansen K. Mandrup S. J. Lipid Res. 2000; 41: 1740-1751Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The PPAR activators Wy14643 (Calbiochem), BRL49653 (Novo Nordisk A/S), and activator L-165041 (Merck) were used in the indicated concentrations to activate PPARα, PPARγ, and PPARδ, respectively. Serum was stripped with AG-1X-8 resin and activated charcoal powder as described previously (35Helledie T. Antonius M. Sørensen R.V. Hertzel A.V. Bernlohr D.A. Kølvraa S. Kristiansen K. Mandrup S. J. Lipid Res. 2000; 41: 1740-1751Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Day 4 3T3-L1 adipocytes were removed from plates by trypsinization and resuspended in DMEM + 10% FCS (18 ml per four 15-cm plates). Cells were fixed in vivofor 10 min at room temperature by addition of 2 ml of formaldehyde solution (11% formaldehyde, 0.1 m NaCl, 1 mmEDTA, 0.5 mm EGTA, and 50 mm HEPES, pH 8.0). Fixation was stopped by addition of glycine to 0.125 mfinal concentration, and cells were collected by centrifugation (1000 × g, 4 °C for 5 min), washed once in phosphate-buffered saline, and incubated in 10 ml of Triton lysis buffer for 10 min at 4 °C (0.25% Triton X-100, 10 mmEDTA, 0.5 mm EGTA, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0). Chromatin was collected by centrifugation (1000 × g, 4 °C, 5 min), washed once in 10 ml of NaCl washing buffer (0.2m NaCl, 10 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm EGTA, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0), resuspended in 3 ml of resuspension buffer (10 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm EGTA, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0), and transferred to 15-ml tubes. Shearing of chromatin was done by sonicating each sample 7 times for 30 s at 0 °C using a Branson 250 sonicator (output control set at 5). Samples were adjusted to 0.5% sarcosyl and swirled for 10 min. Cell debris was collected by centrifugation for 5 min at 13,000 ×g. Samples were adjusted to 1.42 g/cm3 CsCl and brought to a volume of 4 ml with 1.42 g/cm3 CsCl in resuspension buffer. The cross-linked chromatin complexes were separated from free protein, lipids, DNA, and RNA by isopycnic ultracentrifugation for 72 h at 20 °C, 40,000 rpm in a Beckman SWTi60 rotor. Fractions of 0.5 ml were collected from the bottom of the gradient with syringe and needle, and the samples containing chromatin were identified on a 0.8% agarose gel. The samples containing chromatin were pooled and dialyzed overnight at 4 °C against dialysis buffer (5% glycerol, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm EGTA, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0). Dialyzed chromatin was sonicated again for 30 s as above. The cross-linked chromatin was aliquoted and stored at −80 °C. 120 μl of protein A/G beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) were washed three times in immunoprecipitation (IP) dilution buffer (1% Triton X-100, 2 mm EDTA, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1, 300 mm NaCl and 1:50 Complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Molecular Biochemicals)). Beads were then incubated with 10 μg of sheared salmon sperm DNA and 60 μg of bovine serum albumin for 30 min at 4 °C in IP dilution buffer, washed three times in IP dilution buffer, and finally resuspended in IP dilution buffer. To 200-μl aliquots of isolated cross-linked chromatin an equal volume of 2-fold concentrated IP dilution buffer was added, and the chromatin was incubated with half of the protein A/G beads for 1 h at 4 °C on a rotating wheel. Beads were removed by centrifugation (13,000 ×g, 20 s, 4 °C) and the supernatant was incubated overnight at 4 °C with 5 μl of antibody (PPARγ polyclonal (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or pan-RXR polyclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology)) on a rotating wheel. Complexes containing PPARγ and RXR were immunoprecipitated by adding the other half of the beads and incubating 1½ h at 4 °C on a rotating wheel. Immune complexes were washed 5 min on a rotating wheel with buffer 1 (1% Triton X-100, 2 mm EDTA, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1, and 150 mm NaCl), twice with buffer 2 (1% Triton X-100, 2 mm EDTA, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1, 500 mm NaCl), and twice with TE buffer. Immune complexes were eluted from the beads with 200 μl of 1% SDS, 0.1 mNaHCO3 for 15 min. The elution was repeated; eluates were combined; 16 μl of 5 m NaCl was added, and chromatin was decross-linked for 4 h at 65 °C. DNA was purified by phenol/chloroform extraction, precipitated with 20 μg of glycogen as carrier, and finally dissolved in 50 μl of TE buffer. For input control, 200 μl of input chromatin was decross-linked, phenol/chloroform-extracted, precipitated, and dissolved in 100 μl of TE. Precipitated DNA was quantified using the GeneAmp 5700 Sequence Detection system (PE Biosystem) and real time PCR kit (Eurogenetics). Primer sets were designed to amplify the intronic PPRE of the ACBP gene, the PPRE of the adipocyte lipid-binding protein promoter (32Tontonoz P., Hu, E. Graves R.A. Budavari A.I. Spiegelman B.M. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1224-1234Crossref PubMed Scopus (2005) Google Scholar), and the PPRE of the lipoprotein lipase promoter (36Schoonjans K. Peinado O.J. Lefebvre A.M. Heyman R.A. Briggs M. Deeb S. Staels B. Auwerx J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5336-5348Crossref PubMed Scopus (1026) Google Scholar), respectively. As a negative background control, a primer set located ∼8 kb downstream of the intronic PPRE of the ACBP gene was used. Primers were designed so that all PCR products were between 81 and 87 bp. Primers were as follows: ACBP intron 1 PPRE, forward 5′-TCCCACTTGCCTCTCCCTAA-3′ and reverse 5′-CAGCTGGTCCCTTCCTACAGG-3′; LPL PPRE, forward 5′-CCTCCCGGTAGGCAAACTG-3′ and reverse 5′-AACGGTGCCAGCGAGAAG-3′; ALBP PPRE (ARE7), forward 5′-GAGAGCAAATGGAGTTCCCAGA-3′ and reverse 5′-TTGGGCTGTGACACTTCCAC-3′; and background control, forward 5′-ACACCACTGGCCGTGATGTT-3′ and reverse 5′-CATCGGCGTACTCTGCTGTG-3′. The PCR amplification was carried out as follows: initial denaturation at 95 °C for 10 min, followed by 40 cycles of denaturation at 96 °C for 15 s and combined annealing and extension at 60 °C for 60 s. The GeneAmp 5700 software was used to perform analysis of the real time fluorescence signal from SyBR Green I bound to double-stranded DNA. A threshold cycle was determined for each sample, using the exponential growth phase and base-line data of the fluorescent amplification plots. Dissociation curves were subsequently used to identify PCR products. To correct for differences in efficiency of the different PCRs, all PCR signals from immunoprecipitated DNA were normalized to PCR signals from non-precipitated input DNA. The normalized signal from the PCR obtained with the background control primer set was arbitrarily set to 1, and other PCR signals were expressed as fold above background. Peroxisome proliferators have been shown to increase the expression of ACBP in rat liver (14Sterchele P.F. Vanden Heuvel J.P. Davis J.W. Shrago E. Knudsen J. Peterson R.E. Biochem.

Xenobiotica. 1995; 25: 1181-1194Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), and we have shown previously (16Hansen H.O. Andreasen P.H. Mandrup S. Kristiansen K. Knudsen J. Biochem. J. 1991; 277: 341-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) that ACBP expression is significantly increased during in vitro adipocyte differentiation, a process during which the expression of a number of PPARγ target genes is up-regulated. To investigate whether ACBP expression can be induced by PPARγ ligands in vivo, 12 week-old db/db mice were fed either vehicle or BRL49653 at different concentrations for 10 days. The db/db model is commonly used to study the antidiabetic effects of thiazolidinediones, and ACBP mRNA levels are similar in adipose tissue of db/db mice and wild type C57BL6 mice (results not shown). Adipose tissue was isolated, and the expression of ACBP was compared with that of the ALBP, which is a well established PPARγ target gene (32Tontonoz P., Hu, E. Graves R.A. Budavari A.I. Spiegelman B.M. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1224-1234Crossref PubMed Scopus (2005) Google Scholar). Both ACBP and ALBP are expressed at very high levels in adipocytes (37Matarese V. Bernlohr D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 14544-14551Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 38Mandrup S. Sørensen R.V. Helledie T. Nøhr J. Baldursson T. Gram C. Knudsen J. Kristiansen K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23897-23903Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar); however, despite these high basal levels, the expression of ACBP as well ALBP mRNA was significantly and dose-dependently increased by BRL49653 (Fig.1). This suggests that ACBP might be a PPARγ target gene. We have reported previously (16Hansen H.O. Andreasen P.H. Mandrup S. Kristiansen K. Knudsen J. Biochem. J. 1991; 277: 341-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) that ACBP mRNA and protein are induced during adipocyte d"

NsLTPs are known to be involved in the formation of a protective hydrophobic layer over the plant surfaces (5Trevino M.B. MA O.C. Plant Physiol. 1998; 116: 1461-1468Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Despite their ability to help plants to manage stress, the exact mechanism of transport is still unclear. NsLTPs are also involved in other biological activities such as flowering and transportation of cutin and suberin monomers (6Douliez J.P. Michon T. Elmorjani K. Marion D. J. Cereal Sci. 2000; 32: 1-20Crossref Scopus (292) Google Scholar). NsLTPs present in cereals play an important role in food chemistry. NsLTPs directly affect dough rheology and breadcrumb texture (6Douliez J.P. Michon T. Elmorjani K. Marion D. J. Cereal Sci. 2000; 32: 1-20Crossref Scopus (292) Google Scholar). Reports about the isolation of glycosylated and reduced nsLTP fragments from beer suggest that nsLTPs are involved in froth formation during the malting and brewing processes (7Jegou S. Douliez J.P. Molle D. Boivin P. Marion D. J. Agric. Food Chem. 2000; 48: 5023-5029Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). NsLTPs are divided into two subfamilies, nsLTP1 (molecular mass ∼9 kDa) and nsLTP2 (molecular mass ∼7 kDa) (2Kader J.C. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1996; 47: 627-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (791) Google Scholar). NsLTP1 is found primarily in aerial organs, whereas nsLTP2 is expressed in roots. Interestingly, both nsLTP1 and nsLTP2 are found in seeds. NsLTP1 is proposed to transport cutin monomers, whereas nsLTP2 is involved in the transport of the more rigid suberin monomers (6Douliez J.P. Michon T. Elmorjani K. Marion D. J. Cereal Sci. 2000; 32: 1-20Crossref Scopus (292) Google Scholar). Three-dimensional structures of nsLTP1 from various sources were determined by x-ray and NMR spectroscopic techniques (8Sodano P. Caille A., Sy, D. de Person G. Marion D. Ptak M. FEBS Lett. 1997; 416: 130-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). All nsLTP1s share a common structural fold stabilized by four disulfide bonds. The prominent four helices of nsLTP1 are packed against a flexible C-terminal arm formed by a series of turns. In contrast to many globular proteins, the hydrophobic side chains of nsLTP1 do not form a rigid hydrophobic core but instead form a hydrophobic cavity at the interior of the protein. Recently, we have purified nsLTP2 from rice. The amino acid sequence, disulfide bond pattern and stability have been determined (TrEMBL ID P83210) (9Liu Y.-J. Samuel D. Lin C.-H. Lyu P.-C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 294: 535-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Rice nsLTP2 contains 69 residues and has less than 30% sequence identity with nsLTP1. The disulfide bond pattern of nsLTP2 differs from nsLTP1. Although the size is smaller, nsLTP2 has comparable lipid transfer activity and greater structural stability than nsLTP1 (10Douliez J.P. Pato C. Rabesona H. Molle D. Marion D. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 1400-1403Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Plant nsLTP1 proteins from various sources have been well characterized, whereas the structure and the functionality of nsLTP2 is poorly understood (6Douliez J.P. Michon T. Elmorjani K. Marion D. J.

Here, we report the three-dimensional structure of nsLTP2. Rice nsLTP2 was purified from rice flour as described previously (11Yu Y.G. Chung C.H. Fowler A. Suh S.W. Arch Biochem.

All NMR experiments were carried out on a 3 mm sample of rice nsLTP2 dissolved in 50 mmphosphate buffer (90% H2O and 10% D2O, pH 6.4) containing sodium 3-(trimethylsilyl)[2,2,3,3-2H]propionate (d 4-TSP) as the internal standard. A Bruker 600 MHz NMR spectrometer was used to record two-dimensional TOCSY and NOESY spectra with 512 t 1 increments and 2048t 2 complex data points at 25 °C. All of the NMR spectra were processed using XWIN-nmr (Bruker) and analyzed using SPARKY (12Goddard T.D. Kneller D.G. SPARKY. 3rd Ed. University of California, San Francisco1999Google Scholar). Distance constraints were derived from a y spectrum recorded with a 150-ms mixing time. A TOCSY spectrum was used to derive phi (φ) angle constraints (13Wang Y. Nip A.M. Wishart D.S. J. Biomol. NMR. 1997; 10: 373-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Hydrogen bonding information was obtained from amide exchange data. The experimental NOEs were classified as weak, weak medium, medium, strong medium, or strong according to standard procedures (14Wuthrich K. NMR of Proteins and Nucleic Acids. Wiley-Interscience, New York1986: 176-199Google Scholar). Structure calculations were carried out using XPLOR, version 3.8 (15Brunger A.T. X-PLOR Software Manual, Version 3.1. Yale University, New Haven, CT1992Google Scholar). Fluorescence lipid transfer assays were performed as previously described (10Douliez J.P. Pato C. Rabesona H. Molle D. Marion D. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 1400-1403Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 16van Paridon P.A. Gadella Jr., T.W. Somerharju P.J. Wirtz K.W. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 6208-6214Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). 2 μl of pyrPtdCho in ethanol, 0.118 mm, and 2 μl of Myr2PtdGro, 1 mg.ml−1, were added to a cuvette containing 0.8 μm protein in 2 ml of 20 mmTris-HCl, 5 mm EDTA buffer (pH 7.4). Fluorescence intensities were monitored at 396 nm with excitation at 346 nm using an SLM 48000S spectrofluorometer at 25 °C. A geometric recognition algorithm (gramm), was used to dock ligands with the protein (17Katchalski-Katzir E. Shariv I. Eisenstein M. Friesem A.A. Aflalo C. Vakser I.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 2195-2199Crossref PubMed Scopus (854) Google Scholar). Grid steps of 1.7 Å for translation and 10° for rotation were used to dock the ligands in hydrophobic mode. Optimal values for the repulsion (E) and attraction double range were chosen as 10 Å and 0.5 Å, respectively. After initial docking, the best complex structures were chosen for further refinement using the Discover 3 in Insight II package (Molecular Simulation Inc.). 500 energy minimization steps were carried out with the steepest decent method using the consistent valence force field to attain the most stable conformation. The dielectric constant was set to 1.0. A program for studying cavities of proteins, VOIDOO, was used to evaluate the hydrophobic cavities of nsLTPs in the complexed and noncomplexed forms (18Kleywegt G.J. Jones T.A. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1999; 55: 941-944Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). The van der Waals mode or the probe-occupied mode (probe radius 1.4 Å) was used to measure the volumes. Resonance assignments for most protons were achieved through conventional methods (14Wuthrich K. NMR of Proteins and Nucleic Acids. Wiley-Interscience, New York1986: 176-199Google Scholar). Sequential assignments for a portion polypeptide chain are shown in Fig. 1 A. Fig. 1 Bshows assignments for cross-peaks between various amide protons. The chemical shift data were deposited in the BioMagResBank (BMRB-5325). A total of 813 distance constraints were derived from cross-peaks in a 150-ms NOESY spectrum. Hydrogen bond constraints were generated for 30 slowly exchanging backbone amides observed in a TOCSY spectrum measured immediately after dissolving the lyophilized sample in 99% D2O, and 19 dihedral angle constraints were obtained from a TOCSY spectrum measured according to the procedure of Wang et al. (13Wang Y. Nip A.M. Wishart D.S. J. Biomol. NMR. 1997; 10: 373-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). A total of 862 constraints were used for the structure calculations. Intensities of all sequential NOEs are summarized in Fig.2. Because no crystal or theoretical structures are available for nsLTP2, ambiguous NOE constraints were added in an iterative manner over the course of the refinement. The final ensemble of 15 structures was chosen from 50 randomly simulated annealing structures (TableI). The set of final structures contains no violations greater than 0.5 Å for the NOE interproton distances or 5° for the dihedral angle constraints. The unminimized average structure was compared with the accepted structures to calculate atomic r.m.s.d. Although the disulfide bond constraints were available from biophysical studies, they were not incorporated into the structure calculations, to avoid biasing the process of refinement against experimental NMR data. Interestingly, in all 50 of the calculated structures, the pairs of cysteine residues that were near enough to form disulfide bonds were identical. We concluded that the disulfide bond pattern of the rice nsLTP2 is Cys3–Cys35, Cys11–Cys25, Cys37–Cys61, and Cys26–Cys68, which agrees with our enzymatic digestion results (9Liu Y.-J. Samuel D. Lin C.-H. Lyu P.-C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 294: 535-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar).Figure 2Amino acid sequence and survey of sequential connectivities of rice nsLTP2.

Open table in a new tab The rice nsLTP2 is a predominantly α-helical protein consisting of three prominent helices within the N-terminal 40 amino acids. The well conserved cysteine residues form four disulfide bonds to stabilize the three-dimensional fold of the protein. The C-terminal amino acid residues, Lys41–His69, constitute a less structured region of the molecule with a high density of positively charged residues. The r.m.s.d. values for the backbone and all heavy atoms were 1.09 ± 0.20 and 1.54 ± 0.25 Å, respectively. The first 40 amino acids (Ala1–Ala40), constituting the rigid portion of the molecule, have r.m.s.d. values of 0.65 ± 0.1 Å for the backbone and 0.95 ± 0.15 Å for all heavy atoms. Superposition of the 15 NMR structures are shown as a stereo representation in Fig. 3 A. Three helices of rice nsLTP2 positioned at Cys3–Ala16, Thr22–Ala31, and Gln33-Ala40 are colored green,red, and purple, respectively. Helices II and III are connected by a 90° turn to form a very rigid and unique structural motif. The curved helix I accommodates two disulfide bonds (Cys3–Cys35 and Cys11–Cys25). The flexible portion of the polypeptide contains two single-turn helices at positions Tyr45–Tyr48 and Ala54–Val58. A series of hydrophobic residues distributed throughout the nsLTP2 sequence combine to form a hydrophobic cavity. A continuous stretch of hydrophobic residues, Cys61–Ile65, near the C terminus forms a flexible cap over the hydrophobic cavity. The C-terminal region also contains two cysteines bridged to the rigid portion of the molecule (Cys26–Cys61 and Cys37–Cys68). These two disulfide bonds help to maintain the correct orientation of the hydrophobic cap. The final energy-minimized average structure of rice nsLTP2 is shown in Fig.3 B. A ProCheck analysis of the three-dimensional structure revealed that only Ser59 and Ser60 are in the disallowed region, corresponding to 3.6% of the residues in the protein (19Morris A.L. MacArthur M.W. Hutchinson E.G. Thornton J.M. Proteins. 1992; 12: 345-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (1373) Google Scholar). These residues constitute a portion in the flexible C terminus that makes a very sharp turn to cover the hydrophobic cavity. The biophysical properties of the two subfamilies of nsLTP are very different. A higher concentration of GdnHCl is required to denature NsLTP2 (C m ∼4.2 m) than nsLTP1 (C m ∼3.0 m). NsLTP1 has unusual thermal stability (T m ∼95 °C), but nsLTP2 could not be thermally denatured even at temperatures approaching 100 °C (data not shown). A primary sequence analysis using CLUSTAL W revealed a close relationship between these two subfamilies (20Thompson J.D. Higgins D.G. Gibson T.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4673-4680Crossref PubMed Scopus (54899) Google Scholar). The locations of cysteines, hydrophobic amino acids, and important positively charged residues are well conserved. There are, however, notable differences. In the -CXC- motif, an asparagine between the two cysteines in nsLTP1 is replaced by a hydrophobic amino acid, phenylalanine, in nsLTP2 (Fig. 4). The disulfide bond pattern in nsLTP2 differs from nsLTP1 at the -CXC- motif (Fig.5 A). The hydrophobic residue in the -CXC- motif of nsLTP2 is buried inside the molecule, whereas the hydrophilic residue of nsLTP1 is at the surface (Fig.5 B). These observations suggest that the central residue of the -CXC- motif may govern the cysteine pairing and influence the overall fold of the protein.Figure 5A, schematic representations of the cysteine pairing patterns of nsLTP1 and nsLTP2 show high similarity except for the -CXC-motif. B, the side-chain orientations of nsLTP1 and nsLTP2 at the -CXC- motifs are shown with the ball-and-stick model. The hydrophilic Asn49 present in nsLTP1 is projected to the periphery of the protein, whereas the hydrophobic Phe36 of nsLTP2 is buried inside the molecule.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The backbone folds of nsLTP1 and nsLTP2 show structural similarities. The superimposed three-dimensional structures of nsLTP1 (red) and nsLTP2 (green) are represented with a ribbon diagram in Fig. 6. Portions of helix I and helix II of nsLTP2 are closely aligned with nsLTP1. Helices II and III of nsLTP1 are connected through a loop to form a gradual bend. In nsLTP2, helix III joins helix II with a 90° angle (the region labeled 31 and 38 in the Fig. 6). The backbone r.m.s.d. values for the Val10–Ala22and the perfectly aligned helix II (Ala23–Gln31) are 1.10 and 0.52 Å, respectively. The residues Gln38–Gly62, constituting the flexible region of nsLTP2, are aligned with helix III and helix IV of nsLTP1 but are quite divergent (r.m.s.d. ∼ 4.62 Å). The C-terminal residues of nsLTP1 and nsLTP2 are not aligned as they form a supple cap over their hydrophobic cavities. The interior hydrophobic cavity of nsLTP2 is significantly different from nsLTP1 and important for its biological functions. The hydrophobic cavity of nsLTP1 is a tunnel (19Morris A.L. MacArthur M.W. Hutchinson E.G. Thornton J.M. Proteins. 1992; 12: 345-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (1373) Google Scholar), whereas the hydrophobic cavity of nsLTP2 is a triangular hollow box (Fig.7). The three faces of the hydrophobic cavity are designated as face I, formed by Ala14, Val49, and Ala54, face II, formed by Cys25, Cys26, Leu29, and Cys11, and face III, formed by Phe36 and Phe39. All three faces are covered at the bottom by Leu8, Ala14, and Ile15 and at the top by Val58, Cys61, Gly62, Ile63, Ala64, and Leu65 residues. In nsLTP1, helices II and IV do not contribute to the hydrophobic cavity directly except for the terminal Leu34, Ala38, and Ile69, whereas in the case of nsLTP2 all of the helices, including single helical turns at positions Tyr45–Tyr48 and Ala54–Val58, contribute to the hydrophobic cavity.Figure 7Web-Lab Viewer representation of the docking of C18-stearic acid to the hydrophobic cavities of nsLTP1 and nsLTP2. The residues covering the hydrophobic cavities (labeled in A) are removed in B to allow the fatty acid orientation to be visualized clearly. Various residues constituting the hydrophobic cavities are labeled. The fatty acid is positioned compactly in the tunnel-like hydrophobic cavity of nsLTP1, and in the case of nsLTP2 the flexible triangular hollow box accommodates the fatty acid.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) In vitrostudies have shown that nsLTP1 could transfer and/or exchange various phospholipid and glycolipid molecules across membranes (2Kader J.C. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1996; 47: 627-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (791) Google Scholar). Lipid transfer activity of nsLTP2 was tested in vitro with fluorescence spectroscopy (Fig. 8). A solution consisting of two populations of homogeneous vesicles, one population containing fluorescent lipid molecules (pyrPtdCho) and the other population containing nonfluorescent lipid molecules (Myr2PtdGro) fluoresced very little. Because of the interactions between the pyrene moieties, fluorescence intensity was quenched (shown by an arrow in Fig. 8) (16van Paridon P.A. Gadella Jr., T.W. Somerharju P.J. Wirtz K.W. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 6208-6214Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The fluorescence intensity increased after the addition of protein (nsLTP1 or nsLTP2, 0.8 μm) at 200 s. The protein molecules catalyzed the transfer of lipid molecules between vesicles. The fluorescence intensities plateaued when the lipid molecules containing the pyrene moiety were evenly distributed between the vesicles (16van Paridon P.A. Gadella Jr., T.W. Somerharju P.J. Wirtz K.W. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 6208-6214Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The lipid transfer efficiency is monitored by the time required for the florescence intensity to plateau. The lipid transfer profiles of nsLTPs shown in Fig. 8 imply that the transfer efficiencies of both proteins are comparable. However, the size of the hydrophobic cavity in nsLTP1 and nsLTP2 are different. NsLTP2 efficiently transferred lipid molecules, despite its smaller hydrophobic cavity. A similar trend was also observed for wheat nsLTPs (10Douliez J.P. Pato C. Rabesona H. Molle D. Marion D. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 1400-1403Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The van der Waals volume and probe-occupied volume of the hydrophobic cavities measured by VOIDOO were 569.2 and 140 Å3 for nsLTP1 and 200 and 38 Å3 for nsLTP2, respectively. Molecular modeling studies suggested that the hydrophobic cavity of nsLTP2 is more flexible than nsLTP1 (Fig. 7). When binding a molecule of stearic acid, cavity sizes of nsLTP1 and nsLTP2 increased, respectively, to 882.45 and 824.6 Å3 for the van der Walls volume and 419.9 and 1580.5 Å3 for the probe-occupied volume. The fatty acid molecule was oriented more compactly into the hydrophobic cavity of nsLTP1, but the triangular hollow box of nsLTP2 distorted to accommodate the fatty acid molecule. A molecular model of the nsLTP-ergosterol complex was analyzed to evaluate the flexibility of the hydrophobic cavity. The hydrophobic cavity of nsLTP1 was not flexible enough to accommodate the sterol molecule (21Buhot N. Douliez J.P. Jacquemard A. Marion D. Tran V. Maume B.F. Milat M.L. Ponchet M. Mikes V. Kader J.C. Blein J.P. FEBS Lett. 2001; 509: 27-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). However, the ergosterol molecule fit into the hydrophobic cavity of nsLTP2 without major changes in the secondary or tertiary protein structure. The cavity volume of nsLTP2 increased to 1099 and 1389 Å3 in van der Waals volume and probe-accessible volume, respectively. The plasticity of the nsLTP2 cavity might facilitate more rapid binding or release of the lipid molecule. The smaller molecular size may also increase the lipid transfer efficiency of the nsLTP2. Plant defense peptides bind to membrane surfaces of microorganisms through a positively charged face and inhibit bacterial growth by blocking a key process or by lysing the cells (22De Samblanx G.W.

Thevissen K., De Samblanx G.W. Osborn R.W. Crit. Rev. Plant Sci. 1997; 16: 297-323Crossref Scopus (588) Google Scholar). NsLTP1 from maize, spinach, arabidopsis, radish, onion, and broccoli exhibit antimicrobial activity (25Garcia-Olmedo F. Molina A. Segura A. Moreno M. Trends Microbiol. 1995; 3: 72-74Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar, 26Cammue B.P. Thevissen K. Hendriks M. Eggermont K. Goderis I.J. Proost P. Van Damme J. Osborn R.W. Guerbette F. Kader J.C. Broekaert W.F. Plant. Physiol. 1995; 109: 445-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). NsLTPs are complemented by thionin, a plant defense peptide, to impart antimicrobial action. NsLTPs are more active against bacterial pathogens, whereas thionins act on fungal pathogens (25Garcia-Olmedo F. Molina A. Segura A. Moreno M. Trends Microbiol. 1995; 3: 72-74Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). Although nsLTPs play an important role in plant response to pathogens, the mechanism of action is not known. The three-dimensional structure of nsLTP2 shows a high concentration of positively charged residues on the flexible face of the molecule. NsLTP1 also has a large number of positively charged residues, but these are evenly distributed over the entire molecular surface (27Han G.W. Lee J.Y. Song H.K. Chang C. Min K. Moon J. Shin D.H. Kopka M.L. Sawaya M.R. Yuan H.S. Kim T.D. Choe J. Lim D. Moon H.J. Suh S.W. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 308: 263-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Many plant defense peptides also have a large concentration of positively charged residues on one surface of the molecule. Examination of the charge distributions of structures of the antifungal protein from pokeweed (PDB code 1dkc), antifungal protein from radish (PDB code 1ayj), thionin from wheat (PDB code1gps), and rice nsLTP2 (PDB code 1l6h) shows a concentration of basic residues on one molecular face (Fig. 9). The asymmetric distribution of positive charges may be necessary for effective antimicrobial activity in defense proteins. NsLTP2 may serve two functions for the plant. Initially the protein rapidly transports lipids to the plasma membrane, which may then remain at the cell surface to defend against pathogens. The three-dimensional structure of nsLTP2 has been solved for the first time. Its unique structural features provide new insights into the biological function and significance of nsLTP2. The plasticity of the hydrophobic cavity suggests that the nsLTP2 could bind and transport a variety of molecular shapes and sizes. Although the nsLTP1 protein has been proposed for drug delivery, nsLTP2 may represent a more suitable candidate because of its flexible hydrophobic cavity (28Pato C., Le Borgne M., Le Baut G., Le Pape P. Marion D. Douliez J.P. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2001; 62: 555-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The identity of the central residue of the -CXC- motif governs a variable cysteine pairing and may affect the overall fold of the protein. The influence of various amino acid substitutions at this position on the overall fold of the protein is presently under study in our laboratory. Despite the lack of experimental evidence, the distribution of basic residues in the nsLTP2 three-dimensional structure strongly suggests a determinant for antimicrobial activity. Currently investigations are under way to elucidate the relationship of nsLTP structure to the biological functions of nsLTP2."

Some mutations in hyd result in hyperplasia of larval imaginal discs, suggesting hydfunctions as a tumor suppressor gene. The proposed function of the HYD protein in Drosophila in initiation, maintenance, and/or termination of cell proliferation (2Mansfield E. Hersperger E. Biggs J. Shearn A. Dev. Biol. 1994; 165: 507-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) points to a pivotal role in coordinating the balance between cell cycle progression and differentiation. Many pathways controlling these processes are highly conserved through evolution, and consequently mutations in orthologous genes can have hyperplastic or tumorigenic effects in both mammals andDrosophila. Notch gene mutations, for example, result in hyperplasia of the embryonic nervous system inDrosophila and have also been linked to human leukemia and breast cancer (3Panin V.M. Papayannopoulos V. Wilson R. Irvine K.D. Nature. 1997; 387: 908-912Crossref PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar), whereas the Patched gene product is required for correct Drosophila development and if mutated in humans causes developmental abnormalities together with predisposition to basal cell carcinoma (4Johnson R.L. Rothman A.L. Xie J. Goodrich L.V. Bare J.W. Bonifas J.M. Quinn A.G. Myers R.M. Cox D.R. Epstein E., Jr. Scott M.P. Science. 1996; 272: 1668-1671Crossref PubMed Scopus (1641) Google Scholar). Similarly, tumors are produced in bothDrosophila and mice upon deletion of the large tumor suppressor gene (lats) (5St. John M.A.R. Tao W. Fei X. Fukumoto R. Carcangiu M.L. Brownstein D.G.

Based on these precedents, recent studies have sought to determine the normal biological functions of EDD and whether it has a role in human cancer (1Callaghan M.J. Russell A.J. Woollatt E.

Although the cellular functions of the EDD and HYD proteins are unknown, significant homology exists between their carboxyl termini and those of E6-AP and related proteins (7Schwarz S.E. Rosa J.L.

These HECT2 (forhomologous to E6-AP carboxylterminus) family proteins form a subclass of ubiquitin-protein ligases (E3 enzymes) playing a role in the ubiquitinylation cascade that catalyzes the covalent attachment of ubiquitin to specific substrate proteins, targeting them for proteolysis. Unlike other ubiquitin ligases, which possess a RING domain, HECT ligases reversibly bind ubiquitin via a conserved cysteine residue within the HECT domain and directly transfer ubiquitin to the substrate (9Scheffner M. Nuber U. Huibregtse J.M. Nature. 1995; 373: 81-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (747) Google Scholar). The biochemical properties of in vitrotranslated EDD protein provide evidence that EDD is a human ubiquitin-protein ligase (1Callaghan M.J. Russell A.J. Woollatt E. Sutherland G.R. Sutherland R.L.

Of particular note, the proteins targeted by ubiquitinylation include molecules important in oncogenesis such as the transcription factors NF-κB (18Orian A. Whiteside S. Israel A. Stancovski I.

In addition, there are examples where the E3 ligases themselves are either tumor suppressor genes (22Hashizume R. Fukuda M. Maeda I. Nishikawa H. Oyake D. Yabuki Y. Ogata H. Ohta T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14537-14540Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (550) Google Scholar) or oncogenes (23Daujat S. Neel H. Piette J. Trends Genet. 2001; 17: 459-464Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). An additional role for several HECT ubiquitin ligases as steroid receptor transcriptional co-regulators has recently emerged. The progesterone receptor (PR), like other members of the nuclear steroid receptor family, acts as a ligand-dependent transcriptional regulator by binding to specific promoter sequences and recruiting a variety of co-regulator proteins to its ligand-dependent COOH-terminal activation domain (AF-2) (24White R. Parker M.G. Endocr. Relat. Cancer. 1998; 5: 1-14Crossref Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 25Onate S.A. Boonyaratanakornkit V. Spencer T.E. Tsai S.Y. Tsai M.J. Edwards D.P. O'Malley B.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12101-12108Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). Transcriptional coactivation is usually dependent upon direct interaction between nuclear receptor and coactivator, most often via LXXLL motifs within the coactivator. In this way coactivators are proposed to form a bridge connecting the transcription factor with the basal transcription machinery (26Freedman L.P. Cell. 1999; 97: 5-8Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar), and some also contribute enzymatic activities (27Spencer T.E. Jenster G. Burcin M.M. Allis C.D. Zhou J.

AIB1 (SRC-3), for example, is commonly overexpressed and amplified in breast cancers, with higher expression in ER-positive breast cancer cell lines (29Anzick S.L. Kononen J. Walker R.L. Azorsa D.O. Tanner M.M. Guan X.Y. Sauter G. Kallioniemi O.P. Trent J.M. Meltzer P.S. Science. 1997; 277: 965-968Crossref PubMed Scopus (1432) Google Scholar). Recently, the HECT domain proteins yeast Rsp5 and its human orthologue hRPF1 (30Imhof M.O. McDonnell D.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2594-2605Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar) and E6-AP (31Nawaz Z. Lonard D.M. Smith C.L. Lev-Lehman E. Tsai S.Y. Tsai M.-J. O'Malley B.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1182-1189Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar) were identified as having PR coactivation activity. The mechanism for this activity is unknown, but, like SRC-1, E6-AP interacts directly with PR. We now report an interaction between EDD and PR and show that EDD enhances PR transcriptional activity, providing for the first time a link between progestin-regulated EDD gene expression and PR function. In addition, yeast two-hybrid library screening was used to identify other EDD-interacting proteins including the nuclear import protein NPI-1 (importin α5), calcium- and integrin-binding protein/DNA-dependent kinase-interacting protein (CIB), and other nuclear proteins, with observations confirmed by a range of other approaches. Accordingly EDD was found to be predominantly nuclear. These studies therefore provide novel information on the functional role of EDD in the nucleus and point to possible multiple roles for this large HECT family ligase. EDD cDNAs used for in vitro translation, transfection, and yeast two-hybrid screening are shown in Fig. 1 A. cDNAs encoded the full-length protein EDD (aa 1–2799), the NH2-terminal domain EDDF1 (aa 1–889), the central domain EDDF2 (aa 889–1877), the carboxyl domain EDDF3 (aa 1877–2799), the NH2-terminal plus central domains EDDF4 (aa 1–1877), and the central plus COOH-terminal domains EDDF5 (aa 889–2799). EDDM, EDDF3M, and EDDF5M contain a mutation (Cys-2768 → Ala) at the active site cysteine necessary for E3 ligase activity in HECT proteins. For mapping of the EDD NH2terminus, restriction fragment cloning was used to generate in vitro translation constructs expressing EDD aa 1–577 (EDDF1a), 578–889 (EDDF1b), 1–419 (EDDF1c), and 420–889 (EDDF1d) (Fig.2 A). For yeast two-hybrid screening, EDD cDNA fragments used as baits were cloned from pBluescript-EDD (1Callaghan M.J. Russell A.J. Woollatt E. Sutherland G.R. Sutherland R.L. Watts C.K.W. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 3479-3941Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) in frame with the Gal4 DNA binding domain (DBD) of the pAS2.1 vector (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA). For in vitrotranslation, EDD-derived cDNAs were transcribed from pBluescript (Amersham Biosciences), pSG5 (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA), or pRcCMV (Invitrogen, Groningen, Netherlands) vectors. For EDD protein expression in mammalian cells, constructs in pRcCMV have been previously described (1Callaghan M.J. Russell A.J. Woollatt E. Sutherland G.R. Sutherland R.L. Watts C.K.W. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 3479-3941Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) and additional constructs for expression of FLAG epitope-tagged EDD were generated in the pSG5 vector. A GFP reporter vector (pGFP20; Dr. S. Aota, Osaka, Japan) was co-transfected to monitor transfection efficiency. A bacterial plasmid expressing GST fused to amino acids 263–538 of human importin α5 (NPI-1) was obtained from Peter Palese (Mount Sinai School of Medicine, New York, NY). A GST fusion of mouse importin β1 (PTAC97) was expressed and purified as described previously (32Hubner S. Xiao C.Y. Jans D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17191-17195Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). Full-length CIB was cloned from the pACT2 vector into the pGEX2T vector for GST-CIB fusion protein expression in bacteria and into the pCMVTag2C vector for mammalian expression of FLAG-tagged protein. For expression of GFP-tagged EDD in mammalian cells, full-length EDD was cloned into pEGFP-C1 (for NH2-terminal EGFP tag) and pEGFP-N1 (for COOH-terminal EGFP tag, CLONTECH). For transient expression of progesterone receptor, phPR1 vector encoding human PR B was obtained from P. Chambon (INSERM, Strasbourg, France). A PRE-luciferase reporter vector (pMSGluc) was constructed by insertion of a MMTV-LTR promoter in the pGL3-Basic vector (Promega Corp.). The phPR1 vector was used to clone the PR(AB) (aa 1–546) and PR(CDE) (aa 456–933) regions into pGEX4T2 for GST fusion protein expression. For transient expression of vitamin D receptor (VDR), pCMV-VDR along with pOS2-luc reporter vector were obtained from G. Leong (Garvan Institute, Darlinghurst, Australia). Estrogen receptor was expressed from pCMV-ER (V. C. Jordan, Northwestern University Medical School, Chicago, IL) and pERE-TK-GL3 reporter vector was obtained from M. Parker (Imperial Cancer Research Fund, London, UK). For in vitro translation, SRC-1 was cut from pCR3.1-SRC1A (B. O'Malley, Baylor College, Houston, TX) and cloned into pBluescript.Figure 2EDD interacts with importin α5 via two NLSs. A, interaction of EDD with importin α5 in a yeast two-hybrid assay. The entire coding sequence of EDD was fused in-frame with the yeast GAL4 DBD. This construct or control vector pAS2.1 was co-expressed with either control vector (pACT2) or the GAL4 AD-importin α constructs encoding aa 1–538 (Impα) or 229–538 (Impα-C) in diploid yeast strain CG1945/Y187. Protein extracts were prepared from cultures of six independent colonies and assayed in duplicate for β-galactosidase activity (expressed as -fold increase over pAS2.1 vector control). B and C, in vitrointeraction of importin α with EDD and mapping of interaction.In vitro translated 35S-labeled EDD (B) or EDD fragments (C) were incubated with a purified GST-importin α5 fusion protein or with GST alone bound to glutathione-Sepharose beads, washed, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. D, interaction of EDD with importin α in HEK 293 and T-47D cells. HEK 293 cells were stably transfected with a plasmid encoding full-length EDD protein (293/EDD). Extracts from these cells or T-47D cells were subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-importin α5 antibody (middle panel) or incubated with either GST or GST-importin α5 fusion protein bound to glutathione-Sepharose beads (right panel). Bound proteins from both procedures were separated by SDS-PAGE and Western blotted for EDD. E, mapping interaction between importin α and individual NLSs of EDD. In vitro translated35S-labeled EDD derivatives from the NH2-terminal region were incubated with GST-importin α5 or with GST alone bound to glutathione-Sepharose beads. Bound EDD was detected by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. F, in vitro interaction of importin β with EDD. In vitrotranslated 35S-labeled EDD and derivatives were incubated with GST-importin β fusion protein or with GST alone bound to glutathione-Sepharose beads. Bound EDD was detected by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. Amounts of bound EDD relative to input are indicated as percentages below gel.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The cDNAs for full-length EDD mutant and carboxyl domain mutants (EDDM and EDD5M) were screened against a human placenta cDNA library in the pACT2 vector by the yeast two-hybrid method (Matchmaker 2, CLONTECH). Stable transformants ofSaccharomyces cerevisiae strain Y190 expressing EDD fusion protein were transformed with the library using the lithium acetate method and 2–3 × 106 primary transformants selected on His−Leu−Trp− plates. Following a second round of selection on the same medium, colonies were assayed for β-galactosidase activity using a filter-based assay. Interacting plasmids that were positive for β-galactosidase only in the presence of the EDD bait plasmids were transformed intoEscherichia coli DH5α cells for further analysis. Manual sequencing was carried out using 33P-end-labeled primer in conjunction with the fmol Cycle sequencing kit (Promega Corp., Madison, WI). Sequences were analyzed by Blast searches of the GenBankTM and EMBL data bases and predicted proteins analyzed for motifs using the ISREC Profile Scan Server (www.isrec.isb-sib.ch). For semiquantitation of protein interactions, CG1945 yeast cells containing pAS2.1-EDD constructs were mated with Y187 yeast cells harboring pACT2-derived plasmids. Diploids were selected on Leu−Trp− plates and used to inoculate cultures, which were grown to saturation, diluted 1:10, and grown for 16 h. Yeast cells were harvested for protein, and β-galactosidase activities were determined in a liquid chemiluminescence assay (Tropix Galacto-Light System, Applied Biosystems). GST-tagged fusion proteins were prepared from E. coli strain BL21 according to established protocols (Amersham Biosciences protocol handbook). Soluble fusion proteins were bound to glutathione-agarose and quantitated via Coomassie Blue staining against protein standards.35S-Labeled EDD protein and mutants or SRC-1 were synthesized in a coupled in vitro transcription/translation system (TnT Quick, Promega) and 10–20 μl of reaction mixture was diluted in 1% Triton X-100 lysis buffer (1Callaghan M.J. Russell A.J. Woollatt E. Sutherland G.R. Sutherland R.L. Watts C.K.W. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 3479-3941Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) and incubated with 5 μg of GST, GST-importin α5, GST-PR(CDE), or GST-CIB coupled to glutathione-agarose beads at 4 °C for 2 h. Beads were collected by centrifugation, washed extensively in lysis buffer, and resuspended in SDS-PAGE sample buffer. After boiling, bound protein was visualized following SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. HEK 293 and T-47D were maintained as previously described (1Callaghan M.J. Russell A.J. Woollatt E. Sutherland G.R. Sutherland R.L. Watts C.K.W. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 3479-3941Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). MCF-7 cells were maintained in RPMI medium (Life Biotechnologies) containing 10% serum in 5% CO2. For overexpression by transient transfection, 3 × 106 HEK 293 cells were plated in minimal essential medium with Hanks' salts containing 10% serum in 15-cm Petri dishes. The following day pRcCMV-EDD (10 μg) was added to the cells along with 30 μl of FuGENE reagent (Roche Diagnostics, Castle Hill, New South Wales, Australia). HEK 293, Chinese hamster ovary, MCF-7, or T-47D cells were seeded in six-well plates at 1–2 × 105 cells/well. Cells were transfected with 2 μg of pEGFP-EDD or empty vector DNA and the following day split to chamber slides for 24–48 h. Slides were washed in PBS, fixed in 3.7% paraformaldehyde, washed in PBS, and mounted in 90% glycerol. GFP was visualized by fluorescence microscopy. For immunostaining, HEK 293 cells or EDD-transfected HEK 293 cells (WT30) were embedded in paraffin. Sections were de-waxed and rehydrated before unmasking in EDTA/citrate buffer and then stained with goat anti-EDD antibody N19 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA). EDD signal was detected using DAKO LSAB Plus Link and Label (DAKO Corp.) with liquid 3,3′-Diaminobenzidine Plus (DAKO Corp.) as substrate. Counterstaining was performed with hematoxylin. For extracts of total cellular protein, cells were harvested in 1% Triton X-100 lysis buffer as previously described (1Callaghan M.J. Russell A.J. Woollatt E. Sutherland G.R. Sutherland R.L. Watts C.K.W. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 3479-3941Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Extraction of nuclear proteins and cytoplasmic s100 fractions from T-47D and MCF-7 cells was carried out according to published methods (33Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9160) Google Scholar). For GST fusion protein pull-down of endogenous or recombinant EDD from cell lysates, 0.5–1 mg of total protein was incubated with 5 μg of GST or GST fusion protein bound to glutathione beads for 1–2 h at 4 °C. Beads were washed extensively in 1% Triton X-100 lysis buffer and bound proteins resolved by SDS-PAGE and detected by immunoblotting with EDD antisera (1Callaghan M.J. Russell A.J. Woollatt E. Sutherland G.R. Sutherland R.L. Watts C.K.W. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 3479-3941Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). For immunoprecipitation, 10 μl of importin α5 antiserum (Peter Palese, Mount Sinai School of Medicine, New York, NY) was incubated with 0.5–1 mg of cell lysate (4 °C for 1 h). Antibody conjugates were captured on protein A-Sepharose beads (4 °C for 1 h) and washed extensively in lysis buffer. Bound proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblotting with EDD antisera. Stable HEK 293 cells overexpressing EDDM were transfected with pCMVTag2C-CIB or empty vector using FuGENE 6 reagent (Roche) for 24 h. Following 6 h of incubation in the presence of MG132, cells were harvested and lysates prepared and 1 mg of total protein incubated with anti-FLAG antibody M2 coupled to Sepharose (Sigma) for 2 h at 4 °C. Beads were recovered by centrifugation and washed extensively in lysis buffer. Western blotting for EDD has been described (1Callaghan M.J. Russell A.J. Woollatt E. Sutherland G.R. Sutherland R.L. Watts C.K.W. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 3479-3941Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). HEK 293 or COS7 cells were plated in six-well plates (2 × 105cells/well) and the medium changed to 2% charcoal-stripped fetal calf serum the following day. Transfection was carried out using 3–4 μl of FuGENE 6 reagent (Roche) with 1–2 μg of DNA comprising 90 ng of receptor expression vector, 450 ng of luciferase reporter vector, and 1.2 μg of EDD, EDDM, or SRC-1 cDNAs in either pRcCMV or pSG5, or empty vector, and 200 ng of GFP expression vector pGFP20. The following day cells were split into 96-well plates (7 × 103cells/well) or 6-well plates (1.4 × 105 cells/well), and drugged 24 h later. After another 24 h cells in 96-well plates were assayed for luciferase activity (Luclite reagent, Packard Bioscience, Meriden, CT) and cell number (Wst-1 reagent, Roche). In some experiments cell number was monitored using the CellTiter96® proliferation assay (Promega Corp., Madison, WI). Cells in six-well plates were analyzed for GFP expression by fluorescence microscopy to determine transfection efficiency and also used for preparation of protein lysates so that protein expression levels of various constructs could be compared. In experiments where there was significant variation in cell number or GFP expression, these parameters were used to normalize luciferase activity. In some experiments pRSV-β-gal or pRL-TK (Promega Corp.) vectors were transfected in place of pGFP20 and transfection efficiency monitored by assaying for β-galactosidase or Renilla luciferase activity, respectively. For proteasome inhibition experiments, HEK 293 cells were plated at 3 × 105cells/well of a six-well dish in minimal essential medium with Hanks' salts supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen). After 48 h, medium was replaced with medium containing 20 μm MG132 (Calbiochem) or Me2SO vehicle for 2–6 h. A monoclonal antibody for Western blotting against CIB was kindly provided by U. P. Naik (University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, NC). MCF-7 cells were incubated in RPMI containing 0.5% fetal bovine serum for 18 h before addition of phleomycin (Cayla, Toulouse, France) at 100 μg/ml, hydroxyurea (Calbiochem) at 2 mm, or PBS vehicle, for 6 h. Cells were harvested for total protein or nuclear protein extracts as described above. Previous analysis of the EDD sequence showed the presence of a carboxyl-terminal HECT domain, identifying EDD as a member of the HECT family of ubiquitin protein ligases (1Callaghan M.J. Russell A.J.

Further examination of the central domain of EDD that is also highly conserved with HYD revealed a stretch of 68 amino acids (aa 1177–1245) that is 95 and 100% conserved with HYD and mouse EDD, respectively (Fig.1 B) and which shows a high degree of alignment with calossin (pushover), a calmodulin-binding protein important for neurotransmission and male fertility in Drosophila (34Richards S.

The consensus sequence CX 12–16CX 2CX 8–10CX 2CX 4–5HX 2HX 11–14CXCX 4–14C is reminiscent of the more common RING domain, which is also found in a distinct region of UBR1p.

This central region of EDD also contains a potential bipartite nuclear localization sequence (NLS) (KLKRTSPTAYCDCWEKCKCK, aa 1402–1602), whereas another putative NLS resides in the NH2-terminal region (RKKMLEKARAKNKKPK, aa 502–517) upstream of a potential SV40 large T antigen-like NLS (PYKRRR, aa 630–635) (42Dingwall C.

Here, we provide evidence for the novel concept that clustering of a ligand is a prerequisite for clustering of the cognate receptor. We show that clustering of the CD40 receptor depends on reciprocal clustering of the CD40 ligand (gp39, CD154). Clustering of the CD40 ligand is mediated by an association of the ligand with p53, a translocation of acid sphingomyelinase (ASM) to the cell membrane, an activation of the ASM, and a formation of ceramide. Ceramide appears to modify preexisting sphingolipid-rich membrane microdomains to fuse and form ceramide-enriched signaling platforms that serve to cluster CD40 ligand. Genetic deficiency of p53 or ASM or disruption of ceramide-enriched membrane domains prevents clustering of CD40 ligand. The functional significance of CD40 ligand clustering is indicated by the finding that clustering of CD40 on B lymphocytes upon co-incubation with CD40 ligand-expressing T cells depends on clustering of the CD40 ligand and is abrogated by inhibition of CD40 ligand clustering.

If the ligand is membrane-bound, the contact site between the ligand and the receptor resembles some features of a neurological synapse and, thus, has been also named immune synapse (1Dustin M.L. Shaw A.S. Science. 1999; 283: 680-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar).Many receptors appear to aggregate in sphingolipid-rich membrane rafts, which contain a high concentration of sphingolipids and cholesterol (2Anderson R.G.

To test the hypothesis that clustering of a ligand is involved in the clustering of its receptor, we examined the CD40-CD40 ligand system.CD40 ligand is an ∼30-kDa type II membrane glycoprotein consisting of 261 amino acids (11Stamenkovic I. Clark E.A. Seed B. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 1403-1410Crossref PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar). The molecule is primarily expressed in T lymphocytes, but it is also present in mast cells, basophils, NK cells, monocytes, B lymphocytes, and platelets (12Van Kooten C. Front. Biosci. 2000; 5: D880-D893Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The interaction between the CD40 ligand and its cognate receptor, CD40, is one of the key events of B-cell activation and is required for Ig class switching (13Banchereau J. Rousset F. Nature. 1991; 353: 678-679Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar,14Jabara H.H., Fu, S.M. Geha R.S. Vercelli D. J. Exp. Med. 1990; 172: 1861-1864Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar). Thus, B cells from patients who lack a functional CD40-CD40 ligand system are unable to switch from IgM to IgG production upon antigenic challenge (15Korthauer U. Graf D. Mages H.W. Briere F.

These patients suffer from a severe immunodeficiency characterized by normal or elevated IgM levels, low IgG concentrations, and severe, recurrent bacterial infections (15Korthauer U. Graf D. Mages H.W. Briere F. Padayachee M. Malcolm S. Ugazio A.G. Notarangelo L.D. Levinsky R.J. Kroczek R.A. Nature. 1993; 361: 539-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (640) Google Scholar,16Allen R.C. Armitage R.J.

Science. 1993; 259: 990-993Crossref PubMed Scopus (757) Google Scholar).We and others have suggested that the CD40 ligand not only functions as a ligand for CD40 but is also involved in outside-to-inside signaling (17Koppenhoefer U.

This function might be immanent to the entire nerve growth factor/TNF ligand family, because outside-to-inside signaling has been recently also described for TNFα (22Harashima S.I. Horiuchi T.

Antibody-mediated stimulation of EL4 T cells via the CD40 ligand stimulates Jun N-terminal kinases, p38 kinase, Rac-1, the Src-like tyrosine kinase p56lck, and protein kinase C (17Koppenhoefer U.

Gulbins E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 239: 11-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). In addition, co-ligation of the CD40 ligand to the CD3 complex triggers an enhanced production of interleukin-10, interferon-γ, and TNFα and mediates apoptosis of T cells (19Blair P.J. Riley J.L. Harlan D.M. Abe R. Tadaki D.K. Hoffmann S.C. White L. Francomano T. Perfetto S.J. Kirk A.D. June C.H. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 191: 651-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar).Here, we tested the hypothesis that signaling via the CD40 ligand is required to enable the CD40 ligand to deliver a potent signal to CD40. CD40 clustering requires a p53-dependent activation of the ASM, a formation of ceramide, and the formation of ceramide-enriched membrane domains, which trap and cluster CD40 ligand. Inhibition of CD40 ligand clustering prevents CD40 clustering, demonstrating that primary clustering of the CD40 ligand is essential in CD40-mediated activation of B lymphocytes.RESULTSTo investigate whether redistribution of a ligand in the cell membrane is required for the clustering of the cognate receptor, we used the CD40-CD40 ligand system. We investigated whether CD40 ligand clusters after incubation with an anti-CD40 ligand antibody or upon co-incubation with CD40-positive B lymphocytes. The results reveal a very rapid clustering of CD40 ligand in purified murine T lymphocytes (Fig. 1A) or EL4 cells (Fig.1B), respectively, upon stimulation via the CD40 ligand (Fig. 1, A and B). Quantitative analysis shows that ∼50% of all cells cluster CD40 ligand within 5 min (Fig.1C).We have previously shown that ceramide released by the ASM mediates a reorganization of small lipid rafts to larger platforms and a trapping of, at least, some receptors in these platforms (7Grassmé H.

Immunol. 2002; 168: 298-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). To test the hypothesis that ASM and ceramide are involved in CD40 ligand clustering, we determined the surface translocation and enzymatic activity of the ASM and formation of ceramide upon stimulation of EL4 cells via CD40 ligand. The experiments reveal a very rapid and transient activation of the ASM and a concomitant formation of ceramide upon stimulation of the cells via CD40 ligand (Fig. 2A). Enzyme stimulation correlated with a translocation of the ASM onto the extracellular leaflet of the cell membrane (Fig. 2B). The notion that membrane platforms are important for CD40 ligand clustering is supported by the finding that CD40 ligand clusters in Cy5-choleratoxin-positive membrane platforms (Fig. 2C). Cell surface activity of the ASM correlated with a formation of extracellularly oriented ceramide (Fig. 2D) upon CD40 ligand stimulation. Fluorescence microscopy studies reveal that surface ceramide also localized to larger platforms or cluster-like structures (Fig. 2E). Signaling platforms appear to be modified by ceramide, which co-localizes with CD40 ligand within the cluster structures (Fig. 2F). The confocal microscopy studies also indicate that the CD40 ligand and ceramide cluster consist of several small subunits forming a larger platform. Several control experiments confirm the specificity of the anti-ceramide antibody; FACS analysis reveals that the anti-ceramide antibody did not significantly bind to unstimulated cells (Fig. 2, D and G) and thus excluded the possibility that the 15B4 antibody might react substantially with cholesterol, sphingomyelin, or other phospholipids in the cell membrane. Likewise, the antibody did not bind to ASM-deficient cells, even after stimulation via CD40 ligand (Fig. 2G). Loading intact cells with C16-ceramide or treatment with purified sphingomyelinase conferred strong antibody binding to the cell surface (Fig. 2H), whereas untreated cells were negative. C16-ceramide or endogenous ceramide generated by purified sphingomyelinase spontaneously formed platforms (Fig.2H).FIG. 2CD40 ligand stimulates ASM-mediated ceramide formation and co-localizes with ceramide-enriched membrane domains.

The studies show that CD40 ligand clustering is absent in T cells of ASM-deficient mice, whereas rapid aggregation of the CD40 ligand occurs in T cells of ASM-expressing control mice upon stimulation (Fig.3A).FIG. 3Clustering of CD40 ligand is dependent on ASM and ceramide-enriched membrane rafts. A, genetic deficiency of ASM prevents clustering of the CD40 ligand. Peripheral T cells were obtained from asm−/− or wild-type control mice and stimulated via the CD40 ligand. Clustering of the CD40 ligand was evaluated by fluorescence microscopic analysis of 100 cells per sample. Shown is the mean ± S.D. of four independent experiments. B, destruction of sphingolipid-rich membrane rafts by β-cyclodextrin, nystatin, and filipin blocked clustering of the CD40 ligand.

Displayed is the mean ± S.D. of four independent experiments in which 100 cells per sample were analyzed.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Sphingolipid-enriched rafts contain cholesterol, which appears to function as a spacer between the bulky sphingolipids; therefore, the extraction of cholesterol from cells destroys sphingolipid-rich rafts (26Scheiffele P. Rietveld A. Wilk T. Simons K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2038-2044Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar). To further study the role of sphingolipid-rich rafts in CD40 ligand clustering, we incubated EL4 cells with β-cyclodextrin, nystatin, and filipin, agents that interfere with the metabolism of cellular cholesterol and destroy sphingolipid-enriched rafts. Treatment with these reagents prevented the clustering of CD40 ligand (Fig.3B), whereas treatment with α-cyclodextrin, an inactive stereoisomer of β-cyclodextrin, had no effect (Fig.3B).These results indicate that the initial contact between CD40 and the CD40 ligand causes ASM to translocate, become activated, and mediate clustering of the CD40 ligand in ceramide-enriched rafts.To identify intermediates of the signaling pathway from CD40 ligand to ASM, we searched for proteins associating with the CD40 ligand. To this end, we performed a phage display analysis and used the intracellular part of the CD40 ligand as bait to screen a phage peptide expression library. These screens, which were confirmed by results of screening a second, independent peptide library, revealed the association of peptides with the CD40 ligand, which were identical or highly homologous to sequences in p53 (Fig.4A). To further investigate the association of p53 with CD40 ligand, we tested whether p53 binds to a purified GST-CD40 ligand fusion protein. To this end, GST-CD40 ligand fusion proteins were incubated with lysates from EL4 cells, and binding proteins were eluted and analyzed by Western blotting using anti-p53 antibodies. The results confirm the phage display data and reveal an association of p53 with GST-CD40 ligand (Fig. 4B).FIG. 4CD40 ligand associates with p53. A–C, phage display analysis and co-immunoprecipitation experiments reveal an association of the CD40 ligand with p53.A, shown are peptide sequences homologous to p53 obtained by phage display analysis using GST-CD40 ligand fusion protein as bait. Results were confirmed by a second phage analysis using an independent library. Identical amino acids in p53 and the peptides are indicated by a box. B, GST-CD40 ligand fusion proteins bind to p53. Lysates from EL4 cells were incubated with GST-CD40 ligand fusion proteins or GST that were immobilized to glutathione-Sepharose. The samples were washed, blotted, and tested for the presence of p53 using an anti-p53 antibody and the Tropix detection system. The data were reproduced four times. C, co-immunoprecipitation experiments of p53 and CD40 ligand from peripheral blood T lymphocytes demonstrate the in vivo association between p53 and CD40 ligand. The upper blots show the presence of p53 in CD40 ligand immunoprecipitates or vice versa. The lower Western blots were performed with the same antibody as used for immunoprecipitation to indicate similar amounts of CD40 ligand or p53, respectively, in all specific immunoprecipitates. Controls for CD40 ligand immunoprecipitates (left blot) were performed with an isotype-matched irrelevant antibody for immunoprecipitation. Controls for p53 immunoprecipitates (right blot) were performed with anti-p53 antibodies on lymphocytes from p53-deficient mice, which confirms the specificity of the p53-CD40 ligand association. Heavy chain indicates the heavy chain of the antibody used for immunoprecipitation. Representative results from three independent experiments are presented.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)To show an in vivo association between p53 and CD40 ligand, we performed co-immunoprecipitation experiments by using anti-p53 antibodies to determine whether p53 was present in immunoprecipitates of CD40 ligand and by using anti-CD40 ligand antibodies to determine whether CD40 ligand was present in immunoprecipitates of p53. These studies revealed an in vivo association between the CD40 ligand and p53 (Fig. 4C). Experiments using p53knock-out cells confirmed the specificity of the co-immunoprecipitation experiments.Next, we tested the function of the association of CD40 ligand with p53 by measuring the translocation and activation of ASM and the clustering of the CD40 ligand in peripheral T lymphocytes from normal orp53 knock-out mice. While normal cells rapidly responded to stimulation via CD40 ligand by translocating ASM to the cell surface (Fig. 5A), activation of the ASM (Fig. 5B), formation of ceramide (Fig. 5B), and clustering CD40 ligand (Fig. 5, C and D), p53-deficient cells failed to respond (Fig. 5, A–D). These findings indicate a central role of p53 in CD40 ligand-mediated activation of the ASM and, finally, clustering. To further characterize the association of p53 with CD40 ligand, we tested the role of the ASM and cytoskeleton elements for the association of the two proteins. The data reveal that ASM itself did not influence the association, and a very similar association of CD40 ligand with p53 was observed in normal control cells, cells lacking the ASM, or cells overexpressing the ASM ∼5-fold (Fig. 5E). Likewise, pretreatment of the cells with cytochalasin D or nocodazole that blocks the assembly of microtubules or disrupts actin filaments, respectively, did not alter the association of the two proteins (Fig. 5F), suggesting that the association of p53 with CD40 ligand does not depend on microtubules or the actin cytoskeleton, respectively.FIG. 5p53 is required for ASM translocation, activation, and CD40 ligand clustering. A and B, T cells obtained from p53-deficient mice failed to respond to stimulation via CD40 ligand. Unlike wild-type cells, p53-deficient cells do not show surface translocation (A) or activation (B) of ASM and formation of ceramide (B) in response to stimulation via CD40 ligand. A representative FACS analysis from three similar experiments and the mean ± S.D. of ASM activity or ceramide formation, respectively, measured in three independent experiments are shown.Circles, ASM activity or ceramide formation in control cells; squares, ASM activity or ceramide formation in p53-deficient cells.

https://openalex.org/W1993724028,"Saccharomyces cerevisiae POL2 encodes the catalytic subunit of DNA polymerase e. This study investigates the cellular functions performed by the polymerase domain of Pol2p and its role in DNA metabolism. The pol2-16 mutation has a deletion in the catalytic domain of DNA polymerase e that eliminates its polymerase and exonuclease activities. It is a viable mutant, which displays temperature sensitivity for growth and a defect in elongation step of chromosomal DNA replication even at permissive temperatures. This mutation is synthetic lethal in combination with temperature-sensitive mutants or the 3′- to 5′-exonuclease-deficient mutant of DNA polymerase δ in a haploid cell. These results suggest that the catalytic activity of DNA polymerase e participates in the same pathway as DNA polymerase δ, and this is consistent with the observation that DNA polymerases δ and e colocalize in some punctate foci on yeast chromatids during S phase. Thepol2-16 mutant senesces more rapidly than wild type strain and also has shorter telomeres. These results indicate that the DNA polymerase domain of Pol2p is required for rapid, efficient, and highly accurate chromosomal DNA replication in yeast."

Similar kinetics of induction and localization of m-Bop and skNAC during the induction of myogenesis in cultured C2C12 cells suggests a possible associated role for these proteins during this process. histone deacetylase nascent polypeptide-associated complex tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate whole cell extracts The control of skeletal and cardiac maturation is ordered in a complex cascade of transcriptional activation and repression. The MyoD and MEF2 families of transcription factors dictate important developmental events that result in the formation of mature skeletal muscle. The MyoD family is comprised of the basic helix-loop-helix proteins MyoD, Myf5, MRF4, and myogenin. These myogenic regulators form heterodimers with the ubiquitous basic helix-loop-helix E proteins that subsequently activate key elements needed for the myogenic program (1Olson E.N. Klein W.H. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (606) Google Scholar). The MEF2 family is defined by the MADS domain and consists of MEF2A, MEF2B, MEF2C, and MEF2D. Members of the MEF2 family are expressed in tissues besides skeletal muscle including cardiac tissue, neurons, and T cells (2Naya F.J. Olson E. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 683-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). Together, the MyoD and MEF2 families cooperate directly and indirectly to transduce the requisite signals for proper skeletal muscle formation.The discovery of chamber-specific transcription factors, such as the Hand1 and Hand2 proteins, has revealed the complex nature of cardiac transcriptional regulation (3Srivastava D. Thomas T. Lin Q. Kirby M.L. Brown D. Olson E.N. Nat. Genet. 1997; 16: 154-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar). The list of genes that correspond to specific cardiac defects continues to grow, whereas the molecular nature of these defects remains largely elusive (4Srivastava D. Olson E.N. Nature. 2000; 407: 221-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar). To further understand the molecular underpinnings of cardiac development, it is critical to identify the relationships of transcriptional regulators shown to be important in cardiac morphogenesis.The Bop gene encodes distinct proteins expressed in skeletal and cardiac muscle, as well as in cytotoxic T lymphocytes. The Bop proteins found in skeletal muscle (m-Bop) and cytotoxic T lymphocytes (t-Bop) are identical over 90% of their primary amino acid sequence, differing only at their extreme amino terminus (5Hwang I. Gottlieb P.D. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 1165-1174PubMed Google Scholar). Bop contains the evolutionarily conserved MYND and SET domains found in transcriptional regulators linked to development, chromatin stability, and cancer. The MYND domains in the transcriptional regulators ETO (MTG8) and BS69 function as protein-protein interaction domains (6Wang J. Hoshino T. Redner R.L. Kajigaya S. Liu J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.

The MYND of ETO has been implicated in the recruitment of HDACs1 (6Wang J. Hoshino T. Redner R.L. Kajigaya S. Liu J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The SET domains of several proteins, including SUV39H1, G9a, and Clr4, have been shown to function as histone methyltransferases (12Rea S. Eisenhaber F. O'Carroll D. Strahl B.D. Sun Z.W. Schmid M.

The significance of chromatin modifications in transcriptional regulation is currently the topic of great interest (14Cheung P. Allis C.D. Sassone-Corsi P. Cell. 2000; 103: 263-271Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (821) Google Scholar, 15Jenuwein T. Allis C.D. Science. 2001; 293: 1074-1080Crossref PubMed Scopus (7538) Google Scholar), and the presence in Bop of both MYND and SET domains implicated in histone deacetylation and methylation, respectively, suggests a role for Bop in chromatin regulation. Indeed, earlier studies have shown that m-Bop functions as a histone deacetylase-dependent transcriptional repressor (16Gottlieb P.D. Pierce S.A. Sims III, R.J. Weihe E.K. Harriss J.V. Maika S.D. Kuziel W.A. King H.L. Yamagishi H. Olson E.N. Nakagawa O. Srivastava D. Nat. Genet. 2002; 31: 25-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). Targeted inactivation of the Bop gene in mice resulted in embryonic death of Bop−/− null mice at approximately day E10.5 accompanied by failure of right ventricular development and accumulation of excessive extracellular matrix (16Gottlieb P.D. Pierce S.A. Sims III, R.J. Weihe E.K. Harriss J.V. Maika S.D. Kuziel W.A. King H.L. Yamagishi H. Olson E.N. Nakagawa O. Srivastava D. Nat. Genet. 2002; 31: 25-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar).Bop-null mice failed to express the basic helix-loop-helix transcriptional regulator Hand2 in the heart, but not in the lateral plate mesoderm, suggesting that m-Bop plays an important specific role in the cardiac transcriptional cascade that leads to a functional adult heart (16Gottlieb P.D. Pierce S.A. Sims III, R.J. Weihe E.K. Harriss J.V. Maika S.D. Kuziel W.A. King H.L. Yamagishi H. Olson E.N. Nakagawa O. Srivastava D. Nat. Genet. 2002; 31: 25-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar).The current studies demonstrate that m-Bop associates with the skeletal muscle- and heart-specific transcription factor skNAC. skNAC is an isoform of the ubiquitous protein, α-nascent polypeptide-associated complex (NAC) that was initially isolated as a heterodimeric complex that binds newly synthesized polypeptides emerging from ribosomes (17Wiedmann B. Sakai H. Davis T.A. Wiedmann M. Nature. 1994; 370: 434-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). Further studies suggested that skNAC functions as a transcriptional coactivator (18Yotov W.V. St-Arnaud R. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1763-1772Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). skNAC has been implicated in controlling myogenic differentiation, and skNAC transcripts are expressed at high levels only in skeletal and cardiac muscle (18Yotov W.V. St-Arnaud R. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1763-1772Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 19Munz B. Wiedmann M. Lochmuller H. Werner S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13305-13310Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). skNAC mRNA is also induced in myoblasts of the panniculus carnosus within 12 h following skin injury, a finding that may reflect an early role for skNAC in muscle repair (19Munz B. Wiedmann M. Lochmuller H. Werner S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13305-13310Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). We report here that m-Bop and skNAC interact in vitro and in vivo and display similar kinetics of expression during skeletal myogenesis in culture, suggesting an associated role for m-Bop and skNAC in striated muscle myogenesis. As observed for BS69 and related MYND domain-containing proteins, interaction of m-Bop and skNAC requires an intact m-Bop MYND domain and the presence of a PXLXP motif in skNAC.DISCUSSIONMYND and SET domains similar to those present in m-Bop are found in proteins linked to transcriptional regulation and are involved in various cellular processes including differentiation, proliferation, and chromatin stability. The Bop gene is expressed in skeletal muscle, heart, and cytotoxic T cells. MYND and SET domains of other proteins have been shown, respectively, to recruit HDACs and to have histone methyltransferase activity, and we have shown previously that m-Bop itself recruits HDACs and can act as a repressor of reporter gene expression in mammalian cells (16Gottlieb P.D. Pierce S.A. Sims III, R.J. Weihe E.K. Harriss J.V. Maika S.D. Kuziel W.A. King H.L. Yamagishi H. Olson E.N. Nakagawa O. Srivastava D. Nat. Genet. 2002; 31: 25-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar).Bop-null mice died in utero at approximately day E10.5 with abnormal hearts having the following characteristics at day E9.5: absence of a right ventricle, poor trabeculation of the left ventricle, and accumulation of an abnormally large amount of extracellular matrix (cardiac jelly) (16Gottlieb P.D. Pierce S.A. Sims III, R.J. Weihe E.K. Harriss J.V. Maika S.D. Kuziel W.A. King H.L. Yamagishi H. Olson E.N. Nakagawa O. Srivastava D. Nat. Genet. 2002; 31: 25-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). Additionally, Hand2 expression in the developing heart was shown to be dependent on an intact Bop gene (16Gottlieb P.D. Pierce S.A. Sims III, R.J. Weihe E.K. Harriss J.V. Maika S.D. Kuziel W.A. King H.L. Yamagishi H. Olson E.N. Nakagawa O. Srivastava D. Nat. Genet. 2002; 31: 25-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the homeobox protein IRX4, shown previously to be Hand2-dependent (22Bruneau B.G. Bao Z.Z. Tanaka M. Schott J.J. Izumo S. Cepko C.L. Seidman J.G Seidman C.E. Dev. Biol. 2000; 217: 266-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar), was down-regulated in Bop-null mice, suggesting that IRX4 is regulated, in part, by a m-Bop-Hand2 regulatory cascade (16Gottlieb P.D. Pierce S.A. Sims III, R.J. Weihe E.K. Harriss J.V. Maika S.D. Kuziel W.A. King H.L. Yamagishi H. Olson E.N. Nakagawa O. Srivastava D. Nat. Genet. 2002; 31: 25-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar).In the present studies, the yeast two-hybrid system was employed to identify m-Bop-interacting proteins that are expressed in mouse skeletal muscle. Although m-Bop is expressed equally strongly in heart, skeletal muscle was chosen for study initially because of the availability of mouse cell lines such as C2C12 and 10T1/2 that can be induced to undergo myogenesis in tissue culture. These systems would allow the possibility of overexpression of wild type or mutant m-Bop, its interaction partners, and their fragments to assess effects on myotube formation.The muscle-specific transcription factor skNAC was isolated from a skeletal muscle library screen using GAL4-m-Bop2 as bait (Table I). skNAC has been implicated in activating transcription in a sequence-specific manner and controlling skeletal muscle myogenesis (18Yotov W.V. St-Arnaud R. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1763-1772Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), although its function is poorly understood. Previous studies reported that skNAC activates the myoglobin promoter in a sequence-specific manner, suggesting that it is a sequence-specific transcriptional activator (18Yotov W.V. St-Arnaud R. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1763-1772Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). It was further reported that both skNAC and αNAC bind to the same consensus DNA sequence, thus ascribing the DNA-binding properties of skNAC to residues common with αNAC (18Yotov W.V. St-Arnaud R. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1763-1772Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). However, a recent report demonstrated that αNAC binds nucleic acids non-specifically (23Beatrix B. Sakai H. Wiedmann M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 37838-37845Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), and αNAC has also been reported to bind to four-way junction DNA (24Whitby M.C. Dixon J. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 306: 703-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), reminiscent of HMG-box proteins and the SWI/SNF complex (25Zlatanova J. Van Holde K. FASEB J. 1998; 12: 421-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar).The skNAC fragments isolated using the two-hybrid system associated with m-Bop in 293T cells in coimmunoprecipitation assays (Fig. 2). Whereas, both m-Bop1 and m-Bop2 associated with skNAC, t-Bop, which lacks the heart- and skeletal muscle-specific amino-terminal S region (Fig. 3 A), failed to interact with skNAC in the two-hybrid system and in animal cells (Table I; Fig. 3 B). Because we were unable to obtain expression of full-length skNAC in mammalian cells, m-Bop interaction with in vitro translated full-length skNAC was examined. Recombinant m-Bop2–6XHis was found to interact with in vitro translated full-length skNAC in a specific manner (Fig. 2).Structural mapping revealed that an intact MYND domain and amino-terminal S sequences of m-Bop were required for interaction with skNAC in mammalian cells (Fig. 3). It is likely that these m-Bop domains cooperate with one another to create a structural motif not present in t-Bop, which contains only the MYND domain. The m-Bop interaction domain of skNAC was found to be located in a carboxyl terminal region of skNAC (Fig. 4, A and B). Truncation and site-directed mutagenesis studies demonstrated that a PXLXP sequence (PPLIP) encoded near the end of the large skNAC-specific exon was necessary for m-Bop association (Fig.4, C and D). The PXLXP motif was previously shown to be essential for interaction of the closely related MYND domains of the transcriptional corepressor protein and potential tumor suppressor, BS69, and the Caenorhabditis elegans proteins, Bra-1 and Bra-2, with viral oncoproteins and the Myc-related cellular protein, MGA (10Ansieau S. Leutz A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 4906-4910Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The present results further support a commonality in the interactions of MYND-containing proteins with their protein partners. A second PXLXP motif (PPLEP) is present near the amino terminus of the skNAC-specific exon, suggesting a second potential m-Bop-binding motif. This may explain m-Bop2 binding to premature transcription/translation skNAC fragmentsin vitro (Fig. 2 C). Additional sequences of skNAC may contribute to m-Bop association because FLAG-N5 weakly bound to m-Bop2–6XHis in vitro, although to a substantially lower extent than FLAG-N4 (data not shown).During skeletal muscle differentiation, distinct transcriptional programs direct the proper formation of mature myotubes. In previous studies, skNAC was reported to adversely affect myogenesis when overexpressed in differentiating myotubes (18Yotov W.V. St-Arnaud R. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1763-1772Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). In the present studies, Western blots demonstrate that m-Bop and skNAC are induced within the first 24 h of myogenesis observed in cell culture (Fig. 5). Both proteins continue to be expressed at high levels up to 6 days after induction of differentiation. While m-Bop protein levels remain high, skNAC expression is reduced dramatically 2 weeks after the onset of myogenesis (Fig. 5). Immunofluorescence studies indicated that m-Bop and skNAC were localized in the nucleus early in C2C12 differentiation, followed by greatly enhanced expression in the cytoplasm as myogenesis progressed (Fig. 5). Studies in progress with adenovirus vectors expressing skNAC fragments with the wild type (PPLIPP) or mutant (PPAIPP) m-Bop interaction motifs should yield information on the functional significance of m-Bop/skNAC interaction during skeletal muscle myogenesis. Because m-Bop and skNAC are expressed in the heart and recent studies suggest that they are colocalized in the embryonic heart, 2S. Pierce, R. Sims, D. Srivastava, and P. Gottlieb, unpublished studies. the present studies of skeletal muscle myogenesis should shed light on the role of these proteins in cardiogenesis as well. The control of skeletal and cardiac maturation is ordered in a complex cascade of transcriptional activation and repression. The MyoD and MEF2 families of transcription factors dictate important developmental events that result in the formation of mature skeletal muscle. The MyoD family is comprised of the basic helix-loop-helix proteins MyoD, Myf5, MRF4, and myogenin. These myogenic regulators form heterodimers with the ubiquitous basic helix-loop-helix E proteins that subsequently activate key elements needed for the myogenic program (1Olson E.N. Klein W.H. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (606) Google Scholar). The MEF2 family is defined by the MADS domain and consists of MEF2A, MEF2B, MEF2C, and MEF2D. Members of the MEF2 family are expressed in tissues besides skeletal muscle including cardiac tissue, neurons, and T cells (2Naya F.J. Olson E. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 683-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). Together, the MyoD and MEF2 families cooperate directly and indirectly to transduce the requisite signals for proper skeletal muscle formation. The discovery of chamber-specific transcription factors, such as the Hand1 and Hand2 proteins, has revealed the complex nature of cardiac transcriptional regulation (3Srivastava D. Thomas T. Lin Q. Kirby M.L. Brown D. Olson E.N. Nat. Genet. 1997; 16: 154-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar). The list of genes that correspond to specific cardiac defects continues to grow, whereas the molecular nature of these defects remains largely elusive (4Srivastava D. Olson E.N. Nature. 2000; 407: 221-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar). To further understand the molecular underpinnings of cardiac development, it is critical to identify the relationships of transcriptional regulators shown to be important in cardiac morphogenesis. The Bop gene encodes distinct proteins expressed in skeletal and cardiac muscle, as well as in cytotoxic T lymphocytes. The Bop proteins found in skeletal muscle (m-Bop) and cytotoxic T lymphocytes (t-Bop) are identical over 90% of their primary amino acid sequence, differing only at their extreme amino terminus (5Hwang I.

Furthermore, the homeobox protein IRX4, shown previously to be Hand2-dependent (22Bruneau B.G. Bao Z.Z. Tanaka M. Schott J.J. Izumo S. Cepko C.L. Seidman J.G Seidman C.E. Dev. Biol. 2000; 217: 266-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar), was down-regulated in Bop-null mice, suggesting that IRX4 is regulated, in part, by a m-Bop-Hand2 regulatory cascade (16Gottlieb P.D. Pierce S.A. Sims III, R.J. Weihe E.K. Harriss J.V. Maika S.D. Kuziel W.A. King H.L. Yamagishi H. Olson E.N. Nakagawa O. Srivastava D. Nat. Genet. 2002; 31: 25-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar).In the present studies, the yeast two-hybrid system was employed to identify m-Bop-interacting proteins that are expressed in mouse skeletal muscle. Although m-Bop is expressed equally strongly in heart, skeletal muscle was chosen for study initially because of the availability of mouse cell lines such as C2C12 and 10T1/2 that can be induced to undergo myogenesis in tissue culture. These systems would allow the possibility of overexpression of wild type or mutant m-Bop, its interaction partners, and their fragments to assess effects on myotube formation.The muscle-specific transcription factor skNAC was isolated from a skeletal muscle library screen using GAL4-m-Bop2 as bait (Table I). skNAC has been implicated in activating transcription in a sequence-specific manner and controlling skeletal muscle myogenesis (18Yotov W.V. St-Arnaud R. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1763-1772Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), although its function is poorly understood. Previous studies reported that skNAC activates the myoglobin promoter in a sequence-specific manner, suggesting that it is a sequence-specific transcriptional activator (18Yotov W.V. St-Arnaud R. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1763-1772Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). It was further reported that both skNAC and αNAC bind to the same consensus DNA sequence, thus ascribing the DNA-binding properties of skNAC to residues common with αNAC (18Yotov W.V. St-Arnaud R. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1763-1772Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). However, a recent report demonstrated that αNAC binds nucleic acids non-specifically (23Beatrix B. Sakai H. Wiedmann M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 37838-37845Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), and αNAC has also been reported to bind to four-way junction DNA (24Whitby M.C. Dixon J. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 306: 703-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), reminiscent of HMG-box proteins and the SWI/SNF complex (25Zlatanova J. Van Holde K. FASEB J. 1998; 12: 421-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar).The skNAC fragments isolated using the two-hybrid system associated with m-Bop in 293T cells in coimmunoprecipitation assays (Fig. 2). Whereas, both m-Bop1 and m-Bop2 associated with skNAC, t-Bop, which lacks the heart- and skeletal muscle-specific amino-terminal S region (Fig. 3 A), failed to interact with skNAC in the two-hybrid system and in animal cells (Table I; Fig. 3 B). Because we were unable to obtain expression of full-length skNAC in mammalian cells, m-Bop interaction with in vitro translated full-length skNAC was examined. Recombinant m-Bop2–6XHis was found to interact with in vitro translated full-length skNAC in a specific manner (Fig. 2).Structural mapping revealed that an intact MYND domain and amino-terminal S sequences of m-Bop were required for interaction with skNAC in mammalian cells (Fig. 3). It is likely that these m-Bop domains cooperate with one another to create a structural motif not present in t-Bop, which contains only the MYND domain. The m-Bop interaction domain of skNAC was found to be located in a carboxyl terminal region of skNAC (Fig. 4, A and B). Truncation and site-directed mutagenesis studies demonstrated that a PXLXP sequence (PPLIP) encoded near the end of the large skNAC-specific exon was necessary for m-Bop association (Fig.4, C and D). The PXLXP motif was previously shown to be essential for interaction of the closely related MYND domains of the transcriptional corepressor protein and potential tumor suppressor, BS69, and the Caenorhabditis elegans proteins, Bra-1 and Bra-2, with viral oncoproteins and the Myc-related cellular protein, MGA (10Ansieau S. Leutz A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 4906-4910Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The present results further support a commonality in the interactions of MYND-containing proteins with their protein partners. A second PXLXP motif (PPLEP) is present near the amino terminus of the skNAC-specific exon, suggesting a second potential m-Bop-binding motif. This may explain m-Bop2 binding to premature transcription/translation skNAC fragmentsin vitro (Fig. 2 C). Additional sequences of skNAC may contribute to m-Bop association because FLAG-N5 weakly bound to m-Bop2–6XHis in vitro, although to a substantially lower extent than FLAG-N4 (data not shown).During skeletal muscle differentiation, distinct transcriptional programs direct the proper formation of mature myotubes. In previous studies, skNAC was reported to adversely affect myogenesis when overexpressed in differentiating myotubes (18Yotov W.V. St-Arnaud R. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1763-1772Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). In the present studies, Western blots demonstrate that m-Bop and skNAC are induced within the first 24 h of myogenesis observed in cell culture (Fig. 5). Both proteins continue to be expressed at high levels up to 6 days after induction of differentiation. While m-Bop protein levels remain high, skNAC expression is reduced dramatically 2 weeks after the onset of myogenesis (Fig. 5). Immunofluorescence studies indicated that m-Bop and skNAC were localized in the nucleus early in C2C12 differentiation, followed by greatly enhanced expression in the cytoplasm as myogenesis progressed (Fig. 5). Studies in progress with adenovirus vectors expressing skNAC fragments with the wild type (PPLIPP) or mutant (PPAIPP) m-Bop interaction motifs should yield information on the functional significance of m-Bop/skNAC interaction during skeletal muscle myogenesis. Because m-Bop and skNAC are expressed in the heart and recent studies suggest that they are colocalized in the embryonic heart, 2S. Pierce, R. Sims, D. Srivastava, and P. Gottlieb, unpublished studies. the present studies of skeletal muscle myogenesis should shed light on the role of these proteins in cardiogenesis as well. MYND and SET domains similar to those present in m-Bop are found in proteins linked to transcriptional regulation and are involved in various cellular processes including differentiation, proliferation, and chromatin stability. The Bop gene is expressed in skeletal muscle, heart, and cytotoxic T cells. MYND and SET domains of other proteins have been shown, respectively, to recruit HDACs and to have histone methyltransferase activity, and we have shown previously that m-Bop itself recruits HDACs and can act as a repressor of reporter gene expression in mammalian cells (16Gottlieb P.D. Pierce S.A. Sims III, R.J. Weihe E.K. Harriss J.V. Maika S.D. Kuziel W.A. King H.L. Yamagishi H. Olson E.N. Nakagawa O. Srivastava D. Nat. Genet. 2002; 31: 25-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar).Bop-null mice died in utero at approximately day E10.5 with abnormal hearts having the following characteristics at day E9.5: absence of a right ventricle, poor trabeculation of the left ventricle, and accumulation of an abnormally large amount of extracellular matrix (cardiac jelly) (16Gottlieb P.D. Pierce S.A. Sims III, R.J. Weihe E.K. Harriss J.V. Maika S.D. Kuziel W.A. King H.L. Yamagishi H. Olson E.N. Nakagawa O. Srivastava D. Nat.

Furthermore, the homeobox protein IRX4, shown previously to be Hand2-dependent (22Bruneau B.G. Bao Z.Z. Tanaka M. Schott J.J. Izumo S. Cepko C.L. Seidman J.G Seidman C.E. Dev.

During the investigation of new hERα mRNA variants by rapid amplification of 5′ cDNA ends, we identified a cDNA in which the acceptor site of exon 1A, into which the different leader exons are normally alternatively spliced, was spliced accurately the 3′ extremity of exon 1A (scrambled 1A→1A hERα cDNA). Reverse transcription-PCR and S1 nuclease mapping analysis revealed that 1A→1A hERα transcripts were not circular RNAs constituted by exon 1A only but corresponded to linear polyadenylated hERα RNAs composed of the eight coding exons of the hERα gene and characterized by a duplication of exon 1A. Genomic Southern blot experiments excluded the hypothesis of duplication of hERα exon 1A in the human genome. Therefore, these data suggested that 1A→1A hERα transcripts were likely generated by trans-splicing. The production of such transcripts by trans-splicing of pre-mRNAs generated from a chimeric gene formed by a single hERα exon 1A, exon 2, and their flanking intronic regions was demonstrated in transient transfection experiments.

Nuclear Hormone Receptors: Molecular Mechanisms, Cellular Functions, Clinical abnormalities. Academic Press, London1991Google Scholar). As all members of this family, it modulates transcription of specific sets of genes by interacting either in a protein/DNA manner with cognate DNA sequences called responsive elements or in a protein/protein manner with other transcriptional factors (1Evans R.M.

Science. 1997; 277: 1508-1510Crossref PubMed Scopus (2074) Google Scholar). ERα is a key component of a wide range of biological processes. Its main role is in the control of the reproductive functions such as the establishment and maintenance of female sex differentiation characteristics, reproductive cycle, and pregnancy (6Auchus. R. J., and Fuqua, S. A. W. (1994)Bailliere's Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism: Hormones, Enzymes and Receptors, Vol. 8, pp. 433–449, LondonGoogle Scholar, 7Couse J.F. Korak K.S. Endocr. Rev. 1999; 20: 358-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). ERα is also involved in liver, fat, and bone cell metabolism, cardiovascular and neuronal activity, and embryonic and fetal development (6Auchus. R. J., and Fuqua, S. A. W. (1994)Bailliere's Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism: Hormones, Enzymes and Receptors, Vol. 8, pp. 433–449, LondonGoogle Scholar, 7Couse J.F. Korak K.S. Endocr. Rev. 1999; 20: 358-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). Finally, due to the mitogenic effect of its ligand, ERα is intimately associated with the biology of endometrium and breast cancers (8Henderson B.E. Ross R. Bernstein L. Cancer Res. 1988; 48: 246-253PubMed Google Scholar, 9Jordan V.C. Breast Cancer Res. Treat. 1995; 36: 267-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 10Service R.F. Science. 1998; 279: 1631-1633Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). ER status is used clinically both as a prognostic factor and as a target in the therapy of breast cancers (9Jordan V.C. Breast Cancer Res. Treat. 1995; 36: 267-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Patients with ER-positive tumors have a better prognosis than those with tumors that lack ER expression. The benefits of the anti-estrogen therapy are almost limited to these patients, although quite a number of ER-positive tumors do not respond to endocrine therapy (8Henderson B.E. Ross R. Bernstein L. Cancer Res. 1988; 48: 246-253PubMed Google Scholar, 9Jordan V.C. Breast Cancer Res. Treat. 1995; 36: 267-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). The resistance to hormonal therapy has often been associated with genetic defects within ER biology (11McGuire W.L. Chamness G.C. Fuqua A.W. Mol. Endocrinol. 1991; 5: 1571-1577Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar, 12Watts C.K.W. Handel M.L. King R.J.B. Sutherland C.D. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1992; 41: 529-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Thus, the identification of the molecular mechanisms controlling ERα expression and function and those that may impair ERα biology turned out to be a crucial step for understanding the involvement of the estrogen receptor into several physiological and pathological processes. Mapped to the long arm of chromosome 6 (13Gosden J.R. Middleton P.G. Rout D. Cytogenet. Cell Genet. 1986; 43: 218-220Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the human ERα gene is over 140 kb in length with a coding region split into eight exons (14Ponglikitmongkol M. Green S. Chambon P. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 3385-3388Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar). Our laboratory has recently shown that this gene is in fact a complex genomic unit exhibiting alternative splicing and promoter usage in a tissue-specific manner (15Keaveney M. Klug J. Dawson M.T. Nestor P.V. Neilan J.G. Forde R.C. Gannon F. J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1991; 1: 25-35Google Scholar, 16Flouriot G. Griffin C. Kenealy M.R. Sonntag-Buck V. Gannon F. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 1939-1954Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Using the rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) methodology, we have isolated and characterized several new hERα cDNA isoforms and demonstrated that the hERα transcripts are produced from a single gene by the use of multiple promoters (16Flouriot G. Griffin C. Kenealy M.R. Sonntag-Buck V. Gannon F. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 1939-1954Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Most of these hERα transcripts (A–F) encode a common ERα protein, hERα 66, but differ in their 5′-untranslated region as a consequence of an alternative splicing of several upstream exons (1B–1F) to a common acceptor site located in exon 1A, 5′ to the initiation of translation codon. A new class of hERα transcripts that lack the first coding exon (exon 1A) of the ERα gene was also identified (17Flouriot G. Brand H. Denger S. Metivier R. Kos M. Reid G. Sonntag-Buck V. Gannon F. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4688-4700Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These Δ1A hERα transcripts originate from the E and F hERα promoters and encode the new N-terminal 173-amino acid truncated hERα 46 isoform (17Flouriot G. Brand H. Denger S. Metivier R. Kos M. Reid G. Sonntag-Buck V. Gannon F. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4688-4700Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). During the RACE investigation, we amplified a hERα cDNA fragment in which the 3′ extremity of exon 1A was spliced directly to the acceptor site of the same exon 1A that normally receives the alternative upstream exons 1B–1F. In this present study, we demonstrate that this RACE product was not an artifact but rather results from the amplification of a hERα cDNA with a duplication of exon 1A. The new hERα transcripts correspond to trans-spliced mRNA. The MCF7, T47D, ZR75–1, HEPG2, HOS TE85, SAOS, and HeLa cell lines were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen), penicillin (100 units/ml), and streptomycin (100 μg/ml) at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 incubator. Total RNA from cell lines and tissues was extracted with TRIzol (Invitrogen) as described by the manufacturer. Total RNA from human mammary gland, human endometrium, human brain, human liver, and human skeletal muscle were purchased from CLONTECH. Human pituitary RNA was kindly provided by Professor J. Duval (Université de Rennes, Rennes, France). The pCR-hERα Luc plasmid was constructed as follows: the coding region of the luciferase gene was amplified from the pGL2 vector (Promega) using flanking primers withBamHI restriction sites and was then inserted in theBamHI site of pCR 3.1 (Invitrogen) to obtain the pCR 3.1 Luc plasmid. The genomic fragments, a, b, and c (see Fig. 6), were amplified from the λ GHER 1 and 3 clones in Bluescript (14Ponglikitmongkol M. Green S. Chambon P. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 3385-3388Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar) using the following primers: XbaI-a5′ (5′-ACGTTCTAGATCGCGTTTATTTTAAGCCCAGTCTT-3′) andXhoI-a3′ (5′-ACGTCTCGAGCAGGTAGTAGGGCACCTGCTG-3′) for fragment a; XhoI-b5′ (5′-ACGTCTCGAGGAGAACGAGCCCAGCGCCTAC-3′) and M13 primer for fragment b; and M13 primer and KpnI-c3′ (5′-ACGTGGTACCAGCATAGTCATTGCACACTGC-3′) for fragment c. Fragment a was digested by XbaI and XhoI and subcloned into the XbaI/XhoI site of pST 1 Blue vector to form pST 1 blue vector a. Fragment b was digested byXhoI and EcoRI (site contained in Bluescript sequences) and subcloned into the XhoI/EcoRI site of pST 1 Blue vector a to form pST 1 blue vector a+b. Fragment c was digested by EcoRI and KpnI and subcloned into theEcoRI/KpnI site of pST 1 Blue vector a+b to form pST 1 blue vector a+b+c. Finally, pST 1 blue vector a+b+c was digested by NheI and KpnI, and the fragmentNheI-a+b+c-KpnI was then inserted inNheI/KpnI site of the pCR 3.1 Luc plasmid to form the pCR-hERα Luc plasmid. The trans-spliced hERα mRNA (1A→1A) was cloned by an inverse PCR method (18Zeiner M. Gehring U. BioTechniques. 1994; 17: 1051-1053Google Scholar). Reverse transcription of MCF7 total RNA (10 μg) and second-strand synthesis were performed using a commercial kit (Invitrogen) as recommended by the manufacturer except that the hERα gene-specific primer IV (5′-CTCACAGGACCAGACTCCATAATGGTA-3′) located in exon 2 was used instead of the usual oligo(dT) primer (see Fig. 1). Subsequently, the cDNA was circularized in the presence of T4 DNA ligase and submitted to 35 rounds of PCR amplification using the sense primer X (5′-ACTCAACAGCGTGTCTCCGAG-3′) and the antisense primer VI (5′-TTGGATCTGATGCAGTAGGGC-3′) (see Fig. 1). The main PCR product was subcloned in the TA cloning vector pCR 2.1 (Invitrogen) and then sequenced by the dideoxy chain termination method. cDNAs were synthesized from 1 μg of total RNA following reverse transcription with 50 units of ExpandTM reverse transcriptase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) under the conditions recommended by the supplier using the oligonucleotide primer V (5′-TCTGACCGTAGACCTGCG-3′) from hERα exon 1A (see Figs. 2 B and 5 A), primer IV from hERα exon 2 (see Figs. 1 and 6 B), primer I (5′-TTGGCTAAAGTGGTGCATGATGAGG-3′) from the 3′-untranslated region of hERα mRNAs (exon 8) (see Fig. 5 B), or primer L1 (5′-TCTAGAGGATAGAATGGCGC-3′) from the luciferase coding region in pCR-hERα Luc plasmid (see Fig. 6 B). 2.5 μl of the reverse transcriptase reactions resulting from primer V were used as templates in either a 30-cycle PCR amplification using primer X and primer VI (see Fig. 2) or in two rounds of 30-cycle PCR amplification using the 5′ primer VIII (5′-GCCGGTTTCTGAGCCTTCTG-3′) and nested primer IX (5′-ATGACCATGACCCTCCACACCAAAGC-3′) with the 3′ primer VI and nested primer VII (5′-AAGGCTCAGAAACCGGCGGG-3′) (see Fig.5 A). cDNAs reverse-transcribed from primer IV were amplified by PCR (30 cycles) using either the 5′ primer X and the 3′ primer VI (see Fig. 1) or the 5′ primer XI (5′-TTTCCTGCAGCCCCACGGCCAG-3′) and the 3′ primer VI (see Fig.6 B).Figure 5Exonic organization of 1A→1A hERα transcripts. A, RT-PCR analysis of the exonic organization in 5′ to the 1A→1A junction. Primer V, located in exon 1A, was used to prime hERα cDNA synthesis by reverse transcriptase using total RNA from various sources as indicated at the top of each lane. Yeast total RNA was used as a negative control. Primer VIII, which is located between the acceptor splice site of exon 1A and the ATG, was then used in a first round of PCR amplification with primer VI, which is nested to primer V in exon 1A. This PCR reaction should give rise to two hERα products as indicated on the schematic diagram. The shortest product corresponds to an amplification inside of exon 1A. To specifically reamplify 1A→1A hERα cDNAs, a second round of PCR reaction was performed with primers IX and VII. B, RT-PCR analysis of the exonic organization in 3′ to the 1A→1A junction. Primer I, located in exon 8, was used to prime hERα cDNA synthesis by reverse transcriptase using total RNA from various sources. Yeast total RNA was used as a negative control. Primer X, located in the 3′ part of exon 1A, was used in a first round of PCR amplification with primer II in exon 8. As mentioned previously forpanel A, the first PCR reaction should give rise to two hERα products (see the schematic diagram). To specifically reamplify 1A→1A hERα cDNAs, a second round of PCR reaction was performed with primers VIII and III. An oligonucleotide probe from exon A1 (P2) was used to confirm the specificity of the PCR products in panels A and B. Positions of migration of the molecular size markers are shown on theleft side of the figures.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) 2.5 μl of the reverse transcriptase reactions resulting from primer I were used in two rounds of 30-cycle PCR amplification (see Fig.5 B). The 5′ primer and nested primer used were X and VIII, respectively. The 3′ primer II (5′-ATTATCTGAACCGTGTGGGAG-3′) and the nested primer III (5′-CGTGAAGTACGACATGTCTAC-3′) were from the 3′-untranslated region of hER cDNAs (exon 8). Both rounds of amplification were performed using the ExpandTM long template PCR system (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) as recommended by the manufacturer. Finally, single-stranded cDNAs reverse-transcribed from primer L1 were subjected to either a 30-cycle PCR amplification using the 5′ primer VIII and the 3′ primer L2 (5′-CGGGCCTTTCTTTATGTTTT-3′) (see Fig.6 A) or two rounds of 30-cycle PCR amplification using the 5′ primer X and nested primer XI with the 3′ primer L2 and nested primer VI (see Fig. 6 B). 5 μl from each reaction were analyzed on 1% agarose gels and transferred to nylon membranes (Hybond N+, Amersham Biosciences) with 20× SSC as transfer solution. The membranes were incubated in a prehybridization buffer containing 6× SSC, 5× Denhart's solution, 0.05% sodium pyrophosphate, 100 μg/ml salmon sperm DNA, and 0.5% SDS at 37 °C for 1 h. Then, the membranes were hybridized in 6× SSC, 1× Denhart's solution, 0.05% sodium pyrophosphate, 100 μg/ml yeast tRNA with the oligonucleotide probe P1 (5′-GTGTGGAGGGTCATGGTCAT-3′) (see Figs. 1, 2, and 6 B), P2 (5′-TCTGACCGTAGACCTGCG-3′) (see Fig. 5), or P3 (primerXhoI-a3′) (see Fig. 6 B) from exon 1A, which had been end-labeled using T4 polynucleotide kinase and [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol). Biotinylated single-stranded DNA templates were used to prepare highly labeled single-stranded DNA probes by extension from a specific primer with T7 DNA polymerase in the presence of [α-32P]dCTP (3000 Ci/mmol) (19Flouriot G. Nestor P. Kenealy M. Pope C. Gannon F. Anal. Biochem. 1996; 237: 159-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The origin of probe 1A→1A (see Fig. 2 A) template was an RT-PCR product that was amplified using the upstream primer XII (5′-GGCCCGCCGGCATTCTACAG-3′, located in exon 1A) with the downstream primer V and then subcloned downstream of T7 in the TA cloning vector pCR 2.1 (Invitrogen). A PCR reaction was performed using a biotinylated T7 primer with M13 reverse primer to obtain probe 1A→1A template. To prepare the template used to make the probe 1A→1A-2 (see Fig.4 B), an RT-PCR reaction was performed with the 5′ primer XIII (5′-GGCCCGCCGGCATTCTACAGGTGGCCCGCCGGTTTCTGAC-3′, the primer mapping the splice junction 1A→1A) and the 3′ primer XIV (5′-CAGATTCCATAGCCATAC-3′, located in exon 2). The RT-PCR product was subcloned downstream of T7 in the TA cloning vector pCR 2.1 (Invitrogen), and a PCR reaction was performed using a biotinylated T7 primer with M13 reverse primer. Biotinylated PCR products were bound to streptavidin-coated magnetic beads (Dynal) as recommended by the manufacturer, and the nonbiotinylated DNA strands were removed by denaturation with 0.1m NaOH. 1A→1A and 1A→1A-2 S1 single-stranded DNA probes were obtained by extending the respective V (in exon 1A), and XIV (in exon 2) primers annealed to the corresponding biotinylated single-stranded template. After elution of the single-stranded DNA probes by alkaline treatment and magnetic separation, the probe was then purified on a sequencing gel. 105 cpm of probe were coprecipitated with 30 μg of total RNA and then dissolved in 20 μl of hybridization buffer (80% formamide, 40 mm PIPES, pH 6.4, 400 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8) denatured at 70 °C for 10 min and hybridized overnight at 55 °C. Digestion with S1 digestions were then carried out as described previously (20Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. Greene Publishing Associates and Wiley-Interscience, New York1987Google Scholar), and the samples were electrophoresed through a denaturing polyacrylamide/urea gels. 20 μg of human genomic DNA (CLONTECH) were digested with EcoRI andBamHI restriction enzymes (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), resolved on 0.8% agarose gel, transferred to a nylon membrane (Hybond N+, Amersham Biosciences), and hybridized with the random primed32P-labeled probe 1A, as recommended by the manufacturers. Probe 1A is a genomic fragment from exon 1A (+171 to +610 (21Green S. Walter P. Kumar V. Krust A. Bornert J.M. Argos P. Chambon P. Nature. 1986; 320: 134-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (1965) Google Scholar)) obtained by PCR amplification. To amplify new 5′ mRNA extremities of the hERα gene, a 5′ RACE approach based on a variation of the inverse PCR technique was performed on MCF7 hERα cDNA synthesized from primer IV located in exon 2 (Fig. 1 A). Sequence analysis of the main RACE product (282 bp) showed that it corresponded to scrambled 1A→1A hERα transcripts with the donor site of exon 1A joined to the acceptor site of exon 1A (Fig. 1 B), a site where the alternative upstream exons 1B–1F are normally spliced (16Flouriot G. Griffin C. Kenealy M.R. Sonntag-Buck V. Gannon F. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 1939-1954Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It should be noted that the hERα cDNA circularization step in the 5′ RACE approach was not required to amplify the 1A→1A hERα RACE product, which might explain its abundance. To confirm the existence of such hERα transcripts, an S1 nuclease mapping experiment was performed on total RNA from various tissues or cell lines. The single-stranded DNA S1 probe 1A→1A was prepared from a 1A→1A hERα RT-PCR product as described under “Experimental Procedures.” This probe included 3′ end exon 1A sequences spliced to 5′ end exon 1A sequences and thus would not be completely protected if the standard transcripts were the only species presents. After hybridizing probe 1A→1A with the RNA samples and S1 nuclease digestion, two protected fragments of 296 and 316 nucleotides were detected (Fig.2 A). As expected, the smallest fragment corresponded to normal A-F hERα mRNAs, which remained homologous to probe 1A→1A as far as the acceptor splice site of exon 1A and then diverged in their 5′ ends from probe complementary to 1A→1A sequences (16Flouriot G. Griffin C. Kenealy M.R. Sonntag-Buck V. Gannon F. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 1939-1954Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The level and pattern of distribution of these hERα mRNAs were as described previously (16Flouriot G. Griffin C. Kenealy M.R. Sonntag-Buck V. Gannon F. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 1939-1954Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The second protected fragment corresponded in size to a full protection of a hERα-specific sequence of the probe and therefore resulted from a hybridization with 1A→1A hERα transcripts (Fig. 2 A). It was only weakly detected from MCF7 and T47D RNA samples. To study the tissue distribution of 1A→1A hERα transcripts by a more sensitive approach, an RT-PCR analysis was performed on the RNA samples reverse-transcribed from a hERα gene-specific primer (V) chosen in exon 1A (Fig. 2 B). This study showed that 1A→1A hERα transcripts were detected by RT-PCR in tissues and cell lines expressing a relatively high level of normal hERα transcripts, for instance the mammary gland and the cell lines MCF7, T47D, and ZR75, which derive from this tissue, the endometrium, and the liver (Fig.2 B). It should be noted, however, that no amplification of 1A→1A hERα transcripts was obtained from ovary despite the detection of normal hERα transcripts by S1 nuclease mapping in this tissue. To determine whether a hERα exon 1A duplication is present in the genome, human genomic DNA was digested withEcoRI and BamHI restriction enzymes and hybridized with an exon 1A probe (Fig.3). The results of the Southern blot of both genomic digestions revealed a single hybridizing band, the size of which was in total agreement with the restriction enzyme map of the λ GHERα clones published previously (14Ponglikitmongkol M. Green S. Chambon P. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 3385-3388Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar). Therefore, exon 1A of the hERα gene was not duplicated. Two other mechanisms might explain the detection of 1A→1A hERα transcripts: 1) the formation of circular 1A→1A hERα transcripts constituted by exon 1A only or 2) a trans-splicing reaction occurring naturally between two hERα pre-mRNAs (Fig.4 A). In this last case, 1A→1A hERα transcripts should contain additional exons of the hERα gene. To discriminate between these two hypotheses, an S1 nuclease mapping experiment was carried out using a probe designed to protect trans-spliced hERα transcripts with a 1A→1A-2 exon organization. Thus, if a trans-splicing reaction occurs for the hERα gene, then the corresponding protected fragment would be 624 nucleotides in size. On the other hand, the protection of a circular 1A→1A hERα transcript by probe 1A→1A-2 would give rise to a fragment of the size of exon 1A, 521 nucleotides. The S1 nuclease mapping analysis of MCF7 total RNA by probe 1A→1A-2 is shown in Fig.4 B. In addition to the 604-nucleotide fragment that results from a protection of probe 1A→1A-2 by normal hERα transcripts up to the acceptor splice site of exon 1A, the results also showed a protected fragment of 624 nucleotides in size, thus demonstrating the trans-splicing origin of the scrambled 1A→1A hERα transcripts. This result was strengthened by the detection of the 1A→1A-2 protected fragment in the RNA poly(A+) fraction, which indicated that 1A→1A hERα transcripts are polyadenylated molecules. Finally, no protected fragment corresponding in size to circular 1A→1A hERα transcripts was seen in this S1 nuclease mapping experiment. Since 1A→1A hERα transcripts should contain the remaining exonic segments of the hERα gene that a trans-splicing process would be likely to generate, the exonic organization of 1A→1A hERα transcripts was investigated. Firstly, to verify that a full exon 1A was present in 5′ to the 1A→1A junction, hERα transcripts from various sources of RNA were reverse-transcribed from primer V in exon 1A, and two rounds of PCR were then performed to amplify a fragment of 1A→1A hERα cDNAs containing the anticipated sequences as illustrated in Fig. 5 A. A PCR product of the expected size was amplified from the tissues or the cell lines in which the 1A→1A hERα transcript was detected previously by RT-PCR (Fig. 5 B). The specificity of this product was further confirmed by Southern blot using the exon 1A-specific oligonucleotide probe P2. Secondly, to demonstrate that full-length 1A→1A hERα transcripts had hERα sequences from exon 1A through to exon 8 (3′ to the 1A→1A junction), PCR analysis was performed on single-strand cDNAs synthesized using a hERα gene-specific primer (I) chosen from the hERα mRNA 3′-untranslated region sequences (exon 8, Fig. 5 B). 1A→1A hERα cDNAs were amplified by two rounds of PCR using the 3′ primer II and nested primer III located upstream from primer I in exon 8 in combination with the 5′ primer X and nested primer VIII (Fig.5 B). It should be noted that the first round of PCR amplified both 1A→1A and normal hERα cDNAs. Only the second round allowed to be specifically amplified 1A→1A hERα cDNAs. Results showed that the size of the amplified cDNAs was as expected, and after Southern blotting, the hybridization of these PCR products with various oligonucleotide probes recognizing specifically the different eight coding exons of the hERα gene demonstrated that sequences from exon 1A to exon 8 were present in 1A→1A hERα transcripts (Fig. 5 B only shows the results obtained with the exon 1A-specific oligonucleotide probe P2). In conclusion, these data clearly demonstrated the existence of a new class of hERα mRNAs that presents a duplication of exon 1A and which is likely generated by a trans-splicing event between two hERα pre-mRNAs. To further define the mechanism generating 1A→1A hERα transcripts, a chimeric gene called pCR-hERα Luc was constructed and analyzed for its ability to generate 1A→1A trans-spliced transcripts after transient expression in the MCF7 cell line. pCR-hERα Luc was formed by the cytomegalovirus promoter, the hERα genomic region from exon 1B to an EcoRI restriction site in the 3′-flanking intronic region of exon 1A, a part of hERα exon 2 and its 5′-flanking sequence to an EcoRI restriction site, the luciferase coding region, and the 3′-untranslated region of the bovine growth hormone (see “Experimental Procedures” for the construction of pCR-hERα Luc) (Fig.6 A). To discriminate 1A→1A hERα cDNAs generated from the chimeric gene from those arising from the standard hERα gene expression in MCF7 cells, anXhoI restriction site was created in the 3′ extremity of exon 1A of pCR-hERα Luc gene. Thus, total RNA prepared from MCF7 transiently transfected with pCR-hERα Luc was used to reverse-transcribe hERα Luc mRNA from primer L1 located in the 5′ end of the luciferase coding region. As illustrated in Fig.6 A, hERα Luc mRNA was accurately matured since the size of the hERα Luc cDNA PCR-amplified between exon 1A and the luciferase coding region indicated that exon 1A was spliced as expected to exon 2 with the removal of the ∼2.5-kb intronic region. Then, in attempt to amplify trans-spliced 1A→1A hERα Luc cDNAs, two rounds of PCR were performed on hERα Luc cDNAs reverse-transcribed from primer L1 as described in Fig.6 B. The result showed one main PCR product, the size of which was in agreement with the one expected from the amplification of 1A→1A cDNAs (Fig. 6 B). This result was confirmed by Southern blotting and by hybridization of the PCR product with two oligonucleotide probes, P1 and P3, that recognized the 5′ and 3′ extremities of exon 1A, respectively. Finally, the digestion of the amplified cDNA by the restriction enzyme XhoI generated two fragments of the expected size, which were selectively identified by the two probes P1 and P3, thus confirming the pCR-hERα Luc chimeric gene origin of the amplified trans-spliced 1A→1A cDNA. Used as a control, trans-spliced 1A→1A hERα cDNAs generated from the endogenous hERα gene were also analyzed in parallel. These data demonstrated that a single model gene formed by hERα exon 1A, exon 2, and their flanking intronic regions is able to generate trans-spliced 1A→1A hERα transcripts and therefore contains all information required for this process. In this investigation, we have demonstrated that the human estrogen receptor-α gene is able to generate novel hERα mRNAs by trans-splicing. The new class of hERα mRNAs presents a duplication of exon 1A and is referred to as trans-spliced 1A→1A hERα transcripts. Heterogeneity in the 5′ ends of mRNAs generated by alternative promoter usage and splicing is a common featu"

The senses of balance, touch, and hearing are but a few of the systems within humans that are dependent upon this ability. Microorganisms, too, must detect forces resulting from osmotic gradients across their cellular envelope. Electrophysiological studies in essentially all of these systems have implicated mechanosensitive (MS)1 channels as one of the major mechanisms by which these forces are sensed (see Ref. 1Hamill O. Martinac B. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 685-740Crossref PubMed Scopus (906) Google Scholar for review of MS channels). Despite their importance to human life and health, little is known of how eukaryotic MS channels function in vivo, and functional reconstitution of such a channel into a defined lipid system has not yet been reported. In contrast, prokaryotic and archaeal MS channels have been well characterized and serve as model systems where general mechanisms of gating may be studied. The first gene shown to encode an MS channel activity wasmscL (for mechanosensitivechannel of large conductance), which was originally isolated from Escherichia coli in 1994 (2Sukharev S.I. Blount P.

Functional reconstitution of this purified protein in proteoliposomes demonstrated that themscL gene, with no other auxiliary proteins, was all that was necessary for channel activity (10Yoshimura K.

It is now clear that this channel plays a vital role in osmoregulation by opening a large conductance pore in response to acute decreases in osmotic environment, referred to as osmotic downshock, thus playing the role of an in vivo “emergency release valve.” Because of its tractability and parsimonious design, this channel is emerging as a paradigm for mechanically induced channel gating.

J. 2001; 81: 1345-1358Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) have further refined our understanding of this channel. From an early study of bacterial mechanosensitive channel activities, it became clear that that there was at least one additional majorE. coli MS activity, MscS (mechanosensitive channel ofsmaller conductance), that could be reconstituted in azolectin proteoliposomes and remain electrophysiologically active (18Sukharev S.I. Martinac B. Arshavsky V.Y. Kung C. Biophys. J. 1993; 65: 177-183Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). However, the molecular entity(s) responsible for MscS activity remained undefined. Although homologues of MscL are observed throughout the bacterial kingdom (19Maurer J. Elmore D. Lester H. Dougherty D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 22238-22244Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 20Moe P.C. Blount P. Kung C. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 28: 583-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar), and in all cases studied have been shown to encode MS channels (20Moe P.C. Blount P. Kung C. Mol.

Chem. 2000; 275: 31121-31127Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), no homologues were found withinE. coli that could encode the MscS activity, thus implying it belonged to a new gene family. Recently, Levina et al.(22Levina N. Totemeyer S. Stokes N.R. Louis P. Jones M.A. Booth I.R. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1730-1737Crossref PubMed Scopus (540) Google Scholar) described a gain-of-function (GOF) mutant of the E. coli kefA (also in the data base as aefA) gene, which subsequently led to the discovery of a large family of genes. In this study, the authors demonstrated that a double null mutant of kefA and a homologue, yggB, led to anE. coli strain lacking detectable MscS activity. Although the ΔkefA strain contained MscS activity essentially indistinguishable from the wild-type strain, the ΔyggBstrain expressed an MscS activity in only a minority of patches, and it did not desensitize as readily as most activities observed in the parental strain. In addition, although the Δygg,ΔmscL, but not the ΔkefA,ΔmscL, strain exhibited cell lysis upon acute osmotic downshock, there was no apparent increase in this phenotype in the triple null mutant. Although yggB andkefA are apparently functionally related, and have homologues in essentially all bacterial species, they bear no obvious relation to MscL, suggesting a distinct family. Although it remained unclear whether kefA and yggB normally formed a heteromultimer, formed two distinct homomultimers (or monomers), or were simply regulators, it was clear that YggB played a critical role in sustaining the MscS activity and in osmoregulation. Here, we have utilized the previous observation that this channel can survive biochemical purification and subsequent reconstitution to confirm that, similar to MscL, no other proteins are necessary for activity. We have also utilized a random mutagenesis approach to isolate a mutant yielding a GOF phenotype. Whole-cell physiological data from the isolated mutant are consistent with the hypothesis that the mutation within YggB leads to a channel that leaks solutes, including potassium and protons. The location of the lesion within the protein is analogous in position and character to mutations previously noted in MscL that were isolated in an identical screen and that yield a similar phenotype. TheE. coli strain MJF451 (ΔyggB) (22Levina N. Totemeyer S. Stokes N.R. Louis P. Jones M.A. Booth I.R. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1730-1737Crossref PubMed Scopus (540) Google Scholar) was used to host expression constructs and for growth studies. Many experiments were repeated in PB111, a ΔrecA variant of this strain, generated as previously described for PB104 (2Sukharev S.I. Blount P. Martinac B. Blattner F.R. Kung C. Nature. 1994; 368: 265-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (581) Google Scholar, 23Blount P. Sukharev S.I. Moe P.C. Schroeder M.J. Guy H.R. Kung C. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4798-4805Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar); similar results were obtained for expression within MJF451 or PB111. The E. coli strain MJF455 (ΔmscL::Cm,ΔyggB) (22Levina N. Totemeyer S. Stokes N.R. Louis P. Jones M.A. Booth I.R. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1730-1737Crossref PubMed Scopus (540) Google Scholar), a derivative of Frag1 (24Epstein W. Davies M. J. Bacteriol. 1970; 101: 836-843Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and PB112, a ΔrecA variant of the former strain, were utilized in experiments to determine whether wild-type and mutated YggB remediate the osmotic downshock-induced lysis phenotype. All cultures were grown at 37 °C with orbital shaking at 250 rpm in one of the three following media (as indicated): Lennox Broth (LB), K10 (25Epstein W. Kim B.S. J. Bacteriol. 1971; 108: 639-644Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (46 mm Na2HPO4, 23 mm NaH2PO4, 8 mm(NH)2SO4, 0.4 mm MgSO4, 6 μm FeSO4, 1 μg of thiamine, 0.2% glucose, 10 mm KCl), or McIlvaine's medium (pH 7.0) (26-Google Scholar) (60 mm Na2HPO4, 5 mmKH2PO4, 7 mm citric acid, 8 mm (NH4)2SO4, 0.4 mm MgSO4, 6 μm FeSO4, 1 μg of thiamine, 0.2% glucose). For plasmid-bearing strains ampicillin (100 μg/ml) was added; expression was induced where indicated by addition of isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) (1 mm). Expression was induced for 20 min to 1 h forin vivo experiments, and 2 h for electrophysiological experiments. Growth curves were generated from cultures of E. coli PB111 expressing the YggB protein in trans and treated (or not) with 1 mm IPTG to induce expression at the times indicated. Cell viability was determined by diluting cultures into medium or buffer in 20-fold serial dilutions, plating onto LB ampicillin agar plates, and counting the resulting colony-forming units (CFU) per OD600 unit after incubation at 37 °C for 15 h. The polyhistidine-tagged wild-type YggB protein and V40D mutant YggB were purified and reconstituted as previously described (21Moe P. Levin G. Blount P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 31121-31127Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were grown in LB and expression induced by 1 mm IPTG (1 mm) for 1 h. The cells were washed twice with the following buffer: 50 mmpotassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4), 5 mmMgSO4, and 1 mm dithiothreitol. The cells were then treated with 1 mg/ml lysozyme, 0.5 μg/ml DNase, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride for 15 min at room temperature; additional lysozyme (1 mg/ml) was then added and the sample incubated for an additional 15 min. The cells were disrupted by French press twice at 16,000 p.s.i. Unbroken cells and cell debris were pelleted at 6,000 × g for 10 min, and membrane vesicles were isolated from the supernatant by ultracentrifugation (Beckman Ultra TLA100.3 rotor) at 265,000 × g for 30 min, and stored at −80 °C until use. To extract the proteins, the membrane pellet (∼0.5 g) was resuspended in 8 ml of extraction buffer (300 mm NaCl, 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 8.0), 20 mm imidazole, and 3% octyl glucoside (Anatrace)) and sheared to homogeneity in a glass Dounce homogenizer. Insoluble particles were removed by ultracentrifugation (Beckman Ultra TLA100.3 rotor) at 346,000 × g for 20 min. The supernatant was incubated at 4 °C for 30 min with 0.5 ml, washed, equilibrated with nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (Qiagen), and packed in a Poly-prep column (Bio-Rad). The column was washed with 10 bed volumes of extraction buffer and then eluted by an elution buffer: 300 mm NaCl, 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 8.0), 1% octyl glucoside, and a one-bed volume step gradient of 50, 75, and 200 mm imidazole. The eluted fractions were resolved in a 12% SDS-PAGE minigel (Bio-Rad) and stained with Coomassie Blue. An apparently homogeneous fraction bearing a 30-kDa band of purified YggB was selected for reconstitution, at a 1:500 (w/w) protein:lipid ratio, into defined membranes consisting of dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DOPC) and 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine (DOPE) in a 1:1 mass ratio using techniques described previously (21Moe P. Levin G. Blount P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 31121-31127Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The reconstituted proteoliposomes were assayed for functional MS channel activity as described previously (21Moe P. Levin G. Blount P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 31121-31127Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Briefly, rehydrated proteoliposomes were patch clamped under symmetrical buffer conditions; 150 mm KCl, 30 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, 10 μm CaCl2, 5 mm HEPES (pH 7.2). Recordings were performed at +20 mV (electrode). Data were acquired at a sampling rate of 20 kHz with a 5-kHz filtration using an AxoPatch 200B amplifier in conjunction with Axoscope software (Axon). A piezoelectric pressure transducer (World Precision Instruments) was used to follow the pressure response of the channels. The wild-typeyggB gene (P11666) was amplified from a pET21 vector containing this gene as an insert (kindly supplied by Dr. I. R. Booth) by PCR using Vent DNA polymerase and standard reaction conditions (27Innis M.A. Gelfand D.H. Sninsky J.J. White T.J. PCR Protocols: A Guide to Methods and Applications. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego1990Google Scholar). Linkers, SalI (5′) and NotI (3′), were added to facilitate the directional cloning of the fragment into pB10b, and a hexahistidine tag was inserted at the carboxyl terminus. The oligonucleotide primers used were 5′ linker GTC GAC GTC GAC CCC TCT AGA AAT AAT TTT GTT T and 3′ linkers CGC TTA GTG GTG GTG GTG GTG ATG CGC AGC TTT GTC TTC TTT and GCG GCC GCG CGG CCG CTT AGT GGT GGT GGT GGT GAT GCG CAG C, which were used in two successive amplifications. For molecular manipulation, the yggB gene was initially ligated into the polylinker of the vector pBluescript II (Stratagene). The sequence was verified, the plasmid amplified, and the insert subsequently transferred to the expression vector pB10b (12Ou X.R. Blount P. Hoffman R.J. Kung C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 11471-11475Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 20Moe P.C. Blount P. Kung C. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 28: 583-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar,23Blount P. Sukharev S.I. Moe P.C. Schroeder M.J. Guy H.R. Kung C. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4798-4805Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar) for inducible expression in trans. Random mutagenesis was performed by two methods. First, the mutator strain E. coli XL1-RED (Stratagene) was transformed with the pB10b/yggB plasmid DNA, grown, and isolated as recommended by the manufacturer. Mutated yggB was subsequently subcloned into pB10b for expression screening. Second, error-prone PCR usingTaq polymerase and varying MnCl2 concentrations was used as outlined in established protocols (28Cadwell R.C. Joyce G.F. PCR Methods Appl. 1994; 3: S136-S140Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar, 29Miyazaki H. Arnord F. J. Mol. Evol. 1999; 49: 716-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Reaction products were gel-purified and ligated into pB10b. The ΔyggB E. coli strain, PB111, was used to host the mutated yggB expression plasmid for screening purposes. As described previously (12Ou X.R. Blount P. Hoffman R.J. Kung C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 11471-11475Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar), newly transformed cells were initially cultured on LB-ampicillin plates at 37 °C for 15 h. Subsequently, colonies were replica plated onto LB-ampicillin with 1 mm IPTG and grown at 37 °C for 15 h. GOF mutants were scored for suppressed growth in the presence of IPTG-induced expression. Colonies showing such depressed growth were streak-purified and re-screened. Persistence of phenotype received a positive score, and plasmid DNA was isolated, PB111 retransformed, and the resulting colony streak-purified and re-screened. The two clones that maintained the phenotype under these conditions were sequenced on both strands, by automated sequencing (PerkinElmer Life Sciences), and analyzed using GENETYX-MAC/version 8.0 (Software Development Co., Tokyo, Japan) and DNASTAR (Madison, WI). Such analysis demonstrated that both clones, resulting from a single error-prone PCR reaction, were identical in the mutated residues. Site-directed mutants of YggB at the Val-40 residue were generated by utilizing a QuikChangeTM site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) following the manufacturer's recommendations. The Val-40 codon, GTT, was changed as follows: V40D (GAT), V40N (AAT), V40G (GGT), V40C (TGT), and V40K (AAA). Similarly, the Gly-41 codon GGT was changed to AGT to generate the single-site G41S mutation. Steady state intracellular potassium was assayed as previously described (12Ou X.R. Blount P. Hoffman R.J. Kung C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 11471-11475Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 13Blount P. Schroeder M.J. Kung C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32150-32157Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were grown in K10 medium; at OD600 of 0.4, the cells were diluted 1:2 with the same medium plus salts to obtain a final NaCl concentration of 350 mm. IPTG (1 mm) was added at this time to the culture, and growth was continued for 1 h. To harvest, 1 ml of the culture was filtered onto a 25-mm diameter 0.45-μm nitrocellulose filter (Millipore) and washed with 3 ml of 37 °C K0 buffer (46 mm Na2HPO4, 23 mm NaH2PO4, and 8 mm(NH4)2SO4) with 350 mmNaCl. The filters were then placed in a 50-ml plastic beaker and dried at 80–95 °C overnight; solutes within the dried filters were then resuspended in 3–4 ml of double-distilled water. The resulting solution was then assayed for potassium by flame photometry (Buck Scientific, PFP7). For the combined osmotic and acid shock experiments, cells were grown in McIlvaine's medium (pH 7.0). At early log phase, the culture was diluted into the same medium to a final concentration of 0.6m NaCl. At an OD600 of ∼0.2, the cells were induced with IPTG (1 mm) and growth continued for 20 min. The cells were diluted 1:20 in McIlvaine's medium with the NaCl concentration and pH indicated in text and legend of Fig. 4. After incubation for 30 min, the cultures were diluted in isotonic buffer and viability determined as described above. A previously published approach (21Moe P. Levin G. Blount P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 31121-31127Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) was utilized to determine whether the wild-type or mutated YggB could remediate the osmotic downshock-induced lysis phenotype of the ΔyggB,ΔmscL double-null strains (MJF455 and PB112; see above). Briefly, cells were grown to early log phase in LB, diluted 1:2 with the same medium plus salt to achieve a 0.5m NaCl final concentration. At this time protein expression was induced by addition of 1 mm IPTG. After 1 h of growth, the cells were diluted 1:20 in sterile water (or isotonic medium as the control) and incubated for 20 min prior to viability determination. Six histidine codons were fused in frame proximal to the stop codon of the yggB gene. This allowed purification to near homogeneity by a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid column (Fig. 1). When this fraction was reconstituted in synthetic lipids (DOPC:DOPE, 1:1), and examined by patch clamp analysis, MscS activity essentially indistinguishable from that observed in native membranes was observed (Fig. 1). The conductance at positive and negative potentials, the absence of rectification, and the reversibility of channel desensitization for the channels were similar to those previously found in spheroplast preparations (12Ou X.R. Blount P. Hoffman R.J. Kung C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 11471-11475Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 22Levina N. Totemeyer S. Stokes N.R. Louis P. Jones M.A. Booth I.R.

A. 1987; 84: 2297-2301Crossref PubMed Scopus (522) Google Scholar). In addition, expression of the tagged protein reconstituted normal activity in E. coli strains deleted of the endogenous yggB gene (MJF451 and PB111; data not shown). Hence, the carboxyl-terminal histidine tag does not appear to alter channel activity. In addition, the data indicate that, similar to MscL, YggB directly senses and responds to membrane tension; no other components are necessary. Two independent strategies were utilized to randomly mutagenize the yggBgene: passage through the Stratagene XL-1 Red mutagenic E. coli strain, and error-prone PCR, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Because the polyhistidine-tagged protein functioned normally (above and Fig. 1), this modified protein was used for these mutagenesis studies and all subsequent experiments. Cells exhibiting a GOF phenotype of no, or slowed, growth upon expression of mutated YggB were isolated by using a replica plate strategy previously described for MscL (12Ou X.R. Blount P. Hoffman R.J. Kung C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 11471-11475Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar) and outlined under “Experimental Procedures.” Of ∼750,000 colonies screened, all expressing YggB with various degrees of mutation, only two clones were isolated from a single high mutation frequency error-prone PCR protocol. Upon sequencing the mutated yggB genes, three identical mutations were found within both clones: a T to A mutation, yielding a valine to aspartate transition at position 40; a G to A mutation, leading to a glycine to serine transition at position 41; and a T to A, which is a silent mutation maintaining the residue at position 67 as an alanine. To test if the phenotype was attributable primarily, or exclusively, to one of the missense mutations, each was generated individually by site-directed mutagenesis. Expression of YggB bearing only the V40D mutation reconstituted the full GOF phenotype; no significant perturbation of growth was observed for the G41S mutated YggB (not shown). As with MscL GOF mutants, the phenotype also was observed in liquid culture (11Yoshimura K. Batiza A. Schroeder M. Blount P. Kung C. Biophys. J. 1999; 77: 1960-1972Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 12Ou X.R. Blount P. Hoffman R.J. Kung C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 11471-11475Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 13Blount P. Schroeder M.J. Kung C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32150-32157Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig.2, uninduced cultures grow normally; however, IPTG-induced expression of the V40D YggB mutated protein, but not wild-type or vector controls, led to a cessation of normal growth. Previously, in similar studies with MscL, we found that severe mutations can either lead to cell death or retard growth (12Ou X.R. Blount P. Hoffman R.J. Kung C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 11471-11475Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 13Blount P. Schroeder M.J. Kung C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32150-32157Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Hence, we tested viability in cultures identical to Fig. 2 in which the cells had been induced (or not) for 1 h. All cultures, including the induced V40D YggB strains, showed normal viability (ranging from 2 to 5 × 108 CFU/OD600 unit) with no significant differences. Hence, expression of the YggB V40D protein leads to a cessation of growth without decreasing viability. Mutations within the MscL protein that can lead to a GOF phenotype also normally lead to a leakage of solutes, as assayed by steady-state potassium levels or increased efflux of potassium upon osmotic downshock (12Ou X.R. Blount P. Hoffman R.J. Kung C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 11471-11475Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 13Blount P. Schroeder M.J. Kung C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32150-32157Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). To test whether expression of YggB V40D similarly leads to a leakage of solutes, we assayed steady-state potassium levels in cells expressing YggB V40D and appropriate controls. As seen in Fig.3, cells that were induced for expression of YggB V40D had approximately two-thirds the steady-state intracellular potassium levels. No similar reduction was observed for uninduced controls, or cells expressing wild-type YggB. An additional test for increased cellular membrane permeability has recently been developed and utilized for assaying MS channel activity (22Levina N. Totemeyer S. Stokes N.R. Louis P. Jones M.A. Booth I.R. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1730-1737Crossref PubMed Scopus (540) Google Scholar, 31McLaggan D. Jones M.A. Gouesbet G. Levina N. Lindey S. Epstein W. Booth I.R. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 43: 521-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). This assay utilizes the observation that a significant drop in intracellular pH will cause the bacterium to lose viability. As seen in Fig. 4, if cells expressing wild-type YggB are placed in a low pH buffer (pH = 3.6), the viability is 20%. A significantly greater decrease in viability is observed upon osmotic downshock, apparently because of the opening of MS channels that will allow equilibration of protons across the membrane, thus decreasing cytosolic pH. In contrast, cells expressing YggB V40D have a profoundly decreased viability even without osmotic downshock. These data are consistent with increased membrane permeability independent of osmotic changes. Thus, both the steady-state potassium levels and the increased sensitivity to acidic environments strongly suggest that expression of YggB V40D leads to increased membrane permeability. Previous studies have demonstrated that ΔyggB,ΔmscLdouble-null strains are acutely sensitive to osmotic downshock. This osmotic downshock lysis phenotype is remediated by expression, intrans, of either yggB or mscL (21Moe P. Levin G. Blount P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 31121-31127Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar,22Levina N. Totemeyer S. Stokes N.R. Louis P. Jones M.A. Booth I.R. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1730-1737Crossref PubMed Scopus (540) Google Scholar). It was therefore of interest to determine whether YggB V40D remediated this phenotype. As in a previous study (21Moe P. Levin G. Blount P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 31121-31127Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), a severe osmotic shock, which kills a significant proportion of wild-type cells, was utilized. As shown in Fig. 5, cells expressing YggB V40D were as resistant to osmotic downshock as cells expressing wild-type YggB."

Here, we report a salivary protein of the malarial vector mosquito, Anopheles stephensi, that inhibits activation of the plasma contact system. This factor, named hamadarin, is a 16-kDa protein and a major component of the saliva of this mosquito. Assays using human plasma showed that hamadarin dose-dependently inhibits activation of the plasma contact system and subsequent release of bradykinin, a primary mediator of inflammatory reactions. Reconstitution experiments showed that hamadarin inhibits activation of the plasma contact system by inhibition of the reciprocal activation of factor XII and kallikrein. Direct binding assays demonstrated that this inhibitory effect is due to hamadarin binding to both factor XII and high molecular weight kininogen and interference in their association with the activating surface. The assays also showed that hamadarin binding to these proteins depends on Zn2+ ions, suggesting that hamadarin binds to these contact factors by recognizing their conformational change induced by Zn2+ binding. We propose that hamadarin may attenuate the host's acute inflammatory responses to the mosquito's bites by inhibition of bradykinin release and thus enable mosquitoes to take a blood meal efficiently and safely.

It is mainly composed of four plasma proteins, prekallikrein, factor XII, factor XI, and high molecular weight kininogen (HK).1 Activation of the plasma contact system is initiated by binding of both factor XII and a prekallikrein-HK complex to a biological activating surface such as the endothelial cell surface and then is rapidly amplified by reciprocal activation of kallikrein and factor XII on this surface. Factor XII and HK binding to these surfaces requires Zn2+ions (3Shimada T. Kato H. Iwanaga S. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1987; 102: 913-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 4Schousboe I.

Activation of the plasma contact system results in the release of a primary mediator of inflammatory reactions, bradykinin, from HK by the generated kallikrein (10Scott C.F. Silver L.D. Schapira M. Colman R.W. J. Clin. Invest. 1984; 73: 954-962Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Bradykinin induces vasodilatation, increases microvessel permeability, and enhances sensitivity to pain, resulting in inflammatory symptoms such as redness, edema, and pain around the injured site. At the same time, generated factor XIIa converts factor XI to XIa, initiating the intrinsic pathway of blood coagulation. However, the physiological significance of this pathway in initiation of blood coagulation in vivo appears questionable (11Saito H. Semin. Thromb. Hemost. 1987; 13: 36-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The contact system is initiated in vitro by “contact” with negatively charged surfaces such as kaolin, dextran sulfate, sulfatide, and acidic phospholipids. These negatively charged surfaces are thought to substitute for possible physiological receptors on the biological activating surface.

Blood-sucking arthropods produce a variety of bioactive substances in their salivary glands (19Law J.H. Ribeiro J.M.C. Wells M.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1992; 61: 87-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 20Ribeiro J.M.C. Infect. Agents Dis. 1995; 4: 143-152PubMed Google Scholar). When they feed on the blood, these substances are injected under the host's skin and counteract the host's defense responses that prevent their smooth blood feeding. These responses include blood coagulation, platelet aggregation, vasoconstriction, immune response among others, and a number of corresponding bioactive molecules have been identified in saliva of blood-sucking organisms. Protein D7 has been reported as the most abundant protein in salivary glands of the female yellow fever mosquito, Aedes aegypti (21James A.A. Blackmer K. Marinotti O. Ghosn C.R. Racioppi J.V. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1991; 44: 245-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). D7-related (D7r) proteins are homologous molecules in the salivary glands of a malaria vector mosquito, Anopheles gambiae (22Arcá B. Lombardo F. de Lara Capurro M. della Torre A. Dimopoulos G. James A.A. Coluzzi M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 1516-1521Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar), and proteins of this family are widely present in the saliva of mosquitoes, but their biological functions remain unknown. In this study, we report a potent inhibitor of the plasma contact system from the salivary glands of a malarial vector mosquito,Anopheles stephensi. This inhibitor is a major component of the salivary proteins of this mosquito and belongs to the D7 family. We demonstrate that this protein inhibits the reciprocal activation of factor XII and prekallikrein and subsequent generation of bradykinin in human plasma. We suggest that this activity is exerted through interference with binding of factor XII and HK to the activating surfaces. We also discuss the significance of contact system inhibition for the mosquito's blood-feeding behavior. Factor XI, factor XII, α-factor XIIa, prekallikrein, kallikrein, HK, and corn trypsin inhibitor (CTI) were purchased from Enzyme Research Laboratories (South Bend, IN). To determine protein concentrations, the following extinction coefficients ( E2800.1%) and molecular weights were used: factor XI, 1.31, 160,000; factor XII, 1.41, 80,000; α-factor XIIa, 1.41, 80,000; prekallikrein, 1.17, 86,000; kallikrein, 1.17, 86,000; HK, 0.701, 120,000. Dextran sulfate of molecular weight 500,000 (DS 500) and soybean trypsin inhibitor (SBTI) were purchased from Wako Pure Chemical Industries Ltd. Chromogenic substrates (S-2302, H-d-Pro-l-Phe-l-Arg-p-nitroanilide; S-2366, pyro-Glu-Pro-Arg-p-nitroanilide) were purchased from Chromogenix AB (Mölndal, Sweden). Phosphatidylcholine (PC) and phosphatidylinositol phosphate (PtdInsP) were purchased from Sigma Chemical Co. Small unilamellar phospholipid vesicle suspension (PC and PtdInsP in a 6:4 (w/w) ratio) was prepared by sonication as described previously (23Isawa H. Yuda M. Yoneda K. Chinzei Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6636-6641Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The salivary glands of A. stephensi were dissected from thoraces of unfed adult females, and poly(A)+ RNA was isolated from 300 pairs of glands using a MicroPrep mRNA isolation kit (AmershamBiosciences). A cDNA library was constructed from this mRNA using SuperScript plasmid system (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Bacterial colonies were randomly picked from the cDNA library, and plasmids were isolated from overnight culture using a Qiaprep spin Miniprep kit (Qiagen). cDNA clones were sequenced using an ABI PRISM BigDye Terminator cycle sequencing kit (PE Biosystems), and the reaction products were analyzed on an ABI 310 genetic analyzer (PE Biosystems). Initial sequence analysis was performed with GENETYX version 8.5 (Software Development Co., Ltd.). Sequence analyses for similarity searches were performed using a public BLAST program (www.blast.genome.ad.jp). Secretory signal peptide and its cleavage site were predicted using the SignalP program (www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/ SignalP). Recombinant protein was produced in a baculovirus-insect cell system. Full-length cDNA was subcloned into theBamHI site of the baculovirus transfer vector, pAcYM1 (24Matsuura Y. Possee R.D. Overton H.A. Bishop D.H. J. Gen. Virol. 1987; 68: 1233-1250Crossref PubMed Scopus (546) Google Scholar). The construction of recombinant virus and production of recombinant protein were performed as described previously (25Yuda M. Higuchi Sun J. Kureishi Y. Ito M. Chinzei Y. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 249: 337-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The produced recombinant protein was purified by cation-exchange high performance liquid chromatography and gel-filtration high performance liquid chromatography. Briefly, the culture supernatant containing secreted recombinant protein was applied to a PD-10 column (AmershamBiosciences) in 20 mm sodium acetate buffer, pH 5.2. The sample was then applied to a Resource S column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with the same buffer and eluted with a gradient from 0 to 1 m NaCl at a flow rate of 4 ml/min. The fractions containing the recombinant protein were pooled, concentrated by Centricon 10 (Amicon), and applied to a TSK G2000 SW column (Tosoh) equilibrated with Tris-buffered saline (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, 150 mm NaCl). The peak fractions were analyzed by 15.0% SDS-PAGE in a reducing condition. Protein concentration was determined with a Coomassie protein assay kit (Pierce) using bovine gamma globulin as a standard. For antibody preparation, recombinant hamadarin was produced as a maltose binding protein (MBP)-fusion protein. Briefly, cDNA fragments encoding hamadarin without signal peptide were amplified by PCR and subcloned into an expression plasmid, pMAL-c2q (New England BioLabs). MBP-fused hamadarin was produced by using this plasmid in Escherichia coli BL21 and was purified by amylose-resin affinity chromatography. Cleavage of the recombinant protein from MBP was achieved using Genenase (New England BioLabs), whose recognition sequence is located immediately upstream from the multiple cloning sites. For antibody production, rabbits were immunized with the MBP-removed hamadarin. Western blot analysis was performed essentially as described previously (26Yuda M. Sawai T. Chinzei Y. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 189: 1947-1952Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). For the assay of the hamadarin effect on activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) and prothrombin time (PT) (27Bajaj S.P. Joist J.H. Semin. Thromb. Hemost. 1999; 25: 407-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), 20 μl of citrated normal human plasma (Caliplasma Index 100, Biomerieux, France) and 10 μl of hamadarin were preincubated for 5 min. Then, the mixture was activated for 2 min at 37 °C with 35 μl of 10% diluted APTT reagent (Actin, Dade Behring, Germany) in the APTT assay or with 35 μl of diluted PT reagent (rabbit brain thromboplastin, Ortho Diagnostic System) in the PT assay. The clotting reaction was started by addition of 25 μl of 25 mm CaCl2, and clotting time was measured using a KC-10 coagulometer (Heinrich Amelung, Germany). The effect of hamadarin on the intrinsic Xase activity was examined by a reconstitution system as described previously (23Isawa H. Yuda M. Yoneda K. Chinzei Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6636-6641Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The effects of hamadarin on contact system activation in human plasma were assessed by generation of activated contact factors (factor XIa, factor XIIa, and kallikrein) (28Scott C.F. Colman R.W. J. Lab. Clin. Med. 1988; 111: 708-714PubMed Google Scholar, 29De La Cadena R.A. Scott C.F. Colman R.W. J. Lab. Clin. Med. 1987; 109: 601-607PubMed Google Scholar, 30Tankersley D.L. Alving B.M. Finlayson J.S. Blood. 1983; 62: 448-456Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, human plasma was treated with acid for inactivation of plasma serine protease inhibitors and then diluted with 1:30 in buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mmNaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 0.2% polyethylene glycol 8000). Fifty-microliter portions of the diluted plasma were incubated in a 96-microwell plate with 20 μl of various concentrations of hamadarin for 5 min and then activated with 10 μl of 10-fold-diluted APTT reagent. After 5 min, a mixture of chromogenic substrate (340 μm) and one or more serine protease inhibitors (20 nm) was added, and amidolytic activity of the generated enzyme (factor XIa, factor XIIa, and kallikrein) was determined at 405 nm using a microplate reader. Sets of added chromogenic substrate (340 μm) and serine protease inhibitors (20 nm) were as follows: S-2366, SBTI, and CTI for the factor XIa assay; S-2302 and SBTI for the factor XIIa assay; and S-2302 and CTI for the kallikrein assay. Assays for the effect of hamadarin on the amidolytic activities of purified contact factors (factor XIa, factor XIIa, and kallikrein) were performed essentially as described previously (31Yuda M. Sun J. Yamaguchi M. Ando K. Chinzei Y. Med. Entomol. Zool. 1996; 47: 263-272Crossref Google Scholar). All assays in the reconstitution system were carried out in a 96-microwell plate at room temperature. To assay for the effect of hamadarin on factor XII activation by kallikrein, factor XII (20 nm final concentration) was preincubated with hamadarin (0, 50, 100, 200, and 400 nm) in buffer (50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.4, 50 mm NaCl, 1% bovine serum albumin, 0.1% polyethylene glycol 8000) for 10 min. The activation reaction was initiated by addition of kallikrein (0.2 nm) and DS 500 (0.3 μg/ml). After 10-min incubation, SBTI (0.6 μm) and S-2302 (340 μm) were added, and the increase in absorbance at 405 nm was recorded at time intervals of 2 min. To assay for the effect of hamadarin on prekallikrein activation by factor XIIa, factor XIIa (50 pm, in final concentration) was preincubated with hamadarin (0, 50, 100, 200, and 400 nm) in the same buffer for 10 min. Activation of prekallikrein by factor XIIa was started by addition of prekallikrein (10 nm) and DS 500 (0.1 μg/ml). After 5-min incubation, CTI (100 nm) and S-2302 (170 μm) were added, and the increase in absorbance at 405 nm was recorded at time intervals of 2 min. To assay for the effect of hamadarin on the reciprocal activation of factor XII and prekallikrein, factor XII (0.2 nm final concentration) was preincubated with hamadarin (0, 50, 100, 200, and 400 nm) in the same buffer for 10 min at room temperature. The autoactivation of factor XII and following reciprocal activation were started by addition of prekallikrein (10 nm) and DS 500 (0.2 μg/ml). After 10-min incubation, S-2302 (170 μm) was added, and the increase in absorbance at 405 nm was recorded at time intervals of 2 min. The effect of hamadarin on HK cleavage by kallikrein was investigated in the reconstitution system as described by Tayeh et al. (32Tayeh M.A. Olson S.T. Shore J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16318-16325Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The effect of hamadarin on bradykinin generation was investigated in human plasma. Briefly, 75 μl of 30-fold-diluted, acid-treated plasma was preincubated with 30 μl of hamadarin at room temperature for 5 min. To begin the contact activation, 15 μl of one-tenth-diluted APTT reagent was added to the mixture and further incubated for 15 min. Generated bradykinin was assayed by competitive ELISA using a Markit-M kit (Dainippon Pharmaceutical Co., Osaka, Japan) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Surface plasmon resonance (SPR) studies were performed using a BIAcore X biosensor system (BIAcore AB, Sweden). Hamadarin was immobilized onto the surface of a sensor chip B1 in 10 mm sodium acetate, pH 4.5, using the amine-coupling kit supplied by the manufacturer. To subtract the nonspecific component from the apparent binding response, the blank flow cell was prepared by the same immobilizing procedure but without hamadarin. Binding analyses of hamadarin to contact factors were performed at 25 °C in running buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl containing 3 mmCaCl2, and 0.005% Tween 20) containing 50 or 100 μm ZnCl2. Forty microliters of varying concentrations of factor XII, factor XIIa, or HK was injected at a flow rate of 20 μl/min, and association was monitored. After return to buffer flow, dissociation was monitored during 2 min. The sensor chip surface was regenerated by a pulse injection of 25 mm EDTA after each experiment. To assay for Zn2+ dependence of hamadarin binding to factor XII and HK, running buffer was passed through a column of Chelex 100 (Bio-Rad) to remove metal contaminants before addition of ZnCl2. Each contact factor (250 nm) was dialyzed in a metal-chelated running buffer containing 0.1% Chelex 100 and was injected at different Zn2+ concentrations. Kinetic binding constants were obtained using BIAevaluation 3.0 software (BIAcore). Factor XII or HK binding to a negatively charged surface was also monitored using a BIAcore X biosensor system. The hydrophobic surface of an HPA sensor chip was coated with the phospholipid monolayer (PC:PtdInsP = 6:4) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Factor XII (20 nm) or HK (20 nm) was preincubated with various concentrations of hamadarin for 5 min in Tris-buffered saline (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl) containing 200 or 25 μmZnCl2, respectively. The mixture was loaded onto the sensor chip surface, and association was monitored. The phospholipid surface was regenerated by injection of 10 μl of NaOH (100 mm) after each experiment. Clones randomly picked from a cDNA library from A. stephensisalivary glands were sequenced, and 1280 cDNA sequences were obtained. Among them, 250 clones (19.5%) showed significant similarity to salivary proteins previously found in other mosquitoes (33James A.A. Rossignol R.A. Parasitol. Today. 1991; 7: 267-271Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Among these clones, the most abundant cDNA species (total of 38 clones isolated) had a 498-bp open reading frame encoding a 166-residue polypeptide. It showed high similarity to D7 protein and D7-related (D7r) proteins and had the highest homology to A. gambiaeD7r1 (59.0% identity and 91.0% homology) (22Arcá B. Lombardo F. de Lara Capurro M. della Torre A. Dimopoulos G. James A.A. Coluzzi M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 1516-1521Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Hydrophobicity analysis predicts a 21-amino acid signal peptide typical for secreted proteins. The predicted mature polypeptide has a calculated molecular mass of 16.4 kDa. To investigate the bioactivity of this molecule, recombinant protein was produced in a baculovirus-insect cell system. The recombinant protein was secreted as a soluble protein and formed a major part of the proteins in the cell culture medium. It was purified using high performance liquid chromatography and examined by SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis (Fig. 1). The purified recombinant protein showed an apparent molecular mass of around 16 kDa, which corresponds well to the predicted molecular mass of the mature protein. Antibodies raised against this recombinant protein specifically reacted with a salivary protein of the same size, which is one of the most abundant proteins in the female salivary glands. We named this salivary protein “hamadarin” after the Japanese name of anopheline mosquitoes, Hamadara-ka. In the salivary glands of female mosquitoes, the presence of anticoagulant proteins has been reported (34Valenzuela J.G. Francischetti I.M.B. Ribeiro J.M.C. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 11209-11215Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 35Francischetti I.M.B. Valenzuela J.G. Ribeiro J.M.C. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 16678-16685Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 36Stark K.R. James A.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20802-20809Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Therefore, as an initial step, we examined APTT and PT prolongation activities of hamadarin. As shown in Fig. 2, recombinant hamadarin prolonged APTT in a concentration-dependant manner but showed no prolongation activity on PT. Next, we investigated the inhibitory activity of hamadarin to the intrinsic Xase using a reconstitution system. It is known that the intrinsic Xase is involved in both intrinsic and extrinsic pathways in vivo, but its inhibitor prolongs only APTT (23Isawa H. Yuda M. Yoneda K. Chinzei Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6636-6641Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 37Sun J. Yamaguchi M. Yuda M. Miura K. Takeya H. Hirai M. Matsuoka H. Ando K. Watanabe T. Suzuki K. Chinzei Y. Thromb. Haemost. 1996; 75: 573-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). We found that, even when added in excess, hamadarin did not inhibit the intrinsic Xase (data not shown). We also performed an SPR study and confirmed that hamadarin does not interact with factor IXa, the protease of the intrinsic Xase, in physiological conditions (data not shown). These results indicate that hamadarin is a specific inhibitor of the intrinsic coagulation pathway. Next, we examined the anti-coagulation activity of hamadarin using human plasma preactivated with APTT reagent in the absence of Ca2+ ions. In this condition, factor XIa is generated in plasma but cannot activate factor IX before addition of Ca2+ ions. With this plasma, hamadarin showed no APTT prolongation activity (data not shown), indicating that hamadarin acts on factor XIa generation or on the earliest phase of the intrinsic coagulation, the activation of the plasma contact system. We examined the effect of hamadarin on the amidolytic activity of purified activated contact factors (factor XIIa, kallikrein, and factor XIa) using synthetic substrates. Hamadarin showed no inhibition of the amidolytic activity of these contact factors (data not shown). Therefore, we investigated the effect of hamadarin on the activation of these contact factors. In this experiment, human plasma was preincubated with hamadarin and then activated by APTT reagent, and activated contact factors were assessed using the respective synthetic substrates. As shown Fig. 3, hamadarin dose-dependently inhibited generation of factor XIIa, kallikrein, and factor XIa. These results indicate that hamadarin inhibits activation of the contact system without affecting the amidolytic activity of contact factors. Once the plasma contact system is activated, a potent pro-inflammatory and pain-producing nonapeptide, bradykinin, is released from HK by cleavage of kallikrein. We therefore examined whether hamadarin would attenuate the generation of bradykinin. Human plasma was preincubated with hamadarin, the contact system was initiated by APTT reagent, and generated bradykinin was quantified by competitive ELISA. As shown in Fig. 4, hamadarin reduced bradykinin generation in a dose-dependent manner. We examined the effect of hamadarin on the contact system in the different reconstitution systems. In the first experiment, factor XII was preincubated with hamadarin, and reciprocal activation was started by addition of prekallikrein and DS 500, a negatively charged surface (38Samuel M. Pixley R.A. Villanueva M.A. Colman R.W. Villanueva G.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 19691-19697Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 39Citarella F. Wuillemin W.A. Lubbers Y.T.P. Hack C.E. Br. J. Haematol. 1997; 99: 197-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). In this condition, binding of factor XII to negatively charged surfaces initiates its autoactivation, and the generated factor XIIa activates prekallikrein to kallikrein, followed by the reciprocal activation of factor XII and prekallikrein. As shown in Fig. 5 A, hamadarin dose-dependently inhibited activation of these factors. Next, we examined the effect of hamadarin on kallikrein-catalyzed activation of factor XII and factor XIIa-catalyzed activation of prekallikrein. Also in these experiments, DS 500 was used as a negatively charged surface (38Samuel M. Pixley R.A. Villanueva M.A. Colman R.W. Villanueva G.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 19691-19697Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 39Citarella F. Wuillemin W.A. Lubbers Y.T.P. Hack C.E. Br. J. Haematol. 1997; 99: 197-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 5 (Band C), hamadarin inhibited both reactions in a dose-dependent manner. These results suggest that hamadarin inhibits the contact system activation by inhibition of the reciprocal activation of factor XII and kallikrein. On the other hand, we examined the inhibitory effect of hamadarin on the proteolytic cleavage of HK by kallikrein both in the absence and presence of DS 500 and found that hamadarin did not show significant inhibitory effect on cleavage by kallikrein, even when an excess of hamadarin was added (data not shown). To identify the target molecule(s) of hamadarin, we investigated interactions between hamadarin and contact factors using a SPR sensor. As shown in Fig.6, injections of factor XII/XIIa onto the immobilized hamadarin gave significant responses in a dose-dependant manner, indicating that hamadarin binds both the zymogen and enzyme forms of factor XII. Other plasma serine proteases investigated (prekallikrein, kallikrein, and factor XIa) showed no interactions with hamadarin in the same conditions. On the other hand, we observed clear interactions between HK and hamadarin (Figs. 6 and7 C).Figure 7Sensorgrams for the binding of factor XII (A), factor XIIa (B), and HK (C) to immobilized hamadarin measured by SPR. Hamadarin was coupled onto a sensor chip at levels of 1600, 1609, and 1959 resonance units (RUs) in binding assays for factor XII (A), factor XIIa (B), and HK (C), respectively. Different concentrations of factor XII, factor XIIa, and HK were injected at a flow rate of 20 μl/min in buffer containing 50 μm ZnCl2. The sensor chip surface was regenerated by 25 mm EDTA after each injection.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) In the kinetic analyses, interactions of both factor XII/XIIa and HK with immobilized hamadarin gave relatively poor fits with a simple 1:1 Langmuir binding model. The best fits were obtained with a two-state binding model. The two-state model is represented as follows, A+Bka1⇔kd1ABka2⇔kd2(AB) REACTION1In this model, hamadarin (A) rapidly associates with the contact factors (B) and forms an initial protein-protein complex (AB). This complex slowly undergoes a conformational change and becomes a tightly bound, slow dissociating final complex (AB)*. The termsk a1 and k d1 represent association and dissociation rate constants for the reaction from A + B to AB, respectively. k a2 andk d2 represent forward and backward rate constants for the transition from AB to (AB)*, respectively. Under a standard condition (pH = 7.4, [Ca2+] = 3 mm, and [Zn2+] = 100 μm),k a1, k d1,k a2, and k d2 for factor XII binding to immobilized hamadarin were 3.65 ± 0.04 × 104m−1s−1, 2.65 ± 0.12 × 10−2 s−1, 3.00 ± 0.13 × 10−2 s−1, and 2.83 ± 0.12 × 10−3 s−1, respectively. On the other hand, the corresponding values for factor XIIa were 1.26 ± 0.02 × 105m−1s−1, 4.82 ± 0.16 × 10−2 s−1, 2.57 ± 0.06 × 10−2 s−1, and 3.33 ± 0.16 × 10−3 s−1, respectively. Likewise,k a1, k d1,k a2, and k d2 for HK binding to hamadarin were 6.90 ± 0.17 × 104m−1s−1, 2.22 ± 0.23 × 10−2 s−1, 3.80 ± 0.25 × 10−2 s−1, and 4.72 ± 0.07 × 10−3 s−1, respectively. Zn2+ ions are necessary for binding of both factor XII and HK to the activating surfaces (3Shimada T. Kato H. Iwanaga S. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1987; 102: 913-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 4Schousboe I. Halkier T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 197: 309-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 5Lin Y. Pixley R.A.

It has been reported that conformational change is induced within factor XII and HK by Zn2+ binding (7Bernardo M.M. Day D.E. Olson S.T. Shore J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12468-12476Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Bernardo M.M. Day D.E. Halvorson H.R. Olson S.T. Shore J.D. J. Biol.

Biochem. 2001; 268: 396-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Therefore, we performed SPR analysis of factor XII and HK binding to hamadarin in different Zn2+ concentrations. As shown in Fig.8 A, binding of hamadarin to factor XII was not observed in the absence of Zn2+ ions and gradually increased with Zn2+ concentration. In the assay for HK, only a weak binding response was observed in the absence of Zn2+ ions. The binding responses increased to maximal at 25 μm and gradually decreased in higher Zn2+concentrations (Fig. 8 B). These results suggest that hamadarin binds to factor XII/XIIa and HK by recognizing their conformational change induced by Zn2+. Binding of contact factors to a negatively charged surface initiates and accelerates activation of the contact system. Therefore, we investigated the inhibitory effect of hamadarin on adhesion of factor XII and HK to an acidic (negatively charged) phospholipid monolayer using a SPR sensor (4Schousboe I. Halkier T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 197: 309-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 40Schousboe I. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 193: 495-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The sensor chip surface was coated with a phospholipid monolayer mainly composed of PtdInsP. Factor XII or HK preincubated with various concentrations of hamadarin was injected onto the sensor tip surface, and association was monitored. As shown in Fig.9 A, the binding responses of factor XII decreased with increasing hamadarin content, showing that hamadarin dose-dependently inhibits factor XII binding to the acidic phospholipid surface. A similar result was also obtained when HK was used (Fig. 9 B). In this study, we showed that hamadarin inhibits activation of the contact system and subsequent release of bradykinin in plasma. The reconstitution experiments demonstrated that hamadarin inhibits kallikrein-catalyzed factor XII activation and factor XIIa-catalyzed prekallikrein activation, indicating that hamadarin inhibits the contact system by inhibition of the reciprocal activation of factor XII and prekallikrein. SPR analysis demonstrated that hamadarin binds to both factor XII and HK and inhibits their binding to negatively charged surfaces. HK forms a complex with prekallikrein in vivo and mediates prekallikrein association with the cell surface. Therefore, hamadarin binding to factor XII and HK may prevent factor XII and prekallikrein from association with the activating surface, which leads to the inhibition of their reciprocal activation that is promoted on the surface. Furthermore, binding of the prekallikrein-HK complex to the biological activating surface has been reported to activate prekallikrein to kallikrein, which triggers contact system activationin vivo (16Røjkjær R.

Blood. 1998; 91: 516-528Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, it is possible that hamadarin inhibits initiation of contact system activation as well as the subsequent reciprocal activation. On the other hand, hamadarin did not show clear inhibitory activity to the proteolytic cleavage of HK by kallikrein. Probably, this result is explained by the fact that the acceleration effect of negatively charged surfaces is not so high in HK cleavage by kallikrein as in the reciprocal activation (32Tayeh M.A. Olson S.T. Shore J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16318-16325Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, the inhibitory effect of hamadarin on bradykinin release would be mainly due to inhibition of contact system activation. Our SPR analysis showed that hamadarin binding to factor XII and HK requires Zn2+ ions. It is known that Zn2+ ions are necessary for binding of factor XII and HK to the activating surface (3Shimada T. Kato H. Iwanaga S. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1987; 102: 913-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 4Schousboe I. Halkier T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 197: 309-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 5Lin Y. Pixley R.A.

Biochem. 1997; 243: 160-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), and it has been reported that Zn2+ binding to these contact factors induces conformational changes in them (7Bernardo M.M. Day D.E. Olson S.T. Shore J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12468-12476Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Bernardo M.M. Day D.E. Halvorson H.R. Olson S.T. Shore J.D. J. Biol.

Biochem. 2001; 268: 396-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is possible that hamadarin may bind to the receptor-binding domains of these factors by recognizing their conformational change induced by Zn2+ ions. In fact, our recent SPR study demonstrated that hamadarin interacts with domain 5, the receptor-binding domain of HK (42DeLa Cadena R.A. Colman R.W. Protein Sci. 1992; 1: 151-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 43Kunapuli S.P. DeLa Cadena R.A. Colman R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2486-2492Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), in a Zn2+ion-dependent manner. 2H. Isawa, M. Yuda, Y. Orito, and Y. Chinzei, unpublished data. The presence of common receptors for factor XII and HK is suggested by the fact that factor XII and HK compete for the same anionic surface and putative cell-surface receptors in the presence of Zn2+ ions (13Joseph K. Ghebrehiwet B. Peerschke E.I.B. Reid K.B.M. Kaplan A.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8552-8557Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar,14Herwald H. Dedio J. Kellner R. Loos M.

Chem. 1993; 268: 11982-11987Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, hamadarin might adhere to both contact factors by mimicking such common receptors and interfere with their binding to the activating surfaces. Hamadarin is a major component of the saliva of A. stephensi, suggesting that it may play an important role in the blood-sucking behavior of this mosquito. One possible role of hamadarin is as an inhibitor of the blood coagulation. In fact, contact system activation leads to initiation of the intrinsic pathway of blood coagulation in vitro. However, the contact system is considered to have little influence on physiological hemostasis, because deficiencies of contact factors are not associated with clinical bleeding despite marked prolongation of APTT (11Saito H. Semin. Thromb. Hemost. 1987; 13: 36-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Recent investigations suggest that contact factors have anti-coagulation and profibrinolytic functions in a physiological milieu (45Colman R.W. Thromb. Haemost. 1999; 82: 1568-1577Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 46Schmaier A.H. Thromb. Haemost. 1997; 78: 101-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). The main blood coagulation pathway following vascular injury may be the extrinsic pathway, which is initiated by formation of tissue factor-factor VIIa complex at the injured site. Because this mosquito has an anti-thrombin protein in the saliva (41Waidhet-Kouadio P. Yuda M. Ando K. Chinzei Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1381: 227-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), this inhibitor may function as a main anti-coagulant of the saliva. On the other hand, we showed that hamadarin inhibited release of bradykinin. Bradykinin induces vascular hypotension and blood retardation by opening the blood vessels. Bradykinin also releases the plasma into the tissue by increasing vascular permeability, which leads to blood condensation and retardation. These effects would not only reduce the blood flow into the feeding site but also enhance host hemostatic responses such as blood coagulation and platelet aggregation that have been initiated by vascular injuries. Therefore, inflammation induced by bradykinin at the injured site will prove a serious threat for blood-feeding animals. We suppose hamadarin mainly functions as an anti-inflammatory molecule for this mosquito. In conclusion, we demonstrated that hamadarin has an inhibitory effect on contact system activation and subsequent bradykinin generation. Hamadarin exerts this activity by binding to both factor XII and HK in the presence of Zn2+ ions and inhibits their association with putative receptors. This unique property will provide a powerful tool for studying molecular mechanisms of contact system activationin vivo. Furthermore, hamadarin might provide clues for developing new anti-inflammatory and analgesic drugs. Finally, our study provides new insights into the blood-feeding strategy used by the anopheline mosquito and elucidates for the first time a function of a D7 family protein."

Subsequent studies have demonstrated that transcription by RNA polymerase I is subject to regulation at many levels (4Hannan K.M. Hannan R.D. Rothblum L.I. Front.

At least three, and possibly more, polymerase-associated proteins, TIF-IA, Factor C*, and TFIC (6Cavanaugh A.H. Gokal P.K. Lawther R.P. Thompson E.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

TIF-IA and Factor C* were identified as factors that were required for the complementation of extracts of quiescent or cycloheximide-treated cells. TFIC was identified as that activity required to reconstitute transcription by extracts of glucocorticoid-treated P1798 cells. This lymphosarcoma cell line exits the cell cycle in response to the synthetic glucocorticoid dexamethasone (DEX) (6Cavanaugh A.H. Gokal P.K. Lawther R.P. Thompson E.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 718-721Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Interestingly, TIF-IA, Factor C*, and TFIC shared several properties, including a tight association with the core polymerase (8Tower J. Sollner-Webb B. Cell. 1987; 50: 873-883Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 9Mahajan P.B. Thompson E.A. J. Biol.

TIF-IA and TFIC were purified and consisted of different polypeptides (10Schnapp A. Pfleiderer C. Rosenbauer H. Grummt I. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 2857-2863Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 11Schnapp A. Schnapp G. Erny B. Grummt I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 6723-6732Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). However, the lack of immunological and molecular tools precluded a definitive statement that TIF-IA and TFIC were the same or different proteins (reviewed in Refs. 4Hannan K.M. Hannan R.D. Rothblum L.I. Front. Biosci. 1998; 3: d376-d398Crossref PubMed Google Scholar and 5Grummt I. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 1999; 62: 109-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar).The formation of the stable preinitiation complex in yeast requires an interaction between the upstream activating factor bound to the upstream promoter element and core factor, bound to the core promoter element. This complex then recruits transcriptionally competent RNA polymerase I to the transcription initiation site (Ref. 12Aprikian P. Moorefield B. Reeder R.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 4847-4855Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar and references therein). Mechanistically, Rrn3 appears to “bridge” the polymerase and transcription initiation complexes (13Thuriaux P. Mariotte S. Buhler J.M. Sentenac A., Vu, L. Lee B.S. Nomura M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24252-24257Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 14Yamamoto R. Nogi Y. Dodd J. Nomura M.

EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5473-5482Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Thus, only pol I molecules in complex with Rrn3 are able to recognize the preinitiation complex and initiate transcription.Studies comparing the state of RNA polymerase I in growing and stationary yeast cells demonstrated that ∼2% of the pol I in whole cell extracts was capable of initiating transcription in vitro (16Milkereit P. Tschochner H. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3692-3703Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). This correlated with the observation that the association of Rrn3 with pol I corresponded to the growth state of the cells and was confirmed by the observation that transcriptionally active pol I was associated with Rrn3 (16Milkereit P. Tschochner H. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3692-3703Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 17Keener J. Josaitis C. Dodd J. Nomura M. J. Biol.

EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3692-3703Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) demonstrated that the association of Rrn3 with pol I was independent of either the total pol I or total Rrn3 content but varied with the growth rate of the cells. This could reflect alterations in the state of Rrn3 and/or pol I that would shift the equilibrium between free Rrn3 and Rrn3 associated with pol I. Fathet al. (18Fath S. Milkereit P. Peyroche G. Riva M. Carles C. Tschochner H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 14334-14339Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) have recently reported that this equilibrium is modulated by growth-related phosphorylation of specific sites of yeast RNA polymerase I.Moorefield et al. (19Moorefield B. Greene E.A. Reeder R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 4724-4729Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) demonstrated that hRrn3 could complement yeast Rrn3 mutants, and there is strong evidence that mammalian Rrn3 is the equivalent of TIF-IA (20Bodem J. Dobreva G. Hoffmann-Rohrer U. Iben S. Zentgraf H. Delius H. Vingron M. Grummt I. EMBO Rep. 2000; 1: 171-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Recombinant mammalian Rrn3 has been shown to complement extracts from cycloheximide-treated cells (20Bodem J. Dobreva G. Hoffmann-Rohrer U. Iben S. Zentgraf H. Delius H. Vingron M. Grummt I. EMBO Rep. 2000; 1: 171-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), suggesting that Rrn3 was the rapidly turning over activity originally identified by Feigelson's laboratory (3Lampert A. Feigelson P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1974; 58: 1030-1038Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). In addition, mammalian Rrn3 has been shown to interact with SL1 and would then serve as the bridge between RNA polymerase I and the preinitiation complex on the rDNA promoter (21Miller G. Panov K.I. Friedrich J.K. Trinkle-Mulcahy L. Lamond A.I. Zomerdijk J.C. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1373-1382Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). However, the mechanism by which Rrn3 activity is inhibited by CHX has not been identified. Moreover, earlier studies on TIF-IA suggested that it did not dissociate from RNA polymerase I (10Schnapp A. Pfleiderer C. Rosenbauer H. Grummt I. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 2857-2863Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Thus, the role of Rrn3 in mammalian rDNA transcription and its mode of regulation needed to be examined.We report here that the mammalian homologue of Rrn3 plays a crucial role in rDNA transcription. We have found that Rrn3 can complement extracts of cells treated with CHX but not extracts of DEX-treated P1798 cells, demonstrating that TIF-IA/Rrn3 and TFIC are not the same activities. We have confirmed that hRrn3 can interact with both the core subunits of RNA polymerase I and SL1. Although the Rrn3-SL1 interaction is not affected by CHX, the interaction between Rrn3 and pol I is inhibited. Moreover, we demonstrate that the Rrn3·pol I interaction is, at least in part, mediated by the mouse homologue of rpa43 as it is in Saccharomyces cerevisiae (15Peyroche G. Milkereit P. Bischler N. Tschochner H. Schultz P. Sentenac A. Carles C. Riva M. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5473-5482Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). However, the Rrn3·pol I interaction is regulated differently in mammals than in yeast. Treatment with cycloheximide inhibits Rrn3 phosphorylation and is associated with the dissociation of Rrn3 from its complex with RNA polymerase I and the inhibition of the formation of an Rrn3·rpa43 complex in vivo. The interaction between Rrn3 and rpa43 was confirmed using purified recombinant proteins in vitro. Using this in vitro model, we found that dephosphorylation of Rrn3 weakened the interaction between Rrn3 and rpa43. The importance of the role of Rrn3 phosphorylation was confirmed by the observation that dephosphorylated Rrn3 could not reconstitute transcription when added to extracts from cycloheximide-treated cells.DISCUSSIONWe have established that phosphorylation of mammalian Rrn3 regulates its role in rDNA transcription. We have confirmed that the ability of TIF-IA/Rrn3 to function in transcription is inhibited when mammalian cells are treated with CHX. In addition, we demonstrated that Rrn3/TIF-IA is insufficient to reconstitute rDNA transcription when added to extracts from dexamethasone-treated P1798 cells. Therefore, we conclude that Rrn3/TIF-IA and TFIC are not the same factors. We provide several lines of evidence that the phosphorylation status of mammalian Rrn3 is critical for its function. We have shown that treatment of cells with CHX leads to a rapid decrease in the phosphorylation status of Rrn3 and to the dissociation of Rrn3 from core RNA polymerase I. In contrast, CHX did not significantly inhibit the ability of Rrn3 to interact with TAFI68. Our investigation of the interaction of Rrn3 with pol I demonstrated that mammalian Rrn3 interacts with mammalian rpa43 and that this interaction is inhibited when cells are treated with CHX. Moreover, we demonstrated that the interaction of Rrn3 with rpa43 in vitro is inhibited when Rrn3 is dephosphorylated and that treatment with phosphatase inhibits the ability of Rrn3 to reconstitute transcription by extracts of CHX-treated cells. Furthermore, our observation (data not shown) that the distribution of Rrn3 becomes dispersed upon cycloheximide treatment is reminiscent of the morphological alternations of the nucleolus observed after treatment with the kinase inhibitor (5,6-dichloro-β-d-ribofuranosyl-benzimidazole) DRB (30Chen D. Huang S. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 169-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar, 31Haaf T. Ward DC. Exp. Cell Res. 1996; 224: 163-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 32Panse S.L. Masson C. Heliot L. Chassery J.M. Hernandez-Verdun D. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 2145-2154PubMed Google Scholar). This finding is consistent with our model that inhibition of phosphorylation of Rrn3 inhibits its interaction with pol I via rpa43.The model presented in Fig. 7 summarizes the findings of the present report and incorporates several other findings. First, the model demonstrates a requirement for Rrn3 phosphorylation to interact with RNA polymerase I and to allow pol I to productively recognize the preinitiation complex formed by SL1 and UBF on the rDNA promoter. This does not preclude the possibility that RNA polymerase I might interact with the preinitiation complex in the absence of Rrn3. It is formally possible that TFIC serves a parallel function to that served by Rrn3 and might be capable of facilitating an “incomplete” complex between RNA polymerase I and the preinitiation complex formed by SL1 and UBF. Second, the model incorporates observations made by Brun et al. (58Brun R.P. Ryan K. Sollner-Webb B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5010-5021Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) as well as some made by Aprikian et al. (12Aprikian P. Moorefield B. Reeder R.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 4847-4855Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). These authors have demonstrated that Factor C* or the Rrn3·pol I complex dissociates during transcription, and Rrn3 loses its capacity to participate in subsequent rounds of initiation. Third, the model suggests that dephosphorylated Rrn3 would remain complexed with SL1. Although this would be consistent with our fluorescence recovery after photobleaching data, because it would reduce the rate of Rrn3 diffusion, it would appear to contradict the model proposed by Aprikian et al. (12Aprikian P. Moorefield B. Reeder R.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 4847-4855Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar).The evidence accumulated to date indicates that the activity of nearly every component of the mammalian rDNA transcriptional apparatus is subject to regulation and that in most cases there are multiple mechanisms for regulating their activity. UBF activity can be regulated by phosphorylation (33O'Mahony D.J. Smith S.D. Xie W. Rothblum L.I. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 1301-1308Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 34O'Mahony D.J.

Biol. 1995; 15: 3327-3335Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Similarly, studies on the regulation of rDNA transcription in mammalian cells undergoing serum starvation or P1798 cells exposed to DEX demonstrated that a polymerase-associated factor was responsible for the inhibition of rDNA transcription. Interestingly, two laboratories were able to separate what appeared to be the same activity from RNA polymerase I (9Mahajan P.B. Thompson E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 16225-16233Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Schnapp A. Pfleiderer C. Rosenbauer H. Grummt I. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 2857-2863Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Our results demonstrate that the heat-treated extracts used by Thompson's laboratory (9Mahajan P.B. Thompson E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 16225-16233Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) contain both Rrn3/TIF-IA and TFIC and that Rrn3/TIF-IA and TFIC are not the same factors.The model for rDNA transcription in S. cerevisiae proposes that the binding of the multisubunit complex (upstream activation factor) to the upstream promoter element is required to recruit the core factor to the promoter (12Aprikian P. Moorefield B. Reeder R.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 4847-4855Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 17Keener J. Josaitis C. Dodd J. Nomura M. J. Biol.

Biol. 2001; 21: 2292-2297Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). In turn, the core factor recruits the transcriptionally competent form of pol I to the transcription initiation site. In this model for transcription initiation, Rrn3 functions as the bridge between pol I and the core factor. In yeast, Rrn3 is associated with a small fraction of the RNA polymerase I in the cell, and it is that fraction that is competent for specific initiation of rDNA transcription. This is similar to the report of Tower and Sollner-Webb (8Tower J. Sollner-Webb B. Cell. 1987; 50: 873-883Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) who demonstrated the existence of two biochemically definable forms of pol I in mammalian cells; one that was capable of initiating transcription and one that could not. In stationary yeast cells, in which rDNA transcription has been down-regulated, there is a decrease in the association of Rrn3 and pol I, although there is no decrease in the amount of free Rrn3 or pol I (16Milkereit P. Tschochner H. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3692-3703Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Indeed, Milkereit and Tschochner (16Milkereit P. Tschochner H. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3692-3703Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) demonstrated that the addition of purified pol I·Rrn3 complex from growing cells to an inactive fraction (PA600s) from stationary cells restored transcription. Interestingly, neither initiation-inactive pol I nor recombinant Rrn3 could complement extracts from stationary cells.Fath et al. (18Fath S. Milkereit P. Peyroche G. Riva M. Carles C. Tschochner H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 14334-14339Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) examined the model that different post-translational modifications have to exist in either Rrn3 and/or RNA polymerase I to regulate the formation of transcriptionally competent RNA polymerase I. They demonstrated that phosphorylation is required to maintain a stable and transcriptionally active pol I·Rrn3 complex. They reported that, although yeast Rrn3 is a phosphoprotein, nonphosphorylated Rrn3 and Rrn3 produced in bacteria were able to participate in the formation of the transcriptionally competent RNA polymerase I·Rrn3 complex. Moreover, they demonstrated that treatment of yeast RNA polymerase I with alkaline phosphatase abrogated its ability to interact with Rrn3 and inhibited the formation of transcriptionally competent pol I. These observations led to the model that phosphorylation/dephosphorylation at specific pol I sites mediates the interaction with Rrn3 and the ability of pol I to initiate rDNA transcription. Although structural and genetic studies indicate that yeast Rrn3 interacts with the 43-kDa subunit of pol I (rpa43), it is not yet known if the phosphorylation status of rpa43 regulates the interaction of Rrn3 with rpa43.In contrast, our results led to the conclusion that phosphorylation of Rrn3 is required for the formation of the Rrn3·pol I complex that is capable of transcription initiation. Although this model for regulating rDNA transcription would be different from that proposed by Fathet al. (18Fath S. Milkereit P. Peyroche G. Riva M. Carles C. Tschochner H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 14334-14339Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), it is consistent with the general model that the formation of the Rrn3·pol I complex is essential for rDNA transcription. Moreover, most of the studies on the regulation of polymerase-associated factors required for rDNA transcription in mammalian cells are consistent with a model wherein Rrn3, and not pol I, would be the target of post-translational modification, as in the experiments presented herein and those of Bodem et al.(20Bodem J. Dobreva G. Hoffmann-Rohrer U. Iben S. Zentgraf H. Delius H. Vingron M. Grummt I. EMBO Rep. 2000; 1: 171-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). We have demonstrated that the addition of recombinant Rrn3 from Sf9 cells to extracts of CHX-treated cells is sufficient to reconstitute transcription. If the post-translational modification of pol I was responsible for the inactivation of transcription in that system, then the addition of Rrn3 would not be sufficient to reconstitute transcription.Our observation, that serum starvation significantly reduces the phosphorylation state of RNA polymerase I in cultured rat hepatoma cells (22Hannan R.D. Hempel W.M. Cavanaugh A. Arino T. Dimitrov S.I. Moss T. Rothblum L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1257-1267Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), is consistent with the formal possibility that the post-translational modification of pol I might also contribute to the interaction of mammalian Rrn3 with pol I. However, only the A194 subunit of mammalian pol I has been definitively demonstrated to be phosphorylated (Ref. 22Hannan R.D. Hempel W.M. Cavanaugh A. Arino T. Dimitrov S.I. Moss T. Rothblum L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1257-1267Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar and discussion therein), and the results from studies on yeast and mammalian RNA polymerase I indicate that Rrn3 interacts with rpa43 and not A194. It is possible that additional subunits contribute to the stability of the Rrn3·pol I complex, and it is interesting to note that several of the yeast RNA polymerase I subunits are phosphorylated, including A190, A34.5, A23, A19, and A43 (55Breant B. Buhler J.-M. Sentenac A. Fromageot P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1983; 130: 247-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 56Bell G.I. Valenzuela P. Rutter W.J. J. Biol.

However, in the absence of evidence to suggest that Rrn3 interacts with additional subunits, our studies have focused on the interaction between Rrn3 and rpa43. The results obtained in those experiments are consistent with the model that the phosphorylation state of Rrn3 determines the formation of the Rrn3·pol I complex in mammalian cells. The determination of the modified residues in Rrn3 and the correlation of the state of modification with the ability of Rrn3 to interact with pol I will provide an important tool to understanding the mechanism of rDNA transcription.

At least three, and possibly more, polymerase-associated proteins, TIF-IA, Factor C*, and TFIC (6Cavanaugh A.H. Gokal P.K. Lawther R.P. Thompson E.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

TIF-IA and Factor C* were identified as factors that were required for the complementation of extracts of quiescent or cycloheximide-treated cells. TFIC was identified as that activity required to reconstitute transcription by extracts of glucocorticoid-treated P1798 cells.

The resulting mucus secretion can be copious, transiently increasing the depth of mucus on the airway surface to almost 80 μm (15Wu D.X. Lee C.Y. Uyekubo S.N. Choi H.K. Bastacky S.J. Widdicombe J.H. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: L388-L395PubMed Google Scholar). Mucus binds pathogens and inhibits their growth, and if all goes well, mucociliary transport carries the mucus and the trapped pathogens out of the airways. All does not go well in diseases such as asthma, chronic bronchitis, the ciliary dyskinesias, and cystic fibrosis (CF).1 For different reasons in each disease, mucociliary clearance is inefficient or lost, and the airways become susceptible to mucus plugging and infection (16Wanner A. Clin. Chest Med. 1986; 7: 247-258PubMed Google Scholar). In the ciliary dyskinesias, the mucus is normal, but ciliary beating is ineffective. Individuals so affected have a chronic, productive cough that helps clear secretions but are still susceptible to chronic bacterial infections that can in some cases destroy the lung (17Pedersen M. Stafanger G. Eur. J. Respir Dis. Suppl. 1983; 127: 118-128PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, mucus stasis alone can permit chronic infection of the airways. In cystic fibrosis, the cilia are normal, but mucus clearance is abnormal (18Knowles M.R. Boucher R.C. J. Clin. Invest. 2002; 109: 571-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (971) Google Scholar). Mucus plugging is characteristic of CF organs as diverse as sinuses, intestines, and gallbladder. In CF airways, normally benign bacteria and molds can be found in high densities within static mucous plugs but not attached to the surface of the conducting airway epithelia (19Worlitzsch D. Tarran R. Ulrich M. Schwab U. Cekici A. Meyer K.C. Birrer P. Bellon G. Berger J. Weiss T. Botzenhart K. Yankaskas J.R. Randell S. Boucher R.C. Doring G. J. Clin. Invest. 2002; 109: 317-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (986) Google Scholar) nor usually in the alveoli nor systemically. These features indicate a defect in primary mucosal defenses of the conducting airways. Although long controversial, abnormally viscous primary mucus has now been shown to emanate from single submucosal glands in the bronchi of CF subjects but not in disease controls (20Jayaraman S. Joo N.S. Reitz B. Wine J.J. Verkman A.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 8119-8123Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Although it is certain that CF disease is caused by the loss of functional CFTR, an ion channel that conducts Cl− and HCO3−, the mechanism by which lost CFTR function increases mucus viscosity and the relation of increased mucus viscosity to CF lung disease has not been established. The uncertainties arise, in part, from our poor understanding of how submucosal glands work. To help dissect the physiology of gland function, we have developed methods for assessing secretion rates and composition of single submucosal glands in sheep (21Joo N.S., Wu, J.V. Krouse M.E. Saenz Y. Wine J.J. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 281: L458-L468Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and humans (20Jayaraman S. Joo N.S. Reitz B. Wine J.J. Verkman A.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 8119-8123Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). In the present studies, we extend these methods to pigs, which have been shown by Ballard and colleagues (22Ballard S.T.

Physiol. 2001; 281: L639-L645PubMed Google Scholar) to be excellent models for studying human conducting airways. Our results complement their work with whole airways and show that single glands respond to both ACh and vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) or forskolin but with markedly different response profiles. Unexpectedly, the pH of mucus produced by these different agonists is equivalent, and they respond equally to inhibitors of Cl− and HCO3− transport. Animal tracheas were harvested less than 1 h postmortem from adult Yorkshire female pigs that had been killed with pentobarbital injection after acute experiments unrelated to the present studies. Tracheas were maintained until use in ice-cold Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate (KRB) buffer bubbled with 95% O2-5% CO2. The KRB buffer composition was (in mm): 115 NaCl, 2.4 K2HPO4, 0.4 KH2PO4, 25 NaHCO3, 1.2 MgCl2, 1.2 CaCl2, and 10 glucose (pH 7.4). Osmolarity was measured on a Westcor vapor pressure osmometer and adjusted to ∼290 mosm. To minimize tissue exposure to endogenously generated prostaglandins during tissue preparation and mounting, 1.0 μm indomethacin was present in the bath throughout the experiment unless otherwise indicated. For each experiment, a tracheal ring of about 1.5 cm was cut off, opened up along the dorsal (posterior) fold in ice-cold, oxygenated KRB buffer, and pinned mucosal-side up on a pliable silicone surface. Only the cartilaginous portion of trachea was used for optical monitoring of gland secretion. The mucosa with underlying glands was dissected free and mounted mucosal-side up at the gas/liquid interface of a 35-mm, Sylgard-lined plastic Petri dish containing 2 ml of KRB buffer. The tissue surface was blotted, dried with a gentle stream of 95% O2-5% CO2 gas, and then partly covered with water-saturated mineral oil. The tissue was warmed to 37 °C at a rate of ∼1.5 °C min−1 (TC-102, Medical Systems Corp., Greenvale, NY) and superfused with warmed, humidified 95% O2-5% CO2. For bicarbonate-free experiments, all 25 mm of the HCO3−in the Krebs buffer was replaced with 1 mm HEPES plus 24 mm NaCl that had been pregassed with humidified 100% O2. The HEPES maintained the bath pH at 7.4 after gassing with O2. All pharmacological agents were diluted to final concentration with prewarmed, appropriately gassed bath solution immediately before adding to the serosal bath via complete bath replacement. For washout, the bath was replaced completely at least five times. During periods without stimulation, the bath was replaced at 10–15 min intervals with fresh 37 °C KRB solution that had been constantly gassed with 95% O2-5% CO2. No changes in secretion rate were associated with bath changes. The experimental setup was described previously (21Joo N.S., Wu, J.V. Krouse M.E. Saenz Y. Wine J.J. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 281: L458-L468Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In brief, tissues covered with water-saturated oil were obliquely illuminated to visualize the spherical droplets of secreted mucus within the oil. Most digital images were captured at 1–5 min intervals with a CCD sensor mounted on a microscope to give a resolution of ∼49,000 pixels per mm2 for an area of ∼6 mm2. In a smaller number of experiments, images of an area of ∼1.5–2 cm2 were obtained directly with the macro lens of a Nikon 3-megapixel digital camera. Such experiments gave information on an area of ∼25-fold larger but with resolution reduced to ∼15,000 pixels per mm2. Images were stored on disk for subsequent analysis with volume calculated according to the formula for a sphere. Non-spherical droplets and merged droplets were excluded from analysis. In this method, apparently spherical droplet volumes may be overestimated to the extent that counted droplets wet the surface, but this effect is minor (21Joo N.S., Wu, J.V. Krouse M.E. Saenz Y. Wine J.J. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 281: L458-L468Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Microelectrodes with resistances of ∼10 megohms when filled with pH solution (see below) were placed within the secreted mucus droplets to measure the electrical potential difference (PD) of the proximal gland lumen relative to a Ag/AgCl electrode in the bath. The electrode was connected to a microelectrode amplifier (Getting Instruments) having an input impedance of >1012 ohms. In this circumstance, the PD should result primarily from the epithelium of the ciliated and collecting ducts because the contact between the surface epithelium and the mucus is minimized by the oil layer. To measure pH, appropriate ion-selective electrodes were constructed (31Chao P. Ammann D. Oesch U. Simon W. Lang F. Pfluegers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 1988; 411: 216-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) with slight modifications. LA16 glass capillaries (Dagan) were used for pH electrodes. After pulling, the tips of the ion-sensing electrodes were broken back to an opening of 10–15 μm, and the interiors were silanized with N,N-dimethyltrimethylsilylamine (Fluka). Each electrode tip was heated to >150 °C for at least 5 min to cure the silanizing agent. The silanized electrodes were filled with electrolyte solution (31Chao P. Ammann D. Oesch U. Simon W. Lang F. Pfluegers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 1988; 411: 216-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), and then the pH resin was drawn into the pipette under suction to a depth of ∼1 mm. The resulting electrodes have resistances of ∼400 megohms and can be used with any conventional microelectrode amplifier. When the ion-selective resin in the pH electrodes contacted the oil layer, it lost its ion selectivity. To circumvent this problem, we fabricated electrodes in which the pH-sensitive resin was recessed slightly in the tip, which was then filled with a tiny amount of electrolyte solution. These worked but were difficult to fabricate and were often unstable. Therefore, most pH measurements were made without oil in chambers sealed except for a slight opening for the electrode. The chambers were superfused with water-saturated gas consisting of 95% O2-5% CO2. Equivalent results were obtained with the two methods. All compounds were obtained from Sigma unless otherwise indicated and were maintained as stock concentrations. Stock solutions in deionized water were made for carbachol, isoproterenol, phentolamine, phenylephrine, and propranolol (all at 10 mm) and VIP (0.1 mm). Bumetanide (0.1 m) was dissolved in an alkaline solution. Other stock solutions were indomethacin (10 mm) in ethanol and forskolin, atropine (10 mm), and thapsigargin (1 mm) in dimethyl sulfoxide. To fabricate pH-sensitive electrodes, we used Hydrogen Ionophore II Mixture II (Fluka). Data are means ± S.E. unless otherwise indicated. Student's t test for paired or unpaired data was used to compare the means of different treatment groups. The difference between the two means was considered to be significant whenp < 0.05. Our results are based on sampling >700 single glands from 54 pigs. We monitored on average 5 glands (range 1–11) per small format experiment (∼300 glands) and ∼100 glands per large format experiment (∼400 glands). Basal secretion was measured at 1–9 h post-harvest for 182 glands from 18 pigs (Fig.1). The mean basal secretion rate averaged over a 20-min period for each gland was 0.7 ± 0.1 nl·min−1 gland−1, and this rate was consistent over the 9-h time period. Secretion rates varied considerably among individual glands. Within a contiguous 6.25-mm2 area of tracheal tissue containing nine basally secreting glands, the fastest gland secretion rate was 38 times the slowest rate, i.e. 2.3 and 0.06 nl·min−1gland−1 (Fig. 1 a). Intergland differences greatly exceeded differences in average basal secretion rates among pigs, which varied only about 6-fold, from 0.25 ± 0.06 (10 glands) to 1.55 ± 0.28 (7 glands) nl·min−1gland−1. Basal secretion was not inhibited by 1 μm indomethacin, 0.1 μm tetrodotoxin, 10 μm atropine, or 10 μm propranolol. The mean basal secretion rate in each preparation declined over time post-harvest (Fig. 1 b). When compared with tissues tested from 1 to 9 h post-harvest, basal secretion rates measured 18–31 h post-harvest had declined to ∼38% of the initial values (0.27 ± 0.05. nl·min−1 gland−1, 129 glands in 16 pigs, p < 0.001). The number of basally secreting glands declined slightly over the same time period from 4.7 to 3.9 glands per experiment (not significant). The cause of basal secretion might be a response to a combination of trauma from the dissection, mechanical stimulation from the tissue preparation, or temperature fluctuations as reported previously (26Trout L. Gatzy J.T. Ballard S.T. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: L1095-L1099Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Gland secretion was easily distinguished from surface cell secretion (Fig. 1, c and d). When compared with glands, surface cells produced fluid droplets that were smaller and more closely spaced. Surface cell secretion was observed variably, both among pigs and in different regions of the same trachea. It did not appear to respond to carbachol or forskolin (Fig. 1 d) and did not decline in magnitude with time after harvest, as did spontaneous gland secretion. Surface cell secretion is an active process and is not leakage through a damaged epithelium because there is no hydrostatic pressure to move fluid into the oil layer (the fluid layer is ∼1 mm below the surface layer of the epithelium). Consistent with that, blue dextran placed in the bath did not appear in these droplets, nor did fluid accumulate in the oil when small holes were deliberately made in the epithelium. Surface secretions were not observed when the preparation was kept cold. We hypothesize that surface secretion originates from goblet cells but have not yet investigated this type of secretion further. Glands secreted copiously after bath application of the cholinergic agonist carbachol (10 μm). A dose-response relation was not determined, but in a small number of experiments, we determined that 1 μmwas clearly submaximal, whereas increasing the dose from 100 μm did not further increase the response. Single gland secretion to carbachol included a short latency, transient peak followed by sustained secretion that was approximately one-third of the peak response (Fig. 2, a andb). As shown, differences were observed in the temporal patterns of secretion among glands. The mean peak secretion rate to carbachol was 12.4 ± 1.1 nl·min−1 gland−1 (194 glands, 29 pigs) when measured at 1-min intervals. Rates of carbachol-stimulated peak secretion varied ∼10-fold among adjacent glands in the same preparation, i.e. from 55.8 to 5.2 nl·min−1gland−1 in one tissue preparation containing five glands in an area of 6.25 mm2, but the mean peak secretory response to carbachol across pigs varied only 3.7-fold. The mean latency to peak was 2.8 ± 0.1 min when measured at 1-min intervals (194 glands, 29 pigs, Fig. 2 c). Following the transient peak response, secretion declined to a smaller value that was sustained for as long as we were able to follow it. For 54 glands in 12 pigs, sustained secretion to carbachol, defined as secretion for at least a 5-min period occurring 15–60 min post-stimulation, was 2.4 ± 0.2 nl·min−1gland−1, versus a mean peak value of 7.8 ± 0.7 nl·min−1 gland−1 in those same glands. Sustained secretion was measured for fewer glands because mucous bubbles from adjacent glands often merged within minutes after stimulation with carbachol and thus could not be followed further. Responses to carbachol were observed for 100% of basally secreting glands. In addition, carbachol stimulated secretion from glands for which no basal secretion had been observed in at least a 20-min observation period prior to stimulation, suggesting that most glands probably respond to carbachol. In contrast with the gradual decline in basal secretion on the second day after harvest, the responses stimulated by carbachol, both peak and sustained, were unchanged during a period of at least 47 h post-harvest (Fig. 2,d and e). Thapsigargin inhibits Ca2+ uptake by the endoplasmic reticulum and elevates cytosolic Ca2+unaccompanied by rises in other intracellular signals typically involved in Ca2+-mediated responses (32Thastrup O. Cullen P.J. Drobak B.K. Hanley M.R. Dawson A.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 2466-2470Crossref PubMed Scopus (3001) Google Scholar). When applied to the bath at high concentrations (1 μm), thapsigargin produced modest but sustained secretion in ∼50% of glands after a variable latency of 10–50 min (Fig. 3). In 25 responding glands in 4 pigs, thapsigargin increased the mean sustained secretion rate 7-fold from 0.1 ± 0.05 to 0.7 ± 0.2 nl·min−1 gland−1. Subsequent addition of forskolin caused an increased rate of secretion similar to that seen with forskolin alone (1.9 ± 0.5, nl·min−1gland−1, 17 glands, 2 pigs). Subsequent addition of carbachol caused typical large and fast secretory responses. Exposure to 1 μm thapsigargin neither stimulated airway smooth muscle nor prevented the contraction induced by carbachol (Fig.4). The small and variable responses to thapsigargin suggest that this agent will be of limited use in the analysis of gland function and the comparison of glands in control and disease states. Although thapsigargin has the highly specific molecular effect of inhibiting sarcoplasmic/endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase, the consequences of such inhibition are complex within even single cells and even more so within a complex system such as the one we are studying (for example, see Ref. 33Takahashi N. Aizawa H. Fukuyama S. Inoue H. Nishima S. Hara N. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 2000; 410: 61-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar).Figure 4Response of airway smooth muscle to thapsigargin and carbachol. a, unstimulated segment of posterior (dorsal) trachea that contains the trachealis muscles.

For 30 glands in 4 pigs, only 9 glands (30%) showed increased responses after isoproterenol with peak gland secretion of 1.0 ± 0.4 nl·min−1gland−1, and this response was transient, returning to baseline within 10–20 min after the treatment. As we reported previously (21Joo N.S., Wu, J.V. Krouse M.E. Saenz Y. Wine J.J. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 281: L458-L468Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), pigs and sheep, in contrast with cats, have only small responses to phenylephrine: for 33 glands in 6 pigs, the mean peak response for 13 (39%) responding glands was 1.3 ± 0.3 nl·min−1 gland−1, and this response was also transient. Submucosal glands are innervated by peptidergic nerves, and Calu-3 cells, a serous cell model, contain functional VIP receptors (34Linden A. Yoshihara S. Cardell L.O. Kaneko T. Stjarne P. Nadel J.A. Peptides (Elmsford). 1997; 18: 843-846Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). In addition, prior work showed good secretory response to forskolin from bronchial segments of pigs (30Trout L. Corboz M.R. Ballard S.T. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 281: L639-L645PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, we looked for response to both these agents, which elevate [cAMP] i . In contrast with the transient responses to isoproterenol, pig glands showed sustained secretion to VIP and forskolin. The response profiles to these agents, which elevate [cAMP] i , differed distinctly from the responses to carbachol. They lacked a sharp, early peak, requiring 10–15 min to reach a maximum rate that was then sustained for at least 1 h. Secretion rates for eight glands in response to VIP are plotted in Fig.5. At 20 h post-harvest, VIP (1 μm) increased the secretion rate in three basally secreting glands and initiated secretion in five other glands. Secretion peaked for all glands at the 10-min time point and remained elevated for at least 45 min in all but one gland. The mean peak and sustained secretion rates to VIP were 1.15 ± 0.17 and 1.04 ± 0.51 nl·min−1 gland−1, respectively, and the mean latency to peak was 12 ± 4.5 (S.D.) min (35 glands in 5 pigs). These figures exclude one trachea with a wet appearance in which responses to VIP and carbachol were both unusually small. Response rates and profiles to forskolin (10 μm, Fig.6) were similar but somewhat larger than were those to VIP. The mean peak and sustained responses for 231 glands measured in 26 pigs was 2.29 ± 0.37 and 1.69 ± 0.22 nl·min−1 gland−1, respectively, but the distribution showed marked kurtosis and was positively skewed. The mean latency to peak was 17.8 ± 9.6 (S.D.) min for 43 glands from 6 pigs, but this figure is skewed by occasional late peaks that were only slightly higher than the rates reached at 10–15 min.Figure 6Gland secretion to forskolin. a and b, segments of a large format view 0 and 50 min after stimulation with 10 μm forskolin. c, volume increases in three glands from a different experiment as a function of time after forskolin stimulation. d, magnitude of the secretory response to forskolin as a function of time post-harvest.

Responses to forskolin (Fig. 6 d) and VIP (data not shown) did not decline for at least 24 h post-harvest. When VIP was added after forskolin, it did not cause additional secretion. When forskolin was added after VIP, it increased secretion in 4 of 11 glands in which it was possible to follow the response. The larger response to forskolin may simply mean that 1 μm VIP was not maximal; we did not try larger amounts because of cost. The magnitude of responses in glands that responded to both carbachol and forskolin were positively correlated (Fig. 6 e) with the transient peak responses to carbachol being ∼6-fold greater than the maximal response (which was ≈ sustained response) to forskolin. As expected from the above relationship and the much faster latency of the response to carbachol, we observed a small proportion of glands that responded to carbachol but not to forskolin. We used bumetanide to block the Na+–K+–2Cl− cotransporter NKCC1 in an attempt to reduce or eliminate Cl−-mediated fluid transport. We replaced HCO3− with HEPES and gassed with air to eliminate HCO3−-mediated fluid transport. Carbachol-stimulated secretion was inhibited by ∼50% by each inhibitor and reduced by 90% when they were used in combination (Fig.7 a). Forskolin-stimulated secretion showed a similar pattern (Fig. 7 b). The numbers of secreting glands were counted in six large format experiments from four pigs (e.g.Fig. 8), giving the values shown in TableI. The overall average was 1.3 secreting glands/mm2. This figure is similar to figures based on anatomical methods (35Choi H.K. Finkbeiner W.E. Widdicombe J.H. J. Anat. 2000; 197: 361-372Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 36Widdicombe J.H. Chen L.L.

https://openalex.org/W2001888139,"Sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) is a plasma protein synthesized and secreted by the liver. Its initial description stemmed from its ability to bind estrogens and androgens and its capacity to regulate the free concentration of the steroids that bind to it. Additionally, it participates in signal transduction for certain steroid hormones at the cell membrane. It binds with high affinity to a specific membrane receptor (RSHBG) in prostate stromal and epithelial cells, wherein the SHBG·RSHBG complex forms. An appropriate steroid binds to this complex and results in increases of intracellular cAMP. These two disparate functions of SHBG, regulation of the concentration of free steroids in plasma and signal transduction in selected tissues, raise the question of how its synthesis and secretion might be regulated so as to best perform these two disparate functions. In this paper we demonstrate that SHBG is produced in human prostate cancer cell lines (LNCaP, DU 145, and PC 3) as well as in cultured human prostate epithelial and stromal cells. In addition, in tissue sections of human prostate, we demonstrate the presence of SHBG (immunocytochemistry) and SHBG mRNA (in situhybridization). These observations are consistent with the hypothesis that SHBG, destined to participate in signaling at the cell membrane, is locally regulated and produced.

It is the major regulator of free estrogens and androgens in plasma (2Rosner W. Adashi E.Y. Rock J.A. Rosenwaks Z. Reproductive Endocrinology, Surgery, and Technology.

Androl. 1992; 13: 107-116PubMed Google Scholar); it is an initiating component of a signaling system for estrogens and androgens at the cell membrane that functions via a G protein (5Nakhla A.M. Leonard J. Hryb D.J. Rosner W. Steroids. 1999; 64: 213-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) and cAMP (6Nakhla A.M. Khan M.S. Rosner W. J. Clin. Endocrinol.

Romas N.A. Steroids. 1998; 63: 278-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The details of the working of these systems generate a model that is in need of clarification in a number of crucial respects. In this paper we present data that deal with the source of the SHBG for signaling at the cell membrane. These data support a model in which the source of SHBG for signaling is not the plasma, but rather the target cells themselves. SHBG participates in signaling by first binding to its receptor (RSHBG) on selected cell membranes. After this occurs, the binding to SHBG of an agonist steroid stimulates the rapid production of cAMP. There are a number of important details that constrain this event. SHBG cannot bind to its receptor if it is already bound to a steroid (whether an agonist or antagonist). It is an allosteric protein that, after it binds a steroid, assumes a conformation that prohibits binding to RSHBG (10Hryb D.J. Khan M.S. Romas N.A. Rosner W. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 6048-6054Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The sequence of events must be exact: SHBG must first bind to RSHBG forming SHBG-RSHBG and the steroid must bind to that complex. If the steroid is an antagonist (as are most steroids that bind to SHBG) then no signal is generated; if the steroid is an agonist,e.g. 3α-androstanediol, estradiol (11Fissore F. Fortunati N. Comba A. Fazzari A. Gaidano G. Berta L. Frairia R. Steroids. 1994; 59: 661-667Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 12Nakhla A.M. Khan M.S. Romas N.P. Rosner W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Metab. 1995; 80: 2259-2262PubMed Google Scholar), a signal (cAMP) ensues. None of the foregoing explicitly addresses the source of the SHBG that binds to RSHBG. Until now, its origin has been presumed to be the liver, which synthesizes and secretes SHBG into the plasma (1Khan M.S. Knowles B.B. Aden D.P. Rosner W. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1981; 53: 448-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). In women (in plasma) about 50% of SHBG is not bound to steroids and in men unbound SHBG constitutes about 20% (14Dunn J.F. Nisula B.C. Rodbard D. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1981; 53: 58-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (1035) Google Scholar). Although a number of factors cause substantial increases or decrease in plasma SHBG, these changes take place in days to weeks not hours to minutes (2Rosner W. Adashi E.Y. Rock J.A. Rosenwaks Z. Reproductive Endocrinology, Surgery, and Technology. Raven Press, New York1996: 605-626Google Scholar). Furthermore, these changes are chronic ones that persist; there is little short term (hours) variation in plasma SHBG. Thus, if plasma were the source of SHBG for binding to RSHBG, the substrate for any rapidly mediated SHBG signaling would have to be via either change in steroid concentration or by rapid changes in RSHBG at the cell surface. There are some data in the literature that imply the possibility that SHBG is produced locally. Reports of SHBG immunologic activity in a variety of tissues, with one exception (15Noe G. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1999; 68: 111-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), are tempered by the presumption that it is there by virtue of having been taken up from the plasma (16Bordin S. Petra P.H. Proc.

In this paper we demonstrate that SHBG is synthesized and secreted by tissues and cells that are known to have RSHBG, thus creating the potential for the local regulation of SHBG signaling by autocrine and paracrine mechanisms. Human prostatic LNCaP, PC 3, and DU 145 cancer cell lines were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC; Manassas, VA) and maintained in recommended growth media. Cells were refed every 3–4 days and split 1:4 to 1:8 when nearing 80% confluence. The ALVA-41 cell line was obtained from Drs. S. Loop and S. Ostensen of the American Lake Veterans Affairs Medical Center (Tacoma, WA) and maintained as described previously (21Nakhla A.M. Rosner W. Steroids. 1994; 59: 586-589Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Highly purified human SHBG was prepared and its purity verified as described previously (6Nakhla A.M. Khan M.S. Rosner W. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1990; 71: 398-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Prostatic tissues were obtained from patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia at the time of prostatectomy and immediately brought to the laboratory under sterile conditions. Tissues were minced, mixed with RPMI 1640, containing 1% collagenase and 0.05% DNase, and incubated for 30 min (37 °C, 5% CO2, 95% air) with occasional shaking. The mixture was centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 10 min, the supernatant discarded, and the tissues redigested for 1 h. The dissociated cells were suspended in RPMI 1640, containing 10% fetal bovine serum and 1 mm sodium pyruvate, and plated in 75-cm2 Corning flasks. The medium was changed after 6 days and every 5 days thereafter. The primary culture was enriched for stromal cells by supplementing the growth medium with 10% fetal bovine serum and 20 ng/ml insulin (12Nakhla A.M. Khan M.S. Romas N.P. Rosner W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 5402-5405Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Stromal cell identity was confirmed by staining with a monoclonal antibody specific to human vimentin intermediate filament (Novacastra, Newcastle, UK) (Fig. 1). Epithelial cell colonies were morphologically identified from duplicate cultures plated in cell culture dishes. These colonies were isolated and propagated in RPMI 1640, 5% fetal bovine serum, and 1 mm sodium pyruvate. After multiple passages, four cell lines from four different tissues were spontaneously immortalized. In their 20th passage, each has a doubling time of about 2 days. The epithelial identity of the cells was confirmed by staining with a monoclonal antibody specific to human cytokeratins 5, 6, 8, and 18 intermediate filaments (Novacastra). Color development was as described under “Immunocytochemistry (Immunofluorescence).” Total RNA from each cell type was isolated using the TRIzol reagent according to the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen). One μg of total RNA was used to prepare first strand cDNA using the Advantage RT-for-PCR kit (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA) according to their instructions. For RT-PCR, the PCR reaction mixture contained: 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm dCTP, dGTP, dTTP, and dATP, 2.5 units of Taq polymerase (PlatinumTaq polymerase; Invitrogen), 1 μmconcentration of each primer and the cDNA, in a total volume of 50 μl of PCR reaction buffer. The PCR reaction was carried out in a GeneAmp PCR, system 9600 (PerkinElmer). PCR amplification was performed as follows: denaturation at 94 °C for 30 s, annealing at 55 °C for 1 min (54 °C for the androgen receptor), and extension at 72 °C for 2 min for 30 cycles (25 cycles for β-actin). The final PCR products were electrophoresed on 1.2% agarose, visualized with ethidium bromide, and digitally imaged using the Electrophoresis Documentation and Analysis System 120 (Eastman Kodak Co.). The sequence of primers for SHBG, and the androgen receptor (AR), were taken from the literature and directed amplification of specific regions of the appropriate cDNAs: SHBG, bp 628–1148, spanning exons 5–8 (22Hammond G.L.

LNCaP, PC 3, and DU 145 cells were grown on NUNC CC2 chamber slides (Nalgene Nunc International, Naperville, IL) for 3 days, rinsed in PBS, and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) for 30 min ± 0.1% Triton X-100 (permeabilized). The cells were then rinsed with 0.1 mglycine/PBS and Tris-buffered saline (TBS) and treated with SuperBlock Blocking Buffer (Pierce) for 1 h ± 0.1% Triton X-100. Following blocking, the cells were incubated overnight (4 °C) with a monoclonal antibody against SHBG (10 μg/ml, 5B2) in SuperBlock Blocking Buffer that was diluted 1/5 in TBS or 10 μg/ml mouse IgG1 (Southern Biotechnology Associates, Birmingham, AL) that was similarly diluted. Cells were rinsed again in TBS for 5 min and then incubated (30 min, room temperature) with the green fluor, Alexa-488 coupled to rabbit anti-mouse IgG1 (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) that was diluted 1:500 in SuperBlock Blocking Buffer. Cells were rinsed in TBS and then twice in PBS for 5 min each, fixed for 10 min in freshly prepared 4% PFA, rinsed again as before, and then mounted with Vectastain mounting medium containing the blue nuclear dye DAPI (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). In experiments in which SHBG and/or 2-methoxyestradiol were added, LNCaP cells were grown as usual in eight-well CC2 chamber slides. After 2 days, the cells were washed with PBS. To appropriate wells we added: 0.5 ml of Opti-MEM I, 0.5 ml of OPTI-MEM containing 100 nm highly purified, stripped (devoid of steroids) SHBG, or 0.5 ml of Opti-MEM containing 1.0 μm 2MeOE2 and 100 nm SHBG. After incubating overnight in 5% C02, 95% air, the chamber slide was washed three times with PBS and processed for immunofluorescence as above. Imaging was with either an Olympus BX60 microscope, attached to a MicroImager II digital camera (QIMAGING, Burnaby, Canada), or an LSM 5 Pascal confocal microscope (Zeiss Inc). Frozen samples of prostate were cut into 5-μm sections and mounted onto glass microscope slides. Samples were fixed in 4% PFA for 30 min, blocked with normal horse serum for 1 h, and incubated overnight (4 °C) with rabbit anti-SHBG (24Khan M.S. Ewen E. Rosner W. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1982; 54: 705-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) (1:10,000 dilution) in normal horse serum. Slides were developed by the ABC method (Vector ABC elite system) using 3,3′-diaminobenzidine counterstained with hematoxylin and mounted with Vectamount (Vector Laboratories) permanent mounting medium. Photographs were taken with a 35-mm camera, mounted on an Olympus BX60 microscope (×400), and digitized. Paraffin-embedded prostate sections were deparaffinized according to the protocol described in the Biogenex Super Sensitive In-Situ Hybridization Kit. The sections were placed in an RNase block for 5 min, fixed in 4% PFA for 30 min, prehybridized for 60 min (37 °C), and then rinsed in PBS. A 521-bp SHBG-(628–1148) biotinylated probe was prepared by PCR incorporation of biotin-14-dCTP (Invitrogen) into the SHBG PCR product. The probe was added to the slides, which were heated (95 °C) for 10 min, and then incubated overnight (37 °C) in a humidified chamber. Slides were developed using the ABC method (Biogenex Super Sensitive In-Situ Hybridization Kit), using 3,3′-diaminobenzidine as the substrate, and counterstained with hematoxylin before mounting using Vectamount (Vector Laboratories) permanent mounting medium. Photographs were taken with a 35-mm camera mounted to a BX60 microscope (Olympus) and digitized. We generated four human prostate stromal cell cultures (HPSC1–HPSC4) and four human epithelial (HPEC1–HPEC4) cell lines with samples of tissue taken from patients undergoing prostate surgery. Immediately after removal, samples were minced, cultured, and enriched for either stromal or epithelial cells. All human cells were characterized immunocytochemically with the stromal cell-specific vimentin antibody and the epithelial cell-specific pancytokeratin antibody (25Kabalin J.N. Peehl D.M. Stamey T.A. Prostate. 1989; 14: 251-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The stromal cultures stained with the vimentin antibody but not with pancytokeratin antibody, whereas the epithelial cells stained with the pancytokeratin antibody but not with the vimentin antibody (Fig. 1 A). As expected, the stromal cells expressed the stromal cell-specific KGF gene, but not the epithelial cell-specific gene, PSA (Fig.1 B). In addition, none of the epithelial cell lines expressed KGF. To the best of our knowledge, epithelial cell lines that constitutively express PSA have not been reported. Thus, it was surprising that even a single cell line (HPEC4) expressed this gene. Its identity was confirmed by restriction mapping with the 4-base cutters, HinfI and HaeIII. The slightly larger and less intense background fragments from HPSC1, -2, -4, and HPEC1–3 gave different restriction patterns (data not shown). Both cell types expressed the androgen receptor. That cultured human prostate cells synthesize SHBG mRNA was shown by RT-PCR analysis of established prostate cancer cell lines, the four stromal cultures, and the four epithelial cell lines described above (Fig. 2). cDNA templates were prepared from total cellular RNA isolated from: human LNCaP, DU 145, PC 3, and ALVA 41 prostate cancer cell lines; the HPSC1–HPSC4 stromal cultures; HPEC1–HPEC4 epithelial lines, whole prostate; and Hep G2 cells, which synthesize and secrete SHBG (1Khan M.S. Knowles B.B. Aden D.P. Rosner W. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1981; 53: 448-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 26Rosner W. Aden D.P. Khan M.S. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1984; 59: 806-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). As an additional positive control, we examined a stromal culture transfected with an SHBG expression vector (TrHPSC3). SHBG primers were selected to amplify a 521-bp band encompassing sequences from exons 5–8 (22Hammond G.L. Underhill D.A. Smith C.L. Goping I.S. Harley M.J. Musto N.A. Cheng C.Y. Bardin C.W. FEBS Lett. 1987; 215: 100-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). A 521-bp SHBG RT-PCR transcript was generated in samples from the three human prostate cancer cell lines, the four stromal cultures (including the transfected one), the four epithelial lines, whole prostate, and the Hep G2 cells. In addition, a smaller 313-bp fragment, consistent with the alternatively spliced SHBG transcript (SHBGT) lacking exon 7 (27Hammond G.L. Underhill D.A. Rykse H.M. Smith C.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1989; 3: 1869-1876Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 28Gershagen S. Lundwall A. Fernlund P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 9245-9258Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 29Sullivan P.M. Wang Y.-M. Joseph D.R. Mol. Endocrinol. 1993; 7: 702-715PubMed Google Scholar), was generated at a lower apparent abundance in all but the HPEC 1 RT-PCR samples. DNA sequence analysis confirmed the identities of these two bands (data not shown). Unexpectedly, we also observed a smaller 178-bp RT-PCR band in the same samples (data not shown), which sequence analysis showed to result from direct splicing of exon 5 to exon 8. The significance of this alternatively spliced transcript is not clear at the this time. Thus, SHBG mRNA is expressed in both prostate epithelial and stromal cells, as well as in prostate cancer cell lines. LNCaP, DU 145, and PC 3 prostate cancer cell lines, permeabilized with Triton X-100 after fixation, were probed with both monoclonal (Fig. 3) and polyclonal antibodies to SHBG. Identical results were obtained with a polyclonal antibody (64-4) generated in this laboratory (24Khan M.S. Ewen E. Rosner W. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1982; 54: 705-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) and seven different monoclonal antibodies, four obtained from Dr. Niver P. Sahakian (Diagnostic Products) and three from Lewis et al. (30Lewis J.G. Longley N.J. Elder P.A. Steroids. 1999; 64: 259-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Monoclonal antibody 5B2 (Diagnostic Products) proved to be the best with which to work, but qualitatively similar results were seen with all the other antibodies. To rule out contamination of the growth medium, we assayed it for SHBG with an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (Alpha Diagnostic International, San Antonio, TX) whose limit of detection for SHBG is 0.2 nm. None was detected. (For comparison, the average SHBG concentration in the plasma of men is 25 nm (31Rosner W. Forest M.G. Pugeat M. Binding Proteins of Steroid Hormones. John Libbey Eurotext, London1986Google Scholar).) SHBG is visualized clearly in the cytoplasm, but not the nucleus, of all three cell lines. Although we have chosen representative photomicrographs, we should emphasize that LNCaP cells both stain more intensely than the other lines and also (less apparent) show such staining in a greater fraction of the cells than either DU 145 or PC 3 cells. Nonpermeabilized LNCaP cells showed some membrane staining for SHBG (Fig. 5 A2), consistent with secretion of SHBG and binding to RSHBG. Western blot analysis confirmed that SHBG is synthesized by LNCaP, DU145, and to a lesser extent, PC3 cells (data not shown).Figure 52-Methoxyestradiol suppresses membrane-associated immunofluorescence in LNCaP cells.LNCaP cells, in serum free medium, with (permeabilized) or without (nonpermeabilized) Triton X-100, were exposed to SHBG ± 2-methoxyestradiol and visualized with a monoclonal antibody (5B2) to SHBG (green) and were counterstained with DAPI (blue). The antibody control was mouse IgG. Theinsets are confocal micrographs that do not have a nuclear counterstain.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) In normal prostate tissue, SHBG is intensely stained in epithelial cells, with the most intense staining seen in the luminal epithelial cells (Fig.4 B). In addition, there is staining in the stroma, but it is less intense. Because there is a substantial concentration of SHBG in plasma, the staining seen in sections of human prostate could result from simple diffusion of SHBG from plasma with subsequent cellular uptake. Indeed, that is the inference from early observations in both monkey (16Bordin S. Petra P.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 5678-5682Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar) and man (17Usui T. Ishibe T. Nakatsu H. Nakahara M. Nihira H. Miyachi Y. Urol. Int. 1983; 38: 16-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar), and there is no subsequent literature that takes issue with this conjecture. To address this issue, we examined sections, adjacent to those used for SHBG expression, by in situ hybridization. In these sections of the prostate, SHBG mRNA appears in the same cells as the protein (Fig. 4, A and B). As for the SHBG protein, SHBG mRNA is most abundant in luminal epithelial cells. We also note that staining for both SHBG protein and SHBG mRNA is rather heterogeneous throughout the prostate, with areas of intense staining and other areas of zero to light staining. These observations are consistent with a model in which SHBG is synthesized and secreted primarily by epithelial cells and binds to the RSHBG on epithelial and/or stromal cells. Using LNCaP cells, which are known to have RSHBG (6Nakhla A.M. Khan M.S. Rosner W. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1990; 71: 398-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar), we sought to demonstrate whether binding of SHBG to RSHBG could be demonstrated immunocytochemically (Fig.5) and whether this binding could be inhibited by ligands for SHBG as is the case for the solubilized receptor (10Hryb D.J. Khan M.S. Romas N.A. Rosner W. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 6048-6054Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Conversely, the presence of ligands for SHBG should not alter intracellular SHBG. We stained permeabilized and nonpermeabilized LNCaP cells with monoclonal antibody 5B2. Staining in the former represents both intra- and extracellular SHBG, while staining of the latter represents SHBG outside of the cell that is inferentially bound to RSHBG. All experiments were also done ± added SHBG and with both immunofluorescent and confocal microscopy. Addition of SHBG markedly increased intracellular staining in the permeabilized cells (panel B3) and membrane staining in the nonpermeabilized ones (panel A3). Most significant is the marked decrease in membrane staining (nonpermeabilized cells) seen when added SHBG is preincubated with 2-methoxyestradiol (panel A4). This steroid is known to inhibit the binding of SHBG to RSHBG (10Hryb D.J. Khan M.S. Romas N.A. Rosner W. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 6048-6054Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and to function as an antagonist to the signaling induced by the estradiol·SHBG·RSHBG complex (13Nakhla A.M. Ding V.D.H.

Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 213-218Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The lack of effect of 2-methoxyestradiol on SHBG staining in permeabilized cells (panel B4) supports the specificity of this effect. That SHBG, or an SHBG-like antigen, exists in human prostate has been documented in a number of laboratories both by biochemical (34Cowan R.A. Cowan S.K. Giles C.A. Grant J.K. J. Endocrinol. 1976; 71: 121-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 35Krieg M. Bartsch W. Herzer S. Becker H. Voigt K.D.

Petra P.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 5678-5682Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 18Sinnecker G. Hiort O. Mitze M. Donn F. Neumann S. Steroids. 1988; 52: 335-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). However, the uniform interpretation of these results has been that the origin of the protein was from the plasma. In contradistinction to that supposition, we show that prostate stromal cell cultures, epithelial cell lines, and prostatic tissue all express SHBG mRNA and protein. Each of the cultures and cell lines derived from patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia express both SHBGL and its exon 7-lacking isoform (SHBGT) transcripts (Fig. 2), as do the three prostate cancer cell lines, LNCaP, PC 3, and DU 145 (Fig. 3). With the exception of HPEC 1, all of the cells express greater amounts of SHBGL than SHBGT. In the SHBG stromal cell explant transfected with an SHBG expression vector, TrHPSC3, the massive overexpression of SHBGL drowns out any detectable SHBGT; nontransfected HPSC3 cells showed both bands (data not shown). Although not immediately apparent from the figures, we have noted that SHBG expression in tissue sections, cultured cells, and cancer cell lines is heterogeneous. Both the intensity of the staining in individual cells and the number of cells that are positive for SHBG varies with the field that is under examination. The single paper dealing with SHBG in tissue sections of prostate cancer contained data demonstrating the same phenomenon (17Usui T. Ishibe T. Nakatsu H. Nakahara M. Nihira H. Miyachi Y. Urol. Int. 1983; 38: 16-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). Although we have shown that both SHBG mRNA and protein are synthesized in all the prostate material we examined, it is not conclusively clear whether the protein is translated exclusively from SHBGL. Little is known about the SHBGT isoform; its full-length sequence has not been reported, and the protein it encodes has neither been identified in vivo nor shown to be stable in vitro. SHBGL and SHBGTshare a common reading frame from the middle of exon 2 through exon 6 (27Hammond G.L. Underhill D.A. Rykse H.M. Smith C.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1989; 3: 1869-1876Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 28Gershagen S. Lundwall A. Fernlund P.

Biol. 1991; 40: 771-775Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) and, if stably expressed, the SHBGT protein might bind to the antibodies used in these experiments. That SHBG protein is observed on the membranes of isolated cell lines suggests that its only source is SHBGL; the putative protein encoded by SHBGT lacks a signal peptide and should not leave the cell. However, it might serve an intracellular function. For instance, since the mRNA retains the dimerization domain (38Avvakumov G.V. Grishkovskaya I. Muller Y.A. Hammond G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 34453-34457Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), it could form heterodimers with SHBGL, with consequences yet to be determined. The impact of these observations on the possible roles for SHBG is substantial. Locally regulated intracellular SHBG, in target cells for appropriate steroid hormones, could alter the intracellular free concentration of those hormones and affect their access to the classic intracellular receptors (androgen and/or estrogen). Of equal or possibly greater importance, it appears reasonable to hypothesize that the source of SHBG for membrane signaling in the prostate is that which is synthesized in the prostate itself. Thus, the regulation of its synthesis must play an important role in this signaling. This clearly is an area requiring investigation, because other than in the liver, nothing is known of it. Heretofore, the role of SHBG as the major determinant of free androgens and estrogens in plasma has been the central force driving many clinical studies of plasma SHBG in both benign and malignant disease of the prostate (36Krieg M.

However, many proteins do not form crystals, and many are too large to solve by NMR. New methods are therefore urgently needed to determine structures of such intractable proteins. Here we develop a mutagenesis-based modeling method and apply it to the ligand binding region of the nicotinic AChR1 from adult human muscle. The method uses lysine scanning to distinguish core hydrophobic from surface hydrophilic orientations of residue side chains and uses this information to align residues in AChR subunits with equivalent residues in the homologous AChBP, which was solved by x-ray crystallography (1Brejc K. van Dijk W. Klassen R. Schuurmans M. van der Oost J. Smit A. Sixma T. Nature. 2001; 411: 269-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (1580) Google Scholar). The experimentally determined alignment forms the foundation for generating an atomic structural model of the ligand binding region of the heteromeric AChR. Knowledge of nicotinic receptor structure advanced along two independent lines of investigation over the past decade. The first line stemmed from primary sequence data deduced from cloning AChR subunits and their relatives (2Noda M. Takahashi H. Tanabe T. Toyosato M. Furutani Y. Hirose T. Asai M. Inayama S. Miyata T. Numa S. Nature. 1982; 299: 793-797Crossref PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar). These studies included prediction of membrane spanning regions using hydropathy analysis, prediction of secondary structure from the sequence data (3Le Novère N. Corringer P.-J. Changeux J.-P. Biophys. J. 1999; 76: 2329-2345Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), identification of key residues by affinity labeling together with microsequencing, and site-directed mutagenesis combined with functional measurements (4Prince R. Sine S.M. Barrantes F.J. The Nicotinic Acetylcholine Receptor: Current Views and Future Trends. Landes Bioscience, Austin, TX1997: 31-59Google Scholar, 5Karlin A. Akabas M.H.

The emerging picture of the AChR indicated a pentamer in which about half of each subunit contributes to an N-terminal extracellular domain that harbors the ACh binding sites. The remainder of each subunit consists of four transmembrane domains, the second of which contributes to the ion channel, and a large cytoplasmic domain between the third and fourth transmembrane domains. Mutagenesis and site-directed labeling localized the ACh binding sites to interfaces between α and non-α subunits (4Prince R. Sine S.M. Barrantes F.J. The Nicotinic Acetylcholine Receptor: Current Views and Future Trends. Landes Bioscience, Austin, TX1997: 31-59Google Scholar, 6Corringer P.J. Le Novère Changeux J.P. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2000; 40: 431-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (706) Google Scholar), whereas studies of residue accessibility and residues affecting ion permeability revealed the channel gate and ion selectivity filter within the second transmembrane domain (7Wilson G. Karlin A. Neuron. 1998; 20: 1269-1281Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 8Corringer P.J. Bertrand S. Galzi J.L. Devillers-Thiery A. Changeux J.P. Bertrand D. Neuron. 1999; 22: 831-843Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Advances along the second line of investigation came from cryo-electron microscopy of two-dimensional arrays of AChRs from Torpedo. Data at 9-Å resolution revealed the overall shape and dimensions of the AChR and identified secondary structural elements in the vicinity of the ACh binding site and the ion channel (9Unwin N. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 229: 1101-1124Crossref PubMed Scopus (717) Google Scholar). The most recent data at 4.6-Å resolution revealed several aligned β strands near the putative ACh binding site, and a fenestrated basket-like structure extending into the cytoplasm (10Miyazawa A. Fujiyoshi Y. Stowell M. Unwin N. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 288: 765-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar). Images obtained following rapid application of ACh revealed that each subunit twists about the axis normal to the membrane when the ion channel opens (11Unwin N. Nature. 1995; 373: 37-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (909) Google Scholar). Overall, the cryo-electron microscopy data could be reconciled with the mutagenesis, labeling, and functional measurements, although the precise locations of the ACh binding sites and channel gate remained controversial. Atomic structural insight recently emerged from the crystal structure of AChBP, a 120-kDa acetylcholine binding protein homologous to the ligand binding region of the AChR (1Brejc K. van Dijk W. Klassen R. Schuurmans M. van der Oost J. Smit A. Sixma T. Nature. 2001; 411: 269-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (1580) Google Scholar). The sequence of AChBP is 23.9% identical to that of the homomeric α7 AChR and harbors residues considered diagnostic of nicotinic receptor α subunits, including disulfide-bonded cysteines and aromatic residues that contribute to the ACh binding site. These conserved elements suggest that AChBP may provide a model for the three-dimensional structure of the ligand binding domain of the AChR and its relatives. Here we combine lysine scanning mutagenesis, ligand binding measurements, and homology modeling to deduce a structural model of the ligand binding region of the nicotinic AChR from adult human muscle. Lysine scanning of the ε subunit reveals that it oligomerizes with complementary AChR subunits when lysine is placed at alternating positions along the protein chain, indicating the presence of β strands and establishing orientation of the side chains toward core hydrophobic and surface hydrophilic environments. The side-chain orientations allow alignment of equivalent residues between the ε subunit and AChBP, forming the foundation for homology modeling. The resulting atomic structural model provides a detailed picture of the AChR ligand binding site and discloses novel residue pairs that stabilize subunit interfaces. 125I-Labeled α-bgt was from PerkinElmer Life Sciences, d-tubocurarine chloride from ICN Pharmaceuticals, Inc., 293 human embryonic kidney cells (293 HEK) were from the American Type Culture Collection, α-conotoxin GI was from Sigma Chemical Co., and the fully methylated analog ofd-tubocurarine, metocurine iodide, was a gift from the Eli Lilly Co. Human adult AChR subunit cDNAs were obtained as described previously (12Ohno K. Wang H.-L. Milone M. Bren N. Brengman J.M. Nakano S. Quiram P. Pruitt J.N. Sine S.M. Engel A.G. Neuron. 1996; 17: 157-170Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar) and subcloned into the cytomegalovirus-based expression vector, pRBG4, as described (13Sine S.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 9436-9440Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Mutations were constructed using the QuikChange kit from Stratagene. All mutations were confirmed by dideoxy sequencing. HEK cells were transfected with mutant or wild type AChR subunit cDNAs using calcium phosphate precipitation as described (13Sine S.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 9436-9440Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). In all experiments, AChR subunit cDNAs were co-transfected in the following quantities per 10-cm plate of HEK cells: α (13.6 μg) and β, and ε and δ (6.8 μg). Three days after transfection, intact HEK cells were harvested by gentle agitation in phosphate-buffered saline plus 5 mm EDTA. Ligand binding to intact cells was measured by competition against the initial rate of125I-α-bungarotoxin (α-bgt) binding (14Sine S.M. Taylor P. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 3315-3325Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). After harvesting, the cells were briefly centrifuged, resuspended in high potassium Ringer's solution, and divided into aliquots for ligand binding measurements. Potassium Ringer's solution contains 140 mm KCl, 5.4 mm NaCl, 1.8 mmCaCl2, 1.7 mm MgCl2, 25 mm HEPES, 30 mg/liter bovine serum albumin, adjusted to pH 7.4 with 10–11 mm NaOH. Specified concentrations of competing ligand were added 30 min prior to adding125I-α-bgt, which was allowed to bind for 30 min to occupy approximately half of the surface receptors. Binding was terminated by addition of 2 ml of potassium Ringer's solution containing 100 μm d-tubocurarine chloride. Cells were immediately filtered through Whatman GF-B filters using a Brandel cell harvester and washed five times with 2 ml of potassium Ringer's solution. Prior to use, filters were soaked in water containing 4% dried skim milk for at least 2 h. Nonspecific binding was determined in the presence of 1 mm d-tubocurarine. The total number of α-bgt binding sites was determined by incubation with the toxin for 90 min. The initial rate of α-bgt binding was calculated as described (14Sine S.M. Taylor P. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 3315-3325Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) to yield fractional ligand occupancy. Competition measurements were analyzed according to one of the following equations: the Hill equation (Equation 1), the sum of two binding sites present in equal numbers (Equation 2), one binding site plus a constant (Equation 3), the sum of two binding sites present in unequal numbers (Equation 4), and weighted contributions of Equations 2 and 3 (Equation 5), 1−Y=1/(1+([ligand]/KApp)n)Equation 1 1−Y=0.5/(1+[ligand]/KA)+0.5/(1+[ligand]/KB)Equation 2 1−Y=FractA[1/(1+[ligand]/KA)]+1−FractAEquation 3 1−Y=FractA[1/(1+[ligand]/KA)]+(1−FractA)(1/(1+[ligand]/KB)Equation 4 1−Y=Fract2­site[1/(1+[ligand]/KA)+1/(1+[ligand]/KB)]+(1−Fract2­site)[FractA/(1+[ligand]/KA)+1−FractA]Equation 5 where Y is fractional ligand occupancy, nis the Hill coefficient, K APP is an apparent dissociation constant, K A andK B are intrinsic dissociation constants, FractA is the fraction of sites with dissociation constantK A, and Fract2-site is the fraction of binding sites with equal numbers of K A andK B sites. We generated a homology model of the major extracellular domain of the adult human AChR using version 6.0 of the program MODELER (15Sali A. Blundell T.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 234: 779-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (10563) Google Scholar), together with spatial restraints provided by the AChBP structure (1Brejc K. van Dijk W. Klassen R. Schuurmans M. van der Oost J. Smit A. Sixma T. Nature. 2001; 411: 269-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (1580) Google Scholar). We aligned AChR and AChBP sequences based on side-chain dispositions determined by lysine scanning combined with ligand binding measurements, as described under “Results” (Table Iand Fig. 4). However, to model strand β1, spatial restraints were removed for AChR εL40 and two flanking residues to account for its surface exposure (see Fig. 5), which is contrary to the corresponding aligned residue, Ile-38, in AChBP. To maintain complementarity between subunits at their interfaces, all five subunits were modeled simultaneously. AChR α subunits were matched to A and C subunits of AChBP, and the ε, δ, and β subunits were matched with the B, D, and E subunits, respectively. We used the “patch” command in MODELER to constrain coordinates of cysteines 128 and 142, which form a disulfide bond in each subunit. Among several options in MODELER, we selected the “refine1” mode, which generates the highest level of refinement using conjugate gradients coupled with simulated annealing and molecular dynamics. Modeling included all polar hydrogens to allow for main-chain hydrogen bonding but omitted non-polar hydrogens. We used MODELER to generate 100 different structures, and evaluated each structure using the programs PROCHECK (34Laskowski R. MacArthur M. Moss D. Thornton J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar) and PROFILES-3D (InsightII, Accelrys Inc., San Diego, CA). Among the 100 structures, ∼10 were of high quality and very similar, and we selected the best of these for further modeling.Table IExpression and CTx GI competition parameters for lysine mutationsAChRεAChBPExpressionK AK BFraction Aα2βεδ1.01.9E−91.1E−70.5α2βδ20.35.8E−9NC1-aNC, a second component was present but that there was no competition at CTx GI concentrations greater than 30 μm (see Fig. 1 b).

The major insertions requiring additional modeling were the linkers between strands β8 and β9 in β, ε, and δ subunits, which contain eight, eight, and eleven inserted residues, respectively. The α subunit contains only one insertion in this linker, which MODELER is designed to accommodate (17Fiser A. Sanchez R. Melo F. Sali A. Watanabe M. Roux R. MacKerell A. Becker O. Computational Biochemistry and Biophysics. Marcel Dekker Inc., New York2000: 275-312Google Scholar). To model the β8–β9 linker in the ε subunit, a second round of MODELER was employed using different sequence alignments in this region and constraining coordinates of all atoms except those of the β8–β9 linker. This was an empirical process, and we selected structures that satisfied several criteria. First, we required εF160 in this linker, and equivalent residues in other subunits, to project into the hydrophobic core to account for the observation that εF160K produced predominantly misfolded subunits (Table II). Second, we selected structures in which endogenous positively charged residues in the linker project away from the hydrophobic interior; these included εK171, εK167, δK164, δK167, and δR170. Third, we required εD175 and δD180 to approach within 10–15 Å of αC192/193 determined in cross-linking experiments (16Czajkowski C. Karlin A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3160-3164Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) and within 15–20 Å of εL119 or δL121 determined from double-mutant cycles analysis of α-neurotoxin binding (18Malany S. Osaka H. Sine S.M. Taylor P. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 15388-15398Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Although these constraints are qualitative, in practice they eliminated many candidate structures. PROCHECK and PROFILES 3-D were used to select the best structure for further modeling.Table IICtx GI and metocurine competition parameters for lysine mutations yielding subunit-containing (α2βεδ) and subunit-omitted receptors (α2βδ2)MutantCTx GI parametersMetocurine parametersK AK BFraction two-siteα2βδ2/α2βεδK AK BFractionK Aα2βδ2/α2βεδα2βεδ1.9E−91.1E−71.00.07.2E−86.0E−60.50.0I56K7.4E−95.7E−70.540.851.5E−79.5E−60.251.0L92K4.1E−93.1E−70.720.397.9E−76.0E−60.40.25W118K2.1E−91.5E−70.461.24.0E−71.7E−50.330.52S148K6.7E−91.6E−70.320.476.7E−87.5E−60.261.1F160K1.3E−85.5E−80.380.614.2E−84.8E−60.40.25I215K5.7E−93.1E−70.640.341.8E−75.9E−60.220.79P191K2.4E−91.5E−70.900.114.2E−84.8E−60.40.25I194K5.0E−91.8E−70.860.166.9E−89.6E−60.490.02T208K4.9E−91.5E−70.800.258.2E−81.2E−50.450.11For CTx GI competition results, parameters are fits of Equation 5 to the data where K A and K B are dissociation constants and Fraction two-site is the fraction of sites corresponding to α2βεδ receptors, which is used to compute the ratio α2βδ2/α2βεδ.

The fraction of α2βεδ receptors is computed as twice Fraction A and used to compute the ratio α2βδ2/α2βεδ. Finally, we applied two rounds of energy minimization using the program CHARMM (19Brooks B.R. Bruccoleri R.E. Olafson B.D. States D.J. Swaminathan S. Karplus M.J. Comp. Chem. 1983; 4: 187-217Crossref Scopus (13967) Google Scholar), version 27b4. The first round constrained the coordinates of all heavy atoms while allowing movement of hydrogens. The second round constrained the protein main chain while allowing movement of side chains. The final structure was selected based on evaluations using PROCHECK and PROFILES 3-D. We mutated individual residues to lysine along a putative β strand from positions 49 through 61 of the ε subunit from adult human muscle AChR. Each lysine mutation was co-transfected with complementary α, β, and δ subunit cDNAs in 293 HEK cells, followed by quantitation of cell surface receptors using the AChR-specific ligand 125I-α-bgt. The results reveal a pattern of high expression alternating with low expression as lysine is advanced along the protein chain (Fig.1 a). High expression for odd numbered residues approaches that for wild type AChR, whereas low expression for even numbered residues approaches that for subunit-omitted α2βδ2 receptors. High expression likely results from mutant ε subunits that fold and incorporate into pentameric AChRs, whereas low expression likely results from misfolding of the mutant ε subunits, leading to subunit-omitted α2βδ2 receptors (12Ohno K. Wang H.-L. Milone M. Bren N. Brengman J.M. Nakano S. Quiram P. Pruitt J.N. Sine S.M. Engel A.G.

Invest. 1999; 104: 1403-1410Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). These results provide strong evidence that residues 49 through 61 in the AChR ε subunit form a β strand. Alternatively, lysine mutations at even numbered positions may produce a subunit that can assemble with complementary subunits, but the mutations reduce the efficiency of receptor assembly. To distinguish between omission of the ε subunit and inefficient assembly, we took advantage of the observation that ligand binding properties of the receptor depend on subunit composition (12Ohno K. Wang H.-L. Milone M. Bren N. Brengman J.M. Nakano S. Quiram P. Pruitt J.N. Sine S.M. Engel A.G.

Thus for each mutation, we measured binding of ACh and α-conotoxin GI (CTx GI) by competition against the initial rate of 125I-α-bgt binding. Receptors containing the ε subunit (α2βεδ) show a monophasic competition curve for the agonist ACh, whereas receptors lacking the ε subunit (α2βδ2) show a distinctive biphasic curve with a plateau at half occupancy extending over three orders of magnitude in ACh concentration (12Ohno K. Wang H.-L. Milone M. Bren N. Brengman J.M. Nakano S. Quiram P. Pruitt J.N. Sine S.M. Engel A.G.

Analogous results are obtained with the competitive antagonist CTx GI, where α2βεδ receptors show a competition curve with two closely spaced components, whereas subunit-omitted receptors show a high affinity component accompanied by a plateau extending over nearly three orders of magnitude of CTx GI concentration. Thus competition profiles for ACh and CTx GI clearly distinguish receptors containing the ε subunit from those with the composition α2βδ2. For the odd numbered lysine mutations, both ACh and CTx GI fully compete against binding of the reporter ligand 125I-α-bgt (Fig. 1 b). Quantitative differences in the competition profiles are observed among the various mutations, because residues in this region contribute to the ligand binding site (23Bren N. Sine S. J. Biol.

By contrast, lysine mutations at even numbered positions lead to biphasic profiles characteristic of subunit-omitted α2βδ2 receptors (Fig. 1 b). Together with the alternating pattern of high and low expression, these results indicate that lysine mutations at odd numbered positions permit incorporation of ε subunits into pentameric AChRs, whereas lysine mutations at even numbered positions lead to ε subunits unable to incorporate into pentamers. For even numbered lysine mutations in strand β2, all but one show a plateau in the competition curve corresponding to ∼50% of the binding sites, as observed for subunit-omitted α2βδ2 receptors. However, for the εI56K mutation, the plateau corresponded to 28% of the binding sites (Fig.1 b). Because a plateau of 50% corresponds to 100% α2βδ2 receptors, a plateau of 28% indicates 56% α2βδ2 and 44% containing the mutant ε subunit (i.e. α2βδεI56K). Co-expression of the εI56K mutant yields total expression of α-bgt binding sites of 25% of control, of which only 11% contain the mutant ε subunit. The reduced expression, together with the reduced plateau in the competition measurements, mirrors observations for a disease-causing mutation in the human ε subunit (12Ohno K. Wang H.-L. Milone M.

However, B. subtilis contains several chemotaxis genes not found in the E. coli genome, such as cheC and cheD, indicating that theB. subtilis chemotactic system is more complex. In B. subtilis, CheD is required for chemotaxis; the cheDmutant displays a tumbly phenotype, has abnormally methylated chemoreceptors, and responds poorly to most chemical stimuli. Homologs of B. subtilis CheD have been found in chemotaxis-like operons of a large number of bacteria and archaea, suggesting that CheD plays an important role in chemotactic sensory transduction for many organisms. However, the molecular function of CheD has remained unknown. In this study, we show that CheD catalyzes amide hydrolysis of specific glutaminyl side chains of the B. subtilis chemoreceptor McpA. In addition, we present evidence that CheD deamidates other B. subtilis chemoreceptors including McpB and McpC. Previously, deamidation of B. subtilis receptors was thought to be catalyzed by the CheB methylesterase, as is the case for E. coli receptors. Because cheD mutant cells do not respond to most chemoattractants, we conclude that deamidation by CheD is required forB. subtilis chemoreceptors to effectively transduce signals to the CheA kinase.

In Escherichia coli, transmembrane chemoreceptors are coupled by CheW to the CheA kinase to elevate phosphoryl group flux through the system during the excitation response to repellent stimuli (3Hess J.F.

The chemoreceptors are covalently modified by methylesterification of Glu side chains (8Springer W.R. Koshland D.E., Jr. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 533-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Modulation of the net methylation level of the receptors provides a simple chemical “memory,” allowing responses to continuously changing concentration gradients (9Blair D.F. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1995; 49: 489-522Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Receptor methylation levels are dynamically controlled through the action of two modification enzymes, a methyltransferase, CheR, and a methylesterase, CheB. CheR methylesterifies specific Glu side chains on receptors usingS-adenosylmethionine as a methyl donor (8Springer W.R. Koshland D.E., Jr. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 533-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar); CheB catalyzes the hydrolysis of these glutamyl methyl esters, releasing methanol and regenerating a Glu (10Stock J.B. Koshland D.E., Jr. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1978; 75: 3659-3663Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). CheR and CheB are the only known chemoreceptor modification enzymes. Chemoreceptor modification occurs at specific, cytoplasmic Glu residues located within a well defined consensus sequence originally determined using methylated receptors derived from E. coli (11Le Moual H. Koshland D.E., Jr. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 261: 568-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 12Terwilliger T.C. Wang J.Y. Koshland D.E., Jr. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 10814-10820Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This consensus sequence has been successfully used to identify methylation sites on receptors of the distantly related organismBacillus subtilis (13Zimmer M.A. Tiu J. Collins M.A. Ordal G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24264-24272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 14Hanlon D.W. Ordal G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14038-14046Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The consensus exhibits some slight variability; receptors are often, but not exclusively, synthesized with Glu at the site of modification. In some instances, the modified site is encoded as Gln rather than Glu in the corresponding receptor gene. When this situation occurs on an E. coli receptor, the CheB methylesterase first acts as a deamidase; amide hydrolysis of Gln residues produces Glu at the corresponding position in the mature protein. These Glu residues are then subject to cycles of reversible methylation (15Kehry M.R. Bond M.W. Hunkapiller M.W. Dahlquist F.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 3599-3603Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Because the B. subtilis methylesterase complemented an E. coli cheB strain in swarm assays (16Kirsch M.L. Peters P.D. Hanlon D.W. Kirby J.R. Ordal G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 18610-18616Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), it has been assumed that the B. subtilis methylesterase possesses an equivalent glutaminase activity. Modification (methylation, demethylation, or deamidation) of theE. coli chemoreceptors has substantial effects on the electrophoretic mobility of the molecules during SDS-PAGE. Incorporation of methyl groups via CheR causes the receptor to migrate more rapidly through the acrylamide matrix (or at a lower apparentM r), whereas demethylation or deamidation via CheB causes the receptor to migrate more slowly through the acrylamide matrix (or at a higher apparent M r) (15Kehry M.R.

Cell. 1982; 29: 761-772Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). B. subtilis utilizes a similar complement of proteins for chemotaxis, including homologs of the transmembrane chemoreceptors, CheW coupler, CheA kinase, CheY regulator, and CheR/CheB receptor-modification enzymes (21Kirby J.R. Kristich C.J. Saulmon M.M. Zimmer M.A. Garrity L.F. Zhulin I.B. Ordal G.W. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 42: 573-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 22Garrity L.G. Ordal G.W. Pharmacol. Ther. 1995; 68: 87-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). However, chemotaxis by B. subtilis deviates from the E. coli paradigm in many ways. For example, B. subtilis lacks a homolog of the CheZ phosphatase present in E. coli and other closely related γ-proteobacteria. Moreover, B. subtilis possesses several chemotaxis genes that have no counterparts in E. coli, including cheC, cheD, and cheV.The roles of CheC, CheD, and CheV in B. subtilis chemotaxis have not been well characterized. Recent work suggests roles for CheV and CheC during adaptation to chemotactic stimuli (21Kirby J.R. Kristich C.J. Saulmon M.M. Zimmer M.A. Garrity L.F. Zhulin I.B. Ordal G.W. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 42: 573-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 23Karatan E. Saulmon M.M. Bunn M.W. Ordal G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 43618-43626Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), although their mechanism of action remains elusive; less is known about the function of CheD. cheD mutant cells exhibit poorly methylated receptors, clockwise flagellar rotational bias (cells are tumbly), and decreased sensitivity to attractants (21Kirby J.R. Kristich C.J. Saulmon M.M. Zimmer M.A. Garrity L.F. Zhulin I.B. Ordal G.W. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 42: 573-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 24Rosario M.M.R. Kirby J.R. Bochar D.A. Ordal G.W. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 3823-3831Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Additionally, a recent report noted the unexpected observation that oneB. subtilis chemoreceptor, McpA, appeared to be absent in acheD mutant (21Kirby J.R. Kristich C.J. Saulmon M.M. Zimmer M.A. Garrity L.F. Zhulin I.B. Ordal G.W. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 42: 573-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). No link connecting these disparate phenotypes has been established. The apparent nonspecific nature of the chemotactic defects of the cheD mutant has precluded assignment of a specific biochemical function to CheD. Furthermore, its function cannot be inferred from sequence comparisons because all CheD homologs in the publicly available data base are putative proteins for which no function has been described. Although CheD function has remained a mystery, the discovery of CheD homologs within chemotaxis-like operons of a large number of bacterial and archaeal species (21Kirby J.R. Kristich C.J. Saulmon M.M. Zimmer M.A. Garrity L.F. Zhulin I.B. Ordal G.W. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 42: 573-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) suggests that CheD plays an important role in chemoreceptor-mediated sensory transduction for many organisms. This report presents the first evidence identifying a specific molecular function for the CheD protein. We demonstrate that B. subtilis CheD catalyzes amide hydrolysis of specific glutaminyl side chains of the B. subtilis chemoreceptor McpA. CheD can thus be classified as a chemoreceptor glutamine deamidase (E.C. 3.5.1.44). Because the cheD mutant exhibits a considerable clockwise prestimulus flagellar rotational bias (similar to a B. subtilis CheA null mutant) and cheD cells do not respond to most chemoattractants, we conclude that CheD-mediated receptor deamidation is required for productive communication of the conformational signals of the receptors to the CheA kinase. Bacterial strains and plasmids used in this study are listed in TableI. DNA manipulations were performed according to standard protocols. Plasmids pAIN750mcpA and pAIN750mcpC were constructed by first amplifying the corresponding mcp gene and its promoter from B. subtilis chromosomal DNA via PCR using Pfu polymerase (Stratagene). The amplification products were cloned into pAIN750 using primer-encoded EcoRI and BamHI restriction sites for mcpA orEcoRI and NotI restriction sites formcpC. Site-specific mutations in mcpA were created as described (13Zimmer M.A. Tiu J. Collins M.A. Ordal G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24264-24272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) using pAIN750mcpA as template. For use in an independent line of investigation, both pAIN750mcpA and pAIN750mcpC had aBglII restriction site incorporated into the region coding for the receptor c-terminal domain using a previously described method (13Zimmer M.A. Tiu J.

These nucleotide sequence alterations were phenotypically “silent”; that is, they did not result in any change of the amino acid sequence of the receptors.Table IStrains and plasmids used in this studyStrain or plasmidRelevant genotype or descriptionReferenceOI2836 cheB8∷cat16Kirsch M.L.

The amplification primers encoded BamHI sites and were designed to generate an in-frame N-terminal His-tagged fusion of the entire McpA cytoplasmic sequence beginning with McpA Arg-303. A second plasmid designed to co-express cheD with the c-fragment (pAIN153) was constructed via a multistep process as follows. Because the wild-type ribosome binding site (RBS) for cheD is a poor match for the B. subtilis consensus RBS (25Mountain A. Harwood C.R. Bacillus. Plenum Publishing Corp., New York1989: 73-114Crossref Google Scholar), resulting in low expression levels, site-specific mutations were introduced into pWN5 as described (13Zimmer M.A. Tiu J.

This procedure concomitantly introduced an adjacent HindIII site. The 0.8-kbHindIII/EcoRI fragment of pAIN150 containingcheD, and its RBS was subcloned into theHindIII/EcoRI sites of pSK, generating pAIN151. A 1.2-kb EcoRI/NotI fragment of pAIN620 containing the gene for the c-fragment, and its RBS was subcloned into theEcoRI/NotI sites of pAIN151, generating pAIN152.

C-fragments were purified under denaturing conditions using nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid agarose (Qiagen), essentially according to the manufacturer's instructions. A 1-liter culture of LB plus antibiotic (10 μg/ml chloramphenicol or 100 μg/ml ampicillin) was inoculated 1:100 with an overnight culture of RP3098 harboring pAIN620 (for the unmodified c-fragment) or pAIN153 (for the CheD-modified c-fragment) and grown at 37 °C with agitation (250 rpm) to an A 600 of 0.8. IPTG was added to 1 mm; incubation was continued as before, and cells were harvested by centrifugation (5000 ×g, 5 min) after 3 h. Cell pellets were frozen at −70 °C. Thawed cell pellets were resuspended in Buffer B (8m urea, 0.1 m NaH2PO4, 0.01 m Tris, pH 8) and incubated at room temperature for 1 h with mixing. The supernatants were clarified by two serial centrifugations (5000 × g, 5 min; 20,000 ×g, 40 min) and incubated with nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid agarose resin (pre-equilibrated in Buffer B) at room temperature for 1 h with mixing. The resin was batch-washed twice with Buffer B and twice with Buffer C (Buffer B with pH adjusted to 6.3) and then applied to a gravity flow column and washed with 10 column volumes of Buffer C. Elution was performed in 20 ml of Buffer E (Buffer B with pH adjusted to 4.5). The eluates were concentrated to ∼1 ml using a cellulose ultrafiltration membrane (Millipore) in an Amicon ultrafiltration cell. These samples were dialyzed against three changes of 25 mm NH4HCO3 at 4 °C, and aliquots were frozen at −70 °C. For purification of glutathione S-transferase-CheD fusion protein (GST-CheD), a saturated overnight culture of pGXOB was diluted 1:100 into 1 liter of LB plus 100 μg/ml ampicillin and grown at 37 °C (250 rpm) to A 600 of 0.8. IPTG was added to 1 mm, and the culture was incubated (200 rpm) overnight at room temperature. Cells were pelleted and frozen as above. Thawed cell pellets were resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline (150 mm NaCl, 16 mm Na2HPO4, 4 mm NaH2PO4, pH 7.3) and disrupted by sonication. The supernatant was clarified as above and applied to a 2-ml gravity flow glutathione-Sepharose 4B column (AmershamBiosciences). The column was washed with 15 column volumes of phosphate-buffered saline, and elution was performed using 10 ml of elution buffer (50 mm Tris, 5 mm glutathione, pH 8). The eluate was concentrated as above. The sample was dialyzed against three changes of 50 mm Tris (pH 8), 10% glycerol at 4 °C, and aliquots were frozen at −70 °C.

At the indicated times, samples (10 μl) were removed and mixed with 10 μl of 2× SDS loading buffer. Immunoblotting was performed as described above. CNBr digestion was performed essentially as described (29Sun Y. Bauer M.D. Keough T.W. Lacey M.P. Chapman J.R. Protein and Peptide Analysis by Mass Spectrometry. Humana Press, New Jersey1996: 185-210Google Scholar). Aliquots of purified c-fragments (0.5–1 nmol) were dried under vacuum using a SpeedVac and resuspended in 0.1m HCl. A small, unweighed crystal of CNBr was added; the reaction was vortexed to dissolve the crystal and incubated overnight at room temperature in the dark. 4 volumes of water were added, and the reaction was dried as before. Cleavage products were resuspended in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. Peptide separation and automated Edman degradation were performed at the UIUC Protein Sciences Facility. Electrophoretic mobility of a B. subtilis chemoreceptor is dependent on the cheD gene product—Previous work to characterize several B. subtilis chemoreceptors demonstrated that themcpB gene product fractionated near its expectedM r (71,800) during SDS-PAGE (14Hanlon D.W. Ordal G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14038-14046Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Despite being encoded with a nearly identical M r as McpB, themcpA gene product (Mr-72,400) fractionated as several distinct bands at a significantly higher apparentM r (∼95,000). Recently, however, immunoblot analysis revealed the unexpected absence of McpA-specific cross-reacting material in the lysate of a cheD mutant (21Kirby J.R. Kristich C.J. Saulmon M.M. Zimmer M.A. Garrity L.F. Zhulin I.B. Ordal G.W. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 42: 573-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). In an attempt to elucidate the biochemical role of the cheDgene product, we investigated the apparent absence of McpA. One possibility to explain the absence of McpA is that the synthesis or stability of McpA is impaired in the cheD mutant. We found this possibility unlikely since two other B. subtilisreceptors (McpB and McpC) were detected at wild-type levels in thecheD lysate (21Kirby J.R. Kristich C.J. Saulmon M.M. Zimmer M.A. Garrity L.F. Zhulin I.B. Ordal G.W. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 42: 573-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). However, the antibody used for detection of McpA also cross-reacts with McpB (21Kirby J.R. Kristich C.J. Saulmon M.M. Zimmer M.A. Garrity L.F. Zhulin I.B. Ordal G.W. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 42: 573-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar); therefore, if McpA and McpB co-fractionated, they would be indistinguishable. We hypothesized that the cheD mutation affected the electrophoretic mobility of McpA such that it co-fractionated with McpB. To test this hypothesis, we expressed a single receptor gene (mcpA ormcpB) in two backgrounds containing mutations in the 10 known receptor genes (Δ10mcp); one wasche +, and the other was a cheD mutant derivative. We assessed the electrophoretic mobility of each receptor during SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1). McpB exhibited no mobility changes due to the cheD mutation under these conditions (not shown, but see below). In contrast, McpA displayed a substantial difference in mobility due to the cheD mutation (Fig. 1, compare lanes 1 and 2). ThecheD mutation resulted in an McpA protein that did not fractionate as several bands at the previously described relatively high apparent M r; instead, it fractionated as a single band closer to its expected M r. Thus, CheD is required for an electrophoretic mobility shift of McpA to a higher apparent M r. Chemoreceptors of E. coli are known to undergo electrophoretic mobility shifts due to changes in the extent of their modification (methylation, demethylation, or deamidation) catalyzed by the CheR methyltransferase and the CheB methylesterase (17Boyd A. Simon M.I. J. Bacteriol. 1980; 143: 809-815Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Chelsky D. Dahlquist F.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 2434-2438Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). To test the possibility that CheD-dependent mobility shifts of McpA were due to analogous changes in the level of its modification catalyzed by the B. subtilis methyltransferase or methylesterase, we expressed mcpA in Δ10mcpstrains harboring cheR (methyltransferase) or cheR cheB (methyltransferase and methylesterase) mutations. Immunoblot analysis of McpA reveals that the mobility shift to a higher apparentM r occurs normally in both backgrounds and is dependent on CheD (Fig. 1, compare lanes 3–5). Thus, neither of the two enzymes shown previously to modify bacterial chemoreceptors is required for the CheD-dependent mobility shift of McpA to a higher apparent M r, implying that CheD is itself involved in chemoreceptor modification. Although neither of the two previously known chemoreceptor modification enzymes is required for the CheD-dependent mobility shift of McpA, it is apparent from Fig. 1 that methylation of McpA substantially affects its mobility independently of the CheD-dependent modification. Unmethylated McpA (derived from the cheR host) fractionates as a single band of a relatively high apparent M r (lanes 3and 5), whereas the presence of CheR results in several forms of McpA that fractionate at a lower apparentM r (lane 1), presumably as a result of methylation at one or more methylatable sites. Under these conditions, we were able to resolve a total of four bands in the wild-type background (lane 1); the two bands of intermediateM r appear to “smear” together, but shorter exposures of the same blot clearly reveal distinct bands (not shown). In addition, the presence of CheR also causes McpA to fractionate at a lower apparent M r in the absence of CheD, again presumably as a result of methylation (compare lanes 2 and4). This effect of methylation on chemoreceptor mobility has been well documented for chemoreceptors of E. coli (17Boyd A. Simon M.I. J. Bacteriol. 1980; 143: 809-815Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Chelsky D. Dahlquist F.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 1994; 269: 14038-14046Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) that the mcpA gene product accounts for several distinct methylated bands in extracts of wild-type B. subtilis. In contrast to the effect of methylation on chemoreceptor mobility, E. colireceptors that are deamidated migrate more slowly through acrylamide gels (19Rollins C. Dahlquist F.W. Cell. 1981; 25: 333-340Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 20Kehry M.R. Dahlquist F.W. Cell. 1982; 29: 761-772Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar).

CD44-mediated binding to hyaluronan is of low affinity, and effective cell/matrix interaction depends on multiple interactions with the multivalent ligand. We replaced the Link module of CD44 with the homologous region of TSG-6, a hyaluronan-binding protein secreted in response to inflammation whose Link module has a higher affinity for ligand. Monoclonal antibodies raised against the CD44/TSG-6 chimera recognized recombinant human TSG-6 and native mouse TSG-6 and blocked hyaluronan binding to these proteins. Cells expressing the CD44/TSG-6 molecule bound hyaluronan with higher avidity than cells expressing CD44. This resulted in changes in the hyaluronan binding properties characteristic of cells expressing CD44 such as requirements for threshold levels of receptor expression and for hyaluronan of high molecular mass. In parallel plate flow assays used to model leukocyte rolling, cells expressing CD44/TSG-6 failed to roll on hyaluronan. Instead, they stuck and remained “tethered” to the substrate under fluid flow. This result argues that the low affinity of CD44 for its ligand is important for rolling, an early phase of leukocyte extravasation from the blood.

In this case, the Link module forms an independently folded domain that can support HA binding without the need for additional flanking sequences (24Day, A. J.

Here, we constructed a chimera in which the Link module of CD44 was replaced with the Link module of TSG-6 to determine how a change in HA affinity might affect cell functions involving CD44-dependent HA binding. As expected, cells expressing the chimeric CD44/TSG-6 molecule bound soluble HA more avidly than cells expressing CD44. These cells differed in several properties that are characteristic of CD44-mediated HA binding such as the necessity for “threshold” levels of receptor and a requirement for high molecular mass HA. In addition, cells expressing the CD44/TSG-6 chimera failed to roll on a HA substrate under conditions of flow, illustrating the importance of multiple low affinity interactions between adhesion receptors and their ligands to promote the transient cell adhesion/dissociation events characteristic of rolling.

Wik K.O. Carbohydr. Res. 1975; 44: 251-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Cell-surface binding of fluorescein-conjugated HA (FL-HA) was determined by flow cytometry (47Lesley J. Kincade P. Hyman R. Eur. J. Immunol. 1993; 23: 1902-1909Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). HA oligosaccharides HA4, HA6, HA8, HA10, HA12, HA14, and HA16 were made as described (48Mahoney D.J. Alpin R.T. Calabro A. Hascall V.C. Day A.J. Glycobiology. 2001; 11: 1025-1033Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). All of these oligosaccharides were homogeneous with regard to chain length.

Nature. 1978; 276: 269-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (1084) Google Scholar) with spleen cells from Sprague-Dawley rats immunized against CD44-negative mouse cell lines transfected with the CD44/TSG-6 chimera. TSG-6-specific hybridomas were selected by screening supernatants by flow cytometry for binding to CD44/TSG-6-transfected cell lines and for lack of binding to cell lines expressing wild-type CD44 and to CD44-negative cell lines. Monoclonal antibodies A6, A38, and A68 are from an immunization with a CTLL-2 cell line expressing the CD44/TSG-6 chimera, and mAb Q75 is from an immunization with the XJ(3)/cell line CD44−expressing the CD44/TSG-6 chimera. Immunoblotting of cell lysates was done as described previously (51Perschl A. Lesley J. English N. Hyman R. Trowbridge I. J.

A polyclonal antibody against the cytoplasmic domain of CD44 was provided by James McCarthy (University of Minnesota) and was used in combination with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit immunoglobulin. Link_TSG6 and mutants with single amino acid substitutions (with His4 of Link_TSG6 replaced with lysine designated as H4K, etc.) have been described (34Mahoney D.J. Blundell C.D. Day A.J. J. Biol.

Briefly, recombinant human TSG-6 was coated onto a microtiter plate at 0.3 μg/ml; FL-HA and medium or supernatants of A38 and Q75 were added; and HA binding was detected with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated rabbit antibody specific for fluorescein. Cell rolling on HA was analyzed using a parallel flow chamber system (GlycoTech, Rockville, MD). Plastic Petri dishes, previously coated with high molecular mass HA (0.2 mg/ml) and blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin, constituted the bottom of the chamber. All flow experiments were carried out using serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium kept at 37 °C. Cells were introduced into the chamber at a low fluid shear force (0.25 dynes/cm2) using an automated syringe pump (Harvard Apparatus, Holliston, MA). At any given flow path width and syringe diameter, the fluid shear force was proportional to the flow rate (12Lawrence M.B. Springer T.A. Cell. 1991; 65: 859-873Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1882) Google Scholar,16Clark R.A. Alon R. Springer T.A. J.

Med. 1996; 183: 1119-1130Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar); therefore, flow rates were programmed to achieve shear forces ranging from 0.25 to 20 dynes/cm2. Movement of the cells under flow was captured by streamline acquisition of images through a cooled CCD camera (RS Photometrics, Trenton, NJ) attached to a Nikon Diaphot inverted microscope and recorded for 120 s using a Metaview image analysis system (Universal Imaging Corp., West Chester, PA). Cell movement (at least 250 cells/experiment) was analyzed by playback of digital images employing the object measurement options of the Metaview program. To illustrate the relative distances covered by the cells during the entire recording period, the cells in the first image (starting position) were color-coded with red, and in the last image (ending position) with green. Overlay of the two images produced red and green (for rolling cells that covered distances greater than a cell diameter), red only (cells that detached under flow), or yellow (cells that remained attached, but did not roll). In Fig.1, the HA-binding domain of CD44 is represented schematically and compared with the same region of the chimera, designated as CD44/TSG-6, in which the Link module of CD44 has been replaced by the Link module of TSG-6. The approximate locations of amino acid residues required for HA binding in both Link module domains are represented by closed and open circles (see Refs. 22Bajorath J. Greenfield B. Munro S.B.

Four amino acid residues C-terminal and one residue N-terminal to the Link module have also been implicated in binding (23Peach R. Hollenbaugh D. Stamenkovic I. Aruffo A. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 257-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). N-Linked glycosylation sites of CD44, previously shown to be involved in the regulation of HA binding (37English N.

Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 431-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar), are indicated by N1–N5. In the CD44/TSG-6 chimera, the four CD44 N-glycosylation sites that are in the Link domain (N2–N5) are eliminated. Only one glycosylation site is present in the TSG-6 Link module at a sequence that is close to the N4 site in CD44. Several CD44-negative cell lines were transfected with cDNA encoding the CD44/TSG-6 chimera. The AKR1 cell line is a CD44-negative T lymphoma that binds HA constitutively when transfected with wild-type CD44 (59Lesley J., He, Q. Miyake K. Hamann A. Hyman R. Kincade P. J. Exp. Med. 1992; 175: 257-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). CTLL-2 is a CD44-negative cytotoxic T cell line that also binds HA constitutively when transfected with CD44 (39Kim J.H. Glant T.T. Lesley J. Hyman R. Mikecz K. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 256: 445-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). XJ(3)/CD44− is a CD44-negative variant of a pre-B cell line that, when transfected with wild-type CD44, shows an “inducible” HA binding phenotype (37English N. Lesley J. Hyman R. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 3736-3742PubMed Google Scholar). Wild-type CD44+transfectants of this cell line do not bind HA constitutively, but can be induced to bind by certain CD44-specific inducing mAbs. Transfectants were identified in flow cytometry by binding of FL-IM7, a CD44-specific mAb whose binding depends on CD44 Pro125, which is C-terminal to the chimeric Link module (see Fig. 1 and Ref.60Zheng Z. Katoh S., He, Q. Oritani K. Miyake K. Lesley J. Hyman R. Hamik A. Parkhouse R. Farr A. Kincade P. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 485-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). To eliminate cells spontaneously expressing endogenous CD44, IM7-positive lines were also screened for failure to bind KM81, a mAb that recognizes residues within the CD44 Link module (60Zheng Z. Katoh S., He, Q. Oritani K. Miyake K. Lesley J. Hyman R. Hamik A. Parkhouse R. Farr A. Kincade P. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 485-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Transfectants expressing the chimera were cloned, and several positive clones from each line were assayed for binding of FL-HA and FL-IM7. Fig. 2 shows the accumulated results of numerous assays on three sets of transfectants with the CD44/TSG-6 chimera: transfectants expressed in AKR1 (closed squares), CTLL-2 (open circles), and XJ(3)/CD44−(open triangles) cells. For comparison, parallel assays were done on clones of AKR1 cells transfected with wild-type CD44 (closed circles). HA binding and expression of the transfected constructs were determined by flow cytometry using FL-HA and FL-IM7, respectively. As we have shown previously (36Perschl A. Lesley J. English N. Trowbridge I. Hyman R. Eur. J. Immunol. 1995; 25: 495-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 37English N. Lesley J. Hyman R. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 3736-3742PubMed Google Scholar), cells expressing wild-type CD44 did not exhibit detectable binding of FL-HA until a certain threshold level of CD44 expression was reached, in this case ∼20 times background levels (determined using unlabeled cells and untransfected AKR1 cells). In contrast, AKR1 and CTLL-2 cells expressing the CD44/TSG-6 chimera (closed squares and open circles, respectively) showed significant FL-HA binding at the lowest amounts of CD44/TSG-6 expression detected with FL-IM7. Transfectants of the inducible cell line XJ(3)/CD44− with the chimera bound FL-HA constitutively. Although the XJ(3)/CD44− cells transfected with the chimera bound less FL-HA than AKR1 and CTLL-2 cells with comparable levels of chimera expression, they bound"

We have generated cell lines with inducible expression of BRCA1 as a tool to identify downstream targets that may be important mediators of BRCA1 function. Oligonucleotide array-based expression profiling identified 11 previously described interferon regulated genes that were up-regulated following inducible expression of BRCA1. Northern blot analysis revealed that a subset of the identified targets including IRF-7, MxA, and ISG-54 were synergistically up-regulated by BRCA1 in the presence of interferon γ (IFN-γ) but not interferons α or β. Importantly, IFN-γ-mediated induction of IRF-7 and MxA was attenuated in the BRCA1 mutant cell line HCC1937, an effect that was rescued following reconstitution of exogenous wild type BRCA1 in these cells. Furthermore, reconstituted BRCA1 sensitized HCC1937 cells to IFN-γ-induced apoptotic cell death. This study identifies BRCA1 as a component of the IFN-γ-regulated signaling pathway and suggests that BRCA1 may play a role in the regulation of IFN-γ-mediated apoptosis.

Swensen J. Shattuck-Eidens D. Futreal P.A. Harshman K. Tavtigian S. Liu Q. Cochran C. Bennett L.M. Ding W. Science. 1993; 266: 66-71Crossref Scopus (5330) Google Scholar). Germline mutations of BRCA1 are found in half of breast-ovarian cancer pedigrees and in ∼10% of women with early onset breast cancer, irrespective of family history (2Fitzgerald M. MacDonald D. Krainer M. Hoover I. O'Neill E. Unsal H. Silva-Arrieto S. Finkelstein D. Beer-Romero P. Englert C. Sgroi D. Smith B. Younger J.W. Garber J. Duda R. Mayzel K. Isselbacher K. Friend S. Haber D.A. N. Engl. J. Med. 1996; 334: 143-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). BRCA1 has been implicated in a number of important cellular functions including DNA damage repair, transcriptional regulation, cell cycle control, and, more recently, ubiquitination (3Kerr P. Ashworth A. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: R668-R676Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). The exact mechanism through which BRCA1 inactivation may lead to malignant transformation, however, remains to be defined. A large body of evidence has accumulated over the last few years demonstrating a role for BRCA1 in DNA damage repair and in particular repair of double-strand breaks. It was initially observed that BRCA1 co-localized in nuclear foci during the S phase with RAD51 (4Scully R. Chen J. Plug A. Xiao Y. Weaver D. Feunteun J. Ashley T. Livingston D.M. Cell. 1997; 88: 265-275Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1328) Google Scholar), the mammalian homologue of bacterial recA, which is involved in homologous recombination and the repair of double-strand breaks in DNA following ionizing radiation. Subsequently, it has been shown that BRCA1 is also a component of the RAD50-MRE11-NBS1 complex implicated in homologous recombination and nonhomologous end joining in response to DNA damage (5Zhong Q. Chen C.F., Li S Chen Y Wang C.C. Xiao J. Chen P.L Sharp Z.D. Lee W.H. Science. 1999; 285: 747-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar). Consistent with a potential role in the repair of double-strand breaks, treatment of cultured cells with ionizing radiation leads to BRCA1 hyperphosphorylation, an effect that is mediated in part by the ATM (6Cortez D. Wang Y. Qin J. Elledge S.J. Science. 1999; 286: 1162-1166Crossref PubMed Scopus (873) Google Scholar) and CHIT2 kinases (7Lee J.S. Collins K.M. Brown A.L. Lee C.H. Chung J.H. Nature. 2000; 404: 201-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar). Genetic studies support a role for BRCA1 in the repair of double-strand breaks. Significantly, embryonic stem (ES) cells from BRCA1 knockout mice exhibit a defect in the repair of double-strand breaks by homologous recombination (8Moynahan M.E. Chiu J.W. Koller B.H. Jasin M. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 511-518Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1024) Google Scholar). Recently it has been reported that BRCA1 can bind to single-strand DNA in a non-sequence-specific manner with a high affinity for branched DNA structures (9Paull T.T. Cortez D. Bowers B. Elledge S.J. Gellert M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 6086-6091Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). This has lead to the suggestion that BRCA1 is actively recruited to the sites of stalled replication forks following DNA damage where it can then recruit various proteins implicated in the repair of damaged DNA. A role for BRCA1 in cell cycle checkpoint control has also been suggested following the observation that BRCA1 becomes hyperphosphorylated during the late G1 and S phases and transiently dephosphorylated early after the M phase (10Ruffner H. Verma I.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 7138-7143Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Furthermore, overexpression of BRCA1 induces a G1/S arrest in human colon cancer cells (11Somasundaram K. Zhang H. Zeng Y.X. Houvras Y. Peng Y. Zhang H., Wu, G.S. Licht J.D. Weber B.L El-Deiry W.S. Nature. 1997; 389: 187-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar), and genetic instability has been observed in BRCA1 exon 11 isoform-deficient cells resulting from a defective G2/M checkpoint and centrosome amplification (12Xu X. Weaver Z. Linke S.P., Li, C. Gotay J. Wang X.W. Harris C.C. Ried T. Deng C.X. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 389-395Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (703) Google Scholar). We have recently reported that inducible expression of BRCA1 can activate both the G2 and mitotic checkpoints following treatment with taxol, suggesting a specific role for BRCA1 in the regulation of the G2/M checkpoint following disruption of the mitotic spindle (13Mullan P.B. Quinn J.E. Gilmore P.M. McWilliams S. Andrews H. Gervin C. McCabe N. McKenna S. White P. Song Y-H. Maheswaran S. Liu E. Haber D.A. Johnston P.G. Harkin D.P. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 6123-6131Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Evidence has also accumulated over the last few years supporting a role for BRCA1 in transcriptional regulation. The C-terminal domain of BRCA1 is highly acidic and has been shown to mediate transcriptional activation when fused to a heterologous DNA-binding domain (14Chapman M.S. Verma I.M. Nature. 1996; 382: 678-679Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar, 15Monteiro A.N.A. August A. Hanafusa H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 13595-13599Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar). Furthermore, BRCA1 co-purifies with RNA polymerase II holoenzyme complex through an association with RNA helicase A (16Scully R. Anderson S.F. Chao D.M. Wei W., Ye, L. Young R.A. Livingston D.M. Parvin J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 5605-5610Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar, 17Anderson S.F. Schlegel B.P. Nakajima T. Wolpin E.S. Parvin J.D. Nat. Genet. 1998; 19: 254-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar), suggesting that BRCA1 is a component of the core transcriptional machinery. A number of other reports have demonstrated that BRCA1 associates with a range of different transcription factors including p53, c-Myc, ATF1, and STAT1 and modulates their activity (18Ouchi T.

Consistent with a role in transcriptional regulation, we and others have identified a number of genes that are up-regulated following overexpression of exogenous BRCA1, including the stress- and DNA damage-inducible GADD45 gene (22Harkin D.P. Bean J.M. Miklos D. Song Y.-H. Truong V.B. Englert C. Christians F.C. Ellisen L.W. Maheswaran S. Oliner J.D. Haber D.A.

These findings suggest that BRCA1 functions as either a co-activator or co-repressor of transcription, an effect that may involve its ability to recruit both the basal transcription machinery and proteins implicated in chromatin remodeling including the histone deacetylases HDAC1 and HDAC2 and the SWI/SNF-related chromatin-remodeling complex (24Yarden R.I. Brody L.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4983-4988Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar, 25Bochar D.A. Wang L. Beniya H. Kinev A. Xue Y. Lane W.S. Wang W. Kashanchi F.

In this study we report the identification by microarray-based expression profiling of a novel subset of BRCA1 target genes, (IRF-7, MxA, and ISG-54) that are synergistically up-regulated following inducible expression of BRCA1 in the presence of IFN-γ.1 Also we demonstrate that BRCA1 is required for IFN-γ-mediated induction of IRF-7 and MxA and show that BRCA1 sensitizes breast cancer cell lines to IFN-γ-mediated apoptosis. Taken together these data therefore suggest that BRCA1 may be an important component of the IFN-γ-regulated antiproliferative response. MBR62-bcl2 cells were grown as described previously (13Mullan P.B. Quinn J.E. Gilmore P.M. McWilliams S. Andrews H. Gervin C. McCabe N. McKenna S. White P. Song Y-H. Maheswaran S. Liu E. Haber D.A.

To measure the inhibition of cellular proliferation, equal numbers of MBR62-bcl2 cells were split into 24-well plates and uninduced or induced to express BRCA1 in the presence or absence of IFN-α (500 units/ml), IFN-β (500 units/ml), or IFN-γ (500 units/ml). The cell counts were carried out on a daily basis using a Coulter counter (Coulter Z2). The colony count assays were performed following Lipofectin (Invitrogen)-based transfection of MCF-7 and MDA435 breast cancer cells with mammalian expression constructs encoding MxA and IRF-7. The cells were transfected with the empty vector pCDNA3.1-V5-HIS-TOPO (Invitrogen) as a control. The transfected clones were selected in 0.5 mg/ml G418 for 3 weeks and then fixed with methanol for 10 min and stained with 0.5% crystal violet (BDH Chemicals). For caspase 3 cleavage assays, MBR62-bcl2 cells were uninduced or induced to express BRCA1 for 24 h in the presence of 100, 200, and 300 units/ml IFN-γ. Similarly HCC-V and HCC-BRCA1 cells were left untreated or were treated with 100 units/ml IFN-γ for 24 h, and the protein lysates were extracted in RIPA buffer (50 μm Hepes, pH 7.0, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS). The proteins were separated on a 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane followed by immunoblotting using an anti-cleaved caspase 3 antibody that specifically recognizes the cleaved 17- and 19-kDa caspase 3 products. Antibodies against BRCA1 include the rabbit polyclonal C-20 (Santa Cruz) and the mouse monoclonal AB1 (Calbiochem). Cleaved caspase 3 was detected using the rabbit polyclonal cleaved caspase 3 (Asp175) antibody (Cell Signaling). The IRF-7 antibody was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnologies (catalog number sc-9083). β-Tubulin was detected using the monoclonal antibody T-4026 (Sigma). HCC-BRCA1 and HCC-V cells were grown to 60% confluence on coverslips and treated or untreated with 100 units of IFN-γ for 72 h. The coverslips were fixed in 95% cold ethanol, washed three times in TBST for 5 min at room temperature, and incubated with anti-cleaved caspase 3 polyclonal antibody (Cell Signaling) diluted in TBST containing 5% bovine serum albumin overnight at 4 °C. Following primary incubation, the coverslips were washed three times in TBST containing 5% bovine serum albumin followed by incubation with secondary fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated rabbit anti-goat IgG (Sigma) for 1 h at room temperature. The coverslips were washed three times in TBST followed by a single wash in TBS, counterstained with propidium iodide, and subsequently visualized on a LEICA DMLB fluorescent microscope. We generated an MDA435 breast cancer-derived cell line termed MBR62-bcl2 with tightly regulated tetracycline-inducible expression of BRCA1 and constitutive expression of bcl2. To evaluate the degree of BRCA1 induction in these cells, we carried out Northern and Western blot analysis. Time course Northern blot analysis revealed that BRCA1 expression levels were maximal for 24 h after tetracycline withdrawal, consistent with our previous observations (22Harkin D.P. Bean J.M. Miklos D. Song Y.-H. Truong V.B. Englert C. Christians F.C. Ellisen L.W. Maheswaran S. Oliner J.D. Haber D.A.

Immunoprecipitation (IP)-Western blot analysis 24 h after tetracycline withdrawal when BRCA1 expression levels are highest demonstrated an ∼5-fold induction above endogenous protein levels (Fig.1 A). This is well within the physiological range for BRCA1 overexpression observed in mouse models where BRCA1 expression increases ∼10-fold during pregnancy and postlactional involution (26Marquis S.T.

Similarly in human cell lines, BRCA1 expression levels increase 5–10-fold, following treatment with estrogens or 1α,25(OH)2D3 (27Gudas J.M. Nguyen H., Li, T. Cowan K.H. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 4561-4565PubMed Google Scholar, 28Spillman M.A. Bowcock A.M. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 1639-1645PubMed Google Scholar, 29Campbell M.J. Gombart A.F. Kwok S.H. Park S. Koeffler H.P.

We used MBR62-bcl2 cells to search for endogenous genes whose expression levels might be altered in response to inducible expression of BRCA1. Total RNA was extracted 24 h after BRCA1 induction, biotinylated, and hybridized to the Affymetrix HG-U95A gene array representing 12,000 known transcripts and expressed sequence tags (22Harkin D.P.

A total of 32 genes were identified as being induced, and three were repressed following analysis of duplicate experiments. A total of 11 genes were identified as exhibiting 5-fold or greater induction and were further screened by Northern blot analysis (Table I). Surprisingly all of these 11 genes were previously described interferon-inducible genes, suggesting a possible role for BRCA1 in mediating the IFN-regulated signaling pathways. Northern blot analysis confirmed induction of six of these genes including IRF-7, a transcription factor required for activation of a subset of IFN-α genes following viral infection (induced 6-fold) (31Marie I. Smith E. Prakash A. Levy D.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 23: 8803-8814Crossref Scopus (126) Google Scholar); MxA, a GTPase with activity against several RNA viruses (induced 8-fold) (32Janzen C. Kochs G.

Wang J. Zhu J. Jiang J. Shou J. Chen X. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 7740-7747Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) (Table I and Fig. 1 B). Either induction of the remaining five genes was not confirmed or the expression was not detectable by Northern blot analysis (Table I). To determine the kinetics of induction of the identified targets by BRCA1, we carried out Western blot analysis. Increased expression of IRF-7 was observed as early as 6 h after inducible expression of BRCA1 and was maintained up to 72 h, suggesting that IRF-7 represents an immediate downstream target of BRCA1 (Fig. 1 C).Table IIdentification of candidate BRCA1 targets by oligonucleotide array-based expression profilingAccession numberDescriptionFold induction by arrayFold induction by NorthernM24594IFN 5620.7NDJ041649–2716.7NDU52513RIG-G14Neg.U53830IRF-7116X67325p2792U229706–1694M33882MxA/p788.78X57522RING 4/TAP 1/APT 182F008445Phospholipid scramblase7.6NDM14660ISG-54K7.13M2112RANTES5.6NDA summary of results from duplicate hybridization to oligonucleotide arrays representing 12,000 expressed genes and expressed sequence tags is shown.

Open table in a new tab A summary of results from duplicate hybridization to oligonucleotide arrays representing 12,000 expressed genes and expressed sequence tags is shown. Labeled RNA probes were derived from MBR62-bcl2 cells in which BRCA1 had been induced or uninduced for 24 h. The fold induction by Northern blot analysis was determined by densitometric analysis relative to GAPDH controls. All genes showing at least 5-fold induction by array are listed. ND, not detected; Neg., negative. To investigate the possibility that BRCA1-mediated induction of the identified targets was an indirect effect, we examined the ability of BRCA1 to induce expression of IFN-α, IFN-β, and IFN-γ in the MBR62-bcl2 cells. Semi-quantative reverse transcription-PCR analysis failed to show induction of any of the three transcripts following inducible expression of BRCA1, suggesting that the ability of BRCA1 to induce expression of the targets does not occur through this indirect mechanism (data not shown). One of our previously identified BRCA1 targets, EGR1, was also induced in the current screen, although to a lesser extent (2-fold) than previously observed. Interestingly, we failed to identify GADD45 in this screen, even though we have previously demonstrated that GADD45 is clearly induced by BRCA1 in these cells (13Mullan P.B. Quinn J.E. Gilmore P.M. McWilliams S. Andrews H. Gervin C. McCabe N. McKenna S. White P. Song Y-H. Maheswaran S. Liu E. Haber D.A. Johnston P.G. Harkin D.P. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 6123-6131Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). To evaluate the effect of interferon on the ability of BRCA1 to induce expression of the identified target genes, MBR62-bcl2 cells were treated with 100 units of IFN-α, IFN-β, or IFN-γ in the presence and absence of inducible BRCA1 expression. Three of the identified targets, MxA, ISG-54, and IRF-7, were synergistically up-regulated by BRCA1 in the presence of IFN-γ but not in the presence of IFN-α or -β, although these genes were to varying degrees IFN-α- and IFN-β-inducible (Fig.2), suggesting a specific interaction between BRCA1 and IFN-γ in the regulation of a subset of the identified target genes. In contrast, TAP1, which was responsive to IFN-β and IFN-γ, failed to exhibit synergy following induction of BRCA1 (Fig. 2 A). We calculated the average increase in expression for IRF-7, MxA, and ISG-54 relative to the GAPDH controls by densitometric analysis. IRF-7 expression was induced on average 6-fold by BRCA1 alone, 6-fold by IFN-γ alone, and 23-fold by BRCA1 in the presence of IFN-γ (Fig. 2). MxA expression was induced on average 8-fold by BRCA1, 17-fold by IFN-γ, and 44-fold by BRCA1 following treatment with IFN-γ (Fig. 2). Similarly ISG-54 was induced on average 3-fold by BRCA1, 2.5-fold by IFN-γ, and 12-fold by BRCA1 in the presence of IFN-γ (Fig. 2), indicating a synergistic induction of IRF-7, MxA, and ISG-54 by BRCA1 in the presence of IFN-γ. In contrast no such synergistic up-regulation was observed for TAP1, which was induced 2-fold by BRCA1 alone, 5-fold by IFN-γ alone, and 6-fold by BRCA1 in the presence of IFN-γ, suggesting that TAP1 may be independently regulated by BRCA1 and IFN-γ (Fig. 2 A). To establish the potential role played by BRCA1 in mediating the IFN-γ-regulated signaling pathway, we examined the ability of IFN-γ to induce expression of IRF-7 in a panel of breast cancer cell lines. These included the MDA468 and T47D cells, which express endogenous wild type BRCA1; the MBR62-bcl2 cells, which are induced to express exogenous BRCA1; and finally the HCC1937 cell line, which expresses a single copy of a C-terminally truncated BRCA1 protein product (35Tomlinson G.E. Chen T.T. Stastny V.A. Virmani A.K. Spillman M.A. Tonk V. Blum J.L. Schneider N.R. Wistuba I.I. Shay J.W. Minna J.D. Gazdar A.F. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 3237-3242PubMed Google Scholar). Northern blot analysis confirmed IFN-γ-mediated induction of IRF-7 in the breast cancer cell lines expressing wild type BRCA1 or MBR62-bcl2 cells induced to express exogenous BRCA1 but not in the BRCA1 mutant HCC1937 cell line (Fig.3 A). To determine whether mutation of BRCA1 was the reason for the failure of IFN-γ to induce IRF-7, we reconstituted BRCA1 expression in these cells using a CMV-driven wild type BRCA1 expression construct. To confirm expression of exogenous BRCA1 in the HCC1937 cells, we carried out Northern blot and reverse transcription-PCR analysis. We failed to detect the 5.6-kb exogenous BRCA1 transcript in the reconstituted cells by Northern blot analysis, indicating extremely low levels of exogenous BRCA1 expression in these cells (data not shown). However, we were able to confirm expression by reverse transcription-PCR using one primer complimentary to BRCA1 and a second primer designed against the poly(A) sequence encoded in the Rc/CMV vector (Fig. 3 B). Reconstitution of BRCA1 in the HCC1937 cells (HCC-BRCA1) resulted in a significant induction of both IRF-7 and MxA following treatment with 100 units of IFN-γ (Fig. 3 C). Densitometric analysis revealed that MxA and IRF-7 expression levels were induced 1.3- and 1.5-fold, respectively, in HCC1937 reconstituted with empty vector (HCC-V) following stimulation with 100 units of IFN-γ. In contrast IFN-γ stimulation increased MxA and IRF-7 expression ∼7- and 5-fold, respectively, following reconstitution with wild type exogenous BRCA1, suggesting that BRCA1 is required for IFN-γ-mediated induction of MxA and IRF-7 in these cells (Fig. 3 C). We carried out cellular proliferation assays to evaluate the effect of interferon treatment on the growth of MBR62-bcl2 cells in the presence and absence of BRCA1 induction. Growth curves evaluating the effect of interferon treatment on MBR62-bcl2 cells over time demonstrated a synergistic inhibition of cellular proliferation when BRCA1 was expressed in the presence of 500 units of IFN-γ (Fig.4 A). In contrast to that observed for IFN-γ, IFN-β treatment failed to synergize with BRCA1, giving rise to a marked cytostatic effect in both the presence and absence of exogenous BRCA1 expression. IFN-α treatment did result in a mild differential phenotype, although it was much less marked that that observed for IFN-γ (Fig. 4 A). To determine the mechanistic basis of the observed growth inhibition, we evaluated the effect of IFN-γ treatment on cell cycle profile and cell death in the presence and absence of BRCA1 induction. Fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis failed to identify any perturbations in the cell cycle profile following inducible expression of BRCA1 in the presence of IFN-γ (data not shown), suggesting that the observed inhibition of proliferation was due to cell death. To determine whether the observed cell death resulted from apoptosis, MBR62-bcl2 cells were induced to express BRCA1 in the presence of increasing concentrations of IFN-γ for 24 h followed by caspase 3 cleavage assay. The cleaved 17- and 19-kDa caspase 3 products, which are an early hallmark of apoptosis, were only observed when BRCA1 was expressed in the presence of IFN-γ. Furthermore a dose-responsive increase in cleaved caspase 3 was observed when BRCA1 was expressed in the presence of 100, 200, or 300 units of IFN-γ, confirming that the observed inhibition of cellular growth was due to the activation of an apoptotic response to the combined effect of inducible BRCA1 expression in the presence of IFN-γ (Fig. 4 B). To gain some insight into which of the potential target genes might be mediating this apoptotic response, we carried out colony count assays following transfection of both MDA435 (from which the MBR62-bcl2 cells were derived) and MCF-7 breast cancer cells with expression constructs encoding full-length IRF-7 or MxA. Constitutive expression of IRF-7 in these cells dramatically inhibited cell growth compared with cells transfected with vector only or MxA, suggesting that the synergistic induction of IRF-7 following inducible expression of BRCA1 in the presence of IFN-γ may contribute to the observed apoptotic cell death (Fig. 5). Having demonstrated that reconstitution of wild type BRCA1 in the HCC1937 cells dramatically enhances IFN-γ-mediated induction of IRF-7 and MxA (Fig. 3), we evaluated the effect of IFN-γ on the proliferation of the BRCA1 reconstituted HCC-BRCA1 cells relative to the vector-transfected control HCC-V cells. Growth curves evaluating the effect of 100 units of IFN-γ on both HCC-BRCA1 and HCC-V cells over time demonstrated an increased sensitivity of the HCC-BRCA1 cells to the antiproliferative effects of IFN-γ compared with vector-transfected control HCC-V cells (Fig.6 A). To determine whether this increase in sensitivity reflected an increase in IFN-γ-mediated apoptosis in the HCC-BRCA1 cells, we carried out Western blot analysis to compare the degree of caspase 3 cleavage in the two cell lines following IFN-γ treatment. Reconstitution of the HCC1937 cells with BRCA1 elevated the background levels of cleaved caspase 3 relative to vector-transfected controls, consistent with our previous observations that BRCA1 alone can induce apoptosis (22"

Thus, the levels of the mRNA corresponding to these two enzymes were found to change in the same direction in rat liver and in isolated rat hepatocytes. In contrast, other groups have not seen such regulation of CYP27A1 in rabbit liver or in rat liver when using an activity assay. In the present work, the effect of bile acid treatment on human CYP27A1/luciferase reporter activity was studied in a transient transfection assay in human liver-derived HepG2 cells. Neither the endogenous 27-hydroxylase activity nor the CYP27A1/luciferase reporter activity were down-regulated by treatment of HepG2 cells with chenodeoxycholic acid or taurochenodeoxycholic acid. We also measured CYP27A1 mRNA and CYP7A1 mRNA in liver of humans subjected to treatment with chenodeoxycholic acid, ursodeoxycholic acid, hydroxymethylglutaryl (HMG)-CoA reductase inhibitor and a combination of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor and cholestyramine. There was a 60-fold variation in the levels of CYP7A1 mRNA but only a 5-fold variation in the levels of CYP27A1 mRNA. There was no correlation between the two mRNA species. It is concluded that, in humans, there is little or no coordinate regulation of CYP7A1 and CYP27A1 at the transcriptional level, and that CYP27A1 is not subject to a negative feedback control by bile acids.

This pathway is likely to be responsible for 50% or more of the production of bile acids in humans under normal conditions. In man, as well as in rat and pig, there is an important alternative pathway, the acidic pathway, involving a mitochondrial 27-hydroxylation of cholesterol as the first step. The acidic pathway may be responsible for 30–50% of the total formation of bile acids. Although most of this pathway is likely to start in the liver (1Björkhem I. Eggertsen G. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 2001; 12: 97-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 2Vlahcevic Z.R. Pandak W.M. Stravitz R.T. Gastroenterol. Clin. North Am. 1999; 28: 1-25Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar), a significant part of it, corresponding to 5–10% of total formation of bile acids, starts in extrahepatic tissues or organs (3Lund E. Andersson O. Zhang J. Babiker A. Ahlborg G. Diczfalusy U. Einarsson K. Sjövall J. Björkhem I. Arterioscl. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1996; 16: 2073-2100Crossref Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 4Duane W.C.

Thus there is a continuous flux of 27-hydroxylated metabolites from extrahepatic tissues to the liver where they are rapidly oxidized into bile acids.The regulation of the microsomal cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase, CYP7A1,1 has been extensively studied. The expression of this enzyme is under negative feedback control by bile acids (1Björkhem I. Eggertsen G. Curr. Opin.

Conflicting results have been reported concerning a possible regulation by bile acids of the hepatic mitochondrial 27-hydroxylase, CYP27A1. The extrahepatic CYP27A1 is not likely to be regulated by bile acids. In 1973, Björkhem and Gustafsson (7Björkhem I. Gustafsson J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1973; 36: 201-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) reported that interruption of the enterohepatic circulation of bile acids by cholestyramine treatment did not up-regulate mitochondrial 27-hydroxylase activity in rats. In accordance with this, Axelson and Sjövall (8Axelson M. Sjövall J. J. Steroid Biochem. 1990; 36: 631-640Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar) showed that the levels of circulating intermediates in the 27-hydroxylase pathway in man were not affected by cholestyramine treatment. In contrast, such treatment led to a marked increase in the circulating intermediates in the cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase pathway. Some years ago, Stravitzet al. (9Stravitz R.T. Vlahcevic Z.R.

Commun. 1995; 216: 868-873Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) reported that CYP27A1 in rabbits appears not to be subject to a negative feedback control by bile acids neither at a transcriptional nor at a post-transcriptional level. In accordance with these results, Xu et al. (13Xu G. Salen G. Shefer S. Tint G.S. Nguyen L.B. Chen T.S. Greenblatt D. J. Clin.

(14Schwarz M. Russell D.W. Dietschy J.M. Turley S.D. J. Lipid Res. 2001; 42: 1594-1603Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) reported that alternate pathways, including the one initiated by CYP27A1, are not up-regulated by cholestyramine feeding in the cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase knock-out mouse.Little is known about a possible regulation of CYP27A1 by bile acids in humans. Very recently, Segev et al. (15Segev H. Honigman A. Rosen H. Leitersdorf E. Atherosclerosis. 2001; 156: 339-347Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) reported that cholic acid in high concentrations repressed human CYP27A1 mRNA levels by affecting the stability of its mRNA in a human hepatoblastoma cell line. Due to the very high concentrations used and the relatively small effects, it is difficult to draw firm conclusions from this study.In this paper, we have studied the effect of bile acids on the expression of the human CYP27A1 gene using human liver-derived HepG2 cells and a CYP27A1 promotor/luciferase reporter construct. Furthermore, the hepatic levels of mRNA corresponding to CYP27A1 and CYP7A1 were measured in livers of patients subjected to treatments known to markedly affect the levels of cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase activity and CYP7A1 mRNA level. The results provide evidence against a coordinate regulation of CYP27A1 and CYP7A1 in human liver.DISCUSSIONFrom studies with cultured rat hepatocytes it has been reported that the CYP27A1 mRNA level was repressed, and the sterol 27-hydroxylase activity was inhibited by bile acids (9Stravitz R.T.

In contrast, studies with rabbits and mice have not supported the contention of a possible feedback regulation of the CYP27A1 gene by bile acids (12Araya Z. Sjöberg H. Wikvall K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 216: 868-873Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 13Xu G. Salen G. Shefer S. Tint G.S. Nguyen L.B. Chen T.S. Greenblatt D. J. Clin.

Lipid Res. 2001; 42: 1594-1603Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the present study, bile acids of different hydrophobicity were examined for effects on the human CYP27A1 promotor/luciferase reporter activity as well as on the endogenous sterol 27-hydroxylase activity in human HepG2 cells. None of the bile acids reported to suppress CYP7A1 mRNA levels in HepG2 cells and sterol 27-hydroxylase activity and CYP27A1 mRNA levels in rat hepatocytes showed any effect on the transcriptional activity of the human CYP27A1 gene. In a recent study on the transcriptional regulation of the human CYP27A1 gene, Segev et al. (15Segev H. Honigman A. Rosen H. Leitersdorf E. Atherosclerosis. 2001; 156: 339-347Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) reported that cholic acid in very high concentrations (500 μm) had no effect on the CYP27A1/luciferase reporter activity but repressed CYP27A1 mRNA levels in human Huh7 cells. The authors concluded that cholic acid may affect CYP27A1 mRNA stability (15Segev H. Honigman A. Rosen H. Leitersdorf E. Atherosclerosis. 2001; 156: 339-347Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). In our experiments with HepG2 cells, the endogenous sterol 27-hydroxylase activity was not inhibited by bile acids in concentrations of 50–100 μm. Under the same conditions these bile acids decreased the CYP7A1 mRNA levels by 60–80%. This finding indicates that bile acids do not affect the CYP27A1 mRNA stability in these cells. It should be pointed out that the normal levels of bile acids in portal blood are less than 50 μm (25Angelin B. Björkhem I. Einarsson K. Ewerth S. J. Clin. Invest. 1982; 70: 724-731Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar).Our experiments on gallstone patients failed to demonstrate an effect of chenodeoxycholic acid on the human CYP27A1 gene. Because of the low number of patients, the results do not exclude a slight positive effect of the treatment with cholestyramine on CYP27A1 mRNA levels. If there is such an effect, however, it is likely to be considerably lower than that on CYP7A1. There were no significant correlations between CYP27A1 and CYP7A1 mRNA levels (r = 0.24). It should be emphasized that the variations of the CYP7A1 mRNA levels were about 60-fold in the above experiments, whereas the variations of CYP27A1 mRNA levels were only 5-fold.According to the present results, the classical pathway is the only one in humans regulated by bile acids via a negative feed-back control. The contribution of the acidic pathway starting with a 27-hydroxylation of cholesterol is thus likely to be greater when the classical pathway is suppressed by, e.g. treatment with chenodeoxycholic acid, and smaller when it is up-regulated by, e.g. treatment with cholestyramine. In agreement with this, we have previously shown that treatment of gallstone patients with chenodeoxycholic acid prior to cholecystectomy inhibits CYP7A1 activity by about 90% (26Reihnér E. Björkhem I. Angelin B. Ewerth S. Einarsson K. Gastroenterology. 1989; 97: 1498-1505Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), whereas formation of cholic acid is suppressed only by about 60% by such treatment (27Nilsell K. Angelin B. Leijd B. Einarsson K. Gastroenterology. 1983; 85: 1248-1256Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar).In conclusion, the results of the present communication provide evidence against a coordinate regulation of CYP7A1 and CYP27A1 in man. The results strongly indicate that CYP27A1 in human liver, in contrast to what has been reported with rat liver (9Stravitz R.T. Vlahcevic Z.R. Russell T.L. Heizer M.L. Avadhani N.G. Hylemon P.B. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1996; 57: 337-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 10Twisk J. de Wit E.C.M. Princen H.M.G. Biochem.

Biol. 1999; 70: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), is not regulated by bile acids via a feedback control at the transcriptional level. The classic pathway for biosynthesis of bile acids in the mammalian liver starts with a 7α-hydroxylation of cholesterol. This pathway is likely to be responsible for 50% or more of the production of bile acids in humans under normal conditions. In man, as well as in rat and pig, there is an important alternative pathway, the acidic pathway, involving a mitochondrial 27-hydroxylation of cholesterol as the first step. The acidic pathway may be responsible for 30–50% of the total formation of bile acids. Although most of this pathway is likely to start in the liver (1Björkhem I. Eggertsen G. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 2001; 12: 97-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 2Vlahcevic Z.R. Pandak W.M. Stravitz R.T. Gastroenterol. Clin. North Am. 1999; 28: 1-25Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar), a significant part of it, corresponding to 5–10% of total formation of bile acids, starts in extrahepatic tissues or organs (3Lund E. Andersson O. Zhang J. Babiker A. Ahlborg G. Diczfalusy U. Einarsson K. Sjövall J. Björkhem I. Arterioscl. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1996; 16: 2073-2100Crossref Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 4Duane W.C. Javitt N.B. J. Lipid Res. 1999; 40: 1194-1199Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus there is a continuous flux of 27-hydroxylated metabolites from extrahepatic tissues to the liver where they are rapidly oxidized into bile acids. The regulation of the microsomal cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase, CYP7A1,1 has been extensively studied. The expression of this enzyme is under negative feedback control by bile acids (1Björkhem I. Eggertsen G. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 2001; 12: 97-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 2Vlahcevic Z.R. Pandak W.M. Stravitz R.T. Gastroenterol. Clin.

Conflicting results have been reported concerning a possible regulation by bile acids of the hepatic mitochondrial 27-hydroxylase, CYP27A1. The extrahepatic CYP27A1 is not likely to be regulated by bile acids. In 1973, Björkhem and Gustafsson (7Björkhem I. Gustafsson J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1973; 36: 201-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) reported that interruption of the enterohepatic circulation of bile acids by cholestyramine treatment did not up-regulate mitochondrial 27-hydroxylase activity in rats. In accordance with this, Axelson and Sjövall (8Axelson M. Sjövall J. J. Steroid Biochem. 1990; 36: 631-640Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar) showed that the levels of circulating intermediates in the 27-hydroxylase pathway in man were not affected by cholestyramine treatment. In contrast, such treatment led to a marked increase in the circulating intermediates in the cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase pathway. Some years ago, Stravitzet al. (9Stravitz R.T. Vlahcevic Z.R. Russell T.L. Heizer M.L. Avadhani N.G. Hylemon P.B. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1996; 57: 337-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), Twisk et al. (10Twisk J. de Wit E.C.M. Princen H.M.G.

Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1999; 70: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) reported that there seems to be a coordinate regulation of CYP7A1 and CYP27A1 in rats. Thus, the levels of mRNA corresponding to these enzymes were found to change in the same direction in rat liver and in isolated rat hepatocytes (9Stravitz R.T. Vlahcevic Z.R. Russell T.L. Heizer M.L.

Commun. 1995; 216: 868-873Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) reported that CYP27A1 in rabbits appears not to be subject to a negative feedback control by bile acids neither at a transcriptional nor at a post-transcriptional level. In accordance with these results, Xu et al. (13Xu G. Salen G. Shefer S. Tint G.S. Nguyen L.B. Chen T.S. Greenblatt D. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 103: 89-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) reported that bile fistula drainage did not affect sterol 27-hydroxylase activity in rabbits. In a recent study, Schwarz et al. (14Schwarz M. Russell D.W. Dietschy J.M. Turley S.D. J. Lipid Res. 2001; 42: 1594-1603Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) reported that alternate pathways, including the one initiated by CYP27A1, are not up-regulated by cholestyramine feeding in the cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase knock-out mouse. Little is known about a possible regulation of CYP27A1 by bile acids in humans. Very recently, Segev et al. (15Segev H. Honigman A. Rosen H. Leitersdorf E. Atherosclerosis. 2001; 156: 339-347Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) reported that cholic acid in high concentrations repressed human CYP27A1 mRNA levels by affecting the stability of its mRNA in a human hepatoblastoma cell line. Due to the very high concentrations used and the relatively small effects, it is difficult to draw firm conclusions from this study. In this paper, we have studied the effect of bile acids on the expression of the human CYP27A1 gene using human liver-derived HepG2 cells and a CYP27A1 promotor/luciferase reporter construct. Furthermore, the hepatic levels of mRNA corresponding to CYP27A1 and CYP7A1 were measured in livers of patients subjected to treatments known to markedly affect the levels of cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase activity and CYP7A1 mRNA level. The results provide evidence against a coordinate regulation of CYP27A1 and CYP7A1 in human liver. DISCUSSIONFrom studies with cultured rat hepatocytes it has been reported that the CYP27A1 mRNA level was repressed, and the sterol 27-hydroxylase activity was inhibited by bile acids (9Stravitz R.T.

Walker D.R. Koonin E.V. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 1223-1242Crossref PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar). It appears that Mre11 is the central protein in this complex, since it can interact with either of the other two proteins, whereas Rad50 requires Mre11 for Xrs2 binding (7Usui T. Ohta T. Oshiumi H.

Additionally, DSBs occur as natural intermediates during specific processes such as mating type switching in Saccharomyces cerevisiae (12Haber J.E. Annu. Rev.

DSB repair is mediated by two independent pathways, non-homologous end-joining and homologous recombination (HR), both of which mediate repair via the Mre11 complex in S. cerevisiae (14Johzuka K.

The involvement of the Mre11 complex (to which we refer as the M/R complex) in DSB repair operates at several levels, including nucleolytic processing of the break, acting as a DNA damage signal sensor/transducer, and determining cell cycle checkpoints. Mre11 is involved in nucleolytic processing of DNA ends at DSBs during HR and possibly non-homologous end-joining (1Haber J.E.

The complex also plays a role in chromosome integrity at telomeres, such that deletion of any one of its three proteins results in telomere shortening in yeast (15Boulton S.J. Jackson S.P.

In this role, the MRE11 complex interacts epistatically with telomerase but synergistically with the Ku proteins (35Nugent C.I. Bosco G. Ross L.O. Evans S.K. Salinger A.P. Moore J.K. Haber J.E.

Homologous recombination is important in the survival of African trypanosomes, unicellular parasites that diverged early during eukaryotic evolution and display peculiarities in their gene expression and metabolism. Bloodstream form trypanosomes are protected by a variant surface glycoprotein (VSG) coat, which masks the underlying invariant surface antigens and inhibits the nonspecific immune mechanisms of the mammalian host. Although only one VSG species is present on the cell surface at any particular time, the parasite evades destruction by periodically switching to another VSG, using a process known as antigenic variation (for recent reviews see Refs. 37Barry J.D. Parasitol. Today. 1997; 13: 212-218Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 38Borst P. Bitter W. Blundell P.A. Chaves I. Cross M. Gerrits H. van Leeuwen F. McCulloch R. Taylor M.

Each trypanosome potentially can produce probably hundreds of distinct surface coats (42Capbern A. Giroud C. Baltz T. Mattern P. Exp. Parasitol. 1977; 42: 6-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 43Van der Ploeg L.H.T. Valerio D. de Lange T. Bernards A. Borst P. Grosveld F.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1982; 10: 5905-5923Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). The majority of antigenic variation is driven by HR, where silent VSG genes are duplicated and transposed into a transcriptionally active telomeric locus (the bloodstream expression site (BES)). The importance of HR in this switching is shown by the central involvement of Rad51, a major HR enzyme (44McCulloch R. Barry J.D. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2875-2888Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Given the involvement of Mre11 in DNA repair and recombination, as well as in telomere biology, it is important to understand how the protein acts in trypanosome antigenic variation, a process involving recombination and transcriptional regulation conducted largely at telomeres. Here we show that mre11−/− null mutant strains display significant growth retardation, resulting from decreased cell viability. The strains showed no change inVSG gene switching or in telomere length but did display hypersensitivity to DNA damage and developed GCRs. Our work demonstrates the significance of Mre11 in maintaining integrity of theTrypanosoma brucei genome, and the absence of a detectable role in VSG switching implies that DSBs either are not involved or are processed independently of Mre11 in this process. Monomorphic bloodstream form T. brucei 221a trypanosomes of the strain 3174.2 (44McCulloch R. Barry J.D. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2875-2888Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 45McCulloch R. Rudenko G. Borst P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 833-843Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), a derivative of strain Lister 427 (46Cross G.A.M. Parasitology. 1975; 71: 393-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (641) Google Scholar), were grown in vitro at 37 °C in HMI-9 medium (47Hirumi H. Hirumi K. J. Parasitol. 1989; 75: 985-989Crossref PubMed Scopus (782) Google Scholar), and transformations were performed by electroporation as described previously (44McCulloch R. Barry J.D. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2875-2888Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Pleomorphic bloodstream form trypanosomes of the ILTat 1.2 line (strain EATRO 795) were cultured in HMI-9 medium + 1.1% methylcellulose, and transformants were selected by plating 6 × 106 transformed cells in 36 ml of medium over a 24-well dish. VSG switching frequencies and mechanisms were measured in the marked strain 3174.2 as described (44McCulloch R. Barry J.D. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2875-2888Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 45McCulloch R. Rudenko G. Borst P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 833-843Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The entire MRE11 ORF was substituted with cassettes for puromycin N-acetyltransferase (puromycin resistance) or blasticidin S deaminase (blasticidin resistance) encompassed by flanks specific to the MRE11 locus. These cassettes, derived from pTBT and pTPT (gifts of M. Cross and P. Borst, the Netherlands Cancer Institute), were used over two successive rounds of transformation to replace both alleles of the gene. Targeting flanks were amplified from genomic DNA by PCR using Pfu DNA polymerase (Stratagene). 5′ flank primers: 5′-gcggaattcccctcgatagggtgaagggatgtg-3′ (EcoRI), and 5′-ccgaagcttgttaacgccgttaagacagatcaagatgagg-3′ (HindIII/HpaI). 3′ flank primers: 5′-gcgaagcttccatgggtgtgtgtgttttttttttttaatttgtac-3′ (HindIII/NcoI), and 5′-ccgctcgaggcaacaaaagaaactccctggggcgc-3′ (XhoI). Prior to transformation of T. brucei, the constructs were digested with NotI and PspOMI. Transformants were selected with 5 μg·ml−1 blasticidin or 1 μg·ml−1 puromycin. Drug resistance integrations were examined by Southern blot analysis. Genomic DNA was digested with EcoRI and separated on a 0.7% agarose gel, blotted onto nylon membrane (Hybond XL, AmershamBiosciences), hybridized with α-32P-radiolabeled DNA specific to the MRE11 5′-targeting flank, and washed to high stringency (0.1× SSC, 0.1% SDS at 65 °C). A re-expression cassette, tub::MRE11-BLE, was designed to introduce MRE11 into the TUBULINarray. The entire MRE11 ORF (2292 bp) was contained within a 3300-bp product amplified from genomic DNA by PCR with Herculase polymerase (Stratagene) using the following primers: MRE115′, 5′-tctttgcgccaatttttctcgg-3′, and MRE113′, 5′-aaataagggtggtggtaatgcg-3′. The product was cloned in pBluescript upstream of a 400-bp bleomycin phosphotransferase ORF, which possessed a 400-bp 5′-processing region derived from the ACTINintergenic sequence. The whole construct was encompassed by targeting flanks specific to the TUBULIN intergenic region, as in the construct tub::RAD51-BSR (44McCulloch R. Barry J.D. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2875-2888Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Following digestion with NotI and PspOMI, the construct was transformed into the null mutant linemre11−/− 2 and selected by plating 2 × 107 transformed cells in 36 ml of medium containing 2.0 μg·ml−1 bleomycin (Invitrogen), over a 24-well dish. Successful integrations were identified by Southern analysis. The DNA content of themre11−/− null mutant lines was examined by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS), supported by fluorescence microscopy. For FACS analysis, ∼6 × 106 mid-log phase cells were washed in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and fixed in 70% methanol/PBS. The trypanosomes were then stored at 4 °C for at least 1 h, before being washed again in PBS and resuspended in PBS supplemented with 10 μg·ml−1 propidium iodide and 10 μg·ml−1 RNase A. After 45 min at 37 °C, 1 × 104 cells were counted by FACS (FACSCalibur; BD PharMingen) using the CellQuest analysis software (BD PharMingen). For fluorescence microscopy, mid-log phase cells were washed in PBS, spotted onto a glass slide, fixed overnight in 100% methanol at −20 °C, and air-dried. Slides were then stained with 1 ng·μl−14,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole in PBS for 30 min and then washed in PBS. Slides were mounted with PBS, 50% glycerol, 2.5% diazabicyclo[2,2,2]octane. Approximately 400 cells were counted for each sample examined. MRE11 +/+,MRE11+/− , and mre11−/− trypanosome clones were derived by plating cells over a 96-well culture dish at 1 cell·well−1. These populations were then passaged in culture for ∼550 generations and were re-cloned. Genomic plugs were prepared by immobilizing live trypanosomes (5 × 107 cells in 100-μl plugs of 0.7% low melting point agarose) and lysing them in NDS buffer, pH 9 (0.5 m EDTA, 10 mm Tris·HCl, pH 9, 1% SDS) , with 1 mg of proteinase K·ml−1 at 56 °C for 48 h; the plugs were washed at least three times in 1 ml of 1× TB(0.1)E electrophoresis buffer at room temperature before gel separation. Chromosome-size DNA was separated on the CHEF-DR III system (Bio-Rad), using one-half of a genomic plug per lane in a 1.2% agarose gel, in 0.089 mTris borate, 0.1 mm EDTA (TB(0.1)E) at 85 V, 1400- to 700-s pulse time, for 144 h at 15 °C. Cells were grown to a density of ∼5 × 105–2 × 106cells·ml−1 and then diluted to 5 cells·ml−1 in HMI-9 medium supplemented with MMS (Sigma) or 50 cells·ml−1 for phleomycin (Cayla). Each mutagen was titrated against wild type trypanosomes to determine the sublethal range. To assess the effect on growth, the diluted cells were spread over a 96-well culture plate to give a final distribution of 1 trypanosome·well−1. After ∼20 generations (6–7 days), the wells were scored for the presence or absence of growth. The efficiency of integration of the construct tubBLEtub, which targets to the TUBULINarray, replacing an α-tubulin gene and conferring bleomycin resistance, was measured by plating 2 × 107transformed cells in 36 ml of medium containing 2.0 μg·ml−1 bleomycin (Invitrogen) over a 24-well dish and estimating integration frequency (= number of positive wells (clones)/2 × 107). The tubBLEtub construct could also integrate into TUBULIN sequence present at the modified BES (flanking the hygromycin resistance cassette (45McCulloch R. Rudenko G. Borst P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 833-843Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar)) or transgenic MRE11 locus (flanking the puromycin or blasticidin resistance cassettes). Integration into these other loci resulted in the loss of the hygromycin, puromycin, or blasticidin genes, respectively, events that were confirmed by performing PCR for the appropriate resistance gene. BLAST searching of the NCBI data base revealed a 2292-bp MRE11 gene homologue on chromosome II ofT. brucei. Fig. 1depicts an alignment of the predicted polypeptide with four eukaryotic Mre11 sequences (accession number of MRE11 from T. brucei EATRO 795, AJ426461). The first two-thirds show considerable homology, with the T. brucei sequence including the five highly conserved phosphodiesterase motifs associated with nuclease activity and observed in both eukaryotic and prokaryotic Mre11 homologues (2Bressan D.A.

In contrast, the C terminus, responsible for DNA binding, is not well conserved between species (3Furuse M. Nagase Y. Tsubouchi H. Murakami-Murofushi K. Shibata T. Ohta K. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6412-6425Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). Southern mapping indicated that this putative MRE11 gene is unique within the T. brucei genome (data not shown). Trypanosome mre11−/− null mutant strains were created by substituting the entire ORF with cassettes for puromycinN-acetyltransferase (puromycin resistance) or blasticidin S deaminase (blasticidin resistance). These two drug resistance cassettes, cloned between MRE11 flanking sequence, enabled replacement of both alleles of the MRE11 gene via two independent rounds of electroporation. Southern blot analysis confirmed gene replacement (data not shown). Null mutant clones were derived by this approach in both monomorphic (3174.2 transgenic marked strain, as described previously (45McCulloch R. Rudenko G. Borst P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 833-843Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar)) and pleiomorphic (EATRO 795, ILTat 1.2) bloodstream form trypanosomes. The proliferative dynamics of themre11−/− cells were analyzed immediately after their derivation, using growth curves and cell cycle analysis. Fig.2 A depicts in vitrogrowth curves of MRE11 wild type monomorphic bloodstream cells and two independently generated MRE11 +/−and mre11−/− cell lines, the latter of which were derived directly from the heterozygous mutant lines under analysis. The wild type and heterozygous cell lines displayed the same growth rates, with an average population doubling time, during exponential growth, of ∼6.25 h. In contrast, the two independent null mutant lines had a longer doubling time, on average about 8.5 h (a 36% increase in cell generation time relative to wild type orMRE11 +/−). This is similar to the growth retardation in T. brucei rad51−/− mutant lines (44McCulloch R. Barry J.D. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2875-2888Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). In addition, and again consistent withrad51−/− strains, themre11−/− lines reached slightly lower maximal density in culture compared with the wild type or heterozygous cell lines. Reintroduction of intact MRE11 into the tubulin locus restored the wild type growth rate and maximal population density (Fig.2 A), confirming that the absence of Mre11 protein had caused the growth defect. Growth of the bloodstream formmre11−/− mutant cells of the pleomorphic cell line ILTat 1.2 was also retarded (Fig. 2 B). This pleomorphic trypanosome strain grows to a lower maximal density than the 3174.2 line, but the average maximal density was similar for theMRE11 +/− and mre11−/− clones. Non-proliferative stumpy bloodstream form trypanosomes were observed in both the MRE11 +/− heterozygous and homozygous mutant lines when the ILTat 1.2 populations grew to high cell density, indicating that Mre11 absence does not impair trypanosome differentiation from the long slender form to the short stumpy form. To elucidate the cause of the mre11−/− growth defect, we next examined cell cycle progression in the 3174.2 wild type, MRE11 +/−, andmre11−/− cells by FACS analysis and by morphological examination of methanol-fixed trypanosomes using fluorescence microscopy. We could not detect any delay or interruption to the progression of mre11−/− trypanosomes through the cell cycle (Fig. 3 and TableI), suggesting that the impaired growth most likely is due to increased cell mortality in the population.Table ICell cycle distribution of different linesDNA staining pattern mre11 −/−Wild typeLine 1Line 2Total1n 1k119165284 (74.7%)344 (78.9%)1n 2k342256 (14.7%)48 (11.0%)2n 2k151934 (8.9%)36 (8.3%)Other426 (1.6%)8 (1.8%)Total cells1722083804363174.2 wild type and mre11 −/− cells were stained with 2,4-diamidino-2-phenylindole and examined by fluorescence microscopy.

The number of nuclei (n) and kinetoplasts (k) per cell were counted for approximately 400 mutant and wild type trypanosomes. To determine possible causes of the growth phenotype in mre11−/− cells, we studied their molecular karyotype after prolonged growth. Wild type cells and the two independent T. brucei 3174.2MRE11 +/− and mre11−/− lines were cloned, grown in vitro for ∼550 generations, and re-cloned, and genomic DNA was prepared (19 subclones in total: 3 wild type, 3 from each independent MRE11 +/−, and 5 from each independent mre11−/− ). Pulsed field gel (PFG) electrophoresis, utilizing conditions that resulted in a broad chromosomal separation, demonstrated the occurrence of gross chromosomal rearrangements (Fig. 4). It is apparent, even from the ethidium bromide-stained gels, that the karyotypes of the wild type (lanes 1–3) andMRE11 +/− mutant clones (lanes 4–6and 12–14) are indistinguishable from each other.

A well known signaling pathway is the hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate by phospholipase C enzymes to produce diacylglycerol (DAG)1 and soluble phosphatidylinositol 1,4,5-triposphate (1Payrastre B. Missy K. Giuriato S. Bodin S. Plantavid M. Gratacap M. Cell. Signal. 2001; 13: 377-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar).

Because DGKs can remove a lipid messenger by creating another, the subcellular localization of these enzymes, together with their regulation in response to receptor stimulation, are anticipated to be vital for the correct onset of cellular responses. To date, nine DGK isoforms have been found in mammalian tissues, and similar genes are present in plants (19Katagiri T. Mizoguchi T. Shinozaki K. Plant Mol. Biol. 1996; 30: 647-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), the nematodeCaenorhabditis elegans (3Nurrish S. Segalat L. Kaplan J.

A. 1993; 90: 11157-11161Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Structurally, the DGKs contain at least two N-terminal, zinc finger-like, cysteine-rich domains (CRD) and a conserved catalytic domain. Most mammalian DGKs present other distinct homology domains that have been used to classify them into five subclasses. The presence of different domains and the distinct tissue distribution of DGKs suggest very precise regulation and specific functions for these proteins in different cell types (22van Blitterswijk W.J. Houssa B. Cell. Signal. 2000; 12: 595-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). Most DGKs are cytosolic enzymes, and translocation from the cytosol to other subcellular compartments appears to be a general mechanism for activation of this enzyme family. DGKζ, a type IV DGK, was originally cloned from human endothelial cell cDNA as well as from rat retina and brain (23Bunting M. Tang W. Zimmerman G. McIntyre T. Prescott S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10230-10236Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 24Goto K. Kondo H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 11196-11201Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Not having the restricted expression pattern described for other isoforms, DGKζ appears much more ubiquitous, and DGKζ RNA is abundant in tissues such as skeletal muscle and lymphoid cells. There are two class IV DGK isoforms (DGKζ and ι) that are characterized by a domain homologous to the myristoylated alanine-rich protein kinase C substrate (MARCKS) protein phosphorylation domain, four C-terminal ankyrin repeats, and a PDZ-binding motif. Translocation of DGKζ from the cytosol to the nucleus is proposed to regulate cell growth by modulating nuclear DAG levels (25Topham M.K. Bunting M. Zimmerman G.A. McIntyre T.M. Blackshear P.J. Prescott S.M. Nature. 1998; 394: 697-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). More recently, it was shown that this enzyme can interact with and regulate either integral or plasma membrane-associated proteins such as the long form leptin receptor (26Liu Z. Chang G. Leibowitz S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 5900-5907Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), syntrophin (27Hogan A. Shepherd L. Chabot J. Quenneville S. Prescott S.M. Topham M. Gee S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 26526-26533Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), and RasGRP (28Topham M.K. Prescott S.M. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 1135-1143Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Whereas the signaling functions of DGKζ as a DAG-driven signal attenuator are well characterized (25Topham M.K. Bunting M. Zimmerman G.A. McIntyre T.M. Blackshear P.J. Prescott S.M. Nature. 1998; 394: 697-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar, 28Topham M.K. Prescott S.M. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 1135-1143Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), the mechanisms by which this enzyme is activated and gains access to its substrate remain undefined. Here, we studied the spatiotemporal regulation of DGKζ in T-lymphocytes following the stimulation of an ectopically expressed, G-coupled, muscarinic type I receptor known to mimic TCR responses (29Desai D. Newton M. Kadlece T. Weiss A. Nature. 1990; 348: 66-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar,30Izquierdo M. Ruiz-Ruiz M. Lopez-Rivas A. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 21-28PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, we examined the requirements of each of the defined structural motifs for both enzymatic activity and translocation. GFP-tagged DGKζ translocates very rapidly from the cytosol to the plasma membrane in response to the addition of carbachol. Enzymatic activity is not required for movement toward the plasma membrane, whereas phosphorylation of the MARCKS domain is nonessential for enzyme activity but absolutely required for membrane localization. The protein does not translocate following TCR stimulation, indicating that phospholipase C-mediated DAG generation and PKC activation are not the only signals required for enzyme translocation. Deletion of the DGKζ C-terminal domain, which contains four ankyrin repeats and a PDZ-binding sequence, restores membrane translocation following TCR triggering, suggesting that these domains play a restrictive role in the regulation of membrane translocation. All together, these results demonstrate DGKζ translocation in living cells in response to G protein-coupled receptors and provide further insight into the role of the protein domains specific to this DGK isoform and those shared by all DGK family members.

Leupeptin and aprotinin were from Roche Molecular Biochemicals, and N-octyl-β-d-glucopyranoside was fromCalbiochem. Anti-GFP monoclonal antibody was purchased from CLONTECH, anti-CD28 antibody (Cat. 555725) was from BD PharMingen, and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG was from Dako. Polystyrene 15.0-μm microspheres were from Polysciences Inc. (Warrington, PA; catalog no. 18328). Rat DGK-IV cDNA was a generous gift of K. Goto (Yamagata University School of Medicine, Sendai, Japan). pSREflagDGKIV was excised with EcoRI, and the 3.4-kb fragment encoding the DGK-IV cDNA was subcloned in the pcDNA3Myc vector (pCDNAMycDGK-IV). For expression experiments, all constructs were subcloned in the pEGFPBos vector in the GFP C terminus. For the MCA construct, pCDNA3MycDGKIV was digested with BstXI/BglII, and the 2.2-kb fragment was subcloned in pEGFPBos. To generate the ankyrin domains deletion (ΔANK), pCMV3MycDGKIV was SacI-digested, blunted, KpnI-digested, and subcloned in pEGFPBos digested withKpnI/SmaI. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). To generate the kinase-dead version of the enzyme, Gly-354 was replaced with Asp as described (25Topham M.K. Bunting M. Zimmerman G.A. McIntyre T.M. Blackshear P.J. Prescott S.M. Nature. 1998; 394: 697-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). We designed two mutations in the MARCKS homology domain; in the first we replaced Ser-259, Ser-266, Ser-271, and Ser-272 with Ala (mutant Ser → Ala), and in the second the same residues were replaced with Asp (mutant Ser → Asp). To mutate the CRDs, the first conserved His in each of the two CRDs of the protein, His-98 or His-173, were replaced with Gly either in the wild type protein or in the Ser → Asp mutant. The C-terminal domain (CT) construct, including the four ankyrin repeats and the PDZ-binding motif, was generated by PCR with appropriate primers, which included two restriction sites, SalI and XbaI. The PCR product was subcloned in the pGEM-T easy vector (Promega) and then excised withSalI/XbaI to be subcloned in the expression vector pEFBosCX-HA, which was previously digested withSalI/XbaI. COS-7 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 2 mm glutamine. For transfection, 60–80% confluent cells were transfected with LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. After 24 h cells were harvested, and each sample was divided into two pellets for immunoblot and a DAG activity assay. The J-HM1-2.2 cell line was generated by stable transfection of the human muscarinic subtype 1 receptor in the Jurkat cell line (29Desai D. Newton M. Kadlece T. Weiss A. Nature. 1990; 348: 66-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 2 mm glutamine. Cells (1.2 × 107) were transfected by electroporation with 20 μg of DNA using a Gene Pulser (Bio-Rad) at 270 V and a capacitance of 975 microfarads. Cells were immediately transferred to 30 ml of growth medium and assayed 24 h later. Cells were resuspended in an ice-cold hypotonic buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 0.25 m sucrose) and incubated on ice for 15 min. Cells were lysed by being passed five times through a 30-gauge needle. The lysates were centrifuged at 800 ×g for 10 min to remove nuclei and cell debris, and the supernatant was collected and centrifuged at 13,000 ×g for 60 min at 4 °C. The supernatant (cytosol) and the pellet (membranes) were collected and separated by SDS-PAGE. Cells were resuspended in lysis buffer (150 mm NaCl, 10 mm NaF, 10 mmNa4P2O7, 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mmNa3VO4, 1 mm PMSF, and 10 μg/ml each aprotinin and leupeptin) and incubated (15 min on ice). After centrifugation (15,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C), the supernatants were assayed for total protein (DC protein assay, Bio-Rad), and an equivalent amount of protein of each sample was analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose, and the expression of GFP-coupled constructs was determined with an anti-GFP monoclonal antibody and the ECL detection kit (AmershamBiosciences). The pellet of transfected COS-7 cells was resuspended in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris HCl, pH 7.4, 50 mm NaF, 10 μg/ml each leupeptin and aprotinin, 1 mm PMSF, and 1 mmsodium orthovanadate), lysed by sonication, and centrifuged (800 × g, 10 min). The supernatant was removed and assayed for total protein. An equivalent amount of protein from each sample was mixed with DAG as substrate in octyl glucoside, and 32P incorporation into PA was measured. Samples were analyzed by thin layer chromatography using a chloroform, methanol, 4 m ammonia (v/v/v) (9:7:2) system. Plates were phosphorimaged in a Molecular Imager Personal FX (Bio-Rad). At 24 h after transfection, J-HM1-2.2 cells were transferred to poly-l-lysine-coated chambered coverslips (LabTek), allowed to attach for at least 15 min at 37 °C, washed, and maintained in HEPES-balanced salt solution. Stimulus was added by replacing the supernatant with a fresh solution containing the appropriate concentration of each stimulant. Cells were imaged with a laser-scanning confocal microscope (TCS-NT, Leica). A 488-nm krypton-argon laser line was used for excitation, and a 530/30 barrier filter was used for emission. Time series of images were recorded before, during, and after stimulation of the cells. Antibodies were adsorbed to microspheres by mixing 0.5 μg of antibody in PBS at 0.5 × 106 microspheres in a final volume of 1 ml and incubating (1.5 h at room temperature) it with continuous mixing; 1.5 ml of 1% bovine serum albumin in PBS was then added and mixing continued (30 min). Microspheres were washed three times with PBS and resuspended in PBS for the addition to cells. For stimulation, 106 transfected J-HM1-2.2 cells were mixed with antibody-coated beads at a 2:1 cell/bead proportion and plated on chambered coverslips. Time series of images were captured by confocal microscopy. To study the subcellular localization and dynamics of DGKζ in live T-lymphocytes, we linked the cDNA of DGKζ to the EGFP C terminus (Fig.1A) and expressed this construct (EGFP-DGKζ) in J-HM1-2.2 cells. This is a variant of the Jurkat cell line stably transfected with the human muscarinic type 1 receptor and has been used previously to examine the role of DAG on T-cell responses (29Desai D. Newton M. Kadlece T. Weiss A. Nature. 1990; 348: 66-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 30Izquierdo M. Ruiz-Ruiz M. Lopez-Rivas A. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 21-28PubMed Google Scholar). Transfection of this construct in J-HM1-2.2 and COS-7 cells induced the expression of a protein of the appropriate size with DGK activity in an in vitro assay (Fig.1B). The transfected EGFP-DGKζ was found in the supernatant after high speed centrifugation of J-HM1-2.2 cells, suggesting a true cytosolic localization of the protein as opposed to localization to vesicular membrane compartments (Fig. 1C). Fluorescent images of live J-HM1-2.2 cells showed that the cytosolic EGFP-DGKζ translocated very rapidly and almost completely to the plasma membrane following carbachol stimulation (Fig. 1E, top). By ∼90 s the majority of the protein was located at the plasma membrane, where it remained for at least 45 min after stimulation (see supplemental material, Video 1). We next analyzed whether membrane translocation required enzyme activity. To generate a DGKζ kinase-dead mutant, Gly-354 was mutated to Asp. This residue, which is found within the GGDG motif that is conserved in all DGK family members, has been shown to be essential for enzymatic activity (Fig. 1A). Mutation of this residue in the conserved cluster of the D. melanogaster DGKι induces retinal degeneration (21Masai I. Okazaki A. Hosoya T. Hotta Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 11157-11161Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Mutation of this same residue in human DGKζ has already been described as essential for enzyme activity (25Topham M.K. Bunting M. Zimmerman G.A. McIntyre T.M. Blackshear P.J. Prescott S.M. Nature. 1998; 394: 697-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). The loss of enzymatic activity by mutation of this conserved Gly is therefore a well established observation. As expected, expression of the EGFP-DGKζ (kinase-dead) mutant rendered a protein of the same weight average Mr as the wild type but with impaired activity (Fig. 1D). When examined by confocal videomicroscopy, the catalytically inactive mutant translocated to the membrane with the same kinetics as the wild type protein (Fig.1E, bottom and supplemental material, Video 2). Type IV DGKs bear several domains with a potential role as regulators of enzyme activity and/or localization. One is a highly conserved sequence between the CRDs and the catalytic domain with a similarity to the basic effector domain in MARCKS. This sequence, when expressed in COS-7 cells, translocates between the nucleus and the cytosol in a PKC-dependent manner (25Topham M.K. Bunting M. Zimmerman G.A. McIntyre T.M. Blackshear P.J. Prescott S.M. Nature. 1998; 394: 697-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). We first determined the requirement for PKC activity in enzyme translocation using specific pharmacological inhibitors. The inhibition of PKC activity by bisindolylmaleimide treatment prevented DGKζ translocation, suggesting that protein relocation is highly dependent on PCK activation (Fig.2A). We next generated mutants in which phosphorylation of the MARCKS domain was prevented (Ser → Ala; Fig. 2B) or mimicked (Ser → Asp; Fig. 2B). We verified that, when transfected, the mutants had the same weight average Mr as the wild type protein (Fig.2C). None of the mutations affected enzyme activity, suggesting that the DGKζ MARCKS domain does not participate in DAG phosphorylation (Fig. 2C). Changes in the subcellular localization of the mutants following receptor stimulation was monitored in living J-HM1-2.2 cells. The mutation of Ser residues to Ala prevented translocation of the enzyme to the membrane in response to receptor stimulation (Fig. 2D, top). On the other hand, mutations that mimicked phosphorylation allowed protein translocation to the plasma membrane with kinetics similar to that of the wild type (Fig. 2D, bottom). We thus conclude that PKC-dependent protein phosphorylation of DGKζ at the MARCKS domain is an absolute requirement for protein translocation from the cytosol to the membrane. Phosphorylation of the MARCKS domain is not the only necessary signal, however, as the EGFP-DGKζ (Ser → Asp) mutant requires receptor stimulation for membrane translocation. All DGKs have at least two CRDs of unknown function. Studies (31Sakane F. Kai M. Wada I. Imai S. Kanoh H. Biochem. J. 1996; 318: 583-590Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) of other DGK isoforms suggested that mutants lacking both CRDs are still active and have enzymatic properties similar to those of the intact enzyme. To study the role of DGKζ CRDs, a GFP-fused mutant was generated in which the entire N-terminal domain containing the two CRDs was deleted (DGKζMCA; Fig. 3A). This mutant showed unique localization when expressed in J-HM1-2.2 cells; unlike intact DGKζ, intense fluorescence was observed mainly at the nucleus with faint cytosolic fluorescence (Fig. 3B). When examined, carbachol stimulation of the cells produced no changes in the localization of the truncated enzyme (not shown). To better study the role of the CRDs, we next generated two point mutants in which the first His of each CRD, which is involved in zinc coordination, was replaced with Gly (CRD1 H98G and CRD2 H173G) (Fig.4A). These mutations were introduced in both the wild type protein and the MARCKS domain Ser → Asp mutant. All mutant proteins were the same size as the wild type and were inactive in an in vitro assay (Fig. 4B). When examined, the four mutants showed cytosolic localization (Fig.4C) similar to that found for the wild type protein. None of the mutants translocated to the plasma membrane in response to carbachol addition, however, and they remained cytosolic for the period of the stimulation procedure (Fig. 4C). This indicates that both CRDs in DGKζ are essential for PA production and membrane translocation.FIG. 4The CRDs in DGK ζ are essential for enzyme activity and carbachol-induced translocation. A, GFP-DGKζCRD1 and GFP-DGKζCRD2 constructs were generated by mutation of His-98 (CRD1) or His-173 (CRD2) to Gly in the wild type (wt) GFP-DGKζ or in the GFP-DGKζSD mutant.B, analysis of protein expression and enzyme activity. Expression of the constructs was analyzed by a Western blot of transfected COS-7 cells using an anti-GFP antibody (top). Kinase activity was assayed in cell lysates as described in the Fig.1B legend (bottom). The figure represents a typical experiment showing the autoradiogram of the TLC plate corresponding to the area of PA standard migration. C, subcellular localization of the CRD mutants. J-HM1-2.2 cells were transfected with 20 μg of the different DNAs. After 24 h, cells were mounted on poly-l-lysine-coated chambers and, where indicated, stimulated with 50 μm carbachol for 5 min prior to image capture.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Mammalian type IV DGKs are most closely related to the Drosophila DGK2, which is derived from the rdgA gene. DGK2 mutants bearing a truncation of the C-terminal ankyrin repeat show retinal degeneration, suggesting that this domain is essential for enzyme function in the retina (21Masai I. Okazaki A. Hosoya T. Hotta Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 11157-11161Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Using double hybrid technology, DGKζ was found to interact with the leptin receptor through the C-terminal domain containing the ankyrin repeats (26Liu Z. Chang G. Leibowitz S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 5900-5907Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). This C-terminal portion of the enzyme also contains a PDZ-binding motif that interacts with syntrophins (27Hogan A. Shepherd L. Chabot J. Quenneville S. Prescott S.M. Topham M. Gee S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 26526-26533Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Given the apparent relevance of these domains on functions attributed to type IV DGKs, two new EGFP-DGKζ truncation mutants were generated and used to investigate enzyme translocation following receptor stimulation. In one, the four amino acids of the PDZ-binding domain were eliminated. Another mutant was constructed by deleting the entire C-terminal region of the protein, which contains both the ankyrin repeats and the PDZ-binding motif (Fig.5A). When analyzed, both proteins were of the appropriate size, and each phosphorylated DAG in an in vitro assay, indicating that these domains are not required for enzyme activity (Fig. 5B). Our study of protein dynamics showed that neither the deletion of the entire C-terminal domain or of the PDZ-binding motif alone had any effect on protein translocation in response to carbachol (Fig.5C). We next examined whether, in addition to carbachol, a more physiological stimulus could also induce DGKζ translocation to the plasma membrane. For this, we examined GFP-DGKζ redistribution after stimulation with anti-CD3/anti-CD28 antibody-coated microspheres. GFP-PKCθ was used as a positive control of relocalization to the contact area (32Monks C. Kupfer H. Tamir I. Barlow A. Kupfer A. Nature. 1997; 385: 83-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar). Whereas PKCθ translocated consistently to the plasma membrane region at which contact with the antibody-coated beads takes place (not shown), wild type GFP-DGKζ did not translocate to the membrane under the same conditions (Fig.6A). The GFP-DGKζ Ser → Asp MARCKS mutant (not shown) also failed to relocate in response to CD3-CD28 stimulation. When the C-terminal deletion mutant GFP-DGKζΔANK was tested, however, we observed rapid translocation to the membrane, which was restricted to the area of contact with the stimulating beads (Fig. 6B). Similar results were obtained when anti-CD3-coated beads were used. This shows that, in DGKζ, the C-terminal region of the protein has a restrictive regulatory role that cannot be circumvented by the signals initiated after TCR triggering. The DGKζ C-terminal deletion mutant, lacking the PDZ-binding motif and the four ankyrin repeats, relocalizes to the TCR synapse following stimulation. This indicates the presence of some type of regulatory restriction imposed by the DGKζ C-terminal domain. The presence of ankyrin domains and a PDZ-binding sequence suggests the possibility of a protein-protein interaction through this domain. We next studied the effect of DGKζ CT expression in DGKζ translocation kinetics after carbachol stimulation. As demonstrated, carbachol addition induced rapid translocation of DGKζ, which was found at the membrane as soon as 60 s after receptor stimulation (Fig.7B, top). When DGKζ was co-expressed with the plasmid encoding the CT domain, however, translocation of the enzyme was fully prevented, and cytosolic localization was still found for the protein 2 min after stimulation (Fig. 7B, bottom).

In this study, we document that overexpression of Egr-1 activates the human PPARγ1 promoter in both VSMC and HepG2 cells. Using Northern blot analysis, we observed that growth factors and cytokines such as PDGF, bFGF, Ang II, TNFα, and IL-1β induce Egr-1 expression prior to PPARγ1 up-regulation in human VSMC. In addition, overexpression of a constitutively active form of Egr-1 by adenoviral gene transfer in VSMC dramatically induced PPARγ1 gene expression by 6–8-fold, and overexpression of NAB2, a potent negative feedback regulator of Egr-1, abrogated the growth factor- and cytokine-induced PPARγ1 expression in VSMC. Furthermore, we demonstrate with gel mobility shift and transient transfection assays that the putative Egr-1 element in the human PPARγ1promoter specifically binds Egr-1 protein and becomestrans-activated by Egr-1. Taken together, our data demonstrate for the first time that Egr-1 is necessary and sufficient to activate human PPARγ1 gene expression in VSMC.

PPARγ is found predominantly in adipose tissue where it plays a crucial role in adipocyte differentiation, fat storage, and glucose homeostasis (3Tontonoz P., Hu, E. Spiegelman B.M. Cell. 1994; 79: 1147-1156Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3076) Google Scholar). PPARγ has two subtypes, PPARγ1 and PPARγ2, which are generated from the same gene by using different promoters and alternative splicing. The two PPARγ transcripts differ in their 5′-ends where PPARγ2 encodes 30 additional amino acids to the start codon of PPARγ1 (4Fajas L. Auboeuf D. Raspe E. Schoonjans K. Lefebvre A.M. Saladin R.

PPARγ2 is selectively expressed in adipose tissue, whereas PPARγ1 is broadly distributed in many tissues including adipose tissue, heart, spleen, colon, and vasculature (6Escher P. Braissant O. Basu-Modak S. Michalik L. Wahli W. Desvergne B. Endocrinology. 2001; 142: 4194-4202Crossref Scopus (404) Google Scholar,7Mukherjee R. Jow L. Croston G.E. Paterniti J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8071-8076Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar). It is well documented that PPARγ2 gene expression is directly regulated by CCAAT/enhancer-binding proteins (C/EBPs) (8Elberg G. Gimble J.M. Tsai S.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27815-27822Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Two C/EBP binding sites were identified in the promoter of thePPARγ2 gene, whereas no such sites exist in thePPARγ1 promoter (9Shi X.M. Blair H.C. Yang X. McDonald J.M. Cao X. J. Cell. Biochem. 2000; 76: 518-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 10Clarks S.L. Robinson C.E. Gimble J.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

In recent years the role of PPARγ1 in vasculature has been intensively investigated; however, the transcriptional regulation of the PPARγ1 gene remains poorly understood. Although our previous study demonstrated that only PPARγ1 exists in human aortic smooth muscle cells (HASMC) and that platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) up-regulates PPARγ1 gene expression by PI3 kinase/Akt and MAPK-mediated signal pathways (11Fu M. Zhu X. Wang Q. Zhang J. Song Q. Zheng H. Ogawa W., Du, J. Chen Y.E. Circ. Res. 2001; 89: 1058-1064Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), the precise mechanism of PPARγ1 transcriptional regulation is still unknown. We now analyzed the human PPARγ1 promoter and found a putative binding site for early growth-response gene-1 (Egr-1) between nt −184 and −173 of the human PPARγ1 promoter, suggesting that Egr-1 may be a key mediator to regulate PPARγ1 gene expression in VSMC. Egr-1 is a DNA-binding protein containing three zinc finger motifs that regulates gene transcription by interacting with a consensus G+C-rich sequence, 5′-GCG(T/G)GGGCG-3′, also termed the GSG motif (12Milbrandt J. Science. 1987; 238: 797-799Crossref PubMed Scopus (929) Google Scholar). Structure analysis of Egr-1 identified an inhibitory domain (34 amino acids, called R1) at the 5′ zinc finger binding domain. Two corepressors, NGFI-A-binding proteins 1 and 2 (NAB1 and NAB2) can markedly decrease Egr-1 transcriptional activity by binding to this domain (13Svaren J. Sevetson B. Apel E. Zimonjic D. Popescu N. Milbrandt J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 3545-3553Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). NAB2 is a target gene of Egr-1, thus providing a negative feedback to limit Egr-1 activity (14Ehrengruber M.U. Muhlebach S.G. Sohrman S. Leutenegger C.M. Lester H.A. Davidson N. Gene. 2000; 258: 63-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), and both NAB1 and NAB2 provide useful tools to study Egr-1 function in situ. Egr-1 is a critical mediator of cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis and is rapidly and transiently induced by many growth factors and cytokines (15Sukhatme V.P. Cao X. Chang L.C. Tsai-Morris C-H. Stamenkovich D. Ferreira P.C.P. Cohen D.R. Edwards S.A. Shows T.B. Curran T. Cell. 1998; 53: 37-43Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (1016) Google Scholar). In the vasculature Egr-1 is capable of activating the transcription of several genes implicated in the pathogenesis of vascular diseases, including PDGF-A, PDGF-B, FGF-2, TNF-α, interleukin-2 (IL-2), tissue factor, and urokinase-type plasminogen activator (u-PA) (16Silverman E.S. Collins T. Am. J. Pathol. 1999; 154: 665-670Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). In turn, many of these gene products also stimulate the expression of Egr-1. These positive feedback loops serve to amplify and sustain gene transcription through Egr-1-mediated mechanisms. In this study we demonstrate that Egr-1 is the transcriptional mediator of growth factor- and cytokine-induced PPARγ1 gene expression in VSMC. Human recombinant PDGF-BB, bFGF, AngII, TNFα, and IL-1β were purchased from Sigma. PMA (phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate) and cycloheximide were also purchased from Sigma. LipofectAMINE2000 was from Invitrogen. [γ-32P]ATP and [α-32P]dCTP were obtained from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Gel mobility shift assay and luciferase assay kits were from Promega. Rabbit anti-PPARγ polyclonal antibody (sc-7196), rabbit anti-Egr-1 polyclonal antibody (sc-189), rabbit anti-NAB2 polyclonal antibody (sc-12153), goat anti-actin polyclonal antibody, and rabbit anti-c-Fos polyclonal antibody (sc-52) were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Egr-1 (sc-189x) and c-Fos (sc-52x) antibodies for supershift mobility assay were also from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. The reporter construct pGL3-γ1p3000 containing ∼3 kb of regulatory sequence of the humanPPARγ1 gene was a generous gift of Dr. J. Auwerx (IGBMC, Centre Universitaire de Strasbourg, France) (4Fajas L.

Chem. 1997; 272: 18779-18789Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1072) Google Scholar). The Egr-1 expression vector pcDNA3-Egr-1 was constructed in our laboratory. Briefly, we designed two human Egr-1 primers, 5′-tgaagcttCTCCAGCCTGCTCGTCCAGGATG-3′, which contains theHindIII linker (lowercase letters) and human Egr-1 sequence nt 251–273 of GenbankTM NM_001964 (capital letters), and 5′-cttctagaATGGCCATCTCCTCCTCCTG-TCCT-3′, which contains theXbaI linker (lowercase letters) and human Egr-1 sequence nt 1955–1978 of GenbankTM NM_001964 (capital letters). Using these two primers, we amplified an ∼1.7-kb fragment from human vascular smooth muscle cells by reverse transcriptase (RT)-PCR. This fragment was digested by HindIII and XbaI and cloned into pcDNA3.1(+). After sequencing this fragment, the resultant plasmid was designated as pcDNA3.1-Egr-1. To generate reporter constructs, synthetic three-tandem repeats of the putative Egr-1 binding sequence, 5′-ctactgtgcgcgggcggcggc-3′ of nt −189 to −169 from the human PPARγ1 promoter (GenBankTM number NT_005927.8) or its mutated sequence, 5′-ctactgtgcAcAAAcAgcggc-3′, were inserted into the promoter region of the TK-luciferase vector (Promega). The resultant plasmids were designed as pEgr-1WT×3-TK-Luc and pEgr-1Mut×3-TK-Luc respectively. The adenoviral recombinants containing constitutively active (NAB-insensitive) Egr-1 (AdGFP Egr-1*), wild type Egr-1 (Ad Egr-1), AdGFP NAB2, and the control adenoviruses AdGFP and AdLacZ were described previously (14Ehrengruber M.U.

The HepG2 cell line and the rat aortic smooth muscle cell line (A7r5) were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection and cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10%(v/v) fetal bovine serum in a 5% CO2 humidified atmosphere at 37 °C. Cycloheximide was added to the cells 30 min prior to the stimulation with growth factors or cytokines. Adenoviral infection was performed as previously described (14Ehrengruber M.U. Muhlebach S.G. Sohrman S. Leutenegger C.M. Lester H.A. Davidson N. Gene. 2000; 258: 63-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Both Northern blot and Western blot analyses were performed as previously described (11Fu M. Zhu X. Wang Q. Zhang J. Song Q. Zheng H. Ogawa W., Du, J. Chen Y.E. Circ. Res. 2001; 89: 1058-1064Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). HepG2 cells and A7r5 cells, grown to 80% confluence in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, were transiently transfected using LipofectAMINE2000 (Invitrogen) with reporter and expression plasmids as described in the figure legends. The green fluorescence protein (GFP) expression plasmid (CLONTECH CA) was co-transfected as control for transfection efficiency. The total amount of transfected DNA was kept constant by using a corresponding empty vector. 24 h after transfection cells were cultured for 24 h in serum-free medium and incubated for 6–12 h in the same medium containing appropriate reagents for experiments. A reporter luciferase assay kit (Promega) was used to measure the luciferase activity from cells according to the manufacturer's instructions with a luminometer (Victor II, PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Luciferase activity was normalized by GFP activity. Nuclear extracts were isolated from untreated HASMC or HASMC infected with Ad Egr-1 or AdLacZ using a nuclear protein isolation kit (Pierce). Nucleotide sequences of the sense strand of the double-stranded oligonucleotides were as follows: Oligo-Egr1, 5′-GGATCCAGCGGGGGCGAGCGGGGGCGA-3′ containing two consensus Egr-1 binding sites (underlined) from Santa Cruz Biotechnology; Oligo-Egr-1WT, 5′-GGGCCTACTGTGCGCGGGCGGCGGCCGAGCCC-3′ containing the putative Egr-1 binding sequence (underlined) in nt −193 to −162 of the human PPARγ1 promoter; Oligo-Egr-1Mut, 5′-GGGCCTACTGTGC tCaaaCaGCGGCCGAGCCC-3′ in which the Egr-1 site within the human PPARγ1 promoter was mutated (lowercase letters). Binding reactions for gel shift assays were performed in 20 μl of 10 mm HEPES, pH 8, 0.1 mm EDTA, 50 mm NaCl, 50 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 4 mm spermidine, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 1 μg of bovine serum albumin, 1 μg of poly deoxyinosinic-deoxycytidylic (dI-dC), and32P-labeled oligonucleotide probe (50,000 cpm) with 8 μg of nuclear extract for 30 min at room temperature. The samples were then loaded onto a 5% nondenaturating polyacrylamide gel. The gels were subjected to electrophoresis, drying, and autoradiography. For supershift assays, 2 μg of the appropriate antibody was preincubated with the crude nuclear extract for 10 min at room temperature before the labeled probe was added. For the competition assay, unlabeled competitor DNA fragments were preincubated with the parallel samples 10 min before labeled probe was added. To explore the molecular mechanisms of the transcriptional regulation of the humanPPARγ1 gene, the 5-kb sequence of the humanPPARγ1 promoter was analyzed. A 308-bp fragment of the published human PPARγ1 promoter (GenBankTM number AF012873) was used to search the human genome data base and was matched to a ∼19,000-kb DNA fragment from chromosome 3 (GenbankTM number NT_005927) to which PPARγ1 was mapped. Using TRANSFAC4.0 (17Wingender E. Chen X. Fricke E. Geffers R. Hehl R. Liebich I. Krull M. Matys V. Michael H. Ohnhauser R. Pruss M. Schacherer F. Thiele S. Urbach S.

(4Fajas L. Auboeuf D. Raspe E. Schoonjans K. Lefebvre A.M. Saladin R. Najib J. Laville M. Fruchart J.C. Deeb S. Vidal-Puig A. Flier J. Briggs M.R. Staels B. Vidal H. Auwerx J. J. Biol.

No canonical TATA box was found in the PPARγ1 promoter region close to the transcription initiation site. Interestingly, a putative Egr-1 binding site, which overlapped with an Sp1 binding site, was found between nt −184 and −173 relative to the transcription start site in thePPARγ1 promoter. Other transcription factor binding sites such as NF-AT, AP1, MyoD, and NF-κB were also identified in the humanPPARγ1 promoter. A portion (∼1.3 kb) sequence of the human PPARγ1 promoter is shown in Fig.1. To investigate which transcription factors may be involved in the regulation of the PPARγ1gene transcription, we transiently cotransfected pGL3-γ1p3000, a luciferase reporter construct driven by ∼3 kb of thePPARγ1 promoter with several expression plasmids such as pcDNA3.1-Egr-1, pcDNA3.1-FosB, pcDNA3.1-JunD, pcDNA3.1-p65, and pcDNA3.1-Smad3 into HepG2 cells or A7r5 cells. As shown in Fig. 2, overexpression of pcDNA3.1-Egr-1 increased PPARγ1 promoter activity by ∼2.5- and ∼2-fold in HepG2 and A7r5 cells, respectively. However, all other transcriptional factors tested failed to activate the human PPARγ1 promoter (data not shown).Figure 2Overexpression of Egr-1 activates the humanPPARγ1 promoter. HepG2 cells (A) and A7r5 cells (B) were co-transfected with pGL3-γP3000 and pcDNA3.1-Egr-1 or pcDNA3.1 expression plasmids. GFP reporter plasmid was used as a control for transfection efficiency.

Zhu X. Wang Q. Zhang J. Song Q. Zheng H. Ogawa W., Du, J. Chen Y.E. Circ. Res. 2001; 89: 1058-1064Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), but the precise mechanism of PPARγ1 transcriptional regulation remained unknown. The identification of a functional Egr-1 binding site in the human PPARγ1 promoter (above) led us to hypothesize that Egr-1 may be a key regulator of PPARγ1 gene expression in VSMC. Using Northern blot analyses, we found that PPARγ expression was significantly induced in HASMC by stimulation with PDGF-BB (20 ng/ml), bFGF (25 ng/ml), Ang II (3 × 10−7 mol/liter), TNFα (10 ng/ml), IL-1β (10 ng/ml) or PMA (100 ng/ml) (Fig3). Interestingly, Egr-1 expression was significantly induced at 15 min and reached the maximum level at 1 h stimulation with the above factors (Fig 3). This temporal pattern of Egr-1 and PPARγ gene expression suggests that Egr-1 is a key mediator of growth factor- and cytokine-induced PPARγ gene expression in HASMC. To define whether Egr-1 mediates the transcriptional regulation of PPARγ1 gene expression in VSMC, we used an adenoviral vector containing a constitutively active Egr-1 in which the corepressor (NAB)-binding domain is mutated (I293F). It has been documented that this mutant (named Egr-1*) of Egr-1 is NAB-insensitive and has much higher transcriptional activity than wild type Egr-1 (13Svaren J. Sevetson B. Apel E. Zimonjic D. Popescu N. Milbrandt J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 3545-3553Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar, 14Ehrengruber M.U. Muhlebach S.G. Sohrman S. Leutenegger C.M. Lester H.A. Davidson N. Gene. 2000; 258: 63-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). In addition, the adenovirus AdGFP Egr-1* expresses the GFP reporter gene to monitor successful infection. Using Western blot analysis, we confirmed that Egr-1 was overexpressed in HASMC, which were infected with AdGFP Egr-1* (Fig. 4A). Interestingly, as shown in Fig. 4B, PPARγ mRNA levels were dramatically up-regulated by ∼8-fold in HASMC infected with AdGFP Egr-1* (15 plaque-forming units (pfu)/cell), whereas the control adenovirus AdGFP did not affect PPARγ gene expression. In addition, we used different titers of AdGFP Egr-1* (1, 5, and 10 pfu/cell) to infect the cells. As shown in Fig. 4C, Egr-1* overexpression increased PPARγ1 gene expression in a concentration-dependent manner. Taken together our data demonstrate that Egr-1 activates PPARγ1 gene expression in HASMC. NAB2 is a corepressor of Egr-1; it binds to the R1 region of Egr-1 protein and inhibits the transcriptional function of Egr-1 (13Svaren J. Sevetson B. Apel E. Zimonjic D. Popescu N. Milbrandt J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 3545-3553Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). To further determine whether Egr-1 is the mediator of the growth factor- and cytokine-induced PPARγ1 gene expression in HASMC, cells infected with the NAB2 adenovirus (AdGFP NAB2) or control virus (AdGFP) at 5 pfu/cell were stimulated with PDGF-BB, bFGF, AngII, TNFα, IL-1β, or PMA for 2 h respectively. Then, total RNA was isolated from these cells for Northern blot analyses. As shown in Fig.5, overexpression of NAB2 abrogated PPARγ1 induction by all of above growth factors and cytokines. Taken together, these results provide the first evidence that Egr-1 is a critical mediator of PPARγ1 gene expression induced by growth factors and cytokines. To determine whether the inducible PPARγ1 gene expression is dependent on de novo protein synthesis in HASMC, the cells were pretreated with cycloheximide (10 μg/ml), a potent protein synthesis inhibitor, or vehicle for 30 min and then stimulated with PDGF-BB (10 ng/ml), PMA (100 ng/ml), or vehicle for 2 h. As shown in Fig. 6, both PDGF- and PMA-induced PPARγ1 mRNA expression were dramatically decreased by cycloheximide. Interestingly, cycloheximide alone marginally increased PPARγ1 gene expression in HASMC. Taken together, our data demonstrate that inducible PPARγ1 gene expression requiresde novo protein synthesis, which provides further support for Egr-1 being a critical mediator of PPARγ1 up-regulation through growth factors and cytokines. To examine whether the putative Egr-1 binding site in the human PPARγ1 promoter is a functional response element, we inserted three copies of the wild type and a mutated Egr-1 element into a vector encoding luciferase under the control of a minimal thymidine kinase (TK) promoter (Fig.7A). Cotransfection of the wild type reporter (pEgr-1WTx3-Luc) with pcDNA3.1-Egr-1 into HepG2 cells (Fig. 7B) or A7r5 cells (Fig. 7C) significantly enhanced the luciferase activity, whereas the mutant reporter failed to respond to overexpressed Egr-1. These results indicate that the putative Egr-1 binding site in the humanPPARγ1 promoter is a functional response element for Egr-1. In addition, PDGF significantly increased luciferase activity driven by the wild type Egr-1 elements in A7r5 cells, but it failed to activate the luciferase reporter downstream of the mutated Egr-1 elements (Fig. 7D). These results suggest that the Egr-1 binding site can mediate PDGF-induced transcriptional events. Having demonstrated that the putative Egr-1 element is responsible for transcriptional induction of PPARγ1 by PDGF, we next examined whether this element specifically binds to Egr-1. The following three double-stranded oligonucleotides were radiolabeled and subjected to a gel mobility shift assay: 1) an Egr-1 probe containing two consensus Egr-1 binding sites (purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology), 2) a fragment of the humanPPARγ1 promoter containing the wild type Egr-1 binding site (Egr1-WT), and 3) a fragment of the human PPARγ1promoter with a mutated Egr-1 binding site (Egr-1Mut). As shown in Fig.8A, a DNA-protein complex was retarded when the Santa Cruz Egr-1 probe or the Egr-1WT probe were incubated with nuclear extracts from HASMC infected with adenovirus expressing the wild type Egr-1 (AdEgr-1). This complex, however, did not form when the Egr-1Mut probe containing no functional Egr-1 site was used. In addition, only a faint band was observed when the Santa Cruz Egr-1 probe was incubated with nuclear extracts from untreated HASMC or HASMC that had been infected with control adenovirus expressing E. coli β-galactosidase (AdLacZ; Fig. 8A, lanes 3, 7, and 11). To confirm that the aforementioned complex was specifically formed by the interaction between Egr-1 protein and the Egr-1 binding element, we performed a competitive gel mobility shift assay. As shown in Fig. 8B, complex formation was abrogated by a 10-, 50-, and 200-fold excess of unlabeled Egr-1WT probe. Furthermore, an anti-Egr-1 antibody also abolished this complex formation, whereas an anti-c-Fos antibody did not affect it (Fig. 8C). Taken together, these results demonstrate that Egr-1 protein specifically binds to the putative Egr-1 site in the human PPARγ1 promoter. It has been well documented that all major cells of the vasculature including endothelial cells, VSMC, and monocytes/macrophages express PPARγ and that PPARγ levels are substantially elevated in the neointima of injured vessels and in atherosclerotic lesions (18Law R.E. Goetze S., Xi, X.P. Jackson S. Kawano Y. Demer L. Fishbein M.C. Meehan W.P. Hsueh W.A. Circulation. 2000; 101: 1311-1318Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar, 19Recote M. Huang J.

However, the regulation and downstream effects of PPARγ expression in pathologic vasculature are poorly defined. We previously demonstrated that PPARγ1 rather than PPARγ2 is expressed in vascular HASMC and that PDGF can up-regulate PPARγ1 gene expression via PI3 kinase/Akt and MAPK signal pathways in VSMC (11Fu M. Zhu X. Wang Q. Zhang J. Song Q. Zheng H. Ogawa W., Du, J. Chen Y.E. Circ. Res. 2001; 89: 1058-1064Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). However, the precise transcriptional mechanisms of PPARγ1 regulation remained unknown. In the present study we analyzed the humanPPARγ1 promoter and found a putative Egr-1 binding site at nt −184 to −173. In addition, we demonstrated that Egr-1 is the major transcriptional mediator of growth factor- and cytokine-induced PPARγ1 gene expression in VSMC. It has been noted that the Egr-1 protein in the vasculature is rapidly and transiently induced by various growth factors and other extracellular signals (20Santiago F.S. Lowe H. Day F.

In this report, we confirmed that growth factors and cytokines including PDGF, bFGF, Ang II, TNFα, IL-1β, and PMA up-regulated Egr-1 mRNA expression as early as 15 min upon stimulation, reaching maximal levels after 1 h. In addition, our data show that growth factor- and cytokine-induced Egr-1 mRNA expression in VSMC occurs prior to PPARγ1 mRNA expression, suggesting that Egr-1 may be the transcriptional mediator of PPARγ1 expression. By overexpressing a constitutively active Egr-1 mutant in VSMC using adenoviral gene transfer, PPARγ1 mRNA expression was dramatically induced by 6–8-fold, whereas overexpression of NAB2, a potent repressor of Egr-1, abrogated growth factor- and cytokine-induced PPARγ1 expression in HASMC. In addition, we demonstrate that the putative Egr-1 element in the humanPPARγ1 promoter specifically binds to Egr-1 protein and is functional. Taken together, our data provide the first evidence that Egr-1 is both necessary and sufficient to activate human PPARγ1 expression in VSMC. It has been known that gene transcription activation/repression not only involves transcriptional factors but also co-activators/co-repressors. Several cofactors of Egr-1 have been described. These include proteins such as p300 that has a required intrinsic containing histone acetyltransferases (HATs) activity for co-activation. The activities of these HATs loosen the interaction between histones and DNA, allowing the transcription factors to access promoters and response elements of DNA and initiate transcription. Although studies on chromatin remodeling complexes are necessary to further understand the molecular mechanisms of PPARγ gene expression mediated by Egr-1, this is beyond the scope of the present study. PPARγ has two subtypes, PPARγ1 and PPARγ2, which are generated from the same gene by two different promoters and alternate splicing. PPARγ2 has an N-terminal extension of 30 amino acids and is expressed selectively in adipose tissue, whereas PPARγ1 is present in many tissues including adipose tissue, heart, spleen, colon, and vasculature (4Fajas L. Auboeuf D. Raspe E. Schoonjans K. Lefebvre A.M. Saladin R. Najib J. Laville M. Fruchart J.C. Deeb S. Vidal-Puig A. Flier J. Briggs M.R. Staels B. Vidal H. Auwerx J. J. Biol.

A. 1995; 92: 7921-7925Crossref PubMed Scopus (596) Google Scholar). The experiments in this study were performed in human VSMC. It remains to be tested whether PPARγ1 expression is also Egr-1 dependent in the other tissues or cell types. As Egr-1 is coexpressed in tissues that express PPARγ1 (12Milbrandt J. Science. 1987; 238: 797-799Crossref PubMed Scopus (929) Google Scholar), it is possible that Egr-1 also mediates PPARγ1 expression in those tissues and cell types. In support of this hypothesis, we document that Egr-1 also activates thePPARγ1 gene in HepG2 cells (see Fig. 2A). With regard to species selectivity, it remains to be noted that the mousePPARγ1 promoter also contains an Egr-1 binding site (GenBankTM number S79403). To date, Egr-1 is capable of activating the transcription of several genes implicated in the pathogenesis of vascular diseases including PDGF-A (23Khachigian, L. M., Williams, A.

These positive feedback loops serve to amplify and sustain gene transcription through Egr-1-mediated mechanisms. Recently, there is increasing evidence that PPARγ activation in vascular cells inhibits production of cytokines, including TNF-α (30Takano H. Nagai T. Asakawa M. Toyozaki T. Oka T. Komuro I. Saito T. Masuda Y. Circ. Res. 2000; 87: 596-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar) and IL-2 (31Delerive P., De Bosscher K. Besnard S. Vanden Berghe W. Peters J.M. Gonzalez F.J. Fruchart J.C.

As Egr-1 mediates PPARγ1 expression in VSMC (this study), we hypothesize that PPARγ1 up-regulation through Egr-1 exerts a negative feedback to inhibit expression or/and signaling pathways of growth factors or cytokines (Fig. 9). We are currently examining this hypothesis in vivo by using Egr-1-deficient mice. Interestingly, a recent paper documented that chronic down-regulation of CREB rather than its rapid activation actually drives VSMC growth, although, CREB has been shown to undergo rapid and transient activation by various growth factors in VSMC (37Klemm D.J. Watson P.A. Frid M.G. Dempsey E.C. Schaack J. Colton L.A. Nesterova A. Stenmark K.R. Reusch J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 46132-46141Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Therefore, increased vascular CREB content could be another mechanism leading to inhibit VSMC proliferation and migration in addition to PPARγ. It will be interesting to study the relationship between PPARγ and CREB in vasculature. Although we defined Egr-1 as a key mediator of inducible PPARγ1 expression, we cannot exclude that other transcription factors may also be involved in the regulation of PPARγ1 gene expression. Egr-1 binding sites are always overlapping with Sp1 binding sites. In vitro studies using recombinant proteins suggest that Egr-1 and Sp1 can displace each other from many promoters, and their binding depends on an equilibrium between their concentration within the nucleus and affinity for the binding site (16Silverman E.S. Collins T. Am. J. Pathol. 1999; 154: 665-670Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). We also note that the Egr-1 binding site in the human PPARγ1 promoter overlaps with an Sp1 binding site. Transient transfection studies show that Sp1 has a moderate effect on the human PPARγ1 promoter; however, Sp1 mRNA is almost undetectable by Northern blot analysis in human VSMC (data not shown). It will still be interesting to examine the relationship between Egr-1 and Sp1 in regulating the humanPPARγ1 promoter in other types of cells. In conclusion, our results provide the first evidence that Egr-1 is both necessary and sufficient for human PPARγ1 expression and is a critical mediator of growth factor- and cytokine-induced PPARγ1 expression in vasculature. Up-regulation of PPARγ1 may function as a negative feedback to inhibit expression or/and signaling pathways of growth factors or cytokines in VSMC. This study is thus important for the understanding of the biological roles of PPARγ1 in vasculature."

Repression is mediated through two independent domains at the N and C terminus of the protein, both of which can independently recruit the corepressors Mi-2β, Sin3A, and Sin3B and the Class I histone deacetylases 1 and 2; the N-terminal domain can also associate with the corepressor CtBP. Here we describe a detailed dissection of these two domains and identify the minimal repression modules and the corepressor requirements for their activity. Based on these studies, we describe mutations in a full-length Ikaros protein that abrogate interactions with each of the identified corepressors and abolish the protein's function as a repressor. Finally, we show that, barring CtBP, the Ikaros family members Aiolos, Helios, and Eos can associate with all of the identified corepressors of Ikaros including its newly identified interactors, Class II HDACs.

The most full-length form of all these proteins is characterized by an N-terminal zinc finger DNA binding domain (6Hahm K. Ernst P., Lo, K. Kim G.S. Turck C. Smale S.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 7111-7123Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar, 7Molnár A. Georgopoulos K. Mol. Cell.

Liu A. Georgopoulos K. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5358-5369Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). Ikaros is comprised of seven exons from which at least eight isoforms (Ik1–8) can be generated through alternate splicing of exons 3–6 (6Hahm K. Ernst P., Lo, K. Kim G.S. Turck C. Smale S.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 7111-7123Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar, 7Molnár A. Georgopoulos K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 785-794Google Scholar). Exons 3–5 contain the DNA-binding zinc fingers, and their varying utilization results in Ikaros isoforms that can be distinguished by their ability to bind DNA (6Hahm K. Ernst P., Lo, K. Kim G.S. Turck C. Smale S.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 7111-7123Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar, 7Molnár A. Georgopoulos K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 785-794Google Scholar). The non-DNA-binding Ikaros isoforms, such as Ik6 and Ik7, interfere with the function of the DNA-binding forms and thereby can function as naturally occurring dominant-negative proteins (8Sun L. Liu A. Georgopoulos K. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5358-5369Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). Mutations in the murine Ikaros and Aiolos loci, which prevent their expression and/or which exclusively generate dominant-negative proteins, have firmly established the importance of these genes in hemo-lymphoid development, differentiation, and homeostasis (9Georgopoulos K.

Ikaros and all its isoforms are capable of potent repression when tethered upstream of a promoter through a heterologous DNA-binding domain. Repression is effected through two domains found at the N and C terminus of the protein and, in some promoter contexts, depends upon the activity of histone deacetylases (HDACs)1 (13Koipally J. Renold A. Kim J. Georgopoulos K. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3090-3100Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). It is widely presumed that HDACs contribute to repression by deacetylating lysines found at the N-terminal tails of histones H3 and H4 thereby facilitating a compact, closed chromatin configuration that is non-permissive for transcription (14Ahringer J. Trends Genet. 2000; 16: 351-356Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). HDAC proteins can be divided into at least three different classes based on sequence homology, expression, localization, and cofactor requirements: HDACs 1, 2, 3, and 8 comprise Class I, HDACs 4–7 belong to Class II, and SIRT 1–7 are members of Class III (15Gray S.G. Ekstrom T.J. Exp. Cell Res. 2001; 262: 75-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar). Class I HDACs are nuclear and largely ubiquitous, whereas Class II HDACs are cytoplasmic (until they receive appropriate signals, whereupon they are imported to the nucleus) and more tissue-restricted (15Gray S.G. Ekstrom T.J. Exp. Cell Res. 2001; 262: 75-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar). Class III proteins are NAD+-dependent histone deacetylases, which may also be involved in other histone modulating functions like ubiquitination (15Gray S.G. Ekstrom T.J. Exp. Cell Res. 2001; 262: 75-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar). In mammalian cells, Class I HDACs are primarily recruited to target genes through corepressor complexes containing either Sin3A, Sin3B (14Ahringer J.

Both the Sin3 and Mi-2β proteins interact with a core complex containing the Class I HDACs 1 and 2 and the Rb-associated proteins (RbAp), RbAp46 and RbAp48, but differ in the other proteins that they each associate with (14Ahringer J.

Here, we provide a detailed characterization of these two repression domains and identify the minimal regions within them that are required for repression and the corepressors that contribute to their function. We also describe mutations that prevent interactions with each of these corepressors and which can convert the strongest transcriptional repressor of the Ikaros isoforms, Ik6, into a transcriptionally neutral protein. Finally, we show that, with the exception of CtBP, all Ikaros family members are capable of interactions with the identified corepressors of Ikaros, which suggests that they too may play a role in gene repression. Deletion mutations of the N- and C-terminal repression domains (IKD2 and IKD4) of Ik1 and deletion mutants of Ik6 were generated by cloning the relevant regions into the BXG1 vector, which encodes the Gal4 DNA binding domain (DBD) (amino acids 1–147) under the control of the SV40 promoter or into a CDM8Flag vector. CDM8-Ik1, -Flag-Aio3, -Flag-Helios, -Flag-Eos (Daedalus), -Mi2β, -MT-Sin3A, -HA-Sin3B, pCMV2-FlagIk1, -FlagIk1 cm, BXG1-Ik6, and the reporter G5tkCAT have been previously reported (13Koipally J.

Lazar, and HA-HDAC5 and -HDAC7 were provided by Dr. R. Evans. 293T and NIH3T3 cell lines were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone). Transfections of these cell lines were carried out using the HBS-CaP04 method. For repression assays, 1 μg of the Gal4 fusion plasmid, 10 μg of the Gal4 reporter plasmid, and 0.5 μg of the pXGH5 growth hormone transfection efficiency control plasmid were used. Twenty-four hours after transfection, cells were fed with fresh media, and 18–24 h later cells were harvested and processed for CAT assays as described (8Sun L. Liu A. Georgopoulos K. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5358-5369Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). Growth hormone assays were done as recommended by the manufacturer (Nichols Institute). Transfections were typically performed in duplicate and repeated between three and six times. Whole cell extracts from 293T cells transfected with the relevant plasmids were prepared as previously described (8Sun L. Liu A. Georgopoulos K. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5358-5369Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar) and precleared using protein-G-agarose beads (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The precleared extracts were incubated with the antibody of interest or the relevant isotype control on ice for 1 h. 30 μl of protein-G beads were then added to the extract, and the extracts were rotated overnight. The beads were collected by centrifugation and washed four times with TS buffer (150 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5). The beads obtained after this procedure were treated with SDS sample buffer, boiled at 95 °C for 15 min, and loaded on an SDS-polyacrylamide gel along with 8–10% of the cell extract used for the immunoprecipitation. The proteins were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane, probed with the relevant antibody, and examined by autoradiography with ECL (Amersham Biosciences). Antibodies used were: Myc tag (MT) (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), HA (BabCO), FLAG M2 (Sigma), Gal4, Sin3B (Santa Cruz), HDAC2 (Zymed Laboratories Inc.), and anti-Ikaros and Mi-2, which have been previously described (22Kim J. Sif S. Jones B. Jackson A. Koipally J. Heller B. Winandy S. Veil A. Sawyer A. Ikeda T. Kingston R. Georgopoulos K. Immunity. 1999; 10: 345-355Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar). We have previously shown the existence of two repression domains in Ikaros namely, IKD2 and IKD4 (see Fig.1 A, constructs 2and 14 respectively) (13Koipally J. Renold A. Kim J. Georgopoulos K. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3090-3100Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). To delineate the minimal regions capable of repression within these two domains, we constructed a series of N- and C-terminal deletions in the context of the Gal4 DBD. Each of these constructs was first tested for expression (Fig. 1 B) and then transfected together with a thymidine kinase promoter-CAT reporter engineered with five Gal4 binding sites (G5tkCAT) into NIH3T3 cells to assay the ability of the encoded proteins to repress transcription. The N-terminal repression domain, IKD2, and all of its deletion derivatives were capable of repression, albeit to differing levels (Fig. 1 A, constructs 2–11). Repression was maximal when all four N-terminal zinc fingers were present; however, deleting all four N-terminal zinc fingers still permitted the resulting region to repress transcription (Fig. 1 A, construct 8). In contrast, not all derivatives of the C-terminal repression domain function as repressors (Fig. 1 A, constructs 12–20); the region containing the two C-terminal zinc fingers was essential for repression. Mutation of these zinc fingers, either by point mutations that alter their ability to dimerize or by deletion of one or both fingers, reduces or abolishes the repressive function of this region (Fig. 1 A, compare construct 12 to13; 14 to 15 and 16; and17 to 18 and 19). However, a region comprising the C-terminal zinc fingers was, by itself, only capable of modest repression (Fig. 1 A, construct 20). This region may need to operate in the context of a larger domain and thus not function effectively when directly tethered to the Gal4 DBD. In summary, the N-and C-terminal repression domains of Ikaros can be distinguished by the behavior of their deletion derivatives; the former is comprised of several smaller apparently redundant repression modules, whereas the latter is critically dependent on one region that contains the C-terminal zinc fingers. In previous reports we have shown that Ikaros is a component of the Mi-2β/nucleosome remodeling and deacetylation complex and Sin3-HDAC chromatin-modifying complexes in lymphocytes (13Koipally J. Renold A. Kim J. Georgopoulos K. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3090-3100Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar, 22Kim J. Sif S. Jones B. Jackson A. Koipally J. Heller B. Winandy S. Veil A. Sawyer A. Ikeda T. Kingston R. Georgopoulos K. Immunity. 1999; 10: 345-355Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar); in addition, it also interacts with the corepressor CtBP (23Koipally J. Georgopoulos K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19594-19602Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). We set out to examine whether these interactions were responsible for the activity of the Ikaros N- and C-terminal repression regions. The N-terminal Ikaros repression domain, IKD2, can interact with the corepressors, Sin3A (Fig. 2 A), Sin3BSF (B), Mi-2β (C), HDAC2 (D), and CtBP (23Koipally J. Georgopoulos K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19594-19602Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). C-terminal deletions of this domain altered its interactions with the Mi-2β and Sin3 proteins; in particular, removal of the third and fourth zinc fingers severely compromised interactions with Mi-2β (Figs. 1 A and 2 C, compare IKD2B to IKD2C) and Sin3 proteins (Figs. 1 A and 2, A andB, compare IKD2 to IKD2C and IKD2D). N-terminal deletions of IKD2 that left all four zinc fingers intact had no effect on Mi-2β (Figs. 1 A and 2 C, IKD13 and -14) but did have a small effect on Sin3 interactions (Fig. 2 A, IKD14). Interestingly, the deletion mutants, which were unable to interact with Sin3 and Mi-2β, were still capable of repression (see Fig.1 A, IKD2C; Fig. 2 D, N1, N2, and IKD15). This may be due to their ability to still interact with HDAC2 (Figs.1 A and 2 D) and CtBP1 (Fig. 1 A). CtBP1 was previously shown to interact with Ikaros through a PEDLS motif (23Koipally J. Georgopoulos K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19594-19602Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar), which is located upstream of the Sin3 and Mi-2β interaction domains. Nonetheless, deletion of the CtBP interaction motif in the context of a region that contained the Sin3 and Mi2β interaction interfaces had minimal effects on the repressive activity of the resulting region (Fig. 1 A, IKD13, IKD14). Finally, a deletion designed to abrogate CtBP, Sin3, and Mi-2β interactions at the N-terminal region of Ikaros was still capable of repression (Fig.1 A, IKD15); however, this deletion mutant was still capable of interactions with HDAC2 (Fig. 1 A, construct 11; Fig. 2D). The C-terminal repression domain, IKD4, also interacted with Sin3 (Fig.2, A and B) and Mi-2β and HDAC2 (Fig.2 D) but not with CtBP. A 97-amino acid module spanning residues 361–457, located upstream of the self-interaction zinc fingers (Fig. 2 B, IKD8), could support Sin3 interactions; interestingly, this region was incapable of repression (Fig.1 A, constructs 13, 16 and19). The smallest region capable of interaction with the chromatin remodeler, Mi-2β, at the C terminus was mapped previously by yeast two-hybrid assays and spans amino acids 457–518, which contain the two self-interaction fingers of Ikaros; deletion mutants of this region are unable to repress. This is in contrast to the N-terminal subregions that are unable to interact with Mi-2β but which are still capable of repression (Fig. 1 A, compareconstruct 4 to 5 and 7). HDAC2 interactions at the C terminus resemble those of Mi-2β but not Sin3: HDAC2 interacts with IKD5, which interacts with Mi-2β but not with IKD8, which interacts with Sin3 (Fig. 1 A). Thus, HDAC2 may be recruited to the C terminus of Ikaros through Mi-2β and not Sin3. Taken together these data indicate that Ikaros contains several distinct interaction interfaces for corepressor molecules (shown over the Ikaros schematic in Fig. 1 A). The N-terminal half of the Ikaros protein contains sites that promote binding of Sin3, Mi-2β, HDAC2, and CtBP. Mutations that ablate any one of these corepressor interaction interfaces compromise, but do not ablate, the repression potential of this region. Thus there is an apparent redundancy for repressor function in this part of the molecule. In contrast, although the C-terminal half of the Ikaros protein can also bind Sin3, Mi-2β, and HDAC2, repression activity appears to rely predominantly on the C-terminal interaction zinc fingers, which are part of the Mi-2β and HDAC2 but not the Sin3 interaction interface. Having identified regions of the Ikaros protein with the potential to repress and interact with its known corepressors, we set out to determine the role of a subset of these putative interaction interfaces in the context of the smallest full-length Ikaros protein, the Ik6 isoform. Ik6 represents a subclass of Ikaros isoforms that lack a DNA binding domain and which have been implicated in leukemogenesis (10Winandy S., Wu, P. Georgopoulos K. Cell. 1995; 83: 289-299Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). Therefore, delineating the transcriptional functions of this Ikaros isoform could be important in dissecting its role in leukemogenesis. Interestingly, Ik6 is the strongest repressor of all Ikaros isoforms when recruited to DNA through a heterologous DNA binding domain (13Koipally J. Renold A. Kim J. Georgopoulos K. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3090-3100Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). A series of Ik6 deletion mutants were generated (Fig.3 C) and tested for their ability to interact with the corepressors of Ikaros. Deletion of 33 amino acids within the 97-amino acid region identified as the C-terminal Sin3 interaction module (Fig. 1 A, IKD8), abolished interactions of Ik6 with Sin3A, Sin3B, and Sin3BSF without affecting interactions with Mi-2β or HDAC2 (Fig. 3, A andC, M6, and data not shown). A different deletion in the region encompassing the two C-terminal zinc fingers of Ikaros abolished interactions with Mi-2β and dramatically reduced interactions with HDAC2 (Fig. 3 B and C, M17). We have previously shown that a mutation of the PEDLS motif at the N terminus of Ikaros ablates its interactions with the corepressor CtBP (23Koipally J. Georgopoulos K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19594-19602Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Given that Ik6 lacks a DNA binding domain, its corepressor interaction mutants were tested for their ability to repress transcription in the context of the Gal4 DBD. The CtBP interaction mutant (M1) was impaired by over 50% compared with wild type in its ability to repress transcription, while the Sin3 interaction mutant (M6) was only modestly affected (Fig. 4). A mutation that abolished Mi-2β binding and significantly altered HDAC2 association (M17) could repress to only 20% of wild type levels (Fig. 4). When this mutation was combined with one that prevented CtBP interaction (M18), repression was completely abolished (Fig. 4). Thus, Mi-2β, HDAC2, and CtBP appear to play key roles in Ik6-mediated repression. Mutations that prevent Ikaros interactions with self and family, M12, M14, and M15, also decreased repression. As these mutations do not appear to affect interactions with Mi-2β, HDAC2, and presumably CtBP (Fig. 3, B and C), decreased repression may result from an altered Ik6/corepressor configuration that prevents efficient repression, or alternatively, these mutants may be defective in interactions with other yet-to-be identified Ikaros corepressors. Ikaros is the prototype of a family of transcription factors that exhibit a restricted pattern of expression in hemopoietic, neuronal, and epithelial tissues (2Morgan B. Sun L. Avitahl N.

Kawabata I. Ikeda H. Wanaka A. FEBS Lett. 1999; 447: 76-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The non-hemopoietic Ikaros family members may play a similar role to Ikaros in the developmental systems where they are present. We therefore examined whether the Ikaros corepressor interactions were conserved between its family members. Aiolos, Helios, and Eos were expressed either alone or in combination with a subset of corepressors. Using immunoprecipitation assays, we found that all Ikaros family members could interact with ectopically expressed Sin3A (Fig. 5 A) and Sin3B (B) and endogenous Mi-2β (C) and Class I HDAC2 (D). Since our initial description of Ikaros interactions with Class I HDACs, other classes of HDACs have been identified that also function in repression. Ikaros and all its family members were tested for interactions with Class II HDACs. All Ikaros family members interacted best with HDAC5 (Fig. 5 E) and to a lesser but differing extent with HDACs 4 and 7; Helios interactions with these HDACs are almost undetectable, whereas Eos interacts with them most strongly among the Ikaros family (Fig. 5 E). We also compared binding of Ikaros with the two classes of HDACs. Ik1 was co-transfected with the Class I HDACs 1 and 3 or the Class II HDACs 4, 5, and 7. Immunoprecipitation assays revealed that Ikaros interacted more strongly with Class I HDACs compared with any of the Class II members (Fig. 5 F). In summary, Ikaros family members can interact with all of the identified corepressors of Ikaros except CtBP. Thus, they too may play a role in gene repression. In agreement with this expectation, both Aiolos (13Koipally J. Renold A. Kim J. Georgopoulos K. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3090-3100Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar) and Eos (27Perdomo J. Holmes M. Chong B. Crossley M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38347-38354Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), like Ikaros, have been shown to be capable of repression. We have previously shown that Ikaros can function as a potent repressor when recruited to promoters through a heterologous DNA binding domain (13Koipally J. Renold A. Kim J. Georgopoulos K. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3090-3100Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). This function, at least in certain contexts, is mediated through the action of histone deacetylases (13Koipally J. Renold A. Kim J. Georgopoulos K. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3090-3100Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). Consistent with this observation, Ikaros has been shown to be associated with at least two distinct HDAC complexes containing the corepressors Mi-2β and Sin3, respectively (13Koipally J. Renold A. Kim J. Georgopoulos K. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3090-3100Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar, 22Kim J. Sif S. Jones B. Jackson A. Koipally J. Heller B. Winandy S. Veil A. Sawyer A. Ikeda T. Kingston R. Georgopoulos K. Immunity. 1999; 10: 345-355Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar). Ikaros also interacts with the corepressor CtBP, which despite associating with HDACs, can repress transcription in an HDAC activity-independent manner (23Koipally J. Georgopoulos K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19594-19602Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). In an effort to determine the role of these corepressor interactions in Ikaros-mediated repression, we undertook a detailed molecular analysis of the repression domains of Ikaros. These studies have allowed the delineation of the minimal repression modules of Ikaros and the corepressor interactions required for their function. Integrating these findings in the context of the potent transcriptional repressor, Ik6, we report the successful construction of the first repression-defective Ikaros protein. A systematic dissection of the two Ikaros repression domains has allowed the identification of interaction interfaces on Ikaros for its corepressors (see Fig. 1 A). We have previously shown that CtBP1 binds Ikaros through a PEDLS motif within the N-terminal repression domain (23Koipally J. Georgopoulos K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19594-19602Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Unlike CtBP, the Sin3, Mi-2β, and HDAC2 corepressors associate with Ikaros through modules in both the N- and C-terminal repression domains. At the N terminus, Sin3 and Mi-2β interact with a region spanning the DNA-binding zinc fingers, while HDAC2 associates with all N-terminal subregions tested to date (albeit to differing levels) indicating that it can directly bind or be recruited to Ikaros through independent strategies. At the C terminus, Mi-2β and HDAC2 interactions with Ikaros are dependent on the region spanning the zinc fingers involved in dimerization, whereas Sin3 binds a region immediately adjacent to this region. Interestingly, unlike Ikaros and its family members, both Mi-2β and HDAC2 do not require the dimerization function of the C-terminal zinc fingers to associate with Ikaros. The interactions of Mi-2β, HDAC2, and Sin3 with the region spanning the DBD of Ikaros and of Mi-2β and HDAC2 with the dimerization module open up the possibility that they may be involved in modulating the functions of these domains. In agreement with the corepressor interaction modules described above, the N-terminal repression domain, IKD2, can be broken into smaller subregions, all of which can repress transcription, whereas the C-terminal domain, IKD4, can only function effectively when the region spanning the two C-terminal zinc fingers are intact. Interestingly, the tricho-rhino-phalangeal syndrome protein 1 (TRPS1), which contains two zinc fingers with extensive homology to those at the C terminus of Ikaros (24Momeni P. Glockner G. Schmidt O. von Holtum D. Albrecht B. Gillessen-Kaesbach G. Hennekam R. Meinecke P. Zabel B. Rosenthal A. Horsthemke B. Ludecke H.J. Nat. Genet. 2000; 24: 71-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar), also cannot repress transcription when this domain is deleted (25Malik T.H. Shoichet S.A. Latham P. Kroll T.G. Peters L.L. Shivdasani R.A. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1715-1725Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Thus, the C-terminal zinc finger domain, which is found in proteins as early as Drosophila hunchback (26Georgopoulos K. Moore D. Derfler B. Science. 1992; 258: 808-812Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar) and in proteins otherwise unrelated to Ikaros such as Pegasus (27Perdomo J. Holmes M. Chong B. Crossley M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38347-38354Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) and TRPS1 (24Momeni P. Glockner G. Schmidt O. von Holtum D. Albrecht B. Gillessen-Kaesbach G. Hennekam R. Meinecke P. Zabel B. Rosenthal A. Horsthemke B. Ludecke H.J. Nat. Genet. 2000; 24: 71-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar), appears to be an evolutionarily conserved module involved in dimerization as well as gene repression. Repression mediated by each subregion of the two repression domains of Ikaros correlated with their interactions with at least one of the corepressors of Ikaros. In the context of the N-terminal repression domain, subregions that could not interact with CtBP, Sin3, or Mi-2β individually or in combination were not defective for repression; this can be explained by the fact that HDAC2 could interact with all tested N-terminal subregions. Alternatively, or in addition, unidentified corepressors may contribute to the redundancy of repression function that exists for this domain. In contrast, subregions at the C terminus that could not associate with Mi-2β and HDAC2 were defective for repression. Thus, the N- and C-terminal repression domains of Ikaros have significantly different corepressor requirements for repressive function. Another interesting observation from these studies was that several subregions that interacted with the corepressor Sin3 were incapable of supporting repression (IKD11, IKD4B, IKD8). This suggests that corepressor interaction per se is insufficient, in some cases, for repression; in these instances the corepressors may need to be assembled into a higher order complex (for which other regions are presumably required) to effectively turn off gene expression. Alternatively, Sin3 may play a role different from transcriptional repression in the context of Ikaros. Based on these collective findings, we targeted mutations in the smallest and most potent Ikaros isoform, Ik6, to construct a repression-defective Ikaros protein. A mutation in Ik6 that prevented the corepressor Sin3 from binding Ikaros had only minimal effects on repression. In contrast, a mutation that abrogated CtBP binding reduced repression by 50%. A deletion of the C-terminal zinc fingers, which abolished Mi-2β binding and also dramatically reduced HDAC2 association, brought repression down to 20% of wild type levels. When this mutation was coupled with one that prevented CtBP interactions, the resulting protein was completely incapable of repressing transcription. Taken together, these data highlight the importance of the dimerization module for Ik6 to repress transcription and also suggests that this isoform likely effects repression through the combinatorial action of Mi-2β, HDAC2, and CtBP. In contrast to the results obtained for Ik6, mutations of the C-terminal zinc fingers in the context of the most full-length Ikaros isoform, Ik1, had no significant impact on repression (13Koipally J. Renold A. Kim J. Georgopoulos K. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3090-3100Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). This may be explained by the presence, in the full-length protein, of the additional N-terminal repression domain, which can interact with all corepressors found at the C terminus domain as well as CtBP, which may rescue the defect caused by the alteration of the dimerization module (13Koipally J. Renold A. Kim J. Georgopoulos K. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3090-3100Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). We extended our study of corepressor interactions to the family members of Ikaros. Like Ikaros, its three family members can bind all the Ikaros-interacting corepressors that we have tested (Sin3A, Sin3B, Mi-2, and Class I HDACs), with the exception of CtBP. CtBP, was recently shown to be capable of binding the Class II HDACs (28Zhang C.L. McKinsey T.A., Lu, J.R. Olson E.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 35-39Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar), and we have found that the Class II deacetylases, HDACs 5 and 6, can bind Ikaros. Class II HDACs can also bind Ikaros family members, but because they do not interact with CtBP (23Koipally J. Georgopoulos K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19594-19602Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar), it is likely that the HDACs are recruited to them through CtBP-independent mechanisms. Given both the strong homologies between Ikaros family members and the conservation of most corepressor interactions, we expect that the findings with Ikaros may be extended to its family. Indeed, both Aiolos and Eos have been shown to be capable of repressing transcription (13Koipally J. Renold A. Kim J. Georgopoulos K. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3090-3100Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar, 27Perdomo J. Holmes M. Chong B. Crossley M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38347-38354Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Several reports have indicated that aberrant repression may play an important role in carcinogenesis (29Burke L.J. Baniahmad A. FASEB J. 2000; 14: 1876-1888Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). In this context, it is noteworthy that mice expressing dominant-negative Ikaros proteins (e.g. Ik6) develop leukemias and lymphomas with complete penetrance (10Winandy S., Wu, P. Georgopoulos K. Cell. 1995; 83: 289-299Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). It has been argued that these cancers may arise because of the cellular anomalies that result from the titration of DNA-binding Ikaros family proteins from their binding sites by the dominant-negative proteins (1Georgopoulos K. Winandy S. Avitahl N. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1997; 15: 155-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). In addition, it is also possible that the large-scale incorporation of Ik6 into Ikaros complexes may alter their transcriptional function to a predominantly repressive role, which could severely impact lymphocyte homeostasis. The identification of a repression-defective dominant-negative Ikaros protein may permit a distinction between the role of aberrant repression versusthat of titration of Ikaros family members in dominant-negative Ikaros-mediated lymphomagenesis. In conclusion, in this report we have (a) identified the minimal repression modules and corepressor interaction interfaces on Ikaros, (b) uncovered redundancies in corepressor interaction modules involved in Ikaros-mediated repression, (c) constructed Ikaros proteins defective for interaction with the majority of the corepressors of Ikaros, and (d) shown the importance of Mi-2β, HDAC2, and CtBP in Ikaros-mediated repression. This provides a useful starting point for future studies aimed at understanding the molecular mechanisms by which Ikaros represses gene expression. We thank Dr. B.

Chem. 1988; 263: 1072-1080Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) AChR α subunits in heterologous protein expression systems has shown that the α subunit, independently of other subunits, acquires a mature conformation and a high binding affinity for α-BTX. Although these studies have provided insights into AChR α subunit function, they are less useful for structural studies as the recombinant molecules produced are transmembrane, water-insoluble proteins and are available only in small quantities. Large amounts of water-soluble recombinant α subunit fragments with conformations close to that of the native protein would be ideal for structural analysis as they would combine the water solubility required for protein crystallization and a small size, allowing multidimensional NMR analysis. Two different approaches have been used to achieve this goal, namely expression in mammalian cell lines and in bacteria. The extracellular domain of the mouse AChR α subunit has been expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells (19West A.P., Jr. Bjorkman P.J. Dougherty D.A. Lester H.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25468-25473Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) as a membrane-anchored protein that, after cleavage, could be purified in a soluble form with apparently native-like conformation, as suggested by the binding of α-BTX and conformation-dependent mAbs. However, its low level of expression was a serious drawback for use in structural studies. Large amounts of the Torpedo α subunit recombinant fragments have been produced in Escherichia coli expression systems. Schrattenholz et al. (20Schrattenholz A. Pfeiffer S. Pejovic V. Rudolph R. Godovac-Zimmermann J. Maelicke A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32393-32399Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) and Alexeev et al. (21Alexeev T. Krivoshein A. Shevalier A.

Biochem. 1999; 259: 310-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) reported the expression of the extracellular domain of theTorpedo α subunit in E. coli. Both polypeptides were produced in the form of inclusion bodies and, after a renaturation procedure, were able to bind α-BTX and low molecular weight antagonists, such as d-tubocurarine, which competed with α-BTX for binding; however, no experiments with strictly conformation-dependent mAbs were reported. Recombinant fragments of the Torpedo α subunit lacking the MIR region, expressed in E. coli, have also been reported to bind α-BTX (22Grant M.A. Gentile L.N. Shi Q.L. Pellegrini M. Hawrot E. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 10730-10742Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The human AChR α subunit is known to have a lower binding affinity than the Torpedo α subunit for α-BTX and may have additional requirements for high affinity binding. The human α-(1–209) polypeptide has been expressed inE. coli and reconstituted using the “artificial chaperone” approach (23Tsouloufis T. Mamalaki A. Remoundos M. Tzartos S.J. Int. Immunol. 2000; 12: 1255-1265Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The renatured protein was able to bind several conformation-dependent mAbs, but despite the apparently improved folding of the renatured molecule, could not bind α-BTX, possibly because of the lack ofN-glycosylation. In the present study, we tried to combine the advantages of both expression systems (mammalian cell lines and bacteria) by using yeast cells. The yeast expression system allows post-translational modifications including glycosylation, thus resulting in correct protein folding, whereas the ease of manipulation, short doubling time, and high yield of protein expression are similar to those using bacteria. We have used the methylotropic yeast strain, Pichia pastoris, because it has a strong inducible promoter and it is less prone to hyperglycosylation than Saccharomyces cerevisiae (24Cereghino J.L. Cregg J.M. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 2000; 24: 45-66Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 25Cregg J.M. Cereghino J.L. Shi J. Higgins D.R. Mol.

We here report the expression of the extracellular domain of the human AChR α subunit (hα-(1–210)) as a water-soluble molecule in sufficient quantities for structural analysis. The recombinant polypeptide has a native-like conformation, as shown by the high binding affinity for several cholinergic ligands and conformation-dependent anti-AChR mAbs, whereas deglycosylation eliminates α-BTX binding. We also studied the binding to hα-(1–210) of anti-AChR autoantibodies from myasthenic patients. The binding of the expressed molecule to human autoantibodies suggests that it could be used as a potent autoantigen in the study of MG. The N-terminal extracellular domain of the human muscle nicotinic AChR α subunit (residues 1–210) was enzymatically amplified by PCR using a full-length α1 cDNA clone (kindly provided by Dr. J. Lindstrom). The upstream (5′-GCTGGCCTCGTCGAATTCTCCGAACATG-3′) and downstream (5′-GATGAAGTAGAGGTCTAGACGCTGCATGACG-3′) primers were constructed to contain EcoRI andXbaI restriction sites (underlined). Using the appropriate restriction endonucleases, the purified cDNA fragment was subcloned into the expression vector pPICZαA (Invitrogen) so that the recombinant fragment was led by a signal peptide α-factor under the transcriptional control of the AOX promoter, which is induced by methanol, whereas at the C-terminal end, it was fused to a sequence encoding the c-Myc epitope and polyhistidine (His6) tag (see Fig. 1A). The resulting construct was linearized using PmeI and transformed into theP. pastoris host strain GS115 by electroporation (Bio-Rad GenePulser). The transformed cells were plated on YPDS (1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, 2% dextrose, and 1 m sorbitol) plus zeocin (100 μg/ml) and incubated at 30 °C for 3 days. Single colonies of the transformants were initially inoculated into 4 ml of BMGY (1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, 100 mm potassium phosphate, pH 6.0, 1.34% YNB, 4 × 10−5 % biotin, and 1% glycerol). After 16–20 h at 30 °C, the cells were resuspended in 4 ml of BMMY (identical to BMGY, except that the glycerol was replaced by 0.5% methanol) to induce expression. After induction for 3 days with daily addition of methanol (0.5% v/v), the culture supernatants were tested for expression of hα-(1–210) by dot-blot analysis using the anti-Myc 9E.10 mAb (ATCC). The clone with the highest protein yield was used for large scale protein expression. The culture supernatant was concentrated using a Minitan Ultrafiltration System (Millipore) and dialyzed against PBS, pH 8, and then hα-(1–210) was purified using Ni-NTA metal affinity chromatography (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The protein elution was performed under native conditions in an elution buffer containing 50 mm phosphate buffer (pH 8), 500 mm NaCl, and increasing imidazole concentrations (40, 70, and 100 mm). The recombinant protein was eluted in 40 and 70 mmimidazole. The eluates were analyzed by 12% SDS-PAGE followed by Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining or Western blot analysis using the anti-α subunit mAb 198. The protein concentration was determined using the Bradford method (Bio-Rad). In all the following experiments, the purified protein was diluted 500–1000 times in PBS, pH 7.4, 0.2% BSA. Approximately 3 μg of purified hα-(1–210) were deglycosylated by addition of 1,000 units ofN-glycosidase F (PNGase F, New England Biolabs) in a final volume of 100 μl. Additional enzyme (1,000 units) was added after 1.5-, 3-, and 4.5-h incubation at 37 °C. The reaction lasted for 6 h and was performed under native conditions without heating, denaturation, or addition of any detergent in a buffer containing 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.5. To deglycosylate a native glycoprotein, longer incubation time as well as more enzyme is recommended by the manufacturer. The resulting deglycosylated protein was detected in Western blots by using mAb 198 and anti-Myc 9E.10 monoclonal antibodies as the enzyme has the same molecular size as the glycosylated protein (∼34 kDa). Twenty ng of purified hα-(1–210) or 20–40 μl of culture supernatant were incubated at 4 °C for 3 h with various concentrations of125I-α-BTX (specific activity, 800,000 cpm/pmol) in a final volume of 50 μl of PBS, pH 7.4, 0.2% BSA. The samples were then diluted with 1 ml of 0.5% Triton X-100 in 20 mm Tris buffer, pH 7.5 (Triton buffer) and immediately filtered through two Whatman DE81 filters prewashed with Triton buffer. The filters were then washed twice with 1 ml of Triton buffer, and the bound radioactivity measured on a γ-counter. Samples without hα-(1–210) were used to measure nonspecific binding. Specific binding of α-BTX as well as the binding of other small nicotinic ligands such as nicotine, carbamylcholine, d-tubocurarine, or gallamine was studied in competition experiments. Various concentrations of the unlabeled ligands were added simultaneously with 5 nm125I-α-BTX to 20 ng of hα-(1–210) in a final volume of 50 μl diluted in PBS buffer, pH 7.4, 0.2% BSA, and the mixture was incubated at 4 °C for 3 h. Bound radioactivity was then measured using Whatman DE81 filters. The residual125I-α-BTX binding ability was determined as the ratio of the radioactivity bound in the presence and absence of the unlabeled ligand. IC50 values were determined, and theKi was calculated using the formula,Ki = IC50/(1 − ((125I-α-BTX)/Kd125I-α-BTX)). hα-(1–210) was analyzed by FPLC on a Superose-12 column (Amersham Biosciences) using PBS buffer, pH 7.4, at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. Wells of microtiter plates (MaxiSorp F96, Nunc) were coated with 0.1–1.5 μg of hα-(1–210) as described previously (23Tsouloufis T. Mamalaki A. Remoundos M. Tzartos S.J. Int. Immunol. 2000; 12: 1255-1265Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and then 100 μl of diluted mAbs (1:100 in PBS, pH 7.4, 0.2% BSA) were added to each well, and the plates were incubated for 3 h at room temperature. Subsequently 100 μl of peroxidase-conjugated rabbit anti-rat Ig (Dako A/S; dilution 1:500 in PBS, pH 7.4, 0.2% BSA) were added to each well (2-h incubation at room temperature). Bound mAbs were determined by the enzymatic activity of peroxidase using ABTS (2,2′-azinobis(3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulfonic acid)) as substrate. The color, developed after about 45 min, was monitored by a microtiter plate reader at 405 nm. hα-(1–210) (20 ng) was labeled by incubation for 3 h at 4 °C with 125I-α-BTX (50,000 cpm) in a total volume of 40 μl of PBS, pH 7.4, 0.2% BSA, and then 10 μl of diluted mAb (1:200 in PBS, pH 7.4, 0.2% BSA) containing 0.1 μl of normal rat serum as carrier was added, and the samples were incubated at 4 °C for 15–18 h. Immune complexes were then precipitated by addition of 10 μl of rabbit anti-rat immunoglobulin serum, incubation for 1.5 h at 4 °C, and dilution in 1 ml of PBS buffer, pH 7.4, 0.5% Triton X-100 before centrifugation (4,000 rpm at 4 °C for 10 min). The precipitates were washed twice with PBS buffer, pH 7.4, 0.5% Triton X-100, and the precipitated radioactivity was counted. hα-(1–210) (170 fmol) or hybrid AChR (AChR consisting of the human α subunit andTorpedo β, γ, and δ subunits, HαTβγδ; 17 fmol) was labeled with 125I-α-BTX (150,000 and 50,000 cpm, respectively) in a total volume of 45 μl of PBS, pH 7.4, 0.2% BSA. After addition of 5 μl of MG patient sera, the samples were incubated at 4 °C for 15–18 h, and then the immune complexes were precipitated by addition of 25 μl of goat anti-human γ-globulin antiserum and incubation for 1.5 h at 4 °C followed by addition of 1 ml of PBS buffer, pH 7.4, 0.5% Triton X-100 before centrifugation (4,000 rpm at 4 °C for 10 min). The precipitates were washed three times with PBS buffer, pH 7.4, 0.5% Triton X-100, and the precipitated radioactivity was counted. hα-(1–210) was expressed in a soluble form in the methylotropic yeast strain, P. pastoris, and purified from the culture supernatant by affinity chromatography on a Ni2+-NTA column, elution being performed with increasing concentrations of imidazole (40, 70, and 100 mm). Most of the produced protein was eluted at 40 mm imidazole, whereas about 30% was eluted at 70 mm. Almost no protein was detected at 100 mm imidazole. The yield of purified hα-(1–210) was 0.2–0.3 mg/liter. The molecular size of the product was estimated as 34 kDa (Fig.1B), higher than that predicted from the amino acid sequence (27 kDa). This difference was shown to be due to glycosylation of the molecule since enzymatic deglycosylation using peptide N-glycosidase F resulted in a reduction in the apparent molecular size to about 29 kDa (Fig.1C). These results show that, like the native receptor α subunit (14Nomoto H. Takahashi N. Nagaki Y. Endo S. Arata Y. Hayashi K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1986; 157: 233-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), hα-(1–210) is glycosylated. To study the binding of α-BTX to hα-(1–210) as an indication of correct protein folding, we tested both crude culture supernatants and the purified protein in filter assay experiments. As shown in Fig. 2A, hα-(1–210) bound α-BTX with a Kd, estimated by Scatchard analysis, of 5.1 ± 2.4 nm. This affinity is only one order of magnitude lower than that of the native human AChR (29Conroy W.G. Saedi M.S. Lindstrom J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 21642-21651Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 30Lukas R.J. Morimoto H. Hanley M.R. Bennett E.L. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 7373-7378Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The binding of 125I-α-BTX to hα-(1–210) was shown to be specific using various concentrations of unlabeled α-BTX in competition assays (Fig. 2B). Unlabeled toxin inhibited the binding of labeled α-BTX even at low concentrations. Moreover, the results were consistent with the Kd estimated from the Scatchard plot since 50% inhibition of 125I-α-BTX binding was seen using unlabeled toxin at a concentration of 6.2 nm. To further confirm the native-like conformation of the hα-(1–210) fragment, four cholinergic ligands were tested for inhibition of α-BTX binding to hα-(1–210). Various concentrations (0.1–20 mm) of carbamylcholine, nicotine, gallamine, or d-tubocurarine were added together with 125I-α-BTX (5 nm) to hα-(1–210) (20 ng diluted in PBS pH 7.4, BSA 0.2%). The same concentrations of NaCl were used to detect any nonspecific effect of an increase in ionic strength on α-BTX binding. Under these conditions, the two competitive antagonists, gallamine and d-tubocurarine, inhibited 125I-α-BTX binding withKi of 7.4 and 7.5 mm, respectively. These values are 3 orders of magnitude lower than those for native receptor from BC3H-1 cells (Fig. 3) (18Blount P. Merlie J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 1072-1080Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Neither agonist (carbamylcholine or nicotine) had any effect. The lack of effect of the agonists or of different concentrations of NaCl shows that the inhibition was not caused by high ionic strength. The solubility and size of the recombinant protein were studied by FPLC gel filtration in detergent-free solution (PBS, pH 7.4) followed by assay of the fractions for 125I-α-BTX binding. As shown in Fig.4, the protein migrated as a monomer with a molecular weight consistent with that estimated by SDS-PAGE. The binding to hα-(1–210) of several anti-MIR mAbs derived from rats immunized with intact AChR from either human muscle (mAbs 190, 192, 195, 198, and 202) (31Tzartos S. Langeberg L. Hochschwender S. Lindstrom J. FEBS Lett. 1983; 158: 116-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) orElectrophorus electricus electric organ (mAb 35) (32Tzartos S.J. Rand D.E. Einarson B.L. Lindstrom J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 8635-8645Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was tested by RIA or ELISA. This study would be expected to provide useful information about the protein conformation since some of the mAbs are known to bind exclusively to the native non-denatured human AChR (mAbs 192, 190, and 35), whereas the binding of others is partially conformation-dependent (mAbs 198, 195, and 202). In addition, we tested the binding of mAb 64, an anti-α conformation-dependent mAb not directed against the MIR (33Tzartos S Langeberg L Hochschwender S Swanson L.W. Lindstrom J. J. Neuroimmunol. 1986; 10: 235-253Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). mAb 25, which does not bind to mammalian AChR (32Tzartos S.J. Rand D.E. Einarson B.L. Lindstrom J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 8635-8645Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), was used as a negative control. Fig. 5A shows that with the exception of the negative control (mAb 25), all the mAbs tested (dilution 1:200) bound to the recombinant protein in RIA experiments. To further study the low binding of mAb 35 to hα-(1–210) in the RIA, we performed another series of experiments in which increasing amounts of hα-(1–210) (0.1, 0.5, 1, and 1.5 μg/well) were tested for mAb 35 binding in ELISA assays using a mAb dilution of 1:100. As shown in Fig. 5B, the results from ELISA experiments were similar to those from the described RIA experiments: mAb 35 bound to hα-(1–210) at the three highest amounts of protein; nevertheless, its binding activity was significantly lower than that of mAb 198. To test the binding of mAb 35 to the native human receptor α subunit, the same set of seven mAbs (35, 64, 190, 192, 195, 198, and 202) was tested for binding to the native human AChR as well as to a hybrid AChR, HαTβγδ, containing the human α and Torpedo β, γ, and δ subunits (34Loutrari H. Kokla A. Trakas N. Tzartos S.J. Clin. Exp. Immunol. 1997; 109: 538-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). All the tested mAbs bound to both receptors. However, the cpm values of bound labeled receptor were much lower for mAb 35 as compared with cpm values of the bound labeled receptor for the rest of the antibodies (data not shown). Overall, the fact that all tested mAbs were able to bind to recombinant hα-(1–210) suggests that the molecule assumes the correct conformation. The role of glycosylation in α-BTX and mAb binding was studied by in vitro deglycosylation of the recombinant polypeptide usingN-glycosidase F. Because the reaction was performed under native conditions (no detergent or boiling), it was necessary to extend the reaction time to 6 h and add fresh enzyme every 1.5 h. Assay of the 125I-α-BTX binding activity of aliquots taken at the time-points of 0, 1.5, 3, 4.5, and 6 h showed that as deglycosylation proceeded, 125I-α-BTX binding gradually fell to almost zero (Fig. 6A). To exclude the possibility that incubation of hα-(1–210) alone at 37 °C for 6 h affected its toxin binding activity, a sample was treated in parallel in the absence of N-glycosidase F, and its toxin binding activity was found to be unaffected (Fig.6A, last bar). The reduction in toxin binding activity did not result from any proteolysis of the recombinant fragment at the C-terminal end (by possible proteolytic impurities in the N-glycosidase F preparation) as the deglycosylated protein was recognized by anti-Myc mAb in Western blot experiments (Myc epitope is located at the C-terminal of the polypeptide; Fig1C). The lack of any proteolysis was also proved by usingTorpedo AChR as well as the extracellular fragment of α7 neuronal AChR, which binds α-BTX and was also expressed inP. pastoris in our laboratory. 2V. Avramopoulou, A. Mamalaki, and S. Tzartos, unpublished data. These two molecules were similarly treated with N-glycosidase F with no significant inhibition on α-BTX binding. In the case ofTorpedo AChR deglycosylation, we used a 50 and 100 times higher enzyme/substrate ratio (enzyme units/pmol of substrate) than in the case of hα-(1–210) to compensate for the multiple glycosylation sites per AChR molecule and the possible higher difficulty of the enzyme to approach the polysaccharide chains. However, only a 14 ± 6% decrease in α-BTX binding activity was observed (data not shown). In contrast to the dramatic effect of deglycosylation on the125I-α-BTX binding, ELISA experiments showed that mAb binding to hα-(1–210) was not affected by the deglycosylation of the molecule. 1 μg of hα-(1–210) incubated at 37 °C for 6 h with or without the addition of N-glycosidase F were tested for binding mAbs 202, 198, 195, 192, 190, and 64. As shown in Fig.6B, no remarkable difference was observed between the deglycosylated and the glycosylated molecule. This observation also excludes any major proteolysis from the N-terminal part of the molecule that would explain the decrease in α-BTX binding. As the antibody- and ligand-binding experiments indicated that the recombinant protein assumed the correct conformation, we were interested in studying the binding of anti-AChR autoantibodies from MG sera to hα-(1–210) since these antibodies are, in general, highly conformation-dependent (7Tzartos S.J. Barkas T. Cung M.T. Mamalaki A. Marraud M. Orlewski P. Papanastasiou D. Sakarellos C. Sakarellos-Daitsiotis M. Tsantili P. Tsikaris V. Immunol. Rev. 1998; 163: 89-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). We screened 70 human sera (50 MG and 20 healthy controls). To determine the anti-α subunit specificities of the MG antisera, we analyzed, in parallel, their capacity to bind to recombinant hα-(1–210) and to a solubilized hybrid AChR, HαTβγδ, containing the human α andTorpedo β, γ, and δ subunits (34Loutrari H. Kokla A. Trakas N. Tzartos S.J. Clin. Exp. Immunol. 1997; 109: 538-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Since MG sera essentially do not bind to Torpedo AChR, their binding to the hybrid molecule represents binding to the α subunit in the hybrid AChR molecule, and we were therefore able to compare antibody binding with the α subunit inserted in the intact AChR molecule and with the isolated recombinant α subunit fragment. Thirty-six of the 50 MG sera (72%) were found to have high titers of anti-α autoantibodies (i.e. they immunoprecipitated an amount of radiolabeled hybrid AChR molecule greater than the mean of the controls plus three standard deviations of that immunoprecipitated by healthy control sera), and 24 of these 36 (66%) recognized hα-(1–210) (i.e. they immunoprecipitated an amount of radiolabeled recombinant molecule greater than the mean of the controls plus three standard"

Transmission electron microscopy of surfactant from the SP-A−/−,D/A mice revealed atypical tubular myelin containing central “target-like” electron density.

Lung-specific overexpression of D/A in the SPD−/− mouse resulted in hetero-oligomer formation with mouse SP-A and did not correct the air space dilation or phospholipidosis that occurs in the absence of SP-D. These studies indicate that the N terminus of SP-D 1) can functionally replace the N terminus of SP-A for lipid aggregation and tubular myelin formation, but not for surface tension lowering properties of SP-A, and 2) is not sufficient to reverse the structural and metabolic pulmonary defects in the SP-D−/−mouse.

Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1408: 79-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (590) Google Scholar). Although the primary function of surfactant is to reduce surface tension, the contribution of each molecular component to surface activity is not completely understood. Surfactant phospholipids form a film at the air-liquid interface that maintains air space patency by resisting compression as the alveolar radius decreases during expiration. Data from in vitro experiments, gene-targeted animals, and naturally occurring mutations in humans indicate that the hydrophobic surfactant proteins, SP-B and SP-C, participate in the assembly and biophysical properties of the surfactant film (2Weaver T.E. Conkright J.J. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2001; 63: 555-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). The hydrophilic surfactant proteins, SP-A and SP-D, have a complex functional profile. The recognition that SP-A and SP-D are structurally homologous to mannose-binding protein has identified them as members of the collectin family of innate opsonins and directed attention to their host defense properties (3Crouch E. Wright J.R. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2001; 63: 521-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar). Like mannose-binding protein, SP-A and SP-D bind to a wide range of microorganisms and enhance microbial phagocytosis and killing by alveolar macrophages. These in vitro activities appear to be physiologically relevant, since gene-targeted SP-A−/− and SP-D−/− mice clear microbial infections less effectively than pulmonary collectin-sufficient mice (4LeVine A.M.

The structural basis of SP-A and SP-D surfactant functions has been explored by mutagenesis using in vitro and in vivo analyses. The primary structure of both proteins includes an N-terminal segment containing interchain linkages formed by Cys residues, a collagen-like region of Gly-X-Y repeats, a hydrophobic “neck” domain, and a carbohydrate recognition domain (CRD) (15White R.T.

Trimeric association of subunits occurs by the folding of the collagen-like domains into triple helices (17King R.J. Simon D. Horowitz P.M. Biochim. Biophys.

FEBS Lett. 1994; 344: 191-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). In the fully assembled molecules, the N-terminal sequences and disulfide bonds of the pulmonary collectins stabilize the parallel arrangement of six trimers that characterizes the “bouquet” structure of SP-A and the radial alignment of four trimers that imparts the cruciform organization to SP-D (19Voss T. Eistetter H. Schafer K.P. Engel J. J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 201: 219-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar, 20Crouch E. Persson A. Chang D. Heuser J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17311-17319Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). SP-A and SP-D bind to carbohydrate and lipid ligands by their CRDs, but high affinity interactions require oligomeric assembly mediated by N-terminal cross-linking of trimeric arms. This configuration facilitates simultaneous engagement of individual collectin molecules with multiple sites on membranes and microbial surfaces. Deletion of the collagen-like domain from SP-A, which limits oligomeric assembly to simple trimers and hexamers, reduces binding to liposomes but does not block liposome aggregation (21McCormack F.X.

In addition, lung-specific overexpression of the C15S,C20S SP-D in SP-D+/+ mice disrupted oligomeric assembly of the endogenous SP-D and produced air space dilation and foamy macrophage formation without phospholipidosis (24Zhang L.

These data suggested that the in vivo activity of SP-D is dependent on its oligomeric structure. The purpose of this study was to examine the role of the N-terminal segment-dependent oligomeric structure of SP-A and SP-D in their functions in vivo. Mice were handled in accordance with approved protocols through the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees at the University of Cincinnati School of Medicine and the Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center. All mice used in experiments were the Swiss Black strain, were maintained under barrier containment in the vivarium facilities, and appeared healthy and free of infection at the time of the study. All comparisons made were among littermates. Sentinel mice in all colonies were serologically negative for common murine pathogens.

Orientation was confirmed by restriction digestion with KpnI and BamHI for the PVL 1392/D/A and hSP-C/D/A constructs, respectively. Recombinant baculoviruses were produced by homologous recombination inSpodoptera frugiperda (Sf-9) cells following cotransfection with linear viral DNA and PVL 1392/cDNA constructs (Baculogold; Pharmingen), as described (22McCormack F.X.

Fresh monolayers of 107 Trichoplusia ni (T. ni) cells were infected with plaque-purified recombinant viruses at a multiplicity of infection of 10 and then incubated with serum-free Excel 400 media (JRH Biosciences) supplemented with antibiotics for 72 h. Recombinant D/A or recombinant rat SP-A was purified from the culture media by adsorption to mannose-Sepharose 6B columns in the presence of 1 mm Ca2+ and elution with 2 mm EDTA. The purified recombinant D/A was dialyzed to remove EDTA and then stored at −20 °C. Rat SP-A and SP-D were purified from the bronchoalveolar wash of silica-treated animals using previously published methods (22McCormack F.X. Damodarasamy M. Elhalwagi B.M. J. Biol.

Small amounts of D/A required for immunoblot analysis were purified from SP-D−/−,D/A mice by sedimentation of surfactant at 15,000 × g, butanol extraction of the washed surfactant pellet, dialysis of the insoluble proteins, and mannose-Sepharose affinity chromatography. To obtain sufficient D/A for sizing by gel filtration chromatography, SP-A−/−,D/A mice were lavaged 2 weeks after intranasal instillation of silica (28Dethloff L.A. Gilmore L.B. Brody A.R. Hook G.E.R. Biochem. J. 1986; 233: 111-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). D/A was separated from other lavage proteins and surfactant phospholipids by cosedimentation with the surfactant pellet, repeated washing with 1 mm CaCl2 in 150 mm NaCl, and elution from the pellet with isotonic saline containing 2 mm EDTA. The surfactant lipids were pelleted by high speed centrifugation, and the supernatant containing D/A was stored at −20 °C. Swiss Black/C129J SP-A−/− and SP-D−/− mice were developed from embryonic stem cells by targeted disruption of the endogenous mouse collectin genes and maintained by breeding with Swiss Black mice, as previously described (8Korfhagen T.R.

Portions of the hSP-C/D/A construct that were unnecessary for expression of the transgene were removed by digestion withNdeI and NotI. Lung-specific overexpression of D/A in SP-A−/− mice was accomplished by injection of the male pronucleus of fertilized SP-A−/−mouse eggs with the hSP-C-D/A transgene, followed by uterine implantation in SP-A−/− females (29Elhalwagi B.M.

SP-A−/−,D/A progeny identified by PCR were expanded by breeding with SP-A−/− mice. The D/A transgene was bred into the SP-D−/− background by crossing the SP-A−/−,D/A mice with SP-D−/− mice, using the genotyping strategies outlined below. Progeny that screened positively for the D/A transgene in the first round were bred in brother/sister matings. Progeny of the second generation that screened positively for the D/A transgene were screened for the gene-targeted mSP-D gene. The SP-D−/−,D/A mice identified by this method were then expanded by crosses with SP-D−/−mice. The D/A transgene and mSP-D genes were identified in the genomic DNA of mice using PCR. Tail clips (0.5–1 cm) were digested overnight in buffer containing 50 mm Tris, 100 mm EDTA, 0.5% SDS, and 100 μg/ml proteinase K at 55 °C and purified using the Wizard genomic DNA kit (Promega, Madison, WI). PCR to identify the D/A transgene was performed using primer set 1, which amplified a region from the distal end of the hSP-C promoter to the midportion of the D/A cDNA (5′-ctcaactcacccaggtttgctc-3′ and 5′-ttcacagaagccccatccaggtag-3′). For identification of the mSP-D gene, primer set 2, which amplified the 1.0-kb region spanning the proximal end of mSP-D exon 2 (5′-GCTGCCCTTTCTCTCCATGC-3′) and the distal end of mSP-D intron 2 (5′-TTCCCACCACATTTGGAGTG-3′), was used. No band is amplified from the mSP-D gene-targeted allele, because the sequences recognized by primer set 2 are ablated by the insertion of theneo-targeting cassette. Routine protein concentrations were determined with the bicinchoninic protein assay kit (BCA) (Pierce) using bovine serum albumin as the standard. SP-A and D/A concentrations in lavage were measured by ELISA (14Ikegami M. Elhalwagi B.M. Palaniyar N. Dienger K. Korfhagen T. Whitsett J.A. McCormack F.X. J. Biol.

Blots were developed by horseradish peroxidase/H2O2-dependent oxidation of luminol and autoradiography, according to the manufacturer's instructions (ECL; Amersham Biosciences). The oligomeric structure of D/A was assessed by chemical cross-linking with disuccinimidyl glutarate (Pierce), SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions, and staining with Coomassie Blue, as previously described (22McCormack F.X. Damodarasamy M. Elhalwagi B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3173-3183Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Recombinant D/A mass was estimated under physiologic ionic strength conditions (150 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris) by Superose 6 gel filtration chromatography using a fast protein liquid chromatography column with a bed volume of 10 × 300 mm (AKTA; AmershamBiosciences). To estimate oligomeric mass of D/A from the lavage of SP-A−/−,D/A mice, D/A isolated as outlined above was analyzed by Superose 6 gel filtration chromatography in running buffer containing 150 mm NaCl and 0.1 mm EDTA. The elution of recombinant D/A and lavage D/A was monitored by ELISA. Binding experiments were performed with multilamellar liposomes produced by vigorous vortexing of a mixture of saturated phosphatidylcholine (Sat PC)/egg phosphatidylcholine (PC)/phosphatidylglycerol (9:3:2) in 150 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA. After incubation of 5 μg/ml D/A or recombinant SP-A with 100 μg/ml liposomes at 23 °C for 60 min, the mixtures were centrifuged at 11,000 ×g, washed, and centrifuged again. SP-A (or D/A) in the supernatant and pellet were measured by ELISA, and fractional binding was calculated according to the following equation: percentage bound = SP-Apellet/(SP-Apellet + SP-Asupernatant) × 100. For aggregation experiments, unilamellar liposomes were produced by sonication of the same lipid mixture as above, as described (22McCormack F.X. Damodarasamy M. Elhalwagi B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3173-3183Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The vesicles (100 μg/ml) were mixed with 10 μg/ml recombinant rSP-A or recombinant D/A and equilibrated for 3 min. After the addition of 5 mmCaCl2, aggregation was determined by measuring light scattering (A400) in a spectrophotometer. For both the binding and aggregation experiments, controls with no phospholipids and no CaCl2 were also performed. Groups of mice from each genotype were anesthetized by intraperitoneal injection with pentobarbital sodium and exsanguinated by transection of the abdominal aorta. The chest was opened, and the proximal trachea was cannulated with a 20-gauge blunt needle. Alveolar lavage was performed by three cycles of instillation of saline to full lung expansion followed by gentle aspiration, repeated five times (total ∼5 ml) for each animal (11Ikegami M. Korfhagen T.R. Whitsett J.A. Bruno M.D. Wert S.E. Wada K. Jobe A.H. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: L247-L254PubMed Google Scholar). Large aggregate surfactant was isolated from the pooled lavage fluid by centrifugation at 40,000 × g over a 0.8m sucrose cushion for 15 min (11Ikegami M. Korfhagen T.R. Whitsett J.A. Bruno M.D. Wert S.E. Wada K. Jobe A.H. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: L247-L254PubMed Google Scholar). The large aggregate surfactant then was collected from the interface, diluted with 0.15m NaCl, and centrifuged again at 40,000 ×g for 15 min. The pellet was suspended in normal saline and stored at −20 °C. After lavage as above, lung tissue was homogenized in saline. Sat PC was measured by extracting the alveolar lavage sample or lung homogenates with chloroform/methanol (2:1), treatment with OsO4, separation by alumina column chromatography, and phosphorus analysis as described (8Korfhagen T.R. Bruno M.D. Ross G.F. Huelsman K.M. Ikegami M. Jobe A.H. Wert S.E. Stripp B.R. Morris R.E. Glasser S.W. Bachurski C.J. Iwamoto H.S. Whitsett J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 1996; 93: 9594-9599Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar). Large aggregate surfactant samples (four mice/pellet) were fixed for 18 h at 4 °C with 2% paraformaldehyde and 4% glutaraldehyde (Electron Microscopy Sciences, Fort Washington, PA) in buffer containing 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, and 1 mm CaCl2. Pellets were treated with 1% OsO4 and 1.5% potassium ferrocyanide for 1 h at 23 °C and washed and dehydrated with increasing concentrations of acetone (0–100%) and ethanol (0–100%). At the 75% ethanol dehydration step, 2% uranyl acetate was added and incubated for 2–18 h at 4 °C. Fixed and dehydrated pellets were embedded in epoxy resin (Ted Pella, Redding, CA), sectioned, and stained with lead citrate and 2% uranyl acetate. Dried specimens were examined and photographed using a JEOL JEM-100CX-II TEM at 8,000–40,000 times nominal magnification (31Palaniyar N. McCormack F.X. Possmayer F. Harauz G. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 6310-6316Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). At least four specimen grids with different sections were systematically examined by EM for each genotype. Dimensions of TM figures were measured from magnified images (final magnification of ∼3 × 105) captured on scanned micrographs using Canvas 6 software (Deneba Software, Miami, FL). Clearly identifiable cross-sections of TM from 3–5 micrographs at different magnifications (×10,000, ×20,000, and ×40,000) were selected to measure lattice dimensions for each genotype. The smallest side of a randomly selected lattice was considered as side 1, and all of the membranes parallel to that side in the row were measured (n = 50). Rows of membranes perpendicular to side 1 were measured as side 2 (n = 50). All dimensions reported were rounded to the nearest 0.1 nm (1 Å). Surface activity was measured with the captive bubble surfactometer (32Schurch S. Bachofen H. Goerke J. Possmayer F. J. Appl. Physiol. 1989; 67: 2389-2396Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar), using large aggregate surfactant pooled from three mice of the same genotype. The concentration of each sample was adjusted to 3 nmol of Sat PC/μl, and 3 μl of surfactant was applied to the air-water interface of the bubble by microsyringe. Sensitivity to protein inhibition was measured in the presence of 0.93 mg/ml sheep plasma. Measurement of respiratory mechanics was performed with a computer controlled small animal ventilator (Flexivent; Scireq, Montreal, Canada). Mice were sedated with a combination of xylazine (13 mg/kg intraperitoneally) and ketamine (87 mg/kg intraperitoneally) and then anesthetized with pentobarbital (70–90 mg/kg intraperitoneally). The trachea was cannulated with an 18-gauge metal needle, and mice were ventilated with a quasisinusoidal waveform at a frequency of 160 breaths/min and a tidal volume of 6 ml/kg. Positive end-expiratory pressure was maintained at 2 cm of H2O by attaching a water trap to the expiratory line of the ventilator. Pulmonary mechanics were measured with an oscillation technique that has been previously described (33Gomes R.F. Shen X. Ramchandani R. Tepper R.S. Bates J.H. J. Appl. Physiol. 2000; 89: 908-916Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Regular ventilation was stopped, and the mouse was allowed to passively expire to relaxation volume while positive end-expiratory pressure was maintained. Low amplitude flow oscillation was delivered to the lung over a 16-s period of apnea. Tracheal pressure and tracheal volume measured during this maneuver were used to calculate respiratory compliance (33Gomes R.F. Shen X. Ramchandani R. Tepper R.S. Bates J.H. J. Appl.

https://openalex.org/W2087388427,"The crystal structures of two thermally stabilized subtilisin BPN′ variants, S63 and S88, are reported here at 1.8 and 1.9 Å resolution, respectively. The micromolar affinity calcium binding site (site A) has been deleted (Δ75–83) in these variants, enabling the activity and thermostability measurements in chelating conditions. Each of the variants includes mutations known previously to increase the thermostability of calcium-independent subtilisin in addition to new stabilizing mutations. S63 has eight amino acid replacements: D41A, M50F, A73L, Q206W, Y217K, N218S, S221C, and Q271E. S63 has 75-fold greater stability than wild type subtilisin in chelating conditions (10 mm EDTA). The other variant, S88, has ten site-specific changes: Q2K, S3C, P5S, K43N, M50F, A73L, Q206C, Y217K, N218S, and Q271E. The two new cysteines form a disulfide bond, and S88 has 1000 times greater stability than wild type subtilisin in chelating conditions.

The structural bases of the stabilization effects of the new mutations Q2K, S3C, P5S, D41A, Q206C, and Q206W are generally apparent.

Alden R.A. Kraut J. Nature. 1969; 221: 235-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar, 2Siezen R.J. de Vos W.M. Leunissen J.A. Dijkstra B.W.

D. 1996; 52: 1125-1135Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) and is widely used as a detergent additive (3Siezen R.J. Leunissen J.A. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 501-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (783) Google Scholar). The use of Sbt in chelating (“water-softening”) detergent conditions causes a loss of bound calcium from the high affinity site A and results in destabilization and loss of activity. However, the simple deletion of site A from Sbt by removing the 9-residue A site loop (Δ75–83) creates an enzyme that is fully active but with sharply decreased thermostability. Some restabilization of the deletion mutant was achieved by incorporating the previously identified stabilizing mutations M50F, N218S, Y217K, and Q271E to produce the variant S46 (6Strausberg S.L. Alexander P.A. Gallagher D.T. Gilliland G.L. Barnett B.L. Bryan P.N. Bio/Technology. 1995; 13: 669-673Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Together, these mutations extend the activity half-life of Δ75–83 Sbt by ∼10-fold (7Alexander P.A. Ruan B. Strausberg S.L. Bryan P.N. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 10640-10644Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). To provide the further stability increases needed to regain in calcium-independent Sbt, the stability of wild type, a program of crystal structure analysis and directed evolution methods, was then developed. The crystal structure of the first Δ75–83 Sbt (1SUC) showed that large structural perturbations were confined to the region of the deletion (4Gallagher T. Bryan P. Gilliland G.L. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 1993; 16: 205-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The principal changes involve the N-terminal amino acids 1–6, the 36–44 Ω-loop, the 63–85 α-helix, and the 202–219 β-ribbon. 2The wild type numbering was kept for all of the subtilisin variants; thus 1SUC, 1SUA, S63, and S88 have no residues numbered 75–83. Several residues in these regions were observed in 1SUC to be repositioned, to have increased thermal factors, or to be completely disordered (residues 1–3). This structural analysis suggested amino acid positions that might be targeted for random mutagenesis and selection to restore stability to the loop-deleted enzyme. The basic criterion for selecting sites for mutagenesis was to assume that amino acids, which interact with the calcium loop in native subtilisin, were no longer optimal in the loop-deleted variant. The stabilizing amino acids were identified at the following positions: residues 2, 3, and 5; residues 41 and 43 in the Ω-loop; residue 73 in the α-helix; and residue 206 in the β-ribbon. When stabilizing mutations are combined, the resulting Sbt mutants regain the stability of wild type Sbt but are no longer dependent on calcium for stability. These Sbts illustrate alternative solutions to the calcium-mediated stabilization that evolved in natural Sbts. Proteins are highly refined by natural selection to perform efficiently in their native environments. In this case, we have synthetically evolved Sbts to perform efficiently in a non-native environment containing metal chelators. Here we report the crystal structures of the thermostable calcium-independent subtilisin variants, S63 and S88, and examine structure/stability effects at the mutation sites. These crystal structures are compared with three other high resolution crystal structures of subtilisin that differ in crystallization conditions and in crystal symmetry, i.e. 1SUP (wild type subtilisin inhibited with phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) (5Gallagher D.T. Oliver J.D. Bott R. Betzel C. Gilliland G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sec. D. 1996; 52: 1125-1135Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) and 1SUC and 1SUA (two previously reported calcium-independent subtilisins) (4Gallagher T. Bryan P. Gilliland G.L. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 1993; 16: 205-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 6Strausberg S.L. Alexander P.A. Gallagher D.T. Gilliland G.L. Barnett B.L. Bryan P.N. Bio/Technology. 1995; 13: 669-673Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Ten residues that interacted with the site A loop in wild type Sbt were targeted for replacement in the deletion mutant S46. Initially, mutagenesis was performed on the S46 gene using oligonucleotides that were degenerate at one codon to identify the optimum amino acid at that position. Mutant clones were grown in microtiter dishes and screened for the retention of enzymatic activity at high temperature (for review see Ref. 6Strausberg S.L. Alexander P.A. Gallagher D.T. Gilliland G.L. Barnett B.L. Bryan P.N. Bio/Technology. 1995; 13: 669-673Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). The expression and purification were as described previously (9Bryan P. Wang L. Hoskins J. Ruvinov S. Strausberg S. Alexander P. Almog O. Gilliland G. Gallagher T. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 10310-10318Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Following single site mutagenesis and screening, some sites were rescreened in the context of favorable mutations, and synergistic effects were identified by dual-site mutagenesis and screening as described below. The overall process of mutagenesis, selection, and further mutagenesis that led to the S88 variant is described previously (6Strausberg S.L. Alexander P.A. Gallagher D.T. Gilliland G.L. Barnett B.L. Bryan P.N. Bio/Technology. 1995; 13: 669-673Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). The assays of peptidase activity were performed by monitoring the hydrolysis of sAAPF-pNA as described previously (10DelMar E. Largman C. Brodrick J. Geokas M. Anal. Biochem. 1979; 99: 316-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (546) Google Scholar). The Sbt concentration was determined using 1 mg/ml = 1.12 at 280 nm (11Pantoliano M.W. Whitlow M. Wood J.F. Rollence M.L. Finzel B.C. Gilliland G.L. Poulos T.L. Bryan P.N. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 8311-8317Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). The activity measurements were conducted in 0.05 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.05 mNaCl, and 0.01 m EDTA at 60 °C. The kinetics of thermal inactivation were determined. The enzyme at 1 μmconcentration was dispensed in aliquots of 0.5 ml into 1-ml glass test tubes and covered with parafilm. The tubes were placed in a circulating water bath at the appropriate temperature. At each time point, a tube was removed and quickly transferred to an ice bath. A 10-μl aliquot was removed, and residual activity was assayed in 990 μl of 1 mm sAAPF-pNA, 0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and 0.1m NaCl. The inactivation time course was followed over four half-lives. Thermal denaturation of inactive subtilisins was measured using a JASCO 720 spectropolarimeter. Protein samples at a concentration of 1.0 μm were monitored at 222 nm while heated at a uniform rate using a 1.0-cm path length jacketed cuvette. The temperature was increased with a circulating water bath interfaced with a NESLAB temperature programmer. The heating rate was 1 °C/min. Derivative melting curves were calculated using KaleidaGraph software for the Macintosh. Crystallization used the hanging-drop vapor-diffusion method with siliconized coverslips and Linbro 24-well tissue culture plates. In these experiments, the droplets ranging in size from 10 to 20 μl were equilibrated with 1.0 ml of reservoir solution at 20 °C. Initial crystallization trials for both S63 and S88 employed a modification of the procedure reported by Drenth and Hol (12Drenth J. Hol W.G. J. Mol. Biol. 1967; 28: 543-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) that was used to grow crystals of 1SUC and other Sbt variants (4Gallagher T. Bryan P. Gilliland G.L. Proteins Struct. Funct.

Genet. 1986; 1: 326-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Crystallization droplets containing 10 mg/ml protein in 0.05 m glycine at pH 9.0 were suspended over a reservoir solution that contained 55% acetone and 0.05 mglycine, pH 9.0. Only the S63 variant crystallized under these conditions. In each droplet, 1–5 crystals appeared within a few days and grew to full size within 2 weeks with typical dimensions of 0.4 × 0.4 × 0.5 mm. The crystallization conditions for S63 are similar to the conditions found for 1SUC despite the 4 amino acid differences at sites 41, 73, 206, and 271. Further trials employing the fast screen approach of Jancarik and Kim (14Jancarik J. Kim S.-H. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1991; 24: 409-411Crossref Scopus (2079) Google Scholar) were carried out for S88 using the Hampton Research crystal screen kit. The suspended droplets were prepared by mixing 5 μl of a protein solution containing 10 mg/ml S88 in 0.01 m HEPES-HCl and 0.02 m KCl at pH 7.5 and equal volumes of the reservoir solution. Small crystals appeared in droplets equilibrated against a solution containing 30% (w/v) PEG 4000, 0.2 m ammonium sulfate, and 0.1 m sodium acetate at pH 4.6. After refining the conditions, the final reservoir solution consisted of 23% (w/v) of PEG 4000, 0.2 m ammonium sulfate, and 0.1 msodium acetate at pH 4.5. Using these conditions, 1–4 single crystals appeared in each droplet within 3 days and grew to 0.3 × 0.3 × 0.5 mm after two additional days. The diffraction data from crystals of S63 and S88 mounted in thin-walled glass capillaries were collected at room temperature using a Bruker Hi-Star electronic area detector. The area detector was mounted on a Rigaku RU-200 HB generator operated at 40 kV and 60 mA. A graphite monochromator followed by a 0.5-mm collimator was used. The detector was positioned at 10 cm from the crystal, and 2θ was set to 26 and 24° intercepting data at 1.8 and 1.9 Å for S63 and S88, respectively. The diffraction data collected with the area detector were electronic images, each comprising a 0.2° oscillation counted for 3 min. The determination of unit cell parameters, crystal orientation, and the integration of reflection intensities were performed with the XENGEN program system (15Howard A.J. Gilliland G.L. Finzel B.C.

Genet. 1993; 16: 205-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) as a starting model. The structure of S88 was also solved by direct replacement but, in this case, by using the variant 1SUA (8Almog O. Gallagher T. Tordova M. Hoskins J. Bryan P. Gilliland G.L. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 1998; 31: 21-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) as the starting model. In addition to the deletion, 1SUA has these eight mutations, K43N, M50F, A73L, Q206V, Y217K, N218S, S221C, and Q271E. As with the 1SUC crystal structure, 1SUA does not include the first three residues of the N terminus because of disorder. The starting model included the complete protein coordinates of 1SUA as well as 130 water molecules. The initialR-factor using this starting model was 0.29 for all data between 8.0 and 2.4 Å. At this stage, all of the side chains were changed to fit the correct sequence of S88, and all of the data between 8.0 and 1.9 Å were used. After several cycles of refinement and map fitting that included modification of the solvent structure, it was possible to fit the N-terminal residues to the electron density map. The refinement of both crystal structures was carried out by the restrained parameter least squares procedure PROFFT (16Hendrickson W. Konnert J. Diamond R. Ramaseshan S. Venktesan K.

The superpositioning of these two molecules with other high resolution subtilisin structures was performed with the ALIGN program (22Satow Y. Cohen G.H. Padlan E.A. Davies D.R. J. Mol.

The two final structures of S63 and S88 were compared with three other high resolution subtilisin structures: 1SUP (wild type Sbt in the space group C2 at 1.6 Å resolution) (5Gallagher D.T.

The screening procedure identified stabilizing mutations at 7 of the 10 positions listed with stability effects in Table II. S63 has the active-site mutation S221C and the seven stabilizing mutations, D41A, M50F, A73L, Q206W, Y217K, N218S, and Q271E. Five of these substitutions have been described in previous structures; the two new mutations in S63 are D41A and Q206W. The final coordinates of S63 exclude residues 1–3 and the side chain of Val-4 because of disorder. The overall quality of the geometry of the final model is consistent with other Sbt structures determined at comparable resolution (Table I). The S63 cysteine residue is apparently oxidized as observed in the 1SUC structure.Table IIStability effects of mutationsRegion of proteinSiteStabilizing replacementRelative half-life2-aIncreases in half-life are relative to the calcium-free prototype S46.N terminusGln-2Lys2.0Gln-2Leu1.8Ser-3none (without 206C)Ser-3Cys (S–S bond with 206)17.02-bCysteine mutations at positions 3 and 206 are stabilizing as a disulfide bond.Val-4nonePro-5Ser1.2Pro-5Ser (with 3–206 disulfide)2.82-cStabilization observed for P5S mutation in the presence of the 3–206 disulfide.36–44 Ω-loopPro-41Ala1.5Asp-43Asn1.263–85 α-helixAla-73Leu2.6Ala-74none202–220 β-ribbonGln-206Val4.5Gln-206Trp4.0Gln-206Ile4.0Gln-206Cys (S–S bond with 3)17.02-bCysteine mutations at positions 3 and 206 are stabilizing as a disulfide bond.Tyr-214none2-a Increases in half-life are relative to the calcium-free prototype S46.2-b Cysteine mutations at positions 3 and 206 are stabilizing as a disulfide bond.2-c Stabilization observed for P5S mutation in the presence of the 3–206 disulfide. Open table in a new tab D41A is shown in Fig. 1. In wild type Sbt, 1SUP, Asp-41 provides one coordination bond to the tightly bound calcium ion and also interacts through three hydrogen bonds with residues in the calcium-binding loop 75–83 (one hydrogen bond between the main chain carbonyl oxygen atom and the main chain amide N atom of Leu-75 (2.9 Å) and two hydrogen bonds between the side chain of Asp-41 and two other residues). The Asp-41 OD1 atom forms a hydrogen bond with the side chain ND2 of Asn-77 (2.8 Å), and Asp-41 OD2 atom forms a H-bond to the amide N of Val-81 (2.9 Å). The deletion of the calcium binding site (residues 75–83) eliminates those hydrogen bonds and leaves the side chain of Asp-41 unbound increasing the temperature factors of the side chain atoms. The D41A change apparently reduces the thermal motion at this site (lower B values) and increases the half-time of inactivation at 60 °C in S63 by 1.5-fold. No hydrogen bonds are seen for Ala-41 in the S63 crystal structure. Gln-206 was selected for mutagenesis because of its proximity to the N terminus that was found to be disordered by the removal of the high affinity calcium binding site. The rationale was that a different residue might form stronger interactions with the N terminus and hence increase the thermal stability by reducing the N-terminal mobility. The OΕ1 and NΕ2 atoms of the side chain of Gln-206 in the 1SUP crystal structure form hydrogen bonds with water molecules as well as two hydrogen bonds of the main chain to water molecules. However, in the crystal structure of 1SUC (only the hydrogen bonds found are between the main chain and water molecules), there are no hydrogen bonds involving the side chain of Gln-206. The same pattern was found in the S63 crystal structure. Two hydrogen bonds were found for Trp-206 in the crystal structure of S63; both involve the main chain 206. However, no interaction was found between the side chain of Trp-206 and the N terminus, which is still disordered in this crystal structure. The stabilizing effect of Q206W (increasing the half-life of Δ75–83 Sbt by 4-fold) probably involves its increased Van der Waals interaction (6Strausberg S.L. Alexander P.A. Gallagher D.T.

The Gln side chain at this site has a variable conformation and above average temperature factors in 1SUP and 1SUC. The Trp side chain produces more extensive Van der Waals interaction by adopting a conformation with the indole packed against a peptide plane on the opposite strand of the β-ribbon (Fig.2). S88 produced crystals isomorphous with the subtilisin variant 1SUA, although the crystallization conditions differ (Table III). The structure of S88 includes the inhibitor DFP bound to Ser-221. The N terminal could be fit from the electron density, but the density for residues Ala-1 and Lys-2 was relatively weak, and the occupancy for these two residues was modeled as 0.5. The electron density in the N-terminal region of S88 is shown in Fig. 3. S88 has four new mutations (Q2K, S3C, P5S, and Q206C), all are close to the N terminus.Table IIICrystallization data for subtilisin BPN′ structuresS63S881SUC1SUA1SUPMutationsΔ75–83; D41A; M50F; A73L; Q206W; Y217K; N218S; S221C; Q271EQ2K; S3C; P5S; Δ75–83; K43N; M50F; A73L; Q206C Y217K; N218S; S221-DFP Q271EΔ75–83; M50F; Y217K; N218S; S221CΔ75–83 K43N; M50F; A73L; Q206V Y217K; N218S; S221A; Q271EActive siteOxidized CysDFPOxidized CysALAL tetrapep.PMSCrystallization55% acetone, 50 mmglycine, pH 9.023% PEG 4000, 0.2 m(NH4)2SO4, 0.1 m NaCH3COO, pH 4.555% acetone, 50 mm glycine, pH 9.01.25m Li2SO4, 0.1 m HEPES, pH 7.01.5 m (NH4)2SO4, 20 mm MES, pH 7.0Space groupP21P212121P21P212121C2Unit cella = 41.2 Åa = 54.2 Åa = 41.4 Åa = 53.5 Åa = 66.56 Åb = 78.1 Åb = 60.4 Åb = 78.7 Åb = 60.3 Åb = 54.15 Åc = 36.7 Åc = 82.7 Åc = 36.8 Åc = 83.4 Åc = 62.73 Åβ = 115.0 °β = 115.0 °β = 91.87 ° Open table in a new tab The Gln-2 side chain coordinates the calcium ion in wild type subtilisin. In the first Δ75–83 Sbt structure, 1SUC, residues 1–3 are disordered. The Q2K mutation doubles the half-time of inactivation of calcium-free Sbt relative to 1SUC (Table II). Lys-2 is observed to form two hydrogen bonds. The side chain amine forms a salt-link with Asp-41. This mimics the interaction of residue 41 to the calcium ion in wild type Sbt (see Figs. 3 and4). The other hydrogen bond is between the main chain amide and a water molecule. These new bonds found in S88 are not seen in 1SUC and S63 in which the N terminus is disordered. Because computer graphics modeling indicated that positions 3 and 206 could potentially interact, the combinations of random mutations were screened at these two positions. This process resulted in a highly stabilizing disulfide with conformational angles χ1 = −39°, χ2 = 180°, χSS = −102°, χ2′ = −104°, and χ1′ = 75° (see Fig. 4). The electron density for the region is shown in Fig. 3. The 3–206 disulfide cross-link would not be able to form in any of the natural subtilisins, because the site A loop separates the N-terminal amino acids from the 202–219 β-ribbon. Therefore, the benefit of a 3–206 disulfide is novel to loop-deleted Sbts. The cross-link was found to increase the half-time of thermal inactivation 17-fold relative to 1SUC. Proteins reported previously to be stabilized because of introduced disulfides include subtilisin E (25Takagi H. Takahashi T. Momose H. Inouye M. Maeda Y. Matsuzawa H. Ohta T. J. Biol.

Serine was observed to be the best substitution for proline at position five in the S46 background (no disulfide) where this mutation resulted in only a 1.2-fold increase in half-life. Because of the potential interdependence of changes in this region, random mutations at positions 2, 5, and 41 were rescreened in the context of the 3–206 disulfide. Rescreening identified no new stabilizing mutations at positions 2 or 41 but showed the P5S change to result in significant stabilization. The P5S mutation in S88 subtilisin resulted in a 2.8-fold increase in half-life at 60 °C in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 50 mm NaCl, and 10 mm EDTA (240 min compared with 85 min for Pro-5). Ser-5 forms five hydrogen bonds, two of them involving the hydroxyl to the main chain amide of residue 7 and to the buried side chain of His-226. Pro-5 in the 1SUC structure has only one hydrogen bond involving the main chain carbonyl. The new hydrogen bonds probably are primary factors in the increased thermal stability from the P5S mutation. The increased backbone flexibility of Ser may also play a part, although the φ- and ψ-angles of residue 5 are not significantly altered. The melting and thermal inactivation data for the wild type, 1SUP, S63, and S88 are presented in TableIV. To measure the activity of 1SUC and S63, cysteine 221 was changed back to serine 221, producing S46 and S59, respectively. The data were taken in chelating conditions (10 mm EDTA) at 60 °C. Although S88 and wild type have similar proteolytic activity at 25° without EDTA, S88 loses activity approximately 1000 times slower than wild type in EDTA at 60 °C. The t12 for wild type is 0.2 min, and for S88, t12 is 240 min. The t12 for 1SUC is 2.1 min, and for S63, t12 is 15 min. This means that in chelating conditions, S88 is more stable than the wild type, 1SUC, and S63. The same trend is found in the comparison of the melting temperatures of the wild type, 1SUC, S63, and S88.Table IVInactivation times and melting temperatures of subtilisin variantsSubtilisin variantt½ (active version)Tmmin°CWild type0.2 (0.06)65 (0.5)S34/S462.1 (0.1)69 (0.5)S63/S5915.0 (0.4)71 (0.5)S70/S6716.5 (0.5)71 (0.5)S88240.0 (4.0)84 (0.5)Half-time was measured in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 50 mm NaCl, and 10 mm EDTA at 60 °C using the active S221 variants on the left.

All of the Tmmeasurements were carried out in 100 mm KPO4, pH 7.0, at a scan rate of 1 °/min. Uncertainties are given in parentheses. The crystal structures of S63 and S88 were compared with each of the three other Sbts: 1) 1SUC, the first calcium-free Sbt; 2) 1SUP, wild type Sbt; and 3) 1SUA, calcium-free Sbt in the same crystal form as S88. The crystallization and mutation comparisons of five subtilisin variants are shown in Table III. The comparison of the five structures using the program ALIGN reveals that all of the structures are essentially the same but not in the region of the mutations. The root mean square deviation is below 0.3 Å for all of the comparisons. The superposition in Fig. 3 shows that the N terminus in the S88 crystal structure has moved toward the space created by the deletion of the calcium binding loop. The C-α positions of residues 1 and 2 have moved by 7.6 and 5.9 Å respectively. The point at which the path of the main chain diverges between the two structures is Gly-7 where the ψ-angle changed from 136° in 1SUP to 160° in S88. Interestingly, Tyr-6 is found in the same conformation in these two structures, but in 1SUC, 1SUA, and S63, the side chain of Tyr-6 adopts a different more exposed rotamer. Evidently the rotameric state of Tyr-6 is sensitive to the destabilization of the N terminus, and when the N terminus is retethered by the new disulfide, Tyr-6 returns to its wild type position. S63 and S88 are two new variants of calcium-independent subtilisin, featuring several mutations selected for increased thermostability from random mutants. The crystal structures of S63 and S88 at high resolution have been determined, and the molecular structures of these two enzymes have been compared with three previous structures of Sbt. Despite the variations in sequence, chemical conditions, and crystal symmetry interactions, the structures are all similar but not in the N-terminal region adjacent to the site A deletion. S88 has a disulfide bond between the new cysteines at positions 3 and 206. This disulfide bond anchors the N terminus and contributes to the dramatic increase in thermostability in S88. In addition to the new disulfide bond, S88 includes several other mutations that combine to increase its thermostability relative to 1SUC by ∼1000-fold in chelating conditions. The apparent mechanisms of stabilization include modulations of conformational flexibility, increases in Van der Waals interaction, and a salt-link and hydrogen bonds that stabilize the N terminus.

https://openalex.org/W1991970454,"The pituitary homeobox factor-1 (Pitx-1) transactivates a number of pituitary-specific genes through direct interaction with other specific transcription factors. We demonstrate here that Pitx-1 plays a crucial role in the regulation of the Chinook salmon luteinizing hormone β gene promoter through a number of novel mechanisms. On the proximal promoter its action involves a synergistic effect with steroidogenic factor-1 (SF-1) alone or in combination with the estrogen receptor; promoter activity being induced by 9- or 35-fold over controls, respectively. Further upstream, a series of four Pitx-1 response elements (located between 1366 and 1506 bp from the transcriptional start site) is also involved in regulating the promoter activity. The two distal sequences have the greatest effect on the basal activity and are also essential for the gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) response. Mammalian two-hybrid assays revealed that Pitx-1 can homodimerize. Moreover, circular permutation assays indicate that binding of Pitx-1 to more than one response element induces conformational changes of the target DNA. This constitutes an additional mechanism through which Pitx-1 can mediate transactivation of this gene, allowing the demonstrated interaction of proximal response elements and distal enhancers, thus facilitating the maximal GnRH response that was seen in the longer promoter constructs. Our research also indicates that Pitx-1 is phosphorylated on three residues when bound to the DNA."
https://openalex.org/W2028920833,"Inappropriate activation of the mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) results in renal sodium retention and potassium loss in patients with liver cirrhosis. Recent evidence suggested that this MR activation is, at least in part, a result of bile acid-dependent reduction in 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 2 (11βHSD2) activity, an enzyme preventing cortisol-dependent activation of MR by converting cortisol to cortisone. Here, we investigated the molecular mechanisms underlying bile acid-mediated MR activation. Analysis of urinary bile acids from 12 patients with biliary obstruction revealed highly elevated concentrations of chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA), cholic acid (CA), and deoxycholic acid (DCA), with average concentrations of 50–80 μm. Although CDCA and DCA both mediated nuclear translocation of MR in the absence of 11βHSD2 and steroids in transiently expressing HEK-293 cells, the transcriptional activity of MR was not stimulated. In contrast, CDCA and DCA both inhibited 11βHSD2 with IC50 values of 22 and 38 μm, respectively and caused cortisol-dependent nuclear translocation and increased transcriptional activity of MR. LCA, the bile acid that most efficiently inhibited 11βHSD2, was present at very low concentrations in cholestatic patients, whereas the weak inhibitor CA did not cause MR activation. In conclusion, these findings indicate that CDCA, and to a lesser extent DCA, by inhibiting 11βHSD2, mediate cortisol-dependent nuclear translocation and transcriptional activation of MR and are responsible at least for a part of the sodium retention and potassium excretion observed in patients with biliary obstruction.

That cortisol-induced MR activation due to reduced 11βHSD2 activity upon inhibition by bile acids can account for at least part of the sodium retention and potassium loss in cirrhotic rats and in patients with cholestasis was suggested by the following findings. (i) Bile acid concentrations can increase by a factor of 100 under cholestatic conditions (26Neale G. Lewis B. Weaver V. Panveliwalla D. Gut. 1971; 12: 145-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 27Stiehl A. Clin. Gastroenterol. 1977; 6: 45-67PubMed Google Scholar). (ii) Bile acid-dependent inhibition of the activity of 11βHSD enzymes was demonstrated using total renal microsomes (7Perschel F.H. Buhler H. Hierholzer K.

Reichen J. Frey B.M. Frey F.J. Hepatology. 1999; 30: 623-629Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). (iii) In bile duct-ligated rats, an animal model of liver cirrhosis, the urinary ratio of (tetrahydrocorticosterone + 5α-tetrahydrocorticosterone)/11-dehydrotetrahydrocorticosterone, anin vivo measure of 11βHSD2 activity, was significantly increased, indicating inhibition of 11βHSD2 (12Ackermann D. Vogt B. Escher G. Dick B. Reichen J. Frey B.M. Frey F.J. Hepatology. 1999; 30: 623-629Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). (iv) Rats treated with chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA) developed increased blood pressure (10Morris D.J. Souness G.W. Endocr. Res. 1996; 22: 793-801Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), and adrenalectomized rats treated with CDCA showed enhanced renal sodium retention and urinary potassium excretion (9Latif S.A. Hartman L.R. Souness G.W. Morris D.J. Steroids. 1994; 59: 352-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). (v) A study in 12 patients with cholestasis, with an average total bile acid concentration of 65 μm, showed a significantly increased urinary ratio of (tetrahydrocortisol + 5α-tetrahydrocortisol)/tetrahydrocortisone indicating impaired activity of 11βHSD2; after removal of biliary obstruction both bile acid concentrations and glucocorticoid metabolites normalized in all 12 patients, suggesting that the observed reduction of 11βHSD2 activity during cholestasis was caused by bile acids (13Quattropani C. Vogt B. Odermatt A. Dick B. Frey B.M. Frey F.J. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 108: 1299-1305Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). However, several important questions regarding the mechanisms by which the presence of increased bile acid concentrations lead to inappropriate activation of MR remain to be answered. First, is the observed sodium retention and potassium excretion caused by direct activation of MR by bile acids, or indirectly by cortisol-induced MR activation due to the inhibition of 11βHSD2? Second, does cortisol in the presence of bile acids lead to transcriptional activation of MR, and third, which of the bile acids present in patients with cholestasis are responsible for the observed effects? Therefore, we investigated the molecular mechanisms underlying the bile acid-dependent inhibition of 11βHSD2 and the subsequent activation of MR. Cell culture media and LipofectAMINE Plus reagent were purchased from Invitrogen. NAD+, cortisol, and mouse monoclonal anti-FLAG M2 antibody were from Sigma Chemical.

The 12 patients (8 women and 4 men) with obstructive jaundice showed a mean serum bilirubin of 140 μm (105–305 μm, 4× the upper range) and were described previously (13Quattropani C. Vogt B. Odermatt A. Dick B. Frey B.M. Frey F.J. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 108: 1299-1305Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Choledocholithiasis was the underlying disease state in nine patients, while malformation of the bile duct, carcinoma of pancreas, and carcinoma of choledochus was the etiology in one patient each. Urinary total bile acids were quantitated by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry as described recently (13Quattropani C. Vogt B. Odermatt A. Dick B. Frey B.M. Frey F.J. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 108: 1299-1305Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). HEK-293 cells (300,000 per well) were grown on glass cover slips in 6-well plates containing 2 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. Transient transfections were performed 24 h later by using the calcium phosphate precipitation method with 1 μg of MR cDNA and 0.5 μg of 11βHSD2 cDNA per well. 6 h post-transfection, cells were washed twice with medium that was charcoal-stripped twice followed by incubation in this medium for 14 h. Cells were then incubated in the presence or absence of the appropriate concentrations of bile acids for 5 min as indicated, followed by the addition of 10 nmcortisol. Cells were incubated for 45 min at 37 °C, washed once with buffer NAPS (150 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.4, 120 mm sucrose), followed by fixation with 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min. Immunostaining was performed as described (29Odermatt A. Arnold P. Stauffer A. Frey B.M. Frey F.J. J. Biol.

In coexpression experiments with AR or GFP-MR, human 11βHSD2 was detected with a rabbit polyclonal antibody (provided by Z. N. Kyossev, Ref. 37Kyossev Z. Walker P.D. Reeves W.B. Kidney Int. 1996; 49: 271-281Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) and secondary ALEXA-594 anti-rabbit antibody. Immunofluorescence was detected using a Carl Zeiss confocal microscope LSM410 (Carl Zeiss, Goettingen, Germany). The intracellular localization of steroid receptors in 11βHSD2-positive cells was determined by distinguishing three different categories: C, for predominant staining of cytoplasm or endoplasmic reticulum membrane; C/N, when cytoplasmic/reticular and nuclear staining were of comparable intensity; N, for predominantly nuclear staining. Results were obtained from at least three independent transfection experiments, whereby between 200 and 300 stained cells of each sample were determined by an observer who was blinded to the cell treatment procedures. CHO cells (100,000 per well) were grown in 12-well plates containing 1 ml of an equal mixture of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and F12 medium, supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. Transient transfection was performed 24 h later with LipofectAMINE Plus reagent in Optimem using 0.05 μg of SV40-luciferase plasmid and 0.3 μg of MMTV-lacZ plasmid as reporters and 0.2 μg of MR and 0.1 μg of 11βHSD2 or empty pcDNA3 vector, respectively. 4 h post-transfection, cells were washed twice with medium that was charcoal-stripped twice followed by incubation in this medium for 20 h. Cells were then incubated with 100 μm of the corresponding bile acid for 5 min before adding 10 nm aldosterone or 100 nm cortisol and incubated for another 24 h. Cells were then harvested and luciferase and galactosidase activities determined using the Dual-Light kit according to the manufacturer's instructions. The ratio of galactosidase to luciferase was calculated in all experiments. The cell viability was analyzed by incubating transfected HEK-293 cells and CHO cells for 1 h with the corresponding concentration of bile acid and staining with trypan blue. The toxicity of bile acids was analyzed using the tetrazolium salt MTT (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) according to the cell proliferation kit I from Roche Diagnostics. No significant differences between control and bile acid-treated cells were obtained in both tests. 11βHSD2 enzyme activity was measured in cell lysates as described (29Odermatt A. Arnold P. Stauffer A. Frey B.M. Frey F.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28762-28770Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Briefly, transfected HEK-293 cells, incubated in charcoal-treated Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium for 24 h, were washed once with Hanks' solution and resuspended in a buffer containing 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 250 mmsucrose, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4. Cells were lysed by freezing in liquid nitrogen. Dehydrogenase activity was measured in a final volume of 20 μl containing the appropriate concentration of bile acid, 30 nCi of [3H]cortisol, and unlabeled cortisol to a final concentrations of 50 nm. The reaction was started by mixing cell lysate with the reaction mixture. Alternatively, endoplasmic reticulum microsomes were prepared from transfected HEK-293 cells according to a procedure described previously (7Perschel F.H. Buhler H. Hierholzer K. Pflugers Arch. 1991; 418: 538-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) and incubated with reaction mixture containing various concentrations of cortisol and CDCA. Incubation proceeded for 20 min, and the conversion of cortisol to cortisone was determined by thin layer chromatography (TLC). Because of the inaccuracy of the TLC method at low conversion rates and the end-product inhibition of 11βHSD2 at conversion rates higher than 60–70%, only conversion rates between 10 and 60% were considered for calculation. The inhibitory constant IC50 was evaluated using the curve-fitting program from MDL Information Inc., San Leandro, California. Results are expressed as means ± S.E. and consist of at least four independent measurements. To determine whether 11βHSD2 metabolizes CDCA, supernatants from cultures of HEK-293 cells transiently expressing 11βHSD2 were analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. As a recovery standard 4 μg of 23-nor-deoxycholic acid was added to 1 ml of cell culture supernatant, and the sample was extracted on a Sep-Pak C18 column. To this extract 4 μg of 5β-cholestan-3β-ol was added as a standard for derivatization and gas chromatography, and the sample was derivatized to form the methylester trimethylsilyl ether. The excess of silylating agent was removed by gel filtration on a Lipidx-5000 column. Samples were analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry using a Hewlett Packard gas chromatograph 6890 equipped with a mass selective detector 5973 by selected ion monitoring (SIM, programmed for 5 different bile acids) and in the scan mode to detect any potentially new metabolite formed from CDCA. To identify the major bile acids present in urine of patients with biliary obstruction, we determined by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry the concentrations of various bile acids in the urine of 12 cholestatic patients (13Quattropani C. Vogt B. Odermatt A. Dick B. Frey B.M. Frey F.J. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 108: 1299-1305Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) (Table I). Whereas urine from control individuals or from the 12 individuals after removal of biliary obstruction contained only negligible amounts of bile acids, the samples collected during cholestasis contained significantly increased concentrations of bile acids. CA, CDCA, and DCA were the three major constituents, with similar average concentrations between 50 and 80 μm. Compared with these three major bile acids, LCA and UDCA, although significantly increased compared with control individuals, were present at only low concentrations.Table IBile acid concentrations in urine from patients with cholestasis and at first review one month after removal of biliary obstructionPatient1-aThe patients and their values for CA and CDCA were described in Ref. 13.Total bile acids during cholestasisCACDCADCALCAUDCATotal bile acids after removal of biliary obstruction μmK.G.109593110.217.63.1S.F.27010370921.53.62.6J.K.6712.44380.63.26.0S.C.37141930.30.71.8H.U.29396801103.03.92.2G.M.282104711021.53.62.5R.I.22889114230.61.50.7R.O.52133620.40.66.0P.R.321117761071.219.83.9A.K.333141149310.911.45.2F.J.1759146240.712.811.1B.M.327114851222.14.2N.A.1-bN.A., not available.Mean208796852174.1S.E.M.331311140.220.91-a The patients and their values for CA and CDCA were described in Ref. 13Quattropani C.

Open table in a new tab Using transient coexpression of 11βHSD2 and MR in HEK-293 cells and fluorescence microscopic detection, we have recently shown that CDCA causes nuclear translocation of MR in the presence of low concentrations of cortisol (13Quattropani C. Vogt B. Odermatt A. Dick B. Frey B.M. Frey F.J. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 108: 1299-1305Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). To understand the molecular mechanisms underlying the bile acid-dependent increase in MR activity, we addressed now the question of whether bile acids can activate the MR directly, in the absence of cortisol, or whether the activation of MR is caused by cortisol upon inhibition of 11βHSD2. As reported previously, the MR showed a heterogeneous distribution in the absence of both 11βHSD2 and steroids, with approximately one-third of cells showing nuclear localization, one-third mixed cytoplasmic/reticular and nuclear distribution, and one-third showing cytoplasmic/reticular localization (30Odermatt A. Arnold P. Frey F.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 28484-28492Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the addition of CDCA or LCA led to the translocation of MR from the cytoplasm/endoplasmic reticulum membrane into the nucleus, with more than 90% of receptor molecules located in the nucleus at 100 μm of the corresponding bile acid (Table II). DCA was less efficient in mediating nuclear translocation of MR with effective concentrations of 200 μm and higher. In contrast, CA and UDCA, as well as the conjugated bile acids GCDCA and TCDCA did not affect the intracellular localization of MR at concentrations up to 200 μm. The observed effect of CDCA and LCA on MR was receptor-specific because neither CDCA, LCA, nor any other bile acid used in this study altered the intracellular localization of either AR or GR. Importantly, CDCA and LCA were only able to mediate nuclear translocation of MR in the absence of 11βHSD2 but not when the receptor was coexpressed with 11βHSD2. This protective effect of 11βHSD2 on MR was specific because coexpression of MR with several other steroid-metabolizing enzymes with reticular distribution and cytoplasmic orientation did not prevent CDCA-mediated nuclear MR translocation (Table II). We also tested whether 11βHSD2 can metabolize CDCA. Lysates of cells expressing 11βHSD2 were incubated in the presence of NAD+ and CDCA, followed by analysis using gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. No decrease in the amount of CDCA could be detected, and there were no detectable peaks that may indicate a novel metabolite (not shown), suggesting that the protective effect of 11βHSD2 on bile acid-mediated nuclear translocation of MR is not due to enzymatic inactivation of CDCA. The nuclear translocation of MR induced by aldosterone was not affected by bile acids both in absence or presence of 11βHSD2 (not shown).Table IIBile acid-induced nuclear translocation of MR in the absence of cortisolIncubation conditionsNC/NC Percentage of positive cellsMR24 ± 342 ± 434 ± 2MR, 10 nm aldosterone100 ± 000MR, 10 nm cortisol100 ± 000MR, 50 μm CDCA47 ± 1139 ± 614 ± 6MR, 100 μm CDCA94 ± 16 ± 11 ± 0MR, 100 μm CA9 ± 456 ± 335 ± 3MR, 200 μm CA7 ± 557 ± 336 ± 3MR, 100 μmDCA51 ± 1034 ± 815 ± 4MR, 200 μm DCA63 ± 1128 ± 79 ± 3MR, 50 μm LCA72 ± 527 ± 61 ± 0MR, 100 μm LCA95 ± 15 ± 10MR, 200 μmTCDCA12 ± 553 ± 334 ± 2MR, 200 μm GCDCA15 ± 649 ± 436 ± 2MR, 200 μm UDCA24 ± 446 ± 630 ± 3AR19 ± 1035 ± 547 ± 14AR, 100 nm testosterone100 ± 000AR, 100 μm CDCA22 ± 241 ± 538 ± 6AR, 100 μm LCA23 ± 447 ± 930 ± 7GR014 ± 386 ± 3GR, 50 nm cortisol100 ± 000GR, 100 μm CDCA018 ± 582 ± 5GR, 100 μm CA016 ± 484 ± 4GR, 100 μmDCA017 ± 583 ± 6GR, 100 μm LCA017 ± 483 ± 3GR, 100 μmUDCA014 ± 586 ± 6MR, 11βHSD2, 100 μm CDCA1 ± 07 ± 392 ± 2MR, 11βHSD1 (K5S, K6S), 100 μm CDCA97 ± 13 ± 10MR, 3αHSD, 100 μm CDCA98 ± 12 ± 10MR, 5α-reductase type I, 100 μm CDCA97 ± 23 ± 20MR, oxysterol 7α-hydroxylase, 100 μm CDCA98 ± 12 ± 10MR, cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase, 100 μm CDCA97 ± 13 ± 10HEK-293 cells were transfected with MR-GFP, epitope-tagged GR, AR, or MR or cotransfected with HA-tagged MR and FLAG-tagged 11βHSD2 or unrelated steroid metabolizing enzymes.

Cdc7 kinase activity fluctuates during cell cycle, and this is mainly the result of oscillation of expression of the Dbf4 subunit. Therefore, it is crucial to understand the mechanisms of regulation of Dbf4 expression. We have isolated and characterized the promoter region of the human ASK gene encoding Dbf4-related regulatory subunit for human Cdc7 kinase. We have identified a 63-base pair ASK promoter segment, which is sufficient for mediating growth stimulation. This minimal promoter segment (MP), containing an Sp1 site but no canonical E2F site, can be activated by ectopic E2F expression as well. Within the 63-base pair region, the Sp1 site as well as other elements are essential for stimulation by growth signals and by E2F, whereas an AT-rich sequence proximal to the coding region may serve as an element required for suppression in quiescence. Gel shift assays in the presence of an antibody demonstrate the presence of E2F1 in the protein-DNA complexes generated on the MP segment. However, the complex formation on MP was not competed by aDHFR promoter fragment, known to bind to E2F, nor by a consensus E2F binding oligonucleotide. Gel shift assays with point mutant MP fragments indicate that a non-canonical E2F site in the middle of this segment is critical for generation of the E2F complex. Our results suggest that E2F regulates theASK promoter through an atypical mode of recognition of the target site.

The replication of chromosomal DNA of eukaryotic cells is initiated from multiple replication origins. Thus, precise regulation of firing individual origins during S phase is critical for regulated growth of eukaryotic cells. Mechanisms of the initiation of DNA replication in eukaryotic cells are best understood in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae (1Stillman B. Science. 1996; 274: 1659-1664Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar, 2Toone W.M. Aerne B.L. Morgan B.A. Johnston L.H. Annu. Rev.

Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 829-880Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). Initiation of DNA replication is controlled by regulated assembly of a pre-replicative complex (pre-RC)1 at each replication origin. The pre-RC includes at least two protein complexes, the minichromosome maintenance (MCM) complex and the origin recognition complex (ORC), together with Cdc6 proteins (4Kelly T.J. Brown G.W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 829-880Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). The six-subunit ORC binds specifically to S. cerevisiae replication origins throughout the cell cycle. ORC recruits Cdc6, which in turn promotes loading of the MCM complex onto chromatin. Association of these proteins with chromatin during G1 renders it competent to respond to the second set of factors, the activation of which in late G1 is thought to trigger initiation. This second set of proteins includes a family of cyclin-dependent kinase (Cdk) and the Cdc7 kinase, the activities of which depend on G1/S-specific cyclin regulatory subunits (Clb5 and Clb6) and on the regulatory subunit called Dbf4, respectively (5Tanaka T. Nasmyth K. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5182-5191Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 6Nougarede R. Della Seta F. Zarzov P. Schwob E. Mol. Cell.

G1 Cdk activity is essential for progression from G0 or G1 to S phase. In mammalian cells, inhibition of either cyclin D- or cyclin E-dependent kinase activity prevents S phase induction (8Quelle D.E. Ashmun R.A. Shurtleff S.A. Kato J.Y. Bar-Sagi D. Roussel M.F.

At least part of the activities of these kinases is involved in the phosphorylation of retinoblastoma (Rb) protein, a tumor suppressor. The major role of Rb and Rb family members (p107 and p130) in cell growth control is the regulation of E2F transcription factors. It is now well known that E2F is essential for coordinating transcription during the mammalian cell cycle (10Helin K. Curr. Opin. Genet.

Because mutational analyses have shown that the ability of E2F proteins to drive cells into S phase requires their DNA binding and transactivation domains, and there is strong correlation between the ability of E2F to activate transcription of target genes and that to promote DNA synthesis (28Johnson D.G. Schwarz J.K. Cress W.D. Nevins J.R. Nature. 1993; 365: 349-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (833) Google Scholar, 29Shan B. Lee W.H. Mol. Cell.

Therefore, it is important to identify a critical target(s) of E2F for S phase induction to understand the mechanism of G1/S transition in mammalian cells. Thus far, among E2F-regulated genes, only the cyclin E gene, expression of which is both growth- and cell cycle-regulated, can partially replace E2F activity. Overexpression of cyclin E can drive cells into S phase in the absence of measurable E2F activity (33Lukas J. Herzinger T. Hansen K. Moroni M.C. Resnitzky D. Helin K. Reed S.I. Bartek J. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1479-1492Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar), and microinjection of active Cdk2-cyclin E kinase complex can induce S phase in quiescent fibroblasts (34Connell-Crowley L.

Conversely, however, overexpression of E2F1 was found to drive cells into S phase without significant activation of Cdk2-cyclin E kinase (35DeGregori J. Leone G. Ohtani K. Miron A. Nevins J.R.

These contradictory results suggest the existence of (a) common target(s) of E2F and Cdk2-cyclin E, the activity of which can be independently stimulated by E2F and Cdk2-cyclin E. Alternatively, S phase may be induced by redundant pathways, each of which can be activated by either E2F or Cdk2-cyclin E (11Dyson N. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2245-2262Crossref PubMed Scopus (1962) Google Scholar).Genetic studies in S. cerevisiae have indicated an essential role for Cdc7, another class of serine/threonine kinase, in initiation of S phase (37Johnston L.H.

Recent studies indicate that Cdc7 kinase activity is required not only for initiation of DNA replication, but also for origin firing throughout the S phase (40Bousset K. Diffley J.F. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 480-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar, 41Donaldson A.D. Fangman W.L. Brewer B.J. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 491-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Its kinase activity, which depends on the regulatory subunit Dbf4, increases at the G1/S boundary. This oscillation of Cdc7 kinase activity is caused mainly by fluctuation of the levels of Dbf4 mRNA and protein. In contrast to CDC7 gene, whose transcript level is constant throughout the cell cycle, DBF4 gene is transcriptionally regulated, reaching a maximum at the G1/S boundary (42Chapman J.W. Johnston L.H.

Gene (Amst.). 2001; 264: 249-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar), indicating that the regulatory mechanisms of initiation of DNA replication by Cdc7-related kinases are conserved among eukaryotes. Human ASK (for activator ofS phase kinase, also known as HsDbf4), has been isolated using yeast two-hybrid screening with huCdc7 as a bait (48Kumagai H. Sato N. Yamada M. Mahony D. Seghezzi W. Lees E. Arai K. Masai H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 5083-5095Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Transcription of ASK is repressed in quiescent cells and is induced by serum stimulation during the G0 to S phase progression. The ASK mRNA and protein levels fluctuate during the proliferating cell cycle, whereas huCdc7 is relatively constant. The ASK protein level is low in G1 phase, increases as cells progress into S phase, and is maintained at a high level throughout the S phase. Accordingly, the huCdc7 kinase activity shows similar cell cycle oscillation. Microinjection of ASK-specific antibodies into human cells inhibited DNA replication (48Kumagai H. Sato N. Yamada M. Mahony D. Seghezzi W. Lees E. Arai K. Masai H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 5083-5095Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). These results suggest that ASK plays a crucial role in cell proliferation, especially in S phase regulation, through up-regulation of huCdc7 kinase activity. Therefore, it is important to understand the mechanisms of regulation of ASK expression during cell cycle.For this purpose, we isolated the promoter region of humanASK gene and investigated the cis-elements andtrans-acting factors involved in regulation ofASK gene expression. We show here that a 63-bp segment of the human ASK promoter containing a typical Sp1 binding site but no canonical E2F binding site can confer growth regulation and stimulation by E2F transcription factor. One of the key problems in cell proliferation is to achieve faithful and coordinated replication of their genomes. The replication of chromosomal DNA of eukaryotic cells is initiated from multiple replication origins. Thus, precise regulation of firing individual origins during S phase is critical for regulated growth of eukaryotic cells. Mechanisms of the initiation of DNA replication in eukaryotic cells are best understood in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae (1Stillman B. Science. 1996; 274: 1659-1664Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar, 2Toone W.M. Aerne B.L. Morgan B.A. Johnston L.H. Annu. Rev.

Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 829-880Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). Initiation of DNA replication is controlled by regulated assembly of a pre-replicative complex (pre-RC)1 at each replication origin. The pre-RC includes at least two protein complexes, the minichromosome maintenance (MCM) complex and the origin recognition complex (ORC), together with Cdc6 proteins (4Kelly T.J. Brown G.W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 829-880Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). The six-subunit ORC binds specifically to S. cerevisiae replication origins throughout the cell cycle. ORC recruits Cdc6, which in turn promotes loading of the MCM complex onto chromatin. Association of these proteins with chromatin during G1 renders it competent to respond to the second set of factors, the activation of which in late G1 is thought to trigger initiation. This second set of proteins includes a family of cyclin-dependent kinase (Cdk) and the Cdc7 kinase, the activities of which depend on G1/S-specific cyclin regulatory subunits (Clb5 and Clb6) and on the regulatory subunit called Dbf4, respectively (5Tanaka T.

Human ASK (for activator ofS phase kinase, also known as HsDbf4), has been isolated using yeast two-hybrid screening with huCdc7 as a bait (48Kumagai H. Sato N. Yamada M. Mahony D. Seghezzi W. Lees E. Arai K. Masai H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 5083-5095Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Transcription of ASK is repressed in quiescent cells and is induced by serum stimulation during the G0 to S phase progression. The ASK mRNA and protein levels fluctuate during the proliferating cell cycle, whereas huCdc7 is relatively constant. The ASK protein level is low in G1 phase, increases as cells progress into S phase, and is maintained at a high level throughout the S phase. Accordingly, the huCdc7 kinase activity shows similar cell cycle oscillation. Microinjection of ASK-specific antibodies into human cells inhibited DNA replication (48Kumagai H. Sato N. Yamada M. Mahony D. Seghezzi W. Lees E. Arai K. Masai H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 5083-5095Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). These results suggest that ASK plays a crucial role in cell proliferation, especially in S phase regulation, through up-regulation of huCdc7 kinase activity. Therefore, it is important to understand the mechanisms of regulation of ASK expression during cell cycle. For this purpose, we isolated the promoter region of humanASK gene and investigated the cis-elements andtrans-acting factors involved in regulation ofASK gene expression. We show here that a 63-bp segment of the human ASK promoter containing a typical Sp1 binding site but no canonical E2F binding site can confer growth regulation and stimulation by E2F transcription factor.

This and other studies show that there are major contacts between the two strands at both ends of the molecule that evidently sequester the receptor binding domains. Upon proteinase cleavage of the bait domains and subsequent thiol ester cleavages, which occur near the central region of the molecule, the two strands separate by 40 Å at both ends of the structure to expose the receptor binding domains and form the arm-like extensions of the transformed α<sub>2</sub>M. During the transformation of the structure, the strands untwist to expose the α<sub>2</sub>M central cavity to the proteinase. This extraordinary change in the architecture of α<sub>2</sub>M functions to completely engulf two molecules of chymotrypsin within its central cavity and to irreversibly encapsulate them."

Most recently an additional layer of complexity has been added by reports suggesting that insulin exerts an autocrine stimulatory effect on insulin secretion from the β-cell (6Aspinwall C.A. Lakey J.R.T. Kennedy R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6360-6365Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar, 7Aspinwall C.A. Qian W.-J. Roper M.G. Kulkarni R.N. Kahn C.R.

This concept was based primarily on amperometric measurements using β-cells preincubated in 5-hydroxytryptamine (5HT).1 Because 5HT exposure exerts inhibitory effects on insulin release (8Lernmark A. Horm. Metab. Res. 1971; 3: 305-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 9Gagliardino J.J. Nierle C. Pfeiffer E.F.

Moreover, previous studies exploring the potential role of insulin on stimulated secretion showed no effect (11Schatz H. Pfeiffer E.F. J. Endocrinol. 1977; 74: 243-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) or supported the concept that insulin exerts a negative, not positive, feedback on its own secretion (12Iversen J. Miles D.W. Diabetes. 1971; 20: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 13Ammon H.P. Reiber C. Verspohl E.J. J. Endocrinol. 1991; 128: 27-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 14Loreti L.

Med. 1969; 130: 568-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). There are at least three major issues that must be addressed in attempting to establish the impact of exogenously added insulin on endogenous insulin secretory rates. The first is technical; it is difficult to accurately measure endogenous insulin release rates in the presence of exogenous insulin. The second relates to concentration of insulin necessary to establish an effect of exogenously added hormone on the β-cell. Considering that the β-cell continually releases insulin into a small volume of interstitial fluid, the level of insulin bathing the β-cell may be quite high. For example, calculations based on islet cell volume, the insulin diffusion constant and insulin secretory rates, suggest that these levels may exceed 100 nm during glucose stimulation (16Zawalich W.S. Karl R.C. Ferrendelli J.A. Matschinsky F.M. Diabetologia. 1975; 11: 231-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Even at rest, levels of insulin far in excess of circulating plasma levels must exist at the interface of the β-cell membrane and the interstitium. Third, the contribution of constitutive insulin release to the secretory responses observed has to be considered. The necessary insulin signaling components identified in insulin-sensitive tissues including insulin receptors, insulin receptor substrate proteins, and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase have been found in β-cells (17Verspohl E.J. Ammon H.P. J. Clin. Invest. 1980; 65: 1230-1237Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 18Xu G.G. Rothenberg P.L. Diabetes. 1998; 47: 1243-1252PubMed Google Scholar, 19Harbeck M.C. Louie D.C. Howland J. Wolf B.A. Rothenberg P.L. Diabetes. 1996; 45: 711-717Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Because there is constitutive secretion of insulin, a tonic level of insulin signaling in these cells may influence acute stimulatory responses and thus obscure any effect of exogenously added insulin. These three issues, in addition to the use of different species and disparate methodological approaches, may account in part for the discrepancies regarding the impact of insulin on its own secretion (11Schatz H. Pfeiffer E.F. J. Endocrinol. 1977; 74: 243-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 12Iversen J. Miles D.W. Diabetes. 1971; 20: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 14Loreti L.

Endocrinology. 1972; 91: 168-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). To circumvent the first problem, and to establish the effect of exogenously added insulin on its own secretion, we have measured connecting (C)-peptide secretion rates in response to a variety of agonists from isolated perifused rat islets. Finally, the impact of insulin signaling on 10 mm glucose-induced secretion was explored using several compounds known to antagonize the kinases activated by insulin. The detailed methodologies employed to assess insulin output from collagenase-isolated rat islets have been described previously (22Zawalich W.S. Zawalich K.C. J. Endocrinol. 2000; 166: 111-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 23Zawalich W.S. Zawalich K.C. Endocrinology. 2000; 141: 3287-3295Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Male Sprague-Dawley rats (350–475g) were purchased from Charles River Laboratories, Inc. (Wilmington, MA). All animals were treated in a manner that complied with the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Guidelines for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (NIH publication no. 85–23, revised 1985). The animals were fed ad libitum. After intraperitoneal Nembutal (pentobarbital sodium, 50 mg/kg; Abbott Laboratories, Abbott Park, IL)-induced anesthesia, islets were isolated by collagenase digestion and handpicked, using a glass loop pipette, under a stereomicroscope. They were free of exocrine contamination. Groups of 14–18 freshly isolated islets were perifused with Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate at a flow rate of 1 ml/min for 30 or 45 min with 3 mm glucose to establish basal and stable insulin and C-peptide secretory rates. After this stabilization period they were then perifused with the appropriate agonist or agonist combinations as indicated in the figure legends and under “Results.” Perifusate solutions were gassed with 95% O2/5% CO2 and maintained at 37 °C. Insulin (24Albano J.D.M. Ekins R.P. Maritz G. Turner R.C. Acta Endocrinol. 1972; 70: 487-509Crossref PubMed Scopus (544) Google Scholar) and rat C-peptide released into the medium were measured by radioimmunoassay; in the case of C-peptide measurements the protocol provided by the vendor was followed rigorously. C-peptide and, when possible, insulin release rates were measured in the same perifusate samples. Groups of 14–18 islets were cultured as described previously (25Zawalich W.S. Bonnet-Eymard M. Zawalich K.C. Yaney G.C. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: C1388-C1396Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 26Zawalich W.S. Zawalich K.C. Kelley G.G. Eur. J. Physiol. 1996; 432: 589-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) for 18 h in CMRL-1066 containing 5.5 mm glucose and supplemented with penicillin (50 units/ml), streptomycin (50 μg/ml) and glutamine to achieve a final concentration of 2 mm. After this, the islets were perifused as described above. Hanks' solution was used for the islet isolation. The Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate perifusion medium consisted of 115 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 2.2 mmCaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 24 mm NaHCO3, and 0.17 g/dl bovine serum albumin. The 125I-labeled insulin used for the insulin assay was purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Bovine serum albumin (RIA grade), glucose, carbachol, wortmannin, genistein, glutamine, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), bovine insulin (Cat. no. I5500), human recombinant insulin, and the salts used to make the Hanks' solution and perifusion medium were purchased from Sigma. Genistein and wortmannin were dissolved in Me2SO, and equivalent amounts of diluent were used in control studies. Rat insulin standard (lot 615-ZS-157) was the generous gift of Dr. Gerald Gold, Eli Lilly (Indianapolis, IN). CMRL-1066 and the antibiotics employed for the culture studies were purchased from Invitrogen. Collagenase (Type P) was obtained from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. Rat C-peptide was measured using kits purchased from Linco Research, St. Charles, MO. Statistical significance was determined using the Student's t test for unpaired data or analysis of variance in conjunction with the Newman-Keuls test for unpaired data. Ap value ≤0.05 was taken as significant. Values presented in the figure legends and under “Results” represent means ± S.E. of at least three observations. In the initial series of experiments isolated perifused rat islets were stimulated with 10 mm glucose. Insulin and C-peptide secretory rates were measured in the same perifusate samples. As shown in Fig. 1, islet responses to 10 mm glucose (in terms of peptide secretory rates) were kinetically and quantitatively very similar. Both the C-peptide and insulin responses were biphasic in nature and, when compared with prestimulatory release rates measured in the presence of 3 mm glucose, the addition of 10 mm glucose resulted in ∼15-fold increments in the output of both peptides. Similar, although amplified, C-peptide and insulin responses were obtained when the perifusate glucose level was increased to 15 mm (results not shown). In the next experiment, islets were stimulated with 8 mm glucose, a level of the hexose that resulted in a modest 4–5-fold increase in insulin secretory rates (Fig.2). For example, in the presence of 3 mm glucose islets released 30–35 pg of insulin/islet/min. After 40 min of stimulation with 8 mm glucose, the secretory rate increased to 143 ± 17 (n = 5) pg/islet/min. A similar response in terms of C-peptide secretion was also observed. Prestimulatory secretion rates (5–6 pg/islet/min) increased to 31 ± 5 pg/islet/min. To assess the potential impact of exogenous insulin on glucose-induced secretion, additional groups of islets were stimulated with 8 mm glucose plus 100 nm bovine insulin. The addition of exogenous insulin precluded the measurement of endogenous insulin secretion. However, using C-peptide secretion rates as an index of the endogenous insulin secretory response, no effect of added bovine insulin on C-peptide secretory rates was seen. 40 min after the onset of 8 mmglucose stimulation, C-peptide secretory rates averaged 32 ± 3 pg/islet/min in the presence of 100 nm bovine insulin. Although not shown, we could detect no inhibitory effect of 100 nm bovine insulin on C-peptide responses to 7 or 10 mm glucose, levels of the hexose that increase endogenous insulin secretion about 2- or 10–15-fold, respectively, above those observed with 3 mm glucose. It has been reported that 100 nm exogenous bovine insulin in the presence of 3 mm glucose increases insulin secretion from β-cells, a response monitored not by the release of insulin but by 5HT release from 5HT-prelabeled β-cells (6Aspinwall C.A. Lakey J.R.T. Kennedy R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6360-6365Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). We directly tested this concept in perifused islets, which retain a level of physiologic sensitivity to glucose stimulation comparable with that observed with the perfused rat pancreas preparation (27Gerich J.E. Charles M.A. Grodsky G.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1974; 54: 833-841Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar, 28Curry D.L. Endocrinology. 1986; 118: 170-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 29Grill V. Adamson U. Cerasi E. J. Clin. Invest. 1978; 61: 1034-1043Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). After a 45-min stabilization period in the presence of 3 mm glucose, islets were perifused with 100 nm bovine insulin or 500 nm human insulin in the continued presence of 3 mm glucose. There was no stimulatory effect of either insulin preparation on C-peptide secretion rates (Fig.3). Throughout the perifusion, basal and stable rates of C-peptide secretion were noted. We considered that the process of collagenase isolating islets may disrupt β-cell membrane integrity and that the lack of any effect of insulin on C-peptide secretion may be a consequence of this potential adverse effect of the isolation procedure. To address this concern, two sets of additional experiments were conducted. In the first set of experiments (Fig. 4) islets were stimulated with 7 mm glucose plus 5 μm carbachol, a cholinergic agonist that activates phospholipase C via a membrane muscarinic receptor (30Loubatieres-Mariani M.M. Chapal J. Alric R. Loubatieres A. Diabetologia. 1973; 9: 439-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 31Zawalich W.S. Zawalich K.C. Rasmussen H. Endocrinology. 1989; 125: 2400-2406Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 32Kelley G.G. Zawalich K.C. Zawalich W.S. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 269: E575-E582PubMed Google Scholar). Islets stimulated with 7 mm glucose plus 5 μm carbachol responded with an approximate 4-fold increase in both insulin and C-peptide secretion rates. The response to this agonist combination was ∼2.5-fold greater than the response to 7 mm glucose alone (results not shown). For example, 20, 30 or 40 min after the onset of stimulation with 7 mm glucose alone insulin release rates averaged 53 ± 9, 57 ± 10, or 58 ± 12 pg/islet/min (n = 8), respectively. The addition of carbachol increased the values at these times to 109 ± 29, 125 ± 18, or 126 ± 19 pg/islet/min (n = 5), respectively. The further addition of 100 nm insulin had no effect on C-peptide secretion to glucose plus carbachol stimulation (Fig. 4). In the next set of experiments, islets were first cultured for 18 h to allow more complete recovery of any potential adverse impact of the collagenase isolation procedure. Islets were then perifused with 3 mm glucose to establish basal C-peptide secretion rates prior to stimulation with 500 nm human insulin. Similar to the observations made with freshly isolated islets, the addition of human insulin was without any stimulatory effect on C-peptide secretion rates. Because culturing impairs islet sensitivity to glucose stimulation alone (25Zawalich W.S. Bonnet-Eymard M. Zawalich K.C. Yaney G.C. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: C1388-C1396Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 33Malaisse-Lagae F. Sener A. Malaisse W.J. Acta Diabetol. Lat. 1987; 24: 17-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 34Metz S.A. Diabetes. 1988; 37: 3-7Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), these islets were then stimulated with the combination of 20 mm glucose plus 500 nmPMA (Fig. 5). This agonist combination resulted in an ∼25-fold increase in C-peptide secretion rates from both control and prior insulin-stimulated islets. In an attempt to disrupt the contribution of constitutive insulin signaling on glucose-stimulated β-cell responses of our perifused islet preparation, additional studies were conducted with the tyrosine kinase inhibitor genistein (10 μm) and the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitor wortmannin (50 nm). Both types of kinases are established participants in insulin signaling (35Virkamäki A. Ueki K. Kahn C.R. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 103: 931-943Crossref PubMed Scopus (726) Google Scholar, 36Pessin E.J. Saltiel R.A. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 106: 165-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (685) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 6, both inhibitors significantly potentiated 10 mm glucose-induced secretion. Several important considerations have emerged in our attempt to establish the precise impact of exogenously added insulin on endogenous insulin secretory rates. First is the realization that the levels of insulin bathing the β-cell, even under basal nonstimulatory conditions, must far exceed those normally bathing other tissues. This has to do with islet cell volume, limited interstitial space distribution, and constitutive rates of hormone output (16Zawalich W.S. Karl R.C. Ferrendelli J.A. Matschinsky F.M. Diabetologia. 1975; 11: 231-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Any attempt to establish either an inhibitory or excitatory effect of exogenous insulin on endogenous secretion must contend with this. For example, if insulin does indeed inhibit its own release as suggested in other reports (12Iversen J. Miles D.W. Diabetes. 1971; 20: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 14Loreti L. Dunbar J.C. Chen S. Foà P.P. Diabetologia. 1974; 10: 309-315PubMed Google Scholar, 20Ammon H.P.T. Verspohl E. Endocrinology. 1976; 99: 1469-1476Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), an inhibitory effect of added exogenous insulin on the secretory response to glucose might not be observed if saturating (with regards to insulin signaling) endogenous hormone concentrations already exist in the interstitial space and tonically influence secretion. In addition, it is technically difficult to measure endogenous insulin release rates in the presence of high levels of exogenously added hormone. In an attempt to circumvent these issues two approaches were utilized. First, we used C-peptide secretion rates as a surrogate marker for endogenous insulin secretion (37Steiner D.F. Diabetes. 1977; 26: 322-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Second, constitutive insulin signaling in the β-cell was disrupted using inhibitors known to interfere with the kinases involved in the insulin signaling cascade. Several salient points emerge from the present studies. First, C-peptide secretion rates accurately reflect both quantitatively and qualitatively the kinetics and amplitude of insulin secretion. Like insulin output in response to 10 mm glucose, it is biphasic in nature. Most importantly in terms of sensitivity, small increments in glucose-induced insulin release evoked by 7–8 mmglucose evoke small, easily measurable increments in C-peptide release. Third, in terms of inhibition of insulin secretion, we could not detect any inhibitory effect of exogenously added bovine insulin on glucose-induced insulin secretion. Fourth, neither bovine nor human insulin at levels of 100–500 nm had any discernible stimulatory effect on C-peptide secretion rates and, based on the tight coupling between C-peptide and insulin secretion demonstrated in these studies, exerted no stimulatory effect on insulin release as well. Fifth, addition of a membrane-active agonist, carbachol, evoked substantial insulin and C-peptide responses indicating that at least for this agonist the functional integrity of its membrane receptor has been maintained during the isolation procedures. However, because the insulin receptor may be more vulnerable to collagenase than the muscarinic cholinergic receptor, islets were allowed to recover from the isolation procedure during an 18-h culturing period. These islets still failed to respond to exogenously added insulin by increasing C-peptide secretion rates. We were unable to document any inhibitory effect of exogenously added insulin on its own secretion using C-peptide as the surrogate marker for insulin release. Does this failure exclude an inhibitory effect of endogenously released insulin on the insulin release process? Does constitutive insulin secretion tonically influence stimulated secretion? We attempted to address this issue by using two different inhibitors known to disrupt the kinases involved in insulin signaling. Our findings with isolated perifused rat islets confirm the observations made using mouse islets (38Jonas J.C. Plant T.D. Gilon P. Detimary P. Nenquin M. Henquin J.C. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1995; 114: 872-880Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) or neonatal cultured rat islets (39Sorenson R.L. Brelje T.C. Roth C. Endocrinology. 1994; 134: 1975-1978Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar): genistein is a potentiator of glucose-induced secretion. Furthermore, our findings also confirm previous studies in both rat (23Zawalich W.S. Zawalich K.C. Endocrinology. 2000; 141: 3287-3295Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 40Nunoi K. Yasuda K.

Nonomura Y. Miyazaki J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 214: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar); wortmannin is a potentiator of glucose-induced secretion. Although it is known that these compounds may interfere with kinases not involved with insulin signaling and that these effects may complicate the interpretation of the data, the main point to be made is that these compounds significantly potentiated glucose-induced release. Whether or not these inhibitors act as we assume or influence other pathways (43Leahy J.L. Vandekerkhove K.M. Endocrinology. 1990; 126: 1593-1598Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar) still makes these observations noteworthy and the pursuit of the precise underlying mechanisms involved an important goal for future studies. The findings also suggest that constitutive secretion may negatively affect stimulated secretion and that disruption of insulin signaling in the β-cell improves glucose-stimulated insulin secretion. Our working hypothesis is that constitutive insulin release from islets, even under nonstimulatory conditions, exerts a tonic inhibitory effect on stimulated secretion. The addition of exogenous insulin to a system already tonically inhibited has little further inhibitory effect as demonstrated here, but its disruption using several inhibitors markedly improves the secretory performance of the β-cell. This hypothesis is consistent with findings made using knockout mice where insulin signaling has been disrupted and by pharmacologic inhibition of kinases thought to be involved in insulin signaling. For example, islets deficient in the insulin receptor substrate-2 protein or the p85α regulatory subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase hyper-respond to glucose stimulation (41Eto K. Yamashita T. Tsubamoto Y. Terauchi Y. Hirose K. Kubota N. Yamahita S. Taka J. Satoh S. Sekihara H. Tobe K. Iino M. Noda M. Kimura S. Kadowaki T.

Of particular physiologic significance, perhaps, is the observation that basal secretion is not augmented from these β-cells. The impact of these genetic manipulations becomes manifest only in studies in which glucose stimulates release. This finding suggests that only under conditions in which insulin release is stimulated by glucose does insulin signaling negatively impact release. This situation is analogous to the α2 adrenergic effects in the central nervous system where presynaptically released catecholamines feed back in a negative fashion on the cell that released it in order to restrain the secretion of additional neurotransmitter (45Langer S.Z. Pharmacol. Rev. 1981; 32: 337-362Google Scholar). Our studies, as well as those of others, using pharmacologic inhibition of the kinase involved with insulin signaling are also consistent with the hypothesis that constitutive insulin signaling acts to restrain stimulated insulin secretion. For example, neither wortmannin nor genistein potentiates release from islets in the presence of low nonstimulatory glucose (23Zawalich W.S. Zawalich K.C. Endocrinology. 2000; 141: 3287-3295Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 38Jonas J.C. Plant T.D. Gilon P. Detimary P. Nenquin M. Henquin J.C. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1995; 114: 872-880Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Their positive effect on secretion only becomes manifest when stimulatory glucose is employed. Although the specificity of these inhibitors on islet kinases remains to be determined, it has to be emphasized that these inhibitors reversibly potentiate glucose-induced insulin secretion, thus ruling out any untoward nonspecific toxic action. For wortmannin at least, and from a quantitative perspective, its potentiating effect is comparable with clinically utilized insulin secretagogues. Recent interest in the potential role of insulin signaling on β-cell response patterns has been generated largely as a result of studies in insulin signaling knockout animals (46Kulkarni R.N.

(2000)Diabetes 49, (A45)Google Scholar). Amperometric measurements of 5HT release from normal or abnormal β-cells have been used to support the concept that insulin stimulates its own secretion (6Aspinwall C.A. Lakey J.R.T. Kennedy R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6360-6365Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar, 7Aspinwall C.A. Qian W.-J. Roper M.G. Kulkarni R.N. Kahn C.R. Kennedy R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 22331-22338Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Our C-peptide measurements failed to reveal any stimulatory effect of exogenous insulin on C-peptide release, a surrogate marker of insulin secretion that accurately reflects small changes in the kinetics and amplitude of insulin release. The assay used to measure C-peptide secretion appears sensitive enough to measure small increments in insulin secretion. For example, the modest 4–5-fold increase in 8 mm glucose-induced release was paralleled by a modest 4–5-fold increase in C-peptide secretion. Even with 7 mmglucose alone, small but parallel 2-fold increments in both insulin and C-peptide release were recorded. In conclusion, C-peptide release rates from perifused rat islets reflect accurately the kinetics and magnitude of glucose- and carbachol-induced insulin release. In perifused rat islets, exogenously added insulin has no inhibitory effect on endogenous insulin secretion monitored by C-peptide secretion rates. Exogenously added bovine or human insulin do not stimulate C-peptide release from islets and, by inference, also fail to exert any autocrine insulin stimulatory effect. Human insulin failed to affect C-peptide secretion from cultured islets as well. Known inhibitors of the kinases that participate in insulin signaling in other tissues significantly amplify glucose-induced secretion. Although the tonic impact of endogenously released insulin makes it technically difficult to establish an inhibitory effect of exogenously added hormone on the release process, any small autocrine stimulatory effect of added insulin, if it occurred, should have been readily detected considering the secretory capacity of the β-cell and the sensitivity of the C-peptide assay. This was, however, not the case. We thank John Cassidy for helpful comments and suggestions."

The studies all predict an intracellular N terminus, followed by six α-helical membrane-spanning domains, but they differ in their predictions of the C-terminal topology. We have proposed a model in which two membrane-spanning domains (7 and 11, see Fig. 1 below) flank a region (domains 8, 9, and 10) that is highly accessible to the extracellular environment and contains at least one re-entrant loop (domain 8) (12Seal R.P. Leighton B.H. Amara S.G. Neuron. 2000; 25: 695-706Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Intriguingly, a highly hydrophobic, potentially membrane-spanning domain (domain 10 in Fig. 1 below) was predicted to be oriented at or near the extracellular face of the membrane in all the various models. Our initial examination of the aqueous accessibility of this hydrophobic region demonstrated that cysteines substituted for several residues within domain 10 were accessible to hydrophilic, impermeant sulfhydryl reagents applied to the extracellular side of the membrane (12Seal R.P. Leighton B.H. Amara S.G. Neuron. 2000; 25: 695-706Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Structure-function studies support the notion that the binding sites for substrates, inhibitors, and co-transported ions as well as one or more translocation pores are formed from multiple domains that may or may not be adjacent to one another in the primary sequence. A recent report examining the disulfide bond formation between introduced cysteine pairs suggests that domain 9 is indeed proximal to both domain 7 and to domain 8, providing additional clues to the tertiary structure of the region (13Brocke L. Bendahan A. Grunewald M. Kanner B.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 3985-3992Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Efforts to identify sites associated with substrate translocation and inhibitor binding also have focused on the highly conserved C-terminal half of the carrier. These studies generally support the notion that residues in multiple C-terminal domains (domains 7, 8, and 11) contribute to substrate, inhibitor, and ion interactions (8Slotboom D.J. Sobczak I.

Chimeras made between EAATs 1 and 2 have implicated the region of EAAT1 from Gly442 to Arg499 (EAAT1 domains 9, 10, and 11) in determining the substrate and inhibitor selectivity of the carrier (18Mitrovic A.D.

Most recently, three groups have identified residues in domain 10 that when mutated and/or modified disrupt transport but preserve the substrate-activated anion conductance (20Seal R.P. Shigeri Y.

Chem. 2002; 277: 13501-13507Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Here we report the results of experiments examining the functional contribution of individual residues throughout domain 10, as evaluated by the substituted cysteine accessibility method (23Karlin A. Akabas M.H. Methods Enzymol. 1998; 293: 123-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (544) Google Scholar). The fourteen residues that comprise this domain, which was originally delineated as a hydrophobic, potentially helical segment (12Seal R.P. Leighton B.H. Amara S.G. Neuron. 2000; 25: 695-706Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar), were sequentially substituted with cysteine and then examined by assessing their ability to react with membrane-impermeable MTS derivatives. The relative rates of MTS reagent modification of these cysteine residues are consistent with an α-helical structure with one side being preferentially accessible to the extracellular aqueous environment. Substrates and inhibitors prevent the MTS reagent modification of domain 10 mutants and appear to do so at a step in the transport cycle that precedes major conformational changes required for substrate translocation. These data also suggest that residues within domain 10 reside within a pore or binding pocket that becomes occluded when substrates and inhibitors bind to the transporter. Individual cysteine mutants in domain 10, Ala446-Gly459, were constructed by PCR and sequenced by Dye Terminator cycle sequencing (PE Biosystems) (12Seal R.P. Leighton B.H. Amara S.G. Neuron. 2000; 25: 695-706Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). COS-7 cells were maintained as previously described (24Arriza J.L. Fairman W.A. Wadiche J. Murdoch G.H. Kavanaugh M.P. Amara S.G. J. Neurosci. 1994; 14: 5559-5569Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were passaged and plated into 24-well plates then transfected the following day by the DEAE-dextran method with 1 μg/ml pCMV-EAAT1 cysteine mutant, pCMV EAAT1 cysteineless (cysless) or with CMV-5 vector alone as a control for endogenous l-glutamate uptake. Counts obtained from vector-transfected cells were subtracted as background from all experimental conditions. All experiments were performed 2 days post transfection. MTS reagents (Toronto Research Inc.) were dissolved in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS: 138 mm NaCl, 8.1 mmNa2HPO4-7H2O, 2.7 mmKCl, 1.5 mm KH2PO4, pH 7.4) as an 11× stock and maintained on ice to prevent hydrolysis (25Javitch J.A. Methods Enzymol. 1998; 296: 331-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). After dilution to 1× at room temperature (25 °C), the MTS reagents were used immediately. COS-7 cells in 24-well plates expressing EAAT1 cysteine mutants were washed once with PBS and then incubated at room temperature with 1 mm MTS-ethyltrimethylammonium (MTSET) or 10 mm MTS-ethyl sulfonate (MTSES) (25Javitch J.A. Methods Enzymol. 1998; 296: 331-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) in PBS for 5 min. After washing the cells twice with PBS, transporter-mediated uptake was assayed with 10 μm l-glutamate (100 nm l-[3H]glutamate) (obtained from PerkinElmer Life Sciences; specific activity, 24 Ci/mmol) in PBS for 10 min at room temperature. Cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS then dissolved into 0.5 ml of 0.1% SDS and 4.5 ml of ScintiVerse (Fisher), and radiolabeled uptake was assayed by liquid scintillation counting. For measurements of transport inXenopus oocytes, l-glutamate uptake was assessed before and after MTSES modification in oocytes expressing cysless or mutant transporters (20Seal R.P. Shigeri Y. Eliasof S. Leighton B.H. Amara S.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 15324-15329Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Oocytes were washed once in ND96 (96 mm NaCl, 2 mm KCl, 1.8 mmCaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, and 5 mm Hepes, pH 7.5) and incubated with 10 mmMTSES in ND96 for 5 min, then washed three times in ND96. Uptake was performed with 100 nm l-[3H]glutamate in ND96 for 10 min at room temperature. The oocytes were transferred through four washes of ice-cold ND96 and then dissolved in 1% SDS. Uptake activity was assessed by scintillation counting as described above. Counts obtained from nude oocytes were subtracted as background from all experimental conditions. Inhibition of uptake is expressed as a percentage of inhibition (percent inhibition = 100 − (100 × uptake after/uptake before)). COS-7 cells expressing mutant or cysless transporters were washed once in a buffer containing 138 mm choline-Cl, 8.1 mmTris-H3PO4, 2.7 mm KCl, 1.5 mm KH2PO4, 0.1 mmCaCl2, and 1 mm MgCl2 (pH 7.4). MTSES and MTSET modification was performed in choline buffer for 5 min then washed once in choline buffer and once in phosphate-buffered saline, 0.1 mm calcium chloride, 1 mm magnesium chloride (PBSCM) before radiolabeled uptake was performed in PBSCM as described above. Transiently transfected COS-7 cells expressing cysteine mutant transporters were assayed for the ability to accumulate 200 μm l-glutamate (100 nm l-[3H]glutamate). Mutant transporters that accumulate glutamate at or above wild type EAAT1 levels (cysless and L455C) were assayed at 1 mm glutamate (200 nm l-[3H]glutamate). Uptake remained linear for up to 20 min, although subsequent experiments were performed for 10 min (data not shown). For Vmaxand Km calculations, cells were washed once with PBSCM and then incubated for 5 min in PBSCM or with 1 mmMTSET or 5 mm MTSES in PBSCM. Cells were washed twice with PBSCM and then incubated with 100 nm l-[3H]glutamate and unlabeledl-glutamate to a final concentration of 1, 3, 10, 50, 100, 300, 500, and 1000 μm in PBSCM for 10 min at room temperature. Cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBSCM and dissolved into 0.5 ml of 0.1% SDS. Uptake activity was assessed by scintillation counting as described above. Vmax and Km calculations are the average of two to eight experiments done in triplicate with uptake in vector-transfected cells subtracted from total uptake at each concentration. TheVmax is expressed as a percentage of cysless.Km values were derived by the Michaelis-Menten equation using KaleidaGraph (Synergy Software, Reading, PA). For one mutant (A446C), l-glutamate transport kinetic experiments were performed in oocytes. Oocytes expressing mutant transporters were washed once in ND96 and then incubated with 300 nm l-[3H]glutamate and with seven unlabeled concentrations of l-glutamate (1, 10, 30, 100, 300, 500, and 1000 μm) in ND96 for 10 min at room temperature. The oocytes were washed and processed for scintillation counting as described above. Counts obtained from nude oocytes were subtracted as background from all experimental conditions. Cell surface expression of transiently transfected transporters was assayed as previously described (26Daniels G.M. Amara S.G. Methods Enzymol. 1998; 296: 307-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). COS-7 cells expressing mutant or cysless transporters were washed once with PBSCM and then incubated with 1.5 mg/mlN-hydroxysulfosuccinimide-biotin (Pierce, Rockford, IL) in PBSCM for 40 min at 4 °C. The reaction was quenched with 100 mm glycine in PBSCM. Under these conditions, only mature surface-expressed transporters react with the biotinylation reagent. Cells were lysed on ice with 1% Triton X-100 lysis buffer, transferred to a 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tube and spun at 14,000 rpm. Ultralink Immobilized NeutrAvidin beads (Pierce, Rockford, IL) were added to the supernatants, and the components were mixed overnight at 4 °C. The beads were then washed, resuspended in SDS sample buffer, and incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. The proteins were separated on an 8.5% polyacrylamide gel, transferred to an Immobilon-P membrane (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA), then probed with a polyclonal antibody raised against 42 residues at the C-terminal end of EAAT1 (1:3000 dilution) (12Seal R.P. Leighton B.H. Amara S.G. Neuron. 2000; 25: 695-706Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 27Eliasof S. Arriza J.L. Leighton B.H. Kavanaugh M.P. Amara S.G. J Neurosci. 1998; 18: 698-712Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Proteins were visualized with a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (1:10,000, AmershamBiosciences, Arlington Heights, IL) and enhanced chemiluminescence detection (PerkinElmer Life Sciences, Boston, MA). To calculate second order reaction rate constants for MTSES and MTSET modification we utilized COS-7 cells expressing CMV vector, cysless, or individual mutant transporters. Cells were washed once with PBSCM and then incubated in PBSCM or 10 mm l-glutamate in PBSCM for 2 min at room temperature prior to adding seven concentrations of MTSES (0.5 μm to 10 mm) or MTSET (0.5 μm to 1 mm) (all in great excess over the quantity of reactive sulfhydryls) in 0.25 ml of PBSCM for 5 min at 25 °C. Reaction rate curves were generated for each mutant (data not shown). The extent of reaction was assumed to be proportional to the magnitude of transport inhibition, which followed pseudo-first order kinetics as a function of MTS reagent concentration (28Javitch J.A., Fu, D. Chen J. Karlin A. Neuron. 1995; 14: 825-831Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). The reactivity of individual mutants dictated the range of MTS reagent concentrations used to generate the reaction rate curve. For example, a MTSES concentration range between 0.5 and 3.0 μm was used to generate a curve for a highly reactive cysteine mutant (V449C), whereas the concentration of the reagent used for a slower reactive mutant (L455C) ranged between 1 and 10 mm. Cells were washed twice with PBSCM and then assayed for glutamate uptake activity, as described above. Assays were performed in the presence of 10 mm l-glutamate to observe any changes in the MTS reagent modification due to substrate transport. The reaction rate constants were determined by plotting the fraction of uptake remaining (F = uptake after/uptake before) as a function of the concentration of the reagent and then fit to a non-linear regression equation for one phase exponential decay, F =Fmax × exp(−yct) +Fmin, where t is the incubation time in seconds (5 min), c is the concentration of MTS reagent, and y is the second order reaction rate constant expressed as (m−1s−1). Reaction rate constants were determined as described above except that the modification was performed at 2–4 °C. All reagents and cells used for modification were cooled to 2–4 °C before use. After MTS reagent modification, the cells were washed twice with room temperature (25 °C) PBSCM and allowed to warm to room temperature before 10 μm l-glutamate (100 nm l-[3H]glutamate) uptake was performed. Second order reaction rate constants were calculated as described above. Cysteine mutant or CMV-transfected COS-7 cells were washed once with PBSCM and then incubated for 2 min with PBSCM alone or with 1 mm dl-TBOA in PBSCM. MTSES (V454C, 0.1 mm; L455C, 5 mm; S457C, 5 mm) or MTSET (V454C, 0.1 mm; L455C, 1 mm; S457C, 1 mm) were added for 5 min. These concentrations of MTS reagents were shown to maximally inhibit transport for each mutant. Cells were then washed twice with PBSCM and assayed for uptake activity with 10 μm l-glutamate (100 nm l-[3H]glutamate) as described above. Results are expressed as normalized l-glutamate uptake after MTSES modification. Mutant or CMV-transfected COS-7 cells were washed once with PBSCM, and then dl-TBOA was added at concentrations ranging from 64 nm to 5 mm in PBSCM. Cells were incubated for 5 min at 25 °C, then 10 μm l-glutamate (100 nm l-[3H]glutamate) in PBSCM was added for 10 min. Cells were then washed and processed as described above for scintillation counting. Results are expressed as the fractional inhibition of l-glutamate uptake and are plotted as a function of the concentration of dl-TBOA using a sigmoidal dose-response curve (variable slope) using GraphPad Prism (GraphPad Software, Inc., San Diego). The IC50 values are the mean ± S.E. of three to four independent experiments done in triplicate. Cells were washed with PBSCM and incubated with concentrations of dl-TBOA ranging from 0 to 1 mm for 5 min in PBSCM at 25 °C. Then 5 mmMTSES was added concurrently for 5 min, and cells were subsequently washed twice with PBSCM. 10 μm l-glutamate (100 nm l-[3H]glutamate) uptake was performed, and cells were processed for scintillation counting as described above. Data was analyzed to determine the fractionaldl-TBOA inhibition, FI = 1 − [(averaged data − total inhibition)/(no inhibition − total inhibition)], and fit to a sigmoidal dose-response curve (variable slope) to calculate the EC50 (GraphPad Prism). The data values were averaged and reported ± S.E. Two electrode voltage clamp recordings ofl-glutamate transport elicited currents from A446C, L448C, and cysless mutants were performed as described previously (29Arriza J.L. Eliasof S. Kavanaugh M.P. Amara S.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4155-4160Crossref PubMed Scopus (803) Google Scholar). Current-voltage curves were generated from oocytes clamped to −30 mV and stepped through a range of potentials from +80 to −120 in 150-ms steps in ND96 buffer or ND96 with 96 mm NaNO3substituted for 96 mm NaCl. In anion substitution experiments KCl/agar bridges were used to avoid voltage offsets associated with solution changes. The cysless transporter (Fig. 1) with conserved substitutions at three endogenous cysteines was used as a template for examining the functional role of fourteen residues in domain 10 (Ala446-Gly459) (12Seal R.P. Leighton B.H. Amara S.G. Neuron. 2000; 25: 695-706Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Each residue was individually mutated to cysteine, and the transport properties of the mutated carriers were evaluated. We calculated the apparent affinity (Km) and the maximum velocity (Vmax) of l-glutamate transport for each mutant using a radiolabeled uptake assay (Table I). In COS-7 cells, all but three of the cysteine mutants (A446C, G447C, and G459C) are able to accumulate 10 μm l-glutamate above background levels. Cell surface biotinylation confirmed that two of the non-functional cysteine mutants are absent from the plasma membrane (G447C and G459C), whereas one non-transporting mutant (A446C) is expressed at the surface (Fig.2). At other positions in domain 10, cysteine substitutions were generally well tolerated: theKm values for the mutant transporters resemble those observed for the cysless parent (Km 48 ± 2 μm, n = 6) and the wild type EAAT1 (Km 48 ± 10 μm) (24Arriza J.L.

Open table in a new tab Cysteine mutants were evaluated for the ability to accumulatel-glutamate before and after modification by the membrane-impermeable sulfhydryl-specific reagents MTSES and MTSET. Although MTSET is positively charged and MTSES is negatively charged, both are membrane-impermeant (12Seal R.P. Leighton B.H. Amara S.G.

The cysless EAAT1 exhibits similar transport kinetics compared with the wild type EAAT1 after exposure to MTSES and MTSET (11Seal R.P. Amara S.G. Neuron. 1998; 21: 1487-1498Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). In COS cells transfected with cysteine substitution mutants, addition of MTSES (10 mm) or MTSET (1 mm) caused a >70% decrease in l-glutamate (10 μm) uptake with all but one functional mutant (T456C) (Fig. 3). In a previous report (12Seal R.P. Leighton B.H. Amara S.G. Neuron. 2000; 25: 695-706Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) we showed that three domain 10 mutants (V452C, I453C, and V458C) could react with biotin-containing thiol-modifying reagents and with several membrane-impermeable reagents. The current data extend these findings by demonstrating that several additional cysteine substitutions throughout this region are also readily accessible to hydrophilic membrane-impermeable MTS reagents and that these modifications disrupt substrate translocation. To evaluate the impact of thiol modification on transport activity, glutamate saturation analyses were performed on domain 10 mutants after incubation with either MTSES (5 mm) or MTSET (1 mm), concentrations determined to maximally inhibit transport. Application of either MTSES or MTSET (L448C, V449C, T450C, I453C, V454C, and S457C) or only MTSET (M451C) largely abolished uptake even at high substrate concentrations (Table I). For some mutants, the introduction of a larger side chain and/or charged group had more subtle effects. With M451C and V458C mutants, MTSES modification only partially blocks transport (M451C, Vmax = 47 ± 4%; V458C, Vmax = 60 ± 8%; %Vmax before modification) and results in modest decreases in apparent transport affinities (M451C, Km = 203 ± 33 μm, n = 5; V458C, Km = 264 ± 43 μm, n = 4) (Table I).

A potential pathway for ligand binding is discussed. orotidine-5′-monophosphate decarboxylase orotidine 5′-phosphate barbituric acid ribosyl 5′-monophosphate xanthosine 5′-monophosphate Orotidine-5′-monophosphate decarboxylase (ODCase)1 catalyzes the last step in the de novo pyrimidine biosynthesis pathway, converting OMP to UMP (Scheme FSI), which in turn serves as the source of all cellular pyrimidine nucleotides. ODCase continues to elicit strong interest not only because of its obvious importance in DNA and RNA synthesis, and thus in cell growth and proliferation, but even more so because of the enormous acceleration it conveys on the catalyzed reaction as well as the elusive nature of its reaction mechanism.The decarboxylation of orotic acid in water of neutral pH is a very slow process (t 12 ∼ 78 million years at 25 °C). The enzyme ODCase, however, catalyzes the breaking of this stable carbon-carbon bond at rates that are only 2 orders of magnitude below the limits set by diffusion. This astonishing feat qualifies ODCase as the most proficient enzyme known (1Radzicka A. Wolfenden R. Science. 1995; 267: 90-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (726) Google Scholar). Such catalytic power is even more remarkable if one considers that it is achieved without the help of any metal ions or cofactors and does not involve acid/base catalysis (2Acheson S.A. Bell J.B.

Two strong inhibitors, 6-hydroxyuridine 5′-phosphate (barbituric acid ribosylmonophosphate; BMP) and 6-aza-UMP, are thought of as close mimics of the postulated carbanion intermediate thereby functioning as transition state analogues. Several weaker inhibitors include the product UMP and the purine nucleotides XMP and CMP (SchemeFSII).

A Lys42-Asp70-Lys72-Asp75Barrangement creates a chain of alternating charges, which lies on one side of the binding pocket for the aromatic base. This cavity fits tightly around the bound product or inhibitor ligands (9Wu N., Mo, Y. Gao J. Pai E.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 2017-2022Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar, 10Miller B.G. Hassell A.M. Wolfenden R. Milburn M.V. Short S.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The substrate OMP itself, however, only enters this site in crystals of the double mutant D70A/K72A. Without the removal of the two side chains, there was insufficient space for substrate molecules to bind, with Asp70 not only overlapping in space but also exerting major electrostatic repulsion. In addition, there were no large conformational changes observed by either main chain or side chains when the wild-type enzyme and several active site mutants were crystallized in complex with substrate, product, and inhibitors (16Wu N. Gillon W. Pai E.F. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 4002-4011Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). In light of this peculiar nature of the substrate-binding site, we have put forward the idea that stress created by charge-charge repulsion in a small rigid and hydrophobic environment was a major factor in rate acceleration. This stress would be expected to build up as the C6-carboxylate approaches the side chain of Asp70 leading to the release of CO2. The resulting carbanion would then be neutralized through proton transfer from the side chain of Lys72. The substantial binding energy generated by interactions of the phosphate and ribose parts of OMP with the enzyme matrix could provide a large part of the driving force for this process (9Wu N., Mo, Y. Gao J. Pai E.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 2017-2022Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar).This model, however, does not explain why the purine nucleotide XMP with its bulkier two-ring base is a much better inhibitor of ODCase (K i = 4.1 × 10−7m) than the product UMP (K i = 2.0 × 10−4m), which in its chemical structure more closely resembles the strong inhibitor 6-aza-UMP (K i = 6.4 × 10−8m) (4Miller B.G. Snider M.J. Short S.A. Wolfenden R. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 8113-8118Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Given the remarkably tight fit to the binding site found in all structurally characterized pyrimidine nucleotide complexes (9Wu N., Mo, Y. Gao J. Pai E.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 2017-2022Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar, 10Miller B.G. Hassell A.M. Wolfenden R. Milburn M.V. Short S.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 4002-4011Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), one would have to postulate a major conformational change of the protein to accommodate the larger ring of XMP. The potential for such a reconfiguration of the active site would clearly weaken the argument for the involvement of electrostatic repulsion in the catalytic mechanism of the enzyme. We, therefore, set out to determine the binding mode of several well characterized inhibitor molecules, including XMP, to ODCase from the methanogenic archaeonMethanobacterium thermoautotrophicum.In addition, we investigated the role played by the phosphate-binding loop, amino acids Gly180–Gly190, in ligand binding by analyzing the 6-aza-UMP complex of the deletion mutant ΔR203A, in which amino acids 184–187 were removed and the phosphate anchoring Arg203 was changed to alanine. The crystal structures of the complexes of wild-type ODCase with the product UMP and the most tightly binding inhibitor 6-hydroxyuridine 5′-phosphate (BMP) were also determined to allow meaningful comparisons with the other complexes studied by us but also with the results described by other groups for the enzymes from yeast (10Miller B.G.

Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 4217-4224Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar).RESULTSBoth the CMP complex and XMP complex crystals were very difficult to grow. Modifications to the dielectric constants of the media caused by the addition of small organic compounds seemed to support the formation of crystals of ODCase complexes, but a large number of additives had to be screened before crystals of diffraction quality could be obtained reproducibly. For instance, it was mandatory to add (±)-1,3-butanediol to the crystallization mixture for the XMP complex crystals to suppress their very high tendency to twin.The electron density maps for both the CMP and XMP complexes clearly show that neither of the nucleotide inhibitors has its base bound inside the cavity that accepts the aromatic rings of the substrate and product molecules. Also in both structures, the loop comprising amino acids Gly180–Gly190 was disordered. This binding mode leaves the inhibitor molecules partially exposed to solvent (Fig. 1). In substrate or product complexes, this loop clamps down on the nucleotide. Gln185, the residue located in the center of the loop, interacts with both O-2 and an oxygen of the 5′-phosphate.Figure 1Surface exposure of bound inhibitors. 6-Aza-UMP (A), XMP (B), and CMP (C) in their respective complexes with wild-type ODCase and 6-aza-UMP bound in the active site of the ΔR203A deletion mutant (D).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Purine Inhibitor XMPThe analysis of this complex was attempted to address why the purine nucleotide XMP with its significantly larger base is a much more effective competitive inhibitor of ODCases than the product UMP, especially given the narrowness of the site that was to accept the aromatic rings of these molecules.Its limited size, together with its resistance to conformational change, prevents the base-binding cavity from accepting the xanthine group of XMP (Fig. 1 B). Unlike 6-aza-UMP, UMP, BMP, and OMP, XMP adopts the lower energy structure also found in solution, with 3′-endo sugar puckering and anti-conformation of the base. Despite this change, Ser127 still serves as an anchoring residue for the nucleotide base forming two hydrogen bonds to xanthine. The side chain hydroxyl accepts a proton from N-1 and the backbone amide donates a proton to O-2. When compared with the complex of 6-aza-UMP and wild-type enzyme, the interactions between the phosphate group and Arg203 as well as those of the 3′-OH of ribose with Asp20 and Lys42 were conserved. However, the 2′-OH group was no longer in contact with its usual partners, Asp75B and Thr79B from the other monomer. Instead, it was now only 3.0 Å away from the amino group of Lys42 and forms an additional bond to the C3-OH of (+)-1,3-butanediol, a crystallization additive which, together with a water molecule W1, is bound in the active site of the XMP-ODCase complex (Fig. 2 A).Figure 2Stereo view of the active sites of ODCase-inhibitor complexes.

Its hydrophobic chain fits nicely against the hydrophobic pocket of the active site, whereas its C1-OH binds to N-3 of xanthine, in addition to its C3-OH and the ribose 2′-OH interactions mentioned above. A superposition of the active sites of the XMP and 6-aza-UMP complexes (Fig. 3 A) shows that water W1 assumes the regular binding spot of the ribose 2′-OH, forming hydrogen bonds to OG1 of Thr79B and to the carboxylate of Asp75B.Figure 3Stereo view of superpositions of active site residues of various complexes.

For comparison, the average B-factor for the very rigid active site residues is 16.2 Å2. Water W1 and the butyl alcohol molecule show significantly higher values of 34.9 and 43.6 Å2, respectively, most probably indicative of increased mobility. It is interesting to note that both hydroxyls of the additive as well as the water W1 take up positions that are occupied by first-hydration shell water molecules in the free-enzyme structure.Kinetic StudiesWe performed kinetic measurements to establish whether the presence of (±)-1,3-butanediol had any major influence on catalysis. Increasing concentrations of alcohol do lower the apparent dissociation constant K m from that measured with wild-type enzyme; V max, however, stays constant (Table II). As the dielectric constant (ε) of the medium was decreased, ODCase binds the substrate more tightly. Ionic interactions and hydrogen bonds increase in strength with decreasing ε; therefore our results corroborate the idea that a large part of the substrate binding energy was generated from the interactions of the enzyme with the phosphate and the ribose groups of the nucleotide. Lowering ε will also make it easier to protonate the C6-carboxylate of OMP, minimizing potential electrostatic repulsion. Our results align well with the general finding that decarboxylation reactions are accelerated in desolvating environments (8Feng W.Y. Austin T.J. Chew F. Gronert S. Wu W.

Open table in a new tab At a fixed concentration of 200 μm XMP, increasing amounts of (±)-1,3-butanediol (5–20%, v/v) do not significantly change the values of V max andK m (Table II) leading us to believe that the alcohol does not drastically change the binding mode of XMP. The high B-factor values of the alcohol molecules also imply that their interactions with amino acids and the xanthine ring were not very specific and not very strong. Another argument for the general relevance of the orientation of the aromatic ring of XMP observed in crystals was the fact that the base of bound CMP adopts an almost identical position in the absence of any mitigating molecules (see below).Pyrimidine Inhibitor CMPThe potential substrate 6-carboxy-CMP binds only very weakly to ODCase and its decarboxylation was almost undetectable (25Smiley J.A. Saleh L. Bioorg. Chem. 1999; 27: 297-306Crossref Scopus (22) Google Scholar); yet, there was no strong structural reason for the absence of catalysis. When comparing the interactions possible between the enzyme and orotate on the one hand and a cytosine ring on the other, only one hydrogen bond might be lost in the latter (9Wu N., Mo, Y. Gao J. Pai E.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 2017-2022Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). Most of the hydrogen bonds formed (a water molecule linking the backbone carbonyl group of Gln125 with O-4 of orotate and the hydrogen bond of the latter to the backbone amide of Ser127) could have the partners act equally well as hydrogen donors or acceptors. In complexes involving orotidine or uracil, the side chain hydroxyl of Ser127 receives a bond from N3H of the base, and at the same time, donates one to the oxygen of the amide side chain of Gln185. However, it could only act as a donor to either one of these positions in a potential CMP complex. To shed some light on the structural basis of the rejection of CMP-carboxylate as a substrate, we determined the crystal structure of the CMP bound to M. thermoautotrophicum ODCase.The crystal structure of the CMP complex reveals that the pyrimidine nucleotide not only adopts a position very similar to the one found for XMP but also engages in most of the interactions displayed by the purine nucleotide. Another feature common to both complexes was the disordered state of the loop comprising residues Gly180–Gly190, the phosphate-binding loop (Fig. 1 C).Both active sites of the functional dimer were occupied by CMP molecules as well as by waters of increased mobility (Fig.2 B). CMP assumes its solution conformation, with the ribose ring in the 3′-OH endo position and cytosine orientedanti to the sugar ring (Fig. 3 B), again mirroring XMP in its complex with ODCase. Both CMP molecules have relatively high B-factor values, 34.2 and 42.3 Å2 for the A and B monomers of the homodimer, respectively, in contrast to 19.4 and 23.3 Å2 for the conserved enzyme residues surrounding them. The binding modes of the two cytosine bases were not completely identical; the one in the A monomer assumes a position slightly closer to that of the 6-azauracil ring in the 6-aza-UMP complex than does its counterpart in the B monomer. The increased mobility of CMP was accompanied by the disordering of the guanidinium head group of Arg203 in the active site of monomer A. While the ribose 3′-OH was still fixed by hydrogen bonds to Asp20 (2.7 Å) and Lys42 (2.8 Å), the 2′-OH group was not making its proper contacts with the enzyme but formed a long hydrogen bond with the amino group of Lys42 (3.1 Å) instead.For the crystallization of the CMP-ODCase complex, 1,2,3-heptanetriol was used as an additive. As this 7-carbon alcohol is much larger than (+)-1,3-butanediol, it cannot fit between the nucleotide and the active site wall. Instead, five water molecules fill the empty cavity designed to hold the base in the productive nucleotide-binding mode. One of them sits in the position that the 2′-OH would occupy in such a complex. It is equivalent to water W1 in the XMP complex and engages in the same interactions to Asp75B and Thr79B.Impaired Phosphate Binding Mutant, ΔR203AKinetic studies have made it quite clear that the binding energy contributed by the 5′-phosphate group is very important for ODCase catalysis. Mutants with impaired phosphate binding ability have drastically reduced catalytic rates (4Miller B.G. Snider M.J. Short S.A. Wolfenden R. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 8113-8118Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). To investigate the structural basis of this property, especially to find out whether the loss of the majority of bonds between the phosphate group and the enzyme has any effects on the conformation of the residues surrounding the aromatic rings of the nucleotide bases, we mutated Arg203, the main phosphate-interacting residue, to alanine and deleted the four residues184AQGG187 of the phosphate-binding loop. Following co-crystallization, the structure of this mutant protein was determined in its complex with the inhibitor 6-aza-UMP. The reduced ligand binding affinity correlates well with a loss in crystal stability but does not lead to any structural adaptation of the active site. First, crystals of the complex form appear but over time many of them dissolve and ligand-free crystals (space group P41212) start to grow on their surfaces. The residual complex crystals start to bend. If complex crystals were harvested after nucleation of free enzyme crystals had started the resolution of their diffraction pattern dropped to about 5 Å. Both effects are consistent with the build up of stress in the crystal lattice. Given these observations, it came as no surprise to find that the refined overall B-factor value for this mutant complex is quite high (38.7 Å2 averaged over the four monomers located in the asymmetric unit) with one of the monomers displaying an overall B-factor value of 44.6 Å2. The electron density corresponding to the nucleotide ligand in the deletion mutant is distinctly weaker and of lower quality than the density found for the XMP or CMP ligands in their respective complexes. Together with the problems encountered during the crystallization of the 6-aza-UMP·ΔR203A complex, this indicates an elevated tendency for ligand loss.Although MgCl2 had been added to the crystallization solution for stabilization, no defined metal ion was observed in the resulting 1.9-Å electron density map. Superposition of active site residues in the wild-type enzyme with their counterparts in the ΔR203A mutant (Fig. 3 C) does not reveal any significant differences (root mean square deviations of 36 main chain and 9 side chain atoms = 0.12 Å). Despite its reduced affinity for inhibitors, the ΔR203A mutant binds 6-aza-UMP in exactly the same position as the wild-type enzyme (Fig. 1 D). All interactions between the nucleoside part of the inhibitor molecule and active site residues were maintained, including the hydrogen bond between N-6 and Lys72 (3.1–3.2 Å). This was obviously not the case for the phosphate group. In addition to missing the ionic interaction with Arg203, it has lost one of its first hydration shell waters that was held in place by the backbone amide of Gln185 and the backbone carbonyl of Val182 in wild-type ODCase.One distinct difference between the structures of wild-type and deletion mutant enzymes was the presence of an additional, elongated electron density peak next to the azauracil ring in the latter (Fig.2 C). Whereas the average values of the B-factors for the active site residues and 6-aza-UMP range from 25 to 36 Å2, the B-factor for the water molecule modeled into the density has a value of 60 Å2. It was not clear whether this density represents alternate but overlapping binding positions of water molecules or whether it was caused by the low occupancy presence of an as yet unidentified low molecular weight compound.BMP, 6-Aza-UMP, and UMP Inhibitor ComplexesBMP, 6-aza-UMP, and UMP all have almost identical molecular structures except for positions 6 of the respective bases. Both BMP (K i = 8.8 × 10−12m) (26Levine H.L. Brody R.S. Westheimer F.H. Biochemistry. 1980; 19: 4993-4999Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) and 6-aza-UMP (K i = 6.4 × 10−8m) (4Miller B.G. Snider M.J. Short S.A. Wolfenden R. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 8113-8118Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) are strong inhibitors. This has been attributed to their similarity to the carbanion, which was postulated as a reaction intermediate stabilized by the positive charge of Lys72 (26Levine H.L. Brody R.S. Westheimer F.H. Biochemistry. 1980; 19: 4993-4999Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). This single favorable interaction alone, however, cannot adequately explain why the product UMP is so ineffective as an inhibitor (K i = 2.0 × 10−4m). The crystal structures of the three compounds complexed with various homologous ODCases were known (9Wu N., Mo, Y. Gao J. Pai E.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 2017-2022Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar, 10Miller B.G. Hassell A.M. Wolfenden R. Milburn M.V. Short S.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

We decided to reanalyze the corresponding complexes with M. thermoautotrophicum ODCase as the crystals of this enzyme diffract to significantly higher resolution than do those from other sources. At the same time, the results of such analyses provide a common frame of reference against which the significance of small changes between the various ligand complexes can be assessed.When the structures of the different M. thermoautotrophicum complexes were compared, only minimal changes were identified. The overall root mean square deviation value for 418 Cα atoms belonging to a dimer was less than 0.5 Å; the corresponding value was 0.2 Å for 50 backbone and Cβ atoms of the following conserved active site residues: Asp20, Lys42, Asp70, Lys72, Ser127, Gln185, Arg203, Asp75B, Ile76B, and Thr79B. The similarities even extend to water molecules accompanying the inhibitors in the binding site. As described for the structures of the enzymes from E. coli (12Harris P. Navarro Poulsen J.C. Jensen K.F. Larsen S. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 4217-4224Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) and yeast (10Miller B.G. Hassell A.M. Wolfenden R. Milburn M.V. Short S.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 2011-2016Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar), the negatively charged atom O-6 of BMP interacts electrostatically with Lys72 (2.8 Å) and at the same time via hydrogen bonding with a solvating water molecule and with OD1 of Asp70.As part of the uracil ring of UMP, C-6 does not carry a negative charge and cannot act as a partner in ionic or hydrogen bond interactions. Consequently, the amino group of Lys72 was located more than 1 Å away from its positions in the 6-aza-UMP·ODCase and BMP·ODCase complexes. The rest of the conserved side chains shows no changes in position. In addition to the loss of an energetically very favorable interaction with the side chain of Lys72, the UMP complex structure reveals another reason for the inefficiency of UMP to act as an inhibitor of ODCases. In the ligand-free structure, there was one well ordered solvent molecule for each of the charged residues in the active site. Binding of UMP creates a cavity between the inhibitor molecule and the enzyme surface because of desolvation. As the exact energy involved in such a process depends on the microenvironment it was extremely difficult to estimate. However, it will undoubtedly impose appreciable entropic cost on the formation of the UMP·ODCase complex, which in turn will lead to an increase in the inhibition constant.DISCUSSIONAll of the complex structures reported here should help to improve our understanding of the highly specialized and finely tuned active site of ODCase. There was only one direct interaction (the interaction with Lys72) between the active site of the enzyme and UMP that generates binding energy and was lost when compared with the strong inhibitors BMP and 6-aza-UMP. The xanthine ring of XMP does not interact with Lys72 either; nevertheless, this nucleotide is a rather good inhibitor of ODCase. We identified two entropic facto"

Further, overexpression of TACC4 fusion proteins that retained spindle localization in mitotic cells resulted in an increased proportion of cells present in prometaphase.

Intracellular compartmentalization allows an initial, general second messenger to achieve greater signal specificity. By localizing type II cAMP-dependent protein kinase (protein kinase A) to a particular organelle or cytoskeletal element, protein kinase A-anchoring proteins (AKAPs)1effectively pre-position the inactive enzyme at or near its eventual substrate (1Lester L.B. Scott J.D. Recent Prog. Horm. Res. 1997; 52: 409-430PubMed Google Scholar). Because there are a number of cAMP-dependent signaling pathways operating simultaneously in the cell, AKAPs facilitate the stimulation of a single unique target at the appropriate time and place (2Edwards A.S. Scott J.D. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 217-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Most AKAPs have an amphipathic α-helical region that binds the regulatory subunits of the protein kinase A heterotetramer (3Carr D.W. Stofko-Hahn R.E. Fraser I.D. Bishop S.M. Acott T.S. Brennan R.G. Scott J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 14188-14192Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Other domains in AKAPs provide targeting motifs to enable binding of an individual AKAP to its particular intracellular compartment (4Colledge M. Scott J.D. Trends Cell Biol. 1999; 9: 216-221Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (543) Google Scholar) and sequence motifs for the scaffolding of other regulatory proteins. Indeed, many AKAPs also scaffold multiple enzymes that are typically protein kinases, phosphatases, or other second messenger-dependent mediators (5Faux M.C. Scott J.D. Cell. 1996; 85: 9-12Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). This complex pattern of protein assembly suggests that protein kinase A-anchoring proteins have the ability to coordinate multiple intracellular signaling events. Several groups have shown evidence for the functional presence of AKAP scaffolded intracellular signaling complexes. AKAP75, isolated from bovine brain, and its human homologue, AKAP79, localize protein kinase A, protein kinase C, and protein phosphatase 2b to post-synaptic densities (6Coghlan V.M. Perrino B.A. Howard M. Langeberg L.K. Hicks J.B. Gallatin W.M. Scott J.D. Science. 1995; 267: 108-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar, 7Nadal-Ginard B. Smith C.W. Patton J.G. Breitbart R.E. Adv. Enzyme Regul. 1991; 31: 261-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The specific role for each of these enzymes in this environment remains to be identified, but AKAP79 could functionally organize these multiple effectors in a strategic location for transmission and modulation of post-synaptic signals. Similarly, AKAP250, also known as gravin, localizes both protein kinase A and protein kinase C to the membrane cytoskeleton and filopodia found in human erythroleukemia cells (8Nauert J.B. Klauck T.M. Langeberg L.K. Scott J.D. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 52-62Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). Its submembrane locale places it adjacent to transmembrane receptors, which are likely regulated in part by protein kinase A and protein kinase C. Investigations of the Yotiao scaffolding protein have revealed its essential role in tethering both protein kinase A and the type 1 protein phosphatase to synaptic NMDA receptors (9Westphal R.S. Tavalin S.J. Lin J.W. Alto N.M. Fraser I.D. Langeberg L.K. Sheng M. Scott J.D. Science. 1999; 285: 93-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar). Protein phosphatase 1 suppresses and protein kinase A activates NMDA receptor up-regulation, thus defining the role of Yotiao as a signaling system scaffold. Most recently, muscle-selective AKAP has been implicated in bidirectional control of cardiomyocyte protein kinase A activity by anchorage of both protein kinase A and cAMP-specific phosphodiesterase, PDE4D3 (10Dodge K.L. Khouangsathiene S. Kapiloff M.S. Mouton R. Hill E.V. Houslay M.D. Langeberg L.K. Scott J.D. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1921-1930Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar). In recent years, our group and others have identified an protein kinase A-anchoring protein, AKAP350, which localizes to the centrosome and the Golgi apparatus (11Schmidt P.H. Dransfield D.T.

AKAP350 is the product of a multiply spliced gene from human chromosome 7q21 that generates numerous isoforms of a large protein scaffold with both centrosomal and non-centrosomal variants. Subsequent to our publication of AKAP350, Ono et al. (16Takahashi M. Mukai H. Oishi K. Isagawa T. Ono Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 34592-34596Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) and Orstavik et al. (12Witczak O. Skalhegg B.S. Keryer G. Bornens M. Tasken K. Jahnsen T. Orstavik S. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1858-1868Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar) identified the same open reading frame cDNA as CG-NAP and AKAP450, respectively. In addition to binding type II protein kinase A regulatory subunits, initial studies of AKAP350/AKAP450/CG-NAP show that it interacts with the serine/threonine kinase protein kinase N, protein phosphatase 1, and protein phosphatase 2a (13Takahashi M.

Further studies have demonstrated that CG-NAP associates with protein kinase Cε in a phosphorylation-dependent manner (16Takahashi M. Mukai H. Oishi K. Isagawa T. Ono Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 34592-34596Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) and that AKAP450 associates with phosphodiesterase 4D3 (17Tasken K.A. Collas P. Kemmner W.A. Witczak O. Conti M. Tasken K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 21999-22002Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Two carboxyl-terminal splice variants from human gastric mucosa (AKAP350A) and human lung (AKAP350B) have been identified (11Schmidt P.H. Dransfield D.T. Claudio J.O. Hawley R.G. Trotter K.W. Milgram S.L. Goldenring J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3055-3066Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). AKAP450 and CG-NAP contain carboxyl termini identical to AKAP350A. AKAP350C is a separate read-through termination that truncates the last 12 exons of AKAP350A and results in a different carboxyl-terminal amino acid sequence (GenBank accession no. AF247727). The NMDA receptor-associated AKAP, Yotiao, is the shortest 3′ splice variant derived from this locus (11Schmidt P.H. Dransfield D.T. Claudio J.O. Hawley R.G. Trotter K.W. Milgram S.L. Goldenring J.R.

All together, two 5′ initiation sites, two internal splice sites, and four 3′ splice variant products of AKAP350/AKAP450/CG-NAP have been reported. For the sake of simplicity, we will refer to this protein family throughout as AKAP350. Scaffolding proteins could provide a means to organize multiple activities at discrete sites on the centrosome. A recent study of pericentrin, a known integral matrix centrosomal protein (19Dictenberg J.B. Zimmerman W. Sparks C.A. Young A. Vidair C. Zheng Y. Carrington W. Fay F.S. Doxsey S.J. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 163-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar), showed that it functions as an protein kinase A-anchoring protein, which binds cAMP-dependent protein kinase A regulatory subunits through a novel motif (20Diviani D. Langeberg L.K. Doxsey S.J. Scott J.D. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 417-420Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). The functional significance of the protein kinase A scaffolding at the pericentrin centrosome is unknown, but it appears to be important in spindle formation. Spindle defects have been observed when protein kinase A anchoring of pericentrin is disrupted (21Diviani D. Scott J.D. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 1431-1437Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Pericentrin interacts with the motor protein dynein (22Purohit A. Tynan S.H. Vallee R. Doxsey S.J. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 481-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar) and is a substrate for protein kinase A (23Inaba K. Morisawa S. Morisawa M. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 1105-1115PubMed Google Scholar). Overexpression of pericentrin results in dynein depletion and a number of spindle defects (22Purohit A. Tynan S.H. Vallee R. Doxsey S.J. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 481-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). The apparent scaffolding function of pericentrin may play an important role in the complex function of nucleating microtubule polymers for spindle formation in the centrosome. In this report, we have utilized a carboxyl-terminal fragment of AKAP350A as bait in a yeast two-hybrid screen of a rabbit parietal cell library. Isolation and subsequent cloning have identified a novel AKAP350-interacting protein that is a member of the transforming acidic coiled-coil-containing (TACC) protein family, TACC4. TACC4 is the first identified AKAP350-interacting protein that is not a signal transduction enzyme. Immunolocalization with polyclonal anti-TACC4 antibodies colocalizes TACC4 with AKAP350 at the centrosome in interphase Jurkat cells. Once cells begin mitosis, TACC4 translocates to the spindle apparatus accumulating at the spindle poles, whereas AKAP350 remains at the centrosome. Yeast two-hybrid binary assays and truncated GFP-TACC4 expression studies identify amino acids 247–404 of TACC4 as the region responsible for AKAP350 interaction and corresponding centrosome localization. Further, a separate amino-terminal TACC4 region from amino acid 1 to 380 is responsible for spindle localization. These results indicate that TACC4 is sequestered to the centrosome during interphase by AKAP350 interaction. This interaction is lost in mitosis, and TACC4 translocates to the spindle apparatus, where it may have a functional role in spindle dynamics. pEGFP-C2 vector, Advantage Taq, and Marathon cloning kits were purchased from CLONTECH. All DNA sequencing was performed using dye terminator chemistry automated sequencing in the Molecular Biology Core Facility at the Medical College of Georgia.

The 5′ end of the isolated clone was highly GC-rich, and resolution of the remaining 5′ sequence required use of both high temperature cDNA production with rTth polymerase and optimized nested amplification from rabbit spleen cDNA using the Fail-Safe amplification buffer system (Epicentre). Rabbit spleen total RNA was prepared as previously described (25Goldenring J.R. Shen K.R. Vaughan H.D. Modlin I.M. J. Biol.

The resulting cDNA was then modified by addition of linkers to prepare a linkered cDNA (Marathon, CLONTECH). Amplification from a rabbit spleen cDNA required Fail-Safe Buffer E (Epicentre) in two rounds of nested amplification. The first round was performed with Adapter Primer 1 (CLONTECH) and CTCCAGGATACACAGGGGTT (5 cycles of 94 °C for 10 s, 72 °C for 3 min; 5 cycles of 94 °C for 10 s, 70 °C for 3min; and 30 cycles of 94 °C for 10 s, 68 °C for 3 min). This was followed by reamplification with Adapter Primer 2 and CCCGAACTGCTCCAGGTAATCGATCTC (35 cycles of 94 °C for 10 s, 60 °C for 10 s, 68 °C for 2 min). The resulting products ranging in size from 500 to 1000 nucleotides were gel-isolated and cloned into pTOPO-T (Invitrogen). Isolated plasmid minipreps were sequenced as above. Northern blots containing 20 μg of total RNA from rabbit tissues were hybridized with a random-primed TACC4 cDNA probe (nucleotides 372–765). The probe had been amplified from plasmid using polymerase chain reaction with AdvantageTaq polymerase (CLONTECH) (T400 sense, GGCCGAGACCCCAGGACCAGGAGAC; T400 antisense, GGGGGCCCGACGCGCTCACAGG; 35 cycles of 95 °C for 30 s, 60 °C for 30 s, and 68 °C for 60 s). Blots were washed to high stringency (0.1× SSC, 65 °C) and exposed to x-ray film (Eastman Kodak Co.). Carboxyl-terminal cDNAs for AKAP350B and AKAP350C of similar size to pBD-AKAP350A were cloned into pBD-Gal4. Truncations of AKAP350 including regions common to AKAP350A and AKAP350B were subcloned into pBD-Gal4. Full-length TACC4 cDNA was subcloned into pAD-Gal4. Truncated TACC4 cDNAs were amplified from full-length TACC4 cDNA and subcloned into pAD-Gal4. Assays were performed by dual transfection of the Y190 yeast strain with a binding domain pBD-Gal4 construct and an activation domain pAD-Gal4 construct followed by detection of β-galactosidase production as described previously (26Lapierre L.A. Kumar R. Hales C.M. Navarre J. Bhartur S.G. Burnette J.O. Provance D.W., Jr. Mercer J.A. Bahler M. Goldenring J.R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 1843-1857Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). Positive interactions were defined by identification of blue colonies within 2 h of administration of 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactopyranoside (X-gal). Yeast two-hybrid binary assays that had negative β-galactosidase production were checked for expression of pAD and pBD by Western blot analysis. Cotransformed yeast colonies were inoculated into 50 ml of SD/−Trp/−Leu and grown overnight at 30 °C. 10 ml of the overnight culture were inoculated into 50 ml of YPD and grown to an A600 = 0.5. Cultures were pelleted at 3000 × g for 10 min, resuspended in 50 ml of sterile water, and pelleted again. The pellets were quickly frozen in liquid nitrogen and kept at −70 °C. Pellets were thawed and put in lysis buffer (50 mm EDTA, 1m NaCl, 1 mm EGTA, 0.1% Triton X-100, 1 μl/ml protease inhibitor mixture). Glass beads were added to the lysis solution, and the yeast were vigorously vortexed for 10 min. Lysis solution was pulled off the top of the beads and spun down at 4 °C for 10 min at 20,000 × g. Supernatant was discarded. Pellets were dissolved in 1× SDS, 10% β-mercaptoethanol, boiled for 15 min, and run out on a 10% SDS-PAGE gel. Gels were transferred to Immobilon for subsequent Western blotting by anti-pAD-Gal4 and anti-pBD-Gal4. Blots were blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk in 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl for 1 h at 25 °C. Blots were then probed in 0.5% nonfat dry milk in 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl for 2 h at 25 °C with a monoclonal antibody against pAD-Gal4 (0.1 μg/ml) or pBD-Gal4 (0.1 μg/ml). After the primary incubation, the blots were washed three times for 15 min each with 25 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl and then incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (1:2500) for 1 h at 25 °C. The blots were washed three times for 5 min each with 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl followed by a 1-min incubation with chemiluminescence substrate (Pierce, Supersignal) and autoradiography. Jurkat cell lysate was prepared by lysis of 50 × 106 cells with 1× SDS, 10% β-mercaptoethanol or 1× SDS, 3 m urea, and 10% β-mercaptoethanol. 75 μg of Jurkat cell lysate was resolved on 10% SDS-PAGE gels and transferred to Immobilon for subsequent Western blotting by anti-TACC4 (NE27). Blots were blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk in 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl for 1 h at 4 °C. Blots were then probed in 2.5% nonfat dry milk in 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl for 2 h at 25 °C with a monoclonal antibody against AKAP350 (14G2; 1:500) or with a polyclonal antibody against TACC4 (NE27; 1:3000). TACC4 peptide competition assays were performed by adding 2.5 μm peptide (NH2-DEQGTRESPSTPTPRC-COOH) to the primary antibody incubation. After the primary incubation, the blots were washed three times for 15 min each with 25 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl and then incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (1:2500) or anti-rabbit IgG (1:25,000) for 1 h at 25 °C. The blots were washed three times for 5 min each with 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl followed by 1 min of incubation with chemiluminescence substrate (Supersignal, Pierce) and autoradiography. Jurkat cells were pelleted onto glass slides using a Cyto-Spin (Clay-Adams). Cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min at 25 °C. Fixed cells were washed in PBS, then blocked and permeabilized with 1% milk, 0.3% Triton X-100 in PBS. Immunostaining was subsequently performed with various combinations of anti-TACC4 (1:250), anti-AKAP350 14G2 (1:80), anti-γ-tubulin (1:500), and anti-α-tubulin (1:50) for 2 h at 25 °C. The cells were then incubated with Cy3-conjugated anti-mouse IgG and Alexa 488-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG for 60 min. Following three 5-min washes in PBS, the cells were incubated in DAPI (1 mm) for 5 min and given a final 5-min wash in 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.4. Slides were mounted with Prolong Antifade (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). Cells were examined in the Imaging Core facility of the Institute of Molecular Medicine and Genetics Institute at the Medical College of Georgia on a Zeiss Axiophot microscope equipped with a SPOT digitizing camera or anAmersham Biosciences confocal microscope as described previously (27Wang X. Kumar R. Navarre J. Casanova J.E. Goldenring J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29138-29146Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Anti-TACC4 (NE27) specificity was confirmed by competitive inhibition of immunostaining with 500 μm TACC4 epitope peptide. The 3′ splice variant sequences, AKAP350A (originally reported as HGAKAP350) and AKAP350B (originally reported as HLAKAP350), were cloned previously (11Schmidt P.H. Dransfield D.T. Claudio J.O.

Using the Marathon RACE system, a linkered human lung cDNA (CLONTECH) was utilized to perform 3′-RACE using a sense primer ATCAATACAATCTCATCTCTAAAG corresponding to a start at nucleotide 8197 of AKAP350. The resulting RACE products were cloned into pBluescript-T, as previously described (25Goldenring J.R. Shen K.R. Vaughan H.D. Modlin I.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 18419-18422Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and selected clones were sequenced. We identified several sequences corresponding to the 3′ regions of both AKAP350A and AKAP350B. In addition, we identified a novel sequence for a third splice variant, AKAP350C, which is accounted for by a read-through termination of the final 12 exons present in AKAP350A with a short region of unique 3′ coding sequence (GenBank accession no.AF247727). TACC4 cDNA was cloned into the pGEX5–1 vector (Amersham Biosciences) and transformed into JM109, resulting in a vector coding for GST fused to the amino terminus of full-length TACC4. A 1-liter culture of pGEX-TACC4 or empty pGEX5–1 vector was induced with 1 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside in log phase and allowed to grow for 4 h at 37 °C. Bacteria were collected with a 5000 × g spin for 15 min, and the pellet was resuspended in 25 ml of lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl pH 8, 10 mm EDTA, 100 mm NaCl, 0.1 mg/ml lysozyme, 5 mm benzamidine, and 0.1 mm AEBSF). The lysate was sonicated on ice with four 10-s bursts. Triton X-100 was then added to a final concentration of 1%, and the mixture was nutated at 4 °C for 30 min. The lysate was then centrifuged at 20,000 × g, and the supernatant was filtered through a 0.45-μm filter. This filtrate was then added to 2 ml of glutathione-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences) prepared by washing two times in 10 volumes of PBS, one time in PBS plus 1% Triton X-100, and three times in lysis buffer without Triton X-100. The beads and supernatant mixture were mixed on a Nutator (Clay-Adams) at 25 °C for 30 min. Nonadherent protein was removed with a 5-min 500 × gcentrifugation, and the beads were washed three times with 10 bead volumes of PBS followed by one wash in PBS with 250 mmNaCl. Beads were then transferred to a 1.5-ml centrifuge tube, and protein was eluted with 1 bead volume of elution buffer (10 mm reduced glutathione, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8) for 10 min at 25 °C. One hundred μl of GST-TACC4-(1–454)-bound glutathione beads (prepared as above without the elution step), GST-bound glutathione beads, or unbound glutathione beads were blocked in PBS, 2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin at 4 °C for 2 h. 1 ml of rabbit stomach mucosa 100,000 × gsupernatant was then added to each aliquot of beads, and the mixtures were incubated on a Nutator at 4 °C for 4 h. Nonadherent proteins were collected by centrifugation at 100 × g, placed in 1% SDS stop solution, and heated at 95 °C for 5 min with final addition of 0.1 final volume of β-mercaptoethanol. Beads were washed three times with 1 ml of PBS and then incubated in 1.5% SDS stop solution at 95 °C for 15 min. The beads were pelleted at 500 × g for 5 min, and 0.1 volume of 2-mercaptoethanol was added to the supernatants. Samples were resolved by SDS-PAGE (3–10% gradient gels) and transferred for 2 h at 750 mA to nitrocellulose (Sarsedt) for subsequent Western blotting with anti-AKAP350 (14G2 1:500). TACC4 cDNA was cloned into pEGFP-C2 (CLONTECH) resulting in a vector coding for GFP fused to the amino terminus of full-length TACC4. The AKAP350 binding domain of TACC4 (amino acids 247–404) was amplified by PCR (sense primer, GGGCCCATCGTGGACG; antisense primer, CTTGCTGCGGACCTGGGCGAT) and cloned into pEGFP-C2. The TACC4 binding domain of AKAP350 (amino acids 3376–3531) was amplified by PCR (sense primer, CGGATGGGGGGGCAG; antisense primer, TTATCTTCTCATGCCAGCATG) and cloned into pEGFP-C2. Jurkat cells were transfected with the GFP chimeras by electroporation. 4 × 105 cells were incubated with 20 μg of GFP chimera plasmid DNA. A 500-μl sample in a 0.4-cm electrode gap cuvette was pulsed at 900 microfarads and 270 mV. Cells were returned to fresh media. After 30 h in suspension culture, cells were pelleted onto glass slides using a Cyto-Spin (Clay-Adams). Cells were fixed, blocked, permeabilized, and stained as above with various combinations of anti-TACC4 NE27 (1:250), anti-AKAP350 14G2 (1:80), anti-γ-tubulin (1:500), and anti-α-tubulin (1:50). The cell cycle stage of ∼100 cells for three separate transfections of GFP-TACC4, GFP-TACC4-(1–380), GFP-TACC4-(247–404), and GFP was quantitated. The number of prometaphase and interphase cells among transfected cells was compared by analysis of variance with post hoccomparison of significant means by Tukey's test. Utilizing the last 2.7 kb of human AKAP350A coding sequence as bait, yeast two-hybrid screening of a rabbit parietal cell library yielded a single partial clone of 1259 base pairs including a 3′ poly(A) tail and an incomplete 5′ end. A BLAST search of public data bases with this novel sequence revealed significant identity with members of the TACC protein family including murine TACC3, human TACC3, human TACC2, and human TACC1. As a result, we termed the AKAP350-interacting clone TACC4. Completion of cloning of the 5′ end of TACC4 identified a 1532-nucleotide cDNA sequence containing an upstream in-frame termination codon along with a polyadenylation signal downstream of the termination codon (Fig.1; GenBank accession no. AF372837). The 1364-nucleotide open reading frame coded for a 454-amino acid protein with a predicted 49.2-kDa molecular mass and an acidic isoelectric point of 4.6. Structural predictions indicated proline rich regions in the first 255 amino acids and a coiled-coil motif encompassing the carboxyl-terminal"
https://openalex.org/W2052343954,"Properties of recombinant wild type (WT) and six-histidine tag-fused (His6) putidaredoxin reductase (Pdr), a FAD-containing component of the soluble cytochrome P450cam monooxygenase system from Pseudomonas putida, have been studied. Both WT and His6 Pdr were found to undergo a monomer-dimer association-dissociation and were partially present as an NAD+-bound form. Although molecular, spectral, and electron transferring properties of recombinant His6 Pdr to artificial and native electron acceptors were similar to those of the WT protein, the presence of eight additional C-terminal amino acid residues, Pro-Arg-His-His-His-His-His-His, had a crucial effect on the enzyme interaction with oxidized pyridine nucleotide. Under anaerobic conditions, NAD+ induced in His6 Pdr spectral changes indicative of flavin reduction and formation of the charge transfer complex between the reduced FAD and NAD+. The reaction proceeded considerably faster in the presence of free histidine and thiol-reducing agents, such as dithiothreitol and reduced glutathione. In the presence of any of these three reagents, NAD+ was capable of inducing reduction of the flavin in WT Pdr. Free thiol groups were identified as an internal source of electrons in the enzyme. The results showed that WT and His6 Pdr were able to function as NAD(H)-dependent dithiol/disulfide oxidoreductases catalyzing both forward and reverse reactions, NAD+-dependent oxidation of thiols, and NADH-dependent reduction of disulfides. This function of the flavoprotein can be dissociated from electron transfer to putidaredoxin. Similarity of Pdr to the enzymes of the glutathione reductase family is discussed.

Similarity of Pdr to the enzymes of the glutathione reductase family is discussed. putidaredoxin reductase recombinant Pdr with the C-terminal six-histidine tag putidaredoxin blue neutral FAD semiquinone 5-deazariboflavin matrix-assisted laser desorption-ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry 5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) 2-nitro-5-thiobenzoate dithiothreitol 2,6-dichlorophenolindophenol para-chloromercuribenzoic acid N-ethylmaleimide NAD glycohydrolase wild type glutathione reductase A FAD-containing putidaredoxin reductase (Pdr)1 catalyzes the transfer of electrons from NADH to an iron-sulfur protein, putidaredoxin (Pdx), in the cytochrome P450cam monooxygenase system from Pseudomonas putida (1Katagiri M. Ganguli B.N. Gunsalus I.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1968; 243: 3543-3546Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Two-electron reduction of FAD with NADH is followed by the transfer of two single electrons from the flavin to Pdx. From Pdx, electrons are finally transferred to the terminal oxygenase cytochrome P450cam (CYP101) that catalyzes hydroxylation of camphor consuming two electrons and molecular oxygen per reaction cycle.Pdr has a molecular mass of 45.6 kDa and contains one tightly bound FAD per single polypeptide. Redox measurements, where sodium dithionite was used as a reductant, demonstrated that the midpoint potential of Pdr is −285 mV (2Gunsalus I.C. Wagner G.C. Methods Enzymol. 1978; 52: 166-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). The reduction of Pdr by NADH is a stoichiometric process that results in the formation of a long-wavelength charge transfer complex without the appearance of a semiquinone intermediate (3Roome P.W., Jr. Philley J.C. Peterson J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 2593-2598Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The reduction of Pdr with NADPH is approximately 3 orders of magnitude slower than with NADH (4Roome P.W. Peterson J.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1988; 266: 32-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). No charge transfer band could be detected when the flavoprotein was reduced with either NADPH or sodium dithionite. Using NADPH as a reductant, the midpoint potential of Pdr was calculated to be −315 mV (4Roome P.W. Peterson J.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1988; 266: 32-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Titration of Pdr with NADPH in the presence of excess NAD+ resulted in a stoichiometric reduction. This was explained as a result of the very tight association of NAD+with the reduced FAD and formation of the charge transfer complex that was able to shift the equilibrium of the reduction reaction toward product.In P450cam monooxygenase, the reactions of NADH oxidation and Pdx reduction catalyzed by Pdr are tightly coupled. Investigation of the role of NAD+/NADH in the catalytic reduction of Pdx has demonstrated that the pyridine nucleotide complex of Pdr is important in the enhancement of the reduction of Pdx (5Roome P.W. Peterson J.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1988; 266: 41-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). NAD+ was shown to be essential for the kinetically favored oxidation of Pdr from the two-electron reduced form to the semiquinone by oxidized Pdx. When Pdr was photoreduced in the presence of NAD+, it transferred the first electron to Pdx at a rate that could account for catalytic turnover. In contrast, the rate of Pdx reduction by Pdr that was photoreduced in the absence of NAD+ was 3 orders of magnitude lower.Due to instability, a semiquinone form of Pdr could not be detected and characterized by conventional spectrophotometric techniques. We have recently utilized laser flash photolysis techniques to produce and investigate the electron transferring properties of one-electron reduced species of the flavoprotein (6Sevrioukova I.F. Hazzard J.T. Tollin G. Poulos T.L. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 10592-10600Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Upon flash-induced reduction by 5-deazariboflavin semiquinone, Pdr was found to form a blue neutral FAD semiquinone (FADH⋅). FADH⋅ was unstable and partially disproportionated into fully oxidized and fully reduced flavin. The rate of FAD semiquinone disproportionation was enhanced by NAD+. It was established that FADH⋅ was capable of transferring an electron to Pdx with the rate constant that can account for catalytic turnover (6Sevrioukova I.F. Hazzard J.T. Tollin G. Poulos T.L. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 10592-10600Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar).Quite unexpectedly, our laser flash photolysis experiments revealed that under anaerobic conditions and in the presence of NAD+, the flavin in the recombinant Pdr molecule, expressed with the C-terminal six-histidine tag (His6 Pdr), became reduced without any external source of electrons. This indicates that, in addition to FAD, there must be another redox center(s) in Pdr. The fact that Pdr belongs to a class of bacterial oxygenase-coupled NADH-dependent ferredoxin reductases that have a structural fold similar to that of the enzymes of the glutathione reductase (GR) family (7Senda T.

Biol. 2000; 304: 397-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) suggests that the second redox center in Pdr is likely to involve sulfhydryl groups. Although Pdr has six cysteine residues, it does not have putative disulfide redox centers encoded by CXXC or CXXXXC motifs, characteristic features of pyridine nucleotide-disulfide oxidoreductases. Despite the low amino acid sequence similarity between oxygenase-coupled NADH-dependent ferredoxin reductases and GR-family enzymes, these proteins are thought to have evolved from a common ancestor but, in the course of evolution, have lost (or GR family enzymes have acquired) the cysteine residues essential for the catalysis (7Senda T. Yamada T. Sakurai N. Kubota M. Nashizaki T. Masai T. Fukuda M. Mitsui Y. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 304: 397-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). In the present work, we demonstrate that Pdr is a bifunctional enzyme that, in addition to catalyzing electron transfer to Pdx, can function as NAD(H):dithiol/disulfide oxidoreductase. Lacking traditional disulfide redox centers, Pdr seems to be unique in this class of enzymes. A FAD-containing putidaredoxin reductase (Pdr)1 catalyzes the transfer of electrons from NADH to an iron-sulfur protein, putidaredoxin (Pdx), in the cytochrome P450cam monooxygenase system from Pseudomonas putida (1Katagiri M.

In the present work, we demonstrate that Pdr is a bifunctional enzyme that, in addition to catalyzing electron transfer to Pdx, can function as NAD(H):dithiol/disulfide oxidoreductase. Lacking traditional disulfide redox centers, Pdr seems to be unique in this class of enzymes. We thank G. Tollin and J. T. Hazzard for assistance in carrying out laser flash photolysis experiments and Q. Vu for performing mass spectroscopy analysis of Pdr."

Dimerization is directed by a 31-amino acid domain at the amino terminus of the protein that forms a unique antiparallel four-helix bundle when dimerized (16Rose R.B. Bayle J.H. Endrizzi J.A. Cronk J.D. Crabtree G.R. Alber T. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 744-748Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The dimerization domain appears to be essential for HNF1 function because deletion of the dimerization domain reduces HNF1 DNA binding, and MODY3 mutations that result in amino acid substitution in this domain disrupt DCoH binding and reduce DNA binding (16Rose R.B.

DCoH stabilizes the dimeric, DNA-binding form of HNF1 and augments HNF1-dependent transcription (1Mendel D.B. Khavari P.A. Conley P.B. Graves M.K. Hansen L.P. Admon A. Crabtree G.R. Science. 1991; 254: 1762-1767Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Crystallographic structural studies have demonstrated that the α-helical HNF1 dimerization domain binds to an α-helical cap on the DCoH dimer that overlies a molecular saddle composed of antiparallel β-sheets (16Rose R.B.

The DCoH saddle is similar in structure to the DNA binding saddle of the TATA-binding protein (20Kim J.L. Burley S.K. Structure. 1995; 3: 531-534Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar) and the RNA binding domain of the SRP9/14 domain of the signal recognition particle (21Birse D.E. Kapp U. Strub K. Cusack S. Aberg A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3757-3766Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). These features have led to the hypothesis that DCoH may influence transcription by HNF1 by mechanisms other than its stabilization of HNF1 dimerization; however, no binding of DCoH to DNA or RNA has yet been demonstrated (22Rhee K.H. Stier G. Becker P.B. Suck D. Sandaltzopoulos R. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 265: 20-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar).DCoH is a bifunctional molecule that was purified independently as a pterin 4α-carbinolamine dehydratase (PCD) (23Citron B.A. Davis M.D. Milstien S.

This activity of cytoplasmic DCoH homotetramers catalyzes a step in the recycling of tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4), a cofactor for amino acid hydroxylases important for the catabolism of phenylalanine as well as the synthesis of catecholamines, serotonin, and nitric oxide (25Kaufman S. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 1993; 13: 261-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). DCoH specifically dehydrates the 4α-OH-BH4 product of hydroxylases to the quinonoid form of BH4 before it can spontaneously rearrange to the 7R isomer, which acts as an inhibitor for PAH (26Davis M.D. Kaufman S. FEBS Lett. 1991; 285: 17-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 27Thony B. Neuheiser F. Kierat L. Blaskovics M. Arn P.H. Ferreira P. Rebrin I. Ayling J. Blau N. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1998; 62: 1302-1311Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). As such, DCoH can enhance the activity of PAH and has been called the PAH-stimulating protein (PHS). Rare cases of hyperphenylalaninemia in humans are caused by DCoH mutations (27Thony B. Neuheiser F. Kierat L. Blaskovics M. Arn P.H. Ferreira P. Rebrin I. Ayling J. Blau N. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1998; 62: 1302-1311Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar,28Citron B.A. Kaufman S. Milstien S. Naylor E.W. Greene C.L. Davis M.D. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1993; 53: 768-774PubMed Google Scholar), and the progressive pigmentation disorder vitiligo has been correlated with loss of DCoH enzymatic activity apparently without mutation or hyperphenylalaninemia (29Schallreuter K.U.

Citron B.A. Kaufman S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 12384-12388Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar).To define further the roles of DCoH, we have created mice in which the DCoH gene is deleted. Although DCoH null mice are viable and fertile, they have hyperphenylalaninemia and a predisposition to cataract formation. Surprisingly, HNF1 function is only partially impaired in DCoH null mice. Although cytoplasmic DCoH expression is undetectable in liver and kidney extracts, a complementing activity that interacts with HNF1 is observed in DCoH null nuclear extracts. This activity is likely to be the result of the low level nuclear expression of a second DCoH-related gene, DCoH2.DISCUSSIONThe DCoH protein is remarkable in that it performs separate cytoplasmic and nuclear functions that affect metabolism and gene expression. Loss of DCoH expression results in a substantial loss in the cytoplasmic, enzymatic activity of DCoH, but an incomplete loss in the nuclear function of DCoH. The nuclear activity of DCoH is likely to be complemented by a close gene family member, DCoH2, reported here. Although apparently dispensable for normal embryonic and postnatal development, DCoH functions in several physiological roles, and its loss in mice results in an increased frequency of cataract formation, hyperphenylalaninemia, and impaired glucose tolerance.The loss of DCoH enzymatic activity uncouples BH4 recycling from PAH activity and results in hyperphenylalaninemia. The observed degree of hyperphenylalaninemia resembles that of weak mutant alleles of murine GTP cyclohydrolase and PAH and in human subjects with homozygous mutations inactivating DCoH enzymatic activity (27Thony B. Neuheiser F. Kierat L. Blaskovics M. Arn P.H. Ferreira P. Rebrin I. Ayling J. Blau N. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1998; 62: 1302-1311Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 28Citron B.A. Kaufman S. Milstien S. Naylor E.W. Greene C.L. Davis M.D. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1993; 53: 768-774PubMed Google Scholar) whereas strong mutants in PAH resemble classic phenylketonuria including ataxia, poor maternal behavior, and hypopigmentation (38Shedlovsky A. McDonald J.D. Symula D. Dove W.F. Genetics. 1993; 134: 1205-1210Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These observations suggest that there is an incomplete loss of PAH activity in the absence of DCoH that may be the result of partial complementation by DCoH2 even though levels of DCoH2 are very low relative to those of DCoH itself and appear to be confined to the nuclear compartment except perhaps in the gut where DCoH2 appears to be more abundant.DCoH null mice commonly developed cataracts, most frequently unilateral, but occasionally in both eyes. Although cataracts are common in aging humans and mice, cataract formation was observed at ages varying from before weaning to up to 1 year, but most commonly after 16 weeks of age. DCoH is expressed in the eye and appears to be confined to the retinal pigmented epithelium and not the lens whereas HNF1 expression in the eye has not been observed. Although dehydratase activity may contribute to the synthesis of melanin in the retinal pigmented epithelium, the mechanism of lens fiber disruption when DCoH expression is lost is not clear. No correlation between glucose intolerance and cataract formation in DCoH null mice could be made, and the lack of overt hyperglycemia makes diabetes an unlikely mechanism for cataract formation. Although speculative, it seems possible that DCoH may associate with factors other than HNF1 that contribute to eye development. Such factors may include the siahproteins, recently identified as an interacting protein withXenopus DCoH (39Bogdan S. Senkel S. Esser F. Ryffel G.U. Pogge v. Strandmann E. Mech. Dev. 2001; 103: 61-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar).Supporting such an idea is the expression pattern of DCoH which partially reflects its known activities. In rodents DCoH is expressed abundantly in liver and kidney as well as in the gut, stomach, and pancreas, all tissues that express HNF1 (1Mendel D.B. Khavari P.A. Conley P.B. Graves M.K. Hansen L.P. Admon A. Crabtree G.R. Science. 1991; 254: 1762-1767Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). DCoH expression has also been observed in skin, brain, adrenal gland, and the eye (35Pogge von Strandmann E. Ryffel G.U. Development. 1995; 121: 1217-1226PubMed Google Scholar, 40Strandmann E.P. Senkel S. Ryffel G.U. Int. J. Dev. Biol. 1998; 42: 53-59PubMed Google Scholar, 41Resibois A. Cuvelier L. Svoboda M. Heizmann C.W. Thony B. Histochem.

Although these tissues likely use the enzymatic activity as part of the synthesis of precursors to melanin and neurotransmitters, nuclear staining for DCoH has been observed in these tissues which do not express detectable HNF1. During early frog development, DCoH expression is largely cytoplasmic until the onset of transcription at the midblastula transition when the protein translocates to the nucleus in the absence of HNF1 expression (35Pogge von Strandmann E. Ryffel G.U. Development. 1995; 121: 1217-1226PubMed Google Scholar). Very interestingly, injection of DCoH RNA into early Xenopus embryos results in ectopic hyperpigmentation in the developing ectoderm even if a mutant form of DCoH defective in enzymatic activity is expressed (44Pogge v. Strandmann E. Senkel S. Ryffel G.U. Mech. Dev. 2000; 91: 53-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). These findings have raised the hypothesis that DCoH may have nuclear activities other than interaction with HNF1.Because DCoH enzymatic activity was severely reduced, it was surprising that DCoH null mice did not exhibit phenotypes similar to those observed with the loss of HNF1 activity. Although DCoH stabilizes the DNA binding dimeric form of HNF1 and augments HNF1-dependent transcription in transfection assays with reporter genes (1Mendel D.B. Khavari P.A. Conley P.B. Graves M.K. Hansen L.P. Admon A. Crabtree G.R. Science. 1991; 254: 1762-1767Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar), the necessity of cofactor binding in the natural state was unknown. Expression of α1-antitrypsin, albumin (Fig. 5), and β-fibrinogen and antithrombin 3 (data not shown) were found to be reduced to a degree similar to that found in HNF1α null mice. However, PAH RNA levels and activity (Table I), although reduced, were not attenuated to the degree observed in HNF1α null animals, which have a strong hyperphenylalaninemia not caused by the loss of BH4 recycling, but because PAH transcription is disrupted (12Pontoglio M. Barra J. Hadchouel M. Doyen A. Kress C. Bach J.P. Babinet C. Yaniv M. Cell. 1996; 84: 575-585Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (509) Google Scholar). Similarly, the strong defect in IGF-I transcription observed in HNF1α null mice was not mimicked in DCoH null mice (14Lee Y.H. Sauer B. Gonzalez F.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3059-3068Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). Because HNF1 activity is only partly impaired in DCoH null mice, a complete analysis of the role of DCoH in HNF1-directed transcription will likely require the disruption of DCoH2 expression in combination with DCoH. The complementation of DCoH transcriptional function by DCoH2 makes it likely that DCoH will not be a common target for mutation in MODY families particularly those that display a dominant inheritance pattern. DCoH1 was discovered as a protein that copurified with the HNF1 family of transcription factors (1Mendel D.B. Khavari P.A. Conley P.B. Graves M.K. Hansen L.P. Admon A. Crabtree G.R.

Dimerization is directed by a 31-amino acid domain at the amino terminus of the protein that forms a unique antiparallel four-helix bundle when dimerized (16Rose R.B. Bayle J.H. Endrizzi J.A. Cronk J.D. Crabtree G.R. Alber T. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 744-748Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The dimerization domain appears to be essential for HNF1 function because deletion of the dimerization domain reduces HNF1 DNA binding, and MODY3 mutations that result in amino acid substitution in this domain disrupt DCoH binding and reduce DNA binding (16Rose R.B. Bayle J.H. Endrizzi J.A. Cronk J.D. Crabtree G.R. Alber T. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 744-748Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 17Nicosia A. Monaci P. Tomei L. De Francesco R. Nuzzo M. Stunnenberg H. Cortese R. Cell. 1990; 61: 1225-1236Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). This dimerization domain associates directly with a DCoH dimer. DCoH stabilizes the dimeric, DNA-binding form of HNF1 and augments HNF1-dependent transcription (1Mendel D.B. Khavari P.A. Conley P.B. Graves M.K. Hansen L.P. Admon A. Crabtree G.R. Science. 1991; 254: 1762-1767Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Crystallographic structural studies have demonstrated that the α-helical HNF1 dimerization domain binds to an α-helical cap on the DCoH dimer that overlies a molecular saddle composed of antiparallel β-sheets (16Rose R.B. Bayle J.H. Endrizzi J.A. Cronk J.D. Crabtree G.R. Alber T. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 744-748Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar,18Endrizzi J.A. Cronk J.D. Wang W. Crabtree G.R. Alber T.

The DCoH saddle is similar in structure to the DNA binding saddle of the TATA-binding protein (20Kim J.L. Burley S.K. Structure. 1995; 3: 531-534Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar) and the RNA binding domain of the SRP9/14 domain of the signal recognition particle (21Birse D.E. Kapp U. Strub K. Cusack S. Aberg A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3757-3766Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). These features have led to the hypothesis that DCoH may influence transcription by HNF1 by mechanisms other than its stabilization of HNF1 dimerization; however, no binding of DCoH to DNA or RNA has yet been demonstrated (22Rhee K.H. Stier G. Becker P.B. Suck D. Sandaltzopoulos R. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 265: 20-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). DCoH is a bifunctional molecule that was purified independently as a pterin 4α-carbinolamine dehydratase (PCD) (23Citron B.A. Davis M.D. Milstien S. Gutierrez J. Mendel D.B. Crabtree G.R. Kaufman S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 11891-11894Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 24Hauer C.R. Rebrin I. Thony B. Neuheiser F. Curtius H.C. Hunziker P. Blau N. Ghisla S. Heizmann C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4828-4831Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This activity of cytoplasmic DCoH homotetramers catalyzes a step in the recycling of tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4), a cofactor for amino acid hydroxylases important for the catabolism of phenylalanine as well as the synthesis of catecholamines, serotonin, and nitric oxide (25Kaufman S. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 1993; 13: 261-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). DCoH specifically dehydrates the 4α-OH-BH4 product of hydroxylases to the quinonoid form of BH4 before it can spontaneously rearrange to the 7R isomer, which acts as an inhibitor for PAH (26Davis M.D. Kaufman S. FEBS Lett. 1991; 285: 17-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 27Thony B. Neuheiser F. Kierat L. Blaskovics M. Arn P.H. Ferreira P. Rebrin I. Ayling J. Blau N. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1998; 62: 1302-1311Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). As such, DCoH can enhance the activity of PAH and has been called the PAH-stimulating protein (PHS). Rare cases of hyperphenylalaninemia in humans are caused by DCoH mutations (27Thony B. Neuheiser F. Kierat L. Blaskovics M. Arn P.H. Ferreira P. Rebrin I. Ayling J. Blau N. Am. J. Hum.

Genet. 1993; 53: 768-774PubMed Google Scholar), and the progressive pigmentation disorder vitiligo has been correlated with loss of DCoH enzymatic activity apparently without mutation or hyperphenylalaninemia (29Schallreuter K.U. Wood J.M. Pittelkow M.R. Gutlich M. Lemke K.R. Rodl W. Swanson N.N. Hitzemann K. Ziegler I. Science. 1994; 263: 1444-1446Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar, 30Johnen G. Kowlessur D.

To define further the roles of DCoH, we have created mice in which the DCoH gene is deleted. Although DCoH null mice are viable and fertile, they have hyperphenylalaninemia and a predisposition to cataract formation. Surprisingly, HNF1 function is only partially impaired in DCoH null mice. Although cytoplasmic DCoH expression is undetectable in liver and kidney extracts, a complementing activity that interacts with HNF1 is observed in DCoH null nuclear extracts. This activity is likely to be the result of the low level nuclear expression of a second DCoH-related gene, DCoH2. DISCUSSIONThe DCoH protein is remarkable in that it performs separate cytoplasmic and nuclear functions that affect metabolism and gene expression. Loss of DCoH expression results in a substantial loss in the cytoplasmic, enzymatic activity of DCoH, but an incomplete loss in the nuclear function of DCoH. The nuclear activity of DCoH is likely to be complemented by a close gene family member, DCoH2, reported here. Although apparently dispensable for normal embryonic and postnatal development, DCoH functions in several physiological roles, and its loss in mice results in an increased frequency of cataract formation, hyperphenylalaninemia, and impaired glucose tolerance.The loss of DCoH enzymatic activity uncouples BH4 recycling from PAH activity and results in hyperphenylalaninemia. The observed degree of hyperphenylalaninemia resembles that of weak mutant alleles of murine GTP cyclohydrolase and PAH and in human subjects with homozygous mutations inactivating DCoH enzymatic activity (27Thony B. Neuheiser F. Kierat L. Blaskovics M. Arn P.H. Ferreira P. Rebrin I. Ayling J. Blau N. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1998; 62: 1302-1311Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 28Citron B.A. Kaufman S. Milstien S. Naylor E.W. Greene C.L. Davis M.D. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1993; 53: 768-774PubMed Google Scholar) whereas strong mutants in PAH resemble classic phenylketonuria including ataxia, poor maternal behavior, and hypopigmentation (38Shedlovsky A. McDonald J.D. Symula D. Dove W.F. Genetics. 1993; 134: 1205-1210Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These observations suggest that there is an incomplete loss of PAH activity in the absence of DCoH that may be the result of partial complementation by DCoH2 even though levels of DCoH2 are very low relative to those of DCoH itself and appear to be confined to the nuclear compartment except perhaps in the gut where DCoH2 appears to be more abundant.DCoH null mice commonly developed cataracts, most frequently unilateral, but occasionally in both eyes. Although cataracts are common in aging humans and mice, cataract formation was observed at ages varying from before weaning to up to 1 year, but most commonly after 16 weeks of age. DCoH is expressed in the eye and appears to be confined to the retinal pigmented epithelium and not the lens whereas HNF1 expression in the eye has not been observed. Although dehydratase activity may contribute to the synthesis of melanin in the retinal pigmented epithelium, the mechanism of lens fiber disruption when DCoH expression is lost is not clear. No correlation between glucose intolerance and cataract formation in DCoH null mice could be made, and the lack of overt hyperglycemia makes diabetes an unlikely mechanism for cataract formation. Although speculative, it seems possible that DCoH may associate with factors other than HNF1 that contribute to eye development. Such factors may include the siahproteins, recently identified as an interacting protein withXenopus DCoH (39Bogdan S. Senkel S. Esser F. Ryffel G.U. Pogge v. Strandmann E. Mech. Dev. 2001; 103: 61-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar).Supporting such an idea is the expression pattern of DCoH which partially reflects its known activities. In rodents DCoH is expressed abundantly in liver and kidney as well as in the gut, stomach, and pancreas, all tissues that express HNF1 (1Mendel D.B. Khavari P.A. Conley P.B. Graves M.K. Hansen L.P. Admon A. Crabtree G.R. Science. 1991; 254: 1762-1767Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). DCoH expression has also been observed in skin, brain, adrenal gland, and the eye (35Pogge von Strandmann E. Ryffel G.U. Development. 1995; 121: 1217-1226PubMed Google Scholar, 40Strandmann E.P.

Although these tissues likely use the enzymatic activity as part of the synthesis of precursors to melanin and neurotransmitters, nuclear staining for DCoH has been observed in these tissues which do not express detectable HNF1. During early frog development, DCoH expression is largely cytoplasmic until the onset of transcription at the midblastula transition when the protein translocates to the nucleus in the absence of HNF1 expression (35Pogge von Strandmann E. Ryffel G.U. Development. 1995; 121: 1217-1226PubMed Google Scholar). Very interestingly, injection of DCoH RNA into early Xenopus embryos results in ectopic hyperpigmentation in the developing ectoderm even if a mutant form of DCoH defective in enzymatic activity is expressed (44Pogge v. Strandmann E. Senkel S. Ryffel G.U. Mech. Dev. 2000; 91: 53-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). These findings have raised the hypothesis that DCoH may have nuclear activities other than interaction with HNF1.Because DCoH enzymatic activity was severely reduced, it was surprising that DCoH null mice did not exhibit phenotypes similar to those observed with the loss of HNF1 activity. Although DCoH stabilizes the DNA binding dimeric form of HNF1 and augments HNF1-dependent transcription in transfection assays with reporter genes (1Mendel D.B. Khavari P.A. Conley P.B. Graves M.K. Hansen L.P. Admon A. Crabtree G.R. Science. 1991; 254: 1762-1767Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar), the necessity of cofactor binding in the natural state was unknown. Expression of α1-antitrypsin, albumin (Fig. 5), and β-fibrinogen and antithrombin 3 (data not shown) were found to be reduced to a degree similar to that found in HNF1α null mice. However, PAH RNA levels and activity (Table I), although reduced, were not attenuated to the degree observed in HNF1α null animals, which have a strong hyperphenylalaninemia not caused by the loss of BH4 recycling, but because PAH transcription is disrupted (12Pontoglio M. Barra J. Hadchouel M. Doyen A. Kress C. Bach J.P. Babinet C. Yaniv M. Cell. 1996; 84: 575-585Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (509) Google Scholar). Similarly, the strong defect in IGF-I transcription observed in HNF1α null mice was not mimicked in DCoH null mice (14Lee Y.H. Sauer B. Gonzalez F.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3059-3068Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). Because HNF1 activity is only partly impaired in DCoH null mice, a complete analysis of the role of DCoH in HNF1-directed transcription will likely require the disruption of DCoH2 expression in combination with DCoH. The complementation of DCoH transcriptional function by DCoH2 makes it likely that DCoH will not be a common target for mutation in MODY families particularly those that display a dominant inheritance pattern. The DCoH protein is remarkable in that it performs separate cytoplasmic and nuclear functions that affect metabolism and gene expression.

The effect of NCS-1 was specific for GLUT4 and the insulin-responsive aminopeptidase translocation as there was no effect on the trafficking of the cation-independent mannose 6-phosphate receptor or the GLUT1 glucose transporter isoform. Moreover, NCS-1 showed partial colocalization with GLUT4-EGFP in the perinuclear region. The inhibitory action of NCS-1 was independent of calcium sequestration since neither treatment with ionomycin nor endothelin-1, both of which elevated the intracellular calcium concentration, restored insulin-stimulated GLUT4 translocation. Furthermore, NCS-1 did not alter the insulin-stimulated protein kinase B (PKB/Akt) phosphorylation or the recruitment of Cbl to the plasma membrane. In contrast, expression of the NCS-1 effector phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase (PI 4-kinase) inhibited insulin-stimulated GLUT4 translocation, whereas co-transfection with an inactive PI 4-kinase mutant prevented the NCS-1-induced inhibition. These data demonstrate that PI 4-kinase functions to negatively regulate GLUT4 translocation through its interaction with NCS-1.

This family of proteins has been linked to the regulation of various intracellular events including phototransduction, neurotransmitter release, control of cyclic nucleotide metabolism, gene expression, ion channels function, and phosphoinositide metabolism. For example, Drosophila mutants overexpressing frequenin display a frequency-dependent facilitation of neurotransmitter release at the neuromuscular junction (5Pongs O. Lindemeier J. Zhu X. Theil T. Engelkamp D. Krah-Jentgens I. Lambrecht H.G. Koch K.W. Schwemer J. Rivosecchi R. Mallart A. Galuran J. Canal I. Barbas J.A. Ferros A.

Similarly, overexpression of frequenin in PC12 cells potentiates agonist (ATP)-stimulated secretion of growth hormone (6McFerran B. Graham M. Burgoyne R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22768-22772Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). These data suggest that NCS-1/frequenin may function as a positive regulator of vesicle exocytosis. However, a negative role for NCS-1 was observed in Madin-Darby canine kidney cells, where overexpression of NCS-1 inhibited apical membrane transport without affecting trafficking to the basolateral membrane (7Weisz O.

Wang B. Schnieders E. Thorner J. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 234-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Pik1p is an essential enzyme necessary for normal secretion, Golgi membrane traffic, and vacuole membrane dynamics and endocytosis in yeast (9Walch-Solimena C. Novick P. Nat.

In mammalian cells, NCS-1 directly interacts with the phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase β isoform, the human homologue of yeast Pik1p (12Meyers R. Cantley L. J. Biol.

Furthermore, the binding of NCS-1 stimulates the lipid kinase activity of phosphatidylinositol (PI) 4-kinase β (13Zhao X. Varnai P. Tuymetova G. Balla A. Toth Z. Oker-Blom C. Roder J. Jeromin A.

Because NCS-1 appears to function as a regulatory subunit of the PI 4-kinase and has been implicated in the control of several membrane transport processes, we have examined the function of NCS-1 in the regulation of insulin-stimulated GLUT4 translocation. In this study, we demonstrate that overexpression of NCS-1 in 3T3L1 adipocytes inhibits GLUT4 translocation through its interaction with PI 4-kinase β.DISCUSSIONRecent studies demonstrate a role for NCS-1 in the potentiation of neurotransmitter release and in promoting exocytosis in adrenal chromaffin cells and PC12 cells (6McFerran B. Graham M. Burgoyne R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22768-22772Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). These secretory events are calcium-dependent; however, a role for NCS-1 in non-calcium-dependent secretion has not yet been examined. One of the best examples of regulated membrane transport is the insulin-stimulated translocation of the GLUT4 glucose transporter in adipocytes (36Saltiel A. Pessin J.E. Trends Cell Biol. 2002; 12: 65-71Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar, 37Watson R. Pessin J. Exp.

Cell Res. 1999; 253: 55-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). This transport pathway is not regulated by changes in intracellular calcium levels but is dependent upon the insulin-stimulated formation of phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (22Ross S.A. Herbst J.J. Keller S.R. Lienhard G.E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 239: 247-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 40Hausdorff S. Fingar D. Morioka K. Garza L. Whiteman E. Summers S.

Chem. 1996; 271: 17605-17608Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar).Our data demonstrated that overexpression of NCS-1 in differentiated 3T3L1 adipocytes markedly inhibited the insulin-stimulated translocation of GLUT4 from its intracellular storage site to the plasma membrane. This inhibitory function appears specific for GLUT4 because the constitutive trafficking of GLUT1 was unaffected. In addition, insulin can also induce the plasma membrane translocation of the MP6R from compartments distinct from GLUT4 (24Kandror K.V. Pilch P.F. Biochem. J. 1998; 331: 829-835Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 43Kandror K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25210-25217Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Consistent with a specific GLUT4 inhibitory function, NCS-1 overexpression had no effect on the insulin-stimulated translocation of MP6R.Although calcium does not function as a mediator of insulin-stimulated GLUT4 translocation, chelation of intracellular calcium with BAPTA or blocking of calmodulin function is inhibitory (27Whitehead J. Molero J. Clark S. Martin S. Meneilly G. James D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 27816-27824Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 28Yang C. Watson R. Elmendorf J. Sacks D. Pessin J. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 317-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). BAPTA appeared to function by preventing the insulin stimulation of Akt activation that was reversed by elevation of intracellular calcium by treatment with the calcium ionophore A23187. Because NCS-1 can efficiently bind calcium, it was formally possible that NCS-1 was functioning similar to BAPTA. However, the inhibitory effect of NCS-1 was not reversed by increasing intracellular calcium by either endothelin-1 or ionomycin treatment. Furthermore, NCS-1 expression had no significant effect on insulin-stimulated Akt phosphorylation. These results suggested that NCS-1 was not exerting its effects though a calcium chelation mechanism. In addition, insulin-stimulated plasma membrane recruitment of Cbl was unaffected, suggesting that both the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and CAP/Cbl insulin-signaling pathways were functional.More recently, NCS-1 appears to directly interact with PI 4-kinase β and to activate its lipid kinase activity (13Zhao X. Varnai P. Tuymetova G. Balla A. Toth Z. Oker-Blom C. Roder J. Jeromin A. Balla T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 40183-40189Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). In this regard, it has been reported that highly purified intracellular membrane compartments containing GLUT4 also contain PI 4-kinase activity (14Del Vecchio R. Pilch P. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 13278-13283Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Kristiansen S. Ramlal T. Klip A. Biochem. J. 1998; 335: 351-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Consistent with these data, both NCS-1 and PI 4-kinase partially colocalized with GLUT4. Although a specific role for PI 4-kinase activity in regulating GLUT4 trafficking has not been established, our data indicate that overexpression of wild type but not a kinase-defective PI 4-kinase β prevented insulin-stimulated GLUT4 translocation. These data are consistent with PI 4-kinase activity functioning as a negative regulatory signal in this process. Moreover, expression of the kinase-defective PI 4-kinase β restored the insulin-induced translocation of GLUT4 to the plasma membrane in cells overexpressing NCS-1. Because NCS-1 is a known activator of PI 4-kinase activity, these data strongly support a model whereby NCS-1 activation of PI 4-kinase generates an inhibitory signal specific for the insulin-stimulated GLUT4 translocation process. This conclusion is supported by the down-regulation of NCS-1 and PI 4-kinase expression that accompanies adipocyte differentiation. It remains to be determined whether or not PI-4 kinase activity prevents sorting of GLUT4 to its insulin-responsive compartment, exit from this compartment, or in the translocation process itself. Neuronal calcium sensor 1 (NCS-1)1 is one member of a large family of calcium-binding proteins that includes frequenin, recoverin, guanylate cyclase-activating proteins, neurocalcin, and visinin (1Polans A. Baehr W. Palczewski K. Trends Neurosci. 1996; 19: 547-554Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar, 2Burgoyne R. Weiss J. Biochem.

Res. Commun. 2002; 290: 615-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). This family of proteins has been linked to the regulation of various intracellular events including phototransduction, neurotransmitter release, control of cyclic nucleotide metabolism, gene expression, ion channels function, and phosphoinositide metabolism. For example, Drosophila mutants overexpressing frequenin display a frequency-dependent facilitation of neurotransmitter release at the neuromuscular junction (5Pongs O. Lindemeier J. Zhu X. Theil T. Engelkamp D. Krah-Jentgens I. Lambrecht H.G. Koch K.W. Schwemer J. Rivosecchi R. Mallart A. Galuran J. Canal I. Barbas J.A. Ferros A. Neuron. 1993; 11: 15-28Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). Similarly, overexpression of frequenin in PC12 cells potentiates agonist (ATP)-stimulated secretion of growth hormone (6McFerran B. Graham M. Burgoyne R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22768-22772Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). These data suggest that NCS-1/frequenin may function as a positive regulator of vesicle exocytosis. However, a negative role for NCS-1 was observed in Madin-Darby canine kidney cells, where overexpression of NCS-1 inhibited apical membrane transport without affecting trafficking to the basolateral membrane (7Weisz O. Gibson G. Leung S. Roder J. Jeromin A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24341-24347Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Recently the yeast homologue of frequenin (Frq1p) was reported to function as a calcium-sensing subunit of Pik1p, a phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase (8Hendricks K. Wang B. Schnieders E. Thorner J. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 234-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Pik1p is an essential enzyme necessary for normal secretion, Golgi membrane traffic, and vacuole membrane dynamics and endocytosis in yeast (9Walch-Solimena C. Novick P. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 523-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar, 10Audhya A. Foti M. Emr S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 2673-2689Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). In these cells, Pik1p mutants exhibit severe protein trafficking defects and accumulate morphologically aberrant Golgi membranes (9Walch-Solimena C. Novick P. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 523-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar, 11Hama H. Schnieders E. Thorner J. Takemoto J. DeWald D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34294-34300Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). In mammalian cells, NCS-1 directly interacts with the phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase β isoform, the human homologue of yeast Pik1p (12Meyers R. Cantley L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4384-4390Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the binding of NCS-1 stimulates the lipid kinase activity of phosphatidylinositol (PI) 4-kinase β (13Zhao X. Varnai P. Tuymetova G. Balla A. Toth Z. Oker-Blom C. Roder J. Jeromin A. Balla T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 40183-40189Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Previously, it was observed that highly purified GLUT4-containing vesicles from both rat adipocytes and skeletal muscle were highly enriched for PI 4-kinase activity (14Del Vecchio R. Pilch P. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 13278-13283Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Kristiansen S. Ramlal T. Klip A. Biochem. J. 1998; 335: 351-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar).

TOT can be dissociated from Elongator function byELP3/TOT3 mutagenesis, suggesting that Elongator communicates with γ-toxin in a HAT-dependent manner (23Jablonowski D. Frohloff F. Fichtner L. Stark M.J.R. Schaffrath R. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 42: 1095-1105Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). As Elongator is non-essential, it cannot simply be blocked by γ-toxin. Instead, its function may be modified so that pol II activity becomes poisoned. Evidences demonstrating down-regulation of pol II-dependent genes (22Frohloff F. Fichtner L. Jablonowski D. Breunig K.D. Schaffrath R. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1993-2003Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar) and expression of partial zymocin resistance on overproducing Fcp1p, the CTD phosphatase, support this notion (23Jablonowski D. Frohloff F. Fichtner L. Stark M.J.R. Schaffrath R. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 42: 1095-1105Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). To study a link between zymocin action and pol II function, we found progressive CTD truncations and mutations in CTD kinase genes to result in zymocin hypersensitivity. Remarkably, zymocin treatment led to accumulation of pol II form II0. As judged from chromatin immune precipitations (CHIP), zymocin-arrested cells were affected with regards to pol II binding to and transcription of the ADH1locus. Our data imply that zymocin affects, in a manner presumably dependent on Elongator, pol II function, a scenario assumed to lead to down-regulation of pol II transcription and eventually cause the observed G1 arrest. All yeast strains used in this study are described in TableI. Standard YPD (1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, 2% dextrose) and SD (0.67% yeast nitrogen base, 2% dextrose) media were prepared as described (30Sherman F. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 3-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (2526) Google Scholar). Zymocin sensitivity or resistance was assessed using the killer eclipse assay (31Kishida M. Tokunaga M. Katayose Y. Yajima H. Kawamura-Watabe A. Hishinuma F. Biosci. Biotechnol. Biochem. 1996; 60: 798-801Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) and zymocin YPD plate assays. The latter involved partial purification of zymocin from AWJ137 cell-free culture supernatants and supplementation to YPD plates (5Jablonowski D. Fichtner L. Martin V.J. Klassen R. Meinhardt F.

Microbiol. 2001; 42: 1095-1105Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Zymocin arrest of S. cerevisiae strain LS20 involved partial purification of zymocin from K. lactis killer AWJ137 grown in YPD flask cultures for 48 h at 30 °C. After centrifugation (6,000 rpm) 50 ml of cell-free supernatants were mixed with 50 ml of 2× YPD medium and inoculated with LS20 cells. These were arrested by zymocin on further incubating for 3–6 h at 30 °C. As controls, untreated LS20 cultures were incubated for the same period of time. Following harvest (6,000 rpm at 4 °C), cells were disrupted by the glass bead method using a multivortex (five 60-s bursts at 4 °C) in 500 μl of breaking buffer B60 (32Zachariae W. Shin T.H. Galova M. Obermaier B. Nasmyth K. Science. 1996; 274: 1201-1204Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). After clearing the cell lysates protein content was measured using the Bio-Rad kit. Identical amounts of total protein obtained from three independent experiments of untreated and zymocin-arrested cells were subjected to SDS-PAGE analysis using 6% gels, electroblotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Immobilon), and probed with mouse monclonal anti-pol IIA and anti-pol II0 antibodies 8WG16 and H14 (Covance). Protein loadings were compared using a polyclonal rabbit antibody directed against the α- and β-subunits of yeast Pfk1p (33Kirchberger J. Edelmann A. Kopperschläger G. Heinisch J.J. Biochem. J. 1999; 341: 15-23Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). pol II quantitation used the Image Master 2D (Amersham Biosciences) program.Table IStrains Open table in a new tab CHIPs were carried out as described (34Komarnitsky P. Cho E.-J. Buratowski S. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2452-2460Crossref PubMed Scopus (794) Google Scholar). In brief, untreated and zymocin-arrested yeast cells grown toA 600 ∼1.0 in YPD were cross-linked for 15 min in 1% (v/v) formaldehyde. Following addition of 2.5 ml of 2.5m glycine and three 1× TBS (20 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.6, 137 mm NaCl) washes, cells were lysed with glass beads in FA lysis buffer (34Komarnitsky P. Cho E.-J. Buratowski S. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2452-2460Crossref PubMed Scopus (794) Google Scholar). Sheared chromatin solution was added to the anti-CTD and anti-CTD-S5-P antibodies 8WG16 and H14 (Covance) and incubated for 90 min. Following the addition of secondary antibodies coupled to protein A-Sepharose CL-4B beads (AmershamBiosciences) and incubation for a further 60 min, chromatin was immunoprecipitated, washed, and incubated at 65 °C for 10 min. Following SDS treatment, chromatin was subjected to protease treatment and reversal of the cross-links (35Kuras L. Struhl K. Nature. 1999; 399: 609-613Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). For all subsequent PCR reactions a single preparation of immunoprecipitated chromatin served as template. PCR conditions and electrophoresis were as described (34Komarnitsky P. Cho E.-J.

Our previous findings that pol II Elongator mutations confer zymocin resistance (22Frohloff F. Fichtner L. Jablonowski D. Breunig K.D. Schaffrath R. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1993-2003Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar) and that overexpression of Fcp1p, the pol II CTD-phosphatase (36Kobor M.S. Archambault J. Lester W. Holstege F.C.P. Gileadi O.

Schaffrath R. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 42: 1095-1105Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) indicated a functional link between zymocin, pol II, and Elongator. To ask whether pol II activity is correlated with expression of zymocin sensitivity we studied the effects of genetic conditions known or assumed to impair pol II activity on the response of a yeast cell to zymocin. Of the four yeast cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) involved in pol II CTD phosphorylation, we assayed deletions ofSRB10/SRB11 andCTK1/CTK2/CTK3 and partial loss-of-function mutations in KIN28 andBUR1/BUR2 (28Lee J.M. Greenleaf A.L. Gene Expr. 1991; 1: 149-167PubMed Google Scholar, 34Komarnitsky P. Cho E.-J. Buratowski S. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2452-2460Crossref PubMed Scopus (794) Google Scholar, 37Sterner D.E.

As became evident from increased sizes of eclipses formed in a K. lactis/S. cerevisiae colony interaction killer eclipse assay,bur1-2 and bur2-1 mutants were hypersensitive toward zymocin (Fig. 1 A). Similarly, deletion of CTK1, the α-subunit structural gene of the CTDK-I kinase, resulted in zymocin hypersensitivity, whereas disruption of the β- (CTK2) and γ- (CTK3) subunit genes failed to have any effect (Fig. 1 B). Moreover, disruption of either the SRB10 CTD kinase gene or itsSRB11 cyclin gene led to zymocin hypersensitivity as judged from YPD zymocin plate (Fig. 1 C) and killer eclipse assays (not shown); thus, compared with their isogenic wild-type parent,srb10Δ and srb11Δ cells became arrested by less amounts of zymocin. Consistently, a KIN28 mutant (kin28T17D, Ref. 34Komarnitsky P. Cho E.-J. Buratowski S. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2452-2460Crossref PubMed Scopus (794) Google Scholar) with reduced kinase activity was found to be zymocin-hypersensitive, too, when tested in eclipse (Fig.1 D) or zymocin plate assays (not shown). In conclusion, genetic scenarios that impair pol II function by (partial) loss of CTD-CDK activities alter the responsivenss of a yeast cell to zymocin and cause hypersensitive phenotypes. Thus, cells with reduced CDK activities require less amounts of zymocin than wild-type cells to become arrested in G1. This finding strongly suggests a functional link between zymocin mode of action and the CTD of pol II. Inspired by reports that underproduction of pol II (42Archambault J. Jansma D.B. Friesen J.D. Genetics. 1996; 142: 737-747Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) phencopies the effects of CTD truncation mutations,i.e. slow growth, inositol auxotrophy, and thermosensitivity (43Nonet M. Scafe C. Sexton J. Young R.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 1602-1611Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar, 44West M.L. Corden J.L. Genetics. 1995; 140: 1223-1233Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and by our observation that pol II underassembly leads to zymocin hypersensitivity (23Jablonowski D. Frohloff F. Fichtner L. Stark M.J.R. Schaffrath R. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 42: 1095-1105Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), we studied the effects of progressively truncating the CTD of pol II on the response of a yeast cell to zymocin. As can be deduced from the appropriate YPD zymocin plate assays presented in Fig. 2 B, most viable CTD truncations (Ref. 45Koleske A.J. Buratowski S. Nonet M. Young R.A. Cell. 1992; 69: 883-894Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar; Fig. 2, pV8,pV4, pV3, pV7, and pV19) behaved comparable with wild-type full-length CTD and unaltered with respect to zymocin sensitivity phenotypes on plates supplemented with 45–50% (v/v) zymocin. However, the penultimate and ultimate viable CTD truncations (Ref. 45Koleske A.J. Buratowski S. Nonet M. Young R.A. Cell. 1992; 69: 883-894Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar; Fig. 2, pV20 and pV17), and all progressive ones reported to express conditional phenotypes (Ref. 45Koleske A.J. Buratowski S. Nonet M. Young R.A. Cell. 1992; 69: 883-894Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar; Fig. 2, pC2, pC23, pC6,pC1, and pC3) were found to confer hypersensitivity to zymocin (Fig. 2). Thus, hypersensitive phenotypes could be correlated with conditional phenotypes of CTD truncations. This appears to be consistent with the effects of pol II underassembly on expression of hypersensitivity toward zymocin (23Jablonowski D. Frohloff F. Fichtner L. Stark M.J.R. Schaffrath R. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 42: 1095-1105Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Taken together with the above findings on the effect of CTD-CDK mutants on zymocin sensitivity, other scenarios that lead to an overall reduction of pol II function convert sensitive yeast cells into hypersensitive ones. This reinforces the notion that zymocin action is linked to a functional pol II CTD. Since pol II Elongator is essential for zymocicity (22Frohloff F. Fichtner L. Jablonowski D. Breunig K.D. Schaffrath R. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1993-2003Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar) and stably associates with pol II form II0 (16Otero G. Fellows J., Li, Y. de Bizemont T. Dirac A.M. Gustafsson C.M. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Svejstrup J.Q. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 109-118Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar), we next asked whether zymocin may require Elongator to be associated with II0 and whether zymocin influences the phosphorylation equlibrium of pol II. To do so, identical protein amounts obtained from untreated and zymocin-arrested cells were subjected to SDS-PAGE analysis, electroblotted, and immunoprobed with anti-IIA (8WG16) or anti-II0 (H14) antibodies to distinguish hypo- from hyperphosphorylated pol II forms IIA and II0. As illustrated in Fig. 3 A, this analysis revealed that while untreated cells had unaltered II0/IIA ratios over a period of 6 h, zymocin treatment had an effect on the phosphorylation states of pol II; 3 h post-treatment, pol II form II0 accumulated 2-fold compared with the same time point of the untreated sample, and pol II form IIA remained almost unchanged; 6 h post-treatment, however, pol II form IIA drastically declined, consistent with a 5-fold increase of pol II form II0. Thus, on treating cells with zymocin, the ratio between pol II forms IIA and II0 became dramatically shifted toward the latter, indicating that zymocin-arrested cells accumulate pol II in its hyperphosphorylated form II0. Similarly, pol II form II0 was found to accumulate in zymocin-arrested cells that were subjected to cell fractionation, while form IIA declined after zymocin treatment (Fig. 3 B). These results suggest that zymocin action interferes with pol II function by preventing preinitiation complex formation-competent pol II form IIA to be recycled from elongating form II0 during the pol II transcription cycle. As judged from reverse transcriptase-PCR and Northern hybridization studies, zymocin appears to preferentially affect pol II rather than pol I or pol III function (22Frohloff F. Fichtner L. Jablonowski D. Breunig K.D. Schaffrath R. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1993-2003Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Therefore, we decided to study pol II action in untreated and zymocin-arrested cells while being bound to and transcribing through the ADH1 locus. To do so, CHIPs were carried out with anti-IIA (8WG16) or anti-II0 (H14) antibodies and subjected to PCR using primers to amplify DNA fragments specific for the ADH1 promoter or its coding sequences (Fig.4 A). Consistent with a previous CHIP study (34Komarnitsky P. Cho E.-J. Buratowski S. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2452-2460Crossref PubMed Scopus (794) Google Scholar), our analysis demonstrated that in untreated cells the predominant fractions of pol II form IIA are found at theADH1 promoter and the early coding sequence (Fig.4 B, left upper panel), while hyperphosphorylated pol II form II0 was preferentially found to associate with the promoter. As soon as it clears the promoter there is a significant decrease of H14-mediated recognition, indicating that the CTD of pol II is subject to dephosphorylation (Fig. 4 B, left middle panel). Thus, initially in early elongation pol II is heavily phosphorylated on the Ser5 of CTD, whereas later in elongation Ser5 becomes dephosphorylated (34Komarnitsky P. Cho E.-J. Buratowski S. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2452-2460Crossref PubMed Scopus (794) Google Scholar). In striking contrast to this pattern were CHIPs performed with zymocin-arrested cells; while pol IIA bound to the promoter was drastically reduced compared with untreated cells, it was found to be predominantly associated within the early coding sequence of the ADH1 gene after zymocin application (Fig. 4 B, right upper panel). As for pol II form II0, zymocin treatment significantly interfered with its capability to bind to the ADH1 promoter, resulting in a steep decrease compared with the parallel experiment without zymocin (Fig. 4 B, right middle panel). While the latter finding suggests that zymocin-arrested cells are transcriptionally impaired with regards to recruiting pol II form IIA to the ADH1 promoter, the former observations may be interpreted as pol II recognized by the 8WG16 antibody being stalled during early ADH1 transcription elongation. Taken together, these CHIP studies suggest that zymocin action is linked to pol II function and imply that zymocin negatively interferes with the pol II transcription cycle by affecting the recycling of initiation-competent IIA from elongation-competent II0. The recent identification of the pol II Elongator complex as TOT, the putative target of the K. lactis zymocin (22Frohloff F. Fichtner L. Jablonowski D. Breunig K.D. Schaffrath R. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1993-2003Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar), has implied a link between zymocin action and pol II transcriptional elongation (23Jablonowski D. Frohloff F. Fichtner L. Stark M.J.R. Schaffrath R. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 42: 1095-1105Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Since TOT/Elongator is dispensable for life, its function cannot simply be blocked by zymocin (and its γ-toxin subunit). Instead, it has been proposed that Elongator becomes modified so that pol II activity is poisoned (22Frohloff F. Fichtner L. Jablonowski D. Breunig K.D. Schaffrath R. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1993-2003Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 23Jablonowski D. Frohloff F. Fichtner L. Stark M.J.R. Schaffrath R. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 42: 1095-1105Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). To check this model we asked whether cells, compromised for pol II function, are altered with respect to their response to zymocin too. Genetic scenarios leading to reduced pol II function by mutating individual pol II CTD-CDK genes or by progressively truncating the CTD itself were found to confer zymocin hypersensitivity. Thus, the ability of a cell to express wild-type zymocin sensitivity is at least in part determined by the length of the CTD and the presence of each of the four known yeast CTD-CDK genes. Presumed stability of the CTD of the pol II subunit in these mutants was not affected (and for CTD truncation variants this has been shown; Ref. 44West M.L. Corden J.L. Genetics. 1995; 140: 1223-1233Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), but rather assembly of pol II holoenzyme was interfered with so that its function was compromised with respect to interaction with mediator (during initiation) or with Elongator (on CTD phosphorylation and promoter clearance); both scenarios, CTD truncation and CTD-CDK mutation, would ultimately lead to a decline of pol II activity. Consistently, CTD truncations and CTD-CDK mutations phenocopy the effects of underproducing the largest CTD-subunit of pol II, Rpb1p, which include slow growth, temperature sensitivity, inositol auxotrophy, and zymocin hypersensitivity (23Jablonowski D. Frohloff F. Fichtner L. Stark M.J.R. Schaffrath R. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 42: 1095-1105Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 42Archambault J. Jansma D.B. Friesen J.D. Genetics. 1996; 142: 737-747Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 45Koleske A.J. Buratowski S. Nonet M. Young R.A. Cell. 1992; 69: 883-894Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Together with the facts that zymocin action requires a functional pol II Elongator complex and that overexpressing Fcp1p, the CTD-phosphatase of pol II, renders cells partially zymocin-resistant (23Jablonowski D. Frohloff F. Fichtner L. Stark M.J.R. Schaffrath R. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 42: 1095-1105Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), these findings suggest that zymocin action requires Elongator to be associated with pol II0 while elongating. Zymocin hypersenitivity due to the above conditions (pol II underassembly, CTD deletions, and CTD-CDK mutations) may imply that in the mutant cells the equilibrium between pol II-free and pol II-bound Elongator is imbalanced, eventually leading to a net increase of Elongator capable of signaling the presence of zymocin. In support of this, the requirement of TOT for γ-toxin and zymocin action was shown to be separable from Elongator wild-type function byTOT3/ELP3 mutagenesis, suggesting that Elongator communicates with γ-toxin (directly or indirectly) in a manner dependent on its HAT subunit (23Jablonowski D. Frohloff F. Fichtner L. Stark M.J.R. Schaffrath R. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 42: 1095-1105Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). How to integrate these findings in a model that explains both requirement of Elongator for and involvement of pol II in zymocin action? Our observations that zymocin-arrested cells accumulate pol II form II0 and that binding of pol II to the ADH1 promoter is dramatically reduced following zymocin treatment are indicative for pol II function being affected. Consistently, we have demonstrated down-regulation of pol II activity (22Frohloff F. Fichtner L. Jablonowski D. Breunig K.D. Schaffrath R. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1993-2003Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar) in the presence of zymocin, while pol I activity largely remains unaffected (22Frohloff F. Fichtner L. Jablonowski D. Breunig K.D. Schaffrath R. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1993-2003Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Thus, zymocin appears to preferentially affect pol II rather than pol I (or pol III) function. An attractive, though speculative, model as to how zymocin might work at the molecular level involves γ-toxin to transform Elongator so that pol II becomes limiting. If this conversion conferred a dominant negative effect onto pol II function for example by blocking pol II in its II0 form, zymocin-treated cells would be expected to be seriously affected with regards to pol II recycling during transcription. In favor of this are our findings showing that the IIA/II0 ratio is imbalanced toward form II0 following zymocin application. Also, the CHIP studies demonstrate that form IIA predominantly accumulates during early transcription elongation within the ADH1 gene, while pol II0 is significantly impaired with regards to ADH1 promoter binding and clearance. Thus, pol II recycling necessary for preinitiation complex formation is likely affected by zymocin. Such a scenario can be ultimately envisaged to result in a decline of overall pol II activity and might eventually, due to a transcriptional shutdown of the START-specific gene program, culminate in the observed G1 cell cycle arrest. Consistent with this notion are temperature-sensitive mutations in the largest CTD subunits of yeast and hamster pol II, which cause a conditional G1 arrest at START (46Drebot M.A. Johnston G.C. Friesen J.D. Singer R.A. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1993; 241: 327-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 47Sugaya K. Sasanuma S. Cook P.R. Mita K. Gene (Amst.). 2001; 274: 77-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Thus, cell cycle progression and START execution appear to be particularly sensitive to an impaired pol II function.

Biochem. 2000; 69: 597-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Like other small catalytically active ribozymes, δ ribozymes cleave a phosphodiester bond of their RNA substrates, yielding reaction products containing a 5′-hydroxyl and a 2′,3′-cyclic phosphate termini. Trans-acting ribozymes (Rz)1 have been developed by removing the J1/2 junction, producing one molecule possessing the substrate (S) sequence and the other possessing the catalytic domain (Rz) (Fig. 1). According to the pseudoknot model, which is well supported by experimental data, the secondary structure of δ ribozymes consists of one stem (P1), one pseudoknot (P2), two stem-loops (P3-L3 and P4-L4), and three single-stranded junctions referred to as the linker stems (J1/2, J1/4, and J4/2) (Fig. 1; see Refs. 1Wickham G.S. Been M.D. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2002; 59: 112-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar and 2Doherty E.A. Doudna J.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 597-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). It has been reported that after the formation of the P1 stem, an additional pseudoknot, named P1.1, consisting of two base pairs (bp) composed of nucleotides of the J1/4 junction and the P3 loop, was also formed (1Wickham G.S. Been M.D. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2002; 59: 112-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 3Ferre-D'Amare A.R. Zhou K. Doudna J.A.

It has been demonstrated that imidazole buffer rescues the activity of a mutant antigenomic-derived δ ribozyme possessing U76 instead of the usual C76 (referred as C47 in the trans-acting δ ribozyme used here) (5Perrotta A.T. Shih I. Been M.D. Science. 1999; 286: 123-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). This result suggests that C76 acts as a general base in the catalytic mechanism. However, it has been shown that the corresponding cytosine residue (C75) of a genomic-derived ribozyme acts as a general acid in the presence of a bound hydrated metal hydroxide acting as a base (6Nakano S. Chadalavada D.M. Bevilacqua P.C. Science. 2000; 287: 1493-1497Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). In the latter report, it was also shown that in the absence of bivalent cation, a very high concentration of NaCl supports the cleavage activity although at a pH near 5.0. The ability of δ ribozyme to efficiently carry out general acid-base catalysis appears to be unique among all known catalytic RNAs (6Nakano S. Chadalavada D.M. Bevilacqua P.C. Science. 2000; 287: 1493-1497Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). δ ribozyme has a highly ordered catalytic center that is revealed by a number of unusual properties reported for cis-acting versions as compared with other self-cleaving RNA motifs (2Doherty E.A. Doudna J.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 597-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). For example, it is extremely stable, with an optimal reaction temperature of about 65 °C, and retains activity at temperatures as high as 80 °C and in buffer containing 5 m urea or 18m formamide. Based on the crystal structure of a self-cleaved genomic δ RNA, several tertiary interactions were proposed to take place within the catalytic core of the ribozyme (3Ferre-D'Amare A.R. Zhou K. Doudna J.A. Nature. 1998; 395: 567-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (680) Google Scholar,7Ferré-D'Amaré A.R. Doudna J.A. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 295: 541-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). The 2′-hydroxyl groups (2′-OHs) of ribonucleotides appear to be key players in a number of these interactions. More generally, 2′-OHs were shown to contribute to the catalytic mechanism of various RNA molecules, to ensure an efficient catalytic core structure, and to bind to other macromolecules or cofactors including bivalent cations (8Verma S. Eckstein F. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 99-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar, 9Quigley G.J. Rich A. Science. 1976; 194: 796-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar, 10Jack A.

However, in the case of δ ribozyme, the identification in solution of the 2′-OH(s) important for its catalysis remains to be performed. This information is of primary importance to be able to better understand the molecular mechanism of this catalytic RNA. The chemical synthesis of RNA polymers permits the use of site-specific functional modifications (e.g. the substitution of deoxyriboses (2′-H) for riboses (2′-OH)) to identify the chemical groups that make important contributions to the activity of an RNA species (for a review, see Ref. 8Verma S. Eckstein F. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 99-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). The main limiting factor in this approach is the size of the RNA molecule. The 57-nucleotide (nt) δ ribozyme derived from the antigenomic RNA strand of the hepatitis δ virus (Refs. 16Mercure S. Lafontaine D. Ananvoranich S. Perreault J.P. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 16975-16982Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar and 17Ananvoranich S. Perreault J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13182-13188Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar; Fig. 1) is too large for efficient chemical synthesis. Consequently, we tried to both remove and shorten the structural P4 stem because this approach had been shown to work for a genomic δ ribozyme (18Fauzi H. Chiba A. Nishikawa F. Kawakami J. Roy M. Nishikawa S. Anal. Chim. Acta. 1998; 365: 309-317Crossref Scopus (6) Google Scholar). All mutants tested did not work, indicating that this was not a viable approach. 2L. Bergeron and J. P. Perreault, unpublished data. Consequently, we designed a two-piece ribozyme (19Ananvoranich S. Fiola K. Ouellet J. Deschênes P. Perreault J.P. Methods Enzymol. 2001; 341: 553-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). This two-piece version required a higher concentration of magnesium (22 mm as compared with 2–3 mm for the 1 piece) to obtain the same half-maximal velocity (16Mercure S. Lafontaine D. Ananvoranich S. Perreault J.P. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 16975-16982Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) (this has been observed with other two-pieces δ ribozymes; see Ref. 20Sakamoto T.

Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 730-740Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). These versions of the ribozyme may fold differently than their one-piece counterpart and are, therefore, not appropriate for this study. In this work, we use an RNA-DNA mixed ribozyme with P2 and P4 stems, which surround the catalytic center, composed exclusively of deoxyribonucleotides except for one base pair in each stem. Because this RNA-DNA mixed ribozyme has kinetic parameters virtually identical to those of the all-RNA version, we used this new tool to identify all 2′-OHs important in supporting the cleavage activity of the trans-acting δ ribozyme. The chemical synthesis of ribozymes, substrates, and analogue was performed using 2′-ACE chemistry (Dharmacon Research Inc., Lafayette, Colorado). The resulting polymers were deprotected according to the manufacturer's recommended protocol and purified by denaturing in 10 or 20% PAGE (19:1 ratio of acrylamide to bisacrylamide) using 45 mm Tris borate, pH 7.5, 7 m urea, and 1 mm EDTA solution as buffer. The products were visualized by UV-shadowing, and the bands corresponding to the correct sizes were cut out. The nucleic acid were then eluted from these gel slices by incubating overnight at room temperature in a solution containing 0.1% SDS and 0.5 m ammonium acetate. The RNA and RNA-DNA mixed polymers were then precipitated by the addition of 0.1 volume of 3m sodium acetate, pH 5.2, and 2.2 volumes of ethanol, and their quantity was determined by spectrophotometry at 260 nm after dissolving in water. Purified RNA and RNA-DNA mixed polymers (5 pmol) were 5′-end-labeled in a final volume of 10 μl containing 3.2 pmol of [γ-32P]ATP (6000 Ci/mmol; PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and 6 units of T4 polynucleotide kinase, as recommended by the enzyme manufacturer (Amersham Biosciences), at 37 °C for 45 min and then purified on 10 or 20% PAGE gels and recovered as described above. The length and position of the deoxyribonucleotides in the RNA-DNA polymers were verified by alkaline hydrolysis and ribonuclease T1 digestion (RNase T1, which digests Gp↓N linkages in single-stranded RNA) digestion. In the enzymatic digestion, trace amounts of the 5′-end-labeled polymers (<1 nm, ∼ 50 000 cpm) were dissolved in 4 μl of buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, and 100 mm NH4Cl. The mixtures were incubated for 0.5 min at 37 °C in the presence of 5 units of RNase T1 (Amersham Biosciences) and then quenched by adding 5 μl of loading buffer (97% formamide, 1 mm EDTA, 0.05% xylene cyanol). For alkaline hydrolysis, the 5′-end-labeled polymers (∼50,000 cpm) were resuspended in 4 μl of water and 1 μl of 2n NaOH was added. The reaction was incubated at room temperature for 5 min and then quenched by the addition of 8 μl of 500 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and 5 μl of loading buffer. The resulting mixtures were separated on denaturating 10% PAGE gels and visualized by exposure of the gels to phosphorimaging screens. Various concentrations of ribozymes mixed with trace amounts of 5′-end-labeled substrate (< 1 nm) were resuspended in 32 μl of ultrapure water, heated at 90 °C for 2 min, and snap-cooled on ice for 2 min. The volume was then made up to 36 μl by adding 500 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, to a final concentration of 50 mm. The mixtures were then preincubated at 37 °C for 5 min before the addition of MgCl2 to 10 mm(final concentration), thereby initiating the reaction. The reactions were incubated at 37 °C and followed for either 2 or 24 h. Aliquots (4 μl) were periodically removed and quenched by the addition of 8 μl of stop solution (97% formamide, 10 mmEDTA, 0.05% bromphenol blue, and 0.05% xylene cyanol). The resulting samples were fractionated by denaturing 20% PAGE. Both the 11-nt substrate and 4-nt product bands were detected using a Molecular Dynamic PhosphorImager after exposure of the gels to phosphorimaging screens. The screens were scanned and analyzed to determine percentage of cleavage using ImageQuant, version 5.0 (Molecular Dynamics). Kinetic analyses were performed under single turnover conditions as described previously (16Mercure S. Lafontaine D. Ananvoranich S. Perreault J.P. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 16975-16982Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 22Hertel K.J. Herschlag D. Uhlenbeck O.C. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3751-3757Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Briefly, trace amounts of 5′-end-labeled substrate (< 1 nm) were cleaved by various ribozyme concentrations (5–300 nm). The fractions cleaved were determined, and the rate of cleavage (k obs) was obtained by fitting the data to the equation A t = A ∞(1 − e −kt ), where A t is the percentage of cleavage at time t,A ∞ is the maximum percent cleavage (or the end point of cleavage), and k is the rate constant (k obs). Each rate constant was calculated from at least two independent measurements. The values ofk obs obtained were then plotted as a function of ribozyme concentration to determine the other kinetic constants (k 2, K m ′, andk 2/K m ′). The magnesium dependence for each Rz was studied by incubating the reaction mixtures with various MgCl2 concentrations (1–100 mm) in the presence of an excess of ribozyme (100 nm) over substrate (< 1 nm). The concentrations of magnesium at the half-maximal velocity (K Mg) were determined. To evaluate the formation of the RzS complex, the equilibrium constants (K d ) were determined by electrophoresis mobility shift assay by mixing ribozyme concentrations ranging from 0 to 50 nm with trace amounts of 5′-end-labeled analogue (<1 nm) in 9 μl of ultrapure water. The mixtures were then heated at 95 °C for 2 min and cooled to 37 °C for 5 min before the addition of buffer (to a final concentration of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and 10 mm MgCl2) in a manner analogous to that of the cleavage reaction. The samples were incubated for 1 h at 37 °C, then 2 μl of loading solution (50% glycerol, 0.025% of each bromphenol blue and xylene cyanol) were added, and the resulting mixtures were separated through native 15% PAGE gels (29:1 ratio acrylamide to bisacrylamide) in a buffer containing 45 mmTris borate, pH 7.5, and 10 mm MgCl2. The migrations were performed at 150 V for 5 h at 4 °C. The gels were exposed to phosphorimaging screens that were then scanned and analyzed using ImageQuant software to determine the amounts of bound and free analogue. Each equilibrium constant was calculated from at least two independent experiments. Because the studied version of δ ribozyme can be neither significantly reduced in size nor separated into two smaller RNA strands, the first step of this project was the development of a version of δ ribozyme containing fewer ribonucleotides. The catalytic core of δ ribozyme is surrounded by both the P2 stem and the P4-L4 stem-loop, which were proposed to play solely structural roles (1Wickham G.S. Been M.D. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2002; 59: 112-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Consequently, we postulated that an RNA-DNA version including a P2 stem and a P4-L4 stem-loop composed of deoxyribonucleotides should be active (Fig. 2 A). One base pair in each stem was made of ribonucleotides so as to favor their folding into a typical RNA A-helix rather than into a DNA B-helix (12Egli M. Usman N. Rich A. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 3221-3237Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). To simplify, the RNA-DNA mixed version, which includes 26 deoxyribo- and 31 ribonucleotides, will be referred as the δRNA-DNA-ribozyme (δRD-Rz), whereas the all-ribonucleotide version is referred to as the δRNA-ribozyme (δR-Rz). The presence of deoxyribonucleotides in both the P2 stem and the P4-L4 stem-loop was confirmed by alkaline hydrolysis and RNase T1digestion (see “Experimental Procedures,” data not shown). The ability of both δR- and δRD-Rz to cleave a model substrate, giving rise to products of 4 and 7 nt, was then tested under single turnover conditions. Trace amounts of 5′-end-labeled substrate (<1 nm) were incubated in the presence of an excess of either δR- or δRD-Rz (100 nm), and aliquots were removed at various times (Fig. 2 B). The two ribozymes had almost identical maximal cleavage percentages (end point) of 89 and 85%, respectively. However, the cleavage rate (k obs) of δRD-Rz was 2-fold slower than that of δR-Rz (i.e.0.05 min−1 compared with 0.11 min−1). We performed extensive kinetic analyses to accurately compare the cleavage abilities of δR- and δRD-Rz. Pseudo first-order cleavage rate constants (k 2 and K m ′) were measured in the presence of an excess of ribozyme (5–300 nm) and trace amounts of 5′-end-labeled substrate (<0.1 nm) (Table I). Both thek 2 and K m ′ values of δRD-Rz were 3-fold lower than those of δR-Rz, producing similar apparent second-order rate constants (k 2/K m ′ = 2.1 × 107 min−1m−1).Table IKinetic parameters of δR-Rz, the δRD-Rz, and their dC47 counterpartKinetic parametersδRδR-dC47δRDδRD-dC47 K M ′ (nm)9.1 ± 1.619.4 ± 4.02.8 ± 1.05.0 ± 2.0 k 2(min−1)0.19 ± 0.010.018 ± 0.0010.060 ± 0.0030.010 ± 0.001 k 2/K M ′ (107min−1m−1)2.10.12.10.2 K Mg (mm)3.3 ± 0.81.1 ± 0.33.2 ± 1.31.2 ± 0.1 K d (nm)3.0 ± 0.42.2 ± 0.31.0 ± 0.10.6 ± 0.1 Open table in a new tab The difference in the binding between the substrate and either δRD-Rz or δR-Rz was studied by electrophoresis mobility shift assay performed under conditions similar to those used in the cleavage assays. Trace amounts of 5′-end-labeled SdC4 analogue were incubated at 37 °C with various concentrations of ribozyme, and the mixtures were then analyzed on native polyacrylamide gels. The SdC4 analogue is an 11-nt RNA identical to the substrate except for the presence of a deoxyribose residue at position 4 (i.e. the cleavage site), and therefore, is not cleavable. It has been shown in inhibition experiments that the use of the SdC4-analogue mimics the formation of the P1 stem in the ribozyme-substrate complex (16Mercure S. Lafontaine D. Ananvoranich S. Perreault J.P. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 16975-16982Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The dissociation constant (K d ) decreased 3-fold for δRD-Rz as compared with δR-Rz (1 and 3 nm, respectively; Table I), indicating that some minor differences exist between these two ribozymes. In contrast, both ribozymes had equal values for the Mg2+ concentration at the half-maximal velocity (K Mg = 3.3 and 3.2 mm), showing that the magnesium dependence was similar. Although some differences do exist between them, δR- and δRD-Rz can be considered to catalyze the cleavage of a small substrate with the same efficiency. Before substituting any more deoxyribonucleotides for the remaining ribonucleotides in δRD-Rz, we compared the effect of the substitution for a single ribose in both versions of the ribozyme. Specifically, the ribocytidine at position 47 was replaced by a deoxyribocytidine in both ribozymes. Regardless of the precise cleavage mechanism, this cytidine is crucial in the chemical step of the δ ribozyme catalysis (5Perrotta A.T. Shih I. Been M.D. Science. 1999; 286: 123-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar, 6Nakano S. Chadalavada D.M. Bevilacqua P.C. Science. 2000; 287: 1493-1497Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). Both δR-dC47 and δRD-dC47 exhibited lower cleavage activities than did the versions containing a ribocytidine at position 47. Briefly, the measured kinetic parameters showed that the inclusion of a deoxyribose at position 47 has the same effect on both ribozymes when compared with their respective non-substituted versions (Table I, compare δR-dC47 to δR and δRD-dC47 to δRD). For example, thek 2 values were at least 6-fold less for both dC47 ribozymes, whereas the K m ′ values showed a 2-fold increase in both cases. Consequently, a significant decrease of 20 (δR-dC47)- and 10 (δRD-dC47)-fold in thek 2/K m ′ values were observed, indicating that the 2′-OH of the C47 is critical. More importantly, these results show that the δRD-Rz might be considered as an interesting starting version for further site-specific functional modifications geared toward the elucidation of the molecular mechanism of δ ribozyme. A collection of δRD-Rz including various substitutions of deoxyribonucleotides for ribonucleotides was synthesized. The incorporation of deoxyribonucleotides at the appropriate positions in all of these ribozymes was confirmed by both alkaline hydrolysis and RNase T1 digestion (data not shown). Subsequently, the ability of these ribozymes to cleave a small substrate was determined. The reactions were performed for either 2 or 24 h depending upon the level of activity. The J4/2 junction is the single-stranded region joining the P2 and P4 stems (i.e. positions 47–51). The global substitution of five deoxyriboses for the five riboses led to a ribozyme that catalyzed less than 1% of cleavage even after 24 h of incubation (Fig.3 A, δRD-dJ4/2), suggesting that at least 1 of these 2′-OHs is important for efficient catalysis. To identify the one(s) that is critical, the five ribonucleotides were individually substituted. As revealed in Fig. 3 A, both the δRD-dU48 and -dA49 ribozymes exhibited the same level of activity as δRD-Rz, indicating that the absence of the 2′-OH at these positions did not affect the catalytic activity. The kinetic parameters (K m ′, k 2, andk 2/K m ′) of these two ribozymes were almost identical to those of δRD-Rz (TableII), showing that the introduction of an unique deoxyribose in this single-stranded region did not necessarily alter the cleavage activity. In contrast, both δRD-dC47 and δRD-dA50 exhibited reduced cleavage activity, suggesting that the presence of the 2′-OH at these positions is important for the catalysis (Fig. 3 A). These two ribozymes had virtually identicalK m ′ values but significantly reducedk 2 values (i.e. 6- and 12-fold, respectively) as compared with δRD-Rz (Table II). Finally, the presence of a 2′-H at position 51 (δRD-dG51) led to a minor increase in k 2, whereas K m ′ remained similar to that of δRD-Rz (Table II). Inclusion of a deoxyribonucleotide at the equivalent position in the bimolecular system also resulted in an improved cleavage activity (19Ananvoranich S. Fiola K. Ouellet J. Deschênes P. Perreault J.P. Methods Enzymol. 2001; 341: 553-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). Most likely, δRD-dG51 adopts a conformation that slightly enhances the folding pathway that occurs before the chemical step.Table IIKinetic parameters of various substituted δRD-RzδRD-Rz K M ′ k 2 k 2/K M ′ nm min −1 10 7 min −1 m −1δRD2.8 ± 1.00.060 ± 0.0032.1dJ4/2NDNDNDdC475.0 ± 2.00.010 ± 0.0010.2dU481.6 ± 0.10.030 ± 0.0011.9dA491.6 ± 1.00.023 ± 0.0011.4dA501.2 ± 0.60.005 ± 0.0010.4dG512.9 ± 0.50.17 ± 0.015.9dC6-dG521.2 ± 0.60.032 ± 0.0022.7dP3NDNDNDdC8dG18dC9dG17NDNDNDdA76.8 ± 1.20.030 ± 0.0010.4dC82.8 ± 1.70.008 ± 0.0010.3dC98.2 ± 4.40.010 ± 0.0010.1dG17NDNDNDdG182.0 ± 0.50.014 ± 0.0010.7dU191.1 ± 0.60.011 ± 0.0011.0dU101.0 ± 0.50.007 ± 0.0010.7dU133.1 ± 1.40.017 ± 0.0010.5dC142.7 ± 1.40.023 ± 0.0020.9dG153.6 ± 0.90.074 ± 0.0022.1dC162.2 ± 0.40.049 ± 0.0012.2dP1.12.8 ± 1.10.045 ± 0.0031.6dG29-dG46NDNDNDdG46NDNDNDdG291.9 ± 1.60.017 ± 0.0010.9ND, not determined. Open table in a new tab ND, not determined. To preserve the A-helix conformation of the all-DNA P2 stem within δRD-Rz, the C6-G52 base pair at the bottom of this stem was kept as RNA (Fig. 2 A). The importance of the 2′-OHs at these two positions was evaluated by designing the δRD-dC6dG52 ribozyme. This ribozyme exhibited a cleavage activity similar to that of δRD-Rz (Fig. 3 A). Both thek 2 and K m ′ values decreased 2-fold, yielding similar values fork 2/K m ′ (Table II) and demonstrating that the 2′-OH at positions 6 and 52 are not important for the catalysis. Because both the P2 and P3 stems were shown to stack together (3Ferre-D'Amare A.R. Zhou K. Doudna J.A. Nature. 1998; 395: 567-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (680) Google Scholar), we believe that the presence of an RNA P3 stem was sufficient to ensure that the P2 stem folds into an A-helix conformation. When the P3 stem was composed of either two or three deoxyribonucleotide base pairs, no cleavage was detected, even after an extensive incubation of 24 h (δRD-dP3 and δRD-dC8dG18dC9dG17; Fig. 3 B). Subsequent minimal substitutions, such as the presence of a deoxyribose at either position 7 or 8 on one strand (i.e. δRD-dA7 and -dC8), gave ribozymes that exhibited a lower level of cleavage activity characterized by a reduction of 5- and 7-fold, respectively, in theirk 2/K m ′ value as compared with δRD-Rz (Fig. 3 B, Table II). An initial examination ofpanel B in Fig. 3 suggests that the level of cleavage of δRD-dA7 is not significantly reduced. However, the reduction in itsk 2/K m ′ value is largely due to the 3-fold increase of its K m ′, which was not detected during the preliminary activity experiments because they were performed with a large excess of ribozyme. A more significant alteration of the catalytic activity was observed with the δRD-dC9 ribozyme. In this case, a 20-fold decrease in thek 2/K m ′ value, due to aK m ′ value 3-fold higher and ak 2 value 6-fold lower as compared with δRD-Rz, was observed. On the other strand, the presence of a deoxyribose at position 17 causes a dramatic decrease in the cleavage level (δRD-dG17, Fig. 3 B). After 24 h of incubation, the percentage of cleavage was less than 5%, and ak obs of 0.0021 min−1, which is 25-fold slower than δRD-Rz (i.e. 0.05 min−1), was estimated in the presence of a ribozyme concentration of 100 nm. No other kinetic parameters could be determined because the activity was too low. Substitution of the adjacent ribose (i.e. δRD-dG18) also yields a lower cleavage activity than δRD-Rz although to a lower degree. In this case thek 2/K m ′ value was 0.7 × 107 min−1m−1, which is 3-fold less than δRD-Rz. Finally, the incorporation of a deoxyribose at position 19 (i.e. δRD-dU19) gave a ribozyme that exhibited almost the same level of activity as δRD-Rz (Fig. 3 B, Table II). The slight reduction in the activity observed with this mutant was probably due to the instability caused by the presence of a RNA-DNA heteroduplex base pair and is, therefore, not indicative of an important 2′-OH group. With the exception of the 2′-OH of U19, all 2′-OHs of the P3 stem are important in the cleavage activity, albeit to different degrees. This 7-nt loop is located in the middle of the catalytic core. Because the cytosines at positions 11 and 12 are involved in the formation of the P1.1 pseudoknot, the 2′-OHs of these residues were analyzed separately (see below). Five δRD-Rzs, each possessing one additional deoxyribose residue, were synthesized (Fig. 3 C, Table II). The δRD-dG15 and -dC16 ribozymes exhibited the same level of cleavage and had kinetic parameters virtually identical to δRD-Rz, whereas δRD-dC14 showed a (probably) insignificant minimal decrease. Both the δRD-dU10 and -dU13 ribozymes exhibited less cleavage activity due to a significant decrease in theirk 2 values as compared with that of δRD-Rz (i.e. 9- and 4-fold, respectively). Thus, the 2′-OH group of the residues at positions 10 and 13 in the L3 loop contribute to efficient catalysis. The P1.1 pseudoknot is composed of two base pairs (i.e. C11G28/C12G27). The δRD-dP1.1 ribozyme, which includes deoxyribonucleotides at all four positions, exhibited the same level of"
