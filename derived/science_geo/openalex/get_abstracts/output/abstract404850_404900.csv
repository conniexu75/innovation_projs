https://openalex.org/W2129375080,"Cancer cells within individual tumors often exist in distinct phenotypic states that differ in functional attributes. While cancer cell populations typically display distinctive equilibria in the proportion of cells in various states, the mechanisms by which this occurs are poorly understood. Here, we study the dynamics of phenotypic proportions in human breast cancer cell lines. We show that subpopulations of cells purified for a given phenotypic state return towards equilibrium proportions over time. These observations can be explained by a Markov model in which cells transition stochastically between states. A prediction of this model is that, given certain conditions, any subpopulation of cells will return to equilibrium phenotypic proportions over time. A second prediction is that breast cancer stem-like cells arise de novo from non-stem-like cells. These findings contribute to our understanding of cancer heterogeneity and reveal how stochasticity in single-cell behaviors promotes phenotypic equilibrium in populations of cancer cells.

In unicellular organisms, cell-state changes occur in response to environmental stressors or nutrient changes. Direct sensing of environmental stimuli often involves stochastic cell-fate decisions, modulated by random noise in gene expression (Süel et al., 2006Süel G.M. Garcia-Ojalvo J. Liberman L.M.

Such probabilistic behavior has been shown to be advantageous in certain environmental conditions (Kussell and Leibler, 2005Kussell E. Leibler S.

Noisy gene-expression levels can also stochastically influence cell-state decisions in eukaryotes (Di Talia et al., 2007Di Talia S. Skotheim J.M. Bean J.M. Siggia E.D. Cross F.R. The effects of molecular noise and size control on variability in the budding yeast cell cycle.Nature. 2007; 448: 947-951Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). However, less is known about the role that stochasticity might play in regulating cell-state equilibria in populations of cells. Cell-state dynamics are of particular significance in tumor pathobiology. Even within individual tumors, cancer cells frequently exist in any of several possible phenotypic states. Cancer cells in distinct phenotypic states often exhibit important differences in functional properties. For example, subpopulations of stem-like cancer cells with increased tumor-seeding ability and drug resistance have been identified in a variety of tumor types (Al-Hajj et al., 2003Al-Hajj M.

The proportion of cancer cells in the various states is related to both tumor type and grade (Chiou et al., 2008Chiou S.H. Yu C.C. Huang C.Y. Lin S.C. Liu C.J. Tsai T.H. Chou S.H. Chien C.S. Ku H.H.

Additionally, because anticancer therapies preferentially kill specific cancer cell states, treatment can result in selective changes in phenotypic proportions within tumors (Creighton et al., 2009Creighton C.J.

Understanding how cancer cell states coexist and evolve within tumors is of fundamental interest and could facilitate the development of more effective therapies. Phenotypic equilibrium in cell-state proportions is observed in vivo and in cell lines adapted to in vitro culture. Under fixed conditions, both normal and cancerous epithelial lines display stable proportions of cells in stem-like, basal, or luminal states during propagation in culture. The mechanisms that stabilize phenotypic proportions within cellular populations remain unclear. Two general classes of mechanisms can be envisioned: (1) in the absence of interconversion between states, equilibrium proportions could be maintained through intercellular signals that modulate the proliferation rates of distinct states and (2) proliferation rates remain equal, but cancer cells could interconvert between different states in a manner that maintains equilibrium cell-state proportions. Here, we study the mechanisms that underlie phenotypic diversity in populations of cancer cells. We develop and validate a quantitative Markov model of phenotypic transitions that predicts evolution toward equilibrium proportions in cancer cell populations. The Markov model makes several unanticipated predictions about cell-state transitions and dynamics in cancer cell populations. In addition, the proposed model is useful in characterizing the effects of genetic and chemical perturbations on phenotypic proportions in cancer cell populations. To study cell-state dynamics in cancer cells, we used fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) to isolate three mammary epithelial cell states that have been previously defined and characterized using cell-surface markers: stem-like (CD44hiCD24negEpCAMlo), basal (CD44hiCD24negEpCAMneg), and luminal (CD44loCD24hiEpCAMhi) (Fillmore and Kuperwasser, 2008Fillmore C.M.

Using this system, we isolated each of these cellular fractions from two human breast cancer lines derived from primary tumors (SUM159 and SUM149), resulting in subpopulations that exhibited significant differences in morphology in culture (Figures 1A and 1B ). To confirm that these markers indeed define cells in the expected cell-differentiation states, we collected global gene expression data from sorted CD44hiCD24negEpCAMlo (stem-like), CD44hiCD24negEpCAMneg (basal), or CD44loCD24hiEpCAMhi (luminal) subpopulations of the SUM149 and SUM159 breast cancer lines. We next applied gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) (Mootha et al., 2003Mootha V.K. Lindgren C.M. Eriksson K.F. Subramanian A. Sihag S. Lehar J. Puigserver P. Carlsson E. Ridderstråle M.

We observed that in both the SUM159 and SUM149 lines, the expression of genes associated with luminal differentiation was indeed enriched in the CD44loCD24hiEpCAMhi subpopulation (Figures 1C ans 1D and Table S1). For example, the luminal markers CD24, claudin 1 (CLDN1), and cytokeratins 6B and 8 were all specifically upregulated in CD44loCD24hiEpCAMhi cells (Figure 1C and Table S1). Similarly, we found a significant enrichment in the expression of genes associated with basal differentiation in the CD44hiCD24negEpCAMneg subpopulation (Figures 1C and 1D and Table S1); these genes included vimentin (VIM), Zeb1 (TCF8), membrane metallo-endopeptidase (CALLA/CD10), decorin (DCN), and plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1 (SERPINE2). Genes implicated in the self-renewal of embryonic stem cells, including EZH2, KLF5, KLF4, and SOX9 (Brambrink et al., 2008Brambrink T. Foreman R. Welstead G.G. Lengner C.J. Wernig M. Suh H.

The expression levels of genes associated with basal differentiation in the CD44hiCD24negEpCAMneg fraction was further confirmed via quantitative RT-PCR. Consistent with the microarray data, we observed that CD44hiCD24negEpCAMneg cells from SUM149 and SUM159 populations expressed elevated levels of Vimentin, N-cadherin, and Zeb1 compared to unsorted cells (Figure 1E). In contrast, CD44loCD24hiEpCAMhi cells, which are in a luminal state, exhibited a reduction in the expression levels of these basal genes and elevated levels of the luminal epithelial marker, E-cadherin (Figure 1E). Collectively, these data indicated that, as previously reported, the cell-surface expression of CD24, CD44, and EpCAM does indeed allow for an accurate fractionation of cells in distinct differentiation states. We next determined the proportions of the individual cell-states in the SUM159 and SUM149 lines and found that they contained distinct cell-state proportions: SUM159 populations exhibited predominantly basal (B) differentiation with minority subpopulations that were stem-like (S) or luminal (L) (proportion of B, S, and L = 97.3%, 1.9%, and 0.62%, respectively; Figure 2B ); in contrast, SUM149 populations exhibited predominantly luminal differentiation with stem-like and basal minority subpopulations (B, S, and L = 3.3%, 3.9%, and 92.8%, respectively; Figure 2B). Using FACS, we sorted stem-like, basal, or luminal cells from the SUM159 and SUM149 lines (resulting in subpopulations that were at least 96% pure based on reanalysis immediately after sorting). By isolating relatively pure subpopulations of cells in a given differentiation state and allowing them to expand in culture, we could monitor how cell-state dynamics evolve over time (Figure 2A). After 6 days of growth in culture, we assessed the proportions of stem-like, basal, and luminal cells (Figure 2C). For each isolated subpopulation, we observed a rapid progression toward equilibrium proportions (Figure 2C). Two lines of evidence indicated that this progression was not due to differential growth rates of cells in the basal, stem-like, or luminal states but rather to interconversion between states. First, we observed no difference in the proliferation rates of the stem-like, basal, or luminal subpopulations sorted from either SUM159 or SUM149 (Figure S1). Second, given the purity of the sorted populations and the rapid rate of return to equilibrium proportions, some minority subpopulations would need to divide more than three times per day to achieve the observed proportions through differential growth alone. Such a high proliferation rate is implausible because even the most rapidly dividing human cells—embryonic stem cells—require at least 24 hr to complete a proliferation cycle (Cowan et al., 2004Cowan C.A. Klimanskaya I. McMahon J. Atienza J. Witmyer J. Zucker J.P. Wang S. Morton C.C. McMahon A.P. Powers D. Melton D.A. Derivation of embryonic stem-cell lines from human blastocysts.N. Engl. J. Med. 2004; 350: 1353-1356Crossref PubMed Scopus (796) Google Scholar). Given that interconversion between cell states was occurring, we modeled these observations as a stochastic process in which cancer cells transition randomly between states with each proliferative cycle. We additionally made the assumption that cell transitions follow a Markov process—that is, transition probabilities depend only on a cell's current state, not on its prior states (see the Experimental Procedures). Under a Markov model, it is possible to use data from short-term cell culture of isolated subpopulations to infer the probabilities of transition between any two cell states (for example, PB→S denotes the probability per generation of a basal cell transitioning into a stem-like state). By revealing whether certain transitions are allowed or forbidden, these inferred probabilities could, in principle, provide significant insights into the cell-state dynamics in cell lines. The transition probabilities for the SUM159 and SUM149 lines inferred from the experiment above (Figure 2D and Table 1) revealed several interesting similarities and distinctions between the cell lines:(1)For both lines, we found that stem-like cells could either self-renew or transition into either of the basal or luminal states (Figure 2D and Table 1). While the self-renewal probabilities are comparable (PS→S = 0.58, 0.61), stem-like cells were more likely to transition into a luminal state in the SUM149 line (PS→L = 0.30, PS→B = 0.09), but into a basal state in the SUM159 line (PS→L = 0.07, PS→B = 0.35).(2)In both cell lines, basal cells exhibited a high probability of self-renewing divisions (PB→B = 0.99, 0.90). In contrast, the behavior of luminal cells differed strongly between the cell lines. Luminal cells in the SUM149 line displayed a high probability of self-renewal (PL→L = 0.99), while luminal cells in the SUM159 line exhibited roughly equal probabilities of either remaining in the luminal state or transitioning to basal state (PL→L = 0.47; PL→B = 0.49). These distinctions help explain the higher proportion of basal cells observed at equilibrium in the SUM159 line relative to the SUM149 line.Table 1Cell-State Transition Probabilities for Control or TBX3-Inhibited Human Breast Cancer CellsControlshTBX3Transition ProbabilitiesSBLSBLSUM159Stem0.580.350.070.500.490.01Basal0.010.990.000.010.990.00Luminal0.040.490.470.060.160.78SUM149Stem0.610.090.300.630.070.30Basal0.010.900.080.020.860.12Luminal0.010.000.990.010.000.99S, B and L correspond to stem-like, basal, and luminal states, respectively.

Open table in a new tab S, B and L correspond to stem-like, basal, and luminal states, respectively. The rows and columns correspond to initial (pretransition) and final (posttransition) states, respectively. Transition probabilities are shown per cell division. The inferred Markov transition probabilities make it possible to quantitatively predict how a population of cells evolves over time given the initial proportion of cell states. Examples are shown in Figure 3 for several initial cell state proportions of SUM159 populations. The model makes several unanticipated predictions. First, even though a subpopulation of sorted stem-like cells from SUM159 has a low proportion of luminal cells both immediately after sorting and at 6 days postsort (0.6%), the model predicts that the proportion of luminal cells will actually show a sharp transient rise to ∼7.3% at 1 day postsort (arrow in Figure 3). We tested this prediction and indeed observed an increase in the proportion of luminal cells (to 6.5%) at 1 day postsort. This unexpected prediction could not have been made without a quantitative model of the underlying cell-state dynamics. A second striking prediction of the model is that basal and luminal cells have a non-zero probability of transitioning to a stem-like state—that is, that cancer stem-like cells can arise from non-stem-like cells. This notion stands in stark contrast to the classical understanding of the concept of “stem cells” in normal tissues, which posits the existence of a rigid lineage-hierarchy in which stem cells can give rise to nonstem cells but not vice versa. To test this prediction, we evaluated the ability of sorted SUM159 subpopulations to seed tumors in mice, either after their initial isolation or after propagation in culture. Consistent with previous observations, the stem-like fraction could efficiently seed tumors, but neither the luminal nor basal fraction was capable of doing so (Table 2). The lack of tumor-seeding potential of luminal and basal subpopulations could be due to either an inherent inability to give rise to cancer stem cells (CSCs) in vivo or simply an inability to survive long enough at the site of implantation to do so. We speculated that admixture with irradiated carrier cells could allow sorted subpopulations to survive longer in vivo following injection, as has been previously shown in the context of hematopoietic reconstitution (Bonnet et al., 1999Bonnet D. Bhatia M. Wang J.C. Kapp U. Dick J.E.

Here, we provide a comprehensive analysis of the human mitochondrial transcriptome across multiple cell lines and tissues. Using directional deep sequencing and parallel analysis of RNA ends, we demonstrate wide variation in mitochondrial transcript abundance and precisely resolve transcript processing and maturation events. We identify previously undescribed transcripts, including small RNAs, and observe the enrichment of several nuclear RNAs in mitochondria. Using high-throughput in vivo DNaseI footprinting, we establish the global profile of DNA-binding protein occupancy across the mitochondrial genome at single-nucleotide resolution, revealing regulatory features at mitochondrial transcription initiation sites and functional insights into disease-associated variants. This integrated analysis of the mitochondrial transcriptome reveals unexpected complexity in the regulation, expression, and processing of mitochondrial RNA and provides a resource for future studies of mitochondrial function (accessed at http://mitochondria.matticklab.com)."
https://openalex.org/W1983006621,"People with mutations in ATGL, a gene involved in lipid catabolism, suffer from neutral lipid storage disease and often from cardiomyopathy. Rudolf Zechner and his colleagues now show in mice that Atgl activity in cardiac muscle produces key lipid ligands for PPAR-α, a transcription factor that regulates proper lipid metabolism and fuel burning in this tissue. These results may explain the mechanisms responsible for the cardiomyopathy and offer a potential target for treatment. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) are nuclear hormone receptors that regulate genes involved in energy metabolism and inflammation. For biological activity, PPARs require cognate lipid ligands, heterodimerization with retinoic X receptors, and coactivation by PPAR-γ coactivator-1α or PPAR-γ coactivator-1β (PGC-1α or PGC-1β, encoded by Ppargc1a and Ppargc1b, respectively). Here we show that lipolysis of cellular triglycerides by adipose triglyceride lipase (patatin-like phospholipase domain containing protein 2, encoded by Pnpla2; hereafter referred to as Atgl) generates essential mediator(s) involved in the generation of lipid ligands for PPAR activation. Atgl deficiency in mice decreases mRNA levels of PPAR-α and PPAR-δ target genes. In the heart, this leads to decreased PGC-1α and PGC-1β expression and severely disrupted mitochondrial substrate oxidation and respiration; this is followed by excessive lipid accumulation, cardiac insufficiency and lethal cardiomyopathy. Reconstituting normal PPAR target gene expression by pharmacological treatment of Atgl-deficient mice with PPAR-α agonists completely reverses the mitochondrial defects, restores normal heart function and prevents premature death. These findings reveal a potential treatment for the excessive cardiac lipid accumulation and often-lethal cardiomyopathy in people with neutral lipid storage disease, a disease marked by reduced or absent ATGL activity."

From this emerged the concept of the “tripartite synapse,” which proposes that glial cells are functional components of synapses (Araque et al., 1999Araque A. Parpura V. Sanzgiri R.P. Haydon P.G. Tripartite synapses: glia, the unacknowledged partner.Trends Neurosci. 1999; 22: 208-215Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1583) Google Scholar). In addition to intense and sustained network activity, neuronal communication also occurs at low rates at individual synapses. In fact, the release of neurotransmitters induced by single action potentials, known as basal synaptic transmission, is fundamental for information processing in the CNS. Astrocytes are ideally positioned to detect and modulate this type of activity because they extend processes that are in apposition with pre- and postsynaptic neuronal elements of synapses (Ventura and Harris, 1999Ventura R. Harris K.M. Three-dimensional relationships between hippocampal synapses and astrocytes.J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 6897-6906Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, Witcher et al., 2007Witcher M.R. Kirov S.A.

It has been shown that astrocytes have intricate spongiform morphology with stubby main processes and dense ramifications with irregular shape (Bushong et al., 2002Bushong E.A. Martone M.E.

Despite this ideal position, the detection and modulation mechanisms in astrocytes are deemed too slow to be involved in local modulation of rapid, basal synaptic transmission. Indeed, although Ca2+ activities have been reported in glial processes (Nett et al., 2002Nett W.J. Oloff S.H. McCarthy K.D.

Neurosci. 2006; 9: 816-823Crossref PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar), Ca2+ signaling has been generally studied globally in the whole astrocyte, where the slow timescale of Ca2+ changes precludes any spatial and temporal match with fast and localized synaptic transmission. Moreover, trains of sustained stimulation of afferents were necessary to induce this type of glial Ca2+ activity. Thus, it remains unknown whether astrocytes can detect single evoked synaptic events and respond by modulating basal transmission. We addressed this issue by adapting for the study of neuron-glia interactions, imaging and electrophysiological techniques routinely used to study basal synaptic activity on dendritic spines. We show that astrocytes detect synaptic activity induced by single-synaptic stimulation in functional compartments along their processes. Following their activation via metabotropic glutamate subtype 5 receptors (mGluR5) during basal synaptic transmission, astrocytes increase the efficiency of transmission in CA1 pyramidal cells through activation of presynaptic adenosine A2A receptors. These data suggest that astrocytes are directly involved with neurons in regulating elementary aspects of synaptic transmission. For astrocytes to participate in basal synaptic activity, a prerequisite is that Ca2+ signaling occurs locally along their processes. This was tested by monitoring spontaneous Ca2+ signals in astrocytes of CA1 stratum radiatum of acute hippocampal slices. Whole-cell patch-clamp recordings were performed to identify astrocytes and specifically introduce different compounds in these cells. All experiments were done on astrocytes (1) with a small cell body (diameter 8.3 ± 0.2 μm; n = 25 cells), (2) that are part of a network (neighboring somata in Figures 1Aa, 1C, and 1D ), and (3) that have a low resting input resistance (14.7 ± 0.9 MΩ, n = 40 cells), a linear current-voltage relationship, and no action potential spiking behavior (Figure 1Ab). As reported previously (Bushong et al., 2002Bushong E.A. Martone M.E. Jones Y.Z. Ellisman M.H. Protoplasmic astrocytes in CA1 stratum radiatum occupy separate anatomical domains.J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 183-192Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, Bushong et al., 2004Bushong E.A. Martone M.E. Ellisman M.H.

Tri-dimensional morphometric analysis of astrocytic processes with high voltage electron microscopy of thick Golgi preparations.J. Neurocytol. 2004; 33: 277-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), we observed with confocal or two-photon microscopy that astrocytes loaded with Alexa Fluor 594 exhibited intricate spongiform morphology, dense process ramifications of irregular shape with frequent small broadenings (Figure 1). These enlargements (1.4 ± 0.04 μm; n = 136, 58 cells; Figure 1) measured along the main axis of the astrocytic process will be referred to as astrocytic compartments. Characteristics of Ca2+ transients in these compartments were studied using fast confocal Ca2+ imaging in line-scan mode along a small segment of an astrocytic process (5–20 μm; Figures 1A and 1B). Spontaneous Ca2+ responses were observed in compartments (Figures 1Ac and 1B) with an amplitude of ΔF/F = 92.2% ± 9.3% and a rise time of 277.7 ± 38.8 ms (n = 66 events in 35 compartments, 23 cells). These data are consistent with previous observations of spontaneous Ca2+ responses in astrocytic processes (Nett et al., 2002Nett W.J. Oloff S.H. McCarthy K.D.

Neurosci. 2006; 9: 816-823Crossref PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar) and reveal the rapid kinetics of Ca2+ transients in small compartments along astrocytic processes. We next tested whether local Ca2+ responses could be elicited in these compartments by synaptic activity evoked locally by single-synaptic stimulation. As shown in Figure 2A , single pulse stimulation of neuronal presynaptic elements evoked local Ca2+ events in an astrocytic process. Their amplitude was 128% ± 20.2% ΔF/F with a rise time of 217.5 ± 37.0 ms (n = 42 Ca2+ events in 14 compartments, 12 cells). The amplitude and rise time of evoked glial Ca2+ responses were not significantly different from the spontaneous ones (Mann Whitney test; p > 0.05). In addition, amplitude distribution of evoked glial Ca2+ responses was not different from that of spontaneous responses (chi-square test; p = 0.17; Figure 2B), suggesting that both populations of Ca2+ responses occur via similar mechanisms. To confirm the synaptic origin of evoked glial Ca2+ signals, we used tetrodotoxin (TTX) to prevent nerve-impulse propagation via the blockade of voltage-gated Na+ channels. TTX (1 μM) completely blocked glial Ca2+ responses (Figure 2C; n = 5 compartments, 5 cells), indicating that they were not caused by direct stimulation of the astrocytic process or by mechanical perturbation. Simultaneous recordings of astrocytes and pyramidal neurons were performed next to confirm that evoked Ca2+ responses in compartments of astrocytic processes correlated with basal synaptic activity. Minimal synaptic stimulation that activates putative single presynaptic fibers (Raastad et al., 1992Raastad M. Storm J.F. Andersen P. Putative Single Quantum and Single Fibre Excitatory Postsynaptic Currents Show Similar Amplitude Range and Variability in Rat Hippocampal Slices.Eur. J. Neurosci. 1992; 4: 113-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar) induced a rapid and local Ca2+ event in the glial compartment simultaneously with excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) (Figure 2D; n = 5 pairs). Interestingly, the absence of fluorescent changes outside of the boundaries of the compartment suggests that the Ca2+ event is compartmentalized. These results indicate that astrocytes detect small levels of neurotransmitter released locally, simultaneously with its detection by the postsynaptic neuron. This conclusion was further supported when comparing the probabilistic nature of synaptically evoked local Ca2+ responses in astrocytes and EPSCs. Indeed, Ca2+ responses could be elicited repetitively in the same glial compartment, and similar to the synaptic currents, stimulation-evoked local glial Ca2+ responses showed failures (Figure 2E). The failure rate was 60.1% ± 8% for Ca2+ responses (n = 6) and 51% ± 6% for synaptic currents. Notably, Ca2+ response failure rate was never smaller than that of synaptic current. This is consistent with the nature of synaptic responses evoked by minimal stimulation whereby more than one synapse may be activated while only one glial compartment was studied. Furthermore, increasing the stimulus intensity decreased both the failure rate of synaptic currents and glial Ca2+ responses up to a point that failures were no longer observed. In these conditions, it was possible to evoke Ca2+ responses without failures with stimulation intervals of 30 s (data not shown). The occurrence of local Ca2+ responses elicited by single synaptic stimulation implies that a discrete functional organization was present along the glial process. First, we determined whether astrocytic compartments were in close morphological relationship with the postsynaptic site of glutamate synapses, dendritic spines (Ventura and Harris, 1999Ventura R. Harris K.M. Three-dimensional relationships between hippocampal synapses and astrocytes.J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 6897-6906Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, Witcher et al., 2007Witcher M.R. Kirov S.A. Harris K.M. Plasticity of perisynaptic astroglia during synaptogenesis in the mature rat hippocampus.Glia. 2007; 55: 13-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). As shown in Figures 3A and 3B , small compartments of an astrocytic process identified after deconvolution and reconstruction were 1.5 ± 0.1 μm in length (n = 11 compartments of 5 astrocytes in 5 experiments). This is not statistically different from those observed with labeling experiments during whole-cell recording and Ca2+ imaging (Student's unpaired t test; p > 0.05). More importantly, these compartments were found in close apposition with dendritic spines. These results suggest that compartments along astrocytic processes that show local and discrete Ca2+ activity are associated with postsynaptic elements of glutamate synapses. Second, we investigated whether glutamate receptors were functionally segregated along the astrocytic process. We tested whether release of glutamate at discrete locations along an astrocytic process elicited Ca2+ responses using local two-photon activation of the caged-glutamate compound MNI-glutamate (Carter and Sabatini, 2004Carter A.G. Sabatini B.L. State-dependent calcium signaling in dendritic spines of striatal medium spiny neurons.Neuron. 2004; 44: 483-493Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar, Smith et al., 2003Smith M.A. Ellis-Davies G.C.R. Magee J.C. Mechanism of the distance-dependent scaling of Schaffer collateral synapses in rat CA1 pyramidal neurons.J. Physiol. 2003; 548: 245-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). As predicted, photoactivation at specific and restricted areas adjacent to astrocytic compartments elicited Ca2+ responses at many locations (n = 19 evoked events on 36 trials onto 16 compartments, 9 cells; Figure 3C). Their amplitude was 84.9% ± 11.8% ΔF/F, with a rise time of 226 ms ± 52 ms, values that are not significantly different than those of spontaneous and synaptically evoked Ca2+ responses (one-way ANOVA, corrected with Dunn's multiple comparison test; p > 0.05). Furthermore, their amplitude distribution was similar to those of spontaneous and stimulation-evoked responses (Figure 3D; chi-square test, p = 0.17). This suggests that Ca2+ responses elicited by local photoactivation of MNI-glutamate are representative of those evoked by endogenous synaptic activity. These data indicate that functional glutamate receptors are segregated at discrete locations on compartments along astrocytic processes. We next tested whether astrocytes regulate the basal level of synaptic activity as a consequence of their detection of local neurotransmitter release. We used the Ca2+ chelator BAPTA to block selectively the rise of Ca2+ in astrocytes, a strategy that is known to prevent Ca2+-dependent glial modulation of synaptic transmission (Serrano et al., 2006Serrano A. Haddjeri N. Lacaille J.-C. Robitaille R. GABAergic network activation of glial cells underlies hippocampal heterosynaptic depression.J. Neurosci. 2006; 26: 5370-5382Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). A pyramidal neuron was recorded in whole-cell configuration, and a neighboring astrocyte was contacted with a patch electrode containing BAPTA (10 mM) to form a cell-attached configuration, keeping the membrane intact to prevent BAPTA diffusion in the cell. EPSCs were evoked by minimal stimulation, and after 10 min of recordings of basal synaptic transmission, the membrane of the astrocyte was ruptured to establish whole-cell configuration and BAPTA diffusion into the astrocyte while EPSCs were continuously monitored up to 20 min after astrocyte break-in. The failure rate increased from 43.5% ± 2.2% in control to 91.1% ± 2.1% in BAPTA (Figures 4A and 4C ; n = 6; Student's paired t test; p < 0.05), but the potency of responses (mean EPSC amplitude excluding failures) remained unchanged (−17.9 ± 2.1 pA in control and −13.0 ± 2.2 pA in BAPTA; Student's paired t test; p > 0.05), indicative of a presynaptic regulation of the efficacy of transmission. This effect cannot be due to the experimental procedure because experiments performed in the absence of the chelator in the patch electrode (Figures 4B and 4C) did not alter the failure rate (52.4% ± 13.1% in control to 48.8% ± 10.2% after break-in; p > 0.05) or the potency (−19.1 ± 1.0 pA in control and −21.5 ± 2.7 pA after break-in; p > 0.05). These results suggest that astrocytes regulate basal synaptic transmission in a Ca2+-dependent manner by altering presynaptic activity. We next tested whether subsequent stimuli are being influenced by prior activity. Monitoring changes in failure rate of synaptic responses elicited at 2 s and 10 s intervals revealed that it was unaltered throughout the recording period (Figure 4D). With an interval of 2 s, the initial failure rate went from 43.2% ± 5.6% to 47.8% ± 8.0% at the end of the 8 min recording period (one-way ANOVA with Tukey's multiple comparison test; p > 0.05; n = 6), whereas, at an interval of 10 s, the failure rate was 53.1% ± 6.1% initially and 57.3% ± 7.1% at the end of the recording period (one-way ANOVA with Tukey's multiple comparison test; p > 0.05; n = 8). This suggests that the glial modulation regulates basal synaptic transmission in a tonic fashion, independent of short-term plasticity. We next investigated the type of receptors involved in astrocyte activation by synaptic transmission. Group I metabotropic glutamatergic receptors, in particular mGluR5, are the major subgroup of receptors implicated in the detection of glutamate by astrocytes (Cai et al., 2000Cai Z. Schools G.P.

Araque A. Properties of synaptically evoked astrocyte calcium signal reveal synaptic information processing by astrocytes.J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 2192-2203Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). Hence, we tested whether mGluR5 is implicated in the detection of the synaptic signal. Ca2+ responses were evoked by single-pulse stimulations in control conditions (Figure 5A ; 232.2% ± 39.1% ΔF/F; n = 6 compartments, 6 cells) and in the presence of the mGluR5-selective antagonist 6-methyl-2-(phenylethynyl)-pyridine (MPEP, 25 μM). The presence of MPEP completely abolished local Ca2+ events (Figure 5A; n = 6 compartments, 6 cells). In two of these experiments, the recordings were kept long enough to wash out MPEP and obtain a recovery of evoked Ca2+ responses (Figure 5A; 198.9% ± 36.9% ΔF/F; n = 2 compartments, 2 cells). These results indicate that local Ca2+ responses elicited in compartments of astrocytic processes by single synaptic stimulation are mediated by activation of mGluR5. A prerequisite for astrocytes to modulate basal synaptic transmission is that interfering with mGluR5 function should alter basal synaptic transmission in pyramidal cells, as did the injection of BAPTA in astrocytes. EPSCs evoked using minimal stimulation of putative single presynaptic fibers were recorded for 10 min in control ACSF solution and then in the presence of MPEP (25 μM). We found that the failure rate increased from 50.9% ± 6.1% in control to 87.9% ± 6.7% in MPEP (n = 5 cells; Student's paired t test; p < 0.05; Figures 5B and 5D), whereas the potency of synaptic currents was unchanged (−14.8 ± 1.1 pA in control, −13.9 ± 0.9 pA in MPEP; n = 5 cells; Student's paired t test; p > 0.05; Figures 5B and 5D). This indicates that mGluR5 activation upregulates the efficiency of basal transmission at individual pyramidal cell synapses. Because basal synaptic transmission activates astrocytes in a Ca2+- and mGluR5-dependent manner and buffering Ca2+ in astrocytes and mGluR5 antagonism impaired basal synaptic transmission, we next assessed whether astrocytes are involved in the mGluR5-mediated modulation of basal synaptic transmission. One would predict that the MPEP effect on basal synaptic transmission should be masked by selective blockade of Ca2+ signaling in astrocytes. Intracellular dialysis of BAPTA (10–30 mM) in an astrocyte prevented completely the increase in failure rate of EPSCs that was normally induced by MPEP (Figures 5C and 5D; from 63.3% ± 9.1% in control to 50.8% ± 4.6% in MPEP; n = 6 experiments; Student's paired t test; p > 0.05). Synaptic potency remained unchanged (−18.1 ± 1.2 pA in control, −17.4 ± 1.1 pA in MPEP; n = 6 experiments; Student's paired t test; p > 0.05). These results suggest that Ca2+-dependent astrocyte activity is necessary for the mGluR5-dependent regulation of basal synaptic transmission. Another possibility is that MPEP effects on basal synaptic transmission were due to mGluR5-mediated Ca2+ signaling in pyramidal neurons (Holbro et al., 2009Holbro N. Grunditz A. Oertner T.G. Differential distribution of endoplasmic reticulum controls metabotropic signaling and plasticity at hippocampal synapses.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2009; 106: 15055-15060Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). This was tested by intracellular perfusion of BAPTA in the postsynaptic pyramidal neuron and examining MPEP effects on minimally evoked EPSCs. Injection of BAPTA (20 mM) in pyramidal neurons did not impair MPEP effects, as the EPSC failure rate increased from 50.0% ± 6.7% in control to 100% with MPEP (n = 5 cells; Student's paired t test; p < 0.05; Figure 5D). Hence, it is unlikely that the MPEP effect occurs through its action on mGluR5 in pyramidal cells. It is also unlikely that the effect could be mediated by a presynaptic action of glutamate, as the known presynaptic glutamatergic receptors are negatively linked to transmitter release (Ayala et al., 2008Ayala J.E. Niswender C.M. Luo Q. Banko J.L. Conn P.J.

During RNA synthesis RNA polymerase (RNAP) forms one of the most stable protein-DNA complexes, the elongation complex (EC). ECs, however, must frequently be dislodged by the replication machinery (replisome) (Figure S1 available online). RNAP and the replisome share the same DNA track, but the replisome moves ∼20 times more rapidly than RNAP (Kornberg and Baker, 1992Kornberg A. Baker T. DNA Replication.Second Edition. W. H. Freeman and Co., New York1992Google Scholar). Therefore, even though transcription of the most active and essential bacterial genes tends to occur with the same polarity as replication fork progression (Brewer, 1988Brewer B.J.

Recent in vitro studies support these views, demonstrating that during a codirectional collision the replisome rapidly dislocates RNAP while bypassing the EC roadblock, whereas head-on collisions result in replisome stalling followed by slow EC displacement (Pomerantz and O'Donnell, 2008Pomerantz R.T.

O'Donnell M. Direct restart of a replication fork stalled by a head-on RNA polymerase.Science. 2010; 327: 590-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Notably, codirectional collision with a halted EC can result in discontinuous replication in which the DNA polymerase (Pol III) terminates the leading strand to restart synthesis using the nascent transcript as a primer (Pomerantz and O'Donnell, 2008Pomerantz R.T. O'Donnell M. The replisome uses mRNA as a primer after colliding with RNA polymerase.Nature. 2008; 456: 762-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). In contrast to this view, a recent ChIP-chip interrogation of transcription-replication conflicts in exponentially growing Bacillus subtilis indicates that codirectional collisions at highly expressed ribosomal genes can lead to replication disruption (Merrikh et al., 2011Merrikh H. Machón C. Grainger W.H. Grossman A.D. Soultanas P.

Because RNAP backtracks, i.e., slides back and forth along RNA and DNA at numerous sites, and interacts with multiple elongation/termination factors in vivo (Nudler et al., 1997Nudler E. Mustaev A.

RNA polymerase active center: the molecular engine of transcription.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2009; 78: 335-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), the actual outcome and mechanism of replication fork progression through the EC remain unknown. Here we show that in E. coli, codirectional collisions with backtracked ECs often result in double-strand breaks (DSBs). Active ribosomes and multiple transcription elongation and termination factors preserve genome integrity by diminishing backtracking events. We designed a plasmid-based system to monitor codirectional and head-on collisions between the replisome and RNAP in living E. coli cells. One plasmid carried the phage λ cI857 pL-nutL-RBSN-UTR cassette oriented codirectionally with the ColE1 origin of replication (pCODIR); in a second plasmid, the origin and the transcription cassettes were oriented head-on (pHDON) (Figure 1A ). The temperature-sensitive cI857 repressor allows for rapid activation of the pL promoter at 42°C. Other features of the cassette make it possible to modulate EC processivity. The nutL site in the RNA can be used to recruit λ N or phage HK022 Nun factors, which stimulate or inhibit elongation, respectively (Greive et al., 2005Greive S.J. Lins A.F. von Hippel P.H.

Role of E.coli transcription-repair coupling factor Mfd in Nun-mediated transcription termination.J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 329: 655-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Nun protein arrests ECs downstream of nutL in vitro and in vivo (Washburn et al., 2003Washburn R.S. Wang Y. Gottesman M.E. Role of E.coli transcription-repair coupling factor Mfd in Nun-mediated transcription termination.J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 329: 655-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Finally, it is possible to insert an ATG downstream to RBSN, which allows us to determine the effect of translating ribosomes, which stimulate transcription elongation (Proshkin et al., 2010Proshkin S. Rahmouni A.R. Mironov A. Nudler E. Cooperation between translating ribosomes and RNA polymerase in transcription elongation.Science. 2010; 328: 504-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar), on EC-replisome collisions. In the first series of experiments we probed the effect of Nun-arrested ECs on chromosome stability. Wild-type (WT) and Mfd-deficient (Δmfd) cells carrying pCODIR or pHDON plasmids were shifted to 42°C for 1 hr to induce the pL promoter in the presence or absence of HK022 nun+ prophage. Nun-arrested ECs are resistant to Rho-dependent termination and can be cleared from DNA only by the powerful ATP-driven Mfd helicase (Washburn et al., 2003Washburn R.S. Wang Y. Gottesman M.E. Role of E.coli transcription-repair coupling factor Mfd in Nun-mediated transcription termination.J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 329: 655-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Primer extension performed on pCODIR and pHDON isolated from Δmfd cells revealed a characteristic pattern of bands that appeared only in the presence of Nun (Figure 1B). The breaks were downstream of nutL, as expected if they were induced by Nun-mediated transcriptional arrest. Because the pattern of breaks was similar for both DNA strands regardless of promoter orientation (as determined by the primer extension probing of the nontemplate [Figure 1B] and template [Figure S2A ] strands) and the clusters of breaks overlapped between strands (see schematics in Figure S2B), we conclude that Nun-arrested ECs caused DSBs in both codirectional and head-on orientations. Treatment with the replication inhibitor hydroxyurea (HU) just prior to induction of pL eliminated DSBs (Figure 1C), supporting the idea that DNA damage depended on replication fork collision with arrested ECs. Also, no breaks were detected without promoter induction (Figure 1D), confirming that DSBs required both transcription and replication to occur at the same time. The location of the DSBs coincided precisely with the positions of the Nun-arrested ECs. The pattern of in situ chloroacetaldehyde (CAA) footprinting, which probes transcription bubbles (Proshkin et al., 2010Proshkin S. Rahmouni A.R. Mironov A. Nudler E. Cooperation between translating ribosomes and RNA polymerase in transcription elongation.Science. 2010; 328: 504-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar), was very similar to that of the DSBs (Figure 1C). Taken together these results demonstrate that both codirectional and head-on collisions between Nun-arrested ECs and the replisome induce DSBs. Mfd relieved codirectional DNA damage by releasing Nun-arrested ECs (Figure 1B). In contrast, head-on transcription in the presence of Nun induced equivalent DNA damage in both WT and Δmfd mutant cells. The inability of Mfd in vivo to release Nun-arrested ECs ahead of replisomes approaching head-on contrasts with a recent report indicating that head-on collisions between replication and transcription can be resolved by Mfd in vitro (Pomerantz and O'Donnell, 2010Pomerantz R.T. O'Donnell M. Direct restart of a replication fork stalled by a head-on RNA polymerase.Science. 2010; 327: 590-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). The experiments with Nun demonstrate that transcriptional arrest leads to DNA damage and validate our experimental system to monitor codirectional and head-on collisions in vivo. To determine whether spontaneously arrested ECs (i.e., ECs arrested in the absence of Nun) also interfere with replication, we assayed for DSBs under conditions that compromise the elongation process. Transcription elongation is frequently interrupted by pauses and arrests. The majority of such interruptions result from RNAP backtracking, the reverse sliding of an EC along DNA and RNA that occurs at many different DNA sequences (Nudler et al., 1997Nudler E. Mustaev A.

During RNAP backtracking, the 3′-OH end of the RNA detaches from the catalytic site and is extruded into the RNAP substrate-binding pore (secondary channel), thereby causing transient or permanent EC inactivation (Nudler et al., 1997Nudler E.

Cramer P. Structural basis of RNA polymerase II backtracking, arrest and reactivation.Nature. 2011; 471: 249-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). The bacterial cell employs several mechanisms to minimize backtracking. GreA and GreB elongation factors reactivate backtracked ECs by stimulating a transcript cleavage reaction in the RNAP catalytic site to generate a new 3′-OH terminus (Nudler, 2009Nudler E. RNA polymerase active center: the molecular engine of transcription.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2009; 78: 335-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, Borukhov et al., 2005Borukhov S. Lee J. Laptenko O. Bacterial transcription elongation factors: new insights into molecular mechanism of action.Mol. Microbiol. 2005; 55: 1315-1324Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Additionally, we recently showed that active ribosomes enhance the rate of transcription elongation by suppressing RNAP backtracking (Proshkin et al., 2010Proshkin S. Rahmouni A.R. Mironov A. Nudler E. Cooperation between translating ribosomes and RNA polymerase in transcription elongation.Science. 2010; 328: 504-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). To determine the role of anti-backtracking mechanisms in genome stability, we monitored DSBs downstream of pL in the untranslated regions (UTRs) of pCODIR and pHDON. No significant DNA lesions were observed in WT cells (Figure 2A , lane 1). However, deletion of greA or greB resulted in a prominent cluster of DSBs ∼30 nucleotides downstream of RBSN in pCODIR (Figure 2A, lanes 2 and 3). In contrast, no DSBs were seen in head-on transcription and replication (pHDON; Figure 2A, lanes 5 and 6). The lesions depended on both DNA replication and transcription because they didn't appear without promoter activation (Figure 2B) and were entirely eliminated by HU (Figure 2C). The breaks occurred in both DNA strands (Figure S2) and were associated with plasmid linearization (Figure 2D, lanes 2 and 3), confirming that they were DSBs. We conclude that naturally backtracked ECs cause DSBs in vivo due to codirectional collisions with the replisome. Remarkably, the insertion of an ATG linked to RBSN, i.e., the conversion of the UTR to an open reading frame (ORF), eliminated all breaks and plasmid linearization associated with Gre deficiency (Figure 2A, lanes 7–9; Figure 2D, lanes7–9). Thus, the elongation factors GreA and GreB and actively translating ribosomes prevent DNA damage by suppressing RNAP backtracking. Translation dominates this process because no damage was detected in Gre-deficient cells when ribosomes were allowed to initiate translation. Unlike Nun-arrested ECs, naturally paused or arrested ECs should be sensitive to Rho-dependent termination. In this way, Rho-mediated disruption of backtracked ECs could serve as an alternative means of preventing deleterious collisions with backtracked ECs. Consistent with this idea, addition of the antibiotic bicyclomycin (BCM), which specifically targets Rho (Zwiefka et al., 1993Zwiefka A. Kohn H. Widger W.R.

Termination factor Rho and its cofactors NusA and NusG silence foreign DNA in E. coli.Science. 2008; 320: 935-938Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar), induced prominent DNA breaks within the UTR. These DSBs were located at the same sites as those observed in Δgre cells (Figure 2A, lane 10) and were also associated with plasmid linearization (Figure 2D, lane 10). BCM-mediated DNA breaks could be detected only in pCODIR, i.e., in the case of codirectional transcription and replication, but not in pHDON (Figure 2A, lanes 10–13). HU suppressed the BCM-induced breaks (Figure 2C, lane 6), as did conversion of the UTR to an ORF (Figure 2A, lane 11). Taken together, the results with BCM and Gre-deficient cells indicate that in the absence of translation, Rho and the transcript cleavage factors, together, remove arrested ECs. Failure to remove naturally arrested ECs induces DNA damage upon codirectional collisions with the replisome. Importantly, removal of arrested ECs from head-on replication clearly does not depend on these factors (Figure 2) because we do not detect DNA damage associated with Gre or Rho deficiency during head-on collisions. The transcription bubble of the major arrested EC in Δgre or BCM-treated cells in the presence of HU was located by in situ CAA footprinting. The arrested EC was ∼285 nt downstream of the transcription start site, near the beginning of the UTR (Figure 3A , lanes 2 and 3, orange line #1). To confirm that this EC was indeed backtracked, we used purified His6-tagged E. coli RNAP to transcribe in vitro a PCR-generated DNA template containing the pL-nutL-RBSN-UTR sequence. After a single round of transcription with a physiological concentration of ribonucleoside triphopshates (NTPs), approximately 40% of ECs halted at position +298 (Figure 3B, lane 1). In the presence of GreA or GreB, however, most RNAPs progressed through this major arrest site (Figure 3B, lanes 2 and 3). Because RNAP was immobilized on Co2+-chelating beads, we could wash away unincorporated NTPs and then treat EC298 with GreA or GreB. EC298 was highly sensitive to both factors (Figure 3B, lanes 6 and 7). The sizes of the GreB cleavage products were consistent with backtracking of as much as 15 nt (Figure 3B, lane 7 and Figure 3C). These in vitro results confirm that the CAA footprint in Gre-deficient or BCM-treated cells (Figure 3A) corresponds to spontaneously backtracked EC298. Notably, the cluster of major DSB breaks (∼18 nt long) begins close to the upstream edge of the DNA bubble formed by fully backtracked EC298 (Figure 3C). DNA lesions resulting from conflicts between replication and transcription are thought to occur because the replisome stalls at stable RNAP complexes and the replication fork collapses (Mirkin and Mirkin, 2007Mirkin E.V.

It has been suggested that the mutants form less stable complexes with template DNA, thus decreasing the probability of collisions with replisomes (McGlynn and Lloyd, 2000McGlynn P. Lloyd R.G.

The rpoB∗35 mutation (β H1244Q) suppresses the UV sensitivity of ruv and mfd strains and the temperature sensitivity of greA/greB deletion mutants (McGlynn and Lloyd, 2000McGlynn P. Lloyd R.G.

Lloyd R.G. Modulation of DNA repair by mutations flanking the DNA channel through RNA polymerase.EMBO J. 2002; 21: 6944-6953Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Indeed, we found that rpoB∗35 suppressed the formation of DSBs in Gre-deficient cells (Figure 2E, lanes 2–4 and Figure 2F, lanes 9–11) as well as in cells treated with BCM (Figure 2E, lanes 5–7). This effect was not due to EC instability, however, as the ECs formed in vitro with RpoB∗35 RNAP were as stable as ECs formed with WT RNAP (Figure S3). Instead, RpoB∗35 polymerase largely ignored the +298 arrest site (Figure 3B, lane 4). Thus, failure of the mutant polymerase to pause and backtrack explains its ability to suppress the formation of DSBs. These results further support the idea that the backtracked state of the EC determines the conflict between replication and transcription with subsequent DNA damage. Taken together the above observations demonstrate that DSBs result from clashes between the replisome and backtracked RNAP (Figure 4A and Figure S4). Rapid reannealing of RNA after RNAP has been dislodged by the replisome can generate R loops (RNA:DNA hybrids) because the DNA nontemplate strand is not readily available to displace RNA after the collision (Figure 4A and Figure S1). Stable R loops are possible with backtracked ECs because they carry longer segments of RNA available for reannealing (the extruded 3′ portion) (Figure 4A). In contrast, active ECs can generate only ∼8 bp hybrids (Nudler et al., 1997Nudler E. Mustaev A. Lukhtanov E. Goldfarb A. The RNA-DNA hybrid maintains the register of transcription by preventing backtracking of RNA polymerase.Cell. 1997; 89: 33-41Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) that are unstable without RNAP (Figure 4A). Extended R loops from backtracked ECs provide accessible 3′-OH termini that could serve as primers for DNA synthesis (Figure 4A). Indeed, in vitro experiments show that a replisome involved in a codirectional collision with RNAP can restart DNA synthesis using nascent RNA as a replication primer (Pomerantz and O'Donnell, 2008Pomerantz R.T. O'Donnell M. The replisome uses mRNA as a primer after colliding with RNA polymerase.Nature. 2008; 456: 762-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Such a switch leads to a break in the leading DNA strand, which must be repaired before the next replisome converts it to a DSB (Kuzminov, 1995Kuzminov A. Collapse and repair of replication forks in Escherichia coli.Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 16: 373-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar) (Figure 4A). Our results suggest that the repair process may not be sufficiently fast. It may be complicated by a 5′ RNA overhang (Figure 4A) or by approaching ECs, which could obstruct gap filling (Selby and Sancar, 1994Selby C.P. Sancar A. Mechanisms of transcription-repair coupling and mutation frequency decline.Microbiol. Rev. 1994; 58: 317-329Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Approaching ECs are suggested by in situ footprinting of RNAP in the ΔgreA mutant (Figure 3A, orange lines #2 and 3). The location and size of the DSB zone (∼20 nt) promoter-proximal to the backtracked EC298 supports this model of DSB formation.Figure S4RNase H Suppresses DSBs Associated with Codirectional but Not Head-On Collisions with Nun-Arrested Complexes, Related to Figure 4BShow full captionExperimental conditions were the same as in Figure 1B, except that cells also contained a low-copy plasmid expressing RNaseH from the strong Tac promoter. Elimination of DNA breaks by RNase H (lane 4) argues that these breaks were the result of codirectional collisions with backtracked Nun-arrested ECs and that they occurred by the same R loop-dependent mechanism as we propose for other backtracked ECs (Figure 4A). In the case of codirectional collisions, breaks occur next to and also within the extended hybrid (R loop) region. In case of head-on collision, replication fork collapse should also occur within the R loop region. Thus it is possible that even though the mechanism of breaks in codirectional and head-on collision with Nun-arrested ECs is different, the positioning of these breaks and their pattern are very similar.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Experimental conditions were the same as in Figure 1B, except that cells also contained a low-copy plasmid expressing RNaseH from the strong Tac promoter.

In human cells, chromosomes form a ring around the spindle during prometaphase This arrangement requires chromokinesin-mediated ejection of chromosome arms Formation of the ring accelerates spindle assembly Stable amphitelic attachments form during late prometaphase and metaphase The goal of mitosis is to ensure that daughter cells inherit identical genetic information transmitted in the form of duplicated chromosomes. To achieve this goal, cells employ a microtubule-based molecular machine termed the “spindle.” Chromosomes attach to spindle microtubules via kinetochores, discrete macromolecular assemblies that reside at the chromosome's centromere. The two kinetochores on each chromosome must stably attach to the opposite spindle poles (amphitelic attachment, reviewed in Walczak et al., 2010Walczak C.E. Cai S. Khodjakov A. Mechanisms of chromosome behaviour during mitosis.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2010; 11: 91-102Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The general principle of mitotic spindle assembly is described as microtubule “search & capture” (S&C) (Kirschner and Mitchison, 1986Kirschner M. Mitchison T. Beyond self-assembly: from microtubules to morphogenesis.Cell. 1986; 45: 329-342Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (945) Google Scholar). In this model, dynamic plus ends of microtubules grow and shrink until they are captured and stabilized by a kinetochore. Modern computational models predict that unbiased S&C would require hours before each of the kinetochores on 46 chromosomes present in a typical human cell encounters a single microtubule (Wollman et al., 2005Wollman R. Cytrynbaum E.N. Jones J.T. Meyer T. Scholey J.M. Mogilner A. Efficient chromosome capture requires a bias in the ‘search-and-capture’ process during mitotic-spindle assembly.Curr.

This discrepancy implies that additional mechanisms facilitate mitotic spindle assembly by guiding microtubules growth toward kinetochores (O'Connell et al., 2009O'Connell C.B. Loncarek J. Kaláb P.

USA. 2009; 106: 15708-15713Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). To what extent various accessory pathways are harnessed by chromosomes during normal mitosis remains unknown. Computational models predict that the efficiency of S&C is profoundly affected by geometric constraints such as the shape of the cell and initial positions of centrosomes and chromosomes at the onset of mitosis (Paul et al., 2009Paul R. Wollman R. Silkworth W.T. Nardi I.K. Cimini D. Mogilner A. Computer simulations predict that chromosome movements and rotations accelerate mitotic spindle assembly without compromising accuracy.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2009; 106: 15708-15713Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Interestingly, a common feature of mammalian cells is that they round up during division so that the spindle assembles in three-dimensional (3D) space. Yet, owing to technical limitations, most studies of spindle assembly rely on 2D recordings of a single focal plane. Here we report a 3D analysis of centrosome and kinetochore movements in the nontransformed diploid human cell line RPE1. Our data reveal that spindle assembly is facilitated by a transient arrangement of chromosomes in a ring surrounding the central part of the spindle during early prometaphase. Formation of the chromosome ring is driven by the combination of labile lateral kinetochore/microtubule interactions and spindle ejection forces. As a result, centromeres become prepositioned near the spindle equator where kinetochores are exposed to the high density of microtubules that promotes formation of stable amphitelic attachments. The length and orientation of the spindle are determined by spatial separation of the duplicated centrosomes. This separation can occur during prophase or after nuclear envelope breakdown (NEB), during prometaphase (Mole-Bajer, 1975Mole-Bajer J.

In the latter case the spindle was reported to form as a monopolar structure that subsequently bipolarizes. The “prophase” and “prometaphase” pathways (Mole-Bajer, 1975Mole-Bajer J.

Cell Biol. 2009; 184: 365-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), and these different routes of centrosome separation may affect the efficiency of spindle assembly (Rosenblatt, 2005Rosenblatt J.

To establish the pattern of centrosome separation in RPE1 cells, we recorded 4D movies (Z series spanning the cell volume at every time point). The data were collected at high spatial (1.4 N.A., 0.5 μm Z steps) and temporal (5 s intervals) resolution. Our analyses reveal that centrosomes always separate to the opposite sides of the nucleus prior to NEB in RPE1 cells (Figure 1). In the majority of late-prophase cells (∼73%, 49/67), one centrosome resides above and one below the nucleus so that upon NEB, the forming spindle is initially oriented vertically (the angle between the spindle axis and the surface of the coverslip exceeds 30°). Hereafter we refer to these cells “V-cells.” In the remaining ∼27% (18/67) of cells, centrosomes are separated to the opposite sides of the nucleus horizontally so that spindle axis at NEB is tilted less than 30° with respect to the coverslip (hereafter “H-cells”). In planar XY view, vertical separation of centrosomes in V-cells may create an impression that the centrosomes form a common complex. However, as evident from 3D microscopy, the centrosomes in V-cells are in fact physically separated by the intervening nucleus (Figure 1A; Movie S1 available online). Due to the disk-like shape of the nucleus, intercentrosome distances at NEB are much greater in H- than in V-cells, and this distance begins to increase immediately after NEB (Figures 1B and 1C). The rate of spindle elongation is not linear with the velocity increasing gradually to 2.2 ± 0.5 μm/min, which is generally consistent with the velocity of antiparallel sliding of microtubules driven by kinesin-5 (Kapitein et al., 2005Kapitein L.C. Peterman E.J. Kwok B.H. Kim J.H. Kapoor T.M. Schmidt C.F. The bipolar mitotic kinesin Eg5 moves on both microtubules that it crosslinks.Nature. 2005; 435: 114-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar, Uteng et al., 2008Uteng M. Hentrich C. Miura K. Bieling P. Surrey T. Poleward transport of Eg5 by dynein-dynactin in Xenopus laevis egg extract spindles.J. Cell Biol. 2008; 182: 715-726Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Although maximal rate of spindle elongation is similar between V- and H-cells (2.3 ± 0.4 and 1.9 ± 0.5 μm/min, Figures 1B′ and 1C′), the peak velocity is reached ∼5 min after NEB in V-cells and ∼2.5 min in H-cells when the spindle length is ∼10 μm in both cases. This suggests that the initial slower phase of spindle elongation is not due to a gradual activation of mitotic kinesins (Blangy et al., 1995Blangy A. Lane H.A. d'Hérin P. Harper M. Kress M. Nigg E.A.

Vale R.D. Cell cycle-dependent dynamics and regulation of mitotic kinesins in Drosophila S2 cells.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2005; 16: 3896-3907Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Instead, the elongation rate is likely to reflect changes in the region of antiparallel microtubule overlap. Because at NEB the centrosomes are already farther apart in H-cells (7.9 ± 2.3 μm), the spindle reaches its full length (13.4 ± 1.2 μm) more rapidly in H- versus V-cells (∼5 min versus ∼8 min in V-cells; Figures 1B and 1C). In V-cells spindle elongation is concurrent with spindle rotation at the average rate of 6–7 degrees per min, so that ∼8 min after NEB the spindle is oriented parallel to the coverslip surface (Figure 1B″, Movie S1). The final orientation of the spindle is identical in V- and H-cells (81.8 ± 6.6° and 82.4 ± 6.9°, respectively; Figures 1B″ and 1C″). Therefore, we conclude that RPE1 cells rely exclusively on the prophase pathway of centrosome separation, and the efficiency of spindle assembly does not depend on the direction of the initial centrosome separation. Our data also reveal the remarkable consistency of spindle assembly in RPE1 cells—in all cells the spindle is fully elongated and properly oriented ∼8 min after NEB. We used 3D time-lapse movies of the RPE1 cell coexpressing centrin1-GFP and CENP-A-GFP fusions to explore whether there is a specific pattern in the spatial arrangement of chromosomes during the initial stages of spindle formation. Restricting image acquisition to a single channel allowed us to avoid significant photodamage although the centrioles and kinetochores could still be easily discerned in the recordings due to their dramatically different behaviors. Shortly after NEB, kinetochores residing in the inner parts of the nucleus are rapidly expelled from the central part of the early spindle. This outward movement of the centrally located kinetochores, combined with the inward movement of more peripheral kinetochores, leads to the arrangement of the chromosomes in a ring with the arms pointing outwards and the centromeres inwards toward the spindle axis (Figure 2A , 1:40; Movie S2). This ring forms in both V- and H-cells, although it can be easily overlooked in the conventional xy view due to unfavorable spindle orientation. The ring becomes apparent when viewed along the spindle axis (Figure 2A, 5:30; also see Figure S2). Fixed-cell immunofluorescence analysis confirms that the space inside the chromosome ring is filled with microtubules comprising the compact spindle that forms following NEB (Figures 2B and 2C). The effects of occlusion by the dense network of microtubules are clearly seen in 3D reconstructions (Figures 2B′–2E′ and Movie S3). At later stages of spindle formation, chromosomes move into the central part of the spindle so that the toroidal distribution of kinetochores gradually converts into a typical metaphase plate with evenly spaced kinetochores (Figure 2A, 10:50). The chromosome ring is not unique to RPE1 cells. Similar patterns form during mitosis in transformed human cells (HeLa; Figure S1) as well as in cells originating from other species (rat NRK-52E; Figure S1). A similar arrangement also exists during meiosis in the mouse (Kitajima et al., 2011Kitajima T.S. Ohsugi M. Ellenberg J.

The volume between the poles that is void of chromosomes is filled with high-density of microtubules. Bar, 5 μm. To gain deeper insight into the organization of the chromosome ring, we employed correlative light/electron microscopy (Figure 3 and Figure S2). Serial-section reconstruction of an RPE1 cell fixed during early prometaphase reveals that spindle microtubules densely populate the central part of the nascent spindle between the centrosomes. Interestingly, there is a sharp demarcation in the density of microtubules with only few microtubules protruding beyond the spindle proper (Figure 3B). Most centromeres reside at the boundary of the spindle with their kinetochores interacting with microtubules in a lateral fashion (Figure 3C). Surprisingly, centromeres can be markedly stretched even when both sister kinetochores lack proper end-on microtubule attachments (Figure 3D). This observation is surprising as it is generally assumed that stable amphitelic attachments are required for centromere stretching (reviewed in Maresca and Salmon, 2010Maresca T.J. Salmon E.D.

(C) When the dataset is rotated to generate maximal intensity projections along the axis of the spindle the ring becomes obvious. Having observed reproducible formation of the chromosome ring during mitosis, we sought to establish whether this pattern bears a functional significance for spindle assembly. To this end, we harnessed the computational model constructed by Paul et al., 2009Paul R. Wollman R. Silkworth W.T. Nardi I.K. Cimini D. Mogilner A. Computer simulations predict that chromosome movements and rotations accelerate mitotic spindle assembly without compromising accuracy.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2009; 106: 15708-15713Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, which predicted that only a few kinetochores would be initially exposed to microtubules in the crowded environment of a human cell with 46 chromosomes. To estimate whether formation of the chromosome ring would facilitate S&C within the constraints of the Paul model, two types of simulations were conducted. The chromosomes were assumed to either be spread uniformly and randomly throughout the nuclear space (oblate spheroid with 14 × 14 × 7 μm) or form a toroid with the dimensions extracted from our live- and fixed-cell observations (inner radius 4 μm and outer radius 7 μm). Although the difference between these two types of chromosome distribution is visually subtle (cf. Figure 4A , “Random” versus “Toroidal”), the simulation predicts that the efficiency of S&C is significantly improved by the chromosome ring. The number of kinetochores exposed to microtubules increases from ∼30% in the case of uniformly distributed chromosomes to ∼70% in the ring configuration. As a result, within a 3 min long search, ∼60% of the chromosomes would be captured and incorporated into the spindle in the ring configuration, which is a dramatic improvement over the randomly distributed chromosomes. Thus, formation of the chromosome ring at the onset of mitosis is advantageous for S&C and is predicted to accelerate mitotic spindle assembly by approximately 6–8 min. To experimentally test this prediction, we followed the dynamics of mitosis in cells depleted of the chromokinesin Kid (kinesin-10) (Tokai et al., 1996Tokai N. Fujimoto-Nishiyama A. Toyoshima Y. Yonemura S. Tsukita S. Inoue J. Yamamota T. Kid, a novel kinesin-like DNA binding protein, is localized to chromosomes and the mitotic spindle.EMBO J. 1996; 15: 457-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). We reasoned that expulsion of chromosomes from the central part of the spindle is likely to be driven by the spindle ejection force (Rieder et al., 1986Rieder C.L. Davison E.A. Jensen L.C. Cassimeris L. Salmon E.D. Oscillatory movements of monooriented chromosomes and their position relative to the spindle pole result from the ejection properties of the aster and half-spindle.J.

Previous studies have established that inactivation of Kid does not prevent formation of a functional bipolar spindle, although several aspects of chromosome movement are affected and the duration of mitosis is increased (Levesque and Compton, 2001Levesque A.A. Compton D.A. The chromokinesin Kid is necessary for chromosome arm orientation and oscillation, but not congression, on mitotic spindles.J.

The chromokinesin Kid is required for maintenance of proper metaphase spindle size.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2005; 16: 5455-5463Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Our 3D recordings reveal that, in fact, formation of the chromosome ring is inhibited upon siRNA depletion of Kid (Figure 4B), and the duration of mitosis increases by approximately 6 min (from 19.4 ± 2.9 min in control [n = 8] to 25 ± 3.3 min in Kid-depleted cells [n = 10]), which is in excellent agreement with the model. The delay is due to slower formation of the metaphase plate (cf. Figures 4B and 4C; Movie S4 and Movie S5). We also observed similar inhibition of the ring formation and prolongation of prometaphase in cells microinjected with an antibody raised against the Kid DNA-binding domain, which was previously used by Levesque and Compton, 2001Levesque A.A. Compton D.A. The chromokinesin Kid is necessary for chromosome arm orientation and oscillation, but not congression, on mitotic spindles.J. Cell Biol. 2001; 154: 1135-1146Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar (n = 4; data not shown). Thus, experimental perturbation of chromosome ring formation decreases the efficiency of spindle assembly as predicted by the computational model. Three-dimensional recordings of cells with GFP-tagged kinetochores and centrioles allowed us to visualize the general pattern of spindle assembly. However, owing to the large number of chromosomes and complexity of their movements in 3D space, we were unable to continuously follow trajectories of individual chromosomes from NEB through anaphase in these recordings. To overcome this limitation, we developed an assay in which one or two pairs of sister kinetochores were photoactivated in RPE1 cells expressing CENP-A-PAGFP (Figure S3A ). Photoactivation was conducted with pulses of highly focused 405 nm laser light during late G2 or early prophase before the chromosomes were fully condensed. This ensured that selection of chromosomes was not biased toward particular sizes of chromosomes or their location with respect to the centrosomes because the exact position of centrosomes during NEB could not be predicted at the time of photoactivation. Due to a low number of objects in our recordings (1–2 pairs of kinetochores and 2 centrosomes), 3D positions of sister kinetochores and centrosomes can be reliably tracked and analyzed (Figures S3B and S3C; Movie S6). Comparative and averaging analyses of 81 trajectories (50 from NEB through anaphase and 31 from NEB through metaphase) obtained in 67 cells allowed us to identify characteristic features of chromosome behavior in diploid human cells (Figure S3D). In turn, these features help to reveal the pathways that are prevalent during normal spindle assembly. Consistent with data obtained in cells with all kinetochores labeled, individual-kinetochore tracking reveals that most centromeres remain near the spindle equator from NEB through anaphase onset (AO). Typically, the distance between kinetochores and spindle poles increases gradually during prometaphase (Figure 5A and Figure S3) until it reaches its maximum of 6.7 ± 1.6 μm ∼8 min after NEB when the prometaphase centrosome separation is completed (Figure S3D). Thus, somewhat counterintuitively, during spindle assembly the total displacement of centrosomes from their positions at NEB is greater than the total displacement of a typical chromosome. At the spindle equator, some chromosomes undergo continuous oscillations throughout metaphase, other chromosomes remain motionless, and some switch between periods of oscillations and irregular movements (Figure 5A). To characterize these behaviors numerically we used the DAP (deviation from average position) criterion developed by Stumpff and coauthors (2008). We determined DAP for every chromosome in a series of 5 min windows that span from late prometaphase to AO. Chromosomes with DAP > 0.4 were considered oscillating (Stumpff et al., 2008Stumpff J. von Dassow G. Wagenbach M. Asbury C. Wordeman L. The kinesin-8 motor Kif18A suppresses kinetochore movements to control mitotic chromosome alignment.Dev. Cell. 2008; 14: 252-262Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). As shown in Figure 5B, 28% of chromosomes oscillate continuously, 68% undergo transitions between periods of oscillations and relative motionless, and 4% remain motionless throughout metaphase. The reason(s) for this variable behavior of congressed chromosomes, which are all expected to continuously maintain amphitelic attachments, remain unknown. We noticed that regular oscillations always begin after the centromere becomes stretched to ∼1 μm, which is consistent with the notion that oscillating chromosomes are stably attached to microtubules in the end-on fashion (Jaqaman et al., 2010Jaqaman K. King E.M. Amaro A.C. Winter J.R. Dorn J.F. Elliott H.L. McClelland S.E. Porter I.M. Posch M.

Cell Biol. 2010; 188: 665-667Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). However, achieving the full stretch of the centromere is not sufficient to induce oscillation (Figure 5A). Another characteristic chromosome behavior that was originally described in extremely flat newt lung cells is the rapid (∼18 μm/min) gliding of the kinetochore along the captured microtubule toward the centrosome (Rieder and Alexander, 1990Rieder C.L. Alexander S.P. Kinetochores are transported poleward along a single astral microtubule during chromosome attachment to the spindle in newt lung cells.J.

Complete 3D kinetochore tracking throughout meiosis I in mouse oocytes Chromosome congression precedes biorientation, forming the prometaphase belt Initial kinetochore-microtubule attachments are predominantly incorrect Quantitative analysis revealed that bivalent biorientation is highly error prone Proper segregation of homologous chromosomes during the first meiotic division in female oocytes is essential to prevent generation of aneuploid eggs. Fertilization of aneuploid eggs in humans is a leading cause of pregnancy loss and, if survived to term, results in developmental disabilities (Hassold and Hunt, 2001Hassold T. Hunt P. To err (meiotically) is human: the genesis of human aneuploidy.Nat. Rev. Genet. 2001; 2: 280-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (1618) Google Scholar). To segregate homologous chromosomes faithfully, it is essential that all bivalents, the paired homologous chromosomes, achieve biorientation, i.e., that their homologous kinetochores are attached to microtubules from the opposite poles of the meiotic spindle. Although the mechanism of sister chromatid biorientation has been well studied in somatic mitotic cells (Kops et al., 2010Kops G.J.P.L. Saurin A.T. Meraldi P.

Mechanisms of mitotic spindle assembly and function.Int. Rev. Cytol. 2008; 265: 111-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar), homologous chromosome biorientation in animal oocytes is poorly understood. Somatic animal cells contain two centrosomes that predefine the poles of the mitotic spindle. One of the most widely used models to explain biorientation is the so-called “search-and-capture” mechanism, in which sister kinetochores become attached to microtubules emanating from the spindle poles. If both kinetochores are attached in an end-on manner from opposite poles (amphitelic), the force balance leads to stable biorientation. If the attachment is incorrect, for example if one kinetochore is attached to two poles (merotelic) or both are attached to the same pole (syntelic), the force balance cannot be achieved. Such erroneous attachments are sensed by Aurora B kinase, which phosphorylates a set of kinetochore substrates to detach the incorrect microtubules. The detached kinetochores activate the spindle assembly checkpoint, giving the cell time for a new round of biorientation (Nezi and Musacchio, 2009Nezi L. Musacchio A. Sister chromatid tension and the spindle assembly checkpoint.Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2009; 21: 785-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Merotelic and syntelic attachments are regarded as errors that must be corrected because they would cause chromosome missegregation if they persisted until anaphase (Cimini et al., 2003Cimini D. Moree B. Canman J.C. Salmon E.D. Merotelic kinetochore orientation occurs frequently during early mitosis in mammalian tissue cells and error correction is achieved by two different mechanisms.J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 4213-4225Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Although no comprehensive quantitative analysis has been carried out, the available data (Cimini et al., 2003Cimini D. Moree B. Canman J.C. Salmon E.D. Merotelic kinetochore orientation occurs frequently during early mitosis in mammalian tissue cells and error correction is achieved by two different mechanisms.J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 4213-4225Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar) allow estimation of the number of erroneous attachments during prometaphase in somatic mitotic cells to less than 10%, although this may be an underestimate (Salmon et al., 2005Salmon E.D.

The classical search-and-capture model explains chromosome congression as a result of the biorientation process because the balance of the pulling forces on the sister kinetochores positions the chromosomes at the spindle equator. Although congression mechanisms that do not require biorientation have been described (Cai et al., 2009Cai S. O'Connell C.B. Khodjakov A. Walczak C.E.

Lateral microtubule bundles promote chromosome alignment during acentrosomal oocyte meiosis.Nat.

Kapoor T.M. Chromosome congression: on the bi-orient express.Nat. Cell Biol. 2009; 11: 787-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). By contrast, oocytes in humans and all other mammals analyzed so far (and also in Gallus, Xenopus, Drosophila, and C. elegans) lack centrosomes (Manandhar et al., 2005Manandhar G. Schatten H. Sutovsky P. Centrosome reduction during gametogenesis and its significance.Biol. Reprod. 2005; 72: 2-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar), and the search-and-capture mechanism should become insufficient in their large cytoplasm (Wollman et al., 2005Wollman R. Cytrynbaum E.N. Jones J.T. Meyer T. Scholey J.M. Mogilner A. Efficient chromosome capture requires a bias in the ‘search-and-capture’ process during mitotic-spindle assembly.Curr. Biol. 2005; 15: 828-832Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Oocytes must therefore achieve spindle bipolarization and chromosome biorientation through a different process (Walczak and Heald, 2008Walczak C.E. Heald R. Mechanisms of mitotic spindle assembly and function.Int. Rev. Cytol. 2008; 265: 111-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). Because mice represent the closest experimentally tractable model to humans, we have focused our analysis on their oocytes. We previously showed that the acentrosomal spindle in mouse oocytes is assembled by self-organization of many microtubule-organizing centers (MTOCs) (Schuh and Ellenberg, 2007Schuh M. Ellenberg J. Self-organization of MTOCs replaces centrosome function during acentrosomal spindle assembly in live mouse oocytes.Cell. 2007; 130: 484-498Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). Upon nuclear envelope breakdown (NEBD), over 80 MTOCs scattered in the cytoplasm attract each other and form a cluster in the center of the oocyte that radiates microtubules to the outside, the apolar microtubule ball. This ball then bipolarizes through a several hour tug of war of attractive and repulsive forces between the MTOCs, giving rise to multipolar intermediates and ultimately a barrel-shaped spindle with poorly focused poles. How homologous chromosome biorientation is achieved during this lengthy and complex spindle self-assembly process is not known to date. In this study, we have addressed this issue, using 3D confocal fluorescence microscopy at high spatial and temporal resolution in live mouse oocytes. We succeeded to track all homologous kinetochores during the approximately 8 hr from NEBD to the onset of chromosome segregation in anaphase. These datasets allowed a systematic quantitative analysis of kinetochore and chromosome dynamics during the first meiotic division. We show that chromosome congression precedes biorientation, forming an intermediate chromosome configuration, the prometaphase belt. Furthermore we show that two-thirds of all biorientation attempts are erroneous, and that 86% of all homologous chromosomes undergo error corrections of their kinetochore-microtubule attachments before they establish stable biorientation. These results show that homologous chromosome biorientation is a highly error-prone process in acentrosomal mammalian oocytes, which may explain the high incidence of segregation errors in meiosis I observed in vivo (Hassold and Hunt, 2001Hassold T. Hunt P. To err (meiotically) is human: the genesis of human aneuploidy.Nat. Rev. Genet. 2001; 2: 280-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (1618) Google Scholar). To analyze spatiotemporal dynamics of kinetochores and chromosomes during the first meiotic division of live mouse oocytes, we recorded four-dimensional (4D) datasets of kinetochores and chromosomes labeled with EGFP-CENP-C and Histone 2B (H2B)-mCherry, respectively, expressed after quantitative mRNA microinjection (Jaffe and Terasaki, 2004Jaffe L.A. Terasaki M. Quantitative microinjection of oocytes, eggs, and embryos.Methods Cell Biol. 2004; 74: 219-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) (Figure 1A ; Movie S1 available online). We used an automated confocal microscope that can focus and track all chromosomes within the oocyte to record 3D stacks of optical sections for 9 hr after induction of maturation (Schuh and Ellenberg, 2007Schuh M. Ellenberg J. Self-organization of MTOCs replaces centrosome function during acentrosomal spindle assembly in live mouse oocytes.Cell. 2007; 130: 484-498Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar, Rabut and Ellenberg, 2004Rabut G. Ellenberg J. Automatic real-time three-dimensional cell tracking by fluorescence microscopy.J. Microsc. 2004; 216: 131-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Live imaging did not perturb oocyte maturation, as the rate of polar body extrusion and average time from NEBD to polar body extrusion were indistinguishable from normal in vitro culture conditions (83% [n = 12 with imaging] versus 78% [n = 61 w/o imaging], p = 1.0; 8.8 ± 0.6 hr [n = 10] versus 8.6 ± 0.8 hr [n = 7], p = 0.7). In these 4D datasets, we could detect 99.6% of all kinetochores (n = 200 from 5 oocytes) at all time points from NEBD to anaphase onset with high spatial (xy 0.3 μm, z 3.0 μm) and temporal (90 s) resolution. The 4D datasets were processed by an in-house-developed computational pipeline, which detects kinetochore positions and tracks them in 3D after registration of global cellular movements. The resulting kinetochore tracks were interactively validated and rare errors corrected. In this manner we could obtain complete 3D tracking datasets of all kinetochores during the entire process of the first meiotic division (Figures 1B and 1E; Movie S2). We make these datasets available online as a resource for the analysis of kinetochore and chromosome dynamics (http://www.ellenberg.embl.de/apps/KTTracking/). To gain insight into the processes that govern kinetochore dynamics, we analyzed different parameters for reproducible global changes during the first meiotic division. The average kinetochore speed changed in a canonical and stepwise fashion after NEBD (Figures 1C and 1D; Movie S2), suggesting changes in the interactions of kinetochores and/or chromosome arms with microtubules. Thus we can define five kinetic phases of chromosome dynamics during the first meiotic division: phase 1 (∼0–1 hr), in which kinetochores move relatively rapidly (0.19 ± 0.04 μm/min, up to 0.31 μm/min) outwards; phase 2 (∼1–2 hr), in which kinetochores move more slowly (0.13 ± 0.03 μm/min, up to 0.25 μm/min) with no obvious radial directionality; phase 3 (∼2–4 hr), in which chromosomes exhibit rapid oscillations (0.27 ± 0.11 μm/min, up to 0.59 μm/min) along the spindle axis; phase 4 (from ∼4 hr to anaphase onset), in which chromosomes oscillate more slowly (0.19 ± 0.05 μm/min, up to 0.34 μm/min); and finally anaphase, during which chromosomes very rapidly move to the opposite spindle poles (0.80 ± 0.23 μm/min, up to 1.2 μm/min). Anaphase is triggered after completion of biorientation, but how chromosome biorientation is achieved during the preceding four phases is poorly understood in mammalian meiosis, and we therefore decided to analyze them in more detail. We previously reported that clustered chromosomes are individualized and moved onto the forming microtubule ball ∼0–1 hr after NEBD (Schuh and Ellenberg, 2007Schuh M. Ellenberg J. Self-organization of MTOCs replaces centrosome function during acentrosomal spindle assembly in live mouse oocytes.Cell. 2007; 130: 484-498Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar), which corresponds to phase 1. By analyzing kinetochore tracks during phase 1, we found that not only chromosomes but also kinetochores were individualized from their clusters during the chromosome-sorting process (Figures S1A–S1D), resulting in a spherical shell-like chromosome configuration on the surface of the microtubule ball (see also Figure 4). To understand how the individualized chromosomes congress to the metaphase plate, we carefully analyzed their spatial distribution in three dimensions over time. At the beginning of phase 2, chromosomes and kinetochores were distributed randomly (Figures 2A and 2B , 0:49) on the surface of the microtubule ball (see also Figure 4B). With the onset of chromosome congression, this distribution became progressively ordered as shown by a decrease in aspect ratio of the ellipsoid fitted to all chromosome positions (Figure 2C). At the end of phase 2, all chromosomes had relocated close to the equator of the overall chromosome distribution (Figures 2A–2C, 1:59; Movie S3). Viewing chromosome positions from the top onto the equator revealed that they formed a belt-like arrangement with a chromosome-free region inside of the equator (Figure 2B, top view, 1:59). Thus, chromosome congression results in a belt-like chromosome configuration, which we refer to hereafter as the “prometaphase belt.” To investigate how chromosomes move to the prometaphase belt, we analyzed their tracks during congression. Chromosomes that were located far from the equator at the beginning of phase 2 congressed toward it, whereas chromosomes already located near the equator remained stationary until the end of phase 2 (Figure 2D). The paths of the congressing chromosomes defined arcs around a 7.5 μm radius sphere, consistent with the size of the microtubule ball (see also Figure 4). Collectively, chromosomes therefore congress to form the prometaphase belt by sliding along the surface of the microtubule ball during phase 2 (Figure 3E , “phase 2”). We reasoned that plus-end-directed forces generated by chromokinesins might be responsible for chromosome individualization in phase 1 and/or prometaphase belt formation in phase 2. The chromokinesin Kid is a prime candidate because it has been shown to be required for expulsion of chromosomes on a monopolar spindle in mitotic cells (Levesque and Compton, 2001Levesque A.A. Compton D.A. The chromokinesin Kid is necessary for chromosome arm orientation and oscillation, but not congression, on mitotic spindles.J. Cell Biol. 2001; 154: 1135-1146Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar) and congression in Xenopus egg extracts (Antonio et al., 2000Antonio C. Ferby I. Wilhelm H. Jones M. Karsenti E.

The Xenopus chromokinesin Xkid is essential for metaphase chromosome alignment and must be degraded to allow anaphase chromosome movement.Cell. 2000; 102: 411-424Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). We therefore imaged chromosome and kinetochore dynamics in oocytes from Kid knockout mice (Ohsugi et al., 2008Ohsugi M. Adachi K. Horai R. Kakuta S. Sudo K. Kotaki H. Tokai-Nishizumi N. Sagara H. Iwakura Y. Yamamoto T. Kid-mediated chromosome compaction ensures proper nuclear envelope formation.Cell. 2008; 132: 771-782Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) (Figure S2A ). Quantitative analysis of these data revealed that neither chromosome individualization nor congression was significantly affected by the absence of Kid (Figures S2B–S2D), demonstrating that Kid is dispensable for these processes in mouse oocytes. Although the prometaphase belt formed during phase 2 represents a congressed chromosome configuration, in that all paired kinetochores are found around one plane, it is not yet the final arrangement in which chromosomes are stably bioriented. Therefore, we next addressed how the prometaphase belt with its chromosome-free interior transforms into the metaphase plate. During phase 3, chromosomes moved from the belt toward the center of the plane (Figures 3A–3D; Movie S3). This centripetal movement resulted in an even distribution of the chromosomes across the equatorial plane by the end of phase 3 (Figure S3A ), thereby defining the metaphase plate. Thus, the metaphase plate is formed by chromosomes invading the spindle from the peripheral prometaphase belt (Figure 3E, “phase 3”). Both the change in direction and the significant increase in speed of the invading chromosomes compared to phase 2 (average speed of congressing chromosomes = 0.13 ± 0.02 [n = 10]; average speed of invading chromosomes = 0.17 ± 0.04 [n = 6]; p = 0.01) indicated a different mechanism of this motion. Furthermore, the inward movements were concomitant with the onset of kinetochore oscillations perpendicular to the equator (Figure 3D), suggesting that kinetochore-microtubule attachments are dynamic during the invasion of chromosomes. Next, we wanted to determine when bivalents are stretched by directional microtubule forces. By measuring interkinetochore distances, we found that most bivalents were not stretched in phase 2, although they had already congressed, forming the prometaphase belt (Figures 4A and 4D and Movie S4, from −130 to −70 min). During the invasion in phase 3, however, the fraction of stretched bivalents increased progressively, reaching 89% ± 9% (Figures 4A and 4D and Movie S4, from −70 to 50 min). Thus, the majority of bivalents became stretched only after the formation of the prometaphase belt, as indicated by the significantly different half-time of chromosome congression and fraction of stretched bivalents (p = 0.0001, Figure 4E). To examine the relationship of spindle elongation with chromosome biorientation, we imaged kinetochores and microtubules by 3mCherry-CENP-C and EGFP-MAP4, respectively (Figure 4B). During phase 3 the spindle elongated, increasing its aspect ratio almost exactly concomitantly with the increase of stretched bivalents (Figures 4C and 4D, from −70 to 50 min), indicated by indistinguishable half-times of the increases (p = 1.0, Figure 4E). This precise kinetic correlation suggests that spindle elongation contributes to chromosome biorientation. To understand how homologous chromosomes achieve biorientation, we analyzed dynamics of bivalent stretching and alignment by measuring changes in interkinetochore distances and chromosome angles with the spindle axis, respectively. Average bivalent stretching (Figure 5B ) and alignment (Figure 5E) increased progressively with linear kinetics during phase 3 (from −70 to 50 min), confirming that the majority of chromosomes becomes bioriented during spindle elongation (compare Figure 4D). To analyze the kinetics of individual chromosome biorientation attempts (Figure 5A), we counted the number of significant bivalent stretching events (see Experimental Procedures and Figure S4A ) over time. Biorientation attempts occurred most frequently in the first half of phase 3 (Figure 5D, from −50 to 0 min), when the spindle starts to elongate (compare Figure 4D), and oriented the chromosomes parallel to the spindle axis (Figure 5G). By contrast, biorientation attempts that occurred prior to spindle elongation in phase 2 (compare Figure 4D) failed to orient chromosomes along the spindle axis (Figures 5D and 5G, from −150 to −50 min). These results indicate that spindle elongation promotes biorientation and enhances its fidelity. The complete kinetochore-tracking datasets allowed us to investigate biorientation systematically for each individual chromosome (Figure 5A; Movie S5 and Movie S6). Analyzing bivalent stretching and alignment at the single-chromosome level revealed that only very few chromosomes achieved biorientation at the first attempt, and the kinetic path taken was very different between individual chromosomes (Figure 5A). The “Red” chromosome, for example, started biorientation and alignment early and gradually as revealed by its slow stretching and early alignment (Figures 5A, 5C, and 5F, from −127 to −28 min, red brackets), eventually leading to stable biorientation in a continuous process over ∼1.5 hr. By contrast, the “Black” chromosome started biorientation only very late (−5 min), stretching abruptly and snapping into a parallel position with the spindle axis (Figures 5A, 5C, and 5F, 4 min, white and black arrowheads), leading to biorientation within less than 20 min. We found that most chromosomes underwent multiple biorientation attempts, indicated by repetitive bivalent stretching/relaxation (Figures 5A and 5C; and Movie S6) and reorientation along the spindle axis (Figure 5F). For example, the “Blue” chromosome showed three biorientation attempts. The first occurred at −45 min, but the bioriented state was lost at 4 min. The second biorientation attempt occurred at 15 min, which however halted transiently at 22 min, and was followed by the third attempt at 35 min (Figures 5A, 5C, and 5F, blue arrowheads), leading to stable biorientation. Overall, 86% of all chromosomes underwent two or more biorientation attempts with a maximum of six and an average of 3.1 ± 1.5 biorientation events per chromosome (Figure 5H, n = 200 from 5 oocytes). Sixty-seven percent of bivalent stretching events collapsed or stalled and were thus not able to establish stable chromosome biorientation. This is most likely due to frequent improper kinetochore-microtubule attachments that would require to be dissolved to be corrected (Nezi and Musacchio, 2009Nezi L. Musacchio A. Sister chromatid tension and the spindle assembly checkpoint.Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2009; 21: 785-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Indeed, we found that some chromosomes rotated between biorientation events, reverting their orientation between spindle poles (Figure S4C), demonstrating that kinetochore-microtubule attachments were lost and reformed. The dynamic nature of kinetochore-microtubule attachments was additionally indicated by the fact that the amplitude of chromosome oscillations along the spindle axis was maximal in phase 3 (Figures S4D–S4F). Together our results demonstrate that chromosome biorientation is unexpectedly error prone in meiosis I. Most chromosomes underwent multiple kinetochore-microtubule attachments that presumably had to be actively corrected before reaching stable biorientation. The frequently observed collapse or stalling of bivalent stretching suggested that kinetochore-microtubule attachments are erroneous. Observation of single kinetochore fibers was not possible in live oocytes due to the very high density of non-kinetochore microtubules in the meiotic spindle. To directly investigate kinetochore-microtubule attachments, we therefore immunostained kinetochores and microtubules after destabilizing dynamic non-kinetochore microtubules with calcium in a fixed cell time course (Figure S5G ). This allowed us to systematically analyze the nature of the kinetochore-microtubule attachment throughout meiosis (Figures 6A and 6B ; and Figure S5H).Figure 6Predominant Improper Kinetochore-Microtubule Attachments in Phase 3Show full caption(A) Oocytes were stained with anti-Tubulin (microtubules, green), CREST (kinetochores, red), and Hoechst 33342 (chromosomes, blue) after brief treatment with a 0.1 mM Ca2+-containing buffer (see Extended Experimental Procedures).

https://openalex.org/W1972989434,"The mechanisms that govern receptor coalescence into functional clusters--often a critical step in their stimulation by ligand--are poorly understood. We used single-molecule tracking to investigate the dynamics of CD36, a clustering-responsive receptor that mediates oxidized LDL uptake by macrophages. We found that CD36 motion in the membrane was spatially structured by the cortical cytoskeleton. A subpopulation of receptors diffused within linear confinement regions whose unique geometry simultaneously facilitated freedom of movement along one axis while increasing the effective receptor density. Co-confinement within troughs enhanced the probability of collisions between unligated receptors and promoted their clustering. Cytoskeleton perturbations that inhibited diffusion in linear confinement regions reduced receptor clustering in the absence of ligand and, following ligand addition, suppressed CD36-mediated signaling and internalization. These observations demonstrate a role for the cytoskeleton in controlling signal transduction by structuring receptor diffusion within membrane regions that increase their collision frequency."

Cells with identical genomes can display distinct gene expression patterns and phenotypes that persist during numerous cell divisions. This capacity is critical for cellular differentiation and for development of multicellular organisms with stable tissues, organs, and morphologies, all of which arise from a single founder cell, the fertilized egg. The distinct gene expression and phenotypic states of genetically identical cells, which develop without change in DNA sequence and persist in the absence of initial inducing signals, are referred to as epigenetic states (Gottschling, 2004Gottschling D.E.

Following establishment during embryogenesis, a variety of mechanisms mediate the epigenetic inheritance of gene expression states. These mechanisms can be broadly divided into trans-acting and cis-acting. The first class relies on positive feedback mechanisms involving diffusible regulatory factors and includes transcription factors, such as the phage lambda repressor (cI) and Cro proteins, and eukaryotic cell type-specific master regulators, such as the fungal Wor1 and mammalian myoD proteins (Lassar et al., 1989Lassar A.B.

The second class of mechanisms involves the cis-maintenance of chromatin modifications or DNA methylation (Beisel and Paro, 2011Beisel C. Paro R. Silencing chromatin: comparing modes and mechanisms.Nat. Rev. Genet. 2011; 12: 123-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar, Margueron and Reinberg, 2010Margueron R. Reinberg D.

Bestor T.H. Bourc'his D. Epigenetic decisions in mammalian germ cells.Science. 2007; 316: 398-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Both types of mechanisms are important for maintenance of gene expression patterns, but genetic studies of heterochromatin in fungi and Drosophila, and embryonic development in Drosophila and mammals, suggest that heritable changes in chromatin structure play profound roles in maintenance of the expression states of master regulators such as the homeobox HOX genes (Beisel and Paro, 2011Beisel C.

Heterochromatin and epigenetic control of gene expression.Science. 2003; 301: 798-802Crossref PubMed Scopus (756) Google Scholar). These studies further indicate that changes in chromatin states are inherited in cis through mitotic and even some meiotic cell divisions (Cavalli and Paro, 1998Cavalli G. Paro R.

Propagating epigenetic states through meiosis: where Mendel's gene is more than a DNA moiety.Trends Genet. 1998; 14: 299-301Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), thus representing systems for inheritance of information that may be as powerful as replication of DNA. Whereas cis-replication of DNA methylation patterns is well understood, models for cis-inheritance of histone modifications that are consistent with the available evidence are lacking. Here I propose models for cis-inheritance of chromatin states that provide an explanation for the observation that in addition to histone modifications, sequence-specific elements such as DNA silencers and noncoding RNA, which mediate the establishment of silent chromatin domains, are also required for the maintenance of such chromatin structures. Current models of chromatin inheritance are based on experimental evidence on the fate of nucleosomal histones following DNA replication. Studies using pulse-chase experiments followed by fractionation to measure chromatin-bound histones strongly suggest that at the bulk level parental histones H3 and H4 do not exchange with newly synthesized H3 and H4 but remain bound to the newly replicated daughter DNA strands (Jackson and Chalkley, 1974Jackson V. Chalkley R. Separation of newly synthesized nucleohistone by equilibrium centrifugation in cesium chloride.Biochemistry. 1974; 13: 3952-3956Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) (Figure 1). These studies and electron microscope images of replicating chromatin further suggest that during DNA replication parental histones are distributed randomly between the two daughter DNA strands (Jackson and Chalkley, 1985Jackson V. Chalkley R. Histone segregation on replicating chromatin.Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 6930-6938Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, Sogo et al., 1986Sogo J.M. Stahl H. Koller T. Knippers R. Structure of replicating simian virus 40 minichromosomes. The replication fork, core histone segregation and terminal structures.J. Mol. Biol. 1986; 189: 189-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). More recently, genome-wide studies in budding yeast using an epitope tag exchange strategy that allows parental histones to be distinguished from newly synthesized ones have defined the patterns of parental histone inheritance, demonstrating histone retention at a gene-specific level (Radman-Livaja et al., 2011Radman-Livaja M. Verzijlbergen K.F. Weiner A. van Welsem T. Friedman N. Rando O.J. van Leeuwen F. Patterns and mechanisms of ancestral histone protein inheritance in budding yeast.PLoS Biol. 2011; 9: e1001075Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Together with extensive evidence on the role of histone posttranslational modifications in the regulation of transcription, these studies have given rise to the proposal that histone modifications can be re-established by complexes that recognize a specific modification on an inherited parental histone and catalyze the same type of modification on adjacent newly deposited nucleosomes (Dodd et al., 2007Dodd I.B.

Crosstalk among histone modifications.Cell. 2008; 135: 604-607Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar) (Figure 1). With some important differences (discussed later), this model is similar to how the maintenance DNA methyltransferase, Dnmt1, is thought to re-establish DNA methylation patterns by preferentially associating with and methylating hemimethylated DNA (Holliday, 1987Holliday R. The inheritance of epigenetic defects.Science. 1987; 238: 163-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (802) Google Scholar, Schaefer et al., 2007Schaefer C.B. Ooi S.K. Bestor T.H. Bourc'his D. Epigenetic decisions in mammalian germ cells.Science. 2007; 316: 398-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). The model requires that histone modifications provide sufficient specificity to directly or indirectly recruit cognate-modifying enzymes and that the kinetics of their erasure is slower than the kinetics of postreplication re-establishment. Although in principle this mechanism based entirely on histones could account for the epigenetic inheritance of chromatin states, experiments in yeast and flies, discussed below, suggest that histone modifications alone are not sufficient for epigenetic inheritance. Silent or heterochromatic DNA domains in eukaryotic organisms ranging from yeast to human share a number of central properties, including their mode of epigenetic inheritance (Beisel and Paro, 2011Beisel C. Paro R. Silencing chromatin: comparing modes and mechanisms.Nat. Rev. Genet. 2011; 12: 123-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar, Grewal and Moazed, 2003Grewal S.I. Moazed D. Heterochromatin and epigenetic control of gene expression.Science. 2003; 301: 798-802Crossref PubMed Scopus (756) Google Scholar). Here I briefly review our current knowledge of how yeast silent chromatin domains are established and maintained and what these studies tell us about epigenetic inheritance. In the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, heterochromatin-like silent chromatin domains occur at the silent mating-type loci (called HM loci) and telomeres (Moazed, 2001Moazed D. Common themes in mechanisms of gene silencing.Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 489-498Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar, Rusche et al., 2003Rusche L.N. Kirchmaier A.L. Rine J. The establishment, inheritance, and function of silenced chromatin in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2003; 72: 481-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (584) Google Scholar). The formation of silent chromatin requires input from three different classes of molecular players (Figure 2A ). The first class is specificity elements. DNA regions, called silencers, direct the assembly of silent chromatin at the HM loci. Silencers are composed of binding sites for two general transcription factors, Rap1 and Abf1, and the origin recognition complex (ORC) (Bell et al., 1993Bell S.P. Kobayashi R. Stillman B.

Purification and cloning of a DNA binding protein from yeast that binds to both silencer and activator elements.Cell. 1987; 51: 721-732Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar). At telomeres, silencing is initiated by tracks of Rap1-binding sites and the chromosome end, which is bound by the Ku70 and Ku80 proteins (Gasser and Cockell, 2001Gasser S.M. Cockell M.M. The molecular biology of the SIR proteins.Gene. 2001; 279: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). Silencer- or telomere-binding proteins act combinatorially to recruit a second class of regulators, the Sir1, Sir2, Sir3, and Sir4 proteins, which spread along the chromatin fiber away from the nucleation site and create modified chromatin domains that are refractory to productive transcription (Moazed, 2001Moazed D.

The Sir2 and Sir4 proteins assemble together into a heterodimer that associates with Sir3 to form the SIR complex (Hoppe et al., 2002Hoppe G.J. Tanny J.C. Rudner A.D. Gerber S.A. Danaie S. Gygi S.P.

The Sir1 protein forms a bridge between silencer-bound ORC and the Sir3 and Sir4 subunits of the SIR complex, which is important for efficient recruitment (Gardner et al., 1999Gardner K.A. Rine J.

Sternglanz R. Role of interactions between the origin recognition complex and SIR1 in transcriptional silencing.Nature. 1996; 381: 251-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar) (Figure 2A). Histones are the third class of regulators. In particular, the conserved N terminus of histone H4 and lysine 16 within this region are critical for silencing (Johnson et al., 1992Johnson L.M. Fisher-Adams G. Grunstein M.

Any model for the mechanism of inheritance must take into account the fact that all three classes of regulators are required for establishment as well as inheritance of the silent state. The SIR complex has three different activities, histone deacetylation, histone binding, and self-association, which play critical roles in establishment and maintenance of silent chromatin. The Sir2 protein is an NAD-dependent deacetylase with preference for histone H4 lysine 16 (H4K16), the H4 residue that is required for silencing (Imai et al., 2000Imai S. Armstrong C.M. Kaeberlein M.

In addition to interactions with H4, Sir3 binds to the globular domain of histone H3, around lysine 79, on the surface of the nucleosome, and methylation of histone H3 lysine 79 (H3K79) antagonizes Sir3 binding (Altaf et al., 2007Altaf M.

In addition to spreading, all of the above activities are also required for efficient binding of the SIR complex to the silencer (Figure 2A) (Hoppe et al., 2002Hoppe G.J. Tanny J.C. Rudner A.D.

Ordered nucleation and spreading of silenced chromatin in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 2207-2222Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). As discussed later, the requirement for the deacetylase activity of Sir2 in efficient binding of the SIR complex to silencers themselves is a key observation because it suggests that efficient recruitment of the SIR complex to silencers involves cooperative interactions between silencer-binding proteins and deacetylated nucleosomes. The histone-based chromatin replication model discussed above provides a possible mechanism for epigenetic inheritance of chromatin states (Figure 1). In the case of budding yeast, silent domains contain several kilobases of DNA-containing nucleosomes with unacetylated H4K16 and unmethylated H3K79. Following DNA replication, recognition of the inherited parental nucleosomes by the SIR complex would mediate deacetylation of the newly deposited histones and leads to the re-establishment of new silent domains (as in Figure 1). This model is, however, not consistent with the continuous requirement for silencers in maintenance of the silent state. Deletion of silencers using inducible site-specific recombination results in rapid loss of the silent state after one cell division, clearly indicating that the modification states of histones cannot be inherited in the absence of input from the silencer (Cheng and Gartenberg, 2000Cheng T.H. Gartenberg M.R. Yeast heterochromatin is a dynamic structure that requires silencers continuously.Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 452-463PubMed Google Scholar, Holmes and Broach, 1996Holmes S.G. Broach J.R. Silencers are required for inheritance of the repressed state in yeast.Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1021-1032Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Here it may be proposed that the silencer acts on its own to re-establish the silent state after every cell division. However, such an entirely silencer-dependent model is not consistent with the epigenetic properties of silent domains. Once assembled, silent chromatin domains display a variegating effect on gene expression that is similar to position effect variegation, first described for the effect of heterochromatin on gene expression in Drosophila (Muller, 1930Muller H.J. Types of visible variations induced by X-rays in Drosophila.J. Genet. 1930; 22: 299-334Crossref Scopus (286) Google Scholar). Yeast cells carrying an ADE2 reporter gene near a telomere or a weakened silencer produce sectored colonies in which the ADE2 gene is either ON (white sectors) or OFF (red sectors) (Figure 2B) (Aparicio et al., 1991Aparicio O.M. Billington B.L. Gottschling D.E. Modifiers of position effect are shared between telomeric and silent mating-type loci in S. cerevisiae.Cell. 1991; 66: 1279-1287Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (598) Google Scholar). This variegation results from stochastic loss and re-establishment of silent chromatin and indicates that following a switch in gene expression, the daughters of the switching cell have a memory of the expression state of the mother cell (Figure 2C). Similar variegating states have been observed at the silent mating-type loci in cells lacking Sir1, suggesting that epigenetic inheritance is a common property of silent domains in yeast (Pillus and Rine, 1989Pillus L. Rine J. Epigenetic inheritance of transcriptional states in S. cerevisiae.Cell. 1989; 59: 637-647Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). There is clearly a memory of the switch between the ON and OFF states that is not stored at the silencer alone, as silencers and silencer-binding proteins do not change in transitions between the ON and OFF lineages. What is the molecular basis of this memory? Before presenting models that explain the requirement for both specificity elements and histone modifications in epigenetic inheritance (see next section), I will briefly review data that support roles for specificity elements in other systems. In the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe, which is estimated to have diverged from S. cerevisiae about 700 million years ago, sequences involved in initiation of heterochromatin are also required for its maintenance. Heterochromatin in S. pombe is found at the pericentromeric DNA repeats, telomeres, and the silent mating-type loci. Although site-specific DNA-binding proteins contribute to heterochromatin formation at fission yeast mating-type loci and telomeres, in pericentromeric heterochromatin, small-interfering RNAs (siRNAs) take the place of DNA-binding proteins as specificity factors. siRNAs are produced from noncoding centromeric RNAs (ncRNAs) and load onto the RNA-induced initiator of transcriptional silencing (RITS) complex (Verdel et al., 2004Verdel A. Jia S. Gerber S. Sugiyama T. Gygi S. Grewal S.I. Moazed D. RNAi-mediated targeting of heterochromatin by the RITS complex.Science. 2004; 303: 672-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (919) Google Scholar, Volpe et al., 2002Volpe T.A. Kidner C. Hall I.M. Teng G.

RITS contains the fission yeast Argonaute protein Ago1, the chromodomain protein Chp1, and the GW domain protein Tas3 and is directed to specific chromosome regions via base-pairing interactions between Ago1-bound siRNAs and nascent noncoding centromeric RNAs (Motamedi et al., 2004Motamedi M.R.

Here, we describe a biochemical assay to detect the acetylation status of proteins and demonstrate that protein N-alpha-acetylation is regulated by the availability of acetyl-CoA. Because the antiapoptotic protein Bcl-xL is known to influence mitochondrial metabolism, we reasoned that Bcl-xL may provide a link between protein N-alpha-acetylation and apoptosis. Indeed, Bcl-xL overexpression leads to a reduction in levels of acetyl-CoA and N-alpha-acetylated proteins in the cell. This effect is independent of Bax and Bak, the known binding partners of Bcl-xL. Increasing cellular levels of acetyl-CoA by addition of acetate or citrate restores protein N-alpha-acetylation in Bcl-xL-expressing cells and confers sensitivity to apoptotic stimuli. We propose that acetyl-CoA serves as a signaling molecule that couples apoptotic sensitivity to metabolism by regulating protein N-alpha-acetylation."
https://openalex.org/W2120019474,"Aspergillus niger is perhaps the most important fungus used in biotechnology, and is also one of the most commonly encountered fungi contaminating foods and feedstuffs, and occurring in soil and indoor environments. Many of its industrial applications have been given GRAS status (generally regarded as safe). However, A. niger has the potential to produce two groups of potentially carcinogenic mycotoxins: fumonisins and ochratoxins. In this study all available industrial and many non-industrial strains of A. niger (180 strains) as well as 228 strains from 17 related black Aspergillus species were examined for mycotoxin production. None of the related 17 species of black Aspergilli produced fumonisins. Fumonisins (B(2), B(4), and B(6)) were detected in 81% of A. niger, and ochratoxin A in 17%, while 10% of the strains produced both mycotoxins. Among the industrial strains the same ratios were 83%, 33% and 26% respectively. Some of the most frequently used strains in industry NRRL 337, 3112 and 3122 produced both toxins and several strains used for citric acid production were among the best producers of fumonisins in pure agar culture. Most strains used for other biotechnological processes also produced fumonisins. Strains optimized through random mutagenesis usually maintained their mycotoxin production capability. Toxigenic strains were also able to produce the toxins on media suggested for citric acid production with most of the toxins found in the biomass, thereby questioning the use of the remaining biomass as animal feed. In conclusion it is recommended to use strains of A. niger with inactive or inactivated gene clusters for fumonisins and ochratoxins, or to choose isolates for biotechnological uses in related non-toxigenic species such as A. tubingensis, A. brasiliensis, A vadensis or A. acidus, which neither produce fumonisins nor ochratoxins."
https://openalex.org/W2103350224,"Infection by coagulase-positive Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) is the most common cause of acute endocarditis, a destructive and progressive condition of heart valves. Here, Peter Panizzi and his colleagues have developed a targeted, noninvasive fluorescence or positron emission technology imaging strategy that uses an engineered analog of prothrombin that can detect S. aureus in vivo in the endocarditic vegetations that form as a result of bacterial colonization. Coagulase-positive Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) is the major causal pathogen of acute endocarditis, a rapidly progressing, destructive infection of the heart valves. Bacterial colonization occurs at sites of endothelial damage, where, together with fibrin and platelets, the bacteria initiate the formation of abnormal growths known as vegetations. Here we report that an engineered analog of prothrombin could be used to detect S. aureus in endocarditic vegetations via noninvasive fluorescence or positron emission tomography (PET) imaging. These prothrombin derivatives bound staphylocoagulase and intercalated into growing bacterial vegetations. We also present evidence for bacterial quorum sensing in the regulation of staphylocoagulase expression by S. aureus. Staphylocoagulase expression was limited to the growing edge of mature vegetations, where it was exposed to the host and co-localized with the imaging probe. When endocarditis was induced with an S. aureus strain with genetic deletion of coagulases, survival of mice improved, highlighting the role of staphylocoagulase as a virulence factor."
https://openalex.org/W2103890520,"Mechanical stress plays an essential role in tissue development and remodeling. In this study, we determined the role of microRNA in chondrocyte mechanotransduction. Using microarray, we identified miR-365 as a mechanoresponsive microRNA in parallel to mechanical induction of Indian hedgehog (Ihh) in primary chicken chondrocytes cultured in 3-dimensional collagen scaffoldings under cyclic loading (1 Hz, 5% elongation). Interestingly, expression of miR-365 is elevated in the prehypertrophic zone of the growth plate, coinciding with the Ihh expression region in vivo. MiR-365 significantly stimulates chondrocyte proliferation and differentiation. MiR-365 increases expression of Ihh and the hypertrophic marker type X collagen, whereas anti-miR-365 inhibits the expression of these genes. We identified histone deacetylase 4 (HDAC4), an inhibitor of chondrocyte hypertrophy, as a target of miR-365. MiR-365 inhibits both endogenous HDAC4 protein levels as well as the activity of a reporter gene bearing the 3'-untranslated region of HDAC4 mRNA. Conversely, inhibition of endogenous miR-365 relieves the repression of HDAC4. Mutation of the miR-365 binding site in HDAC4 mRNA abolishes miR-365-mediated repression of the reporter gene activity. Overexpression of HDAC4 reverses miR-365 stimulation of chondrocyte differentiation markers including Ihh, Col X, and Runx2. Moreover, inhibition of miR-365 abolishes mechanical stimulation of chondrocyte differentiation. Taken together, miR-365 is the first identified mechanically responsive microRNA that regulates chondrocyte differentiation via directly targeting HDAC4."

https://openalex.org/W2138333556,"The acute-phase protein C-reactive protein (CRP) recruits C1q to the surface of damaged cells and thereby initiates complement activation. However, CRP also recruits complement inhibitors, such as C4b-binding protein (C4bp) and factor H, which both block complement progression at the level of C3 and inhibits inflammation. To define how CRP modulates the classic complement pathway, we studied the interaction of CRP with the classic pathway inhibitor C4bp. Monomeric CRP (mCRP), but not pentameric CRP (pCRP), binds C4bp and enhances degradation of C4b and C3b. Both C1q, the initiator, and C4bp, the inhibitor of the classic pathway, compete for mCRP binding, and this competition adjusts the local balance of activation and inhibition. After attachment of pCRP to the surface of necrotic rat myocytes, generation of mCRP was demonstrated over a period of 18 h. Similarly, a biological role for mCRP, C1q, and C4bp in the disease setting of acute myocardial infarction was revealed. In this inflamed tissue, mCRP, pCRP, C4bp, C1q, and C4d were detected in acetone-fixed and in unfixed tissue. Protein levels were enhanced 6 h to 5 d after infarction. Thus, mCRP bound to damaged cardiomyocytes recruits C1q to activate and also C4bp to control the classic complement pathway.—Mihlan, M., Blom, A.

https://openalex.org/W2054520207,"Chronic, heavy alcohol exposure results in inflammation in adipose tissue, insulin resistance, and liver injury. Here we have identified a CYP2E1/Bid/C1q-dependent pathway that is activated in response to chronic ethanol and is required for the development of inflammation in adipose tissue. Ethanol feeding for 25 days to wild-type (C57BL/6J) mice increased expression of multiple markers of adipose tissue inflammation relative to pair-fed controls independent of increased body weight or adipocyte size. Ethanol feeding increased the expression of CYP2E1 in adipocytes, but not stromal vascular cells, in adipose tissue and Cyp2e1−/− mice were protected from adipose tissue inflammation in response to ethanol. Ethanol feeding also increased the number of TUNEL-positive nuclei in adipose tissue of wild-type mice but not in Cyp2e1−/− or Bid −/− mice. Apoptosis contributed to adipose inflammation, as the expression of multiple inflammatory markers was decreased in mice lacking the Bid-dependent apoptotic pathway.

Taken together, these data identify a novel mechanism for the development of adipose tissue inflammation that likely contributes to the pathophysiological effects of ethanol. Adipose tissue, long considered to be a relatively inert tissue that functioned solely as an energy store, is emerging as a key regulatory organ, acting as a component of the immune system as well as secreting a number of proteins regulating metabolism and behavior (1Tilg H. Moschen A.R. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2006; 6: 772-783Crossref PubMed Scopus (2297) Google Scholar). These adipose tissue-derived bioactive substances place adipose tissue at an important nexus in the coordinated regulation of metabolism and immunity. Importantly, many of these cytokines, such as TNFα and IL-6, chemokines, such as monocyte/macrophage chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP-1), 2The abbreviations used are: MCP-1monocyte chemoattractant protein-1C3aRC3a receptorC5aRC5a receptorCYP2E1cytochrome P4502E1. and adipokines, such as adiponectin, also have central roles in the regulation of insulin sensitivity (1Tilg H.

However, the mechanisms by which chronic ethanol feeding leads to adipose tissue inflammation and disrupts adipose metabolism have not been identified. The initiating signals for adipose inflammation in response to ethanol is likely distinct from the early signals leading to adipose tissue inflammation in obesity, as ethanol feeding does not increase adiposity or body weight compared with controls (5Kang L. Chen X. Sebastian B.M. Pratt B.T. Bederman I.R. Alexander J.C. Previs S.F. Nagy L.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 28465-28473Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Many of the pathophysiological effects of ethanol are dependent on ethanol metabolism, particularly via cytochrome P4502E1 (CYP2E1). CYP2E1 is induced in response to chronic exposure to high concentrations of ethanol; expression of CYP2E1 is greatest in the liver, but expression is also increased in adipose tissue of rats after ethanol feeding (4Chen X. Sebastian B.M. Tang H. McMullen M.M. Axhemi A. Jacobsen D.W. Nagy L.E. Hepatology. 2009; 49: 1554-1562Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Induction of CYP2E1 is associated with increased cellular death by apoptosis and necrosis in the liver during ethanol exposure (12Lu Y. Cederbaum A.I. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2008; 44: 723-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (552) Google Scholar). Apoptosis is a complex, caspase-dependent cell death mechanism mediated by two distinct pathways called the extrinsic (death receptor-mediated) and the intrinsic (mitochondria-mediated) pathways. Interaction of the death receptors (TNFα receptor or Fas) with their respective ligands initiates the extrinsic pathway, whereas mitochondrial dysfunction triggers the intrinsic pathway. Bid is a key pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family member that is crucial for the induction of apoptotic death and serves as a bridge between these two fundamental cell death pathways. Bid-dependent apoptosis in adipose tissue is important in the development of inflammation in models of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis and is associated with the subsequent development of insulin resistance and hepatic steatosis (13Alkhouri N. Gornicka A. Berk M.P. Thapaliya S. Dixon L.J. Kashyap S. Schauer P.R. Feldstein A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 3428-3438Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). Although early studies in cultured cells suggested that apoptosis does not elicit strong inflammatory responses, instead mediating a “silent clean-up” of dead cells (14Kurosaka K. Takahashi M. Watanabe N. Kobayashi Y. J. Immunol. 2003; 171: 4672-4679Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar), more recent data from in vivo models implicates apoptotic cells as strong inducers of inflammatory responses in a number of pathophysiological conditions (15Green D.R. Ferguson T. Zitvogel L. Kroemer G. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2009; 9: 353-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (780) Google Scholar). The mechanistic link between apoptosis and inflammation is not well understood, although there is a growing body of evidence indicating that complement may be involved in inflammatory responses evoked by apoptotic cells (16Mevorach D. Apoptosis. 2010; 15: 1114-1123Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 17Trouw L.A. Blom A.M. Gasque P. Mol. Immunol. 2008; 45: 1199-1207Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Complement is an ancient component of the innate immune response and is involved in protection from bacterial infections as well as tissue repair in response to injury (18Walport M.J. N. Engl. J. Med. 2001; 344: 1058-1066Crossref PubMed Scopus (2339) Google Scholar). Complement is activated via three pathways, the classical, lectin, and alternative. The classical pathway of complement is activated upon the binding of C1q, the recognition subunit of C1, to immune complexes or via interactions with cell surface markers on apoptotic cell (16Mevorach D. Apoptosis. 2010; 15: 1114-1123Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 17Trouw L.A. Blom A.M. Gasque P. Mol. Immunol. 2008; 45: 1199-1207Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). The recognition molecules for C1q on the surface of the apoptotic cells are not clearly defined but likely include phosphatidylserine, surface blebs, and/or nucleic acids on the cell surface. C1q binds apoptotic cells with its globular head domain and can then serve as a bridging molecule, interacting with receptors on the surface of macrophages with its collagenous tail and stimulating phagocytosis of apoptotic cells (16Mevorach D. Apoptosis. 2010; 15: 1114-1123Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 17Trouw L.A. Blom A.M. Gasque P. Mol. Immunol. 2008; 45: 1199-1207Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Adipose tissue produces C3, factor B, and factor D, essential components for the alternative pathway of activation, as well as properdin, several complement receptors, and regulatory proteins (19Pattrick M. Luckett J. Yue L. Stover C. Mol. Immunol. 2009; 46: 755-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The C3a receptor was recently identified as a key determinant of insulin resistance and adipose tissue inflammation in diet-induced obesity in mice (20Mamane Y. Chung Chan C. Lavallee G. Morin N.

Here we have tested the hypothesis that ethanol metabolism via CYP2E1 is linked to the development adipose tissue inflammation via Bid-dependent apoptosis and the subsequent activation of complement. Making use of genetically manipulated mice, we have identified the pathophysiologically relevant sequence of events in adipose tissue during chronic ethanol exposure that leads to inflammation; ethanol induces CYP2E1 expression, leading to increased Bid-dependent apoptosis in adipose tissue, activation of complement via C1q in the classical pathway, and increased production of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines in adipose tissue. All procedures using mice were approved by the Cleveland Clinic Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Female C57BL/6J (wild type) and C3−/− mice were purchased from The Jackson Laboratory. Breeding pairs for the following strains were used to establish colonies at the Cleveland Clinic. C1qa−/− and C4a−/− mice were provided by M. Carroll and have been previously described (C1qa−/− mice (21Botto M. Dell'Agnola C. Bygrave A.E. Thompson E.M. Cook H.T. Petry F. Loos M. Pandolfi P.P. Walport M.J. Nat.

(Bethlehem, PA) containing ethanol or isocalorically substituted maltose dextrins, as previously described (27Cohen J.I. Roychowdhury S. McMullen M.R. Stavitsky A.B. Nagy L.E. Gastroenterology. 2010; 139: 664-674Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). After adjusting to the control liquid diet for 2 days, the ethanol-fed group was given a liquid diet containing 1% vol:vol ethanol (5.5% total kcal) for 2 days (data reported as d2), 2% (11% total kcal) for 2 days (d4), 4% (22% total kcal) for 1 week (d11), 5% (27% total kcal) for 1 week (d18), and finally 6% (32% total kcal) for 1 week (d25). Measures of ethanol metabolism were determined in response to an acute challenge with ethanol via gavage. Ethanol-naïve mice 6–8 weeks old were fasted 16–18 h and then exposed to 6 g/kg ethanol (in saline) via an intragastric gavage (acute gavage). After 90 min, blood samples were taken from the saphenous vein into heparinized hematocrit tubes. Plasma was isolated and then stored at −80 °C. Plasma ethanol concentrations (Table 1) were determined using an Ethanol L3K Assay kit (Genzyme Diagnostics; Framingham, MA) following the manufacturer's instructions.TABLE 1Characteristics of miceGenotypePair-fedEtOH-fedInitial body weight (g)Final body weight (g)Initial body weight (g)Final body weight (g)Average daily food intakeAcute gavage: Plasma EtOHggggml/g body wtmmC57BL/6J17.6 ± 0.322.5 ± 1.218.6 ± 0.622.4 ± 1.11.2 ± 0.1104.7 ± 5.1C1qa−/−16.7 ± 0.521.4 ± 0.517.5 ± 0.520.1 ± 0.61.1 ± 0.199.1 ± 12.3C4a−/−16.9 ± 0.719.1 ± 1.317.1 ± 0.519.6 ± 0.51.3 ± 0.1104.2 ± 6.0Mbl/Cfd−/−16.6 ± 0.319.1 ± 0.216.9 ± 0.220.2 ± 0.51.1 ± 0.196.5 ± 4.2Cyp2e1−/−18.2 ± 0.618.0 ± 0.318.5 ± 0.417.6 ± 0.71.1 ± 0.0NDBid−/−18.0 ± 1.019.8 ± 0.719.2 ± 0.520.9 ± 0.51.0 ± 0.0ND Open table in a new tab Characteristics of the mice (initial and final body weights, food intake, and measures of ethanol metabolism) are shown in Table 1. At the time of euthanasia, mice were anesthetized, gonadal adipose tissue, liver, and blood were harvested and either frozen in liquid nitrogen for protein analysis, fixed in formalin for histology, placed in RNA Later for mRNA analysis, or used for the isolation of adipocytes and stromal vascular cells. Blood was drawn from mice via the saphenous vein (without anesthesia) using Microvette CB300 EDTA-coated capillary collection tubes and placed on ice. Plasma was collected by centrifugation for 2.5 min at 10,000 × g and transferred into a 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tube containing 1.2 μl of 0.5 m EDTA (for a final EDTA concentration of 20 mm). Samples were immediately denatured in Laemmli buffer for Western blot analysis and then stored at −80 °C. Plasma collected without added EDTA was treated with 2 mg/ml zymosan (28Pritchard M.T.

Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded adipose tissue samples were stained with hematoxylin and eosin or de-paraffinized and used for immunohistochemistry and TUNEL staining. Immunoreactive C3b/iC3b/C3c (collectively termed “C3b” here) was detected with an antibody against neo-epitopes revealed upon C3 cleavage (Hycult Biotech; Canton, MA), as described (29Roychowdhury S.

TUNEL was visualized using the ApopTag plus In Situ Apoptosis Detection kit (S7165 for rhodamine staining; Chemicon International, Temecula, CA) following the manufacturer's instructions. Adipose tissue harvested from pair- and ethanol-fed mice was digested in collagenase (30Sebastian B.M. Kang L. Chen X. Nagy L.E. Methods Mol. Biol. 2008; 447: 357-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). The resulting cell suspension was filtered through coarse mesh and centrifuged at 233 × g for 1 min to separate adipocytes from stromal vascular cells. Frozen adipose tissue (0.2 g of fat/ml), or cell fractions were lysed and processed for Western blot analysis, as previously described (4Chen X. Sebastian B.M. Tang H. McMullen M.M. Axhemi A. Jacobsen D.W. Nagy L.E. Hepatology. 2009; 49: 1554-1562Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Microsomes were isolated for frozen adipose tissue for CYP2E1 activity assays, as previously described (4Chen X. Sebastian B.M. Tang H. McMullen M.M. Axhemi A. Jacobsen D.W. Nagy L.E. Hepatology. 2009; 49: 1554-1562Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Lysate (20 μg protein) or plasma (0.5 μl) samples were loaded onto 8% reducing SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Antibodies C3 (used for the detection of C3d at ∼40 kDa) were from MP Biomedicals, LLC; Solon, OH, CYP2E1 was from Abcam, and HSC70 (used as a loading control for Western blots of tissue samples) was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc). Immunoreactive proteins were visualized using enhanced chemiluminescence, images were collected, and signal intensities were quantified using Eastman Kodak Co. Image Station 4000R. One hundred microliters of microsomal protein isolated from adipose tissue or liver was used to measure CYP2E1 activity (31Wu D. Cederbaum A.I. Methods Mol. Biol. 2008; 447: 137-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Total RNA was isolated from adipose tissue using the RNeasy lipid tissue mini kit following the manufacturer's instructions. Total RNA was reverse-transcribed using the RETROscript kit (Ambion). Real-time PCR amplification was performed using the SYBR Green PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems) in an Mx3000p PCR machine, as previously described (4Chen X. Sebastian B.M. Tang H. McMullen M.M.

Values reported are the means ± S.E. Data were analyzed using Student's t test or general linear models procedure followed by least square means testing (SAS Institute, Cary, IN). After chronic ethanol feeding to mice, multiple markers characteristic of adipose tissue inflammation were apparent after 18–25 days of ethanol feeding. First, crown-like structures were observed in ethanol-fed but not pair-fed mice (Fig. 1A). Second, expression of mRNA for TNFα, IL-6, and MCP-1 (Fig. 1B) and CD11c (Fig. 1C) was increased in ethanol-fed relative to pair-fed controls after 25 days, but not 18 days, of ethanol feeding. Expression of CD11c by adipose macrophages is associated with adipose inflammation in models of metabolic syndrome (32Patsouris D. Li P.P. Thapar D. Chapman J. Olefsky J.M. Neels J.G. Cell Metab. 2008; 8: 301-309Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (595) Google Scholar). Finally, expression of multiple members of the complement system, C1q, C3, C3aR, and C5aR, was increased in adipose tissue in response to 25 days of ethanol feeding (Fig. 1D). mRNA expression for cytokines and complement proteins provide a measure of local production by adipose tissue independent of possible systemic changes in the quantity of these secreted proteins. The mechanisms for adipose tissue inflammation after chronic ethanol feeding are likely distinct from adipose tissue inflammation in models of obesity, as chronic ethanol feeding did not increase body weight over pair-fed controls (see Table 1) or affect adipocyte size when compared with pair-fed control mice (Fig. 1A). Instead, we hypothesized that ethanol metabolism via inducible CYP2E1 contributes to chronic ethanol-induced inflammation in adipose tissue. CYP2E1 protein was increased in adipose tissue from days 11 to 25 of ethanol feeding (Fig. 2A) before the appearance of inflammatory markers in adipose. This increase in protein was associated with increased CYP2E1 enzymatic activity, assayed in microsomes isolated from adipose tissue (Fig. 2B). Activity of CYP2E1 in liver microsomes was 10–15-fold higher than that observed in adipose tissue (data not shown). CYP2E1 was predominantly expressed in adipocytes and not stromal vascular cells (SVC) in the adipose tissue (Fig. 2C). If CYP2E1 was important in the development of adipose tissue inflammation during ethanol feeding, then mice deficient in CYP2E1 should be protected from ethanol-induced inflammation in adipose tissue. Wild-type and Cyp2e1−/− mice were allowed free access to the ethanol containing diet for 25 days or pair-fed control diets. Although ethanol feeding increased the expression of mRNA for TNFα, IL-6, MCP-1, C1q, C3aR, and C5aR, these responses were ameliorated in Cyp2e1−/− mice (Fig. 2D). Elevated expression of CYP2E1 is associated with oxidative stress and apoptotic cell death in a number of model systems (12Lu Y. Cederbaum A.I. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2008; 44: 723-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (552) Google Scholar). Chronic ethanol feeding increased the number of TUNEL-positive cells in the adipose tissue of wild-type mice but not Cyp2e1−/− mice (Fig. 2E). In a high fat diet induced model of obesity in mice, Bid-dependent apoptosis mediates adipose tissue inflammation (13Alkhouri N. Gornicka A. Berk M.P. Thapaliya S. Dixon L.J. Kashyap S. Schauer P.R. Feldstein A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 3428-3438Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). Therefore, we hypothesized that chronic ethanol feeding could lead to Bid-dependent apoptosis in adipose tissue and, thus, contribute to adipose tissue inflammation. Chronic ethanol feeding increased the number of TUNEL-positive nuclei in adipose tissue from wild-type, but not Bid−/− mice, at 25 days (Fig. 3A). Multiple markers of inflammation, including expression of IL-6, MCP-1, and CD11c mRNA, in adipose tissue were normalized in Bid−/− mice (Fig. 3B). In contrast, expression of mRNA for C3aR and C5aR was only partially attenuated, and the expression of mRNA for TNFα remained elevated (Fig. 3B). Chronic ethanol feeding increased CYP2E1 protein in the Bid−/− mice (data not shown). Taken together, these data suggest that CYP2E1 was sufficient for increased expression of TNFα, C3aR, and C5aR mRNA in adipose tissue in response to chronic ethanol but that Bid-dependent apoptosis contributed to an exacerbation of adipose tissue inflammation. We next determined whether chronic ethanol feeding increased complement activation in adipose tissue. Ethanol feeding increased the quantity of immunoreactive C3d, an indicator of complement activation, by d18 and d25 of ethanol feeding in adipose tissue lysates (Fig. 4A) and plasma (Fig. 4B) compared with pair-fed control mice. C3b deposition was also detected in adipose tissue by immunohistochemistry at d18 and d25 of ethanol feeding (Fig. 4C). Importantly, C3b deposition in adipose tissue was not observed in Cyp2e1−/− or Bid−/− mice (Fig. 4D), indicating that ethanol-induced apoptosis occurred up-stream of complement activation in response to ethanol feeding. Expression of mRNA for factors in the complement pathway, including C1q and C3aR, were not affected among genotypes (data not shown). Furthermore, complement activation in adipose tissue, evident by d18, preceded the increase in inflammatory cytokines and chemokines at d25. Making use of mice deficient in C1q (C1qa−/−, lacking the classical pathway of complement activation), C4 (C4−/−, lacking classical and lectin pathways), or complement factor D (Cfd−/−, lacking the alternative pathway), we investigated whether complement activation was required for ethanol-induced adipose tissue inflammation as well as which pathway(s) of complement activation was involved in the response to chronic ethanol in adipose tissue. Expression of TNFα, IL-6, and MCP-1 mRNA was increased in adipose tissue from wild-type mice after ethanol feeding compared with pair-fed controls (Fig. 5A). Mice deficient in C1q or C4 were protected from ethanol-induced increases in IL-6 and MCP-1 mRNA in adipose tissue (Fig. 5A). In contrast, expression of IL-6 and MCP-1 did not differ between wild-type and Cfd−/− mice after ethanol feeding (Fig. 5A). Ethanol feeding to C1q-deficient mice increased CYP2E1 protein expression (data not shown) and TUNEL-positive nuclei (Fig. 5B) in adipose tissue as well as TNFα (Fig. 5A) and C3aR and C5aR mRNA expression (Fig. 5C). If C1q was sufficient to mediate ethanol-induced inflammation in response to ethanol, then mice deficient in both MBLa/c and complement factor D (MBLa/c/Cfd−/−), lacking both functional lectin and alternative pathways, should be sensitive to ethanol exposure. MBLa/c/Cfd−/− mice were not protected from ethanol-induced increases in TNFα, IL-6 or MCP-1 mRNA (Fig. 5D). Taken together, these data suggest a necessary and sufficient role for the classical pathway in ethanol-induced expression of IL-6 and MCP-1 mRNA in adipose tissue. Although studies of the pathophysiological effects of obesity reveal that adipose tissue inflammation plays a role in the development of non-alcoholic fatty liver and steatohepatitis and metabolic syndrome, the interaction between adipose tissue and alcoholic liver disease has not been well studied. Here we find that multiple markers of inflammation are detected in adipose tissue after chronic ethanol feeding. The development of adipose tissue inflammation in obese animals is associated with an increase in body weight and adipocyte size (33Wellen K.E. Hotamisligil G.S. J. Clin. Invest. 2003; 112: 1785-1788Crossref PubMed Scopus (1402) Google Scholar). In contrast, ethanol feeding is not associated with increased body weight, adiposity, or adipocyte size (3Kang L. Sebastian B.M. Pritchard M.T. Pratt B.T. Previs S.F. Nagy L.E. Alcohol Clin. Exp. Res. 2007; 31: 1581-1588Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 5Kang L. Chen X. Sebastian B.M. Pratt B.T. Bederman I.R. Alexander J.C. Previs S.F. Nagy L.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 28465-28473Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), suggesting that adipose inflammation in response to ethanol is initiated via a mechanism(s) distinct from those involved in obesity-induced adipose inflammation. Ethanol metabolism via CYP2E1 increases oxidative stress and is a well studied contributor to alcoholic liver disease (12Lu Y. Cederbaum A.I. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2008; 44: 723-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (552) Google Scholar). CYP2E1 expression was increased in adipose tissue during ethanol feeding and was critical to the development of inflammation in adipose tissue in mice. Increased expression and activity of CYP2E1 in adipose tissue led to an increase in Bid-dependent apoptosis, activation of complement via C1q, and increased inflammation during ethanol feeding. Taken together, these data elucidate a novel mechanism for adipose tissue inflammation (summarized in Fig. 6). Ethanol exposure is associated with the development of oxidant stress in a number of tissues (12Lu Y. Cederbaum A.I. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2008; 44: 723-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (552) Google Scholar) including adipose tissue (3Kang L. Sebastian B.M. Pritchard M.T. Pratt B.T. Previs S.F. Nagy L.E. Alcohol Clin. Exp. Res. 2007; 31: 1581-1588Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 4Chen X. Sebastian B.M. Tang H. McMullen M.M. Axhemi A. Jacobsen D.W. Nagy L.E. Hepatology. 2009; 49: 1554-1562Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). In the liver, ethanol-induced oxidant stress is due at least in part to ethanol metabolism via CYP2E1 (12Lu Y. Cederbaum A.I. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2008; 44: 723-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (552) Google Scholar). Although white adipose tissue has negligible alcohol dehydrogenase activity (34Kortelainen M.L. Huttunen P. Hirvonen J. Alcohol. 1991; 8: 151-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar), CYP2E1 mRNA and protein are expressed in adipose tissue (35Yoshinari K. Sato T. Okino N. Sugatani J. Miwa M. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2004; 311: 147-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) and can be induced by chronic ethanol exposure (4Chen X. Sebastian B.M. Tang H. McMullen M.M. Axhemi A. Jacobsen D.W. Nagy L.E. Hepatology. 2009; 49: 1554-1562Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Here we also show that chronic ethanol feeding increases CYP2E1 activity in adipose tissue (Fig. 2). CYP2E1 protein was detected primarily in adipocytes and not stromal vascular cells. Making use of Cyp2e1−/− mice, we found that CYP2E1 expression was required for ethanol-induced apoptosis as well as increased expression of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines in adipose tissue. These data suggest that ethanol metabolism via CYP2E1 expressed in adipocytes was the initiating event in adipose tissue inflammation during ethanol feeding. Increased production of reactive oxygen species during ethanol metabolism via CYP2E1 could directly lead to increased inflammatory cytokine expression via activation of redox-sensitive transcription factors (36Cohen J.I. Chen X. Nagy L.E. Antioxid. Redox Signal. 2011; 15: 523-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Alternatively, apoptosis of adipocytes in response to activation of cell death pathways could indirectly link CYP2E1 activity to inflammatory responses (13Alkhouri N. Gornicka A. Berk M.P. Thapaliya S. Dixon L.J. Kashyap S. Schauer P.R. Feldstein A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 3428-3438Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). Mice deficient in Bid were protected from both ethanol-induced apoptosis and increased expression of most inflammatory markers in adipose tissue. Only expression of TNF-α mRNA remained elevated in Bid-deficient mice, suggesting that, of the markers of inflammation measured, only TNF-α mRNA expression was directly influenced by CYP2E1. These data are similar to the role for Bid-dependent apoptosis in mediating adipose tissue inflammation in the high fat diet-induced obesity model of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (13Alkhouri N. Gornicka A. Berk M.P. Thapaliya S. Dixon L.J. Kashyap S. Schauer P.R. Feldstein A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 3428-3438Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). However, it is not known whether CYP2E1 is also involved in Bid-dependent adipose tissue inflammation in models of obesity. Clearance of apoptotic cells can be a strong signal for induction of inflammatory responses (13Alkhouri N. Gornicka A. Berk M.P. Thapaliya S. Dixon L.J. Kashyap S. Schauer P.R. Feldstein A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 3428-3438Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar, 15Green D.R. Ferguson T. Zitvogel L. Kroemer G. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2009; 9: 353-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (780) Google Scholar). Crown-like structures are thought to be composed of dead/dying adipocytes surrounded by macrophages and other inflammatory cells; these inflammatory cells scavenge lipids from the adipocyte in a process analogous to formation of atherosclerotic foam cells (37Lumeng C.N. DelProposto J.B. Westcott D.J. Saltiel A.R. Diabetes. 2008; 57: 3239-3246Crossref PubMed Scopus (620) Google Scholar). Complement proteins C1q and C3b act as opsonins to facilitate the clearance of apoptotic cell bodies, thus activating the complement cascade and initiating inflammatory responses (16Mevorach D. Apoptosis. 2010; 15: 1114-1123Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 17Trouw L.A. Blom A.M. Gasque P. Mol. Immunol. 2008; 45: 1199-1207Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Our recent work has identified a critical link between ethanol-induced apoptosis in liver and complement activation via C1q (27Cohen J.I. Roychowdhury S. McMullen M.R. Stavitsky A.B. Nagy L.E. Gastroenterology. 2010; 139: 664-674Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar); similar links between neuronal apoptosis, C1q, and inflammation are found in some murine models of Alzheimer disease (38Tenner A.J. Fonseca M.I. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 2006; 586: 153-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Interestingly, C1q can also play a protective role in models of Alzheimer disease by inhibiting LPS-stimulated cytokine expression (39Fraser D.A. Laust A.K. Nelson E.L. Tenner A.J. J. Immunol. 2009; 183: 6175-6185Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). This differential response appears to be related both to the stage of apoptosis, with late apoptotic cells generating a stronger inflammatory signal as well as the differentiation state of the phagocytic cell interacting with the C1q-opsonized cell (39Fraser D.A. Laust A.K. Nelson E.L. Tenner A.J. J. Immunol. 2009; 183: 6175-6185Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Binding of C1q to calreticulin is also linked to the induction of an immunogenic response to apoptotic cells (16Mevorach D. Apoptosis. 2010; 15: 1114-1123Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). In models of obesity-induced adipose tissue inflammation, macrophages exhibit a characteristic pattern of increased expression of F4/80, CD11b, and CD11c (40Lumeng C.N. Deyoung S.M. Bodzin J.L. Saltiel A.R. Diabetes. 2007; 56: 16-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (747) Google Scholar), shifting the macrophage polarization from alternatively activated (M2) to classically activated (M1) (41Lumeng C.N. Bodzin J.L. Saltiel A.R. J. Clin. Invest. 2007; 117: 175-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (3205) Google Scholar). M1 macrophages expressing CD11c are particularly important for the development of metabolic syndrome (32Patsouris D. Li P.P. Thapar D. Chapman J. Olefsky J.M. Neels J.G. Cell Metab. 2008; 8: 301-309Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (595) Google Scholar). After chronic ethanol feeding, CD11c expression, but not F4/80 or CD11b, was increased. These data suggest a strong proinflammatory milieu after ethanol feeding but clearly indicate that there are differences in the immune mileau in adipose tissue after chronic ethanol compared with diet-induced obesity. Given the influence of macrophage phenotype on the interaction between C1q and apoptotic cells observed in mouse brain (39Fraser D.A. Laust A.K. Nelson E.L. Tenner A.J. J. Immunol. 2009; 183: 6175-6185Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar), it will be interesting in future studies to compare the role of C1q in mediating obesity-induced versus ethanol-induced adipose tissue inflammation, particularly in relation to the phenotypic characteristics of the innate immune cells present in adipose tissue. Although adipose tissue expresses a number of proteins in the complement pathway, the exact role of complement in adipose tissue and its relationship to innate immune responses continues to unfold. Complement appears to make fundamental contributions to the maintenance of normal biological function of adipose as well as contribute to local and systemic immune responses (19Pattrick M. Luckett J. Yue L. Stover C. Mol. Immunol. 2009; 46: 755-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Here we find for the first time that complement was activated in adipose tissue in response to ethanol feeding, evidenced by the accumulation of two C3 cleavage products, C3b and C3d, in adipose tissue from mice after ethanol feeding. Complement activation was dependent on the expression of CYP2E1 and Bid but preceded the appearance of most markers of inflammation in adipose tissue during ethanol exposure. Importantly, C1q and the classical pathway of complement activation were found to have a necessary and sufficient role in adipose tissue inflammation in response to ethanol, thus providing a critical link between adipocyte apoptosis in response to ethanol and increased inflammatory responses. C1q is implicated in several chronic inflammatory diseases, typically associated with the clearance of dying cells, such as systemic lupus erythematosus (16Mevorach D.

Although multiple markers of ethanol-induced inflammation in adipose tissue were dependent on Bid-C1q, increased expression of TNFα and the anaphylatoxin receptors C3aR and C5aR was solely dependent on the expression of CYP2E1. These data suggest that this CYP2E1-dependent increase in C3aR and C5aR would act to enhance the sensitivity of adipose to complement activation and, thus, exacerbate inflammatory responses to complement activation. Pathophysiological changes in the metabolic and innate immune activity of adipose tissue can lead to the development of insulin resistance and hepatic steatosis in alcoholic liver disease and metabolic syndrome/non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (2Tilg H.

Here we have identified a novel pathway for the development of adipose tissue inflammation in response to chronic ethanol. This pathway links the critical ethanol-metabolizing enzyme, CYP2E1, with apoptosis in adipose tissue. Apoptotic cells in adipose are immunogenic, leading to the activation of complement via C1q and the classical pathway and subsequent production of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. Elucidation of this pathway in adipose tissue suggests novel therapeutic approaches to preventing and/or reversing the pathophysiological effects of ethanol."
https://openalex.org/W2063874036,"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is capable of disrupting different facets of lipid metabolism and lipids have been shown to play a crucial role in the viral life cycle. The aim of this study was to examine the effect HCV infection has on the hepatocyte metabolome. Huh-7.5 cells were infected using virus produced by the HCV J6/JFH1 cell culture system and cells were harvested 24, 48, and 72-hours following infection. Metabolic profiling was performed using a non-targeted multiple platform methodology combining ultrahigh performance liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC/MS/MS2) and gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS). There was a significant increase in a number of metabolites involved in nucleotide synthesis and RNA replication during early HCV infection. NAD levels were also significantly increased along with several amino acids. A number of lipid metabolic pathways were disrupted by HCV infection, resulting in an increase in cholesterol and sphingolipid levels, altered phospholipid metabolism and a possible disruption in mitochondrial fatty acid transport. Fluctuations in 5′-methylthioadenosine levels were also noted, along with alterations in the glutathione synthesis pathway. These results highlight a number of previously unreported metabolic interactions and give a more in depth insight into the effect HCV has on host cell biochemical processes."
https://openalex.org/W2073713735,"It is known that small and large numbers facilitate left/right respectively (the SNARC effect). Recently, it has been proposed that numerical magnitude is just one example of a range of quantities, which have a common cognitive/neural representation. To investigate this proposition, response congruency effects were explored for stimuli which differed according to their: (a) numerical size, (b) physical size, (c) luminance, (d) conceptual size and (e) auditory intensity. In a series of experiments, groups of undergraduate participants made two-alternative forced choice discriminations with their left or right hands. There were clear interactions between magnitude and responding hand whereby right hand responses were faster for stimuli with (a) large numbers, (b) large physical size, (c) low luminance, and (d) a reference to large objects. There was no congruency effect for the auditory stimuli. The data demonstrate that the response congruency effect observed for numbers also occurs for a variety of other non-numerical visual quantities. These results support models of general magnitude representation and suggest that the association between magnitude and the left/right sides of space may not be related to culture and/or directional reading habits."
https://openalex.org/W2095619798,"The global prevalence of severe Clostridium difficile infection highlights the profound clinical significance of clostridial glucosylating toxins. Virulence is dependent on the autoactivation of a toxin cysteine protease, which is promoted by the allosteric cofactor inositol hexakisphosphate (InsP(6)). Host mechanisms that protect against such exotoxins are poorly understood. It is increasingly appreciated that the pleiotropic functions attributed to nitric oxide (NO), including host immunity, are in large part mediated by S-nitrosylation of proteins. Here we show that C. difficile toxins are S-nitrosylated by the infected host and that S-nitrosylation attenuates virulence by inhibiting toxin self-cleavage and cell entry. Notably, InsP(6)- and inositol pyrophosphate (InsP(7))-induced conformational changes in the toxin enabled host S-nitrosothiols to transnitrosylate the toxin catalytic cysteine, which forms part of a structurally conserved nitrosylation motif. Moreover, treatment with exogenous InsP(6) enhanced the therapeutic actions of oral S-nitrosothiols in mouse models of C. difficile infection. Allostery in bacterial proteins has thus been successfully exploited in the evolutionary development of nitrosothiol-based innate immunity and may provide an avenue to new therapeutic approaches."
https://openalex.org/W1987513128,"Senescence in plants involves massive nutrient relocation and age-related cell death. Characterization of the molecular components, such as transcription factors (TFs), involved in these processes is required to understand senescence. We found that HvNAC005 and HvNAC013 of the plant-specific NAC (NAM, ATAF1,2, CUC) TF family are up-regulated during senescence in barley (Hordeum vulgare). Both HvNAC005 and HvNAC013 bound the conserved NAC DNA target sequence. Computational and biophysical analyses showed that both proteins are intrinsically disordered in their large C-terminal domains, which are transcription regulatory domains (TRDs) in many NAC TFs. Using motif searches and interaction studies in yeast we identified an evolutionarily conserved sequence, the LP motif, in the TRD of HvNAC013. This motif was sufficient for transcriptional activity. In contrast, HvNAC005 did not function as a transcriptional activator suggesting that an involvement of HvNAC013 and HvNAC005 in senescence will be different. HvNAC013 interacted with barley radical-induced cell death 1 (RCD1) via the very C-terminal part of its TRD, outside of the region containing the LP motif. No significant secondary structure was induced in the HvNAC013 TRD upon interaction with RCD1. RCD1 also interacted with regions dominated by intrinsic disorder in TFs of the MYB and basic helix-loop-helix families. We propose that RCD1 is a regulatory protein capable of interacting with many different TFs by exploiting their intrinsic disorder. In addition, we present the first structural characterization of NAC C-terminal domains and relate intrinsic disorder and sequence motifs to activity and protein-protein interactions."
https://openalex.org/W2059599650,"Ewing's sarcoma family tumors (ESFT) are the second most common bone malignancy in children and young adults, characterized by unique chromosomal translocations that in 85% of cases lead to expression of the EWS-FLI-1 fusion protein. EWS-FLI-1 functions as an aberrant transcription factor that can both induce and suppress members of its target gene repertoire. We have recently demonstrated that EWS-FLI-1 can alter microRNA (miRNA) expression and that miRNA145 is a direct EWS-FLI-1 target whose suppression is implicated in ESFT development. Here, we use miRNA arrays to compare the global miRNA expression profile of human mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) and ESFT cell lines, and show that ESFT display a distinct miRNA signature that includes induction of the oncogenic miRNA 17–92 cluster and repression of the tumor suppressor let-7 family. We demonstrate that direct repression of let-7a by EWS-FLI-1 participates in the tumorigenic potential of ESFT cells in vivo. The mechanism whereby let-7a expression regulates ESFT growth is shown to be mediated by its target gene HMGA2, as let-7a overexpression and HMGA2 repression both block ESFT cell tumorigenicity. Consistent with these observations, systemic delivery of synthetic let-7a into ESFT-bearing mice restored its expression in tumor cells, decreased HMGA2 expression levels and resulted in ESFT growth inhibition in vivo. Our observations provide evidence that deregulation of let-7a target gene expression participates in ESFT development and identify let-7a as promising new therapeutic target for one of the most aggressive pediatric malignancies."
https://openalex.org/W2141783813,"The BMI1 gene is overexpressed in ≈ 90% of human neuroblastomas. However, little is known about the regulation of BMI1 expression. Using microarray and immunohistochemical analysis, we show that BMI1 expression correlated with MYCN levels in MYCN-amplified human neuroblastomas, and with MYC levels in the MYCN-nonamplified group. We further demonstrated that BMI1 is a direct target gene of MYCN/MYC in 3 neuroblastoma cell lines: BE (2)-C, LAN1, and SH-SY5Y. Overexpression of MYCN or MYC transactivated the BMI1 promoter and up-regulated BMI1 gene expression. shRNA-mediated knockdown of MYCN or MYC decreased BMI1 gene expression. Chromatin immunoprecipitation and point-mutation assays revealed that both MYCN and MYC bind to the E-box within the BMI1 promoter. Overexpression of BMI1, MYCN, and MYC independently increased both cell proliferation and tumor growth. Conversely, specific inhibition of BMI1, MYCN, and MYC decreased tumor cell proliferation and tumor growth. Interestingly, BMI1 suppression in MYCN/MYC-overexpressing cells resulted in significantly greater inhibition compared to that in mock-transduced and parental cells. Our results indicate that MYCN and MYC regulate BMI1 gene expression at the transcriptional level and that dysregulation of the BMI1 gene mediated by MYCN or MYC overexpression, confers increased cell proliferation during neuroblastoma genesis and tumor progression."

Tf and Tf receptor (TfR) complexes are internalized via clathrin-coated pits composed of a variety of proteins and lipids and pass through early endosomes to recycling endosomes. We investigated the role of sphingomyelin (SM) synthases (SMS1 and SMS2) in clathrin-dependent trafficking of Tf and cell proliferation. We employed SM-deficient lymphoma cells that lacked SMSs and that failed to proliferate in response to Tf. Transfection of SMS1, but not SMS2, enabled these cells to incorporate SM into the plasma membrane, restoring Tf-mediated proliferation. SM-deficient cells showed a significant reduction in clathrin-dependent Tf uptake compared with the parental SM-producing cells. Both SMS1 gene transfection and exogenous short-chain SM treatment increased clathrin-dependent Tf uptake in SM-deficient cells, with the Tf being subsequently sorted to Rab11-positive recycling endosomes. We observed trafficking of the internalized Tf to late/endolysosomal compartments, and this was not dependent on the clathrin pathway in SM-deficient cells.

The internalization of plasma membrane receptors and lipids occurs through the clathrin pathway and/or the lipid-raft endocytic pathway (8Le Roy C. Wrana J.L. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 6: 112-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (708) Google Scholar). Protein-lipid and protein-protein interactions are involved in the targeting of signaling molecules to specialized compartments in those pathways. Numerous studies have uncovered the proteins that participate in this machinery, including GTPases such as dynamins, coat components, and different adaptors (9Kaksonen M. J. Cell Biol. 2008; 180: 1059-1060Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 10Higgins M.K. McMahon H.T. Trends Biochem.

However, the role of lipid molecules remained relatively underappreciated by researchers until it was found that membrane lipids such as phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate and phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate are important for this process (13De Camilli P. Emr S.D. McPherson P.S. Novick P. Science. 1996; 271: 1533-1539Crossref PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar, 14Padrón D. Tall R.D. Roth M.G. Mol. Biol.

The importance of lipid molecules was further demonstrated by the finding that endocytosis is regulated by the catalytic action of phospholipid metabolizing enzymes, such as phospholipase D (16Du G. Altshuller Y.M. Vitale N. Huang P. Chasserot-Golaz S. Morris A.J. Bader M.F. Frohman M.A. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 162: 305-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 17Du G. Huang P. Liang B.T.

Additional evidence for the vital role of lipids is the existence of lipid binding domains in numerous vesicle-forming proteins (19Demmel L. Gravert M. Ercan E. Habermann B. Müller-Reichert T. Kukhtina V. Haucke V. Baust T. Sohrmann M. Kalaidzidis Y. Klose C. Beck M. Peter M. Walch-Solimena C. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2008; 19: 1991-2002Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Sphingolipids such as sphingomyelin (SM) and ceramide have emerged as vital components of cellular membranes and are involved in diverse cell functions, including cell proliferation, death, and immunity (20Hannun Y.A. Obeid L.M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2008; 9: 139-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (2484) Google Scholar). In contrast to phosphatidylinositols, their role in cellular trafficking has not been thoroughly investigated. We previously described the role of the SM cycle in cell differentiation and death, demonstrating a physiologically important role for the mutual conversion of SM and ceramide in cell proliferation (21Okazaki T. Bell R.M. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 19076-19080Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3125-3128Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). SM is produced by the catalytic action of SM synthase (SMS), which is thought to be the sole enzyme responsible for SM synthesis in mammals (23Voelker D.R. Kennedy E.P. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 2753-2759Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). SMS catalyzes the transfer of phosphocholine from phosphatidylcholine to ceramide, resulting in the generation of SM and diacylglycerol. In mammalians, two SMS isoforms (SMS1 and SMS2) have been shown to account for the synthesis of SM in the lumen of the trans-Golgi (24Huitema K. van den Dikkenberg J. Brouwers J.F. Holthuis J.C.

The human genome also contains an SMS-related gene (SMSr) whose product does not have the ability to synthesize SM but catalyzes the formation of the SM analog ceramide phosphoethanolamine (26Rietveld A.

Watanabe R. Singh R.D. Dominguez M. Brown J.C. Wheatley C.L. Marks D.L. Pagano R.E. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 154: 535-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). A small percentage of SM is trafficked to lysosomes where it is degraded to ceramide by acid sphingomyelinase (SMase) (31Koval M. Pagano R.E. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 429-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Hydrolysis of plasma membrane SM by bacterial SMase (bSMase) rapidly induces the formation of numerous vesicles, probably containing ceramide, that pinch off from the plasma membrane in ATP-depleted macrophages and fibroblasts (32Zha X. Pierini L.M. Leopold P.L. Skiba P.J. Tabas I. Maxfield F.R. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 39-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Alterations in the sphingolipid composition of trafficking vesicles have the potential to affect the regulation of endocytosis and trafficking. In this study, we propose that SM formation by SMS1 on the plasma membrane regulates clathrin-dependent endocytosis of Tf and, consequently, cell proliferation.

Miyaji M. Kitano T. Umehara H. Okazaki T. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 18688-18693Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). WR19L/Fas-SMS1 and WR19L/Fas-SMS2 cells were established by retroviral transfection of WR19L/Fas-SM(−) cells using pDON-hSMS1 and pDON-hSMS2, respectively. WR19L/Fas-SM(−) cells transfected with empty vector, pDON-AI, and the parental WR19L/Fas-SM(−) cells had the same characteristics, so we used WR19L/Fas-pDON-AI cells as a substitute for WR19L/Fas-SM(−) cells. Cells were cultured at 37 °C in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 50 μm β-mercaptoethanol in a 5% CO2 atmosphere. 5 μg of total RNA, isolated using a RNA purification kit (RNeasy, Qiagen, Hilden, Germany), was used in reverse transcription reactions using a cDNA synthesis kit (TaKaRa Shuzo, Kyoto, Japan). The resulting cDNA was amplified using Premix TaqPCR kit (TaKaRa) in a PCR thermal cycler. The following primer sets were used: for glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, forward 5′-AAGGCTGTGGGCAAGGTCAT-3′ and reverse 5′-CACCACCCTGTTGCTGTAGC-3′; for human and mouse SMS1, forward 5′-TTAGCGCATGACCACTACAC-3′ and human reverse 5′-CAAAGTGGGGATCCGACAAA-3′ or mouse reverse 5′-CAAAGTGGGGATCCGACAAA-3′; for mouse SMS2, forward 5′-ATTCACCTCGTCACTTCTGG-3′ and reverse 5′-TTGCAGCACGGACTCTTTTG-3′; for human SMS2, forward 5′-ACTACTCTACCTGTGCCTGG-3′ and reverse 5′-AGCAGCCAGCAGATTAAATG-3′. PCR products were separated using 5% PAGE and detected with ethidium bromide staining. Cells (2 × 106/ml) were homogenized in ice-cold buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 2 mm EDTA, 10 mm EGTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2.5 μg/ml leupeptin, and 2.5 μg/ml aprotinin). 100 μg of protein was mixed with the reaction solution (10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 1 mm EDTA, 20 μm C6-NBD-ceramide, 120 μm phosphatidylcholine) and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. Lipids were extracted (33Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (43132) Google Scholar) and separated by thin-layer chromatography on silica gel G plates using chloroform, methanol, 12 mm MgCl2 (65:25:4, v/v/v). For in vivo SMS activity, 1 × 107 cells were treated with 5 μm C6-NBD-ceramide on ice, washed twice with ice-cold PBS, and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. Cell homogenization and lipid extraction was performed as described for in vitro SMS activity. Fluorescent lipids were visualized by the LAS-1000 system (Fujifilm, Tokyo, Japan). Analysis of SM and ceramide species in lipid extracts was performed using high performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry as described by Bielawski et al. (34Bielawski J. Szulc Z.M. Hannun Y.A. Bielawska A. Methods. 2006; 39: 82-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar). Amounts of ceramide were expressed as the total of species with various carbon chains (C14, C16, C18, C18:1, C20, C20:1, C20:4, C22, C22:1, C24, C24:1, C26, and C26:1). Amounts of SM were similarly expressed as the total of species with various carbon-chains (C14, C16, C18, C18:1, C20, C20:1, C22, C22:1, C24, C24:1, C26, and C26:1). Cells were washed twice with serum-free RPMI 1640 medium and seeded at 2 × 105 cells/ml. Cell viability was counted by the trypan blue exclusion method. For the Tf transport assay, cells were incubated in serum-free medium for 60 min at 37 °C to deplete intracellular Tf. The cells were then incubated with 1 μg/ml [125I]Tf at 37 °C for the indicated time periods. Free and plasma membrane-associated Tf were extracted by washing with PBS and acidic buffer (20 mm MES (pH 5.0), 137 mm NaCl, 50 μm desferal, and 0.1% BSA) at 4 °C. The amount of internalized [125I]Tf was determined using a gamma counter. For measurement of Tf uptake, cells were preincubated in serum-free medium for 60 min and treated with 20 μg/ml Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated Tf for 10 min. Cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS and treated with acidic buffer for 10 min at 4 °C. Then cells were washed with ice-cold PBS and fixed with 1% paraformaldehyde for 20 min at 4 °C. Fluorescence was measured with a fluorescence-activated cell sorter (FACS). For the detection of plasma membrane SM, cells were washed twice and kept for 1 h in serum-free RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 0.2% defatted BSA at 37 °C to eliminate any lipids acquired from the serum. Cells were cytospun onto slides and fixed with 2% formaldehyde. They were probed with lysenin-MBP for 30 min at room temperature and stained with anti-MBP monoclonal IgG followed by Alexa Fluor 546 conjugated anti-mouse IgG antibodies. For determining Tf colocalization with clathrin heavy chain, Rab11, and Lamp2 (lysosomal-associated membrane protein 2), cells were treated with Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated Tf. Fixed cells were cytospinned onto glass slides and permeabilized with PBS containing 0.1% Triton X-100 for 10 min and incubated with PBS containing 1% BSA for 30 min at room temperature. Cells were washed with PBS and then incubated with primary antibodies for 2 h at room temperature. After washing with PBS, Alexa Fluor 546-conjugated anti-IgG antibodies were applied for 1 h. For studies of Tf colocalization with lysosomes in living cells, cells were treated with 200 nm LysoTracker Red before 1 h of Tf treatment and subsequently treated with Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated Tf and Hoechst33342 for 5 min. Confocal laser microscopy was performed using a TCS SP2 microscope (Leica). Colocalization of proteins was quantified with CoLocalizer Pro, Version 2.2, using the overlap coefficient according to Manders (CoLocalization Research Software, Boise, ID). Cells were harvested, washed with PBS, and dispersed in hypotonic buffer containing 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 10 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.1% SDS, 1 mm PMSF, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 10 μg/ml aprotinin. To detect intracellular Tf, cells (2 × 106 cells) were treated with or without 20 mm NH4Cl for 10 min and then incubated with 50 μg/ml Tf for 10 min at 37 °C. Cells were then washed with ice-cold PBS and treated with acidic buffer for 10 min, washed again with ice-cold PBS, and lysed. The lysates (50 μg of protein) were subjected to SDS-PAGE. Proteins were transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore, Bedford, MA) and blocked with PBS, 0.1% Tween 20 (PBS-T) containing 5% nonfat dried milk. Membranes were incubated with primary antibodies and then secondary antibodies in PBS-T containing 5% nonfat dried milk. Immunoreactive protein bands were visualized using an ECL-peroxidase detection system (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's instruction. The bands were quantified with Image J 1.43. Comparison between two groups was carried out using the unpaired Student's t test. To examine the role of SMSs in Tf trafficking and cell proliferation, we employed SM-defective murine lymphoma WR19L/Fas-SM(−) cells that were established from SM-rich WR19L/Fas-SM(+) cells (35Miyaji M. Jin Z.X. Yamaoka S. Amakawa R. Fukuhara S. Sato S.B. Kobayashi T. Domae N. Mimori T. Bloom E.T. Okazaki T. Umehara H. J. Exp. Med. 2005; 202: 249-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). The parent cells, but not WR19L/Fas-SM(−) cells, constitutively expressed mRNA for SMS1 (Fig. 1A). WR19L/Fas-SM(−) cells were stably transfected with human SMS1 or SMS2 genes to generate WR19L/Fas-SMS1 or WR19L/Fas-SMS2 cells, respectively. The respective mRNAs were detected in these cells (Fig. 1A). Next, we determined SMS activities in vitro and in vivo. WR19L/Fas-SM(−) cells were defective in in vitro (Fig. 1B) and in vivo (Fig. 1C) SMS activities, and cells overexpressing hSMS1 or hSMS2 showed in vitro SMS activities to a similar extent (Fig. 1B). The in vivo activity in WR19L/Fas-SMS1 cells was 150 pmol/107 cells/h, similar to the parental WR19L/Fas-SM(+) cells. SMS2-overexpressing WR19L/Fas-SMS2 cells showed only a slight increase in activity compared with WR19L/Fas-SM(−) cells (Fig. 1C). Furthermore, we determined the cellular content of the SMS substrate, ceramide, and the product, SM, by LC/MS. Introduction of the SMS1 gene dramatically augmented SM content to 32.05 ± 3.23 pmol/nmol of lipid phosphate from 3.18 ± 1.85 pmol/nmol of lipid phosphate in WR19L/Fas-SM(−) cells, but SMS2-overexpressing WR19L/Fas-SMS2 cells displayed only modest increases in SM. The modest elevation in in vivo activity by SMS2 gene introduction and the robust increase in in vitro activity was closely correlated to SM levels in WR19L/Fas-SMS2 cells. However, there was no significant difference in cellular ceramide levels among these cells (Fig. 1D). Immunocytochemical detection of cell surface SM by lysenin showed that plasma membrane SM was detectable only in SMS1-expressing cells (WR19L/Fas-SM(+) and WR19L/Fas-SMS1 cells; Fig. 1E). Thus, SMS1 appears to play an important role in forming SM, particularly at the plasma membrane. The Tf-TfR system plays an important role in cell proliferation, and we previously proposed that SMS1-generated SM is required for cell proliferation by insulin and Tf (25Yamaoka S. Miyaji M. Kitano T. Umehara H. Okazaki T. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 18688-18693Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). However which SMS isoenzymes contribute to Tf-dependent cell proliferation remained unknown. As shown in Fig. 2A, SM-deficient WR19L/Fas-SM(−) cells failed to proliferate in response to Tf. Notably, only SMS1-expressing and SM-rich cells (WR19L/Fas-SMS1 and WR19L/Fas-SM(+) cells) displayed Tf-dependent proliferation, indicating an important role for SMS1-generated SM in Tf-dependent cell proliferation. Moreover, we examined the effects of exogenous short chain C6-SM or bSMase on Tf-dependent cell proliferation. In WR19L/Fas-SMS1 cells, bSMase treatment reduced cell surface SM, and C6-SM-treated WR19L/Fas-SM(−) cells had increased amounts of SM on the cell surface (Fig. 2B). As shown in Fig. 2C, C6-SM treatment imparted on WR19L/Fas-SM(−) cells the ability to proliferate in response to Tf. Conversely, the degradation of cell surface SM by bSMase suppressed Tf-induced proliferation of WR19L/Fas-SMS1 cells (Fig. 2D). These results suggest that Tf-induced cell proliferation requires SM at the cell surface and is dependent on the catalytic activity of SMS1. Tf and TfR complexes internalized via clathrin-coated pits pass through early endosomes and recycling endosomes, and this process is important for cell proliferation. To examine the involvement of clathrin-dependent internalization of Tf in cell proliferation, we employed a pharmacological approach using chlorpromazine (36Hernaez B. Alonso C. J. Virol. 2010; 84: 2100-2109Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 37Subtil A. Hémar A. Dautry-Varsat A. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 3461-3468Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which is known to suppress clathrin-dependent internalization. Chlorpromazine treatment inhibited Tf-induced cell proliferation of SMS1-expressing and SM-rich WR19L/Fas-SM(+) cells in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 3A), and the treatment blocked Tf internalization (Fig. 3B). The TfR family consists of two isoforms, TfR1 and TfR2 (1Gomme P.T. McCann K.B. Bertolini J. Drug Discov. Today. 2005; 10: 267-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar, 38Kawabata H. Yang R.

As we failed to detect significant expression of TfR2 in WR19L/Fas-SM(+) cells (supplemental Fig. S1), TfR1 is likely the major isoform in these cells, accounting for Tf-induced cell proliferation. Thus, the data suggest that clathrin-dependent Tf-TfR1 internalization is important for cell proliferation. A recent study of trafficking organelles using synaptic vesicles as a model revealed that clathrin-containing vesicles are composed of various lipids, including SM (39Takamori S. Holt M. Stenius K. Lemke E.A. Gr⊘nborg M. Riedel D. Urlaub H. Schenck S. Brügger B. Ringler P. Müller S.A. Rammner B. Gräter F. Hub J.S. De Groot B.L. Mieskes G. Moriyama Y. Klingauf J. Grubmüller H. Heuser J. Wieland F. Jahn R. Cell. 2006; 127: 831-846Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1709) Google Scholar). Thus, SM-deficient cells lacking SMSs were presumed to have impairments in clathrin-coated vesicle. Indeed, SMS-deficient cells were impaired in Tf-mediated cell proliferation (Fig. 2). We measured Tf uptake and recycling in all cell types. Cells were incubated with [125I]Tf for the indicated time periods. Tf uptake increased with time and then plateaued after 10 min, but amounts of Tf uptake after 10 and 20 min were significantly reduced in SM-deficient cells compared with SM-rich cells expressing SMS1 (Fig. 4A). Although cellular and/or cell surface expression of TfR1 possibly affected Tf uptake, there were no significant differences in expression levels between the WR19L/Fas variants (supplemental Fig. S1). These results suggest that SMS1-mediated SM synthesis is crucial for Tf uptake. We also determined the rate of Tf recycling in these cells. Cells were incubated for 10 min at 37 °C, and cell surface [125I]Tf was dissociated from plasma membrane TfR1 using an acidic buffer at 4 °C. Recycling of internalized [125I]Tf into the medium was measured during re-incubation of the cells at 37 °C. Although [125I]Tf was inefficiently internalized by SMS-SM-deficient WR19L/Fas-SM(−) cells (Fig. 4A), the amount of intracellular label sufficed for recycling measurements. The rate of recycling was not significantly affected by deficits in SMS1-mediated SM synthesis (Fig. 4B). In light of the results above, SMS1-mediated SM synthesis likely controlled clathrin-dependent Tf internalization. To examine this possibility, we tested the effects of SM on clathrin-dependent endocytosis of Tf (Fig. 5A). K+ depletion (40Larkin J.M. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Anderson R.G. Cell. 1983; 33: 273-285Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar) is known to abolish clathrin-dependent endocytosis, similar to chlorpromazine, thereby inhibiting Tf uptake. More than 50% of Tf internalization was sensitive to K+ depletion in both SM-rich WR19L/Fas-SM(+) and WR19L/Fas-SMS1 cells, whereas SM-deficient cells such as WR19L/Fas-SM(−) and WR19L/Fas-SMS2 showed less sensitivity to K+ depletion. Most importantly, the addition of 1 μm C6-SM significantly restored the susceptibility of SM-deficient WR19L/Fas-SM(−) cells to inhibition of Tf internalization by K+ depletion by more than 2-fold, suggesting that SM is a key lipid that allows Tf to be internalized through clathrin-coated vesicles. Dynamin is a GTPase that is essential for clathrin-dependent vesicle formation (41van Dam E.M. Stoorvogel W. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 169-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar), and the selective inhibitor dynasore has been shown to inhibit the clathrin-dependent internalization of Tf (42Macia E. Ehrlich M. Massol R. Boucrot E. Brunner C. Kirchhausen T. Dev. Cell. 2006; 10: 839-850Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1523) Google Scholar). Similar to K+ depletion, Tf internalization in SM-rich WR/Fas-SM(+) and SMS1 cells was sensitive to dynasore treatment compared with SM-deficient cells (Fig. 5B). Thus, SM appears to be required for dynamin-dependent internalization of Tf, and dynamin is unlikely to significantly contribute to the clathrin-independent pathway. When internalized, Tf-TfR complexes are packed into clathrin-coated vesicles. To examine the effects of SMS1 introduction on the compartmentalization of Tf-TfR complexes into clathrin-coated vesicles, we performed confocal microscopy using Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated Tf and clathrin heavy chain antibodies. After 2 min of Tf chase, the colocalization of Tf with clathrin heavy chain in SM-deficient cells was 20.8%, and the restoration of SM by SMS1 introduction significantly increased colocalization (WR19L/Fas-SMS1 cells, 48.1%; Fig. 6, A and B). No colocalization was observed after 5 min (data not shown), which matches the mode of Tf internalization and traffic in other cell types (41van Dam E.M. Stoorvogel W. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 169-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Furthermore, we tested whether manipulating SM content at the plasma membrane affected the internalization of Tf with clathrin. The loading of exogenous C6-SM onto WR19L/Fas-SM(−) cells significantly restored early Tf/clathrin colocalization to 43.2% from 20.8%, and conversely, SM hydrolysis by bSMase led to the loss of early colocalization in WR19L/Fas-SMS1 cells, down to 20.8% from 48.1% (Fig. 6, A and B). No significant difference in protein levels of TfR1 and clathrin heavy chain between SM-rich and -deficient cells was found, suggesting that changes in protein expression were not involved in regulating the Tf internalization pathway from being primarily clathrin-dependent to being clathrin-independent or vice versa. Tf was colocalized with TfR1 in all WR19L/Fas variants (supplemental Fig. S1C), indicating that Tf compartmentalization is similar to that of TfR1. These data suggest that SMS1-mediated SM synthesis plays a key role in promoting the packaging of Tf-TfR1 complexes into clathrin-coated vesicles at the plasma membrane. Consistent with the results in Fig. 5, these results also suggest that SM deficiency directs Tf to the endocytic pathway instead of the clathrin pathway. Tf internalized along with other clathrin-coated cargo is sequentially sorted to Rab11-positive recycling endosomes (43Trischler M. Stoorvogel W. Ullrich O. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 4773-4783Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We examined the involvement of SMS1-medi"

The antiviral effect of ribavirin against Old World hantaviruses, most notably Hantaan virus, is well documented; however, only a few studies have addressed its inhibitory effect on New World hantaviruses. In the present study, we demonstrate that ribavirin is highly active against Andes virus (ANDV), an important etiological agent of HPS, both in vitro and in vivo using a lethal hamster model of HPS. Treatment of ANDV infected Vero E6 cells with ribavirin resulted in dose-dependent reductions in viral RNA and protein as well as virus yields with a half maximal inhibitory concentration between 5 and 12.5 µg ml−1. In hamsters, treatment with as little as 5 mg kg−1 day−1 was 100% effective at preventing lethal HPS disease when therapy was administered by intraperitoneal injection from day 1 through day 10 post-infection. Significant reductions were observed in ANDV RNA and antigen positive cells in lung and liver tissues. Ribavirin remained completely protective when administered by intraperitoneal injections up to three days post-infection. In addition, we show that daily oral ribavirin therapy initiated 1 day post-infection and continuing for ten days is also protective against lethal ANDV disease, even at doses of 5 mg kg−1 day−1. Our results suggest ribavirin treatment is beneficial for postexposure prophylaxis against HPS-causing hantaviruses and should be considered in scenarios where exposure to the virus is probable. The similarities between the results obtained in this study and those from previous clinical evaluations of ribavirin against HPS, further validate the hamster model of lethal HPS and demonstrate its usefulness in screening antiviral agents against this disease."
https://openalex.org/W2059111440,"It has been known for decades that some insect-infecting trypanosomatids can survive in culture without heme supplementation while others cannot, and that this capability is associated with the presence of a betaproteobacterial endosymbiont in the flagellate's cytoplasm. However, the specific mechanisms involved in this process remained obscure. In this work, we sequence and phylogenetically analyze the heme pathway genes from the symbionts and from their hosts, as well as from a number of heme synthesis-deficient Kinetoplastida. Our results show that the enzymes responsible for synthesis of heme are encoded on the symbiont genomes and produced in close cooperation with the flagellate host. Our evidence suggests that this synergistic relationship is the end result of a history of extensive gene loss and multiple lateral gene transfer events in different branches of the phylogeny of the Trypanosomatidae."
https://openalex.org/W1981886126,"Radiolarians are marine planktonic protists that belong to the eukaryote supergroup Rhizaria together with Foraminifera and Cercozoa. Radiolaria has traditionally been divided into four main groups based on morphological characters; i.e. Polycystina, Acantharia, Nassellaria and Phaeodaria. But recent 18S rDNA phylogenies have shown that Phaeodaria belongs within Cerocozoa, and that the previously heliozoan group Taxopodida should be included in Radiolaria. 18S rDNA phylogenies have not yet resolved the sister relationship between the main Radiolaria groups, but nevertheless suggests that Spumellaria, and thereby also Polycystina, are polyphyletic. Very few sequences other than 18S rDNA have so far been generated from radiolarian cells, mostly due to the fact that Radiolaria has been impossible to cultivate and single cell PCR has been hampered by low success rate. Here we have therefore investigated the mutual evolutionary relationship of the main radiolarian groups by using the novel approach of combining single cell whole genome amplification with targeted PCR amplification of the 18S and 28S rDNA genes. Combined 18S and 28S phylogeny of sequences obtained from single cells shows that Radiolaria is divided into two main lineages: Polycystina (Spumellaria+Nassellaria) and Spasmaria (Acantharia+Taxopodida). Further we show with high support that Foraminifera groups within Radiolaria supporting the Retaria hypothesis."

Although in Moco biosynthesis in humans, the thiocarboxylation of the corresponding MoaD homolog involves two sulfurtransferases, an l-cysteine desulfurase, and a rhodanese-like protein, the rhodanese-like protein in E. coli remained enigmatic so far. Using a reverse approach, we identified a so far unknown sulfurtransferase for the MoeB-MoaD complex by protein-protein interactions. We show that YnjE, a three-domain rhodanese-like protein from E. coli, interacts with MoeB possibly for sulfur transfer to MoaD. The E. coli IscS protein was shown to specifically interact with YnjE for the formation of the persulfide group on YnjE. In a defined in vitro system consisting of MPT synthase, MoeB, Mg-ATP, IscS, and l-cysteine, YnjE was shown to enhance the rate of the conversion of added cyclic pyranopterin monophosphate to MPT. However, YnjE was not an enhancer of the cysteine desulfurase activity of IscS. This is the first report identifying the rhodanese-like protein YnjE as being involved in Moco biosynthesis in E. coli. We believe that the role of YnjE is to make the sulfur transfer from IscS for Moco biosynthesis more specific because IscS is involved in a variety of different sulfur transfer reactions in the cell.

https://openalex.org/W2003793999,"Helicobacter pylori is a gastric pathogen that infects half the human population and causes gastritis, ulcers, and cancer. The cagA gene product is a major virulence factor associated with gastric cancer. It is injected into epithelial cells, undergoes phosphorylation by host cell kinases, and perturbs host signaling pathways. CagA is known for its geographical, structural, and functional diversity in the C-terminal half, where an EPIYA host-interacting motif is repeated. The Western version of CagA carries the EPIYA segment types A, B, and C, while the East Asian CagA carries types A, B, and D and shows higher virulence. Many structural variants such as duplications and deletions are reported. In this study, we gained insight into the relationships of CagA variants through various modes of recombination, by analyzing all known cagA variants at the DNA sequence level with the single nucleotide resolution. Processes that occurred were: (i) homologous recombination between DNA sequences for CagA multimerization (CM) sequence; (ii) recombination between DNA sequences for the EPIYA motif; and (iii) recombination between short similar DNA sequences. The left half of the EPIYA-D segment characteristic of East Asian CagA was derived from Western type EPIYA, with Amerind type EPIYA as the intermediate, through rearrangements of specific sequences within the gene. Adaptive amino acid changes were detected in the variable region as well as in the conserved region at sites to which no specific function has yet been assigned. Each showed a unique evolutionary distribution. These results clarify recombination-mediated routes of cagA evolution and provide a solid basis for a deeper understanding of its function in pathogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2019246380,"The unique C-terminal domain (CTD) of RNA polymerase II, composed of tandem heptad repeats of the consensus sequence YSPTSPS, is subject to differential phosphorylation throughout the transcription cycle. Several RNA processing factors have been shown to bind the phosphorylated CTD and use it to localize to nascent pre-mRNA during transcription. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the mRNA export protein Yra1 (ALY/RNA export factor in metazoa) cotranscriptionally associates with mRNA and delivers it to the nuclear pore complex for export to the cytoplasm. Here we report that Yra1 directly binds in vitro the hyperphosphorylated form of the CTD characteristic of elongating RNA polymerase II and contains a phospho-CTD-interacting domain within amino acids 18-184, which also include an ""RNA recognition motif"" (RRM) (residues 77-184). Using UV cross-linking, we showed that the RRM alone binds RNA, although a larger segment extending to the C terminus (amino acids 77-226) displayed stronger RNA binding activity. Although the RRM is implicated in both RNA and CTD binding, RRM point mutations separated these two functions. Both functions are important in vivo as RNA binding-defective or CTD binding-defective versions of Yra1 engendered growth and mRNA export defects. We also report the construction and characterization of a useful new temperature-sensitive YRA1 allele (R107A/F126A). Using ChIP, we demonstrated that removing the N-terminal 76 amino acids of Yra1 (all of the phospho-CTD-interacting domain up to the RRM) results in a 10-fold decrease in Yra1 recruitment to genes during elongation. These results indicate that the phospho-CTD is likely involved directly in the cotranscriptional recruitment of Yra1."
https://openalex.org/W2036139759,"Hsp90 (heat shock protein of 90 kDa) is often found associated with functional domains of client proteins, including those for ligand binding, dimerization, DNA binding, and enzymatic activity. Although Hsp90 can maintain the conformation of functionally important domains prior to activation of the client protein, its specific binding site and the mechanism(s) of Hsp90 dissociation during activation are unknown. Here, we have identified and characterized residues involved in Hsp90 binding within the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) ligand-binding domain and demonstrate that they overlap with those involved in ligand binding. In agreement with this spatial model, ligand binding results in Hsp90 dissociation from the AhR Per-ARNT-Sim B fragment. Interestingly, whereas Hsp90-binding residues within the ligand-binding domain were not involved in Hsp90-dependent AhR protein stability, several of these residues are important for ligand-dependent AhR activation, and their mutation resulted in conversion of two AhR antagonists/partial agonists into full AhR agonists. These studies reveal co-localization of a tentative Hsp90-binding site with that for AhR ligand binding and provide the first molecular mechanism for Hsp90 dissociation in the activation of a client protein."

This is primarily because there has been no reliable molecular method for estimating or quantifying variation. Methodology/Principal Findings We adopted a petal-variegated cultivar of Saintpaulia ‘Thamires’ (Saintpaulia sp.) as the model plant. Based on the difference between the pre- and post-transposon excision sequence of the promoter region of flavonoid 3′, 5′-hydoroxylase (F3′5′H), we estimated mutated (transposon-excised) cell percentages using a quantitative real-time PCR. Mutated cell percentages in leaf laminae used as explants was 4.6 and 2.4% in highly or low variegation flower plants, respectively, although the occurrences of blue color mutants in their regenerants were more than 40%. Preexisting mutated cell percentages in cultured explants were considerably lower than the mutated plant percentage among total regenerants via tissue culture. Conclusions/Significance The estimation of mutated cell percentages became possible using the quantitative real-time PCR. The origins of mutations were successfully distinguished; it was confirmed that somaclonal variations are mainly caused by newly generated mutations arising from tissue culture process."
https://openalex.org/W2027145159,"The activated androgen receptor (AR) promotes prostate cancer (PCa) growth. AR antagonists repress the AR by recruitment of corepressors. Not much is known about the inactivation of AR by corepressors in the presence of agonists (androgens). Here we show that the corepressor LCoR acts as an androgen-dependent corepressor that represses human PCa growth in vivo. In line with this, progressive decrease of ligand-dependent corepressor expression was observed in the PCa TRAMP mouse model with increasing age. LCoR interacts with AR and is recruited to chromatin in an androgen-induced manner. Unexpectedly, the LXXLL motif of LCoR is dispensable for interaction with the AR. Rather, the data indicate that LCoR interacts with the AR DNA binding domain on DNA. Interestingly, the interaction of LCoR with AR is inhibited by signaling pathways that are associated with androgen-independent PCa. Here we also show that the Src kinase inactivates the corepressive function of LCoR. Interfering with endogenous Src function by a dominant negative Src mutant, the growth inhibitory activity of LCoR is enhanced in vivo in a xenograft mouse model system. Thus, our studies indicate a role of LCoR as an AR corepressor and a tumor suppressor. Further, the decreased expression or inactivation of LCoR is as an important step toward PCa carcinogenesis in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2117344978,"Anthropogenic activities have increased the rate of biological extinction many-fold. Recent empirical studies suggest that projected extinction may lead to extensive loss to the Tree of Life, much more than if extinction were random. One suggested cause is that extinction risk is heritable (phylogenetically patterned), such that entire higher groups will be lost. We show here with simulation that phylogenetically clustered extinction risks are necessary but not sufficient for the extensive loss of phylogenetic diversity (PD) compared to random extinction. We simulated Yule trees and evolved extinction risks at various levels of heritability (measured using Pagel's λ). At most levels of heritability (λ in range of 0 to 10), mean values of extinction risk (range 0.25 to 0.75), tree sizes (64 to 128 tips), tree balance and temporal heterogeneity of diversification rates (Yule and coalescent trees), extinction risks do not substantially increase the loss of PD in these trees when compared to random extinction. The maximum loss of PD (20% above random) was only associated with the combination of extremely excessive values of phylogenetic signal, high mean species' extinction probabilities, and extreme (coalescent) tree shapes. Interestingly, we also observed a decline in the rate of increase in the loss of PD at high phylogenetic clustering (λ → 10) of extinction risks. Our results suggest that the interplay between various aspects of tree shape and a predisposition of higher extinction risks in species-poor clades is required to explain the substantial pruning of the Tree of Life."

We found that delivered WT, but not mutant Lnk R8 blocked TPO-induced M-MOK megakaryoblastic leukemic cell proliferation. In contrast, WT Lnk R8 showed no growth inhibitive effect on non-hematopoietic HELA or COS-7 cell. Moreover, we demonstrated that TPO-induced M-MOK cell growth inhibition by WT Lnk R8 was dose-dependent. Penetrated WT Lnk R8 induced cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. Immunoprecipitation and Western blots data indicated WT Lnk R8 interacted with endogeneous Jak2 and downregulated Jak-Stat and MAPK phosphorylation level in M-MOK cells after TPO stimulation. Treatment with specific inhibitors (TG101348 and PD98059) indicated Jak-Stat and MAPK pathways were crucial for TPO-induced proliferation of M-MOK cells. Further analyses using TF-1 and HEL leukemic cell-lines showed that WT Lnk R8 inhibited Jak2-dependent cell proliferation. Using cord blood-derived CD34+ stem cells, we found that delivered WT Lnk R8 blocked TPO-induced megakaryopoiesis in vitro. Conclusions/Significance Intracellular delivery of WT Lnk R8 fusion protein efficiently inhibited TPO-induced M-MOK leukemic cell growth by promoting apoptosis. WT Lnk R8 protein delivery may provide a safer and more practical approach to inhibit leukemic cell growth worthy of further development."

How these resources are allocated when both responses are active is not known. Insight in possible crosstalk will help understanding the consequences of failure of these systems in (age-related) disease.In heat stressed HEK293 cells synthesis of the canonical UPR transcription factors XBP1s and ATF4 was detected as well as HSF1 independent activation of the promoters of the ER resident chaperones HSPA5 (BiP) and DNAJB9 (ERdj4). However, the heat stress activation of the DNAJB9 promoter, a XBP1s target, was not blocked in cells expressing a dominant negative IRE1α mutant, and thus did not require XBP1s. Furthermore, the DNA element required for heat stress activation of the DNAJB9 promoter is distinct from the ATF4 and ATF6 target elements; even though inhibition of eIF2α phosphorylation resulted in a decreased activation of the DNAJB9 promoter upon heat stress, suggesting a role for an eIF2α phosphorylation dependent product.The initial step in the UPR, synthesis of transcription factors, is activated by heat stress but the second step, transcriptional transactivation by these factors, is blocked and these pathways of the UPR are thus not productive. Expression of canonical ER chaperones is part of the response of heat stressed cells but another set of transcription factors has been recruited to regulate expression of these ER chaperones."
https://openalex.org/W2130966105,"Interaction with the complement system is an underappreciated aspect of HIV-1 infection; even in primary infection, complement fragments are found on virions with potential to affect the interplay between the virus and dendritic cells (DC). Since opsonization may affect the efficiency of uptake and the type of receptors utilized, we compared the interactions of DC with free HIV-1 (F-HIV) and complement opsonized HIV-1 (C-HIV). We demonstrate that C-HIV significantly enhanced the uptake by immature DC (IDC) and mature DC (MDC) and that the internalization rate was dependent on both opsonization of the virus and DC maturation state. Increased DC uptake of C-HIV was not due to opsonization related increased binding of virus to the surface of DC but rather increased internalization of C-HIV despite utilizing a similar repertoire of receptors as F-HIV. Both F-HIV and C-HIV interacted with C-type lectins, integrins, and CD4 and blocking these receptor families prevented HIV-1 from binding to DC at 4°C. Blocking integrins significantly reduced the binding and uptake of F-HIV and C-HIV implicating the involvement of several integrins such as β1-integrin, CR3, LFA-1, and α4β7. Distinctive for C-HIV was usage of β1-integrin and for F-HIV, usage of β7-integrin, whereas both F-HIV and C-HIV utilized both integrin chains of CR3. We have in this study identified the receptor types used by both F-HIV and C-HIV to bind to DC. Noteworthy, C-HIV was internalized more efficiently by DC than F-HIV, probably via receptor mediated endocytosis, which may entail different intracellular processing of the virus leading to both elevated infection and altered activation of HIV specific immune responses."
https://openalex.org/W1969776845,"Rhabdomyosarcomas (RSCs) are skeletal muscle neoplasms found in humans and domestic mammals. The A/J inbred strain developed a high frequency (between 70–80%) of adult pleomorphic type (APT) RSC at >20 months of age while BALB/cByJ also develop RSC but less frequently. These neoplasms invaded skeletal muscle surrounding either the axial or proximal appendicular skeleton and were characterized by pleomorphic cells with abundant eosinophilic cytoplasm, multiple nuclei, and cross striations. The diagnosis was confirmed by detection of alpha-sarcomeric actin and myogenin in the neoplastic cells using immunocytochemistry. The A/J strain, but not the related BALB/c substrains, is also characterised by a progressive muscular dystrophy homologous to limb-girdle muscular dystrophy type 2B. The association between the development of RSC in similar muscle groups to those most severely affected by the progressive muscular dystrophy suggested that these neoplasms developed from abnormal regeneration of the skeletal muscle exacerbated by the dysferlin mutation. Transcriptome analyses of RSCs revealed marked downregulation of genes in muscular development and function signaling networks. Non-synonymous coding SNPs were found in Myl1, Abra, Sgca, Ttn, and Kcnj12 suggesting these may be important in the pathogenesis of RSC. These studies suggest that A strains of mice can be useful models for dissecting the molecular genetic basis for development, progression, and ultimately for testing novel anticancer therapeutic agents dealing with rhabdomyosarcoma."
https://openalex.org/W2030297165,"Schistosomiasis is an intravascular parasitic disease associated with inflammation. Endothelial cells control leukocyte transmigration and vascular permeability being modulated by pro-inflammatory mediators. Recent data have shown that endothelial cells primed in vivo in the course of a disease keep the information in culture. Herein, we evaluated the impact of schistosomiasis on endothelial cell-regulated events in vivo and in vitro.The experimental groups consisted of Schistosoma mansoni-infected and age-matched control mice. In vivo infection caused a marked influx of leukocytes and an increased protein leakage in the peritoneal cavity, characterizing an inflamed vascular and cellular profile. In vitro leukocyte-mesenteric endothelial cell adhesion was higher in cultured cells from infected mice as compared to controls, either in the basal condition or after treatment with the pro-inflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor (TNF). Nitric oxide (NO) donation reduced leukocyte adhesion to endothelial cells from control and infected groups; however, in the later group the effect was more pronounced, probably due to a reduced NO production. Inhibition of control endothelial NO synthase (eNOS) increased leukocyte adhesion to a level similar to the one observed in the infected group. Besides, the adhesion of control leukocytes to endothelial cells from infected animals is similar to the result of infected animals, confirming that schistosomiasis alters endothelial cells function. Furthermore, NO production as well as the expression of eNOS were reduced in cultured endothelial cells from infected animals. On the other hand, the expression of its repressor protein, namely caveolin-1, was similar in both control and infected groups.Schistosomiasis increases vascular permeability and endothelial cell-leukocyte interaction in vivo and in vitro. These effects are partially explained by a reduced eNOS expression. In addition, our data show that the disease primes endothelial cells in vivo, which keep the acquired phenotype in culture."
https://openalex.org/W1970428036,"F14512 is a novel anti-tumor molecule based on an epipodophyllotoxin core coupled to a cancer-cell vectoring spermine moiety. This polyamine linkage is assumed to ensure the preferential uptake of F14512 by cancer cells, strong interaction with DNA and potent inhibition of topoisomerase II (Topo II). The antitumor activity of F14512 in human tumor models is significantly higher than that of other epipodophyllotoxins in spite of a lower induction of DNA breakage. Hence, the demonstrated superiority of F14512 over other Topo II poisons might not result solely from its preferential uptake by cancer cells, but could also be due to unique effects on Topo II interactions with DNA. To further dissect the mechanism of action of F14512, we used Drosophila melanogaster mutants whose genetic background leads to an easily scored phenotype that is sensitive to changes in Topo II activity and/or localization. F14512 has antiproliferative properties in Drosophila cells and stabilizes ternary Topo II/DNA cleavable complexes at unique sites located in moderately repeated sequences, suggesting that the drug specifically targets a select and limited subset of genomic sequences. Feeding F14512 to developing mutant Drosophila larvae led to the recovery of flies expressing a striking phenotype, ""Eye wide shut,"" where one eye is replaced by a first thoracic segment. Other recovered F14512-induced gain- and loss-of-function phenotypes similarly correspond to precise genetic dysfunctions. These complex in vivo results obtained in a whole developing organism can be reconciled with known genetic anomalies and constitute a remarkable instance of specific alterations of gene expression by ingestion of a drug. ""Drosophila-based anticancer pharmacology"" hence reveals unique properties for F14512, demonstrating the usefulness of an assay system that provides a low-cost, rapid and effective complement to mammalian models and permits the elucidation of fundamental mechanisms of action of candidate drugs of therapeutic interest in humans."
https://openalex.org/W2046080334,"The differences in efficacy and molecular mechanisms of platinum anti-cancer drugs cisplatin (CP) and oxaliplatin (OX) are thought to be partially due to the differences in the DNA conformations of the CP and OX adducts that form on adjacent guanines on DNA, which in turn influence the binding of damage-recognition proteins that control downstream effects of the adducts. Here we report a comprehensive comparison of the structural distortion of DNA caused by CP and OX adducts in the TGGT sequence context using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. When compared to our previous studies in other sequence contexts, these structural studies help us understand the effect of the sequence context on the conformation of Pt-GG DNA adducts. We find that both the sequence context and the type of Pt-GG DNA adduct (CP vs. OX) play an important role in the conformation and the conformational dynamics of Pt-DNA adducts, possibly explaining their influence on the ability of many damage-recognition proteins to bind to Pt-DNA adducts."
https://openalex.org/W2042274346,"Methods of classification using transcriptome analysis for case-by-case tumor diagnosis could be limited by tumor heterogeneity and masked information in the gene expression profiles, especially as the number of tumors is small. We propose a new strategy, EMts_2PCA, based on: 1) The identification of a gene expression signature with a great potential for discriminating subgroups of tumors (EMts stage), which includes: a) a learning step, based on an expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm, to select sets of candidate genes whose expressions discriminate two subgroups, b) a training step to select from the sets of candidate genes those with the highest potential to classify training tumors, c) the compilation of genes selected during the training step, and standardization of their levels of expression to finalize the signature. 2) The predictive classification of independent prospective tumors, according to the two subgroups of interest, by the definition of a validation space based on a two-step principal component analysis (2PCA). The present method was evaluated by classifying three series of tumors and its robustness, in terms of tumor clustering and prediction, was further compared with that of three classification methods (Gene expression bar code, Top-scoring pair(s) and a PCA-based method). Results showed that EMts_2PCA was very efficient in tumor classification and prediction, with scores always better that those obtained by the most common methods of tumor clustering. Specifically, EMts_2PCA permitted identification of highly discriminating molecular signatures to differentiate post-Chernobyl thyroid or post-radiotherapy breast tumors from their sporadic counterparts that were previously unsuccessfully classified or classified with errors."
https://openalex.org/W1985539024,"Biomedical education is currently faced with a number of significant challenges, including the explosion of information and the need to train researchers who can work across traditional disciplinary boundaries. We propose a new integrated model for graduate education in the life sciences that addresses these issues. Biomedical education is currently faced with a number of significant challenges, including the explosion of information and the need to train researchers who can work across traditional disciplinary boundaries. We propose a new integrated model for graduate education in the life sciences that addresses these issues. Over the past 20 years, the rate of acquisition of biomedical knowledge has increased exponentially (Attwood et al., 2009Attwood T.K. Kell D.B. McDermott P. Marsh J. Pettifer S.R. Thorne D. Biochem. J. 2009; 424: 317-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Although the increase in our knowledge of fundamental principles lags behind the rate at which total information accumulates, the amount of material that could be taught in advanced life sciences curricula today is much greater than it was 20 years ago. Despite this information explosion, the way that we teach biological systems to graduate students has fundamentally changed little except perhaps for a few technological advances in the classroom, such as PowerPoint and eLectures. Although these advances enable us to present more information per unit of time, we can no longer teach even a fraction of what is known. Even if time permitted it, students could never absorb, process, or retain all of this information. Our current knowledge of living systems has outgrown the existing models for biomedical education at the postcollege level. In addition, modern biomedical research increasingly requires interdisciplinary teams incorporating a variety of complementary tools to investigate problems (Connelly et al., 2009Connelly T. Sharp P.A. Ausiello D. Bronner-Fraser M. Burke I. Burris J. Eisen J. Janetos A. Karp R.

Langer R. et al.The Third Revolution: The Convergence of the Life Sciences, Physical Sciences and Engineering. MIT Press, Cambridge, MA2011Google Scholar). Innovations in undergraduate education are beginning to address the need for interdisciplinary learning and research (Alpern et al., 2009Alpern R.J. Long S. Åkerfeldt K. Ares M. Bond J. Dalley A.F. de Paula J. Dienstag J.L. Fishelder A.J. Friedlander M.J. et al.AAMC-HHMI Report: Scientific Foundations for Future Physicians.

Stevens C. et al.BIO2010: Transforming Undergraduate Education for Future Research Biologists. National Academies Press, Washington, D.C.2003Google Scholar), but graduate education appears to lag significantly behind. We took an informal survey of top-ranked graduate programs in systems biology and biochemistry, molecular, and cellular biology. In the past decade, some programs have embraced a more student-centered approach to education, giving students more choice in which courses to take. However, the traditional intellectual delineations that define their curricula have remained essentially constant. Advanced education in the life sciences is generally organized along departmental boundaries (Figure 1, left). These silos are largely based on the scale at which the questions are asked in each field (i.e., the atomic scale up to that of whole organisms) and the methods used to answer them (e.g., X-ray crystallography or animal genetics). Typical curricula include biophysics, biochemistry, molecular biology, genetics, cell biology, and physiology, courses that likely derive from a time when each academic department had its own graduate program. Approximately 30 years ago, when the broader “umbrella” programs (including our own Biochemistry, Cellular and Molecular Biology program) became the predominant model for graduate training in the life sciences, these departmental course structures were used to build the new curricula for first-year students. Although this organization was politically and administratively simple, we believe that new educational models are required to overcome the challenges currently facing the life sciences: information overload, the need to train scientists whose research will transcend traditional departmental boundaries (Costello, 2009Costello L.C. Acad. Med. 2009; 84: 459-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar), and the goal of translating basic science into medical and technological advances. If the knowledge produced by each discipline, or silo (Figure 1), is separated from the underlying framework of methods that define it, we would be left with an armamentarium of techniques for studying biology at all levels, from the atomic to the organismal. A working knowledge of these methods would be a valuable foundation for students pursuing a research career. It would prime them to tackle fundamental biological questions with whatever methods are required, rather than limiting them to those techniques favored within their chosen subfields. The primary goal of such a “Methods and Analysis” (“M&A”) course would be to give graduate students conceptual familiarity with key techniques and analytical tools, rather than to train them to actually perform the experimental methods. Instead, they would learn to conduct the techniques in later years at the bench, as the need arises. The course would: (1) specify the kinds of information each technique provides, (2) point out the strengths and weaknesses of each approach, and (3) focus on how to use, understand, and judge the quality of the final data produced by each method. By the end of the year, students would understand and use data created through a broad range of methods, such as protein crystallography, bioinformatic analyses, and yeast genetic screens. This practical knowledge would then translate into increased productivity in the laboratory; once a student embarks on a thesis project, he or she would already know how to manipulate protein structure files from the Protein Data Bank, compare aligned gene sequences, and select residues to target for a mutagenesis study. The student would also immediately grasp the goals and potential pitfalls of a collaborator's yeast genetic screen. In addition to a working understanding of biomedical methods, graduate students would also greatly benefit from learning the organizing principles that link key facts across the biological specialties. Fortunately, the mountain of information that we have accumulated through decades of research is not a morass of unrelated facts but instead self-assembles into a network of interconnected processes (i.e., nodes) that describes biological systems. We propose that the processes taking place in an organism can be broken into three broad categories—gene expression, metabolism, and cell fate and function—as well as the connections (i.e., communication pathways) among the nodes. For example, protein synthesis is a node within gene expression. Our current understanding of protein synthesis is built from information obtained at all scales of investigation (Figure 1, right). Likewise, amino acid biosynthesis is a node in the metabolism category. These two nodes are connected to each other, as well as to the transcription node, by the general control nonrepressed 2 (GCN2) signaling pathway, which is also described by a body of information derived from each field. In the current silos framework of advanced biomedical education (Figure 1, left), it is difficult for students to integrate information about a biological process at all scales because this information is scattered throughout the curriculum. For example, protein synthesis might be covered through an isolated lecture on ribosome structure and function, followed 2 months later by a lecture on protein secretion, followed a month later by a lecture on peptide hormone signaling. We suggest that it makes more sense to teach the fundamental principles of each key node and connection using a framework in which knowledge is integrated across all scales. This “nodes and connections” (“N&C”) course would teach students about each key node from the “bottom” (i.e., atomic and molecular scales) to the “top” (i.e., the cellular and whole animal scales) before moving on to the next node. The nodes would then be connected to the communication pathways among them using a similar integrated strategy. We foresee significant advantages to teaching the life sciences with this model. First, biology is genuinely arranged as a set of interconnected processes—a fact recognized by the emerging field of systems biology (Kirschner, 2005Kirschner M.W. Cell. 2005; 121: 503-504Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). So teaching it this way would reflect the operation of living systems. It would also connect the atomic and molecular underpinnings of a system directly to the microscopic and macroscopic processes. In addition, this arrangement would make it easier for educators to identify the fundamental principles and essential facts that students in a particular subdiscipline should know as a foundation for future learning and research. The acid test would be whether particular information is crucial for understanding the overall operation of the node or its connection to other nodes. For example, students do not need to know the names and putative functions of all 12 eukaryotic translation initiation factors to develop a working knowledge of the fundamental principles of protein synthesis. Instead, they need to know the central components and steps in the protein synthesis pathway that are common to all organisms and the key differences in the process between bacteria and eukaryotes (e.g., Shine-Dalgarno sequence in the mRNA versus the 5′-cap and poly[A] tail). The choice of nodes and connections included in the curriculum, as well as the range of information presented about each node or connection, would vary depending on the needs of the target students. The third way that the N&C model would enhance biomedical education is by establishing a framework that students can use to organize the information that they acquire. We believe this framework would help them to retain more of what they learn and more easily expand their understanding of biological processes as new information is added throughout their careers. Finally, organizing advanced life sciences education with the N&C framework would facilitate the formation of interdisciplinary research collaborations. Teaching information across scales in this integrative fashion mirrors a recent proposal from Sharp et al., 2011Sharp P.A. Cooney C.L. Kastner M.A. Lees J. Sasisekharan R. Yaffe M.B. Bhatia S.N. Jacks T.E. Lauffenburger D.A. Langer R. et al.The Third Revolution: The Convergence of the Life Sciences, Physical Sciences and Engineering. MIT Press, Cambridge, MA2011Google Scholar calling for a shift from field-specific research in the biomedical sciences to a “convergence” model in which investigators work together across disciplinary boundaries (Sharp et al., 2011Sharp P.A. Cooney C.L. Kastner M.A. Lees J. Sasisekharan R. Yaffe M.B. Bhatia S.N. Jacks T.E. Lauffenburger D.A. Langer R. et al.The Third Revolution: The Convergence of the Life Sciences, Physical Sciences and Engineering. MIT Press, Cambridge, MA2011Google Scholar). The N&C approach would facilitate the development of graduate programs focusing on multidisciplinary training, which are required for producing future generations of biomedical researchers (Connelly et al., 2009Connelly T. Sharp P.A. Ausiello D. Bronner-Fraser M. Burke I. Burris J. Eisen J. Janetos A. Karp R. Kim P. et al.National Research Council (US) Committee on a New Biology for the 21st Century: Ensuring the United States Leads the Coming Biology Revolution. National Academies Press [U.S.], Washington, D.C.2009Google Scholar). Furthermore, it builds off current trends in undergraduate education toward more interdisciplinary teaching models (Stryer et al., 2003Stryer L. Breslow R. Gentile J. Hillis D.M. Hopfield J. Kopell N. Long S. Penhoet E. Steitz J.A. Stevens C. et al.BIO2010: Transforming Undergraduate Education for Future Research Biologists. National Academies Press, Washington, D.C.2003Google Scholar). Teaching a common framework for understanding and organizing information about biological systems would significantly enhance students' abilities to communicate and work with researchers across different fields. The existence of a common framework would also speed the translation of scientific discoveries into medical and technological advances. We propose that the M&A and N&C courses would use a variety of synergistic educational methods to optimize learning and help students gain skills in formulating and answering critical questions. For example, each session of the M&A course would begin with a short lecture on the technique under study. A workshop would then follow in which students, individually or in teams, analyze data generated by this technique. The goal of this analysis would be to answer questions about a system that they are currently studying in the N&C course. Likewise, the N&C course would consist of a mixture of lectures, team-based exercises in which students design experiments to answer questions about the given system, and discussions of “great papers” in which small groups explore seminal works that informed our understanding of key aspects of each system. Each graduate program would specify a set of core nodes and connections that its students must study. However, the N&C course could also incorporate more student-centric learning by allowing students to choose additional modules to study, depending on their interests. A capstone experience at the end of the first year would consist of teams of students with diverse backgrounds identifying important unanswered questions in the life sciences and developing multidisciplinary proposals for answering them. For the same reasons outlined above, basic science education for medical students would significantly benefit from reorganization of its teaching model into an interconnected nodes (“systems biology”) approach. Understanding phenotypic variation among patients requires integrated knowledge of genomic, molecular, and environmental variation, reflecting the nodes and connections concept (Wiener et al., 2010Wiener C.M. Thomas P.A. Goodspeed E. Valle D. Nichols D.G. Acad. Med. 2010; 85: 498-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). As scientists increasingly identify underlying molecular causes for macroscopic disease phenotypes, the N&C model will also create additional educational synergies. For example, it could improve medical students' retention of basic science information by relating it directly to clinical information. This increased retention, in turn, would enhance the students' abilities to diagnose and treat complex diseases when they become physicians. The integrative approach to learning about biological systems also dovetails with recent calls for competency-based, rather than course-constrained, premedical education (Alpern et al., 2009Alpern R.J. Long S. Åkerfeldt K. Ares M. Bond J. Dalley A.F. de Paula J. Dienstag J.L. Fishelder A.J. Friedlander M.J. et al.AAMC-HHMI Report: Scientific Foundations for Future Physicians. Association of American Medical Colleges, Washington, D.C.2009Google Scholar). Once foundational studies in the first-year M&A and N&C courses are completed, graduate students would begin their thesis research. At this stage, a graduate curriculum might include elective courses to expand students' knowledge and skills in specific areas and to hone their abilities to identify important questions and design strategies to answer them. These courses could include traditional literature-based seminars and hands-on training in experimental techniques (e.g., mass spectrometry). They could also incorporate team-based projects that bring together groups of students from diverse backgrounds to brainstorm solutions to important scientific questions or unmet medical and technological needs (Alberts and Fineberg, 2004Alberts B. Fineberg H.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2004; 101: 11177Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar, Humphrey et al., 2005Humphrey J.D. Coté G.L. Walton J.R. Meininger G.A. Laine G.A. Adv. Physiol. Educ. 2005; 29: 98-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). One of our main goals in putting forward this framework is to catalyze new thinking about advanced life sciences education. However, no model, including those currently in use or the one that we propose here, should be deemed successful without solid evidence. As pointed out recently (Feldon et al., 2010Feldon D.F. Maher M.A. Timmerman B.E. Science. 2010; 329: 282-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), we currently have no standardized methods for assessing the efficacy of graduate biomedical education. We urgently need approaches for determining the value of graduate curricula, perhaps benchmarking them against the null hypothesis “students would do equally well with no course work at all outside of apprenticeship in the laboratory.” There are many barriers to implementing our proposed changes, including a large commitment of faculty time and the necessary loss of some content that is currently taught. However, we feel that the potential benefits of our proposal outweigh these costs. The curriculum would better prepare students for the laboratory and would reduce the lag time for productive thesis research. In addition, the new teaching models required by this curriculum would catalyze collaborative, interdisciplinary research among both students and participating faculty, which we believe is a major benefit as support for field-specific science evaporates. Institutions, particularly medical schools, could further facilitate efforts for significant curricular change by explicitly recognizing them in both promotion and compensation considerations. We fear that, unless scientists are willing to develop new models for advanced biomedical education and to rigorously test and compare these models, we will fail to adequately equip today's students with the tools that are needed to push forward the boundaries of knowledge and to bring about the scientific and medical breakthroughs of the future."
https://openalex.org/W2088324532,"We have investigated a region of ∼310 kb of genomic DNA within polytene chromosome subdivisions 72A to 72D of Drosophila melanogaster. This region includes 57 predicted protein-coding genes. Seventeen of these genes are in six clusters that appear to have arisen by tandem duplication. Within this region we found 23 complementation groups that are essential for zygotic viability, and we have identified the transcription units for 18 of the 23. We also found a 55 kb region in 72D that is nonessential. Flies deficient for this region are viable and fertile. Within this nonessential region are 48 DNA sequences of 12 to 33 base pairs that are completely conserved among 12 distantly related Drosophila species. These sequences do not have the evolutionary signature of conserved protein-coding DNA sequences, nor do they appear to encode microRNAs, however, the strong selection suggests functions in wild populations that are not apparent in laboratory cultures. This region resembles dispensable gene deserts previously characterized in the mouse genome."
https://openalex.org/W2066742391,"Nucleosomes can block access to transcription factors. Thus the precise localization of nucleosomes relative to transcription start sites and other factor binding sites is expected to be a critical component of transcriptional regulation. Recently developed microarray approaches have allowed the rapid mapping of nucleosome positions over hundreds of kilobases (kb) of human genomic DNA, although these approaches have not yet been widely used to measure chromatin changes associated with changes in transcription. Here, we use custom tiling microarrays to reveal changes in nucleosome positions and abundance that occur when hormone-bound glucocorticoid receptor (GR) binds to sites near target gene promoters in human osteosarcoma cells. The most striking change is an increase in measured nucleosome occupancy at sites spanning ∼1 kb upstream and downstream of transcription start sites, which occurs one hour after addition of hormone, but is lost at 4 hours. Unexpectedly, this increase was seen both on GR-regulated and GR-non-regulated genes. In addition, the human SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling factor (a GR co-activator) was found to be important for increased occupancy upon hormone treatment and also for low nucleosome occupancy without hormone. Most surprisingly, similar increases in nucleosome occupancy were also seen on both regulated and non-regulated promoters during differentiation of human myeloid leukemia cells and upon activation of human CD4+ T-cells. These results indicate that dramatic changes in chromatin structure over ∼2 kb of human promoters may occur genomewide and in response to a variety of stimuli, and suggest novel models for transcriptional regulation."
