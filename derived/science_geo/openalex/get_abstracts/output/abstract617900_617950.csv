https://openalex.org/W2889977344,"Empiric probiotics are commonly consumed by healthy individuals as means of life quality improvement and disease prevention. However, evidence of probiotic gut mucosal colonization efficacy remains sparse and controversial. We metagenomically characterized the murine and human mucosal-associated gastrointestinal microbiome and found it to only partially correlate with stool microbiome. A sequential invasive multi-omics measurement at baseline and during consumption of an 11-strain probiotic combination or placebo demonstrated that probiotics remain viable upon gastrointestinal passage. In colonized, but not germ-free mice, probiotics encountered a marked mucosal colonization resistance. In contrast, humans featured person-, region- and strain-specific mucosal colonization patterns, hallmarked by predictive baseline host and microbiome features, but indistinguishable by probiotics presence in stool. Consequently, probiotics induced a transient, individualized impact on mucosal community structure and gut transcriptome. Collectively, empiric probiotics supplementation may be limited in universally and persistently impacting the gut mucosa, meriting development of new personalized probiotic approaches."

Contrary to homeostasis, antibiotic perturbation enhanced probiotics colonization in the human mucosa but only mildly improved colonization in mice. Compared to spontaneous post-antibiotic recovery, probiotics induced a markedly delayed and persistently incomplete indigenous stool/mucosal microbiome reconstitution and host transcriptome recovery toward homeostatic configuration, while aFMT induced a rapid and near-complete recovery within days of administration. In vitro, Lactobacillus-secreted soluble factors contributed to probiotics-induced microbiome inhibition.

Antibiotics have transformed medicine and the fight against common life-threatening bacterial infections (Van Boeckel et al., 2014Van Boeckel T.P. Gandra S. Ashok A. Caudron Q. Grenfell B.T.

However, widespread antibiotic exposure is associated with the emergence of resistant strains and with a variety of gastrointestinal (GI) effects, hypersensitivity, and drug-specific adverse effects, most notably antibiotic-associated diarrhea (AAD) in 5% to 35% of treated humans (Wiström et al., 2001Wiström J.

Dis. 1998; 16: 292-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). Non-selective antibiotics-induced disruption of commensal microbiome community structure (“dysbiosis”) accounts for up to 20% of all AAD cases (Bartlett, 2002Bartlett J.G. Clinical practice. Antibiotic-associated diarrhea.N. Engl. J. Med. 2002; 346: 334-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (959) Google Scholar). Such dysbiosis occurs rapidly within days, leading to altered bacterial metabolism and impaired host proteome in mice and humans (Ferrer et al., 2014Ferrer M. Martins dos Santos V.A. Ott S.J. Moya A.

Of note, studies in rodent models and humans suggest an association between antibiotic exposure, especially during early stages of life, and a host propensity for a variety of long-term disorders (Vangay et al., 2015Vangay P.

Probiotics have been proposed to constitute an effective preventive treatment for antibiotics-induced dysbiosis and associated adverse effects in mice (Ekmekciu et al., 2017Ekmekciu I. von Klitzing E.

Importantly, adverse effects associated with probiotics consumption may be under-reported in clinical trials (Bafeta et al., 2018Bafeta A. Koh M. Riveros C. Ravaud P. Harms Reporting in Randomized Controlled Trials of Interventions Aimed at Modifying Microbiota: A Systematic Review.Ann. Intern. Med. 2018; (Published online July 17, 2018)https://doi.org/10.7326/M18-0343Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), further complicating the efficacy debate. The extent and pattern of probiotic gut mucosal colonization and impact on the indigenous gut microbiome following antibiotic use also remain unclear. While few small-scale culture-based studies attempted to quantify supplemented probiotics in the antibiotics-perturbed GI mucosa (Klarin et al., 2005Klarin B. Johansson M.L. Molin G. Larsson A. Jeppsson B. Adhesion of the probiotic bacterium Lactobacillus plantarum 299v onto the gut mucosa in critically ill patients: a randomised open trial.Crit. Care. 2005; 9: R285-R293Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the vast majority of studies extrapolate their conclusions from stool samples, resulting in inconclusive findings regarding probiotics capability to restore the pre-antibiotics microbiome configuration (McFarland, 2014McFarland L.V. Use of probiotics to correct dysbiosis of normal microbiota following disease or disruptive events: a systematic review.BMJ Open. 2014; 4: e005047Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Importantly, no in vivo studies have directly examined the global extent of human mucosal probiotic colonization following antibiotic treatment and their impact on reconstitution of the indigenous mucosal microbiome or the host gut transcriptome. Here, we explored the impact of probiotics consumption following antibiotic exposure on the gut luminal, mucosal, and fecal microbiome composition and function and the GI transcriptome in mice and humans. To this aim, mice and a cohort of human volunteers were treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics and then either were supplemented with probiotics, underwent autologous fecal microbiome transplantation (aFMT), or were allowed to spontaneously recover over time. We found significant differences between mice and humans with respect to post-antibiotic probiotics gut mucosal colonization. Mice featured only a mild improvement in colonization of the “human-compatible” probiotics regimen upon antibiotic treatment as compared to homeostatic conditions, while humans demonstrated a marked colonization improvement in this setting. Importantly, post-antibiotic probiotic supplementation significantly delayed the extent of reconstitution of the indigenous fecal and mucosal microbiome (in both mice and humans) and the reversion of the gut transcriptome toward homeostatic configuration (in humans) compared to either spontaneous reconstitution or aFMT. In contrast, post-antibiotic aFMT in both mice and humans achieved a rapid and near-complete gut mucosal microbiome recolonization associated with reversion of the human gut transcriptome toward its pre-antibiotic configuration. Under homeostatic conditions (Zmora et al., 2018Zmora N. Zilberman-Schapira G. Suez J. Mor U. Dori-Bachash M. Bashiardes S. Kotler E. Zur M. Regev-Lehavi D. Brik R.B.-Z. et al.Personalized Gut Mucosal Colonization Resistance to Empiric Probiotics Is Associated with Unique Host and Microbiome Features.Cell. 2018; 174 (this issue): 1388-1405Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (695) Google Scholar), administration of a multi-strain probiotic preparation was associated with limited colonization in mice and with person-specific gut mucosal colonization resistance in humans. To study the post-antibiotic mucosal colonization capacity of probiotics and their impact on the indigenous mucosal microbiome as compared to aFMT or watchful waiting, we performed the MUcosal Search for Probiotic Impact and Colonization 3 (MUSPIC3) study in mice and in humans. In mice, we supplemented the drinking water of adult male wild-type (WT) C57BL/6 mice with a broad-spectrum antibiotic regimen of ciprofloxacin and metronidazole for 2 weeks. The immediate impact of antibiotic treatment on gut mucosal microbiome configuration was assessed in one group of mice sacrificed after the 2-week antibiotic exposure (Figure 1A, “Antibiotics”). The remaining animals (n = 30) were divided into three post-antibiotic intervention groups. In the first group (“Probiotics”), antibiotic treatment was followed by 4 weeks of daily administration by oral gavage of a commercially prescribed probiotics product involving 11 strains that was validated for composition and viability by multiple methods (Zmora et al., 2018Zmora N. Zilberman-Schapira G. Suez J. Mor U. Dori-Bachash M. Bashiardes S. Kotler E. Zur M. Regev-Lehavi D.

Each mouse of the second group (“aFMT”) received, on the day following cessation of antibiotics, an oral gavage of its own pre-antibiotics stool microbiome. A third group (“Spontaneous”) remained untreated following antibiotic therapy to assess the spontaneous recovery of the indigenous gut microbiome in this setting. An additional group of mice (“Control”) did not receive antibiotics or any other treatment and was followed throughout the study’s duration. We first assessed the fecal and mucosal colonization of probiotics following broad-spectrum antibiotic treatment in mice. 16S rDNA indicated that three of the four genera comprising the probiotics mix (Lactobacillus, Bifidobacterium, and Streptococcus) were present in stool samples even prior to antibiotic administration (Figures S1A–S1C). 1 day following probiotics administration, Lactobacillus (Figure S1A), Bifidobacterium (Figure S1B), and Lactococcus genera (Figure S1D) increased in relative abundance (RA). On day 4, only Bifidobacterium RA remained elevated, after which none of the genera RAs were significantly higher in the treated group (Figures S1A–S1D). Given the inability of 16S rDNA analysis to distinguish absolute abundance changes at the species level, we utilized a sensitive species-specific qPCR (Zmora et al., 2018Zmora N. Zilberman-Schapira G. Suez J. Mor U. Dori-Bachash M. Bashiardes S. Kotler E. Zur M. Regev-Lehavi D. Brik R.B.-Z. et al.Personalized Gut Mucosal Colonization Resistance to Empiric Probiotics Is Associated with Unique Host and Microbiome Features.Cell. 2018; 174 (this issue): 1388-1405Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (695) Google Scholar) targeting each of the tested 11-probiotic species. A pooled qPCR analysis for all species in stool indicated >10,000-fold fecal enrichment of probiotic species on days 1 and 4 of probiotic supplementation (Figure 1B), which rapidly declined in the following days, thereby losing statistical significance, though the trend persisted throughout the experiment (incremental area under the curve [iAUC] p < 0.0001 versus each group). A per-species analysis indicated 9 of the 11 species (all but BBI and LAC) to be significantly enriched in stool during probiotics supplementation (Figure 1C). Like in stool, 16S rDNA assessment of mucosal gut surfaces did not detect a significant elevation in the RA of any of the probiotics genera in any of the regions (Figures S1E–S1H). A pooled qPCR analysis for all administered probiotic species indicated significantly higher abundance in the lumen of the lower GI (LGI), but not the LGI mucosa (Figure 1D) or the upper GI (UGI; Figure 1E). The species that were significantly elevated in the lumen of the LGI tissues and the stomach were consistent with those shed in stool, while only BBR, LRH, and STH were significantly elevated in the LGI mucosa (Figure 1F). In comparison, mice that received probiotics using the same experimental design but without antibiotics pre-treatment featured a significantly lower aggregated probiotics load of all targets in the GI lumen, but not the mucosa (Figure S2A). These results indicate that resistance to the presence of probiotic species in the murine GI lumen is contributed by the resident microbiome. This resistance is partially alleviated by antibiotics, although even after antibiotics pre-treatment, the tested probiotics demonstrated mild and sporadic mucosal presence, potentially reflecting lower colonization capacity of these human-compatible probiotics species in the murine gut mucosa. We next determined the impact of the probiotic formulation on reconstitution of the indigenous murine fecal and mucosal gut microbiome community following antibiotic treatment. Expectedly, antibiotic treatment resulted in a dramatic reduction in stool alpha diversity (>66% reduction; Figure 2A) and general disruption of the fecal bacterial community structure as evident by unweighted UniFrac distances to baseline (Figure 2B). Of the three post-antibiotic interventions, aFMT was most efficient in restoring fecal bacterial richness to that observed in the control, with alpha diversity becoming indistinguishable to control within 8 days following aFMT (p = 0.11). In contrast, both probiotics and spontaneous recovery did not restore fecal alpha diversity to baseline levels 4 weeks following antibiotic cessation. Importantly, probiotics significantly delayed the return to baseline microbiome richness even compared to spontaneous recovery as evident in all tested time points (Figure 2A). Delayed murine probiotics-induced microbiome reconstitution was also reflected in the kinetics of return to pre-antibiotics baseline fecal composition as expressed by UniFrac distances. Expectedly, all treatment groups were dramatically shifted from baseline stool composition upon antibiotic treatment. While aFMT returned to baseline by day 28 after antibiotic treatment (p = 0.83; Figure 2B), both the probiotics and spontaneous recovery groups failed to fully return to baseline within 4 weeks of antibiotics cessation, with microbiome in the probiotics-administered group featuring the slowest recovery rate (p = 0.0001). As a greater distance to baseline in the probiotics-supplemented group may be merely a result of new exogenous bacteria introduced into the microbiome, we repeated the measurement after removing the four probiotics genera from the analysis and renormalizing RAs to 1 and corroborated the greater distance to baseline of the probiotics-supplemented group, reflecting an impaired indigenous mucosal microbiome reconstitution in this group (Figure S2B). A pairwise comparison of fecal microbial composition between the last day of follow-up and baseline demonstrated 28 taxa significantly differentially represented in the probiotics group (Figure S2C) with a >10-fold increase in the abundance of Blautia and no significant increase in any of the probiotics genera. Fewer significant differences were observed in the spontaneous recovery (16 taxa; Figure S2D) and aFMT (6 taxa; Figure S2E) groups. Of all taxa significantly reduced by antibiotics, 13 taxa belonging to 4 different phyla returned to baseline levels in both the aFMT and spontaneous recovery groups, but not in the probiotics group (Figure 2C). In contrast, five taxa were over-represented in the stool samples of the probiotics and significantly inversely correlated with alpha diversity: Akkermansia, Vagococcus, Enterococcus, Blautia, and Lactococcus. Of these, only Blautia bloomed exclusively in the probiotics group after antibiotics cessation (Figure 2D). Interestingly, macroscopic differences were noted between the ceca of probiotics-administered and spontaneously recovering mice, with the former being larger (representatives in Figure S2F) and significantly heavier (Figure S2G), reminiscent of germ-free mice or mice treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics. Consistent with the findings in stool, the number of observed species in the probiotics group was comparable to the group dissected immediately after 2 weeks of antibiotics and significantly lower compared to the control, aFMT, and spontaneous recovery groups in both the lumen and the mucosa of the LGI (Figure 2E) and UGI (Figure 2F). No significant differences were noted between the aFMT and control groups in any of the regions, whereas the richness in the spontaneous group was in between that of aFMT and probiotics (Figures 2E and 2F). Reduced alpha diversity in the LGI of the probiotics group was at least partly due to a total reduction in LGI bacterial load (Figure 2G). In agreement, the UniFrac distance to control of the mucosal and luminal aFMT microbiome configuration was lower than that of the spontaneously recovering group, with the largest distance to control featured by the probiotics-administered group (Figures 2H–2I and S2H). As in stool, these colonization differences could not be explained by the mere presence of probiotics genera in probiotics-administered mice, as the result remained unchanged even if probiotics genera were excluded from the analysis (Figures S2I and S2J). Interestingly, microbiome composition of aFMT-treated mice was indistinguishable from controls both in the LGI and the UGI, suggesting that fecal microbiome was sufficient to recapitulate the distinct UGI microbiome (Figure S2H). Of the taxa significantly reduced in the LGI mucosa of the antibiotics group compared to control, 16 returned to control levels in both the aFMT and the spontaneous recovery groups, but not in the probiotics group, of which 11 belonged to the Clostridiales order; two genera (Blautia and Streptococcus) significantly bloomed exclusively in the probiotics group (Figure 2J). Four taxa predominant in the probiotics group had a high (Spearman r < −0.6) and significant (p < 0.0001) inverse correlation with the alpha diversity in the LGI mucosa: Vagococcus, Akkermansia muciniphila, Blautia producta, and Enterococcus casseliflavus (Figure S2K). These blooming taxa may thus play a role in probiotics-induced inhibition of microbiome reconstitution. To ascertain that the delayed return to homeostatic indigenous microbiome configuration following probiotics treatment was not a unique feature of the studied vivarium, we performed the same set of interventions in mice housed in a different specific-pathogen-free (SPF) animal facility with distinct baseline fecal microbiome (26 taxa significantly differentially represented; Figure S3A). In this vivarium as well, aFMT induced a rapid indigenous microbiome post-antibiotic reconstitution as compared to watchful waiting, while the 11-strain probiotic treatment delayed the speed and magnitude of the recolonization process (Figures S3B–S3K). Collectively, 4 weeks of spontaneous recovery following a broad-spectrum antibiotic treatment in mice partially restored baseline gut mucosal configuration and bacterial richness and load. Watchful waiting was superior—in its rate of induction of indigenous microbiome reconstitution—to consumption of probiotics, which demonstrated little improvement of the post-antibiotics microbiome configuration and delayed the restoration of homeostatic composition and richness of the pre-antibiotic gut mucosal microbiome. In comparison to both watchful waiting and probiotics administration, aFMT constituted the most efficient treatment modality, enabling rapid restoration of both upper- and lower-gut mucosal microbiome to homeostatic configuration following antibiotic treatment in mice. We next set out to determine how the 11-strain probiotics or aFMT would affect the post-antibiotic human luminal and mucosa-associated microbiome reconstitution. To this aim, we conducted a prospective longitudinal interventional study in 21 healthy human volunteers not consuming probiotics (Table S1 and STAR Methods) who were given an oral broad-spectrum antibiotic treatment of ciprofloxacin and metronidazole at standard dosages for a period of 7 days (Figure 3A). Following antibiotic treatment, seven participants were followed by watchful waiting for spontaneous microbiome reconstitution, six participants received aFMT (STAR Methods), and eight participants received the aforementioned 11-strain probiotics preparation administered bi-daily for a period of 4 weeks (Figure 3A). Endoscopic examinations were performed twice in each of the 21 participants. A first colonoscopy and deep endoscopy were performed after completion of the week-long antibiotic course, thereby characterizing the post-antibiotics dysbiosis throughout the GI tract. A second colonoscopy and deep endoscopy were performed 3 weeks later (day 21) to assess the degree of gut mucosal and luminal reconstitution in each of the three treatment arms (Figure 3A). Multiple stool samples were collected at intervals indicated in Figure 3A up to 6 months from antibiotics cessation. In total, 337 luminal, 702 mucosal, and 557 stool samples, as well as 362 regional biopsies, were collected. Expectedly, antibiotic treatment in humans triggered a profound fecal microbial depletion (Figure S4A) and disruption of microbial community composition (Figure S4B) as observed in stool (Figures S4C and S4D), LGI mucosa (Figures S4E and S4F), and UGI mucosa (Figure S4G), with the latter region the least affected by antibiotics (Figure S4H). Compositional changes were accompanied by alteration of microbiome function in the stool and LGI as assessed by shotgun metagenomic sequencing (Figures S4I–S4K). Fecal 16S rDNA analysis demonstrated that all probiotics-related genera were found in stools prior to probiotics supplementation, and Lactobacillus, Lactococcus, and Streptococcus significantly expanded in RA following antibiotics treatment. All four probiotics genera remained significantly elevated compared to baseline during probiotics supplementation, though none were further elevated to the post-antibiotics levels. Following cessation of probiotic treatment, none of the genera remained significantly elevated compared to baseline (Figures S5A–S5D). A fecal species-level metagenomic analysis (MetaPhlAn2) also demonstrated an antibiotics-induced expansion in RA of 6 of 11 species compared to baseline (BBI, BBR, BLO, LAC, LLA, and STH; Figure S5E), while during probiotic treatment, all species expanded compared to baseline, but only BBI and BLO reached statistical significance with this method (Figure S5E). A shotgun metagenomic sequencing strain-specific method (Sharon et al., 2013Sharon I. Morowitz M.J. Thomas B.C. Costello E.K. Relman D.A. Banfield J.F. Time series community genomics analysis reveals rapid shifts in bacterial species, strains, and phage during infant gut colonization.Genome Res. 2013; 23: 111-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar) identified one of the probiotic strains in a single baseline day in stool, two of the probiotics strains (different than the one appearing at baseline) during antibiotic treatment, and six of the pill-specific strains (BBI, BBR, BLO, LLA, LPL, and LRH) in multiple days during probiotics exposure. BBI, BLO, and BBR were also shed after cessation by the same participants (Figure 3B). Fecal species-specific qPCR, the most sensitive method, revealed a significant fecal expansion during probiotics administration of the 11-probiotic species when considered together, with 7 of 11 species being significantly elevated from baseline when analyzed separately during consumption (BBR, BIN, LAC, LCA, LLA, LPL, and LRH; F"

Immunotherapy and antibodies that target regulators of immune activation such as CTLA-4, PD1, and PD-L1 have significantly improved survival in renal cell carcinoma, lung adenocarcinoma, and melanoma (Ribas and Wolchok, 2018Ribas A. Wolchok J.D. Cancer immunotherapy using checkpoint blockade.Science. 2018; 359: 1350-1355Crossref PubMed Scopus (2961) Google Scholar). Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is an aggressive form of invasive breast cancer, negatively defined by lack of appreciable expression of the therapeutic targets estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, and Her2 (Denkert et al., 2017Denkert C.

Molecular alterations in triple-negative breast cancer-the road to new treatment strategies.Lancet. 2017; 389: 2430-2442Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar). Consequently, radiation and chemotherapeutic neoadjuvant therapy are the current standard-of-care treatment. Several studies have shown increased tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) in TNBC compared to other breast cancers and correlations between specific immune subsets and prognosis (Andre et al., 2013Andre F. Dieci M.V. Dubsky P. Sotiriou C. Curigliano G. Denkert C. Loi S. Molecular pathways: involvement of immune pathways in the therapeutic response and outcome in breast cancer.Clin.

Many diagnostics have been suggested to delineate responders from non-responders, including expression of immuno-suppressive proteins, such as PD-L1 (Patel and Kurzrock, 2015Patel S.P. Kurzrock R. PD-L1 Expression as a Predictive Biomarker in Cancer Immunotherapy.Mol.

So far, however, no single biomarker has been sufficient for adequate patient stratification, presumably due to the complexity of the immune response to cancer (Maleki Vareki et al., 2017Maleki Vareki S. Garrigós C. Duran I. Biomarkers of response to PD-1/PD-L1 inhibition.Crit. Rev. Oncol. Hematol. 2017; 116: 116-124Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). To date, there is limited understanding of the tumor immune landscape: which immune cell types are found in the tumor, which cells express distinct immunoregulatory proteins, and how these vary between patients. Tumors are spatially organized ecosystems that are comprised of distinct cell types, each of which can assume a variety of phenotypes defined by co-expression of multiple proteins. Thus, to interrogate solid tumor biology and response to treatment, it is necessary to gauge the expression of a multitude of proteins with single-cell or even subcellular resolution while preserving spatial information. However, until recently, routine laboratory assays could only satisfy one of these two requirements—either measuring expression of one or two proteins in situ or many genes in cell suspensions from dissociated tissues (Chevrier et al., 2017Chevrier S. Levine J.H. Zanotelli V.R.T. Silina K. Schulz D. Bacac M. Ries C.H. Ailles L. Jewett M.A.S.

Insights. 2010; 5: 9-20Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This disparity between our conceptual understanding of the tumor ecosystem and the experimental tools at our disposal has driven the recent developments of multiplexed imaging modalities (Chen et al., 2015Chen K.H.

We have previously reported multiplexed ion beam imaging (MIBI), a method that uses secondary ion mass spectrometry to image antibodies tagged with isotopically pure elemental metal reporters in intact tissue sections (Angelo et al., 2014Angelo M. Bendall S.C. Finck R. Hale M.B. Hitzman C. Borowsky A.D. Levenson R.M. Lowe J.B. Liu S.D. Zhao S. et al.Multiplexed ion beam imaging of human breast tumors.Nat. Med. 2014; 20: 436-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (598) Google Scholar). We have since constructed a purpose-built instrument that utilizes high brightness primary ion sources, novel ion extraction optics, and time-of-flight mass spectrometry (TOF) to increase channel multiplexing and decrease acquisition times 50-fold (STAR Methods). MIBI-TOF now enables fully automated, 40-plex imaging of large fields of view (up to 1 mm2) at resolutions down to 260 nm. It is compatible with a wide range of sectioned tissues including formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) specimens, the primary preservation method of solid tissue biopsies in clinical anatomic pathology. In this study, we leveraged MIBI-TOF to identify salient features demonstrating a structured tumor-immune microenvironment in a retrospective cohort of 41 TNBC patients. We imaged 36 proteins, including tumor and immune antigens and immunoregulatory proteins, and developed an extensible deep-learning-based pipeline for standardized processing, segmentation, and quantification of cell types. We captured large differences between patients in both the composition and total number of immune cells. While the size of immune infiltrate spanned over two orders of magnitude, it correlated with tumor vascularity and immune composition. Co-occurrence of distinct immune populations across patients, in accordance with infiltrate size, suggests a lineage-specific interdependence where the presence of one cell type is frequently accompanied by the other. Simultaneously, we also evaluated the expression of four immunotherapy targets (PD-1, PD-L1, Lag3, and IDO) by distinct immune and tumor cell subsets and found differential enrichments across patients, highlighting the importance of multiplexed analysis. For example, PD-1 was primarily expressed on CD4+ T cells in some patients and on CD8+ T cells in others. Expression of multiple immunoregulatory proteins by the same cell was statistically enriched, and patients that express one immunosuppressive pathway were more likely to express another, with potential implications for combination immunotherapies. In addition, we developed a data-driven approach to assess the spatial proximity of cell types in tissues. We found that tumors with similarly sized immune infiltrates had different spatial organizations and divided the tumors into cold (no infiltrate), mixed (immune cells mixed with tumor cells), and compartmentalized (immune cells spatially separated from tumor cells). These subtypes were associated with distinct tumor and immune populations expressing immunoregulatory proteins. Highly ordered structures with PD-L1 and IDO along the tumor-immune border served as a hallmark of tumor compartmentalization and could be further linked to overall survival. Altogether, this work elucidates features of the tumor-immune microenvironment in TNBC and provides a starting framework for applying multiplexed imaging to uncover relational features of tumor, stromal, and immune cells in standard clinical specimens. The workflow for MIBI-TOF is comparable with that of conventional IHC (Figure 1A). Clinical FFPE tissue specimens were placed on a slide and stained overnight using a single master mix of elementally labeled primary antibodies (Bendall et al., 2011Bendall S.C. Simonds E.F. Qiu P. Amir A.D. Krutzik P.O. Finck R. Bruggner R.V. Melamed R. Trejo A. Ornatsky O.I. et al.Single-cell mass cytometry of differential immune and drug responses across a human hematopoietic continuum.Science. 2011; 332: 687-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (1672) Google Scholar). All targets are stained together without the need for cyclical steps or enzymatic reactions. The slide is placed in the MIBI-TOF mass spectrometer (Figure S1A), and the tissue is subjected to a nanometer-scale, rasterizing oxygen duoplasmatron primary ion beam. As this ion beam strikes the sample, elemental reporters conjugated to the antibodies are liberated as secondary ions, which are measured and quantified by a time-of-flight mass spectrometer. Thus, for each physical pixel in the tissue, a mass spectrum is recorded, representing the abundance of the antigens in that location (STAR Methods).Figure S1Experimental System and Validations for Multiplexed Imaging of the Tumor-Immune Microenvironment in TNBC, Related to Figure 1 and STAR MethodsShow full caption(A) Image of the MIBI-TOF machine.

We devised an antibody panel to interrogate 36 features of the tumor-immune microenvironment in TNBC (Figure 1A and Table S1). The panel included tumor-related proteins (e.g., EGFR and p53), functional markers for proliferation and metabolic activity (e.g., Ki-67 and pS6), immune-related proteins (e.g., CD4 and FoxP3), and four immunoregulatory proteins (PD-1, PD-L1, LAG3, and IDO) currently targeted in the clinic or undergoing immunotherapy drug trials. We performed several experiments to gauge assay sensitivity, specificity, and repeatability. Antibody staining for each target was validated using six tissue types. Representative panel staining for tonsil, placenta, gastrointestinal tract, and breast carcinoma are shown in Figure 1B. Each antibody was tested across five or more titers, with final titers selected to maximize the separation between signal and background (STAR Methods). We first evaluated whether the staining of each antibody was specific to the known histologic distribution for each target and matched conventional imaging using immunohistochemistry (Figure S1B). For example, bright epithelial staining for CK6 and CK17 was observed in morphologically distinct tumor cells in breast carcinoma, while very little was observed in the germinal or interfollicular regions in tonsil (negative staining not shown). CD20 primarily stained cells in the germinal center where B cells are the predominant population, while CD3 and CD4 primarily stained cells in the mantle zone, populated with T lymphocytes. (Figures 1B and 1D–1E). Second, we evaluated the subcellular localization of the different antigens. Expectedly, we find that transcription factors (e.g., Ki-67 and FoxP3), are predominantly nuclear whereas membrane proteins (e.g., CD4 and CD20) have low overlap with the nucleus (<10%, Figures 1F and 1G). Third, we assessed the co-expression of proteins known to be expressed either on the same cell type or on different cell types. For example, consistent with T cell differentiation as either a helper (CD3+CD4+, Figure 1H, white arrows) or cytotoxic (CD3+CD8+, Figure 1H, yellow arrows) phenotype, we find that less than 3% of the CD3+CD4+ pixels are also CD8+ (Figures 1H and S1C). Consistent with a T regulatory (Treg) phenotype, 99% of the FoxP3+ cells were positive for CD4 (Figure 1F). To quantify cross-talk between markers, we stained three serial sections from tonsil using four sub-panels, each one with six distinct empty channels. For each sub-panel, we verified that the empty channels gave <0.1% of the original signal (Figure 1C). Finally, we asserted the high reproducibility of our system by staining serial sections from human lymph node (R = 0.9, p < 10−20 Figure S1D). Altogether, our assay allows to robustly image 36 antigens at sub-cellular resolution with a dynamic range sufficient for quantifying both high and low-abundance proteins in intact FFPE human tissues. We applied MIBI-TOF to profile a tissue microarray of 41 TNBC patients treated at Stanford hospital between 2002–2015 (Table S2). All samples were stained simultaneously using a single antibody master-mix and scanned together to reduce technical variability. For each sample, we profiled a region of 8002 μm2, 2048 × 2048 pixels, at 500 nm resolution, obtaining information on thousands of cells (3,000–10,000 across patients). All the data, encompassing 1,763 images, is available at https://mibi-share.ionpath.com in a user-friendly interface, facilitating browsing. An initial overview identified large inter-patient heterogeneity in tumor protein expression, such as Keratins, EGFR, and HLA-DR (Figure 1I and S1E–S1J). We developed a computational pipeline for data analysis (STAR Methods). For each field of view (FOV), the counts for each reporter in each pixel were extracted from the mass spectra and converted to a multi-dimensional TIFF, which was background subtracted using a blank channel. Noise was filtered using a k-nearest-neighbor approach, and batch effects were removed using quantile normalization (Figures S2A–S2F). To segment the cells from the images, we leveraged the high dimensionality of our data to adapt DeepCell (Van Valen et al., 2016Van Valen D.A. Kudo T. Lane K.M. Macklin D.N. Quach N.T. DeFelice M.M. Maayan I. Tanouchi Y. Ashley E.A. Covert M.W. Deep Learning Automates the Quantitative Analysis of Individual Cells in Live-Cell Imaging Experiments.PLoS Comput. Biol. 2016; 12: e1005177Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar), a convolutional neural network (CNN) for nuclear segmentation (Figure 2A and STAR Methods). To train the network, we manually segmented the nuclei of two patients (∼8 million pixels). The network achieved a per-pixel accuracy score of 74% on the training set and 73% on the validation (Figure S2G). We applied the trained network to all patients in the cohort, and output probability scores were post-processed to generate the final segmentation mask. The CNN approach yielded dramatically improved results compared with alternative methods tested (Figure S2H). Following segmentation, we extracted the single-cell expression values for all the markers and clustered the cells from all patients (Van Gassen et al., 2015Van Gassen S. Callebaut B. Van Helden M.J.

To chart the immune landscape in TNBC, we quantified the number of immune cells per area across patients and found large variability, spanning more than two orders of magnitude (Figure 2B). This variability was confirmed by pathological TIL scoring on H&E staining of the entire cohort, as well as H&E staining of an additional core for patients 1–14, to establish low contribution of intra-patient variability in immune infiltration to these results (Figures S3A and S3B and Table S2). To control for differences in absolute cell counts, we also quantified the fraction of immune cells in the field, which accordingly ranged from 1%–91% (Figure S4A). Total immune content was highly correlated with the amount of CD31+ vascular endothelium cells (Figures 2C and 2D).

Here, we present global 24-hr metabolite profiles of eight different tissues under conditions of energy balance (standard chow) or chronic nutrient stress (high-fat diet [HFD]). We reveal how metabolic pathways are gated to specific temporal and spatial windows and how novel tissue-specific and inter-organ 24-hr dynamics emerge under HFD. Our Resource highlights temporal links between muscle insulin resistance, hepatic steatosis, atherosclerosis, and reduced energy expenditure. We performed 24-hr metabolomics profiling on eight different murine tissues: suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), gastrocnemius skeletal muscle, interscapular brown adipose tissue (BAT), epididymal white adipose tissue (WAT), liver, serum, and cauda epididymal sperm (Figure 1A). Tissues were collected every 4 hr across the light/dark cycle from a single cohort of C57BL/6J mice after 10 weeks of ad libitum access to standard chow or HFD. Mice fed HFD had rhythmic energy intake indistinguishable from chow-fed mice (Eckel-Mahan et al., 2013Eckel-Mahan K.L. Patel V.R. de Mateo S. Orozco-Solis R. Ceglia N.J. Sahar S. Dilag-Penilla S.A.

Hundreds of metabolites covering a range of metabolite classes were detected in each tissue by mass spectrometry (liquid chromatography [LC/MS] and gas chromatography [GC/MS]) (Figures 1B and 1C). All data are available on CircadiOmics (http://circadiomics.igb.uci.edu/) (Patel et al., 2012Patel V.R. Eckel-Mahan K. Sassone-Corsi P. Baldi P. CircadiOmics: integrating circadian genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics and metabolomics.Nat. Methods. 2012; 9: 772-773Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), including interactive networks to explore the data. Tissue-specific differences in metabolite number, temporal oscillations, and impact of HFD were apparent (Figure 1B). While class distribution was similar across tissues (Figure 1C), relative metabolite abundance reflected tissue composition (Figure 1D): WAT and BAT revealed mostly lipids; brain and muscle showed amino acids and lipids; liver and serum showed mostly carbohydrates and comparable amounts of amino acids, lipids, and energy metabolites; sperm contained mostly lipids and energy metabolites. The impact of HFD varied among tissues (Figures 1C and 1E). While ∼540 total metabolites were detected in both mPFC and muscle, >3-fold more metabolites were altered by HFD in muscle than in mPFC (232 significantly impacted in muscle versus 75 in mPFC). Overall, WAT, liver, BAT, muscle, and serum were most impacted by HFD, with 40%–60% of detected metabolites showing significant alterations (Table 1). Brain and sperm metabolites appeared more resistant to diet-induced metabolite alterations, with SCN, mPFC, and sperm showing alterations in only 27%, 14%, and 8% of metabolites, respectively.Table 1Percent Metabolites Impacted by HFD (Diet Effect p < 0.05, Linear Regression Model)tissue%WAT63liver55BAT52muscle43serum41SCN27mPFC14sperm8 Open table in a new tab Subpathway enrichment analysis of significantly altered metabolites (Table S1) identified specific lipid classes altered by HFD, including long-chain fatty acids, polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), diacylglycerols, phospholipids, sphingolipids, glycerolipids, and lysolipids. Metabolites involved in amino acid metabolism, particularly the urea cycle metabolites arginine and proline but also lysine, branched-chain amino acids (BCAA) leucine, isoleucine and valine, and dipeptides were also highly impacted. Altered abundance of metabolites suggested tissue pathology (Figure 1F). For example, carbohydrates comprised 53% of liver metabolites on chow and made up only 8% altered by HFD, while lipids comprised only 11% on chow yet 52% altered by HFD (Figure 1D), suggesting hepatic steatosis. Skeletal muscles on HFD exhibited a large accumulation of lipids known to negatively impact insulin sensitivity. Comparing circadian metabolites (i.e., oscillating with a 24-hr period) revealed major differences in how 24-hr metabolism is organized among different tissues. Serum, BAT, liver, skeletal muscle, and mPFC are all highly dynamic tissues (Figure 2), with 20%–50% of metabolites showing 24-hr oscillation regardless of diet. While lipids comprised the largest class detected in each tissue (Figure 1C), the numbers of cycling lipids varied widely among tissues on both diets (Figure 2). For example, we detected more cycling lipids in BAT, mPFC, and serum on chow compared to SCN, muscle, WAT, and liver. Furthermore, BAT, mPFC, and serum all lost lipid oscillation on HFD, while SCN surprisingly gained ∼100 de novo oscillating lipids. We also noted a marked temporal gating of 24-hr cycling lipids to the light phase in mPFC, BAT, and serum on chow, with peaks slightly different in each tissue. Lipids peaked around Zeitgeber time (ZT) 6 in mPFC, ZT6–ZT8 in serum, and ZT8–ZT10 in BAT. Skeletal muscle showed a more diverse and temporally compartmentalized distribution of 24-hr cycling metabolite peaks on chow. Carbohydrates peaked around ZT2, whereas nucleotides peaked around ZT8, and amino acids around ZT18. Amino acid peaks were drastically altered on HFD, shifting to around ZT8–ZT10 with a secondary peak at ZT20, highlighting a massive reorganization of muscle amino acid metabolism on HFD. Disease-associated metabolite enrichment (Xia and Wishart, 2016Xia J. Wishart D.S. Using MetaboAnalyst 3.0 for comprehensive metabolomics data analysis.Curr Protoc Bioinformatics. 2016; 55: 14.10.11-14.10.91Crossref Scopus (1074) Google Scholar) of these revealed an association with “degradation of skeletal muscle,” highlighting a potential pathologic underpinning. Indeed, short-term HFD in mice accelerates skeletal muscle atrophy of the soleus upon denervation (Roseno et al., 2015Roseno S.L. Davis P.R. Bollinger L.M. Powell J.J. Witczak C.A. Brault J.J. Short-term, high-fat diet accelerates disuse atrophy and protein degradation in a muscle-specific manner in mice.Nutr. Metab. (Lond.). 2015; 12: 39Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), while 16 weeks of chronic HFD in rats causes gastrocnemius atrophy and upregulation of ubiquitin ligase Murf1 (Sishi et al., 2011Sishi B. Loos B. Ellis B. Smith W. du Toit E.F. Engelbrecht A.M. Diet-induced obesity alters signalling pathways and induces atrophy and apoptosis in skeletal muscle in a prediabetic rat model.Exp. Physiol. 2011; 96: 179-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Cauda epidydimal sperm (Figures S1A and S1B) displayed relatively few oscillating metabolites (Figure 2). However, glycolytic intermediates 2- and 3-phosphoglycerate oscillated only on chow (Figure S1C), while more than 40% of all lysolipids were significantly reduced during the dark phase on HFD (Figure S1D). Circadian metabolite subpathway enrichment revealed common and tissue-specific metabolite classes (Table S2). Independent of diet, serum and muscle maintained robust 24-hr oscillation of BCAA metabolites, while on HFD, both serum and muscle gained additional circadian enrichment of metabolites involved in glycine, serine, and threonine metabolism. Muscle further gained 24-hr oscillation of metabolites related to alanine and aspartate metabolism on HFD, while BAT gained oscillation of guanine-containing purine nucleotides. Coherent temporal gating of metabolic pathways is essential for maintenance of tissue homeostasis (Noguchi et al., 2013Noguchi R. Kubota H. Yugi K. Toyoshima Y. Komori Y. Soga T. Kuroda S. The selective control of glycolysis, gluconeogenesis and glycogenesis by temporal insulin patterns.Mol. Syst. Biol. 2013; 9: 664Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). We hypothesized that metabolites sharing positive temporal correlation may have common origins or functions and belong to related metabolic networks, whereas metabolites with negative correlation may reflect temporal gating of incompatible pathways. Furthermore, temporal correlation of metabolites can serve as a general index for synchronization of individual cells within a tissue, since dynamic pathways should be highly correlated among synchronized cells. We found extensive positive and negative temporal correlations among metabolites in all tissues (Figures 3A and 3B ), and interestingly, many tissues lost metabolite correlations on HFD. Serum and BAT lost 98% and 74%, respectively, whereas liver and muscle lost only 34% and 39%, respectively. This suggests maintenance and/or reorganization of metabolic pathways in liver and muscle. On the other hand, the severe loss of intra-tissue metabolite correlations in serum has major implications for how misalignment among tissues may be exacerbated by nutritional challenge. We next visualized significant positive and negative temporal correlations according to metabolite class (Figure 3C). Serum lipids showed the greatest degree of temporal correlation with other metabolites, especially amino acids. Importantly, these were severely reduced on HFD, with serum amino acids and peptides gaining correlations. Major positive correlations among BAT nucleotides, lipids, and amino acids were lost on HFD. While muscle and liver similarly lost temporal correlation among metabolite classes, they also maintained substantial metabolite correlations on HFD, particularly among amino acids and carbohydrates. Subpathway enrichment analysis of significantly correlated metabolites revealed maintenance of carbohydrate correlations on HFD, with muscle glycolytic intermediates and liver sugar metabolites retaining temporal correlation (Table S3), in agreement with enrichment analysis (Table S2). However, serum lost correlation among essential fatty acids on HFD, in addition to several medium chain fatty acids, and lysolipids, while muscle lost correlation among acylcarnitines, as well as tricarboxylic acid (TCA, or Krebs) cycle metabolites. Furthermore, both serum and muscle gained correlations among BCAA and other amino acids on HFD, suggesting a coordinated response. Using temporal associations, one can reconstruct metabolic pathways over 24 hr. For example, muscle glycolytic intermediates and acylcarnitines respectively reflect cytosolic or mitochondrial ATP production. Both metabolite classes showed dynamic oscillation over 24 hr (Figure 3D). On chow, peaks were confined to distinct temporal windows, reflecting delineation of diurnal fuel preference. Glycolytic intermediates declined across the light phase, whereas acylcarnitines increased toward the end. Acylcarnitines were lowest in the middle of the dark phase when glycolytic intermediates were increased. However, on HFD oscillation of glycolytic intermediates was blunted during the dark phase, while acylcarnitines remained at peak levels. These coordinated metabolite alterations imply impaired metabolic flexibility and may contribute to insulin resistance. Visualization of inter-tissue metabolite temporal correlations revealed metabolic coupling between tissues (Figure 4A). Importantly, serum emerged as a main source of metabolite correlations on chow, underscoring the role of circulating factors in temporal communication, as serum metabolites both direct and reflect tissue-specific metabolism. HFD was associated with a severe loss of temporal coherence (Figure 4B), specifically between serum and muscle, liver, and BAT (Figures 4C). Comparative inspection of cross-tissue correlations between serum, liver, muscle, and BAT further emphasized HFD-induced loss and reorganization of metabolite correlations (Figure 5). Normally abundant liver-serum and muscle-serum metabolite correlations were reduced ∼60% on HFD (Figure S2A), while BAT-serum correlations were reduced 74%. Lipids and amino acids were the main metabolite classes correlated between serum and other tissues on chow, comprising ∼60%–70% of all significant inter-tissue metabolite correlations. Interestingly, BAT and serum nucleotides showed a relatively high degree of temporal correlation. Importantly, most cross-tissue metabolite correlations were lost on HFD (Figure S2B), with inter-tissue lipids losing ∼80% in all tissues and amino acids losing 35%–66%, depending on the tissue (Figure S2C). A majority of HFD inter-tissue metabolite correlations were not shared on chow. These de novo correlations were especially prevalent among muscle, serum, and liver amino acids, again highlighting coordinated metabolic responses linking these tissues.Figure 5Serum, Liver, Muscle and BAT Cross-Tissue Metabolite Correlations Severely Altered by HFDShow full captionNetworks of significantly correlated metabolites detected on chow or HFD.

Our data revealed significant HFD-specific metabolite correlations and de novo oscillations linking increased muscle protein degradation to liver gluco- and glyceroneogenesis. We noted diurnal rhythms of glutamine and alanine in muscle and liver were gated to distinct temporal windows on chow, oscillating anti-phase to one another (Figure 6A). However, circulating alanine remained relatively stable across the circadian cycle in chow-fed mice yet on HFD became highly oscillatory and increased during the light phase. This effect was even more pronounced in skeletal muscle on HFD, with alanine levels constitutively elevated across the light phase. There were no major HFD-induced changes in alanine levels in liver or WAT, whereas BAT showed slightly reduced levels. Increased alanine production and release by skeletal muscle normally occurs in response to increased protein catabolism during periods of starvation (Felig, 1973Felig P. The glucose-alanine cycle.Metabolism. 1973; 22: 179-207Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar). The rate of muscle protein degradation is often clinically inferred by levels of 3-methylhistidine, a unique amino acid released by myofibrillar proteolysis and excreted in the urine (Elia et al., 1981Elia M. Carter A. Bacon S. Winearls C.G. Smith R. Clinical usefulness of urinary 3-methylhistidine excretion in indicating muscle protein breakdown.Br. Med. J. (Clin. Res. Ed.). 1981; 282: 351-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). We detected 3-methylhistidine only in serum and skeletal muscle, with both tissues showing 24-hr oscillation on chow and HFD (Figure 6B). However, peak 3-methylhistidine was significantly increased on HFD, suggesting increased muscle protein degradation. We also noted increased creatinine in serum on HFD and a similar trend in muscle, indicating that muscle mass is maintained or even slightly increased despite protein breakdown and suggesting increased overall rates of muscle protein turnover on HFD. The majority of alanine released from muscle is synthesized de novo by transamination of pyruvate, with nitrogen originating mostly from BCAA via glutamate (Odessey and Goldberg, 1979Odessey R. Goldberg A.L. Leucine degradation in cell-free extracts of skeletal muscle.Biochem. J. 1979; 178: 475-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Serum, muscle, and liver BCAA showed 24-hr oscillation on chow and HFD, with increased levels during the dark phase and reduced levels during the light phase (Figure S3A). Serum and muscle from HFD mice also showed increased BCAA levels at various time points compared to chow mice, whereas BCAA levels in liver, WAT, and BAT were all significantly reduced on HFD. While most amino acids are transaminated in the liver, BCAA are transaminated mainly in skeletal muscle, resulting in formation of branched-chain keto acids (BCKA) α-ketoisocaproate, α-ketomethylvalerate, and α-ketoisovalerate. All three BCKAs were drastically reduced and lost 24-hr oscillation in muscle on HFD (Figure S3B), yet serum BCKA levels were significantly increased, suggesting augmented export from muscle and/or reduced uptake from other tissues. Another striking effect of HFD was the specific increase of glucogenic amino acids in muscle and serum, with reduction in liver, WAT, and BAT (Figure S3A), possibly reflecting increased rates of gluco- and glycerone"
https://openalex.org/W2892257190,"The metabolic state of a cell is influenced by cell-extrinsic factors, including nutrient availability and growth factor signaling. Here, we present extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling as another fundamental node of cell-extrinsic metabolic regulation. Unbiased analysis of glycolytic drivers identified the hyaluronan-mediated motility receptor as being among the most highly correlated with glycolysis in cancer. Confirming a mechanistic link between the ECM component hyaluronan and metabolism, treatment of cells and xenografts with hyaluronidase triggers a robust increase in glycolysis. This is largely achieved through rapid receptor tyrosine kinase-mediated induction of the mRNA decay factor ZFP36, which targets TXNIP transcripts for degradation. Because TXNIP promotes internalization of the glucose transporter GLUT1, its acute decline enriches GLUT1 at the plasma membrane. Functionally, induction of glycolysis by hyaluronidase is required for concomitant acceleration of cell migration. This interconnection between ECM remodeling and metabolism is exhibited in dynamic tissue states, including tumorigenesis and embryogenesis."

The mechanisms controlling autophagy in neuronal development are not fully understood. Here, we found that conditional deletion of the Forkhead Box O transcription factors FoxO1, FoxO3, and FoxO4 strongly impaired autophagic flux in developing neurons of the adult mouse hippocampus. Moreover, FoxO deficiency led to altered dendritic morphology, increased spine density, and aberrant spine positioning in adult-generated neurons. Strikingly, pharmacological induction of autophagy was sufficient to correct abnormal dendrite and spine development of FoxO-deficient neurons. Collectively, these findings reveal a novel link between FoxO transcription factors, autophagic flux, and maturation of developing neurons."
https://openalex.org/W2891753225,"Many disease-causing missense mutations affect intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) of proteins, but the molecular mechanism of their pathogenicity is enigmatic. Here, we employ a peptide-based proteomic screen to investigate the impact of mutations in IDRs on protein-protein interactions. We find that mutations in disordered cytosolic regions of three transmembrane proteins (GLUT1, ITPR1, and CACNA1H) lead to an increased clathrin binding. All three mutations create dileucine motifs known to mediate clathrin-dependent trafficking. Follow-up experiments on GLUT1 (SLC2A1), the glucose transporter causative of GLUT1 deficiency syndrome, revealed that the mutated protein mislocalizes to intracellular compartments. Mutant GLUT1 interacts with adaptor proteins (APs) in vitro, and knocking down AP-2 reverts the cellular mislocalization and restores glucose transport. A systematic analysis of other known disease-causing variants revealed a significant and specific overrepresentation of gained dileucine motifs in structurally disordered cytosolic domains of transmembrane proteins. Thus, several mutations in disordered regions appear to cause ""dileucineopathies."""
https://openalex.org/W2891360421,"Strawberry is a well-known source of natural antioxidants with excellent free radical scavenging capacity. This study determined the effects of chitosan application in field condition on plant growth, fruit yield and antioxidant activities in strawberry fruit. Foliar applications of chitosan on strawberry significantly increased plant growth and fruit yield (up to 42% higher) compared to untreated control. Increased fruit yield was attributed to higher plant growth, individual fruit weight and total fruit weight/plant due to the chitosan application. Surprisingly, the fruit from plants sprayed with chitosan also had significantly higher contents (up to 2.6-fold) of carotenoids, anthocyanins, flavonoids and phenolics compared to untreated control. Total antioxidant activities in fruit of chitosan treated plants were also significantly higher (ca. 2-fold) (p< 0.05) than untreated control. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of chitosan applied on field plants providing significant improvement of both yield and health benefiting biochemical contents in strawberry fruit. Further study on the elucidation of mechanisms involved with enhancement of growth, yield and biochemical contents by chitosan is needed to promote sustainable production of strawberry."
https://openalex.org/W2891171572,"Distinct neuronal types connect in complex ways to generate functional neural circuits. The molecular diversity required to specify this connectivity could be supplied by multigene families of synaptic recognition molecules, but most studies to date have assessed just one or a few members at a time. Here, we analyze roles of cadherins (Cdhs) in formation of retinal circuits comprising eight neuronal types that inform the brain about motion in four directions. We show that at least 15 classical Cdhs are expressed by neurons in these circuits and at least 6 (Cdh6–10 and 18) act individually or in combinations to promote specific connectivity among the cells. They act in part by directing the processes of output neurons and excitatory interneurons to a cellular scaffold formed by inhibitory interneurons. Because Cdhs are expressed combinatorially by many central neurons, similar interactions could be involved in patterning circuits throughout the brain."

We developed a machine-learning framework to integrate personal genomes and electronic health record (EHR) data and used this framework to study abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA), a prevalent irreversible cardiovascular disease with unclear etiology. Performing whole-genome sequencing on AAA patients and controls, we demonstrated its predictive precision solely from personal genomes. By modeling personal genomes with EHRs, this framework quantitatively assessed the effectiveness of adjusting personal lifestyles given personal genome baselines, demonstrating its utility as a personal health management tool. We showed that this new framework agnostically identified genetic components involved in AAA, which were subsequently validated in human aortic tissues and in murine models. Our study presents a new framework for disease genome analysis, which can be used for both health management and understanding the biological architecture of complex diseases. VIDEO ABSTRACT."
https://openalex.org/W2889701183,"Background Birth asphyxia, which accounts for 31.6% of all neonatal deaths, is one of the leading causes of such mortality in Ethiopia. Early recognition and management of its contributing factors would modify the problem. Thus, this study aimed to identify the determinants of birth asphyxia among live births at the University of Gondar Referral Hospital, northwest Ethiopia. Methods A hospital-based unmatched case-control study was conducted from April to July 2017.Cases were newborn babies with an APGAR score of < 7at 5 minutes of birth; controls were newborn babies with an APGAR score of ≥7 at 5 minutes of birth. Every other asphyxiated baby was selected as a case and every 6th non-asphyxiated baby as a control. A pretested structured questionnaire was used to collect data on maternal sociodemographic characteristics. A pretested structured checklist was used to retrieve data on ante-partum, intra-partum, and neonatal factors of both cases and controls. Data were entered using Epi Info 7 and analyzed using SPSS 20. The bivariate logistic regression analysis was used to identify the relation of each independent variable to the outcome variable. Variables with p values of up to 0.2 in the bivariate analysis were considered for the multiple logistic regression analysis. An adjusted odds ratio (AOR) with a 95% CI and p-value of <0.05 was used to identify significant variables associated with birth asphyxia. Results In this study, prolonged labor (AOR = 2.75, 95% CI: 1.18, 6.94), cesarean section delivery (AOR = 3.58, 95% CI: 1.13, 11.31), meconium stained amniotic fluid (AOR = 7.69, 95% CI: 2.99, 17.70), fetal distress (AOR = 5.74, 95% CI: 1.53, 21.55), and low birth weight (AOR = 7.72, 95% CI: 1.88, 31.68) were factors which significantly increased the odds of birth asphyxia. Conclusion Prolonged labor, cesarean section (CS) delivery, meconium stained amniotic fluid (AF), fetal distress, and low birth weight were the determinants of birth asphyxia. Thus, efforts should be made to improve the quality of intra-partum care services in order to prevent prolonged labor and fetal complications, and to identify and make a strict follow up on mothers with meconium stained amniotic fluid."
https://openalex.org/W2889727268,"Background Most electronic-cigarette liquids contain propylene glycol, glycerin, nicotine and a wide variety of flavors of which many are sweet. Sweet flavors are classified as saccharides, esters, acids or aldehydes. This study investigates changes in cariogenic potential when tooth surfaces are exposed to e-cigarette aerosols generated from well-characterized reference e-liquids with sweet flavors. Methods Reference e-liquids were prepared by combining 20/80 propylene glycol/glycerin (by volume fraction), 10 mg/mL nicotine, and flavors. Aerosols were generated by a Universal Electronic-Cigarette Testing Device (49.2 W, 0.2 Ω). Streptococcus mutans (UA159) were exposed to aerosols on tooth enamel and the biological and physiochemical parameters were measured. Results E-cigarette aerosols produced four-fold increase in microbial adhesion to enamel. Exposure to flavored aerosols led to two-fold increase in biofilm formation and up to a 27% decrease in enamel hardness compared to unflavored controls. Esters (ethyl butyrate, hexyl acetate, and triacetin) in e-liquids were associated with consistent bacteria-initiated enamel demineralization, whereas sugar alcohol (ethyl maltol) inhibited S. mutans growth and adhesion. The viscosity of the e-liquid allowed S. mutans to adhere to pits and fissures. Aerosols contained five metals (mean ± standard deviation): calcium (0.409 ± 0.002) mg/L, copper (0.011 ± 0.001) mg/L, iron (0.0051 ± 0.0003) mg/L, magnesium (0.017 ± 0.002) mg/L, and silicon (0.166 ± 0.005) mg/L. Conclusions This study systematically evaluated e-cigarette aerosols and found that the aerosols have similar physio-chemical properties as high-sucrose, gelatinous candies and acidic drinks. Our data suggest that the combination of the viscosity of e-liquids and some classes of chemicals in sweet flavors may increase the risk of cariogenic potential. Clinical investigation is warranted to confirm the data shown here."
https://openalex.org/W2891408276,"Extensive research strongly suggests that amyloid beta (Aβ) aggregates in the brain have a central role in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) pathogenesis. Pathological Aβ deposition is likely due to an altered balance between overproduction and elimination. Rodent studies have suggested that the liver has a major role in Aβ degradation. It is possible alterations of liver function could affect brain Aβ levels through changes in blood Aβ concentration. In this study, we hypothesized hepatic Aβ degradation to be impaired in AD subjects. To test our hypothesis, an Aβ degradation assay was developed using synthetic fluorescein-labeled Aβ40 and Aβ42 spiked into human liver homogenates. Aβ degradation rates were lower in AD-derived homogenates as compared with those from non-demented (ND) control subjects, even after accounting for such covariates as age, sex, and APOE genotype. The protein expression of potential Aβ-degrading enzymes were also examined. Neprilysin levels were not different in AD liver samples, while cathepsin D and insulin-degrading enzyme were significantly altered in AD subjects. The results support the possibility that impaired hepatic Aβ degradation could be a factor contributing to increased brain Aβ accumulation and AD."
https://openalex.org/W2896444158,"Glutamine is a key nutrient required for sustaining cell proliferation, contributing to nucleotide, protein, and lipid synthesis. The mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) is a highly conserved protein complex that acts as a sensor of nutrients, relaying signals for the shift from catabolic to anabolic metabolism. Although glutamine plays an important role in mTORC1 activation, the mechanism is not clear. Here we describe a leucine- and Rag-independent mechanism of mTORC1 activation by glutamine that depends on phospholipase D and the production of phosphatidic acid, which is required for the stability and activity of mTORC1. The phospholipase D–dependent activation of mTORC1 by glutamine depended on the GTPases ADP ribosylation factor 1 (Arf1), RalA, and Rheb. Glutamine deprivation could be rescued by α-ketoglutarate, a downstream metabolite of glutamine. This mechanism represents a distinct nutrient input to mTORC1 that is independent of Rag GTPases and leucine."
https://openalex.org/W2890124177,"Vascular endothelial growth factor-A (VEGF-A) is highly subjected to alternative pre-mRNA splicing that generates several splice variants. The VEGFxxx and VEGFxxxb families encode splice variants of VEGF-A that differ only at the level of six amino acids in their C-terminal part. The expression level of VEGFxxx splice variants and their function as pro-angiogenic factors during tumor neo-angiogenesis have been well-described. The role of VEGFxxxb isoforms is less well known, but they have been shown to inhibit VEGFxxx-mediated angiogenesis, while being partial or weak activators of VEGFR receptors in endothelial cells. On the opposite, their role on tumor cells expressing VEGFRs at their surface remains largely unknown. In this study, we find elevated levels of VEGF165b, the main VEGFxxxb isoform, in 36% of non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC), mainly lung adenocarcinoma (46%), and show that a high VEGF165b/VEGF165 ratio correlates with the presence of lymph node metastases. At the molecular level, we demonstrate that VEGF165b stimulates proliferation and invasiveness of two lung tumor cell lines through a VEGFR/β1 integrin loop. We further provide evidence that the isoform-specific knockdown of VEGF165b reduces tumor growth, demonstrating a tumor-promoting autocrine role for VEGF165b in lung cancer cells. Importantly, we show that bevacizumab, an anti-angiogenic compound used for the treatment of lung adenocarcinoma patients, increases the expression of VEGF165b and activates the invasive VEGFR/β1 integrin loop. Overall, these data highlight an unexpected role of the VEGF165b splice variant in the progression of lung tumors and their response to anti-angiogenic therapies."
https://openalex.org/W2891725196,"A growing body of evidence supports the role of platelets in cancer metastasis, escape from immune surveillance, and angiogenesis. Mean platelet volume (MPV), which reflects platelet turnover, is reported routinely as part of automated complete blood count. Accumulating evidence suggests that MPV is a useful biomarker in several diseases including cancer. However, its role in cancer patients receiving molecular targeted therapy has not been described in the literature.We retrospectively analysed the prognostic impact of MPV in advanced or recurrent EGFR mutant lung adenocarcinoma treated with EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR-TKIs). Lymphocyte-to-monocyte ratio (LMR) has been previously reported to be a poor prognostic factor in EGFR mutant non-small cell lung cancer and was also included as a covariate.Using the previously described Cutoff Finder algorithm, the cut-off points for MPV and LMR that best predicted progression free survival (PFS) of EGFR-TKI were determined as 10.3 and 2.8, respectively. The median PFS was 14.7 and 8.2 months in MPV low and high groups (p = 0.013, log-rank test). The median PFS was 13.5 and 6.2 months in LMR high and low groups (p < 0.001, log-rank test). MPV and LMR were independently distributed (chi square test) and the multivariate analysis using Cox's proportional hazards regression model revealed that high MPV, low LMR, and pleural effusion were significant predictors for shorter PFS.MPV and LMR, measured as part of routine complete blood count, can be utilized to predict the outcome of EGFR-TKI therapy with no additional costs. Our results suggest a mechanism of EGFR-TKI resistance which is associated with the functional status of the platelets."

In most cases, the d-residue is critical for the biological function of the resulting d-amino acid–containing peptide (DAACP). Here, we provide an example in native neuropeptides in which the DAACP and its all-l-amino acid epimer are both active at their newly identified receptor in vitro and at a neuronal target associated with feeding behavior. On the basis of sequence similarity to a known DAACP from cone snail venom, we hypothesized that allatotropin-related peptide (ATRP), a neuropeptide from the neuroscience model organism Aplysia californica, may form multiple diastereomers in the Aplysia central nervous system. We determined that ATRP exists as a d-amino acid–containing peptide (d2-ATRP) and identified a specific G protein–coupled receptor as an ATRP receptor. Interestingly, unlike many previously reported DAACPs and their all-l-residue analogs, both l-ATRP and d2-ATRP were potent agonists of this receptor and active in electrophysiological experiments. Finally, d2-ATRP was much more stable than its all-l-residue counterpart in Aplysia plasma, suggesting that in the case of ATRP, the primary role of the l- to d-residue isomerization may be to protect this peptide from aminopeptidase activity in the extracellular space. Our results indicate that l- to d-residue isomerization can occur even in an all-l-residue peptide with a known biological activity and that in some cases, this PTM may help modulate peptide signal lifetime in the extracellular space rather than activity at the cognate receptor. l- to d-residue isomerization is a post-translational modification (PTM) present in neuropeptides, peptide hormones, and peptide toxins from several animals.

https://openalex.org/W2890916441,"Functional gastrointestinal disorders (FGIDs) are characterized by dysregulated gut-brain interactions. Emerging evidence shows that low-grade mucosal inflammation and immune activation contribute to FGIDs, including functional dyspepsia (FD). Stress plays an important role in the onset of FD symptoms. In human subjects with FD, presence of gastric mast cells has been reported, but factors that influence mast cell infiltration remain uncharacterized. Corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) initiates the body's stress response and is known to degranulate mast cells. In this study, we delineated the role of the CRF system in the pathogenesis of FD in a rat model. Gastric irritation in neonate rat pups with iodoacetamide (IA) was used to induce FD-like symptoms. RNA interference (RNAi) was used to silence gastric CRF expression. Mast cell infiltrate in the stomach increased by 54% in IA-treated rats compared to controls and CRF-RNAi tended to decrease gastric mast cell infiltrate. Sucrose intake decreased in IA-treated rats and mast cell numbers showed a negative association with sucrose intake. IA treatment and transient silencing of gastric CRF increased hypothalamic CRF levels. In IA-treated rats, gastric levels of CRF receptor 2 (CRF2) decreased by ~76%, whereas hypothalamic CRF receptor 1 (CRF1) levels increased. Plasma levels of TNF-α showed a positive correlation with plasma CRF levels. Levels of phosphorylated p38 and ERK1/2 in the stomach showed a positive correlation with gastric CRF levels. Thus, CRF may contribute to low grade inflammation via modulating mast cell infiltration, cytokine levels, MAPK signaling, and the gut-brain axis."
https://openalex.org/W2891173585,"Introduction Migrants are one of the most deprived and vulnerable groups who receive the least health services in the society. Only a few studies have been conducted on access to healthcare among migrants in Asia, despite hosting 75 million migrants. In Japan, Nepalese migrants constitute the largest South Asian community. Their number increased by three folds from 2011 to 2016. However, little is known about their access to health care in Japan. Based on Andersen's model, we examined the factors associated with access to healthcare among Nepalese migrants in Japan. Methods We conducted a cross-sectional study among 642 Nepalese migrants residing in 10 prefectures of Japan. We used multivariable logistic regression model to explore the key predisposing, enabling, and need factors associated with access to healthcare among the migrants. Results The migrants who had stayed in Japan longer were more likely to perceive better access to a doctor/health worker (AOR = 1.11, 95% CI 1.03–1.19).The migrants were more likely to perceive better access to a doctor/health worker (AOR = 1.79, 95% CI 1.17–2.73) when they did not need Japanese language interpreter during visit to health facilities. They were also less likely not to see a doctor/health worker when needed (AOR = 0.34, 95% CI 0.21–0.56). The migrants were less likely to perceive better access to a doctor/health worker when they had not paid the health insurance premium regularly (AOR = 0.21, 95% CI 0.13–0.33).Their low perception of better access to a doctor/health worker was also associated with self-rated health status as poor or fair (AOR = 0.60, 95% CI 0.41–0.89). Conclusion Nepalese migrants have poor access to health care in Japan. The key factors associated with their access to health care are the length of stay (predisposing factor), Japanese language skill and health insurance (enabling factors) and self-rated health status (need factor)."
https://openalex.org/W2889602319,"Background An association between maternal prenatal stress and increased rates of respiratory tract infections in the offspring has been described earlier. Data regarding the father’s role is lacking. In this study our aim was to evaluate, whether mothers’ and fathers’ depressive symptoms and loneliness during pregnancy predict higher rates of respiratory tract infections in the offspring. Methods In this longitudinal cohort study we gathered information on parental psychological risk during gestational week 20 using the BDI-II and UCLA loneliness scale questionnaires for the parents of 929 children. Loneliness was divided into social and emotional components, the former describing patterns of social isolation and the latter a perceived lack of intimate attachments. Episodes of acute otitis media, physician visits due to respiratory tract infections, and antibiotic consumption relating to respiratory tract infections were documented in the infants, excluding twins, from birth until 10 months of age using study diaries. Analyses were carried out by structural equation modeling, which provides dynamic estimates of covariances. Results Maternal depressive symptoms during pregnancy predicted higher rates of acute otitis media in the infant and maternal emotional loneliness predicted higher rates of physician visits. Acute otitis media, physician visits and antibiotic consumption in the infant were slightly less frequent for families who reported social loneliness in the father or mother. Associations remained when taking into account confounders. Conclusions Maternal prenatal depression and emotional loneliness predicted a higher burden of respiratory tract infections in the offspring. The protective influence of parental social loneliness on the burden of respiratory tract infections in infants was not in line with our study hypothesis, but could be explained by reduced use of healthcare services in these socially isolated families."
https://openalex.org/W2892096005,"The effect of soil and water conservation measures (SWCMs) is usually dependent on time. Thus the trend in reducing runoff and sediment over time is a very important theoretical problem for evaluating the effectiveness of SWCMs. Moreover, there is still a lack of comprehensive assessment of water erosion dynamics following implementing SWCMs despite their ecological significance. Therefore, the long-term impact of SWCMs on runoff and sediment and their relationships was assessed for an orchard on sloping red soil in southern China. Overland flow and erosion sediment were continuously observed for 15 years on citrus experimental plots under one of four treatments: grass strips, strip intercropping, level terrace and clean-tillage. By means of Mann–Kendall trend tests and double cumulative curves, the time series of runoff and sediment under the different treatments were analyzed. Furthermore, we linked the effect of soil conservation and the relationship between runoff and sediment variation to determine the mechanism of conservation measures on sediment reduction. The results showed that the first 4 years was the key period to prevent soil erosion for this orchard, and then the intensity of soil erosion decreased below 500 t·km–2·a–1. Considering economic costs and ecological effect, grass strips were the best protective measure for this test situation. The fitted curves of the effect of SWCMs on sediment reduction over time showed an ‘L’ form, but on runoff there was an approximately horizontal line. The SWCMs did not change the rainfall–runoff relationship, but did change the runoff–sediment erosion relationship. The erosion reduction mechanism of SWCMs in the early phase was a joint function of reducing runoff and changing the runoff–sediment relationship, and in the post-stable phase it worked mainly by reducing runoff. The results provide the basis for rational allocation of SWCMs considering location and time."
https://openalex.org/W2892151560,"Recent evidence has revealed that heterotrimeric G-proteins can be activated by cytoplasmic proteins that share an evolutionarily conserved sequence called the Gα-binding-and-activating (GBA) motif. This mechanism provides an alternative to canonical activation by G-protein–coupled receptors (GPCRs) and plays important roles in cell function, and its dysregulation is linked to diseases such as cancer. Here, we describe a discovery pipeline that uses biochemical and genetic approaches to validate GBA candidates identified by sequence similarity. First, putative GBA motifs discovered in bioinformatics searches were synthesized on peptide arrays and probed in batch for Gαi3 binding. Then, cDNAs encoding proteins with Gαi3-binding sequences were expressed in a genetically-modified yeast strain that reports mammalian G-protein activity in the absence of GPCRs. The resulting GBA motif candidates were characterized by comparison of their biochemical, structural, and signaling properties with those of all previously described GBA motifs in mammals (GIV/Girdin, DAPLE, Calnuc, and NUCB2). We found that the phospholipase Cδ4 (PLCδ4) GBA motif binds G-proteins with high affinity, has guanine nucleotide exchange factor activity in vitro, and activates G-protein signaling in cells, as indicated by bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET)-based biosensors of G-protein activity. Interestingly, the PLCδ4 isoform b (PLCδ4b), which lacks the domains required for PLC activity, bound and activated G-proteins more efficiently than the full-length isoform a, suggesting that PLCδ4b functions as a G-protein regulator rather than as a PLC.

https://openalex.org/W2890901325,"ARGONAUTE1 (AGO1) binds directly to small regulatory RNA and is a key effector protein of post-transcriptional gene silencing mediated by microRNA (miRNA) and small interfering RNA (siRNA) in Arabidopsis. The formation of an RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) of AGO1 and small RNA requires the function of the heat shock protein 70/90 chaperone system. Some functions of AGO1 occur in association with endomembranes, in particular the rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER), but proteins interacting with AGO1 in membrane fractions remain unidentified. In this study, we show that the farnesylated heat shock protein 40 homologs, J2 and J3, associate with AGO1 in membrane fractions in a manner that involves protein farnesylation. We also show that three changes in AGO1 function are detectable in mutants in protein farnesylation and J2/J3. First, perturbations of the HSP40/70/90 pathway by mutation of J3, HSP90, and farnesyl transferase affect the amounts of AGO1 associated with membranes. Second, miRNA association with membrane-bound polysomes is increased in farnesyl transferase and farnesylation-deficient J2/J3 mutants. Third, silencing by noncell autonomously acting short interfering RNAs is impaired. These observations highlight the involvement of farnesylated J2/J3 in small RNA-mediated gene regulation, and suggest that the importance of chaperone-AGO1 interaction is not limited to the RISC assembly process."

Potential interaction between both settings in so-called meso-systems, as hypothesized by the ecological systems perspective, is however often ignored. Specifically, inconsistency between home and child-care is hypothesized to have negative effects on child outcomes.Participants were recruited through 23 child-care centers in the Netherlands. Data regarding 161 child-parent-child-care staff triads were available. Parenting and child care practices were assessed using validated questionnaires for parents (Child Feeding Practices Questionnaire, Preschooler Physical Activity Parenting Practices instrument) and child-care staff (Child-care Food and Activity Practices Questionnaire), using similar items in both settings. Absolute difference scores between parents and child-care staff were calculated for each triad as a measure of meso-system consistency. Child outcomes were physical activity (as assessed by accelerometry), dietary intake (from the parental questionnaire), and measured BMI z-scores. Paired t-tests were used to examine consistency between practices in both settings. Linear regression analyses were used to explore the association of parenting practices, child-care practices and difference scores on the one hand, and child outcomes on the other.Significant differences between settings were found for almost all practices, and in most cases child-care staff scores more favorable on the practices than parents. Inconsistencies were mostly associated with unhealthy dietary intake and lower physical activity levels, but not with BMI.The current study showed that inconsistencies in parenting and child-care practices exist, and that these inconsistencies seem to be associated with unhealthy behavior in children. The results underline the importance of studying meso-system influences on behavior in general, and children's energy balance-related behavior specifically."

Acute kidney injury (AKI) was a common complication in an SJS/TEN group and noted as an independent risk factor for mortality in patients with SJS/TEN. To determine whether AKI staging can predict the outcome of patients with SJS/TEN, we compared the discriminative power of an AKI KDIGO staging system with that of SCROTEN, APACHE II, APACHE III, and SOFA.We retrospectively analyzed the data of 75 patients who were diagnosed with SJS, TEN, or SJS/TEN overlap syndrome at a tertiary care university hospital between January 1, 2011 and December 31, 2014. The baseline characteristics, biochemical analysis data, medication use, and outcomes of the patients were assessed, and the discriminative ability for predicting mortality was determined for each prognostic model.Of the 75 patients, 23 (30.7%) had AKI, of whom 13 (56.5%) died during the index admission. Of the prognostic risk models analyzed, the KDIGO staging system showed similar discriminative ability in predicting in-hospital mortality as did the other models. In addition, combining KDIGO with other scoring systems yielded significantly more accurate risk prediction for in-hospital mortality compared with the other individual scores alone, as measured by net reclassification index. The patients with KDIGO stages 2 and 3 exhibited a significantly lower 1-year survival rate than did those with KDIGO stages 0 and 1.AKI KDIGO staging has good discriminative ability and is easy to utilize for predicting mortality."

In a multivariable Cox proportional hazard model adjusted for potential comorbidities, the incidence of stroke was lower among PD patients using CHM compared with non-CHM users (11.10 per 100 person-years vs 23.15 per 100 person-years; Hazard ratio: 0.56; 95% confidence interval: 0.44 to 0.72). The probability curve generated from our follow-up data showed that PD patients receiving CHM treatment had a decreased risk of stroke compared with those not receiving CHM treatment (P <0.001). The analysis on the prescription pattern of CHM revealed that Danshen is the most common single herb and Ma Zi Ren Wan is the most common herbal formula. Although the analysis are limited by a lack of analytic information regarding lifestyle patterns, biochemical profiles, and levels of PD severity in database, this population-based study suggest that CHM may be an complementary therapy to reduce the risk of stroke in PD patients."

We have previously shown that TSP4 interacts with Cavα2δ1 to promote excitatory synaptogenesis and the development of chronic pain states. However, the TSP4 determinants responsible for these changes are not known. Here, we tested the hypothesis that the Cavα2δ1-binding domains of TSP4 are synaptogenic and pronociceptive. We mapped the major Cavα2δ1-binding domains of TSP4 within the coiled-coil and epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like domains in vitro. Intrathecal injection of TSP4 fragment proteins containing the EGF-like domain (EGF-LIKE) into naïve rodents was sufficient for inducing behavioral hypersensitivity similar to that produced by an equal molar dose of full-length TSP4. Gabapentin, a drug that binds to Cavα2δ1, blocked EGF-LIKE–induced behavioral hypersensitivity in a dose-dependent manner, supporting the notion that EGF-LIKE interacts with Cavα2δ1 and thereby mediates behavioral hypersensitivity. This notion was further supported by our findings that a peptide within EGF-LIKE (EGFD355–369) could block TSP4- or Cavα2δ1-induced behavioral hypersensitivity after intrathecal injections. Furthermore, only TSP4 proteins that contained EGF-LIKE could promote excitatory synaptogenesis between sensory and spinal cord neurons, which could be blocked by peptide EGFD355–369. Together, these findings indicate that EGF-LIKE is the molecular determinant that mediates aberrant excitatory synaptogenesis and chronic pain development. Blocking interactions between EGF-LIKE and Cavα2δ1 could be an alternative approach in designing target-specific pain medications.

https://openalex.org/W2892090756,"This paper describes and presents a stable and reliable set of stereo-photogrammetric normative data for global and spino-pelvic sagittal alignment, as a proven reference system for evaluating/measuring a fully unconstrained natural upright neutral standing attitude in a young healthy adult population. The methodological features described in this article will enable future studies to replicate and/or directly compare a wide range of different postural tests and/or sagittal alignment assessment procedures including the study of sagittal spine shape variations occurring during gait performance. To date, the quantitative evaluation of adult spinal deformity (ASD) has been mainly confined to the X-ray imaging approach and, more recently, to 3D X-ray reconstruction. Within the existing evaluation framework an opportunity exists for an additional approach: a quantitative evaluation procedure which is easy, accurate, relatively speedy and non-ionising, in order to monitor and track the progress of patients in the areas of both surgical and non-surgical treatment. The resources and methodology described in this paper have been proven to meet all these criteria. They have enabled full 3D posture (including 3D spine shape and sagittal alignment of the skeleton) to be consistently and successfully measured in adult volunteers. All the measurement/evaluation procedures and outcomes carried out were based entirely on the new non-ionising 3D opto-electronic stereo-photogrammetric approach described in this article. The protocol for this methodology was based on a standard set of 27 pre-selected anatomical “landmarks” on the human body, providing standard reference points for observation and measurement. A total of 124 healthy subjects were successfully assessed and, for each subject, 27 individual markers were applied to the corresponding locations on his/her body. Statistical tests to investigate gender differences were also carried out. Descriptive statistics are provided for all 15 of the spino-pelvic parameters under consideration. Results indicated significant differences between genders in five sets of parameters: Kyphosis tilt, Head tilt, Pelvic tilt, Spino-pelvic angle and T1-pelvic angle. The data also demonstrate a high degree of congruity with results obtained using the X-ray method, as evidenced by the existing literature in the field. In summary, the current study presents a new stereo-photogrammetric opto-electronic technology which can be used successfully for ASD evaluation and introduces a comprehensive set of normative data analogous to those proposed in X-ray analysis for sagittal spino-pelvic and total body alignment."

The objective of this study is to clarify the role of S1P and its receptors (S1PRs), especially S1PR3 in airway epithelial cells.The effects of S1P on asthma-related genes expression were examined with the human bronchial epithelial cells BEAS-2B and Calu-3 using a transcriptome analysis and siRNA of S1PRs. To clarify the role of CCL20 in the airway inflammation, BALB/c mice were immunized with ovalbumin (OVA) and subsequently challenged with an OVA-containing aerosol to induce asthma with or without intraperitoneal administration of anti-CCL20. Finally, the anti-inflammatory effect of VPC 23019, S1PR1/3 antagonist, in the OVA-induced asthma was examined.S1P induced the expression of some asthma-related genes, such as ADRB2, PTGER4, and CCL20, in the bronchial epithelial cells. The knock-down of SIPR3 suppressed the expression of S1P-inducing CCL20. Anti-CCL20 antibody significantly attenuated the eosinophil numbers in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (P<0.01). Upon OVA challenge, VPC23019 exhibited substantially attenuated eosinophilic inflammation.S1P/S1PR3 pathways have a role in release of proinflammatory cytokines from bronchial epithelial cells. Our results suggest that S1P/S1PR3 may be a possible candidate for the treatment of bronchial asthma."
https://openalex.org/W2890668342,"The melting temperature (Tm) of a protein is the temperature at which half of the protein population is in a folded state. Therefore, Tm is a measure of the thermostability of a protein. Increasing the Tm of a protein is a critical goal in biotechnology and biomedicine. However, predicting the change in melting temperature (dTm) due to mutations at a single residue is difficult because it depends on an intricate balance of forces. Existing methods for predicting dTm have had similar levels of success using generally complex models. We find that training a machine learning model with a simple set of easy to calculate physicochemical descriptors describing the local environment of the mutation performed as well as more complicated machine learning models and is 2-6 orders of magnitude faster. Importantly, unlike in most previous publications, we perform a blind prospective test on our simple model by designing 96 variants of a protein not in the training set. Results from retrospective and prospective predictions reveal the limited applicability domain of each model. This study highlights the current deficiencies in the available dTm dataset and is a call to the community to systematically design a larger and more diverse experimental dataset of mutants to prospectively predict dTm with greater certainty."
https://openalex.org/W2889658957,"Rotaviruses are the primary cause of acute gastroenteritis in children worldwide. Although the implementation of live attenuated vaccines has reduced the number of rotavirus-associated deaths, variance in their effectiveness has been reported in different countries. This fact, among other concerns, leads to continuous efforts for the development of new generation of vaccines against rotavirus.In this work, we describe the obtention of cell wall-derived particles from a recombinant Lactococcus lactis expressing a cell wall-anchored version of the rotavirus VP6 protein. After confirming by SDS-PAGE, Western blot, flow cytometry and electronic immunomicroscopy that these particles were carrying the VP6 protein, their immunogenic potential was evaluated in adult BALB/c mice. For that, mucosal immunizations (oral or intranasal), with or without the dmLT [(double mutant Escherichia coli heat labile toxin LT(R192G/L211A)] adjuvant were performed. The results showed that these cell wall-derived particles were able to generate anti-rotavirus IgG and IgA antibodies only when administered intranasally, whether the adjuvant was present or not. However, the presence of dmLT was necessary to confer protection against rotavirus infection, which was evidenced by a 79.5 percent viral shedding reduction.In summary, this work describes the production of cell wall-derived particles which were able to induce a protective immune response after intranasal immunization. Further studies are needed to characterize the immune response elicited by these particles as well as to determine their potential as an alternative to the use of live L. lactis for mucosal antigen delivery."
https://openalex.org/W2889777439,"The aim of the present study was to assess the regional deprivation and individual factors that influence how far a person will travel to access dental care. Using data from the Korea Health Panel (2008 to 2011), we selected a group of 4,256 subjects and geocoded their homes and dental hospitals/clinics. Using the road network analysis, we calculated the distance traveled by the subjects for dental care. We used the generalized estimating equation (GEE) for repeated data analysis and included an interaction term between regional deprivation and individual income to determine the effects of the two factors on the choice of a dental hospital/clinic. When the regional deprivation index was divided into three quarters (high, middle, and low), urban areas had higher""high"" and ""low"" levels of deprivation, and rural areas had relatively higher middle level of deprivation. GEE regression showed that the level of education, regional deprivation level, and income all affected the distance traveled to dental clinics. The regional deprivation level had a higher association than income with the travel distance. At the same income level, subjects who lived in the least deprived areas were more likely to travel longer distances than subjects living in the most deprived areas. Regarding the distribution of dental hospitals/clinics, incentive based dental polices for either dental providers or patients are needed that will assure the delivery of dental care despite spatial inequality."
https://openalex.org/W2889868480,"Background Tipping the balance toward regulatory T cells (Tregs) through adoptive cell therapy has shown promise to induce transplantation tolerance. Although such strategy has been explored in many mice organ transplantation studies, less knowledge was available in rat systems. Furthermore, the behaviors of the transferred cells have not been well studied in real-time fashion. Methods Tregs from naïve LEW rats were purified in two steps with the autoMACS system. Immunosuppression potential of these cells was examined with mixed lymphocyte reaction. Following stimulation by the alloantigen in vitro, the purified Tregs were infused into the recipients of vascularized composite allotransplantation (VCA). Secondary allogeneic skin grafting challenge was performed on the recipients with long-term survived VCA. Live optical imaging was performed to track luciferase-expressing Tregs following infusion to the VCA recipients. Expression of relevant molecules was studied by flow cytometry or quantitative RT-PCR. Results Rat Tregs were enriched following two-step cell sorting and showed immunosuppressive capacity. Upon infusion into the VCA recipients that have been treated with antilymphocyte serum and short-term Cyclosporin A, the antigen-stimulated Tregs significantly prolonged VCA survival and induced donor-specific tolerance. Tracking of the infused bioluminescent Tregs showed their specific homing to lymph nodes, and then to the VCAs. Following secondary skin grafting, Tregs specifically gathered at the donor-derived skin that was not rejected by the recipient. The in vivo migratory pattern coincided with the altered expression of cell surface molecules of CD62L, CD103, CD134, and CD278, following donor-antigen stimulation. Elevated expression of CCR4 and CCL22 in allograft may also participate in recruiting Tregs for maintenance of VCA survival and promoting donor-specific tolerance. Conclusion Sorted Tregs induced donor-specific tolerance to VCA in rats. Live cell tracking demonstrated that activated CD4+CD25+FoxP3+ Tregs targeted primarily to the lymph nodes and VCA. The Tregs migrated to the secondary grafted donor skin and contributed to the maintenance of donor-specific tolerance. These behaviors were associated with phenotypic changes induced by donor antigen stimulation. Increased expression of CCR4 and CCL22 in VCA skin may also be relevant."
https://openalex.org/W2889655394,"An elaborate system of ducts collects urine from all nephrons, and this structure is known as the urinary collecting system (UCS). This study focused on how the UCS is formed during human embryogenesis. Fifty human embryos between the Carnegie stage (CS) 14 and CS23 were selected from the Kyoto Collection at the Congenital Anomaly Research Center of Kyoto University, Japan. Metanephroses, including the UCS, were segmented on serial digital virtual histological sections. Three-dimensional images were computationally reconstructed for morphological and quantitative analyses. A CS timeline was plotted. It consisted of the 3-D structural morphogenesis of UCS and quantification of the total amount of end-branching, average and maximum numbers of generations, deviation in the metanephros, differentiation of the urothelial epithelium in the renal pelvis, and timing of the rapid expansion of the renal pelvis. The first UCS branching generation occurred by CS16. The average branching generation reached a maximum of 8.74 ± 1.60 and was already the twelfth in CS23. The total end-branching number squared between the start and the end of the embryonic period. UCS would reach the fifteenth branching generation soon after CS23. The number of nephrons per UCS end-branch was low (0.21 ± 0.14 at CS19, 1.34 ± 0.49 at CS23), indicating that the bifid branching occurred rapidly and that the formation of nephrons followed after. The renal pelvis expanded mainly in CS23, which was earlier than that reported in a previous study. The number of nephrons connected to the UCS in the expanded group (246.0 ± 13.2) was significantly larger than that of the pre-expanded group (130.8 ± 80.1) (P < 0.05). The urothelial epithelium differentiated from the zeroth to the third generations at CS23. Differentiation may have continued up until the tenth generation to allow for renal pelvis expansion. The branching speed was not uniform. There were significantly more branching generations in the polar- than in the interpolar regions (P < 0.05). Branching speed reflects the growth orientation required to form the metanephros. Further study will be necessary to understand the renal pelvis expansion mechanism in CS23. Our CS-based timeline enabled us to map UCS formation and predict functional renal capacity after differentiation and growth."

https://openalex.org/W2890593736,"Introduction Childhood mortality remains a pressing problem in rural Kenya, and reducing under-five deaths is a key target of the Sustainable Development Goals. We aim to describe the reduction in under-five mortality in a rural Kenyan community served by the Lwala Community Alliance and factors associated with under-five mortality in this community. Methods A cross-sectional survey containing a complete birth history was administered to a representative sample of the catchment area of the Lwala Community Alliance. Survival analysis techniques were used to describe temporal trends and risk factors related to under-five mortality. Results 1,362 children were included in the study, and 91 children died before the fifth birthday. The most common causes of death among children under five were malaria (19%), respiratory infection (13%), and anemia (11%). The under-five mortality rate was 104.8 per 1,000 live births from 1999 to 2006 and 53.0 per 1,000 after the founding of the Lwala Community Alliance in 2007. Factors associated with under-five mortality included year of birth (HR 0.931; 95% CI: 0.877, 0.988; p = 0.019), multiple-gestation pregnancy (HR 6.201; 95% CI: 2.073, 18.555; p < 0.001), and birth in the long rain season (HR 1.981; 95% CI: 1.350, 2.907; p < 0.001). Birth spacing greater than 18 months was negatively associated with under-five mortality (HR 0.345; 95% CI: 0.203, 0.587; p < 0.001). Conclusions There was a significant decrease in under-five mortality before and after the presence of the Lwala Community Alliance. Multiple-gestation pregnancies, birth season, and short birth spacing were associated with under-five mortality and provide possible targets to further reduce mortality in the region. This provides both hyper-local data necessary for implementation efforts and generalizable data and sampling methods that may be useful for other implementing organizations in sub-Saharan Africa."

The gene cluster for biosynthesis of fumisoquins, secondary metabolites structurally related to isoquinolines, in the filamentous fungus Aspergillus fumigatus harbors a gene that encodes a flavoprotein of the amine oxidase family, termed fsqB (fumisoquin biosynthesis gene B). This enzyme catalyzes an oxidative ring closure reaction that leads to the formation of isoquinoline products. This reaction is reminiscent of the oxidative cyclization reported for berberine bridge enzyme and tetrahydrocannabinol synthase. Despite these similarities, amine oxidases and berberine bridge enzyme–like enzymes possess distinct structural properties, prompting us to investigate the structure–function relationships of FsqB. Here, we report the recombinant production and purification of FsqB, elucidation of its crystal structure, and kinetic analysis employing five putative substrates. The crystal structure at 2.6 Å resolution revealed that FsqB is a member of the amine oxidase family with a covalently bound FAD cofactor. N-methyl-dopa was the best substrate for FsqB and was completely converted to the cyclic isoquinoline product. The absence of the meta-hydroxyl group, as e.g. in l-N-methyl-tyrosine, resulted in a 25-fold lower rate of reduction and the formation of the demethylated product l-tyrosine, instead of a cyclic product. Surprisingly, FsqB did not accept the d-stereoisomer of N-methyltyrosine, in contrast to N-methyl-dopa, for which both stereoisomers were oxidized with similar rates. On the basis of the crystal structure and docking calculations, we postulate a substrate-dependent population of distinct binding modes that rationalizes stereospecific oxidation in the FsqB active site.

A secondary analysis of data from two cross-sectional studies of primary home caregivers (N = 400; probabilistic sample) of older adult relatives in Spain was conducted. Data regarding obligation (four categories basing on beliefs of obligation and social pressure: low pressure and low beliefs, low pressure and high beliefs, high pressure and low beliefs and high pressure and high beliefs), stressors, anxiety and depression were collected by interview in 2013. The combination of high pressure and low beliefs had the highest levels of anxiety and depression, and the combination of low pressure and high beliefs had the lowest levels of anxiety and depression. When the relation of behavioural problems with anxiety and depression stratified by the previous four categories of obligation was analysed, behavioural problems were associated with anxiety and depression in the subgroups with low beliefs of obligation, whereas this association disappeared in the subgroups with high beliefs of obligation."

However, in Japan, a TB middle-burden country, systematic screening for LTBI in correctional facilities is currently not conducted. As part of a larger study to determine the cost-effectiveness of LTBI screening in correctional facilities in Japan, this study was conducted to determine the situation of LTBI, including treatment outcome, among the incarcerated population in Japan, and provide the essential data for cost-effectiveness analysis.A cross-sectional study was conducted between 2017 and 2018 with public health centers which have one or more correctional facilities under their jurisdiction. Questionnaire surveys were sent to collect information on their policy of managing LTBI patients notified from correctional facilities, including whether or not there was a standardized procedure for initiating LTBI treatment, and also to collect sociodemographic information and treatment outcome of LTBI patients who were notified from the respective correctional facilities in 2015 and 2016.The survey was sent to a total of 163 public health centers, out of which 133 (81.6%) responded. 8 of the 133 public health centers actively guided the correctional facilities regarding LTBI treatment initiation through a standardized procedure, while 115 either had not established such procedure or were unaware of how LTBI treatment was being initiated in the correctional facilities. A total of 91 LTBI patients were notified from the correctional facilities in 2015 and 2016, and the information of 89 were available for analysis. 82 were males, and 83 were Japan-born. Treatment outcome was known for 88 patients, of which 70 had completed treatment. Of the 18 who did not complete the treatment, 15 had been lost to follow-up upon release from the facilities. Among those who had been released whilst on treatment, the proportion of those who completed the treatment was higher in those patients who received pre-release visit by a public health nurse, than those who did not.LTBI treatment was often being initiated without consideration for the patients' prison term. The treatment completion rate within jail was high, indicating the possibility that incarcerated population can benefit for LTBI treatment. On the other hand, the completion rate decreased significantly among those who had been released while still on treatment. In order to optimize the benefit, initiation of LTBI must carefully be considered upon the patient's prison term, as well as coordination among the relevant organizations to ensure continuity of care after release."
https://openalex.org/W2891277717,"Several health interventions have been put in place to improve health outcomes of people living with HIV/AIDS (PLHIV) in Ghana. We evaluated the impact of Antiretroviral Therapy (ART) on all-cause mortality in Ghana using matching procedures. This was a retrospective cohort study of 12,881 HIV/AIDS patients initiated on ART at 40 sentinel sites and 199 treatment centers between 2013 and 2016 countrywide. Patients were included if they had date of ART initiation and if they had mortality outcome recorded. Mahalanobis distant metric matching within propensity score caliper and other matching procedures were used to evaluate the effectiveness of ART in reducing the risk of all-cause mortality among PLHIV in Ghana. We performed sensitivity analysis using different matching procedures including Kernel weighting adjustment and Mahalanobis distance metric matching with nearest neighbour to ascertain the robustness of our results in the presence of unmeasured covariates. The proportion of patients on ART was 60.3% (95% CI: 59.5–61.1). The total number of mortalities reported was only 734 representing 4.6% (95% CI: 4.2–4.9) of the studied population. The risk of all-cause mortality has reduced by 11.6 percentage point among HIV/AIDS patients who were on ART compared to those who were not on ART (95% CI: 9.6–13.4). ART was associated with a decreased risk of all-cause mortality. Effort being made by Government and non-Governmental organizations in support of ART treatment in Ghana should continue unabated to help reduce mortality rate and improve health outcomes among HIV/AIDS. To reduce bias to the barest minimum between treatment and intervention group when evaluating the effectiveness of health interventions, it is recommended to use matching procedures especially when the study design is not a randomized control trial."

To improve the quality of healthcare, we aim to evaluate the association of clinical and demographic characteristics of patients and further to identify the determining factors for prescribing antibiotics to children experiencing enterovirus infection.We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of children who were hospitalized between January 2008 and December 2016 with a diagnosis of herpangina or hand-foot-mouth disease (HFMD). We identified those children who were prescribed antibiotics for at least 24 hours during admission. We conducted a retrospective descriptive study to analyze data in order to determine the factors associated with pediatrician antibiotics prescribing for enterovirus infection.In the nine years of study period, the rate of antibiotics use was about 13% in these patients. A total of 3659 patients were enrolled during 2008~2012 and analyzed in detail. Elevated levels of C-reactive protein (CRP) and presence of leukocytosis in blood (WBC) were both significantly associated with pediatrician antibiotic prescribing for enterovirus infection (p<0.001). Between different specialistic devisions, there was significantly different proportion of antibiotics utilization for patients. In further analysis of antibiotics prescribing by Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve method, the level of CRP significantly had more the area under curve (0.708) compared with the count of WBC (p<0.05).The present study indicates that higher serum level of CRP is strongly associated with pediatricians prescribing antibiotics for children experiencing herpangina or HFMD. Antibiotic prescribing is a complex process. Pediatricians should be more judicious in decision-making time by their specialistics. Our findings would shed new light on process and allay the concern about inappropriate antibiotics."
https://openalex.org/W2892127873,"Hepatitis D virus (HDV), which requires the presence of hepatitis B virus (HBV), is a deadly yet neglected disease that rapidly leads to liver cancer and disease-induced mortality. This co-dependence creates complex transmission dynamics that make it difficult to predict the efficacy of interventions aimed at HBV and/or HDV control in endemic regions, such as certain municipalities of Brazil, where up to 65% of HBV-infected persons are co-infected.We created a mathematical model that captures the joint transmission dynamics of HBV and HDV, incorporating mother-to-child, sexual and household transmission. With an aim to minimize the number of total infections and disease-induced mortality in 2027, we then determined optimal strategies for Brazil and its sub-regions under a constrained budget, which was dynamically allocated among HBV and HDV screening, HBV and HDV treatment, HBV newborn and adult vaccination, and awareness programs. Three treatment options were considered, namely: Tenofovir, PEGylated-Interferon, and nucleic acid polymers (NAP).The additional cost of HDV screening and the use of a more expensive PEGylated-Interferon are offset by not wasting resources on treating co-infected persons with Tenofovir. The introductory price of NAP treatment must be less than $16,000 per course to become competitive with Tenofovir and PEGylated-Interferon in Brazil.Additional screening for HDV is beneficial, even in a low HBV and HDV endemic regions of Brazil. We recommend PEGylated-Interferon, wherever possible, for both HBV and HDV. If PEGylated-Interferon is not available in abundance, PEGylated-Interferon for co-infections and 4-year Tenofovir treatment for mono-infections is recommended."

We find that the women experiencing upward intergenerational educational mobility (vis-a-vis their mothers) have significantly higher chances of experiencing good overall health compared to the women who are having same or lesser level of education as that of their mothers. Besides, women suffering from short term or major morbidity have remarkably lower chances of having overall good health. Also, women from rural India have significantly lesser chances of having overall good health as compared to that of urban areas. Further, Muslim women have lesser chances of having overall good health as that of women from other religious categories. Moreover, there is a significant variation in the overall health of women as we move from the eastern region to the western region of India."
