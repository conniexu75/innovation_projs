https://openalex.org/W2001753204,"A single intravascular injection of a cyclic peptide or monoclonal antibody antagonist of integrin alpha v beta 3 disrupts ongoing angiogenesis on the chick chorioallantoic membrane (CAM). This leads to the rapid regression of histologically distinct human tumors transplanted onto the CAM. Induction of angiogenesis by a tumor or cytokine promotes vascular cell entry into the cell cycle and expression of integrin alpha v beta 3. After angiogenesis is initiated, antagonists of this integrin induce apoptosis of the proliferative angiogenic vascular cells, leaving preexisting quiescent blood vessels unaffected. We demonstrate therefore that ligation of integrin alpha v beta 3 is required for the survival and maturation of newly forming blood vessels, an event essential for the proliferation of tumors."
https://openalex.org/W1974326501,"In the mammalian olfactory system, information from approximately 1000 different odorant receptor types is organized in the nose into four spatial zones. Each zone is a mosaic of randomly distributed neurons expressing different receptor types. In these studies, we have obtained evidence that information highly distributed in the nose is transformed in the olfactory bulb of the brain into a highly organized spatial map. We find that specific odorant receptor gene probes hybridize in situ to small, and distinct, subsets of olfactory bulb glomeruli. The spatial and numerical characteristics of the patterns of hybridization that we observe with different receptor probes indicate that, in the olfactory bulb, olfactory information undergoes a remarkable organization into a fine, and perhaps stereotyped, spatial map. In our view, this map is in essence an epitope map, whose approximately 1000 distinct components are used in a multitude of different combinations to discriminate a vast array of different odors."
https://openalex.org/W1982630660,"Motor neurons located at different positions in the embryonic spinal cord innervate distinct targets in the periphery, establishing a topographic neural map. The topographic organization of motor projections depends on the generation of subclasses of motor neurons that select specific paths to their targets. We have cloned a family of LIM homeobox genes in chick and show here that the combinatorial expression of four of these genes, Islet-1, Islet-2, Lim-1, and Lim-3, defines subclasses of motor neurons that segregate into columns in the spinal cord and select distinct axonal pathways. These genes are expressed prior to the formation of distinct motor axon pathways and before motor columns appear. Our results suggest that LIM homeobox genes contribute to the generation of motor neuron diversity and may confer subclasses of motor neurons with the ability to select specific axon pathways, thereby initiating the topographic organization of motor projections."

https://openalex.org/W2033702973,"Heparin is required for fibroblast growth factor (FGF) stimulation of biological responses. Using isothermal titration calorimetry, we show that acidic FGF (aFGF) forms a 1:1 complex with the soluble extracellular domain of FGF receptor (FGFR). Heparin exerts its effect by binding to many molecules of aFGF. The resulting aFGF-heparin complex can bind to several receptor molecules, leading to FGFR dimerization. In two cell lines lacking endogenous heparan sulfate, exogenous heparin is required for FGFR dimerization, tyrosine kinase activation, c-fos mRNA transcription, and cell proliferation. Moreover, a synthetic heparin analog that binds monovalently to aFGF blocks FGFR dimerization, activation, and signaling via FGFR. We propose that heparin causes oligomerization of aFGF such that its binding to FGFR results in dimerization and activation. This represents a novel mechanism for transmembrane signaling and may account for the action of many heparin-bound growth factors."
https://openalex.org/W2078023075,"To further elucidate the mechanism of organelle transport, we cloned a novel member of the mouse kinesin superfamily, KIF1B. This N-terminal-type motor protein is expressed ubiquitously in various kinds of tissues. In situ hybridization revealed that KIF1B is expressed abundantly in differentiated nerve cells. Interestingly, KIF1B works as a monomer, having a microtubule plus end-directed motility. Our rotary shadowing electron microscopy revealed mostly single globular structures. Immunocytochemically, KIF1B was colocalized with mitochondria in vivo. Furthermore, a subcellular fractionation study showed that KIF1B was concentrated in the mitochondrial fraction, and purified KIF1B could transport mitochondria along microtubules in vitro. These data strongly suggested that KIF1B works as a monomeric motor for anterograde transport of mitochondria."
https://openalex.org/W1992182952,"Circadian rhythms of mammals are timed by an endogenous clock with a period of about 24 hours located in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) of the hypothalamus. Light synchronizes this clock to the external environment by daily adjustments in the phase of the circadian oscillation. The mechanism has been thought to involve the release of excitatory amino acids from retinal afferents to the SCN. Brief treatment of rat SCN in vitro with glutamate (Glu), N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA), or nitric oxide (NO) generators produced lightlike phase shifts of circadian rhythms. The SCN exhibited calcium-dependent nitric oxide synthase (NOS) activity. Antagonists of NMDA or NOS pathways blocked Glu effects in vitro, and intracerebroventricular injection of a NOS inhibitor in vivo blocked the light-induced resetting of behavioral rhythms. Together, these data indicate that Glu release, NMDA receptor activation, NOS stimulation, and NO production link light activation of the retina to cellular changes within the SCN mediating the phase resetting of the biological clock."
https://openalex.org/W2045965305,"A survey of defined species of cell surface and extracellular matrix heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPG) was performed in a search for cellular proteoglycans that can promote bFGF receptor binding and biological activity. Of the various affinity-purified HSPGs tested, perlecan, the large basement membrane HSPG, is found to induce high affinity binding of bFGF both to cells deficient in HS and to soluble FGF receptors. Heparin-dependent mitogenic activity of bFGF is strongly augmented by perlecan. Monoclonal antibodies to perlecan extract the receptor binding promoting activity from active HSPG preparations. In a rabbit ear model for in vivo angiogenesis, perlecan is a potent inducer of bFGF-mediated neovascularization. These results identify perlecan as a major candidate for a bFGF low affinity, accessory receptor and an angiogenic modulator."
https://openalex.org/W1997859241,"Src homology 2 (SH2) domains bind specifically to tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins that participate in signaling by growth factors and oncogenes. A protein domain was identified that bound specifically to the tyrosine-phosphorylated form of its target protein but differs from known SH2 sequences. Phosphotyrosine-binding (PTB) domains were found in two proteins: SHC, a protein implicated in signaling through Ras; and SCK, encoded by a previously uncharacterized gene. The PTB domain of SHC specifically bound to a tyrosine-phosphorylated 145-kilodalton protein. PTB domains are an alternative to SH2 domains for specifically recruiting tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins into signaling complexes and are likely to take part in signaling by many growth factors."
https://openalex.org/W1966971174,"Nitric oxide (NO) produced by murine macrophages is important in murine resistance to ectromelia virus, herpes simplex virus, and vaccinia virus infection. In contrast, NO production by human mononuclear cells has been difficult to demonstrate, and a role for NO in human responses to infection is uncertain. We report constitutive, low level, macrophage-type NO synthase (iNOS) expression in Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-transformed human B lymphocytes and Burkitt's lymphoma cell lines. Immune NOS activity is involved in maintaining EBV latency through down-regulation of the expression of the immediate-early EBV transactivator Zta. NO also inhibits apoptosis in B lymphocyte cell lines. The effects of NO are largely independent of cGMP and influential on signaling pathways regulated by (sulfhydryl) redox status. These results suggest that NO plays a physiological role in human B cell biology by inhibiting programmed cell death and maintaining viral latency."
https://openalex.org/W2056750443,"Dmc1 and Rad51, yeast homologs of the E. coli RecA protein, are shown by immunostaining to localize to as many as 64 sites within spread meiotic nuclei. Genetic requirements for this punctate pattern suggest it represents recombination intermediates. Dmc1 and Rad51 colocalize and are therefore likely to act together during recombination. Despite their similarities, the two proteins have specialized functions: Dmc1 complexes do not form in rad51 mutants, while Rad51 complexes are retained indefinitely in dmc1 mutants. Dmc1 and, by inference, Rad51 form complexes before synapsis as monitored by immunostaining for Zip1 protein. Analysis of zip1 mutants shows that Zip1 promotes dissociation of Dmc1 complexes. Colocalization of Dmc1 and Zip1 raises the possibility that Dmc1 and Rad51 are components of recombination nodules."
https://openalex.org/W2016519406,"Insulin stimulation was found to promote association of the αvβ3 integrin (a vitronectin receptor) with insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1), an intracellular protein that mediates insulin signaling by binding other signaling molecules, including growth factor receptor-bound protein 2 (Grb2) and phosphatidylinositol-3′ kinase. Insulin-treated cells expressing the αvβ3 integrin showed 2.5 times more DNA synthesis when plated on vitronectin than on other substrates, whereas cells expressing another vitronectin receptor, αvβ5, did not show this difference. The association between integrin and IRS-1 may be a mechanism for the synergistic action of growth factor and extracellular matrix receptors."
https://openalex.org/W1551629532,"Fibroblasts or their conditioned medium stimulated invasion by squamous cell carcinoma cells. The fibroblast-derived activity responsible for increased invasion is the hepatocyte growth factor/scatter factor (HGF/SF), a ligand for the c-Met receptor. HGF/SF stimulated migration of the cells on various extracellular matrix substrates but did not alter their adhesion efficiency nor integrin expression. HGF/SF stimulated motility in a two step process: initially cells spread rapidly and formed focal adhesions, and then they disassembled these condensations, which was followed by increased cell locomotion. The focal adhesions contained vinculin, p125FAK, beta 1 integrin, and phosphotyrosine. Within minutes after exposure of cells to HGF/SF, proteins of 125 and 145 kDa showed elevated tyrosine phosphorylation and were identified as p125FAK and c-Met, respectively. Gradual loss of tyrosine phosphorylation coincided with disruption of focal adhesions and conversion to a motile phenotype. HGF/SF-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation of p125FAK was inhibited by the tyrosine kinase inhibitor, herbimycin A, which also blocked spreading and the migratory response. These results indicate that fibroblast-derived HGF/SF triggers migration through the initial recruiting of integrins, cytoskeletal proteins, and p125FAK into focal adhesions that is dependent on tyrosine kinase activity."
https://openalex.org/W1996621338,"Cystic fibrosis (CF) is caused by mutations in the gene encoding the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR). A potential animal model of CF, the CFTR-/- mouse, has had limited utility because most mice die from intestinal obstruction during the first month of life. Human CFTR (hCFTR) was expressed in CFTR-/- mice under the control of the rat intestinal fatty acid-binding protein gene promoter. The mice survived and showed functional correction of ileal goblet cell and crypt cell hyperplasia and cyclic adenosine monophosphate-stimulated chloride secretion. These results support the concept that transfer of the hCFTR gene may be a useful strategy for correcting physiologic defects in patients with CF."
https://openalex.org/W2087220149,"In many mammalian species, the placenta is the site of synthesis of proteins in the prolactin and growth hormone family. Analysis of two such proteins, proliferin (PLF) and proliferin-related protein (PRP), revealed that they are potent regulators of angiogenesis; PLF stimulated and PRP inhibited endothelial cell migration in cell culture and neovascularization in vivo. The mouse placenta secretes an angiogenic activity during the middle of pregnancy that corresponds primarily to PLF, but later in gestation releases a factor that inhibits angiogenesis, which was identified as PRP. Incubation of placental tissue with PLF led to the specific binding of this hormone to capillary endothelial cells. Thus PLF and PRP may regulate the initiation and then the cessation of placental neovascularization."

https://openalex.org/W1606441705,"Recent studies on cytokine and growth factor stimulated signal transduction have defined a direct pathway (Stat91) linking cell surface receptors to target genes in the nucleus. The Stat91 pathway regulated c-fos gene transcription involves activation by tyrosine phosphorylation of the DNA binding factor SIF (sis-inducing factor) in the cytoplasm, its nuclear translocation, and interaction with the regulatory element SIE (sis-inducing element). SIF is a complex of proteins containing members of the STAT family of transcription factors. We determined whether angiotensin II (AII), which acts as a growth factor in many cell types, could activate the Stat91 pathway. We used neonatal rat cardiac fibroblasts expressing G-protein linked AII receptors and CHO-K1 cells expressing stably transfected angiotensin type 1A (AT1A) receptors to address this question. Angiotensin II induced SIF-like activity in both cell types, with initial induction at 15-30 min, maximal around 2-3 h, and undetectable at 6 h. Cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions from cells exposed to AII contained DNA binding activity to SIE. The SIF activity was insensitive to protein synthesis inhibitors and sensitive to the tyrosine kinase inhibitor genistein. Stat91 or a related protein was identified as a component of the AII-induced SIF complex and increased levels of this tyrosine-phosphorylated protein were found in nuclear extracts of cells treated with AII. This is the first evidence that a seven transmembrane, G-protein-coupled receptor, namely AT1A, activates the Stat91-nuclear signaling pathway."
https://openalex.org/W1553180231,"Activated pp60c-src has been implicated in a number of human malignancies including colon carcinoma and breast adenocarcinoma. Association of the src SH2 domain with tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins plays a role in src-mediated signal transduction. Inhibitors of src SH2 domain-phosphoprotein interactions are, thus, of great interest in defining the role(s) of src in signal transduction pathways. To facilitate such studies, an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was developed to detect inhibitors of src SH2-phosphoprotein interactions. This assay measures inhibition of binding of a fusion construct (glutathione S-transferase src SH3-SH2) with autophosphorylated epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase domain. Activities of phosphopeptide segments derived from potential src SH2 cognate phosphoprotein partners were determined, with the focal adhesion kinase-derived segment VSETDDY*AEIIDE yielding the highest inhibitory activity. Structure activity studies starting from acetyl (Ac)-Y*EEIE have identified Ac-Y*Y*Y*IE as the most active compound screened in the ELISA. This compound is at least 20-fold more active than the parent peptide Ac-Y*EEIE. A high resolution (2 A) crystal structure of human src SH2 complexed with Ac-Y*EEIE was obtained and provided a useful framework for understanding the structure-activity relationships. Additionally, Ac-Y*EEIE was able to block interactions between src and its cellular phosphoprotein partners in vanadate-treated cell lysates from MDA-MB-468 breast carcinoma cells. However, it is unable to abrogate proliferation of MDA-MB-468 cells in culture, presumably because of poor cell penetration and/or lability of the phosphate group on tyrosine."
https://openalex.org/W1519692040,"The receptor tyrosine kinase Kit and Kit ligand (KL), encoded at the murine white spotting (W) and steel (Sl) loci, respectively, function in hematopoiesis, melanogenesis, and gametogenesis. To understand the mechanism of turnover of Kit in mast cells, mutant receptors generated in vitro were heterologously expressed in Wsb/Wsh mast cells lacking endogenous c-kit expression, and the effects of mutations on KL-induced internalization and ubiquitination/degradation of Kit were studied. Upon binding of KL, KL.Kit receptor complexes were rapidly internalized, and the turnover was accelerated by ubiquitin-mediated degradation. Inactivation of the Kit kinase resulted in a reduced rate of internalization of KL.Kit complexes, degradation of kinase-inactive receptor complexes was relatively slow, and receptor ubiquitination was absent. But abolishment of KL-induced receptor association and activation of phosphatidylinositol 3'-kinase and of tyrosine 821 autophosphorylation did not affect KL-induced internalization and ubiquitination/degradation of Kit. Furthermore, Kit receptors can be down-regulated by proteolytic cleavage induced by either activation of protein kinase C or by isopropyl alcohol. In summary, KL-induced internalization of KL.Kit complexes and ubiquitination/degradation require an active kinase. By contrast, proteolytic cleavage of Kit mediated by protein kinase C activation is independent of kinase activity."
https://openalex.org/W1573949141,"The yeast TOR1 and TOR2 proteins were previously discovered as putative targets of the immunosuppressive drug rapamycin. Although their cellular function is unknown, they are predicted to be at least 215 kDa in size and possess a C-terminal phosphatidylinositol (PI) kinase-related domain. We previously identified a conserved Ser residue, within the PI kinase-related domain of both yeast TOR proteins (Ser1972 in TOR1; Ser1975 in TOR2), as being the site of missense mutations conferring dominant rapamycin resistance. The Ser1972/1975 residue of yeast TOR is conserved in mammalian TOR homologs. One possibility is that this residue is critical for a direct interaction between TOR and the FKBP12-rapamycin complex. There is very recent biochemical evidence for an interaction between mammalian TOR and FKBP12-rapamycin (Brown, E. J., Albers, M. W., Shin, T. B., Ichikawa, K., Keith, C. T., Lane, W. S., and Schreiber, S. L. (1994) Nature 369, 756-758; Sabatini, D. M., Erdjument-Bromage, H., Lui, M., Tempst, P., and Snyder, S. H. (1994) Cell 78, 35-43). Using the yeast two-hybrid system, we now have obtained genetic proof of a physical interaction between FKBP12-rapamycin and TOR and have demonstrated that this interaction requires the conserved Ser residue. We have found that a small fragment of wild-type yeast TOR2 spanning Ser1975 is capable of interacting with human FKBP12 in the presence of rapamycin, whereas an Arg1975 mutant fails to interact. This effect is dependent upon rapamycin and is antagonized by FK506."

https://openalex.org/W1536486871,"In the renal medulla during antidiuresis, the extracellular fluid becomes hyperosmotic. Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) epithelial cells adapt in hyperosmotic conditions and serve as a useful tissue culture model for cellular responses to hyperosmolality. We demonstrate that hyperosmolality stimulates phospholipase C, Raf-1 kinase mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase kinase, MAP kinase, and S6 kinase activities and that it increases phosphorylation of Raf-1 kinase, and p42 MAP kinase in MDCK cells. Stimulation of these kinases is osmolality-dependent (from 300 to 600 mosm/kg H2O). The time course of activation is sequential; the peak stimulation for Raf-1 kinase is at 5 min, at 10 min for MAP kinase kinase and MAP kinase, and at 20 min for S6 kinase. The activation of Raf-1 kinase and MAP kinase is inhibited by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate pretreatment in the presence of calphostin C or H-7. Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (genistein, herbimycin) do not significantly suppress hyperosmolality-induced MAP kinase activity. The increase of Ins-1,4,5-P3 levels by hyperosmolality suggests that activation of these kinases is mediated at least partially via activation of phospholipase C. Thus, hyperosmolality stimulates the serine/threonine kinases, Raf-1 kinase, MAP kinase kinase, MAP kinase, and S6 kinase, via predominantly protein kinase C-dependent, tyrosine kinase-independent pathways in MDCK cells."
https://openalex.org/W1593790770,"Growth hormone (GH) produces insulin-like effects in rat adipocytes that have been deprived of GH for at least 3 h. The effect of a saturating concentration of GH is qualitatively and quantitatively similar to that produced by 2-4 ng/ml insulin but differs from that of insulin in the respect that adipocytes become refractory to prolonged or repeated stimulation with GH. Since activation of tyrosine kinase is an early event in the action of both hormones, we investigated the possibility that GH stimulation of tyrosine phosphorylation of some protein in the insulin transduction cascade might result in the similar effect of the two hormones. Adipocytes were preincubated for 3 h in the absence of hormones and then reincubated without or with 500 ng/ml GH or 4-400 ng/ml insulin for 10 min. The cells were lysed with an equal volume of buffer containing 1% SDS and preheated to 100 degrees C. Proteins were separated by electrophoresis on 7.5% polyacrylamide gels and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, and tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins were detected using anti-phosphotyrosine antiserum coupled to horseradish peroxidase and reagents to produce chemiluminescence. The faint band seen at 185 kDa in control lanes was increased by GH treatment in five independent experiments. Insulin produced a similar effect at a concentration of 4 ng/ml, and phosphorylation increased in a dose-related manner in cells treated with higher concentrations of insulin. A prominent approximately 95-kDa band that is probably not the beta subunit of the insulin receptor was also seen in GH-treated cells. The beta subunit of the insulin receptor has similar electrophoretic mobility to the 95-kDa protein, but was not phosphorylated to an extent that allowed detection when insulin was added at concentrations below 400 ng/ml. Phosphorylation of the 185- and 95-kDa bands was evident within 1 min after addition of GH, persisted for at least 30 min, and was equally prominent in sensitive and refractory cells. Antiserum to IRS-1 immunoprecipitated the tyrosine-phosphorylated 185-kDa protein. The data suggest that IRS-1 is a substrate for a GH-activated tyrosine kinase, possibly JAK-2, which may account for the insulin-like effects of GH. The data further suggest that refractoriness to insulin-like stimulation by GH may result from an additional GH-dependent action that is distinct from phosphorylation of IRS-1."
https://openalex.org/W1557736354,"Protein B23 is a major nucleolar phosphoprotein proposed to be a ribosome assembly factor. Protein B23 exists as two isoforms, B23.1 and B23.2, differing only in their carboxyl-terminal sequences. The interaction of recombinantly produced B23 isoforms with double-stranded DNA was studied using gel retardation and nitrocellulose filter disk assays. Protein B23.1 bound saturably to radiolabeled plasmid DNA. By competition assays protein B23.1 was also capable of binding RNA and single-stranded DNA. On the other hand, protein B23.2, the shorter of the two isoforms, was not capable of binding double-stranded DNA. The latter result suggested that the carboxyl-terminal end of B23.1 is essential for DNA binding activity. This was confirmed by partial digestion experiments using staphylococcal V8 protease which showed that a 5-kDa fragment, containing the carboxyl-terminal end of protein B23.1 retained DNA binding activity similar to that of the parent molecule. In contrast, a 19-kDa fragment from the amino-terminal half of B23.1 did not bind DNA. The sequence of the carboxyl-terminal 68 amino acids comprising the 5-kDa fragment showed little, if any, similarity to other proteins, suggesting that this segment contains a previously undiscovered nucleic acid binding motif."
https://openalex.org/W1579093659,"Mast cell growth factor (MGF) (also called stem cell factor) synergizes with several lymphokines, including interleukin-3 (IL-3) and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), to promote proliferation and differentiation of certain hemopoietic progenitor cells. Although similar patterns of tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins characterize cells stimulated by MGF, IL-3, and GM-CSF, only the MGF receptor is a tyrosine kinase, and the heterodimeric receptors for IL-3 and GM-CSF share a common beta subunit that is devoid of enzymatic activity. Here we show that signaling pathways utilized by all three cytokines include the cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase JAK2. Analysis of several factor-dependent myeloid cell lines indicated that JAK2 is physically associated with the common beta subunit and with MGF receptor (c-Kit) even prior to ligand binding. However, each of the ligands induced elevated tyrosine phosphorylation of JAK2 and a consequent increase in its catalytic activity. These results demonstrate for the first time the convergence within the same myeloid cells of signaling pathways originating in two distinct lymphokine receptors and a tyrosine kinase receptor on activation of a cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase."
https://openalex.org/W1586009176,"In KB epidermoid cells, we previously showed that interleukin-1 alpha (IL-1) and various mitogens activate the mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases ERK1 and ERK2, which phosphorylate both myelin basic protein (MBP) and a peptide containing Thr669 of the epidermal growth factor receptor. In cell-free extracts made from gingival fibroblasts treated with platelet-derived growth factor or HepG2 hepatoma cells stimulated with phorbol myristate acetate, MBP and Thr669 kinase were both elevated 4-fold, and ERK1 and ERK2 were tyrosine-phosphorylated. In these cells IL-1 activated a kinase(s) that phosphorylated Thr669 peptide but not MBP and failed to cause tyrosine phosphorylation of ERK1/ERK2. Ceramide has been proposed as an intracellular mediator of IL-1 action, but C2-ceramide or sphingosine stimulated predominantly MBP-specific kinase activity in fibroblasts and had no effect in HepG2 cells. p54 MAP kinase (also called stress-activated protein kinase) is a c-Jun kinase first isolated from livers of cycloheximide-treated rats. After IL-1 stimulation, immunoprecipitates of lysates made from all three cell types with specific anti-p54 MAP kinase serum contained Thr669 and c-Jun phosphorylating activity, whereas precipitates from unstimulated cells contained no detectable p54 kinase activity. The major peak of IL-1-stimulated HepG2 Thr669 kinase activity co-chromatographed on Mono Q and phenyl-Superose with immunodetectable p54 MAP kinase. IL-1 did not cause p21ras activation in any cell type. Induction of Thr 669 kinase activity was not abrogated by elevation of cAMP levels, which has been shown to interfere with the activation of Raf-1. We could not detect MAP kinase kinase phosphorylating activity in unfractionated lysates made from IL-1-stimulated fibroblasts or HepG2 cells. KB cells contained a small amount of this activity, but it was not precipitated with an anti-Raf-1 antibody. We conclude that most of the IL-1-activated Thr669 kinase activity in fibroblasts and HepG2 cells, and a portion in KB cells, is due to p54 MAP kinase and that its activation is Ras-, Raf-, and MAP kinase kinase-independent."
https://openalex.org/W2069859055,"The stereochemical specificities and reaction courses for both self-splicing steps of a group II intron have been determined by phosphorothioate substitution at the 5' and 3' splice site phosphodiester bonds. Both steps of the splicing reaction proceeded with a phosphorothioate in the Sp configuration but were blocked by the Rp diastereomer. Both steps also proceeded with inversion of stereochemical configuration around phosphorus, consistent with a concerted transesterification reaction. These results are identical to those found for nuclear precursor mRNA (pre-mRNA) splicing and provide support for the hypothesis that group II introns and nuclear pre-mRNA introns share a common evolutionary history."
https://openalex.org/W1542003098,"The activation of receptor tyrosine kinases generates tyrosine-phosphorylated recognition motifs for the binding of signaling proteins containing Src homology 2 domains. We determined the binding sites of Grb2/Ash, an Src homology 2 domain-containing adaptor protein, within epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptors, using Chinese hamster ovary cells overexpressing human EGF receptor mutants in which one of the autophosphorylation sites was retained. In intact cells, the amount of Grb2/Ash coimmunoprecipitated with mutant receptors retaining tyrosines 992, 1068, 1086, 1148, or 1173 was approximately 10, 85, 55, 50, or 20% of wild-type levels, respectively. The association of Grb2/Ash with in vitro autophosphorylated EGF receptor mutants was detectable in those retaining either tyrosines 1068 or 1086 but not in other mutants including those retaining tyrosine 1148. In peptide inhibition assay, phosphorylated peptides representing tyrosines 1068 and 1086 inhibited the binding of Grb2/Ash to in vitro autophosphorylated wild-type EGF receptors, whereas the other peptides representing tyrosines 992, 1148, and 1173 failed to inhibit the binding. Given that tyrosine 1148 of the activated EGF receptor is a major binding site of Shc (Okabayashi, Y., Kido, Y., Okutani, T., Sugimoto, Y., Sakaguchi, K., and Kasuga, M. (1994) J. Biol. Chem. 269, 18674-18678), these results indicate that tyrosines 1068 and 1086 of activated human EGF receptors are direct high affinity binding sites of Grb2/Ash and that tyrosine 1148 is an indirect binding site through Shc in intact cells."
https://openalex.org/W1567903119,"Abstract Glucagon and glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) are homologous peptide hormones that are recognized by likewise homologous, but highly selective receptors. Analogs of glucagon and GLP-1, in which the divergent residues were systematically exchanged, were employed to identify the structural requirements for their selective receptor recognition. Substitutions in the NH2-terminal part of the glucagon molecule with the corresponding GLP-1 residues, as for example in [Ala2,Glu3]-glucagon and [Val10,Ser12]glucagon, reduced the binding affinity for the glucagon receptor several hundred-fold without increasing the affinity for the GLP-1 receptor. In contrast, introduction of GLP-1 residues into the far COOH-terminal part of the glucagon molecule, e.g. [Val27,Lys28,Gly29,Arg30]glucagon, had a minimal effect on recognition of the glucagon receptor, but improved the affinity of the analog for the GLP-1 receptor up to 200-fold. Similarly, substitutions in especially the far COOH-terminal part of the GLP-1 molecule with the corresponding glucagon residues, e.g. des-Arg30-[Met27,Asn28,Thr29]GLP-1, decreased the affinity for the GLP-1 receptor several hundred-fold (IC50 = 0.4-190 nM) without increasing the affinity for the glucagon receptor. Conversely, substitutions in the NH2-terminal part of the GLP-1 molecule impaired the affinity for the GLP-1 receptor only moderately. We conclude that the selective recognition of the glucagon and GLP-1 receptors is determined by residues located at opposite ends of the homologous peptide ligands. This conclusion is supported by the observation that a chimeric peptide consisting of the NH2-terminal part of the glucagon molecule joined to the COOH-terminal part of the GLP-1 molecule was recognized with high affinity by both receptors."
https://openalex.org/W1495947004,"We previously identified six V2 vasopressin receptor mutations in five unrelated nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (NDI) families. In order to elucidate the effect of these mutations on the function of the V2 vasopressin receptor, we introduced these six and two additional, naturally occurring mutations into the V2 vasopressin receptor gene by in vitro mutagenesis. Five of the mutants (two frameshift, one nonsense, and two missense) failed to stimulate adenylyl cyclase due to their inability to bind vasopressin under the experimental conditions. In contrast, ligand binding and cAMP accumulation were normal for two other mutations, a A61V missense mutation and an in-frame deletion of four amino acids (Arg-247 to Gly-250), suggesting that they are not the cause of NDI in these families. The deletion mutation was found in a family in conjunction with a second mutation, R181C, which yielded a much reduced ligand-binding capacity. The KD of R181C was at least 26 times higher than that of the wild type. Further characterization by an immunofluorescent assay showed that the R181C mutant receptor is expressed and distributed on the cell surface in a manner similar to that of the wild type. This finding indicates that the inability of this mutant to stimulate adenylyl cyclase is caused by the reduced capacity for vasopressin binding and that the R181C mutation is responsible for NDI in this family."

(1993) J. Biol. Chem. 268, 9611-9620). To further study the role of the FGF receptor (FGFR) during this translocation, the intracellular fate of FGFR-1 protein and enzymatic activity was examined. Immunoprecipitation using multiple FGFR-1 antibodies followed by an in vitro tyrosine kinase activity assay enabled us to identify FGFR-1 as a 130-kDa phosphotyrosine-containing protein associated with the nuclear fraction of NIH 3T3 cells exposed to FGF-1. While FGFR-1 tyrosine kinase activity could be detected as a nuclear-associated protein after a 2-h exposure of the NIH 3T3 cells to FGF-1, this activity appeared to be maximal in the nuclear fraction between 4 and 12 h after FGF-1 treatment. In addition, analysis by confocal immunofluorescence microscopy of quiescent and FGF-1-stimulated NIH 3T3 cells reveal a prominent perinuclear FGFR-1 staining pattern in the cells exposed to FGF-1 but not in the quiescent population. We also observed FGFR-1 associated with the nuclear fraction in FGFR-1-transfected L6 rat myoblasts, which are known to be refractive to exogenous FGF-1 and express relatively low levels of endogenous FGFR-1. In addition, these cells also exhibited the presence of a 145-kDa phosphoprotein in the nuclear fraction that was recognized by FGFR-1 antibodies. These results suggest that the FGFR-1 may be translocated near the nucleus upon interaction with its ligand during the entire G1 period of the NIH 3T3 cell cycle as a structurally intact and functional tyrosine kinase that may be accessible to perinuclear polypeptides as a regulatory enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1516148490,"p21ras plays a critical role in cell growth, differentiation, and oncogenic transformation. However, the final physiological effectors of p21ras-mediated signal transduction remain to be determined. We have used patch clamp electrophysiology, pharmacological agents, and transfection with specific Ras or Raf plasmids, to demonstrate that induction of a unique Ca(2+)-activated K+ channel in murine fibroblast cell lines depends on p21ras and its immediate downstream target, the Raf kinase. The importance of this channel in mitogenic signaling is further indicated by its induction in nontransformed cells by epidermal growth factor and platelet-derived growth factor and the ability of K+ channel blockers to inhibit cell proliferation. We suggest that this Ca(2+)-activated K+ channel is one ultimate physiological target of p21ras-mediated signal transduction and that it may play a role in cell proliferation and ras transformation."
https://openalex.org/W1542060836,"Grb2, composed entirely of SH2 and SH3 domains, serves as an adaptor protein in signaling from growth factor-activated tyrosine kinase receptors. It interacts via its SH2 domain with the autophosphorylated carboxyl-terminal tail of activated epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor and via its SH3 domains with proline-rich sequences in the Ras guanine nucleotide releasing factor, Son of sevenless (Sos). Recruitment of the Grb2-Sos complex to the receptor upon its stimulation leads to Ras activation. A major question remains as to whether SH2-mediated binding of Grb2 to the activated receptor results in conformational changes that influence its SH3-mediated association with Sos, thereby affecting Sos activity. This question is addressed through studies of the binding to intact Grb2 of an EGF receptor-derived phosphotyrosine-containing peptide and a Sos-derived proline-rich peptide using isothermal titration calorimetry and surface plasmon resonance measurements. The phosphopeptide binds to Grb2 in a 1:1 complex, with a KD of 0.4 microns. The Sos proline-rich peptide binds to Grb2 in a 2:1 complex, with a KD of 22 microns. Saturation of the SH2 domain of Grb2 with the EGFR phosphopeptide was found not to affect its subsequent binding to the Sos peptide. Thus we detected no influence of SH2 binding upon SH3-mediated interactions, suggesting that the domains do not communicate, and that recruitment itself of Sos to the cell surface is sufficient for Ras signaling."
https://openalex.org/W1503069128,"Tyrosine kinases catalyze phosphoryl transfers from ATP to tyrosine residues in proteins. Despite their growing importance, their kinetic mechanism has remained largely unexplored. In this study, we have investigated the tyrosine kinase reaction catalyzed by purified human recombinant Csk (C-terminal Src kinase). Poly(Glu,Tyr) 4:1 was used as the tyrosine-containing substrate. Both ATP and poly(Glu,Tyr) were shown to be well behaved saturable substrates for recombinant Csk, with Km values that were in reasonable agreement with literature values reported for the non-recombinant enzyme and with kcat about 40 min-1. A sequential kinetic mechanism is suggested by a steady state kinetic analysis. Inhibitor studies with ADP and beta,gamma-imidoadenosine 5‘-triphosphate were performed, and these results provided evidence against the possibility that ordered binding of peptide prior to ATP occurs. While a suitable competitive inhibitor of poly(Glu,Tyr) has not yet been identified, other evidence pointed to a rapid equilibrium random mechanism. Csk utilized adenosine 5‘-O-(3-thiotriphosphate) in place of ATP. The phosphorothioyl transfer occurred with a kcat about 15-20-fold lower than the ATP reaction but with similar Km values. Deuterium solvent isotope effects on kcat were small for both reactions in a pH-independent range, consistent with the possibility that proton transfer is asymmetric in the reaction transition state. Using viscosity effects, ADP product release was suggested to be partially rate determining for catalysis in the standard ATP reaction. A comparison of the Csk kinetic mechanism with that of protein kinase A is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1636426029,"Tektins are proteins that copartition with tubulin in a stable ribbon of three protofilaments from ciliary and flagellar microtubules. After purification, tektins A, B, and C from sea urchin sperm flagellar microtubules appear as extended relatively insoluble filaments, < 5 nm in diameter. We used cross-linking reagents to investigate the associations and structural organization of subunits within tektin polymers isolated from stable protofilament ribbons of Strongylocentrotus purpuratus. We show by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, immunoblots, and transmission electron microscopy that tektins are continuous heteropolymers in the stable protofilament ribbons, and thus flagellar microtubules. Our results also provide evidence for the arrangement of different tektin polypeptides within filaments containing equimolar tektins A and B. Treatment of these core filaments with bis(sulfosuccinimidyl)suberate and with 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide yielded a predominant cross-linked approximately 106-kDa heterodimer of tektins A and B; similar results were obtained by glutaraldehyde cross-linking of tektins solubilized under mild conditions. Finally, cross-linking with 3,3'-dithiobis(sulfosuccinimidylpropionate) revealed a 16 nm periodicity in isolated tektin AB filaments that can be related to the 8 nm tubulin dimer lattice and to periodically associated microtubule components."
https://openalex.org/W1521723788,"Transforming growth factor beta (TGF beta) inhibits the proliferation of a wide range of cell types through interaction with its cell surface receptor (R-TGF beta). R-TGF beta possesses serine/threonine kinase activity rather than the tyrosine kinase activity normally associated with peptide growth factor receptors; nevertheless, TGF beta triggers a signaling pathway that leads to the repression of transcription factors, which appear to mediate the action of receptor tyrosine kinases within the nucleus. Accumulating evidence has also shown that the nonreceptor protein tyrosine kinases of the Src family play essential roles in the signal transduction pathways that regulate cell proliferation, differentiation, and function. Here, we investigate whether signals initiated by R-TGF beta are transduced, at least in part, through members of the Src family of tyrosine kinases. Treatment of the responsive human prostate carcinoma cell line PC3 with TGF beta induces a rapid and specific decrease in cellular levels of pp60Src and pp53/56Lyn and a corresponding decrease in their protein kinase activity when the assays were performed in vitro using the exogenous substrate enolase. Consistent with suppression of pp60Src and pp53/56Lyn kinase activity, TGF beta also caused a substantial intracellular accumulation of the unphosphorylated form of SH2-containing protein (SHC), a substrate of the Src family kinases. This was paralleled by decreased formation of a complex between the adaptor protein known as growth factor receptor-bound protein 2 and SHC. These results suggest, for the first time, that TGF beta induces down-regulation of Src family kinases, leading to disruption of the SHC-growth factor receptor-bound protein 2 complex. These events may play a crucial role in the negative regulation of Ras, as well as in the control of downstream effector molecules involved in the regulation of cell growth."
https://openalex.org/W1595980446,"Human B cells express two closely related immunoglobulin G receptors, FcRIIb1 and FcRIIb2, which differ by a 19 amino acid insertion in the cytoplasmic tail of FcRIIb1. The cytoplasmic tails of both isoforms contain a conserved sequence motif (AENTITYSLL) essential for mediating endocytosis via FcRIIb2. Truncation of this motif abolished endocytosis, while replacement of tyrosine (Tyr273) in FcRIIb2 by phenylalanine had no effect on the amount and kinetics of ligand uptake. Co-cross-linking of FcRIIb1 or FcRIIb2 with the antigen receptor on B cells led to an abortive calcium signal. Neither isoform interfered with the early intracellular calcium mobilization, but both prevented the opening of a plasma membrane calcium channel essential for a sustained elevated intracellular calcium level. Modulation of calcium channel activity is mediated by the same sequence motif essential for endocytosis but requires the presence of Tyr292 in FcRIIb1 and Tyr273 in FcRIIb2. Co-cross-linking of FcRIIb1 with surface IgG is associated with tyrosine phosphorylation of Tyr292, whereas Tyr272 in FcRIIb2 was not phosphorylated. Thus, FcRIIb phosphorylation is probably not directly involved in the modulation of the calcium signal but may be essential for further diversification of signals transduced via the coexpressed isoforms FcRIIb1 and FcRIIb2."
https://openalex.org/W1545496313,"Besides having a role in signal transduction, heterotrimeric G proteins may also be involved in membrane trafficking events as suggested by their presence in specific intracellular compartments. In chromaffin cells, G alpha 0 is associated with secretory organelles, and its activation inhibits exocytosis. Although plasma membrane-bound G proteins are activated by cell-surface receptors, the intracellular proteins controlling organelle-associated G proteins are currently unknown. GAP-43, a neuronal protein enriched in axonal growth cones and presynaptic terminals, is one possible candidate since it can directly stimulate purified G0. We have investigated the interaction of adrenal medullary GAP-43 with chromaffin granule-associated G0 and its effect on catecholamine secretion. Cytosolic and depalmitoylated membrane-extracted GAP-43 were found to stimulate guanine nucleotide binding and exchange activity in chromaffin granule membranes. In permeabilized chromaffin cells, both forms of GAP-43 blocked calcium-dependent exocytosis, and this effect was inhibited by specific antibodies against G alpha 0. A synthetic peptide corresponding to the GAP-43 domain that interacts with G0 inhibited catecholamine secretion. This effect could be selectively reversed by the COOH-terminal peptide of G alpha 0. These results indicate that GAP-43 may be an endogenous pseudoreceptor for the secretory granule-bound form of G0 and can thereby control calcium-regulated exocytosis in chromaffin cells."
https://openalex.org/W1479886346,"Recently, we identified a 59-kDa nuclear phosphoprotein that is associated with a recombinant mouse FKBP-52 (Alnemri, E. S., Fernandes-Alnemri, T., Nelki, D. S., Dudley, K., DuBois, G. C., and Litwack, G. (1993) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 90, 6839-6843). Here we describe the cloning, overexpression, and characterization of this protein from Spodoptera frugiperda insect cells (Sf9 cells). The cloned cDNA codes for an acidic protein of 412 amino acids with distinct structural domains. Starting with the N terminus, the first 218 amino acids contain two highly acidic domains separated by a short basic domain. Following the second large acidic domain is another basic domain of 87 amino acids with significant sequence and structural homology to HMG1 and HMG2 DNA binding proteins. The two basic domains contain several nuclear targeting signals. The last 108 C-terminal amino acids contain a binding domain for immunosuppressive drugs FK506 and rapamycin, which makes this protein a new member of the immunophilin family. We provide evidence that the new immunophilin (FKBP46) is a DNA binding protein that can bind immunosuppressive drug FK506 and possesses peptidylprolyl isomerase activity. FKBP46 is localized in the nucleus and is associated with a nuclear kinase that specifically phosphorylates it in the presence of Mg2+ and ATP. Upon subsequent sequence analysis of the mouse FKBP52 cDNA used in our previous study, it was observed that a spermatid nuclear transition protein 2 (TP2) sequence is fused in frame with the C terminus of the recombinant FKBP52 probably as a result of a cloning artifact. We demonstrate that the FKBP46 does not form a complex with the FKBP52 but rather with the highly basic nuclear protein TP2. Our data suggest that interaction of FKBP46 with TP2 is mediated by the N-terminal acidic domains of FKBP46. This implies that the acidic domains of FKBP46 are involved in protein-protein interaction between nuclear FKBP46 and other basic chromatin proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1563612664,"During heat shock of Escherichia coli, the expression of the major molecular chaperone, GroEL, increases; in addition, a small fraction of the GroEL becomes phosphorylated (Sherman, M. Yu., and Goldberg, A. L. (1992) Nature 367, 166-1692). This heat shock-induced phosphorylation was found to enhance 50-100-fold the capacity of GroEL to bind to several denatured proteins, including casein and fetuin. The phosphorylated species in the cell extract bound quantitatively to affinity columns containing these ligands, and treatment of the extract with alkaline phosphatase markedly reduced this binding. Like heat shock (42 degrees C), overproduction of GroEL (5-10-fold) from the multicopy plasmid at low temperature (25 degrees C) increased the phosphorylated fraction, which bound strongly to denatured fetuin. Heat shock of these cells further enhanced phosphorylation, and about 15% of the induced level of GroEL could bind tightly to the fetuin column. The predominant form of the GroEL that bound to the denatured protein columns appeared to contain at least one phosphate on each of its subunits, although multiple phosphorylated subunits were also observed. With fetuin and casein as affinity ligands, only the phosphorylated species bound, and this material dissociated quantitatively upon addition of ATP-Mg2+. With CRAG and histone as the ligands, some unphosphorylated GroEL also bound, but this species (unlike the phosphorylated form) was not released by ATP alone; its release required the addition of the cofactor GroES together with ATP. Thus, the phosphorylation of GroEL during heat shock greatly enhances its ability to bind to certain denatured proteins and stimulates its ATP-dependent dissociation in the absence of GroES. Presumably, these alterations in the properties of a fraction of GroEL aid in the refolding or the degradation of specific damaged polypeptides."

The fate of the 43-amino acid peptide distal to the activation site was investigated. A cysteine was introduced into the C-terminal region by replacing Ile-445, and another replaced Gly-202, which is on the proximal side of the activation site. In a double mutant, the two new cysteines were close enough in the folded molecule to form an intrachain 202-445 disulfide bond. Tryptophan fluorescence measurements on wild type and the 2 single cysteine mutants indicated that activation results in exposure of at least 1 tryptophan residue, leading to the conclusion that the peptide moves with respect to the protein when it is produced. This was supported by the observation that upon activation there was a decrease in energy transfer between a tryptophan in the bulk of the protein and a probe attached to Cys-445. The peptide could be separated from active toxin by several methods, indicating that it leaves the protein when it is produced, and that it plays no further role in the process of channel formation."
https://openalex.org/W1550090553,"3-Hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl (HMG)-CoA metabolism is compartmentalized in mitochondria, endoplasmic reticulum, and peroxisomes. We investigated the subcellular distribution of HMG-CoA lyase (HL), which is found principally in mitochondria but in which we observed the potential peroxisomal targeting motif cysteine-lysine/arginine-leucine at the carboxyl terminus. We used differential and density gradient centrifugation to separate peroxisomes and mitochondria in liver homogenates of outbred CD-1 mice. Peroxisomal fractions contained 6.4% of total HL activity in mouse liver and 5.6% in human liver. Liver peroxisomal HL activity increased 2.3-2.5 times following induction of peroxisomal proliferation by clofibrate administration. Western blotting with anti-human HL antibodies confirmed the presence of immunoreactive HL in peroxisomal fractions. Mouse liver peroxisomal HL is distinct from mitochondrial HL, measuring approximately 2.5 kDa more by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. By fast protein liquid chromatofocusing analysis, the pI of peroxisomal HL is 7.3, in contrast to 6.2 for mitochondrial HL. These results are consistent with noncleavage of the mitochondrial leader peptide in peroxisomal HL. A distinct species of enzymatically active HL exists in peroxisomes and may play a role in HMG-CoA metabolism in that organelle."

Single nucleotide changes at or near the cleavage site and deletions upstream and downstream of the cleavage site were constructed. The effects of these changes on the rate of Bs-RNase III cleavage were measured. The activity of Bs-RNase III and Escherichia coli RNase III on heterologous substrates was also tested.

https://openalex.org/W1536136875,"E-selectin is an endothelial adhesion molecule that is critically involved in neutrophil adhesion and recruitment. All DNA elements required for interleukin-1 inducibility have been located in the proximal promoter: an NF-ELAM1/ATF site, two NF-kappa B sites (I and II), the NF-ELAM2 element and a TATA box. We show here that interleukin-1 induced promoter activity is exquisitely sensitive to the spatial arrangements of these elements. Phasing of the ATF and NF-kappa B II elements indicates that their relative helix orientation is more important than distance per se. This sensitivity is partly due to a requirement for correctly oriented, transcription factor-induced DNA-bending. (i) Band shift analyses with permuted ATF- and NF-kappa B elements show that their associated factors all bend DNA. (ii) One can functionally replace the NF-ELAM1/ATF element by a subset of a panel of DNA fragments that contain defined bends in various planes. We conclude that the main role of the factors binding at the NF-ELAM1/ATF element is to alter the conformation of the E-selectin promoter, presumably looping distant enhancer elements into each other's proximity."
https://openalex.org/W1532920122,"Transforming growth factor beta 2 (TGF-beta 2) is less potent than TGF-beta 1 in some endothelial cell proliferation assays due to the greater tendency of TGF-beta 2 to bind alpha 2-macroglobulin (alpha 2M). Substitution of TGF-beta 1 residues 40-47 into the TGF-beta 2 sequence yields a chimeric molecule that, like TGF-beta 1, expresses activity that is not substantially affected by serum alpha 2M (Burmester, J. K., Qian, S. W., Roberts, A. B., Huang, A., Amatayakul-Chantler, S., Suardet, L., Odartchenko, N., Madri, J. A., and Sporn, M. B. (1993) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 90, 8628-8632). In this investigation, we studied the binding of TGF-beta chimeras, which contain TGF-beta 1 residues 40-47, to both major conformations of human alpha 2M under apparent equilibrium conditions. Native alpha 2M, the primary form of this protein in serum, bound TGF-beta 2/beta 1 (40-82) and TGF-beta 2/beta 1 (40-47) with low affinity. The apparent KD values for the two chimeras and native alpha 2M were 310 and 330 nM, respectively. These values were much higher than the KD determined for TGF-beta 2 and native alpha 2M (11 nM) and equivalent to the KD determined for TGF-beta 1 and native alpha 2M. By contrast, both TGF-beta chimeras bound alpha 2M-methylamine, an altered conformation of alpha 2M, with high affinity (16 and 19 nM), which is characteristic of TGF-beta 2 and not TGF-beta 1. Fetal bovine heart endothelial cell DNA synthesis was inhibited to a similar degree by TGF-beta 1, TGF-beta 2, TGF-beta 2/beta 1 (40-82), and TGF-beta 2/beta 1 (40-47) in the presence of dilute (0.2%) fetal bovine serum. When 0.07 microM alpha 2M-methylamine was added, the activities of TGF-beta 2, TGF-beta 2/beta 1 (40-82), and TGF-beta 2/beta 1 (40-47) were significantly counteracted while the activity of TGF-beta 1 was unchanged, as would be predicted by the equilibrium binding analyses. These studies indicate that the TGF-beta structural elements, which mediate binding to native alpha 2M and conformationally transformed alpha 2M, are not equivalent. Residues 40-47 are critical in determining affinity for native alpha 2M but are less important in determining affinity for alpha 2M-methylamine."

To study possible mechanisms by which the activity of p50csk might be regulated, we searched for p50csk-interacting proteins in human erythroleukemia cells. We found that in response to the treatment of cells with pervanadate, a potent inhibitor of protein tyrosine phosphatases, or to the cross-linking of Fc gamma RIIA receptors, p50csk becomes tightly associated with a 36-kDa protein (p36). This association is dependent on the tyrosine phosphorylation of p36 and involves its interaction with the SH2 domain of p50csk.p36 can be phosphorylated in vitro by p50csk or by a full-length GST-Csk fusion protein expressed in Escherichia coli. Tyrosine-phosphorylated p36 is found exclusively in the particulate membrane fraction of the cell. Conditions that induce the formation of the p50csk.p36 complex promote the appearance of p50csk in the particulate fraction. These data suggest that the association between p50csk and p36 serves to translocate the normally cytosolic p50csk to the membrane, where it presumably interacts with its physiologically relevant substrates."
https://openalex.org/W1507299757,"Abstract Growth factor receptor-binding protein-2 (GRB2) couples growth factor receptor activation to the p21ras nucleotide exchange factor son-of-sevenless (SOS). Son-of-sevenless can serve as a substrate for mitogen-activated protein kinases and may be subject to feed back regulation in mitogen-stimulated cells. Herein, we demonstrate phosphorylation on GRB2 in rat A10 vascular smooth muscle cells exposed to platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF). Lysates from smooth cells stimulated with PDGF revealed a shift in the electrophoretic mobility of GRB2. Further investigation confirmed that phosphorylation on GRB2 accompanied this mobility shift. Phosphorylation on GRB2 was time-dependent and correlated with PDGF receptor activation. The time-course for phosphorylation of GRB2 and subsequent decay corresponded with other events characteristic of platelet-derived growth factor signaling. GRB2 was not phosphorylated in cells treated with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, and down-regulation of protein kinase C failed to attenuate phosphorylation on GRB2 in response to growth factor. Analysis of GRB2 immune complexes revealed a kinase activity capable of phosphorylating GRB2 in vitro and demonstrated that the kinase activated in response to PDGF may physically associate with GRB2 signaling complexes."
https://openalex.org/W2416000650,"The 5'-flanking region of the myelin basic protein (MBP) contains several regulatory elements that differentially contribute to the cell type-specific transcription of MBP in cells derived from the central nervous system. The distal regulatory element, termed MB3, had previously been shown to have characteristics of a cell type-specific enhancer element and bind to multiple brain-derived nuclear proteins in vitro. We now report the isolation of a recombinant cDNA clone, named myelin regulatory factor-1 (MRF-1) from a mouse brain expression library that encodes a novel protein which interacts with the MB3 domain. Computer-assisted analysis of MRF-1 revealed substantial sequence homology in the central and the COOH-terminal regions of this protein with the previously identified splicing factor SC35. Cotransfection studies indicated that MRF-1 increases transcription of the MBP promoter in glial cells and that this activation requires an intact MRF-1-binding site within the MB3 region. MRF-1 cDNA hybridized to three RNA species 1.8, 2.5, and 3.0 kilobases which are expressed in all tissues analyzed. The gene encoding MRF-1 is located on the distal half of mouse chromosome 11 in a region where the human homolog would be predicted to reside on human chromosome 17."
