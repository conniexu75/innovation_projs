https://openalex.org/W2015964634,"Transgenic mice expressing a stabilized β-catenin in neural precursors develop enlarged brains with increased cerebral cortical surface area and folds resembling sulci and gyri of higher mammals. Brains from transgenic animals have enlarged lateral ventricles lined with neuroepithelial precursor cells, reflecting an expansion of the precursor population. Compared with wild-type precursors, a greater proportion of transgenic precursors reenter the cell cycle after mitosis. These results show that β-catenin can function in the decision of precursors to proliferate or differentiate during mammalian neuronal development and suggest that β-catenin can regulate cerebral cortical size by controlling the generation of neural precursor cells."

https://openalex.org/W2163577434,"Class IA phosphoinositide 3-kinases (PI3Ks) are a family of p85/p110 heterodimeric lipid kinases that generate second messenger signals downstream of tyrosine kinases, thereby controlling cell metabolism, growth, proliferation, differentiation, motility, and survival. Mammals express three class IA catalytic subunits: p110alpha, p110beta, and p110delta. It is unclear to what extent these p110 isoforms have overlapping or distinct biological roles. Mice expressing a catalytically inactive form of p110delta (p110delta(D910A)) were generated by gene targeting. Antigen receptor signaling in B and T cells was impaired and immune responses in vivo were attenuated in p110delta mutant mice. They also developed inflammatory bowel disease. These results reveal a selective role for p110delta in immunity."
https://openalex.org/W2164225225,"In the insect olfactory system, oscillatory synchronization is functionally relevant and reflects the coherent activation of dynamic neural assemblies. We examined the role of such oscillatory synchronization in information transfer between networks in this system. The antennal lobe is the obligatory relay for olfactory afferent signals and generates oscillatory output. The mushroom body is responsible for formation and retrieval of olfactory and other memories. The format of odor representations differs significantly across these structures. Whereas representations are dense, dynamic, and seemingly redundant in the antennal lobe, they are sparse and carried by more selective neurons in the mushroom body. This transformation relies on a combination of oscillatory dynamics and intrinsic and circuit properties that act together to selectively filter and synthesize the output from the antennal lobe. These results provide direct support for the functional relevance of correlation codes and shed some light on the role of oscillatory synchronization in sensory networks."

https://openalex.org/W1673772832,"We present spatial coherence measurements of extreme ultraviolet (EUV) light generated through the process of high-harmonic up-conversion of a femtosecond laser. With a phase-matched hollow-fiber geometry, the generated beam was found to exhibit essentially full spatial coherence. The coherence of this laser-like EUV source was shown by recording Gabor holograms of small objects. This work demonstrates the capability to perform EUV holography with a tabletop experimental setup. Such an EUV source, with low divergence and high spatial coherence, can be used for experiments involving high-precision metrology, inspection of optical components for EUV lithography, and microscopy and holography with nanometer resolution. Furthermore, the short time duration of the EUV radiation (a few femtoseconds) will enable EUV microscopy and holography to be performed with ultrahigh time resolution."
https://openalex.org/W2082352121,"The adhesion and friction of smooth polymer surfaces were studied below the glass transition temperature by use of a surface forces apparatus. The friction force of a crosslinked polymer was orders of magnitude less than that of an uncrosslinked polymer. In contrast, after chain scission of the outermost layers, the adhesion hysteresis and friction forces increase substantially. These results show that polymer-polymer adhesion hysteresis and friction depend on the dynamic rearrangement of the outermost polymer segments at shearing interfaces, and that both increase as a transition is made from crosslinked surfaces to surfaces with long chains to surfaces with quasi-free ends. The results suggest new ways for manipulating the adhesion and friction of polymer surfaces by adjusting the state of the surface chains."
https://openalex.org/W2125578099,"Mammalian organogenesis requires the expansion of pluripotent precursor cells before the subsequent determination of specific cell types, but the tissue-specific molecular mechanisms that regulate the initial expansion of primordial cells remain poorly defined. We have genetically established that Six6 homeodomain factor, acting as a strong tissue-specific repressor, regulates early progenitor cell proliferation during mammalian retinogenesis and pituitary development. Six6, in association with Dach corepressors, regulates proliferation by directly repressing cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors, including the p27Kip1 promoter. These data reveal a molecular mechanism by which a tissue-specific transcriptional repressor-corepressor complex can provide an organ-specific strategy for physiological expansion of precursor populations."

In contrast, mutations V424A in IS6 and L983A in IIS6 caused strong negative shifts. Most IS6 mutations opposed inactivation from closed states, but most IIS6 mutations favored such inactivation. Mutations L421C and L983A near the intracellular ends of IS6 and IIS6, respectively, exhibited significant sustained Na+ currents at the end of 30-ms depolarizations, indicating a role for these residues in Na+ channel fast inactivation. These residues, in combination with residues at the intracellular end of IVS6, are well situated to form an inactivation gate receptor. Mutation I409A in IS6 reduced the affinity of the local anesthetic etidocaine for the inactivated state by 6-fold, and mutations I409A and N418A reduced use-dependent block by etidocaine. No IS6 or IIS6 mutations studied affected inactivated-state affinity or use-dependent block by the neuroprotective drug sipatrigine (compound 619C89).

The α subunit is composed of four homologous domains (I–IV), each with six transmembrane segments (S1–S6) and an additional membrane-reentrant pore loop (P-loop) between segments S5 and S6 (2Catterall W.A.

Analogous to the structural topology of pore-forming M2 segments of the K+ channel from Streptomyces lividans (KcsA) (6Doyle D.A. Cabral J.M. Pfuetzner R.A. Kuo A.L. Gulbis J.M. Cohen S.L. Chait B.T.

Huxley A.F. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1952; 117: 500-544Crossref Scopus (14050) Google Scholar, 8Armstrong C.M. Physiol. Rev. 1981; 61: 644-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). Analysis of the primary structure of the Na+channel α subunit led to the prediction that S4 transmembrane segments, which contain repeated motifs of positively charged arginine and lysine residues every three amino acids, might serve as the voltage sensor (9Catterall W.A. Trends Neurosci. 1986; 9: 7-10Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 10Guy H.R. Seetharamulu P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 508-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar). Depolarization of the membrane was proposed to cause the S4 segments to move outward, inducing a conformational change in the pore of the channel resulting in activation. Site-directed mutagenesis studies have demonstrated that the positively charged residues in all four S4 segments contribute to the voltage-dependent activation of the Na+ channel (11Stühmer W.

Physiol. 1997; 110: 391-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). The proposed outward movement of the S4 segments has been directly detected using mutagenesis, covalent modification, and fluorescent imaging experiments (13Yang N. Horn R.

Na+ channel fast inactivation occurs within a few milliseconds of channel opening and is mediated by the intracellular loop connecting domains III and IV (16Vassilev P.M. Scheuer T. Catterall W.A.

Mutagenesis studies of this loop revealed three hydrophobic residues (isoleucine, phenylalanine, and methionine (IFM motif)) that are critical for fast inactivation (18West J.W. Patton D.E.

Physiol. 1997; 110: 391-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). The proposed outward movement of the S4 segments has been directly detected using mutagenesis, covalent modification, and fluorescent imaging experiments (13Yang N. Horn R.

Na+ channel fast inactivation occurs within a few milliseconds of channel opening and is mediated by the intracellular loop connecting domains III and IV (16Vassilev P.M. Scheuer T. Catterall W.A.

Mutagenesis studies of this loop revealed three hydrophobic residues (isoleucine, phenylalanine, and methionine (IFM motif)) that are critical for fast inactivation (18West J.W. Patton D.E.

Here we report that the atypical PKC-ζ isoform participates in the induction of MMP-9 expression by interleukin-1 (IL-1) and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) in rat C6 glioma cells. Indeed, zymography and semi-quantitative reverse transcriptase-PCR analysis showed that pretreatment of C6 cells with PKC-ζ pseudosubstrate abolished MMP-9 activity and gene expression induced by IL-1 or TNF-α. Accordingly, IL-1 and TNF-α were able to induce PKC-ζ activity, as demonstrated by in vitro kinase assay using immunoprecipitated PKC-ζ. Furthermore, stable C6 clones overexpressing PKC-ζ, but not PKC-ε, displayed an up-regulation of MMP-9 constitutive expression as well as an increase ofmmp-9 promoter activity. These processes were inhibited by an NF-κB-blocking peptide and completely prevented by NF-κB-binding site mutation in the mmp-9 promoter.

One of these MMPs, MMP-9, has received much attention as its expression correlates with the progression of glioma (1Rao J.S. Steck P.A. Mohanam S. Stetler-Stevenson W.G. Liotta L.A. Sawaya R. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 2208-2211PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, MMP-9 seems to be essential for the invasiveness of glioma cells, as it was recently reported that the inhibition of MMP-9 expression by antisense gene transfer strongly reduced the invasion of glioblastoma cells in vitro and in vivo (2Kondraganti S. Mohanam S. Chintala S.K. Kin Y. Jasti S.L. Nirmala C. Lakka S.S. Adachi Y. Kyritsis A.P. Ali-Osman F. Sawaya R. Fuller G.N. Rao J.S. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 6851-6855PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, understanding the role of the molecules implicated in the signaling pathways leading tommp-9 gene expression in glioma cells is important in order to identify new therapeutic targets.Several studies (3Juarez J.

Members of the PKC family are divided into the following three groups of isoenzymes: the conventional PKC isoforms, which are activated by calcium and diacylglycerol (α, βI, βII, and γ); the novel PKCs, which are activated by diacylglycerol but are calcium-insensitive (δ, ε, η, and θ); and the atypical PKCs, which are calcium- and diacylglycerol-insensitive (ζ and ι/λ). Despite the fact that a large number of studies (5Chintala S.K. Sawaya R. Aggarwal B.B. Majumder S. Giri D.K. Kyritsis A.P. Gokaslan Z.L. Rao J.S. J. Biol.

Although our group (8St-Denis A. Chano F. Tremblay P., St- Pierre Y. Descoteaux A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32787-32792Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) has shown that a dominant-negative form of PKC-α potentiated the secretion of MMP-9 induced by lipopolysaccharide in the mouse macrophage cell line RAW 264.7, others (9Xie B. Laouar A. Huberman E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11576-11582Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) have shown that PKC-β isoform is implicated in PMA-inducedmmp-9 gene expression in human HL-60 myeloid leukemia cells. However, the involvement of specific PKC isoforms in the signaling pathways leading to MMP-9 expression by inflammatory cytokines remains unclear. In a previous study (10Esteve P.O. Tremblay P. Houde M., St- Pierre Y. Mandeville R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1403: 85-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), however, we reported that the inflammatory cytokines, interleukin-1 (IL-1) and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) but not PMA, were both able to induce MMP-9 expression in the rat C6 glioma cells, raising the possibility that atypical, PMA-independent PKC isoenzymes could be involved. Among the atypical PKC isoforms, PKC-ζ was of potential interest as its activation could be induced by IL-1 and TNF-α (11Muller G. Ayoub M. Storz P. Rennecke J. Fabbro D. Pfizenmaier K. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1961-1969Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar, 12Limatola C. Barabino B. Nista A. Santoni A. Biochem. J. 1997; 321: 497-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Moreover, PKC-ζ plays a critical role in the regulation of gene transcription via nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) (13Diaz-Meco M.T. Berra E. Municio M.M. Sanz L. Lozano J. Dominguez I. Diaz-Golpe V. Lain de Lera M.T. Alcami J. Paya C.V. Arenzana-Seisdedos F. Virelizier J.-L. Moscat J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 4770-4775Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), a transcriptional factor required for mmp-9 gene expression (14Sato H. Seiki M. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 395-405PubMed Google Scholar).In this work, we show that induction of MMP-9 expression by IL-1 or TNF-α in C6 glioma cells is inhibited by pretreatment with a PKC-ζ-specific inhibitory peptide (PKC-ζ PS) and that both IL-1 and TNF-α induce the activation of PKC-ζ in C6 cells. Furthermore, stable C6 transfectants overexpressing PKC-ζ isoenzyme, but not clones overexpressing the PKC-ε isoenzyme, display a constitutive expression of MMP-9 at the mRNA and protein levels. Transient transfection experiments using mmp-9 promoter constructs not only confirmed that PKC-ζ exerts its effect by increasing its transcriptional activity but also implicated NF-κB as a key regulator of MMP-9 expression by PKC-ζ.DISCUSSIONIn the present study, we have shown that the atypical PKC isoenzyme PKC-ζ plays a critical role in mediating the IL-1- and TNF-α-dependent production of MMP-9 in C6 glioma cells through the downstream activation of NF-κB. Specifically, we showed the following: 1) up-regulation of MMP-9 expression at the mRNA and protein levels by IL-1 and TNF-α is inhibited by a PKC-ζ-specific blocking peptide; 2) both cytokines activates PKC-ζ; 3) overexpression of PKC-ζ, but not of PKC-ε, induces expression of the MMP-9 at the mRNA and protein levels; 4) addition of an NF-κB-blocking peptide, but not of a control peptide, inhibits MMP-9-induced expression in C6 cells or PKC-ζ transfectants; and 5) transient transfection experiments established that the up-regulation of the mmp-9 promoter activity in cells overexpressing PKC-ζ was completely abolished by mutation in NF-κB-binding site.In a previous publication (10Esteve P.O. Tremblay P. Houde M., St- Pierre Y. Mandeville R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1403: 85-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), we had reported that IL-1 and TNF-α, but not PMA, were able to induce expression of MMP-9 in the rat C6 glioma cells. In the present work, we now identify PKC-ζ, a PMA-insensitive isoenzyme, as a key regulator of mmp-9 gene expression in C6 cells. Moreover, our data further establish a functional link between PKC-ζ, IL-1, TNF-α, and the activation of NF-κB, a transcription factor necessary for up-regulation of MMP-9 expression (12Limatola C. Barabino B. Nista A. Santoni A. Biochem. J. 1997; 321: 497-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). This implication of NF-κB and PKC-ζ in the induction of MMP-9 by IL-1 and TNF-α likely results from the activation of IκB kinase by PKC-ζ (27Diaz-Meco M.T. Dominguez I. Sanz L. Dent P. Lozano J. Municio M.M. Berra E. Hay R.T. Sturgill T.W. Moscat J. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2842-2848Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar), which in turn induces, upon phosphorylation, the dissociation of the negative regulator IκB-α from NF-κB (28DiDonato J.A. Hayakawa M. Rothwarf D.M. Zandi E. Karin M. Nature. 1997; 388: 548-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (1897) Google Scholar). In addition, PKC-ζ can be involved in the phosphorylation of RelA, a subunit of NF-κB, which leads to an increase of its transcriptional activity (29Anrather J. Csizmadia V. Soares M.P. Winkler H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13594-13603Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). In fact, our observation that the induction of MMP-9 by IL-1 or TNF-α was completely abolished by pretreatment with an NF-κB-specific inhibitory peptide, which acts by blocking translocation of NF-κB to the nucleus, strongly supports the idea that MMP-9 induction by these cytokines is mainly NF-κB-dependent. However, this peptide failed to achieve the same level of inhibition with the clones overexpressing PKC-ζ. This could be attributed to the high levels of the activated forms of the isoenzymes. In addition to NF-κB which is necessary but not sufficient to up-regulate MMP-9, the previous demonstration that the activating protein-1 (AP-1) plays an essential role in the transcription of the mmp-9 gene (12Limatola C. Barabino B. Nista A. Santoni A. Biochem. J. 1997; 321: 497-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) further supports an association between PKC-ζ and AP-1. Such an increase in the AP-1 binding activity could be the result of an increase of c-junprotooncogene mRNA levels, a mechanism previously observed in transfected U937 cells stably overexpressing PKC-ζ (30Ways D.K. Posekany K. deVente J. Garris T. Chen J. Hooker J. Qin W. Cook P. Fletcher D. Parker P. Cell Growth Differ. 1994; 5: 1195-1203PubMed Google Scholar). Because both AP-1 and NF-κB can be regulated by mitogen-activated protein kinases (31Karin M. J. Biol.

A case in point would be p38, a mitogen-activated protein kinase recently identified as being involved in the regulation of MMP-9 upon stimulation by IL-1 and TNF-α in C6 cells (35Missé D.

Such an activation of PKC-ζ by these cytokines has been reported previously (11Muller G. Ayoub M. Storz P. Rennecke J. Fabbro D. Pfizenmaier K.

Among the putative second messengers that could mediate the activation of PKC-ζ upon stimulation with IL-1 and TNF-α are Ras or ceramide (36Diaz-Meco M.T. Lozano J. Municio M.M. Berra E. Trutos S.

The implication phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI-3K), another activator of PKC-ζ (38Nakanishi H. Brewer K.A. Exton J.H. J. Biol.

O. Estève and Y. St-Pierre, unpublished observations. suggesting that PI 3-kinase may rather act as a negative regulator of MMP-9. A similar role for this kinase has recently been assigned in the case of the nitric-oxide synthase gene following induction by IL-1 in C6 cells (39Pahan K. Raymond J.R. Singh I. J. Biol.

In support of this notion, C6-ceramide and p21Ras have been shown to be involved in the induction of nitric-oxide synthase expression by IL-1 or TNF-α through NF-κB in C6 cells and in rat primary astrocytes (40Pahan K.

Further investigations on the early events in the signaling cascade leading the activation of PKC-ζ by IL-1 and TNF-α should clarify this issue.It is noteworthy that we have observed a low but reproducible decrease of MMP-2 activation upon addition of the SN50 peptide but not the control peptide. Other investigators (42Han Y.P. Tuan T.L., Wu, H. Hughes M. Garner W.L. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 131-139PubMed Google Scholar) have also reported SN50 can block activation of MMP-2, most notably in dermal fibroblasts, and attributed its effect to its ability to block the NF-κB signaling pathway that leads to the induction of MT1-MMP. Whether MT1-MMP is implicated in the activation of MMP-2 in glioma cells is under investigationIn conclusion, we showed that PKC-ζ is directly involved in the signaling cascade that controls the transcription of themmp-9 gene via the NF-κB-dependent pathway in the C6 glioma cells. Accumulating evidence indicates that MMP-9 contributes not only to tumor invasion but also to the degradation of the blood-brain barrier, to neurodegenerative processes, and to angiogenesis (43Rosenberg G.A.

In vivo studies, using the C6 cells and PKC-ζ-blocking agent, need to be done in order to validate thein vitro finding and establish whether PKC antagonists can be envisaged in the therapy of glioma-derived tumors. Glioma cells have the ability to invade brain tissues by secreting matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), 1The abbreviations used are: MMPs, matrix metalloproteinases; PKC, protein kinase C; IL-1, interleukin-1; TNF-α, tumor necrosis factor-α; PKC-ζ PS, PKC-ζ pseudosubstrate; PMA, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate; NF-κB, nuclear factor-κB; PMSF, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride; AP-1, activating protein-1; PI-3 kinase, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; RT, reverse transcriptase; wt, wild type. 1The abbreviations used are: MMPs, matrix metalloproteinases; PKC, protein kinase C; IL-1, interleukin-1; TNF-α, tumor necrosis factor-α; PKC-ζ PS, PKC-ζ pseudosubstrate; PMA, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate; NF-κB, nuclear factor-κB; PMSF, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride; AP-1, activating protein-1; PI-3 kinase, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; RT, reverse transcriptase; wt, wild type. a family of proteases able to degrade different components of the extracellular matrix including collagen, fibronectin, and proteoglycans. One of these MMPs, MMP-9, has received much attention as its expression correlates with the progression of glioma (1Rao J.S. Steck P.A. Mohanam S. Stetler-Stevenson W.G. Liotta L.A. Sawaya R. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 2208-2211PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, MMP-9 seems to be essential for the invasiveness of glioma cells, as it was recently reported that the inhibition of MMP-9 expression by antisense gene transfer strongly reduced the invasion of glioblastoma cells in vitro and in vivo (2Kondraganti S. Mohanam S. Chintala S.K. Kin Y. Jasti S.L. Nirmala C. Lakka S.S. Adachi Y. Kyritsis A.P. Ali-Osman F. Sawaya R. Fuller G.N. Rao J.S. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 6851-6855PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, understanding the role of the molecules implicated in the signaling pathways leading tommp-9 gene expression in glioma cells is important in order to identify new therapeutic targets. Several studies (3Juarez J. Clayman G. Nakajima M. Tanakabe K.K. Saya H. Nicolson G.L. Boyd D. Int. J. Cancer. 1993; 55: 10-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 4Fabunmi R.P. Baker A.H.

Members of the PKC family are divided into the following three groups of isoenzymes: the conventional PKC isoforms, which are activated by calcium and diacylglycerol (α, βI, βII, and γ); the novel PKCs, which are activated by diacylglycerol but are calcium-insensitive (δ, ε, η, and θ); and the atypical PKCs, which are calcium- and diacylglycerol-insensitive (ζ and ι/λ). Despite the fact that a large number of studies (5Chintala S.K. Sawaya R. Aggarwal B.B. Majumder S. Giri D.K. Kyritsis A.P. Gokaslan Z.L. Rao J.S. J. Biol.

Immunol. 1994; 152: 3637-3644PubMed Google Scholar) have established a link between PKCs and MMP-9 expression using PKC inhibitors, very few studies have addressed the implication of specific PKC isoenzymes in the regulation of MMP-9. Although our group (8St-Denis A. Chano F. Tremblay P., St- Pierre Y. Descoteaux A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32787-32792Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) has shown that a dominant-negative form of PKC-α potentiated the secretion of MMP-9 induced by lipopolysaccharide in the mouse macrophage cell line RAW 264.7, others (9Xie B. Laouar A. Huberman E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11576-11582Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) have shown that PKC-β isoform is implicated in PMA-inducedmmp-9 gene expression in human HL-60 myeloid leukemia cells. However, the involvement of specific PKC isoforms in the signaling pathways leading to MMP-9 expression by inflammatory cytokines remains unclear. In a previous study (10Esteve P.O. Tremblay P. Houde M., St- Pierre Y. Mandeville R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1403: 85-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), however, we reported that the inflammatory cytokines, interleukin-1 (IL-1) and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) but not PMA, were both able to induce MMP-9 expression in the rat C6 glioma cells, raising the possibility that atypical, PMA-independent PKC isoenzymes could be involved. Among the atypical PKC isoforms, PKC-ζ was of potential interest as its activation could be induced by IL-1 and TNF-α (11Muller G. Ayoub M. Storz P. Rennecke J. Fabbro D. Pfizenmaier K. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1961-1969Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar, 12Limatola C. Barabino B. Nista A. Santoni A. Biochem. J. 1997; 321: 497-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Moreover, PKC-ζ plays a critical role in the regulation of gene transcription via nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) (13Diaz-Meco M.T. Berra E. Municio M.M. Sanz L. Lozano J. Dominguez I. Diaz-Golpe V. Lain de Lera M.T. Alcami J. Paya C.V. Arenzana-Seisdedos F. Virelizier J.-L. Moscat J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 4770-4775Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), a transcriptional factor required for mmp-9 gene expression (14Sato H. Seiki M. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 395-405PubMed Google Scholar). In this work, we show that induction of MMP-9 expression by IL-1 or TNF-α in C6 glioma cells is inhibited by pretreatment with a PKC-ζ-specific inhibitory peptide (PKC-ζ PS) and that both IL-1 and TNF-α induce the activation of PKC-ζ in C6 cells. Furthermore, stable C6 transfectants overexpressing PKC-ζ isoenzyme, but not clones overexpressing the PKC-ε isoenzyme, display a constitutive expression of MMP-9 at the mRNA and protein levels. Transient transfection experiments using mmp-9 promoter constructs not only confirmed that PKC-ζ exerts its effect by increasing its transcriptional activity but also implicated NF-κB as a key regulator of MMP-9 expression by PKC-ζ. DISCUSSIONIn the present study, we have shown that the atypical PKC isoenzyme PKC-ζ plays a critical role in mediating the IL-1- and TNF-α-dependent production of MMP-9 in C6 glioma cells through the downstream activation of NF-κB. Specifically, we showed the following: 1) up-regulation of MMP-9 expression at the mRNA and protein levels by IL-1 and TNF-α is inhibited by a PKC-ζ-specific blocking peptide; 2) both cytokines activates PKC-ζ; 3) overexpression of PKC-ζ, but not of PKC-ε, induces expression of the MMP-9 at the mRNA and protein levels; 4) addition of an NF-κB-blocking peptide, but not of a control peptide, inhibits MMP-9-induced expression in C6 cells or PKC-ζ transfectants; and 5) transient transfection experiments established that the up-regulation of the mmp-9 promoter activity in cells overexpressing PKC-ζ was completely abolished by mutation in NF-κB-binding site.In a previous publication (10Esteve P.O. Tremblay P. Houde M., St- Pierre Y. Mandeville R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1403: 85-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), we had reported that IL-1 and TNF-α, but not PMA, were able to induce expression of MMP-9 in the rat C6 glioma cells. In the present work, we now identify PKC-ζ, a PMA-insensitive isoenzyme, as a key regulator of mmp-9 gene expression in C6 cells. Moreover, our data further establish a functional link between PKC-ζ, IL-1, TNF-α, and the activation of NF-κB, a transcription factor necessary for up-regulation of MMP-9 expression (12Limatola C. Barabino B. Nista A. Santoni A. Biochem. J. 1997; 321: 497-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). This implication of NF-κB and PKC-ζ in the induction of MMP-9 by IL-1 and TNF-α likely results from the activation of IκB kinase by PKC-ζ (27Diaz-Meco M.T. Dominguez I. Sanz L. Dent P. Lozano J. Municio M.M. Berra E. Hay R.T. Sturgill T.W. Moscat J. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2842-2848Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar), which in turn induces, upon phosphorylation, the dissociation of the negative regulator IκB-α from NF-κB (28DiDonato J.A. Hayakawa M. Rothwarf D.M. Zandi E. Karin M. Nature. 1997; 388: 548-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (1897) Google Scholar). In addition, PKC-ζ can be involved in the phosphorylation of RelA, a subunit of NF-κB, which leads to an increase of its transcriptional activity (29Anrather J. Csizmadia V. Soares M.P. Winkler H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13594-13603Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). In fact, our observation that the induction of MMP-9 by IL-1 or TNF-α was completely abolished by pretreatment with an NF-κB-specific inhibitory peptide, which acts by blocking translocation of NF-κB to the nucleus, strongly supports the idea that MMP-9 induction by these cytokines is mainly NF-κB-dependent. However, this peptide failed to achieve the same level of inhibition with the clones overexpressing PKC-ζ. This could be attributed to the high levels of the activated forms of the isoenzymes. In addition to NF-κB which is necessary but not sufficient to up-regulate MMP-9, the previous demonstration that the activating protein-1 (AP-1) plays an essential role in the transcription of the mmp-9 gene (12Limatola C. Barabino B. Nista A. Santoni A. Biochem. J. 1997; 321: 497-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) further supports an association between PKC-ζ and AP-1. Such an increase in the AP-1 binding activity could be the result of an increase of c-junprotooncogene mRNA levels, a mechanism previously observed in transfected U937 cells stably overexpressing PKC-ζ (30Ways D.K. Posekany K. deVente J. Garris T. Chen J. Hooker J. Qin W. Cook P. Fletcher D. Parker P. Cell Growth Differ. 1994; 5: 1195-1203PubMed Google Scholar). Because both AP-1 and NF-κB can be regulated by mitogen-activated protein kinases (31Karin M. J. Biol.

A case in point would be p38, a mitogen-activated protein kinase recently identified as being involved in the regulation of MMP-9 upon stimulation by IL-1 and TNF-α in C6 cells (35Missé D. Esteve P.O. Rennenboog B. Vidal M. Cerutti M., St- Pierre Y. Yssel H. Parmentier M. Veas F. Blood. 2001; 98: 541-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). We found that IL-1 and TNF-α were able to stimulate PKC-ζ activity in C6 glioma cells. Such an activation of PKC-ζ by these cytokines has been reported previously (11Muller G. Ayoub M. Storz P.

Among the putative second messengers that could mediate the activation of PKC-ζ upon stimulation with IL-1 and TNF-α are Ras or ceramide (36Diaz-Meco M.T. Lozano J. Municio M.M. Berra E. Trutos S.

The implication phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI-3K), another activator of PKC-ζ (38Nakanishi H. Brewer K.A. Exton J.H. J. Biol.

O. Estève and Y. St-Pierre, unpublished observations. suggesting that PI 3-kinase may rather act as a negative regulator of MMP-9. A similar role for this kinase has recently been assigned in the case of the nitric-oxide synthase gene following induction by IL-1 in C6 cells (39Pahan K. Raymond J.R. Singh I. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7528-7536Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar), suggesting that both genes are regulated through a common signaling pathway. In support of this notion, C6-ceramide and p21Ras have been shown to be involved in the induction of nitric-oxide synthase expression by IL-1 or TNF-α through NF-κB in C6 cells and in rat primary astrocytes (40Pahan K.

Further investigations on the early events in the signaling cascade leading the activation of PKC-ζ by IL-1 and TNF-α should clarify this issue. It is noteworthy that we have observed a low but reproducible decrease of MMP-2 activation upon addition of the SN50 peptide but not the control peptide. Other investigators (42Han Y.P. Tuan T.L., Wu, H. Hughes M. Garner W.L. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 131-139PubMed Google Scholar) have also reported SN50 can block activation of MMP-2, most notably in dermal fibroblasts, and attributed its effect to its ability to block the NF-κB signaling pathway that leads to the induction of MT1-MMP. Whether MT1-MMP is implicated in the activation of MMP-2 in glioma cells is under investigation In conclusion, we showed that PKC-ζ is directly involved in the signaling cascade that controls the transcription of themmp-9 gene via the NF-κB-dependent pathway in the C6 glioma cells. Accumulating evidence indicates that MMP-9 contributes not only to tumor invasion but also to the degradation of the blood-brain barrier, to neurodegenerative processes, and to angiogenesis (43Rosenberg G.A.

Loss-of-function mutations in the human ROMK gene cause Bartter's syndrome with renal Na+ wasting, consistent with the role of this channel in apical K+ recycling in the TAL that is crucial for NaCl reabsorption. However, the mechanism of renal K+ wasting and hypokalemia that develop in individuals with ROMK Bartter's syndrome is not apparent given the proposed loss of the collecting duct SK channel. Thus, we generated a colony of ROMK null mice with ∼25% survival to adulthood that provides a good model for ROMK Bartter's syndrome. The remaining 75% of null mice die in less than 14 days after birth. The surviving ROMK null mice have normal gross renal morphology with no evidence of significant hydronephrosis, whereas non-surviving null mice exhibit marked hydronephrosis. ROMK protein expression was absent in TAL and CCD from null mice but exhibited normal abundance and localization in wild-type littermates. ROMK null mice were polyuric and natriuretic with an elevated hematocrit consistent with mild extracellular volume depletion. SK channel activity in TAL and CCD was assessed by patch clamp analysis in ROMK wild-type ROMK(+/+), heterozygous ROMK(+/−), and null ROMK(−/−) mice. In 313 patches with successful seals from the three ROMK genotypes, SK channel activity in ROMK (+/+ and +/−) exhibited normal single channel kinetics. The expression frequencies are as follows: 67 (TAL) and 58% (CCD) in ROMK(+/+); about half that of the wild-type in ROMK(+/−), being 38 (TAL) and 25% (CCD); absent in both TAL or CCD in ROMK(−/−) between 2 and 5 weeks in 15 mice (61 and 66 patches, respectively). The absence of SK channel activity in ROMK null mice demonstrates that ROMK is essential for functional expression of SK channels in both TAL and CCD. Despite loss of ROMK expression, the normokalemic null mice exhibited significantly increased kaliuresis, indicating alternative mechanisms for K+absorption/secretion in the nephron.

Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: F817-F833Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the TAL, the SK channel mediates K+ recycling across the apical membrane that is essential for maintaining the supply of luminal K+ for Na-K-2Cl cotransport (2Greger R. Schlatter E.

However, the characteristic hypokalemia in individuals with ROMK Bartter's is difficult to explain on the basis of loss of ROMK function if this channel encodes the SK channel in CCD. In the present study, we assessed the expression of SK channel by patch clamping in TAL and CCD from ROMK null mice. Given the low survival and hydronephrosis of the original ROMK null mice (69Lorenz J.N. Baird N.R. Judd L.M. Noonan W.T. Andringa A. Doetschman T. Manning P.A. Liu L.H. Miller M.L. Shull G.E. J.

These mice exhibited characteristics of Bartter's syndrome including polyuria, Na+ and K+ wasting. Kidney morphology in the ROMK null mice was normal without finding of hydronephrosis, and ROMK protein expression in TAL and CCD was absent. K+ channel activity was absent in apical membranes from either TAL or CCD from ROMK(−/−) mice, whereas wild-type ROMK(+/+) littermates exhibited normal SK activity. The percent of successful patches in TAL or CCD showing SK channel activity in heterozygous ROMK(+/−) mice was ∼50% of that in ROMK(+/+) littermates. These results demonstrate that ROMK encodes the SK channel in apical membranes of both TAL and CCD principal cells. The generation of the ROMK null mice is described in the accompanying article (69Lorenz J.N. Baird N.R. Judd L.M. Noonan W.T. Andringa A. Doetschman T. Manning P.A. Liu L.H. Miller M.L. Shull G.E. J.

Initially, surviving null ROMK(−/−) males were bred with heterozygous females to enhance survival. ROMK(+/−) heterozygous breeding pairs from these survivors were intercrossed for several generations to develop a new colony. All mice were maintained on standard mouse chow and tap water. Pups were genotyped 7 days after birth by PCR using DNA extracted from tail biopsies. The wild-type gene was amplified using a forward primer (5′-GTGACAGAACAGTGTGCC-3′) corresponding to codons 149–154 and a reverse primer (5′-CTCCTTCAGGTGTGATGG-3′) corresponding to anticodons 240–234. The mutant gene was amplified using the reverse primer from the ROMK gene and a primer (5′-CTGACTAGGGGAGGAGTAGAAGG-3′) complementary to sequences in the 5′-untranslated region of theneo gene. ROMK(+/+), ROMK(+/−), and ROMK(−/−) mice were anesthetized by pentobarbital (0.1 mg/g body wt) and perfused via the aorta with Hanks' solution, with drainage from the inferior vena, until the kidneys blanched. The mice were perfusion-fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde, 75 mmlysine, 10 mm sodium periodate (PLP). The kidneys were removed and transferred into 10% sucrose buffer overnight before cutting. Frozen sections (1 or 10 μm) were processed for immunofluorescence histochemistry with antibody labeling (43Xu J. Hall A.E. Peterson L.N. Bienkowski M.J. Essalu T.E. Hebert S.C. Am. J.

Two mice from same litter of similar genotype were housed in a single cage to ensure normal eating and drinking behavior. After 2 days of training in the cage, 24-h food and water intake and urine output were measured and recorded. All data represent the average of three 24-h values. Urinary Na+ and K+ concentrations were measured by a flame photometer, and daily Na+ and K+ excretion was calculated as mEq/24 h. Na+, Cl−, and K+ concentrations were also measured in plasma from retro-orbital bleeds by a Corning Blood Gas analyzer (46Wang T. Yang C.L. Abbiati T. Schultheis P.J. Shull G.E. Giebisch G. Aronson P.S. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: F298-F302Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Blood gas analysis was performed on freshly drawn blood and measured by a Corning Blood Gas Analyzer. Experiments were performed in mice between 2 and 5 weeks after birth. The left kidney was removed following anesthesia by intraperitoneal injection of pentobarbital sodium (0.1 mg/g body wt). 4–5 TAL and CCD tubules were microdissected from each mouse for apical patch clamping as described previously (47Lu M. MacGregor G.G. Wang W. Giebisch G. J. Gen. Physiol. 2000; 116: 299-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). All experiments were carried out at room temperature (22–24 °C). Bath and tubule dissection solutions contained (mm) 140 NaCl, 5 KCl, 1.8 MgCl2, 1.8 CaCl2, and 10 HEPES (pH 7.4 adjusted with NaOH). For the inside-out patch configuration, the bath solution was the same as the dissection solution except for 0.8 MgCl2, 0 CaCl2, 1 EGTA. 0.5 mmMgATP (Sigma) was added to the bath to keep channels from running down. The pipette solution contained (mm) 140 KCl, 1.8 MgCl2 and 10 HEPES (pH 7.4 adjusted with KOH). Single channel activity was recorded in both cell-attached and inside-out configurations as reported previously (47Lu M. MacGregor G.G. Wang W. Giebisch G. J. Gen. Physiol. 2000; 116: 299-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). For analysis, current recordings were from inside-out patches with a pipette holding potential (−V) of −40 mV. Channel open time (T o), closed time (T c), and open probability (P o) were calculated over 4 s with a filter frequency of 250 Hz using pCLAMP software, version 6.0.5 of Fetchan and pSTAT (Anxon Instrument, Inc.). Channel conductance was calculated from current-voltage (I-V) curves between −40 and −80 mV. Data are presented as means ± S.E. Two-way Student's t test was used to compare control and experimental groups. The difference between the mean values of ROMK(+/+) and ROMK(−/−) groups was considered significant atp < 0.05. Companion studies by Lorenz et al. (69Lorenz J.N. Baird N.R. Judd L.M. Noonan W.T. Andringa A. Doetschman T. Manning P.A. Liu L.H. Miller M.L. Shull G.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 37871-37880Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar) showed that the mortality of ROMK-deficient mice was very high with less than 5% survival to weaning at 21 days. These ROMK(−/−) mice had renal insufficiency with profound hydronephrosis. We developed a colony with increased survival by selectively crossing surviving ROMK null mice with heterozygotes from litters in which there were surviving null mutants. As shown in Fig. 1, 25% of ROMK(−/−) mice survived to adulthood, and the remaining mice died before 14 days. There was no difference in survival rate between the wild-type ROMK(+/+) and heterozygous ROMK(+/−) mice. Fig. 2 shows the gross morphology of kidneys obtained from wild-type ROMK(+/+), heterozygous (ROMK(+/−), and null (ROMK(−/−) mice that either survived or did non-survive beyond 14 days. In non-surviving ROMK(−/−) mice, the size of the kidney was about one-third of normal (Fig. 2, E andF); the renal cortex was considerably thinner than in wild-type (Fig. 2, A and B) or heterozygous (Fig.2, C and D) mice, and the renal pelvis surrounding the renal papilla and the pelvic fornices at the level of the outer medulla were extensively dilated. These changes indicated that significant hydronephrosis was present in the non-surviving null mice, but this was still somewhat milder than that seen in the original ROMK-deficient mice (69Lorenz J.N. Baird N.R. Judd L.M. Noonan W.T. Andringa A. Doetschman T. Manning P.A. Liu L.H. Miller M.L. Shull G.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 37871-37880Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). In contrast, the surviving null mice did not have significant hydronephrosis, and the kidneys were only slightly smaller than those from wild-type (Fig. 2, A andB) or heterozygous (Fig. 2, C and D) mice. We cannot exclude the possibly that mild hydronephrosis may be present in a small number of our ROMK(−/−) mice given the limited number of animals examined in this study. There were no gross histological difference among the ROMK(+/+), ROMK(+/−) and surviving ROMK(−/−) mice (Fig. 2). To confirm the absence of ROMK expression in kidney in our ROMK(−/−) genotype, we examined the expression and localization of ROMK in wild-type and null mouse kidneys by immunofluorescence using a polyclonal rabbit anti-rat antibody directed against a COOH-terminal peptide (45Ecelbarger C.A. Kim G.H. Knepper M.A. Liu J. Tate M. Welling P.A. Wade J.B. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2001; 12: 10-18Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Fig. 3 shows paired phase and immunofluorescence images of ROMK staining in 1-μm cryosections of kidney cortex from ROMK(+/+) and ROMK(−/−) mice. ROMK was clearly expressed at apical borders of the TAL and CCD segments in cortical medullary rays. In contrast, there was no immunostaining of ROMK in null mice in either the TAL or the collecting duct, confirming the ROMK(−/−) genotype generated as described in the accompanying article (69Lorenz J.N. Baird N.R. Judd L.M. Noonan W.T. Andringa A. Doetschman T. Manning P.A. Liu L.H. Miller M.L. Shull G.E. J. Biol.

TableI shows the plasma Na+, Cl−, and K+ concentrations measured in adult ROMK(+/+) and ROMK(−/−) mice. Plasma Na+, Cl−, and K+ in ROMK null mice were within the physiological range and similar to wild-type values. TableII shows the acid-base status in ROMK wild-type, heterozygous, and knockout mice from ∼2-week-old pups and adult mice. The 2-week-old animals included both surviving and non-surviving pups. A slight metabolic acidosis was seen in the ROMK null pups compared with either ROMK(+/+) of ROMK(+/−) mice. However, no significant abnormality in acid-base status was observed in adult ROMK null mice.Table IPlasma Na+, K+, CI− and hematocrit in ROMK wild-type and knockout miceGenotypenPNaPKPCIHCTmEq/litermEq/litermEq/liter%ROMK(+/+)15153.2 ± 1.84.9 ± 0.1108.0 ± 1.445.6 ± 1.1ROMK(−/−)17149.0 ± 2.04.7 ± 0.1102.0 ± 1.252.7 ± 1.11-aSignificantly different from control (p < 0.05).Values are means ± S.E. from each group. n, number of animals.

The results of metabolic studies, shown in TablesIII and IV, demonstrate that the 24-h urine volumes and urinary Na+ and K+ excretion rates were significantly higher in ROMK null mice compared with wild-type mice. The polyuria in the ROMK(−/−) mice was associated with a significant reduction in urine osmolality compared with the ROMK(+/+) mice (Table III). Daily water and food intake were also increased in the ROMK(−/−) mice. The hematocrit was significantly higher in ROMK null mice (Table I) suggesting mild hypovolemia consistent with the polyuria and natriuresis. The magnitude of the increase in hematocrit in the ROMK(−/−) mice was far less than seen in the NKCC2(−/−) knockout reported previously by Takahashiet al. (48Takahashi N. Chernavvsky D.R. Gomez R.A.

Thus, the ROMK(−/−) mice exhibited polyuria and salt wasting, consistent with a Bartter's type TAL tubulopathy.Table IIIUrine volume, ENa, EK, and osmolality in ROMK knock-out and wild-type miceGenotypenUVENaEKOsmolalityml/24 hmEq/24 hmmol/kgROMK(+/+)221.18 ± 0.12188.9 ± 30.1173.0 ± 24.11986.7 ± 35.2ROMK(−/−)215.61 ± 0.363-aSignificantly different from control (p < 0.05).297.9 ± 26.33-aSignificantly different from control (p < 0.05).289.4 ± 11.83-aSignificantly different from control (p < 0.05).678.9 ± 35.33-aSignificantly different from control (p < 0.05).Values are means ± S.E. from each group. n, number of animals.

Fig. 4,A and C, shows representative single SK channel recordings in wild-type TAL and CCD using the inside-out configuration at different pipette holding voltages. With 140 mm KCl in the pipette and 140 mm NaCl + 5 mm KCl in bath, I-V plots showed slightly inward-rectified currents (Fig. 4,B and D). Channel conductance (G= ∼31 pS) was calculated from the I-V curve between −40 and −80 mV in the inside-out configuration. There were no differences in the channel conductance between SK channels in the TAL or CCD obtained from wild-type or heterozygous mice. SK channels had a high open probability (P o = 0.88∼0.89) in both TAL and CCD with one open time and one closed time in inside-out configuration at a pipette holding potential (−V) of −40 mV.

https://openalex.org/W2018193989,"Lichen symbioses represent a major way of life among the Fungi. Almost one-fifth of all known fungal species are lichenized, and about 1500 species of lichens contain cyanobacterial photobionts, most of which belong to the genus Nostoc . Despite extensive studies, many basic aspects of their biology remain poorly known, especially cyanobiont diversity and specificity ([1][1]).

Cyanolichen specimens were collected from northern Europe, western North America, and central China. Epiphytic lichen communities in two old-growth forests in central Finland were studied in detail (tables S1 and S2). Lichens were identified, and free-living cyanobacteria were cultured from substrate samples. The small subunit (16 S ) of the ribosomal gene repeat and the tRNALeu (UAA) intron were sequenced from cyanobacterial DNA. The 16 S rDNA sequences were used to resolve phylogenetic relationships, and the tRNALeu intron sequences were used for identifying Nostoc strains ([2][2]).

Cyanobacterial 16 S rDNA sequences were obtained from 16 species of cyanolichens. Additional sequences were acquired from cyanobacterial cultures and GenBank (table S1). A phylogenetic analysis of these sequences resulted in a consensus tree in which all Nostoc formed a monophyletic group with 100% support ([Fig. 1][3]). The Nostoc clade was divided into two subgroups; the first only included cyanobionts of epiphytic lichen species ( Nephroma guild). Further subdivisions within this group did not correlate with the geographical origin or generic identity of the lichen specimens. The second subgroup ( Peltigera guild) included cyanobionts of terrestrial lichens, free-living Nostoc strains, and a symbiotic Nostoc from the roots of a cycad ([Fig. 1][3]).

![Figure 1][4] 

Figure 1 
A strict consensus tree showing phylogenetic relationships among symbiotic and free-living cyanobacteria based on 16 S rDNA sequence data (table S1). Bootstrap support >50% is shown at nodes. All Nostoc strains form a monophyletic group. The cyanobionts of the Nephroma guild form a well-supported subgroup within the Nostoc clade. The cyanobionts of the Peltigera guild group together with free-living Nostoc strains. These groupings are congruent with data from tRNALeu (UAA) intron sequences (table S2).



Most epiphytic cyanolichens in central Finland contained similar tRNALeu intron genotypes (table S2). One intron genotype was found from all six sample plots, and it was shared extensively by four different species of Nephroma and Parmeliella . Two other intron genotypes differed from the most frequent intron genotype by only one base change each; these genotypes were found from several epiphytic lichens on different sample plots. These and a fourth Finnish intron genotype shared the same repeat motif in their P6b element ([3][5]). Four North American and two Chinese intron genotypes also had this repeat motif. As in Finland, all these sequences were obtained from epiphytic cyanolichens (table S2).

A different set of tRNALeu intron genotypes was obtained from Peltigera thalli and cultured Nostoc strains (table S2). These sequences had a different repeat motif in the P6b element and could not be readily aligned with the sequences from epiphytic cyanolichens ([3][5]). Species of Peltigera are predominately terricolous, and when growing epiphytically, they are usually confined to mossy basal trunks. Two intron genotypes were obtained by culturing thallus fragments of Lobaria pulmonaria . Two North American and two Chinese intron genotypes had the same P6b repeat motif as Finnish Peltigera cyanobionts. As in Finland, these sequences were amplified from different species of Peltigera and Lobaria (table S2).

Although lichen mycobionts are selective in their choice of Nostoc symbionts, several fungi may often share identical cyanobiont strains ([1][1], [3][5], [4][6]). Our results demonstrate the full extent of this phenomenon and indicate that cyanolichens express their Nostoc specificity on a community scale. Many cyanolichens associated with old-growth forests depend on a specific group of Nostoc strains that have not been found in other types of cyanolichens. These epiphytes exploit a common pool of cyanobacteria and form a horizontally linked system, the Nephroma guild. Conversely, many terrestrial cyanolichens share a different group of related Nostoc strains, thus forming the Peltigera guild. The guild membership of Finnish Lobaria pulmonaria specimens remained unclear because of inherent uncertainties in identifying symbiotic Nostoc strains by using cultures. North American L. pulmonaria specimens belonged to the Nephroma guild ([Fig. 1][3]).

The dispersal ecology of cyanolichen guilds may center around “core species,” such as N. parile and P. triptophylla , that produce massive amounts of symbiotic diaspores. “Fringe species,” such as N. bellum and N. resupinatum , produce only fungal spores and may largely depend on the core species for the dispersal of appropriate cyanobionts. Only a small proportion of symbiotic propagules can develop into mature lichen thalli. Many diaspores land on suboptimal substrates, eventually disintegrate, and release their cyanobionts. These cyanobionts may be salvaged by the mycobionts of fringe species. Core species may also benefit from this activity, as their cyanobionts are deposited into other guild members rather than being completely lost. Some of the cyanobionts can potentially be reclaimed because, without the ability to produce symbiotic diaspores, fringe species cannot “grab the cyanobionts and run.” These phenomena may help to explain why the existence of competition is often difficult to demonstrate in lichen communities ([5][7]).

In addition to the two cyanolichen guilds discussed here, we have preliminarily identified several other cyanolichen guilds. Similar systems may also operate among green algal lichens and other symbiotic systems, such as corals.

Synthetic NPW23 and NPW30 activated and bound to both GPR7 and GPR8 at similar effective doses.

In addition, these studies have provided opportunities to discover innovative drugs that exert their pharmacological effects by interacting with an identified receptor as an agonist or antagonist (12Takekawa S. Asami A. Ishihara Y. Terauchi J. Kato K. Shimomura Y. Mori M. Murakoshi H. Kato K. Suzuki N. Nishimura O. Fujino M. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 2002; 438: 129-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). GPR7 and GPR8, for which the ligands have not been identified, are structurally related orphan GPCRs. Two genes for GPR7 and GPR8 were originally isolated from human genomic DNA by O'Dowd et al.(13O'Dowd B.F. Scheideler M.A. Nguyen T. Cheng R. Rasmussen J.S. Marchese A. Zastawny R. Heng H.H. Tsui L.C. Shi X. Asa S. Puy L. George S.R. Genomics. 1995; 28: 84-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Human GPR7 highly resembles human GPR8, with an amino acid identity of 64%. Among various families of GPCRs, GPR7 and GPR8 share high similarity to the opioid and somatostatin receptor families. In mammalian brain, gene expression of GPR7 and GPR8 was detected by Northern blot and in situ hybridization analyses (13O'Dowd B.F. Scheideler M.A. Nguyen T. Cheng R. Rasmussen J.S. Marchese A. Zastawny R. Heng H.H. Tsui L.C. Shi X. Asa S. Puy L. George S.R. Genomics. 1995; 28: 84-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Especially in rat brain, GPR7 mRNA was detected in regions of the cortex, hippocampus, and hypothalamus (14Lee D.K. Nguyen T. Porter C.A. Cheng R. George S.R. O'Dowd B.F. Mol. Brain Res. 1999; 71: 96-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Profiles of GPR7 and GPR8 expressed mainly in brain suggest that the endogenous ligands for the two receptors have several functions in the central nervous system. In this study, we report the purification, cloning, and characterization of neuropeptide W (NPW). We attempted to purify the agonist peptide for GPR8. The cDNA encoding the agonist peptide for GPR8 demonstrates the existence of neuropeptide W-23 (NPW23) and neuropeptide W-30 (NPW30), which exhibit no meaningful similarity to any known peptides. With the functional and binding characterization of NPW for GPR7 and GPR8, we show that NPW is the endogenous ligand for both of these receptors. In addition, we describe the in vivo effects of NPW on feeding behavior and hormone release. The coding region of human GPR7 was cloned from human genomic DNA and human brain cDNA, and that of human GPR8 was cloned from human brain cDNA by PCR (13O'Dowd B.F. Scheideler M.A. Nguyen T. Cheng R. Rasmussen J.S. Marchese A. Zastawny R. Heng H.H. Tsui L.C. Shi X. Asa S. Puy L. George S.R. Genomics. 1995; 28: 84-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). An expression vector was constructed by ligation of the receptor gene to pAKKO-111H containingdhfr as a selection maker (15Mori M. Sugo T. Abe M. Shimomura Y. Kurihara M. Kitada C. Kikuchi K. Shintani Y. Kurokawa T. Onda H. Nishimura O. Fujino M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 265: 123-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). CHOdhfr− cells were transfected with the expression vector. Stable CHO cell lines expressing human GPR7 (CHO-GPR7 cells) and human GPR8 (CHO-GPR8 cells) were selected under conditions wherein the growth medium lacked nucleotides. The inhibitory activity of the test samples for cAMP accumulation was measured as described (16Shimomura Y. Mori M. Sugo T. Ishibashi Y. Abe M. Kurokawa T. Onda H. Nishimura O. Sumino Y. Fujino M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 261: 622-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). CHO-GPR7 or CHO-GPR8 cells were plated on 24-well plates at 5 × 104 cells/well and cultured for 2 days. The cells were washed three times with 0.5 ml of assay buffer (Hanks' buffered salt solution (pH 7.4), 0.2 mm 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (Wako Bioproducts), 0.05% bovine serum albumin, and 20 mmHEPES) and cultured in assay buffer for 30 min. After washing the cells three times with 0.5 ml of assay buffer, a test sample in 0.5 ml of assay buffer supplemented with 1 μm forskolin (Wako Bioproducts) was added to the cells, and the cells were incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. cAMP synthesis in the cells was stopped by addition of 0.1 ml of 20% perchloric acid, and intracellular cAMP was extracted on ice for 1 h. The amount of extracted cAMP was measured using an enzyme-linked immunoassay kit (AmershamBiosciences). The [35S]GTPγS binding assay was performed essentially as described (12Takekawa S. Asami A. Ishihara Y. Terauchi J. Kato K. Shimomura Y. Mori M. Murakoshi H. Kato K. Suzuki N. Nishimura O. Fujino M. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 2002; 438: 129-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. The human GPR8 membrane fractions suspended in 200 μl of [35S]GTPγS assay buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 0.1% bovine serum albumin, 5 mm MgCl2, 150 mm NaCl, and 1 μm GDP) were mixed with a test sample, followed by addition of [35S]GTPγS (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) at a final concentration of 0.5 nm. The mixture was incubated at 25 °C for 60 min and then filtered onto a Whatman GF/F glass filter. After washing three times with 1.5 ml of washing buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 0.1% bovine serum albumin, 5 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm EDTA), the glass filters were dried at 37 °C for 1 h. The radioactivities retained in the membranes were counted with a scintillation counter. Approximately 500 g of fresh porcine hypothalamus was boiled for 10 min in water and homogenized using a Polytron homogenizer in 2 liters of 1.0m acetic acid. The homogenate was centrifuged, and then the supernatant was subjected to acetone precipitation at a final acetone concentration of 66%. After removal of the precipitates, the supernatant was evaporated and extracted with diethyl ether. The resultant solution was applied to a column packed with YMCgel ODS-AM 120-S50 (YMC). The peptide fraction was eluted with 60% acetonitrile (CH3CN) in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, and the eluate was lyophilized. The agonist peptide for GPR8 was purified from the lyophilized materials by successive HPLC using a TSKgel ODS-80TM column (21.5 × 240 mm; 10–60% CH3CN gradient in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid for 80 min at 5.0 ml/min; Tosoh), a TSKgel SP-5PW column (20 × 150 mm; 10–2000 mm ammonium formate (HCOONH4) gradient in 10% CH3CN for 40 min at 5.0 ml/min; Tosoh), a Develosil CN-UG-5 column (4.6 × 250 mm; 21–26% CH3CN gradient in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid for 20 min at 1.0 ml/min; Nomura Chemical), and a Wakosil-II 3C18HG column (2.0 × 150 mm; 22.5–32.5% CH3CN gradient in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid for 40 min at 0.2 ml/min; Wako Bioproducts) combined with the [35S]GTPγS binding assay. Finally, an active fraction with a single peak at both 220 and 280 nm was collected manually by HPLC using the Wakosil-II 3C18HG column. The amino acid sequence of the purified peptide was analyzed with a protein sequencer (Procise 491cLC, Applied Biosystems Inc.). A BLAST search was performed using the amino acid sequence of the purified peptide as a query against the DDBJ/GenBankTM/EBI Data Bank. A human genomic DNA sequence (DDBJ/GenBankTM/EBI accession number AC0050606) contained a partial nucleotide sequence of which the translated amino acid sequence was similar to the purified peptide. On the basis of this DNA sequence, the cDNA encoding prepro-NPW was obtained from the porcine spinal cord cDNA library constructed with a Marathon cDNA amplification kit (CLONTECH) using 5′- and 3′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends and PCR to clone full-length cDNA. The cDNA encoding human prepro-NPW was obtained from the human hypothalamus Marathon Ready cDNA library (CLONTECH), and the cDNA encoding rat prepro-NPW was obtained from the rat brain Marathon Ready cDNA library (CLONTECH) following the same strategies used to clone porcine prepro-NPW cDNA. The PCR primers for cloning the porcine, human, and rat full-length cDNAs were as follows: porcine, 5′-TTCCCGACACCCCTGCGCCCAGAC-3′ (forward) and 5′-GGGCTGGCGAAGGCGGTTCCCTGC-3′ (reverse); human, 5′-AGCGGTACTGAGGGGGCGGAACGA-3′ (forward) and 5′-GGGTCTATGAGCGGCTCCTGGAAG-3′ (reverse); and rat, 5′-GGGGCGGGGCCATTGAGAAGC-3′ (forward) and 5′-TGACCAGACAACGAGACCTGA-3′ (reverse). The porcine, human, and rat prepro-NPW cDNA clones were sequenced on both strands using an ABI PRISM 377 DNA sequencer (Applied Biosystems Inc.). Human NPW23 and NPW30 and porcine NPW23 and NPW30 were chemically synthesized using an ABI 433A peptide synthesizer (Applied Biosystems Inc.) following Fmoc (N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl) strategy. After deblocking all the protecting groups by treatment with mixture of trifluoroacetic acid/thioanisole/m-cresol/triisopropylsilane/1,2-ethanedithiol (85:5:5:2.5:2.5), the peptides were purified by reverse-phase HPLC (RP-HPLC). The extracts of porcine hypothalamus were fractionated by HPLC using the TSKgel ODS-80TM column (10–60% CH3CN gradient in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid for 80 min at 5.0 ml/min) as described above for the purification of NPW. Active fractions obtained by ODS-HPLC were further fractionated by HPLC using a Develosil ODS-UG-5 column (4.6 × 250 mm; 25–40% CH3CN gradient in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid for 30 min at 1.0 ml/min; Nomura Chemical), and the eluates were collected every 1 min. The agonist activity of each fraction for GPR8 was measured by the [35S]GTPγS binding assay. Synthetic porcine NPW23 and NPW30 were analyzed by HPLC using the Develosil ODS-UG-5 column (25–40% CH3CN gradient in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid for 30 min at 1.0 ml/min). We constructed an expression vector by ligation of PCR-amplified human prepro-NPW cDNA covering the DNA region from the 5′ to 3′ in-frame stop codons to mammalian expression vector pCR3.1 (Invitrogen). The PCR primers for cloning the human prepro-NPW cDNA were 5′-AGCGGTACTGAGGGGGCGGAACGA-3′ (forward) and 5′-AACTAGTCGGCCACTCCTCCTGGGTCAG-3′ (reverse). COS-7 cells were transfected with the expression vector and cultured for 2 days. The conditioned medium was concentrated using a Waters Sep-Pak Plus C18 cartridge. The agonist peptide for GPR8 was purified from the concentrated medium by successive HPLC using a TSKgel CM-2SW column (4.6 × 250 mm; 10–2000 mmHCOONH4 gradient in 10% CH3CN for 60 min at 1.0 ml/min; Tosoh), a TSKgel ODS-80TsQA column (4.6 × 250 mm; 25–45% CH3CN gradient in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid for 60 min at 1.0 ml/min; Tosoh), and a SymmetryShield RP18 column (2.1 × 150 mm; 15–35% CH3CN gradient in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid for 60 min at 0.2 ml/min; Waters Associates) combined with the cAMP accumulation inhibition assay. Finally, an active fraction with a single peak at 220 nm was collected manually by HPLC using the SymmetryShield RP18 column. The amino acid sequence of the purified peptide was analyzed with the Procise 491cLC protein sequencer. Electrospray ionization mass spectra of the purified peptide were recorded on an LCQ duo ion-trap mass spectrometer (ThermoFinnigan) equipped with a nanospray ion source (MDS Protana). CHO-GPR7 and CHO-GPR8 cells were cultured in 24-well plates for 24 h and then treated with or without pertussis toxin (List Biological Laboratories, Inc.) at a concentration of 100 ng/ml for 24 h. After washing these cells, the inhibitory effect of human NPW23 (1 nm) on cAMP accumulation induced by forskolin (1 μm) was analyzed. Human NPW23 was labeled by lactoperoxidase oxidation in the presence of Na125I (PerkinElmer Life Sciences), and the monoiodinated peptide labeled at Tyr10 was purified by RP-HPLC. The specific activity of purified 125I-labeled human NPW23 was ∼9.5 × 1016 Bq/mol when a fresh batch of Na125I was used for labeling. Membrane preparation and receptor binding assay were performed essentially as described (12Takekawa S. Asami A. Ishihara Y. Terauchi J. Kato K. Shimomura Y. Mori M. Murakoshi H. Kato K. Suzuki N. Nishimura O. Fujino M. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 2002; 438: 129-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. CHO-GPR7 or CHO-GPR8 membrane fractions suspended in 200 μl of receptor binding assay buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 0.1% bovine serum albumin, 0.05% CHAPS, 5 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.1 μg/ml pepstatin, 20 μg/ml leupeptin, and 4 μg/ml E-64) were mixed with125I-labeled human NPW23. The mixture was incubated at 25 °C for 75 min and then filtered onto a Whatman GF/F glass filter. After washing three times with 1.5 ml of binding buffer, the glass filters were dried at 37 °C for 1 h. Nonspecific binding was determined by the binding assay in the presence of unlabeled human NPW23 at 1 μm. The radioactivities retained on the glass filters were counted with a γ-counter. Male Wistar rats (8–9 weeks old) were maintained under controlled temperature (25 °C) and lighting (light on from 7:30 to 19:30). Food (standard chow pellets) and water were available ad libitum. A stainless-steel guide cannula (AG-8, EICOM, Kyoto, Japan) was inserted into the lateral ventricle under sodium pentobarbital anesthesia. After the rats had been housed for 1 week in individual cages, 10 μl of phosphate-buffered saline with or without human NPW23 was injected at a flow rate of 5 μl/min into the lateral ventricle through a microinjection cannula that was inserted into the guide cannula. All injections started at 15:00, and food intake was measured at 30, 60, and 120 min. Male Wistar rats (8–9 weeks old) were maintained under controlled temperature (25 °C) and lighting (light on from 7:30 to 19:30). Food (standard chow pellets) and water were available ad libitum. A stainless-steel guide cannula (AG-12, EICOM) was inserted into the third ventricle under sodium pentobarbital anesthesia. The cannula-implanted rats were housed in individual cages and kept for 1 week. One day before the experiments, the cannula-implanted rats were fitted with a catheter in the right jugular vein. The following day, 10 μl of phosphate-buffered saline with or without human NPW23 was injected at a flow rate of 5 μl/min into the third ventricle through a microinjection cannula that was inserted into the guide cannula. An intracerebroventricular injection was given between 13:00 and 15:00. After the intracerebroventricular injection of the peptide, blood samples were collected from the catheter at 5, 10, 20, 30, and 60 min. The concentration of prolactin in the plasma samples was then determined using a radioimmunoassay kit (Amersham Biosciences). We purified the agonist peptide for GPR8 from porcine hypothalamus using CHO-GPR8 cells, which is a so-called “reverse pharmacology” technique (17Civelli O. Nothacker H.P. Saito Y. Wang Z. Lin S.H. Reinscheid R.K. Trends Neurosci. 2001; 24: 230-237Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). In the assay of intracellular signal changes in CHO-GPR8 cells induced by the test samples, including various kinds of tissue extract and known bioactive substances, RP-HPLC fractions of porcine hypothalamus extracts showed an inhibitory effect on cAMP accumulation induced by forskolin. Treatment of the RP-HPLC fractions with proteinases that diminished the agonist activity suggested that a peptide ligand for GPR8 was present in the extracts of porcine hypothalamus. Because the same RP-HPLC fractions also stimulated [35S]GTPγS binding to the membranes of CHO-GPR8 cells, the extracts of porcine hypothalamus were subjected to purification of the agonist peptide for GPR8 by successive chromatography in the [35S]GTPγS binding assay. The process yielded 3 pmol of the purified agonist peptide for GPR8 from 500 g of porcine hypothalamus (Fig.1, A and B). The N-terminal amino acid sequence of the purified peptide was determined to be WYKHTASPRYHTVGRAAXLL (X, not identified) using the protein sequencer. We attempted to isolate the cDNA encoding this peptide to reveal its whole amino acid sequence. We cloned a cDNA from a porcine spinal cord by PCR using DNA sequence information obtained by both 5′- and 3′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends. Although two ATG codons present in the 5′-end region of the 565-bp cDNA precede an in-frame stop codon (DDBJ/GenBankTM/EBI accession number AB084277), the second ATG codon conforms more to the rules of Kozak (18Kozak M. Mamm. Genome. 1996; 7: 563-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (757) Google Scholar). The open reading frame starting at this second ATG codon encodes the porcine prepropolypeptide of 152 residues (Fig. 1 C). The PSORT II algorithm based on the method of von Heijne (20von Heijne G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1986; 14: 4683-4690Crossref PubMed Scopus (3693) Google Scholar) indicated that a signal peptide cleavage site of this polypeptide resides between Ala32 and Trp33 (19Nakai K. Horton P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 34-36Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1831) Google Scholar, 20von Heijne G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1986; 14: 4683-4690Crossref PubMed Scopus (3693) Google Scholar). It is predicted that two mature peptides of 23 and 30 residues will be generated from the prepropolypeptide by signal peptide cleavage and proteolytic processing at two pairs of basic amino acid residues, Arg56-Arg57 and Arg63-Arg64, respectively (21Douglass J. Civelli O. Herbert E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1984; 53: 665-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). The mature peptide sequence of 23 residues starts at Trp33 and ends at Leu55, whereas that of 30 residues starts at Trp33 and ends at Trp62. The amino acid sequence of the 23-residue peptide is identical to that of the N-terminal 23 residues in the 30-residue peptide. Because both the first and last amino acids of the 30-residue peptide are Trp, we designated the 30-residue peptide as neuropeptide W-30 and then designated the 23-residue peptide as neuropeptide W-23. To clarify molecular species showing agonist activities for GPR8, we measured the [35S]GTPγS binding activities of the porcine hypothalamus peptide fractions for GPR8 and compared the elution times of the [35S]GTPγS binding activities with those of synthetic peptides of porcine NPW23 and NPW30 under the same HPLC conditions. The synthetic peptide of porcine NPW23 eluted at 24.5 min, and that of porcine NPW30 eluted at 26.5 min (Fig.2 A). The [35S]GTPγS binding activities of the porcine hypothalamus peptide fractions for GPR8 were recovered mainly in fractions 25 (24–25 min) and 27 (26–27 min) with almost the same activity (Fig. 2 B), indicating that fractions 25 and 27 contained porcine NPW23 and NPW30, respectively. These results demonstrate that porcine NPW23 and NPW30 existing in porcine hypothalamus activate GPR8. We isolated human prepro-NPW cDNA (DDBJ/GenBankTM/EBI accession numberAB084276) lacking an AUG start codon from human hypothalamus and examined whether human NPW with agonist activity for GPR8 is generated from this cDNA. As shown in Fig. 3, the open reading frame of the cDNA represents the amino acid sequences of the 23- and 30-residue peptides, which are flanked by a signal peptide cleavage site and a pair of basic amino acid residues and which resemble porcine NPW23 and NPW30, respectively. Although an AUG start codon is not present near the 5′-end of the cDNA, several potential non-AUG start codons lie within the region (22Mehdi H. Ono E. Gupta K.C. Gene (Amst.). 1990; 91: 173-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 23Peabody D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 5031-5035Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To ensure that the agonist peptide for GPR8 is synthesized from this human cDNA, we analyzed peptides secreted from COS-7 cells transfected with an expression vector containing this human cDNA. The supernatant of COS-7 cells transfected with this vector showed an inhibitory effect on forskolin-induced cAMP accumulation specifically in CHO-GPR8 cells. From 900 ml of the supernatant, 150 pmol of the agonist peptide for GPR8 was purified to homogeneity (Fig. 4,A and B). The structure of the purified peptide was determined to be WYKHVASPRYHTVGRAAGLLM (NPW21), lacking 2 amino acid residues at the C terminus compared with the predicted human NPW23 sequence. In this expression system, translation of the prepropolypeptide and signal peptide cleavage proceeded as expected, but the proteolytic processing at a pair of dibasic amino acid residues failed to proceed accurately. These results indicate that the agonist peptide for GPR8 is generated through intracellular processing of the prepropolypeptide initiated from a non-AUG start codon of the human prepro-NPW transcript.Figure 4Expression and purification of human NPW.

Shown is the HPLC profile of the final purification step using a SymmetryShield RP18 column.

The eluate was manually collected, and the activity of each fraction was measured by the cAMP accumulation inhibition assay using CHO-GPR8 cells in the presence of forskolin (1 μm). The activity was recovered as a single peak with an elution time of 105.5 min.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We compared the amino acid sequences of mature NPW of different species. In addition to porcine and human prepro-NPW cDNAs, rat prepro-NPW cDNA (DDBJ/EMBL/GenBankTM accession numberAB084278) was cloned from rat brain. According to the prediction of the mature peptide as used for porcine prepro-NPW, we obtained mature peptide sequences of both 23 and 30 residues from porcine, r"
https://openalex.org/W1988067659,"Leucine-responsive regulatory protein (Lrp) is a global regulatory protein that affects the expression of multiple genes and operons in bacteria. Although the physiological purpose of Lrp-mediated gene regulation remains unclear, it has been suggested that it functions to coordinate cellular metabolism with the nutritional state of the environment. The results of gene expression profiles between otherwise isogenic lrp + andlrp − strains of Escherichia colisupport this suggestion. The newly discovered Lrp-regulated genes reported here are involved either in small molecule or macromolecule synthesis or degradation, or in small molecule transport and environmental stress responses. Although many of these regulatory effects are direct, others are indirect consequences of Lrp-mediated changes in the expression levels of other global regulatory proteins. Because computational methods to analyze and interpret high dimensional DNA microarray data are still an early stage, much of the emphasis of this work is directed toward the development of methods to identify differentially expressed genes with a high level of confidence. In particular, we describe a Bayesian statistical framework for a posterior estimate of the standard deviation of gene measurements based on a limited number of replications. We also describe an algorithm to compute a posterior estimate of differential expression for each gene based on the experiment-wide global false positive and false negative level for a DNA microarray data set. This allows the experimenter to compute posterior probabilities of differential expression for each individual differential gene expression measurement.

During the last 50 years, a great deal of knowledge about the regulation of gene expression in Escherichia coli has been obtained. We now know that the expression of genetic information is regulated at three hierarchical levels: global control of basal level gene expression by chromosome structure, control of regulons and stimulons by global regulatory proteins, and operon-specific controls (1Neidhardt F.C.

At the most general level, the expression of all genes is regulated by DNA supercoiling-dependent mechanisms that affect the topology of the entire chromosome (3Hatfield G.W. Benham C.J. Annu. Rev. Genet. 2002; 36: 175-203Google Scholar). At the next level, large groups of genes are regulated by abundant regulatory proteins with rather degenerate binding site specificity that, in cooperation with operon-specific controls, regulate often-overlapping groups of metabolically related operons, called regulons and stimulons, in response to environmental or metabolic signals. At the most basic level, individual genes or operons are regulated by less abundant proteins that bind in a site-specific manner to one or a few sites to regulate single genes or operons. Isolated examples of each level of control have been described. However, the definition of these hierarchical control levels in a depth sufficient to understand genetic regulatory networks on a global scale, all the way from specific circuits up to the complete regulatory network of the cell, remains to be elucidated (4Ideker T. Galitski T. Hood L. Annu. Rev. Genomics Hum. Genet. 2001; 2: 343-372Google Scholar). Before we can infer and model these regulatory networks, individual components at each hierarchical level must be identified. In other words, a more complete definition of the genes of specific regulons and stimulons must be obtained. It is now possible to obtain much of this information using high-throughput technologies such as DNA microarrays. The purpose of the work presented here is to identify the network of genes that are differentially regulated by the global E. coli regulatory protein, leucine-responsive regulatory protein (Lrp), 1The abbreviations used are: Lrp, leucine-responsive regulatory protein; ATPγS, adenosine 5′-O-(thiotriphosphate); MMLV, Moloney murine leukemia virus; BSA, bovine serum albumin; PPDE, posterior probability for differential expression; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid; dH2O, distilled water; ORF, open reading frame; AD, average difference; PM, perfect match; MM, mismatch. during steady state growth in a glucose supplemented minimal salts medium. Lrp is a DNA-binding protein that has been reported to affect the expression of approximately 55 genes. 2Although the expression levels of approximately 55 genes have been reported to be affected by Lrp, these observations were obtained under a wide variety of environmental and nutritional growth conditions; thus, the expression of some of these genes might not be affected by the presence or absence of Lrp under the growth conditions employed in this study. In most cases, Lrp has been reported to activate operons that encode genes for biosynthetic enzymes and repress operons that encode genes for catabolic enzymes (5Calvo J.M. Matthews R.G. Microbiol. Rev. 1994; 58: 466-490Google Scholar, 6Newman E.B. Lin R.T. D'Ari R. Neidhardt F.C. Curtis R.I. Ingraham J.L. Lin E.C.C. Low K.B. Magasanik B. Reznikoff W.S. Riley M. Schaechter M. Umbarger H.E. 2nd Ed. Escherichia coli and Salmonella Cellular and Molecular Biology. 1. ASM Press, Washington, D. C.1996: 1513-1525Google Scholar). The intermediary metabolite,l-leucine, is required for the binding of Lrp at some of its DNA target sites; however, at other sites l-leucine inhibits DNA binding, and at still other sites it exerts no effect at all. Although the physiological purpose of Lrp-mediated gene regulation remains unclear, it has been suggested that it might function to coordinate cellular metabolism with the nutritional state of the environment by monitoring the levels of free l-leucine in the cell. The experiments reported here were carried out in the absence of exogenous l-leucine. Although many data analysis techniques have been applied to DNA microarray data, this field is still evolving and has not yet reached a level of maturity. Therefore, much of the emphasis of the work reported here is directed toward the assessment of methods to identify differentially expressed genes with a high level of confidence. In particular, we apply a Bayesian statistical framework to derive a regularized estimate of the standard deviation of the level of expression of each gene in each condition based on a limited number of replications, and an algorithm to compute a posterior estimate of differential expression for each gene to estimate the global false positive rate specific for each DNA microarray experiment.

Strain IH-G2490 (ilvPG::lacZYA) was constructed by ligating a 515-bp EcoRI-BamHI DNA fragment containing a 494-bp ilvGMEDA-derivedHinFI fragment (base pair position −245 to +249) into theEcoRI and BamHI sites of thelacZ-truncated pRS551Δ (yielding the reporter plasmid pRSG2490) and integrating this reporter plasmid construct into the bacterial chromosome of the polA-deficient strain, NO3434, as described previously (7Rhee K.Y. Parekh B.S. Hatfield G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26499-26507Google Scholar). An isogenic lrp derivative of strain IH-G2490 was created by generalized P1 transduction of thelrp-35::Tn10 allele into this strain according to the methods of Miller (8Miller J.H. Experiments in Molecular Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1972Google Scholar) to yield strain IH-G2491 (ilvPG::lacZYA,lrp::Tn10). The genes of the chromosomallac operon are transcribed from theilvPG promoter in both strains, which is repressed by the binding of Lrp in the leader-attenuator region upstream of the ilvG translational start site. Cells were grown in 50 ml of MOPS medium (9Neidhardt F.C. Bloch P.L. Smith D.F. J. Bacteriol. 1974; 119: 736-747Google Scholar) containing 0.4% glucose in 250-ml Erlenmeyer flasks at 37 °C as described previously (10Arfin S.M. Long A.D. Ito E.T. Tolleri L. Riehle M.M. Paegle E.S. Hatfield G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29672-29684Google Scholar). Total RNA was isolated from cells at an A 600 of 0.5–0.6. Ten-ml samples of log phase cells were pipetted directly into 10 ml of boiling lysis buffer (1% SDS, 0.1 m NaCl, 8 mm EDTA) and mixed at 100 °C for 1.5 min. These samples were transferred to 125-ml Erlenmeyer flasks, mixed with an equal volume of hot acid phenol (pH 4.3), and shaken vigorously for 6 min at 64 °C. After centrifugation, the aqueous phase was transferred to a fresh Erlenmeyer flask and the hot acid phenol extraction procedure was repeated. The second aqueous phase was extracted with phenol-chloroform-isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1; pH 4.3) at room temperature, and twice with chloroform-isoamyl alcohol (24:1). Total RNA was precipitated with two volumes of ethanol in 0.3 m NaOAc (pH 5.3), washed with 70% ethanol, and redissolved in a 10 mm Tris, 1 mm EDTA solution (pH 8.0). Residual genomic DNA was removed with the DNA-free kit of Ambion Inc. according to the instructions from the manufacturer. The RNA concentration was determined by absorption at 260 nm. In all cases, independent 10-ml samples from three separate cultures were processed in parallel. For random hexamer-primed cDNA synthesis, 20 μg of total RNA and 37.5 ng of random hexamer primers were heated at 70 °C for 3 min and quickly cooled on ice. cDNA synthesis was performed at 42 °C for 3 h in a 60-μl reaction mixture containing: RNA and primer mixture; reverse transcriptase buffer (Roche); 1 mm amounts each of dATP, dGTP, and dTTP; 50 μCi of [α-33P]dCTP; 20 units of ribonuclease inhibitor III; and 4 μl (88 units) of avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase. Labeled cDNA targets were separated from unincorporated nucleotides on Sephadex G-25 Quickspin columns. To enrich the proportion of mRNA in the total RNA preparation, 300 μg of total RNA from IH-G2490 (lrp+) or IH-G2491 (lrp−) was prepared as described above. Each 300-μg total RNA preparation was split into 12 aliquots to increase the efficiency of the enrichment procedure. All reactions were performed in PCR tubes in a thermocycler. For each reaction, 25 μg of total RNA were mixed with 70 pmol of a rRNA-specific primer mix in a final volume of 30 μl. Each specific primer mix included three specific primers for 16 S rRNA (5′-CCTACGGTTACCTTGTT-3′, 5′-TTAACCTTGCGGCCGTACTC-3′, and 5′-TCCGATTAACGCTTGCACCC-3′) and five specific primers for 23 S rRNA (5′-cctcacggttcattagt-3′, 5′-CTATAGTAAAGGTTCACGGG-3′, 5′-TCGTCATCACGCCTCAGCCT-3′, 5′-TCCCACATCGTTTCCCAC-3′, and 5′-CATGGAAAACATATTACC-3′). This mixture was heated to 70 °C for 5 min and quickly cooled to 4 °C. 10 μl of 10× MMLV reverse transcriptase buffer (0.5 mTris-HCl (pH 8.3), 0.1 m MgCl2, and 0.75m KCl), 5 μl of 10 mm dithiothreitol, 2 μl of 25 mm dNTPs mix, 3.5 μl of 20 units/μl SuperRNasin, 6 μl of 50 units/μl MMLV reverse transcriptase, and water were added to each tube to a final volume of 100 μl. The reactions were incubated at 42 °C for 25 min, and incubation was continued at 45 °C for 20 min for cDNA synthesis. To remove the rRNA moiety from the rRNA/cDNA hybrid, 5 μl of 10 units/μl RNase H was added and the mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 45 min. RNase H was inactivated by heating at 65 °C for 5 min. Newly synthesized cDNA was removed by incubation with 4 μl of 2 units/μl DNase I and 1.2 μl of 20 units/μl SuperRNasin at 37 °C for 2 h. Four reactions were combined for RNA cleanup with a single Qiagen RNeasy mini column. The quantity of enriched mRNA was measured by absorbance at 260 nm. A typical yield is 10–20 μg of RNA from 300 μg of total RNA constituting a 10–20-fold enrichment of mRNA to rRNA. For the RNA fragmentation, a maximum of 20 μg of RNA was added to a PCR tube containing 10 μl of 10× NEB buffer for T4 polynucleotide kinase in a final volume of 88 μl. The tube was incubated at 95 °C for 30 min and cooled to 4 °C. For the RNA 5′-thiolation and biotin-labeling reaction, 2 μl of 5 mm ATPγS and 10 μl of 10 units/μl T4 polynucleotide kinase were incubated with the fragmented RNA at 37 °C for 50 min. The reaction was inactivated by heating to 65 °C for 10 min and cooled to 4 °C. Excess ATPγS was removed by ethanol precipitation. Fragmented thiolated RNA was collected by centrifugation in the presence of glycogen (0.25 μg/μl) and resuspended in 90 μl of distilled water (dH2O). 6 μl of 500 mmMOPS (pH 7.5) and 4.0 μl of 50 mm polyethylene oxide-iodoacetyl-biotin were added to the fragmented thiolated RNA and incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. The biotin-labeled RNA was isolated by ethanol precipitation, washed twice with 70% ethanol, and dried and dissolved in 20–30 μl of molecular biology grade water. The quantity of the biotin-labeled RNA was measured by absorbance at 260 nm. The total yield for the entire procedure is typically 2–4 μg of biotin-labeled RNA from 300 μg of total RNA. The efficiency of RNA fragmentation and biotin labeling can be monitored with a gel shift assay where the biotin-labeled RNA is pre-incubated with avidin prior to electrophoresis. Biotin-labeled RNA is retarded during electrophoresis because of the avidin-biotin interaction. The position of the RNA in the gel addresses the fragmentation efficiency. The amount of shifted RNA indicates the efficiency of the biotin labeling. Inefficiencies in either of these parameters should be addressed before proceeding to the hybridization step. The nylon filters were soaked in 2× SSPE (20× SSPE contains 3 m NaCl, 0.2m NaH2PO4, and 25 mmEDTA) for 10 min and prehybridized in 10 ml of prehybridization solution (5× SSPE, 2% SDS), 1× Denhardt's solution (50× Denhardt's solution contains 5 g of Ficoll, 5 g of polyvinylpyrrolidone, 5 g of bovine serum albumin, and H2O to 500 ml), and 0.1 mg/ml sheared herring sperm DNA) for at least 1 h at 65 °C. 5–7 × 107 cpm of cDNA targets in 500 μl of prehybridization solution were heated at 95 °C for 10 min, rapidly cooled on ice, and added to 5.5 ml of prehybridization solution. The prehybridization solution was removed and replaced with the hybridization solution. Hybridization was carried out for 15–18 h at 65 °C. Following hybridization each filter was rinsed with 50 ml of 0.5× SSPE containing 0.2% SDS at room temperature for 3 min, followed by three washes in the same wash solution at 65 °C for 20 min each. The filters were partially air dried, wrapped in Saran Wrap, and exposed to a phosphor screen for 15–30 h. Filters were stripped by microwaving at 30% maximal power (1400 watts) in 500 ml of 10 mm Tris solution (pH 8.0) containing 1 mm EDTA and 1% SDS for 20 min. Stripped filters were wrapped in Saran Wrap and stored in the presence of damp paper towels in sealed plastic bags at 4 °C. For hybridization of biotinylated RNA targets to the Affymetrix GeneChips, 2–4 μg of fragmented biotin-labeled RNA of IH-G2490 (lrp +) and IH-G2491 (lrp −) were used for each GeneChip. The hybridization solution for each array was prepared with 100 μl of 2× MES hybridization buffer (200 mm MES, 2m NaCl, 40 mm EDTA, and 0.02% Tween 20), 1 μl of 100 nm Biotin-Oligo 948 (5′-biotin-GTCAAGATGCTACCGTTCAG-3′), 2 μl of 10 mg/ml herring sperm DNA, 2 μl of 50 mg/ml BSA, and 2–4 μg of fragmented biotin-labeled RNA and brought final volume to 200 μl with molecular biology grade water. The GeneChip arrays were equilibrated to room temperature immediately before use. The hybridization solution prepared above was added to each GeneChip and incubated in a GeneChip hybridization oven (Affymetrix) at 45 °C for 16 h at a rotation rate of 60 rpm. Following hybridization, the stain and wash procedures were carried out in an Affymetrix GeneChip Fluidics Station 400 using the ProKGE-WS2 fluidics script to run the machine. Streptavidin solution mix (300 μl of 2× MES stain buffer, 24 μl of 50 mg/ml BSA, 6 μl of 1 mg/ml streptavidin, and 270 μl of dH2O), antibody solution (300 μl 2× MES stain buffer, 24 μl of 50 mg/ml BSA, 6 μl of 10 mg/ml normal goat IgG, 6 μl of 0.5 mg/ml biotin anti-streptavidin, and 264 μl of dH2O) and SAPE solution (300 μl of 2× MES stain buffer, 24 μl of 50 mg/ml BSA, 6 μl of 1 mg/ml streptavidin-phycoerythrin, and 270 μl of dH2O) were prepared in amber tubes for the staining of each probe array. After hybridization, the hybridization solution was removed and kept at 4 °C. Each GeneChipTM was filled with 300 μl of nonstringent wash buffer (6× SSPE, 0.01% Tween 20, 0.005% Antifoam). The GeneChips were inserted into the fluidics station, and the ProKGE-WS2 protocol was selected to control the staining and washing of the probe arrays. After the procedure was complete, the GeneChips were removed from the fluidics station and checked for large bubbles or air pockets before scanning. The buffer in the GeneChips were drained and refilled with nonstringent buffer if bubbles were present. The experimental design for the nylon filter DNA array experiments reported here is diagrammed in Fig.1. In experiment 1, filters 1 and 2 were hybridized with 33P-labeled, random hexamer-generated cDNA targets complementary to each of three RNA preparations (RNA 1–3) obtained from the cells of three individual cultures of thelrp+ strain (IH-G2490). These three33P-labeled cDNA target preparations were pooled prior to hybridization to the full-length ORF probes on the filters (experiment 1). Following PhosphorImager analysis, these filters were stripped and again hybridized with pooled, 33P-labeled cDNA targets complementary to each of another three independently prepared RNA preparations (RNA 1–3) from thelrp− (IH-G2491) (experiment 1). This procedure was repeated two more times with filters 1 and 2 using two more independently prepared pools of cDNA targets (experiment 2, RNA 4–6). Another set of filters, filters 3 and 4, were used for experiments 3 and 4 as described for experiments 1 and 2. This protocol results in duplicate filter data for four experiments performed with cDNA targets complementary to four independent prepared sets of pooled RNA. Thus, because each filter contains duplicate spots for each ORF and duplicate filters were used for each experiment, four measurements for each ORF from each experiment were obtained. These four measurements for each experiment were averaged for further statistical analysis. The experimental design for the Affymetrix GeneChip experiments reported here is diagrammed in Fig. 2. The same 24 total RNA preparations used for the nylon filter experiments were pooled into sets of 3 and used for the preparation of biotin-labeled RNA targets for hybridization to Affymetrix GeneChips. For experiments 1–4, four GeneChips were hybridized with biotin-labeled RNA pools 1–3, 4–6, 7–9, and 10–12 prepared fromlrp+ cells, and four GeneChips were hybridized with biotin-labeled RNA pools 1–3, 4–6, 7–9, and 10–12 prepared from lrp− cells, respectively. One average difference measurement for each gene probe set on each GeneChip was obtained for subsequent data processing and analysis. A commercial software package obtained from Research Imaging Inc. (DNA ArrayVision) was used to grid the 16-bit image file obtained from the PhosphorImager, to record the pixel density of each of the 18,432 addresses on each filter, and to perform the background subtractions. 8,580 of the addresses on each filter are spotted with duplicate copies of each of the 4,290 E. coli ORFs. The remaining 9,852 empty addresses were used for background measurements. Because the backgrounds were quite constant, a global average background measurement was subtracted from each experimental measurement, although local background calculations are possible. Greater than 4 logs of linearity for the PhosphorImager-derived data were observed. Each GeneChip array was scanned twice with an HP GeneArray confocal laser at a 3 μm resolution, and the intensities at each perfect match (PM) and mismatch (MM) probe cell from both scans were averaged and saved as a *.DAT file. The average intensity of each GeneChip was globally scaled to 2500 and saved as a *.CEL. These probe pair measurements for each probe set were used for subsequent data processing and statistical analysis. Gene expression values from Affymetrix GeneChips are based on the average difference (AD) between hybridization signals of PM and MM oligonucleotide probe sets for each gene as described in the expression analysis technical manual from Affymetrix. The AD value of each probe set is calculated as AD = Σ(PM-MM)/number of probe pairs. Algorithms incorporated into Affymetrix software remove probe pairs that are out of a given range when calculating AD values for each probe set. In this process, the mean and standard deviation are calculated for intensity differences (PM − MM) across the entire probe set (excluding the highest and lowest values), and values within a set number of standard deviations (3 as default) are not included in the calculation. The advantage is that this process minimizes the variance introduced by experimental or biological error by removing the outliers present in each probe set. The disadvantage is this that this process does not always remove the same probe pairs for the calculation of the AD values among GeneChips. This can lead to the misinterpretation of the gene expression profiles obtained from GeneChip experiments. To alleviate this problem, a model-based method incorporated into a program called dChip has been described by Li and Wang (11Li C. Wong W.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 31-36Google Scholar). This method maintains constant probe pair set identities across all GeneChips while excluding outliers because of cross-hybridization, contamination during hybridization, or manufacturing defects that affect probe set measurements. For all of the GeneChip experiments reported here, each probe pair set from the *.CEL files was modeled by the dChip software prior to statistical analysis. As described above, the experimental design employed in this study consists of 33P-labeled cDNA target preparations for each of two genotypes hybridized to nylon filters, or three biotinylated mRNA target preparations hybridized to Affymetrix GeneChips. The designs for these experiments are depicted in Figs. 1 and 2. For each measurement, a background subtracted estimate of expression level for each gene was obtained and scaled to total counts by dividing each individual gene expression value by the total of all values on the filter or GeneChip. Thus, each normalized gene level is expressed as a fraction of the total mRNA hybridized to each DNA array. For any given measurement, a value greater than zero (indicating an expression level) or a zero (indicating an expression level lower than background) is obtained. Only those genes exhibiting an expression level greater than zero in all experiments were used for statistical analysis. Gene measurements containing zero expression values were set aside. Among this set of genes, those with zero expression values for all measurements in one genotype, and all values greater than zero for all measurements of another genotype for each experiment were identified. The significance of these results was analyzed by ranking these genes in ascending order according to their coefficients of variance of the four greater than zero measurements. The remaining genes were analyzed both by a simple t test and a regularized t test based on a Bayesian statistical framework described under “Results and Discussion.” All of the raw and processed data for the experimental results reported here are available in tabular format as supplemental data in the on-line version of this article. To interpret the results of a high dimensional DNA array experiment, it is necessary to determine the global false positive level inherent in the data set being analyzed. The global false positive level reflects all sources of experimental and biological variation inherent in a DNA array experiment. The basic idea is to infer the false positive level in the control versustreatment situation from the false positive level observed with the control versus control (and/or treatment versus, treatment) comparison. With this information, a global level of confidence can be calculated for differentially expressed genes measured at any given statistical significance level. For example, consider an experiment comparing the gene expression profiles of two genotypes, where an average of 10 genes are observed to be differentially expressed with a p value less than 0.0001 when gene expression profiles from one genotype are compared with data of the same genotype (e.g. lrp + versus lrp + orlrp − versus lrp −). Because no differential expression is expected in these comparisons, these 10 genes are clearly false positives generated by chance occurrences driven by experimental errors and biological variance. Now, if 100 genes are differentially expressed with a p value less than 0.0001 when the data from one genotype (lrp+) are compared with the data from the other genotype (lrp−), it is reasonable to infer that we can be only 90% confident that the differential expression of any one of these 100 genes is biologically meaningful because 10 false positives are expected from this data set. This example demonstrates that, although the confidence level based on the measurement for an individual gene may exceed 99.99% for two treatment conditions (local confidence of 0.0001), the confidence that this gene is differentially expressed might be only 90% (global confidence of 0.9). This example defines an ad hoc method of comparing control to control data to derive an estimate of an experiment-wide false positive level. We applied this ad hoc method for the estimation of false positive levels of the experiments described here by averaging the four measurements for each gene from the duplicate control filters of each experiment hybridized with labeled targets from the control strain IH-G2490 (lrp+) and comparing these averaged values of control data from experiments 1 and 3 to the averaged values of control data from experiments 2 and 4 (Fig. 1). In another analysis, we compared control data from experiments 1 and 4 to the averaged values of control data from experiments 2 and 3. Equivalent comparisons were performed with filters hybridized with labeled targets from the experimental strain (IH-G2491 (lrp−)). These particular two-by-two (controlversus control or experimental versusexperimental) comparisons were chosen because they average across experimental errors and biological differences both among filters and RNA preparatio"

Rev. 1994; 15: 27-39PubMed Google Scholar). It is produced by osteoblasts and appears to regulate bone metabolism in various ways, including skeletal development and bone remodeling (3Rodan G.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13361-13362Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Several reports demonstrated that TGF-β induced bone formation when it was locally administered into bone tissues in rat (4Beck L.S. Amento E.P., Xu, Y. Deguzman L. Lee W.P. Nguyen T. Gillett N.A. J.

However, it is disputable whether TGF-β would possess bone anabolic effects in vitro (8Elford P.R. Guenther H.L. Felix R. Cecchini M.G. Fleisch H.

Physiol. 1987; 133: 426-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar), and the mechanism by which TGF-β stimulates bone formation in vivo remains unknown.The Smad family proteins are critical components of the TGF-β signaling pathways (11Massague J. Chen Y.G. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 627-644Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). TGF-β exerts growth inhibitory and transcriptional response through the two receptor-regulated Smads, Smad2 and Smad3 (11Massague J. Chen Y.G. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 627-644Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Receptor-mediated phosphorylation of Smad2 or Smad3 induces their association with the common partner Smad4, followed by translocation into the nucleus where these complexes activate transcription of specific genes (12Massague J. Wotton D. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1745-1754Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As for osteoblasts, Li et al. (13Li J. Tsuji K. Komori T. Miyazono K. Wrana J.L. Ito Y. Nifuji A. Noda M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31009-31015Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) reported that overexpression of Smad2 suppressed Runx2(cbfa1) and osteocalcin mRNA expression in primary rat calvaria cells and ROS17/2.8 cells. Moreover, TGF-β stimulated the βV-integrin subunit expression and p57kip2proteolysis via Smad signaling in osteoblastic cells (14Nishimori S. Tanaka Y. Chiba T. Fujii M. Imamura T. Miyazono K.

Although Alliston et al. (15Alliston T. Choy L. Ducy P. Karsenty G. Derynck R. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2254-2272Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar) reported that Smad3 decreased Runx2 and osteocalcin gene expressions in MC3T3-E1 cells, our recent study revealed that Smad3 inhibited the proliferation and enhanced the levels of bone matrix proteins, such as type I collagen, osteopontin, and matrix Gla protein in a manner similar to TGF-β in these cells (16Sowa H. Kaji H. Yamaguchi T. Sugimoto T. Chihara K. J. Bone Miner. Res. 2002; 17: 1190-1199Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). On the other hand, unlike TGF-β, Smad3 enhanced ALP activity and mineralization of MC3T3-E1 cells in that study. Our findings suggested that Smad3 plays an important role in the regulation of bone formation. Indeed, Borton et al. (17Borton A.J. Frederick J.P. Datto M.B. Wang X.F. Weinstein R.S. J. Bone Miner. Res. 2001; 16: 1754-1764Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar) recently reported that mice with targeted deletion of Smad3 were osteopenic, compared with wild type littermates, because of a lower rate of bone formation. The increased synthesis of type I collagen was common effect of TGF-β and Smad3 on osteoblasts. However, Smad3 greatly increased ALP activity and mineralization, whereas TGF-β inhibited them in these cells. The reason for the discrepant effects of TGF-β and Smad3 on ALP activity and mineralization remained unknown in our previous study (16Sowa H. Kaji H. Yamaguchi T. Sugimoto T. Chihara K. J. Bone Miner. Res. 2002; 17: 1190-1199Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). We therefore hypothesized that TGF-β might inhibit ALP activity and mineralization of osteoblasts through some pathways other than the Smad3 pathway. Alternatively, it is also possible that some kinds of TGF-β-responsive intracellular signalings that are independent of Smad3 pathway might alter the activity of Smad3 signaling.There are actually three distinct MAPKs that have been identified in mammalian cells, referred to as extracellular signal-regulated kinases/p42/44 MAPK (ERK1/2), p38 MAPK (P38), and c-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNK)/stress-activated protein kinases (18Mulder K.M. Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 2000; 11: 23-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar). These MAPKs are all proline-directed, serine-threonine kinases that are activated on threonine and tyrosine residues in response to a wide variety of extracellular stimuli. TGF-β also stimulates ERK1/2, P38, and JNK in a variety of cell lines (18Mulder K.M. Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 2000; 11: 23-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar). Numerous reports suggested that MAPK pathways cross-talk with Smad pathway and modulate the transcriptional regulation of the target genes (19Blanchette F. Rivard N. Rudd P. Grondin F. Attisano L.

Our aim of this study is to clarify the role of MAPKs in TGF-β and Smad3 pathways in osteoblastic cells.DISCUSSIONIn the present study, the inhibition of the Smad3 signaling pathway by the expression of dominant negative type Smad3, Smad3ΔC, did not affect TGF-β-induced activations of MAPKs, ERK1/2, P38, and JNK. These findings indicated that activations of these MAPKs by TGF-β were independent of Smad3 signaling pathways. Indeed, Engelet al. (20Engel M.E. McDonnell M.A. Law B.K. Moses H.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37413-37420Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar) reported that JNK was rapidly and transiently activated by TGF-β receptor type I in a Rho-GTPase-dependent and Smad-independent manner in mink lung epithelial (Mv1Lu) cells and a breast carcinoma cell line (MDA-MB-468). These findings suggested that the coincident activation of the Smad and JNK/AP-1 pathways is necessary for full transcriptional activation in response to TGF-β. Moreover, TGF-β induced proliferation in colon carcinoma cells by Ras-dependent but Smad-independent down-regulation of p21cip1 (32Yan Z. Kim G.Y. Deng X. Friedman E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 9870-9879Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). On the other hand, Lai and Cheng (33Lai C.F. Cheng S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 15514-15522Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar) reported that TGF-β activated Ras/MAPK/AP-1 signaling and that the stimulation of AP-1 by TGF-β was dependent on Smad signaling in human osteoblastic cells. In addition, several studies suggested the cross-talk of Ras-ERK/MAPKs and TGF-β-Smad pathway (19Blanchette F. Rivard N. Rudd P. Grondin F. Attisano L. Dubois C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33986-33994Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 22Kretzschmar M. Doody J. Timokhina I. Massague J.

Chem. 2001; 276: 14466-14473Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). Taken into account with our findings, TGF-β-Smad signaling, MAPK pathways, and AP-1 might cross-talk in a complex manner, although there are TGF-β-responsive and Smad3-independent MAPK pathways in mouse osteoblastic cells.Several studies and our previous study indicated that TGF-β suppressed ALP activity and mineralization in osteoblasts including MC3T3-E1 cells (8Elford P.R. Guenther H.L. Felix R. Cecchini M.G. Fleisch H. Bone. 1987; 8: 259-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 9Harris S.E. Bonewald L.F. Harris M.A. Sabatini M. Dallas S. Feng J.Q. Ghosh-Choudhury N. Wozney J. Mundy G.R. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1994; 9: 855-863Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar, 34Noda M. Rodan G.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1986; 140: 56-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). In contrast, Smad3 promoted them in MC3T3-E1 cells (16Sowa H. Kaji H. Yamaguchi T. Sugimoto T. Chihara K. J. Bone Miner. Res. 2002; 17: 1190-1199Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). In the present study, inactivation of ERK1/2 and JNK with their specific inhibitors antagonized the inhibitory effects of TGF-β on ALP activity and mineralization in MC3T3-E1 cells (Figs. 4 and 5). These findings suggested that the activation of ERK1/2 and JNK contributes to the inhibitory regulation of ALP activity and mineralization by TGF-β. In the present study, the specific inhibitors of ERK1/2 and JNK enhanced the transcriptional activity (Fig. 8), as well as ALP activity and mineralization (Figs. 6 and 7) induced by Smad3. Taken together, these findings suggested that ERK1/2 and JNK signaling pathways negatively regulate Smad3 signaling pathway, resulting in the suppression of Smad3-induced ALP activity and mineralization in osteoblasts. In support of this speculation, several studies have shown that JNK, as well as c-Jun and JunB, represses Smad3-mediated transcriptional activity in the human hepatoma cell line (HepG2), mouse fibroblasts, and keratinocytes (35Dennler S. Prunier C. Ferrand N. Gauthier J.M. Atfi A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28858-28865Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 36Verrecchia F. Tacheau C. Schorpp-Kistner M. Angel P. Mauviel A. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 2205-2211Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Moreover, several studies indicated that oncogene Ras or epidermal growth factor-induced Ras repressed TGF-β/Smad signaling in cancer cells or cell lines other than osteoblasts (19Blanchette F. Rivard N. Rudd P. Grondin F. Attisano L. Dubois C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33986-33994Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 22Kretzschmar M. Doody J. Timokhina I.

Chem. 2001; 276: 14466-14473Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). The present study indicated that TGF-β activates ERK1/2 as well as JNK and inhibits ALP activity in a manner independent of Smad3 in MC3T3-E1 cells. These findings therefore suggested that TGF-β-responsive ERK1/2 and JNK cascades negatively regulate Smad3-induced transcriptional activity as well as ALP activity and mineralization in osteoblasts. The negative signal of TGF-β-responsive ERK1/2 and JNK for the Smad3 signaling pathway might explain the discrepant effects of TGF-β and Smad3 on ALP activity and mineralization in MC3T3-E1 cells. However, we cannot rule out the possibility that some other mechanisms might be responsible for these discrepant effects of TGF-β and Smad3. First, there might be some intracellular signaling pathways by which Smad3 but not TGF-β enhances ALP activity. Takeuchi et al. (37Takeuchi Y. Suzawa M. Kikuchi T. Nishida E. Fujita T. Matsumoto T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29309-29316Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar) reported that the type I collagen and α2β1-integrin interaction up-regulates ALP activity and down-regulates TGF-β receptor activity, which allows the cells to escape the inhibitory effects of TGF-β in MC3T3-E1 cells. Therefore, α2β1-integrin may play some role in Smad3-stimulated ALP activity. Smad3 overexpression may enhance the interaction between type I collagen and integrin by up-regulating the expression of the integrin in MC3T3-E1 cells. The second mechanism concerns the transformed state of osteoblasts. TGF-β promotes the production of COLI in ROS 17/2.8 (10Noda M. Rodan G.A. J. Cell. Physiol. 1987; 133: 426-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar) and MC3T3-E1 cells (2Centrella M. Horowitz M.C. Wozney J.M. McCarthy T.L. Endocr. Rev. 1994; 15: 27-39PubMed Google Scholar, 37Takeuchi Y. Suzawa M. Kikuchi T. Nishida E. Fujita T. Matsumoto T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29309-29316Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). However, TGF-β stimulates and inhibits ALP activity in ROS 17/2.8 and MC3T3-E1 cells, respectively (10Noda M. Rodan G.A. J. Cell. Physiol. 1987; 133: 426-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 38Ibbotson K.J. Orcutt C.M. Anglin A.M. D'Souza S.M. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1989; 4: 37-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Although the effects of Smad3 on ROS 17/2.8 cells are unknown, the intracellular signals that modulate the effects of TGF-β and Smad3 might be different, depending on the cell lines, species, and how the cells have been transformed.The present study could not clarify the exact molecular mechanism by which TGF-β negatively regulates Smad3-induced transcriptional activity as well as ALP activity and mineralization through ERK1/2 and JNK. Several studies revealed the mechanisms by which RAS/ERK1/2 or JNK cascades negatively regulate TGF-β signaling pathway. Kretzschmaret al. (22Kretzschmar M. Doody J. Timokhina I. Massague J. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 804-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (847) Google Scholar) reported that oncogenic Ras inhibited the TGF-β-induced nuclear accumulation of Smad2 as well as Smad3 and Smad-dependent transcription by phosphorylation of Smad2 and Smad3 via ERK1/2, whereas Saha et al. (24Saha D. Datta P.K. Beauchamp R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 29531-29537Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) reported that oncogenic Ras repressed TGF-β signaling by ERK1/2-dependent down-regulation of Smad4. The AP-1 family protein c-Jun, which is a substrate for JNK, directly suppressed Smad/DNA interaction (36Verrecchia F. Tacheau C. Schorpp-Kistner M. Angel P. Mauviel A. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 2205-2211Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). It is also possible that the target step in which TGF-β-responsive ERK1/2 and JNK negatively regulate Smad3 signaling pathway might be the recruitment of Smad3 to intracellular membranes that contains TGF-β-receptor type I by Smad anchor for receptor activation (39Miura S. Takeshita T. Asao H. Kimura Y. Murata K. Sasaki Y. Hanai J.I. Beppu H. Tsukazaki T. Wrana J.L. Miyazono K. Sugamura K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 9346-9355Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 40Tsukazaki T. Chiang T.A. Davison A.F. Attisano L. Wrana J.L. Cell. 1998; 95: 779-791Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (782) Google Scholar), phosphorylation/activation of a motif SSXS in the C terminus of Smad3 by serine/threonine kinase activity of TGF-β-receptor type I (41Wrana J.L. Cell. 2000; 100: 189-192Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar), the association of Smad3 and the common partner, Smad4, the translocation of the Smad3-Smad4 complex into the nucleus, and its DNA binding or interaction with other transcriptional regulators. In our preliminary study, both ERK1/2 and JNK inhibitors did not promote the TGF-β-responsive nuclear translocation of Smad3 (data not shown). These findings suggested that the TGF-β-responsive ERK1/2 and JNK cascade might not affect the nuclear translocation of Smad3 in MC3T3-E1 cells. Furthermore, there might be the autoinduction system that TGF-β up-regulates the production of TGF-β itself (42Yue J. Mulder K.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 30765-30773Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). It is possible that TGF-β increases the production of Smad3 and that ERK1/2 and JNK negatively regulate Smad3 expression by the TGF-β-responsive autoinduction system. Further studies are in progress in our laboratory. Smad3 enhanced ALP activity and mineralization in MC3T3-E1 cells (16Sowa H. Kaji H. Yamaguchi T. Sugimoto T. Chihara K. J. Bone Miner. Res. 2002; 17: 1190-1199Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), suggesting that Smad3 is involved in the transcriptional mechanism leading to bone formation. In support of this, Bortonet al. (17Borton A.J. Frederick J.P. Datto M.B. Wang X.F. Weinstein R.S. J. Bone Miner. Res. 2001; 16: 1754-1764Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar) recently reported that mice with targeted deletion of Smad3 were osteopenic compared with wild type littermates, because of a lower rate of bone formation. In the present study, inhibitors of ERK1/2 and JNK rescued TGF-β-inhibited ALP activity and mineralization in MC3T3-E1 cells. Moreover, these inhibitors enhanced Smad3-induced ALP activity and mineralization in these cells. The negative effects of TGF-β on ALP activity and mineralization in osteoblasts negatively influence bone formation. If in vivoERK1/2 inhibitor and/or JNK inhibitor antagonize the negative effects of TGF-β on bone formation and enhance the positive effects of TGF-β-responsive Smad3 on bone formation, the combination of TGF-β and inhibitors of ERK1/2 and/or JNK may be a novel therapeutic strategy for bone disease or fracture healing. Type I collagen is the abundant protein in bone matrix and plays an important role in bone formation, mineralization, and maintenance of bone strength (37Takeuchi Y. Suzawa M. Kikuchi T. Nishida E. Fujita T. Matsumoto T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29309-29316Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig.9, TGF-β-induced expression of COLI was enhanced by the ERK1/2 inhibitor but not by the JNK inhibitor. We therefore speculated that the combination of TGF-β with ERK1/2 inhibitors might be better than with JNK inhibitor for inducing bone anabolic action.In conclusion, the present study indicated that TGF-β-activated ERK1/2 and JNK cascades negatively regulated the transcriptional activity as well as ALP activity and mineralization induced by Smad3 in mouse osteoblastic cells. We propose that Smad3 is an important molecule in the regulation of bone formation and that the local combined administration TGF-β with inhibitors of ERK1/2 might be a novel therapeutic strategy for the stimulation of bone formation. Transforming growth factor β (TGF-β)1 is most abundant in bone matrix compared with other tissues (1Jennings J.C. Mohan S. Endocrinology. 1990; 126: 1014-1021Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). TGF-β is stored in an inactive form, released from the bone matrix, and activated in the bone microenvironment (2Centrella M. Horowitz M.C. Wozney J.M. McCarthy T.L. Endocr. Rev. 1994; 15: 27-39PubMed Google Scholar). It is produced by osteoblasts and appears to regulate bone metabolism in various ways, including skeletal development and bone remodeling (3Rodan G.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13361-13362Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Several reports demonstrated that TGF-β induced bone formation when it was locally administered into bone tissues in rat (4Beck L.S. Amento E.P., Xu, Y. Deguzman L. Lee W.P. Nguyen T. Gillett N.A. J.

The Smad family proteins are critical components of the TGF-β signaling pathways (11Massague J. Chen Y.G. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 627-644Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). TGF-β exerts growth inhibitory and transcriptional response through the two receptor-regulated Smads, Smad2 and Smad3 (11Massague J. Chen Y.G. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 627-644Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Receptor-mediated phosphorylation of Smad2 or Smad3 induces their association with the common partner Smad4, followed by translocation into the nucleus where these complexes activate transcription of specific genes (12Massague J. Wotton D. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1745-1754Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As for osteoblasts, Li et al. (13Li J. Tsuji K. Komori T. Miyazono K. Wrana J.L. Ito Y. Nifuji A. Noda M. J. Biol.

Moreover, TGF-β stimulated the βV-integrin subunit expression and p57kip2proteolysis via Smad signaling in osteoblastic cells (14Nishimori S. Tanaka Y. Chiba T. Fujii M. Imamura T. Miyazono K.

Kaji H. Yamaguchi T. Sugimoto T. Chihara K. J. Bone Miner. Res. 2002; 17: 1190-1199Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). On the other hand, unlike TGF-β, Smad3 enhanced ALP activity and mineralization of MC3T3-E1 cells in that study. Our findings suggested that Smad3 plays an important role in the regulation of bone formation. Indeed, Borton et al. (17Borton A.J. Frederick J.P. Datto M.B. Wang X.F. Weinstein R.S. J. Bone Miner.

The increased synthesis of type I collagen was common effect of TGF-β and Smad3 on osteoblasts. However, Smad3 greatly increased ALP activity and mineralization, whereas TGF-β inhibited them in these cells. The reason for the discrepant effects of TGF-β and Smad3 on ALP activity and mineralization remained unknown in our previous study (16Sowa H. Kaji H. Yamaguchi T. Sugimoto T. Chihara K. J. Bone Miner. Res. 2002; 17: 1190-1199Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). We therefore hypothesized that TGF-β might inhibit ALP activity and mineralization of osteoblasts through some pathways other than the Smad3 pathway. Alternatively, it is also possible that some kinds of TGF-β-responsive intracellular signalings that are independent of Smad3 pathway might alter the activity of Smad3 signaling. There are actually three distinct MAPKs that have been identified in mammalian cells, referred to as extracellular signal-regulated kinases/p42/44 MAPK (ERK1/2), p38 MAPK (P38), an"

Here, we show that only a form of nicastrin (NCT) containingN-linked complex oligosaccharides is present in active γ-secretase complexes. Overexpression of NCT does not generate more of this mature protein, a phenomenon analogous to the strictly regulated formation of mature presenilin heterodimers from immature holoprotein. The absence of presenilin severely limits the maturation of NCT, yet combined overexpression of both proteins does not increase respective mature types. Taken together, our findings describe unusual regulatory features of this key signaling protease: the association of NCT with γ-secretase is tightly regulated via glycosylation; at least one other cofactor exists; the least abundant member of the complex becomes limiting; and the cofactor that serves this role may vary by cell type.

Wolfe M.S. Science. 2001; 293: 1449-1454Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar). This elusive enzyme first garnered attention because it generates the amyloid-β protein Aβ, a ∼42-residue peptide that accumulates to high abundance in the limbic and association cortices in Alzheimer's disease (2Selkoe D.J. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 741-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (5156) Google Scholar).

A second substrate of γ-secretase is another cell surface receptor, Notch, which is critically required for various cell fate decisions during embryogenesis (4Artavanis-Tsakonas S.

Despite significant progress in the characterization of its function in normal biology and disease, the identity of γ-secretase has not been definitively established. Nevertheless, there is substantial evidence that the presenilin 1 and 2 proteins (PS1 and PS2) constitute the active site of the protease (9Wolfe M.S. Xia W. Ostaszewski B.L. Diehl T.S. Kimberly W.T.

Nature. 2000; 405: 689-694Crossref PubMed Scopus (865) Google Scholar). The latter data strongly implicate PS as a central component of γ-secretase but not necessarily the only one. The presenilins are themselves endoproteolytically cleaved into N- and C-terminal fragments (NTF and CTF, respectively), and these fragments appear to be the active form of the molecule (18Thinakaran G. Borchelt D.R. Lee M.K. Slunt H.H. Spitzer L. Kim G. Ratovitsky T. Davenport F. Nordstedt C. Seeger M. Hardy J. Levey A.I. Gandy S.E. Jenkins N.A. Copeland N.G. Price D.L. Sisodia S.S.

Yet overexpression of PS neither generates more fragments nor increases γ-secretase activity, suggesting that PS NTF and CTF levels are tightly regulated by unknown limiting cofactors (19Thinakaran G.

Recently, Yu et al. (20Yu G. Nishimura M. Arawaka S. Levitan D. Zhang L. Tandon A. Song Y.Q. Rogaeva E. Chen F. Kawarai T. Supala A. Levesque L., Yu, H. Yang D.S. Holmes E. Milman P. Liang Y.

These authors suggested that NCT is a functional component of γ-secretase along with presenilin. Indeed, when the NCT gene was subsequently ablated in C. elegans orD. melanogaster, Notch function was blocked in a manner indistinguishable from ablation of PS (20Yu G. Nishimura M. Arawaka S.

Furthermore, upon partial purification of γ-secretase on an inhibitor affinity matrix, PS NTF, PS CTF, and NCT all co-eluted with γ-secretase activity (24Esler W.P. Kimberly W.T. Ostaszewski B.L., Ye, W. Diehl T.S. Selkoe D.J. Wolfe M.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 2720-2725Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). Together, these data argue that both the PS NTF/CTF heterodimer and NCT are required components of γ-secretase. However, there has been some discrepancy regarding the molecular size of NCT. Transient and stable overexpression initially suggested that NCT is primarily a ∼110-kDa glycoprotein (20Yu G. Nishimura M. Arawaka S. Levitan D. Zhang L. Tandon A. Song Y.Q. Rogaeva E. Chen F. Kawarai T. Supala A. Levesque L., Yu, H. Yang D.S. Holmes E. Milman P. Liang Y. Zhang D.M., Xu, D.H. Sato C. Rogaev E. Smith M. Janus C. Zhang Y. Aebersold R. Farrer L.S. Sorbi S. Bruni A. Fraser P. St. George-Hyslop P. Nature. 2000; 407: 48-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (823) Google Scholar). However, our partial purification of γ-secretase identified an NCT form that migrated at ∼150 kDa (24Esler W.P. Kimberly W.T. Ostaszewski B.L., Ye, W. Diehl T.S. Selkoe D.J. Wolfe M.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 2720-2725Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). In an effort to resolve this apparent discrepancy, we have identified and analyzed several cell lines in which NCT is glycosylated to varying extents. In agreement with recently published work by Leem et al. (25Leem J.Y. Vijayan S. Han P. Cai D. Machura M. Lopes K.O. Veselits M.L., Xu, H. Thinakaran G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 19236-19240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar) and Tomita et al. (26Tomita T. Katayama R. Takikawa R. Iwatsubo T. FEBS Lett. 2002; 520: 117-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), only the most glycosylated, ∼150 kDa form of NCT (which contains complex and high-mannose N-linked oligosaccharides) co-immunoprecipitated with PS heterodimers from cells. Furthermore, we found that this mature NCT form was located in the same subcellular vesicle fractions that contain PS1 NTF and CTF. When we used a potent γ-secretase inhibitor that we designed as an activity-dependent affinity matrix, only the fully glycosylated (∼150 kDa) form of NCT (along with PS heterodimers) was specifically bound to it. Surprisingly, we found that NCT overexpression did not generate increased amounts of mature protein, a result reminiscent of the strict limit on cellular PS NTF/CTF levels observed when PS holoprotein is overexpressed. Further, we show that the absence of PS1 limits NCT maturation, yet overexpression of PS1 does not lead to increased levels of mature NCT. Therefore, our findings indicate that the full glycosylation of NCT is tightly regulated in a manner analogous to the “replacement phenomenon” described for PS (19Thinakaran G. Harris C.L. Ratovitski T. Davenport F. Slunt H.H. Price D.L. Borchelt D.R. Sisodia S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28415-28422Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). Moreover, the full glycosylation of NCT correlates with active γ-secretase and depends on the presence of PS1. Our data also allow us to conclude that the assembly and maturation of γ-secretase is dependent on the association of PS and NCT with at least one other cofactor. Cell lysates were prepared essentially as described (29Li Y.-M. Lai M.-T., Xu, M. Huang Q. DiMuzio-Mower J. Sardana M.K. Shi X.-P. Yin K.-C. Shafer J.A. Gardell S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6138-6143Crossref PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were grown in suspension (Jurkat and HeLa) or on plates (human embryonic kidney (HEK) and Chinese hamster ovary (CHO)) and then collected and resuspended in MES buffer (50 mm MES, pH 6.0, 5 mmMgCl2, 5 mm CaCl2, and 150 mm NaCl) with complete protease inhibitors (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Cells were broken by one passage through a French press above 1000 p.s.i . Nuclei and cell debris was pelleted for 10 min at 3000 × g and discarded. The postnuclear supernatant was pelleted at 100,000 × g for 1 h. This membrane pellet was washed in 0.1 m sodium carbonate (pH 11.3) to remove non-integral membrane proteins and then solubilized in 1% CHAPSO in MES buffer and diluted 4-fold in HEPES buffer (50 mm HEPES pH 7.0, 5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm CaCl2, and 150 mm NaCl). All lysates contained ∼0.2 mg/ml protein, as measured by the BCA protein assay (Pierce). For the initial analysis of glycosylated NCT species, the Glycopro deglycosylation kit (Prozyme) was used. For deglycosylation with endoglycosidase H, Endo H (Prozyme) was used. All experiments were performed under SDS denaturing conditions according to the manufacturer's instructions. Discontinuous iodixanol gradient fractionation was performed as described (34Zhang J. Kang D.E. Xia W. Okochi M. Mori H. Selkoe D.J. Koo E.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12436-12442Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Briefly, five 15-cm plates of CHO cells stably expressing APP695 with the Swedish mutation were broken with 10 strokes of a Dounce homogenizer. After four passages through a 25-gauge needle, the unbroken cells and nuclei were pelleted at 3000 × g for 10 min. The postnuclear supernatant was pelleted at 65,000 × g for 1 h, resuspended, and overlaid on a 2.5–30% discontinuous iodixanol gradient. Each 1-ml fraction was probed for the indicated proteins by direct Western blot. To verify individual runs, the fractions were probed with calnexin antibody (1:1000, StressGen) and syntaxin 6 (1:1000, StressGen). For each of the indicated conditions, a 10-cm dish of CHO cells was starved in media lacking methionine and cysteine for 30 min. Cells were pulsed for 30 min with 200 μCi/ml of [35S]methionine (Express protein labeling mix, PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Cells were chased with cold medium for the indicated times and lysed in 1% Nonidet P-40. Immunoprecipitation was performed with 1:500 of antibody R302. IPs were washed three times in Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer and then run on an 8% Tris-glycine gel, fixed in 50% methanol with 20% acetic acid, dried, and exposed to a phosphorimager cassette. The III-31C resin used to precipitate active γ-secretase has been described (24Esler W.P. Kimberly W.T. Ostaszewski B.L., Ye, W. Diehl T.S. Selkoe D.J. Wolfe M.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 2720-2725Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). The cell lysates were adjusted to 1% CHAPSO and incubated with III-31C resin for 2 h at room temperature with gentle rocking. The resin was washed twice with several resin volumes of buffer (1% CHAPSO in HEPES buffer). The bound proteins were then released with 2× Laemmli sample buffer (4% SDS, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.2, 20% glycerol, and 10% β-mercaptoethanol). For PS1 NTF co-immunoprecipitations, anti-serum X81 (1:100, raised to the first 81 residues of the PS1 NTF) was added to lysates adjusted to 1% CHAPSO. Co-IPs were washed three times in 1% CHAPSO in HEPES buffer, and bound proteins were released with 2× Laemmli sample buffer. For III-31C or X81 precipitations, the samples were run on 8–16% Tris-glycine PAGE gels, transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride, and probed with R302 (for nicastrin, 1:4000), Ab14 (for PS1 NTF, 1:2000), and 13A11 (for PS1 CTF, 5 μg/ml) or guinea pig anti-nicastrin (1:2000, Chemicon), goat N-19 anti-PS1 NTF (1:200, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and 13A11. NCT is a glycoprotein with a predicted molecular mass of ∼80 kDa that was initially reported to migrate at ∼110 kDa (20Yu G. Nishimura M. Arawaka S. Levitan D. Zhang L. Tandon A. Song Y.Q. Rogaeva E. Chen F. Kawarai T. Supala A. Levesque L., Yu, H. Yang D.S. Holmes E. Milman P. Liang Y. Zhang D.M., Xu, D.H. Sato C. Rogaev E. Smith M. Janus C. Zhang Y. Aebersold R. Farrer L.S. Sorbi S. Bruni A. Fraser P. St. George-Hyslop P. Nature. 2000; 407: 48-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (823) Google Scholar). We had previously employed an affinity purification method to enrich for functional γ-secretase and had found NCT as a ∼150-kDa polypeptide (24Esler W.P. Kimberly W.T. Ostaszewski B.L., Ye, W. Diehl T.S. Selkoe D.J. Wolfe M.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 2720-2725Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). To resolve this discrepancy, we prepared membranes from several cell lines including Jurkat, HeLa, HEK, and CHO cells. Following solubilization in 1% CHAPSO, we probed for endogenous NCT using antibody R302, which recognizes the C-terminal 20 amino acids. In all cases, we found a band that migrated at ∼150 kDa (Fig.1 a). In addition, the HEK lysates exhibited fainter bands at ∼110 and ∼80 kDa. In the CHO lysates, the higher (150 kDa) and intermediate (110 kDa) forms of NCT were also readily visible, suggesting that in certain cell lines there are at least two different forms of glycosylated NCT. To further characterize the nature of the ∼150-kDa species of NCT, we assessed the effects of different glycosidases. Using the enzyme PNGase F, which removes all N-linked oligosaccharides, regardless of complexity, we were able to fully convert the 150-kDa NCT in HeLa lysates into an 80-kDa form, consistent with the size of the polypeptide backbone (Fig. 1 b, lanes 1-4). The addition of glycosidases forO-linked sugars (endoglycosidase O and sialidase A) did not have any further effect on the migration of NCT (data not shown). This suggests that the shift in migration was exclusively caused byN-linked modification, in agreement with the presence of multiple N-linked glycosylation motifs in the ectodomain (20Yu G. Nishimura M. Arawaka S. Levitan D. Zhang L. Tandon A. Song Y.Q. Rogaeva E. Chen F. Kawarai T. Supala A. Levesque L., Yu, H. Yang D.S. Holmes E. Milman P. Liang Y. Zhang D.M., Xu, D.H. Sato C. Rogaev E. Smith M. Janus C. Zhang Y. Aebersold R. Farrer L.S. Sorbi S. Bruni A. Fraser P. St. George-Hyslop P. Nature. 2000; 407: 48-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (823) Google Scholar). N-linked oligosaccharides can be further modified in the golgi/trans-golgi network compartments into either high-mannose or complex N-linked sugars. These two forms can be differentiated by Endo H, which can only cleave high-mannose residues (27Trumbly R.J. Robbins P.W. Belfort M. Ziegler F.D. Maley F. Trimble R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 5683-5690Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). When we incubated Endo H with HeLa lysates, we found only a small downshift in the size of the protein to ∼130 kDa (C-NCT) (Fig.1 b, lanes 5 and 6), indicating that most N-linked sugars in mature NCT (C+HM-NCT) are complex oligosaccharides, and only a minority are high-mannose residues. To further clarify the nature of the ∼150- and ∼110-kDa NCT isoforms, we performed a similar experiment on CHO lysates. Analogous to its effect in the HeLa lysates, PNGase F reduced the migration of NCT to its native ∼80-kDa position (Fig. 1 c, lanes 1–4). The addition of Endo H generated both the intermediate Endo H-resistant band (C-NCT) as well as the 80-kDa band (Fig. 1 c, lanes 5 and 6). This result suggests that the lower ∼110-kDa NCT found endogenously in CHO cells is an immature form of the protein (N-NCT). To further explore whether the higher form of endogenous NCT corresponds to mature protein, we subjected CHO membranes to iodixanol gradient fractionation. This previously characterized method separates endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-rich vesicles from golgi- and post-golgi-rich vesicles (28Xia W. Ray W.J. Ostaszewski B.L. Rahmati T. Kimberly W.T. Wolfe M.S. Zhang J. Goate A.M. Selkoe D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 9299-9304Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). We verified the technique by probing for calnexin (an ER-resident protein) and syntaxin 6 (a protein enriched in the golgi/trans-golgi network; Fig.2 a, bottom two panels). As reported previously, the endogenous PS1 holoprotein was located in ER fractions, and the PS1 heterodimers were present principally in the golgi-enriched fractions (Fig. 2 a). We found that the 150-kDa mature NCT isoform was located in the golgi-enriched vesicle fractions (Fig. 2 a, lanes 4–8) where its quantitative distribution strikingly paralleled that of the PS1 NTF/CTF, whereas the 110-kDa immature isoform was present primarily in the ER fractions, with PS1 holoprotein (Fig. 2 a, lanes 1–4). Because this technique effectively separated the 110-kDa from the 150-kDa NCT, we used fractions 1 and 12 to independently deglycosylate the two isoforms to confirm their Endo H sensitivities. In the ER-rich fraction 1, Endo H treatment converted the major 110-kDa band to 80 kDa (Fig.2 b, lanes 1–4). In fraction 12 the more abundant 150-kDa NCT was converted to an intermediate size of ∼130 kDa (C-NCT; Fig. 2 b, lanes 5–8). These results indeed suggest that the higher NCT band corresponds to a mature, fully N-glycosylated form of the protein and that it co-localizes to vesicular compartments containing PS1 heterodimers. Because the subcellular distribution of mature NCT was indistinguishable from that of PS heterodimers (Fig. 2 a), we reasoned that this isoform may be directly associated with PS1 NTFs/CTFs. We therefore performed a co-immunoprecipation (co-IP) of CHO membranes solubilized in 1% CHAPSO, using antibody X81 (to the N terminus of PS1) that precipitates γ-secretase activity (24Esler W.P. Kimberly W.T. Ostaszewski B.L., Ye, W. Diehl T.S. Selkoe D.J. Wolfe M.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 2720-2725Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar, 29Li Y.-M. Lai M.-T., Xu, M.

Following co-IP from excess amounts of lysate, we probed the same sample on the same polyvinylidene difluoride membrane with antibodies to NCT, PS1 NTF, and PS1 CTF (Fig.3 a). Following elution of the proteins from the X81 beads, we detected only the higher (150 kDa) form of NCT along with the PS1 heterodimers (Fig. 3 a, lane 3). Because mature NCT selectively co-precipitated with presenilin heterodimers, we reasoned that it might have a long half-life, similar to that of PS (18Thinakaran G. Borchelt D.R. Lee M.K. Slunt H.H. Spitzer L. Kim G. Ratovitsky T. Davenport F. Nordstedt C. Seeger M. Hardy J. Levey A.I. Gandy S.E. Jenkins N.A. Copeland N.G. Price D.L. Sisodia S.S. Neuron. 1996; 17: 181-190Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (939) Google Scholar). We therefore performed a pulse-chase analysis of NCT in the CHO cells. Indeed, the 150-kDa NCT (C+HM NCT) was relatively stable over 8 h compared with the more rapidly degraded 110-kDa form (Fig. 3 b). Next, we took advantage of the strict activity-dependent binding of our III-31C affinity resin (24Esler W.P. Kimberly W.T. Ostaszewski B.L., Ye, W. Diehl T.S. Selkoe D.J. Wolfe M.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 2720-2725Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar) to determine whether mature NCT is directly associated with active γ-secretase molecules. For each condition tested, we probed the same samples for the presence of NCT, PS1 NTF, and PS1 CTF. When we used excess amounts of a CHO membrane lysate relative to the binding capacity of the resin, we observed a selective depletion of both the PS1 heterodimers and the 150-kDa NCT (Fig. 3 c, lanes 1 and 2). Accordingly, the resin-bound precipitate contained the latter three proteins (lane 3). When we performed the same III-31C precipitation with limiting (rather than excess) amounts of lysate in an attempt to fully bind all available γ-secretase to the resin, almost all of the 150-kDa NCT and the PS1 heterodimers were depleted from the supernatant and specifically eluted from the resin (Fig.3 c, lanes 4–6). In both conditions, we found that only a very small amount of immature NCT was brought down by the beads (Fig. 3 c,lanes 3 and 6). Thus, precipitation of the complex using this activity-dependent resin leads to very substantial enrichment of mature NCT. The levels of PS NTF/CTF heterodimers are regulated by unknown limiting cofactors in the cell (19Thinakaran G. Harris C.L. Ratovitski T. Davenport F. Slunt H.H. Price D.L. Borchelt D.R. Sisodia S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28415-28422Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). Because the results above indicate that mature NCT is tightly associated with PS heterodimers, the mature isoform may be a limiting cofactor and/or may itself be limited by another cofactor. We addressed these possibilities by first evaluating the effect of overexpressing NCT on its glycosylation pattern. In HEK cells stably overexpressing wild type NCT, very little additional 150-kDa mature protein was formed compared with the endogenous control level (Fig. 4 a, lanes 1 and 2). Indeed, comparison of the HEK cells with or without stable expression of NCT demonstrated a selective accumulation of the 110-kDa isoform. When just the exogenously expressed NCT was specifically detected via its V5 epitope, a large majority was found to be in the immature form, and only a small fraction was able to replace endogenous mature NCT (Fig. 4 c, lane 3). This result suggests that mature NCT undergoes a replacement phenomenon similar to mature (heterodimeric) PS. When either protein is overexpressed, mostly immature forms accumulate; for NCT it is the immature N-linked glycosylated form, and for PS it is the immature holoprotein. Because the maturation of both NCT and PS1 appears to be strictly regulated, we wondered whether each protein was the limiting factor for the other. We therefore examined CHO cells stably overexpressing wild type PS1 (PS70) because these cells have excess endogenous NCT (see Fig. 1 a, lane 4) and excess PS1 (30Xia W. Zhang J. Kholodenko D. Citron M. Podlisny M.B. Teplow D.B. Haass C. Seubert P. Koo E.H. Selkoe D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7977-7982Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). Compared with a CHO cell line that does not stably express exogenous PS1 (designated CHO), we observed no increase in mature NCT nor in PS1 heterodimers (Fig. 4 b, lanes 1 and2). Indeed, the CHO cells already have detectable endogenous PS1 holoprotein (see Figs. 2 a and 4 a, lane 1), suggesting that these cells express limiting amounts of an unidentified additional cofactor(s) that prevents further maturation of both PS1 and NCT. We also looked at the effect of aspartate mutant PS1 and PS2 (in the stable CHO cell line 2A-2) on NCT maturation. Similar to overexpression of wild-type protein (in the PS70 cells), we found no significant alteration in the pattern of the NCT isoforms in these cells (Fig.4 b, lane 3). Thus, even though aspartate-mutant presenilins are nonfunctional (9Wolfe M.S. Xia W. Ostaszewski B.L. Diehl T.S. Kimberly W.T. Selkoe D.J.

Therefore, the assembly of γ-secretase does not require normal proteolytic function;i.e. the presence of inactive PS is sufficient to stabilize NCT. On the other hand, when we examined PS1-deficient fibroblasts derived from PS1 knockout mice, the amount of mature 150-kDa NCT was dramatically reduced (Fig. 4 c). This result strongly suggests that the ability of NCT to enter into the γ-secretase complex requires the presence of PS. In other words, in PS1 −/− fibroblasts, the limiting cofactor for γ-secretase is PS itself. In the absence of PS1 the complex cannot form, and NCT is apparently prevented from acquiring complex N-linked oligosaccharides. On long exposures, a small amount of mature NCT was still present in these cells (Fig. 4 c, lane 3), which may be because of the presence of the less abundant PS2 molecule. γ-Secretase is an unusual aspartyl protease that has resisted full elucidation. The data reported here yield new insights into the nature of its assembly and the maturation of two of its key components, PS and NCT. Both proteins exhibit conversions from immature to mature forms, and these conversions correlate with the formation of the active γ-secretase complex. For PS, endoproteolysis is generally required for entry into γ-secretase, although certain unusual mutations in or near the cleavage site of holo-PS can bypass that requirement (31Steiner H. Romig H. Pesold B. Philipp U. Baader M. Citron M. Loetscher H. Jacobsen H. Haass C. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 14600-14605Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). For NCT, complex N-linked glycosylation is associated with its incorporation into the active enzyme. Other groups have recently reported partly related findings on the maturation of NCT (25Leem J.Y. Vijayan S. Han P. Cai D. Machura M. Lopes K.O. Veselits M.L., Xu, H. Thinakaran G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 19236-19240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar,26Tomita T. Katayama R. Takikawa R. Iwatsubo T. FEBS Lett. 2002; 520: 117-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Both these studies convincingly demonstrated that the 150-kDa NCT is highly stable and is physically associated with PS1 (25Leem J.Y. Vijayan S. Han P. Cai D. Machura M. Lopes K.O.

FEBS Lett. 2002; 520: 117-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) (compare Fig. 3, a and b). We further show that the 150-kDa NCT is associated with functional γ-secretase molecules because our III-31C resin specifically enriches for active enzyme. Importantly, under limiting lysate conditions, we demonstrate that all mature NCT binds to the affinity resin (Fig. 3 c). Therefore, the NCT that possesses the full N-linked modification (150 kDa) is associated with active γ-secretase. With this affinity method, we also observed a very small amount of immature NCT that was precipitated by the matrix (see Fig. 3 c, lanes 3and 6). This result raises the possibility that immature NCT may associate with PS1 heterodimers just prior to the maturation (complex glycosylation) of NCT in the Golgi compartment. Our analysis of NCT function has additional implications for its function. We find that for any exogenously expressed NCT to enter into the γ-secretase complex, significant overexpression is required (see Fig. 4 a). These findings imply that cellular transfection methods used to study the functional effects of engineered mutations in either protein (particularly dominant negative ones) require substantial overexpression. This phenomenon has been observed previously for the dominant negative effect of the aspartate-mutant PS proteins (9Wolfe M.S. Xia W. Ostaszewski B.L. Diehl T.S. Kimberly W.T. Selkoe D.J. Nature. 1999; 398: 513-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (1685) Google Scholar, 14Steiner H. Duff K. Capell A. Romig H. Grim M.G. Lincoln S. Hardy J., Yu, X. Picciano M. Fechteler K. Citron M. Kopan R.

It further indicates that any functional effects of NCT mutations may not be appreciated without achieving expression sufficiently high to replace the endogenous mature (150 kDa) protein. Our data also demonstrate that at least one other cofactor for γ-secretase exists. Because CHO cells endogenously express excess amounts of both PS and NCT (i.e. immature forms of both proteins are present; see Fig. 4 b), we can assume the existence of one or more additional cofactor(s) that is likely to be limiting in this cell line. In this regard, the recently identifiedAPH-1 gene in C. elegans is an attractive candidate (32Goutte C. Tsunozaki M. Hale V.A. Priess J.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 775-779Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar). A loss-of-function mutation of this protein causes an identical phenotype to loss-of-function mutations in APH-2(the C. elegans NCT orthologue) (33Goutte C. Hepler W. Mickey K.M. Priess J.R. Development. 2000; 127: 2481-2492Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) or inSEL-12 (the PS orthologue) (10Levitan D. Greenwald I. Nature. 1995; 377: 351-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (627) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the absence of either Aph-1 or Sel-12/PS protein has been shown to prevent the normal distribution of Aph-2/NCT to the cell surface (32Goutte C. Tsunozaki M. Hale V.A. Priess J.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 775-779Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar). Our new results suggest that this altered localization may be due to the inability of the γ-secretase complex to assemble properly, thus preventing the maturation and stability of the remainder of its components, including Aph-2/NCT. Our results also have implications for the current hypothesis of the existence of a limiting cofactor for PS heterodimer formation (19Thinakaran G. Harris C.L. Ratovitski T. Davenport F. Slunt H.H. Price D.L. Borchelt D.R. Sisodia S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28415-28422Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). Because our III-31C resin can fully deplete mature PS and NCT (Fig.3 c), we propose that these are quantitatively associated members of γ-secretase that require the presence of each other. Indeed, the absence of PS1 in mouse embryonic fibroblasts limits the maturation and assembly of NCT into γ-secretase (see Fig.4 c). The converse is also true, as demonstrated by Huet al. (22Hu Y., Ye, Y. Fortini M.E. Dev. Cell. 2002; 2: 69-78Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar) when they recently showed that RNA interface of NCT destabilizes PS in Drosophila S2 cells. Therefore, depending on the cellular circumstances, NCT, PS, or the yet unidentified additional component(s) of the γ-secretase complex could act as the limiting cofactor that tightly regulates the formation of additional γ-secretase complexes. We consider it likely that the unidentified component(s) of γ-secretase is a quantitative member of the complex, although the possibility of a catalytic activator remains. In our model for the cooperative regulation of active γ-secretase the assembly, maturation, and stability of each of its components is interdependent. The exact nature of the complex and the identification of new strategies to inhibit γ-secretase activity will emerge as the entire protease is fully characterized and reconstituted. We thank W. P. Esler for providing III-31C resin, D. Walsh for providing initial Iodixanol gradient fractions, and both for helpful discussions. We also thank P.

Here we show that 8-(3-chlorostyryl)caffeine (CSC), a specific A2A antagonist closely related to caffeine, also attenuates MPTP-induced neurotoxicity. Because the neurotoxicity of MPTP relies on its oxidative metabolism to the mitochondrial toxin MPP+, we investigated the actions of CSC on striatal MPTP metabolism in vivo. CSC elevated striatal levels of MPTP but lowered levels of the oxidative intermediate MPDP+ and of MPP+, suggesting that CSC blocks the conversion of MPTP to MPDP+ in vivo. In assessing the direct effects of CSC and A2A receptors on monoamine oxidase (MAO) activity, we found that CSC potently and specifically inhibited mouse brain mitochondrial MAO-B activity in vitro with aK i value of 100 nm, whereas caffeine and another relatively specific A2A antagonist produced little or no inhibition. The A2A receptor independence of MAO-B inhibition by CSC was further supported by the similarity of brain MAO activities derived from A2A receptor knockout and wild-type mice and was confirmed by demonstrating potent inhibition of A2A receptor knockout-derived MAO-B by CSC. Together, these data indicate that CSC possesses dual actions of MAO-B inhibition and A2A receptor antagonism, a unique combination suggesting a new class of compounds with the potential for enhanced neuroprotective properties.

Lozano A.M. N. Engl. J. Med. 1998; 339: 1044-1053Crossref PubMed Scopus (1773) Google Scholar). In PD the progressive loss of striatal dopamine leads to a progressive deterioration in motor function. Despite the availability of dopamine-replacement strategies that generally offer considerable symptomatic relief early in the disease, as yet no therapy has been shown to slow the underlying neurodegenerative process. Adenosine A2A receptor antagonists recently have attracted attention as potential neuroprotective agents because of a remarkable convergence of epidemiological and laboratory data that link the A2A receptor to the development of PD (2Schwarzschild M.A. Chen J.-F. Ascherio A. Neurology. 2002; 58: 1154-1160Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Prospective studies of several large populations have shown that caffeine consumption is associated with a reduced risk of developing PD (3Ross G.W. Abbott R.D. Petrovitch H. Morens D.M.

The risk of PD decreased with increasing prior intake of coffee or of caffeine from other sources and was independent of smoking status or other potential confounding factors. Notably, consumption of decaffeinated coffee was not related to PD risk (4Ascherio A. Zhang S.M. Hernan M.A. Kawachi I. Colditz G.A. Speizer F.E. Willett W.C. Ann. Neurol. 2001; 50: 56-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar). The possibility that the reduced risk of PD among caffeine consumers is due to a neuroprotective effect of caffeine has been supported by our finding that caffeine can reduce dopaminergic neuron toxicity in a mouse model of PD (5Chen J.-F., Xu, K.

Low doses of caffeine can attenuate the loss of striatal dopamine and of dopamine transporter (DAT) binding sites induced by 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP). The neuroprotection by caffeine, a nonspecific adenosine receptor antagonist (6Fredholm B.B. Bättig K. Holmén J. Nehlig A. Zvartau E.E. Pharmacol. Rev. 1999; 51: 83-133PubMed Google Scholar), could be mimicked by relatively specific adenosine A2A receptor antagonists but not an A1 antagonist (5Chen J.-F., Xu, K. Petzer J.P. Staal R., Xu, Y.-H.

Together these laboratory data have suggested a potential neurobiological basis for the inverse association between caffeine use and PD. Here we examine the neuroprotective properties of 8-(3-chlorostyryl)caffeine (CSC), a selective and potent A2A antagonist closely related to caffeine (8Jacobson K.A. Nikodijevic O. Padgett W.L. Gallo-Rodriguez C. Maillard M. Daly J.W. FEBS Lett. 1993; 323: 141-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar) in the MPTP model of PD (9Gerlach M. Riederer P. J. Neural Transm. 1996; 103: 987-1041Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar). Because the neurotoxicity of MPTP requires its oxidation to the active toxin, the 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP+) species, by monoamine oxidase B (MAO-B), we investigated the effects of CSC on MPTP metabolism in vivoand on MAO activity in vitro. The results of these studies offer new insight into structure-activity relationships for MAO-B inhibitors and suggest a novel class of dual-function compounds with enhanced potential for the treatment of PD. Male C57Bl/6 mice (25–28 g; 2–3 months old) received a single intraperitoneal injection of 20–40 mg/kg MPTP·HCl (or saline) or four intraperitoneal injections of 20 mg/kg MPTP·HCl (or saline) two hours apart. Ten minutes prior to each MPTP dose mice were pretreated with CSC or vehicle (a fresh mixture of dimethyl sulfoxide (15%), ethoxylated castor oil (15%; Alkamuls EL-620, Rhodia, Cranberry, NJ), and water). A2A KO mice were generated using a standard displacement target vector as described previously (10Chen J.-F. Huang Z. Zhu J. Moratalla R. Stadaert D. Moskowitz M.A. Fink J.S. Schwarzschild M.A. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 192-200Google Scholar). Briefly, chimeric A2A KO mice (F0) derived from 129-Steel embryonic stem cells were bred to C57Bl/6 mice, resulting in mice of mixed C57Bl/6 × 129-Steel backgrounds. To effectively eliminate the potentially confounding influence of the 129-Steel background, the mixed line was then repeatedly back-crossed to pure C57Bl/6 mice over six generations yielding a near congenic (N6) C57Bl/6 line. A2A KO (−/−) and wild-type (WT, +/+) littermates (both male and female) from N6 heterozygote (±) intercrosses were used in this study. Seven days after treatment, mice were sacrificed by rapid cervical dislocation and assayed for striatal dopamine or serotonin content and [3H]mazindol (DAT) binding as described previously (5Chen J.-F., Xu, K.

Striatal concentrations of MPTP, MPDP+, and MPP+ were measured as described previously (5Chen J.-F., Xu, K. Petzer J.P. Staal R., Xu, Y.-H. Beilstein M. Sonsalla P.K. Castagnoli K. Castagnoli Jr., N.

Intact mitochondria prepared from C57BL/6 mouse brain and human placenta served as sources of MAO. The mitochondrial fractions were prepared as described by Salach and Weyler (12Salach J. Weyler J. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 142: 627-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) with minor modifications and were stored at −70 °C. Before use, the mitochondrial homogenate was suspended in sodium phosphate buffer (0.1 m, pH 7.4) containing 50% (w/v) glycerol. The protein concentrations (25–60 mg/ml) were determined by the method of Bradford (13Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 247-254Crossref Scopus (216178) Google Scholar). K m and V max determinations of the MAO-B-catalyzed oxidation of the MAO-B-selective substrate MPTP (25–400 μm) were carried out in brain mitochondrial preparations (final protein concentration of 0.3 mg protein/ml in 0.1 mm sodium phosphate buffer pH 7.4; 500 μl final volume; 30 min at 37 °C) obtained from WT and A2A KO mice (pooled tissues of three mice in each case; determinations in duplicate). The reactions were terminated by the addition of 20 μl of perchloric acid (70% v/v), and the samples were centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 5 min. The supernatant fractions were removed and assayed for the MAO-B-generated dihydropyridinium metabolite (MPDP+) by measuring the absorbance at 345 nm spectrophotometrically (ε = 16,000 m−1cm−1) (14Kalgutkar A. Castagnoli K. Hall A. Castagnoli Jr., N. J. Med. Chem. 1994; 37: 944-949Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 15Inoue H. Castagnoli K. Van der Schyf C. Mabic S. Igarashi K. Castagnoli Jr., N. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1999; 291: 856-864PubMed Google Scholar). The activity ratios of MAO-A to MAO-B were determined in mouse brain mitochondrial preparations from A2A KO and WT mice (each ratio represents averaged duplicate values from three separate animals). To measure MAO-B activity, the MAO-A present in the mouse brain mitochondria was inactivated by preincubating the preparation (1.2 mg of protein/ml) with 3.3 × 10−8mclorgyline hydrochloride, an MAO-A-selective inhibitor, for 15 min at 37 °C in 0.1 m, pH 7.4 sodium phosphate buffer (15Inoue H. Castagnoli K. Van der Schyf C. Mabic S. Igarashi K. Castagnoli Jr., N. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1999; 291: 856-864PubMed Google Scholar). This solution was added to an equal volume of a solution of the non-selective MAO-A/B substrate 1-methyl-4-(1-methylpyrrol-2-yl)-1,2,3,6-tetrahydroyridine (MMTP, final concentration of 2 mm) also in sodium phosphate buffer (500 μl final volume). Following a 30-min incubation period at 37 °C, the reactions were terminated by the addition of 20 μl of 70% perchloric acid. The resulting mixtures were centrifuged, and the concentrations of the enzyme-generated dihydropyridinium metabolite MMDP+ were measured spectrophotometrically at 420 nm (ε = 25 000 m−1 cm−1) (15Inoue H. Castagnoli K. Van der Schyf C. Mabic S. Igarashi K. Castagnoli Jr., N. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1999; 291: 856-864PubMed Google Scholar). MAO-A activity was estimated in the same way, using mouse brain mitochondria pretreated with the MAO-B-selective inhibitor (R)-deprenyl (3.3 × 10−7m) (15Inoue H. Castagnoli K. Van der Schyf C. Mabic S. Igarashi K. Castagnoli Jr., N. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1999; 291: 856-864PubMed Google Scholar). The total MAO activity was determined by carrying out this assay in the absence of inactivators. Studies on the inhibition of MAO-B by CSC, caffeine, 1,3-dipropyl-8-cyclopentylxanthine (CPX), and 3,7-dimethyl-1-propargylxanthine (DMPX) utilized the MAO-B-selective substrate MPTP (16Khalil A.A. Steyn S. Castagnoli Jr., N. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 2000; 13: 31-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The incubation mixtures (500 μl final volume in sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4) contained MPTP (30–90 μm), mouse brain mitochondrial homogenate (0.15 mg of protein/ml), and the appropriate concentrations of the compounds of interest. Caffeine was dissolved in sodium phosphate buffer. Because of limited water solubility, CSC, CPX, and DMPX were dissolved in 100% Me2SO and added to the buffered incubation mixtures such that the final Me2SO concentration was 4%. Previous studies in our laboratory have shown that solutions containing 4% Me2SO do not affect enzyme activity. The samples were incubated at 37 °C for 45 min, during which time the rate of oxidation of MPTP remained constant. The reactions were terminated by the addition of 20 μl of 70% perchloric acid, and the samples were centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 5 min. The supernatant fractions were removed and assayed for MPDP+ and MPP+ content using reverse phase high pressure liquid chromatography rather than spectrophotometrically because the CSC chromophore (λmax = 350 nm) overlapped with that of MPDP+ (λmax = 345 nm). The mobile phase consisted of 80% Milli-Q water (containing 0.6% (v/v) glacial acetic acid and 1% (v/v) triethylamine) and 20% acetonitrile at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. A volume of 200 μl of supernatant fraction was injected into the high pressure liquid chromatography system. MPDP+was monitored at 345 nm and MPP+ at 285 nm. Quantitative determinations of these metabolites were carried out with the aid of calibration curves that were prepared over the linear concentration ranges of interest (MPDP+, 0.8–3.0 μm; MPP+, 0.2–0.8 μm). These data were used to determine the initial velocity (V) of the MAO-B-catalyzed oxidation of MPTP. The double-reciprocal plots of 1/V (1/(rate of MPDP+ plus MPP+ formation)) versus1/(MPTP) with increasing concentrations of the inhibitor were constructed. The K i value (−x wheny = 0) was determined from a replot in which the values of the slopes obtained from these double reciprocal graphs were plotted against the concentration of the competitive inhibitor (x-axis) (17Segel I.H. Enzyme Kinetics. Wiley, New York1993: 100-125Google Scholar). Studies on the inhibition of MAO-A by CSC utilized the MAO-A/B non-selective substrate MMTP and human placental mitochondria, which express exclusively MAO-A (18Weyler W. Salach J. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 13199-13207Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Riley L.A. Waguespack M.A. Denney R.M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1989; 36: 54-60PubMed Google Scholar). Essentially the same protocol was followed as described above for the MAO-B inhibition studies with the exception that the incubation time was 15 min and the substrate concentrations ranged from 30 to 120 μm. The concentrations of the MAO-generated dihydropyridinium metabolite MMDP+ in the supernatant fractions were measured spectrophotometrically at a wavelength of 420 nm. K ivalues were determined as described above. Single statistical comparisons between two groups were performed using a non-paired two-tailed Student'st test. Analysis of dose-response relationships was performed by one-way analysis of variance followed by Dunnett'spost hoc comparisons. Data values present group averages ± S.E. The loss of striatal dopamine induced by MPTP (administered in four 20 mg/kg intraperitoneal doses two hours apart) in C57Bl/6 mice was significantly attenuated by CSC (5 mg/kg intraperitoneal 10 min prior to each MPTP dose; Fig.1 A, left panel). CSC also attenuated dopamine loss induced by a single high dose of MPTP·HCl (40 mg/kg), and it did so in a dose-dependent manner with complete protection observed at and above 20 mg/kg CSC (Fig. 1 B). In contrast to dopamine, serotonin levels in the striatum were not altered by MPTP (Fig. 1 A, right panel), highlighting the selectivity of the toxin for dopaminergic neurons. CSC had no effect on baseline levels of dopamine or serotonin in the striatum. In addition to a biochemical marker of nigrostriatal integrity (dopamine) DAT density in the striatum, an anatomical marker of nigrostriatal innervation, was also assessed. MPTP induced a loss of striatal DAT ([3H]mazindol) binding sites commensurate with that of striatal dopamine content. This loss was significantly attenuated by pretreatment with CSC (Fig. 1 C). Taken together with prior findings that mice pretreated with other specific A2A antagonists and those lacking functional A2A receptors showed reduced MPTP toxicity (5Chen J.-F., Xu, K. Petzer J.P. Staal R., Xu, Y.-H. Beilstein M. Sonsalla P.K. Castagnoli K. Castagnoli Jr., N. Schwarzschild M.A. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 1-6PubMed Google Scholar, 7Ikeda K. Kurokawa M. Aoyama S. Kuwana Y. J. Neurochem. 2002; 80: 262-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar), these data seem to suggest that CSC protects dopaminergic neurons by blocking A2A receptors. Moreover, the locomotor stimulating effect of 5 mg/kg CSC was completely blocked in A2A receptor knockout mice, 2J.-F. Chen and M. A. Schwarzschild, unpublished observations. lending further support to the possibility that the neuroprotective effect of CSC at this dose depends on its A2A antagonist properties. Because the neurotoxicity of MPTP requires its oxidation to the active toxin MPP+, we examined the effects of CSC pretreatment on MPP+ levels in the striatum (Fig.2 A). Mice were treated with vehicle or CSC 5 min prior to each of the four MPTP injections. 90 min after the last MPTP injection, striatal MPP+ levels were significantly lower in CSC-treated mice compared with those treated with vehicle. Thus CSC leads to decreased MPP+ levels in the striatum, which may contribute to its attenuation of MPTP toxicity. To investigate further the potential mechanism underlying attenuated MPP+ levels in the striatum, we also determined the effects of CSC on striatal levels of MPTP and MPDP+ following intraperitoneal MPTP treatment. After crossing the blood-brain barrier, MPTP is oxidized in a reaction catalyzed by MAO-B to yield the relatively unstable 1-methyl-4-phenyl-2,3-dihydropyridinium intermediate MPDP+, which in turn oxidizes further to the stable active toxin MPP+ (9Gerlach M. Riederer P. J. Neural Transm. 1996; 103: 987-1041Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar). 15 min after a single intraperitoneal injection of MPTP, striatal levels of MPTP and MPDP+ peak while striatal MPP+ levels are starting to rise (11Giovanni A. Sieber B.A. Heikkila R.E. Sonsalla P.K. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1991; 257: 691-697PubMed Google Scholar). Pretreatment with CSC (5 mg/kg) significantly increased MPTP levels and decreased both MPDP+ and MPP+ levels in striatum at 15 min post-MPTP administration (Fig. 2 B), an effect also seen with the MAO-B inhibitor, 7-nitroindazole (27Castagnoli K. Palmer S. Anderson A. Bueters T. Castagnoli Jr., N. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1997; 10: 1771-1773Google Scholar). To explore the in vivo metabolism of MPTP in the more complex (but pathophysiologically more relevant) multiple-dose toxin paradigm, we quantified striatal metabolites 15 min after the four injections of MPTP·HCl (20 mg/kg × 4, intraperitoneal, Fig.2 C). In this case striatal levels of MPTP and MPDP+ reflect principally the fate of the last dose of MPTP, whereas the level of MPP+ reflects the cumulative effects of the three prior injections (11Giovanni A. Sieber B.A. Heikkila R.E. Sonsalla P.K. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1991; 257: 691-697PubMed Google Scholar). As in the single injection study, 15 min after the fourth MPTP injection increased levels of MPTP and decreased levels of MPDP+ and MPP+ were observed in mice pretreated with CSC (5 mg/kg, before each MPTP dose) compared with mice pretreated with vehicle. Together these in vivo MPTP metabolite data indicate that CSC does not attenuate MPTP delivery to striatum; rather, it appears to attenuate striatal conversion of MPTP to MPDP+ and MPP+. By contrast, MPTP and MPDP+ levels are unaltered in the striatum of A2A KO compared with wild-type mice and in mice pretreated with the nonspecific adenosine antagonist caffeine compared with vehicle (5Chen J.-F., Xu, K. Petzer J.P. Staal R., Xu, Y.-H. Beilstein M. Sonsalla P.K. Castagnoli K. Castagnoli Jr., N. Schwarzschild M.A. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 1-6PubMed Google Scholar). The inhibition of MPTP metabolismin vivo by CSC but not by certain other antagonists of A2A receptors or by A2A receptor deficiency (5Chen J.-F., Xu, K. Petzer J.P. Staal R., Xu, Y.-H. Beilstein M. Sonsalla P.K. Castagnoli K. Castagnoli Jr., N. Schwarzschild M.A. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 1-6PubMed Google Scholar,7Ikeda K. Kurokawa M. Aoyama S. Kuwana Y. J. Neurochem. 2002; 80: 262-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar) suggests that A2A receptors do not regulate MAO-B activity and thus raises the possibility that CSC may act as an MAO-B inhibitor independent of its A2A antagonist properties. To investigate the possibility of a direct effect of CSC on MAO activity, we assayed mitochondrial MAO-A and MAO-B activities in the presence of CSC across a range of concentrations. Fig. 3 shows that CSC potently and competitively inhibits MAO-B activity in a mitochondrial preparation from mouse brain with a K ivalue of ∼100 nm, a value comparable with that of the most potent known competitive MAO-B inhibitors (20Krueger M.J. Mazoua F. Ramsay R.R. Milcent R. Singer T.P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Comm. 1995; 206: 556-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). In contrast to MAO-B, MAO-A (from human placenta) was not significantly inhibited by CSC. To determine whether other adenosine receptor antagonists also share this unexpected property of MAO-B inhibition we compared the effect of CSC with those of caffeine (a nonspecific adenosine receptor antagonist), DMPX (another relatively specific adenosine A2A receptor antagonist), and CPX (a relatively specific adenosine A1 receptor antagonist) on MAO-B activity. In studies using a mitochondrial preparation from mouse brain with MPTP as substrate, CSC potently inhibited MAO-B activity in vitrowith a K i of ∼100 nm, whereas caffeine, DMPX, and CPX produced little if any inhibition with estimated K i values of 0.7, 1, and ≥4 mm, respectively. These findings demonstrate that, in addition to its A2A antagonist properties, CSC also is a potent and selective inhibitor of MAO-B. Our observation that 1 μm CSC completely blocks MAO-B activity in primary cultures of brain glia, which express few if any A2Areceptors, further suggests the possibility that CSC inhibits MAO-B directly. 3K. Xu, J.-F. Chen, and M. A. Schwarzschild, unpublished data. Although the MAOs are not known to couple to receptors, the standard mitochondrial preparations used to identify the MAO inhibitory properties of CSC are likely to contain A2Areceptors through which CSC could indirectly inhibit MAO-B. The recent demonstration of an ultrastructural localization of A2Areceptors to intracellular organelle membranes within striatal neurons (21Hettinger B.D. Lee A. Linden J. Rosin D.L. J. Comp. Neurol. 2001; 431: 331-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar) underscores the need to address this possibility. To assess A2A receptor involvement in the effect of CSC on MAO-B, we took advantage of an A2A KO model of A2Areceptor function (10Chen J.-F. Huang Z. Zhu J. Moratalla R. Stadaert D. Moskowitz M.A. Fink J.S. Schwarzschild M.A. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 192-200Google Scholar). We first compared the MAO activities in the brains of A2A KO and WT mice using MMTP as substrate (TableI). Under V maxconditions in the presence of appropriate inhibitors, no significant difference was observed in the total MAO activity or the activities of MAO-A and MAO-B. In a separate experiment the K m andV max values of MAO-B-catalyzed oxidation of MPTP also were found to be indistinguishable in brain mitochondrial preparation from the A2A KO mice and WT littermates (TableI). The normal kinetics of MAO activity in A2A KO (as well as the absence of MAO inhibitory activity of the A2Aantagonist DMPX) argue against a modulatory effect of A2Areceptors on MAO-B activity.Table IComparing MAO-B activities in brain mitochondrial preparations from WT and A2A KO miceWTA2A KOt-testMAO activities1-anmol MMDP+ formed/min-mg mitochondrial protein.Total2.23 ± 0.151.95 ± 0.08p>0.1MAO-B1.68 ± 0.111.49 ± 0.09p>0.2MAO-A0.48 ± 0.050.41 ± 0.02p>0.2Michaelis-Menten parametersK m66.11 ± 2.271-bμM.66.64 ± 0.15p>0.8V max0.88 ± 0.021-cnmol MPDP+ metabolite formed/min-mg mitochondrial protein.0.87 ± 0.00p>0.6V max/K m13.27 ± 0.2113.01 ± 0.03p>0.31-a nmol MMDP+ formed/min-mg mitochondrial protein.1-b μM.1-c nmol MPDP+ metabolite formed/min-mg mitochondrial protein. Open table in a new tab We also examined the inhibitory effects of CSC on MAO-B activity of mitochondria prepared from the brains of A2A KO mice and their WT littermates. Fig. 4 shows that CSC is just as potent in its inhibition of A2A KO MAO-B as it is in its inhibition of WT MAO-B (with a K i of ∼100 nm for each). These data confirm the hypothesis that the novel MAO-B inhibitory action of CSC is independent of its well established antagonistic action on A2A receptors. A direct inhibition of MAO-B explains the reduction in the levels of MPDP+ and the active toxin MPP+ in vivo when systemic MPTP is administered with CSC (Fig. 2) but not with other A2A antagonists (5Chen J.-F., Xu, K. Petzer J.P. Staal R., Xu, Y.-H. Beilstein M. Sonsalla P.K. Castagnoli K. Castagnoli Jr., N. Schwarzschild M.A. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 1-6PubMed Google Scholar, 7Ikeda K. Kurokawa M. Aoyama S. Kuwana Y. J. Neurochem. 2002; 80: 262-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Thus, the neuroprotective effect of CSC in the MPTP model of PD may rely in part on this A2A receptor-independent inhibition of MAO-B. The unexpected finding of dual MAO-B inhibitory and A2Areceptor antagonistic function in a xanthine-derived structure may offer valuable biological and pharmacological insights and opportunities. The recently reported x-ray structure of MAO-B (28Binda C. Newton-Vinson P. Hubalik F. Edmondson D.E. Mattevi A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 9: 22-26Crossref Scopus (532) Google Scholar) together with further structure-function relationship studies now underway should help to identify possible relationships between the active sites of these two proteins. The pharmacological significance of a single structure capable of both MAO-B inhibition and A2A receptor antagonism is underscored by ongoing clinical trials that are based on these two individual anti-parkinsonian strategies. Moreover, the targeting of either of these proteins may be particularly beneficial in treating PD because both MAO-B inhibitors and A2A antagonists possess neuroprotective as well as symptomatic therapeutic potential (22Kanthasamy, A. G., Sharma, N., Kirby, M. L., and Schwarzschild, M. A. in Neuroprotection (Marwah, J., and Lo, E., eds) pp. 603–640, Prominent Press, Scottsdale, AZ.Google Scholar). The neuroprotective benefits of dual-function agents offering MAO inhibition and A2A antagonism may extend beyond PD because preclinical studies have suggested possible therapeutic effects of both MAO inhibitors and A2A antagonists in a range of neuropsychiatric disorders from stroke to depression (10Chen J.-F.

Br. J. Pharmacol. 2001; 134: 68-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). The recognition that CSC acts as an MAO-B inhibitor as well as an A2A antagonist also may help to explain an unexpected observation on the brain distribution of isotopically labeled CSC (25Marian T. Boros I. Lengyel Z. Balkay L. Horvath G. Emri M. Sarkadi E. Szentmiklosi A.J. Fekete I. Tron L. Appl. Radiat. Isot. 1999; 50: 887-893Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). This compound, which was designed as a positron emission tomography ligand for measuring A2A receptor density in humans, was found to label most heavily the relatively A2Areceptor-poor region of the ventral medulla in addition to the A2A receptor-rich striatum. That the ventral medulla contains a high density of serotonergic neurons known to express high levels of MAO-B (26Kitahama K. Denney R.M. Maeda T. Jouvet M. Neuroscience. 1991; 44: 185-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) fits well with the present finding that CSC acts on MAO-B as well as the A2A receptor. In conclusion, the present data indicate that CSC possesses dual actions of MAO-B inhibition and A2A receptor antagonism, a unique combination suggesting a new class of compounds with the potential for enhanced therapeutic potential in PD and other neuropsychiatric disorders."

Its presence in basement membranes such as Reichert′s membrane or the basement membrane-rich Engelbreth-Holm-Swarm tumor together with the size of 40 kDa led to the name BM-40 (4Dziadek M. Paulsson M. Aumailley M. Timpl R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1986; 161: 455-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). BM-40 is a modular protein composed of three independently folded domains. The N-terminal domain contains about 50 amino acids of which 18 are negatively charged. The second module is homologous to follistatin (FS)1 with 10 cysteines in a typical pattern. The C-terminal extracellular calcium-binding (EC) domain has two EF-hand calcium-binding motifs, each with a bound calcium ion in the x-ray structure (5Maurer P. Hohenadl C. Hohenester E. Göhring W. Timpl R. Engel J. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 253: 347-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 6Hohenester E. Maurer P. Hohenadl C. Timpl R. Jansonius J.N. Engel J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 67-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). The EC domain of BM-40 additionally contains a binding site for several fibrillar collagens and the basement membrane collagen IV (7Sasaki T. Hohenester E. Göhring W. Timpl R. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1625-1634Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). PDGF also interacts with the EC domain of BM-40 (8Göhring W. Sasaki T. Heldin C.-H. Timpl R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 255: 60-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) but in a calcium-independent manner, whereas collagen binding is calcium-dependent. Furthermore, the binding to PDGF is not influenced by the mutations that abolish collagen binding. The interaction of PDGF with BM-40 prevents binding to its receptor and thus growth factor signaling (9Raines W.E. Lane T.F. Iruela-Arispe M.L. Ross R. Sage H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Vascular endothelial growth factor was recently also shown to bind to BM-40 suggesting a general role in growth factor binding modulation (10Kupprion C. Motamed K. Sage H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29635-29640Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). BM-40 was reported to participate in the regulation of cell-matrix interactions, in particular influencing bone mineralization, wound repair, and angiogenesis. In vitro BM-40 inhibits cell adhesion, cell spreading, and cellular proliferation and regulates the expression of proteins involved in matrix turnover (reviewed in Ref.2Lane T.F. Sage E.H. FASEB J. 1994; 8: 163-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar). It is highly expressed in some malignant tumors and was reported to play a crucial role in the tumorogenicity of human melanomas (11Ledda M.F. Adris S. Bravo A.I. Kairiyama C. Bover L.

It is most similar to SC1/hevin, but the N-terminal domain is not conserved, and expression patterns are completely different. tsc36/Flik is a transforming growth factor β1-induced protein originally identified in osteoblasts and a glioma cell line (23Shibanuma M.

As with BM-40, the EC domain of testican-1 binds calcium; however, no collagen binding activity could be detected (32Kohfeldt E. Maurer P. Vannahme C. Timpl R. FEBS Lett. 1997; 414: 557-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Two glycosaminoglycan attachment sites are present in the C-terminal domain (24Alliel P.M. Perin J.P. Jolles P. Bonnet F.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 214: 347-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). In the adult mouse, it is prevalent at postsynaptic areas (33Bonnet F. Perin J.P. Charbonnier F. Camuzat A. Roussel G. Nussbaum J.L. Alliel P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4373-4380Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) and is developmentally regulated in the nervous system where it correlates with neuronal migration, axonal growth, and synaptogenesis (34Charbonnier F.

Similarly, in muscle development testican-1 becomes clustered at the neuromuscular junctions during postsynaptic differentiation (35Cifuentes-Diaz C. Alliel P.M. Charbonnier F. de la Porte S. Molgo J. Goudou D. Rieger F. Perin J.P. Mech. Dev. 2000; 94: 277-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). In man, testican-1 is expressed by neurons and by endothelial cells of a variety of tissues (36Marr H.S. Basalamah M.A. Edgell C.J. Endothelium. 1997; 5: 209-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). An unstable 130-kDa form is present in blood and converted to a smaller stable form by unidentified plasma serine proteases (37BaSalamah M.A. Marr H.S. Duncan A.W. Edgell C.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 283: 1083-1090Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). We recently identified three novel members of the BM-40 family, two of which share the domain organization of testican-1 and were termed testican-2 (38Vannahme C. Schübel S. Herud M. Gösling S. Hülsmann H. Paulsson M. Hartmann U. Maurer P. J. Neurochem. 1999; 73: 12-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) and -3 (39Hartmann U. Maurer P. Matrix Biol. 2001; 20: 23-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). The third protein has a unique domain organization and was termed SMOC-1, where SMOC stands forsecreted modular calcium-binding protein. The present work concerns its structure and expression. A human fetal brain cDNA library (CLONTECH) was screened with two 187- and 239-bp 32P-labeled StyI fragments isolated from the human synovial membrane EST clone 107131 (ATCC). Hybridization was carried out at 65 °C in aqueous solution (0.5 m sodium phosphate, pH 7.2, 7% SDS, 1 mm EDTA, 10% bovine serum albumin (BSA), and 0.2 mg/ml salmon sperm DNA). Filters were washed under low stringency conditions (40 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.2, and 1% SDS) once at 55 °C for 15 min and twice at 65 °C for 15 min. Positive plaques were excised and rescreened. Three plaques from the final rescreen were excised in vivo, yielding cDNA in the pDR2 vector. Plasmids were sequenced on both strands with flanking and internal primers using an ABI Prism Big Dye Terminator Cycle Sequencing Ready Reaction Kit, and the products were resolved on an ABI Prism 377 Automated Sequencer (PE Biosystems). Analysis of the nucleotide sequence and homology searches in the dbEST (40Boguski M.S. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 295-296Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar) and EMBL/GenBankTM data base were performed with the programs of the GCG package. Primers were designed to amplify cDNA fragments spanning the full-length cDNA of human SMOC-1. Forward primer 5′-GCCCGCTAGCCCACCGCACCACAGG-3′ introduced an NheI restriction site at the 5′ side, and the reverse primer 5′-CAATGACTCTCGAGCTAGACGAGGCGTCCTTC-3′ introduced a stop codon together with an XhoI restriction site. PCR-amplified cDNA was cloned in the pCRII vector (Invitrogen) and sequenced on both strands by cycle sequencing. NheI/XhoI restriction fragments of the pCRII-SMOC-1 plasmid were purified and cloned in the eukaryotic expression vector pCEP-Pu-His-Myc (41Wuttke M. Müller S. Nitsche P. Paulsson M. Hanisch F.-G. Maurer P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 36839-36848Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Correct insertion of the construct in the pCEP-Pu-SMOC-1 was verified by sequencing. Plasmids were transfected into the human fibrosarcoma cells HT-1080 using an electroporator (Bio-Rad) according to the instructions of the manufacturer. Growth and selection of transfected cells were carried out as described (32Kohfeldt E. Maurer P. Vannahme C. Timpl R. FEBS Lett. 1997; 414: 557-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Conditioned serum-free media of HT-1080 cells were collected and passed over a column of Talon Matrix (CLONTECH). Proteins were eluted in a linear gradient of 0–250 mm imidazole in 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.4, containing 300 mm sodium chloride. The yield of SMOC-1 was of the order of 500 μg/liter culture supernatant. Circular dichroism spectra were recorded in a Jasco model 715 circular dichroism spectropolarimeter at 25 °C in thermostated quartz cells of optical pathlength 1 mm. The molar ellipticity [Θ] (expressed in degrees·cm2·dmol−1) was calculated on the basis of a mean residue molecular mass of 110 Da. The Ca2+dependence of the circular dichroism spectrum was measured by addition of 2 mm CaCl2. Reversibility of the conformational change was tested by subsequent addition of 4 mm EDTA. A base line with buffer (5 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.4) was recorded separately and subtracted from each spectrum. Total RNA was extracted from various tissues of adult mice by the guanidinium-thiocyanate method (42Chomzynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Poly(A)+ RNA was prepared using Oligotex mRNA Midi Kit (Qiagen). 5-μg aliquots of poly(A)+ RNA from each tissue were electrophoresed on a 1% denaturing agarose gel and transferred onto Hybond-XL (Amersham Biosciences). A 546-bp probe was generated by NheI/DraIII-digestion of a PCR-amplified full-length construct using the forward primer 5′-GCCCGCTAGCCCACCGCACCACAGG-3′ and the reverse primer 5′-CAATGACTCTCGAGCTAGACGAGGCGTCCTTC-3′. This DNA fragment was labeled with [α-32P]dCTP following the manufacturer's instructions (Takara). Hybridization was performed in formamide mix (50% formamide, 5× SSPE (750 mm sodium chloride, 50 mm sodium dihydrogen phosphate, 5 mm EDTA), 5× Denhardt's (0.1% Ficoll, 0.1% polyvinylpyrrolidone, 0.1% BSA), and 1.5% SDS at 42 °C overnight. The blot was washed twice in 0.5× SSC (75 mm sodium chloride, 7.5 mm sodium citrate, pH 7.4), 0.1% SDS at 65 °C for 10 min and exposed overnight to a PhosphorImager photoplate (Amersham Biosciences). Reverse transcription was carried out with 500 ng of total RNA per tissue and reaction. In the first incubation RNA together with 13 pmol of the primer (5′-AAGGATCCGTCGACATCGATAATACGACTCACTATAGGGATTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTN-3′, N = A, C, T, or G) in a total volume of 6 μl was heated to 70 °C for 10 min and then chilled on ice. In a modification of the manufacturer's protocol first strand buffer (2 μl), dithiothreitol (0.1 m, 1 μl), and dNTPs (10 mm each, 0.5 μl) were added. Transcription was started by adding 0.5 μl of reverse transcriptase (Superscript II, Invitrogen) per reaction and incubated at 42 °C for 50 min. Negative controls for each tissue RNA were treated the same way without adding enzyme. Finally the reaction was inactivated by heating samples to 70 °C for 15 min. 35 cycles of PCR were performed with Amplitaq polymerase (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) using the forward primer 5′-CGTTGGTGTTGAAATCACAGC-3′ and the reverse primer 5′-CATCTTCTTCCCTTCAGGAC-3′ derived from the sequence of the mouse EST AA000223 (IMAGE consortium) under the following conditions: 0.5 min at 93 °C, 1 min at 57 °C, and 1.5 min at 72 °C. Authenticity of the PCR products was confirmed by direct sequencing of the purified PCR products. 20-μl aliquots of each PCR were electrophoresed on a 2% agarose gel using 0.5× TBE (45 mm Tris borate, pH 8.5, 1 mm EDTA) and stained with ethidium bromide. The agarose gel was incubated in denaturation solution (0.5 m sodium hydroxide, 1.5 m sodium chloride) for 30 min followed by renaturation (0.5 m Tris borate, pH 8.0, 1.5 msodium chloride) for 7 min and transferred overnight to Hybond-N membrane (Amersham Biosciences). Hybridization was carried out overnight in 1 m sodium chloride, 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1% SDS at 65 °C with a PCR-derived 391-bp probe that was labeled with [α-32P]dCTP as described. The blot was washed twice with 0.1× SSC (15 mm sodium chloride, 1.5 mm sodium citrate, pH 7.4) for 20 min at 65 °C and exposed to an x-ray film (New RX, Fuji) for 10–15 min. A rabbit was immunized with purified recombinant SMOC-1 (Pineda Antikörper Service). The antiserum did not react with any other known member of the BM-40 family in dot blots of native protein bound to nitrocellulose or in SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblot (results not shown). Serum-free cell culture supernatants were collected, and 1-ml aliquots were precipitated by the addition of 10 μl of Triton X-100 and 250 μl of 50% trichloroacetic acid in water. The pellets were dissolved in SDS-containing sample mixture and electrophoresed under reducing conditions in a 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. After electrophoretic transfer to nitrocellulose, SMOC-1 was detected with the antiserum to SMOC-1 followed by a secondary antibody coupled to horseradish peroxidase (Dako). The enzyme product was detected by chemiluminescence. For the removal of N-linked carbohydrates, recombinant SMOC-1 (1 μg) was digested in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, with 1 μl of PNGase F (200 milliunits/sample; Roche Molecular Biochemicals) at 37 °C for 2 h. A control sample was treated the same way without adding enzyme. Both samples were electrophoresed on a 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. Equal aliquots (1 ml) of serum-free cell culture supernatants were precipitated by the addition of 9 ml of ethanol. Pellets were dissolved in TBS, 1% SDS and incubated at 95 °C for 15 min. After dilution to 0.1% SDS with TBS, Nonidet P-40 was added up to 0.5%, and the sample was incubated at 37 °C overnight with 1 μl of PNGase F (200 milliunits/sample). A control sample was treated the same way without adding enzyme. Both samples were separated on a 4–15% gel under reducing conditions and subjected to immunoblotting using the antiserum against SMOC-1. To identify glycosaminoglycan chains, 250 ng of affinity purified SMOC-1 were incubated with either of the enzymes described below. Three μl of the respective reaction buffer was added in a 10-fold concentration, and digestions were performed at 37 °C overnight. Digestions with chondroitinase ABC (20 milliunits/sample; Seikagaku) were performed in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 50 mmNaCl, and 50 mm sodium acetate. Incubation with heparinase I (200 milliunits/sample; Sigma) and heparinase III (40 milliunits/sample; Sigma) was carried out in 20 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, and 4 mmCaCl2. TBS was used for incubation with keratanase II (18 milliunits/sample; Sigma). Untreated and digested samples were separated on a 4–15% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and subjected to immunoblotting using an antibody against the Myc epitope of the tag (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). The assessment of O-linked glycosylation was done using the digoxigenin glycan detection kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). 250 ng of affinity-purified SMOC-1 was treated with PNGase F as described above. Samples were separated on a 4–15% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and transferred to nitrocellulose. Further treatment was done according to the manufacturer's instructions. Freshly prepared mouse tissues were fixed for 1 h in 4% paraformaldehyde/PBS and after dehydration were embedded in paraffin. Microtome sections of 10 μm were cut, and the paraffin was removed. Epitopes were unmasked with bovine testes hyaluronidase (Sigma type IV-S, 300 μg/ml in PBS, pH 5.2, 30 min, 37 °C) and with proteinase K (5 μg/ml in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mmEDTA, 8 min, 37 °C) and again briefly fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde/PBS. After blocking with 1% BSA/TBS the sections were incubated with the rabbit antiserum to SMOC-1 followed by Cy-3-labeled anti-rabbit IgG (Dako) and observed under a Zeiss Axiophot fluorescence microscope. Pieces of 1-mm3 size from the renal cortex of mouse kidneys, soleus muscle, and ovary were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and 0.5% glutaraldehyde for 15 min, dehydrated in a graded series of ethanol up to 70%, and embedded in the acrylic resin LR-Gold (London Resin Company). For electron microscopy, ultrathin sections were cut with a Reichert ultramicrotome and collected on Formvar-coated nickel grids. The procedure has been described previously in detail (43Miosge N. Quondamatteo F. Klenczar C. Herken R. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 2000; 48: 229-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). 24-nm gold particles were prepared and directly coupled to the antibody against SMOC-1 according to procedures described previously (43Miosge N. Quondamatteo F. Klenczar C. Herken R. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 2000; 48: 229-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Tissue sections on nickel grids were incubated for 15 min at room temperature with PBS. Thereafter, the grids were incubated with gold-labeled antibodies against SMOC-1 diluted 1:50 with PBS for 1 h. The sections were rinsed with PBS, stained with uranyl acetate for 15 min, and lead citrate for 5 min and examined with a Zeiss (Leo EM906E) electron microscope. To exclude unspecific binding of the colloidal gold probes to anionic binding sites in tissue structures, control sections were incubated with the pure gold solution or with gold-coupled goat anti-rabbit antibodies (Medac) under the same conditions as described above. All controls were negative. Analysis of sequence homologies between expressed sequence tags (EST) and human BM-40/osteonectin/SPARC revealed a set of four different clones with a 37% identity at the amino acid level. The homologous region encompassed 55 amino acids which included an EF-hand calcium-binding motif. The presence of two cysteines in the helices of the EF-hand is characteristic for EF-hands of the BM-40 family (6Hohenester E. Maurer P. Hohenadl C. Timpl R. Jansonius J.N. Engel J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 67-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). To investigate whether this may represent a novel member of the BM-40 protein family, we used a cDNA fragment of an EST derived from human synovial membrane to probe a human fetal brain cDNA library. We could isolate three different clones (Fig.1 A). Clone I contained an insert of 3669 bp with an open reading frame of 1302 bp, a 5′-untranslated region (UTR) of 254 bp, and a 3′-UTR of 2113 bp. The insert of clone II (1143 bp) covered nucleotides 1034–2176 of the full-length cDNA. The insert of clone III apparently had a mixed origin with only nucleotides 1172–1366 being identical to clone A. The 5′-UTR has a high GC content and lacks a TATA box. At the end of the 3′-UTR (residues 3648–3653) a consensus polyadenylation signal (AATAAA) is present. The isolated cDNA encodes a putative protein sequence of 434 amino acids with a calculated molecular mass of 48.2 kDa (Fig.1 B). Because of its modular composition and the presence of a calcium-binding domain (see below), we propose to call this novel gene product SMOC-1 for secreted modularcalcium-binding protein-1. A stretch of 26 amino acids at the N terminus of human SMOC-1 conforms well with the signal peptide consensus and ends with a signal peptidase cleavage site (44Nielsen H. Engelbrecht J. Brunak S. von Heijne G. Protein Eng. 1997; 10: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (4942) Google Scholar). SMOC-1 has no transmembrane-spanning hydrophobic region and is secreted from transfected cells. Mature SMOC-1 consists of 408 amino acids. Scrutiny of the sequence and comparison with other proteins allows the distinction of five domains, a follistatin-like FS domain, a thyroglobulin-like TY domain, a domain unique to SMOC-1, a second TY domain, and an EC domain (Fig. 2). Residues 27–89 are homologous to the canonical FS domain. FS is composed of two subdomains with the second being similar to the Kazal domain (45Hohenester E. Maurer P. Timpl R. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3778-3786Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). The first six cysteines of SMOC-1 can be aligned to cysteine residues 4–10 of the FS domain of BM-40 but also to the elastase inhibitor that represents an example of a “nonclassical” Kazal domain (46Tschesche H. Kolkenbrock H. Bode W. Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler. 1987; 368: 1297-1304Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3). The sequence similarity of the N-terminal domain of SMOC-1 is somewhat higher to the FS domain than to the Kazal domain, although the FS domain has an extension absent in both SMOC-1 and Kazal domains.Figure 3Structure-based alignment of SMOC-1 and related proteins. The sequence was aligned to the sequence of the FS and EC domains of BM-40, to the Kazal domain of the elastase inhibitor (46Tschesche H. Kolkenbrock H. Bode W. Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler. 1987; 368: 1297-1304Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), and the TY domain of p41 (48Guncar G. Pungercic G. Klemencic I. Turk V. Turk D. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 793-803Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Secondary structural elements as revealed by the structures of BM-40 (45Hohenester E. Maurer P. Timpl R. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3778-3786Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar) and p41 (48Guncar G. Pungercic G. Klemencic I. Turk V. Turk D. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 793-803Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar) are given below the consensus with β-sheets, α-helices, and EF-hands marked. Numbers above the sequence indicate the predicted disulfide bonds based on the disulfide linkage in BM-40 and thyroglobulin. Identical or conserved amino acids are shown on ablack or shaded background, respectively. Calcium-coordinating residues are marked by arrows.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) C-terminal to the FS domain, two TY domains (residues 90–160 and 226–293) are separated by 65 amino acids without homology to any known protein. The high content of aromatic amino acids implies that this region forms a folded domain with a hydrophobic core. A potentialN-glycosylation site is present at Asn-214. The TY domains contain six cysteine residues including a characteristic CWCV tetrapeptide sequence (47Molina F. Bouanani M. Pau B. Granier C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 240: 125-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The structure of the TY domain of p41, the invariant chain of the major histocompatibility class II complex, was recently solved (48Guncar G. Pungercic G. Klemencic I. Turk V. Turk D. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 793-803Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). The TY domain was defined by a first subdomain with a short α-helix-β-strand arrangement and a second subdomain with three strands forming a short antiparallel β-sheet. Both subdomains are stabilized by internal disulfide bonds. The structure-based alignment shows that all six cysteine residues and the features of secondary structure are conserved in both TY domains of SMOC-1 (Fig. 3). The C-terminal domain of SMOC-1 is homologous to the EC domain of BM-40, the characteristic amphipathic α-helix and the helix-loop-helix motifs of two EF-hands being conserved. However, in contrast to the EC domain of BM-40, which contains a variant EF-hand in addition to a canon"
https://openalex.org/W2129114790,"Abstract In hippocampal neurons, the exocytotic process of α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazoleproprionic acid (AMPA)-type glutamate receptors is known to depend on activation ofN-methyl-d-aspartate channels and its resultant Ca2+ influx from extracellular spaces. Here we found that brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) induced a rapid surface translocation of AMPA receptors in an activity-independent manner in developing neocortical neurons. The receptor translocation became evident within hours as monitored by [3H]AMPA binding and was resistant against ionotropic glutamate receptor antagonists as evidenced with surface biotinylation assay. This process required intracellular Ca2+ and was inhibited by the blockers of conventional exocytosis, brefeldin A, botulinum toxin B, andN-ethylmaleimide. To explore the translocation mechanism of individual AMPA receptor subunits, we utilized the human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells carrying the BDNF receptor TrkB. After the single transfection of GluR2 cDNA or GluR1 cDNA into HEK/TrkB cells, BDNF triggered the translocation of GluR2 but not that of GluR1. Subsequent mutation analysis of GluR2 carboxyl-terminal region indicated that the translocation of GluR2 subunit in HEK293 cells involved its N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor-binding domain but not its PDZ-interacting site. Following co-transfection of GluR1 and GluR2 cDNAs, solid phase cell sorting revealed that GluR1 subunits were also able to translocate to the cell surface in response to BDNF. An immunoprecipitation assay confirmed that BDNF stimulation can enhance the interaction of GluR2 withN-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor. These results reveal a novel role of BDNF in regulating the surface expression of AMPA receptors through a GluR2-NSF interaction."

Despite its brevity and broad distribution the E-Box is a remarkably versatile sequence that affects many different genetic programs, including proliferation, differentiation, tissue-specific responses, and cell death. The circadian clock is one of the latest pathways shown to employ this element. In this context, E-Boxes are likely to play a key role in establishing the robust waves of gene expression characteristic of circadian transcription. The regulatory flexibility of the E-Box hinges on the sequence ambiguity allowed at its core, the strong influence of the surrounding sequences, and the recruitment of spatially and temporally regulated E-Box-binding factors. Therefore, understanding how a particular E-Box can accomplish a specific task entails the identification and systematic analysis of these cis- and trans-acting E-Box modifiers. In the present study we compared the E-Box-containing minimal promoters of vasopressin andcyclin B1, two genes that can respond to the transcriptional oscillators driving the circadian clock and cell cycle, respectively. Results of this comparison will help elucidate the manner in which discreet DNA modules associate to either augment or restrain the activation of potential circadian E-Boxes in response to competing regulatory signals.

By extension, an enhancer (E)1-Box can be defined as a “transcriptional homograph”: a short DNA element (word) that, depending upon the features of the sequence and cellular environment (context), can dispense very different transcriptional outputs (messages). By recruiting the proto-oncogene c-myc, for example, an E-Box can drive cells to become growth factor independent, to speed through G1 of the cell cycle, to avoid differentiation, or, paradoxically, to undergo apoptotic death (1Littlewood T.

Obviously, the sequence context surrounding an E-Box must also play a role in ushering different promoters toward different patterns of expression, an issue that has been the subject of extensive studies. The vast amount of data collected as a result of these efforts revealed a complex picture in which the position and number of E-Boxes (28Desbarats L. Gaubatz S. Eilers M.

Biol. 1991; 11: 2439-2450Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), all combine to achieve a particular effect. The involvement of an E-Box in the regulation of gene expression by the circadian clock was first recognized during the analysis of rhythmic expression of the period gene in Drosophila (35Hao H. Allen D. Hardin P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3687-3693Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Several additional examples have been discovered since (9Jin X. Shearman L. Weaver D. Zylka M. de Vries G. Reppert S. Cell. 1999; 96: 57-68Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (779) Google Scholar, 26Darlington T. Wager-Smith K. Ceriani K. Staknis D. Gekakis N. Steeves T.

Baler R. Mol. Brain Res. 2000; 81: 43-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), and the E-Box element is now considered a central integrator within the transcription-translation loop (TTL) that constitutes the circadian clock, even though the contextual features required to place an E-Box under circadian control are yet to be defined. One important characteristic shared by known circadian E-Boxes is their ability to specifically recruit a BMAL1·CLOCK (B/C) complex (9Jin X. Shearman L. Weaver D. Zylka M. de Vries G. Reppert S. Cell. 1999; 96: 57-68Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (779) Google Scholar, 25Hogenesch J., Gu, Y. Jain S. Bradfield C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Science. 1998; 280: 1564-1569Crossref PubMed Scopus (1520) Google Scholar). This fact, however, should immediately shift our attention to the still unknown features that form the basis for a productive interaction between a circadian E-Box and the B/C heterodimer. Efforts to characterize the E-Box in the context of clock-controlled genes (CCGs) have not yet provided a clear understanding of the sequence constraints imposed upon the region flanking a circadian E-Box (39Wang G. Ousley A. Darlington T. Chen D. Chen Y., Fu, W. Hickman L. Kay S. Sehgal A. J. Neurobiol. 2001; 47: 161-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 40McDonald M. Rosbash M. Emery P. Mol. Cell.

Rosato E. J. Biol. Rhythms. 2000; 15: 483-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). It is clear that in most cases reported so far, multiple and seemingly randomly spaced E-Boxes appear to be needed to support circadian transcription (36Ripperger J. Shearman L. Reppert S. Schibler U. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 679-689PubMed Google Scholar, 40McDonald M. Rosbash M. Emery P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 1207-1217Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). This apparent requirement, however, is certainly not sufficient, because many non-circadian promoters feature multiple E-Boxes. Thus, clock and non-clock controlled gene promoters must enforce additional rules for E-Box utilization to attract or deflect a circadian input. It is also likely that specific bases must be present in the flanking sequence to support high affinity binding of a B/C complex, as suggested by a consensus derived throughin vitro studies (25Hogenesch J., Gu, Y. Jain S. Bradfield C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5474-5479Crossref PubMed Scopus (615) Google Scholar). However, it is not presently clear how this flanking consensus might affect the circadian competence of a perfect E-Box in its natural environment. Here we probed the nature of these rules by systematically assessing the contribution of the sequence context toward the dramatic differences in B/C responsiveness displayed by vasopressin(AVP) and cyclin B1 (CYC) gene promoters. Despite the presence of a perfect E-Box in both promoters and at very similar locations, these two genes are subject to significantly different modes of transcriptional regulation. The AVP promoter has been shown conclusively to be under circadian regulation by the B/C heterodimer in the rodent suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) (9Jin X. Shearman L. Weaver D. Zylka M. de Vries G. Reppert S. Cell. 1999; 96: 57-68Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (779) Google Scholar, 26Darlington T. Wager-Smith K. Ceriani K. Staknis D. Gekakis N. Steeves T. Weitz C. Takahashi J. Kay S. Science. 1998; 280: 1599-1603Crossref PubMed Scopus (682) Google Scholar). Elsewhere in the hypothalamus, transcription of the AVP gene is also modulated by systemic hypertonicity and hypotension (44Bargmann W. Scharrer E. Am. Sci. 1951; 39: 255-259PubMed Google Scholar). On the other hand, the CYC promoter responds to cell cycle (45Hwang A. Maity A. McKenna W. Muschel R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28419-28424Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar) and USF transcriptional activity (46Cogswell J. Godlevski M. Bonham M. Bisi J. Babiss L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2782-2790Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Interestingly, it has been suggested that cyclin B1 expression might also be affected by clock-related mechanisms (47Bjarnason G. Jordan R. Sothern R. Am. J. Pathol. 1999; 154: 613-622Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Our results highlight how different informational units along the DNA can combine to modify the circadian performance of a perfect E-Box. A mouse AVP-luciferase reporter (AA) was constructed by splicing a PCR-generated fragment (positions 1263–1460 in GenBankTM accession number M88354) between theNheI and BglII sites in pGL3-Basic (Promega, Madison, WI). The human CYC-luciferase reporter (CC) was produced by placing a PvuII to BglII human cyclin B1 promoter fragment (positions 671–873 in GenBankTM accession numberU36838), derived from pGL2-upcB (a gift from Ruth Muschel, University of Pennsylvania), between the SacI andBglII sites in pGL3 Basic. The mouse CLOCK and human BMAL1 mammalian expression vectors (cytomegalovirus promoter-driven) were generously provided by Drs. N. Gekakis and C. Weitz (Harvard University). Mammalian expression vectors for human USF-1 and mouse USF-2 (SV40 promoter-driven) were a gift from Dr. M. Sawadogo (University of Texas). Mutant versions of the Luciferase reporter constructs were generated by site-directed mutagenesis (GeneEditor, Promega) or standard recombinant DNA techniques using the following strategies. The PmlI restriction sites at the center of the E-boxes in the AA and CC reporters were used to target the 40-bp-long sequences (centered around each E-Box) of the opposite promoter to generate the A(C)A and C(A)C constructs. These PmlI sites were also used as transition points to generate the chimeric promoter constructs AC and CA. The following changes were introduced to mutagenize various cis-acting elements in the AVP promoter (core E-Box sequence in bold): E-Box1, CACGTG to CACAAGTG; E-Box2, CAGATG to CAGAAATG; AP-1, TGAATCA to TCGAGCA; CRE, CTGCTGACAGCT to CTTCTAGACAGCT; E-Box3, CACGTT to CTCGAG; E-Box4, CACCTG to CAGCTG; AA4A, CCACGTG to ACACGTG; AA6T, GCCCACGTG to TCCCACGTG; AA4A6T, GCCCACGTG to TCACACGTG; AA12C, CACTGACACGCCCACGTG to GCAGAGGCAGACCACGTG; AA6C, CACGCCCACGTG to GCAGACCACGTG. For the construction of the CAA reporter the first 31 bp of the CC promoter were placed immediately upstream of the AA promoter. CC+3/4 and AC+3/4 were generated by inserting a 43-bp-long double-stranded (ds) fragment containing the third and fourth E-Boxes of the AA promoter into the BstAPI site in the CC promoter, located 87 bp downstream of the perfect E-Box. Truncated AVP promoter vectors −27AA, −22AA, −12AA, and −8AA were constructed by replacing a SmaI-HindIII fragment in the original AA vector, which starts at position −48 relative to the center of the E-Box, with a high fidelity PCR-generated fragment containing the 24, 19, 9, or 5 bp immediately upstream of the E-Box, respectively. For construction of pGL3P/AVP-E and pGL3P/CYC-E, the same 40-mer sequences mentioned above were inserted into the SmaI site of a pGL3Promoter luciferase reporter vector (Promega). NIH-3T3 cells (ATCC, CRL-1658) were plated at a density of 3 × 104 cells per well in a 24-well plate (Costar, Cambridge, MA) and transfected 24 h later with a mixture containing LipofectAMINE/Plus (1.25 μl/2.5 μl) reagents (Invitrogen), 5 ng of reporter plasmid DNA, and 0.5 μg of a 1:1 expression vector mixture (BMAL1/CLOCK or USF1/2) or carrier pcDNA in 50 μl of Vitacell Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (ATCC, no. 30–2002) without fetal bovine serum. On the following day, 0.5 ml of culture medium (Vitacell Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, supplemented 10% fetal bovine serum) was added to the cells, which were harvested 24 h later. Differences in transfection efficiency were taken into account by measuring the enzyme activity generated by a co-transfected thymidine kinase promoter-driven Renilla luciferase (RL) plasmid (0.5 ng). Plasmid DNA for transfection was prepared using the Qiagen kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). We were able to corroborate high levels of expression for Clock, USF1, and USF2 proteins by Western blot analysis using the following antibodies: anti-Clock (Novus Biologicals, Littleton, CO), anti-USF1 SC-8983, and anti-USF2 SC-862 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA). Expressed levels of BMAL1 appeared significantly lower, either due to the intrinsic instability of this protein or the weakness of the various available anti-BMAL1 antibodies that we used (anti BMAL1, Affinity Bioreagents, Inc., Golden, CO; SC-8614 and SC-8550, Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Expression of functional BMAL1 (and CLOCK) proteins was confirmed in preliminary experiments in which the simultaneous transfection of both expression vectors was an absolute requirement for transactivation of the AVP promoter through its perfect E-Box. Firefly luciferase (FL) and Renilla luciferase enzyme activities were measured using the Stop and Glo kit (Promega) following the manufacturer's recommendations. Unless otherwise indicated, results depict a single representative experiment of at least two independent experiments performed in triplicates. Statistical analysis was performed by a Student's t test for unpaired samples. EMSA was performed as previously described (38Chen W. Baler R. Mol. Brain Res. 2000; 81: 43-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) with some modifications. To prepare nuclear extracts, 1 × 106 NIH-3T3 cells were seeded in 10-cm plates and harvested when they reached 100% confluence. Nuclear extracts were prepared with the NE-PER nuclear and cytoplasmic extraction reagent (Pierce) following the manufacturer's recommendations, except that the extraction buffers were supplemented with aprotinin, pepstatin, leupeptin (at 1 μg/ml each), 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 mm NaF. Synthetic, staggered-ended oligonucleotides (Integrated DNA Technologies, Coralville, IA) ranged from 30 to 45 bp in length. Probes were radiolabeled by a fill-in reaction with Klenow enzyme (Roche) and [α-32P]dCTP (Fig. 2, A and B) and gel purified on an 8% polyacrylamide gel before use. For supershifting experiments, 1 μl of affinity-purified rabbit polyclonal antisera (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) against either USF2 (sc-862 X) or c-Fos (sc-7202 X) was added to the binding assay reaction mixture 30 min before the addition of the radiolabeled probe (100,000 cpm). For blocking experiments, 1 μl of the appropriate antiserum was preincubated for 2 h at 4 °C with 0.8 μg of the immunizing or a control peptide (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) in a 5 μl final volume of 1× phosphate buffered saline. The pre-blocked antibody was then added to the binding assay reaction as described above. For competitive EMSA, 1 μl of an unlabeled double-stranded oligonucleotide stock solution was added to the pre-incubation mixture to achieve final concentrations of between 10- and 2000-fold molar excess. Electrophoresis was performed for 2 h at 4 °C in a vertical 5% TGE (40 mm Tris, 200 mm glycine, 2.4 mm EDTA) native polyacrylamide gel. At the end of the run the gel was removed, dried, and exposed to a PhosphorImager screen (Amersham Biosciences) for later quantitation using the ImageQuantTM software package. To expose the features that distinguish a “circadian” E-Box we compared the mouse AVP (48Hara Y. Battey J. Gainer H. Brain Res. Mol. Brain. Res. 1990; 8: 319-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) and human CYC (12Farina A. Gaetano C. Crescenzi M. Puccini F. Manni I. Sacchi A. Piaggio G. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 1287-1296PubMed Google Scholar) promoters. These upstream regulatory regions contain a single perfect E-Box at similar positions relative to the transcription start points (Fig. 1 A). First we assessed the responsiveness of these two E-Box-containing minimal promoters toward BMAL1/CLOCK- and USF1/USF2-mediated transactivation by transient co-transfection of an AVP or CYC-driven FL reporter gene into NIH-3T3 cells (Fig.1 B, compare AA versus CC). Because E-Boxes can affect many transcription processes the data is presented as basalversus induced (corrected) levels of reporter gene activity (horizontal bars) as well as stimulation index (numerical values). Consistent with previous reports (9Jin X. Shearman L. Weaver D. Zylka M. de Vries G. Reppert S. Cell. 1999; 96: 57-68Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (779) Google Scholar, 38Chen W. Baler R. Mol. Brain Res. 2000; 81: 43-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), the AA construct was strongly stimulated by B/C, an effect that was dependent upon the presence of both transcription factors (data not shown). In sharp contrast, the CC construct was completely refractory to the co-expression of the circadian heterodimer. This clear difference forms the basis for the model we used in this study to investigate the defining features of a representative circadian E-Box. The consistently higher level of basal activity observed in the CC construct reflects the fact that this promoter is strongly induced during the G2/M phase of the cell cycle (45Hwang A. Maity A. McKenna W. Muschel R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28419-28424Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Thus, cells traversing this mitotic point in an asynchronous culture can support significant levels of cyclin B1 gene transcription. The analysis of multiple independent experiments shows that the AVP minimal promoter was stimulated by a factor of 21 ± 6 (fold ± S.D.; range 22.1;n = 17), although the CYC promoter was unresponsive to B/C stimulation (0.8 ± 0.2; fold ± S.D.; range 0.8;n = 17). Because both reporters were strongly induced after overexpression of the ubiquitous E-Box-dependent transcription factor referred to as USF (49Luo X. Sawadogo M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 1308-1313Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar), the dramatic difference between the AA and CC vectors, with regards to B/C-dependent induction, suggests that the B/C complex can somehow distinguish between these two E-Boxes. Although total levels of USF-induced luciferase activity were comparable between the AVP and CYC promoters (103 ± 3 and 94 ± 15, respectively, for the experiment shown in Fig. 1 B), the stimulation indices differed significantly due to the higher basal level of activity in CC (38-fold versus 3-fold), as noted above. We have systematically assessed the USF response of all the chimeric and mutant promoters generated for this study. For the sake of simplicity, however, only the most informative and/or relevant data is presented or mentioned. The differential response of the AVP and CYC E-Box-containing sequences to the overexpression of B/C could result from different affinities for various DNA-binding factors. To test this notion we compared the ability of two double-stranded oligonucleotides (underlinedsequences in Fig. 1 A), centered around the AVP and CYC E-Boxes, to recruit DNA-binding factors in an electrophoretic mobility shift assay (Fig. 2 A). As expected, both sites were able to generate robust and specific nucleoprotein complexes when mixed with NIH-3T3 nuclear extracts as the source of E-Box-binding factors (Fig. 2 A, first lane in both panels). A preliminary test with several antibodies revealed that the vast majority of nucleoprotein complexes formed between the AVP or CYC E-Box probes and NIH-3T3 nuclear extracts contained a USF-2 related moiety (Fig. 2 A, only the results of anti-c-Fos and anti-USF-2 antibodies are shown). Despite the overall similarity in the patterns generated by the two probes, we noticed that the AVP E-Box-dependent nucleoprotein complex was consistently weaker. This suggested a relatively lower affinity of the AVP E-Box for the dominant binding factor in the extract (i.e. USF-2-related) because the specific activities of the two probes were identical, and the free probe was present in large excess. Consistent with this interpretation, a cold CYC E-Box extended sequence was approximately twice as efficient as a cold AVP E-Box competitor at displacing either the AVP E-box or CYC E-Box probe from the USF-2-related complex (Fig. 2 B). As shown above, the extended AVP and CYC E-Boxes can bind USF-2-like factors in vitro with apparently different affinities and respond very differently to B/C stimulation when operating from within their natural environments. These differences notwithstanding, both the AVP and CYC E-Box-containing fragments were weakly responsive to B/C stimulation when placed in the context of the SV40 promoter (Fig.2 C). This result indicates that high affinity of an extended E-Box site for an abundant factor (such as USF-2) may not be sufficient to preclude a low level of B/C responsiveness by a perfect E-Box, although it might contribute to the establishment of refractoriness in the proper context. Such an extended sequence, in isolation, may be unable to support robust stimulation of a true circadian E-Box (such as AVP) or prevent the marginal but significant level of transactivation latent in a non-circadian E-Box (CYC). Moreover, when the 40-mer E-Box containing sequences derived from AA and CC were wedged in the middle of the opposite E-Box, the resulting C(A)C and A(C)A constructs responded in the same general direction as the original CC and AA promoters, respectively (Fig. 2 D). Specifically, A(C)A displayed a robust level of induction even though the stimulation index was lower than AA due to increased basal activity. In contrast, C(A)C was unable to mount a response to B/C. This result suggests that most of the observed sensitivity to B/C is either granted or blunted by DNA elements located beyond the inserted fragments. The following experiments were designed to systematically search for these cis-acting modifiers of E-Box activity. First, we focused on the 5′ flanking region by converting different portions of the AA promoter into the equivalent CC sequences. We found that CA, which carries a CYC-derived 5′ flanking region, displays a lower level of basal activity relative to CC but a CC-like refractoriness toward B/C (Fig. 3 A). The dramatic effect observed after switching the 5′ region was reversed when the AVP-5′ sequence was used to push the CYC 5′ sequence away from the E-Box (CAA). This result makes the existence of a potent B/C repressor in the 5′ CC region less likely. On the other hand, when increas"

Nurr1 binds DNA as a monomer and exhibits constitutive transcriptional activity. Nurr1 can also regulate transcription as a heterodimer with the retinoid X receptor (RXR) and activate transcription in response to RXR ligands. However, the specific physiological roles of Nurr1 monomers and RXR-Nurr1 heterodimers remain to be elucidated. The aim of this study was to define structural requirements for RXR-Nurr1 heterodimerization. Several amino acid substitutions were introduced in both Nurr1 and RXR in the I-box, a region previously shown to be important for nuclear receptor dimerization. Single amino acid substitutions introduced in either Nurr1 or RXR abolished heterodimerization. Importantly, heterodimerization-deficient Nurr1 mutants exhibited normal activities as monomers. Thus, by introducing specific amino acid substitutions in Nurr1, monomeric and heterodimeric properties of Nurr1 can be distinguished. Interestingly, substitutions in the RXR I-box differentially affected heterodimerization with Nurr1, retinoic acid receptor, thyroid hormone receptor, and constitutive androstane receptor demonstrating that the dimerization interfaces in these different heterodimers are functionally unique. Furthermore, heterodimerization between RXR and Nurr1 had a profound influence on the constitutive activity of Nurr1, which was diminished as a result of RXR interaction. In conclusion, our data show unique structural and functional properties of RXR-Nurr1 heterodimers and also demonstrate that specific mutations in Nurr1 can abolish heterodimerization without affecting other essential functions.

Because these cells degenerate in patients with Parkinson's disease the identification of natural or synthetic ligands modulating Nurr1 activity may be of importance for the treatment of Parkinson's disease and/or other disorders associated with defective dopamine neurotransmission (9Buervenich S. Carmine A. Arvidsson M. Xiang F. Zhang Z. Sydow O. Jonsson E.G. Sedvell G. Leonard S. Freedman R. Chowdari K. Nimogaonkar V.L. Perlmann T. Anvert M. Olson L. Am. J. Med.

Two closely related orphan receptors, NGFI-B (NR4A1) and Nor1 (NR4A3), are also expressed in the central nervous system as well as in several peripheral tissues in both overlapping and distinct regions and cell types. Thus, these three orphan receptors are likely to exert both unique and redundant functions in vivo.Nurr1 binds DNA as a monomer and can recognize a NR binding site referred to as NGFI-B response element (NBRE). As a monomer, Nurr1 promotes constitutive transcriptional activation that is dependent on two distinct activation functions (AF1 and AF2) localized in the amino- and carboxyl-terminal regions of Nurr1, respectively (10Wilson T.E. Fahrner T.J. Johnston M. Milbrandt J. Science. 1991; 252: 1296-1300Crossref PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar, 11Castro D.S. Arvidsson M. Bondesson Bolin M. Perlmann T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37483-37490Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). In addition, Nurr1 can form heterodimers with the 9-cis-retinoic acid receptor RXR. These heterodimers recognize a DNA-binding site composed of two consensus NR binding motifs organized as direct repeats separated by five nucleotides (DR5). RXR cannot be efficiently activated by its cognate ligands in complex with most NR partners, e.g. retinoic acid receptor (RAR) and thyroid hormone receptor (TR). In contrast, RXR is efficiently activated by its ligands in RXR-Nurr1 heterodimers (12Perlmann T. Jansson L. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 769-782Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar, 13Forman B.M. Umesono K. Chen J. Evans R.M. Cell. 1995; 81: 541-550Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (566) Google Scholar). Nurr1 may thus be important for signaling in response to natural RXR ligands such as 9-cis-retinoic acid and docosahexaenoic acid (14Mata de Urguiza A. Liu S. Sjöberg M. Zetterström R.H. Griffiths W. Sjövall J. Perlmann T. Science. 2000; 290: 2140-2144Crossref PubMed Scopus (642) Google Scholar). Importantly, the closely related receptors NGFI-B and Nurr1 are equally efficient in promoting RXR activation, whereas Nor1 is unable to form heterodimers with RXR (15Zetterström R.H. Solomin L. Mitsiadis T. Olson L. Perlmann T. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 1656-1666Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar).Heterodimerization of RXR with e.g. RAR, TR, or the vitamin D receptor depends on two dimerization interfaces localized in the DNA-binding and the ligand-binding domains (LBD), respectively. The strongest interaction occurs via the dimerization interface in the LBD and has been mapped to a region in the carboxyl-terminal part of the domain, corresponding to helices 9 and 10 in the canonical nuclear receptor LBD structure (I-box) (Refs. 16Perlmann T.

The purpose of this study has been to identify residues in both Nurr1 and RXR that are important for heterodimerization. Our experiments have resulted in the generation of Nurr1 mutants that can be used to discriminate between monomeric and heterodimeric functions.DISCUSSIONThe ability of Nurr1, and its close relative NGFI-B, to activate transcription both as a monomer and heterodimer with RXR is a unique property within the nuclear receptor family. As a consequence, the physiological phenomena regulated by Nurr1 are probably modulated not only by signals affecting the activity of Nurr1 but also by ligands binding to the dimerization partner RXR. Characterization of the structural requirements for dimerization presented in this study has generated mutants that can distinguish between monomericversus heterodimeric activities. We envision that this will prove useful in attempts to understand the physiological roles of these two forms of Nurr1. Ultimately, analyses of mice in which the wild-type allele of Nurr1 is replaced by one of the dimerization deficient derivatives of Nurr1 will allow definitive elucidation of the in vivo significance of RXR-Nurr1 heterodimers.The results firmly identified the I-box of Nurr1 as critical for heterodimerization with RXR. Importantly, all analyzed Nurr1 I-box mutants functioned as fully active monomers demonstrating that the overall protein conformation was not disrupted by these mutations. This conclusion was supported by the finding that neither DNA binding to the NBRE nor βRE as monomers was affected (Fig. 3 B and data not shown). Notably, the Nurr1 mutant K554A/L555A/L556A was even more efficient in activating transcription as a monomer than the wild-type Nurr1 for reasons that remain to be examined.We cannot exclude that additional residues outside of the I-box modulate dimerization with RXR. Indeed, this seems likely based on comparison with the closely related receptor Nor1. Nor1, which is unable to heterodimerize with RXR, differs slightly in the I-box region from Nurr1 and other heterodimerizing receptors. However, substituting Nor1 I-box amino acids for the corresponding Nurr1 residues did not allow heterodimerization with RXR demonstrating that additional differences in amino acid composition outside of the I-box are important for the ability of Nurr1 to interact with RXR.Several amino acids are conserved in RXR heterodimerizing nuclear receptors. However, an important finding in this study was the demonstration that different RXR heterodimers have structurally unique dimerization interfaces. Thus, several mutations abolishing heterodimerization with Nurr1 did not disrupt dimerization with RAR, TR, and CAR. These unique properties may reflect functional differences in the behavior of different heterodimers. For example, ligand binding has been reported to regulate heterodimerization of RXR with both RAR and TR (28Collingwood T.N. Butler A. Tone Y. Clifton-Blight R.J. Parker M.G. Chatterjee K.K. J. Biol.

In contrast, 9-cis-retinoic acid did not significantly affect RXR-Nurr1 heterodimerization (Fig.5 A).RXR-Nurr1 heterodimers have the capacity to bind both DR5 and NBRE response elements (Figs. 2 A and 6 A) (12Perlmann T. Jansson L. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 769-782Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar, 13Forman B.M. Umesono K. Chen J. Evans R.M. Cell. 1995; 81: 541-550Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (566) Google Scholar). Heterodimerization on both response elements requires intact I-box regions in both receptors. As shown here, unliganded RXR can suppress the constitutive activity of Nurr1 bound to the NBRE. It is also interesting to note that constitutive activation is not observed when Nurr1 is binding to the βRE (Fig. 2) (12Perlmann T. Jansson L. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 769-782Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar). This is presumably due to the more efficacious heterodimerization with RXR on βRE elements and is consistent with the suppressive activity of apoRXR. RXR does not repress Nurr1 by squelching of common coactivator proteins because the RXR AF2 mutant unable to interact with coactivators was fully capable of repressing Nurr1. Moreover, suppression does not seem to depend on the interaction between RXR and transcriptional corepressor proteins as mutations abolishing RXR corepressor interactions did not influence to ability to suppress Nurr1. Furthermore, heterodimerization with RXR does not prevent Nurr1 DNA binding. Thus, it seems most likely that RXR heterodimerization hinders recruitment of Nurr1 coactivators,e.g. by a mechanism involving steric hindrance. Alternatively, heterodimerization can induce a conformation of Nurr1 that is non-permissive for coactivator interactions.Due to its crucial role in the midbrain dopaminergic neurons, Nurr1 is a highly interesting target for the development of pharmacological compounds aiming at the treatment of disorders involving dopamine transmission such as Parkinson's disease. Currently, neither endogenous nor pharmacological Nurr1 ligands have been identified. In theory, either Nurr1 monomers, RXR-Nurr1 heterodimers, or both may be useful as drug targets. The mutants identified in this study should prove valuable in ligand screening in distinguishing between ligands activating either Nurr1 alone or RXR-Nurr1 heterodimers.

We cannot exclude that additional residues outside of the I-box modulate dimerization with RXR. Indeed, this seems likely based on comparison with the closely related receptor Nor1. Nor1, which is unable to heterodimerize with RXR, differs slightly in the I-box region from Nurr1 and other heterodimerizing receptors. However, substituting Nor1 I-box amino acids for the corresponding Nurr1 residues did not allow heterodimerization with RXR demonstrating that additional differences in amino acid composition outside of the I-box are important for the ability of Nurr1 to interact with RXR. Several amino acids are conserved in RXR heterodimerizing nuclear receptors. However, an important finding in this study was the demonstration that different RXR heterodimers have structurally unique dimerization interfaces. Thus, several mutations abolishing heterodimerization with Nurr1 did not disrupt dimerization with RAR, TR, and CAR. These unique properties may reflect functional differences in the behavior of different heterodimers. For example, ligand binding has been reported to regulate heterodimerization of RXR with both RAR and TR (28Collingwood T.N. Butler A. Tone Y. Clifton-Blight R.J. Parker M.G. Chatterjee K.K. J. Biol.

RXR-Nurr1 heterodimers have the capacity to bind both DR5 and NBRE response elements (Figs. 2 A and 6 A) (12Perlmann T. Jansson L. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 769-782Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar, 13Forman B.M. Umesono K. Chen J. Evans R.M. Cell. 1995; 81: 541-550Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (566) Google Scholar). Heterodimerization on both response elements requires intact I-box regions in both receptors. As shown here, unliganded RXR can suppress the constitutive activity of Nurr1 bound to the NBRE. It is also interesting to note that constitutive activation is not observed when Nurr1 is binding to the βRE (Fig. 2) (12Perlmann T. Jansson L. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 769-782Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar). This is presumably due to the more efficacious heterodimerization with RXR on βRE elements and is consistent with the suppressive activity of apoRXR. RXR does not repress Nurr1 by squelching of common coactivator proteins because the RXR AF2 mutant unable to interact with coactivators was fully capable of repressing Nurr1. Moreover, suppression does not seem to depend on the interaction between RXR and transcriptional corepressor proteins as mutations abolishing RXR corepressor interactions did not influence to ability to suppress Nurr1. Furthermore, heterodimerization with RXR does not prevent Nurr1 DNA binding. Thus, it seems most likely that RXR heterodimerization hinders recruitment of Nurr1 coactivators,e.g. by a mechanism involving steric hindrance. Alternatively, heterodimerization can induce a conformation of Nurr1 that is non-permissive for coactivator interactions. Due to its crucial role in the midbrain dopaminergic neurons, Nurr1 is a highly interesting target for the development of pharmacological compounds aiming at the treatment of disorders involving dopamine transmission such as Parkinson's disease. Currently, neither endogenous nor pharmacological Nurr1 ligands have been identified. In theory, either Nurr1 monomers, RXR-Nurr1 heterodimers, or both may be useful as drug targets. The mutants identified in this study should prove valuable in ligand screening in distinguishing between ligands activating either Nurr1 alone or RXR-Nurr1 heterodimers."

S. agalactiae, similarly to other Gram-positive pathogens, produces a variety of virulence factors, some of which are exposed on the surface of bacterial cell. In addition to the primary virulence factor of this organism, the polysaccharide capsule, there are several known surface-accessible proteins expressed by the bacterium that significantly contribute to the total virulence of this organism. An example of such a surface-exposed protein virulence factor of S. agalactiae is hyaluronate lyase. The primary function of this enzyme is the degradation of hyaluronan (HA),1 the predominant polysaccharide component of animal connective tissues and nervous system. The final hyaluronan degradation product by the enzyme is the unsaturated disaccharide unit of HA, 2-acetamido-2-deoxy-3-O-(β-d-gluco-4-enepyranosyluronic acid)-d-glucose (ΔDi-HA) (1Li S. Kelly S.J. Lamani E. Ferraroni M. Jedrzejas M.J. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1228-1240Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). The S. agalactiae bacterial strains that produce more extracellular hyaluronate lyase were shown to be more virulent than those strains producing less of this enzyme, although these strains are usually asymptomatic in humans (2Musser J.M. Mattingly S.J. Quentin R.T. Goudeau A. Selander P.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 4731-4735Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar, 3Rolland K. Marois C. Siquier V. Cattier B. Quentin R. J. Clin. Microbiol. 1999; 37: 1892-1898Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This property together with additional studies suggests that hyaluronate lyase action may account for the major part of the mortality and mortality/morbidity associated with theS. agalactiae infection in humans.Hyaluronan, the main substrate for hyaluronate lyase, is composed of linear polymeric repeats of a few hundred to a few thousand disaccharide units of hyaluronic acid, d-glucuronic acid(1-β-3)N-acetyl-d-glucosomine(1-β-4). HA is detectable in every studied tissue and fluid in higher animals and in humans (4Laurent T.C. Fraser R.E. FASEB J. 1992; 6: 2397-2404Crossref PubMed Scopus (2051) Google Scholar). It forms a strikingly viscoelastic matrix, which in part serves as a medium for connective tissue cells. In vivodegradation and metabolism of HA occur at high rates, often higher than those for other polysaccharides. The HA degradation and metabolism is highly active as compared with degradation and metabolism of other polysaccharides in vivo. In humans, approximately one-third of the total hyaluronan (about 5 g) is turned over on a daily basis (5McCourt P.A.G. Matrix Biol. 1999; 18: 427-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Such a rapid turnover rate was found to facilitate the role of HA and its degradation products in many physiological processes such as cell differentiation and embryo development (6Toole B.P. Goldberg R.L. Chi-Rosso G. Underhill C.B. Orkin R.W. Trelstad R.C. The Role of Extracellular Matrix in Development. Alan R. Liss, Inc., New York1984: 43-66Google Scholar), cell proliferation, recognition, locomotion, tumor development, and the immunological responses (4Laurent T.C. Fraser R.E. FASEB J. 1992; 6: 2397-2404Crossref PubMed Scopus (2051) Google Scholar).Enzymes from either mammalian or bacterial origin degrade HA mainly at the β1,4 linkages found between the disaccharide components of this polymer. Bacteria usually secrete hyaluronate lyases, which degrade HA by the β-elimination process and produce unsaturated di-, tetra-, or hexasaccharide units, whereas mammals express hyaluronidases, which degrade HA by the hydrolysis mechanism, and they produce relatively longer oligosaccharide units of HA of various sizes. The details of the mechanism of HA degradation by mammalian hyaluronidases are still largely unknown primarily because of the lack of structural information about these enzymes. Nevertheless, hyaluronidases of bovine origin, for example, are widely used in clinics as an additive to the local anesthesia for the faster spreading and penetration through tissues of selected medications (7Courtiss E.H. Ransil B.J. Russo J. Plast. Reconstr. Surg. 1995; 95: 876-883Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8Menzel E.J. Farr C. Cancer Lett. 1998; 131: 3-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). It is likely that mammalian hyaluronidases, similar to other hydrolytic polysaccharide-degrading enzymes, utilize the direct or double displacement mechanism to degrade their substrate (9Jedrzejas M.J. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2000; 35: 221-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Based on structural information, the mechanism of hyaluronan degradation by Streptococcus species hyaluronate lyase was recently proposed and was termed proton acceptance and donation (1Li S. Kelly S.J. Lamani E. Ferraroni M. Jedrzejas M.J. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1228-1240Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 10Li S. Jedrzejas M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 41407-41416Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). This degradative process was shown to proceed through a processive mode of action (11Baker J.R. Pritchard D.G. Biochem. J. 2000; 348: 465-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) and to involve hyaluronan degradation in the direction from the reducing to the non-reducing end of the substrate (10Li S. Jedrzejas M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 41407-41416Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar).The native structure of the S. agalactiae hyaluronate lyase and the structure of its complex with the disaccharide product of degradation, ΔDi-HA, were recently elucidated by means of x-ray crystallography (10Li S. Jedrzejas M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 41407-41416Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The structures showed that the enzyme is built from three distinct domains. Starting from the N terminus these domains are as follows: a β-sheet βI-domain, an α-helical α-domain, and another β-sheet domain termed βII. The proton acceptance and donation mechanisms of action of this enzyme were proposed based on these structural data, the modeling studies of hyaluronan, the site-directed mutagenesis studies (12Pritchard D.G. Trent J.O., Li, X. Zhang P. Egan M.L. Baker J.R. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 2000; 40: 126-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), and the comparison toStreptococcus pneumoniae hyaluronate lyase (1Li S. Kelly S.J. Lamani E. Ferraroni M. Jedrzejas M.J.

The amino acid residues of the enzyme involved in this process were identified, and their specific roles and function in catalysis were suggested. Here we report a structure of the complex between theS. agalactiae hyaluronate lyase and the hexasaccharide unit of hyaluronan and the extensive computational analysis of the dynamic and flexibility properties of this enzyme. This information is then related to the mechanism of catalysis and the mechanism of processivity of hyaluronan degradation by bacterial hyaluronate lyases.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONStructure Solution and RefinementPrevious modeling analysis of the streptococcal hyaluronate lyases (1Li S. Kelly S.J. Lamani E. Ferraroni M. Jedrzejas M.J. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1228-1240Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 10Li S. Jedrzejas M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 41407-41416Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) suggested that the hexasaccharide hyaluronan substrate is the longest unit of hyaluronan that would completely fit within the catalytic cleft of the enzyme. Therefore, this substrate was chosen for structural studies. The hexasaccharide hyaluronan substrate was produced in milligram quantities from a human umbilical cord hyaluronan utilizing Streptomyces hyalurolyticus hyaluronate lyase degradation of polymeric hyaluronan as described under “Experimental Procedures” and as reported previously (1Li S. Kelly S.J. Lamani E. Ferraroni M. Jedrzejas M.J. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1228-1240Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 17Kelly S.J. Taylor K.B., Li, S. Jedrzejas M.J.

A. 1990; 46: 585-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (599) Google Scholar).The crystallization of the native enzyme, crystal soaking with the hexasaccharide hyaluronan, x-ray diffraction data collection and processing, and structure solution and refinement were performed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The data collected in Table I indicate a well refined structure with good stereochemistry. In a Ramachandran plot (25Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thorton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar), the vast majority of the residues is located in the most favored areas, and none is in the disallowed region of the plot. The crystal structure was solved at 2.20 Å resolution (Fig. 1). The crystallized protein corresponds to residues Ala171 to Ile984 in the full-length enzyme (10Li S. Jedrzejas M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 41407-41416Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 14Jedrzejas M.J. Chantalat L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol.

The structure of the current complex contains residues His173to Ile984 that were visible in the electron density; two N-terminal residues and three groups of residues Phe714–Asp721, Asp813–Ser818, and Asn886–Asp889 constituting three breaks in the structure, totaling up to 19 amino acid residues, were not observed in the electron density maps and therefore were not included in the final model of the structure. All three breaks in the observed electron density and in the structure are located in the surface loops, and the analysis of the electron density maps clearly suggests a disorder present in these parts of the structure. The electron density was clear for the remainder of the structure, including the hyaluronan substrate molecule (Fig. 1). The structure of the complex contains only 191 ordered water molecules that could be located during the final stages of refinement in addition to protein and the hexasaccharide hyaluronan substrate molecule. There was only one substrate molecule bound per molecule of the enzyme.Description of the Structures of the Enzyme and HyaluronanThe structure of the enzyme in the current complex is very similar to the structure of the native protein (10Li S. Jedrzejas M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 41407-41416Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The enzyme, and its structure, is composed of three domains connected only by two short peptide linkers that are 7 and 11 amino acid residues long (Fig.1 A). These domains are from the N terminus as follows: the first N-terminal β-sheet domain (βI-domain), a central α-helical domain (α-domain), and the second C-terminal β-sheet domain (βII-domain). The α-domain is the primary catalytic domain and has an α5/α5-barrel structure (Fig.1 A). One end of this domain assumes the shape of a deep and elongated cleft, and it faces the βII-domain. The cleft is where the hyaluronan substrate, including the hexasaccharide, binds and where the catalytic residues are located (10Li S. Jedrzejas M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 41407-41416Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar).The consecutive disaccharide building blocks of the HA hexasaccharide that bind in the cleft are termed HA1, HA2, and HA3 starting from the reducing end (Figs. 1, A and C, and2 A). The hexasaccharide hyaluronan substrate assumes a helical like conformation with approximately a quarter of the turn accomplished by the three disaccharides of the current substrate. The individual sugar rings are in the expected chair conformation with the exception of the terminal sugar ring of the HA3 disaccharide that assumes a puckered structure resembling in part a distorted half-chair conformation. The temperature factors for the substrate are relatively high which reflects significant mobility of the substrate in the cleft.Figure 2Enzyme-hyaluronan substrate interactions.

The steps for of the catalytic process are graphically shown using the ribbon drawing of the enzyme and a ball and stick rendition rendering of hyaluronan and their respective complexes. The major steps are as follows: (i) enzyme binding to the hyaluronan substrate, (ii) catalytic degradation of hyaluronan substrate resulting in polymeric hyaluronan and a disaccharide product, (iii) hydrogen exchange with microenvironment, (iv) disaccharide product release from the active site of the enzyme, and (v) translocation of the truncated hyaluronan substrate into the catalytic position.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The substrate binds in the cleft formed by the opening in one end of the α5/α5 barrel structure. The cleft has an elongated shape with dimensions similar to those of the native enzyme structure (1Li S. Kelly S.J. Lamani E. Ferraroni M. Jedrzejas M.J. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1228-1240Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 10Li S. Jedrzejas M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 41407-41416Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The major interactions between the hexasaccharide substrate and the amino acid residues of the cleft are listed in Table II and are shown in Fig.2 A. Specifically, the residues of the catalytic group, Asn429, His479, and Tyr488, take part in interactions with the chemical groups of the substrate as well as with other amino acid residues of the enzyme (Fig. 2, Aand B) (10Li S. Jedrzejas M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 41407-41416Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The interactions of His479 and Tyr488 with the catalytically involved groups of the substrate are significantly longer than expected due to the widely open form of the cleft that likely is narrowed down during catalysis (see the enzyme flexibility section below). There are, however, no other residues present in close proximity to hyaluronan's either O4 glycosidic oxygen, C5 carbon, or the carboxyl group of the glucuronate (O6 and O7 oxygen atoms) of HA1 that could take part in the catalysis and substitute for any one of the three catalytic residues, Asn429, His479, and Tyr488. The three water molecules observed in the cleft, Wat1, Wat2, and Wat3, are not involved in catalysis as they are significantly separated from the catalytic residues, and they primarily interact only with the HA3 disaccharide of the substrate (Fig. 2 A and Table II). The residues of the negative patch located at the non-reducing end of the cleft, Glu468, Asp478, and Thr480, do not participate in any significant interactions with HA for the same reason as do the catalytic residues (widely open cleft). In addition, the hydrophobic patch residues located just next to the catalytic residues, Trp371, Trp372, and Phe423, are involved in interactions predominantly with the hydrophobic ring structures of the HA1 and HA2 disaccharides of the substrate but not HA3 (Fig. 2 A). These interactions are likely responsible for the precise positioning of HA1 and HA2 disaccharides of hyaluronan for catalysis. Once this precise positioning is accomplished, all three catalytic residues are in the appropriate distances and in proper arrangement for the catalytic process to proceed forward (Fig.2 B).Table IIMajor interactions between hyaluronate lyase residues and the hexasaccharide hyaluronan substrateHexasaccharide/water atomsEnzyme/water residues and atomsDistanceNAc12-aGlcA1, GlcA2, and GlcA3 denote the β-d-glucuronic acid of HA1, HA2, and HA3 of hexasaccharide HA, whereas NAc1, NAc2, and NAc3 denoteN-acetyl-β-d-glucosamine of HA1, HA2, and HA3, respectively. of HA1C2ÅC3Arg416 NH12.98O3Arg416 NH23.73O6Trp371NE13.68O7Phe423 CG3.97O7Arg416 NH13.21Asn421OD13.80GlcA1 of HA1C2Trp371NE13.52C5His479 NE25.68O2Trp371 NE13.66O3Asn370OD13.89O4 (glycosidic oxygen)Tyr488 OH6.14O6 (glucuronate CO2)Asn429 ND23.90O7 (glucuronate CO2)Asn429 OD15.31NAc2 of HA2C5Trp372 CD23.50C6Trp372 CB3.36Asn370ND23.32C7Tyr488 OH3.83Arg542 NH23.81C8Tyr488OH2.80Arg542 NH23.89O4Trp372 CZ33.54O6Asn370ND22.68O7Arg542 NH23.00Asn660 ND23.97GlcA2 of HA2C4Wat13.03C6Trp372CZ23.35Arg380 NH23.52O6 (glucuronate CO2)Arg380 NH12.80Trp372CZ23.45Asp432 OD14.00O7 (glucuronate CO2)Arg321 NH13.54Trp372CH22.93Arg380 NH23.74Wat12.93NAc3 of HA3C5Arg380 NH24.10C8Arg380 NH13.05Wat23.72O7Wat33.87GlcA3 of HA3C3Lys598 CB3.49C4Asn596 ND23.83Lys598CG3.47Arg560 NH23.72C5Arg560 NH23.77C6Arg560NH23.30Wat33.86O3Lys598CB3.14O4Asn596 ND23.09Arg560 NH12.93Lys598CG3.45O5Wat33.81O6 (glucuronate CO2)Glu557 OE23.28Arg560NH22.86Wat32.81O7 (glucuronate CO2)Asn596 ND23.53Arg560NH13.99The symbols assigned to the substrate atoms follow standard chemical nomenclature for sugar molecules (see Fig. 2B).

The precise functionality of the βI domain has still not been fully determined and described (10Li S. Jedrzejas M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 41407-41416Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). However, these results indicate that the presence of this domain does not affect the fluctuations in the other two domains of the protein (domain α and βII), suggesting that the βI domain is not directly involved in the main protein function, binding and degradation of hyaluronan substrate. These results agree with experimental observations, because protein activity remained essentially the same when this first domain was removed (14Jedrzejas M.J. Chantalat L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect.

This approach allows for the comparison of the two hyaluronate lyases from different streptococcal species without including the βI domain of S. agalactiae HL enzyme.Flexibility of the Enzyme in the Presence and Absence of the Hexasaccharide SubstrateA combined ED analysis of CONCOORD simulations, with and without hexasaccharide substrate, showed that the main modes of collective fluctuation were remarkably similar and, therefore, were only moderately affected by the presence of the hyaluronan substrate. Interestingly, the third eigenvector (the collective mode of fluctuation with the third highest amplitude) describes a closure motion of the two domains (domains α and βII) similar to the difference observed between the previously reportedS. agalactiae HL and S. pneumoniae HL x-ray structures (see Fig. 3). In summary, the protein is on average in a more closed configuration in the presence of the hyaluronan substrate, i.e. the protein structure apparently closes around the substrate.Figure 3DynDom analysis of the difference between theS. pneumoniae and S. agalactiaehyaluronate lyase x-ray crystal structures.

The COOH-terminal two-thirds of golgin-160 is predicted to form a coiled-coil, with an NH2-terminal “head” domain. To identify the Golgi targeting information in golgin-160, full-length and deletion constructs tagged with green fluorescent protein were generated. The head domain alone was targeted to the Golgi complex in the absence of assembly with endogenous golgin-160. Further truncations from both ends of the head domain narrowed the Golgi targeting information to 85 amino acids between residues 172 and 257. Surprisingly, certain truncations of the head domain also specifically accumulated in the nucleus. Both a nuclear localization signal (masked in the full-length protein) and information for nuclear retention contributed to the nuclear localization of these truncations. Because the golgin-160 head is cleaved by caspases during apoptosis, we examined the localization of epitope-tagged proteins corresponding to all potential caspase cleavage fragments. Our data suggest that three of six fragments could be targeted to the nucleus, provided that they are released from Golgi membranes after cleavage. The finding that both Golgi and nuclear targeting information is present in the same region of golgin-160 suggests that this protein may have more than one function.

Initially identified as a component of the detergent-insoluble Golgi matrix, GM130 was later found to bind to GRASP65, a cis-Golgi membrane protein required for stacking of Golgi cisternae in vitro(18Barr F.A. Puype M. Vandekerckhove J. Warren G. Cell. 1997; 91: 253-262Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). During mitosis, phosphorylation of GM130 is crucial for proper disassembly of the Golgi (19Lowe M. Gonatas N.K. Warren G. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 341-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). GM130 also binds to the vesicle docking protein, p115, and to Rab1, a GTPase required for endoplasmic reticulum-to-Golgi transport (20Nakamura N. Lowe M. Levine T.P. Rabouille C. Warren G. Cell. 1997; 89: 445-455Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar, 21Moyer B.D. Allan B.B. Balch W.E. Traffic. 2001; 2: 268-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). In addition, giantin binds p115 suggesting the presence of a complex that tethers Golgi cisternae containing GM130 to giantin on vesicles via p115 (22Linstedt A.D. Jesch S.A. Mehta A. Lee T.H.

Disruption of GM130-giantin tethering complexes inhibits transport through the Golgi, and causes the accumulation of transport vesicles (23Seemann J. Jokitalo E.J. Warren G. Mol. Biol.

Chem. 2001; 276: 2693-2700Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Taken together, these observations suggest that golgins couple Golgi structure to Golgi function.Recently, golgin-160 was shown to be a caspase substrate during programmed cell death (25Mancini M. Machamer C.E. Roy S. Nicholson D.W. Thornberry N.A. Casciola-Rosen L.A. Rosen A. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 603-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). Golgin-160 is predicted to form a characteristic coiled-coil structure in the COOH-terminal two-thirds of the protein, with an NH2-terminal non-coiled-coil (head) domain. Although the normal function of golgin-160 is unknown, the cleavage of the head domain during apoptosis is required for efficient apoptotic disassembly of the Golgi (25Mancini M. Machamer C.E. Roy S. Nicholson D.W. Thornberry N.A. Casciola-Rosen L.A. Rosen A. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 603-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar), suggesting that cleavage of golgin-160 may disrupt protein-protein interactions important for Golgi function.We have characterized the Golgi targeting of golgin-160 as a first step toward understanding its function. We report that Golgi targeting information resides in an 85-amino acid sequence present in the NH2-terminal head of golgin-160. Surprisingly, we also identified cryptic nuclear targeting information in the same region of the head domain. Our data suggest that specific caspase cleavage fragments of golgin-160 could be translocated from the Golgi complex to the nucleus.DISCUSSIONGolgins were originally identified as autoantigens in certain autoimmune diseases, but the definition of the golgin family has been extended to include any Golgi-localized membrane protein that contains an extensive coiled-coil domain. Although some golgins have been implicated in vesicle tethering and/or cisternal stacking, it is likely that different functions for other members of this broadly defined family exist. We previously showed that the NH2-terminal head domain of golgin-160 is cleaved by caspases during programmed cell death (25Mancini M. Machamer C.E. Roy S. Nicholson D.W. Thornberry N.A. Casciola-Rosen L.A. Rosen A. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 603-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). Cleavage of golgin-160 during apoptosis may disrupt protein-protein interactions that are critical for Golgi structure and function, contributing to the apoptotic disassembly of the Golgi.We have studied the targeting of golgin-160 as a first step toward addressing the contribution of this protein to Golgi structure and function. Our golgin-160 cDNA clone encodes a protein of 1498 amino acids, which differs from the previously reported GCP170 sequence because of a frameshift resulting in a novel COOH terminus (Fig.1 A). Based on the new sequence, golgin-160 is predicted to have a non-coiled-coil NH2-terminal head domain followed by an extensive COOH-terminal coiled-coil tail (Fig. 1 B). A number of expressed sequence tags present in the data base suggest that the protein represented by our golgin-160 cDNA is widely expressed. Anti-peptide antisera raised against the COOH terminus of our predicted golgin-160 protein confirmed that it is indeed endogenously expressed in HeLa cells (Fig. 1 C). It is likely that golgin-160 exists as a dimer that is mediated by its the coiled-coil domain (Figs. 1 D and 4 B).Several golgins are present in a detergent-resistant Golgi matrix, and redistribute to distinct cytoplasmic puncta when cells are treated with BFA (7Nakamura N. Rabouille C. Watson R. Nilsson T. Hui N. Slusarewicz P. Kreis T.E. Warren G. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 1715-1726Crossref PubMed Scopus (666) Google Scholar, 33Seemann J. Jokitalo E. Pypaert M. Warren G. Nature. 2000; 407: 1022-1026Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). Golgin-160 does not appear to be a component of the Golgi matrix, because it was not redistributed to GM130-containing puncta in BFA-treated cells (Fig. 2).Several golgins, including GM130, giantin, golgin-97, and golgin-84, contain Golgi targeting signals in their COOH- terminal regions (16Bascom R.A. Srinivasan S. Nussbaum R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2953-2962Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar,34Kjer-Nielsen L. Teasdale R.D. van Vliet C. Gleeson P.A. Curr.

Biol. 1999; 9: 381-384Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Here, we report multiple distinct targeting signals in the NH2-terminal domain of golgin-160 (Fig.8). We identified an 85-amino acid stretch in the NH2-terminal domain of golgin-160 capable of targeting GFP to the Golgi complex (Fig. 6). This 85-amino acid sequence contains several predicted motifs, such as a “helix-loop-helix” dimerization pattern (amino acids 199–214) that could mediate protein-protein interactions, but no significant homology to other proteins. The efficiency of Golgi localization was increased by the presence of an additional flanking sequence, suggesting that the conformation of the 85-residue domain may be critical for correct targeting. Together, these results indicate that Golgi localization of golgin-160 reflects an intrinsic property of the NH2-terminal head domain in the context of the full-length protein. A further understanding of the Golgi targeting signal will require determining the proteins with which the signal interacts.Interestingly, some truncations of the golgin-160 head domain showed prominent nuclear localization, suggesting the presence of cryptic nuclear targeting information (Fig. 5 C). A putative NLS was identified between residues 232 and 239. When this sequence was mutated, steady state nuclear localization was reduced but not eliminated (−NLS, Fig. 5 C). Analysis at early times post-transfection demonstrated that the NLS accelerated the rate of nuclear accumulation of GFP/g160-(140–257) (Fig. 6). The nuclear accumulation of truncation proteins lacking the NLS may be because of passive diffusion into the nucleus and interaction with a nuclear component, resulting in nuclear retention. However, it is important to note that full-length golgin-160 (endogenous or exogenously expressed) was never observed in the nucleus. Thus, the nuclear localization information present in the NH2-terminal head domain does not appear to function in the context of full-length golgin-160. There are a number NLS examples that are masked in the cytoplasm by protein-protein interactions, phosphorylation, or other post-translational modifications. We speculate that the NLS in the golgin-160 head is masked in a regulated manner.We have previously shown that the NH2-terminal domain of golgin-160 is cleaved by caspases during apoptosis (25Mancini M. Machamer C.E. Roy S. Nicholson D.W. Thornberry N.A. Casciola-Rosen L.A. Rosen A. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 603-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). To determine whether caspase cleavage fragments could be targeted to the nucleus, Myc-tagged constructs corresponding to all possible cleavage fragments were generated and localized by indirect immunofluorescence microscopy (Fig. 7 B). Three of the six possible cleavage fragments showed specific nuclear localization. Although all six of the fragments are small enough to diffuse into the nucleus, only those containing the region between residues 140 and 311 accumulated there. The three fragments containing residues 172–257 localized predominantly to the nucleus, even though they contain the Golgi targeting region described above. It is possible that the NLS and/or nuclear retention domain is completely unmasked in these fragments, which mimic the proteolytic fragments that would be generated in vivo. Thus, if these caspase-derived fragments are released from Golgi membranes during programmed cell death, they are likely to be translocated to the nucleus. It is tempting to speculate that apoptotic fragments of golgin-160 have a specific function in the nucleus. Studies to address this issue are presently underway. The Golgi complex of higher eukaryotic cells is composed of stacks of cisternal membranes that function in processing and sorting of lipids and proteins en route from the endoplasmic reticulum to the plasma membrane and other destinations (1Farquhar M.G.

Cell. 1997; 89: 445-455Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar, 21Moyer B.D. Allan B.B. Balch W.E. Traffic. 2001; 2: 268-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). In addition, giantin binds p115 suggesting the presence of a complex that tethers Golgi cisternae containing GM130 to giantin on vesicles via p115 (22Linstedt A.D. Jesch S.A. Mehta A. Lee T.H. Garcia-Mata R. Nelson D.S. Sztul E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10196-10201Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Disruption of GM130-giantin tethering complexes inhibits transport through the Golgi, and causes the accumulation of transport vesicles (23Seemann J. Jokitalo E.J. Warren G. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 635-645Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 24Alvarez C. Garcia-Mata R. Hauri H.P. Sztul E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2693-2700Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Taken together, these observations suggest that golgins couple Golgi structure to Golgi function. Recently, golgin-160 was shown to be a caspase substrate during programmed cell death (25Mancini M. Machamer C.E. Roy S. Nicholson D.W. Thornberry N.A. Casciola-Rosen L.A. Rosen A. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 603-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). Golgin-160 is predicted to form a characteristic coiled-coil structure in the COOH-terminal two-thirds of the protein, with an NH2-terminal non-coiled-coil (head) domain. Although the normal function of golgin-160 is unknown, the cleavage of the head domain during apoptosis is required for efficient apoptotic disassembly of the Golgi (25Mancini M. Machamer C.E. Roy S. Nicholson D.W. Thornberry N.A. Casciola-Rosen L.A. Rosen A. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 603-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar), suggesting that cleavage of golgin-160 may disrupt protein-protein interactions important for Golgi function. We have characterized the Golgi targeting of golgin-160 as a first step toward understanding its function. We report that Golgi targeting information resides in an 85-amino acid sequence present in the NH2-terminal head of golgin-160. Surprisingly, we also identified cryptic nuclear targeting information in the same region of the head domain. Our data suggest that specific caspase cleavage fragments of golgin-160 could be translocated from the Golgi complex to the nucleus. DISCUSSIONGolgins were originally identified as autoantigens in certain autoimmune diseases, but the definition of the golgin family has been extended to include any Golgi-localized membrane protein that contains an extensive coiled-coil domain. Although some golgins have been implicated in vesicle tethering and/or cisternal stacking, it is likely that different functions for other members of this broadly defined family exist. We previously showed that the NH2-terminal head domain of golgin-160 is cleaved by caspases during programmed cell death (25Mancini M. Machamer C.E. Roy S. Nicholson D.W. Thornberry N.A. Casciola-Rosen L.A. Rosen A. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 603-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). Cleavage of golgin-160 during apoptosis may disrupt protein-protein interactions that are critical for Golgi structure and function, contributing to the apoptotic disassembly of the Golgi.We have studied the targeting of golgin-160 as a first step toward addressing the contribution of this protein to Golgi structure and function. Our golgin-160 cDNA clone encodes a protein of 1498 amino acids, which differs from the previously reported GCP170 sequence because of a frameshift resulting in a novel COOH terminus (Fig.1 A). Based on the new sequence, golgin-160 is predicted to have a non-coiled-coil NH2-terminal head domain followed by an extensive COOH-terminal coiled-coil tail (Fig. 1 B). A number of expressed sequence tags present in the data base suggest that the protein represented by our golgin-160 cDNA is widely expressed. Anti-peptide antisera raised against the COOH terminus of our predicted golgin-160 protein confirmed that it is indeed endogenously expressed in HeLa cells (Fig. 1 C). It is likely that golgin-160 exists as a dimer that is mediated by its the coiled-coil domain (Figs. 1 D and 4 B).Several golgins are present in a detergent-resistant Golgi matrix, and redistribute to distinct cytoplasmic puncta when cells are treated with BFA (7Nakamura N. Rabouille C. Watson R. Nilsson T. Hui N. Slusarewicz P. Kreis T.E. Warren G. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 1715-1726Crossref PubMed Scopus (666) Google Scholar, 33Seemann J. Jokitalo E. Pypaert M. Warren G. Nature. 2000; 407: 1022-1026Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). Golgin-160 does not appear to be a component of the Golgi matrix, because it was not redistributed to GM130-containing puncta in BFA-treated cells (Fig. 2).Several golgins, including GM130, giantin, golgin-97, and golgin-84, contain Golgi targeting signals in their COOH- terminal regions (16Bascom R.A. Srinivasan S. Nussbaum R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2953-2962Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar,34Kjer-Nielsen L. Teasdale R.D. van Vliet C. Gleeson P.A. Curr.

Biol. 1999; 9: 381-384Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Here, we report multiple distinct targeting signals in the NH2-terminal domain of golgin-160 (Fig.8). We identified an 85-amino acid stretch in the NH2-terminal domain of golgin-160 capable of targeting GFP to the Golgi complex (Fig. 6). This 85-amino acid sequence contains several predicted motifs, such as a “helix-loop-helix” dimerization pattern (amino acids 199–214) that could mediate protein-protein interactions, but no significant homology to other proteins. The efficiency of Golgi localization was increased by the presence of an additional flanking sequence, suggesting that the conformation of the 85-residue domain may be critical for correct targeting. Together, these results indicate that Golgi localization of golgin-160 reflects an intrinsic property of the NH2-terminal head domain in the context of the full-length protein. A further understanding of the Golgi targeting signal will require determining the proteins with which the signal interacts.Interestingly, some truncations of the golgin-160 head domain showed prominent nuclear localization, suggesting the presence of cryptic nuclear targeting information (Fig. 5 C). A putative NLS was identified between residues 232 and 239. When this sequence was mutated, steady state nuclear localization was reduced but not eliminated (−NLS, Fig. 5 C). Analysis at early times post-transfection demonstrated that the NLS accelerated the rate of nuclear accumulation of GFP/g160-(140–257) (Fig. 6). The nuclear accumulation of truncation proteins lacking the NLS may be because of passive diffusion into the nucleus and interaction with a nuclear component, resulting in nuclear retention. However, it is important to note that full-length golgin-160 (endogenous or exogenously expressed) was never observed in the nucleus. Thus, the nuclear localization information present in the NH2-terminal head domain does not appear to function in the context of full-length golgin-160. There are a number NLS examples that are masked in the cytoplasm by protein-protein interactions, phosphorylation, or other post-translational modifications. We speculate that the NLS in the golgin-160 head is masked in a regulated manner.We have previously shown that the NH2-terminal domain of golgin-160 is cleaved by caspases during apoptosis (25Mancini M. Machamer C.E. Roy S. Nicholson D.W. Thornberry N.A. Casciola-Rosen L.A. Rosen A. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 603-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). To determine whether caspase cleavage fragments could be targeted to the nucleus, Myc-tagged constructs corresponding to all possible cleavage fragments were generated and localized by indirect immunofluorescence microscopy (Fig. 7 B). Three of the six possible cleavage fragments showed specific nuclear localization. Although all six of the fragments are small enough to diffuse into the nucleus, only those containing the region between residues 140 and 311 accumulated there. The three fragments containing residues 172–257 localized predominantly to the nucleus, even though they contain the Golgi targeting region described above. It is possible that the NLS and/or nuclear retention domain is completely unmasked in these fragments, which mimic the proteolytic fragments that would be generated in vivo. Thus, if these caspase-derived fragments are released from Golgi membranes during programmed cell death, they are likely to be translocated to the nucleus. It is tempting to speculate that apoptotic fragments of golgin-160 have a specific function in the nucleus. Studies to address this issue are presently underway. Golgins were originally identified as autoantigens in certain autoimmune diseases, but the definition of the golgin family has been extended to include any Golgi-localized membrane protein that contains an extensive coiled-coil domain.

Pore proteins mediate the diffusion of hydrophilic nutrients across this membrane. Electron microscopy revealed that the outer membrane of Mycobacterium smegmatis contained about 1000 protein pores per μm2, which are about 50-fold fewer pores per μm2 than in Gram-negative bacteria. The projection structure of the major porin MspA of M. smegmatis was determined at 17 Å resolution. MspA forms a cone-like tetrameric complex of 10 nm in length with a single central pore. Thus, MspA is drastically different from the trimeric porins of Gram-negative bacteria and represents a new class of channel proteins. The formation of MspA micelles indicated that the ends of MspA have different hydrophobicities. Oriented insertion of MspA into membranes was demonstrated in lipid bilayer experiments, which revealed a strongly asymmetrical voltage gating of MspA channels at –30 mV. The length of MspA is sufficient to span the outer membrane and contributes in combination with the tapering end of the pore and the low number of pores to the low permeability of the cell wall of M. smegmatis for hydrophilic compounds.

Scheele S. Dolin P. Pathania V. Raviglione M.C. JAMA (J. AM. MED. ASSOC.). 1999; 282: 677-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (2723) Google Scholar). Treatment of TB caused by non-resistant strains ofMycobacterium tuberculosis is effective but is based on a regimen of up to four drugs over a period of six months (2Espinal M.A. Kim S.J. Suarez P.G. Kam K.M. Khomenko A.G. Migliori G.B. Baez J. Kochi A. Dye C. Raviglione M.C. JAMA (J. AM. MED. ASSOC.). 2000; 283: 2537-2545Crossref PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar). The major problem in TB therapy is the slow uptake of drugs across the mycobacterial cell wall, which mounts a formidable permeability barrier toward diffusion of hydrophobic and hydrophilic compounds (3Brennan P.J. Nikaido H. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 29-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (1563) Google Scholar). The diffusion of hydrophilic compounds across the mycobacterial cell wall is mediated by water-filled channel proteins (4Trias J. Jarlier V. Benz R. Science. 1992; 258: 1479-1481Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). The transport function of these channel proteins is similar to that of the porins of Gram-negative bacteria, but the porin pathway of mycobacteria is at least 1000-fold less efficient than that of Escherichia coli(5Jarlier V. Nikaido H. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 1418-1423Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar, 6Stahl C. Kubetzko S. Kaps I. Seeber S. Engelhardt H. Niederweis M. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 40: 451-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). It is assumed that the combination of low cell wall permeability with the action of detoxifying proteins such as degrading enzymes or efflux pumps is responsible for the intrinsic resistance of mycobacteria to many antibiotics such as penicillins, cephalosporins, and tetracyclines (7Nikaido H. Semin. Cell. Dev. Biol. 2001; 12: 215-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). However, it is not known why the porin pathway in mycobacteria is so inefficient. Two integral proteins with transport properties have been identified in mycobacterial cell walls: OmpATb from M. tuberculosis, which has channel activity in vitro but unexplored physiological functions (8Senaratne R.H. Mobasheri H. Papavinasasundaram K.G. Jenner P. Lea E.J. Draper P. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 3541-3547Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and MspA, which was first discovered in chloroform-methanol extracts from Mycobacterium smegmatis as an oligomeric channel protein composed of 20 kDa subunits (9Niederweis M. Ehrt S. Heinz C. Klöcker U. Karosi S. Swiderek K.M. Riley L.W. Benz R. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 33: 933-945Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays and immunogold labeling experiments demonstrated that MspA is localized in the cell wall (6Stahl C. Kubetzko S. Kaps I. Seeber S. Engelhardt H. Niederweis M. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 40: 451-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Uptake of glucose by an mspA deletion mutant was 4-fold slower compared with the wild type indicating that MspA is the major porin ofM. smegmatis (6Stahl C. Kubetzko S. Kaps I. Seeber S. Engelhardt H. Niederweis M. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 40: 451-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). MspA is the prototype of a family of four very similar porins of M. smegmatis, which did not show any homology to any other known protein (6Stahl C. Kubetzko S. Kaps I. Seeber S. Engelhardt H. Niederweis M. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 40: 451-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Up to now, MspA is the only mycobacterial porin, which can be purified in milligram quantities (10Heinz C. Niederweis M. Anal. Biochem. 2000; 285: 113-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) and is, therefore, amenable to structural investigations. The structure of mycobacterial porins would be of paramount importance both for understanding the nutrient transport across the mycobacterial cell wall and for treatment of TB with hydrophilic drugs but is also likely to be of fundamental scientific interest because porins reside in an asymmetric outer membrane with unique properties. (i) The membrane has a very low fluidity and does not melt up to 70 °C in contrast to cytoplasmic membranes of other mesophilic organisms, which begin to melt at 20 °C (11Liu J. Barry III, C.E. Besra G.S. Nikaido H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29545-29551Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar), (ii) it is about 10 nm thick, exceeding the thickness of all other known membranes by about 2.5-fold (3Brennan P.J. Nikaido H. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 29-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (1563) Google Scholar), (iii) it provides a very hydrophobic cell surface, which causes the bacteria to clump in an hydrophilic environment, and (iv) its fluidity decreases toward the periplasmatic side of the membrane (12Liu J. Rosenberg E.Y. Nikaido H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 11254-11258Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar) in contrast to that of the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria. Here, we present the first structural analysis of a mycobacterial porin. The MspA complex is composed of four subunits and forms a single pore of extraordinary length. A hydrophobicity gradient along the surface of the MspA pore leads to an oriented membrane insertion in planar lipid bilayers. The structural properties of MspA and the low number of porins contribute to the low permeability of the cell wall ofM. smegmatis compared with E. coli. MspA was purified from M. smegmatis by selective extraction at 100 °C using 0.5%n-octyl-polyoxyethylene (octyl-POE) as a detergent and a two-step chromatographic purification procedure as described (10Heinz C. Niederweis M. Anal. Biochem. 2000; 285: 113-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). MspA eluted from the anion exchange column at 0.57 m NaCl and was separated from another porin in the extracts, MspC, which eluted at 1.3 m NaCl as described (13Heinz C. Roth E. Niederweis M. Selinsky B.S. Membrane Protein Protocols: Expression, Purification and Crystallization. Humana Press Inc., Totowa, NJ2003Google Scholar). Purified MspA was stored in a 25-mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.5) containing 0.5% octyl-POE (NaP-POE buffer). Subpicogram amounts of purified MspA showed a high channel-forming activity in planar lipid bilayer experiments, which were done as described (10Heinz C. Niederweis M. Anal. Biochem. 2000; 285: 113-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Glutardialdehyde, the most commonly used cross-linking reagent, could not be used because MspA contains only a single lysine residue. Therefore, water-soluble carbodiimides were employed to cross-link carboxyl groups of MspA (14Lin C.M. Mihal K.A. Krueger R.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1038: 382-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). To obtain a maximal yield of cross-linked protein the molar ratio of 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide (EDAC) and cystamine to MspA was optimized. In the final reaction, 1 μg of MspA in 100 μl (0.13 μm) was incubated with 76 mm EDAC and 0.95 m cystamine for 90 min at room temperature. The reaction was buffered with 25 mm sodium phosphate at pH 7.0. The sample was dialyzed for 12 h against 400 ml of 25 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.0). Four-fifths of the sample containing 800 ng of MspA was denatured by heating in 80% dimethyl sulfoxide to 100 °C for 30 min and precipitated with acetone (9Niederweis M. Ehrt S. Heinz C. Klöcker U. Karosi S. Swiderek K.M. Riley L.W. Benz R. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 33: 933-945Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar) before gel electrophoresis, whereas one-fifth of the sample containing 200 ng of MspA was directly loaded on the gel. Gel electrophoresis and staining with silver was done as described (10Heinz C. Niederweis M. Anal. Biochem. 2000; 285: 113-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The molecular mass of MspA was determined by analytical gel filtration. A silica-based (G3000SWXL, Tosoh Biosep) and dextran-based material (Superdex 200, Pharmacia) were used for gel filtration to detect errors resulting from unspecific interactions with MspA. Chymotrypsinogen A (25 kDa), ovalbumin (43 kDa), albumin (67 kDa), phosphorylase b (97.4 kDa), and aldolase (158 kDa) were taken for calibration. Isolated and solubilized MspA was either dialyzed to remove the detergent or reconstituted into lipid vesicles prior to inspection in the electron microscope. MspA was dialyzed against water for at least 24 h, diluted to a protein concentration of ∼0.1 mg/ml and applied to carbon-coated copper grids made hydrophilic by glow discharge. MspA samples and cell wall fragments were negatively stained with a solution of 0.2% unbuffered uranyl acetate for about 20 s and inspected in a Philips EM420 or CM12 transmission electron microscope at a primary magnification of 35,000-fold. For documentation electron micrographs were taken and scanned using the CCD Scanner Flextight (Imacon, Kopenhagen Denmark). Reconstitution of solubilized MspA in lipid membranes was performed by dialysis as described (15Paul A. Engelhardt H. Jakubowski U. Baumeister W. Biophys. J. 1992; 61: 172-188Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) using dimyristoyl phosphatidylcholine (DMPC) as a lipid and 25 mm HEPES (pH 7.5) plus 3 mm NaN3 as a buffer. The molar lipid to protein ratio was 10:1, and the dialysis temperature was 35 °C. For single-particle analysis, electron micrographs were digitized applying a pixel size of 0.45 nm at the specimen level. Correlation averaging and unbending were performed with the SEMPER image processing system (16Saxton W.O. Pitt T.J. Horner M. Ultramicroscopy. 1979; 4: 343-354Crossref Scopus (330) Google Scholar) and principal component analysis with the EM system (17Hegerl R. J. Struct. Biol. 1996; 116: 30-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Images of individual protein channels were centered,i.e. laterally aligned, by correlation. Rotational correction was performed after principal component analysis using two related eigenvectors representing the rotational misalignment of the centered images according to the procedure described elsewhere (18Dube P. Tavares P. Lurz R. van Heel M. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 1303-1309Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). These data consisting of 1757 images were again applied to principle component analysis and classified. Images contributing to ill defined classes were omitted. Finally, a set of 1067 images separated in three classes was used to calculated the individual class averages. This method is a bias-free approach because it does not rely on reference structures for alignment. The channel activity of selected samples was measured in lipid bilayer experiments as described (10Heinz C. Niederweis M. Anal. Biochem. 2000; 285: 113-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). In all lipid bilayer experiments, the aqueous phase contained 1m KCl and 10 mm2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulphonic acid (MES, pH 6.0). The temperature was kept at 20 °C using a thermostat. The single channel conductances of at least 100 pores reconstituted from a freshly diluted solution of purified MspA were checked with several diphytanoyl phosphatidylcholine membranes before multi-channel experiments such as the analysis of the voltage gating of MspA were done. A lipid film was painted across the hole of a new Teflon cell. After formation of the lipid bilayer purified MspA was added at a final concentration of 26 pg/ml to the cis-side, which was connected to ground. The number of reconstituted channels was determined from the overall conductance increase of the membrane. When ∼100 channels were reconstituted into the membrane, increasing positive and negative voltages were applied to the membrane and the membrane current was recorded. The mspA gene encodes a 20-kDa protein, but the isolated MspA oligomer had an apparent molecular mass of about 100 kDa in denaturing polyacrylamide gels. Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization mass spectrometry confirmed that the purified MspA protein was composed of identical 20 kDa monomers, but the number of subunits or the molecular mass of the oligomer remained to be elucidated (9Niederweis M. Ehrt S. Heinz C. Klöcker U. Karosi S. Swiderek K.M. Riley L.W. Benz R. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 33: 933-945Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). To determine the stoichiometric composition of the functional MspA oligomer, we varied the purification procedure by using different detergents and organic solvents and applied mass spectroscopy using both matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization and electrospray ionization, but no signals with a mass-to-charge ratio larger than that of the MspA monomer were detected. In another approach, MspA was cross-linked via its accessible carboxyl groups using a water-soluble carbodiimide. MspA was significantly modified by the cross-linker as evidenced by the reduction of the electrophoretic mobility of MspA oligomers (Fig. 1, lane 4). This might be explained by the loss of negative surface charges because cross-linking between MspA oligomers is unlikely at a protein concentration of 130 nm (2.6 μg/ml), which is 20- to 1500-fold lower compared with other protocols used to obtain intermolecular cross-links (19Mauk M.R. Mauk A.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 186: 473-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Denaturation of cross-linked MspA released four protein species (Fig. 1, lane 5) with apparent molecular masses of 21, 42, 64, and 83 kDa, i.e. multiples of the MspA monomer (20 kDa). Protein bands exceeding the apparent molecular mass of the native protein of 90 kDa were not observed neither in silver-stained gels nor by immunodetection of identical samples using an MspA antiserum (not shown). Molecular masses of 76 and 93 kDa were determined for oligomeric MspA by analytical gel filtration using both silica- and dextran-based column materials, respectively (not shown). The results of all these experiments were consistent with an MspA tetramer. The structure of theM. smegmatis porins was investigated in their native environment, i.e. in isolated cell walls, by electron microscopy. In negatively stained preparations uranyl acetate-filled pores were clearly visible (Fig.2 A). The pore structures appeared randomly distributed at a density of 1010 ± 310 pores per μm2 (determined from eight cell wall fragments containing 484 pores). Thus, the density of porins is about 15-fold less than that in the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria, in which more than 15,000 porin trimers per μm2 in a two-dimensionally crystalline arrangement were observed (20Kessel M. Brennan M.J. Trus B.L. Bisher M.E. Steven A.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 203: 275-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The cell wall of an mspA mutant contained 3-fold fewer pores than the wild type indicating that most of the pores were MspA channels (not shown). This is in agreement with MspA being the major porin ofM. smegmatis as evidenced by the permeability deficiency of an ΔmspA mutant toward hydrophilic compounds and the reduced channel activity of detergent cell extracts of the mutant in lipid bilayer experiments (6Stahl C. Kubetzko S. Kaps I. Seeber S. Engelhardt H. Niederweis M. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 40: 451-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Because the other porins of M. smegmatis differ from MspA only by a few amino acids (6Stahl C. Kubetzko S. Kaps I. Seeber S. Engelhardt H. Niederweis M. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 40: 451-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar), these channels are most likely structurally indistinguishable in electron micrographs at the given resolution of 1.7 nm. It is obvious that the porins ofM. smegmatis, and here MspA in particular, are radically different from trimeric porins of Gram-negative bacteria: MspA possesses only one channel per molecular complex (Fig. 2). Principal component analysis of 1757 individual pore images extracted from several micrographs of cell wall fragments revealed a 4-fold symmetric particle (Fig. 2, B and C) that forms a central channel. Rotational alignment of the projections was performed with a bias-free approach using two related eigenvectors for orientational correction (18Dube P. Tavares P. Lurz R. van Heel M. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 1303-1309Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). The result is in perfect agreement with the tetrameric stoichiometry as deduced from the cross-linking and gel filtration experiments, and it excludes other compositions such as trimers or pentamers. Classification yielded three sets of molecular images: particles with a pronounced 4-fold symmetric projection structure (Fig. 2, Band C) and one class with poorly defined symmetry (Fig.2 D). The projections are consistent with a cylindrical molecule being partially embedded in stain and, by this way, enhancing the structure on one end or the other of the complex. The inner and outer diameter of class I molecules are 2.5 and 10 nm, respectively, and decreased to about 2.2 and 8 nm for class III molecules. To obtain further structural information MspA was purified, reconstituted in the presence of DMPC (15Paul A. Engelhardt H. Jakubowski U. Baumeister W. Biophys. J. 1992; 61: 172-188Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), and analyzed by electron microscopy. Depending on the lipid-to-protein ratio a great variety of MspA supramolecular structures were observed: planar lipid membranes and lipid vesicles with randomly inserted MspA complexes, densely packed protein sheets, and spherical and, as depicted in Fig.3 A, linear MspA aggregates. Linear aggregates were obtained in top view and in side view projections (Fig. 3 A). The latter show that the MspA pore complexes were arranged in two rows, intercalating like the teeth of a zipper. For image analysis, 20 individual MspA zippers were unbent in the computer, aligned by correlation methods, and averaged (Fig.3, B and C). The side views confirmed the cone-like structure of MspA as deduced from the top view averages and matched their dimensions, with an outer diameter of about 10 nm, one central open hole of 2.5 nm at one end converging to about 2.2 nm toward the other end (Fig. 4). The channel protein is ∼10 nm long. About 5.5 nm of the molecule were exposed to the polar environment and is well embedded in stain, thus, representing the more hydrophilic part of MspA. The remaining very hydrophobic portion of MspA is responsible for the assembly of the zipper-like structures.Figure 4Structure of the MspA pore complex. Compilation of the averages of the side viewand top view (class I) projection of the channel protein and comparison of the molecular dimensions. Note that the pore is apparently unstained in the contact region of neighboring molecules indicating that the channel is rather narrow or excludes stain for other reasons.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To examine whether the apparent asymmetric surface hydrophobicity of the MspA complex is reflected in detergent-depleted solutions and in the lipid environment, octyl-POE was either removed or exchanged for DMPC by dialysis (15Paul A. Engelhardt H. Jakubowski U. Baumeister W. Biophys. J. 1992; 61: 172-188Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Samples of purified and detergent-solubilized MspA that were extensively dialyzed against buffer or pure water did not yield insoluble precipitates. Instead they showed “protein micelles” in the electron microscope with a diameter of about 35 nm (Fig.5 A). Obviously, the hydrophobic portions of MspA molecules were hidden in the center of the micelle while the apparently more voluminous hydrophilic regions were exposed to the polar environment. The formation of micelles indicated an oriented interaction between individual MspA complexes. The thickness of the “micelle wall” is about 10 nm and agrees with the length of the MspA oligomer (Fig. 4). Reconstitution of MspA oligomers together with DMPC resulted in membranes and lipid vesicles showing the typical stain-filled pores in electron micrographs (Fig. 5 B). Images of flattened vesicles revealed side-on views of the MspA complexes at the vesicle edge and illustrate their apparently unidirectional insertion into the membrane. About 4–5 nm of MspA protruded from the membrane surface and might represent the hydrophilic portion of the protein in agreement with the arrangement of the complexes in the zipper-like aggregates (Fig.4). The apparently unidirectional insertion of MspA complexes in lipid vesicles (Fig. 5 B) should be reflected in functional measurements. This was analyzed in lipid bilayer experiments in which MspA was added only to the cis-side of the membrane. After reconstitution of about 100 MspA channels into a DiphPC membrane, the polarity of the membrane potential was reversed and the potential was increased stepwise. No channel closure was observed at membrane potentials of 10 and 20 mV, regardless of whether the potential was positive or negative (Fig.6). However, the membrane current decreased exponentially at a membrane potential of −30 mV, whereas no change of the current was detected up to a potential of +40 mV. At −30 mV about 60% of the reconstituted channels switched rapidly to a closed conformation. The ratio of closed channels increased to 80%, when the potential was risen to −50 mV (Fig. 6). Addition of the protein to both sides of the membrane resulted in a symmetric response to the applied voltage (data not shown). These results indicated an asymmetrical orientation of MspA in the membrane and confirmed the assumption that the presence of a particular hydrophobic end of MspA determines the insertion into and the interaction with the lipid membrane. The major porin of M. smegmatis MspA is composed of four monomers forming one central channel of 10 nm in length and ∼2.5 nm of inner diameter. These structural features are unique and clearly distinguish the MspA pore and related mycobacterial porins from all other known transmembrane channel proteins. Pore proteins located in the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria form a single channel defined by one β-barrel per monomer. They occur as monomers such as the porin OmpG of E. coli (21Fajardo D.A. Cheung J. Ito C. Sugawara E. Nikaido H. Misra R. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 4452-4459Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and theE. coli siderophore receptors FhuA (22Ferguson A.D. Hofmann E. Coulton J.W. Diederichs K. Welte W. Science. 1998; 282: 2215-2220Crossref PubMed Scopus (664) Google Scholar) and FepA (23Buchanan S.K. Smith B.S. Venkatramani L. Xia D. Esser L. Palnitkar M. Chakraborty R. van der Helm D. Deisenhofer J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 56-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar) or as trimers with three pores per molecule, e.g. OmpF of E. coli and related porins (24Cowan S.W. Schirmer T. Rummel G. Steiert M. Ghosh R. Pauptit R.A. Jansonius J.N. Rosenbusch J.P. Nature. 1992; 358: 727-733Crossref PubMed Scopus (1330) Google Scholar). Known tetrameric channel proteins belong to the α-type (25Saier Jr., M.H. J. Membr. Biol. 2000; 175: 165-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) and are located in the cytoplasmic membrane, e.g. the potassium channel (26Gouaux E. Structure. 1998; 6: 1221-1226Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). Another tetramer is formed by the black widow spider neurotoxin α-latrotoxin. However, this is a hydrophilic propeller-shaped 520-kDa channel, which only slowly inserts into lipid membranes in the absence of any receptor (27Orlova E.V. Rahman M.A. Gowen B. Volynski K.E. Ashton A.C. Manser C. van Heel M. Ushkaryov Y.A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 48-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Moreover, only a part of α-latrotoxin acquires amphilicity upon oligomerization and is able to insert into membranes. By contrast, MspA is likely to be embedded over a considerable portion of its length of 10 nm in the mycobacterial outer membrane if the latter has indeed a thickness of 10 nm as proposed earlier (3Brennan P.J. Nikaido H. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 29-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (1563) Google Scholar, 28Paul T.R. Beveridge T.J. Zentbl. Bakteriol. 1993; 279: 450-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). We found evidence for a strongly hydrophobic portion of about 5 nm in length and assume that at least the outermost domain of ∼2 nm thickness, which forms the 4-fold symmetry and is readily accessible to uranyl acetate, is exposed on the membrane surface in vivo. If the other part of MspA is lipid-embedded in vivo, MspA may possess a longer membrane-spanning domain than any other bacterial channel protein. Both the channel-tunnel TolC and the junctional pore complex of cyanobacteria are longer (14 and 32 nm, respectively), but their membrane-spanning domains do not exceed 4 nm (29Koronakis V. Sharff A. Koronakis E. Luisi B. Hughes C. Nature. 2000; 405: 914-919Crossref PubMed Scopus (864) Google Scholar, 30Hoiczyk E. Baumeister W. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 1161-1168Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). The formation of protein micelles and the MspA zippers illustrate the existence of a hydrophobicity gradient along the MspA pore with voluminous hydrophilic domains at one end and a strongly hydrophobic portion at the other. This appears to be another new characteristic of MspA because protein micelles have not yet been observed for other bacterial porins. The assumption that the hydrophobicity gradient of MspA would lead to an oriented interaction with hydrophobic surfaces was supported by the highly asymmetric insertion of MspA into planar lipid membranes. This property also explains the oriented adsorption of the MspA pore onto hydrophobic carbon surfaces (31Niederweis M. Heinz C. Janik K. Bossmann S.H. Nano Lett. 2001; 1: 169-174Crossref Scopus (11) Google Scholar). The mycolic acids in the mycobacterial cell wall form tight crystalline arrays (32Nikaido H. Kim S.H. Rosenberg E.Y. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 8: 1025-1030Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar), which exhibit a drastically decreasing fluidity toward its periplasmic end (12Liu J. Rosenberg E.Y. Nikaido H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 11254-11258Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). The asymmetrical surface hydrophobicity and membrane insertion might reflect the orientation of the MspA pore in the asymmetrical mycolic acid layer and might be important in vivo for gating. Porins of Mycobacterium chelonae and Mycobacterium phlei close asymmetrically at rather low negative voltages of −40 and −20 mV, respectively, in artificial membranes (33Trias J. Benz R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 6234-6240Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 34Riess F.G. Dorner U. Schiffler B. Benz R. J. Membr. Biol. 2001; 182: 147-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) indicating that voltage gating might be a general property of porins from fast-growing mycobacteria. Because the existence of a Donnan potential across the mycobacterial cell wall similar to that observed in E. coli (35Sen K. Hellman J. Nikaido H. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 1182-1187Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was not experimentally demonstrated yet, it is not clear whether voltage gating of MspA in lipid bilayer experiments has any significance in vivo. However, the critical voltage of MspA, above which channels close, is only one third of the 90 mV, which is required to close the porin OmpF of E. coli (36Brunen M. Engelhardt H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 212: 129-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Moreover, there is growing evidence that a number of factors such as a low pH value (37Todt J.C. Rocque W.J. McGroarty E.J. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 10471-10478Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) or the presence of polycations (38Dela Vega A.L. Delcour A.H. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 6058-6065Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) or saccharides (39Schindler H. Rosenbusch J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 2302-2306Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar) reduce the critical voltage of porins from Gram-negative bacteria. Taking into account that charged lipids are only present in the outer layer of the mycolic acid membrane (40Barry III, C.E. Lee R.E. Mdluli K. Sampson A.E. Schroeder B.G. Slayden R.A. Yuan Y. Prog. Lipid Res. 1998; 37: 143-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar) it is tempting to speculate that a Donnan potential exists in mycobacteria and voltage gating of porins is exploited by mycobacteria to protect themselves from noxious molecules. We have shown that the density of pore proteins in the cell wall of M. smegmatis is about 15-fold and that of single pores about 45-fold less compared with that of Gram-negative bacteria. However, this only partially accounts for the 50,000-fold lower permeability of the cell wall of M. smegmatis compared with E. coli for glucose (6Stahl C. Kubetzko S. Kaps I. Seeber S. Engelhardt H. Niederweis M. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 40: 451-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Molecular dynamics calculations of the diffusion of ions through the porin OmpF have shown that the diffusion constants are reduced to about 50% of their value in bulk solutions (41Im W. Roux B. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 319: 1177-1197Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). Furthermore, diffusion rates through pore proteins decrease with the size of the substrate (42Nikaido H. Rosenberg E.Y. J. Bacteriol. 1983; 153: 241-252Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Both effects are certainly more pronounced in the 2.5-fold longer MspA channel compared with theE. coli porins. Thus, the extraordinary length of the MspA pore hampers diffusion of hydrophilic compounds across the outer membrane of M. smegmatis further. A significant contribution might also originate from the putative periplasmatic end of the MspA channel, which was less filled with stain (Fig. 4) indicating either an extremely hydrophobic channel interior or a channel constriction. Both properties would exclude uranyl acetate from staining and would further reduce the pore permeability for polar molecules. In conclusion, the length, the cone-like structure of the MspA pore with its less permissive end and the low number of pores may explain why the outer membrane of M. smegmatis has such an extraordinary low permeability for hydrophilic compounds. Similar mechanisms likely restrict the porin pathway in M. tuberculosis because the thickness of the outer membrane determines the minimal length of the porins and appears to be similar for mycobacteria (28Paul T.R. Beveridge T.J. Zentbl. Bakteriol. 1993; 279: 450-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) and the number of porins appears to be low in M. tuberculosis (43Kartmann B. Stenger S. Niederweis M. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 6543-6546Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We thank Dr. Wolfgang Hillen for generous support and for comments on an early version of the manuscript."
https://openalex.org/W1966025880,"Aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases are well known for their remarkable precision in substrate selection during aminoacyl-tRNA formation. Some synthetases enhance the accuracy of this process by editing mechanisms that lead to hydrolysis of incorrectly activated and/or charged amino acids. Prolyl-tRNA synthetases (ProRSs) can be divided into two structurally divergent groups, archaeal-type and bacterial-type enzymes. A striking difference between these groups is the presence of an insertion domain (∼180 amino acids) in the bacterial-type ProRS. Because the archaeal-type ProRS enzymes have been shown to recognize cysteine, we tested selected ProRSs from all three domains of life to determine whether cysteine activation is a general property of ProRS. Here we show that cysteine is activated by recombinant ProRS enzymes from the archaea Methanocaldococcus jannaschii and Methanothermobacter thermautotrophicus, from the eukaryote Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and from the bacteria Aquifex aeolicus, Borrelia burgdorferi, Clostridium sticklandii, Cytophaga hutchinsonii, Deinococcus radiodurans, Escherichia coli, Magnetospirillum magnetotacticum, Novosphingobium aromaticivorans, Rhodopseudomonas palustris, and Thermus thermophilus.This non-cognate amino acid was efficiently acylated in vitro onto tRNAPro, and the misacylated Cys-tRNAPro was not edited by ProRS. Therefore, ProRS exhibits a natural level of mischarging that is to date unequalled among the aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases.

Therefore, ProRS exhibits a natural level of mischarging that is to date unequalled among the aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases. Aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (AARSs) 1The abbreviations used are: AARS, aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase; ProRS, prolyl-tRNA synthetase; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid; ATP-PPi, ATP-pyrophosphate. ensure accuracy in the translation of the genetic code by precisely selecting and attaching their cognate amino acids to the corresponding tRNA species (1Ibba M. Söll D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 617-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (1115) Google Scholar). This is accomplished in a two-step process of amino acid activation and aminoacyl-tRNA formation. First, the enzyme-bound aminoacyl-adenylate is formed in the presence of ATP. The activated amino acid is subsequently transferred to the 3′ terminus of the cognate tRNA (1Ibba M. Söll D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 617-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (1115) Google Scholar). Although accurate amino acid recognition by AARSs is an efficient process, some misactivation or mischarging of non-cognate amino acids has been observed. The incorrect products are usually hydrolyzed during pre-transfer and/or post-transfer editing activities (2Jakubowski H. Goldman E. Microbiol. Rev. 1992; 56: 412-429Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A well described editing model is the “double-sieve” mechanism (3Fersht A.R. Dingwall C. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 2627-2631Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 4Fersht A.R. Science. 1998; 280: 541Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). It suggests that some aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases choose their cognate amino acids primarily by size and then by specific chemical features. The active site for aminoacylation acts as the “coarse” sieve, activating at a significant rate only those amino acids that are the same size as or smaller than the desired one. The second sieve, the “fine sieve,” is the editing site where the products of those amino acids that are smaller than the correct one are hydrolyzed. Editing activities have been demonstrated for many synthetases (5Jakubowski H. Fersht A.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1981; 9: 3105-3117Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 6Nureki O. Vassylyev D.G.

Progress in genome analysis has made available a large number of ProRS sequences. Their alignments and phylogenetic examination revealed the existence of two quite diverged groups (Fig. 1), archaeal-type and bacterial-type ProRS enzymes (9Woese C.R. Olsen G. Ibba M. Söll D.

Bacterial-type ProRS, found in bacteria and mitochondria, is usually larger than the archaeal-type enzyme because of an insertion domain of ∼180 amino acids (Table I). However, ProRSs from Rhodopseudomonas palustris,Caulobacter crescentus, Rickettsia prowazekii, and a few other representatives of α-proteobacteria lack this insertion domain, yet they are bacterial-type enzymes based on phylogenetic analyses. In contrast, the archaeal-type ProRS lacks the insertion sequence but contains a conserved C-terminal extension of ∼100 amino acids including a totally conserved terminal tyrosine (Fig. 1). In addition to its occurrence in archaea and eukarya, the archaeal-type ProRS is also found in the bacterial domain in theThermus-Deinococcus group, theCytophaga-Flexibacter-Bacteroides group,Borrelia, some Clostridium species, and some α-proteobacteria.Table IProperties and kinetic parameters for proline and cysteine activation of various ProRS enzymesaCysteine activation was measured in the presence of 1 mg/ml of the appropriate unfractionated tRNA (see “Experimental Procedures”).

Open table in a new tab Although the ProRS enzymes from Escherichia coli andThermus aquaticus have been purified and partially characterized many years ago, all 20 canonical amino acids had not been tested for their ability to be substrates (13Lee M.L.

To provide an answer, we examined ProRS enzymes from a number of representative organisms for amino acid activation and tRNA charging with cysteine. Proline and cysteine were purchased from Sigma and were analyzed for purity by the Keck Foundation Research Biotechnology Resource Laboratory at Yale University. [35S]Cysteine (1075 Ci/mmol) and [32P]pyrophosphate (PPi) (15 Ci/mmol) were from PerkinElmer Life Sciences, and [3H]proline (104 Ci/mmol), [14C]proline (248 mCi/mmol), and [3H]alanine (52 Ci/mmol) were fromAmersham Biosciences. Nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid matrix was from Qiagen. GF/C glass microfiber filters were from Whatman. Nitrocellulose filters (0.45 μm) were from Schleicher & Schuell. Inorganic pyrophosphatase (0.2 units/μl) was from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. The TOPO-TA cloning kit was from Invitrogen. Epicurian coli© BL21-CodonPlusTM competent cells were purchased from Stratagene. Bulk mature E. coli tRNA was purchased from Sigma, and bulk mature yeast tRNA was from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. Unfractionated mature tRNA fromM. jannaschii was prepared as described previously (24Curnow A.W. Tumbula D.L. Pelaschier J.T. Min B. Söll D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 12838-12843Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). EF1A-purified E. coli tRNACysand T. thermophilus tRNACys were prepared as described (see Ref. 45Ambrogelly A. Ahel I.

Partial separation of E. coli tRNAs was performed at 4 °C by chromatography on benzoylated DEAE-cellulose at pH 7.0 in the presence of Mg2+ as described previously (25Gillam I. Millward D.B. von Tigerstrom M. Wimmer E. Tener G.M. Biochemistry. 1967; 6: 3043-3056Crossref PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar). tRNA (40 mg) was adsorbed to a benzoylated DEAE-cellulose column (2.5 × 8 cm) in 50 mm MOPS-HCl, pH 7.0, containing 10 mm MgCl2. Elution was performed with a linear gradient of NaCl (0–1.0 m, 400 ml of total volume) at a flow rate of 1 ml/min maintained with 5-ml fractions collected. The fractions were assayed for presence of tRNAPro and tRNACys by charging with E. coli ProRS and cysteinyl-tRNA synthetase. A fraction enriched in tRNAPro(∼150 pmol of proline/A 260) and devoid of tRNACys was used in this study. E. coli (CGG) and M. jannaschii (UGG) tRNAPro genes were synthesized as described previously (15Stathopoulos C., Li, T. Longman R. Vothknecht U.C. Becker H.D. Ibba M. Söll D.

Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 46-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) and then transcribed from NsiI orBstNI-linearized plasmids using T7 polymerase. E. coli transcript was prepared as a ribozyme construct, because the first base is cytosine, which is highly unfavorable for T7 polymerase (26Fechter P. Rudinger J. Giegé R. Théobald-Dietrich A. FEBS Lett. 1998; 436: 99-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Digested template DNA was extracted with phenol and chloroform and precipitated with ethanol. The transcription reaction was incubated at 37 °C for 3 h and included 40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1, 22 mm MgCl2, 2 mm spermidine, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 4 mm of each NTP (Sigma), 10 mm GMP (Sigma), 0.05% Triton X-100, 10 mg/ml yeast inorganic pyrophosphatase, 0.1 mg/ml digested template, and 50 μg/ml T7 polymerase. Reactions were stopped by phenol and chloroform extraction, precipitated with ethanol, and resuspended in gel loading buffer (8 m urea, 20% sucrose, 0.1% bromphenol blue, 0.1% xylene cyanol). For ribozyme constructs before the phenol extraction, reaction mixtures were diluted five times and incubated for 1 h at 60 °C to enhance autocatalytic cleavage. The transcripts were purified on a denaturing polyacrylamide gel (12% acrylamide:bisacrylamide (19:1), 8 m urea, 89 mm Tris borate, pH 8.3, 2 mm EDTA) and electroeluted from the gel using a Schleicher & Schuell Biotrap. The transcripts were extracted with phenol and chloroform, precipitated with ethanol, resuspended in sterile water, and stored at −20 °C.

Romine (Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, Richland, WA). Cells were grown, and DNA was extracted by standard procedures. ChromosomalR. palustris DNA was from C. S. Harwood (Iowa University, Iowa City, IA), Cytophaga hutchinsonii DNA was from M. J. McBride (University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee, Milwaukee, WI), Borrelia burgdorferi DNA was from P. Rosa (National Institutes of Health, Hamilton, MT), Clostridium sticklandiiDNA was from A. Pich (Universität Halle-Wittenberg, Germany) (27Kabisch U.C. Grantzdorffer A. Schierhorn A. Rucknagel K.P.

Bertani (California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, CA),Deinococcus radiodurans DNA was from D. Tumbula-Hansen (Yale University, New Haven, CT), and A. aeolicus DNA was from T. Steitz (Yale University, New Haven, CT). The coding sequences of the proS genes were amplified by PCR from genomic DNA and cloned into the pCR2.1 TOPO vector. Correct sequences were subsequently recloned into pET15b (Invitrogen) for expression of the N-terminally His6-tagged protein in theE. coli BL21-Codon Plus (DE3)-RIL strain. Deletions in the insertion sequence of the E. coli proS from nucleotide (amino acid) positions 559–1128 (196–376) [ECdel1], 634–1182 (211–394) [ECdel2], 691–1050 (230–350) [ECdel3] (see Fig. 1), and 652–1218 (217–406) [ECdel4] were prepared by site-directed mutagenesis, and the genes were subcloned into pET20b for expression of C-terminally His6-tagged proteins. The resulting deletion genes encoded the extra 16 amino acids (LKGEFCRTPSHWRPLE) originating from the TOPO vector on the C terminus just before the His6-tag sequence. For comparison, theE. coli wild-type proS gene was also cloned in the same fashion. Deletion of nucleotides (amino acids) 691-1041 (230–347) of the A. aeolicus proS gene [AAdel1], corresponding to the ECdel3 mutant of E. coli, was also made. The mutant gene was cloned into the pET15b vector. Cultures were grown at 37 °C in Luria-Bertani (LB) medium supplemented with 100 μg/ml ampicillin and 34 μg/ml chloramphenicol. Expression of the His6-tagged protein was induced for 2–3 h at 30 °C with the addition of 1 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside before cell harvesting. Expression of the ProRS deletion enzymes was induced with 0.2 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside at 28 °C for 1 h. The enzymes were purified by nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid chromatography as described previously (22Feng L. Stathopoulos C. Ahel I. Mitra A. Tumbula-Hansen D. Hartsch T. Söll D. Extremophiles. 2002; 6: 167-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). The His6-ProRSs were >95% pure as judged by Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining after SDS-PAGE. Active fractions were pooled and dialyzed against reaction buffer (50 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.2, 50 mm KCl, 15 mm MgCl2, 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 1 mm benzamidine) containing 40% glycerol and stored at −20 °C. The E. coli ProRS enzyme was further purified on DEAE-cellulose and Uno S columns to minimize the possibility of E. colicysteinyl-tRNA synthetase contamination. For the DEAE-cellulose column, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and a gradient of KCl (0–200 mm) were used. For the Uno S column, a gradient of potassium phosphate (20–200 mm), pH 6.8, was used. Active site titration was performed to determine the amount of active enzyme in the preparation. The formation of ProRS·Pro-AMP complexes took place in 100 μl of the 0.5× EAP buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2) containing 0.5 units of inorganic pyrophosphatase and 20 μm[14C]proline (500 cpm/pmol) in the presence of varying concentrations of ProRSs (0.2–5 μm). After 1–10-min incubation, aliquots of 30 μl were spotted onto nitrocellulose filters, filtered, and washed twice with 5 ml of 0.5× EAP buffer. The filters were dried, and the radioactivity was measured by liquid scintillation counting. The reaction mixture (200 μl) contained 50 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.2, 15 mm MgCl2, 50 mm KCl, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm potassium fluoride, 2 mm ATP, l-proline, orl-cysteine varying from 5–500 μm forK m determinations, 2 mm[32P]pyrophosphate (2 cpm/pmol) and, when indicated, 1 mg/ml of suitable unfractionated tRNA (E. coliin the case of bacterial enzymes, M. jannaschii for archaeal ProRs, and yeast for eukaryotic ProRSs). ProRS concentrations ranged from 2–10 nm for proline activation and from 200–4000 nm for cysteine activation. After various incubation times, the [32P]ATP present in 40-μl aliquots of the reaction mixture was specifically adsorbed on acid-washed Norit (200 μl of a 1% suspension (w/v) of Norit in 0.4 m sodium pyrophosphate solution containing 15% (v/v) perchloric acid) rinsed with 25 ml of water and 10 ml of ethanol on Whatman GF/C fiberglass filter disks, dried, and with the radioactivity determined by liquid scintillation counting. Reactions were performed at 37 °C with the exception ofT. thermophilus, A. aeolicus, M. jannaschii, and M. thermautotrophicus ProRSs where the reaction temperature was 60 °C. K m and k cat values were determined using Hanes-Wolf plots. The standard reaction mixture (100 μl) contained 50 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.2, 50 mmKCl, 15 mm MgCl2, 5 mmdithiothreitol, 10 mm ATP, 50 μm[3H]proline (200 cpm/pmol) or 50 μm[35S]cysteine (500 cpm/pmol), 1 mg/ml of suitable unfractionated tRNA, and 1–10 nm purified recombinant ProRSs for the proline charging or 40–2000 nm for cysteine. Radioactive aminoacyl-tRNAs synthesized after 1–30 min were quantified in 20-μl aliquots as described previously (15Stathopoulos C., Li, T. Longman R. Vothknecht U.C. Becker H.D. Ibba M. Söll D. Science. 2000; 287: 479-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Cys-tRNAProwas generated by charging of unfractionated E. coli tRNA with C. sticklandii ProRS. Mischarged E. coliAla-tRNAPro was generated by charging either theE. coli tRNAPro transcript or unfractionated E. coli tRNA with D. radioduransProRS. Charging reactions were performed in standard reaction buffer using 50 μm [35S]cysteine or 500 μm [3H]alanine. After phenol and chloroform extraction, the tRNA was precipitated with ethanol and the precipitate was washed and dried. 0.5–2 μm of charged tRNA were used in the 60-μl reaction. The deacylation assay was performed as described previously (8Beuning P.J. Musier-Forsyth K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 8916-8920Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). The reaction was initiated with 20 nm to 2 μm enzyme, and at each time point, 13-μl aliquots were removed. As a positive control, 0.1 mNaOH was used instead of the enzyme. Reactions were quenched on Whatman 3MM filters pre-soaked with 10% trichloroacetic acid, washed, and quantified as described for aminoacylation assays. Because archaeal ProRS enzymes charge cysteine in addition to proline onto tRNA (15Stathopoulos C., Li, T. Longman R. Vothknecht U.C. Becker H.D. Ibba M. Söll D. Science. 2000; 287: 479-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), we wanted to determine whether this property is widespread among this family of enzymes. Therefore, we selected proS genes from a number of organisms so that enzymes from all domains of life, as well as from the two different structural classes, were represented. The archaeal examples were M. jannaschii and M. thermautotrophicus, whereas Saccharomyces cerevisiaerepresented the eukarya. We used a larger number of bacterial enzymes as both archaeal-type and bacterial-type ProRS proteins are represented here. For the archaeal-type proS, T. thermophilus, D. radiodurans, C. sticklandii, N. aromaticivorans, C. hutchinsonii, B. burgdorferi, and M. magnetotacticum were selected, whereas the bacterial-type ProRS was cloned from E. coli and the hyperthermophileA. aeolicus. An atypical bacterial-type ProRS lacking the insertion domain was cloned from R. palustris. Because the insertion domain appears to be involved in editing (28Wong F.C. Beuning P.J. Nagan M. Shiba K. Musier-Forsyth K. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 7108-7115Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), we wanted to generate forms of the E. coli and A. aeolicus enzymes that lack partially or completely the 180-amino acid insertion domain. Not unexpectedly, only two of the enzymes could be expressed in a stable form. This was the ProRS ECdel3 enzyme (see Fig. 1) with 452 amino acids compared with 572 amino acids in wild-type E. coli ProRS. Similarly, the A. aeolicus ProRS AAdel1 lacked 117 amino acids from the wild-type open reading frame of 570. In both of these enzyme constructs, only 65% of the insertion domain was deleted; however, they were significantly less stable than the wild-type enzymes. Kinetic parameters of cysteine and proline activation were determined by ATP-PPiexchange (Table I). It is clear that all of the ProRSs tested are able to use cysteine as substrate. Cysteine activation (expressed ask cat/K m) by these ProRSs was 30–1400-fold lower than the activation of the cognate proline. The “affinities” of ProRSs for cysteine were surprisingly high (K m values ranging from 10–260 μm), which was in most cases even higher than those for proline (K m values ranging from 50–290 μm). However, turnover numbers for cysteine activation were severely decreased compared with proline (k cat dropped 150–2300-fold). Thus, cysteine activation is still considerably poorer than proline activation. Alanine for comparison was also detectably activated by ProRSs (20Beuning P.J. Musier-Forsyth K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30779-30785Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). It has a profoundly poorer affinity than cysteine or proline (K m values between 31–500 mm); however the k cat values are 10-fold higher than those for cysteine (data not shown). Thus, cysteine is still a significantly better substrate in ATP-PPiexchange than alanine. Although the addition of unfractionated tRNA significantly improved cysteine activation in most cases, cysteine activation can always be observed in the absence of tRNA (23Jacquin-Becker C. Ahel I. Ambrogelly A. Ruan B. Söll D. Stathopoulos C. FEBS Lett. 2002; 514: 34-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar, 29Lipman R.S.A. Beuning P.J. Musier-Forsyth K. Hou Y.M. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 316: 421-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). tRNA-dependent cysteine activation is a property common to both archaeal-type and bacterial-type ProRS families. The activation of cysteine by M. jannaschii ProRS, for instance, was found to be stimulated up to 4-fold in the presence of unfractionated tRNA, whereas a 2-fold stimulation was observed for A. aeolicus ProRS (data not shown). The ability of all ProRS enzymes to charge cysteine onto unfractionated tRNA was tested by the standard aminoacylation assay and compared to the reaction with proline. In this assay, the source of tRNA for most ProRSs was E. coli. The archaeal enzymes were tested withM. jannaschii tRNA and S. cerevisiaeProRS with homologous tRNA. Most of the enzymes charged tRNA with cysteine to a similar plateau level as with proline (data not shown). The ratio of the initial velocities of proline versuscysteine charging is plotted in Fig. 2. As can be seen, the values greatly vary from 7 to 4900. The archaeal enzymes and the closely related ProRS from the primitive eukaryoteG. lamblia showed the best cysteine charging, whereas the eukaryotic S. cerevisiae enzyme showed the lowest. However, even the bacterial-type A. aeolicus ProRS charges cysteine very well. The effect of the insertion domain on cysteine charging was investigated with the E. coli enzyme. The partial lack of this domain in the bacterial-type ProRS ECdel3 showed a 2.3-fold increase in the relative cysteine charging when compared with the intact E. coli ProRS. To determine tRNA specificity of the ProRS enzymes, transcripts of E. colitRNAPro(CGG) or M. jannaschiitRNAPro(UGG) (for the archaeal P"
https://openalex.org/W2168663371,"The continuing drive by the semiconductor industry to fabricate smaller structures using photolithography will soon require dimensional control at length scales comparable to the size of the polymeric molecules in the materials used to pattern them. The current technology, chemically amplified photoresists, uses a complex reaction-diffusion process to delineate patterned areas with high spatial resolution. However, nanometer-level control of this critical process is limited by the lack of direct measurements of the reaction front. We demonstrate the use of x-ray and neutron reflectometry as a general method to measure the spatial evolution of the reaction-diffusion process with nanometer resolution. Measuring compositional profiles, provided by deuterium-labeled reactant groups for neutron scattering contrast, we show that the reaction front within the material is broad rather than sharply defined and the compositional profile is altered during development. Measuring the density profile, we directly correlate the developed film structure with that of the reaction front."
https://openalex.org/W2025605569,"The third isoform of mammalian metallothioneins (MT-3), mainly expressed in brain and down-regulated in Alzheimer's disease, exhibits neuroinhibitory activity in vitro and a highly flexible structure that distinguishes it from the widely expressed MT-1/-2 isoforms. Previously, we showed that two conserved prolyl residues of MT-3 are crucial for both the bioactivity and cluster dynamics of this isoform. We have now used genetic engineering to introduce these residues into mouse MT-1. The S6P,S8P MT-1 mutant is inactive in neuronal survival assays. However, the additional introduction of the unique Thr5 insert of MT-3 resulted in a bioactive MT-1 form. Temperature-dependent and saturation transfer113Cd NMR experiments performed on the113Cd-reconstituted wild-type and mutant Cd7-MT-1 forms revealed that the gain of MT-3-like neuronal inhibitory activity is paralleled by an increase in conformational flexibility and intersite metal exchange in the N-terminal Cd3-thiolate cluster. The observed correlation suggests that structure/cluster dynamics are critical for the biological activity of MT-3. We propose that the interplay between the specific Pro-induced conformational requirements and those of the metal-thiolate bonds gives rise to an alternate and highly fluctuating cluster ensemble kinetically trapped by the presence of the5TCPCP9 motif. The functional significance of such heterogeneous cluster ensemble is discussed."

 explains in his Perspective, several recent studies provide evidence that tidal forces influence earthquakes associated with volcanic activity. This idea was first suggested in the 1930s, but the forces involved were long considered too weak and the evidence too limited. Recent results from the Juan de Fuca Ridge in the Pacific show a particularly clear diurnal pattern attributed to ocean tides."

Fringe modulates functions of the Notch receptor by extending O-linked fucosylation sites in EGF modules of Notch. UDP-N-acetylglucosamine:Fucα1-O-Ser β1,3-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferases (O-Fuc β3GlcNAc-transferase)1encoded by mammalian fringe orthologs control theO-linked fucosylation pathway and allow synthesis of the sialylated tetrasaccharide NeuAcβ2–3Galβ1–4GlcNAcβ1–3Fucα1-O-Ser (6Moloney D.J.

Fringe may compete with an alternate glycosylation pathway controlled by an UDP-glucose:Fucα1-O-Ser β3-glucosyltransferase (6Moloney D.J. Shair L.H., Lu, F.M. Xia J. Locke R. Matta K.L.

In Drosophila, brainiac mutants produce defects that resemble those produced by loss of Notch function during oogenesis. Consequently, brainiac protein has been considered as a possible modulator of Notch activity (2Goode S. Morgan M. Liang Y.P. Mahowald A.P. Dev. Biol. 1996; 178: 35-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Brainiac activity is required in the developing germ line for proper organization of the follicle. Some of the defects associated with loss of brainiac activity in germ line cells resemble defects associated with loss of Notch activity. Recently, the role of Notch and its ligand Delta in signaling between germ line and somatic cells has been clarified (7Lopez-Schier H. St Johnston D. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 1393-1405Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). Delta is expressed in germ line cells and required for activation of Notch in somatic follicle cells at two stages of oogenesis. The defects associated with loss of Notch activity resemble the defects associated with loss of brainiac in some respects, but differ in other respects. By analogy to the role of fringe as a modifier of Notch, it is possible that brainiac acts in the germ line to modify Delta and contribute to signaling between germ line and somatic cells. However, it is also possible that brainiac acts differently to influence multiple interactions between germ line and somatic cells. In the present study we demonstrate that Drosophila brainiac is a β3GlcNAc-transferase similar to fringe. However, brainiac has different acceptor substrate specificity and transfers to β-linked mannose as well as β-linked galactose residues. The core structure ofDrosophila glycosphingolipids consists of mactosylceramide (Manβ1–4Glcβ1-Cer; MacCer), and this is extended by a β1–3 linked GlcNAc residue to the terminal mannose residue (8Seppo A. Tiemeyer M. Glycobiology. 2000; 10: 751-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). It is suggested that brainiac has its primary role in glycosphingolipid biosynthesis and thereby affects glycosphingolipid mediated receptor modulation and functions mediated by lipid rafts. tBLASTn analysis withbrainiac was used to search the Drosophila melanogaster whole genome data base GadFly released by the Berkeley Drosophila Genome Project (BDGP, Release 2 and 3) (9Adams M.D. Celniker S.E.

An expression construct of the full coding region of brainiac was prepared by PCR using D. melanogaster (Canton S) genomic DNA (CLONTECH) with the sense primer MAB1 (5′-AGCGGATCCGCCATGCAAAGTAAACACCGC-3′) and the antisense primer MAB3 (5′-AGCGGATCCTGCTACGCGTAATTGGCGG-3′) with BamHI restriction sites. The PCR product was cloned into the BamHI site of pVL1393 (PharMingen). Two N-terminal truncated constructs were prepared to obtain soluble secreted brainiac.

The secreted brainiac constructs were assayed with 5–20 μl of culture supernatant from infected cells. The His- and T7-tagged secreted brainiac protein was purified by nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid affinity chromatography (Qiagen) as described by the manufacturer. In addition this protein was immunoprecipitated with anti-T7 antibody agarose (Novagen) as described by the manufacturer, and enzyme assays were performed on washed beads as well as after elution at low pH.

Approximately 50 ml of packed cells were extracted in 2-propanol-n-hexane-water (55/25/20, v/v/v, upper phase removed) and subjected to Folch partition in chloroform-methanol-water (4/2/1, v/v/v). The dried lower phase glycolipids were freed from other lipids by peracetylation (pyridine-acetic anhydride 2:1 v/v), chromatography on Florisil, and base-catalyzedO-deacetylation (14Saito T. Hakomori S.I. J. Lipid Res. 1971; 12: 257-259Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and analyzed by HPTLC. Further fractionation of wild type High Five™ glycolipids was carried out by preparative-scale high performance liquid chromatography. The structures of the di- and triglycosylceramide fractions were determined by 1H NMR spectroscopy and electrospray ionization mass spectrometry to be Manβ1–4Glcβ1–1Cer and Galβ1–4Manβ1–4Glcβ1–1Cer, respectively. 2M. Fuller, T. Schwientek, H. Clausen, and S. B. Levery, manuscript in preparation. Total CTH from control and brainiac transfected High Five cells were isolated from the crude lower phase lipids by preparative HPTLC and compared by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry as described below. The products formed by brainiac with Man-β-methylumbelliferone (Manβ1-MeUmb) (4 mg), High Five™ MacCer (2 mg), and human Galβ1–4Glcβ1-Cer (2 mg) were analyzed. The substrates were glycosylated with microsomes prepared from High FiveTM cells infected with pVL-brainiac-full using thin-layer chromatography to monitor reaction progress. The reaction products were purified by application to octadecyl-silica cartridges (Bakerbond, J. T. Baker), followed by stepwise elution with increasing concentrations of methanol in water (13Almeida R. Amado M. David L. Levery S.B. Holmes E.H. Merkx G. van Kessel A.G. Rygaard E. Hassan H. Bennett E. Clausen H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31979-31991Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar); the product of reaction with MacCer was further purified by preparative-scale HPTLC (chloroform-methanol-0.5% aqueous CaCl2, 50:40:10 v/v/v), with isolation of the fraction migrating as a trihexosylceramide, prior to NMR and mass spectrometry analysis as described below. Glycosphingolipid products were deuterium exchanged by repeated addition of CDCl3-CD3OD 2:1, sonication, and evaporation under nitrogen, then dissolved in 0.5 ml of Me2SO-d6/2% D2O (containing 0.03% tetramethylsilane as chemical shift reference) for NMR analysis. A one-dimensional 1H NMR spectrum was acquired on the product with LacCer on a 600 MHz Varian Inova spectrometer at 35 °C, with solvent suppression by presaturation pulse. Its identity was established by comparison of the spectrum with those of relevant standards acquired under identical conditions (15Levery S.B. Holmes E.H. Harris D.D. Hakomori S. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 1069-1080Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). For the product with MacCer, one-dimensional 1H, two-dimensional 1H-1H gCOSY, TOCSY, and NOESY NMR spectra were acquired on a Varian Inova 800 MHz spectrometer at 55 °C. The product with Manβ1-MeUmb eluting from the octadecyl-silica cartridge with 20 and 30% MeOH was deuterium exchanged by repeated lyophilization from D2O and dissolved in 100% D2O (containing a trace of acetone as chemical shift reference) for NMR analysis. One-dimensional 1H, two-dimensional 1H-1H gCOSY and TOCSY, and two-dimensional 1H-detected 1H-13C gHSQC and gHMBC NMR spectra were acquired on the Varian Inova 600 MHz spectrometer at 20 °C; a directly detected one-dimensional13C NMR spectrum was acquired on a Varian Inova 500 MHz spectrometer. Molecular mass profiles of glycosphingolipids were acquired on an Axima-CFR (Shimadzu/Kratos Analytical, Manchester, UK) MALDI-TOF mass spectrometer operating in positive ion reflectron mode (pulsed N2 laser with delayed extraction; emission wavelength 337 nm; acceleration potential 5 kV). The matrix employed was 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid; samples were premixed with a solution of 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid (10 mg/ml) in acetonitrile-0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (1:1, v/v) prior to application and drying on the target. Molecular species were detected as their Na+ adducts; angiotensin II and Pro14-Arg were used as external mass calibration standards (monoisotopic masses 1046.5 and 1533.9 Da, respectively). Brainiac products formed with lactose, Galβ1–4Man, and d-mannose were prepared by incubating 1 μmol of acceptor sugars with 100 nmol of UDP-[14C]GlcNAc (3900 cpm/nmol) and brainiac microsomes in reaction buffer. The reaction products were purified on Dowex 1-X8 and octadecyl-silica cartridges and freeze-dried. The resolubilized products were digested with 10 units of β-galactosidase (Escherichia coli, Sigma) for 2 h or 312 milliunits of β-N-acetylglucosaminidase (jack bean, Sigma) overnight and purified by mixed bed resin chromatography (Sigma) followed by lyophilization. Resolubilized samples were analyzed by thin-layer chromatography in chloroform-methanol-water (30:60:10 v/v/v) and autoradiography. Expression of the full coding region ofbrainiac resulted in marked increase in GlcNAc-transferase activity using free d-mannose in a screen assay as developed for study of the activity of fringe (4Bru¨ckner K. Perez L. Clausen H. Cohen S. Nature. 2000; 406: 411-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (590) Google Scholar). Analysis of activities with monosaccharides at varying concentrations up to 500 mm with brainiac and fringe is shown in Fig.1. d-Mannose was the best substrate for brainiac, but at high concentrationsl-fucose, and to a lesser extent d-galactose, was used as acceptor as well. The activity of brainiac with fucose was comparable with that of fringe, and fringe also appeared to have weak activity with mannose. It should be noted that the assays were quantitated for total microsomal protein, but the relative levels of enzyme expressions are unknown, and the putative products withl-fucose were not characterized. The activities were only measurable at acceptor concentrations over 50 mm. In the case of fringe it did originally indicate that this enzyme functioned with O-linked fucose (4Bru¨ckner K. Perez L. Clausen H. Cohen S. Nature. 2000; 406: 411-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (590) Google Scholar), and later studies suggest that mammalian fringe variants lunatic and manic exhibit distinct specificities for the peptide sequence carrying O-Fuc (16Shimizu K. Chiba S. Saito T. Kumano K. Takahashi T. Hirai H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 25753-25758Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). The high activity at low concentrations brainiac exhibits with other substrates than fucose clearly indicates that brainiac does not function in glycosylation of O-linked fucose. TableI summarizes activities obtained with a large panel of saccharide and saccharide derivative substrates using UDP-GlcNAc donor sugar nucleotide. No activity above background values was obtained with other donor sugar nucleotides (UDP-Glc, UDP-Gal, UDP-GalNAc, and UDP-xylose) (not shown). Analysis of substrates containing terminal β-linked mannose (β-Man) and α-linked mannose showed strong preference for β-Man with monosaccharide derivatives and near exclusive activity for β-Man structures with disaccharides and larger. In agreement with free galactose serving as substrate several disaccharides with terminal β-Gal were used as acceptor. Galβ1–4Man, lactose, and benzyl-β-lactose were substrates, while related N-acetylated structures (Galβ1–4ManNAc,N-acetyllactosamine, benzyl-β-N-acetyllactosamine) were poorly active. Analysis of apparent Km for the most active substrates identified showed that Manβ1-MeUmb was the preferred acceptor substrate, and the disaccharides Galβ1–4Man and Galβ1–4Glc were used with significantly lower affinity (TableII).Table IIKinetic properties of brainiac β1–3-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferaseSubstratebrainiac2-aEnzyme sources were as described in Table I.KmVmaxnmol/h/mgManβ1-MeUmb2-bDetermined with donor substrate UDP-[14C]GlcNAc (300 μm).2.0 ± 0.7 mm24.5 ± 2.6Galβ1–4Man2-bDetermined with donor substrate UDP-[14C]GlcNAc (300 μm).7.3 ± 0.7 mm32.0 ± 0.9Galβ1–4Glc2-bDetermined with donor substrate UDP-[14C]GlcNAc (300 μm).22.7 ± 2.1 mm23.7 ± 0.7UDP-GlcNAc2-cDetermined with acceptor substrate Galβ1–4Man (40 mm).185.0 ± 15.0 μm17.9 ± 0.62-a Enzyme sources were as described in Table I.2-b Determined with donor substrate UDP-[14C]GlcNAc (300 μm).2-c Determined with acceptor substrate Galβ1–4Man (40 mm). Open table in a new tab Several attempts to generate a soluble secreted brainiac protein with good catalytic activity were performed. Initially, we used an untagged construct based on amino acid residues 23–325, but no activity was found in the culture medium of infected insect cells (not shown). Second, a N-terminally tagged construct based on amino acid residues 28–325 was expressed and a specific protein reactive with an anti-HIS antibody of predicted molecular weight was found by Western blot SDS-PAGE analysis. Low activity with Manβ1-MeUmb acceptor substrate was detected in the culture medium (∼2–3-fold over background). Purification of the His-tagged protein by nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid chromatography resulted in purification of an inactive protein (not shown). Immunoprecipitation with anti-T7 antibody resulted in specific precipitation of low activity (∼3–4-fold over background), but elution inactivated the protein. We did not further pursue the enzymatic properties of the soluble brainiac protein. In our experience several of the glycosyltransferases acting exclusively in the glycolipid biosynthetic pathways are enzymatically inactive as truncated soluble recombinant proteins expressed in insect cells (17Steffensen R.

Several parameters for the brainiac assay with microsomal fractions were analyzed for optimization. The most critical parameter was found to be the detergent solubilization. Triton X-100, Triton CF-54, and Nonidet P-40 had strong inhibiting effect on activity at 0.1%, whilen-octyl glucoside at 3.4 mm (0.1%) activated the enzyme. The pH optimum of brainiac activity was neutral (pH 7.4). Addition of 5–10 mm MnCl2 activated enzyme activity, and MgCl2 and CaCl2 had no effect, while the presence of EDTA destroyed the activity. The product of brainiac with Manβ1-MeUmb was determined by NMR analysis to be GlcNAcβ1–3Manβ1-MeUmb, as follows. As shown in Fig.2A, the fraction of product eluted from octadecyl-silica by 20% MeOH exhibited sets of1H resonances indicating a mixture of two compounds (two sets of β-Man H-1 and H-2 signals in proportion ∼6:4, at 5.408/4.339 and 5.436/4.242 ppm, respectively). One set clearly corresponds to unreacted starting material and the other to a product of glycosylation by β-GlcNAc (additional H-1 signal at 4.757 ppm,3J1,2 = 8.5 Hz, NAc signal at 2.085 ppm). Following complete assignment of 1H and13C resonances from all three monosaccharide spin systems present (see Table III) by two-dimensional 1H-1H gCOSY and TOCSY, one-dimensional 13C, and two-dimensional1H-detected 1H-13C gHSQC experiments (not shown), the connectivity between the β-GlcNAc and the more abundant β-Man spin system was established unambiguously as a 1→3 linkage by a two-dimensional gHMBC experiment. This spectrum (Fig. 2B) shows clear interglycosidic three-bond correlations between the β-GlcNAc H-1 and the downfield-shifted β-Man C-3 (79.61 versus 72.44 ppm), as well as between the corresponding β-HexNAc C-1 (98.81 ppm) and the downfield-shifted β-Man H-3 (3.986 versus 3.804 ppm). Slight upfield shifts of the corresponding β-Man C-2 and C-4 resonances in the product compared with the non-glycosylated starting material (Table III) are also consistent with the β1→3 linkage.Table III1H, 13C chemical shifts (ppm) and 3J1,2coupling constants (Hz, in parentheses) for Manβ1-MeUmb substrate and biosynthetic GlcNAcβ1–3Manβ1-MeUmb productManβ1-MeUmb, Manβ3-aData were obtained in D2O at 20 °C.

Open table in a new tab Brainiac showed high activity with the disaccharides Galβ1–4Man and Galβ1–4Glc. d-Galactose and Galβ-MU were poor substrates with no activity detected at 20 mm.d-Galactose in excess of 100 mm did, however, show significant activity. Since the enzyme transfers GlcNAc to bothd-galactose and d-mannose monosaccharides, it was necessary to determine which sugar served as the acceptor in the disaccharide substrate Galβ1–4Man. This was done by analysis of sensitivity to exoglycosidase treatment.

While the relationships between brn and specific signaling pathways have been examined genetically, the nature of these interactions remained elusive as long as the biochemical function ofbrn was unclear. In the present study, we show thatbrn has a β1,3N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase (GlcNAcT) activity directed toward the Man(β1,4)Glc core structure of arthro-series glycolipids. The brn gene was amplified by PCR from D. melanogaster OregonR genomic DNA during 30 cycles at 95 °C for 45 s, 55 °C for 30 s, 72 °C for 60 s using the primers 5′-TTTGGATCCGTCGCCATGCAAAGT-3′ and 5′-CCTGTTCTAGATGCTACGCGTAAT-3′. The resulting 1.0-kb fragment was digested with BamHI and XbaI and subcloned into the pFastbac-FLAG(a) vector (Invitrogen) linearized at the BamHI andXbaI sites. The FLAG-tagged brn gene was expressed as a recombinant baculovirus in insect cells as described previously (13Hennet T. Dinter A. Kuhnert P. Mattu T.S. Rudd P.M. Berger E.G. J. Biol.

All donor and acceptor substrates were from Sigma except Man(β1,4)Glc(β1-OpNP) (pNP =p-nitrophenyl), which was purchased from Toronto Research (North York, Canada).

Extracts were spun twice at 500 x g, and supernatants were dried under N2. Phospholipids were removed by saponification in 0.2m NaOH in methanol for 24 h at 37 °C. After neutralization with HCl, the extracts were expanded to theoretical upper phase (methanol:water:chloroform, 47:48:3), applied on C18 SepPak cartridges, and eluted with 5 ml of methanol. Eluates were dried under N2 and resuspended in 500 μl of methanol. The procedure yielded about 120 μg of mannose equivalents for 108 S2 and Sf9 cells and 20 μg of mannose equivalents from 107 Caco-2 cells as determined by the phenol sulfuric acid assay (19Dubois M.

Then, white+ progeny was selected and X-chromosomal insertions of the transgene excluded. The GAL4 lines, driving ubiquitous expression of the UAS-transgenes in anarmadillo pattern (24Sanson B.

At least two independent lines of each transgene were used for the complementation assay, which were repeated four times. A mixture of substrate and of 10 nmol of product was separated by reversed phase HPLC on a 3 × 250 mm column filled with 5 μm ODS Hypersil (Shandon) at a flow rate of 0.6 ml/min. The column was eluted with a linear gradient from 6 to 24% of methanol during 18 min in 0.1 m ammonium acetate, pH 4.0. p-Nitrophenylglycosides were monitored at 245 nm. The mixture was also analyzed after incubation withN-acetyl-β-hexosaminidase from jack beans (Sigma) (25Wilson I.B. Zeleny R. Kolarich D. Staudacher E. Stroop C.J. Kamerling J.P. Altmann F. Glycobiology. 2001; 11: 261-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). The fraction of interest was collected in a screw capped glass vial and dried in a speed-vac concentrator. A small aliquot was used for matrix assisted laser desorption mass spectrometry as described elsewhere (25Wilson I.B. Zeleny R. Kolarich D. Staudacher E. Stroop C.J. Kamerling J.P. Altmann F.

Partially permethylated alditol acetates were prepared using NaBD4 as the reducing agent and analyzed by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry using a 60 m SP2330 (Restek) (27Doares S.H. Albersheim P. Darvill A.G. Carbohydr. Res. 1991; 210: 311-317Crossref Scopus (51) Google Scholar) and a Finnigan Ion Trap ITD800. Derivatives of terminal and 3-substituted galactose served to compare retention times with the data given by Doares et al.(27Doares S.H. Albersheim P. Darvill A.G. Carbohydr. Res. 1991; 210: 311-317Crossref Scopus (51) Google Scholar). We have cloned the D. melanogaster brn gene by PCR amplification and expressed it as an N-terminally FLAG-tagged full-length protein in Sf9 insect cells. The recombinantbrn protein was bound to anti-FLAG-agarose beads, and cellular contaminants such as possible endogenous acceptor substrates were washed out before assaying for enzymatic activity. A GlcNAcT activity was only detected toward the Man(β1-OpNP) acceptor when monosaccharide substrates were assayed (TableI). Highest activity was measured toward the disaccharide acceptor Man(β1,4)Glc(β1-OpNP), whereas a slight activity was also detected toward Gal(β1,4)Glc(β1-OpNP) (Table I). The Man(β1,4)Glc structure represents the core of arthro-series glycolipids found in nematodes (28Gerdt S. Lochnit G. Dennis R.D. Geyer R. Glycobiology. 1997; 7: 265-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) and insects (29Wiegandt H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1123: 117-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) among others. In Drosophila, the arthro-series Man(β1,4)Glc core is elongated with a β1,3-linked GlcNAc (30Seppo A. Moreland M. Schweingruber H. Tiemeyer M. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 3549-3558Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), suggesting thatbrn may represent the enzyme catalyzing this step. To test this hypothesis, we have isolated neutral glycolipids fromDrosophila S2 and Spodoptera Sf9 cells and assayed these glycolipids as acceptors for the anti-FLAG beads-boundbrn enzyme. A significant GlcNAc-transferase activity was detected when incubating brn together with insect glycolipids, whereas only a low activity was measured with glycolipids extracted from mammalian Caco-2 cells, likely reflecting the low specificity of brn for lactosylceramide. The reaction products were separated by TLC and plates were autoradiographed, revealing a [14C]GlcNAc-labeled band at the size of a trihexoside ceramide in S2 and Sf9 cells (Fig.1). The nature of the linkage between GlcNAc and the underlying β-linked Man residue was investigated by methylation analysis of thebrn reaction product GlcNAc-Man(β1-OpNP). In reversed phase HPLC, the presumed disaccharide product eluted slightly ahead of the substrate Man(β1-OpNP). The disaccharide peak disappeared upon incubation with N-acetyl-β-hexosaminidase (Fig.2A). The purified fraction corresponding to the disaccharide peak exhibited a pseudomolecular ion of m/z 513.5. Linkage analysis of the GlcNAc-Man(β1-OpNP) disaccharide product gave a peak at the relative retention time of 0.597, which suggests a 2- or a 3-substituted mannosyl residue (27Doares S.H. Albersheim P. Darvill A.G. Carbohydr. Res. 1991; 210: 311-317Crossref Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The fragment spectrum clearly identified the derivative as substituted in the 3-position (Fig.2B), thus confirming the identity of brn as a β1,3 GlcNAcT. The brn protein is structurally related to human β1,3 glycosyltransferase enzymes (12Yuan Y.P. Schultz J. Mlodzik M. Bork P.

The human β3GnT transgenes and a brn transgene were expressed in flies carrying the allele brn1.6P6, which causes lethality at the late pupal stage. The transgenes were expressed ubiquitously using armadillo GAL4 transactivator lines. The brn transgene did rescuebrn1.6P6 mutant males from their hemizygous late pupal lethality, whereas the human β3GnT transgenes did not (TableII). The rescue ofbrn1.6P6 males was confirmed by detection of theforked marker, whose gene is located besides thebrn1.6P6 allele on the X chromosome. Control crosses of females carrying brn1.6P6 with yellow white males did not yield any living brn1.6P6forked/Y males either. The inability of human β3GnT enzymes to compensate for the loss of brn activity in mutant flies suggested that the former enzymes cannot elongate the arthro-series glycolipid core in vivo. This was confirmedin vitro by showing that the human β3GnT enzymes did not exhibit significant activity toward the Man(β1,4)Glc(β1-OpNP) acceptor (Table II).Table IIComplementation of Drosophila brn1.6P6β1,3GlcNAcT gene2-aβ3GnT-I (21), β3GnT-IV (22), and β3GnT-V (20).Lines2-bNumber of independent lines per transgene tested.brn1.6P6 rescue2-cNumber of independent lines per transgene rescueing brn1.6P6 (34).

Open table in a new tab Rescue of the brn1.6P6 late pupal lethal phenotype by ubiquitous expression of Drosophila brn and human β1,3GlcNAcT transgenes. We have shown that Drosophila brn, a member of the β1,3 glycosyltransferase family, encodes a β1,3 GlcNAcT enzyme with a specificity for the Man(β1,4)Glc disaccharide found in arthro-series glycolipids (29Wiegandt H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1123: 117-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Several mammalian enzymes structurally related to brn have been suggested to represent homologues (35Egan S.

Biol. 2001; 21: 5688-5697Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). However, the specificity of brn for Man(β1,4)Glc, a disaccharide that has never been described in vertebrates, rather indicates that brn and mammalian β1,3 glycosyltransferases are paralogous proteins derived from a common ancestor gene. The functional disparity between the β1,3 GlcNAcT brn and mammalian β1,3 GlcNAcT enzymes is further supported by the inability of the latter to complement the lethal phenotype of the mutant allelebrn1.6P6 in Drosophila. The specificity of brn toward Manβ1,4Glc-Cer suggests the presence of functional homologues only in organisms harboring arthro-series glycolipids, whose core structure is GlcNAc(β1,3)Man(β1,4)Glc-Cer. A protein structurally related to brn has recently been described in C. elegans (38Griffitts J.S. Whitacre J.L. Stevens D.E. Aroian R.V. Science. 2001; 293: 860-864Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar), which express arthro-series glycolipids (28Gerdt S. Lochnit G. Dennis R.D. Geyer R. Glycobiology. 1997; 7: 265-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The loss of that gene, named bre-5 (39Marroquin L.D. Elyassnia D. Griffitts J.S. Feitelson J.S. Aroian R.V. Genetics. 2000; 155: 1693-1699Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), renders the animal resistant to high doses of Bacillus thuringiensis Bt toxin. Since Bt toxin binds to arthro-series glycolipids (40Dennis R.D. Wiegandt H. Haustein D. Knowles B.H. Ellar D.J. Biomed. Chromatogr. 1986; 1: 31-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), it is possible that bre-5 participates in the formation of this class of glycolipids in C. elegans and thereby represents a true orthologue of brn. brn mutations affect follicle cell-germ line interactions and lead to neurogenic phenotypes in Drosophila embryos. Considering the involvement of brn in glycolipid biosynthesis, one can envision that arthro-series glycolipids may regulate cell adhesion, proliferation, and differentiation via carbohydrate-lectin interactions. On the other hand, arthro-series glycolipids may modulate specific signaling proteins in a way similar to gangliosides affecting the epidermal growth factor receptor (41Bremer E.G. Schlessinger J.

Neurochem. 1993; 61: 371-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) signaling cascades. The notion that brn glycolipid products interact with adhesion or signaling proteins implies that other mutant genes with phenotypes similar to those encountered inbrn mutant flies may encode partner lectin/signaling proteins. Along this line, Drosophila egghead mutants have similar and non-additive phenotypes to brn (17Goode S. Melnick M. Chou T.B. Perrimon N. Development (Camb.). 1996; 122: 3863-3879Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Experiments aimed at characterizing the biochemical and functional relation betweenbrn products and the egghead protein should reveal the mechanisms how arthro-series glycolipids regulate morphogenic events during Drosophila development.

Under nonreducing conditions it has a mass of 85 kDa, similar to convulxin, and on reduction gives two subunits with masses of 16 and 17 kDa, slightly larger than those of convulxin. The N-terminal sequences of both subunits are very similar to those of convulxin and other C-type lectins. Ophioluxin induces a pattern of tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins in platelets like that caused by convulxin, when using appropriate concentrations based on aggregation response, because it is about 2–4 times more powerful as agonist than the latter. Ophioluxin and convulxin induce [Ca2+]i elevation both in platelets and in Dami megakaryocytic cells, and each of these C-type lectins desensitizes responses to the other. Convulxin agglutinates fixed platelets at 2 μg/ml, whereas ophioluxin does not, even at 80 μg/ml. Ophioluxin resembles convulxin more than echicetin or alboaggregin B because polyclonal anti-ophioluxin antibodies recognize both ophioluxin and convulxin, but not echicetin, and platelets adhere to and spread on ophioluxin- or convulxin-precoated surfaces in the same way that is clearly different from their behavior on an alboaggregin B surface.

Integrin α2β1 belongs to the class containing an I-domain, which has been well characterized and is considered to be responsible for platelet adhesion to collagen rather than platelet activation (5Nieuwenhuis H.K.

The evidence that GPVI is the other major, established receptor essential for signaling and platelet activation was based on studies on patients with mild bleeding problems, whose platelets had an impaired response to collagen but not to other agonists and were GPVI-deficient (7Moroi M.

GPVI is a member of the Ig superfamily and has a sequence and structure very similar to FcαR and to some of the natural killer receptor family (13Clemetson J.M. Polgar J. Magnenat E. Wells T.N.C.

It forms a complex with the Fc receptor γ chain (Fcγ), which is critical not only for the signaling process, but also for the normal expression of this receptor in mice (14Tsuji M. Ezumi Y. Arai M.

Some inhibit the function of platelets by preventing ligand binding, others activate platelets either directly via receptors or indirectly using plasma proteins. Examples of these are echicetin, which uses IgMκ (19Navdaev A. Dormann D. Clemetson J.M. Clemetson K.J. Blood. 2001; 97: 2333-2341Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), or botrocetin and bitiscetin that bind von Willebrand factor (20Andrews R.K. Booth W.J. Gorman J.J. Castaldi P.A. Berndt M.C.

However, more detailed investigation, including the use of transfected cells expressing specific receptors and mice with genes for receptors “knocked out” have indicated that the situation may often be more complex. Alboaggregin A was previously reported to target GPIb but more recently has been shown to act principally by GPVI (22Andrews R.K. Kroll M.H. Rose J.W. Scarborough R.M. Smith A.J. Lopez J.A.

Obviously, these proteins have evolved in snakes as powerful agonists by interacting with several platelet receptors simultaneously. These multireceptor ligands are more difficult to use to study platelet signal pathways via single receptors because of cross-talk between the pathways although they may simulate some physiological ligands, such as von Willebrand factor, that also act via several receptors. Among the dozens purified so far only three snake C-type lectins have been characterized that target GPVI. Among them, alboaggregin A (23Dormann D. Clemetson J.M. Navdaev A. Kehrel B.E.

Haemostasis. 2002; 87: 692-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) act via both GPIb and GPVI. Convulxin was the first protein identified that acts via GPVI-binding and has been widely used for the isolation, characterization, and investigation of signaling mechanisms of this important receptor. However, the binding sites on GPVI for convulxin or collagen and how this binding activates platelets are still unknown, as well as whether convulxin has only one type of binding site on GPVI. A better knowledge of these points will be important for understanding why convulxin and similar snake C-type lectins are such powerful platelet agonists as well as investigating the mechanism of activation of platelets by collagen through GPVI. Additional GPVI ligands from snake venoms may help to elucidate these mechanisms as well as casting light on snake evolution. Here the isolation and characterization of ophioluxin, the first convulxin-like protein and the first snake C-type lectin to be identified from the Elapidae family, is described. Evidence for its specificity for GPVI is presented and its properties are compared with convulxin. Some applications in the investigation of GPVI-associated molecules and signaling are also shown.

Lyophilized O. hannahvenom was dissolved at 50 mg/10 ml in 300 mm NaCl, 50 mm sodium acetate, pH 4.8, and, after centrifugation, soluble components were loaded on a Fractogel EMD BioSEC 650(S) gel filtration column (16 × 1200 mm; Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) pre-equilibrated with the same buffer and eluted at 30 ml/h for 15 h collecting 5-ml fractions. Fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE silver staining and assayed for induction of platelet aggregation. Active fractions were pooled and dialyzed against 50 mm sodium acetate, pH 4.8, and further separated on a Fractogel EMD SO 32− cation-exchange chromatography column (10 mm × 150 mm, Merck) with a linear gradient of sodium chloride from 0 to 1 m in the same buffer. Fractions containing ophioluxin were pooled, dialyzed against distilled water, and either kept at 4 °C for short term use or lyophilized for storage. SDS-PAGE was performed according to Laemmli (31Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206602) Google Scholar), and the gels were stained either with 0.2% Coomassie Blue or with silver by the method of Morrissey (32Morrissey J.H. Anal. Biochem. 1981; 117: 307-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (2932) Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were determined by the BCA protein assay (Pierce) using BSA as standard. Ophioluxin was separated by SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions, and then transferred to a polyvinyliene difluoride membrane. After Coomassie Blue staining, bands corresponding to the subunits were separately cut out and their N-terminal sequences were determined on an Applied Biosystem model 477A pulsed liquid-phase protein sequencer with a model 120A on-line phenylthiohydantoin-derivative analyzer. The sequence data were analyzed using BLAST (PubMed). Fresh blood was obtained from the Swiss Red Cross Blood Transfusion Service. Washed platelets were prepared as previously described (10Polgar J.

After successive washes and centrifugations, platelets were resuspended in 20 mm Hepes, 140 mm NaCl, 4 mm KCl, 5.5 mmglucose, pH 7.4, and adjusted to 5 × 108platelets/ml. Platelet aggregation was performed using an aggregometer (Lumitec, France) with continuous stirring at 1100 rpm at 37 °C or in the case of small agglutinates using a narrow beam laser aggregometer (Biola, Moscow, Russia). For immunoprecipitation, resting as well as activated platelets (500 μl, 5 × 108platelets/ml) were lysed in RIPA buffer (phosphate-buffered saline, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% SDS, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate) containing 1 mm N-ethylmaleimide, 2 mm sodiumo-vanadate, 2 mm EDTA, and 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. After centrifugation, the supernatants were incubated with specific antibodies before adding 20 μl of Protein A-Sepharose and shaking overnight at 4 °C. The beads were collected and washed, and bound proteins were released by boiling for 3 min with 2% SDS, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4. Ophioluxin (300 μg) in 10 mmNaHCO3 was mixed with biotin-NHS (150 μg) dissolved in Me2SO. The mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 1 h, followed by dialysis against several changes of phosphate-saline buffer, pH 7.4, at 4 °C for 4 h. Washed platelets (5 × 108 platelets/ml) were lysed in 10 mm Hepes buffer containing 10% SDS, 10 mm N-ethylmaleimide, 20 mmNa3VO4, 20 mm EDTA, and 10 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. After centrifugation, the supernatants were separated on a 7–17% gradient SDS-polyacrylamide gel and transferred onto a polyvinyliene difluoride membrane. After blocking with 2% BSA for 2 h, a solution containing biotin-labeled ophioluxin was added to the membrane and agitated for 1 h. The membrane was washed four times with TBS-Tween (pH 7.4, 10 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20). Bound biotin-labeled ophioluxin was detected with phosphatase-labeled streptavidin followed by NBT/BCIP. Color development was stopped by removing the reagents and adding distilled water to the membrane. Ophioluxin-Sepharose 4B was prepared at 1 mg of ophioluxin/ml of Sepharose 4B. Washed platelets (different concentrations were used depending on application) were solubilized in Triton X-100 lysis buffer containing 2 mm N-ethylmaleimide, 4 mm EDTA, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was applied to the column and eluted successively with TBS containing 0.2% octanoyl-N-methylglucamide, 0.1 or 0.5% SDS. The eluted fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE/silver stain and Western blotting. When surface proteins were investigated, platelets were labeled with biotin-NHS as described above, namely, washed platelets were incubated with biotin-NHS at 109 platelets/100 μg of biotin-NHS for 1 h at room temperature. They were then washed twice by centrifuging at 1000 × g for 10 min and resuspending in TBS. Biotinylated platelets were solubilized in the same way as normal platelets. Biotin-labeled platelet proteins on Western blots were detected with phosphatase-labeled streptavidin followed by NBT/BCIP. Dami cells were harvested and washed with 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 4.8 mm KCl, 136 mm NaCl, 5 mm glucose, and 4 mm CaCl2, and 107 cells or 4.4 × 108 washed platelets were resuspended in 400 μl of the same buffer and incubated with 2.5 μmfura-2AM for 20 min at 37 °C. Agonists were added to 2.5 × 106 cells or 1 × 108 platelets, and fura-2·Ca2+ complex fluorescence was measured. Fixed platelets were prepared as described before (33Kirby E.P. Mills D.C.B. J. Clin. Invest. 1975; 56: 491-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Washed platelets were incubated with an equal volume of 1% formaldehyde in TBS at room temperature for 0.5 h. Then platelets were washed twice by centrifuging and then resuspended in the same buffer. Fixed platelets were diluted to 5 × 107 platelets/ml with TBS. Different inhibitors or antibodies were added to 100 μl of platelets, then shaken gently for 10 min at room temperature. Then FITC-ophioluxin or FITC-convulxin were added and, while protected against light, shaken for another 10 min at room temperature. The platelets were washed once with TBS, and samples were analyzed by flow cytometry. Washed or fixed platelets were stirred with agonists as for aggregometry. Aliquots were placed on glass slides, which had been precoated with BSA in the case of washed platelets. For adhesion assays, gel-filtered platelets were added to BSA-, alboaggregin B-, convulxin- or ophioluxin-precoated coverslips at a density of 5 × 107 platelets/ml. After incubation, nonadherent platelets were washed away, and FITC-labeled anti-P-selectin antibodies were added. After washing, the platelets were observed under ultraviolet or visible light. Fields were observed under ×1000 magnification on a Nikon Eclipse E600 microscope and images were captured using a Hamamatsu 3 CCD color video camera. Ophioluxin was purified by two-stage chromatography as described under “Experimental Procedures” (Fig. 1, A andB). It showed one band at a molecular mass of around 85 kDa under nonreducing conditions and two bands at 16 and 17 kDa under reducing conditions when separated by SDS-PAGE and detected with silver staining. Ophioluxin is about the same size as convulxin under nonreducing conditions, but the subunits are slightly larger (Fig.1 C). The N-terminal sequences of the subunits are GLCCPMRWSSSEG for the larger, and DFKCPSEWYAYDQHCYRIIN for the smaller. Based on size these would normally be assigned to α and β, respectively. However, in this case there are two arguments against this interpretation. One is the unusual size of the larger subunit and the other is the sequence similarity with other members of this family, in particular those that form multimers of heterodimers. Based on these considerations it is most likely that these are the β and α subunits, respectively, and that the unusually large size of the subunits and, particularly the β subunit, is because of post-translational modification, probably, glycosylation. We have given this protein the name ophioluxin because the sequences of the subunits are highly similar to convulxin and some other snake C-type lectins (Fig. 1 D). In addition, ophioluxin has similar properties to convulxin and is also likely to have a similar multiheterodimeric structure when the mass of the whole protein and the individual subunits are compared. Ophioluxin is the first snake C-type lectin (with heterodimeric structure) reported from King cobra. Ophioluxin is a powerful platelet agonist both in PRP and washed platelets. Its platelet activating ability measured in terms of the aggregation response is about 2–4 times higher than convulxin on a mass basis. Amounts of each C-type lectin, which gave the same rate of aggregation (maximum slope), were chosen to investigate the tyrosine-phosphorylation signaling patterns. They resembled each other and that induced by collagen (Fig.2 A). Many tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins were detected by the anti-phosphotyrosine monoclonal antibody 4G10, including Fcγ and LAT that were confirmed by immunoprecipitation (Fig. 2 B). Phosphorylated SLP76, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, and PLCγ2 were also detected in anti-LAT immunoprecipitates, agreeing with the results in previous publications (34Gibbins J.M. Briddon S.

Platelets were surface-labeled with biotin-NHS, lysed in detergent, and after centrifugation the supernatant was loaded on an ophioluxin-Sepharose 4B column. Biotin-labeled platelet proteins in the bound fractions were detected on Western blots with phosphatase-labeled streptavidin followed by NBT/BCIP. As shown in Fig.3 A, a broad band around 60–65 kDa was stained and this surface protein was detected by anti-GPVI polyclonal antibodies (Fig. 3 B). With longer exposures, two additional bands appeared, one larger than GPVI, the other smaller. The higher band is recognized better by the anti-GPVI N-terminal peptide antibodies than by the anti-whole GPVI antibodies, suggesting that both bands represent GPVI-related proteins with the same or similar N-terminal sequence (Fig. 3 C). Meanwhile, the identification of GPVI was confirmed by the ability of biotinylated ophioluxin as well as polyclonal anti-GPVI antibodies to recognize a major band around 60–65 kDa on blots of platelet lysates separated under nondenaturing conditions (data not shown). In addition, a weakly biotin-labeled surface protein of about 80 kDa was also stained (see Fig. 3 A). The membrane was stained using both polyclonal anti-GPV and anti-CD36 antibodies but this band was negative with both (data not shown). Anti-GPIbα and anti-I domain antibodies were also tested against the bound proteins eluted from the column, but neither GPIbα nor α2 subunit were detected. FITC-ophioluxin binds to platelets to saturation (Fig.4 A). The binding was strongly inhibited by convulxin and polyclonal anti-GPVI antibodies, but not by echicetin, monoclonal antibody anti-GPIb VM16d, or anti-I domain polyclonal antibodies (representative results are shown in Fig.4 B). Rhodocetin, which is thought to inhibit collagen-stimulated platelet aggregation by binding to α2β1, also had no effect on FITC-ophioluxin binding to platelets (data not shown). These results suggest that GPVI is the main, and probably the only platelet receptor for ophioluxin. Ophioluxin fully activates platelets and cross-talks with ADP and thromboxane A2 pathways to cause platelet aggregation (based on the inhibitory effect of aspirin and apyrase), which resembles the activating mechanism of convulxin. A strong calcium signal was measured from platelets activated by either ophioluxin or convulxin (data not shown). Prostaglandin E1and sodium nitroprusside inhibit nearly completely platelet aggregation caused by ophioluxin showing that cAMP- and cGMP-dependent kinases are important negative feedback pathways. In addition, ophioluxin and convulxin both activate Dami cells and induce Ca2+ release. It was already known that Dami cells express amounts of GPVI adequate to respond to convulxin (19Navdaev A. Dormann D. Clemetson J.M. Clemetson K.J. Blood. 2001; 97: 2333-2341Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Ophioluxin gave a strong calcium signal compared with convulxin when the same amounts were used. When convulxin was added first, ophioluxin added later induced less Ca2+ release and vice versa. This mutual desensitization demonstrates again that they both act on GPVI and down-regulate its responses (see Fig.5). Adhesion assays showed that platelets adhere to and spread in a similar way on ophioluxin- or convulxin- covered surfaces, but platelets behave differently on alboaggregin B-coated surfaces. Platelets also adhered to alboaggregin B, but formed fewer pseudopods and appeared less activated (echicetin has the same effect as alboaggregin B, data not shown) (Fig. 6 b).

By using recombinant proteins, we previously showed that the laminin α4 chain G domain bound to heparin, and this affinity was stronger than that of the α1 chain G domain (30Yamaguchi H. Yamashita H.

These peptides interacted with syndecan-1 or -2, a membrane-associated proteoglycan, and promoted cell attachment. Heparin binding may be important for the biological activity of the laminin α4 chain.In this paper, we describe the systematic screening for biologically active sequences in the laminin α4 chain G domain (mouse laminin α4 chain 852–1816) using a recombinant protein and a large set of overlapping peptides. The laminin α4 chain G domain recombinant protein promoted cell attachment and heparin binding. For the initial stage of screening for identification of active sequences, we evaluated the cell attachment activities of 104 different peptides using peptide-conjugated Sepharose beads and peptide-coated plates. We also examined the effect of these peptides on heparin binding to the recombinant protein. Four sequences were identified that were active in all of the assays and were also evaluated for additional biological activities. Two were found to interact with syndecan-4.DISCUSSIONWe have found that the laminin α4 chain G domain recombinant protein promoted cell attachment and that was inhibited by heparin and partially inhibited by EDTA. These results suggest that heparin-like binding is involved in the cell attachment activity of the laminin α4 chain G domain. We identified cell binding and heparin-binding sites in the laminin α4 chain G domain by a systematic peptide screening. Twenty cell adhesive peptides were identified using peptide-coated plate and peptide-conjugated bead assays. Fourteen peptides promoted cell attachment activity in either the plate or bead assays, and six peptides were active in both assays. Four of the active peptides were not active when coated on the plates but were active in the bead assay, whereas 10 peptides were not active in the bead assay but were active in the plate assay. These results indicate that both assays should be employed when testing for active peptides. It is likely that the differential activities are due to conformational changes and/or poor coating efficiencies on the plates. For example, A4G59, A4G69, A4G79, and A4G84 showed strong cell attachment activity in the peptide-conjugated Sepharose bead assay, but these peptides were not active in the peptide-coated plate assay. We previously showed that a 12-mer peptide containing the RGD sequence (34Pierschbacher M.D. Ruoslahti E. Nature. 1984; 309: 30-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (2838) Google Scholar) was active in the peptide-conjugated Sepharose bead assay but not active in the peptide-coated plate assay (33Nomizu M. Song S.Y. Kuratomi Y. Tanaka M. Kim W.H. Kleinman H.K. Yamada Y. FEBS Lett. 1996; 396: 37-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The similarity of A4G59, A4G69, A4G79, and A4G84 and the RGD-containing peptide suggests that the cell binding of these peptides required an active conformation or higher coating efficiency to the plate. In contrast, A4G4, A4G10 A4G24, A4G25, A4G26, A4G31, A4G46, A4G78, A4G102, and A4G107 showed cell attachment activity in the peptide-coated plate assay, but these peptides were not active in the peptide-conjugated Sepharose bead assay. We showed previously (35Tashiro K. Sephel G.C. Weeks B. Sasaki M. Martin G.R. Kleinman H.K. Yamada Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 16174-16182Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) that a 12-mer peptide containing the active IKVAV sequence from the laminin α1 chain was active in the peptide-coated plate assay but was not active in the peptide-conjugated Sepharose bead assay (11Nomizu M. Kuratomi Y. Malinda M.K. Song S.Y. Miyoshi K. Otaka A. Powel S.K. Hoffman M.P. Kleinman H.K. Yamada Y. J. Biol.

These α4 chain G domain peptides may behave similarly to the IKVAV peptide and require a specific conformation for activity.We sought to partially characterize the cellular receptors for the most active peptides. Previously, we identified several cell binding sequences on the α1 chain that recognize integrins (9Nomizu M. Kim W.H. Yamamura K. Utani A. Song S.Y. Otaka A. Roller P.P. Kleinman H.K. Yamada Y. J.

FASEB J. 2001; 15: 1389-1397Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). EDTA partially inhibited cell attachment to A4G24 but did not affect the rest of the active peptides, suggesting that it has the potential to interact with integrins. Cell attachment to all of the active α4 chain G domain peptides was inhibited by heparin. Cell surface heparin-like molecules are likely important for cell attachment to these peptides. Furthermore, the heparin binding of rec-α4G is blocked by A4G6, A4G10, A4G20, A4G82, and A4G83 in a dose-dependent manner. In solid phase binding assays, biotinylated heparin also bound to these peptides. These data suggest that heparin-like cell surface molecules are important in α4 chain G domain-mediated cell attachment. Recently, we found that AG73, a laminin α1 chain LG4 module peptide, interacts with syndecan-1 (14Hoffman M.P. Engbring J.A. Nielsen P.K. Vargas J. Steinberg Z. Karmand A.J. Nomizu M. Yamada Y.

Here we showed the rec-α4G protein and the most active peptides A4G6 and A4G20 bound to syndecan-4. Taken together, the active peptides in the laminin α4 chain G domain have a potential to be involved in syndecan-mediated cell binding.Active sequences are mainly located on the LG1 and LG4 modules (Fig.10 A). Previously, we identified the AG73 and A3G75 peptides in the laminin α1 and α3 chains LG4 module. AG73 binds to syndecan-1 and promotes various biological activities including cell adhesion, neurite outgrowth, acinar cell differentiation, and liver metastasis (9Nomizu M. Kim W.H. Yamamura K.

Cancer. 1998; 77: 632-639Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). A3G75 also promotes cell adhesion and binds to syndecan-2 (18Utani A. Nomizu M. Matsuura H. Kato K. Kobayashi T. Takeda U. Aota S. Nielsen P.K. Shinkai H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 28779-28788Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). We have focused on homologous sites of the AG73 and A3G75 sequences in the α4 chain G domain (Fig. 10). Active sequences are mapped using a crystal structure-based sequential alignment of the LG modules reported previously (36Timpl R. Tisi D. Talts J.F. Andac Z. Sasaki T. Hohenester E. Matrix Biol. 2000; 19: 309-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar) (Fig. 10). The AG73 sequence is located on the β-strand C region, and the A3G75 sequence is located on the loop region between the β-strands E and F in the LG4 module. A4G6 and A4G82–83, which showed the strongest cell attachment and heparin binding activities, are located in the homologous region of A3G75 in the α4 chain LG1 and LG4 modules. A4G6 and A4G82–83 would be extruded at the opposite edge of the 14-stranded β-sheet sandwich structure where a calcium ion binds. These results suggest that the active sites in the α3 and α4 chains are conserved at the loop region between the β-strands E and F and that the region plays a critical role in the biological functions of the laminin α4 chain G domain. In contrast, A4G78 was found to locate on the homologous site of AG73 in the α4 chain LG4 module. The cell attachment activity of A4G78 was much lower than that of AG73. The AG73 site was previously found to be chain-specific and to promote cell type-specific activity (14Hoffman M.P. Engbring J.A. Nielsen P.K. Vargas J. Steinberg Z. Karmand A.J. Nomizu M. Yamada Y. Kleinman H.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 22077-22085Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). A4G20 located on the loop region between the β-strand L to N in the α4 chain LG1 module is not found on any other previously identified active sequences. These chain-specific active sites in the G domain may promote cell type-specific biological activities.Inhibition of cell attachment on the rec-α4G protein substrate by A4G6, A4G20, A4G24, A4G31, A4G78, A4G82, A4G83, A4G90, and A4G107 suggests that these active sites are available on the intact molecule. These results also confirm the importance of conformation for cell interactions. However, not all active sites function in the intact molecule. Recently, a proteolytic fragment of laminin-5 generated by matrix metalloproteinase-2 was found to induce cell migration (37Giannelli G. Falk-Marzillier J. Schiraldi O. Stetler-Stevenson W.G. Quaranta V. Science. 1997; 277: 225-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (1037) Google Scholar). Proteolytic fragments of other laminin chains may also contain activity that is cryptic in the intact molecule but is revealed after proteolysis. Fragments of plasminogen and collagen XVIII, designated angiostatin and endostatin, were found to have important functions in regulating angiogenesis and tumor growth (38O'Reilly M.S. Holmgren L.

It is possible that the active peptide fragments of laminin play a critical role in its biological activity. Laminins, a family of extracellular matrix proteins, consist of three different subunits, α, β, and γ chains. So far, five α, three β, and three γ chains have been identified, and at least 15 isoforms (laminin 1–15) are formed by various combinations of each subunit (1Burgeson R.E. Chiquet M. Deutzmann R.

The laminin α chains are generally large (M r = 400,000) and contain a C-terminal globular domain consisting of five globular modules LG1–LG5. The laminin α4 chain lacks the N-terminal short arm and is expressed in cells of mesenchymal origin, such as endothelial cells and adipocytes (23Tokida Y. Aratani Y. Morita A. Kitagawa Y. J. Biol.

These peptides interacted with syndecan-1 or -2, a membrane-associated proteoglycan, and promoted cell attachment. Heparin binding may be important for the biological activity of the laminin α4 chain. In this paper, we describe the systematic screening for biologically active sequences in the laminin α4 chain G domain (mouse laminin α4 chain 852–1816) using a recombinant protein and a large set of overlapping peptides. The laminin α4 chain G domain recombinant protein promoted cell attachment and heparin binding. For the initial stage of screening for identification of active sequences, we evaluated the cell attachment activities of 104 different peptides using peptide-conjugated Sepharose beads and peptide-coated plates. We also examined the effect of these peptides on heparin binding to the recombinant protein. Four sequences were identified that were active in all of the assays and were also evaluated for additional biological activities. Two were found to interact with syndecan-4. DISCUSSIONWe have found that the laminin α4 chain G domain recombinant protein promoted cell attachment and that was inhibited by heparin and partially inhibited by EDTA. These results suggest that heparin-like binding is involved in the cell attachment activity of the laminin α4 chain G domain. We identified cell binding and heparin-binding sites in the laminin α4 chain G domain by a systematic peptide screening. Twenty cell adhesive peptides were identified using peptide-coated plate and peptide-conjugated bead assays. Fourteen peptides promoted cell attachment activity in either the plate or bead assays, and six peptides were active in both assays. Four of the active peptides were not active when coated on the plates but were active in the bead assay, whereas 10 peptides were not active in the bead assay but were active in the plate assay. These results indicate that both assays should be employed when testing for active peptides. It is likely that the differential activities are due to conformational changes and/or poor coating efficiencies on the plates. For example, A4G59, A4G69, A4G79, and A4G84 showed strong cell attachment activity in the peptide-conjugated Sepharose bead assay, but these peptides were not active in the peptide-coated plate assay. We previously showed that a 12-mer peptide containing the RGD sequence (34Pierschbacher M.D. Ruoslahti E. Nature. 1984; 309: 30-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (2838) Google Scholar) was active in the peptide-conjugated Sepharose bead assay but not active in the peptide-coated plate assay (33Nomizu M. Song S.Y. Kuratomi Y. Tanaka M. Kim W.H. Kleinman H.K. Yamada Y. FEBS Lett. 1996; 396: 37-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The similarity of A4G59, A4G69, A4G79, and A4G84 and the RGD-containing peptide suggests that the cell binding of these peptides required an active conformation or higher coating efficiency to the plate. In contrast, A4G4, A4G10 A4G24, A4G25, A4G26, A4G31, A4G46, A4G78, A4G102, and A4G107 showed cell attachment activity in the peptide-coated plate assay, but these peptides were not active in the peptide-conjugated Sepharose bead assay.

These α4 chain G domain peptides may behave similarly to the IKVAV peptide and require a specific conformation for activity.We sought to partially characterize the cellular receptors for the most active peptides. Previously, we identified several cell binding sequences on the α1 chain that recognize integrins (9Nomizu M. Kim W.H. Yamamura K. Utani A. Song S.Y. Otaka A. Roller P.P. Kleinman H.K. Yamada Y. J.

EDTA partially inhibited cell attachment to A4G24 but did not affect the rest of the active peptides, suggesting that it has the potential to interact with integrins. Cell attachment to all of the active α4 chain G domain peptides was inhibited by heparin. Cell surface heparin-like molecules are likely important for cell attachment to these peptides. Furthermore, the heparin binding of rec-α4G is blocked by A4G6, A4G10, A4G20, A4G82, and A4G83 in a dose-dependent manner. In solid phase binding assays, biotinylated heparin also bound to these peptides. These data suggest that heparin-like cell surface molecules are important in α4 chain G domain-mediated cell attachment. Recently, we found that AG73, a laminin α1 chain LG4 module peptide, interacts with syndecan-1 (14Hoffman M.P. Engbring J.A. Nielsen P.K. Vargas J. Steinberg Z. Karmand A.J. Nomizu M. Yamada Y.

Here we showed the rec-α4G protein and the most active peptides A4G6 and A4G20 bound to syndecan-4. Taken together, the active peptides in the laminin α4 chain G domain have a potential to be involved in syndecan-mediated cell binding.Active sequences are mainly located on the LG1 and LG4 modules (Fig.10 A). Previously, we identified the AG73 and A3G75 peptides in the laminin α1 and α3 chains LG4 module. AG73 binds to syndecan-1 and promotes various biological activities including cell adhesion, neurite outgrowth, acinar cell differentiation, and liver metastasis (9Nomizu M. Kim W.H. Yamamura K.

We have focused on homologous sites of the AG73 and A3G75 sequences in the α4 chain G domain (Fig. 10). Active sequences are mapped using a crystal structure-based sequential alignment of the LG modules reported previously (36Timpl R. Tisi D. Talts J.F. Andac Z. Sasaki T. Hohenester E. Matrix Biol. 2000; 19: 309-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar) (Fig. 10). The AG73 sequence is located on the β-strand C region, and the A3G75 sequence is located on the loop region between the β-strands E and F in the LG4 module. A4G6 and A4G82–83, which showed the strongest cell attachment and heparin binding activities, are located in the homologous region of A3G75 in the α4 chain LG1 and LG4 modules. A4G6 and A4G82–83 would be extruded at the opposite edge of the 14-stranded β-sheet sandwich structure where a calcium ion binds. These results suggest that the active sites in the α3 and α4 chains are conserved at the loop region between the β-strands E and F and that the region plays a critical role in the biological functions of the laminin α4 chain G domain. In contrast, A4G78 was found to locate on the homologous site of AG73 in the α4 chain LG4 module. The cell attachment activity of A4G78 was much lower than that of AG73. The AG73 site was previously found to be chain-specific and to promote cell type-specific activity (14Hoffman M.P. Engbring J.A. Nielsen P.K. Vargas J. Steinberg Z. Karmand A.J. Nomizu M. Yamada Y. Kleinman H.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 22077-22085Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). A4G20 located on the loop region between the β-strand L to N in the α4 chain LG1 module is not found on any other previously identified active sequences. These chain-specific active sites in the G domain may promote cell type-specific biological activities.Inhibition of cell attachment on the rec-α4G protein substrate by A4G6, A4G20, A4G24, A4G31, A4G78, A4G82, A4G83, A4G90, and A4G107 suggests that these active sites are available on the intact molecule. These results also confirm the importance of conformation for cell interactions. However, not all active sites function in the intact molecule. Recently, a proteolytic fragment of laminin-5 generated by matrix metalloproteinase-2 was found to induce cell migration (37Giannelli G. Falk-Marzillier J. Schiraldi O. Stetler-Stevenson W.G. Quaranta V. Science. 1997; 277: 225-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (1037) Google Scholar). Proteolytic fragments of other laminin chains may also contain activity that is cryptic in the intact molecule but is revealed after proteolysis. Fragments of plasminogen and collagen XVIII, designated angiostatin and endostatin, were found to have important functions in regulating angiogenesis and tumor growth (38O'Reilly M.S. Holmgren L.

It is possible that the active peptide fragments of laminin play a critical role in its biological activity. We have found that the laminin α4 chain G domain recombinant protein promoted cell attachment and that was inhibited by heparin and partially inhibited by EDTA. These results suggest that heparin-like binding is involved in the cell attachment activity of the laminin α4 chain G domain. We identified cell binding and heparin-binding sites in the laminin α4 chain G domain by a systematic peptide screening. Twenty cell adhesive peptides were identified using peptide-coated plate and peptide-conjugated bead assays. Fourteen peptides promoted cell attachment activity in either the plate or bead assays, and six peptides were active in both assays. Four of the active peptides were not active when coated on the plates but were active in the bead assay, whereas 10 peptides were not active in the bead assay but were active in the plate assay. These results indicate that both assays should be employed when testing for active peptides. It is likely that the differential activities are due to conformational changes and/or poor coating efficiencies on the plates. For example, A4G59, A4G69, A4G79, and A4G84 showed strong cell attachment activity in the peptide-conjugated Sepharose bead assay, but these peptides were not active in the peptide-coated plate assay. We previously showed that a 12-mer peptide containing the RGD sequence (34Pierschbacher M.D. Ruoslahti E. Nature. 1984; 309: 30-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (2838) Google Scholar) was active in the peptide-conjugated Sepharose bead assay but not active in the peptide-coated plate assay (33Nomizu M. Song S.Y. Kuratomi Y. Tanaka M. Kim W.H. Kleinman H.K. Yamada Y. FEBS Lett. 1996; 396: 37-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The similarity of A4G59, A4G69, A4G79, and A4G84 and the RGD-containing peptide suggests that the cell binding of these peptides required an active conformation or higher coating efficiency to the plate. In contrast, A4G4, A4G10 A4G24, A4G25, A4G26, A4G31, A4G46, A4G78, A4G102, and A4G107 showed cell attachment activity in the peptide-coated plate assay, but these peptides were not active in the peptide-conjugated Sepharose bead assay. We showed previously (35Tashiro K. Sephel G.C. Weeks B. Sasaki M. Martin G.R. Kleinman H.K. Yamada Y. J. Biol.

Peptides that interrupt protein-protein interactions thus have considerable potential as tools to elucidate the basic mechanisms underlying these processes and as pharmaceutical agents. As an example, the carboxyl terminal 9 amino acids of the small subunit of herpes simplex virus (HSV)1 ribonucleotide reductase (RR2) can disrupt the RR1:RR2 complex and inhibit enzymatic activity (1Dutia B.

A peptidomimetic derived from the nonapeptide was subsequently shown to have antiviral activity and inhibit replicationin vivo (3Brandt C.R. Imesch P. Spencer B. Garneau M. Deziel R. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1996; 40: 1078-1084Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A series of synthetic peptides have also been used to identify potential heparin sulfate binding sites in the HSV gC protein (4Trybala E. Bergstrom T. Svennerholm B. J. Gen. Virol. 1994; 75: 743-752Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), and a similar strategy was used to map the interaction site between the HSV UL42 protein and DNA polymerase (5Digard P. Williams K.P. Hensley P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1456-1460Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). These findings support the potential use of peptides for numerous purposes; however, since the majority of peptides do not enter cells, their potential as antiviral agents is severely limited. Recently, several exceptional peptides have been identified that can cross plasma membranes and deliver various covalently linked moieties into cells (6Derossi D. Chassaing G. Prochiantz A. Trends Cell Biol. 1998; 8: 84-87Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (665) Google Scholar, 7Hawiger J. Curr. Opin. Chem.

Initially, we were interested in determining whether the membrane-transiting proteins (MTPs) could transport a known protein-protein disrupting peptide into cells, resulting in inhibition of viral replication. We chose to use the carboxyl terminal nonapeptide from the HSV RR2 (1Dutia B. Frame M.C. Subak-Sharpe J.H. Clark W.N. Marsden H.S. Nature. 1986; 321: 439-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 2Cohen E.A. Gandreau P. Brazeau P. Langelier Y. Nature. 1986; 321: 441-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar) coupled to one or more MTPs to test the strategy. While testing these MTPs for their ability to co-transport potential antiviral peptides into cells we previously found that a modified version of one, denoted EB, inhibited HSV in the range of 1–10 μm and specifically inhibited viral entry into cells (11Bultmann H. Busse J.S. Brandt C.R. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 2634-2645Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). In this paper, we report the surprising finding that all MTPs tested to date display antiviral activity, acting to block the entry step in infection. At low peptide concentrations, inhibition of entry was clearly the dominant effect. The different MTPs, however, did not act uniformly but differed in their ability to inactivate virions and in the temperature dependence of inactivation. Antiviral activity was also not directly correlated with transport activity for some of the peptides. Our results identify inhibition of viral entry as another common property of these MTPs in addition to their ability to cross membranes and transport materials into cells. Unless otherwise noted, all studies were carried out in Vero cells cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 5% calf serum and 5% fetal bovine serum and grown to confluence in 96-well plates (2 × 105 cells per well) over a period of 4 days (11Bultmann H.

Synthesis was carried out at a 25-μmol scale using an automated synthesizer (Applied Biosystems model 432A “Synergy”) following the principles initially described by Merrifield (14Merrifield R.B. J.

The relative mass of all peptides was confirmed by electrospray ionization mass spectroscopy. The purity of the peptides was determined by analytical HPLC. Some peptides were further purified by preparative HPLC. The purity of peptides used in these studies is listed in TableI. Peptide concentrations were determined by absorbance readings (11Bultmann H.

For comprehensive treatments, cells and virus were exposed to peptide for 1 h prior to infection and were kept in media containing peptide until the number of infected cells was scored 8 h later. Cells were infected at a m.o.i. of 0.06, and infection was measured by staining cultures with X-gal (11Bultmann H. Busse J.S. Brandt C.R. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 2634-2645Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). For antiviral assays with preadsorbed virus, precooled cells were infected at an m.o.i. of 0.025 for 1 h at 4 °C to allow the virus to adsorb to the cells. Unadsorbed virus was rinsed off with ice-cold serum-free DMEM, and cultures were exposed to peptides in 40 μl of serum-free medium for 1 h at 4 °C and then for 1 h at 37 °C. Peptides were rinsed off, and cultures were returned to peptide-free serum-supplemented medium and stained with X-gal 8 h later. To assess the ability of the peptides to inactivate virions, 4.4 × 106 pfu/ml of virus was mixed on ice with peptides in serum-free DMEM, incubated for 1 h at 4 °C or 37 °C, diluted 200- or 1000-fold into peptide-free serum-supplemented DMEM at 23 °C, and assayed for remaining infectious virus by titering in Vero cell cultures. Virus was preadsorbed for 1 h at 4 °C to precooled cells (m.o.i. = 0.01), and cultures were switched to ice-cold serum-free DMEM and kept for an additional hour at 4 °C before they were shifted to 37 °C to initiate entry. As before (11Bultmann H. Busse J.S. Brandt C.R. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 2634-2645Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), at various times following the temperature shift, strips of wells were treated for 1 min with low pH citrate buffer (11Bultmann H. Busse J.S. Brandt C.R. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 2634-2645Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 17Highlander S. Sutherland S.L. Gage P.J. Johnson D.C. Levine M. Glorioso J.C. J. Virol. 1987; 61: 3356-3364Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) to inactivate any remaining extracellular virus. After each citrate treatment, cultures were returned to serum-supplemented DMEM, incubated at 37 °C, and stained with X-gal 8 h later. To determine whether the peptides were inhibitory after infection, they were added immediately following the citrate treatments, and cultures were stained for X-gal 8 h later. Virus was preadsorbed for 1 h at 4 °C to precooled cells at an m.o.i. of 0.025. After rinsing off the unadsorbed virus and adding peptide, the cultures were shifted to 33 °C for 1 h. Peptides were rinsed off, and the cultures were treated for 1 min with low pH citrate buffer or with PBS. The cultures were returned to peptide-free medium, incubated at 37 °C, and stained with X-gal or trypan blue 8 h later. Virus inactivation was measured in the PBS-treated cultures. To determine whether antiviral activity was a common property of the MTPs, we chose four of the best characterized peptides containing differing membrane-transiting motifs. The sequences of the peptides are shown in Table I. The EB peptide, included for comparison, consists of the FGF4 signal peptide (h-region (18Lin Y.-Z. Song Y.Y. Veach R.A. Torgerson T.R. Hawiger J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14255-14258Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (854) Google Scholar)) attached to an RRKK tag to enhance solubility. The KLA peptide is a wholly synthetic amphipathic helical 18-mer that has been shown to enter cells (19Oehlke J. Krause E. Weisner B. Beyermann M. Bienert M. Protein Pept. Lett. 1996; 3: 393-398Google Scholar). The HOM peptides are derived from the homeodomain of the Drosophila antennapedia protein (residues 43–58) in which the glutamic acid at position 50 was replaced by proline to target the peptide to the cytoplasm (20Derossi D. Calvet S. Trembleau A. Brunissen A. Chassaing G. Prochiantz A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18188-18193Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (966) Google Scholar). Finally, the TAT peptides include the membrane-transiting sequence of the human immunodeficiency virus tat protein (residues 47–58 (21Vives E. Granier C. Prevot P. Lebleu B. Lett. Pept. Sci. 1997; 4: 429-436Crossref Google Scholar)), which also functions as a nuclear localization sequence (22Truant R. Cullen B.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1210-1217Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The antiviral activities of the peptides were examined in three standard assays with the mutant HSV-1 KOS hrR3, which expresses β-galactosidase from an early promoter (12Goldstein D.J. Weller S.K. Virology. 1988; 166: 42-51Crossref Scopus (192) Google Scholar). In the first assay, which we refer to as comprehensive, virus and cells were exposed to peptide for 1 h prior to infection, and peptide was present during adsorption and continuously thereafter for a total of 10 h. In the second assay, virus was allowed to attach to cells at 4 °C before peptide was added for 1 h at 4 °C and 1 h at 37 °C. The cells were then switched to peptide-free medium for an additional 8 h. Finally, to test for direct inactivation of virions, virus was incubated with peptide for 1 h in solution and then titered for remaining infectivity. As shown in Fig. 1 and TableII, all peptides containing intact membrane-transiting motifs inhibited infection of Vero cell cultures in comprehensive assays at low micromolar concentrations (IC50= 2–12 μm). The peptides also inhibited preadsorbed virus, although eight times more peptide was required (IC50= 7–26 μm) when adjusted for the different inputs of virus. The ability of the peptides to inhibit preadsorbed virus indicated that they acted subsequent to viral attachment to cells. Furthermore, inhibition of the preadsorbed virus was irreversible or at least not fully reversible during the first 8 h following removal of the peptide.Table IIAntiviral and cytotoxic properties of synthetic peptidesNo.PeptideComprehensive virus inhibitionInhibition of preadsorbed virusDirect inactivation of virionsCytotoxicityat 37 °Cat 4 °C10 h2 h1EB415–264489∼150682bEB111535110100–3001103EBX23>200∼600>600>400>2004bKLA411154530∼1005bKLAd11,124126130030686bHOM-96–99–15110>60050–75∼2507bHOM1115∼1000>600>100>3008bHOMd2–37160∼50041669aHOMd59300>600∼75∼25010bHOMFF3440>600>600>100>20011bTAT-98–1223∼600>6002009212bTAT-9X1635>600>600>40011013b2aTAT-962>200NDND>100NDAll data represent micromolar peptide concentrations required to inhibit hrR3 or trypan blue exclusion (cytotoxicity assay) by 50% (IC50).

Underlined peptides have altered membrane transiting sequences. To rule out cytotoxic effects, we measured cell viability in the presence of various concentrations of peptide using trypan blue staining. The results are summarized in Table II. In comprehensive assays and in assays with preadsorbed virus, the inhibition of infection was independent of any cytotoxic effects of the peptides. The EB and bTAT-9 peptides were more cytotoxic in serum-free than in serum-supplemented medium, despite the fact that treatments with peptides in serum-free medium lasted for only 2 rather than 10 h. This is most likely due to direct interactions of these peptides with serum proteins. 2H. Bultmann and C. R. Brandt, unpublished data. All but two of the peptides (bHOMFF and bTAT-9X) directly inactivated virions in solution in a way, or in ways, that were not immediately reversible by peptide dilution (Table II, “Direct inactivation of virions” column) or, in the case of EB, by dialysis (11Bultmann H. Busse J.S. Brandt C.R. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 2634-2645Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). We previously showed for EB that although the inactivation of virions was not reversible, peptide exposure did not disrupt the structure of virions (11Bultmann H. Busse J.S. Brandt C.R. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 2634-2645Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Inactivation of virions was, however, not solely responsible for the antiviral effect (Table II and Fig. 1), since peptides differing 10-fold in their ability to inactivate virions inhibited infection at similar concentrations, regardless of whether the peptides were related to each other (e.g. peptides 6 and 7, Table II). Inactivation of virions was temperature-dependent but did not correlate with the effects of temperature on membrane transiting activities. Thus, shifting the temperature from 37 to 4 °C reduced inactivation of virions by EB only 2-fold (Fig. 1 B), whereas peptide uptake mediated by the FGF4 signal sequence was abolished at this temperature (18Lin Y.-Z. Song Y.Y. Veach R.A. Torgerson T.R. Hawiger J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14255-14258Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (854) Google Scholar). Conversely, inactivation of virions by bHOM-9 was abolished at 4 °C (Fig. 1 C), whereas cellular uptake of the HOM-MTP was only slightly reduced (18Lin Y.-Z. Song Y.Y. Veach R.A. Torgerson T.R. Hawiger J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14255-14258Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (854) Google Scholar). These results indicate that viral inactivation, inhibition of infection, and membrane translocation are not always correlated. Comparisons of the effects of sequence modifications demonstrated that for each of the four types of peptides, the presence of the membrane-transiting motifs was critical for antiviral activity. Confirming previous results using slightly different conditions (11Bultmann H. Busse J.S. Brandt C.R. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 2634-2645Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), we found that the scrambled EBX peptide was less effective than the EB peptide (Table II, numbers 1 and 3). We also found that biotinylation of EB did not greatly alter antiviral properties (Table II, peptide 2). For the bKLA peptide, replacing the l-amino acids at positions Leu11 and Lys12 with the corresponding d-amino acids (bKLAd11,12) reduced uptake into cells (19Oehlke J. Krause E. Weisner B. Beyermann M. Bienert M. Protein Pept. Lett. 1996; 3: 393-398Google Scholar) and the inactivation of virions without affecting other antiviral activities (Table II). The bHOM-9 peptide consists of the HOM-MTP coupled via a proline-glycine linker to the RR2-nonapeptide, a specific inhibitor of ribonucleotide reductase oligomerization (1Dutia B. Frame M.C. Subak-Sharpe J.H. Clark W.N. Marsden H.S. Nature. 1986; 321: 439-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 2Cohen E.A. Gandreau P. Brazeau P. Langelier Y. Nature. 1986; 321: 441-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Inactivation of virions by bHOM-9 was reduced 10-fold in the bHOM peptide lacking the RR sequence (Table 2, “Direct inactivation of virions” column, numbers 6 and 7), indicating that the RR sequence was not irrelevant “cargo” but that it could alter the activity of the HOM-MTP. Inhibition of cellular infection did not depend on the RR-sequence but only on the HOM-MTP (Table II, “Comprehensive virus inhibition” and “Inhibition of preadsorbed virus” columns, numbers 6 and 7). All-D isoforms of the HOM-MTP not only retained MTP activity (20Derossi D. Calvet S. Trembleau A. Brunissen A. Chassaing G. Prochiantz A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18188-18193Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (966) Google Scholar) but also displayed antiviral activity, regardless of whether they were biotinylated (bHOMd) or acetylated (aHOMd, Table II, numbers 7–9). Thus antiviral, like membrane-transiting properties, do not depend on chirality at least for the HOM peptides. Replacing the two tryptophan residues in the HOM-MTP by phenylalanine substantially reduced membrane transiting (20Derossi D. Calvet S. Trembleau A. Brunissen A. Chassaing G. Prochiantz A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18188-18193Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (966) Google Scholar) and antiviral activities (Table II). The ability to inactivate virions was lost in the bHOMFF peptide (Table II, number 10). In the bTAT-9 peptide, the TAT-MTP was coupled to the RR2-nonapeptide via a proline-glycine linker. Again, the antiviral activity did not reside in the RR2-sequence but in the MTP. Thus, the bTAT-9X peptide, which included a scrambled version of the RR2-sequence, retained most of the antiviral activity, whereas selective acetylation of the two lysine residues in the TAT-MTP reduced antiviral activity 5–10-fold (Table II, numbers 11–13). Subsequent experiments have shown that the TAT-MTP by itself blocks HSV-I infection. 3H. Bultmann and C. R. Brandt, manuscript in preparation. We found that all peptides except EBX blocked HSV entry within a narrow concentration range (6–25 μm; Fig.2 and Ref. 11Bultmann H. Busse J.S. Brandt C.R. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 2634-2645Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). As illustrated for the bHOM-9 peptide, concentrations that could completely block entry (Fig.2 A) had no effect on the expression and activity of β-galactosidase once the virus had entered the cells (Fig.2 B). As shown for two of the HOM peptides, bHOMFF and bHOMd (Fig. 2 C), the efficacy of entry blocking activity depended on the presence of intact MTP motifs. Lower concentrations of the bHOMFF peptide were not inhibitory if the incubations were prolonged (Fig. 2 C, ▵), suggesting that bHOMFF merely alters the kinetics of entry. The question remained as to whether blocking virus entry was merely due to inactivation of adsorbed virus prior to entry or whether some entry process per se, such as membrane fusion, was inhibited by one or more peptides. The fact that virus inactivation by the bHOM-9-MTP was highly temperature-dependent offered a unique opportunity to test whether, at least in this case, inactivation of adsorbed virions preceded entry. At 200 μm, bHOM-9 could inactivate hrR3 in solution with a temperature coefficient (50% inactivation) of 21 °C (Fig.3 A, ▪), well below the temperature required for normal viral entry, which occurred at 34 °C (Fig. 3 B, ●). The bHOM-9 peptide also inactivated preadsorbed virus well below temperatures permitting entry. For example, at 25 °C when less than 5% of the virions were internalized (Fig. 3 B, ●), 12 and 100 μmbHOM-9 inhibited preadsorbed virus by 25 and 50%, respectively (Fig.3 B, ▴ versus ▵). The inhibitory effects of bHOM-9 were not due to the release of infectious virus into the culture medium. For instance, after exposure to 100 μm bHOM-9 at 30 °C, the recovered culture medium contained <3% of the virus infecting the control cells (Fig.1 B, ○), even though at this temperature, the peptide had inhibited, and could have released, 70% of the preadsorbed virus (Fig.3 B, ▵). No additional infectious virus could be recovered from media adjusted to 0.5 m NaCl, even though control experiments showed that adsorbed hrR3 released by heparin could be successfully recovered as infectious virus after treatment with 0.5m NaCl (data not shown). The results are consistent with the notion that the bHOM-9 peptide can irreversibly inactivate preadsorbed virus prior to entry without releasing the virions from the cell surface. This, however, appears to be only a secondary effect of bHOM-9 seen at higher concentrations. The primary target of low concentrations of bHOM-9 seemed to be the actual entry process itself. This was shown in experiments, in which inhibition of virus entry and virus inactivation were measured simultaneously after preadsorbed virus was exposed to peptide for 1 h at 33 °C, and cultures were switched to peptide-free medium for another 8 h at 37 °C. The fraction of virus entering cells (30–70% of untreated controls) was determined in cultures treated with low pH citrate buffer following the incubation at 33 °C. The fraction of inactivated virus was estimated in mock-treated cultures. As shown in Fig. 4 A, bHOM-9 preferentially blocked virus entry (●) and inactivated virus only at 10-fold higher concentrations (○). The bHOM peptide was even more selective in that it blocked entry almost completely before any virus was inactivated (Fig. 4 B). The IC50 values measured for the HOM peptides and representatives of the three other groups of peptides are given in TableIII, where peptides are listed in order of their preferential inhibition of entry. The bTAT-9 peptide was at least as selective as the bHOM peptide, whereas EB and bKLA had little or no selective effects on entry.Table IIIRelationship between virus entry and virus inactivationPeptideInhibition of entryVirus inactivationbTAT-90.875bHOM2.6200bHOM-91.621EB1.14.3bKLA7.810All peptides were tested for their ability to block entry and to inactivate virus at 33 °C (cf.

Open table in a new tab All peptides were tested for their ability to block entry and to inactivate virus at 33 °C (cf. Fig. 4). Only the bKLA peptide had cytotoxic effects in these assays (IC50 = 130 μm). All data are IC50 values in μm. Underlined peptides are entry blockers in the absence of virus inactivation. Inhibition of entry by some entry blockers was readily reversible once the peptides were removed. This was shown by following the resumption of virus entry in peptide-free medium at 37 °C, subsequent to partial or complete inhibition of entry during 1-h treatments of preadsorbed virus at 33 °C by bHOM-9 (Fig. 4 C) or bHOM (Fig. 4 D). The fraction of virus rendered citrate-resistant was measured at various times following the removal of peptide. In controls not treated with peptide (Fig. 4 C, ●), 70% of the preadsorbed virus was internalized during the incubation at 33 °C. The rest entered cells during the first hour at 37 °C. One-hour treatments with 10 μm bHOM-9 inhibited entry by >90% (Fig. 4 C, ▴ at zero time) and inactivated about one-third of the virus (Fig. 4, ▵). Like the control virus, all infectious virus entered cells within the first hour after removal of the peptide. Entry was also fully restored within 1 h following partial or complete inhibition of entry by 10 and 100 μmbHOM (Fig. 4 D, ▴ and ▪, respectively). Only after inhibition with 100 μm bHOM-9 was entry restored more slowly (Fig. 4 C, ▪). At least for some of the peptides, inhibition of entry and virus inactivation of virions appeared to be separate peptide functions that may be independently manipulated. Addition of the hydrophobic RR2-sequence to the bHOM peptide had little effect on virus entry but enhanced the ability of the peptide to inactivate virions nearly 10-fold (Table III). The presence of the RR-sequence by itself, however, was not sufficient for this activity as indicated by the fact that replacement of the HOM-MTP in bHOM-9 by the TAT-MTP resulted in a peptide (bTAT-9) with nearly 4-fold less inactivation ability but no loss of entry blocking activity (Table III). The ability of the EB peptide to inactivate virions also depended on the hydrophobic FGF leader sequence (EB and EBX, Table II). In conclusion, we have shown that a set of four structurally distinct MTPs are not only functionally related by virtue of their ability to cross plasma membranes and enter cells but also by sharing antiviral activity, specifically inhibiting viral entry. The ability of MTPs to inhibit entry appears to involve two separate mechanisms: (i) interference with entering virus or some component of the fusion machinery and (ii) irreversible inactivation of adsorbed virions prior to entry. Some of the peptides can selectively block entry without irreversibly inactivating virions. For other peptides, any effects on virus entry are not readily distinguishable from virus inactivation. High concentrations of nearly all peptides lead to irreversible inactivation of virions. These MTPs may ultimately be useful as prophylactic agents to block virus infection and as tools to further our understanding of the processes involved in viral entry into cells.

Each of these ATP-grasp domains contains an active site responsible for binding one molecule of MgATP.

Here we describe the high resolution x-ray crystallographic structure of the G359F (small subunit) mutant protein of carbamoyl phosphate synthetase. This residue was initially targeted for study because it resides within the interior wall of the molecular tunnel leading from the active site of the small subunit to the first active site of the large subunit. It was anticipated that a mutation to the larger residue would “clog” the ammonia tunnel and impede the delivery of ammonia from its site of production to the site of utilization. In fact, the G359F substitution resulted in a complete change in the conformation of the loop delineated by Glu-355 to Ala-364, thereby providing an “escape” route for the ammonia intermediate directly to the bulk solvent.

Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1987; 56: 89-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (805) Google Scholar, was originally put forth to explain the manner in which reactive intermediates are transferred from one protein to another in a metabolic pathway or shuttled from one active site to another within a single enzyme. Many have regarded this phenomenon as an essential mechanism for the regulation of metabolic pathways within the living cell. Obvious advantages of substrate channeling include the protection of unstable intermediates or products, the sequestering of toxic molecules, the control of metabolic flux, the improvement of catalytic efficiency, and the decreased diffusion of substrates or intermediates away from their respective active sites. Recent reviews on the topic of substrate channeling can be found in Refs. 2Anderson K.S. Methods Enzymol. 1999; 308: 111-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 3Spivey H.O. Ovadi J.

While substrate channeling is now a widely accepted concept, there is still a paucity of mechanistic and structural data pertaining to this complex biological phenomenon, although this situation is changing rapidly. The first direct structural observation for substrate channeling was derived from the elegant x-ray crystallographic analysis of tryptophan synthase isolated from Salmonella typhimurium(5Hyde C.C. Ahmed S.A. Padlan E.A. Miles E.W. Davies D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 17857-17871Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This investigation demonstrated that the two active sites located on the α- and β-subunits of the enzyme were separated by a distance of ∼25 Å and connected by a tunnel of the appropriate diameter to facilitate the diffusion of indole. As more complicated protein structures are solved to increasingly higher resolution, it is becoming apparent that substrate channels and tunnels may, indeed, be quite common. Since the initial x-ray analysis of tryptophan synthase other examples of enzymes employing substrate channeling have appeared in the literature including carbamoyl-phosphate synthetase (6Thoden J.B.

Recent reviews of the enzyme can be found in Refs. 11Raushel F.M. Thoden J.B. Reinhart G.D. Holden H.M. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 1998; 5: 624-632Crossref Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 12Holden H.M.

As shown in Scheme FS1, CPS synthesizes carbamoyl phosphate from two molecules of MgATP, one molecule of bicarbonate, and one molecule of glutamine using a catalytic mechanism that proceeds through three reactive intermediates: carboxy phosphate, ammonia, and carbamate. As isolated from E. coli, CPS is an α,β-heterodimeric protein with the individual large and small subunits containing 1073 and 382 amino acid residues, respectively (14Piette J. Nyunoya H. Lusty C.J.

Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 4629-4633Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). The smaller subunit catalyzes the hydrolysis of glutamine to glutamate and ammonia and belongs to the Class I amidotransferase superfamily (16Rubino S.D. Nyunoya H. Lusty C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 11320-11327Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), whereas the larger subunit harbors the binding sites for both molecules of MgATP, allosteric ligands such as UMP and ornithine, and various metal ions. This larger subunit, indeed, contains all of the necessary hardware to produce carbamoyl phosphate with only ammonia as the nitrogen source (17Trotta P.P. Burt M.E. Haschemeyer R.H. Meister A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1971; 68: 2599-2603Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). The recent x-ray crystallographic studies of CPS from E. coli have shed considerable light on this remarkable molecular machine. As shown in Fig. 1, and quite unexpectedly, the three active sites of the enzyme are widely spaced throughout the α,β-heterodimer (6Thoden J.B. Holden H.M. Wesenberg G. Raushel F.M. Rayment I.

Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 16158-16166Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). By both visual inspection of the CPS model and the employment of computational searches with the software package GRASP (23Nicholls A. Sharp K.A. Honig B. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 1991; 11: 281-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (5314) Google Scholar), it was possible to map out a molecular tunnel connecting the three active sites as indicated in Fig.1. Accordingly, the ammonia generated by the small subunit traverses the molecular tunnel leading to the binding site for the first molecule of MgATP where it reacts with the carboxy phosphate intermediate to generate carbamate. This particular region has been referred to as the “ammonia” tunnel and is built from amino acid residues contributed by both the small subunit and the N-terminal half of the large subunit. Similarly, the carbamate shuttles between the first and second MgATP binding sites in the large subunit in a channel referred to as the carbamate tunnel to generate the final product, carbamoy phosphate. To test the validity of the molecular tunnel mapped out in the CPS structure, a series of site-directed mutant proteins were created within the ammonia tunnel and kinetically studied (24Huang X. Raushel F.M. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 3240-3247Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 25Huang X. Raushel F.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26233-26240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). One position in particular was targeted for analysis, namely Gly-359 of the small subunit, which forms an integral part of the interior wall of the putative molecular tunnel. These investigations demonstrated a direct correlation between the size of the substituted amino acid and the extent of the uncoupling of the partial reactions catalyzed by CPS, specifically glutamine and MgATP hydrolysis. The simplest explanation for these results was the formation of a blockage within the tunnel such that ammonia could no longer diffuse from the small subunit to the first active site of the large subunit. Here we describe the high resolution structure of one of these mutant proteins, namely the G359F enzyme. Rather than cause a blockage of the tunnel, the mutation resulted in the formation of an escape route for ammonia through a path leading directly to the bulk solvent. The implication of this, with respect to the evolution of substrate tunnels, is discussed. Protein samples employed for crystallization trials were purified as previously described (26Miran S.G. Chang S.H. Raushel F.M. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 7901-7907Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Large single crystals were grown at 4 °C by batch from 8% polyethylene glycol 8000, 0.65 m tetraethylammonium chloride, 0.5 mm MnCl2, 100 mm KCl, 1.5 mm ADP, 0.5 mml-ornithine, and 25 mm HEPPS (pH 7.4). Once the crystals reached dimensions of ∼0.3 mm × 0.3 mm × 0.8 mm, they were flash-frozen according to previously published procedures (6Thoden J.B. Holden H.M. Wesenberg G. Raushel F.M. Rayment I. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 6305-6316Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar) and stored under liquid nitrogen until synchrotron beam time became available. The crystals belonged to the space group P212121 with unit cell dimensions of a = 151.1 Å, b = 164.2 Å, andc = 331.5 Å and one complete (α,β)4-heterotetramer per asymmetric unit. An x-ray data set for the G359F mutant protein was collected on a 3 × 3-tiled “SBC2” charge-coupled device detector at the Structural Biology Center 19-ID Beamline (Advanced Photon Source, Argonne National Laboratory). The data were processed with HKL2000 and scaled with SCALEPACK (27Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38453) Google Scholar).

Open table in a new tab The structure of the G359F mutant protein was solved by Difference Fourier techniques to a nominal resolution of 2.1 Å. The initial model was subjected to least-squares refinement with the software package TNT (28Tronrud D.E. Ten Eyck L.F. Matthews B.W. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1987; 43: 489-501Crossref Scopus (874) Google Scholar), which reduced the overall R-factor to 26.8%. With more than 5800 amino acid residues in the asymmetric unit, the goal of the subsequent model building process was to lower theR-factor as much as possible using an “averaged” α,β-heterodimer before finally rebuilding the entire (α,β)4-heterotetramer in the asymmetric unit. Thus, to expedite the structure refinement process, the electron densities corresponding to the four α,β-heterodimers in the asymmetric unit were averaged with the program AVE in the RAVE suite of programs and the averaged model adjusted according to the map (29Jones T.A. Dodson E.J. Gover S. Wolf W. Molecular Replacement. SERC Daresbury Laboratory, Warrington, England1992: 91-105Google Scholar, 30Kleywegt G.J. Jones T.A. Bailey S. Hubbard R. Waller D. From First Map to Final Model. SERC Daresbury Laboratory, Warrington, England1994: 59-66Google Scholar). This averaging and rebuilding process lowered the overallR-factor to 21.0%. Next the averaged model was used to create the entire (α,β)4-heterotetramer, which was placed back into the unit cell. Maps were calculated with coefficients of the form (2F o − F c), whereF o was the native structure factor amplitude andF c was the calculated structure factor amplitude from the model, and the four α,β-heterodimers in the asymmetric unit were adjusted to the electron density using the program TURBO (31Roussel A. Fontecilla-Camps J.C. Cambillau C. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1990; 46: C66-C67Google Scholar). The final R-factor was 18.0% for all measured x-ray data.

Open table in a new tab Previous studies have demonstrated that the G359F mutation within the small subunit of CPS results in substantial changes in specific kinetic constants for the modified protein relative to those for the wild-type enzyme. For example, in the partial reaction for the hydrolysis of glutamine (in the absence of ATP),k cat is bigger for the mutant protein than for the wild-type enzyme by about one order of magnitude. However, theK m of glutamine for this reaction is increased by a factor > 400, relative to the wild-type enzyme. Nevertheless, in the presence of ATP/bicarbonate, the maximal rate of glutamine hydrolysis for the mutant protein is essentially the same as for the wild-type enzyme, although the K m for glutamine remains high. These results demonstrate that the catalytic machinery of the G359F mutant protein for the hydrolysis of glutamine is intact and that the enhancement in the rate of glutamine hydrolysis, allosterically induced through the formation of carboxy phosphate within the large subunit of CPS, is fully operational. What has significantly changed with this mutation is the apparent binding affinity for the association of glutamine to the active site within the small subunit. For the bicarbonate-dependent ATP hydrolysis reaction (in the absence of glutamine) there is a 6-fold increase in the value ofk cat for the mutant relative to the wild-type protein. However, there is essentially no increase in the rate of ATP hydrolysis for the G359F mutant protein in the presence of saturating levels of glutamine. The enhanced rate for the partial ATPase reaction (in the absence of glutamine) with the mutant protein is consistent with a greater instability of the carboxy phosphate intermediate apparently due to greater access by solvent water. The abolition of the rate enhancement for ATP turnover in the presence of glutamine for the mutant protein is fully consistent with the impedance of ammonia during delivery to the large subunit. This conclusion is also supported by the diminished rate of synthesis of carbamoyl phosphate while employing glutamine as the nitrogen source. With the mutant protein, the value ofk cat/K m for carbamoyl-phosphate synthesis is reduced by 13,000-fold relative to that of the wild-type protein (24Huang X. Raushel F.M. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 3240-3247Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) and the overall value ofk cat is reduced by a factor of ∼60. However, the rate of carbamoyl phosphate formation using ammonia as a nitrogen source is essentially unchanged from the value observed with the wild-type enzyme. Thus, the G359F mutation results in both a significant increase in the K m for glutamine and in the inability of the enzyme to make carbamoyl phosphate using glutamine (but not ammonia) as a nitrogen source. The mutant protein can hydrolyze glutamine and can catalyze the formation of the carboxy phosphate intermediate, but it is unable to couple the reactions catalyzed at the individual active sites toward the production of carbamoyl phosphate. The question as to whether these alterations to the kinetic constants are from major structural perturbations of the protein architecture or rather from a simple blocking of the putative ammonia channel is addressed here by a high resolution x-ray crystallographic analysis. The G359F substitution in the small subunit results in virtually no perturbations in the conformation of the large subunit of the enzyme and, particularly, within the two MgATP binding pockets. Indeed, the α-carbons alone or all atoms comprising the large subunit of the mutant protein superimpose onto the wild-type enzyme with root mean square deviations of 0.25 and 1.20 Å, respectively. The situation is more complex, however, with regard to the small subunit and to its active site region. The α-carbons alone or all atoms comprising the small subunit of the mutant protein superimpose onto the wild-type enzyme with root mean square deviations of 1.05 and 1.20 Å, respectively. Shown in Fig. 2 is a superposition of the wild-type and G359F mutant proteins near the glutaminase active site of the small subunit. In the wild-type enzyme, as in all Class I amidotransferases examined to date, Cys-269 and His-353 (or their structural equivalents) function as a catalytic couple with His-353 serving to deprotonate the side chain thiol of Cys-269. Additionally, there is a conserved glutamate in the Class I amidotransferases, namely Glu-355 in CPS, which hydrogen bonds to the imidazole group of His-353. In wild-type CPS, Oδ1of Glu-355 lies within 2.9 Å from Nδ1of His-353. Most likely Glu-355 plays a key role in correctly positioning the side chain of His-353 for effective deprotonation of Cys-269. The mutation of Glu-355 to an alanine residue, however, has no effect on the maximal rate of glutamine hydrolysis but does result in an order of magnitude increase in the K m for glutamine (32Huang X. Raushel F.M. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 15909-15914Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Upon substituting a glycine with a phenylalanine residue at position 359, the polypeptide chain in the nearby vicinity adopts a quite different conformation as can be seen in Fig. 2. The net result is that the carboxylate group of Glu-355 is no longer within hydrogen bonding distance to His-353 but rather is positioned at ∼8.0 Å away. Additionally, the side chain Oδ1 of Asn-311, which normally hydrogen bonds to Nδ1 of His-291, rotates by ∼159 ° and ∼60 ° about the Cα/Cβ and Cβ/Cγ bonds, respectively, thereby allowing it to interact with Nδ1 of His-353 (3.2 Å). This distance in wild-type CPS is ∼5.5 Å. The path of the ammonia tunnel in native CPS is outlined in Fig.3 a. Gly-359 of the small subunit is positioned within the random coil area delineated by Glu-355 to Ala-364, and it is this region that provides one side of the ammonia tunnel. The goal of the G359F mutation was to block this conduit for the passage of ammonia, and, indeed, the observed kinetics parameters for the G359F mutant protein clearly indicate the importance of this region for communication between active sites and for the ultimate synthesis of carbamoyl phosphate. Unexpectedly, however, the G359F mutation resulted in a change in conformation for this random coil region beginning at Pro-354. Electron density corresponding to this region in the G359F mutant protein is displayed in Fig.4. Note that the region of the polypeptide chain from Phe-359 (the site of the mutation) to Asp-363 is disordered in the electron density map. In wild-type CPS, Pro-354 adopts torsional angles of φ = −70 ° and ψ = −21 °. In the G359F mutant protein, these torsional angles are φ = −56 ° and ψ = 145 ° with the net effect of opening up one side of the ammonia tunnel and sending the polypeptide chain off into an extended conformation. The distance between the prolines at position 358 in the two structures is ∼13 Å. This change at Pro-354 could not have been predicted given that in the wild-type enzyme the α-carbons for Pro-354 and Gly-359 are separated by ∼9 Å. As a result of the changes in the polypeptide chain conformation between Glu-355 and Ala-364, the structural integrity of the ammonia tunnel has been compromised and an accompanying new “escape route” for the ammonia intermediate has been formed as indicated in Fig.3 b. This escape route undoubtedly contributes to the uncoupling of the separate chemical reactions in the G359F mutant form of CPS.Figure 4Electron density corresponding to the region from His-353 to Ser-357 in the mutant protein. The map was contoured at 1 ς and calculated with coefficients of the form (2F o − F c), whereF o was the native structure factor amplitude andF c was the calculated structure factor amplitude.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) One of the more intriguing questions concerning enzymes that employ substrate channeling in their reaction mechanisms is the manner in which these molecular tunnels first evolved. There are examples in the literature, such as CPS and tryptophan synthetase (5Hyde C.C. Ahmed S.A. Padlan E.A. Miles E.W. Davies D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 17857-17871Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), whereby the molecular channels are fully formed even in the absence of a full complement of substrates. In some enzymes, though, it appears as if the channels only exist transiently during each catalytic cycle such as in glutamine phosphoribosylpyrophosphate amidotransferase (8Krahn J.M. Kim J.H. Burns M.R. Parry R.J. Zalkin H. Smith J.L. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 11061-11068Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). For those enzymes containing permanent substrate channels, two possible mechanisms for tunnel evolution can be envisioned. In one scenario, smaller amino acid residues are substituted for larger side chains, thereby creating incremental cavities throughout the interior of the protein that eventually merge into a tunnel connecting active sites. The difficulty with this scenario, however, is that the creation of cavities within the interior of a protein has been demonstrated to have, in general, a destabilizing effect (33Matthews B.W. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 35-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Another mechanism of channel formation that can be envisioned involves single point mutations where smaller amino acid residues within the interior of a enzyme are substituted with larger side chains, thereby leading to substantial conformational changes in the protein architecture. Although most of these changes would be disruptive and lead to a loss of proper folding or catalytic activity, it would be expected that some could give rise to the formation of new tunnels. This second scenario seems more likely since, as demonstrated in this investigation, single point mutations can have profound effects on the polypeptide chain conformation far from the original site of the substitution. In summary, as has been so often the case in other protein site-directed mutagenesis studies, the replacement of a single amino acid in the ammonia tunnel of CPS resulted in changes in its three-dimensional architecture that could not have been anticipated. Rather than “clog” the ammonia tunnel, the G359F mutation resulted both in the formation of a new pathway for ammonia dispersion and in altered conformations of key catalytic residues within the glutaminase active site of the small subunit. The fact that the G359F mutation affects the synchronization of the active sites required for glutamine and MgATP hydrolysis lends further experimental support for the functional existence of the ammonia tunnel in CPS.

The rod domain is flanked by an N-terminal head domain, involved in the regulation of filament assembly and disassembly, and a C-terminal tail domain. The tail domain of larger molecular mass subunits, NF-M and NF-H, constitutes side arms extruding from the core filament (10Hisanaga S. Hirokawa N. J. Mol.

Chem. 1991; 266: 18861-18867Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and at Ser-57 by calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) at apical dendrites of the pyramidal neurons in a hippocampal slice culture when long term potentiation is induced (17Hashimoto R.

The long C-terminal tail domains of two larger subunits, NF-M and NF-H, are highly phosphorylated in axons. The phosphorylation occurs at the Lys-Ser-Pro (KSP) sequences, repeated ∼10 times in NF-M and 50 times in NF-H. The KSP repeats were reported to be phosphorylated by the proline-directed protein kinases, Cdk5, ERK, stress-activated protein kinase, and GSK3 (18Hisanaga S. Ishiguro K. Uchida T. Okumura E.

This phosphorylation is thought to regulate the functions of the side arms on interactions between NFs or NF and other cellular structures (12Hisanaga S. Hirokawa N. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 21852-21858Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Hisanaga S. Kusubata M. Okumura E. Kishimoto T. J. Biol.

In addition to phosphorylation of the KSP repeat, the tail region of the NF subunit proteins is characterized by a glutamate (E)-rich region called the “E-segment” in the N terminus of the tail region. The importance of the E-segment in filament organization is suggested by the removal of the E-segment from NF-L by thrombin, which results in a ribbon-like structure, not an intermediate-size filament (27Nakamura Y. Takeda M. Aimoto S. Hariguchi S. Kitajima S. Nishimura T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 212: 565-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). There have been several reports describing phosphorylation of the E-segment, although the role of the phosphorylation remained unknown. Ser-473 in the E-segment of NF-L is phosphorylated in rat spinal cord and in vitro by casein kinase (CK) II (28Xu Z.S. Liu W.S. Willard M. J. Neurosci. 1990; 10: 1838-1846Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 29Nakamura Y. Hashimoto R. Kashiwagi Y. Wada Y. Sakoda S. Miyamae Y. Kudo T. Takeda M. FEBS Lett. 1999; 455: 83-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The E-segment of the chicken NF-M is phosphorylated at five sites in vivo and by NF-associated CKI in vitro (30Hollander B.A. Bennett G.S. Brain Res. 1992; 599: 237-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 31Hollander B.A. Bennett G.S. Shaw G. J. Neurochem. 1996; 66: 412-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 32Shaw G. Miller R. Wang D.S. Tang D. Hollander B.A. Bennett G.S. J. Neurochem. 1997; 69: 1729-1737Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). If phosphorylation of the E-segment plays an important role in filament formation, the E-segment of NF-H might also be phosphorylated as it has several consensus phosphorylation sequences for CKs. However, there has been no report on phosphorylation of the E-segment of NF-H. We investigated the phosphorylation of the E-segment of NF-H and found that Ser-493 and Ser-501 in an SP motif in the NF-H E-segment were phosphorylated in vivo. We purified an E-segment kinase from rat brains and identified it as GSK3β. The preferred in vitro and HEK293 cell phosphorylation site for GSK3β was shown to be Ser-493, one of the in vivo phosphorylation sites, rather than the KSP repeats. A part of GSK3β was co-eluted with the NF fraction when spinal cord extract was subjected to gel filtration. These results indicate that Ser-493 in the E-segment of NF-H is phosphorylated by GSK3β in vivo. Olomoucine, an inhibitor of Cdk5 and ERK2, was purchased from Calbiochem (San Diego, CA) and butyrolactone I, an inhibitor of Cdk5, was provided by Dr. A. Okuyama (Banyu Pharmaceutical Research Institute in collaboration with Merck Research Laboratories, Tsukuba, Japan) (33Hisanaga S. Uchiyama M. Hosoi T. Yamada K. Honma N. Ishiguro K. Uchida T.

Anti-FLAG (M2) and anti-NF-H (SMI33) monoclonal antibodies were purchased from Sigma and Sternberger Monoclonals Inc. (Baltimore, MD), respectively. Anti-rat GSK3β antiserum was described previously (34Takahashi M. Tomizawa K. Kato R. Sato K. Uchida T. Fujita S.C. Imahori K. J. Neurochem. 1994; 63: 245-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). ERK2 was purchased from New England Biolabs. Cdk5/p35 was prepared from Sf9 cells transfected with mouse Cdk5 and p35 cDNA. 2T. Saito, R. Onuki, Y. Fujita, G. Kusakawa, K. Ishiguro, J. A. Bibb, T. Kishimoto, and S. Hisanaga, manuscript in preparation. All other reagents were of analytical grade. The two synthesized peptides, “CEAATTSPPAEE” and “CEAATTpSPPAEE” (where pS is phosphoserine), were chemically synthesized. The C-EAATTpSPPAEE peptide was conjugated to keyhole limpet hemocyanin through the cysteine residue attached to the N terminus and used for immunization in rabbits. The anti-pS493 serum was affinity purified on the columns that bound the nonphosphorylated peptide negatively and phosphorylated peptide positively. Albino Wistar/ST rats (Japan-SLC, Tokyo, Japan) were anesthetized under diethyl ether vapor and decapitated. Spinal cords were homogenized in an equal volume (v/w) of a homogenization buffer (100 mm Pipes, pH 6.8, 5 mm EGTA, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol (DTT), 0.4 mm Pefabloc SC, 10 μg/ml leupeptin) with a Polytron homogenizer. The homogenate was centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was fractionated using a Sepharose CL-4B gel filtration column (0.8 × 27 cm; Amersham Biosciences) with 20 mm Pipes, pH 6.8, 2 mm EGTA, 1 mmMgCl2, 0.01% Tween 20, 1 mm DTT, 0.02 mm Pefabloc SC (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany), 1 μg/ml leupeptin. The void volume fractions were used as a NF fraction. NF was dephosphorylated with Escherichia coli alkaline phosphatase (WAKO Chemicals, Osaka, Japan) for 2 h at 37 °C after dialysis against 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.8, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm EGTA, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.15m NaCl, 1 mm DTT, 0.02 mm Pefabloc SC, 1 μg/ml leupeptin. NF-H resolved by SDS-PAGE was excised from gels and washed with 25% isopropyl alcohol and subsequently 10% methanol. After washing with acetonitrile for 15 min at room temperature, the gels were dried and NF-H was digested by incubation with 0.1 unit of lysyl-endopeptidase (Wako Chemicals) in 500 μl of 10 mm(NH4)2CO3, pH 8.4, overnight at 30 °C. After lyophilization, peptide fragments dissolved in 50% CH3CN and 0.1% trifluroacetic acid were mixed with an equal volume of 10 mg/ml α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid in 50% CH3CN and 0.1% trifluroacetic acid as a matrix and analyzed for their mass by a Voyager Elite DE-STR (Perseptive Biosystems, Palo Alto, CA). Phosphorylated amino acids in the phosphorylated peptide were determined by the MS/MS procedure (quadrupole-time of flight, Micromass, Manchester, UK). The mass spectrometric data were assigned to amino acid sequences by using the MASCOT on-line service (www.matrixscience.com/). The tail domain (425–1072 amino acids) expression vector was constructed from rat NF-H cDNA (9Chin S.S. Liem R.K. J. Neurosci. 1990; 10: 3714-3726Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The ApoI fragment of NF-H cDNA was cloned into the EcoRI site of pET23a(+) and, to adjust the reading frame, digested withBamHI and NheI, blunt ended, and self-ligated. The E-segment (425–507 amino acids) expression vector was constructed from the tail domain expression vector by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Mutations at Ser-493 or/and Ser-501 to Ala (S493A, S501A, and S493/501A) were generated using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) according to the manufacturers instructions. The tail domain and E-segment were expressed in E. coli BL21(DE3) pLys(S) in the presence of 0.5 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside. The tail domain was purified by a HiTrap SP cation exchange column (1.6 × 2.5 cm; Amersham Biosciences) and the E-segment was purified by a HiTrap Q anion exchange column (1.6 × 2.5 cm;Amersham Biosciences) from E. coli extract. The kinase activity was measured in Buffer A (20 mm MOPS, pH 6.8, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm EGTA, 1 mmMgCl2) containing 0.1 mm ATP and 0.1 mCi/ml [γ-32P]ATP using 0.2 mg/ml tail domain or 0.1 mg/ml E-segment as substrate for 30 min at 35 °C. The reaction was stopped by addition of 4× LSB (Laemmli's sample buffer) (35Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207227) Google Scholar). After SDS-PAGE on a 7.5% polyacrylamide gel for the tail domain or 15% for the E-segment, phosphorylation was measured with a BAS 2000 bioimage analyzer (FujiFilm, Tokyo, Japan). Brains of 10-week-old rats were homogenized in 3 volumes (v/w) of Buffer A containing 1 mm DTT and protease inhibitors (0.4 mm Pefabloc SC and 10 μg/ml leupeptin) with a Teflon-glass homogenizer. The homogenate was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was applied to a DEAE (DE52)-cellulose column (3 × 5 cm; Whatman) equilibrated with Buffer A. The unbound proteins were loaded onto an SP Sepharose HP column (1.6 × 17 cm; Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with Buffer B, comprising Buffer A supplemented with 10% glycerol and 0.02% Tween 20. After washing with Buffer B, the proteins were eluted with a linear gradient of 0–0.5 m NaCl in Buffer B. Fractions containing the E-segment kinase activity were collected and loaded directly onto a HiTrap heparin column (1.6 × 2.5 cm; Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with Buffer B. The E-segment kinase activity was eluted as a single peak at around 0.75m NaCl with a linear gradient of 0–1.0 m NaCl in the Buffer B. The fractions containing the E-segment kinase activity were collected and applied to a Superose 6 HR 10/30 gel filtration column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with Buffer B. The E-segment kinase activity was detected as a peak at around 40–50 kDa. An anti-GSK3β serum was added to the kinase fraction and incubated for 1 h at 4 °C. After addition of Protein A-Sepharose CL-4B (Amersham Biosciences), the mixture was further incubated for 1 h at 4 °C. After washing with Buffer A four times, the kinase activity bound to Sepharose beads was assayed as described above. The tail domain or E-segment phosphorylated by GSK3β was digested by lysyl-endopeptidase. The digested peptides were subjected to two-dimensional phosphopeptide map analysis using a thin layer cellulose plate (Merck) according to the methods of Boyle et al. (36Boyle W.J. Geer P.V.D. Hunter T. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 201: 110-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (1276) Google Scholar). Electrophoresis was performed at pH 1.9 and ascending chromatography was performed in isobutyric acid buffer. The 32P-labeled peptide was scraped from thin layer cellulose plates and extracted with 5% formic acid and 15% acetic acid. The extracted peptide was lyophilized and then hydrolyzed by heating at 110 °C for 1 h in 6 n HCl. The phosphoamino acid analysis was performed by the methods of Boyleet al. (36Boyle W.J. Geer P.V.D. Hunter T. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 201: 110-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (1276) Google Scholar). The enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) tagged NF-H expression vector was constructed from NF-H cDNA by cloning its EcoRI fragment into theEcoRI site of pEGFP-C1 (CLONTECH). The cloned plasmid was digested with BglII andNotI, and self-ligated to adjust the reading frame after blunt ending. The FLAG-tagged tail domain expression vector was constructed by cloning the BamHI-SalI fragment of the tail domain E. coli expression vector intoHindIII-SalI sites of pCMV2-FLAG. The FLAG-tagged E-segment expression vector was constructed by cloning theEcoRI-SalI E-segment fragment of the E-segmentE. coli expression vector into theEcoRI-SalI site of pCMV2-FLAG. The GSK3β and p35 expression plasmids were constructed by cloning the respective cDNAs into pCMV5. The constitutively active MEK1 (CA-MEK) expression plasmid was a gift from Dr. E. Nishida (Kyoto University, Japan). HEK293 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum and 100 units/ml of penicillin and 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin. Transfection was performed using the Polyfect transfection reagent (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The transfected cells were cultured for 24 h and then lysed in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm DTT, 0.4 mm Pefabloc SC, 10 μg/ml leupeptin. The extract was obtained by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 10 min. SDS-PAGE was performed accordingly to Laemmli (35Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207227) Google Scholar). Separated proteins were transferred to Immobilon membranes (Millipore, Bedford, MA). Blots were probed with anti-rat GSK3β antiserum (100-fold dilution), anti-FLAG M2 monoclonal antibody (Sigma) (1000-fold dilution), pS493 antibody (100-fold dilution), or SMI 33 monoclonal antibody (1000-fold dilution; Sternberger Monoclonal Inc.), followed by an alkaline phosphatase-conjugated secondary antibody (1000-fold dilution; DAKO, Glostrup, Denmark). The reaction was developed using a 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate/nitro blue tetrazolium phosphatase system (KPL, Gaithersburg, MD). The amino acid sequence of the rat NF-H E-segment (bold) is shown in Fig.1 A with possible phosphorylation sites for CKs (arrowheads) and proline-directed protein kinases (double arrowheads). Amino acid residues 417–448 of the E-segment (Fig. 1 A,dot underline) were previously shown to be not phosphorylated in NF-H prepared from rat spinal cord (37Elhanany E. Jaffe H. Link W.T. Sheeley D.M. Gainer H. Pant H.C. J. Neurochem. 1994; 63: 2324-2335Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). We focused our targets to the latter two peptides, amino acids 449–472 and 473–504. Because the predicted molecular masses of their lysyl-endopeptidase digestion fragments are appropriate sizes for mass analysis (Fig. 1 A,brackets), mass spectrometry was used to analyze the in vivo phosphorylation state of the NF-H E-segment. NFs were prepared from rat spinal cord extract by Sepharose CL-4B gel filtration chromatography (Fig. 1 B,lane 1). NF-H cut of SDS-PAGE gels was digested with lysyl-endopeptidase. The resulting peptides were subjected to a matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometer. Three signals were detected at molecular masses of 2638.50, 3371.49, and 3451.18 (Fig. 1 C,upper panel). The signal with molecular mass of 2836.50 corresponded to the predicted mass of fragment 449–472 of the E-segment (Fig.1 A), indicating that it was not phosphorylated, although there are three consensus phosphorylation motifs for CKs. The molecular masses of 3371.49 and 3451.18 matched with the predicted masses (3289.25) of fragment 473–504 (Fig. 1 A) that bound one (+80) and two (+160) phosphates, respectively. The latter two signals disappeared, and instead a new signal at a mass of 3292.31 appeared when NF-H (Fig. 1 B, lane 2) was dephosphorylated (Fig. 1 C,lower panel), indicating that the peptide fragment of amino acids 473–504 was phosphorylated at one or two sites in rat spinal cords. The two phosphorylation sites in fragment 473–504 were determined by the method of MS/MS using a quadrupole-time of flight mass spectrometer. The Y-series signals assigned by using the MASCOT on-line service (www.matrixscience.com/) are shown in Fig. 1 D. Ser-493 and both Ser-493 and Ser-501 were phosphorylated in the peptide fragment with one phosphate (Fig. 1 D,upper panel) and with two phosphates (Fig. 1 D,lower panel), respectively. An NF-H E-segment kinase was purified from rat brain extracts using the E-segment expressed in E. coli as a substrate. We chose the whole E-segment (amino acids 425–507, underlined in Fig.1 A), instead of a smaller fragment encompassing just Ser-493 and Ser-501, as substrate for the kinase purification to allow for possible phosphorylation at Ser/Thr residues other than Ser-493 and Ser-501 in the E-segment. The rat brain extract was first fractionated into DEAE-cellulose-unbound and -bound fractions. An E-segment kinase activity was detected only in the DEAE-cellulose-unbound fraction. The E-segment kinase was partially purified from the DEAE-cellulose-unbound fraction by column chromatography using SP-Sepharose, heparin-Sepharose, and Superose 6 gel filtration (Fig.2 A) as described under “Materials and Methods.” The kinase activity was detected as a single peak throughout all three columns. Because of possible phosphorylation sites for both CKs and proline-directed protein kinases in the E-segment, we estimated their contribution to phosphorylation of the E-segment at each purification step by the in-gel assay for CKs or by inhibition with olomoucine, butyrolactone I, and LiCl, for proline-directed protein kinases. The CK activity was not detected in any of the E-segment kinase fractions (data not shown). LiCl alone inhibited the kinase activity in each step. Fig. 2 B shows inhibition of the E-segment kinase activity eluted from a Superose 6 gel filtration column by 20 mm LiCl, suggested it to be GSK3. This was further supported by co-elution of the kinase activity with GSK3β in a Superose 6 column (Fig. 2 A) and dose-dependent immunoprecipitation of the kinase activity with anti-GSK3β antibody (Fig. 2 C). We concluded from these data that the major NF-H E-segment kinase in rat brain extract was GSK3β. This fraction was used as the source of GSK3β in the following experiments. To determine whether GSK3β phosphorylates either or both sites of Ser-493 and Ser-501 or other sites in the E-segment, the E-segment phosphorylated by GSK3β was first analyzed by two-dimensional phosphopeptide mapping. Fig.3 A shows a result in which four phosphorylation spots were detected. Spots 1 and 2 were consistently observed. The two spots, indicated by 1′ and 2′, were speculated to be incomplete digestion products of spots 1 and 2, because they were streaked from spots 1 and 2, respectively, in variable strengths depending on the experiment. Spots 1 and 2 were subjected to the phosphoamino acid analysis and were shown to be phosphoserine (Fig. 3 B). The molecular mass of the peptide fragments migrating as spots 1 and 2 was measured by mass spectroscopy. However, no clear signal was detected probably because of the small amount of the phosphorylated peptides. Then, we mixed proteolytic fragments of the in vitro phosphorylated (32P-labeled) E-segment with the fragments derived from rat spinal cord NF-H, and after two-dimensional phosphopeptide mapping the mass of spots 1 and 2 was analyzed by a matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight MS. If spots 1 and 2 were phosphorylated at the same site(s) as NF-H in spinal cords, the lysyl-endopeptidase fragments of the native NF-H should migrate to the same position and would facilitate the detection of the mass signals as most of the NF-H molecules in spinal cords were phosphorylated. A molecular mass of 3373.01 was obtained from spot 2 (Fig. 3 C), and this mass value corresponded to that of fragment 473–504 with one phosphate addition. We could not obtain a signal from spot 1. There are two Ser residues, Ser-493 and Ser-501, in fragment 473–504. To determine which is phosphorylated by GSK3β, we generated mutants of the E-segment (S493A, S501A, and S493/501A) whose Ser-493 and Ser-501 was replaced with Ala and phosphorylated them with GSK3β. When their two-dimensional phosphopeptide maps were compared, both spots 1 and 2 disappeared with S493A and S493/501A, but not with S501A (Fig. 3 D). This result indicates that the GSK3β-phosphorylation site in the E-segment is Ser-493. At present, we do not know why both spots disappeared from a single mutation at Ser-493. GSK3 is reported to phosphorylate the KSP repeats in the NF-H tail region (22Bajaj N.P. Miller C.C. J. Neurochem. 1997; 69: 737-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 38Guidato S. Tsai L.H. Woodgett J. Miller C.C. J. Neurochem. 1996; 66: 1698-1706Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Ser-493 is in the SP sequence located in the E-segment, upstream of the KSP repeat region. We compared Ser-493 with the KSP repeats with respect to substrate preference for GSK3β. When the whole tail domain including both Ser-493 and the KSP repeat was used as a substrate, Ser-493 (spots 1 and 2) was phosphorylated earlier than the KSP repeat (several spots on line 3) (Fig. 4 B,left panel). The signals for the KSP repeats became stronger at a plateau stage (Fig. 4 B,right panel). This result suggests that Ser-493 in the E-segment is the better phosphorylation site than the KSP repeat in the NF-H tail domain for GSK3β. There are two other classes of proline-directed protein kinases, mitogen-activated protein kinase family kinases and Cdk5 in neurons, which are also capable of phosphorylating KSP repeats. Comparing Ser-493 phosphorylation by GSK3β, with those by ERK2 and Cdk5, the E-segment was found to be a better substrate for GSK3β than ERK2 and Cdk5 (Fig. 5, upper panel). This was not because of the relative strength of the kinase activities used. When the whole tail domain was used as a substrate, ERK2 phosphorylated it most intensely, Cdk5 moderately, and GSK3β marginally (Fig. 5, lower panel). These results suggested that Ser-493 in the E-segment is mainly phosphorylated by GSK3β and the KSP repeats mainly by ERK and Cdk5. To verify that GSK3β is the Ser-493 kinase in cultured cells, we transfected 293 cells with the cDNAs of NF-H and GSK3β, and studied the phosphorylation of Ser-493. To detect specific phosphorylation at Ser-493 in NF-H, we produced a phosphorylation-dependent antibody (anti-pS493) against phosphorylated Ser-493. The specificity of the antibody was shown by its reaction with the E-segment phosphorylated by GSK3β in vitro but not with the unphosphorylated E-segment (Fig.6 A). Anti-pS493 antibody reacted with native phosphorylated NF-H isolated from spinal cords but did not react with dephosphorylated NF-H (Fig. 6 B), confirming the result of mass analysis in Fig. 1. Phosphorylation of Ser-493 in the E-segment and full-length NF-H was shown by co-transfection with GSK3β into 293 cells (Fig. 6, C andD). The pS493 antibody did not react with the E-segment and NF-H expressed in 293 cells but reacted with them when co-transfected with GSK3β. The results indicate that GSK3β phosphorylates NF-H at Ser-493 under cellular conditions. GSK3β phosphorylated at Ser-493 preferable to the KSP repeats (Fig.4), and mitogen-activated protein kinase and Cdk5 were less active against the E-segment than GSK3β (Fig. 5). This was confirmed in transfected cultured cells. The NF-H tail domain was co-transfected with GS"

Synthetic PW2 shows anticoccidial activity against E. acervulina and Eimeria tenella with very low hemolytic activity. It also displays antifungal activity but no activity against bacteria. We present the solution structure of the PW2 bound to SDS micelles. In the absence of an interface, PW2 is in random coil conformation. In micelles, structural calculation shows that Trp-7 forms the hydrophobic core that is important for the peptide folding. Lys-4, Tyr-6, Trp-8, and Arg-9 are in the same surface, possibly facing the micelle interface. This possibility was supported by the fact that chemical shift differences for these residues were more pronounced when compared with PW2 in water and in SDS. PW2 gains structure upon binding to SDS micelles. Lys-4, Tyr-6, Trp-8, and Arg-9 were found to bind to the micelle. Trp-7, Trp-8, and Arg-9 composed the WW+ consensus found in the sequence of the peptides selected with the phage display technique against E. acervulina sporozoites. This suggested that Trp-7, Trp-8, and Arg-9 are probably key residues not only for the peptide interaction with SDS micelles but also for the interaction with E. acervulina sporozoites surface.1M02 PW2 (HPLKQYWWRPSI) was selected from phage display libraries through an alternative panning method using living sporozoites of Eimeria acervulina as target.

Lys-4, Tyr-6, Trp-8, and Arg-9 are in the same surface, possibly facing the micelle interface. This possibility was supported by the fact that chemical shift differences for these residues were more pronounced when compared with PW2 in water and in SDS. PW2 gains structure upon binding to SDS micelles. Lys-4, Tyr-6, Trp-8, and Arg-9 were found to bind to the micelle. Trp-7, Trp-8, and Arg-9 composed the WW+ consensus found in the sequence of the peptides selected with the phage display technique against E. acervulina sporozoites. This suggested that Trp-7, Trp-8, and Arg-9 are probably key residues not only for the peptide interaction with SDS micelles but also for the interaction with E. acervulina sporozoites surface. 1M02 trifluorethanol nuclear Overhauser effect NOE spectroscopy total correlation spectroscopy root mean square deviation The presence of antimicrobial peptides in the animal and plant kingdoms suggests that these molecules played a fundamental role in the evolution of complex multicellular organisms. There are a large number of antimicrobial peptides with considerable sequence diversity. Rarely, the same peptide sequence is recovered from two different species, even those closely related, such as insects, frogs, or mammals. Exceptions include peptides cleaved from highly conserved proteins, such as buforin II (1Zasloff M. Nature. 2002; 415: 389-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (6657) Google Scholar).The novel anticoccidial peptide PW2 (HPLKQYWWRPSI) was selected from phage display peptide libraries by an alternative method of panning using living Eimeria acervulina sporozoites as targets. PW2 was also effective against Eimeria tenella and several other fungi. It showed low activity against Toxoplasma gondiitachyzoites and no activity against Trypanosoma cruzi,Crithidia fasciculata epimastigotes, or bacteria. In addition, the parasiticidal concentrations of PW2 produced very low lytic effects on mammalian and avian cells (2Silva Jr., A Kawazoe U. Freitas F.F.T. Gatti M.S.V. Dolder H. Shumacher R.I. Juliano M.A. Silva M.J. Leite A. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2002; 120: 53-60Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).PW2 is a Trp-rich peptide with antimicrobial activity. Several other Trp-rich peptides presenting antimicrobial activity are described in the literature. Indolicidin (ILPWKWPWWPWRR, Refs. 3Selsted M.E. Novotny M.J. Morris W.L. Tang Y.Q. Smith W.

Their structures were solved in solution in the presence of micellar interfaces (8Rozek A. Friedrich C.L. Hancock R.E.W.

Other Trp-rich antimicrobial peptides have been described in the literature: ACE-AMP1 (10Cammue B.P.A. Thevissen K. Hendriks M. Eggermont K. Goderis I.J. Proost P. Van Damme J. Osborn R.W. Guerbette F. Kader J.C. Broekaert W.F.

Blochet J.E. Desormeaux A. Marion D. Pezolet M.

Parasitol. 2002; 120: 53-60Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) in the same manner as other Trp-rich peptides with antimicrobial activity, such as indolicidin (12Wu M. Maier E. Benz R. Hancock R.E. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 7235-7242Crossref PubMed Scopus (618) Google Scholar) and tritrpticin (9Schibli D.J. Hwang P.M. Vogel H.J. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 16749-16755Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). However, the detailed mechanism of action of antimicrobial peptides remains to be elucidated. A model that explains the activity of most antimicrobial peptides is the Shai-Matsuzaki-Huang model (13Matsuzaki K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1462: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (847) Google Scholar, 14Yang L. Weiss T.M. Lehrer R.I. Huang H.W. Biophys.

Acta. 1999; 1462: 55-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (1557) Google Scholar), which proposes the initial interaction of the peptide with the membrane followed by displacement of lipids, alteration of membrane structure, and in certain cases, entry of the peptide into the target cell.Several studies suggested that membrane perturbation is an important, but not a lethal, event. These studies have proposed that the initial step is an electrostatic association of the positively charged peptide with the negatively charged groups of the membrane. This association would be followed by peptide folding into amphipathic structures. Consequently, this interaction would distort the outer membrane bilayer, allowing access to the cytoplasmatic membrane, where peptide channel formation is thought to occur (16Subbalakshmi C. Krishnakumari V. Nagaraj R. Sitaram N. FEBS Lett. 1996; 395: 48-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 17Friedrich C.L. Rozek A. Patrzykat A. Hancock R.E.W. J. Biol.

There is a growing body of evidence indicating that antimicrobial peptides may not solely kill by membrane disruption but may follow various mechanisms of action, including their interaction with cellular targets (13Matsuzaki K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1462: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (847) Google Scholar, 14Yang L. Weiss T.M. Lehrer R.I. Huang H.W. Biophys.

Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 3016-3026Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar).In a study with indolicidin, a 13-residue Trp-rich peptide from bovine neutrophils, it was found that antibacterial activity was not due to membrane permeabilization (16Subbalakshmi C. Krishnakumari V. Nagaraj R. Sitaram N. FEBS Lett. 1996; 395: 48-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Substitution of the tryptophans by phenylalanine and prolines by alanines did not suppress antimicrobial activity (16Subbalakshmi C. Krishnakumari V. Nagaraj R. Sitaram N. FEBS Lett. 1996; 395: 48-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). The preponderance of aromatic residues and the overall cationic nature might favor interaction with nucleic acids. It is conceivable that indolicidin might exert its activity by interacting with nucleic acids, thus preventing both replication and/or transcription (8Rozek A. Friedrich C.L. Hancock R.E.W. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 15765-15774Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar).In the present manuscript, we present the solution structure of PW2 bound to membrane-mimetic SDS micelles by two-dimensional NMR methods. PW2 was also fully assigned in water, 40 mm SDS, and 160 mm SDS. Chemical shift comparison enabled us to assign the possible site of interaction with the interface of the micelles. This study contributes to the elucidation of the mechanism of peptide-membrane interactions and highlights several structural features that are important for this interaction.RESULTSWe selected three sample conditions to perform the resonance assignments of PW2. The first was in water (20 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 5.0) and was used for comparison with the other experimental conditions, being representative of the free state in solution. In the other two conditions, the samples were in the presence of 40 and 160 mm SDS, respectively. The behavior of PW2 in the presence of detergents was intriguing. In the absence of SDS, the peptide was highly soluble. At SDS/PW2 molar ratios lower than 7.5, PW2 precipitates. When the relative amount of SDS was raised further, PW2 became soluble again. A similar behavior has been reported for indolicidin (8Rozek A. Friedrich C.L. Hancock R.E.W. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 15765-15774Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). We chose to work using two SDS/PW2 molar ratios in which PW2 was soluble. At a high molar ratio, little conformational exchange was observed (Fig. 1), mainly because PW2 was preferentially bound to the interface. Under those conditions, we obtained good quality spectra, and the assignment was straightforward. On the other hand, at [SDS]/[PW2] = 10, there was considerable conformational exchange, as evidenced by the broader spectral lines (Fig. 1). The TOCSY spectrum was uninformative, due to fast relaxation during the spin-lock time (small T1ρ).The conformational exchange when [SDS]/[PW2] = 10 could be explained by a millisecond to microseconds time scale equilibrium between the free and micelle-bound states of PW2. Fig. 1 shows the one-dimensional hydrogen spectrum of PW2 as a function of SDS concentration. Note that the spectrum in water displays sharp lines (Fig. 1 A). Upon addition of SDS, there was an increase in line width (Fig. 1, B and C), indicating the presence of conformational exchange. By ignoring the line width differences, the two conditions in SDS showed very similar profiles, indicating similar structures for PW2. [SDS]/[PW2] = 10 was representative of an intermediate step in the binding process, whereas the [SDS]/[PW2] = 40 ratio was considered as the bound state.CD SpectroscopyThe CD spectra of PW2 recorded with and without SDS and TFE are shown in Fig. 2. In aqueous solution, the spectrum presents a negative band at 200 nm (−5000 degrees cm2 dmol−1). This is typical of peptides in a random coil conformation (31Woody R.W. Eur. Biophys. J. Biophys. 1994; 23: 253-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar) and corroborates the data in Fig. 1. The addition of 25% TFE and SDS led to a gain of structure. This is supported by the fact that the negative band at 200 nm became less negative and more intense between 200 and 230 nm. An intense negative band at 220 nm was observed in the presence of 25% TFE (220 nm) and 4 mm SDS (228 nm). These negative bands at ∼225 nm are characteristic features of aromatic bundles (31Woody R.W. Eur. Biophys. J. Biophys. 1994; 23: 253-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar) or turns in the structure (32Yang J.J. Pitkealthly M. Radfird S.E. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 7345-7353Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The bands arising from the excitation of aromatic rings can be either positive or negative. The negative band at 220 nm observed in 25% TFE was not necessarily typical of a helical structure because there were no negative band at 208 nm at this condition. The CD analysis of the secondary structures in these spectra is complex since the presence of the aromatic side chains prevents the observation of the secondary structure characteristic bands. CD spectroscopy was in complete agreement with Fig. 1. CD spectra do not change significantly when the SDS/PW2 molar ratios are increased above 7.5.Figure 2Circular dichroism spectra of PW2 63 μm in 20 mmsodium phosphate buffer at pH 5.0 and 25 °C.

NMR of Proteins and Nucleic Acids. Wiley-Interscience, New York1986Crossref Google Scholar). Sequential connectivities could be observed through dαN(i + 1), dβN(i + 1), and dNN(i + 1) NOEs.Structure CalculationThe structure calculation was performed with distance restraints obtained at the molar ratio [SDS]/[PW2] equal to 40. Structural statistics are shown in Table I. A total of 154 NOEs were unambiguously identified, being 50 inter-residual NOEs. There are two spin systems for proline 2 δ-hydrogens, indicative of the existence of cis and trans conformations for this amino acid. The dαδ(i + 1) NOE, typical for thetrans conformer of proline, and the dαα(i + 1) NOE, typical of the cis conformer of proline, were not observed for Pro-2 (33Wüthrich K. NMR of Proteins and Nucleic Acids. Wiley-Interscience, New York1986Crossref Google Scholar); therefore, we could not unambiguously identify the cis and trans conformers. Probably the absence of these NOEs was due to the high flexibility of the N terminus of PW2. In the case of Pro-10, only dαδ(i + 1) NOEs were observed, indicating that this proline is in transconformation. Clearly, Pro-10 is in a more structured portion of the polypeptide chain.Table ISummary of structural statistics for PW2 in SDS micellesTotal no. of distance constraints154No. of intraresidue constraints104No. of sequential constraints39No. of medium to long range constraints11List of the medium to long range NOEsi, i+2: Lys-4(HN) -Pro-2(Hα), Trp-7(HN) -Gln-5(Hβ), Leu-3(Hδ)-Gln-5(HN), Trp-8(HN) -Pro-10(Hγ), Lys-4(HN) -Pro-2(Hβ)i, i+3:Tyr-6(Hɛ)-Leu-3(Hδ), Tyr-6(Hδ)-Leu-3(Hδ), Tyr-6(Hδ)-Leu-3(Hα)i, i+4: Trp-7(Hɛ3) -Ser-11(Hα)i, i+(>4): Trp-7(Hɛ3) -Pro-2(Hδ), Trp-7(Hɛ3) -Pro2(Hγ)r.m.s. deviations from ideal geometrycovalent bonds (A°)0.0024 ± 0.00030covalent angles (A°)0.5930 ± 0.0692improper (degrees)0.3932 ± 0.1169dihedral (degrees)0.830 ± 0.01478NOE0.0134 ± 0.0023Energies (Kcal/mol)overall44.97 ± 10.96bond1.36 ± 0.34angle23.23 ± 5.19improper3.71 ± 1.93VDW11.59 ± 2.38NOE2.75 ± 1.43pairwise rmsd (Å)residues 1–12backbone1.58heavy2.32residues 4–10backbone0.66heavy1.18 Open table in a new tab Long range NOEs between the side chain Hε3 tryptophan 7 and the δ- and γ-hydrogens of Pro-2 were observed. These non-ambiguous NOEs were important in defining the folding of the peptide. It is important to mention that both proline 2 spin systems present these long range NOEs connecting to Trp-7. Other long range NOEs were responsible for a well defined three-dimensional structure of the peptide: Tyr-6(Hε) with Leu-3(Hδ), Tyr-6(Hδ) with Leu-3(Hα), Trp-7(Hε) with Ser-11(Hα), among others. Table I shows the list of all medium and long range NOEs.The NOESY spectrum in water presented only intraresidual and sequential NOEs, indicating lack of structure under those conditions. The assignment was straightforward due the relatively sharp lines and the good quality of the spectra (not shown).The NOESY spectrum of PW2 at the SDS/PW2 molar ratio of 10 presented three spin systems for Leu-3 as a consequence of its vicinity to Pro-2, which undergoes slow exchange between the cis andtrans conformations. With the increase of the [SDS]/[PW2] molar ratio to 40, the number of Leu-3 spin systems decreased to two, indicating a conformational stabilization of the peptide. The two spin systems for Leu-3 were identical by considering the NOEs present in each of them. The calculated structure is shown in Fig. 3. Fig. 3 A shows the superposition of the 20 lowest energy structures, and Fig.3 B shows the lowest energy structure. The peptide is folded in such a way that tryptophan 7 forms a hydrophobic core along with proline 2 and proline 10. The aromatic residues tyrosine 6 and tryptophan 8 are exposed to the surface of the peptide and could, therefore, be the responsible for the negative band at ∼225 nm observed in the CD spectra. The presence of two turns that characterize the structure could also give rise to the negative band observed in the CD spectra. Both aromatic residues are in the vicinity of the positively charged amino acids, arginine 9 and lysine 4. The close proximity of the side chain of Trp-9 and Arg-9 is suggestive of a π-stacking interaction that could contribute to the stabilization of the whole three-dimensional conformation.Figure 3Calculated structures for PW2.

The structure has a triangular shape whose base could be postulated as the contact surface with the micelle interface. The solution structure suggests that the peptide folds so that the aromatic residues and the positively charged amino acids form a flat surface. This surface extends from Lys-4 to Arg-9.Fig. 4, A and B, shows the comparison of the α and the amide hydrogen chemical shifts of PW2 in buffer, [SDS]/[PW2] = 10 and [SDS]/[PW2] = 40 with the random coil values (33Wüthrich K. NMR of Proteins and Nucleic Acids. Wiley-Interscience, New York1986Crossref Google Scholar). In the presence of SDS, there is a pronounced amide chemical shift change from residues Lys-4 to Arg-9. For α-hydrogens, the difference in chemical shifts behave in a similar way. In both SDS/PW2 molar ratios, chemical shift differences are similar except for residues Trp-8 and Arg-9. Chemical shift differences between random coil values and the three conditions used show the same profile. This was important since it indicates that, in the absence of SDS (free state), PW2 might show the same structural tendency observed in SDS but with more flexibility.Figure 4Summary of chemical shifts and structure data for PW2.

Black, backbone; gray, heavy.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Although with a similar profile, PW2 chemical shifts differ between the free state and the SDS bound state at different SDS/PW2 molar ratios (Fig. 4, C and D). The largest positive differences for the α-hydrogens (Fig. 4 D) were observed for residues Lys-4, Gln-5, Tyr-6, Trp-7, Trp-8, and Arg-9. A negative chemical shift difference was observed for residue Ile-12. For the amidic hydrogens (Fig. 4 C), the most pronounced chemical shift differences occurred in residues Lys-4, Gln-5, Tyr-6, Trp-8, Arg-9, Ser-11, and Ile-12. The two SDS/PW2 molar ratios studied behave similarly for most of the residues with the exception of Trp-8 and Trp-9 (Fig. 4 C).These chemical shift differences (Fig. 4, C andD) reflected the process of PW2 binding to the micelle interface. The residues that showed more striking chemical shift changes were Lys-4, Gln-5, Tyr-6, Trp-7, Trp-8, Arg-9, and the C terminus. Residue Trp-7 formed the hydrophobic core of the structure, whereas Lys-4, Tyr-6, Trp-8, and Arg-9 were at the surface. The differences for the amide hydrogens led to the same conclusion with the finding that, for residues Trp-8 and Arg-9, these differences occur only at a SDS/PW2 molar ratio equal to 40. It is noteworthy that chemical shift differences for Trp-8 and Arg-9 between the two SDS/PW2 molar ratios were the only difference between the bound and intermediate state.Fig. 4, E and F, shows the number of NOEs and the r.m.s.d. per residue, respectively. It can be observed that there is a higher number of NOEs for residues 6, 7, 8, and 9, in accordance with the residues with higher resolution in the structure. Residues Trp-7, Trp-8, and Arg-9 had the best resolution of them all (lowest r.m.s.d.). These residues also corresponded to the sequence consensus WW+ observed among the peptides selected from phage display libraries using E .acervulina sporozoites as target, as reported by Silva, Jr. et al. (2Silva Jr., A Kawazoe U. Freitas F.F.T. Gatti M.S.V. Dolder H. Shumacher R.I. Juliano M.A. Silva M.J. Leite A. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2002; 120: 53-60Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).DISCUSSIONIn the present manuscript, we described the solution structure of the peptide PW2 bound to a micelle interface. PW2, selected by phage display, shows anticoccidial activity, being specific for E. acervulina and E. tenella. It also presents antifungal activity. Although its mode of action is still unknown, membrane permeabilization has been proposed as a possible mechanism of action (2Silva Jr., A Kawazoe U. Freitas F.F.T. Gatti M.S.V. Dolder H. Shumacher R.I. Juliano M.A. Silva M.J. Leite A. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2002; 120: 53-60Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), similarly to other Trp-rich peptides with antimicrobial activity, such as indolicidin (12Wu M. Maier E. Benz R. Hancock R.E. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 7235-7242Crossref PubMed Scopus (618) Google Scholar) and tritrpticin (9Schibli D.J. Hwang P.M. Vogel H.J. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 16749-16755Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar).PW2 displayed some features that were different from the other Trp-rich peptides, such as the absence of antibacterial activity and its low hemolytic activity. One possible explanation is that PW2 has the lowest percentage (50%) of hydrophobic amino acids when compared with indolicidin (77%) and tritrpticin (69%). Studies with indolicidin showed a correlation between the presence of tryptophan residues and hemolytic activity (8Rozek A. Friedrich C.L. Hancock R.E.W. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 15765-15774Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). For indolicidin, it was also noted that substitution of tryptophans by phenylalanines decreased the antibacterial activity but did not eliminate it. Therefore, the low number of tryptophans in PW2 may explain its low hemolytic activity.Indolicidin, tritrpticin, and PW2 present different antimicrobial activity. Indolicidin has a broad activity spectrum against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria (3Selsted M.E. Novotny M.J. Morris W.L. Tang Y.Q. Smith W. Cullor J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 4292-4295Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), protozoa (4Aley S.B. Zimmerman M. Hetsko M. Selsted M.E. Gillin F.D. Infect. Immun. 1994; 62: 5397-5403Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), fungi (5Ahmad I. Perkins W.R. Lupan D.M. Selsted M.E. Janoff A.S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1237: 109-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar), and the enveloped virus HPV-1 (6Robinson Jr., W.E. McDougall B. Tran D. Selsted M.E. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1998; 63: 94-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Tritrpticin shows activity against bacteria and fungus (7Lawyer C. Pai S. Watabe M. Borgia P. Mashimo T. Eagleton L. Watabe K. FEBS Lett. 1996; 390: 95Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar), and PW2 shows activity againstEimeria and fungus (2Silva Jr., A Kawazoe U. Freitas F.F.T. Gatti M.S.V. Dolder H. Shumacher R.I. Juliano M.A. Silva M.J. Leite A. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2002; 120: 53-60Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) but not against bacteria (2Silva Jr., A Kawazoe U. Freitas F.F.T. Gatti M.S.V. Dolder H. Shumacher R.I. Juliano M.A. Silva M.J. Leite A. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2002; 120: 53-60Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The specificity of Trp-rich peptides is not yet understood. Structural comparison shows an important difference in the positive charge distribution along the peptide chain that might be related to the specificity. For tritrpticin, the positive charges are in the N and C termini of the peptide chain (9Schibli D.J. Hwang P.M. Vogel H.J. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 16749-16755Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). In contrast, in PW2, the two positive charges (Lys-4 and Arg-9) are in the center of the peptide primary structure and close to the aromatic binding region. Indolicidin shows two positive charges in the C terminus and another in the middle of the chain (8Rozek A. Friedrich C.L. Hancock R.E.W. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 15765-15774Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar).The observed folding of PW2 is similar to indolicidin (8Rozek A. Friedrich C.L. Hancock R.E.W.

It is noticeable that the multiple tryptophan residues present in these structures tend to form a common structural motif. One tryptophan is part of a hydrophobic core in the structure, whereas other tryptophans are on the surface of the peptide, forming the putative membrane binding site. Prolines and other hydrophobic residues tend to be part of this hydrophobic core.For PW2, the residues presenting higher chemical shift deviation upon binding to the micelle are Lys-4, Tyr-6, Trp-7, Trp-8, and Arg-9 (Fig.4).

https://openalex.org/W2118171561,"Neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2), a syndrome associated with multiple tumors of the nervous system, mostly schwannomas, is caused by mutations in the NF2 tumor suppressor gene that encodes schwannomin (Sch). Here we examined NF2 pathogenetic mutations that result in misfolding of the FERM domain. We found that these mutant forms of Sch were efficiently degraded by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. In transfected cells, Sch Delta F118 was 3-fold more efficiently degraded than the related molecule ezrin bearing the equivalent mutation. In heterozygous Nf2 knock-out mouse fibroblasts, endogenous mutant Sch Delta 81-121, but not wild type Sch, was also degraded by proteasomes. We further show that this degradation pathway is functional in primary Schwann cells. We analyzed Sch Delta 39-121 expressed in a transgenic mouse model of NF2 and found that Sch Delta 39-121, but not the endogenous wild type Sch, was unstable due to proteasome-mediated degradation. Altogether these results suggest that degradation of mutant Sch mediated by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway is a physiopathological pathway contributing to the loss of Sch function in NF2 patients."
https://openalex.org/W1964906994,"In prion diseases, the normal prion protein (PrP<sup>c</sup>) undergoes a conformational change that results in the abnormal form, named scrapie prion protein (PrP<sup>sc</sup>). The visual system of rodents provides a relatively simple neuronal model in which the cell bodies of neurons are confined to the retina and the axons constitute the optic nerve. We investigated by Western blot the profile of PrP<sup>c</sup> in the optic nerve and retina of normal hamsters and mice. We found that in the optic nerve the amount of PrP<sup>c</sup> is significantly higher than in the retina. A less abundant non-glycosylated band was observed in retinas compared with the optic nerve and brain. Similar results were found in the gray and white matter from normal mice and hamsters. After stereotaxic injection of ME7 or 139A in the superior colliculus, a visual target area, the proportion and glycopattern of PrP changed in the retina and optic nerve throughout the course of the disease. Similar results were found in the gray and white matter at terminal stage of scrapie after injection of ME7 and 139A in the dorsal hippocampus. This is the first time that changes in the distribution and glycopattern of PrP have been described in an <i>in vivo</i> model of prion diseases."

This raised the question of how Cys-tRNACys is synthesized in these methanogenic archaea. The reports that purified recombinant M. jannaschiiprolyl-tRNA synthetase (ProRS) was able to aminoacylate tRNACys with cysteine provided an apparent answer to this question (6Stathopoulos C., Li, T.

Our recent finding that cysteine activation is an inherent property of ProRS enzymes (43Ahel I. Stathopoulos C. Ambrogelly A. Sauerwald A. Toogood H. Hartsch T. Söll D. J. Biol.

Here we show that a purified recombinant form of the M. jannaschii enzyme, previously called ProCysRS, misaminoacylates tRNAPro with cysteine but is unable to aminoacylate tRNACys with cysteine. These properties of M. jannaschii ProRS raise the question of the true in vivoactivities of this enzyme. In view of these results, we have renamed the enzyme ProRS in this paper. Oligonucleotide synthesis and DNA sequencing were performed by the Keck Foundation Research Biotechnology Resource Laboratory at Yale University. The TOPO-TA cloning kit was from Invitrogen. pET-15b expression vector was purchased from Novagen. Epicurian coli© BL21-CodonPlusTM competent cells were from Stratagene. [35S]Cysteine (1075 Ci/mmol) was from PerkinElmer Life Sciences, and [3H]proline (104 Ci/mmol), [14C]proline (516 cpm/pmol), [3H]alanine (52 Ci/mmol), [(γ32P]ATP, and [α-32P]ATP (10 Ci/mmol) were from Amersham Biosciences. Nitrocellulose filters (0.45 μm) were from Schleicher & Schuell. Cysteine analogues were from Sigma. Plasmid T7–911 for preparation of the His6-tagged recombinant T7 RNA polymerase was a gift from T. Shrader (Albert Einstein College of Medicine, New York, NY). Isolation of T7 RNA polymerase transcripts of tRNAPro and M. jannaschii total tRNA was carried out as described previously (6Stathopoulos C., Li, T. Longman R. Vothknecht U.C. Becker H. Ibba M. Söll D. Science. 2000; 287: 479-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar,8Stathopoulos C. Jacquin-Becker C. Becker H.D., Li, T. Ambrogelly A. Longman R. Söll D. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 46-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Individual Cys-tRNAPro and Cys-tRNACys samples were purified by affinity chromatography on immobilized Thermus thermophilus EF1A-GTP as described previously (16Ribeiro S. Nock S. Sprinzl M. Anal. Biochem. 1995; 228: 330-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Unfractionated M. jannaschiitRNA was aminoacylated with [35S]cysteine using eitherM. jannaschii ProRS or M. maripaludis CysRS. The resulting Cys-tRNA was separated from the uncharged tRNA by the formation of a ternary complex with T. thermophilus EF1A-GTP immobilized on a Ni-NTA-agarose column. After elution of Cys-tRNA and removal of cysteine by deacylation (30 min at 37 °C in 0.2 m Tris acetate, pH 9.0), the tRNAs were found to be highly purified as judged by amino acid acceptor activity (1440 pmol/A 260 for tRNACysand 1040 pmol/A 260 for tRNAPro). The M. jannaschii proS gene and the M. maripaludis cysS gene previously cloned into pET-15b expression vector (6Stathopoulos C., Li, T. Longman R. Vothknecht U.C. Becker H. Ibba M. Söll D.

A carboxyl-terminal deletion of M. jannaschii ProRS (named ProRSΔ50) was constructed by the removal of 50 carboxyl-terminal amino acids. The PCR product was cloned into TOPO-TA vector, sequenced, and finally subcloned into pET-15b vector for overexpression. The His6-tagged M. jannaschii ProRS and ProRSΔ50 as well as His6-tagged M. maripaludis CysRS (17Stathopoulos C. Kim W., Li, T. Anderson I. Deutsch B. Palioura S. Whitman W. Söll D. Proc. Natl. Acad.

These enzymes are referred to as recombinant enzymes, because they are derived by heterologous expression of cloned genes. Protein concentration was measured by the Bradford assay (Bio-Rad) using bovine serum albumin as standard. The enzyme preparations were >95% pure as judged by SDS-PAGE followed by staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. The standard reaction mixture contained 50 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.0, 50 mm KCl, 15 mm MgCl2, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 10 mm ATP, 50 μm [35S]cysteine, 50 μm [3H]proline or 500 μm[3H]alanine, 1 mg/ml unfractionated M. jannaschii tRNA (unless specified otherwise), and either M. jannaschii ProRS or M. maripaludis CysRS to a final volume of 120 μl. The reactions were incubated at 50 °C for the time specified in the figures. For active site titration (18Fersht A.R. Ashford J.S. Bruton C.J. Jakes R. Koch G.L. Hartley B.S. Biochemistry. 1975; 14: 1-4Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar), the enzyme preparations were incubated in 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mm KCl, 50 mm MgCl2 with inorganic pyrophosphatase (1 mg/ml) (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), ATP (final concentration 4 mm), and [14C]proline (final concentration 19 μm) in a volume of 140 μl at 50 °C. Samples (30 μl) were taken at various time points. This method (19Varshney U. Lee C.P. RajBhandary U.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 24712-24718Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) allows the separation of charged from uncharged tRNA attributed to a difference in electrophoretic mobility between the two species. Hybridization of a sequence-specific probe permits the determination of the identity of the aminoacylated tRNA on the gel. Unfractionated M. jannaschii tRNA was aminoacylated either with proline (by M. jannaschii ProRS) or cysteine (by M. jannaschii ProRS or M. maripaludis CysRS) as described previously (6Stathopoulos C., Li, T. Longman R. Vothknecht U.C. Becker H. Ibba M. Söll D. Science. 2000; 287: 479-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 19Varshney U. Lee C.P. RajBhandary U.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 24712-24718Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). After phenol extraction and ethanol precipitation, the aminoacyl-tRNAs were dissolved in 10 mm sodium acetate, pH 4.5, 1 mmNa-EDTA at a final concentration of 8 μg/μl and stored at −80 °C. Half of the preparation was deacylated for 30 min at 37 °C with 0.2 m Tris acetate, pH 9.0. For the electrophoresis, 20 μg of unfractionated tRNA (aminoacylated or deacylated) were loaded on a 65-cm long, 0.4-mm thick 6.5% polyacrylamide gel containing 7 m urea and run at 4 °C, 600 V in 0.1 m sodium acetate, pH 5.0, for 48 h. The portion of the gel containing the tRNAs was electroblotted onto a Hybond N+ membrane (Amersham Biosciences) using a Hoefer Electroblot apparatus at 10 V for 15 min and then at 30 V for 2 h with 10 mm Tris acetate, pH 8.0, 5 mm sodium acetate, and 0.5 mm Na-EDTA as transfer buffer. The membranes were then baked at 72 °C for 2 h. The tRNAs were detected by hybridization to a 5′-32P-labeled oligo-deoxyribonucleotide probe. The probes were complementary to nucleotides 1–21 and 26–51 of tRNACys and tRNA UGGPro, respectively. Replacement of the terminal adenosine of M. jannaschii tRNAProtranscript (A 260 = 12.5 units) by 2′-deoxyadenosine, 3′-deoxyadenosine, or adenosine was performed as described previously (20Sprinzl M.

The same procedure was followed to isolate the 2′-deoxyadenosine or 3′-deoxyadenosine containing analogues of tRNA starting from unfractionated M. jannaschii tRNA. The tRNAs reconstructed with ATP had similar charging levels compared with the original tRNAPro transcript (proline charging, 300 pmol/A 260) or the unfractionated tRNA (cysteine charging, 20 pmol/A 260). Mischarged Cys-tRNAPro and Ala-tRNAPro were generated by the charging of unfractionated M. jannaschii tRNA with M. jannaschii ProRS at 50 °C for 15 min in standard reaction buffer (23Beuning P.J. Musier-Forsyth K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30779-30785Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) with 50 μm [35S]cysteine and 500 μm [3H]alanine, respectively. After phenol and chloroform extraction, aminoacyl-tRNA was precipitated with ethanol and the precipitate was washed and dried. Deacylation assays were performed as described previously (24Beuning P.J. Musier-Forsyth K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 8916-8920Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar) at 37 °C in the presence of 4.5 μm enzyme (M. jannaschii ProRS,M. jannaschii ProRSΔ50). No enzyme or 1.2 mNaOH was used as negative and positive controls, respectively. Ten different cysteine analogues were tested as inhibitors using standard aminoacylation conditions: [35S]cysteine (50 μm), inhibitor (1 mm), M. jannaschii ProRS (300 nm), and total M. jannaschii tRNA (1 mg/ml) for 20 min at 50 °C. Thed-cysteine sample contains <0.3%l-cysteine. ATP-PPiexchange reactions were performed as described previously (6Stathopoulos C., Li, T. Longman R. Vothknecht U.C. Becker H. Ibba M. Söll D. Science. 2000; 287: 479-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Reactions were conducted in 50 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.2, 10 mm MgCl2, 50 mm potassium fluoride, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 2 mm KF, 2 mm ATP, 2 mm32PPi (2 cpm/pmol), 1 μm M. jannaschii ProRS, 2 mml-cysteine, or d-cysteine, homocysteine or l-cysteine methyl ester (200 mmeach) in a final volume of 200 μl at 50 °C. [32P]ATP formation was followed by specific absorption on acid-washed Norit (200 μl of a 1% suspension (w/v) of Norit in a solution of 0.4m sodium pyrophosphate solution containing 15% (v/v) perchloric acid), filtration on Whatman GF/C filters followed by washing with 15 ml of water and 5 ml of ethanol. Acid urea gel electrophoresis has been a reliable tool to determine the aminoacylation specificity of aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (19Varshney U. Lee C.P. RajBhandary U.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 24712-24718Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The method is based on the electrophoretic separation of tRNA and aminoacyl-tRNA and subsequent hybridization with a sequence-specific oligonucleotide to determine the identity of the aminoacylated tRNA. To identify which of the M. jannaschiitRNAs were being aminoacylated by the recombinant M. jannaschii ProRS, we aminoacylated unfractionated M. jannaschii tRNAs with the ProRS in the presence of proline or cysteine. Following acid urea gel electrophoresis, the tRNAs that were aminoacylated were identified by Northern blot analysis using probes specific for tRNAPro (Fig.1 A) or tRNACys(Fig. 1 B). As a positive control for aminoacylation of tRNACys, recombinant M. maripaludis CysRS was also used in a separate aminoacylation reaction. Fig. 1 shows the results. M. jannaschii ProRS charges proline onto tRNAPro (Fig. 1 A, lane 6) but not onto tRNACys (Fig. 1 B, lane 10).M. jannaschii ProRS also aminoacylates tRNAProessentially quantitatively with cysteine (Fig. 1 A,lane 5) but does not aminoacylate tRNACys with cysteine (Fig. 1 B, lane 12). The tRNACys in the unfractionated tRNA preparation used is fully active, because it could be aminoacylated essentially quantitatively by M. maripaludis CysRS (Fig. 1 B,lane 13). Thus, M. jannaschii ProRS misaminoacylates tRNAPro with cysteine but does not aminoacylate tRNACys. As expected, all of the aminoacyl-tRNAs could be deacylated to tRNA by treatment with base (Fig. 1 A, lanes 4 and 7, and Fig.1 B, lane 14). The above conclusion that M. jannaschii ProRS misaminoacylates tRNAPro with cysteine but not tRNACys was also confirmed by aminoacylation of purified preparations of M. jannaschii tRNAPro and tRNACys isolated by EF1A affinity chromatography (16Ribeiro S. Nock S. Sprinzl M. Anal. Biochem. 1995; 228: 330-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). For this experiment, unfractionated M. jannaschii tRNA was aminoacylated with cysteine using M. jannaschii ProRS or M. maripaludis CysRS. The aminoacyl-tRNA was separated from all of the other tRNAs by chromatography on GTP-activated T. thermophilus EF1A immobilized on a Ni-NTA-agarose column. Following elution of the aminoacyl-tRNA, the amino acid attached to the tRNA was removed by treatment with base. The resulting tRNAPro sample could be aminoacylated by M. jannaschii ProRS with proline or with cysteine to approximately equal levels, whereas it could not be aminoacylated with cysteine by M. maripaludis CysRS (Fig.2 A). The tRNACyssample could be aminoacylated by M. maripaludis CysRS, but it could not be aminoacylated with either cysteine or proline byM. jannaschii ProRS (Fig. 2 B). These results demonstrate that M. jannaschii ProRS catalyzes the synthesis of Cys-tRNAPro but not of Cys-tRNACys. Modified nucleosides in M. jannaschii tRNAPro, suggested to be a prerequisite for accurate aminoacylation (11Lipman R.S. Wang J. Sowers K.R. Hou Y.M. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 315: 943-949Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar), are not essential as the transcript of the tRNAPro gene can be aminoacylated with proline or cysteine (data not shown) (11Lipman R.S. Wang J. Sowers K.R. Hou Y.M. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 315: 943-949Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). tRNAPro molecules in which the terminal adenosine was replaced by 2′- or 3′-deoxyadenosine were used as substrates for the M. jannaschii ProRS to identify the site of attachment of the amino acid in Pro-tRNAPro and Cys-tRNAPro. The results (Fig.3) show that both for aminoacylation with proline (Fig. 3 A) and with cysteine (Fig. 3 B), the tRNAPro transcript with the 2′-deoxyA at the 3′-end is a better substrate than the transcript with the 3′-deoxyA. Thus, the site of attachment of the amino acid is primarily the 3′-hydroxyl group. There is also amino attachment on the 2′-hydroxyl group, in line with the earlier data on E. coli ProRS (20Sprinzl M. Cramer F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1975; 72: 3049-3053Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 21Fraser T.H. Rich A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1975; 72: 3044-3048Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 22Hecht S.M. Chinault A.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1976; 73: 405-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). This conclusion agrees with the fact that class II aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases transfer the amino acid onto the 3′-hydroxyl group of the terminal adenosine of tRNA, whereas the class I enzymes transfer it to the 2′-hydroxyl group (25Eriani G. Delarue M. Poch O. Gangloff J. Moras D. Nature. 1990; 347: 203-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (1175) Google Scholar, 26Cusack S. Berthet-Colominas C. Härtlein M. Nassar N. Leberman R. Nature. 1990; 347: 249-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (560) Google Scholar). Because M. jannaschii ProRS synthesizes Cys-tRNAPro and because misaminoacylation of tRNAPro with cysteine in vitro appears to be a general feature of ProRSs (43Ahel I. Stathopoulos C. Ambrogelly A. Sauerwald A. Toogood H. Hartsch T. Söll D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 34743-34748Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), it was of interest to investigate the recognition of cysteine analogues by the enzyme. Two complementary methods were used. First, the ability of non-radioactive cysteine analogues to inhibit Cys-tRNAProformation was evaluated. As seen in TableI, compounds with an altered carboxyl group (cysteamine, l-cysteine methyl ester, andl-cysteine ethyl ester) inhibited aminoacylation. In contrast, oxidation or reduction of the sulfhydryl group yielded compounds (l-sulfinic acid, l-cysteic acid, andS-methyl-l-cysteine), which did not inhibit aminoacylation. N-Acetyl-l-cysteine,d-cysteine, and dl-homocysteine were also found to be inhibitors. Second, the question of whether the inhibitors could be activated by M. jannaschii ProRS was investigated (Fig. 4). It was found thatd-cysteine and dl-homocysteine were substrates in the ATP-PPi exchange reaction. These results suggest that the sulfhydryl group and to a lesser extent the α-amino group of cysteine are recognized by M. jannaschii ProRS. E. coli CysRS, co-crystallized with cysteine, shows a clear interaction of the amino group with the enzyme and the −SH group with a protein-bound zinc atom (5Newberry K.J. Hou Y.M. Perona J.J. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 2778-2787Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar).Table IInhibition of Cys-tRNAPro formation by cysteine analogueaSee “Experimental Procedures” for conditions.CompoundInhibition%Cysteamine70l-cysteine methyl ester60l-cysteine ethyl ester60d-cysteine50d,l-homocysteine45N-acetyl l-cysteine25l-sulfinic acid0l-cysteic acid0S-methyl l-cysteine0Homocysteine thiolactone0a See “Experimental Procedures” for conditions. Open table in a new tab Editing of the misacylated Ala-tRNAPro byE. coli ProRS was shown to be highly efficient and ascribed to the existence of an insertion domain in the bacterial-type ProRSs compared with the archaeal ProRS (27Wong F-C. Beuning P.J. Nagan M. Shiba K. Musier-Forsyth K. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 7108-7115Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The archaeal type ProRS does not contain this insertion sequence but has an extension at the carboxyl terminus. Thus, the latter region could be a possible editing domain. Hydrolysis of a mutant Ala-tRNAPro by M. jannaschii ProRS, although not as efficient as by the bacterial ProRS, was recently reported (23Beuning P.J. Musier-Forsyth K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30779-30785Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Because this editing function might be extended to the hydrolysis of other mischarged tRNAs, we investigated whether the deletion of the carboxyl terminus of M. jannaschii ProRS would affect either the formation or the hydrolysis of Cys-tRNAPro and Ala-tRNAPro. We reasoned that the deletion of a possible editing domain would lead to an increased mischarging of cysteine and alanine onto unfractionatedM. jannaschii tRNA. First, we checked the ability of the M. jannaschiiProRSΔ50 enzyme (lacking the 50 carboxyl-terminal amino acids) to charge proline, cysteine, or alanine onto M. jannaschiitRNAPro. There was no difference between the wild-type and the truncated ProRS in an initial velocity of aminoacylation for proline, although the mutant enzyme was less active for cysteine (∼3-fold) and alanine (∼10-fold) (Fig.5). Second, we checked the editing activity of the wild-type ProRS or the ProRSΔ50 enzyme toward Cys-tRNAPro (Fig.6 A) or Ala-tRNAPro(Fig. 6 B) in post-transfer editing experiments. There was no measurable deacylation of either of the substrates. Thus, under our experimental conditions, we could not show in M. jannaschiiProRS an editing mechanism for mature Cys-tRNAPro or Ala-tRNAPro. Whether the difference between our results and those of Beuning and Musier-Forsyth (23Beuning P.J. Musier-Forsyth K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30779-30785Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) is because of their use of a mutant Ala-tRNAPro for the deacylation experiments is not known.Figure 6Deacylation of mischarged Cys-tRNAPro and Ala-tRNAPro.

The positive control was carried out with 1.2 N NaOH (▴) in place of enzyme.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Based on the nature of the final aminoacyl-tRNA products, aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases may be divided into three groups. The first group, which comprises the majority of these enzymes, attaches the cognate amino acid to the cognate set of isoacceptor RNAs. These enzymes correct any misactivation of the amino acid or any misacylation (mischarging) of the tRNA by pre-transfer and/or post-transfer editing mechanisms (28Jakubowski H. Goldman E. Microbiol. Rev. 1992; 56: 412-429Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Another group consisting of the non-discriminating aspartyl-, glutamyl-, and seryl-tRNA synthetases recognizes the cognate amino acid yet charges it onto two different sets of tRNAs. These non-discriminating AspRS and GluRS enzymes provide the crucial first step, the production of mischarged tRNA, in the transamidation pathway that leads to formation of Asn-tRNA and Gln-tRNA (29Tumbula D.L. Becker H.D. Chang W.Z. Söll D. Nature. 2000; 407: 106-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 30Curnow A.W. Ibba M. Söll D. Nature. 1996; 382: 589-590Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). SerRS similarly is involved in the formation of selenocysteinyl-tRNA (31Commans S. Böck A. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 1999; 23: 335-351Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Lastly, the archaeal ProRS described in this study may belong to a third type as it charges two canonical amino acids onto the same set of tRNAs, generating a correctly charged and a mischarged aminoacyl-tRNA. Mutant aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases with a compromised editing function (a valyl-tRNA synthetase forming Cys-tRNAVal and a leucyl-tRNA synthetase forming Ile-tRNALeu and Met-tRNALeu) are known to do the same (32Döring V. Mootz H.D. Nangle L.A. Hendrickson T.L. de Crécy-Lagard V. Schimmel P. Marlière P. Science. 2001; 292: 501-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 33Chen J.F. Guo N.N., Li, T. Wang E.D. Wang Y.L. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 6726-6731Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 34Mursinna R.S. Martinis S.A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2002; 124: 7286-7287Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) and may also be placed in the third group. How does the archaeal prolyl-tRNA synthetase recognize two canonical amino acids? Cysteine is well recognized by the M. jannaschii ProRS, which is significantly more mischarging than the ProRS enzymes of many other organisms (43Ahel I. Stathopoulos C. Ambrogelly A. Sauerwald A. Toogood H. Hartsch T. Söll D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 34743-34748Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Earlier biochemical experiments showed that in M. jannaschii ProRS, the binding sites for proline and cysteine are overlapping in that the mutation of amino acid 100 greatly affected CysRS activity, whereas the mutation of amino acid 103 greatly affected ProRS activity (8Stathopoulos C. Jacquin-Becker C. Becker H.D., Li, T. Ambrogelly A. Longman R. Söll D. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 46-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The crystal structure of M. jannaschii ProRS is consistent with this conclusion and shows that the proline binding pocket of this enzyme readily accommodates cysteine. 2S. Kamtekar, D. Kennedy, and T. Steitz, personal communication. Further support is derived from suggestions based on a modeling experiment that the archaeal-type T. thermophilus ProRS could also bind cysteine (35Yaremchuk A. Tukalo M. Grøtli M. Cusack S. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 309: 989-1002Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Proline and cysteine have similar molecular volumes, although they have different shapes. This particular feature may explain the lack of specificity of M. jannaschii ProRS for the two amino acids. Also, these two amino acids may be too similar to be distinguished by a double sieve editing mechanism (36Fersht A.R. Dingwall C. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 2627-2631Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). CysRS also must face the challenge of discriminating proline. The crystal structure ofE. coli CysRS (5Newberry K.J. Hou Y.M. Perona J.J. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 2778-2787Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) shows that this enzyme has developed a different strategy to ensure accuracy of aminoacylation. The enzyme selects cysteine specifically by coordination of the sulfhydryl group with a zinc atom. As this mechanism ensures better specificity, the enzyme can dispense with an editing domain (5Newberry K.J. Hou Y.M. Perona J.J. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 2778-2787Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). A metal ion (Zn2+)-based mechanism is also used by threonyl-tRNA synthetase to discriminate against the isosteric valine (37Dock-Bregeon A. Sankaranarayanan R. Romby P. Caillet J. Springer M. Rees B. Francklyn C.S. Ehresmann C. Moras D. Cell. 2000; 103: 877-884Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). An alternative mechanism to increase discrimination for the cognate amino acid in aminoacylation of tRNAPro was suggested forT. thermophilus ProRS (38Yaremchuk A. Cusack S. Tukalo M. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4745-4758Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Based on the crystal structures of T. thermophilus ProRS complexed with tRNAPro, proline, ATP, and prolyl-adenylate, it was proposed that the binding and activation of proline triggers structural changes in the active site that promote the correct binding of the 3′-end of tRNAPro at the active site. Such an induced fit mechanism in which binding or activation of the cognate amino acid results in the enzyme adopting a fully ordered active site conformation necessary for aminoacylation also seems to be used by some other class IIa enzymes,e.g. E. coli histidyl-tRNA synthetase (39Bovee M.L. Yan W. Sproat B.S. Francklyn C.S. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 13725-13735Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). InT. thermophilus ProRS, Ala-206 is one of the amino acids in the “proline binding loop” close to the active site, which undergoes rearrangement upon the activation of proline. This rearrangement results in the formation of a hydrogen bond between the main chain of Ala-206 and His-83 in the “ordering loop.” The replacement of Ala-206 by proline in the archaeal ProRSs may explain the much poorer discrimination observed in the archaeal enzymes. Our unexpected finding that M. jannaschii ProRS misaminoacylates native tRNAPro with cysteine in vitro raises the question of whether this also occurs in vivo and, if so, whether any Cys-tRNAPro that is formed is edited. Because proline and cysteine inhibit the aminoacylation of tRNA with each other by ProRS (6Stathopoulos C., Li, T. Longman R. Vothknecht U.C. Becker H. Ibba M. Söll D. Science. 2000; 287: 479-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), the relative affinity of these amino acids for ProRS, their intracellular concentrations, their rates of aminoacyl adenylate formation, and rates of aminoacylation of tRNAs will all be important determinants for the relative amounts of Pro-tRNAPro and Cys-tRNAProformed in vivo. In vitro studies with theM. jannaschii ProRS indicate thatk cat/K m in proline activation is 107-fold higher than in cysteine activation (43Ahel I. Stathopoulos C. Ambrogelly A. Sauerwald A. Toogood H. Hartsch T. Söll D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 34743-34748Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Unfortunately, no data are available on the intracellular concentration of these amino acids in M. jannaschii (or in any other prokaryote). However, it is known for enzymes in glycolysis that the physiological substrate concentrations are generally lower than theK m values for these substrates presumably to maximize reaction rates (40Fersht A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10869-10873Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar). Assuming that the same applies to aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases, a consideration of theK m values of ProRS and CysRS of the archaeonM. maripaludis could provide an indication of the intracellular levels of proline and cysteine. The ProRS of this organism, similar to that of M. jannaschii, is known to catalyze the synthesis of Cys-tRNAPro in vitro (data not shown). The enzyme has a K m for proline of 4.6 μm, whereas that for cysteine is 74.5 μm (17Stathopoulos C. Kim W., Li, T. Anderson I. Deutsch B. Palioura S. Whitman W. Söll D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 14292-14297Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Based on theseK m values, it is logical to assume that the cysteine concentration should be at least 15 times as high as that of proline for Cys-tRNAPro synthesis to compete efficiently with Pro-tRNAPro synthesis. However, the K mvalue of M. maripaludis CysRS for cysteine (9.7 μm) suggests that the concentration of free cysteine would only be twice as high as that of proline. Thus, it is plausible that appropriate intracellular levels of proline and cysteine will minimize the mischarging of tRNAPro with cysteine without recourse to editing. Finally, our finding that the recombinant M. jannaschiiProRS is unable to aminoacylate tRNACys in vitrowith cysteine reopens the question of how Cys-tRNACys is synthesized in M. jannaschii. Much of the recent work with this enzyme including that described in this paper has been carried out with the recombinant ProRS made in E. coli. The possibility that ProRS isolated from M. jannaschii contains a certain modification(s) that allows it to aminoacylate tRNACys with cysteine cannot, therefore, be ruled out. Alternatively, other RNA and/or protein factors along withM. jannaschii ProRS may be involved in the formation of Cys-tRNACys (7Lipman R.S. Sowers K.R. Hou Y.M. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 7792-7798Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Attempts in identifying such components by rescue of an E. coli cysS knock-out strain have not been successful. 3B. Ruan and H. Nakano, unpublished results. Additional possibility is a recently described M. jannaschii protein that has the ability to aminoacylate tRNA with cysteine (41Fabrega C. Farrow M.A. Mukhopadhyay B. de Crécy-Lagard V. Ortiz A.R. Schimmel P. Nature. 2001; 411: 110-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) or an unusual CysRS, which still remains to be discovered. In view of the finding in this paper that M. jannaschii ProRS can misaminoacylate tRNAPro with cysteine, assays for CysRS activity in vitro must now go beyond relying on the incorporation of radioactive cysteine into unfractionated tRNA. Such assays will have to ensure that cysteine is being incorporated into tRNACys and not into other tRNAs. This will require the use of either purified M. jannaschii tRNACys or, as described in here and elsewhere (42Kowal A.K. Köhrer C. RajBhandary U.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 2268-2273Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), acid urea gel electrophoresis followed by Northern blot hybridization to identify the tRNA that is aminoacylated. We thank M.

A MHC-PKC-GFP expression plasmid was constructed as follows. A 1.8-kb fragment of MHC-PKC was isolated from pBluescript-MHC-PKC (12Abu-Elneel K. Karchi M. Ravid S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 977-984Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) by digestion withBglII-BamHI and cloned into pDXA-Hy (21Manstein D.J. Schuster H.P. Morandini P. Hunt D.M. Gene (Amst.). 1995; 162: 129-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar) to create pDXA-MHC-PKC. To isolate the GFP, the plasmid pGFP10.1 containing the GFP cDNA (22Chalfie M., Tu, Y. Euskirchen G. Ward W.W. Prasher D.C. Science. 1994; 263: 802-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (5409) Google Scholar) was digested with BamHI and cloned in frame in front of the MHC-PKC to create the expression vector pDXA-MHC-PKC-GFP. The pDXA-C1-GFP expression plasmid was created by restricting the pDXA-MHC-PKC-GFP withBsaBI and rendered blunt. This was followed by restriction with XhoI, resulting in the deletion of a 1.4-kb fragment from the 3 prime. The expression plasmid was then ligated resulting in GFP fused in frame to a 0.4-kb fragment from the 5 prime of MHC-PKC encoding the C1 domain. The expression plasmid pDXA-MHC-PKCΔC1-GFP was created by restriction of pDXA-MHC-PKC-GFP with BsaBI, and EcoRI rendered it blunt. This plasmid was ligated. The restriction resulted in the deletion of the C1 domain. Dictyosteliumcells were grown in HL-5 medium (23Spudich J.A. Methods Cell Biol. 1987; 28: 3-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar), supplemented with 60 units of penicillin and 60 μg of streptomycin/ml at 21 °C. Transformations were performed using the calcium phosphate procedure as described previously (24Egelhoff T.T. Titus M.A. Manstein D.J. Ruppel K.M. Spudich J.A. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 196: 319-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The mhc-pkc null cells were transformed with either pDXA-MHC-PKC-GFP, pDXA-C1-GFP, or pDXA-MHC-PKCΔC1-GFP to create mhc-pkc-gfp, c1-gfp, andΔc1-gfp cell lines respectively. The myosin IInull cell line HS1 (25Ruppel K.M. Uyeda T.Q.P. Spudich J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18773-18780Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was transformed with pBigGFPmyo to createmyosin II-gfp cells (26Moores S.L. Sabry J.H. Spudich J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 443-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Transformed cells were selected and grown in the presence of G418 at 5 μg/ml (Geneticin, Invitrogen). Amoeba of Dictyostelium discoideum strains were grown in HL-5 medium (23Spudich J.A. Methods Cell Biol. 1987; 28: 3-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar), harvested at a density of 2 × 106 cells/ml, washed twice in MES buffer (20 mm MES, pH 6.8, 0.2 mmCaCl2, 2 mm MgSO4), and resuspended in MES buffer at a density of 2 × 107 cells/ml. Cells were shaken at 100 rpm at 22 °C for 3.5 h. 5 mmcaffeine was added to the suspension 30 min prior to the addition of cAMP. Cells were developed for 4 h as described above, washed in 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) and 150 mm KCl, and lysed in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 20 mm sodium pyrophosphate (pH 6.8), 5 mm EDTA, 5 mm EGTA, 0.5% Triton X-100, and protease inhibitor mix (Sigma). Protein concentration was determined by the method of Peterson (27Peterson G. Anal. Biochem. 1977; 83: 346-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (7066) Google Scholar), and the lysates were electrophoresed on SDS-PAGE (28Laemmli U. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205523) Google Scholar). Western blots were probed with MHC-PKC polyclonal antibody (11Ravid S. Spudich J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5877-5881Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) or with GFP antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.). The blots were developed using a horseradish peroxidase-coupled secondary antibody (Bio-Rad). ECL was performed using a kit from Amersham Biosciences. 4-h developed Dictyostelium amoebae expressing MHC-PKC-GFP, C1-GFP, ΔC1-GFP, or myosin II-GFP (26Moores S.L. Sabry J.H. Spudich J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 443-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar) were placed on a coverslip mounted on a Zigmod chamber (29Zigmond S.H. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 162: 65-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), in which one well was filled with MES buffer and the other with MES buffer containing 1 μm cAMP. After waiting 10 min to allow development of a gradient, the cells were observed with a Zeiss Axiovert microscope using a Planapochromat 100y1.4 objective and a basement port connected to a cooled charge-coupled device (CCD) camera. Images were taken every 5 s with the shutter set at a 20-ms exposure with a 100-watt mercury lamp attenuated by a 50% neutral density filter to prevent light-induced damage to the cells. Images were collected and analyzed with Image-Pro Plus (Media Cybernetics, Silver Spring, MD). To define the spatiotemporal dynamics of MHC-PKC that may lead to cell polarization and directed movement we expressed GFP-tagged MHC-PKC (MHC-PKC-GFP; Fig. 1) inmhc-pkc null cells (12Abu-Elneel K. Karchi M. Ravid S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 977-984Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). MHC-PKC-GFP rescued allmhc-pkc null cell defects. mhc-pkc null cells exhibit substantial myosin II overassembly in vivo, as well as aberrant cell polarization, chemotaxis, and morphological differentiation (12Abu-Elneel K. Karchi M. Ravid S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 977-984Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). However, expression of MHC-PKC-GFP resulted in cells showing similar chemotaxis and differentiation properties to wild-type cells (data not shown). These results indicate that tagging the MHC-PKC with GFP did not affect its properties. To study the localization properties of MHC-PKC during chemotaxis toward cAMP, mhc-pkc-gfp cells were subjected to a cAMP gradient using a Zigmond chamber (29Zigmond S.H. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 162: 65-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The chemotactic response ofmhc-pkc-gfp cells was observed at 5-s intervals 10 min after placing the coverslip containing cells in the chamber (Fig.2). Cells freshly placed in the chamber (time, 0 s) were round, and the MHC-PKC-GFP was distributed evenly throughout the cytoplasm. As time progressed the cell sent lamellipodia toward the region of high cAMP concentration and became polarized. The localization of MHC-PKC was also altered together with the changes in cell morphology. In a cell first subjected to a cAMP gradient, the MHC-PKC-GFP was distributed evenly throughout the cytoplasm (Fig. 2, 0–20 s), but after 25–30 s it was concentrated at the leading edge of the cell. These results indicate that a cell moving up a cAMP gradient achieves cell polarization as well as polarization of MHC-PKC. To study the localization properties of myosin II in chemotaxing cells, we expressed myosin II-GFP in myosin II null cells (Fig. 1). Moores et al. (26Moores S.L. Sabry J.H. Spudich J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 443-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar) have shown that purified myosin II-GFP protein displays wild-type myosin II properties in vitro. Furthermore, expression of myosin II-GFP fully complements the myosin II null cell phenotype. To follow myosin II dynamics, myosin II-gfp cells were subjected to a cAMP gradient similar to that described above. As shown in Fig. 3, 30 s after exposing the cell to the cAMP gradient, the cell became polarized sending out lamellipodia along with thin filopodia toward the region of high cAMP concentration. At the same time most of the myosin II-GFP became localized to the posterior part of the cell. These results indicate that, in a cAMP gradient, Dictyosteliumcells send their MHC-PKC-GFP and myosin II-GFP to opposite ends of the cell. These findings are consistent with experiments in polarizedDictyostelium cells in which immunofluorescent stained myosin II was found to be localized at the posterior part of the cell (30Yumura S. Fukui Y. Nature. 1985; 314: 194-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar, 31Nachmias V.T. Fukui Y. Spudich J.A. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1989; 13: 158-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 32Chu Q. Fukui Y. Cell. Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1996; 35: 254-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Expression of C1 from mammalian PKC results in translocation of this domain to the cell membrane (33Oancea E. Meyer T. Cell. 1998; 95: 307-318Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (544) Google Scholar). This observation together with biochemical evidence indicates that PKC binds to the cell membrane through its C1 domain (for reviews see Refs. 34Kikkawa U. Kishimoto A. Nishizuka Y. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1989; 58: 31-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (580) Google Scholar and 35Nakamura S.-i. Nishizuka Y. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1994; 115: 1029-1034Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). To define the MHC-PKC domain responsible here for binding MHC-PKC to the cell membrane and thus enabling it to concentrate at the anterior part of chemotaxing cells, we expressed two MHC-PKC truncation proteins tagged with GFP in mhc-pkc null cells. The first protein was the C1 domain of MHC-PKC, and the second was MHC-PKC in which the C1 domain had been deleted (ΔC1-GFP) (Fig. 1). Both cell lines were subjected to a cAMP gradient in the Zigmond chamber (29Zigmond S.H. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 162: 65-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) as described above. In contrast to MHC-PKC-GFP, which at first appeared diffusely distributed throughout the cytoplasm and then gradually concentrated at the leading edge of the cell (Fig. 2), the C1-GFP appeared as small spherical aggregates that concentrated at the cell region facing the cAMP high concentration (Fig. 4). These results suggest that similar to mammalian PKC, MHC-PKC binds to the cell membrane through its C1 domain. The ability of C1 domain to localize to the cell leading edge indicates that C1 domain possessed the information required for the localization of MHC-PKC to this region in a cAMP gradient. Even though C1 domain localized to the cell leading edge, the c1-gfp cells did not undergo cell polarization or chemotaxis; this may be because of the absence of MHC-PKC catalytic domain that is required for cell polarization and chemotaxis (12Abu-Elneel K. Karchi M. Ravid S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 977-984Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Deletion of the C1 domain (i.e. ΔC1-GFP) also resulted in spherically shaped proteins, but in contrast to C1-GFP, the ΔC1-G distributed evenly throughout the cytoplasm regardless of cAMP stimulation (Fig. 5). These results further indicate that MHC-PKC concentrates at the cell membrane in response to cAMP stimulation using its C1 domain, and when the C1 domain is absent, the protein remains in the cytoplasm. Similar toc1-gfp cells, Δc1-gfp cells did not undergo cell polarization and chemotaxis; this can be because of the absence of C1 that is required for MHC-PKC binding to the cell membrane, a step necessary for MHC-PKC activation (36Dembinsky A. Rubin H. Ravid S. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 911-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The appearance of C1-GFP and ΔC1-GFP in aggregates may be because of the expression of truncated MHC-PKC proteins. The results described above indicate that exposure ofDictyostelium cells to the cAMP gradient results in cell polarization and localization of MHC-PKC and myosin II to opposite sites of the cell. Furthermore, the MHC-PKC C1 domain is required for the localization of MHC-PKC to the cell leading edge of chemotaxing cell; however the C1 protein is not sufficient for cell polarization and chemotaxis. These results fit with our previous observations in which we biochemically followed the localization and activation of MHC-PKC and of myosin II stimulated with cAMP (36Dembinsky A. Rubin H. Ravid S. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 911-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Based both on these previous results and the current results, we suggest the following model for the involvement of MHC-PKC and myosin II in cell polarization and chemotaxis. The unstimulated cell is rounder in shape because of a contractile shell formed by an actin-myosin II network in the cortex. This network presumably inhibits events necessary for pseudopodial projection. cAMP stimulation of one edge of the cell results in activation of the cytosolic MHC-PKC, causing it to translocate to the membrane. Here it concentrates in an active form at the site of cAMP stimulation (i.e. the cell's leading edge). Active MHC-PKC phosphorylates the cortical MHC at the anterior part of the cell, causing disassembly of myosin II thick filaments. The disassembled myosin II molecules reassemble at the posterior part of the cell, thus providing a force that moves the cell forward. We thank Dr. J. A. Spudich for providing GFP-myosin II expression vector and Dictyostelium myosin IInull cells."

However, the interference by Earth's magnetic field causes rapid decay of the signal within a few milliseconds for protons and is detrimental to this method. Here we describe a technique to suppress the effects of Earth's field by using adiabatic rotations and sudden switching of the applied fields. We observed hundreds of spin echo signals lasting for more than 600 milliseconds and accurately measured the relaxation times of a liquid sample."

When a preparation of native SR vesicles is used, the free energy released from AcP hydrolysis may be partially coupled to the formation of a Ca2+ gradient (1de Meis L. J. Biol. Chem. 1969; 244: 3733-3739Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 2de Meis L. Hasselbach W. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 4759-4763Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 3Pucell A. Martonosi A. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 3389-3397Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Such AcP hydrolysis leads to the steady accumulation of an acid-resistant, hydroxylamine-sensitive EP, as occurs with ATP (4Friedman Z. Makinose M. FEBS Lett. 1970; 11: 69-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Other substrates bearing a carboxyl-phosphate anhydride bond such as succinyl phosphate, benzoyl phosphate, carbamyl phosphate (5Liguri G. Stefani M. Berti A. Nassi P. Ramponi G. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1980; 200: 357-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar), and furylacryloyl phosphate (6Inesi G. Kurzmack M. Nakamoto R. de Meis L. Bernhard S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 6040-6043Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) can be used by the SR Ca2+-ATPase to elicit active Ca2+transport. Nonetheless, the behavior of AcP as an energy donor substrate is uneven. Other cation-transporting ATPases, such as H+,K+-ATPase from gastric mucosa (7Asano S. Kamiya S. Takeguchi N. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 6590-6595Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or H+-ATPase from yeast plasma membrane (8Wang G. Perlin D.S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1977; 344: 309-315Crossref Scopus (7) Google Scholar), are unable to maintain active transport during AcP hydrolysis. This observation has suggested that P-type ATPases do not share the same energy coupling mechanism (7Asano S. Kamiya S. Takeguchi N. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 6590-6595Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The coupled reaction cycle of SR Ca2+-ATPase, as it is usually described (9de Meis L. Vianna A.L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1979; 48: 275-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar), involves the participation of phosphorylated and nonphosphorylated enzyme conformations with or without bound Ca2+. In fact, conversion of the Ca2+-bound phosphorylated conformation into the Ca2+-free nonphosphorylated conformation and vice versa is the key element in guaranteeing the optimal Ca2+/Picoupling of 2. It is also known that SR Ca2+-ATPase displays hydrolytic activity on different phosphorylating substrates both in the presence and absence of Ca2+ (10Carvalho-Alves P.C. Scofano H.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 6610-6614Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Chini E.N. Montero-Lomeli M. de Meis L. Biochim. Biophys.

The existence of a Ca2+-independent activity confirms that the catalytic route may occur exclusively through Ca2+-free enzyme conformations. It is self-evident that any hydrolysis occurring through Ca2+-free conformations will produce uncoupling. Likewise, it has been shown that an alternative pathway of intramolecular uncoupling may occur through Ca2+-bound conformations when phosphorylating substrates, such as ATP (14Yu X. Inesi G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4361-4367Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), UTP (15Fortea M.I. Soler F. Fernandez-Belda F. J. Biol.

Uncoupled reaction cycles of the SR Ca2+-ATPase have been interpreted as a physiological mechanism of heat production in skeletal muscle fibers (16Lowell B.B. Spiegelman B.M.

The present study addresses the characterization of hydrolytic activities using AcP as a representative phosphorylating agent bearing a carboxyl-phosphate bond. The steady-state distribution of enzyme conformations with or without bound Ca2+ during AcP hydrolysis was evaluated with the aid of the reagents TG, vanadate, and Me2SO. The experimental evidence was completed by assessing whether or not the hydrolytic mechanism included the steady accumulation of EP. This work sheds light on the catalytic and energy transduction mechanism and provides evidence for alternative pathways of substrate utilization by the SR Ca2+-ATPase. [45Ca]CaCl2 was a product of PerkinElmer Life Sciences, and potassium [32P]phosphate was from Amersham Biosciences. The Ca2+ standard solution Titrisol was obtained from Merck. TG was purchased from Molecular Probes Europe, Leiden, The Netherlands. Stock solutions of TG were prepared in Me2SO. Solutions of 1 mm orthovanadate were prepared by dissolving ammonium metavanadate in ultrapure water (Milli-Q grade) adjusted to pH 10.0 with NaOH. The absence of a yellow/orange color confirmed the absence of decavanadate and the presence of monovanadate species (18Hua S. Fabris D. Inesi G. Biophys. J. 1999; 77: 2217-2225Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). AcP (A 0262), Me2SO (D 8779), deoxycholate (D 4297), and other reagents of analytical grade were obtained from Sigma. Nitrocellulose filter units (HA type) with a 0.45-μm pore diameter from Millipore and a Hoefer filtration box from Amersham Biosciences were used to evaluate Ca2+ transport and EP level. A microsomal fraction of sealed vesicles enriched in Ca2+-ATPase was obtained from homogenized rabbit skeletal muscle as described by Eletr and Inesi (19Eletr S. Inesi G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1972; 282: 174-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). The Ca2+-ATPase protein was purified from SR vesicles by partial solubilization with deoxycholate, according to method 2 of Meissner et al. (20Meissner G. Conner G.E. Fleischer S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1973; 298: 246-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). Isolated samples were aliquoted and stored at −80 °C until use. One mg of SR protein contains ∼4 nmol of active enzyme, as deduced from the maximal EP level after addition of ATP plus Ca2+; therefore, 0.4 mg/ml is equivalent to 1.6 μm Ca2+-ATPase. Initial rates of AcP hydrolysis were measured at 25 °C, according to Lipmann and Tuttle (21Lipmann F. Tuttle L. J. Biol. Chem. 1945; 159: 21-28Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). The colorimetric procedure is based on the evaluation of acetohydroxamic acid as a function of time, which is a measurement of unhydrolyzed AcP. When the enzyme activity was measured at neutral pH and in the presence of 50 μm free Ca2+, the reaction medium consisted of 20 mm Mops, pH 7.0, 80 mm KCl, 20 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 1.04 mm CaCl2, 5 mm potassium oxalate, 0.4 mg of SR/ml, and 10 mm AcP. Alternatively, the reaction was measured at acidic pH using 20 mm Mes, pH 6.0, as a buffer and decreasing the CaCl2 concentration to 0.608 mm or under alkaline conditions by including 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and 1.05 mmCaCl2. Oxalate and CaCl2 were not added when the experiments were performed in the absence of Ca2+. Other conditions were as described in the corresponding figure legends. AcP hydrolysis in the presence or absence of Ca2+ was also measured using samples of purified enzyme. In this case, the protein concentration was 0.2 mg/ml, and oxalate was not present. Initial rates of Ca2+ transport were measured at 25 °C with the aid of the radioactive tracer 45Ca2+ (22Martonosi A. Feretos R. J. Biol. Chem. 1964; 239: 648-658Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The standard reaction medium contained 20 mm Mops, pH 7.0, 80 mm KCl, 20 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 1.04 mm[45Ca]CaCl2 (∼1,500 cpm/nmol), 5 mm potassium oxalate, 0.4 mg of SR/ml, and 10 mm AcP. Aliquots of 0.2-ml reaction mixture (0.08 mg of protein) were manually filtered under vacuum at different time intervals. Filters containing the 45Ca2+-loaded vesicles were rinsed with 10 ml of ice-cold medium consisting of 20 mm Mops, pH 7.0, and 1 mm LaCl3. The radioactivity retained in the filters was measured by liquid scintillation counting. [32P]AcP was prepared from potassium [32P]phosphate and acetic anhydride in a pyridine medium as described by Kornberg et al. (23Kornberg A. Kornberg S.R. Simms E.S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1956; 20: 215-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). The reaction medium consisted of 0.25-ml aliquots containing 50 μm free Ca2+ (20 mmMops, pH 7.0, 80 mm KCl, 20 mmMgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 1.04 mmCaCl2, 5 mm potassium oxalate, and 0.4 mg of SR/ml) or a Ca2+-free medium (20 mm Mops, pH 7.0, 80 mm KCl, 20 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, and 0.4 mg of SR/ml). Phosphorylation at 25 °C was initiated by adding 2 mm [32P]AcP (∼50,000 cpm/nmol) and allowed to proceed for 30 s when the experiments were performed in the presence of Ca2+ or for 1 min when a Ca2+-free medium was used. The reaction was stopped by adding 5 ml of ice-cold quenching solution containing 125 mm perchloric acid and 2 mm sodium phosphate. Denatured samples were kept in an ice-water bath for 5 min before manual filtration under vacuum. Filters were extensively rinsed with 50 ml of ice-cold quenching solution and then solubilized and counted by the liquid scintillation technique. The initial reaction medium was supplemented with certain reagents when indicated. A blank assay was performed by adding quenching solution to the sample aliquot before radioactive AcP. Protein concentration was measured by the procedure of Lowry et al. (24Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin as standard. Free Ca2+ was adjusted by the addition of CaCl2 and EGTA stock solutions, as calculated by computation (25Fabiato A. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 157: 378-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (977) Google Scholar). The computer program used the Ca2+-EGTA absolute stability constant (26Schwartzenbach G. Senn H. Anderegg G. Helv. Chim. Acta. 1957; 40: 1886-2000Crossref Scopus (216) Google Scholar), the H4+-EGTA dissociation constants (27Blinks J. Wier W. Hess P. Prendergast F. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 1982; 40: 1-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar), and the presence of relevant electrolytes in the medium. For the purpose of this study, the terms absence of Ca2+, Ca2+-independent, or Ca2+-free refer to a low free Ca2+ concentration that is insufficient to activate the enzyme. The plotted mean values correspond to at least three independent assays, each performed in duplicate. The standard errors (plus or minus) are also included. Curve fitting was carried out with the SigmaPlot Graph System from Jandel Scientific. The effect of AcP concentration on the hydrolysis rate was initially measured in the presence and in the absence of Ca2+. The experimental conditions included native SR vesicles in a buffered medium at neutral pH and the presence of 80 mm K+ and 20 mm Mg2+. Free Ca2+ was adjusted to 50 μm to measure the Ca2+-dependent rate or decreased below the nm range to evaluate the Ca2+-independent component. Oxalate was included in measurements of Ca2+-dependent activity. A hyperbolic dependence was observed when the hydrolysis rate was plotted as a function of AcP concentration (Fig. 1). The maximal rate calculated from curve fitting was 277 nmol of Pi/min/mg of protein in the presence of Ca2+and 138 nmol of Pi/min/mg of protein in the absence of Ca2+. The K m value for AcP was 5 mm both in the presence and absence of Ca2+, confirming its nature as a low affinity substrate (28Bodley A.L. Jencks W.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 13997-14004Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The AcP hydrolysis rate was also measured at different pH values. The Ca2+-dependent activity in SR vesicles increased as pH rose from 6.0 to 7.0 and was very similar at pH 7.0 and 8.0, whereas the Ca2+-independent activity showed lower values and was less sensitive to the H+ concentration (Fig.2 A). When a purified enzyme preparation was used, the pH dependence of the hydrolytic rate measured in the presence or absence of Ca2+ displayed similar behavior (Fig. 2 B). Measurements of Ca2+transport sustained by 10 mm AcP indicated that the transport rate was higher at neutral pH since it decreased as the pH was lowered to 6.0 or raised to 8.0. Taking into account the corresponding data on hydrolysis in the presence of Ca2+, a coupling ratio of 0.57 at neutral pH can be derived. The coupling decreased to 0.31 at pH 6.0 and was close to zero at pH 8.0 (Fig.2 C). The hydrolytic rate in the presence of AcP can be analyzed with the aid of certain reagents. Thus, the sensitivity to TG was studied by measuring enzyme activity at 25 °C and neutral pH using 10 mm AcP as substrate. The Ca2+-dependent activity was evaluated in the presence of 50 μm free Ca2+ and 5 mm oxalate, whereas the Ca2+-independent activity was assayed in the absence of both Ca2+ and oxalate. Fig. 3 A shows that TG produced a concentration-dependent inhibition when the measurements were carried out in a Ca2+-containing medium. The hydrolytic activity decreased from 230 nmol of Pi/min/mg of protein in the absence of TG to 110 nmol of Pi/min/mg of protein when the TG/enzyme molar ratio was ≥1. In contrast, the Ca2+-independent activity amounted to ∼110 nmol of Pi/min/mg of protein and was insensitive to TG even when the inhibitor concentration was raised to 6.4 μm, i.e. when the ratio mol of TG/mol of Ca2+-ATPase was 4. The sensitivity to vanadate was also analyzed using the same approach. The inhibition of the Ca2+-independent activity by vanadate was consistent with the existence of a single enzyme population, being completely inhibited by ∼10 μm vanadate (Fig.3 B). However, enzyme activity in the presence of 50 μm free Ca2+ displayed a biphasic pattern. A first component, corresponding to 30%, was highly sensitive to vanadate whereas a second component, amounting to 70%, corresponded to a fraction more resistant to inhibition (Fig. 3 B). Interestingly, when the Ca2+-containing medium was supplemented with equimolar TG, i.e. when TG was 1.6 μm and the SR protein was 0.4 mg/ml, the biphasic dependence became monophasic, and the inhibitory profile in the presence of Ca2+ coincided with that observed in the absence of Ca2+. Ca2+-dependent and Ca2+-independent activities displayed different patterns when assayed in the presence of Me2SO. The Ca2+-independent activity measured at neutral pH and in the presence of 10 mm AcP was linearly activated from 110 to 270 nmol of Pi/min/mg of protein when the Me2SO concentration was raised from 0 to 30% (v/v) (Fig. 4 A). In contrast, the enzyme activity in the presence of 50 μm free Ca2+ was partially inhibited when the organic solvent was raised in the same concentration range. The rate of AcP hydrolysis in the presence of Ca2+ was 230 nmol of Pi/min/mg of protein in the absence of organic solvent and 118 nmol of Pi/min/mg of protein when 30% Me2SO was present. The functional effect of Me2SO was also studied by measuring Ca2+ transport in a medium containing 50 μm free Ca2+ and 10 mm AcP. The Ca2+ transport rate at neutral pH was 130 nmol of Ca2+/min/mg of protein when measured in the absence of Me2SO but practically zero when measured in the presence of 30% Me2SO (Fig. 4 B). The effect of Me2SO on SR vesicle permeability was tested previously by adding the organic solvent once the active transport process was initiated. The addition of 30% Me2SO after 9 min of reaction did not alter the Ca2+ content already accumulated inside the vesicles (data not shown), thus ruling out any ionophoric activity. The uncoupling process induced by Me2SO was characterized by studying the sensitivity to vanadate. To this end, the experiments shown in Fig. 3 B were now repeated in the presence of Me2SO. When SR vesicles in a Ca2+-free medium were supplemented with 30% Me2SO and 10 mm AcP was present, the hydrolysis rate was highly sensitive to vanadate inhibition, as observed in the absence of organic solvent (cf. Fig. 5 and Fig.3 B). However, the enzyme activity in the presence of 50 μm free Ca2+ and 30% Me2SO was hardly sensitive to vanadate (Fig. 5). The sensitivity of the Ca2+-dependent activity to vanadate was lower in the presence than in the absence of organic solvent (cf. Fig. 5 and Fig. 3 B). Steady accumulation of radioactive EP under turnover conditions was evaluated by adding [32P]AcP (Fig.6). Maximal EP levels were observed when SR vesicles were phosphorylated in the standard 50 μmfree Ca2+ medium. EP accumulation in the Ca2+-containing medium was practically abolished by equimolar TG but was almost totally insensitive to vanadate. Furthermore, AcP hydrolysis in the Ca2+-containing medium and in the presence of 30% Me2SO was associated with partial accumulation of vanadate-insensitive EP. No EP was accumulated when a Ca2+-free medium was used, and thus, TG or vanadate had no effect under this condition. AcP hydrolysis in the absence of Ca2+ but in the presence of 30% Me2SO led to practically full enzyme phosphorylation that was, in this case, sensitive to vanadate. Isolated SR vesicles as well as purified Ca2+-ATPase displayed AcP hydrolytic activity when measured in the presence or absence of Ca2+ (Fig. 2, A and B). This observation was already made with the substrates ATP (13Fortea M.I. Soler F. Fernandez-Belda F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 37266-37272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) and pNPP (12Fernandez-Belda F. Fortea M.I. Soler F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 7998-8004Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Both activities showed the same K m values for AcP, and the maximal hydrolytic rate in the presence of Ca2+ was only twice that observed in the absence of Ca2+ (Fig. 1). These features clearly indicated that both activities were sustained by the Ca2+-ATPase protein. Previous studies using SR vesicles had suggested that the Ca2+-independent activity was linked to a contaminating phosphatase activity (29Teruel J.A. Inesi G. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 5885-5890Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). A major difference was the steady accumulation of EP when the hydrolysis occurred in a Ca2+-containing medium as opposed to the lack of EP when a Ca2+-free medium was used (Fig.6). It seems that AcP can gain access to the enzyme catalytic site either in the presence or in the absence of Ca2+,and therefore, Ca2+ binding is not a prerequisite for AcP hydrolysis. Nevertheless, the hydrolytic process is more efficient when it occurs in a Ca2+-containing medium. The phosphorylation rate in the presence of AcP plus Ca2+ is quite slow when compared with the rate in the presence of ATP plus Ca2+although sufficiently faster than the dephosphorylation rate to allow EP accumulation (29Teruel J.A. Inesi G. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 5885-5890Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). However, the hydrolysis rate, and presumably the phosphoryl transfer reaction, are slower when the reaction takes place in the absence of Ca2+ and do not compensate for EP cleavage. For this reason, no EP accumulation is usually observed in a Ca2+-free medium. According to the conventional reaction cycle, the steady accumulation of EP is associated with Ca2+-bound conformations as opposed to uncoupled hydrolysis occurring through Ca2+-free species. However, this is not always the case. Thus, hydrolysis of pNPP by SR Ca2+-ATPase in the presence of Ca2+ does not allow EP accumulation unless the experimental conditions are forced (30Nakamura Y. Tonomura Y. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1978; 83: 571-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Moreover, furylacryloyl phosphate hydrolysis in the absence of Ca2+ but in the presence of 30% Me2SO produces an accumulation of ∼2 nmol of EP/mg of protein (6Inesi G. Kurzmack M. Nakamoto R. de Meis L. Bernhard S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 6040-6043Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and EP is accumulated when the Na+,K+-ATPase is in the presence of ATP, K+, and Me2SO but in the absence of Na+ (31Barrabin H. Fontes C.F. Scofano H.M. Norby J.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1023: 266-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Furthermore, ATP hydrolysis by the plasma membrane Ca2+-ATPase in the presence of Ca2+ produces low EP levels when compared with the maximal value (32Kosk-Kosicka D. Scaillet S. Inesi G. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 3333-3338Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, EP accumulation is only indicative of enzyme turnover through Ca2+-bound conformations in certain conditions since it is affected by parameters such as nature of the substrate, reaction temperature, free Ca2+ inside the vesicles, presence of organic solvent, etc. The rate of AcP hydrolysis was the same in the presence or absence of Ca2+ when ≥1 mol of TG/mol of enzyme was added (Fig.3 A). This observation can be explained by enzyme activity interconversion since: (i) TG stabilizes the enzyme in the Ca2+-free conformation (33Sagara Y. Inesi G. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 266: 13503-13506Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar, 34Sagara Y. Fernandez-Belda F. de Meis L. Inesi G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12606-12613Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), (ii) TG does not inhibit the Ca2+-independent activity (13Fortea M.I. Soler F. Fernandez-Belda F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 37266-37272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), and (iii) both hydrolytic activities are derived from the same protein. In other words, the enzyme in a Ca2+-containing medium is forced by TG to express the Ca2+-independent activity. This is also suggested by the fact that no EP was accumulated in the presence of Ca2+ when TG was added, as occurs during the enzyme turnover in a Ca2+-free medium (Fig. 6). The existence of a major vanadate-resistant component, which is evident when AcP hydrolysis is measured at neutral pH and in a Ca2+-containing medium (Fig. 3 B), suggests the prevalent accumulation of Ca2+-bound conformations since vanadate inhibits the Ca2+-independent activity. Ca2+-bound species were tested by repeating experiments in the presence of equimolar TG. The inhibitor TG blocked the whole enzyme population in the Ca2+-free conformation (Fig.3 A), and the vanadate-dependent inhibitory profile measured in the presence of Ca2+ plus TG exactly matched that observed in the absence of Ca2+ (Fig.3 B). The fact that EP reached almost maximal levels in the presence of Ca2+ when vanadate was added (Fig. 6) confirms that Ca2+-bound conformations were involved in the prevalent hydrolytic pathway. Me2SO produced opposite effects on AcP hydrolysis rates depending on the presence or absence of Ca2+ (Fig.4 A). Namely, the rate of AcP hydrolysis in the presence of Ca2+ was partially inhibited when 30% Me2SO was present. Also, AcP hydrolysis in the presence of Ca2+plus 30% Me2SO did not sustain net Ca2+transport (Fig. 4 B), giving rise to energy uncoupling. Our data indicate that the absence of Ca2+ transport induced by 30% Me2SO was associated with vanadate-resistant species (Fig. 5). Additional evidence was the steady accumulation of vanadate-resistant EP (Fig. 6). The absence of Ca2+transport in the presence of Me2SO with AcP as substrate was attributed previously to energy uncoupling through Ca2+-free conformations (11Chini E.N. Montero-Lomeli M. de Meis L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1030: 152-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (1) Google Scholar, 27Blinks J. Wier W. Hess P. Prendergast F. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 1982; 40: 1-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar). In this regard, 40% Me2SO favored the accumulation of vanadate-sensitive species, i.e. Ca2+-free conformations when the substrate was pNPP and Ca2+ was present (12Fernandez-Belda F. Fortea M.I. Soler F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 7998-8004Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). This study reveals that hydrolysis and uncoupling mainly occurred through Ca2+-bound conformations and steady EP accumulation as can be observed with the substrates ATP or pNPP. Hydrolysis and uncoupling in the presence of Ca2+ and Me2SO also occurred mainly through Ca2+-bound conformations and EP species when the substrate was AcP, at variance with the data obtained with the substrate pNPP (12Fernandez-Belda F. Fortea M.I. Soler F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 7998-8004Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). The Ca2+-independent activity in this study is mechanistically similar to the Na+,K+-ATPase activity when AcP or pNPP is hydrolyzed in the presence of K+ and absence of Na+. The so-called phosphatase activity does not support cation transport and has been attributed to E2 conformations (35Robinson J.D. Levine G.M. Robinson L.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1983; 731: 406-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 36Berberian G. Beauge L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1985; 821: 17-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The present results highlight the interdependence of Ca2+-dependent and Ca2+-independent hydrolytic activities catalyzed by SR Ca2+-ATPase, and therefore, the versatility of the enzyme reaction cycle."
