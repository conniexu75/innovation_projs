https://openalex.org/W1598010376,"The levels of all the free intermediates of the Krebs cycle except succinyl coenzyme A were measured in cerebral tissue of mice after periods of ischemia; anesthesia by Amytal, phenobarbital, and ether; hyperthermia; fluoroacetate poisoning; and insulin hypoglycemia. The levels of glucose, glucose 6-phosphate, pyruvate, phosphocreatine, adenosine triphosphate, adenosine diphosphate, and adenylic acid were also determined. During 5 sec of complete ischemia (decapitation) the levels of citrate, α-ketoglutarate, and oxalacetate fell 15 to 60% whereas the concentrations of succinate and fumarate rose 40% over a 30-sec interval. These changes presumably represent the conversion of a steady state system into an equilibrium system. Succinate accumulation is postulated to result from pyruvate carboxylation and fumarate reduction rather than from α-ketoglutarate oxidation. Decreasing the metabolic flux with anesthetic agents resulted in each case in marked decreases in α-ketoglutarate, fumarate, and malate, whereas increasing the flux by hyperthermia resulted in increases in these same three substrates. Neither anesthesia nor hyperthemia caused significant change in the levels of citrate, isocitrate, succinate, or oxalacetate. Fluoroacetate at first increased citrate levels without much effect on other substrates. Subsequently, when citrate had increased more than 3-fold, changes occurred in levels of the other Krebs cycle members. The accompanying rise in glucose 6-phosphate and fall in pyruvate suggested that inhibition of glycolysis at the phosphofructokinase step had taken place. Insulin hypoglycemia resulted in a general lowering of the levels of all Krebs cycle intermediates, as well as of glucose 6-phosphate and pyruvate. The changes associated with increasing, decreasing, or blocking flux in the Krebs cycle by the various procedures are used to assess the kinetic behavior of individual steps and to attempt to identify control points."

In mitosis those chromatids replicated on a DNA template synthesized during the preceding division cycle are separated from those constructed on a template synthesized two division cycles previously. Segregation in cells of the Chinese hamster follows a similar, but less pronounced, pattern."
https://openalex.org/W2059669214,"A multilayered, squamous-celled epithelial cell membrane covering the individual nerve fasciculi of the entire peripheral nervous system ( both voluntary and autonomic) including the sensory and motor end organs has been demonstrated in various species of animals, including man. This membrane is the direct continuation of the pia-arachnoid mater from the central nervous system. Functional significance of this membrane, especially as a diffusion barrier and as a protector of the peripheral nervous system, is briefly discussed."

https://openalex.org/W2016785078,From 15 minutes to 2 hours after the administration of aflatoxin B1 in vivo there is a 35- to 70-percent inhibition of DNA-directed RNA synthesis. The inhibition was reversed 12 and 24 hours later.
https://openalex.org/W2022407422,The effect of simple sugars on the agglutinating activity of phytohemagglutinin was studied. N-Acetyl-d-galactosamine selectively inhibits the agglutination of leukocytes and erythro- cytes by phytohemagglutinin.
https://openalex.org/W2007653442,"A specific method for starch-gel electrophoresis of galactose-1-phosphate uridyltransferase has been developed. Electrophoresis of red-cell hemolyzate from normal subjects and subjects homozygous for the Duarte variant has shown that the Duarte variant has a slightly faster electrophoretic mobility than the normal enzyme under the various conditions used. Molecular-weight estimation on Sephadex G-200 indicates that this observed difference in electrophoreticmobility of the Duarte variant is not due to difference in molecular size. Both enzymes have a molecular weigh of approximately 85,000."
https://openalex.org/W2033866229,"The ""olfactory nerve,"" the endoparietal eye, and the rudimentary lateral eyes of Limulus (polyphemus) contain simple photoreceptor cells that duplicate many of the electrical responses of the retinular cells of the lateral eye; the responses are a receptor potential consisting of an initial transient phase and a subsequent steady phase, low-amplitude fluctuations, and a small locally regenerative response to pulses of both light and current. Photic stimulation does not induce conducted action potentials, but does increase the membrane conductance. The receptor potential requires the presence of sodium ions in the external medium. Measurements of action and absorption spectra indicate a photopigment whose maximum absorption is of light with wavelength of 535 nanometers. The functional significance of these cells has not been ascertained."
https://openalex.org/W2081081400,Surface electromyograms of the laryngeal muscles were made while subjects read silently. Those who showed an increase in electrical activity over that at relaxation were provided with auditory feedback of the muscle activity. This treatment resulted in immediate and long-lasting cessation of the subvocalazation. This method should prove valuable in treating some reading problems.

A visual spatial aftereffect was observed which varied as a function of the angle of head-tilt and which was opposite in direction to head-tilt.

https://openalex.org/W2070543423,"Glucagon selectively potentiates an effect of hydrocortisone: when injected into adrenalectoinized rats it increases fourfold the induction by hydrocortisone of tyrosine transaminase, but not of tryptophan pyrrolase. Glucagon alone doubles the basal level of tyrosine transaminase and decreases that of tryptophan pyrrolase. The effects of glucagon on both enzymes resemble those of starvation."
https://openalex.org/W1969660083,"By means of a simple activity measure, mice with lesions of the septal forebrain were tested for passive avoidance (response inhibition) and fear conditioning. In two separate experiments animals with septal lesions showed little or no conditioning, as evidenced by lack of suppression of activity during and following activitycontingent foot shock. Results support and extend thehypothesis that these deficits in passive avoidance derive from the removal of normal inhibitory influences mediated by the septal area."
https://openalex.org/W2027963190,"Holomicrographs recorded through a microscope contain a hologram of the interior of the microscope, including the objective. During reconstruction of the microscopic image, modification of the aperture of the reconstructed objective produces the same alteration in the reconstructed image that would have occurred in the original image, if the actual objective had received the same modification. By this means, a single event holographed by bright-field microscopy may later be examined in reconstruction by dark-field, phase-contrast,or interference microscopy."

https://openalex.org/W2011956725,"The radiation dose detected by microthermoluminescent dosimeters attached to pocket mice,Perognathus formosus, indicated the amount of time these animals were active on the surface of the ground. Radiation was from anelevated, partially shielded source in the center of the 8-hectareenclosure. The rodents are almost entirely inactive in midwinter but spend 30 to 40 percent of their time above ground in the summer months. Periods of activity increase gradually through the spring. These results support laboratory findings that members of this genus undergo periods of torpor in response to low ambient temperatures or food shortage. That this adaptation may enhance survival is indicated by the longevity of marked individuals of a related species."

https://openalex.org/W2075872384,"AN elevated taste threshold for dextrose in diabetic patients without evidence of demonstrable diabetic neuropathy has recently been demonstrated1. Although it is unlikely that this was due to a non-specific decrease in gustatory acuity, those patients having normal thresholds for sodium chloride, further investigation of this possibility was indicated. The closely related olfactory threshold was, therefore, measured in 56 diabetic patients and 56 control patients, of the same age and sex. The method used was a modification of that of Elsberg and Levy2, in which increasing quantities of an air–coffee mixture were released into the nose until the subject recognized an odour to be present (minimal perceptible odour). The modifications (to be described elsewhere) were designed to diminish important variables inherent in the original technique. The determination was carried out at the same time of day for each patient in a pair."

https://openalex.org/W2001598323,"IT is well established that phlorrhizin and its aglycone phloretin affect hexose transfer in a number of tissues. Recently Forsling and Widdas1 showed that phenolphthalein caused competitive inhibition of facilitated glucose transfer in human erythrocytes. In view of its purgative action, it was of interest to test whether phenolphthalein also affected intestinal transfer mechanisms. At the same time the opportunity was taken to test another poly-phenolic compound phenol red (phenolsulphonphthalein), a molecule of similar structure which is known to be transferred by the renal tubule. The formulae of these compounds are shown in Fig. 1."

https://openalex.org/W1550540125,"Abstract A change in the method for preparing approximately 300-fold purified polynucleotide phosphorylase from Micrococcus lysodeikticus is reported. The over-all purification of the enzyme is not affected by the change in the procedure, and the new procedure is both more reproducible and easier to carry out. Enzyme purified by the new method has a more stringent requirement for oligonucleotide primer for the polymerization of adenosine diphosphate than did earlier enzyme preparations."

https://openalex.org/W2063926736,"Cultures of human fibroblasts were labeled briefly with tritiated thymidine and fixed; autoradiographs were made and exposed for 3(1/2) months. No labeling was noted over the centromere of metaphase or anaphase chromosomes. The technique was sensitive to replication at the centromere of a DNA helix only 2.5 microns long, considerably shorter than the estimated length of a replicon in humans. This suggests that chromatid separation during mitosis is not associated with delayed replication of a short segment of chromosomal DNA."

https://openalex.org/W2073951267,"Injection of small volumes of calcium solution into the lateral ventricle of the cat wa followed by large electrical-impedance changes in gray matter bounding the ventricle, including the caudate nucleus and hippocampus. These changes lasted more than 24 hours and were accompanied by epileptiform electroencephalographic activity. Biweekly injections led to status epilepticus. Injections of similar amounts of magnesium ions were without comparable effects. Possible interactions between calcium ions and intercellular macromolecular material are discussed as a basis for certain impedance shifts in cerebral tissue."

https://openalex.org/W2025508699,Minor changes in conventional low-noise amplifier circuits decrease circuit noise and attenuate the unwanted effects of varying impedances and potentials which exist between commonly employed electrodes and the tissues of biological subjects. The resulting reduction of intrinsic amplifier noise and reduced susceptibility to external interference is helpful in the study of low-frequency signals of microvolt level.

Such methods need to be very accurate, particularly where estimations of the degree of immunity of the host are to be made on the basis of such counts. The techniques described by these authors have been used routinely in this laboratory during experiments on adult rats and have proved quite satisfactory. However, on application to the recovery of worms from the intestines of neonatal or unweaned rats a number of difficulties were encountered."
