https://openalex.org/W2920819220,"Carnivores have long been used as model organisms to examine mechanisms that allow coexistence among ecologically similar species. Interactions between carnivores, including competition and predation, comprise important processes regulating local community structure and diversity. We use data from an intensive camera-trapping monitoring program across eight Neotropical forest sites to describe the patterns of spatiotemporal organization of a guild of five sympatric cat species: jaguar (Panthera onca), puma (Puma concolor), ocelot (Leopardus pardalis), jaguarundi (Herpailurus yagouaroundi) and margay (Leopardus wiedii). For the three largest cat species, we developed multi-stage occupancy models accounting for habitat characteristics (landscape complexity and prey availability) and models accounting for species interactions (occupancy estimates of potential competitor cat species). Patterns of habitat-use were best explained by prey availability, rather than habitat structure or species interactions, with no evidence of negative associations of jaguar on puma and ocelot occupancy or puma on ocelot occupancy. We further explore temporal activity patterns and overlap of all five felid species. We observed a moderate temporal overlap between jaguar, puma and ocelot, with differences in their activity peaks, whereas higher temporal partitioning was observed between jaguarundi and both ocelot and margay. Lastly, we conducted temporal overlap analysis and calculated species activity levels across study sites to explore if shifts in daily activity within species can be explained by varying levels of local competition pressure. Activity patterns of ocelots, jaguarundis and margays were similarly bimodal across sites, but pumas exhibited irregular activity patterns, most likely as a response to jaguar activity. Activity levels were similar among sites and observed differences were unrelated to competition or intraguild killing risk. Our study reveals apparent spatial and temporal partitioning for most of the species pairs analyzed, with prey abundance being more important than species interactions in governing the local occurrence and spatial distribution of Neotropical forest felids."
https://openalex.org/W2921362599,"Background Medication-related problems are common after hospitalization, for example when changes in patients’ medication regimens are accompanied by insufficient patient education, poor information transfer between healthcare providers, and inadequate follow-up post-discharge. We investigated the effect of a pharmacy-led transitional care program on the occurrence of medication-related problems four weeks post-discharge. Methods A prospective multi-center before-after study was conducted in six departments in total of two hospitals and 50 community pharmacies in the Netherlands. We tested a pharmacy-led program incorporating (i) usual care (medication reconciliation at hospital admission and discharge) combined with, (ii) teach-back at hospital discharge, (iii) improved transfer of medication information to primary healthcare providers and (iv) post-discharge home visit by the patient’s own community pharmacist, compared with usual care alone. The difference in medication-related problems four weeks post-discharge, measured by means of a validated telephone-interview protocol, was the primary outcome. Multiple logistic regression analysis was used, adjusting for potential confounders after multiple imputation to deal with missing data. Results We included 234 (January-April 2016) and 222 (July-November 2016) patients in the usual care and intervention group, respectively. Complete data on the primary outcome was available for 400 patients. The proportion of patients with any medication-related problem was 65.9% (211/400) in the usual care group compared to 52.4% (189/400) in the intervention group (p = 0.01). After multiple imputation, the proportion of patients with any medication-related problem remained lower in the intervention group (unadjusted odds ratio 0.57; 95% CI 0.38–0.86, adjusted odds ratio 0.50; 95% CI 0.31–0.79). Conclusions A pharmacy-led transitional care program reduced medication-related problems after discharge. Implementation research is needed to determine how best to embed these interventions in existing processes."
https://openalex.org/W2921249351,"Chronic Respiratory Diseases (CRDs), such as Asthma and Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD), are leading causes of deaths worldwide. Although both Asthma and COPD are not curable, they can be managed by close monitoring of symptoms to prevent worsening of the condition. One key symptom that needs to be monitored is the occurrence of wheezing sounds during breathing since its early identification could prevent serious exacerbations. Since wheezing can happen randomly without warning, a long-term monitoring system with automatic wheeze detection could be extremely helpful to manage these respiratory diseases. This study evaluates the discriminatory ability of different types of feature used in previous related studies, with a total size of 105 individual features, for automatic identification of wheezing sound during breathing. A linear classifier is used to determine the best features for classification by evaluating several performance metrics, including ranksum statistical test, area under the sensitivity-–specificity curve (AUC), F1 score, Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC), and relative computation time. Tonality index attained the highest effect size, at 87.95%, and was found to be the feature with the lowest p-value when ranksum significance test was performed. Third MFCC coefficient achieved the highest AUC and average optimum F1 score at 0.8919 and 82.67% respectively, while the highest average optimum MCC was obtained by the first coefficient of a 6th order LPC. The best possible combination of two and three features for wheeze detection is also studied. The study concludes with an analysis of the different trade-offs between accuracy, reliability, and computation requirements of the different features since these will be highly useful for researchers when designing algorithms for automatic wheeze identification."
https://openalex.org/W2922378504,"Every human being spontaneously touches its eyes, cheeks, chin and mouth manifold every day. These spontaneous facial self-touches (sFST) are elicited with little or no awareness and are distinct from gestures and instrumental acts. Self-touch frequency has been shown to be influenced by negative affect and attention distraction and may be involved in regulating emotion and working memory functions. Yet, even though self-touch research dates back several decades fundamental aspects, like the temporal progression of sFST or the effects of executing hand and touched face area, have not yet been analyzed. For the first time, the present study measured sFST temporal aspects to the millisecond using accelerometers and EMG. Spontaneous self-touch was triggered in sixty participants who completed a delayed memory task of complex haptic relief stimuli while listening to distracting aversive sounds. We found that while both hands were used equally often and with the same overall movement times and contact durations, significant effects occurred for face area in both frequency and contact durations. Ergo the point of touch seems to have some relevance of its own, independently of which hand is used to perform it. The results show that not only frequency but also the point of touch and contact durations are influenced by cognitive and emotional demands. We argue that investigating the fundamental characteristics of sFST will further the understanding of cognitive focusing and attentional mechanisms."
https://openalex.org/W2921646790,"Many species of sharks form aggregations around oceanic islands, yet their levels of residency and their site specificity around these islands may vary. In some cases, the waters around oceanic islands have been designated as marine protected areas, yet the conservation value for threatened shark species will depend greatly on how much time they spend within these protected waters. Eighty-four scalloped hammerhead sharks (Sphyrna lewini Griffith & Smith), were tagged with acoustic transmitters at Cocos Island between 2005–2013. The average residence index, expressed as a proportion of days present in our receiver array at the island over the entire monitoring period, was 0.52±0.31, implying that overall the sharks are strongly associated with the island. Residency was significantly greater at Alcyone, a shallow seamount located 3.6 km offshore from the main island, than at the other sites. Timing of presence at the receiver locations was mostly during daytime hours. Although only a single individual from Cocos was detected on a region-wide array, nine hammerheads tagged at Galapagos and Malpelo travelled to Cocos. The hammerheads tagged at Cocos were more resident than those visiting from elsewhere, suggesting that the Galapagos and Malpelo populations may use Cocos as a navigational waypoint or stopover during seasonal migrations to the coastal Central and South America. Our study demonstrates the importance of oceanic islands for this species, and shows that they may form a network of hotspots in the Eastern Tropical Pacific."
https://openalex.org/W2921381858,"Background Sub Saharan Africa continues to be the epicenter of HIV with 70% of people living with HIV globally. Women form nearly 60% of those living with HIV. Studies have shown disclosure of one’s HIV status is important in HIV prevention, in increasing partners who are tested and getting into care early as well as in improving retention in PMTCT and ART programs. This study aimed to determine the prevalence, factors and outcomes of HIV status disclosure to partners among HIV-positive women attending HIV care-and-treatment clinics (CTCs) at Kilimanjaro region, northern Tanzania. Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted from January to June 2014 in 3 out of the 7 districts of Kilimanjaro region. The study population was HIV-positive women aged 15–49, who were attending for routine HIV care at 19 selected clinics. Face-to-face interviews were conducted with consenting women to collect necessary information. Multivariate logistic regression analyses were used to determine the independent predictors of HIV status disclosure to partner. Results A total of 672 HIV-positive women in Moshi municipal, Hai and Mwanga districts were enrolled. Of them, 609 HIV-positive women reported to have a regular partner. Prevalence of serostatus disclosure to partners was 66%. Of the 400 who had disclosed; 56% did so within the first month of knowing their HIV status. In a multiple logistic regression model, HIV serostatus disclosure was higher among women who: were married/cohabiting (AOR = 4.16, 95% CI: 2.39–7.25; p<0.001), currently on ART (AOR = 2.06, 95% CI: 1.11–3.82; p = 0.020), and who reported had ever communicated with partners on number of children (AOR = 1.85, 95% CI: 1.15–2.98; p = 0.010) and contraceptives use (AOR = 2.01, 95% CI: 1.27–3.20; p = 0.208). Most of the women (81%) who disclosed their HIV status to did not reported negative outcomes. Conclusion In this setting still a third of the HIV-positive women (34%) fail to disclose their HIV- serostatus to partners. Interventions to impart skills in communication and negotiation between partners may help in improving disclosure of HIV. Efforts to involve men in general sexual and reproductive health including couple counseling and testing will contribute in improving disclosure and communication on HIV among partners."
https://openalex.org/W2921748954,"Objectives Undergraduate medical students experience a considerable amount of stress and anxiety due to frequent exams. The goal of the present study was to examine the development of exam related anxiety and to test for a correlation between anxiety and learning approaches. Methods A whole class of 212 medical students was invited to participate in the study. During their first term, trait anxiety and learning approaches were assessed by use of the state-trait-anxiety inventory (STAI-T) and the approaches-and-study-skills-inventory-for-students (ASSIST), respectively. Acute state anxiety was assessed twice in the course of the second term. To that extent, the STAI-S in combination with measuring salivary cortisol were employed immediately before two oral anatomy exams. Results Our most important results were that a surface learning approach correlated significantly with anxiety as a trait and that students with a predominantly strategic approach to learning were the least anxious yet academically most successful. Conclusion As surface learners are at risk of being academically less successful and because anxiety is a prerequisite for burn-out, we suggest that medical faculties place particular emphasis on conveying strategies for both, coping with stress and successful learning."

Aquaporin-3 (AQP3) has an important physiological function in renal water reabsorption, and AQP3-mediated hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) permeability can enhance cytokine signaling in several cell types. The related aquaglyceroporin AQP7 is required for dendritic cell chemokine responses and antigen uptake. Selective small-molecule inhibitors are desirable tools for investigating the biological and pathological roles of these and other AQP isoforms. Here, using a calcein fluorescence quenching assay, we screened a library of 7360 drug-like small molecules for inhibition of mouse AQP3 water permeability. Hit confirmation and expansion with commercially available substances identified the ortho-chloride–containing compound DFP00173, which inhibited mouse and human AQP3 with an IC50 of ∼0.1–0.4 μm but had low efficacy toward mouse AQP7 and AQP9. Surprisingly, inhibitor specificity testing revealed that the methylurea-linked compound Z433927330, a partial AQP3 inhibitor (IC50, ∼0.7–0.9 μm), is a potent and efficacious inhibitor of mouse AQP7 water permeability (IC50, ∼0.2 μm).

https://openalex.org/W2921644730,"Algicidal bacteria have received broad acceptance as an ecofriendly tool for controlling harmful algal blooms. However, their practical application is still limited to the lab-scale tests due to the complex alga–bacterium interactions in different nutrient statuses. In this study, the Aeromonas sp. L23 that exhibit relatively wide-spectrum in algicidal activity was isolated from a eutrophic agricultural lake. The physiological response of cyanobacteria and green to the algicidal activity under varied nutritional status were studied in an alga-bacterial co-culture. The algicidal activities of L23 against Microcystis aeruginosa UTEX LB 2385, Microcystis aeruginosa NHSB, Anabaena variabilis AG10064, Scenedesmus quadricauda AG10003, and Chlorella vulgaris AG10034 were 88 ± 1.2%, 94 ± 2.6%, 93 ± 0.5%, 82 ± 1.1%, and 47 ± 0.9%, respectively. The L23 cells had low algicidal activity in cell pellet (3%–9%) compared with the cell-free supernatant (78%–93%), indicating that the activity is induced by extracellular substances. Adding glucose, NaNO3, NH4Cl, and KH2PO4 to the co-culture raised the algicidal activity of the L23 against green algae by 5%–50%. Conversely, a 10%–20% decrease in activity occurred against the target cyanobacteria except M. aeruginosa UTEX LB 2385. These results indicated that the interspecific algicidal activity changes according to the nutritional status, which means that the alga-bacterium interaction will be more complex in the field where the nutritional status changes from time to time."
https://openalex.org/W2952598740,"The threat of invasive plant species in island populations prompts the need to better understand their population genetics and dynamics. In the Galapagos islands, this is exemplified by the introduced guava (Psidium guajava), considered one of the greatest threats to the local biodiversity due to its effective spread in the archipelago and its ability to outcompete endemic species. To better understand its history and genetics, we analyzed individuals from three inhabited islands in the Galapagos archipelago with 11 SSR markers. Our results reveal similar genetic diversity between islands, and the populations appear to be distinct: the islands of San Cristobal and Isabela are genetically different while the population of Santa Cruz is a mixture from both. Additional evidence for genetic bottlenecks and the inference of introduction events suggests an original introduction of the species in San Cristobal, from where it was later introduced to Isabela, and finally into Santa Cruz. Alternatively, a second introduction in Isabela might have occurred. These results are contrasted with the historical record, providing a first overview of the history of P. guajava in the Galapagos islands and its current population dynamics."
https://openalex.org/W2921950488,"Serine incorporator 5 (SERINC5) is a recently identified restriction factor that blocks virus entry but is antagonized by three unrelated retroviral accessory proteins. The S2 protein from equine infectious anemia virus (EIAV) has been reported to reduce SERINC5 expression at steady-state levels likely via the endocytic pathway; however, the precise mechanism is still unclear. Here, we investigated how EIAV S2 protein down-regulates SERINC5 compared with down-regulation induced by Nef from HIV-1 and glycoMA proteins from murine leukemia virus (MLV). Using bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) assay and immunoprecipitation (IP), we detected an interaction between S2 and SERINC5. We found that this interaction relies on the S2 myristoylation site, indicating that it may occur on the plasma membrane. S2 internalized SERINC5 via receptor-mediated endocytosis and targeted it to endosomes and lysosomes, resulting in a ubiquitination-dependent decrease in SERINC5 expression at steady-state levels. Both BiFC and IP detected a glycoMA–SERINC5 interaction, but a Nef–SERINC5 interaction was detected only by BiFC. Moreover, S2 and glycoMA down-regulated SERINC5 more effectively than did Nef. We further show that unlike Nef, both S2 and glycoMA effectively down-regulate SERINC2 and also SERINC5 from Xenopus tropicalis (xSERINC5). Moreover, we detected expression of the equine SERINC5 (eSERINC5) protein and observed that its expression is much weaker than expression levels of SERINC5 from other species. Nonetheless, eSERINC5 had a strong antiviral activity that was effectively counteracted by S2. We conclude that HIV-1, EIAV, and MLV share a similar mechanism to antagonize viral restriction by host SERINC5."
https://openalex.org/W2921539882,"Despite extensive recent investigations of moral judgments, little is known about how negative judgments like blame might differ from positive judgments like praise. Drawing on theory from both social and moral cognition, the present studies identify and test potential asymmetries in the extremity and differentiatedness of blame as compared to praise. The amplified blame hypothesis predicts that people will assign greater blame for negative behaviors than praise for positive behaviors. The differentiated blame hypothesis predicts that, as compared to praise judgments, blame judgments will more finely differentiate among distinct mental states that precede action, such as thoughts, desires, and intentions. A series of studies—using varied stimulus sets and samples—together provide robust support for the differentiated blame hypothesis and somewhat weaker support for the amplified blame hypotheses. These results illustrate systematic asymmetries between blame and praise, generally revealing that blame is more extreme and differentiated than praise. Together, the findings reflect the social costs and social regulatory function of moral judgments, suggesting that blame and praise are not mirror images and that blame might be more complex."
https://openalex.org/W2921052859,"ELOVL3 is a very long-chain fatty acid elongase, and its mRNA levels display diurnal rhythmic changes exclusively in adult male mouse livers. This cyclical expression of hepatic Elovl3 is potentially controlled by the circadian clock, related hormones, and transcriptional factors. It remains unknown, however, whether the circadian clock, in conjunction with androgen signaling, functions in maintaining the rhythmic expression of Elovl3 in a sexually dimorphic manner. Under either zeitgeber or circadian time, WT mouse livers exhibited a robust circadian rhythmicity in the expression of circadian clock genes and Elovl3. In contrast, male Bmal1−/− mice displayed severely weakened expression of hepatic circadian clock genes, resulting in relatively high, but nonrhythmic, Elovl3 expression levels. ChIP assays revealed that NR1D1 binds to the Elovl3 promoter upon circadian change in WT mouse livers in vivo, and a diminished binding was observed in male Bmal1−/− mouse livers. Additionally, female mouse livers exhibited constant low levels of Elovl3 expression. Castration markedly reduced Elovl3 expression levels in male mouse livers but did not disrupt circadian variation of Elovl3. Injection of female mice with 5α-dihydrotestosterone induced Elovl3 rhythmicity in the liver. In AML12 cells, 5α-dihydrotestosterone also elevated Elovl3 expression in a time-dependent manner. In contrast, flutamide efficiently attenuated this induction effect. In conclusion, a lack of either the circadian clock or androgen signaling impairs hepatic Elovl3 expression, highlighting the observation that coordination between the circadian clock and androgen signaling is required to sustain the rhythmic expression of Elovl3 in mouse liver.

https://openalex.org/W2920860188,"Background Whole body vibration exercise (WBVE) has been shown to improve muscular strength and power, and increase peripheral blood flow. The aim of this study was to evaluate the behavior of the skin temperature (Tsk) on regions of the lower limbs from an acute bout of WBVE. Methods and findings Cross-sectional study approved by local ethics committee (Certificado de Apresentação para Apreciação Ética—CAAE—19826413.8.0000.5259) and Trial registration (Registro Brasileiro de Ensaios Clínicos—REBEC—RBR-738wng). Using Infrared thermography (IRT), Tsk and thermal symmetry of the posterior lower extremities (thigh, knee, calf and heel) were examined in 19 healthy participants. IRT was assessed during 60-second WBVE exposures of 0, 30 and 50 Hz. From the adjusted linear mixed effects model, vibration frequency, time and regions of the lower extremity were significant (p<0.001). However, the variable laterality was not significant (p = 0.067) and was excluded from the adjusted statistical model. The adjusted model was significant (p<0.00001) and all variables in the model were significant (p<0.01) indicating that Tsk decreases with time, independently of the vibration frequency. The value of the Pseudo-R-Squared for the model was 0.8376. The presented mathematical model of the current study may be useful to justify the patterns observed for all vibration frequencies between and 0 and 50 Hz. The main limitations of the study were the reduced time of the intervention and not having evaluated other regions of the body. Conclusions The acute exposure of 60-second mechanical vibration has effect on the behavior of Tsk of the posterior region of the lower limbs, which is likely to be associated with a decrease on the blood flow due to WBVE. It is speculated that during WBVE a greater supply of blood is required where the body responds by shunting blood flow from the skin to working muscle in the first seconds of exercise. Further investigative work is required to verify this hypothesis."
https://openalex.org/W2922314261,"Background Gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men (GBM) have the highest proportion of incident HIV infection. Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) use and screening for sexually transmitted infections (STIs) are primary HIV prevention strategies, however, uptake remains low. Social capital, collective resources generated through social connections, are associated with lower HIV risk and infection. We investigated social capital in association with PrEP indicators among GBM. Methods Analyses included (N = 376) GBM from the 2014 National HIV Behavioral Surveillance (NHBS) in New Orleans. Multiple regression methods assessed the association between one item within each of eight domains from the Onyx and Bullen Social Capital Scale and: awareness and willingness to use PrEP. Analyses are adjusted for age, race, education, sexual intercourse with women, and health insurance. Results Forty percent of GBM were 18–29 years, 52 percent White. Sixty percent were willing to use PrEP. Social capital was above 50 percent across 7 of 8 indicators. Community group participation (vs no participation) was associated with higher likelihoods of PrEP awareness (adjusted Prevalence Ratio [aPR] = 1.41, 95% Confidence Interval [CI] = 1.02, 1.95). None of the seven remaining social capital indicators were significantly associated with any of the PrEP outcomes.

https://openalex.org/W2920918289,"Interpreting variable laboratory measurements of Helicoverpa zea Boddie susceptibility to toxins from Bacillus thuringiensis Berliner (Bt) has been challenging due to a lack of clear evidence to document declining field control. Research that links laboratory measurements of susceptibility to survival on Bt crops is vital for accurate characterization and any subsequent response to the occurrence of an implied H. zea resistance event. In this study, H. zea survival and the resultant damage to plant fruiting structures of non-Bt, Bollgard II, and Bollgard III cottons from two insect colonies with differing levels of laboratory susceptibility to Bt toxins were evaluated in large field cages. Laboratory bioassays revealed resistance ratios of 2.04 and 622.14 between the two H. zea colonies for Dipel DF and Cry1Ac, respectively. Differences between the two H. zea colonies measured via bioassays with Bollgard II and Bollgard III cotton leaf tissue in the laboratory were not statistically discernable. However, there was 17.6% and 5.3% lower larval mortality in Bollgard II and Bollgard III for the feral relative to the laboratory colony of H. zea, respectively. Although H. zea larval numbers in cages infested with the laboratory susceptible colony did not differ between the two Bt cottons, there were fewer larvae per 25 plants in Bollgard III than in Bollgard II cotton in cages containing tolerant insects. Cages infested with tolerant H. zea moths had higher numbers of total larvae than those containing the laboratory susceptible colony in both Bollgard II and Bollgard III cottons. Bollgard II and Bollgard III cottons received 77.4% and 82.7% more total damage to total plant fruiting structures in cages infested with tolerant insects relative to those containing the laboratory susceptible colony. The damage inflicted to fruiting structures on Bollgard III cotton by a feral H. zea colony with decreased measurements of laboratory susceptibility to Dipel DF and Cry1Ac indicate that the addition of Vip3A to third generation Bt cottons may not provide sufficient control in situations where infestations levels are high."
https://openalex.org/W2921520166,"One key feature of film consists in its power to bodily engage the viewer. Previous research has suggested lens and camera movements to be among the most effective stylistic devices involved in such engagement. In an EEG experiment we assessed the role of such movements in modulating specific spectators´ neural and experiential responses, likely reflecting such engagement. We produced short video clips of an empty room with a still, a zooming and a moving camera (steadicam) that might simulate the movement of an observer in different ways. We found an event related desynchronization of the beta components of the rolandic mu rhythm that was stronger for the clips produced with steadicam than for those produced with a still or zooming camera. No equivalent modulation in the attention related occipital areas was found, thus confirming the sensorimotor nature of spectators´ neural responses to the film clips. The present study provides the first empirical evidence that filmic means such as camera movements alone can modulate spectators' bodily engagement with film."
https://openalex.org/W2952134384,"Tuberculosis (TB) is a chronic infectious disease caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) and remains a major health problem worldwide. Thus, identification of new and more effective drugs to treat emerging multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB) and to reduce the side effects of anti-TB drugs, such as liver toxicity and other detrimental changes, is urgently needed. In this study, to develop a novel candidate drug for effective TB treatment with few side effects in the host, we selected pasakbumin A isolated from Eurycoma longifolia (E. longifolia) Jack, which protected host cells against Mtb infection-induced death. Pasakbumin A significantly inhibited intracellular Mtb growth by inducing the autophagy via the ERK1/2-mediated signaling pathway in Mtb-infected macrophages. We further investigated whether pasakbumin A could be used as a potential adjuvant for TB treatment. Treatment with pasakbumin A and anti-TB drug rifampicin (RMP) potently suppressed intracellular Mtb killing by promoting autophagy as well as TNF-α production via the ERK1/2- and NF-κB-mediated signaling pathways in Mtb-infected cells. Our results suggest that pasakbumin A could be developed as a novel anti-TB drug or host-directed therapeutic (HDT) strategy to protect against host cell death and improve host defense mechanisms against Mtb infection in macrophages."

We collected swabs from the nares and oropharynx of each participant to assess the microbiome via 16s rRNA sequencing. We observed livestock workers to have greater diversity in their microbiomes compared to those with no livestock contact. In the nares, there were 27 operational taxonomic units found to be different between livestock workers and non-livestock workers with the greatest difference seen with Streptococcus and Proteobacteria.

https://openalex.org/W2921108005,"We propose a new sparsification method for the singular value decomposition—called the constrained singular value decomposition (CSVD)—that can incorporate multiple constraints such as sparsification and orthogonality for the left and right singular vectors. The CSVD can combine different constraints because it implements each constraint as a projection onto a convex set, and because it integrates these constraints as projections onto the intersection of multiple convex sets. We show that, with appropriate sparsification constants, the algorithm is guaranteed to converge to a stable point. We also propose and analyze the convergence of an efficient algorithm for the specific case of the projection onto the balls defined by the norms L1 and L2. We illustrate the CSVD and compare it to the standard singular value decomposition and to a non-orthogonal related sparsification method with: 1) a simulated example, 2) a small set of face images (corresponding to a configuration with a number of variables much larger than the number of observations), and 3) a psychometric application with a large number of observations and a small number of variables. The companion R-package, csvd, that implements the algorithms described in this paper, along with reproducible examples, are available for download from https://github.com/vguillemot/csvd."
https://openalex.org/W2921372552,"The approval of biosimilars requires demonstration of biosimilarity, which rests on the base of thorough analytical characterization of the biosimilar product. In addition to demonstration of biosimilarity, the product related impurities need to be thoroughly characterized and controlled at minimal levels. Pegylation of peptides and proteins creates significant challenges for detailed structural characterization, such as PEG (Poly Ethylene Glycol) heterogeneity, site of addition and number of attached pegylated moieties. A combination of several methods including circular dichroism, FTIR (Fourier-transform Infrared Spectroscopy), fluorescence spectroscopy, DSC (Differential Scanning Calorimetry), 1D and 2D NMR (Nuclear Magnetic Resonance), Edman degradation and peptide mapping by LC-MS (Liquid Chromatography Mass Spectrometry) were used for characterization of N-terminally pegylated filgrastim. Product related impurities such as oxidized, reduced, deamidated, dipegylated variants and monopegylated positional isomers have been characterized in detail using various HPLC (High Performance Liquid Chromatography) based methods and LC-MS techniques. The functional characterization in terms of receptor binding and cell proliferation assay was conducted for the similarity assessment and the potential impact of the product variants on the in vitro biological activity has also been assessed. In summary, this study presents, for the first time, a detailed structural and molecular level characterization of a biosimilar pegfilgrastim providing a strong base for the demonstration of overall biosimilarity of the product with the innovator product."
https://openalex.org/W2921562630,"Cotton (Gossypium spp.) is one of the most important economic crops and exhibits yield-improving heterosis in specific hybrid combinations. The genic male-sterility system is the main strategy used for producing heterosis in cotton. To better understand the mechanisms of male sterility in cotton, we carried out two-dimensional electrophoresis (2-DE) and label-free quantitative proteomics analysis in the anthers of two near-isogenic lines, the male-sterile line 1355A and the male-fertile line 1355B. We identified 39 and 124 proteins that were significantly differentially expressed between these two lines in the anthers at the tetrad stage (stage 7) and uninucleate pollen stage (stage 8), respectively. Gene ontology-based analysis revealed that these differentially expressed proteins were mainly associated with pyruvate, carbohydrate, and fatty acid metabolism. Biochemical analysis revealed that in the anthers of line 1355A, glycolysis was activated, which was caused by a reduction in fructose, glucose, and other soluble sugars, and that accumulation of acetyl-CoA was increased along with a significant increase in C14:0 and C18:1 free fatty acids. However, the activities of pyruvate dehydrogenase and fatty acid biosynthesis were inhibited and fatty acid β-oxidation was activated at the translational level in 1355A. We speculate that in the 1355A anther, high rates of glucose metabolism may promote fatty acid synthesis to enable anther growth. These results provide new insights into the molecular mechanism of genic male sterility in upland cotton."
https://openalex.org/W2922202311,"Deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the subthalamic nucleus (STN) is the most commonly used surgical treatment for Parkinson's disease (PD). The disease-modifying aspects of DBS at a cellular level are not fully understood, and the key question of the effect of DBS on the degeneration of the dopaminergic (DA) neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc) remains to be answered. A major technical hurdle in determining any neuroprotective effect by DBS is its use in mid- to late-stage patients with PD when a majority of the DA neurons have been lost. In this work, we hypothesized that the long-term clinical benefits of DBS are, at least in part, due to a neuromodulatory effect on the SNpc neurons. These changes would affect cellular energetics and mitochondrial metabolism. We examined the number and volume of mitochondria as well as their vicinity to the DA presynaptic terminals postmortem caudate and putamen of 3 healthy individuals, 4 PD cases, and 3 DBS-treated patients. PD seems to have caused an increase in the mean distance between mitochondria and presynaptic terminals as well as a decrease in mean mitochondrial volume and numbers in DA projections. Although there was no difference in distance between mitochondria and presynaptic terminals of SNpc neurons in PD brains vs. DBS-treated brains, DBS treatment seemed to have inhibited or reversed the reduction in mitochondrial volume and numbers caused by PD. These results suggest enhanced metabolic plasticity leading to neuroprotection in the SNpc as a result of STN-DBS.-Mallach, A., Weinert, M., Arthur, J., Gveric, D., Tierney, T. S., Alavian, K. N. Post mortem examination of Parkinson's disease brains suggests decline in mitochondrial biomass, reversed by deep brain stimulation of subthalamic nucleus."
https://openalex.org/W2952163130,"We previously found relationships between body condition and physiological function affecting health and welfare of female tourist camp elephants in Thailand, and used that approach to conduct a similar study of bull elephants in the same camps (n = 13). A body condition score (BCS) was done every other month, and fecal glucocorticoid metabolite (FGM) concentrations were measured twice monthly for 1 year. Effects of season, camp management and tourist activity on lipid profiles [total cholesterol (TC), low density lipoproteins (LDL), high density lipoproteins (HDL), triglycerides (TG)] and metabolic factors [insulin, glucose, fructosamine, glucose to insulin ratio (G:I)] were determined and correlated to measures of body condition, testosterone and FGM. Positive correlations were found between BCS and TG, between FGM and TG, HDL and glucose, and between testosterone and HDL, whereas BCS and testosterone were negatively associated with the G:I. There was a significant positive relationship between FGM and testosterone. Elevated FGM concentrations were associated with altered lipid and metabolic profiles and were higher in winter compared to summer and rainy seasons. Insulin and glucose levels were higher, while the G:I was lowest in the winter season. Strong positive associations were found between TC and HDL, LDL and HDL and glucose, and glucose and insulin. By contrast, negative relationships were found between the G:I and HDL and glucose, and between insulin and G:I. Differences also were found between High and Low tourist season months for FGM, insulin, and G:I. Last, there was notable variation among the camps in measured parameters, which together with tourist season effects suggests camp management may affect physiological function and welfare; some negatively like feeding high calorie treats, others positively, like exercise. Last, compared to females, bull elephants appear to be in better physical health based on normal BCSs, lower insulin levels and higher G:I ratios."
https://openalex.org/W2921214447,"As the factors that link education level with incident functional disability in elderly Japanese have never been investigated, the present study investigated this issue in an elderly Japanese population. A 9-year prospective cohort study (2006–2015) was conducted among 8,680 Japanese individuals (≥65 years), Ohsaki city, Japan. In a baseline survey, we collected data on education level and potential mediators. Data on incident functional disability were retrieved from the Long-term Care Insurance database. The Cox proportional hazards model was used to estimate the hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for incident functional disability by education level (below upper-secondary education (reference), and upper secondary education and above). Mediating effects were estimated using accelerated failure time model and a logistic regression model. During 9-year follow-up period, 2,742 cases (31.6%) of incident functional disability were observed, and education level showed an inverse association with functional disability (P for trend <0.01). Participation in community activities had the largest mediating effect (34.7%) on the relationship between education level and incident functional disability. This effect remained among those aged 65–74 years (19.9%) but became negligible among those aged ≥75 years. Other potential mediators (such as smoking and drinking status) were also tested, but these showed only small mediating effects. The inverse association between education level and the incident risk of functional disability appears to be largely mediated by participation in community activities among elderly Japanese, especially those aged 65–74 years."
https://openalex.org/W2951008388,"Tuberculosis (TB) is an infectious bacterial disease that kills approximately 1.3 million people every year. Despite global efforts to reduce both the incidence and mortality associated with TB, the emergence of drug resistant strains has slowed any progress made towards combating the spread of this deadly disease. The current TB drug regimen is inadequate, takes months to complete and poses significant challenges when administering to patients suffering from drug resistant TB. New treatments that are faster, simpler and more affordable are urgently required. Arguably, a good strategy to discover new drugs is to start with an old drug. Here, we have screened a library of 1200 FDA approved drugs from the Prestwick Chemical library using a GFP microplate assay. Drugs were screened against GFP expressing strains of Mycobacterium smegmatis and Mycobacterium bovis BCG as surrogates for Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the causative agent of TB in humans. We identified several classes of drugs that displayed antimycobacterial activity against both M. smegmatis and BCG, however each organism also displayed some selectivity towards certain drug classes. Variant analysis of whole genomes sequenced for resistant mutants raised to florfenicol, vanoxerine and pentamidine highlight new pathways that could be exploited in drug repurposing programmes."
https://openalex.org/W2921649310,"Background Chemotherapy is the standard approach for advanced gastric cancer, while the role of local therapy such as surgery and radiation for this population remains controversial. Our purpose is to evaluate the effect of local therapies on cancer specific survival (CSS) for advanced gastric cancer patients. Methods Four subgroups of patients in different treatment strategies: surgery, radiation (RT), surgery and radiation (Surgery+RT), no surgery/no radiation (No Surgery/No RT) were identified from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER)-registered database. The risk factors and the survival outcomes were analyzed by multivariable Cox regression models and Kaplan-Meier methods. Results A total of 10,354 patients were eligible with 6658 males and 3696 females. The 5-year CSS in the four subgroups of “Surgery”, “RT”, “Surgery+RT” and “No Surgery/No RT” were respectively 8.9%. 5.7%, 19.8% and 3.2%, which were significantly different in multivariate Cox regression (P<0.001) and univariate log-rank test (P<0.001). Advanced stage categories were defined as stage I, II and III of T/N category according to different initial T and N status following American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) staging principle. Further analysis showed that patients in the group of “Surgery+RT” have significant benefits of survival specifically on stage II and III of T/N category. “Surgery+RT” group and “Surgery” group patients have similar survival time in stage I of T/N category. Moreover, we also found CSS benefits from the administration of “Surgery+RT” in the patients aged both ≥75 and <75 years. Remarkably, patients in “Surgery” group have no different survival time with “RT” group in age category of 75 years and older. Conclusions Local therapies, including surgery, radiation, and combination of both might associate to improve survival in advanced gastric cancer patients, but confounding due to disease extent and physical status cannot be excluded."
https://openalex.org/W2921669455,"Falls are commonly reported post-stroke. Ankle-foot orthoses (AFOs) are often provided to improve safety and walking, but the effect of their use in the reduction of falls after stroke is unknown. A randomized controlled trial (RCT) on the effects of AFO-provision after stroke was performed. Effects on clinical scales, 3D-gait kinematics and muscle-activity were previously reported. This paper aims to study the effects of AFO-provision on occurrence and circumstances of falls/near falls. The RCT included unilateral hemiparetic stroke patients. AFOs were provided either early (study week 1) or delayed (study week 9). Both groups were compared in the first eight weeks of the study and diaries were used to register falls/near falls and their circumstances. Follow-up measurements were performed in week 9-52, in which both groups were provided with AFOs. Functional Ambulation Categories and Berg Balance Scale were assessed to determine walking independence and balance, respectively. Last known scores were noted in case of an incident. Thirty-three subjects were included (16 early, 17 delayed). In week 1-8, the early group, who were provided with AFOs, fell significantly more frequently compared with the delayed group, 11 versus 4 times, respectively (Incidence Rate Ratio = 2.9, p = 0.039). Out of the falls recorded in the early group, 63.6% occurred without wearing AFOs. Most of these falls occurred during transfers (36.4%) and standing (27.3%), and notably it were the subjects who did not have independent walking ability. No differences were found for near falls in week 1-8, or for falls/near falls in week 9-52. Six severe consequences (including fractures) were reported from a fall. To conclude, the subjects provided with AFOs early after stroke reported a higher number of falls, compared to the subjects that had not yet been provided with AFOs. However, in the subjects provided with AFOs, 63.6% of the falls occurred whilst without wearing the AFO. Furthermore, the majority of these incidents took place whilst subjects had no independent walking ability. This raises an interesting question of the importance of careful instructions to patients and their relatives, and the influence of potential cognitive impairments on the ability of the subjects to take on these instructions."

Peak VO2 was corrected for the effects of body mass by ratio or allometric scaling. Z score equations for predicting peak VO2 were developed. Correlations between scaled peak VO2, z scores, body size and age were tested to examine the effectiveness of the approach.Eight hundred and fifty-two participants (48% male) were included in the analyses. Absolute peak VO2 significantly increased with age in both sexes (both P<0.05), while ratio-scaled peak VO2 increased only in males (P<0.05). Allometrically scaled peak VO2 increased from 11 years in both sexes, plateauing by 12 years in girls and continuing to rise until 15 years in boys. Allometically scaled peak VO2 was not correlated with body mass, but remained correlated with height and age in all but the older girls. Peak VO2 z score was not correlated with body mass, height or age.Absolute and allometric scaled peak VO2 values are provided for Hong Kong Chinese children and adolescents by age and sex. Peak VO2 z scores improve the evaluation of cardiopulmonary fitness, allowing comparisons across ages and sex and will likely provide a better metric for tracking change over time in children and adolescents, regardless of body size and age."
https://openalex.org/W2890285991,"The clustering of data into physically meaningful subsets often requires assumptions regarding the number, size, or shape of the subgroups. Here, we present a new method, simultaneous coherent structure coloring (sCSC), which accomplishes the task of unsupervised clustering without a priori guidance regarding the underlying structure of the data. sCSC performs a sequence of binary splittings on the dataset such that the most dissimilar data points are required to be in separate clusters. To achieve this, we obtain a set of orthogonal coordinates along which dissimilarity in the dataset is maximized from a generalized eigenvalue problem based on the pairwise dissimilarity between the data points to be clustered. This sequence of bifurcations produces a binary tree representation of the system, from which the number of clusters in the data and their interrelationships naturally emerge. To illustrate the effectiveness of the method in the absence of a priori assumptions, we apply it to three exemplary problems in fluid dynamics. Then, we illustrate its capacity for interpretability using a high-dimensional protein folding simulation dataset. While we restrict our examples to dynamical physical systems in this work, we anticipate straightforward translation to other fields where existing analysis tools require ad hoc assumptions on the data structure, lack the interpretability of the present method, or in which the underlying processes are less accessible, such as genomics and neuroscience."

Therefore in 2016, the country adopted World Health Organization recommendations of stratifying pregnant women into ""High"" or""Low"" MTCT risk for subsequent provision of HIV exposed infant (HEI) with appropriate follow-up care according to risk status.The study sought to ascertain, among pregnant women who delivered in clinics of Harare in August 2017: the extent to which high risk MTCT pregnancies were identified at time of delivery; and whether their newborns were initiated on appropriate ARV prophylaxis, cotrimoxazole prophylaxis, subjected to early HIV diagnostic testing and initiated on ARV treatment.Cross-sectional study using review of records of routinely collected program data.Of the 1,786 pregnant women who delivered in the selected clinics, HIV status at the time of delivery was known for 1,756 (98%) of whom 197 (11%) were HIV seropositive. Only 19 (10%) could be classified as ""high risk"" for MTCT and the remaining 90% lacked adequate information to classify them into high or low risk for MTCT due to missing data. Of the 197 live births, only two (1%) infants had a nucleic-acid test (NAT) at birth and 32 (16%) infants had NAT at 6 weeks. Of all 197 infants, 183 (93%) were initiated on single ARV prophylaxis (Nevirapine), 15 (7%) infants' ARV prophylaxis status was not documented and one infant got dual ARV prophylaxis (Nevirapine+Zidovudine).There was paucity of data requisite for MTCT risk stratification due to poor recording of data; ""high risk"" women were missed in the few circumstances where sufficient data were available. Thus ""high risk"" HEI are deprived of dual ARV prophylaxis and priority HIV NAT at birth and onwards which they require for PMTCT. Health workers need urgent training, mentorship and supportive supervision to master data management and perform MTCT risk stratification satisfactorily."

Here, we used the Geometric Framework for Nutrition to test how the amounts of dietary macronutrients and their interactions, as well as carbohydrate type (starch vs sucrose vs resistant starch) influenced periodontitis-associated alveolar bone height in mice. Increasing intake of carbohydrates reduced alveolar bone height, while dietary protein had no effect. Whether carbohydrate came from sugar or starch did not influence the extent of alveolar bone height. In summary, the amount of carbohydrate in the diet modulated periodontitis-associated alveolar bone height independent of the source of carbohydrates."
https://openalex.org/W2922523836,"Based in high sensitivity and specificity reported recently in detection of the cancer, the technique of Raman spectroscopy is proposed to discriminate between breast cancer, leukemia and cervical cancer using blood serum samples from patients officially diagnosed. In order to classify Raman spectra, clustering method known as Super Paramagnetic Clustering based on statistical physics concepts with a stochastic approach was implemented. Comparing firstly average Raman spectra of the three cancers, some peaks that allowed differentiating one cancer from other were identified, however, other peaks allowed concluding that there are biochemical similarities among them. According to these spectra, the band associated with amide I (1654 cm−1) and one of two shoulders assigned to amide III (1230-1282 cm−1) allowed discriminating leukemia from breast and cervical cancer, whereas band 714 cm−1 (polysaccharides) achieves to differentiate cervical cancer from leukemia and breast cancer, and bulged region, 1040 − 1100 cm−1 (phenylalanine, phospholipid) discriminated breast cancer from leukemia and cervical cancer. Subsequently, Super Paramagnetic Clustering method was applied to Raman spectra to study similarity relationships between cancers based on the biochemical composition of serum samples. Finally, as a cross check method, the standard method to classify Raman spectra of breast cancer, leukemia and cervical cancer, known as principal components analysis, was used showing excellent agreement with results of Super Paramagnetic Clustering method. Preliminary results demonstrated that Raman spectroscopy and Super Paramagnetic Clustering method can be used to discriminate between breast cancer, leukemia and cervical cancer samples using blood serum samples."
https://openalex.org/W2921616830,"Background Burden of disease (BoD) estimations are increasingly used to prioritize public health interventions. Previous Cryptosporidium BoD models accounted only for acute episodes, while there is increasing evidence of long-term manifestations. Our objective was to update Cryptosporidium BoD and cost-of-illness (COI) models and to estimate BoD and COI for the Netherlands in years 2013–2017. Methods We performed a scoping literature review and drew an outcome tree including long-term manifestations for which sufficient evidence was found, such as recurrent diarrhea and joint pain. We chose the Disability-Adjusted Life Year (DALY) metric to synthesize years of life lost due mortality (YLLs) and years lived with disability due to non-fatal outcomes (YLDs). For the costs, we adopted a societal perspective accounting for direct healthcare costs, patient costs and productivity losses. Uncertainty was managed using Latin Hypercube sampling (30,000 iterations). Results In the Netherlands in 2017, we estimated 50,000 Cryptosporidium cases (95% uncertainty interval (UI): 15,000–102,000), 7,000 GP visits, 300 hospitalizations and 3 deaths, resulting in 137 DALYs (95%UI: 54–255) and €19.2 million COI (95%UI: €7.2 million– €36.2 million). Estimates were highest for 2016 (218 DALYs and €31.1 million in COI), and lowest in 2013 (100 DALYs and €13.8 million in COI). Most of the BoD was attributable to YLD (≈80% of DALYs). The most important cost was productivity losses (≈90% of total COI). Long-term manifestations, including recurring diarrhea and joint pain, accounted for 9% of the total DALYs and 7% of the total COI. Conclusion Current evidence supports the inclusion of long-term manifestations in Cryptosporidium models, which contribute close to 10% of the total DALYs and costs. This may be an underestimation, as we were conservative in our assumptions. Cryptosporidium should be considered a priority organism with respect to public health surveillance, even in industrialized countries with high hygiene standards."

Objectives To assess the in vivo efficacy of a method to adjust the dose of enzymatic supplement in CF extrapolated from previous in vitro digestion studies (theoretical optimal dose, TOD). Secondly, to assess how individual patient characteristics influence the expected coefficient of fat absorption (CFA) and thus to identify an individual correction factor to improve TOD. Methods A prospective interventional study in 43 paediatric patients with CF from 5 European centres. They followed a 24h fixed diet with the theoretical optimal dose for each meal. Faecal collection was carried out between colorimetric markers in order to include all the faeces corresponding to the fixed diet. Beta regression models were applied to assess the associations of individual patient characteristics with the CFA. Results Median CFA was 90% (84, 94% 1st, 3rd Q.) with no significant differences among centres. Intestinal transit time was positively associated with CFA (p = 0.007), but no statistical associations were found with and age, gender, phenotype or BMI. Regression model showed no improvement of the in vitro predicted theoretical optimal dose when taking individual patient characteristics into account. Conclusion Strict adherence to the theoretical optimal dose of enzymatic supplement for a prescribed meal, led to median CFA levels at the clinical target of 90% with a low variability between patients. The proposed method can be considered as a first approach for an evidence-based method in PERT dosing based on food characteristics. Results have to be confirmed in free dietary settings."
https://openalex.org/W2920962237,"In scenarios where allocations are determined by participant’s preferences, Two-Sided Matching is a well-established approach with applications in College Admissions, School Choice, and Mentor-Mentee matching problems. In such a context, participants in the matching have preferences with whom they want to be matched with. This article studies two important concepts in Two-Sided Matching: multiple objectives when finding a solution, and manipulation of preferences by participants. We use real data sets from a Mentor-Mentee program for the evaluation to provide insight on realistic effects and implications of the two concepts. In the first part of the article, we consider the quality of solutions found by different algorithms using a variety of solution criteria. Most current algorithms focus on one criterion (number of participants matched), while not directly taking into account additional objectives. Hence, we evaluate different algorithms, including multi-objective heuristics, and the resulting trade-offs. The evaluation shows that existing algorithms for the considered problem sizes perform similarly well and close to the optimal solution, yet multi-objective heuristics provide the additional benefit of yielding solutions with better quality on multiple criteria. In the second part, we consider the effects of different types of preference manipulation on the participants and the overall solution. Preference manipulation is a concept that is well established in theory, yet its practical effects on the participants and the solution quality are less clear. Hence, we evaluate the effects of three manipulation strategies on the participants and the overall solution quality, and investigate if the effects depend on the used solution algorithm as well."
https://openalex.org/W2921161340,"Sympatric herbivores experience similar environmental conditions but can vary in their population trends. Identifying factors causing these differences could assist conservation efforts aimed at maintaining fully functional ecosystems. From 1996–2013, tsessebe and wildebeest populations in the Okavango Delta, Botswana, declined by 73% and 90%, respectively, whereas zebra populations remained stable. These sympatric, medium sized herbivores are exposed to similar natural and anthropogenic pressures, but apparently differ in their responses to those pressures. To identify factors that could cause these differences, we fitted GPS-enabled collars to six zebra, eight tsessebe and seven wildebeest in the Moremi Game Reserve, Botswana. We calculated utilisation distributions (UDs) from GPS data, and used 95% isopleths to compare seasonal home range size between species. We calculated utilisation intensity (UI) from the UDs and generated spatial layers representing resources and disturbances, and then used model averaging to identify factors affecting UI for each species. We calculated second and third order habitat selection ratios to determine whether species were habitat specialists or generalists. Zebra occupied larger home ranges than tsessebe and wildebeest, showed weaker responses to spatial variables and displayed no third order habitat selection; zebra social systems are also more fluid, allowing for information exchange between stable harems. Herbivore species that are sedentary, occupy small home ranges, are habitat specialists and exist in relatively isolated groups are likely to be less resistant and resilient to the rapid pace of environmental change forecast by climate change scenarios. Resources contained within existing protected areas are unlikely to maintain populations of such species at sufficiently high levels, potentially leading to functional extinction. Special precautions may be needed to ensure that such species can persist in the wild, such as buffer zones around existing protected areas, which would allow greater potential for adaptive movement should current environmental conditions change."
https://openalex.org/W2920863750,"In situ simulation is a new tool for building teamwork during crisis. However, only a few studies have discussed the long-term effects of regular in situ simulations. To better understand these effects, this study retrospectively analyzed the effect of regular (twice a month over a four-year period) in situ simulations in the National Cheng Kung University Hospital acute care ward, which provides care for patients with acute illnesses and requires admission during an emergency room visit. The simulations were held in a real clinical environment using a low-fidelity mannequin and the trainees involved in the simulations were the medical staff of the acute care ward. In this study, we review the effects of such long-term simulations with respect to team performance based on the Ottawa global rating scale (GRS) and incidences of urgent intubation and unexpected cardiac arrest. Our results revealed that among the 84 simulations that were conducted during the study period, 42 could be categorized as ""high performance"" and the remaining 42 as ""low performance"" based on the team's Ottawa GRS. Further, the seniority of nurse leaders and exposure of nurses to repeated simulations did not have any effect on performance. However, although regular simulations did not have any effect on the number of urgent intubations, they caused a marked decrease in the number of unexpected cardiac arrests. The current study did not show that repeated, low-fidelity, regular in situ simulations improve team performance in simulations based on Ottawa GRS, but it was associated with a reduction in the unexpected cardiac arrest rate in the acute care ward. Our results support the use of in situ simulations in acute care wards as an educational tool for first-line caregivers."
https://openalex.org/W2921892092,"The hepatitis C virus (HCV) nonstructural protein 5A (NS5A) plays a key role in viral replication and virion assembly, and the regulation of the assembly process critically depends on phosphorylation of both serine and threonine residues in NS5A. We previously identified SRC proto-oncogene, nonreceptor tyrosine kinase (c-Src), as an essential host component of the HCV replication complex consisting of NS5A, the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase NS5B, and c-Src. Pulldown assays revealed an interaction between NS5A and the Src homology 2 (SH2) domain of c-Src; however, the precise binding mode remains undefined. In this study, using a variety of biochemical and biophysical techniques, along with molecular dynamics simulations, we demonstrate that the interaction between NS5A and the c-Src SH2 domain strictly depends on an intact phosphotyrosine-binding competent SH2 domain and on tyrosine phosphorylation within NS5A. Detailed analysis of c-Src SH2 domain binding to a panel of phosphorylation-deficient NS5A variants revealed that phosphorylation of Tyr-93 located within domain 1 of NS5A, but not of any other tyrosine residue, is crucial for complex formation. In line with these findings, effective replication of subgenomic HCV replicons as well as production of infectious virus particles in mammalian cell culture models were clearly dependent on the presence of tyrosine at position 93 of NS5A. These findings indicate that phosphorylated Tyr-93 in NS5A plays an important role during viral replication by facilitating NS5A's interaction with the SH2 domain of c-Src."
https://openalex.org/W2921824724,"Background Molecular typing and whole genome sequencing (WGS) information is used for (inter-) national outbreak investigations. To assist the implementation of these techniques for tuberculosis (TB) surveillance and outbreak investigations at European level there is a need for inter-country collaboration and standardization. This demands more information on molecular typing practices and capabilities of individual countries. We aimed to review the use of molecular/genomic typing for TB surveillance in European Union and European Economic Area countries in 2016; assess its public health value; and collect experiences on typing data use for cross-border cluster investigations. Method A web-based questionnaire was provided to all TB National Focal Points. The questionnaire consisted of three parts: i) Use and integration of molecular and genomic typing data into TB surveillance; ii) Cross-border cluster investigation and international collaboration, and iii) Perception and evaluation of public health benefits of molecular and genomic typing for TB surveillance. Results Of 26 responding countries, 20 used molecular typing for TB surveillance, including nine applying WGS. The level of integration into the national surveillance was heterogeneous. Among six countries not using typing for TB surveillance, more than half planned its implementation soon. Overall, most countries perceived an added public health value of molecular typing for TB control. Concerning international cluster investigations, countries had little experience and did not have standard protocols to exchange typing data. Conclusion Our study shows a wide use of molecular and genomic typing data for TB surveillance in EU/EEA countries and reveals that transition to WGS-based typing is ongoing or is considered in most countries. However, our results also show a high heterogeneity in the use and integration of typing data for TB surveillance.

The Fourier spectrum and response spectrum characteristics in the horizontal site are first investigated in this study, and the dynamic responses of the inclined layered sites are then studied and compared to the corresponding responses of the horizontal layered site. The influence of dip angle on the response spectrum is also studied."
https://openalex.org/W2921734762,"As result of the great east Japan earthquake on March 2011 and the damages of the Fukushima Dai-ichi Nuclear Power Plant (FDNPP), huge amount of radionuclides, especially 137Cs, were released to the Japanese Pacific coast. By consequence, several marine species have been contaminated by direct uptake of radionuclides from seawater or through feeding on contaminated preys. In the present study we propose a novel radioecological modelling approach aiming to simulate the radionuclides transfer to pelagic marine species by giving to the organism body-size a key role in the model. We applied the model to estimate the 137Cs content in 14 commercially important species of the North-Western Pacific Ocean after the FDNPP accident. Firstly, we validated the model and evaluated its performance using various observed field data, and we demonstrated the importance of using such modelling approach in radioecological studies. Afterwards, we estimated some radioecological metrics, such as the maximum activity concentration, its corresponding time and the ecological half-life, which are important in assessment of the previous, current and future contamination levels of the studied species. Finally, we estimated the time duration required for each species to reach the pre-accident 137Cs activity concentrations. The results showed that the contamination levels in the planktivorous species have generally reached the pre-accident levels since about 5 years after the accident (since 2016). While in the case of the higher trophic level species, although the activity concentrations are much lower than the regulatory limit for radiocesium in seafood in Japan (100 Bq kg-1), these species still require another 6–14 years (2018–2026) to reach the pre-accident levels."
https://openalex.org/W2921900286,"Although recently the internal structure of the non-supranuchal fossa of Homo sapiens has been described and compared to that observed in the Neandertal suprainiac fossa, until now it has not been examined in any modern human children. In this study, the internal structure of this fossa in the occipital bones of three children (two aged 3‒4 years and one aged 5 years ± 16 months) and one adult individual representing recent Homo sapiens from Australia was analysed and compared to that of the Neandertal suprainiac fossa. In order to analyse the internal composition of the fossae of the examined specimens, initially, high-resolution micro-CT datasets were obtained for their occipital bones; next, 3D topographic maps of the variation in thickness of structural layers of the occipital bones were made and 2D virtual sections in the median region of these fossae were prepared. In the fossa of one immature individual, the thinning of the diploic layer characteristic of a Neandertal suprainiac fossa was firmly diagnosed. The other Neandertal-like trait, concerning the lack of substantial thinning of the external table of the bone in the region of the fossa, was established in two individuals (one child and one adult) due to the observation of an irregular pattern of the thickness of this table in the other specimens, suggesting the presence of an inflammatory process. Our study presents, for the first time, Neandertal-like traits (but not the whole set of features that justifies the autapomorphic status of the Neandertal supraniac fossa) in the internal structure of non-supranuchal fossae of some recent Homo sapiens. We discuss the phylogenetic implications of the results of our analysis and stress the reasons that use of the 3D topographic mapping method is important for the correct diagnosis of Neandertal traits of the internal structure of occipital fossae."
https://openalex.org/W2922405330,"In mammalian cells, actin, microtubules, and various types of cytoplasmic intermediate filaments respond to external stretching. Here, we investigated the underlying processes in endothelial cells plated on soft substrates from silicone elastomer. After cyclic stretch (0.13 Hz, 14% strain amplitude) for periods ranging from 5 min to 8 h, cells were fixed and double-stained for microtubules and either actin or vimentin. Cell images were analyzed by a two-step routine. In the first step, micrographs were segmented for potential fibrous structures. In the second step, the resulting binary masks were auto- or cross-correlated. Autocorrelation of segmented images provided a sensitive and objective measure of orientational and translational order of the different cytoskeletal systems. Aligning of correlograms from individual cells removed the influence of only partial alignment between cells and enabled determination of intrinsic cytoskeletal order. We found that cyclic stretching affected the actin cytoskeleton most, microtubules less, and vimentin mostly only via reorientation of the whole cell. Pharmacological disruption of microtubules had barely any influence on actin ordering. The similarity, i.e., cross-correlation, between vimentin and microtubules was much higher than the one between actin and microtubules. Moreover, prolonged cyclic stretching slightly decoupled the cytoskeletal systems as it reduced the cross-correlations in both cases. Finally, actin and microtubules were more correlated at peripheral regions of cells whereas vimentin and microtubules correlated more in central regions."

https://openalex.org/W2921220316,"A child’s endowment is a reflection of his/her genetic makeup and the conditions faced in early life. Parents build on their child’s endowment by investing resources in their child, and together, a child’s endowment and subsequent investments act as input into important later-life outcomes. A positive or negative shock to a child’s endowment can have a direct biological effect on a child’s long-term outcomes but may also affect parents’ decisions about investments in the health and human capital of their children. Using follow-up data collected several years after a randomized trial in Ghana, we explored whether maternal and child supplementation with small-quantity lipid-based nutrient supplements (SQ-LNS) throughout much of the first 1,000 days influenced parental investments in the health and human capital of their children. Across the domains of family planning, breastfeeding, health, education, and paternal financial support, we found that, in general, the intervention did not affect investments in the treated child nor his/her untreated siblings. These results suggest that given production technologies, constraints, and preferences, the intervention either did not change parents’ optimal investment strategies or that the effects of the intervention, namely increased birth size and attained length at 18 months of age, were too small for parents to perceive or to have any meaningful impact on parents’ expectations about the returns to investments in their children."
https://openalex.org/W2922270973,"In recent years, most countries around the world have faced increasing pressures in the realm of emergency management than ever before. Medical service organization selection is one of the most vital facets of emergency management. Meanwhile, during the selection process, many criteria may conflict with one another and information is uncertain, rendering decision-making processes complex. Hence, multi-objective optimization, fuzzy way and stochastic theories serve as suitable means of addressing such problems. In this paper, a fuzzy multi-objective linear model is developed to overcome medical service organization selection issues and uncertain information. Meanwhile, a fuzzy objective and weight are applied to enable the decision-maker to select suitable schemes while considering stochastic medical service demand. Moreover, real data cannot been obtained. Hence, according to actual conditions, we assume relative information. For illustrative purposes, a numerical example is presented to verify the effectiveness of the proposed model from experimental data."
https://openalex.org/W2922387850,"A new species, Manglietia pubipedunculata Q. W. Zeng & X. M. Hu (Magnoliaceae) is described and illustrated from Yunnan, China. In addition to macromorphological examination, we comparatively studied on micromorphology of leaf epidermis, leaf structure, and epidermal cell on the sclerotesta. This new species is similar to M. kwangtungensis in terms of having dense pubescence, however, their pubescence are quite different. Manglietia pubipedunculata has appressed, compressed, shorter and sparser pubescence consisting of single or two cells. Moreover, it differs from M. kwangtungensis by showing shorter and thicker peduncles, longer styles, basal carpels covered with sparsely brown appressed pubescence, and more ovules per carpel. Furthermore, the new species has thinner leaves, brown and rugged surfaces on sclerotesta, and the alveolate cell pattern consisting of pentagon or hexagon cells with papilla on secondary cell wall under the observation by SEM. The phylogenetic analysis from two nuclear PHYA and LEAFY and chloroplast trnH-psbA sequences of 11 taxa reveals that M. pubipedunculata is a distinct species."
