https://openalex.org/W2102080812,"In a declining herd, surviving deer inhabited overlapping edges of wolf-pack territories. There, wolves hunted little until desperate, in order to avoid fatal encounters with neighbors. Such encounters reduce wolf numbers and predation pressure and apparently allow surviving deer along territory edges to repopulate the area through dispersal of their prime, less vulnerable offspring into territory cores."
https://openalex.org/W2009558903,"The Libben site, a Late Woodland ossuary and occupation site from the Great Black Swamp of northern Ohio has yielded a well-preserved skeletal sample of 1327 articulated individuals. The outstanding preservation and completeness of the site and the utilization of an exhaustive aging methodology make this the largest and most comprehensively censused North American prehistoric cemetery. Survivorship data indicate a robust, successful population. Life expectancy at birth was 20 years. Among adults, male mortality was consistently higher than female, a condition possibly related to high interpersonal and intergroup aggression. Infant mortality was generally low, and a general hypothesis concerning the elevation of infant mortality and the simultaneous depression of adult mortality among aboriginal peoples after European contact is suggested."
https://openalex.org/W2073801743,"Wild colonies of greater spearnose bats were marked, censused regularly, and genotyped at three polymorphic allozyme loci. While adult composition of social units is very stable and strong polygyny results in marked changes in gene frequencies between generations, dispersal of offspring is sufficient to prevent significant genetic heterogeneities between social units. Kin selection cannot explain social cohesiveness in these highly social mammals."
https://openalex.org/W2024155140,"In a crystallized suspension of polystyrene spheres, the earth's gravitational field, acting on a vertical column of material several centimeters high, produces an elastic deformation that can be readily observed through its effect on the crystal lattice constant. This effect has been used to determine that Young's modulus for the crystalline material ranges from 1 to 3 dynes per square centimeter, depending on the concentration of spheres."
https://openalex.org/W2055991326,"Pollen influx can be used to estimate the duration of short-term depositional events. When applied to volcanic ashes, it may also provide information on the season and ecological effects of ashfall. In our initial application of the method to volcanic ashes from Lost Trail Pass, Bitterroot Mountains, Montana, we have illustrated that (i) two falls of Glacier Peak ash, which occurred about 11,250 14C years ago, were separated by 10 to 25 years; and (ii) volcanic ash from a major eruption of Mount Mazama (about 6700 14C years ago) first fell in the autumn and 4.6 centimeters of ash was deposited before the following spring. We also believe there is a reasonable probability that (i) about 1 centimeter of ash fell during the following year and about 1.7 centimeters fell the year after; (ii) in all, the sporadic primary Mazama ashfall lasted for nearly 3 years; (iii) Mazama ash resulted in low lake productivity, as measured by the occurrence of Botryococcus and Pediastrum; (iv) Mazama ash, perhaps through a mulching effect, may have produced increased vigor and pollen production in some sagebrush steppe genera; and (v) as measured by the records of fossil pollen and acid-resistant algae, effects on the aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems were short-lived. With refinement of the methods and broader geographic application, pollen influx studies may prove valuable for separating the regional and chronological details of tephra attributed to Mazama, Glacier Peak, and other Cascade Range volcanoes."
https://openalex.org/W1982748558,"Douglas fir plantlets were produced in tissue culture under defined conditions from cotyledon explants obtained from 2- to 4-week-old seedlings. Tissue pieces were cultured on the surface of a fabric tissue support (100 percent polyester) saturated with liquid nutrient medium; this facilitated periodic changes of the medium to meet the requirements at successive developmental stages without transfer of cultured tissues. Plant growth regulators were needed to stimulate adventitious bud formation. Plantlets were regenerated by rooting excised shoots at 19 degrees C on agarsolidified medium containing sucrose and the auxin naphthalene-2-acetic acid. After root initiation, plant growth regulators were removed; this resulted in stimulation of root elongation and the subsequent development of plantlets, which were then established in soil."

https://openalex.org/W1997309889,"Gemmae are generally defined as vegetative propagules. In the shoestring ferns, Vittaria, gemmae grown in the presence of mature gametophyte plants or on medium containing gibberellic acid produce antheridia in lieu of vegetative growth. This suggests that antheridial differentiation in Vittaria is controlled by a chemical antheridogen system similar to those described in other fern genera. In natural populations of Vittaria gametophytes composed primarily of long-lived individuals, gemmae may provide the only source of tissue susceptible to antheridogen action and may have evolved in response to that condition."
https://openalex.org/W2033101244,"The Hermes satellite, a joint Canadian-American program, has been used to provide a communication channel between radio telescopes in West Virginia and Ontario, for very-long-baseline interferometry (VLBI). This system makes possible instantaneous correlation of the data as well as a sensitivity substantially better than that of earlier VLBI systems, by virtue of a broader observational bandwidth. With the use of a geostationary communications satellite it is possible to eliminate the tape recorders and the most troublesome part of the postobservational data processing. A further possibility is the development of a phase-coherent interferometer."

Quantitative estimates of the feasibility of this proposal based on a particular detector configuration are presented."
