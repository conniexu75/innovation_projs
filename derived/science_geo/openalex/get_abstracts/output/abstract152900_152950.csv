https://openalex.org/W2006300948,"The members of the low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor gene family bind a broad spectrum of extracellular ligands. Traditionally, they had been regarded as mere cargo receptors that promote the endocytosis and lysosomal delivery of these ligands. However, recent genetic experiments in mice have revealed critical functions for two LDL receptor family members, the very low density lipoprotein receptor and the apoE receptor-2, in the transmission of extracellular signals and the activation of intracellular tyrosine kinases. This process regulates neuronal migration and is crucial for brain development. Signaling through these receptors requires the interaction of their cytoplasmic tails with the intracellular adaptor protein Disabled-1 (DAB1). Here, we identify an extended set of cytoplasmic proteins that might also participate in signal transmission by the LDL receptor gene family. Most of these novel proteins are adaptor or scaffold proteins that contain PID or PDZ domains and function in the regulation of mitogen-activated protein kinases, cell adhesion, vesicle trafficking, or neurotransmission. We show that binding of DAB1 interferes with receptor internalization suggesting a mechanism by which signaling through this class of receptors might be regulated. Taken together, these findings imply much broader physiological functions for the LDL receptor family than had previously been appreciated. They form the basis for the elucidation of the molecular pathways by which cells respond to the diversity of ligands that bind to these multifunctional receptors on the cell surface.

Herz J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 601-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (1058) Google Scholar). Recently, we have reported that the cytoplasmic adaptor or scaffold proteins Disabled-1 (DAB1) and FE65 interact with the cytoplasmic tails of certain LDL receptor family members (2Trommsdorff M. Borg J.P. Margolis B. Herz J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33556-33560Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar). DAB1 and FE65 have no known role in endocytosis but rather function in cellular signal transduction pathways that involve tyrosine kinases and remodeling of the cytoskeleton. LDL receptor family members do not merely bind these proteins in a fortuitous manner, they rather act in concert with these adaptors and play pivotal roles in cellular signal transduction cascades. This was revealed by the analysis of knockout animals lacking the very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) receptor and the apolipoprotein E (apoE) receptor-2 (3Trommsdorff M. Gotthardt M. Hiesberger T.

Mice lacking both receptors exhibit a phenotype that is indistinguishable from that of animals deficient for the extracellular signaling molecule Reelin (4Falconer D.S. J.

Goldowitz D. Curran T. Nature. 1997; 389: 730-733Crossref PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar), suggesting that these genes function in a linear signaling pathway. Reelin does indeed bind to both the VLDL receptor and the apoER2 but does so only weakly to the structurally closely related LDL receptor (9Hiesberger T. Trommsdorff M. Howell B.W. Goffinet A.

Yet mice lacking only one of the receptors display distinct phenotypes suggesting additional functions that cannot be compensated for by the respective other receptor. Similarly, mice deficient for Megalin, another member of the LDL receptor gene family, present with a developmental abnormality of their brains known as holoprosencephaly (11Willnow T.E. Hilpert J. Armstrong S.A. Rohlmann A. Hammer R.E. Burns D.K. Herz J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8460-8464Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar), but the molecular basis for this defect is largely unclear. All members of the gene family bind apoE, a component of cholesterol carrying lipoprotein particles. One isoform of apoE, apoE-4, has been linked to late onset Alzheimer's disease. The molecular mechanisms by which apoE predisposes to this debilitating neurodegenerative disease are also unknown but may involve signaling through LDL receptor family members (9Hiesberger T. Trommsdorff M. Howell B.W. Goffinet A. Mumby M.C. Cooper J.A. Herz J. Neuron. 1999; 24: 481-489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (785) Google Scholar, 10D'Arcangelo G. Homayouni R. Keshvara L. Rice D.S. Sheldon M. Curran T. Neuron. 1999; 24: 471-479Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (685) Google Scholar). The developmental phenotypes that are caused by genetic defects of LDL receptor family members and the role the receptors may play in the development of Alzheimer's disease are difficult to explain on the basis of impaired endocytosis of extracellular ligands alone. Rather, they suggest that these genes fulfill broad and essential roles in cellular communication such as in, but not limited to, the transmission of migratory cues in the case of Reelin, DAB1, VLDL receptor, and apoER2. It is thus likely that these genes interact with other components of the cellular signal transduction machinery besides DAB1. To allow diverse signals to be routed through a single receptor, specificity of signal transduction has to be ensured by other means. One way that nature has achieved this is through the assembly of multiprotein complexes (12Pawson T. Scott J.D. Science. 1997; 278: 2075-2080Crossref PubMed Scopus (1891) Google Scholar). Thus, a given receptor may bind multiple signaling molecules, yet activation of the appropriate intracellular signaling pathway would be dependent on the other components,e.g. co-receptors and adaptor or scaffold proteins, in the complex. Furthermore, it is unclear whether cytoplasmic adaptors that bind to the tails of LDL receptor family members interact or interfere with the endocytosis machinery. To address these questions we have searched for other cytoplasmic proteins that bind tightly to LDL receptor family tails. Our findings suggest that the role of the LDL receptor gene family in cellular signaling is not restricted to the transmission of the Reelin signal to cellular tyrosine kinases but may also involve modulation of MAP kinase activity and cell adhesion. We have investigated whether the endocytosis machinery and cellular signaling by DAB1 employ the same or overlapping sequence motifs by overexpressing DAB1 in cultured cells and determining its effect on the cellular binding and endocytosis of LDL. For the LDL receptor example, we show that adaptor binding to the tail can compete with the endocytosis machinery. This suggests a molecular mechanism by which initiation of endocytosis may serve to turn off periodically cellular signals that are routed through this class of multifunctional cell surface receptors.

All LDL receptor family cytoplasmic tail LexA fusion proteins were constructed using the pLexA vector (MATCHMAKER system,CLONTECH). The cytoplasmic domains andDab1 were amplified by PCR from human and mouse brain 1st strand cDNA or cDNA clones. PCR products were subcloned into the EcoRI and NcoI sites of pLexA for the Megalin and VLDL receptor and with EcoRI and BamHI sites for the other receptors. The Dab1 cDNA (2Trommsdorff M. Borg J.P. Margolis B. Herz J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33556-33560Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar) was transferred via EcoRI and SalI into theEcoRI- and XhoI-digested prey plasmid pB42AD (MATCHMAKER system, CLONTECH). All constructs were sequenced after cloning, and all bait vectors were tested for self-activation. Bait and prey vectors were cotransfected into yeast cells (leucine auxotrophic strain EGY48) using the LiAc method as described in the MATCHMAKER manual (CLONTECH). The two-hybrid assay used two reporters (LEU2 and LacZ) under the control of LexA operators. Cells were spread on selective plates (His−, Leu−, and Trp−) and grown for 3 days. Single clones were grown on selective plates in patches and harvested after 2–3 days. To recover DNA from yeast, cells were resuspended in 50 μl of STES (0.5m NaCl, 0.2 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 0.01m EDTA, 1% SDS). Glass beads were added and the cells vortexed vigorously. After addition of 20 μl of H2O and 60 μl of phenol/chloroform, cells were vortexed for 1 more min and centrifuged (14,000 × g, 5 min). The aqueous phase was collected, and the DNA was precipitated with ethanol. DNA from positive clones was retransformed into DH5α and checked by DNA sequencing. Yeast mating was performed after transformation of LexA plasmids into the yeast strain YM4271 following the instructions in the MATCHMAKER manual (CLONTECH). GST fusion plasmids of DAB1 and FE65 have been described previously (2Trommsdorff M. Borg J.P. Margolis B. Herz J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33556-33560Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar). Positive clones derived from the yeast two-hybrid screen were cloned into pGEX-4T1 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) using the flankingEcoRI and XhoI restriction sites and verified by sequencing. Fusion proteins were expressed in BL21 or BL21 codon+ bacteria (Stratagene) following induction by 1 mmisopropyl-thio-d-galactopyranoside for 5 h. Proteins were recovered by Triton lysis (PBS with 1% Triton X-100, and Protease Inhibitor mixture) and purified using glutathione-agarose beads. Liver and kidney membrane extracts from 129 SVJ mice were prepared as described previously (15Kowal R.C. Herz J. Weisgraber K.H. Mahley R.W. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 10771-10779Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Lysates were incubated with 50 μl of glutathione-agarose and 10 μg of the respective purified GST fusion protein for 6 h at 4 °C. Glutathione beads were washed rapidly three times in 150 mmNaCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 2 mm each MgCl2, CaCl2, and MnCl2 for 10 min. SDS sample buffer was added to the supernatant or beads. Proteins were separated by electrophoresis on 4% (for Megalin) and 8% (for LRP) SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under nonreducing conditions and analyzed by immunoblotting using specific antibodies (11Willnow T.E. Hilpert J. Armstrong S.A. Rohlmann A. Hammer R.E. Burns D.K. Herz J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8460-8464Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar, 13Herz J. Hamann U. Rogne S. Myklebost O. Gausepohl H. Stanley K.K. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 4119-4127Crossref PubMed Scopus (737) Google Scholar) and ECL detection. Templates used for in situhybridization were amplified from mouse cDNA clones for LRP, Megalin, and apoER2, and from the yeast-two-hybrid clones using the pB42AD2 primer in combination with primers specific for individual interacting clone (meg8, Semcap-1; meg11, Jip-1; meg20, Jip-2). PCR products were cloned into pCR2.1-TOPO or pCRII-TOPO (Invitrogen) and sequenced. For each labeling reaction, 0.5 μg of linearized template was transcribed using T7 RNA polymerase (Ambion, TX) and 100 μCi of [α-33P]UTP (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). To determine the expression pattern of apoER2, LRP, Megalin, SEMCAP-1, JIP-1, and JIP-2, in situ hybridizations on sagittal sections of wild type mouse embryos at day 13.5 postcoitum were performed as described previously (3Trommsdorff M. Gotthardt M. Hiesberger T. Shelton J. Stockinger W. Nimpf J. Hammer R.E. Richardson J.A. Herz J. Cell. 1999; 97: 689-701Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1083) Google Scholar). Animal use had been reviewed and approved by the University of Texas Southwestern Institutional Review Committee for animal use. Briefly, embryos were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, embedded in paraffin, and sectioned at 5-μm intervals. After removal of paraffin and rehydration slides were treated with Pronase (20 μg/ml Pronase for 7.5 min) and acetylated (0.1 m triethanolamine HCl, pH 7.5, 0.25% acetic anhydride for 5 min). Slides were hybridized for 12 h at 55 °C in a solution containing 50% formamide, 0.3% dextran sulfate, 1× Denhardt's solution, 0.5 mg/ml tRNA, and 7.5 × 106 cpm/ml riboprobe. After hybridization, slides were washed in 5× SSC, 100 mm DTT at 65 °C for 30 min, and covered with K.5 nuclear emulsion (Ilford) before exposure at 4 °C for 21 to 35 days. Cell lines containing the wild type LDL receptor (TR715-19) and the LDL receptor containing a stop codon in the cytoplasmic domain at position 807 (TR807-3) have been published previously (16Van Driel I.R. Goldstein J.L. Sudhof T.C. Brown M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 17443-17449Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Chen W.-J. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 3116-3123Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The plasmid pcDNA3.1/ZEO DAB555 contains the mouse Dab1 cDNA under control of the cytomegalovirus promoter in the pcDNA3.1/ZEO(+) vector (Invitrogen) and was used to create DAB1 overexpressing cell lines derived from TR715-19 and TR807-3, designated TR 3097 and TR 3098, respectively. Multiple clones were generated after transfection and Zeocin selection and analyzed for levels of LDLR and DAB1 expression by immunoblotting using specific antibodies and ECL detection. All cell lines were maintained in Dulbecco's minimal essential medium, supplemented with 5% (v/v) fetal calf serum (Life Technologies, Inc.) and penicillin/streptomycin. For uptake, binding, and degradation assays, the cells were plated in 6-well plates at a cell density of 60,000 cells/well in Medium A (1:1 mixture of Dulbecco's minimal essential medium and Ham's F-12 medium) supplemented with 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin sulfate, and with 5% (v/v) fetal calf serum. On day 2, the cells were washed twice with PBS and refed with Medium A containing 5% (v/v) newborn calf lipoprotein-deficient serum, 10 μmcompactin, and 100 μm mevalonate. On day 3 the cells were washed twice with PBS and switched to Medium B (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (minus glutamine) containing 2 mg/ml fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin) containing 2 μg/ml 125I-LDL. After 1, 3, and 5 h, the medium and the cells were harvested, and specific surface binding, uptake, and degradation were measured as described previously (17Chen W.-J. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 3116-3123Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To identify other adaptor proteins besides DAB1 and FE65 that interact with the cytoplasmic tails of LDL receptor family members, we performed a series of yeast two-hybrid screens of various tail bait constructs against a panel of commercially available libraries (described under “Experimental Procedures”). A list of the genes that were identified in these screens and that survived specificity testing are shown in Table I. Most of these genes have known functions that are related to cell adhesion, cell activation, reorganization of the cytoskeleton, and neurotransmission. DAB1 has previously been shown to bind to the cytoplasmic tails of LDL receptor family members (2Trommsdorff M. Borg J.P. Margolis B. Herz J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33556-33560Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar, 3Trommsdorff M. Gotthardt M. Hiesberger T. Shelton J. Stockinger W. Nimpf J. Hammer R.E. Richardson J.A. Herz J. Cell. 1999; 97: 689-701Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1083) Google Scholar). JIP-1 and JIP-2 are scaffolding proteins for components of the Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) signaling pathway (18Yasuda J. Whitmarsh A.J. Cavanagh J. Sharma M. Davis R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7245-7254Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar), and JIP-1 was recently shown to also interact with p190 rhoGEF (19Meyer D. Liu A. Margolis B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35113-35118Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). SEMCAP-1 is an adaptor protein that can bind to the cytoplasmic tails of membrane proteins such as SEMF (20Wang L.H. Kalb R.G. Strittmatter S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14137-14146Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) and LDL receptor family members (this study) but also to the cytoplasmic and membrane-associated RGS protein GAIP (21De Vries L. Lou X. Zhao G. Zheng B. Farquhar M.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 12340-12345Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). MINT2, or X11-like, is another scaffold protein that interacts with the cytoplasmic tail of the amyloid precursor protein via its PTB domain and is associated with neuritic plaques in Alzheimer's disease (22McLoughlin D.M. Irving N.G. Brownlees J. Brion J.P. Leroy K. Miller C.C. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1999; 11: 1988-1994Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). CAPON is a PTB domain-containing adaptor protein that was shown to bind neuronal nitric-oxide synthase (nNOS) and is thought to dislodge nNOS from the postsynaptic density protein PSD-95, thus inactivating the enzyme (23Jaffrey S.R. Snowman A.M. Eliasson M.J. Cohen N.A. Snyder S.H. Neuron. 1998; 20: 115-124Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). PSD-95, a scaffolding protein that organizes active components of the postsynaptic neurotransmission machinery such as glutamate receptors, potassium channels, kinases, and nNOS into functional microdomains (24Sheng M. Pak D.T. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1999; 868: 483-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) was also found to interact directly with LDL receptor family tails. Although it does not contain a PTB domain, the integrin cytoplasmic domain associated protein-1 (ICAP-1) binds to an NPXY sequence motif in the integrin tail (25Zhang X.A. Hemler M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11-19Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 26Chang D.D. Wong C. Smith H. Liu J. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 1149-1157Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar) and thus presumably also to the NPXY motifs that are present in the cytoplasmic tails of all LDL receptor family members (2Trommsdorff M. Borg J.P. Margolis B. Herz J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33556-33560Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar). OMP25 is an outer mitochondrial membrane protein that contains a PDZ domain and thereby interacts with the inositol phosphatase synaptojanin, a protein thought to be involved in the recycling of synaptic vesicles (27Nemoto Y. De Camilli P. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2991-3006Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Another protein that is homologous to phosphatidylinositol 4,5-kinase and therefore is presumably involved in inositol metabolism was also identified in our screen. A close homologue of the cytoskeletal protein Talin, the α subunit of the brain-specific sodium channel 3 and APC10, a component of the anaphase promoting complex also bound to LDL receptor family tails by yeast-two-hybrid interaction.Table IIdentification of proteins that interact with cytoplasmic domains of the LDL receptor gene familyNameClonesIndependentInsert sizeFunction/pathwaySEMCAP-1521500G-protein signaling?

Open table in a new tab Various complete and truncated cytoplasmic domains of the LDLR gene family were used to screen yeast two-hybrid libraries. Positive clones contained protein sequences that relate LRP and Megalin to signal transduction via kinases, G-proteins, ion channels, NO, the cytoskeleton, and synapses. PIP4,5-kinase indicates phosphatidylinositol 4,5-kinase. Next, we determined the binding specificity of each of the proteins that had been identified in the initial screens against a panel of bait constructs containing the whole or part of the cytoplasmic tails of the presently known LDL receptor family members. The tail sequences contained in these bait constructs are shown in Fig.1 A. The apoER2 tail was tested with (+) and without (−) its alternatively spliced insert. For Megalin and for LRP the complete tails and parts thereof containing a single NPXY motif were tested separately. DAB1 bound strongly to all the LDL receptor family tails but only to one of the NPXY motifs in the LRP and Megalin tail (LRPB and MegA, respectively). LRP and Megalin have the longest cytoplasmic tails that contain several potential adaptor binding motifs and thus bound most of the proteins. In contrast, the LDL receptor and the VLDL receptor bound only DAB1, as noted previously (2Trommsdorff M. Borg J.P. Margolis B. Herz J. J. Biol.

Interestingly, the apoER2 tail containing the alternatively spliced insert bound the scaffold proteins JIP-1, JIP-2, and PSD-95, whereas the tail without this insert did not. This suggests that the alternative splicing of the apoER2 tail has important regulatory functions and may determine the ability of apoER2 to activate MAP kinase-dependent signals.

Next, we sought to determine whether the protein interactions we had found in the yeast two-hybrid screen could be reproduced by a different approach, such as a biochemical pulldown assay (Fig. 2). The respective cDNA fragments were cut out from the yeast prey vector and cloned into a bacterial GST expression vector. GST fusion proteins were incubated with membrane extracts from liver (LRP) and kidney (Megalin). GST alone (lane 1) served as a negative control, and DAB1 (lane 12) and FE65 (lane 13) served as positive controls for interactions of fusion proteins with LRP. Binding of FE65 was specific for LRP (lane 13), and DAB1 bound to both receptors, consistent with the two-hybrid results (Fig. 1 B). All other fusion proteins tested, with the exception of the Talin homologue (lane 6) and MINT2 (lane 10), bound to both native Megalin and LRP in membrane extracts, although the interaction of either tail with CAPON (lane 8) was weak in this assay.

The biochemical mechanism behind this remarkable metabolic achievement has attracted scientific interest since the heat-producing capacity of brown adipose tissue was first established (5Smith R.E. Physiologist. 1961; 4: 113Google Scholar). It is today generally accepted that the heat-producing ability of brown adipocytes is fully or partly a consequence of the presence in the mitochondria of these cells of the functionally protonophoric protein uncoupling protein-1 (UCP1)1 (thermogenin) (for reviews, see Refs. 6Nicholls D.G.

Nature. 1997; 387: 90-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (1067) Google Scholar) that it has become possible to approach some basic questions in the cellular physiology of brown adipocytes. These questions include whether the UCP1 mechanism is the only thermogenic mechanism of significance within the brown adipocytes and whether the mere presence of UCP1 within the brown adipocytes in itself conveys a state of semi-uncoupling to the mitochondria within the cells (as has been observed when UCP1 has been ectopically expressed (11Fleury C.

Also the question of the nature of the intracellular physiological activator of UCP1 has become timely, because it has been observed that the presence of UCP1 in isolated brown fat mitochondria does not seem to increase their sensitivity to the de-energizing action of fatty acids (15Matthias A. Jacobsson A. Cannon B. Nedergaard J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28150-28160Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), although fatty acids have generally been believed to be the activators of UCP1 (6Nicholls D.G. Locke R.M. Physiol. Rev. 1984; 64: 1-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (1335) Google Scholar, 7Nedergaard J. Cannon B. Ernster L. New Comprehensive Biochemistry. 23.

Acta. 1999; 1415: 271-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). Through analysis of brown adipocytes isolated from UCP1-ablated mice, we present evidence here that no other adrenergic thermogenic mechanism exists in brown adipocytes except that associated with UCP1, and that UCP1 in its unstimulated state, when entopically expressed and under physiological control, does not induce a state of partial “uncoupling” to the mitochondria, at least not observable at the present degree of resolution. We also suggest that the activator of UCP1 is most likely not the free fatty acids themselves but a metabolite thereof.Further, brown adipose tissue in the UCP1-ablated mice demonstrates very high expression levels of the UCP1 family members UCP2 and UCP3 (10Enerbäck S. Jacobsson A. Simpson E.M. Guerra C. Yamashita H. Harper M.-E. Kozak L.P. Nature. 1997; 387: 90-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (1067) Google Scholar, 15Matthias A. Jacobsson A. Cannon B. Nedergaard J. J.

Ailhaud G. Guy-Grand B. Progress in Obesity Research 8. John Libbey, London1999: 13-26Google Scholar), probably the highest combined level in any mammalian tissue. It has therefore been possible to analyze theUcp1(−/−) brown adipocytes also for signs of thermogenic (or uncoupling) effects that could be associated with the very high entopic expression of the genes for these novel uncoupling proteins, as suggested (17Jaburek M. Varecha M. Gimeno R.E. Dembski M. Jezek P. Zhang M. Burn P. Tartaglia L.A. Garlid K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26003-26007Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). We found, however, that this high entopic expression was not associated with any observable signs of mitochondrial uncoupling or thermogenesis, in contrast to what is observed when these proteins have been ectopically expressed. Thus, UCP2 or UCP3 do not substitute for UCP1 as adrenergically stimulated thermogenic proteins in brown adipocytes, even when the cellular activation mechanism for thermogenesis is intact. We therefore conclude that UCP1 distinguishes itself from the other (probably more ancient (18Stuart J.A. Harper J.A. Brindle K.M. Brand M.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1413: 50-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar)) uncoupling protein family members by being the only one that can convey to a mammalian cell a thermogenic response to adrenergic stimulation.DISCUSSIONIn the present investigation, we have demonstrated that the absence of UCP1 led to a complete loss of thermogenic capacity of isolated brown fat cells, both when they were stimulated by addition of the physiological activator norepinephrine and when thermogenesis was induced by fatty acid addition. Besides demonstrating the essential role of UCP1 for nonshivering thermogenesis in brown fat cells, these experiments also provide new information on the basal and stimulated activity of UCP1 when entopically expressed and information concerning the nature of the intracellular physiological activator of UCP1. They also indicate that UCP2 and UCP3 do not substitute for UCP1 as thermogenic proteins in these cells.No UCP1-independent Adrenergic Thermogenic Process Exists in Brown AdipocytesFrom previous studies, particularly in isolated brown fat mitochondria (reviewed e.g. in Refs. 6Nicholls D.G. Locke R.M. Physiol. Rev. 1984; 64: 1-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (1335) Google Scholar, 7Nedergaard J. Cannon B. Ernster L. New Comprehensive Biochemistry. 23. Elsevier, Amsterdam1992: 385-420Google Scholar, 8Garlid K.D. Jaburek M. Jezek P. FEBS Lett. 1998; 438: 10-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 9Klingenberg M. Huang S.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1415: 271-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar), it has been inferred that activation of UCP1 is a prerequisite for thermogenesis. Provided that this axiom, that brown fat thermogenesis occurs only through the UCP1-mediated mechanism, is accepted per se, the outcome of the present experiments, i.e. that it is not possible to elicit thermogenesis in brown fat cells from the UCP1-ablated mice, may be said to be what would be expected. However, it may be pointed out that this total elimination of the thermogenic response to norepinephrine in the Ucp1(−/−) cells finally resolves experimentally the long standing principal issue of whether other mechanisms could be responsible for, or at least contribute to, the thermogenic response to norepinephrine in brown fat cells. Possible extramitochondrial thermogenic processes that have been discussed include norepinephrine-induced activation of the plasma membrane Na+/K+-ATPase (directly or indirectly because of norepinephrine-induced plasma membrane depolarization and increased Na+ influx), an ATP-utilizing substrate cycling (of fatty acids/triglyceride or glucose/glucose 6-phosphate), glycerol 3-phosphate cycling, peroxisomal fatty acid degradation, and an α1-adrenoreceptor-induced, “coupled” respiration.It is the clear outcome of the present experiments that no such additional UCP1-independent adrenergic thermogenic component exists (although auxillary effects of these processes cannot be ruled out by the present experiments). Other cellular processes clearly make only an extremely minor contribution to norepinephrine-induced thermogenesis, as compared with that of UCP1. Considering the number of metabolic processes not supposedly linked to UCP1 activation that are stimulated by norepinephrine in these cells (e.g. ion fluxes), it is indeed remarkable that there is only such a small norepinephrine-induced UCP1-independent increase in oxygen consumption.When Entopically Expressed, UCP1 Is Not Innately an Overtly Active Mitochondrial De-energizerIt is clear from the present experiments that the entopic expression of UCP1 in the mitochondria within brown fat cells does not lead to a measurable increase in basal metabolism of these cells. In other words, the large proton (equivalent)-conducting activity of UCP1 does not manifest itself unless the cells are externally stimulated, physiologically or with fatty acids. The low respiratory rate in unstimulated cells is not because of a lack of substrate, as the addition of the adequate exogenous substrate pyruvate addition is without effect and as FCCP increases the respiratory rate even in UCP1-containing cells.The lack of overt innate uncoupling activity of UCP1 in situimplies that when brown fat-derived nonshivering thermogenesis is not needed, there is no leakage through the system and thus no waste of energy. It will be noted that in this respect the behavior of UCP1 when entopically expressed is in contrast to its properties when it is ectopically expressed in yeast cells (or in HeLa cells (41Li B. Holloszy J.O. Semenkovich C.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17534-17540Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar)). Indeed, when UCP1 is expressed in certain yeast strains, these strains have decreased viability and growth rate (11Fleury C. Neverova M. Collins S. Raimbault S. Champigny O. Levi-Meyrueis C.

This loss of viability, associated with a marked decrease in mitochondrial membrane potential as estimated within the yeast cells (11Fleury C. Neverova M. Collins S. Raimbault S. Champigny O.

FEBS Lett. 1999; 449: 129-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), has been interpreted to indicate that in these yeast cells, UCP1 is functionally correctly inserted in the mitochondria. However, the present experiments demonstrate that this type of high innate uncoupling is not a property of UCP1 when it is entopically expressed. Rather, when UCP1 is functionally correctly inserted in its native environment, no overt innate uncoupling effect is expected. Why UCP1 behaves differently in this respect when entopically and ectopically expressed is not known. One possibility would be that brown fat cells possess an endogenous inhibitor of UCP1 activity unique to these cells; another possibility would be that the yeast expression is so high that the normal functioning of the mitochondria is disturbed.The Nature of the Intracellular Physiological ActivatorIn this investigation, the presence of UCP1 has been demonstrated to be essential not only for norepinephrine to elicit thermogenesis but also for added fatty acids to accomplish this. In this respect, the present results may initially be considered to be discrepant with our earlier observations in isolated brown fat mitochondria, where the uncoupling effect of fatty acids was demonstrated not to be UCP1-dependent (15Matthias A. Jacobsson A. Cannon B. Nedergaard J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28150-28160Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). However, the mitochondrial and cellular observations may rather be analyzed together, as done below, and through this may bring further insight to a basic question in the cellular physiology of brown adipose tissue: the nature of the signaling process leading from adrenergic receptor activation to acute UCP1 activation.There are a number of suggestions in the literature as to the nature of this “intracellular physiological activator.” Some of the candidates for the activator are summarized in Fig.7.One model (Fig. 7 A) distinguishes itself from models B–D in that the state of UCP1 in the unstimulated cell is differently formulated. According to this hypothesis, it is visualized that UCP1 is innately in an uninhibited state because it is considered not to be exposed to purine nucleotides (that inhibit UCP1 activity in experiments performed with isolated brown fat mitochondria and with isolated UCP1, as reviewed in e.g. Refs. 6Nicholls D.G. Locke R.M. Physiol. Rev. 1984; 64: 1-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (1335) Google Scholar and 7Nedergaard J. Cannon B. Ernster L. New Comprehensive Biochemistry. 23. Elsevier, Amsterdam1992: 385-420Google Scholar). In this hypothesis, the activator may be suggested to be free fatty acids (this suggestion is based on the necessity of fatty acids for UCP1 functioning in ectopic and reconstituted system; however, it will be remembered that added fatty acids are apparently not necessary for UCP1 to function in situ, i.e. in isolated brown fat mitochondria (15Matthias A. Jacobsson A. Cannon B. Nedergaard J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28150-28160Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar)). Thus, in unstimulated cells, there should be so little fatty acid available (that functions in this formulation as a co-factor) that UCP1 is unfunctional even though it is uninhibited. During stimulation, lipolysis leads to increased fatty acid levels and these, in this model, are the co-factors necessary to make UCP1 functional. Based on the data presented here alone, this model cannot be refuted, but the premises for this supposition may be challenged. The inhibitory so-called GDP-binding site on UCP1 has an affinity for free purine nucleotides of about 1 μm (45Sundin U. Cannon B. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. 1980; 65B: 463-471Google Scholar, 46Rafael J. Pampel I. Wang X. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 223: 971-980Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The total concentration of purine di- and triphosphate nucleotides in the cytosol is probably in the order of millimolar, but the free concentrations are lower because of the presence of Mg2+-chelated forms that are unable to inhibit UCP1 (46Rafael J. Pampel I. Wang X. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 223: 971-980Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). However, if about equimolar concentrations of Mg2+ and purine nucleotides are found in the cytosol, about 2–4% of total purine nucleotide would be in the free form (according to Ref. 47Brooks S.P.J. Storey K.B. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 201: 119-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar), corresponding to some 50–100 μm free nucleotide, i.e. a concentration widely in excess of that needed for full UCP1 inhibition. It is therefore difficult to see how UCP1 could be in an uninhibited state within the cell. It is also notable that in this hypothesis, the GDP-binding site on UCP1 is devoid of any regulatory role in thermogenesis. Thus, although the present experiments cannot rule out this hypothesis, it does not seem to fulfil other criteria for an activation process.In contrast, the basis for the hypotheses in Fig. 7, B—D,is that UCP1 activity is inhibited in the resting state because of the effect of cytosolic purine nucleotides (ATP, ADP, GTP, and GDP together); this point of view is based on the behavior of UCP1 in isolated brown fat mitochondria (as reviewed in e.g. Refs.6Nicholls D.G. Locke R.M. Physiol. Rev. 1984; 64: 1-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (1335) Google Scholar, 7Nedergaard J. Cannon B. Ernster L. New Comprehensive Biochemistry. 23. Elsevier, Amsterdam1992: 385-420Google Scholar, 8Garlid K.D. Jaburek M. Jezek P. FEBS Lett. 1998; 438: 10-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 9Klingenberg M. Huang S.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1415: 271-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). In this case, an activator must therefore somehow overcome this inhibition.According to one group of hypotheses (Fig. 7 B), norepinephrine generates an activator of UCP1 independent of its action on hormone-sensitive lipase (e.g. cytosolic alkanization). This activator then overcomes the purine nucleotide inhibition. Considering the data presented here, that stimulation by added fatty acids is UCP1-dependent, the postulation of a further, nonlipolysis-related, activator would seem unnecessarily complex.Alternatively, the intracellular physiological activator may be a product of lipolysis. This could be the released free fatty acids themselves (Fig. 7 C). This is presently the prevalent hypothesis for norepinephrine activation of thermogenesis (6Nicholls D.G. Locke R.M. Physiol. Rev. 1984; 64: 1-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (1335) Google Scholar, 48Gonzalez-Barroso M.M. Fleury C. Bouillaud F. Nicholls D.G. Rial E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15528-15532Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The findings presented here do not in themselves contradict such a proposal, but this hypothesis is made less likely based on our studies of isolated brown fat mitochondria, where we were unable to distinguish a UCP1-dependent de-energization induced by free fatty acids (15Matthias A. Jacobsson A. Cannon B. Nedergaard J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28150-28160Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). As the de-energization observed in the isolated brown fat mitochondria was UCP1-independent, it probably merely represented the general uncoupling effect of fatty acids observed in any mitochondrial preparation (37Wojtczak L. Schönfeld P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1183: 41-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar, 38Skulachev V.P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1363: 100-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (810) Google Scholar), and the effect may therefore even be considered artifactual. Therefore these mitochondrial observations make it unlikely that fatty acids are the direct activators of UCP1 within the cell; another activator would seem to be necessary. A hypothesis for an activation scheme, based on the fact that fatty acids added to the cells stimulate thermogenesis in a UCP1-dependent way (Fig.5), is presented in D. However, it may be wondered why fatty acids, that clearly function as UCP1-independent uncouplers in isolated brown fat mitochondria (15Matthias A. Jacobsson A. Cannon B. Nedergaard J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28150-28160Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), are unable to uncouple in an UCP1-independent way when the same mitochondria are confined to cells. A possibility is that the high levels of fatty acid-binding proteins found in these cells (49Daikoku T. Shinohara Y. Shima A. Yamazaki N. Terada H. FEBS Lett. 1997; 410: 383-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) do not allow cytosolic free fatty acid levels to become sufficiently high to reach the probably unphysiological levels necessary for UCP1-independent uncoupling of the mitochondria within the cells.In view of the results presented here, that fatty acid uncoupling is UCP1-dependent in cells in combination with the fact that fatty acid in themselves were apparently unable to activate UCP1 in isolated brown fat mitochondria (15Matthias A. Jacobsson A. Cannon B. Nedergaard J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28150-28160Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), it would seem most plausible to propose that the activation sequence in the cells involves adrenergic stimulation of lipolysis and thus intracellular release of fatty acids. However, it may be suggested that it is not the released fatty acids themselves that activate UCP1 but rather a fatty acid metabolite (in a broad sense) (Fig. 7 D); this metabolite would be formed irrespective of whether the fatty acids are of endogenous or exogenous origin. The nature of such an activating metabolite is presently unknown. However, one downstream product of fatty acid metabolism, fatty acyl-CoA esters, can compete in isolated mitochondria with purine nucleotides bound to UCP1 and increase ion transport through the protein, i.e. activate UCP1 (50Cannon B.

In the yeast systems, ectopic expression of UCP2 or UCP3 led to poor growth, increased oxygen consumption, and to heat being released. A characteristic for these systems with ectopic expression was also that a very high degree of mitochondrial uncoupling was observed (i.e. a very much lowered mitochondrial membrane potential within the cells) and this has been understood as being the reason for the poor growth of the yeast strains.Serendipitously, the present experiments may be helpful in establishing whether these conclusions from experiments with ectopically expressed UCP2/UCP3 are also valid when UCP2/UCP3 are entopically expressed. This is because in the brown adipose tissue of the UCP1-ablated animals, high expression levels of UCP2/UCP3 are found (10Enerbäck S. Jacobsson A. Simpson E.M. Guerra C. Yamashita H. Harper M.-E.

Genet. 1996; 49: 124-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), like BS, are characterized by chromosomal instability suggesting that DNA helicases are important caretakers of the human genome with specialized roles in pathways of DNA metabolism. Biochemical studies have shown that the BLM protein is a DNA-stimulated ATPase and ATP-dependent helicase, catalyzing strand displacement of short and medium length oligonucleotides (≤91 bp) from partial duplex substrates with a 3′ to 5′ polarity (23Karow J.K. Chakraverty R.K. Hickson I.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30611-30614Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). BLM helicase preferentially unwinds a G4 DNA substrate consisting of four guanine-rich strands stabilized by Hoogsteen bonding (24Sun H. Karow J.K. Hickson I.D. Maizels N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27587-27592Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar). Electron microscopy analysis has shown that BLM protein forms oligomeric rings in solution (25Karow J.K. Newman R.H. Freemont P.S. Hickson I.D. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 597-600Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Size exclusion chromatography data indicate that the majority of enzymatically active BLM has an apparent molecular mass of >700 kDa, which is consistent with an oligomeric structure for BLM (25Karow J.K. Newman R.H. Freemont P.S. Hickson I.D. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 597-600Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Aside from these structural and biochemical data, molecular details of the interactions of BLM protein with other proteins and biological DNA substrates remain to be defined. The molecular deficiencies involved in the clinical phenotype of BS presumably reflect an impaired function of the BLM protein in a pathway of nucleic acid metabolism. Transfection of the wild-type BLM gene into BS cells reduces the frequency of sister chromatid exchanges (26Neff N.F. Ellis N.A. Ye T.Z. Noonan J. Huang K. Sanz M. Proytcheva M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 665-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Mutant alleles of BLM found in individuals with clinical BS encode BLM protein that is devoid of DNA helicase activity and fails to reduce the high sister chromatid exchanges in transfected BS cells (26Neff N.F. Ellis N.A. Ye T.Z. Noonan J. Huang K. Sanz M. Proytcheva M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 665-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 27Bahr A. De Graeve F. Kedinger C. Chatton B. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 2565-2571Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). These studies provide evidence that the enzymatic activity of BLM is important for its cellular function. In an effort to better understand the mechanistic aspects of the BLM catalytic activities, we have further characterized the catalytic activities of the BLM protein. Our results show that BLM unwinds short DNA duplexes (≤71 bp) but is severely compromised on DNA duplexes ≥259 bp. The poor unwinding of BLM helicase on relatively long DNA duplex substrates suggested to us that additional protein factor(s) might convert the helicase into a more processive enzyme. A good candidate to serve as an accessory factor to BLM helicase is the heterotrimeric single-stranded DNA-binding protein RPA that has been implicated in replication, recombination, and DNA repair (28Wold M.S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 61-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (1161) Google Scholar). Evidence indicates that RPA modulates these processes by specific protein-protein and protein-DNA interactions. We have recently demonstrated that a specific functional and physical interaction exists between human RPA and WRN helicase (29Brosh Jr., R.M. Orren D.K. Nehlin J.O. Ravn P.H. Kenny M.K. Machwe A. Bohr V.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18341-18350Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). WRN helicase was found to be capable of unwinding long DNA duplexes up to 849 bp in a reaction dependent on hRPA. The notion that RPA may coordinately function with BLM helicase in vivo is supported by the recent finding that BLM colocalizes with RPA in meiotic prophase nuclei of mammalian spermatocytes (30Walpita D. Plug A.W. Neff N.F. German J. Ashley T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 5622-5627Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Colocalization of BLM and RPA at the synaptonemal complex of homologously synapsed autosomal bivalents suggests that these foci mark sites of ssDNA synaptic-related meiotic activity. The interactive roles of BLM and hRPA on synapsed meiotic bivalents are undefined but likely to involve the catalytic activity of BLM protein. In this study we have shown that RPA is required to support BLM helicase activity on a relatively long DNA duplex of 259-bp. Two heterologous SSBs, ESSB and gp32, failed to substitute for RPA. This functional interaction was further substantiated by the demonstration of a physical interaction between hRPA and BLM. This interaction, and colocalization of the two proteins in meiotic cells, suggests that BLM and RPA function together in a pathway of DNA metabolism such as recombination or replication. Recombinant hexahistidine-tagged BLM protein was overexpressed in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and purified as described previously (25Karow J.K. Newman R.H. Freemont P.S. Hickson I.D. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 597-600Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). hRPA containing all three subunits (RPA70, RPA32, and RPA14) was purified as described previously (31Kenny M.K. Schlegel U. Furneaux H. Hurwitz J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 7693-7700Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). S. cerevisiae replication protein A (scRPA) was a generous gift of Drs. Dan Bean and Steven Matson, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill. ESSB was purchased from Promega. T4 gp32 was from U. S. Biochemical Corp. Restriction endonuclease HaeIII was obtained from New England Biolabs. Klenow enzyme was obtained from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. DNase I was from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. BSA type V was from ICN Biochemicals. M13mp18 ssDNA was from New England Biolabs. The 28-mer oligonucleotide 5′-TCCCAGTCACGACGTTGTAAAACGACGG-3′ was from Life Technologies, Inc. M13mp18 RFI was prepared as described previously (32Lechner R.L. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 11185-11196Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). (dT)∼263 and ATP were from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. (dT)∼900 was from Midland Certified Reagent Co. [3H]ATP was from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, and [α-32P]dCTP was from NEN Life Science Products. The 71-, 259-, and 851-bp M13mp18 partial duplex substrates were constructed as described previously (29Brosh Jr., R.M. Orren D.K. Nehlin J.O. Ravn P.H. Kenny M.K. Machwe A. Bohr V.A. J. Biol.

Duplex DNA fragments (69-, 257-, and 849-bp) from the HaeIII digest of M13mp18 replicative form were purified by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and electroelution. The desired restriction fragment (100 ng) and M13mp18 ssDNA circle (2 μg) were incubated together in an annealing reaction. The resulting partial duplex was labeled at its 3′ terminus in a fill-in reaction with [32P]dCTP and Klenow enzyme. The 30-bp M13mp18 partial duplex substrate was constructed with a 28-mer complementary to positions 6296–6323 in M13mp18. The 28-mer was annealed to M13mp18 ssDNA circle and labeled at its 3′ end as described above. Partial duplex DNA substrates were purified by gel filtration column chromatography using Bio-Gel A-5M resin (Bio-Rad). Helicase assay reaction mixtures (20 μl) contained 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 5 mmMgCl2, 5 mm ATP, 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 50 mm NaCl, and the indicated amounts of BLM helicase and/or single-stranded DNA-binding protein. The concentration of the 30-, 71-, 259-, and 851-bp partial duplex helicase substrates in the reaction mixture was approximately 2 μm (nucleotide). Reactions were initiated by the addition of BLM protein and incubated at 37 °C for the indicated times. Reactions were terminated by the addition of 10 μl of 50 mm EDTA, 40% glycerol, 0.9% SDS, 0.1% bromphenol blue, 0.1% xylene cyanol. The products of helicase reactions with the 30-, 71-, 259-, and 851-bp partial duplex substrates were resolved on 12, 8, 6, and 6% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gels, respectively, as described previously (29Brosh Jr., R.M.

Radiolabeled DNA species in polyacrylamide gels were visualized using a PhosphorImager or film autoradiography and quantitated using the ImageQuant software (Molecular Dynamics). The percent helicase substrate unwound was calculated by the following formula: % displacement = 100 × P/(S + P). P is the product volume and S is the substrate volume. The values for P and S have been corrected after subtracting background values in the no enzyme and heat-denatured controls, respectively. All helicase data represent the average of at least three independent determinations. Standard ATPase assay reaction mixtures (30 μl) contained 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 5 mmMgCl2, the indicated ssDNA effector (30 μmnucleotide), 0.8 mm [3H]ATP (42 cpm/pmol), 13 nm BLM protein, and the indicated amounts of hRPA. Reactions were initiated by the addition of BLM protein and incubated at 37 °C. Samples (5 μl) were removed at 2-min intervals and evaluated by thin layer chromatography as described previously (34Matson S.W. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 14009-14016Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Less than 20% of the substrate ATP was consumed in the reaction over the entire time course of the experiment. The kinetic rate constant (k cat) values were expressed as the mean of at least three independent determinations. hRPA was diluted to a concentration of 1.65 ng/μl in Carbonate Buffer (0.016 mNa2CO3, 0.034 m NaHCO3(pH 9.6)). hRPA was then added to the appropriate wells of a 96-well ELISA plate (100 μl/well) and allowed to incubate for 2 h at 24 °C. For control experiments, BSA was substituted for hRPA in the coating step. Wells were aspirated and washed three times with Wash Buffer (PBS, 0.5% Tween 20). Blocking Buffer (PBS, 0.5% Tween 20, 3% BSA) was added to appropriate wells and allowed to incubate 2 h at 24 °C. Wells were aspirated and washed one time with Blocking Buffer. BLM protein was diluted to 1.0 ng/μl in Binding Buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm ATP, 100 μg/ml BSA, and 50 mm NaCl, or the indicated NaCl concentration). The diluted BLM protein was then added to appropriate wells of the ELISA plate (100 μl/well) and allowed to incubate for 30 min at 24 °C. Wells were aspirated and washed three times with Binding Buffer. Primary antibody (rabbit polyclonal IgG against BLM protein) was diluted 1:1000 in Blocking Buffer, added to appropriate wells, and allowed to incubate 1 h at 24 °C. Wells were aspirated and washed four times with Blocking Buffer. Secondary antibody (goat anti-rabbit IgG-horseradish peroxidase) (Jackson ImmunoResearch) was diluted 1:10,000 in Conjugate Buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 150 mm NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20, 1% BSA), added to appropriate wells, and allowed to incubate 30 min at 24 °C. Wells were aspirated and washed five times with Conjugate Buffer. Complexes were detected using K-Blue substrate (Biogen Corp.). The reaction was terminated after 1 min with 1n sulfuric acid. Absorbance readings were taken at 450 nm. The A 450 values, corrected for background signal in the presence of BSA, are expressed as the mean of three independent determinations. For DNase I treatment, both BLM protein and hRPA were pretreated with 20 units of DNase I in Binding Buffer at 37 °C for 15 min. The proteins were subsequently used in the ELISA as described above. Under the conditions used for DNase I treatment, 250 ng of control DNA standard (DNA Molecular Weight Marker II, Roche Molecular Biochemicals) was completely degraded (<2.5 ng, detectable limit) as evidenced by SYBR Green Stain (FMC Bioproducts) detection of DNA electrophoresed on a 1% agarose gel. The fraction of the immobilized hRPA bound to the microtiter well that was specifically bound by BLM protein was determined from the ELISAs. A Hill plot was used to analyze the data (Equations 1 and 2).Kd=(1−f)[Pt]fEquation 1 log[Pt]=log(f/(1−f))+logKdEquation 2 Kd is the dissociation constant of the BLM·hRPA complex, [Pt] is the total concentration of BLM protein present in the reaction, and f is the ratio of the amount of the bound hRPA over the total amount of hRPA in the reaction. The logarithm of [Pt] was plotted against the logarithm of (f/(1 − f)), and the y intercept represented the logarithm of Kd.

In these studies, the BLM-hTOPIIIα interaction served as a positive control in experiments to detect a BLM-hRPA interaction. Briefly, 0.2–1.0 μg of each polypeptide was subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to Hybond-ECL filters (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). All subsequent steps were performed at 4 °C. Filters were immersed twice in denaturation buffer (6 m guanidine HCl in PBSA) for 10 min followed by 6 times for 10 min in serial dilutions (1:1) of denaturation buffer supplemented with 1 mm dithiothreitol. Filters were blocked in TBS containing 10% powdered milk, 0.3% Tween 20 for 30 min before being incubated in BLM (0.5 μg/ml) in TBS supplemented with 0.25% powdered milk, 0.3% Tween 20, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride for 60 min. Filters were washed for 4 times for 10 min in TBS containing 0.3% Tween 20, 0.25% powdered milk. The second wash contained 0.0001% glutaraldehyde. Conventional Western analysis was then performed to detect the presence of BLM using BFL-103 (35Wu L. Davies S.L. North P.S. Goulaouic H. Riou J.-F. Turley H. Gatter K.C. Hickson I.D. J. Biol.

Anti-mouse IgG/horseradish peroxidase conjugate (Sigma) was used as secondary antibody at a 1:10,000 dilution and detected using ECL (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) following the manufacturer's instructions. BLM helicase, like all helicases characterized to date, hydrolyzes nucleoside triphosphate as an energy source for the unwinding reaction (36Matson S.W. Bean D.W. George J.W. BioEssays. 1994; 16: 13-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). We studied the DNA-stimulated ATPase activity of BLM protein in the presence of DNA cofactors of varying lengths. Results of these assays are summarized in TableI. In the absence of a DNA effector, little or no ATP hydrolysis by BLM protein could be detected using a thin layer chromatography method to measure conversion of [3H]ATP to [3H]ADP. These results are consistent with the strong stimulation of ATP hydrolysis by DNA effectors reported by Karow et al. (23Karow J.K. Chakraverty R.K. Hickson I.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30611-30614Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). With the very short (dT)16 oligonucleotide, the turnover rate constantk cat for ATP hydrolysis was 141 min−1. As the length of the dT tract was increased to an average length of 263 nt, the k cat increased nearly 6-fold. Increasing the dT tract from 263 to 900 nt resulted in only a modest 1.2-fold increase in the k cat for ATP hydrolysis. By using M13 ssDNA circles as an infinitely long DNA effector, the increase in k cat to 1163 min−1 was similarly modest (1.2-fold). However, we cannot rule out that very long ssDNA molecules would result in a significantly greater ATPase activity of BLM since the M13 ssDNA circle contains secondary structure. These data indicate that the stimulatory effect of DNA molecules on BLM ATP hydrolysis begins to plateau at a poly(dT) tract length of approximately 263 nt.Table IHydrolysis of ATP (kcat) catalyzed by BLM in the presence of various DNA effectorsDNA effector1-aDNA effector concentration was 30 μm nucleotide phosphate unless specified otherwise.kcatmin−1NoneND1-bND, not detectable.(dT)16141 ± 27(dT)∼263822 ± 216(dT)∼900956 ± 57M13mp18 ssDNA circle1163 ± 358(dT)∼900 + dT161-cConcentration of (dT)16 was 90 μm nucleotide phosphate.921 ± 82M13mp18 ssDNA + (dT)161-cConcentration of (dT)16 was 90 μm nucleotide phosphate.1022 ± 183The BLM concentration was 13 nm (monomer).1-a DNA effector concentration was 30 μm nucleotide phosphate unless specified otherwise.1-b ND, not detectable.1-c Concentration of (dT)16 was 90 μm nucleotide phosphate. Open table in a new tab The BLM concentration was 13 nm (monomer). The stimulation of BLM protein ATPase activity by a given DNA concentration (30 μm nucleotide phosphate) was much greater for long dT tracts (263 and 900). To investigate if the BLM ATPase reaction was saturated with respect to each DNA effector, we examined BLM protein ATP hydrolysis in the presence of a 3-fold greater concentration of nucleotide phosphate (90 μm) for each DNA effector. The initial rates of BLM ATP hydrolysis were not increased with the elevated nucleotide phosphate concentration for each of the DNA effectors (data not shown). These data provide evidence that the ATPase reaction is saturated with respect to ssDNA for each DNA effector under the reaction conditions used. The data in Table I might be interpreted to suggest that the free ends of the DNA effector molecules are inhibitory to the ATP hydrolysis reaction of BLM protein. To address this possibility, we mixed (dT)16 with either (dT)∼900 or M13 ssDNA at a 3:1 molar ratio of nucleotide phosphate and tested the mixture in BLM ATPase reactions. The k cat values for BLM-catalyzed ATP hydrolysis in the presence of the (dT)∼900 + (dT)16 mixture or M13 ssDNA + (dT)16 mixture were 921 and 1022 min−1, respectively (Table I). These data indicate that the BLM ATPase reaction stimulated by (dT)∼900 or M13 ssDNA was not inhibited by the presence of the short (dT)16 molecules, suggesting that the DNA ends do not inhibit ATP hydrolysis. Helicases can be classified by the macroscopic reaction mechanism for unwinding (36Matson S.W. Bean D.W. George J.W. BioEssays. 1994; 16: 13-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). Duplex unwinding as a function of duplex length is an important property of each helicase and may yield insights into the biochemical role of the enzyme in the cell. By using a variety of DNA substrates, biochemical studies of purified helicases in vitro have demonstrated that each DNA unwinding enzyme exhibits its own characteristic dependence of unwinding on DNA duplex length. To characterize the effect of duplex length on the unwinding activity of BLM helicase, we tested partial duplex substrates of varying length in a strand displacement assay. Unwinding of M13 partial duplex DNA substrate molecules of 30, 71, 259, and 851 bp was measured as a function of BLM protein concentration (Fig.1). The figures for percent unwinding of the 30- (Fig. 1 A) and 71-bp (Fig. 1 B) substrates rose to 70 and 37% with 4 nm BLM and 92 and 65% with 16 nm BLM (Fig. 1 C). Further increase in amount of BLM helicase in the reaction did not result in an increase in the percent of DNA unwound for either substrate. The molecular explanation for the inability to achieve a greater percentage of the 71-bp partial duplex DNA substrates unwound is not clear. This phenomenon has been previously observed for UvrD helicase (33Matson S.W. George J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 2066-2076Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and may reflect strand reannealing during the unwinding reaction (discussed below). These results demonstrate that BLM helicase is not a very processive helicase even on short DNA duplexes, since the fraction of partial duplex molecules unwound exhibits a strict dependence on length of duplex. Rather, the amount of BLM helicase that is required in the unwinding reaction for the 30- and 71-bp partial duplex substrates is proportional to the length of DNA duplex to be unwound. It is useful to express the strand displacement data as a rate of base pairs unwound per min per BLM helicase monomer (bp/min/BLM monomer). At a BLM concentration of 2 nm, the rates of"

However, the molecular identities of such receptors are still obscure. Here, we present data showing that <i>Drosophila</i> possesses at least three cDNAs encoding members of the Gram-negative bacteria-binding protein (DGNBP) family, one of which, DGNBP-1, has been characterized. Western blot, flow cytometric, and confocal laser microscopic analyses demonstrate that DGNBP-1 exists in both a soluble and a glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored membrane form in culture medium supernatant and on <i>Drosophila</i> immunocompetent cells, respectively. DGNBP-1 has a high affinity to microbial immune elicitors such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and β-1,3-glucan whereas no binding affinity is detected with peptidoglycan, β-1,4-glucan, or chitin. Importantly, the overexpression of DGNBP-1 in <i>Drosophila</i>immunocompetent cells enhances LPS- and β-1,3-glucan-induced innate immune gene (NF-κB-dependent antimicrobial peptide gene) expression, which can be specifically blocked by pretreatment with anti-DGNBP-1 antibody. These results suggest that DGNBP-1 functions as a pattern recognition receptor for LPS from Gram-negative bacteria and β-1,3-glucan from fungi and plays an important role in non-self recognition and the subsequent immune signal transmission for the induction of antimicrobial peptide genes in the <i>Drosophila</i>innate immune system."

Interaction of the HIV-1 surface envelope glycoprotein (gp120) with CXCR4 or CCR5 is necessary to trigger the molecular events that eventually result in virus-cell fusion and infection.

It appears therefore that chemokine receptors are used by HIV-1 as docking sites at the cell surface, and not for their ability to transduce a cell signal. Experiments with chimeric receptors also showed that the amino-terminal domain of CXCR4 was sufficient for efficient binding of SDF-1, while signaling involved other extracellular domains, and in particular ECL2 (31Lu Z.-H. Berson J.F. Chen Y.-H. Turner J.D. Zhang T.-Y. Sharron M. Jenk M.H. Wang Z.-X. Kim J. Rucker J. Hoxie J.A. Peiper S.C. Doms R.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

According to this model, a discrete region in the amino-terminal domain of the receptor (site I) binds the chemokine with selectivity and high affinity, which then favors its interaction with a pocket formed by the extracellular loops and the membrane-spanning domains (site II). Activation of the receptor requires contact of the chemokine with key residues of site II. Here we have tested a panel of CXCR4 mutants, comprising deletions in the amino-terminal domain and substitutions of amino acids in the extracellular and transmembrane domains, for their ability to mediate infection of CD4+ cells by two genetically divergent HIV-1 strains, and for their capacity to bind SDF-1 and subsequently mediate a cell signal. On the basis of these experiments, we were able to identify residues of CXCR4 that are involved in these different activities. Chemically synthesized SDF-1α (40Amara A. Lorthioir O. Valenzuela A.

Virol. 1993; 67: 5939-5947Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. U373MG-CD4 are stably transfected with a HIV-inducible β-galactosidase reporter gene (LTR-lacZ). HIV-1 stocks were derived from supernatants of HeLa cells transfected with a cloned LAI provirus (42Peden K. Emerman M. Montagnier L. Virology. 1991; 185: 661-672Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar), or of CEM cells chronically infected with the NDK strain (43Spire B. Sire J. Zachar V. Rey F. Barré-Sinoussi F. Galibert F. Hampe A. Chermann J.-C. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 81: 275-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Titers were ∼105 infectious units (I.U.) per ml for LAI, and ∼106 I.U./ml for NDK. The wild-type (WT) and mutant CXCR4 cDNAs were subcloned downstream to the cytomegalovirus immediate-early promoter in the expression vectors pCDNA3 (CLONTECH) or pRc/CMV (Invitrogen). Site-directed mutagenesis was performed on single-stranded templates and checked by sequencing. The position of amino acid substitutions and deletions is depicted in Fig. 1. Mutants Δ2–9, Δ4–36, and N11Q (29Brelot A. Heveker N. Pleskoff O. Sol N. Alizon M. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 4744-4751Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), mutants in the ECL2 (30Brelot A. Heveker N. Adema K.

Virol. 1998; 72: 6381-6388Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) have been described. The ECL2 mutants (except D182G) bear an NH2-terminal Myc tag (45Pleskoff O. Tréboute C. Alizon M. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 6389-6397Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which does not affect CXCR4 function. 2A. Brelot, N. Heveker, M. Montes, and M. Alizon, unpublished results. The COOH-terminal intracellular domain of CXCR4 (residues 310–354) was deleted in mutants Δ2–9, Δ4–36, and N11Q. This deletion has no influence on HIV-1 infection, or on SDF-1 binding and signaling, but abolishes ligand-induced endocytosis (27Amara A. Le Gall S. Schwartz O. Salamero J. Montes M. Loetscher P.

Willett B. Alizon M. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 2576-2586Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, COS cells were co-transfected with WT or mutant CXCR4 vectors, and with EGFP-N1 (CLONTECH), a green fluorescent protein expression vector, in a 6:1 ratio. Cells were detached with phosphate-buffered saline, 1 mmEDTA 36 h after transfection. Approximately 2 × 105 transfected cells were incubated for 1 h at 4 °C in 100 μl of cell-free supernatant from the 12G5 hybridoma (a gift from J. Hoxie, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA), or 100 μl of phosphate-buffered saline, 2% fetal calf serum with affinity-purified 6H8 mAb (10 μg/ml, a gift from A. Amara, Institut Pasteur, Paris), and with SDF-1 in competition experiments. After secondary staining with phycoerythrin-conjugated goat anti-mouse serum (Dako), cells were analyzed for green and red fluorescence on an Epics Elite flow cytometer (Coultronics). Expression of CXCR4 (red fluorescence) was assessed in green fluorescent protein-positive cells. Percentages of inhibition of 12G5 or 6H8 binding by SDF-1 were calculated from mean fluorescence intensities in the presence or absence of SDF-1. U373MG-CD4 cells were transfected in 12-well trays with WT or mutant CXCR4 expression vectors and infected 24 h later with HIV-1 (104 I.U./well). Cells were washed and fixed in 0.5% glutaraldehyde 48 h after infection and stained for β-galactosidase activity with the 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactopyranoside, as described (48Dragic T. Hazan U. Alizon M. Methods Mol. Genet. 1995; 7: 218-236Crossref Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Blue-stained foci were scored under ×20 magnification. Cell counts of >200 were obtained by extrapolation from randomly selected fields. To assess inhibition of infection by SDF-1, U373MG-CD4 cells were detached with trypsin 24 h after transfection and seeded in 96-well trays (∼104 cells/well). After 24 h, cells in duplicate wells were infected with 105 I.U. of HIV-1 NDK, in the presence of the indicated SDF-1 concentrations. After another 24 h, cells were lysed with 1% Nonidet P-40 and β-galactosidase activity was revealed with the chlorophenol red-β galactopyranoside chromogenic substrate (3 mm) by measuring absorbance at 575 nm (A 575) after 1 h at 37 °C. Background was A 575 in CXCR4-transfected uninfected cells processed in parallel. Inhibition of infection was calculated as: 1 − {(A575 with SDF-1 − background)/(A 575 without SDF-1 − background)}. HEK293T cells were transfected with CXCR4 vectors in 6-well trays (∼105 cells per well) using the SuperfectTM reagents. After 36 h, cells were either stained for CXCR4 expression with the 12G5 mAb and analyzed by flow cytometry, as described previously, or tested for radiolabeled SDF-1 binding. In that case, cells were incubated in 700 μl/well of serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 1.2 unit/ml heparinase III (Sigma) for 1 h, then washed and incubated for 90 min at room temperature in 700 μl of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 3% bovine serum albumin, 50 mm HEPES with 0.2 nm125I-SDF-1α (275 μCi/μg). Cells were washed three times in 500 mm NaCl, 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 5 mm CaCl2, 1 mmMgCl2, then lysed in phosphate-buffered saline with 2% Nonidet P-40, and total γ-radioactivity was counted. In each experiment, counts obtained in cells transfected with pRc/CMV were subtracted as nonspecific SDF-1 binding. Results were then adjusted for the relative cell surface expression of CXCR4. COS cells were transfected with CXCR4 vectors and seeded 24 h later in 35-mm glass plates. After another 24 h, cells were loaded with the fluorescent dye fura-2 (Molecular Probes, 3 μm) in saline buffer (140 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 1 mm CaCl2 1 mm MgCl2) for 30 min at room temperature. The same buffer was used to wash cells before addition of 100 nm SDF-1. Single-cell Ca2+ measurements were made at 37 °C with a Nikon Diaphot 300 microscope and an IMSTAR imaging system as described (49Heveker N. Montes M. Germeroth L. Amara A. Trautmann A. Alizon M. Schneider-Mergener J. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 369-376Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Our mutagenesis of CXCR4 sought to address the functional role: (i) of the NH2-terminal extracellular domain (NT), by deletions of variable length (Δ2–9, Δ10–20, Δ4–20, and Δ4–36) and by replacing one or several residues, usually with alanine; (ii) of all the charged amino acids in ECL and TM, by individual substitutions with neutral residues; and (iii) of the third intracellular loop (i3) by three overlapping deletions. The position of these different mutations and deletions is depicted in Fig.1. Besides charged residues, mutations in NT addressed the role of Tyr7, Tyr12, and Tyr21, which are potential sites of sulfation (50Farzan M. Mirzabekov T. Kolchinsky P. Wyatt R. Cayabyab M. Gerard N.P. Gerard C. Sodroski J. Choe H. Cell. 1999; 96: 667-676Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (595) Google Scholar), and of the potential N-glycosylation site Asn11, mutated alone or with Asn176 in ECL2. The cell surface expression of wild-type (WT) and mutant CXCR4 was monitored in simian COS cells by flow cytometry. Transfected cells were stained with the 12G5 mAb, which recognizes a conformational epitope in ECL2 (29Brelot A. Heveker N. Pleskoff O. Sol N. Alizon M. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 4744-4751Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 30Brelot A. Heveker N. Adema K. Hosie M.J. Willett B. Alizon M. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 2576-2586Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) or with the 6H8 mAb, which recognizes residues 22–25 in NT (data not shown). Similar results were obtained with the two mAbs, except when mutations disrupted the 12G5 or 6H8 epitope (Fig.2 A and other data not shown). Staining with 12G5 was markedly reduced for cells transfected with the Δ4–36 deletion mutant (25% of WT), while the Δ10–20 and Δ4–20 deletions had a lesser effect (∼50% of WT). These deletions probably affect the transport and/or stability of CXCR4 at the cell surface. For all other CXCR4 mutants, the extent of staining was at least 75% of that of WT, suggesting that the overall conformation of the receptor was not significantly altered. The ability of CXCR4 mutants to mediate HIV-1 entry in the presence of CD4 (coreceptor activity) was tested in U373MG-CD4 cells. These human astroglioma cells must be transfected with a functional coreceptor in order to be permissive to HIV-1 entry (23Pleskoff O. Sol N. Labrosse B. Alizon M. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 3259-3262Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 51Pleskoff O. Tréboute C. Brelot A. Heveker N. Seman M. Alizon M. Science. 1997; 276: 1874-1878Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). Fig. 2, B and C, show the results of infections performed in parallel with two genetically distant HIV-1 strains, LAI (clade B) and NDK (clade D). A markedly reduced efficiency of infection by the two HIV-1 strains (<25% of WT CXCR4) was observed upon mutation of two tyrosine residues in the NT domain (Y7A/Y12A). The Y21A mutation also reduced infection by both strains tested (<50% of WT in both cases). All other CXCR4 mutants tested (except Δ4–36) were able to mediate infection by at least one HIV-1 strain with relatively high efficiency (>50% of that of WT), again suggesting that the mutations did not disrupt the overall conformation of the receptor. As we already reported (29Brelot A. Heveker N. Pleskoff O. Sol N. Alizon M. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 4744-4751Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the Δ4–36 mutant cannot mediate NDK infection, despite being a relatively efficient coreceptor for LAI, given its reduced cell surface expression. Mutations D171N in TMIV, D193A in ECL2, and E268A in ECL3 markedly reduced NDK infection, but had lesser effects for LAI. By contrast, the mutations D97N in TMII, D262A in ECL3, and E288Q in TMVII mainly affected infection by NDK. Several other mutations reduced the efficiency of infection by one or the other HIV-1 strain, but to a lesser extent. Mutation of the potentialN-glycosylation sites Asn11 and Asn176 had no apparent effect on HIV-1 entry. Overall, our results confirm the importance of residues in NT and ECL2 for the HIV-1 coreceptor activity, but also point to the role of negatively charged residues in the predicted membrane-spanning domains. The SDF-1 chemokine can prevent binding of the 12G5 or 6H8 mAbs to CXCR4, and can inhibit HIV-1 infection mediated by the CXCR4 coreceptor (27Amara A. Le Gall S. Schwartz O. Salamero J. Montes M.

However, the activating collagen receptor on mouse platelets has not been definitively identified. In the current study we examined the function and in vivo expression of GPVI in control and FcRγ chain-deficient mice with the first monoclonal antibody against GPVI (JAQ1).

Cross-linking of bound JAQ1, on the other hand, induced aggregation of wild type but not FcRγ chain-deficient platelets.

A variety of collagens have been identified, seven of which are found in the subendothelial layer. The interaction between platelets and collagen can either occur indirectly via intermediary proteins like von Willebrand factor, which complexes to collagen(s) in the vessel wall and concomitantly binds to the platelet receptors glycoprotein (GP)1 Ib-V-IX and activated GPIIb/IIIa, or by direct recognition of collagen by specific receptors. Several different receptors for collagen have been identified on platelets including CD36 (2Matsuno K. Diaz-Ricart M. Montgomery R.R. Aster R.H. Jamieson G.A. Tandon N.N. Br. J.

Very recently, molecular cloning of GPVI cDNA demonstrated this receptor as a type I transmembrane protein belonging to the immunoglobulin (Ig) superfamily (7Clemetson J.M. Polgar J. Magnenat E. Wells T.N. Clemetson K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29019-29024Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar). Its sequence is most closely related to human FcαR and natural killer cell receptors as well as to polymorphic mouse receptors known as paired Ig-like receptors (PIR) (8Ono M. Yuasa T. Ra C. Takai T.

GPVI (62–65 kDa) contains two Ig-C2-like extracellular domains formed by disulfide bonds and a 51-amino acid cytoplasmic tail that is free of any consensus sequence motifs for activation. Instead, GPVI harbors a positively charged arginine in its transmembrane region. The presence of transmembrane-charged residues is a typical feature seen in a variety of stimulatory receptors, such as Fc receptors for IgG (FcγRI and FcγRIII) (10Ravetch J.V. Kinet J.P. Annu. Rev.

All of them lack amino acid activation motifs but can associate with the FcRγ signaling subunit to trigger activation in response to receptor aggregation. According to in vitro studies on FcαR and mouse PIR-A, it has been suggested that the transmembrane arginine of GPVI is similarly required for its function and association with the FcRγ chain (7Clemetson J.M.

Activation of mouse platelets by collagen is also found to be associated with tyrosine phosphorylation of multiple proteins including the FcRγ chain, Syk, and phospholipase Cγ2 (15Poole A.

However, identification of the mouse collagen receptor coupled to the FcRγ chain has not been established due to the lack of antibodies recognizing GPVI. Here we report that GPVI expression on mouse platelets is strictly dependent on the presence of the FcRγ chain as demonstrated by flow cytometry, immunoprecipitation, and Western blot analysis with a newly developed mAb (JAQ1) against GPVI in FcRγ chain-deficient and control mice. Moreover, JAQ1 completely inhibited collagen-induced aggregation of mouse platelets. Therefore, it is concluded that GPVI represents the major collagen receptor for platelet activation in both mice and humans. Specific pathogen-free mice (NMRI, C57Bl/6) 6–10 weeks of age were obtained from Charles River Breeding Laboratories, Sulzfeld, Germany, and kept in our animal facilities. C57Bl/6 mice deficient in the FcRγ chain (16Takai T. Li M. Sylvestre D. Clynes R. Ravetch J.V.

FITC-labeled rabbit anti-rat Ig, HRP-labeled rabbit anti-FITC, and rabbit anti-fibrinogen were purchased from Dako. All the following antibodies were generated, produced, and modified in our laboratories: MWReg30 (17Nieswandt B. Echtenacher B. Wachs F.P. Schroder J. Gessner J.E. Schmidt R.E. Grau G.E. Mannel D.N. Blood. 1999; 94: 684-693Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (anti-GPIIb/IIIa), EDL1 (anti-GPIIIa), p0p1 (18Bergmeier W. Rackebrandt K. Schroder W. Zirngibl H. Nieswandt B. Blood. 2000; 95: 886-893Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (anti-GPIb-IX), DOM1 (anti-GPV), and LEN1 (anti-GPIaIIa). Mice were bled under ether anesthesia from the retro-orbital plexus. Blood was collected in a tube containing 10% (v/v) 0.1 mol/liter sodium citrate or 7.5 units/ml heparin, and platelet-rich plasma (prp) was obtained by centrifugation at 300 × g for 10 min at room temperature. The platelets were washed twice with Tris buffer (TB, 20 mmol/liter Tris-HCl, pH 7.3, 0.9% NaCl) by centrifugation at 1,300 × g for 10 min and used immediately. Isolated platelets did not show any signs of activation as shown by flow cytometry (staining for P-selectin and surface-expressed fibrinogen). Female Wistar rats, 6–8 weeks of age, were immunized repeatedly with mouse platelets. The rat spleen cells were then fused with mouse myeloma cells (Ag8.653), and hybridomas were selected in HAT medium. Hybridomas secreting mAbs directed against platelet receptors were identified by flow cytometry. Briefly, a 1:1 mixture of resting and thrombin-activated platelets (106) was incubated with 100 μL supernatant for 30 min at room temperature, washed with PBS (1,300 × g, 10 min), and stained with FITC-labeled rabbit anti-rat Ig (Dako) for 15 min. The samples were analyzed on a FACScan (Becton Dickinson, Heidelberg, Germany) in the set-up mode. Platelets were gated by FSC/SSC characteristics. Positive hybridomas were subcloned twice prior to large scale production. Immunoprecipitation was performed as described previously (19Rehli M. Krause S.W. Kreutz M. Andreesen R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15644-15649Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Briefly, 108washed platelets were surface-labeled with EZ-Link sulfo-NHS-LC-biotin (Pierce, 100 μg/ml in PBS) and subsequently solubilized in 1 ml of lysis buffer (Tris-buffered saline containing 20 mmol/liter Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mmol/liter NaCl, 1 mmol/liter EDTA, 1 mmol/liter phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 0.5 μg/ml leupeptin, and 0.5% Nonidet P-40, all from Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Cell debris was removed by centrifugation (15,000 × g, 10 min). Following preclearing (8 h), 10 μg of mAb was added together with 25 μl of protein G-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and precipitation took place overnight at 4 °C. Samples were separated on a 9–15% gradient SDS-polyacrylamide gel (PAGE) along with a molecular weight marker and transferred onto a polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membrane. The membrane was incubated with streptavidin/horseradish peroxidase (1 μg/ml) for 1 h after blocking. After extensive washing, biotinylated proteins were visualized by ECL (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). For immunoblotting, platelets were not surface-labeled. After lysis, whole cell extract was run on an SDS-polyacrylamide gel and transferred onto a PVDF membrane. The membrane was first incubated with 5 μg/ml FITC-labeled mAb followed by rabbit anti-FITC horseradish peroxidase (1 μg/ml). Proteins were visualized by ECL. Washed platelets (2 × 106in TB/1 mmol/liter CaCl2) were incubated with fluorophore-conjugated mAbs (10 μg/ml) for 10 min at 37 °C, and the samples were immediately analyzed on a FACScan (Becton Dickinson). Staining for GPVI was as follows: washed platelets (2 × 106 in TB/1 mmol/liter CaCl2) were incubated with 10 μg/ml mAb for 30 min at room temperature, washed with PBS (1300 × g, 10 min), and stained with FITC-labeled rabbit anti-rat Ig (Dako) for 15 min. To determine platelet aggregation, light transmission was measured using prp (200 μl with 0.5 × 106 platelets/μl). Transmission was recorded on a Fibrintimer 2 channel aggregometer (APACT Laborgeräte and Analysensysteme, Hamburg, Germany) over 10 min and was expressed as arbitrary units with 100% transmission adjusted with plasma. Platelet aggregation was induced by addition of collagen (5 μg/ml) or PMA (50 ng/ml). Thrombin-induced aggregation was performed with washed platelets (200 μl with 0.5 × 106 platelets/μl in TB/1 mmol/liter CaCl2). Acetone-fixed cryosections (6 μm) were blocked (5% normal goat serum, 5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin in PBS) for 30 min at room temperature. JAQ1 was added at a final concentration of 2 μg/ml. After 90 min, the sections were washed three times with PBS and subsequently incubated with the HRP-labeled rabbit anti-rat IgG antibodies at a final concentration of 2 μg/ml for 60 min at room temperature. The 3-amino-9-ethylcarbazole substrate was added after the three washing steps, and the sections were then counterstained with hematoxylin. A new mAb against mouse GPVI (JAQ1, rat IgG2a) was generated. JAQ1 blocked collagen-induced platelet aggregation in prp and on washed platelets in a dose-dependent manner, whereas it had no effect on aggregation induced by PMA (in prp) or α-thrombin (washed platelets) (Fig. 1). Incubation of prp with varying concentrations (3–30 μg) of JAQ1 under stirring (1000 rpm, 37 °C) or static conditions did not induce any signs of platelet activation (surface expression of P-selectin or fibrinogen). Consequently, no aggregation was induced by the mAb itself. JAQ1 bound to mouse platelets (Fig.2 a) and precipitated a single chain protein of an apparent molecular weight of approximately 60 kDa under nonreducing conditions (Fig. 2 b). The molecular weight slightly shifted to approximately 65 kDa under reducing conditions, demonstrating that the apparent molecular weight of mouse GPVI is very similar to its human homolog (7Clemetson J.M. Polgar J. Magnenat E. Wells T.N. Clemetson K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29019-29024Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar, 20Clemetson K.J. McGregor J.L. James E. Dechavanne M. Luscher E.F. J. Clin. Invest. 1982; 70: 304-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Furthermore, JAQ1 recognized GPVI as a single band of approximately 60 kDa under nonreducing conditions in a Western blot analysis of platelet lysates (Fig. 2 c), whereas no band was detected under reducing conditions (not shown) indicating that JAQ1 binds to a conformational epitope on the receptor. On human platelets, polyclonal antibodies against GPVI have been reported to induce platelet aggregation when used as IgG or F(ab′)2 fragments (7Clemetson J.M. Polgar J. Magnenat E. Wells T.N. Clemetson K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29019-29024Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar, 21Sugiyama T. Okuma M. Ushikubi F. Sensaki S. Kanaji K. Uchino H. Blood. 1987; 69: 1712-1720Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), whereas monovalent Fab fragments had no activator effect, suggesting that clustering of GPVI is required for signal transduction. To induce clustering of GPVI, we cross-linked surface-bound JAQ1 by the addition of polyclonal rabbit anti-rat IgG antibodies (10 μg/ml). As shown in Fig. 2 D, such treatment rapidly resulted in irreversible platelet aggregation. In contrast, addition of irrelevant rat IgG2a followed by polyclonal rabbit anti-rat IgG antibodies (10 μg/ml) had no effect. To our knowledge, JAQ1 is the first mAb directed against GPVI and therefore the only divalent anti-GPVI reagent described to date. This may explain why JAQ1, in contrast to polyclonal antibodies against human GPVI, did not induce platelet activation/aggregation by itself but only upon cross-linking. The finding that blockage of GPVI with JAQ1 completely inhibited collagen-induced platelet activation strongly suggests that GPVI is the principal collagen receptor for platelet activation in mice. Like in the human system, receptor clustering seems to be required for signaling through GPVI. Human GPVI has been described to be associated physically and functionally with the FcRγ chain which seems to be critical for platelet activation through the receptor (13Gibbins J.M. Okuma M. Farndale R. Barnes M. Watson S.P. FEBS Lett. 1997; 413: 255-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar,22Tsuji M. Ezumi Y. Arai M. Takayama H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23528-23531Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). Furthermore, it is well recognized that platelets from FcRγ chain-deficient mice do not aggregate in response to collagen (15Poole A. Gibbins J.M. Turner M. van Vugt M.J. van de Winkel J.G. Saito T. Tybulewicz V.L. Watson S.P. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2333-2341Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar). Based on these findings, we expected JAQ1 not to induce platelet aggregation upon cross-linking on platelets from FcRγ chain-deficient mice. Indeed, addition of increasing concentrations of JAQ1 (3–30 μg/ml) followed by polyclonal rabbit anti-rat IgG antibodies (10 μg/ml) had no effect on FcRγ chain-deficient platelets (Fig.3). In parallel experiments with platelets from C57Bl/6 control mice, the same procedure always resulted in platelet aggregation. This finding again demonstrated that the antigen recognized by JAQ1 is mouse GPVI and further suggested that function through mouse GPVI requires the association with the FcRγ chain. Therefore, we assessed the expression of GPVI in platelets and megakaryocytes from C57Bl/6 mice in comparison to FcRγ chain-deficient mice. JAQ1 did not bind to FcRγ chain-deficient platelets as determined by flow cytometry (Fig.4 a). Immunohistochemical examination of splenic megakaryocytes from FcRγ chain-deficient mice demonstrated no specific binding of JAQ1, whereas megakaryocytes from C57Bl/6 control mice were clearly stained (Fig. 4 b). Moreover, in the absence of the FcRγ chain, GPVI-specific bands were not detectable in JAQ1 immunoprecipitates from surface-biotinylated platelets nor in a Western blot analysis of whole platelet lysate. These data strongly suggest that GPVI is not expressed in vivo in the absence of the FcRγ chain, although we cannot definitively rule out the possibility that the protein is expressed but fails to undergo the folding necessary for JAQ1 to bind. In contrast to GPVI, similar amounts of GPIIb/IIIa were immunoprecipitated from control and FcRγ chain-deficient platelets, and GPIIIa was detected in both platelet preparations by Western blot analysis (Fig. 4,c and d). Furthermore, flow cytometric studies demonstrated that the expression of GPIIb/IIIa, the collagen receptor GPIaIIa, and the GPIb-IX-V complex was indistinguishable between platelets from C57Bl/6 and FcRγ chain-deficient mice (data not shown). Taken together, our results give strong evidence that GPVI is the dominant receptor for collagen-induced activation of platelets in mice. We have used FcRγ chain-deficient mice in combination with the first monoclonal antibody against mouse GPVI to demonstrate that correct expression and function of mouse GPVI is strictly dependent on the presence of the FcRγ subunit. These observations, combined with reports that human GPVI is also physically and functionally associated with the FcRγ chain (13Gibbins J.M. Okuma M. Farndale R. Barnes M. Watson S.P. FEBS Lett. 1997; 413: 255-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar, 14Gibbins J. Asselin J. Farndale R. Barnes M. Law C.L. Watson S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18095-18099Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar), indicate that the mechanisms leading to collagen-induced platelet activation are similar in mice and humans.

As it is highly toxic and forms fibrillar aggregates typical of β-amyloid, it is suitable as a model for testing inhibitors of aggregation and toxicity. We demonstrate thatN-methylated derivatives of β-(25–35), which in isolation are soluble and non-toxic, can prevent the aggregation and inhibit the resulting toxicity of the wild type peptide.N-Methylation can block hydrogen bonding on the outer edge of the assembling amyloid. The peptides are assayed by Congo red and thioflavin T binding, electron microscopy, and a 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) toxicity assay on PC12 cells. One peptide (Gly25 N-methylated) has properties similar to the wild type, whereas five have varying effects on prefolded fibrils and fibril assembly. In particular, β-(25–35) with Gly33 N-methylated is able to completely prevent fibril assembly and to reduce the toxicity of prefolded amyloid. With Leu34 N-methylated, the fibril morphology is altered and the toxicity reduced. We suggest that the use of N-methylated derivatives of amyloidogenic peptides and proteins could provide a general solution to the problem of amyloid deposition and toxicity. β-(25–35) is a synthetic derivative of β-amyloid, the peptide that is believed to cause Alzheimer's disease.

X-ray diffraction data have shown that the conformation of Aβ is characterized by an antiparallel cross-β-pleated sheet (5Kirschner D.A. Abraham C. Selkoe D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 503-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar), although more recent solid state NMR evidence suggests that the peptide has a parallel β-sheet structure (6Benzinger T.L.S.

Nevertheless, aggregation occurs because of hydrogen bonding between β-strands, and the resulting fibrils have axes perpendicular to the β-strand and parallel to the cross-linking hydrogen bonds (5Kirschner D.A. Abraham C. Selkoe D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 503-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar). Of all of the Aβ derivatives studied so far, β-(25–35), sequence GSNKGAIIGLM, is the shortest fragment that exhibits large β-sheet fibrils and retains the toxicity of the full-length peptide (2Iverson L.L.

In vitro studies have shown that it does not require aging to aggregate and become toxic (8Pike C.J. Walencewicz-Wasserman A.J. Kosmoski J. Cribbs D.H. Glabe C.G. Cotman C.W. J.

As with Aβ-β, toxicity is dependent on the aggregation state of the peptide, because β-(25–35) that has been solubilized and unfolded in 35% acetonitrile (AcN), 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid is nontoxic (8Pike C.J.

In this study, β-(25–35) has been chosen as a model for full-length Aβ because it retains both its physical and biological properties, while its short length readily allows derivatives to be synthesized and studied. A great deal of evidence, much of which comes from studying hereditary forms of the disease, supports the view that Aβ aggregation is implicated in AD (1Selkoe D.J.

Controversy has raged, however, over whether these fibrils are actually a cause or a consequence of the disease. Although many mutations in the amyloid precursor protein gene have been linked to premature onset of AD, the amount of amyloid deposited in the brain does not necessarily correlate with disease severity. A resolution of this apparent paradox may be that it is a β-structured protofilament, which subsequently forms fibrils and then plaques, that is the pathogenic element (17Lambert M.P. Barlow A.K. Chromy B.A. Edwards C. Freed R. Liosatos M. Morgan T.E. Rozovsky I. Trommer B. Viola K.L. Wals P. Zhang C. Finch C.E. Krafft G.A. Klein W.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

What is clear is that the most important factor influencing Aβ toxicity is its aggregation state, because only the non-soluble fibrillar form is neurotoxic (2Iverson L.L. Mortishire-Smith R.J. Pollack S.J. Shearman M.S. Biochem. J. 1995; 311: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar,11Pike C.J. Burdick D. Walencewicz A.J. Glabe C.G. Cotman C.W. J.

In view of the role fibril formation plays in AD and other diseases, it has been proposed that a valid therapeutic strategy would be to administer compounds that can block fibril or protofilament formation by binding to their ends (20Ghanta J.

Our proposal is thatN-methylated peptide derivatives can also act as β-sheet breakers. Six N-methylated (NMe) derivatives of β-(25–35) were synthesized. We demonstrate that these can both prevent the aggregation of fibrils and inhibit the resulting toxicity. These peptides may have the potential to fold correctly and remain soluble in either monomeric or dimeric form. N-Methylation is known to promote β-sheet formation by locking the residue into a β conformation (28Manavalan P. Momany F.A. Biopolymers. 1980; 19: 1943-1973Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), it and has been shown to generate soluble monomeric β-sheet peptides (29Doig A.J. Chem. Commun. 1997; : 2153-2154Crossref Scopus (32) Google Scholar). ByN-methylating the amide NH groups at the outer edges of the β-sheet and so prevent intermolecular hydrogen bonding, both aggregation and toxicity should be prevented. Because the NMe derivatives are homologous to β-(25–35), they are expected to bind to the peptide but prevent the further addition of β-(25–35) monomers. β-(25−35) and the six NMe derivatives, NMeGly25, NMeGly29, NMeAla30, NMeIle31, NMeGly33, and NMeLeu34 were synthesized on an Applied Biosystems 431A peptide synthesizer using standard solid phase Fmoc (N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl) l-amino acid chemistry and Fmoc-Met Wang resin. Coupling was carried out in most cases using the standard chemistry of 2-(1H-benzotriazole-1-yl)-1,1,3,3-tetramethyluronium tetrafluoroborate (TBTU) and N-hydroxybenzotriazole (HOBt) in dimethylformamide with double coupling after addition of the NMe residue. The exception was NMeIle31, which in addition to double coupling required the use of [O-(7-azabenzotriazol-1-yl)-1,1,3,3-tetramethyluronium] (HATU) and 1-hydroxy-7-azabenzotriazole (HOAt) in dimethylformamide because of the difficulty of coupling following a β-branched NMe residue. The synthesis of NMeIle32 proved impossible despite numerous attempts. Purification was carried out by reverse-phase high pressure liquid chromatography on a Hewlett Packard 1100 using a Resource RPC 3-ml column and a linear gradient of 5–40% AcN in H2O with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. Purified peptides were then analyzed by electrospray mass spectrometry generating the expected masses of 1060 for β-(25–35) and 1074 for the NMe derivatives. Once purified, peptides were stored in lyophilized form at −20 °C. For each assay, peptides were prepared by solubilizing in either H2O or 35% AcN, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. They were lyophilized following any mixing and resolubilized in 20 mm MOPS at pH 7. Peptides were then incubated for 1 week at 37 °C prior to assay. For Congo red binding, thioflavin T fluorescence, and electron microscopy, peptides were either analyzed alone or in 1:1 combinations of β-(25–35) to each NMe derivative with the exception of NMeGly25. Quantitative measurement of Congo red (CR) binding was carried out essentially as described in Refs.30Klunk W.E. Pettegrew J.W. Abraham D.J. J. Histochem.

Readings were taken on a Kontron Uvikon 922 spectrophotometer at 480 and 540 nm, and the amount of CR bound was calculated as follows: Cb (CR bound) [M] = (A 540/25295) −(A 480/46306). Error bars were calculated from the range between duplicate readings. ThT fluorescence was carried out as described in Refs. 32Wood S.J. Maleef B. Hart T. Wetzel R. J. Mol.

Measurements were carried out in triplicate on a Perkin-Elmer luminescence spectrophotometer LS50B using FLWINLAB software and an integration time of 5 s. All data were scaled using β-(25–35) alone as 100%. Scaled figures were plotted using the standard deviation to generate the error bars. Electron microscopy (EM) was carried out to determine whether the NMe derivatives were able to alter wild type peptide morphology. Peptides were solubilized at 500 μm (1 mm total peptide concentration for 1:1 combinations), and 50-μl drops were applied to glow discharged, carbon-coated, 400-mesh copper grids. Peptides were then negatively stained with 2% uranyl acetate before being viewed on a Philips EM 301 electron microscope at 100 kV using a magnification of 75,000. MTT reduction was carried out as described in Refs. 9Shearman M.S. Ragan C.I. Iverson L.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Prior to peptide application, cells were treated with 1 mg/ml DNase to break up any clumps, a feature of PC12 cell growth. This allows for a more accurate cell count. An overnight incubation at 37 °C followed mixing of peptides and cells before the addition of MTT, and after a further 2-h incubation cells were lysed and read at 550 nm. All readings were carried out in triplicate. Positive controls consisted of addition of 20 mm MOPS, pH 7, to cells, and negative controls consisted of the addition of 0.1% Triton X-100, which lyses cells and abolishes MTT reduction. Assay values for positive controls were taken as 100%, and complete inhibition of cell function, 0%, was represented by the negative control. Raw data were then scaled as follows: (each raw data point − negative mean)/(positive mean − negative mean) × 100. The scaled mean for each data set was then plotted with the error given by the standard deviation. Formation of β-(25–35) amyloid was measured at 500 μm, alone and in 1:1 combinations with various NMe derivatives using ThT fluorescence and quantitative CR binding. Preparing and mixing peptides in water looks at the ability of NMe peptides to break down preformed β-(25–35) fibrils, whereas preparing and mixing peptides in 35% AcN is a way to observe their ability to prevent fibril assembly. We found that β-(25–35) alone showed the characteristic binding of CR (30Klunk W.E. Pettegrew J.W. Abraham D.J. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1989; 37: 1273-1281Crossref PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar), whereas the NMe derivatives in isolation do not, with the exception of NMeGly25. Fig. 1 shows that on mixing aggregated β-(25–35) with the NMe peptides, CR binding levels were comparable with those of wild type alone. In contrast, premixing unfolded wild type with NMeGly33 results in the reduction of CR binding to control levels (Fig.2).Figure 2Congo red binding of β(25–35), NMe peptides in isolation, and NMe peptides mixed with unfolded β-(25–35).Following mixing, peptides are lyophilized and resolubilized in 20 mm MOPS, pH 7, conditions that promote wild type (WT) aggregation.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) β-(25–35) alters the excitation and emission spectra of ThT in the same manner as full-length Aβ (33Levine III, H.

On mixing aggregated β-(25–35) with the NMe peptides, as with the CR binding, no differences were seen when compared with wild type alone (Fig.3). For peptides premixed with unfolded β-(25–35), however, the amyloid-induced peak in the ThT spectra is reduced by at least 50% in all cases. NMeGly33 and NMeLeu34 are particularly effective, with levels less than 10% of the wild type (Fig. 4).Figure 4ThT fluorescence at Ex 450/Em 482 of β-(25–35), NMe peptides in isolation, and NMe peptides mixed with unfolded β-(25–35).Following mixing, peptides are lyophilized and resolubilized in 20 mm MOPS, pH 7, conditions that promote wild type (WT) aggregation.

The fibril morphology of β-(25–35) was the same regardless of solubilization conditions, with fibrils 100–160 nm in length and 25 nm in diameter. Although not all NMe peptides affect wild type fibril morphology, some changes were apparent, particularly with NMeGly33 and NMeLeu34 (Fig.5). Under both mixing conditions, NMeLeu34 alters the morphology of β-(25–35) from short, ribbon-like fibrils to long, hair-like structures of indeterminate length and 5–10 nm in diameter. NMeGly33 premixed with aggregated wild type alters morphology to smaller, finer fibrils, 40–60 nm in length and 5–10 nm in diameter; these are less densely spread on the EM grid compared with wild type fibrils. On premixing unfolded β-(25–35) and NMeGly33, virtually all fibrils are abolished with very little staining apparent on the grid. These results confirm that the morphology of both newly forming and preformed β-(25–35) fibrils can be altered by the addition of NMe peptides. The remaining peptides, NMeGly29, NMeAla30, and NMeIle31, when premixed with either folded or unfolded β-(25–35) all have a fibril morphology comparable with that of wild type alone. Aggregation of Aβ and the related peptide β-(25–35) is known to be an important factor in toxicity because non-fibrillar soluble forms are nontoxic (11Pike C.J. Burdick D. Walencewicz A.J. Glabe C.G. Cotman C.W. J. Neurosci. 1993; 13: 1676-1687Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We studied toxicity using the established MTT assay, which measures the redox potential of cells, in this case PC12 cells, and thus monitors cell condition (9Shearman M.S. Ragan C.I. Iverson L.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1470-1474Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar). Healthy cells reduce MTT, turning the redox dye from yellow to purple/blue, whereas unhealthy cells show less of a color change. This assay is specific for Aβ toxicity, and both Aβ and β-(25–35) inhibit the cellular reduction of MTT (35Shearman M.S. Hawtin S.R. Tailor V.J. J. Neurochem. 1995; 65: 218-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). All peptides were prepared and mixed as described above using a concentration range of 20 nm-400 μmβ-(25–35). Wild type peptide was assayed alone and in combination with 100 μm NMe peptides to see whether the ED50 for the β-(25–35) toxicity curve was altered. Interestingly, at 400 μm β-(25–35) toxicity is reduced compared with slightly lower concentrations, consistent with protofibrils being the toxic form rather than highly aggregated and structured amyloid. It is possible that at this concentration aggregation is near completion, and it may be the process of aggregation that is toxic rather than the presence of the aggregates themselves (36Mattson M.P. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 926-928Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Apart from NMeGly25, none of the NMe peptides are toxic in isolation. On mixing with β-(25–35) we found that the NMe peptides had different effects depending on the mixing conditions. NMeGly25 shows the same toxicity profile as wild type, and NMeAla30 and NMeIle31 have little effect using either of the mixing conditions, whereas NMeGly29 and NMeLeu34 have some inhibitory effect on toxicity when mixed with unfolded wild type. NMeGly33, however, appears to inhibit toxicity when premixed with either folded or unfolded β-(25–35) but with a greater effect when mixed with the unfolded peptide. Fig.6 shows examples of some of these results, and Tables I andII provide a summary of the results.Table INMe peptides mixed with prefolded β-(25–35)PeptideCR bindingThT peakEMMTTβ-(25–35) + NMeLeu34YesLargeIndeterminate length; diameter, 5–10 nmNo inhibitionβ-(25–35) + NMeGly33YesLargeVery few fibrils present; length, 40–60 nm; diameter, 5–10 nmInhibition at 5-fold molar excessβ-(25–35) + NMeIle31YesLargeAs wild typeNo inhibitionβ-(25–35) + NMeAla30YesLargeAs wild typeNo inhibitionβ-(25–35) + NMeGly29YesLargeAs wild typeNo inhibitionNMeGly25YesSmallAs wild typeToxicβ-(25–35)YesLargeLength, 100–160 nm; diameter, 25 nmToxicWild type and NMe peptides were solubilized in H2O prior to mixing, as required.

Following lyophilization, peptides were resolubilized in 20 mm MOPS, pH 7. The purpose of this study is to assess whetherN-methylated derivatives of β-(25–35) can successfully inhibit fibril formation and the resultant toxicity of this amyloidogenic peptide. An important factor in the success of inhibition is the structural state of β-(25–35) when it is mixed with the potential inhibitor. Premixing peptides with unfolded wild type is generally more effective than premixing with aggregated wild type, because the latter requires the inhibitor to insert into and break up existing fibrils. We demonstrate that inhibition can be achieved using these NMe derivatives and that the outcome depends on which residue has been N-methylated. NMeGly25 is a β-sheet peptide that aggregates and has the same toxicity profile as the wild type peptide. Fibrils typical of wild type are seen under EM, and the same level of CR binding occurs. It does not have the same effect upon ThT fluorescence, however, and generates a very small amyloid-induced peak. The addition of an NMe group at the N terminus of β-(25–35) still allows the peptide to fold, aggregate, and thus become toxic, but it clearly affects the mechanism of ThT binding. As with CR, the binding mechanism of ThT to amyloid is unknown (20Ghanta J. Shen C.-L. Kiessling L.L. Murphy R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29525-29528Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar, 23Hughes S.R. Goyal S. Sun J.E. Gonzalez-DeWhitt P. Fortes M.A. Riedel N.G. Sahasrabudhe S.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 2065-2070Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), but these results suggest that they must be binding different parts of the peptide because for NMeGly25, CR binding is typical of amyloid, whereas ThT binding is not. If the mechanism of binding of these dyes could be understood, it might give some insight into the structure of amyloid. The remaining NMe peptides are all non-aggregating and nontoxic in isolation, demonstrating that the amide NH groups of residues 29, 30, 31, 33, and 34 are all essential to amyloid formation. These peptides show different levels of effectiveness as inhibitors of β-(25–35) aggregation and toxicity, and this does not appear to be related to secondary structure. Analysis of these peptides in isolation using circular dichroism (data not shown) shows that whereas NMeAla30, NMeGly29, and NMeGly33 in aqueous solution are predominantly random coil, only NMeGly33 is an effective inhibitor of both aggregation and toxicity. NMeIle31 and NMeLeu34 both show elements of β-sheet structure in isolation, but only NMeLeu34 is effective at altering wild type fibrils and inhibiting toxicity. Clearly, the position of the NMe group is most important and determines how the derivative interacts with the wild type peptide. NMeGly29, NMeAla30, and NMeIle31are not effective inhibitors of wild type aggregation and toxicity. When mixed with aggregated β-(25–35), no differences in behavior are apparent and fibril size and morphology, as measured by EM, are comparable with wild type alone. On mixing with unfolded β-(25–35), there is a reduction in the amyloid-induced ThT fluorescence peak. Some inhibition of toxicity occurs, but the peptides must be present in at least 5-fold molar excess of the wild type before this is apparent. For NMeLeu34, the picture is much the same apart from fibril morphology. CR binding and ThT fluorescence are not affected when NMeLeu34 is mixed with aggregated β-(25–35), and no inhibition of toxicity is seen. Fibril morphology as measured by EM is altered, however, demonstrating that it is possible for changes to occur without affecting the binding abilities of these dyes. This highlights the importance of using these assays in conjunction with both the EM and the MTT assay to obtain a complete picture. It may have been concluded otherwise that NMeLeu34 has no effect on β-(25–35). NMeLeu34 premixed with unfolded wild type exhibits this same altered fibril morphology under EM, but the effects on CR binding, ThT fluorescence, and toxicity of β-(25–35) are different. Toxicity is inhibited with NMeLeu34 in 5-fold molar excess, and the ThT fluorescence peak is reduced. CR binding, however, is slightly greater than that of wild type alone. These results illustrate that although fibril morphology can appear the same under EM, differences in biochemical behavior still occur. NMeGly33 is the most effective inhibitor of β-(25–35) aggregation and toxicity. When mixed with aggregated wild type, although CR binding and ThT fluorescence are comparable with wild type alone, EM shows that fibrils are much smaller and finer in appearance. There is also inhibition of toxicity, not seen with any of the other NMe peptides using these mixing conditions. When premixed with unfolded β-(25–35), the effects are more dramatic. CR binding is abolished, the ThT fluorescence peak falls to less than 10% of the wild type alone, and no fibrils are visible under EM. Most importantly, NMeGly33 can inhibit β-(25–35) toxicity when present in equimolar amounts. The midpoint of the toxicity curve is shifted from 30 to 120 μm β-(25–35). It should be noted, however, that when wild type peptide is completely unfolded in 35% AcN, at lower peptide concentrations, aggregation, and thus toxicity, does not reproducibly return during the time scale of the experiment. If it did return to the levels typical of those when wild type is solubilized in water, then NMeGly33 would have shifted the midpoint of the curve from 3 to 120 μm. This means that PC12 cells can tolerate the presence of 40-fold more β-(25–35) with 100 μm NMeGly33 than without it. Mixing NMeGly33 and NMeLeu34 with unfolded wild type again highlights the differences in the binding mechanisms of CR and ThT. Although NMeGly33 causes a reduction in the effect of β-(25–35) on both dyes, NMeLeu34 increases the effect on CR binding but decreases the effect on ThT fluorescence. With NMeL34, the long fibril structures observed under EM must permit CR to bind but alter the binding of ThT. With NMeGly33, the wild type fibrils must either be reduced to a size too small to bind either dye or be observable under EM or they must disrupt fibril formation altogether. The toxicity of β-(25–35) is dependent on fibril morphology and aggregation levels (11Pike C.J. Burdick D. Walencewicz A.J. Glabe C.G. Cotman C.W. J. Neurosci. 1993; 13: 1676-1687Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This conclusion is supported by our results, but it should be noted that not all changes to fibril morphology result in a reduction of toxicity. With NMeGly33, the disruption of fibrils does indeed lead to an inhibition of wild type toxicity. In the case of NMeLeu34, however, the morphological change is not great enough to have an inhibitory effect, illustrating that morphology must be altered in particular ways for the NMe peptide to be an effective inhibitor. Both NMeGly33 and NMeLeu34 alter the wild type fibrils under both conditions, but NMeGly33 is clearly the better inhibitor of wild type toxicity and is most effective when fibrils are abolished or reduced to levels not visible under EM. It appears that these NMe derivatives are not simply binding to the end of a growing β-(25–35) fibril and blocking further addition of monomers but that their structural effects are clearly more complicated. If it is the protofilament precursors of amyloid fibrils that are neurotoxic (17Lambert M.P. Barlow A.K. Chromy B.A. Edwards C. Freed R. Liosatos M. Morgan T.E. Rozovsky I. Trommer B. Viola K.L.

Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 8972-8980Crossref PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar), then it is possible that the N-methylated peptides are exerting their inhibitory effects via these elements rather than fully formed fibrils. Nevertheless, the effectiveness of NMeGly33 in particular does validate this strategy of using NMe derivatives of β-(25–35) and full-length Aβ to prevent aggregation and toxicity. β-(25–35) is a particularly intractable peptide because it aggregates rapidly, unlike the full-length Aβ peptide, which requires aging for up to a week before it aggregates and becomes toxic (2Iverson L.L. Mortishire-Smith R.J. Pollack S.J. Shearman M.S. Biochem. J. 1995; 311: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar). β-(25–35) is very toxic and, according to previous work, requires only nanomolar levels to have an effect (2Iverson L.L. Mortishire-Smith R.J. Pollack S.J. Shearman M.S. Biochem. J. 1995; 311: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar), although we find toxicity is apparent only above 1 μm. It is therefore not surprising that although some inhibition is seen when NMeGly33 is added to aggregated β-(25–35), showing that the peptide must be in a dynamic state of equilibrium between the folded and unfolded state, inhibition works best when added to unfolded β-(25–35) before applying conditions that promote aggregation. Previous work done with β-sheet breaker peptides on full-length Aβ has proved effective to varying degrees (20Ghanta J. Shen C.-L. Kiessling L.L. Murphy R.M. J. Biol.

Future work will involve testing these derivatives and possibly NMe derivatives of Aβ itself on the full-length AD peptide. We believe that the use of NMe derivatives could provide a general strategy for inhibiting the aggregation and toxicity of amyloid. There are more than 20 diseases that are the result of amyloid-like aggregation of particular peptides and proteins, including prion diseases, type II diabetes mellitus, Huntington's disease, and Parkinson's disease (39Carrell R.W. Gooptu B. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1998; 8: 799-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar, 40Dobson C.M. Trends Biochem.

First, they must be able to cross the blood-brain barrier, and second, they must be able to avoid degradation by proteases in the brain. Previous work has shown that not only are the d-amino acid forms of Aβ and β-(25–35) equally toxic to their l-amino acid counterparts but that short d-amino acid β-sheet breaker peptides can bind to either d or l forms of Aβ (42Cribbs D.H.

Chem. 1997; 272: 7431-7436Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). d-Amino acids are not susceptible to the natural proteolytic processes in the brain (37Tjernberg L.O.

The use of small derivatives may also overcome the problem of getting these peptides to cross the blood-brain barrier (37Tjernberg L.O. Lilliehöök C. Callaway D.J.E. Näslund J. Hahne S. Thyberg J.

With these facts in mind, it is possible that the NMe derivatives of amyloidogenic peptides and proteins could provide a general and valid lead to therapeutic drugs for a large number of diseases that are currently untreatable.

https://openalex.org/W2089034514,"Peptidoglycan recognition protein (PGRP) is conserved from insects to mammals. In insects, PGRP recognizes bacterial cell wall peptidoglycan (PGN) and activates prophenoloxidase cascade, a part of the insect antimicrobial defense system. Because mammals do not have the prophenoloxidase cascade, its function in mammals is unknown. However, it was suggested that an identical protein (Tag7) was a tumor necrosis factor-like cytokine. Therefore, the aim of this study was to identify the function of PGRP in mammals. Mouse PGRP bound to PGN with fast kinetics and nanomolar affinity (K d = 13 nm). The binding was specific for polymeric PGN or Gram-positive bacteria with unmodified PGN, and PGRP did not bind to other cell wall components or Gram-negative bacteria. PGRP mRNA and protein were expressed in neutrophils and bone marrow cells, but not in spleen cells, mononuclear cells, T or B lymphocytes, NK cells, thymocytes, monocytes, and macrophages. PGRP was not a PGN-lytic or a bacteriolytic enzyme, but it inhibited the growth of Gram-positive but not Gram-negative bacteria. PGRP inhibited phagocytosis of Gram-positive bacteria by macrophages, induction of oxidative burst by Gram-positive bacteria in neutrophils, and induction of cytokine production by PGN in macrophages. PGRP had no tumor necrosis factor-like cytotoxicity for mammalian cells, and it was not chemotactic on its own or in combination with PGN. Therefore, mammalian PGRP binds to PGN and Gram-positive bacteria with nanomolar affinity, is expressed in neutrophils, and inhibits growth of bacteria. Peptidoglycan recognition protein (PGRP) is conserved from insects to mammals. In insects, PGRP recognizes bacterial cell wall peptidoglycan (PGN) and activates prophenoloxidase cascade, a part of the insect antimicrobial defense system. Because mammals do not have the prophenoloxidase cascade, its function in mammals is unknown. However, it was suggested that an identical protein (Tag7) was a tumor necrosis factor-like cytokine.

Science. 1999; 284: 1313-1318Crossref PubMed Scopus (2153) Google Scholar). One of the antimicrobial mechanisms of innate immunity in insects is the prophenoloxidase cascade, which is present in hemolymph and cuticle (3Ashida M. Brey P.T. Brey P.T. Hultmark D. Molecular Mechanisms of Immune Responses in Insects. Chapman and Hall Ltd., London1997: 135-172Google Scholar). The prophenoloxidase cascade can be initiated by the binding of a 19-kDa protein, peptidoglycan-recognition protein (PGRP),1 to a bacterial cell wall component, peptidoglycan (PGN) (4Yoshida H. Kinoshita K. Ashida M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13854-13860Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar). Recently, insect PGRP as well as mouse and human PGRP homologs were cloned and shown to bind Gram-positive bacteria and PGN (5Kang D. Liu G. Lundstrom A. Gelius E. Steiner H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 10078-10082Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar), thus demonstrating that this protein is highly conserved from insects to mammals and providing additional evidence for the highly conserved nature of innate immunity from insects to mammals. Very high expression of mammalian PGRP mRNA in the bone marrow and lower expression in other lymphoid tissues (5Kang D. Liu G. Lundstrom A. Gelius E. Steiner H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 10078-10082Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar) suggested a role for mammalian PGRP in immunity. However, the exact cell types expressing PGRP and the function of PGRP in mammals remained unknown. Because mammals do not have the prophenoloxidase cascade, mammalian PGRP must play another role. PGN, an essential cell wall component of virtually all bacteria, is especially abundant in Gram-positive bacteria (6Schleifer K.H. Kandler O. Bacteriol. Rev. 1972; 36: 407-477Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). PGN interacts with both humoral (PGRP, lysozyme, complement, and soluble CD14) and cellular (hemocytes, macrophages, and lymphocytes) components of the immune system in both vertebrates and invertebrates (7Heymer B. Seidl P.H. Schleifer K.H. Stewart-Tull D.E.S. Davis M. Immunology of the Bacterial Cell Envelope. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1985: 11-46Google Scholar, 8Dziarski R. Ulmer A.J. Gupta D. Chem.

Overproduction of these cytokines causes all major clinical manifestations of infections, including fever, inflammation, leukocytosis, hypotension, decreased peripheral perfusion, malaise, sleepiness, decreased appetite, arthritis, and in most severe cases, circulatory shock and multiple organ failure (7Heymer B. Seidl P.H. Schleifer K.H. Stewart-Tull D.E.S. Davis M. Immunology of the Bacterial Cell Envelope. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1985: 11-46Google Scholar, 8Dziarski R. Ulmer A.J. Gupta D. Chem.

A novel protein, named Tag7, that was expressed in some tumor cell lines, was recently cloned and proposed to be a novel cytokine, a member of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) family, with TNF-like cytotoxic activity (19Kiselev S. Kustikova O.S. Korobko E.V. Prokhortchouk E.B. Kabishev A.A. Lukanidin E.M. Georgiev G.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18633-18639Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). However, because Tag7 has the same sequence as mouse PGRP (5Kang D. Liu G. Lundstrom A. Gelius E. Steiner H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 10078-10082Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar, 19Kiselev S. Kustikova O.S. Korobko E.V. Prokhortchouk E.B. Kabishev A.A. Lukanidin E.M. Georgiev G.P. J. Biol.

Therefore, the aims of this study were to determine the following: (i) the specificity of mammalian PGRP binding; (ii) which cells express PGRP mRNA and protein; (iii) whether PGRP has PGN-lytic, bacteriolytic, and/or bacteriostatic activities; (iv) whether PGRP has TNF-like cytotoxic activity; and (v) the effect of PGRP on the main functions of neutrophils and macrophages. Recombinant full-length mouse PGRP (182 amino acids) was expressed in baculovirus-infected Sf-9 cells and purified by nickel affinity chromatography as described (5Kang D. Liu G. Lundstrom A. Gelius E. Steiner H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 10078-10082Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar), except that fast protein liquid chromatography was used for the purification and was kept at 4 °C in 10% glycerol. Affinity-purified recombinant PGRP gave one 20-kDa band on 12% SDS-PAGE stained with Coomassie Blue (Fig.1 C). N-terminal amino acid microsequencing (on an Applied Biosystem 476A sequencer) of this PGRP band (after blotting to Immobilon P) revealed the following residues: XSFIVP (X is most likely Cys, which cannot be determined by the sequencer), thus confirming the predicted protein sequence of mouse PGRP (5Kang D. Liu G. Lundstrom A. Gelius E. Steiner H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 10078-10082Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar) and demonstrating that the purified recombinant preparation was a mature full-length protein devoid of the signal peptide. PGRP was negative for endotoxin in the Limulus assay (<3 pg of endotoxin/μg of PGRP). Soluble PGN (sPGN), a polymeric uncross-linked PGN of approximate average M r = 125,000, released fromStaphylococcus aureus Rb or 845 grown in the presence of β-lactam antibiotics, was purified by vancomycin affinity chromatography (20Rosenthal R.S. Dziarski R. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 235: 253-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 21Dziarski R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4713-4718Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Insoluble PGN was isolated from the cell walls of S. aureus 845 and sonicated as described (20Rosenthal R.S. Dziarski R. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 235: 253-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). By quantitative chemical analysis, both sPGN and insoluble PGN had amino acid and amino sugar composition characteristic of S. aureusPGN (20Rosenthal R.S. Dziarski R. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 235: 253-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 21Dziarski R. J. Biol.

Methods Enzymol. 1994; 235: 253-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Synthetic analogs of PGN fragments, PGN pentapeptide (l-Ala-d-isoglutaminyl-l-Lys-d-Ala-d-Ala), and muramyl dipeptide (MurNAc-l-Ala-d-isoglutamine, MDP) were from Sigma, and a disaccharide dipeptide (GlcNAc-β1–4-MDP) was from Calbiochem. No significant endotoxin contamination of these preparations was detected (≤1 ng of endotoxin/mg), determined by theLimulus assay (20Rosenthal R.S. Dziarski R. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 235: 253-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). S. aureus ribitol teichoic acid and lipoteichoic acid (LTA) were the same as before (13Dziarski R. Tapping R.I. Tobias P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8680-8690Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). Rough LPS from Salmonella minnesota Re 595 (ReLPS, a minimal naturally occurring endotoxic structure of LPS,M r = 2000–3000), obtained by phenol/chloroform/petroleum ether extraction (Sigma), was dissolved at 2.5 mg/ml in 0.2% triethylamine, and its purity was analyzed as described before (22Dziarski R Gupta D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2100-2110Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Purified smooth LPS, obtained fromEscherichia coli O113 by phenol/water extraction (refined endotoxin standard, approximate average M r = 15,000) was obtained from Ribi Immunochem Research (Hamilton, MT). Recombinant human full-length (residues 1–323) soluble CD14 and recombinant human 1–152 CD14 N-terminal fragment were the same as before (13Dziarski R. Tapping R.I. Tobias P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8680-8690Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). Lysozyme (grade I from chicken egg), lysostaphin (affinity-purified from Staphylococcus staphylolyticus), cellulose (microgranular), chitin (poly- (1→4)-β-N-acetyl-d-glucosamine from crab shells), zymosan (from Saccharomyces cerevisiae cell walls),Micrococcus luteus (ATCC 4698), Bacillus subtilis(ATCC 6633), and all other reagents, unless otherwise indicated, were from Sigma. S. aureus 845 and Rb cells were killed with gentamicin (18Wang Z.-M. Liu C. Dziarski R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20260-20267Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). PGRP (20 μg) was labeled with 2 mCi of125I using pre-coated IODO-GEN tubes (Pierce) for 15 min at 22 °C. Unbound 125I was removed by dialysis at 4 °C against Dulbecco's PBS without Ca2+ and Mg2+, and 125I-PGRP was stored in PBS with 10% glycerol at 4 °C. The specific activity was 30–60 μCi/μg PGRP.125I-PGRP yielded one 20-kDa band, detected by autoradiography on 12% SDS-PAGE gels, that co-migrated with the Coomassie Blue-stained band of unlabeled PGRP, confirming iodination of PGRP and not any potential otherwise undetectable contaminants (Fig.1 C). sPGN, ReLPS, smooth LPS, GlcNAc-MDP, MDP, or PGN-pentapeptide were coupled to 40–165-μm agarose beads, and the binding of iodinated PGRP to these agarose-immobilized preparations was performed as described for the binding of 32P-sCD14 (13Dziarski R. Tapping R.I. Tobias P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8680-8690Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). For a standard binding assay, 125I-PGRP (200 ng/ml) was incubated with 0.5 μl of sPGN-agarose (or agarose coupled to other compounds, or agarose alone, which had been subjected to mock coupling in a buffer alone) for 10 min at 37 °C in a total volume of 60 μl. After adding PBS with 0.5 m NaCl, the agarose was centrifuged through 0.8m sucrose, and the amount of 125I bound to the agarose pellet was measured (13Dziarski R. Tapping R.I. Tobias P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8680-8690Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). In some experiments, the amount of agarose, incubation time, or PGRP concentrations was varied. For inhibition with unlabeled PGRP, unlabeled PGRP was mixed with125I-PGRP before addition to sPGN-agarose or control agarose. In other competitive inhibition experiments, the competitors were first mixed with sPGN-agarose or control agarose, followed by addition of 125I-PGRP. The apparent dissociation constant (K d) and the maximal binding at saturation (B max) were calculated as before (13Dziarski R. Tapping R.I. Tobias P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8680-8690Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). The binding of 125I-PGRP (200 ng/ml) to bacteria, insoluble PGN, and other insoluble preparations was performed as above with the amounts of bacteria or insoluble preparations (used instead of the agarose) indicated under “Results.” Mouse bone marrow cells (obtained as described below) were lysed in 0.2m Tris/HCl, pH 7.0, with 0.2 m NaCl, 4 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 1% Nonidet P-40, and a mixture of protease inhibitors. Mouse recombinant PGRP (2 μg/group in the same lysis buffer with 2 mg/ml gelatin) or cell lysates (from 20 × 106 cells/group) were incubated for 2 h at 4 °C with 15 μl of sPGN-agarose, 250 μg of M. luteus cells, control agarose, or latex particles, and centrifuged at 10,000 ×g. The sediments were suspended in PAGE sample buffer, and 5× sample buffer was added to the supernatants (1% SDS and 1% 2-mercaptoethanol final concentrations). The samples were boiled and subjected to 12% SDS-PAGE and Western blotting with anti-PGRP antibodies as described below. Mice (female 6–16-week-old BALB/c or ICR from Harlan Sprague-Dawley, Indianapolis, IN) were anesthetized with ether and bled from the retro-orbital venous plexus; the cells from their peritoneal cavities were washed out with RPMI 1640 with 5 units/ml heparin, and their spleens, thymuses, and femurs were removed. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were separated from heparinized blood by centrifugation through Histopaque (density 1.077 g/ml, Sigma) and were 90% pure. Polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs) were separated by centrifugation through two Histopaque layers (density 1.083 g/ml and 1.119 g/liter, Sigma) and were 90% pure as determined by morphology on Wright-stained smears. Peritoneal macrophages were separated from peritoneal washings by adherence to plastic (23Dziarski R. J. Immunol. 1980; 125: 2478-2483PubMed Google Scholar, 24Fortier A.H. Falk L.A. Coligan J.E.

Spleen cells and thymocytes were obtained by cutting the organs, releasing cells from the capsules, and discarding connective tissues and capsules. Bone marrow cells were obtained by flushing isolated femurs with RPMI 1640 with 5 units/ml heparin. Purified B and T lymphocytes were obtained from spleen cells by labeling with (R)-phycoerythrin-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (whole molecule) or FITC-conjugated anti-mouse CD3 monoclonal Ab (Sigma), respectively, and sorting on the FACS-Star Plus cell sorter (Becton Dickinson, San Jose, CA). B and T lymphocytes were >97% pure as determined by FACS analysis and did not contain any detectable PMNs (<0.1%). Human peripheral blood, obtained from healthy males (24–49-year-old Caucasian, Asian, or African-American origin) was separated by centrifugation through two Histopaque layers (density 1.077 g/ml and 1.119 g/ml, Sigma) into PBMC and into PMNs (98% pure as determined by morphology on Wright-stained smears). Monocytes were isolated from PBMC by adherence to plastic (25Jin Y. Gupta D. Dziarski R. J. Infect. Dis. 1998; 177: 1629-1638Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 26Riedy M.C. Stewart C.C.

B lymphocytes, T lymphocytes, and NK cells were purified from PBMC by FACS cell sorting after labeling with phycoerythrin-conjugated anti-human CD19 monoclonal Ab (B cells), FITC-conjugated anti-human CD3 monoclonal Ab (T cells), or FITC-conjugated anti-human CD56 monoclonal Ab (NK cells) (all Abs from Becton Dickinson). In some experiments, T cells were removed by rosetting with neuraminidase-treated sheep red blood cells (27Levinson A.I. Dziarski A. Zweiman B. Dziarski R. Infect. Immun. 1983; 39: 290-296Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) before sorting for B cells and NK cells. The sorted cells were >99.8% pure as determined by FACS analysis and did not contain any detectable PMNs (<0.1%). The following cell lines, all obtained from ATCC (Manassas, VA) and cultured as recommended by ATCC, were used: (a) for mouse: B lymphocytic cells, A20, 2PK-3, BCL-1, and WEHI-231; pre-B-cells, 70Z/3; hybridoma, FB2; T lymphocytic cells, EL-4, R1.1, and YAK-1; macrophage cells, P388D1, J774A.1, and RAW264.7; and fibroblast, 929 (strain L); and (b) for human: B lymphocytic cells, RAJI; T lymphocytic cells, MOLT-4; monocytic cells, THP-1 and U-937; and fibroblast, HeLa. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells were obtained and cultured as described before (25Jin Y. Gupta D. Dziarski R. J. Infect. Dis. 1998; 177: 1629-1638Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Total RNA was isolated from mouse and human cells and cell lines with RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) using mini-spin columns as recommended by the manufacturer. A single tube, two-enzyme Access RT-PCR System (Promega, Madison, WI) was used as recommended by the manufacturer. Briefly, first strand cDNA was synthesized in a 500-μl reaction mixture containing 1× avian myeloblastosis virus/Tlf reaction buffer, 0.2 mm dNTP, 1 mm MgSO4, 0.1 units/μl avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase, 0.1 unit/μl Tfl DNA polymerase, 1 μm upstream and downstream primers, and 1 μg of total RNA. Samples were amplified in a GeneAmp9600 thermocycler (Perkin-Elmer). Amplification cycles were preceded by a 2-min 94 °C denaturation. Subsequent stages were at 94 °C for 30 s, 52 °C for 60 s, and 72 °C for 90 s, for the number of cycles indicated under “Results.” The primers for mouse and human glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), used as a housekeeping gene standard, were (28Wullner U. Isenmann S. Gleichmann M. Klockgether T. Bahr M. Dev. Brain. Res. 1998; 110: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) as follows: sense, 5′ACC ACA GTC CAT GCC ATC AC3′, and antisense, 5′TCC ACC ACC CTG TTG CTG TA3′ which yields a 452-bp product. The primers for PGRP, designed based on the mouse and human PGRP sequences (5Kang D. Liu G. Lundstrom A. Gelius E. Steiner H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 10078-10082Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar), were as follows: mouse sense, 5′GCA ATG TGC AGC ATT ACC AC3′, and mouse antisense, 5′TCT CAC TCT CGG TAG TGT TC3′ which yields a 358-bp product; human sense, 5′ATG TGG TGG TAT CGC ACA CG3′, and human antisense, 5′GTC CTT TGA GCA CAT AGT TG 3′ which yields a 342-bp product. PCR products were subjected to 2% agarose gel electrophoresis and visualized by staining with ethidium bromide. 50-bp DNA stepladder was used as the molecular weight standard. The sequences of all amplified PCR products were confirmed following extraction from the agarose gel and purification using QIAquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen) as recommended by the manufacturer and then using automatic sequencing performed at Genemed Synthesis (South San Francisco, CA). Mouse PGRP C-terminal (DQLYQVIQSWEHYRE) and N-subterminal (RALPSECSSRLGHC) peptides were synthesized and purified (>95% pure) by HPLC by Genemed Synthesis (South San Francisco, CA) and then coupled to keyhole limpet hemocyanin with glutaraldehyde (C-terminal peptide), to bovine serum albumin (BSA) with m-maleimidobenzoyl-N-hydroxysuccinimide ester (N-subterminal peptide), or to ovalbumin with glutaraldehyde (both peptides) as described (29Collawan J.F. Paterson Y. Coligan J.E. Kruisbeek A.M. Margulies D.H. Shevach E.M. Strober W. Current Protocols in Immunology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1995: 11.14.1-11.15.4Google Scholar). Female New Zealand White rabbits were immunized with an emulsion of both peptide-carrier conjugates with keyhole limpet hemocyanin and BSA in Complete Freund's adjuvant, and were boosted several times with an emulsion of the same peptide conjugates in incomplete adjuvant, followed by boosting with both peptides-ovalbumin conjugates in Complete and then in incomplete Freund's adjuvants as described (30Cooper H.M. Paterson Y. Coligan J.E. Kruisbeek A.M. Margulies D.H. Shevach E.M. Strober W. Current Protocols in Immunology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1995: 11.12.1-11.12.9Google Scholar). The production of antibodies was monitored by Western blots with purified mouse PGRP and anti-rabbit peroxidase-labeled second antibody and enhanced chemiluminescence reagent (ECL, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) (17Gupta D. Jin Y. Dziarski R. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 2620-2630PubMed Google Scholar). The immune serum (1:4000 dilution) gave a strong reaction with 0.5 μg of PGRP in 15 s, and the preimmune serum was completely negative on blots of 1 μg of PGRP overexposed for 30 min. The immune serum was absorbed twice with BSA-agarose to remove strong cross-reactivity with mouse albumin. Mouse or human cells (106/group) were dissolved in 100 μl of lysis buffer (0.1 m Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, with 0.1 mNaCl, 4 mm EDTA, 30% glycerol, 1% Nonidet P-40, and a mixture of protease inhibitors), boiled with PAGE sample buffer (2% SDS and 1% 2-mercaptoethanol), and centrifuged at 12,000 ×g. The supernatants were subjected to 12% SDS-PAGE and blotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Immobilon P, Millipore), and the membranes were blocked with 5% milk (17Gupta D. Jin Y. Dziarski R. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 2620-2630PubMed Google Scholar). The membranes were incubated with rabbit anti-PGRP serum (1:4000), and immunoreactive bands were detected with anti-rabbit IgG second antibody and ECL as above. For inhibition with peptides, 1 μl of anti-PGRP serum in 25 μl of PBS with 2% gelatin was incubated at 4 °C for 24 h with 25 μg of each PGRP peptide or with 50 μg of a control peptide (Sendai virus nucleoprotein fragment 321–336), and then diluted and used for detection of PGRP as described above. To test if PGRP had any PGN-lytic activity, biotin-labeled sPGN (13Dziarski R. Tapping R.I. Tobias P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8680-8690Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar) (50 μg/ml in 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.0, with 0.85% NaCl, and with or without 1 mmZnSO4) was incubated for 24 h at 37 °C without or with PGRP or control PGN-lytic enzymes (lysozyme or lysostaphin) at 0.1–100 μg/ml as described (13Dziarski R. Tapping R.I. Tobias P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8680-8690Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). The digests were subjected to SDS-PAGE and blotted onto Immobilon, and biotin-sPGN was detected with streptavidin-peroxidase and enhanced chemiluminescence as described (13Dziarski R. Tapping R.I. Tobias P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8680-8690Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). This method detects the PGN-lytic activity of enzymes with either muramidase activity (such as lysozyme), which hydrolyzes the glycan chain of PGN and converts high M r sPGN into lowM r sPGN fragments, or with amidase or peptidase activity (such as lysostaphin), which removes biotin-labeled peptide from high M r sPGN (13Dziarski R. Tapping R.I. Tobias P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8680-8690Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). The experiments were done without and with ZnSO4, because T3 and T7 amidases, with which PGRP has some sequence homology (5Kang D. Liu G. Lundstrom A. Gelius E. Steiner H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.

To test if PGRP had any bacteriolytic activity, M. luteus (1 mg/ml in 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.0, with 0.85% NaCl, and with or without 1 mm ZnSO4) was incubated in 96-well plates (100 μl/well) at 37 °C without or with PGRP or a control bacteriolytic enzyme (lysozyme) at 1–25 μg/ml, and absorbance at 540 nm (A 540) was periodically measured with an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay plate reader. To test if PGRP had any bacteriostatic activity, logarithmic phase Gram-positive (Staphylococcus hemolyticus, Staphylococcus warneri, Staphylococcus capitis, and Bacillus megaterium) or Gram-negative (E. coli andEnterobacter cloacae) bacteria (OD660 = 0.4–0.5) were diluted with"

Long-term culture of cells expressing wild-type POLG-myc revealed no alterations in mitochondrial function. Expression of POLG-myc mutants created dominant phenotypes demonstrating important roles for the protein in mtDNA maintenance and integrity.

Further culture resulted in the selection of cells with an inactivated mutator polymerase, and a reduced mutation load in mtDNA. Transient expression of POLG-myc variants D890N or D1135A inhibited endogenous mitochondrial DNA polymerase activity and caused mtDNA depletion. Deletion of the POLG CAG repeat did not affect enzymatic properties, but modestly up-regulated expression.

A working hypothesis for the mechanism of mtDNA replication was published almost two decades ago (2Clayton D.A. Cell. 1982; 28: 693-705Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (926) Google Scholar), yet little is known about the key enzymes involved in this essential cellular process. Synthesis of mtDNA is apparently asymmetrical, with two-thirds of the leading strand being synthesized before the lagging strand initiates. The displaced parental strand is believed to be protected from intra-strand recombination and illegitimate initiation events by the mitochondrial single-stranded DNA-binding protein, mtSSB (3Zeviani M. Amati P. Comi G. Fratta G. Mariotti C. Tiranti V. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1271: 153-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The human POLG gene encodes the catalytic subunit of what is believed to be the only DNA polymerase active in mitochondria, polymerase γ, POLG (4Lecrenier N. Van Der Bruggen P. Foury F. Gene (Amst.). 1997; 185: 147-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 5Ropp P.A. Copeland W.C. Genomics. 1996; 36: 449-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar, 6Walker R.L. Anziano P. Meltzer P.S. Genomics. 1997; 40: 376-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). However, clear evidence that this enzyme functions in mtDNA replication in vivo remains lacking. POLG and homologous enzymes, such as Mip1p in yeast (7Foury F. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 20552-20560Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), are related to the Family A DNA polymerases, which include Pol I from Escherichia coli and phage T7 DNA polymerase (4Lecrenier N. Van Der Bruggen P. Foury F. Gene (Amst.). 1997; 185: 147-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 5Ropp P.A. Copeland W.C.

Braithwaite D.K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 6716Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The regions of highest similarity between POLG and the Family A polymerases include an NH2-terminal 3′-5′ exonuclease domain involved in proofreading, and a COOH-terminal region that in eubacterial members of the family is essential for polymerase activity. Residues essential for DNA polymerase activity have not yet been identified in any mitochondrial enzyme. A feature unique to human POLG is the presence of a repeat of 13 glutamines, partly encoded by a run of 10 CAG codons near to the NH2 terminus of the coding region. Population analysis implies that active selection maintains the CAG tract at or near 10 repeats (10Rovio A. Tiranti V. Bednarz A.L. Suomalainen A. Spelbrink J.N. Lecrenier N. Melberg A. Zeviani M. Poulton J. Foury F. Jacobs H.T. Eur. J. Hum. Genet. 1999; 7: 140-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), which may indicate a stringent dependence of catalytic activity on glutamine tract-length. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, specific Mip1p residues have been shown to be critical for exonuclease activity (11Bernad A. Blanco L. Lazaro J.M. Martin G. Salas M. Cell. 1989; 59: 219-228Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar, 12Foury F. Vanderstraeten S. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 2717-2726Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 13Hu J. Vanderstraeten S. Foury F. Gene (Amst.). 1995; 160: 105-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). In recombinant human POLG the double mutant D198A/E200A is also exonuclease deficient in vitro(14Longley M.J. Ropp P.A. Lim S.E. Copeland W.C. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 10529-10539Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Mutations that abolish Mip1p exonuclease activity in yeast result in the accumulation of base substitutions in mtDNA, and in some cases also in a significantly increased frequency of generation ofrho− cells carrying defective mtDNA (12Foury F. Vanderstraeten S. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 2717-2726Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 13Hu J. Vanderstraeten S. Foury F.

Chem. 1998; 273: 23690-23697Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Exonuclease-deficient mip1mutations are at least partially dominant (13Hu J. Vanderstraeten S. Foury F. Gene (Amst.). 1995; 160: 105-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), meaning that even in the presence of wild-type Mip1p, mutations accumulate in mtDNA. However, a role for the exonuclease domain of POLG in maintaining the integrity of mtDNA in humans has not been demonstrated. A mitochondrial mutator for human cells would be an invaluable tool for studying the mechanisms involved in the generation, accumulation, and phenotypic effects of human mtDNA mutations, which are an important cause of human disease. DNA replication requires the combined action of many proteins, including those involved in nucleotide metabolism, DNA unwinding, priming of DNA synthesis, decatenation, and stabilization of intermediary structures. Such proteins are predicted to assemble in a large replication complex with DNA polymerase, but few of them have been identified in vertebrate mitochondria. Two examples are the mtSSB, which can stimulate POLG activity in vitro (16Farr C.L. Wang Y. Kaguni L.S. J. Biol.

Thus far, human POLG has been characterized only in vitro, via access to the purified or recombinant enzyme (5Ropp P.A. Copeland W.C.

We therefore set out to analyze the functions of the protein and its constituent domains in vivo, using an episomal expression system in cultured cells. In this study we confirm, using reporter constructs, that POLG is targeted in vivo to the inner face of the inner mitochondrial membrane and is functional as a DNA polymerase. Long-term overexpression does not, however, affect mtDNA levels, indicating that the polymerase is not limiting for the overall rate of mtDNA synthesis. Via the expression of mutated versions of the enzyme, we further demonstrate that the D198A mutation abolishes detectable proofreading exonuclease activity in mitochondrial extracts and promotes the accumulation of mtDNA mutations, leading to selection in long-term cell culture. Mutations at either of 2 aspartate residues in the COOH-terminal domain abolish DNA polymerase activity, inhibit the endogenous enzyme, and cause mtDNA depletion. Catalytic activity is unaffected by deletion of the CAG repeat, although expression is modestly up-regulated. These results represent the first demonstration of the functional roles and importance of POLG in the maintenance and integrity of mtDNA in human cells. HeLa and HEK293T cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 4.5 g/liter glucose, 2 mml-glutamine, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, 50 μg/ml uridine, and 10% fetal bovine serum, at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere with 8.5% CO2 in air. No antibiotics were added. HEK293T cells were routinely detached by pipetting alone, and split 1:10–1:20. HeLa cells were split after detaching the cells by a 5-min incubation in 10 mm EDTA. Cells transfected in 6-well culture plates were seeded 1–2 days prior to transfection at 40–70% density. Transfection routinely used 1 μg of DNA and 10 μl of LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.), diluted in 1 ml of Opti-MEM (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Five hours following transfection, 2 ml of fresh medium was added and, when necessary, was replaced 24 h after transfection. Transfection efficiency for HEK293T cells was routinely high (approximately 50%), based on co-transfection with a β-galactosidase-encoding construct, but for HeLa cells was less than 1%. Transfections in 100-mm plates were scaled up from these procedures. Following transfection, cells were either processed after 24–48 h, or put under GeneticinTM (Life Technologies, Inc.) selection (2 mg/ml, prepared as a stock solution in PBS at 100 mg/ml) 48 h after transfection. To improve selection, cells were successively replated to eliminate untransfected cells. Geneticin-resistant clones were picked by ringcloning, regrown in multiwell plates, and subsequently tested for the presence of an expressed transgene by reverse transcriptase-PCR or by Western blot analysis. Whole cell oxygen consumption was measured essentially as described previously (26Dunbar D.R. Moonie P.A. Zeviani M. Holt I.J. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1996; 5: 123-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Site-directed mutagenesis of single residues of the POLG cDNA (4Lecrenier N. Van Der Bruggen P. Foury F. Gene (Amst.). 1997; 185: 147-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) was carried out using the Altered SitesTMII mutagenesis system (Promega), essentially according to the manufacturer's protocols. For this purpose, full-length POLG cDNA originally cloned in pcDNAI/Amp (4Lecrenier N. Van Der Bruggen P. Foury F. Gene (Amst.). 1997; 185: 147-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) was recloned in the pAlter-1 vector, and subjected to site-directed mutagenesis and ampicillin selection. Appropriate POLG fragments derived from selected plasmids were re-inserted into full-length POLG in pBluescript SK+(Stratagene) and sequenced to confirm the presence of the mutation and to ensure that no other mutations had occurred during the procedure. Deletion of the CAG10 repeat was effected using a PCR-based method, and the resulting PCR product was also recloned into the pBluescript SK+-POLG construct. All constructs were finally recloned in pcDNA3.1(−)/Myc-His A (Invitrogen) using a high-fidelity PCR-based method. These final constructs contain the full coding sequence plus 61 nucleotides from the 5′-untranslated region, cloned in-frame with the Myc-His tag sequence using theEcoRI and BamHI restriction sites of the vector. The resulting fusion protein contains the 1239 amino acids of the POLG precursor, followed by an additional 31 amino acids of the Myc-His tag, with a predicted total molecular mass of 143 kDa. A similar fusion was created for TUFM cDNA (27Woriax V.L. Burkhart W. Spremulli L.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1264: 347-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). GFP fusion proteins were constructed by recloning cDNAs for POLG, TUFM, and mtTFA (kind gift of Dr. R. Wiesner) in the pEGFP-N3 vector (CLONTECH). All constructs were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Cells were washed with Dulbecco's modfied Eagle's medium 24 h after transfection and incubated in medium containing 100 nm Mitotracker Red (Molecular Probes) for 10–15 min. The cells were washed twice in PBS, after which normal medium was replaced and cells were incubated for a further 2 h at 37 °C. They were then washed twice in PBS and fixed in 4% formaldehyde, 5% sucrose in PBS for 10 min at 37 °C. After two final PBS washes the coverslips were mounted on slides using Vectashield mounting medium (Vector Laboratories) and visualized using an Olympus BX-50 microscope, with appropriate filters for Mitotracker Red (U-MWG, wavelength 510–550 nm) and enhanced green fluorescent protein (U-MWB, wavelength 450–480 nm) fluorescence. SDS-PAGE used 7.5–12% polyacrylamide (Laemmli) gels run under standard conditions (28Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207538) Google Scholar). All samples were heated prior to loading at 95 °C for 5 min in SDS-PAGE sample buffer (29Schägger H. Von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10505) Google Scholar) containing dithiothreitol (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 12% glycerol, 4% SDS, 0.01% Serva Blue G, 0.1 m dithiothreitol). Wetblotting to HybondTM-C extra nitrocellulose membrane (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was carried out at 100 V for 1 h at 4 °C (30Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44939) Google Scholar). Blots were blocked for 1 h at room temperature in TBS-T (0.1% Tween) containing 5% freeze-dried fat-free milk powder, washed several times with TBS-T, and reacted with primary antibody in TBS-T overnight at room temperature. Primary antibodies and dilutions used were: mouse anti-Myc monoclonal 9E10 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), 1:15,000 dilution of a 5 mg/ml stock, rabbit anti-mtSSB (kind gift of Dr. M. Zeviani), 1:1000, rabbit anti-β-subunit of DNA polymerase γ (kind gift of Dr. P. Lestienne), 1:5000, rabbit anti-human mtTFA (kind gift of Dr R. Wiesner), 1:10000, rabbit anti-complex IV (31Nijtmans L.G.J. Spelbrink J.N. Van Galen M.J.M. Zwaan M. Klement P. Van den Bogert C. Biochim. Biophys.

Blots were washed 2 × 10 s, 1 × 15 min, and 2 × 5 min in TBS-T, and then incubated for 1 h at room temperature with peroxidase-conjugated goat or horse secondary antibody (anti-mouse IgG (Bio-Rad or Vector Laboratories, Inc.), 1:10000, or anti-rabbit IgG (Vector Laboratories, Inc.)) in TBS-T. Blots were re-washed as above and finally with PBS. 5 ml of luminol solution (0.25 mg/ml sodium luminol (Sigma), 0.009% H2O2, 0.1 m Tris-Cl, pH 6.8) and 50 μl of enhancer solution (1.1 mg/ml para-hydroxycoumaric acid (Sigma) in dimethyl sulfoxide) were mixed and incubated on each blot for 1 min. Film (Kodak BiomaxTM ML) was exposed for periods from 15 s to 45 min, as necessary. Silver staining was carried out as described by Morrissey (33Morrissey J.H. Anal. Biochem. 1981; 117: 307-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (2942) Google Scholar). Other gels were stained for 30 min in 0.1% Coomassie Brilliant Blue (Sigma) in 40% methanol, 10% acetic acid. Destaining was carried out in 40% methanol, 10% acetic acid followed by 10% methanol, 10% acetic acid. Cell pellets, obtained by centrifugation at 1200 × g max for 1 min, were lysed in PBS containing 1.5% (w/v) lauryl maltoside and 2.5 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride at 4 °C for 30 min, then centrifuged at 16,000 × g max for 1 min at 4 °C. Supernatant and pellet were either stored at −80 °C or used immediately for SDS-PAGE. Finer subcellular fractionation used a standard procedure for mitochondrial isolation (34Fernandez-Silva P. Martinez-Azorin F. Micol V. Attardi G. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1066-1079Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Essentially, cells were washed once with PBS, dislodged from the plate by pipetting up and down in ice-cold NKM (1 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.13m NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 7.5 mmMgCl2) and centrifuged at 400 ×g max for 3 min at 4 °C. The cell pellet was resuspended by gentle pipetting in 2 volumes of ice-cold 0.1 × homogenization buffer (4 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 2.5 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm MgCl2), kept on ice for 5 min, then homogenized in a glass homogenizer with 20 strokes of a tight-fitting pestle. Disruption of the cells was monitored by microscopy. One-ninth volume of 10 × homogenization buffer was added and nuclei and cell debris were pelleted by two sequential centrifugations at 1,200 × g max for 3 min at 4 °C. Mitochondria from the post-nuclear supernatants were recovered by centrifugation at 16,000 ×g max for 3 min at 4 °C. Mitochondrial pellets from 1 ml of cytoplasm were washed once with 1 ml of ice-cold PBS and either directly processed further or frozen at −80 °C. Submitochondrial fractionation was carried out essentially as described elsewhere (35Hauswirth W.W. Lim L.O. Turner G. Darley-Usmar V.M. Rickwood D. Wilson M.T. Mitochondria, a Practical Approach. IRL Press, Oxford1987: 176-177Google Scholar, 36Van den Bogert C. Pennings A. Dekker H.L. Boezeman J.B.M. Luciakova K. Sinjorgo K.C.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1097: 87-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Protease resistance of imported mitochondrial proteins was verified as follows. A mitochondrial pellet obtained from one or two 80% confluent, 175 cm2 cell culture flasks was resuspended in PBS. An equal volume of 4 mg/ml digitonin (heat solubilized in PBS), was added and samples were vortexed vigorously, split into three equal portions, and incubated on ice for 5 min. An additional 9 volumes of ice-cold PBS were added and samples were centrifuged at 16,000 × g max for 3 min at 4 °C, then washed twice in 1 ml of PBS. The resulting mitoplast pellets were resuspended in a small volume of PBS and incubated for 10 min at room temperature either without any further additions, with 50 μg/ml trypsin (Fluka), or with 0.15% lauryl maltoside plus 50 μg/ml trypsin. 2 × SDS-PAGE sample buffer was added directly to the last sample. The first two samples were pelleted, washed three times with PBS, and finally resuspended in SDS-PAGE sample buffer. Immunoprecipitations were carried out essentially as described elsewhere (36Van den Bogert C. Pennings A. Dekker H.L. Boezeman J.B.M. Luciakova K. Sinjorgo K.C.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1097: 87-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). In brief, mitochondrial pellets containing up to 1 mg of protein were lysed in PBS, 1.5% lauryl maltoside, 2.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, incubated for 30 min on ice, and centrifuged at 16,000 × g max for 1 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was incubated on a rotary shaker at 4 °C for 2 h or overnight with 20–100 μl of 10% Protein A-Sepharose CL-4B (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), prepared in PBS, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and preincubated for 15 min with the appropriate antibody. The beads were pelleted at 14,000 × g max for 10 s, washed once with 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5m NaCl and three times with 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, 0.05% lauryl maltoside. The final pellet was resuspended in 1–2 volumes of SDS-PAGE sample buffer. POLG activity was measured by means of an RNA-dependent DNA polymerase (reverse transcriptase) assay, adapted from Longley et al. (14Longley M.J. Ropp P.A. Lim S.E. Copeland W.C. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 10529-10539Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Freshly isolated mitochondria were lysed in 25 mmHepes-KOH, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100 so that the final protein concentration was between 2.5 and 10 mg/ml. After incubation on ice for 30 min and centrifugation at 16,000 ×g max for 1 min at 4 °C, activity was assayed in 10-μg aliquots of lysate in a final volume of 50 μl containing 25 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 10 μg/ml acetylated bovine serum albumin, 0.5 mm MnCl2, 2.5 μg of poly(rA)·oligo(dT) (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and 50 μg/ml Aphidicolin. Reactions containing either no further inhibitor, or else ddTTP as indicated, were preincubated for 5 min at room temperature before the addition of 5 μl of a mixture of [α-32P]dTTP (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, 3000–6000 Ci/mmol) diluted 0.6:10 with 100 μm dTTP. Samples were then incubated for 15 min at 37 °C, after which 10 μl was spotted on a GFC filter, air-dried, washed three times with 5% trichloroacetic acid then once with 70% ethanol, air-dried and counted using liquid scintillation counting. For each lysate a control assay without template was used to measure the background trichloroacetic acid-precipitable counts. A method for exonuclease activity measurement was adapted from existing protocols (12Foury F. Vanderstraeten S. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 2717-2726Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 14Longley M.J.

Chem. 1992; 267: 5835-5841Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), using primer-activated single-stranded M13mp18(+) (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). 50 pmol of paired or 3′-nucleotide-mispaired oligo (paired, AB353: GTAAAACGACGGCCAGT; mispaired, AB354: GTAAAACGACGGCCAGA) were 5′-labeled using [γ-32P]ATP (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, 3000–6000 Ci/mmol) and T4 polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs) according to the manufacturer's recommended procedure. Polynucleotide kinase was inactivated for 10 min at 65 °C. Hybridization of radiolabeled oligonucleotide and single-stranded M13 was carried out in a 25 μl of mixture containing 0.1 mNaCl, 25 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.6, ∼0.6 pmol of M13mp18 ssDNA (1.5 μg), and 20 pmol of 32P-labeled AB353 or AB354. The mixture was incubated for 10 min at 75 °C and allowed to cool slowly to room temperature. Primer-hybridized M13 was further purified using Sephadex G-50 spin columns (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) in a final volume of approximately 50 μl. For each measurement 10 μg of mitochondrial lysate (prepared as for the reverse transcriptase assay) was used in a final volume of 100 μl containing: 25 mmHepes-KOH, pH 7.6, 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 1 μg/ml acetylated bovine serum albumin, 5 mm MgCl2, 2 μl of template (∼25 fmol of primed M13mp18(+)) and 50 μg/ml Aphidicolin. In some experiments 0.1 m NaCl was added, which inhibits the exonuclease activity of POLG (24Gray H. Wong T.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 5835-5841Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Samples were incubated at 37 °C and 10-μl aliquots were taken and directly added to 10 μl of formamide sample buffer (95% formamide, 0.6% SDS, 25 mm EDTA, 0.05% w/v bromphenol blue and 0.05% (w/v) xylene cyanol), at various time points varying from 0 to 20 min. Samples were boiled for 2 min and run on a 15% polyacrylamide, 7m urea sequencing gel. The gel was fixed in 10% acetic acid, 15% ethanol, dried, and autoradiographed. Control reactions were carried out without the addition of mitochondrial lysate. For amino-terminal sequence analysis, proteins separated by gel electrophoresis and electroblotted on polyvinylidene difluoride, the membranes were sequenced by automatic Edman degradation on an Applied Biosystems pulsed liquid-phase sequencer (model 477A). At the end of each cycle of Edman degradation, the phenylthiohydantoin-derivative was separated from reaction by-products products using an Applied Biosystems HPLC apparatus (model 120A) on a Browlee C18 reverse phase column (Spheri-5 phenylthiohydantoin, 5 m, 220 × 2.1 mm). Data were analyzed with the Applied Biosystems Data Analysis System software (model 610A, version 1.2.2). For MALDI analysis, protein-containing gel slices were S-alkylated, digested with trypsin (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, sequencing grade), and extracted according to Shevchenko et al. (37Shevchenko A. Wilm M. Vorm O. Mann M. Anal. Chem. 1996; 68: 850-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (7831) Google Scholar). Only the peptides eluted with 20 mmNH4HCO3 were used in the MALDI analysis. After drying in a vacuum centrifuge the peptides were dissolved in 10 μl of 0.5% trifluoroacetic acid, 50% acetonitrile. 0.5 μl of the this solution was mixed with 0.5 μl of a 10 mg/ml α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid (Sigma)/acetone solution. Prior to dissolving the α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid was washed briefly with 1/10 of the final volume of acetone. 0.5 μl of the mixture was spotted on the target and allowed to dry at room temperature. MALDI spectra were acquired on a Micromass Tof Spec 2EC (Micromass, Wythenshawe, UK), equipped with a 2 GHz LeCroy LSA-1000 digitizer (LeCroy Corp., Chestnut Ridge, NY). The resulting peptide spectra were used to search a nonredundant protein sequence data base (SWISS-PROT/TREMBL) using the Proteinprobe program. Total cellular DNA was isolated, EcoRI digested, and subjected to Southern analysis as described elsewhere (38Lehtinen S.K. Hance N. El Meziane A. Juhola M.K. Juhola K.M.I. Karhu R. Spelbrink J.N.

Plattner R.D. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1989; 272: 137-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Farnesyl diphosphate is the universal precursor of myriad cyclic sesquiterpenes, so each sesquiterpene cyclase plays a critical role in governing the structural and stereochemical outcome of its particular cyclization reaction. Accordingly, sesquiterpene cyclase reactions maximize product diversity starting from a minimal substrate pool, indeed, a single substrate, and the structural basis of this catalytic diversity comprises a growing question at the interface of chemistry and biology. Aristolochene synthase is a 38-kDa monomeric sesquiterpene cyclase that has been cloned (2Proctor R.H. Hohn T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4543-4548Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and overexpressed (3Cane D.E. Wu Z. Proctor R.H. Hohn T.M. Arch. Biochem.

Soc. 1996; 118: 10037-10040Crossref Scopus (54) Google Scholar) indicate a complex cyclization cascade proceeding through at least two discrete intermediates. Aristolochene formation is the first committed step in the biosynthesis of a large group of sesquiterpenoid fungal toxins, the most lethal of which is the novel bis-epoxide PR-toxin (4Cane D.E. Rawlings B.J. Yang C-C. J. Antibiot. 1987; 40: 1331-1334Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the (+)-enantiomer of aristolochene is generated by the fungi P. roqueforti and A. terreus, but the (−)-enantiomer is generated by the plants Aristolochia indica (9Govindachani T.R. Mohamed P.A. Parthasarathy P.C. Tetrahedron. 1970; 26: 615-619Crossref Scopus (60) Google Scholar) and Bixa orella (10Lawrence B.M. Hogg J.W. Phytochemistry. 1973; 12: 2995Crossref Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Accordingly, each aristolochene synthase must provide a different template for binding the flexible polyisoprenoid substrate and subsequent intermediates in productive conformations leading to correct stereoisomer formation. The diastereomeric sesquiterpene epi-aristolochene (4-epi-eremophila-9,11-diene) has been identified in tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) (11Whitehead I.M. Threlfall D.R. Ewing D.F.

Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1994; 315: 527-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). This enzyme catalyzes the cyclization of farnesyl diphosphate by a mechanism similar in some respects to that ofP. roqueforti aristolochene synthase despite only 16% amino acid sequence identity (15Back K. Chappell J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7375-7381Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). However, the two enzymes must differ in how they precisely chaperone the conformation(s) of cyclization intermediates so as to control the exclusive formation of their respective diastereomeric sesquiterpene products, aristolochene orepi-aristolochene. To establish the structural basis for the formation of different product diastereomers by the fungal and plant cyclases, we now report the crystal structure of native recombinant P. roquefortiaristolochene synthase at 2.5-Å resolution and compare this structure with that of N. tabacum epi-aristolochene synthase (16Starks C.M. Back K. Chappell J. Noel J.P. Science. 1997; 277: 1815-1820Crossref PubMed Scopus (580) Google Scholar). Importantly, both enzymes contain conserved “aspartate-rich” DDXX(D/E) signature sequences that presumably bind catalytically obligatory Mg2+ ion(s) (2Proctor R.H. Hohn T.M. J. Biol.

With more than 300 cyclic sesquiterpenes identified to date, all deriving from the universal precursor farnesyl diphosphate (18Cane D.E. Accts. Chem.

From a glycerol stock of E. coli BL21(DE3) carrying pZW04, 5 ml of seed culture in LB-ampicillin was cultured at 37 °C overnight. 500 ml of prewarmed (30 °C) LB-ampicillin media in a 3-liter flask was inoculated with this overnight seed, giving an initial A at 600 nm of 0.05, and further incubated at 30 °C until the A reached 0.7–1.0. Isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was added to 0.5 mm final concentration to induce production of recombinant aristolochene synthase. Cells were harvested after a 4-h induction period, resuspended in 50 ml of cell lysis buffer (5 mmEDTA, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 20 mm Tris (pH 7.5)), and sonicated to disrupt cells. After three cycles (10-min sonication (30% power with 50% duty cycle) in ice water bath followed by 5 min rest on ice), lysed cells were centrifuged in a Sorvall GSA rotor at 6000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. Lysed cells were turbid prior to centrifugation because of the inclusion body present. Pellet was resuspended in the same buffer by stirring and recentrifuged to removes traces of the soluble fraction. At this stage, the purity of the enzyme was at least 60% as judged by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE).1 Washed precipitate was resuspended in 200 ml of the same buffer, and the inclusion body suspension was titrated with 0.1 m NaOH in an ice water bath while monitoring pH. As pH increased, the turbidity started to decrease until at pH 11.0–11.5 most of the turbidity was gone. After a 30-min incubation at high pH, the solution was titrated back to pH 8.5 with 0.1 m HCl. β-Mercaptoethanol was then added to a final concentration of 5 mm, and the protein solution was allowed to sit for 30 min. A final centrifugation at 6000 × g for 30 min (4 °C) yielded a supernatant that was decanted and diluted with cell lysis buffer to a final volume of 2 liters. DE52 cellulose anion exchange resin (80 ml) was dispersed into this 2-liter volume, and cyclase was allowed to bind to the resin during occasional stirring with a clean glass rod. Resin was packed into a glass column of 2.5 cm in diameter and washed with 200 ml of cell lysis buffer, and a linear gradient of 0–500 mm NaCl in cell lysis buffer was applied to elute enzyme activity. Activity eluted at approximately 150–200 mm NaCl. At this step, the enzyme was more than 90% pure as judged by SDS-PAGE. A second DE52 column was used to further improve purity. The DE52 pool from the first column was diluted 5-fold with cell lysis buffer and applied to a Q-Sepharose column (2.5 × 5 cm, total 25 ml). Enzyme was eluted with 500 ml of cell lysis buffer with a linear gradient of 0–0.5 m NaCl. Pooled enzyme was concentrated by Centriprep 30 (Amicon). Final enzyme purity was greater than 98% pure by SDS-PAGE analysis. Crystals of aristolochene synthase were grown at 4 °C by equilibrating a hanging drop containing 5 μl of 13 mg/ml aristolochene synthase and 5 μl of precipitant solution (4% polyethylene glycol 6000, 0.5 mNaCl) against 1 ml of precipitant solution in the well reservoir. Crystals generally appeared after 3 weeks and grew to approximate dimensions of 0.5 × 0.4 × 0.6 mm. Crystals belonged to tetragonal space group I422 with unit cell dimensions ofa = b = 208.2 Å, c = 139.6 Å. With two molecules in the asymmetric unit, the packing density V m = 4.82 Å3/Da corresponds to a relatively high solvent content of 72%. Crystals were transferred to a stabilization buffer (8% polyethylene glycol 6000, 1.0 mNaCl, 100 mm HEPES (pH 7.5)), and glycerol cryoprotectant was added gradually to a final concentration of 30% (v/v). Crystals were flash-cooled in liquid nitrogen and diffracted to 3.3-Å resolution using an R-AXIS IIc image plate detector mounted on a Rigaku rotating anode x-ray generator. Native data were also collected to 2.5-Å resolution on beamline X12B at the National Synchrotron Light Source in Brookhaven, NY. All data were processed using the program MOSFLM (25Leslie A.G.W. Moras D. Podjarny A.D. Thierry J.C. Crystallographic Computing 5.

Open table in a new tab Five heavy atom derivatives were used to phase the initial electron density map (Table I). Initial heavy atom sites were determined in difference Patterson maps, and additional heavy atom sites were located in subsequently calculated difference Fourier maps; heavy atom positions were refined with the program PHASES (27Furey W. Swaminathan S. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 277: 590-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). The model was fit into an electron density map calculated with solvent-flattened noncrystallographic symmetry averaged phases (28Abrahams J.P. Leslie A.G.W. Acta Crystallogr. Sect.

This model was then refined against the 2.5-Å resolution synchrotron data, and a total of 275 well ordered solvent molecules were located in the asymmetric unit. The quality of the model was improved by gradually releasing noncrystallographic symmetry constraints into appropriately weighted restraints as judged by R free. Refinement statistics are recorded in Table I. The final model has excellent stereochemistry with only 1 of 298 total residues (Ala-186) adopting a disallowed backbone conformation. Aristolochene synthase from P. roqueforti adopts the class I α-helical terpenoid cyclase fold (21Wendt K.U. Schultz G.E. Structure. 1997; 6: 127-133Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 31Lesburg C.A. Zhai G. Cane D.E. Christianson D.W. Science. 1997; 277: 1820-1824Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar), in which 6 α-helices (of 11 total helices) surround a large active site cleft approximately 15 Å wide by 20 Å deep (Fig. 2). Polypeptide loops connecting these helices are relatively short (average 5 residues) on the side of the protein distal to the active site and relatively long (average 12 residues) on the side of the protein proximal to (that is, surrounding) the active site cavity. This feature is a consequence of the helix packing arrangement necessary to form a roughly conical cleft. The longest loops surrounding the active site cavity are the “180s” loop (Asp-184—Ile-190), which forms one wall of the active site cleft, and a disordered “250s” loop (Asp-252—Leu-265) that flanks the mouth of the active site. Additionally, a 40-residue segment is disordered at the N terminus (Met-1—Thr-40), and a 5-residue segment (Thr-336—Asn-341) is disordered at the C terminus. The conserved aspartate-rich segment (DDVIE, beginning with Asp-115) is located on the upper wall of the active site cleft on helix C (Figs. 2and 3). This is the coordination site for the Mg2+ ion(s) necessary to trigger initial carbocation formation. Notably, a single Sm3+ ion binds to Asp-115 in the SmCl3 derivative used for phasing the initial electron density map. As found in the structure determination of avian farnesyl diphosphate synthase, Sm3+ is a good analogue for Mg2+, one Sm3+ ion binds to each of two aspartate-rich segments in this synthase (32Tarshis L.C. Yan M. Poulter C.D. Sacchettini J.C. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 10871-10877Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). One of the aspartate-rich segments of farnesyl diphosphate synthase (DDIMD, beginning with Asp-117) corresponds to the DDVIE segment of aristolochene synthase (Fig. 4), so this segment in aristolochene synthase is similarly implicated in binding the catalytically obligatory metal ion(s). In general, a trivalent metal ion binds ∼103-fold more tightly than a divalent metal ion to a carboxylate cluster, which is defined as 3–4 carboxylate groups located in a shallow cleft on a protein surface (33Needham J.V. Chen T.Y. Falke J.J. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 3363-3367Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Because carboxylate clusters discriminate more on the basis of ionic charge rather than ionic radius (33Needham J.V. Chen T.Y. Falke J.J. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 3363-3367Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), this rationalizes the facile binding of Sm3+ to the Mg2+-binding aspartate-rich segment of aristolochene synthase.Figure 4Evolution of sesquiterpene biosynthetic pathways. Structural comparison of terpenoid synthases reveals that each enzyme in the biosynthetic pathway is a variation of the “terpenoid synthase fold,” despite insignificant amino acid sequence identities. This structural comparison indicates evolutionary divergence of animal, plant, bacterial, and fungal cyclases from a common primordial ancestor.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The α-barrel fold of P. roqueforti aristolochene synthase bears a striking resemblance to that of N. tabacum epi-aristolochene synthase despite only 16% sequence identity. The N. tabacum synthase consists of a 281-residue C-terminal catalytic domain and a 240-residue N-terminal domain of unknown function (16Starks C.M. Back K. Chappell J. Noel J.P. Science. 1997; 277: 1815-1820Crossref PubMed Scopus (580) Google Scholar). Here too, the cyclization domain consists of 11 major helices arranged with identical topology and surrounding an active site cleft of similar dimensions and hydrophobicity, as found in the P. roqueforti cyclase. The cyclization domains of the fungal and plant cyclases are of the same approximate shape and dimensions, approximately 50 × 60 × 30 Å (Fig. 4). Despite minimal sequence identities (16–21%), the α-helical folds of a bacterial sesquiterpene cyclase, pentalenene synthase (31Lesburg C.A. Zhai G. Cane D.E. Christianson D.W. Science. 1997; 277: 1820-1824Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar), and avian farnesyl diphosphate synthase (32Tarshis L.C. Yan M. Poulter C.D. Sacchettini J.C. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 10871-10877Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar), are also highly similar to the α-helical fold of P. roqueforti aristolochene synthase (Fig. 4). This structural homology is reminiscent of suggestions that enzymes catalyzing successive steps in a biosynthetic pathway may evolve with similar structure through divergence, regardless of negligible amino acid sequence identity; function evolves more rapidly than sequence, and sequence evolves more rapidly than tertiary structure (34Reardon D. Farber G.K. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 497-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Despite the catalysis of strikingly different cyclization cascades, further structural homology between the fungal aristolochene synthase and terpenoid synthases from bacterial, plant, and animal species suggests a common primordial ancestor early in the evolution of terpene biosynthetic pathways prior to the divergence of plants, animals, bacteria, and fungi (Fig. 4). The active site of P. roqueforti aristolochene synthase is a 20-Å deep cleft lined with many hydrophobic aliphatic and aromatic residues that define a unique contour. Accordingly, this cleft serves as a template to bind the flexible farnesyl diphosphate substrate in the unique productive conformation leading to aristolochene formation as outlined by Cane and colleagues (4Cane D.E. Rawlings B.J. Yang C-C. J. Antibiot. 1987; 40: 1331-1334Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 5Cane D.E. Prabhakaran P.C. Salaski E.J. Harrison P.H.M. Noguchi H. Rawlings B.J. J. Am. Chem.

Soc. 1996; 118: 10037-10040Crossref Scopus (54) Google Scholar) (Fig. 5). Enzyme crystallized in the presence of 16 mm farnesol reveals electron density in the active site consistent with disordered binding of the substrate analogue (data not shown), indicating that coordination of the substrate diphosphate group to metal(s) bound by the aspartate-rich sequence plays an important role in anchoring the substrate conformation (35Caruthers J.M. Aristolochene Synthase Structure and Function. Ph.D. thesis. University of Pennsylvania, 2000Google Scholar). This is consistent with site-directed mutagenesis studies of trichodiene synthase, where alteration of metal binding residues resulted in the formation of aberrant cyclization products reflecting alternative substrate conformations (36Cane D.E. Xue Q. Fitzsimons B.C. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 12369-12376Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar).

Soc. 1996; 118: 10037-10040Crossref Scopus (54) Google Scholar) demonstrate that a unique conformation of the farnesyl diphosphate substrate is required to form the correct aristolochene stereoisomer, with compelling evidence for intermediates germacrene A and the eudesmane cation; the resulting mechanistic sequence is outlined in Fig. 5. Because the enzyme active site is a template that enforces the correct substrate conformation, we have modeled the pathway of aristolochene biosynthesis that incorporates this mechanistic information within the context of the enzyme active site (Fig. 6). Models of enzyme-substrate, -intermediate, and -product complexes were created by optimizing individual substrate and intermediate conformations using energy minimization routines in the program MacroModel (37Mohamadi F. Richards N.G.J. Guida W.C. Liskamp R. Lipton M. Caufield C. Chang G. Hendrickson T. Still W.C. J. Comput. Chem. 1990; 11: 440-467Crossref Scopus (3933) Google Scholar). Prior to energy minimization, molecular conformations were moderately restrained such that atoms involved in the reaction coordinate of carbon-carbon bond-making and bond-breaking steps (as illustrated in Fig. 5) were properly oriented to accommodate the required stereochemistry for each step. For example, the precatalytic substrate conformation was calculated by restraining the C-1 and C-10 atoms to be 3.3 ± 0.2 Å apart with the proper orientation of the π-electrons at C-10 toward the C-1–O ς* antibonding orbital in anticipation of the initial C-1–C-10 bond-making step to yield the germacrene A intermediate with S stereochemistry at the C-10 atom (the substrate numbering scheme is indicated in Fig. 5). The energy-minimized substrate, intermediate, and product conformations were then manually docked into the enzyme active site cleft. The substrate orientation was fixed so that the diphosphate leaving group could interact with metal ion(s) bound to the aspartate-rich sequence (as indicated by Sm3+ binding in the SmCl3 derivative). This particular interaction defined a unique precatalytic orientation of the substrate in the enzyme active site, there was only one way to fit the unique precatalytic substrate conformation required for the correct cyclization stereochemistry into the active site while constrained by specific diphosphate-metal-protein interactions. Indeed, the binding of the required substrate conformation in the active site was highly complementary to the contour of the active site, consistent with the role of the terpenoid cyclase as a template to enforce the proper starting conformation of the flexible isoprenoid substrate. The geometries of enzyme-substrate, -intermediate, and -product complexes were optimized by subjecting the manually docked complexes to conjugate gradient energy minimization with no experimental energy term in CNS (29Brünger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges N. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16979) Google Scholar). Two hundred cycles of minimization were performed with nonbonded interaction cutoff = 13 Å and dielectric constant = 1. In our model of the cyclization reaction (Fig. 6), the substrate isopropenyl group is positioned within a hydrophobic surface formed by Phe-112 and Phe-178 and also Leu-108, Leu-111, and Gly-205. Farnesyl diphosphate is positioned such that the C-10–C-11 π bond is oriented for attack at C-1 subsequent to (or concurrent with) metal-triggered diphosphate departure; metal ion(s) are liganded by residues in the aspartate-rich motif. After loss of the H12 proton, the germacrene A intermediate results with S stereochemistry. Enzymological studies with isotopically labeled substrates indicate that it is exclusively the cis-methyl group (C-12) that undergoes deprotonation (6Cane D.E. Prabhakaran P.C. Oliver J.S. McIlwaine D.B. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1990; 112: 3209-3210Crossref Scopus (68) Google Scholar); based on analysis of the enzyme active site, there is no apparent candidate for an enzyme general base to assist this deprotonation step. Possibly, the diphosphate leaving group could capture this proton. Subsequent protonation of the C-6 atom of germacrene A yields the tertiary C-7 carbocation, which is then attacked by the C-2–C-3 π-bond to form the eudesmane cation. Potentially, this could occur in concerted fashion. The conformation of germacrene A is enforced by Phe-112, ensuring that the proper face of the C-2–C-3 π-bond undergoes reaction to yield the proper stereoisomer of the eudesmane cation. Accordingly, the enzyme serves as a template throughout the cyclization cascade and chaperones the conformations of reactive intermediates once the reaction is underway. Inspection of the model suggests that the phenolic hydroxyl group of Tyr-92 is properly positioned to serve as a general acid in this step. Interestingly, site-directed mutagenesis experiments with epi-aristolochene synthase implicate Tyr-520 as a proton donor to germacrene A, which is identified as a key product in an abortive cyclization catalyzed by the Tyr-520 → Phe variant (38Rising K.A. Starks C.M. Noel J.P. Chappell J. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2000; 122: 1861-1866Crossref Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Although Tyr-92 of aristolochene synthase does not align with Tyr-520 of epi-aristolochene synthase, it is conceivable that each cyclase requires a different phenolic proton donor to facilitate the formation of opposite germacrene A stereoisomers; aristolochene synthase requires formation of theS-germacrene A intermediate, whereasepi-aristolochene synthase requires formation of theR-germacrene A intermediate. In the final step of the cyclization sequence, enzymological experiments with stereospecifically labeled substrates establish that a 1,2-hydride shift occurs trans to a methyl migration,i.e. they occur on opposite faces of the bicyclic ring system of the eudesmane cation, with final deprotonation of H8β,i.e. the proton cis to the migrating C-14 methyl group (6Cane D.E. Prabhakaran P.C. Oliver J.S. McIlwaine D.B. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1990; 112: 3209-3210Crossref Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The phenolate group of Tyr-92 is suitably oriented to accept this proton, which would complete the proposed role of Tyr-92 as a general acid/base in catalysis. Optimal 6-membered ring conformations that would support the tandem migrations and final deprotonation are half-chair for ring A (C-2, C-3, C-4, C-5 coplanar; this minimizes unfavorable 1,3-diaxial interactions with the migrating methyl group) and half-chair for ring B (C-2, C-7, C-8, C-9 coplanar). These conformations ensure the simultaneous and optimal alignment of the empty 2p z orbital on the C-3 carbocation, the C–H ς bond of the migrating hydride on C-2, the C–C ς bond of the migrating C-14 methyl group on C-7, and the C–H ς bond on C-8 of the H8β proton to be abstracted by the phenolate of Tyr-92. The final ring conformations in product aristolochene are chair for ring A and half-chair for ring B (C-2, C-7, C-8, C-9 coplanar due to the C-7–C-8 π bond). Active site aromatic residues appear to be optimally positioned to stabilize carbocation intermediates through cation-π interactions (39Ma J.C. Dougherty D.A. Chem. Rev. 1997; 5: 1303-1324Crossref Scopus (3342) Google Scholar). Specifically, Phe-178 and Phe-112 appear to be appropriately oriented (40Miklis P.C. Ditchfield R. Spencer T.A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1998; 120: 10482-10489Crossref Scopus (86) Google Scholar) to stabilize developing partial positive charge on C-1 in the first step of catalysis, and Trp-333 is appropriately oriented to stabilize positively charged C-3 in the eudesmane cation. Cation-π interactions comprise a highly effective chemical strategy for catalysis: electrostatic stabilization of high energy carbocation intermediates can be achieved without risk of quenching the carbocation and annihilating the protein catalyst, as would be the case if stabilization were achieved with nucleophilic protein residues. Additional electrostatic stabilization may result from the negative electrostatic surface potential present in the active site cleft (data not shown). The three-dimensional structure of P. roquefortiaristolochene synthase provides some clues regarding the stereospecificity of the cyclization cascade that distinguish this cyclase from N. tabacum epi-aristolochene synthase: why can't the P. roqueforti cyclase makeepi-aristolochene? According to our model, the key determinant of aristolochene stereochemistry at C-10 is the orientation of the C-10–C-11 π bond relative to the C-1 diphosphate leaving group in the first step of catalysis. The precatalytic farnesyl diphosphate conformation required by N. tabacum epi-aristolochene synthase (Fig. 5) is not compatible with the contour of the P. roqueforti aristolochene synthase active site, as inferred from the model of the aristolochene synthase-farnesyl diphosphate complex in Fig. 6. The substrate isopropenyl group is nestled within a hydrophobic niche formed by Phe-112 and Phe-178 (these residues are not conserved in N. tabacum epi-aristolochene synthase). The key determinant of product stereochemistry at C-2 and C-3 is the orientation of the C-2–C-3 π bond in the cyclization of the germacrene A intermediate: in P. roqueforti aristolochene synthase this orientation is fixed by Phe-112 to yield the bicyclic eudesmane cation with a trans-decalin configuration, whereas in N. tabacum epi-aristolochene synthase this orientation must be fixed to yield the bicyclic eudesmane cation with acis-decalin configuration. A cis-decalin conformation for this intermediate is incompatible with the contour of the P. roqueforti enzyme active site. Therefore, although the two enzymes cyclize farnesyl diphosphate to form hydrocarbon products of identical connectivity, the two enzymes provide very different active site contours in order to properly template and chaperone reactive conformations in catalysis. In conclusion, the four key features of the aristolochene synthase structure and mechanism are representative of those that must characterize the greater family of terpenoid cyclases: (a) the terpenoid cyclase provides a hydrophobic template with the proper contour for binding the flexible substrate in a catalytically productive conformation; (b) initial carbocation formation is triggered by coordination of the diphosphate leaving group to Mg2+ or Mn2+; (c) the conformations of reactive carbocation intermediates are chaperoned through a complex reaction sequence by the active site template; and (d) the hydrophobic active site cleft sequesters these intermediates from bulk solvent, and aromatic residues stabilize carbocation intermediates through local cation-π interactions as well as overall negative electrostatic surface potentials.

Human metalloelastase (MMP-12) is a macrophage-specific MMP with broad substrate specificity and is capable of degrading proteins found in the extracellular matrix of atheromas. Despite its potential importance, little is known about the regulation of MMP-12 expression in the context of atherosclerosis. In this study, we report that in human peripheral blood-derived macrophages, MMP-12 mRNA was markedly up-regulated by several pro-atherosclerotic cytokines and growth factors including interleukin-1β, tumor necrosis factor-α, macrophage colony-stimulating factor, vascular endothelial growth factor, and platelet-derived growth factor-BB. In contrast, the pleiotropic anti-inflammatory growth factor transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1) inhibited cytokine-mediated induction of MMP-12 mRNA, protein, and enzymatic activity. Analyses of MMP-12 promoter through transient transfections and electrophoretic mobility shift assays indicated that both its induction by cytokines and its inhibition by TGF-β1 depended on signaling through an AP-1 site at −81 base pairs. Moreover, the inhibitory effect of TGF-β1 on MMP-12 was dependent on Smad3. Taken together, MMP-12 is induced by several factors implicated in atherosclerosis.

Despite the importance of MMP-12 in conditions that range from atherosclerosis to aneurysm formation, arthritis, and emphysema (26Shapiro S.D. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 602-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (622) Google Scholar, 27Johnson L.L. Dyer R. Hupe D.J. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 1998; 2: 466-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar), the molecular basis of MMP-12 gene expression in these conditions is incompletely understood. The pleiotropic anti-inflammatory growth factor transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1) belongs to a family of growth factors that has diverse effects on cellular differentiation, activation, and proliferation (28Heldin C.H. Miyazono K. ten Dijke P. Nature. 1997; 390: 465-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (3349) Google Scholar). The downstream effects of TGF-β1 are mediated by a superfamily of proteins termed Smads. TGF-β signaling occurs through the formation of a heteromeric receptor complex of two serine/threonine kinase receptors, type I and type II. Upon TGF-β1 binding, the type II receptor phosphorylates the type I receptor. The type I receptor, once active, may then phosphorylate and activate Smads, which act as intracellular effectors by translocating to the nucleus to direct transcriptional responses (29Wrana J.L. Attisano L. Wieser R. Ventura F. Massague J. Nature. 1994; 370: 341-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (2114) Google Scholar). Of the three general classes of Smads, the pathway-restricted (or receptor-regulated) Smads, Smad2 and Smad3, become phosphorylated in the cytoplasm by the type I receptor in response to TGF-β1. Smad2 and Smad3 can then partner with Smad4, the common Smad, and translocate to the nucleus where they can regulate transcriptional responses (29Wrana J.L. Attisano L. Wieser R. Ventura F. Massague J. Nature. 1994; 370: 341-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (2114) Google Scholar). The third type of Smads are the so-called inhibitory Smads that include Smad6 and Smad7. These Smads may exert their inhibitory function by binding to the TGF-β1 type I receptor and preventing the phosphorylation of the receptor-regulated Smads, Smad2 and Smad3, thereby blocking downstream signaling (28Heldin C.H. Miyazono K. ten Dijke P. Nature. 1997; 390: 465-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (3349) Google Scholar). In human alveolar macrophages, Shapiro et al. (24Shapiro S.D. Kobayashi D.K. Ley T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23824-23829Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) found that MMP-12 mRNA is induced by lipopolysaccharide and inhibited by dexamethasone. To investigate mechanisms of MMP-12 expression that might apply in atherosclerosis, we studied the effect of cytokines and growth factors known to be present in atherosclerotic plaques on MMP-12 expression by human peripheral blood-derived macrophages. We identified several cytokines and growth factors that induced MMP-12 expression. This induction was prevented by treatment with TGF-β1. Analysis of the MMP-12 promoter by reporter gene transfection experiments implicated an AP-1 site (bp −81 to −75) in mediating cytokine inducibility. Inhibition by TGF-β1 occurred at least in part by preventing the increase in AP-1 protein binding. Furthermore, this TGF-β1 inhibitory effect was dependent on signaling through Smad3. Human peripheral blood monocytes were isolated from buffy coat (Blood Bank, The Children's Hospital, Boston) by the Ficoll-Paque centrifugation technique as described (30Coligan J.E. Kruisbeek A.M. Margulies D.H. Shevach E.M. Strober W. Current Protocols in Immunology. 2nd Ed. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1994: 7.11-7.15Google Scholar), with some modification. In brief, mononuclear cell preparations were washed twice in Hanks' balanced salt solution without calcium or magnesium and then resuspended in Iscove's modified Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% human serum type AB (Sigma), penicillin (100 units/ml), and streptomycin (100 μg/ml). Monocytes were seeded at a density of 1 × 107 cells per 150-mm dish and enriched by adherence during a 1-h incubation in a humidified incubator (37 °C, 5% CO2). Nonadherent cells were eliminated by three washes with Hanks' balanced salt solution. Cell viability was >95% as assessed by trypan blue exclusion, and monocyte purity was ∼90% as determined by nonspecific esterase staining. RAW264.7 cells (American Type Culture Collection) were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, penicillin (100 units/ml), and streptomycin (100 μg/ml). Cells were seeded at a density of 0.2 × 106 cells/ml. All cytokines were stored at −80 °C until use. Cytokines dissolved in phosphate-buffered saline (Life Technologies, Inc.), as described by the manufacturer, included recombinant human basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) (Collaborative Biomedical, Bedford, MA), platelet-derived growth factor-BB (PDGF-BB) (Collaborative Biomedical), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) (R & D Systems, Minneapolis, MN), and macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF) (Calbiochem). Recombinant IL-1β (Collaborative Biomedical), recombinant human TNF-α (Genzyme, Cambridge, MA), and 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) (Sigma) were used as supplied by the manufacturer. (All concentrations are indicated in the figure legends.) Total RNA was isolated from cultured cells by guanidinium isothiocyanate extraction and centrifugation through cesium chloride (31Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Short Protocols in Molecular Biology: A Compendium of Methods from Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. 3rd Ed. John Wiley & Sons, New York1993: 4.12-4.2.7Google Scholar). RNA was fractionated on a 1.3% formaldehyde-agarose gel and transferred to nitrocellulose filters. The filters were hybridized with 32P-labeled, random-primed cDNA probes as described (32Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 7.37-7.52Google Scholar, 33Perrella M.A. Yoshizumi M. Fen Z.

Hybridized filters were washed in 30 mm sodium chloride, 3 mmsodium citrate, and 0.1% SDS at 55 °C and autoradiographed on Kodak XAR film at −80 °C. The blots were hybridized with an 18 S oligonucleotide probe as a qualitative indicator of loading. The filters were scanned, and radioactivity was measured on a PhosphorImager running the ImageQuant software (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). After conditioned medium had been centrifuged (500 × g for 15 min at 4 °C), concentrated (25 times) by lyophilization, and solubilized in sample buffer, electrophoresis was performed under reducing conditions according to the method of Laemmli (34Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207233) Google Scholar). Samples were resolved through a 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Schleicher & Schuell) according to the method of Towbinet al. (35Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44924) Google Scholar). Membranes were blocked in 0.025 mTris, pH 8, 0.125 m NaCl, and 0.1% Tween 20 (TBST) containing 4% nonfat dry milk and hybridized with rabbit polyclonal anti-MMP-12 serum (1:1000 dilution, Triple Point Biologics). After three washes (20 min each) in TBST, the blots were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit secondary antibody (1:4000, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for 40 min. After three final washes (20 min each) in TBST, MMP-12 in the blots was visualized by an enhanced chemiluminescence method (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). MMP-12 enzymatic activity was determined by α-casein zymography as described (36Herron G.S. Banda M.J. Clark E.J. Gavrilovic J. Werb Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 2814-2818Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), with some modification. In brief, samples of concentrated conditioned medium were resolved through 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gels containing 2 mg/ml α-casein (Sigma) under nonreducing conditions. After electrophoresis, proteins were renatured by washing the gels twice (15 min each time) in 2.5% Triton X-100. The gels were then incubated in substrate buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 5 mm CaCl2, and 0.02% NaN3) at 37 °C for 60 h with gentle shaking and were stained with 0.1% Coomassie Blue R-250. Casein-degrading enzymatic activity was indicated by the appearance of clear bands against a dark background. Prestained molecular weight markers (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) were used for standardization. MMP-12 promoter deletion constructs were generated by using human genomic DNA and the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with the following forward 5′ primers derived from the published sequence (19Belaaouaj A. Shipley J.M. Kobayashi D.K. Zimonjic D.B. Popescu N. Silverman G.A. Shapiro S.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14568-14575Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar) as follows: (−1046), 5′-ACAATGGCTAAATCTTAACAC-3′; (−362), 5-TTATCTATAATGAATAT-3′; (−95), 5′-GATGATATCAACTATGAGTCACTC-3′; and (−75). 5′-CTCATAGGATTCATATTCACAG-3′. The same reverse primer was used for all the above 5′ deletion constructs at +39 (5′-TAAACTTCTAAACGGATCAAT-3′). XhoI andHindIII sites were added to facilitate cloning. PCR cycling conditions for Pfu DNA polymerase were as the manufacturer (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) suggested. The various DNA fragments were then digested and ligated into the XhoI andHindIII sites of pGL3-basic (Promega, Madison, WI) to produce (−1046/+39), (−362/+39), (−95/+39), and (−75/+39) pGL3-MMP12-luciferase. Reporter constructs containing fragments of the human MMP-12 5′-flanking sequence were named according to the location of the fragment from the transcription start site in the 5′ direction. The AP-1 site (−81 to −75 bp) within the MMP-12-luciferase reporter construct (−1046 to +39) was mutated by overlapping PCR mutagenesis. First, two fragments were generated. Fragment A from −1046 to −73 was created by PCR with the same forward primer at −1046 and an internal primer (antisense) containing the AP-1 mutation (underlined) 5′-GAGTGCCTCGTAGTTGATATCATCCC-3′. Fragment B (from −84 to +39) was created by using an internal primer (sense) containing the AP-1 mutation 5′-CTACGAGGCACTCATAGGATTC-3′ and the same reverse primer at +39. The two PCR products were then used as templates for PCR with the primers at −1046 and +39, which containedXhoI and HindIII sites, respectively, to facilitate cloning. The resulting PCR product was then digested withXhoI and HindIII and subcloned into the same sites of pGL3-basic to generate pGL3-MMP-12-(AP-1mut)-luciferase. MMP-12 cDNA probes of ∼1.2 kilobase pairs were generated by reverse transcription-PCR from human macrophage or murine RAW264.7 cell RNA with a forward primer (5′-ATGTGCTATTTGGTGAGAGA-3′) and a reverse primer (5′-GGAAGTTCTTGGTAATCAGT-3′). Smad expressions were all generated in cytomegalovirus-promoter expression constructs. The c-Jun expression construct was obtained from Michael Greenberg (Boston). The dominant-negative Smad3 expression construct (SmadΔC) was obtained from Rik Derynck (San Francisco). The PAI-1 promoter was obtained from Doug Vaughn (Nashville). Analysis of potential binding sites for sequence-specific transcription factors in the MMP-12 promoter was performed using the MatInspector Program (37Quandt K. Frech K. Karas H. Wingender E. Werner T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 4878-4884Crossref PubMed Scopus (2424) Google Scholar). All PCR products were sequenced from both orientations by the dideoxy chain termination method, with Thermosequenase (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), or on an automated DNA sequencer (Li-Cor, Lincoln, NE) according to the manufacturer's instructions. RAW264.7 cells were transfected with FugeneTM6 Transfection Reagent (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) on 6-well plates as described by the manufacturer. The total amount of plasmid DNA was kept constant within each experiment. Treatment with TPA (100 nm), TPA plus 30 min pretreatment with TGF-β1 (10 ng/ml), or control vehicle (ethanol) occurred 12 h after transfection. Cells were harvested for assays of luciferase and β-galactosidase activity 24 h later. Luciferase activity was normalized to β-galactosidase activity (to correct for differences in transfection efficiency) by cotransfecting pCMV-βgal plasmid (300 ng) (CLONTECH) in all experiments. Luciferase and β-galactosidase assays were performed on transfected cell lysates as described (38Perrella M.A. Patterson C. Tan L. Yet S.F. Hsieh C.M. Yoshizumi M. Lee M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13776-13780Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The ratio of luciferase to β-galactosidase activity for each transfection was normalized to pGL3-basic and expressed as relative luciferase activity. All transfections were performed in triplicate from at least three independent experiments. Nuclear extract was prepared from RAW264.7 cells treated for 24 h with TPA (100 nm), TPA plus TGF-β1 (10 ng/ml), or control vehicle (ethanol) as described (38Perrella M.A. Patterson C. Tan L. Yet S.F. Hsieh C.M. Yoshizumi M. Lee M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13776-13780Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). DNA probes corresponding to the AP-1 element at position −81 to −75 of the MMP-12 promoter were generated as two complementary oligonucleotides, 5′-TCAACTATGAGTCACTCATAG-3′ (sense) and 5′-CTATGAGTGACTCATAGTTGA-3′ (antisense). Oligonucleotides were annealed, end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP with T4 polynucleotide kinase, and purified further by Sephadex G-50 column chromatography (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The mutated (underlined) AP-1 oligonucleotides 5′-TCAACTACGAGGCACTCATAG-3′ (sense) and 5′-CTATGAGTGCCTCGTAGTTGA-3′ (antisense) were generated similarly. Nuclear extracts (2 μg) were preincubated for 15 min at room temperature with 1 μg of poly(dI-dC) in binding buffer (125 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 250 KCl, 0.5 mm EDTA, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 50% glycerol). Binding was initiated by adding 3 μl of probe (20,000 cpm) and allowing the mixture to incubate at room temperature for another 20 min. A consensus AP-1 oligonucleotide 5′-CGCTTGATGAGTCAGCCGGAA-3′ (sense) was obtained from Promega. Unlabeled competitor DNA was added in 50-mexcess. Samples were run at 200 V at 4 °C on a nondenaturing 5% Tris borate-EDTA polyacrylamide gel. Northern blot analysis was performed with human peripheral blood-derived macrophages that had been differentiated and stimulated with human recombinant IL-1β, TNF-α, M-CSF, VEGF, bFGF, PDGF-BB, or TPA for 72 h. MMP-12 mRNA was up-regulated by all of these cytokines and growth factors except bFGF (Fig.1). These results show that several cytokines and growth factors, commonly found in advanced atherosclerotic plaques, induce MMP-12 expression in human macrophages. Although TGF-β1 antagonizes the effects of many inflammatory cytokines, its effect on MMP induction by cytokines in human macrophages has not been previously characterized. Northern blot analysis showed that induction of MMP-12 mRNA by IL-1β was inhibited by TGF-β1 (Fig.2 A) and that this inhibition occurred in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 2 B). Moreover, TGF-β1(10 ng/ml) inhibited induction of MMP-12 mRNA when human macrophages were stimulated with a mixture of IL-1β, TNF-α, and M-CSF or with the phorbol ester TPA (Fig. 2 A). To assess whether the inhibitory effect of TGF-β1 on MMP-12 mRNA correlated with a change in protein and enzymatic levels, we performed Western blot and zymographic analyses. Conditioned medium was obtained from human macrophages grown under serum-free conditions with vehicle (control), IL-1β (20 ng/ml), or IL-1β (20 ng/ml) plus TGF-β1 (10 ng/ml) and analyzed by immunoblotting or casein zymography. By both Western analysis and casein zymography, IL-1β induced the active form of MMP-12 (22 kDa), and TGF-β1 inhibited this induction (Fig.2 C). Thus, TGF-β1 treatment inhibited cytokine-mediated induction of MMP-12 mRNA and led also to a reduction in the level of MMP-12 protein and enzymatic activity. MMP-12 mRNA is induced by TPA and inhibited by TGF-β1 in the RAW264.7 macrophage cell line (Fig.3 A). To elucidate the mechanism underlying MMP-12 mRNA induction, we performed experiments with the transcriptional inhibitor actinomycin D. RAW cells were stimulated for up to 6 h with TPA (100 nm), and actinomycin D (10 μg/ml) or vehicle control were added 30 min before stimulation. By Northern analysis (Fig. 3 B), actinomycin D blocked induction of MMP-12 mRNA, which suggests that induction occurred at the level of transcription. We have also measured the half-life of MMP-12 stimulated by TPA and found that TGF-β1 has no effect on its half-life (data not shown). To confirm further that cytokines induce MMP-12 and that inhibition by TGF-β1 occurs at the level of transcription, we performed reporter gene transfection experiments using a 1-kilobase pair fragment of the human MMP-12 promoter. This promoter has been shown to be active in the macrophage cell line P388D1 (19Belaaouaj A. Shipley J.M. Kobayashi D.K. Zimonjic D.B. Popescu N. Silverman G.A. Shapiro S.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14568-14575Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Because of the difficulty of transfecting primary human macrophages, we used the macrophage cell line RAW264.7. Treatment of RAW cells with TPA increased activity of the (−1046/+39) MMP-12 promoter by 5-fold (Fig. 4 A, top). When cells were treated with TGF-β1 (10 ng/ml), promoter activity was repressed by 50% (Fig. 4 A, top). Correcting for basal promoter activity, this correlated with a 67% reduction in cytokine inducibility. Cytokines and growth factors used in Fig. 1 are known to activate AP-1 proteins through a variety of cell signaling pathways. These pathways often involve members of the mitogen-activated protein kinases including Jun N-terminal, extracellular stimulus responsive, and Fos-regulating kinases (57Karin M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16483-16486Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2256) Google Scholar, 58Angel P. Karin M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1072: 129-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (3270) Google Scholar). Indeed, a similar level of induction occurred in response to M-CSF (Fig. 4 B). These results suggest that induction of the MMP-12 mRNA and inhibition of induction by TGF-β1 occurred, at least in part, at the level of transcription.Figure 4Transcriptional regulation of the MMP-12 promoter. 5′ deletion constructs (1.5 μg) of the MMP-12 promoter from −1046 to −75 bp were transiently transfected into RAW cells as described under “Experimental Procedures.” A, after transfection, cells were tested for responsiveness to vehicle control, TPA (100 nm), or TPA (100 nm) plus pretreatment (30 min) with TGF-β1 (10 ng/ml). B, cells were tested for responsiveness to vehicle control, M-CSF (750 units/ml), or M-CSF (750 units/ml) plus pretreatment (30 min) with TGF-β1 (10 ng/ml). Cells were harvested for luciferase and β-galactosidase activity after 24 h of incubation. A representative of three independent experiments is shown.

MEF2 has been reported to be associated with several distinct repressors including Cabin1(cain), MEF2-interacting transcriptional repressor (MITR), and HDAC4. It has been previously shown that Cabin1 is associated with MEF2 in a calcium-sensitive manner; activated calmodulin binds to Cabin1 and releases it from MEF2. However, it was not known whether the binding of HDAC4 and MITR to MEF2 is also regulated by calcium. We report that HDAC4 and MITR contain calmodulin-binding domains that overlap with their MEF2-binding domains. Binding of calmodulin to HDAC4 leads to its dissociation from MEF2, relieving MEF2 from the transcriptional repression by HDAC4.

MEF2 was first identified as a transcription factor that participates in the transcription of genes involved in muscle differentiation (25.Black B.L. Olsen E.N. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1998; 14: 167-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (853) Google Scholar). Four isoforms of MEF2 are known; they are designated MEF2A–D. Subsequent studies of the MEF2 family of proteins, however, have extended the physiological functions of MEF2 to non-muscle cells (26.Han T.H. Prywes R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2907-2915Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 27.Han J. Jiang Y. Li Z. Kravchenko V.V. Ulevitch R.J.

Science. 1999; 286: 785-790Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar). In particular, MEF2D has been shown to play a key role in T cell receptor (TCR)-mediated apoptosis during thymic negative selection. It mediates calcium-dependent transcription of Nur77, a key transcription factor involved in TCR-mediated apoptosis of thymocytes (29.Woronicz J.D. Calnan B. Ngo V. Winoto A. Nature. 1994; 367: 277-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar, 30.Liu Z.G. Smith S.W. McLaughlin K.A. Schwartz L.M. Osborne B.A. Nature. 1994; 367: 281-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar). MEF2D has been shown to bind to two calcium-responsive DNA elements in the Nur77 promoter and to mediate the calcium-dependent induction of Nur77 (31.Woronicz J.D. Lina A. Calnan B.J. Szychowski S. Cheng L. Winoto A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6364-6376Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). In the absence of TCR signaling, the expression of Nur77 is suppressed. We recently identified Cabin1/cain (32.Sun L. Youn H.D. Loh C. Stolow M. He W. Liu J.O. Immunity. 1998; 8: 703-711Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar, 33.Lai M.M.

Chem. 1998; 273: 18325-18331Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar) as a transcriptional repressor of MEF2 for the silencing of the Nur77 promoter in the absence of calcium signaling (34.Youn H.D. Sun L. Prywes R. Liu J.O. Science. 1999; 286: 790-793Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). Cabin1 binds to the MADS/MEF domain of MEF2 and represses transcriptional activity of MEF2 by recruiting a histone deacetylase complex consisting of mSin3A/HDAC1 and -2 on the MEF2-responsive DNA elements of Nur77 promoter. 2H.-D. Youn and J. O. Liu, unpublished results. Cabin1 dissociates from MEF2 in a calcium-dependent manner (34.Youn H.D. Sun L. Prywes R. Liu J.O. Science. 1999; 286: 790-793Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). The regulation of the Cabin1-MEF2 interaction by calcium and calmodulin represents the first case in which calcium/calmodulin regulates transcription by directly displacing a histone deacetylase-corepressor complex from a transcription factor. Recently, two additional repressors, HDAC4 and MEF2-interacting transcriptional repressor (MITR), have been shown to associate with MEF2 and repress its transcriptional activity (21.Miska E.A. Karlsson C. Langley E. Nielsen S.J. Pines J. Kouzarides T. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5099-5107Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar, 35.Sparrow D.B. Miska E.A. Langley E. Reynaud-Deonauth S. Kotecha S. Towers N. Spohr G. Kouzarides T. Mohun T.J. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5085-5098Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). However, it was not known whether the repression of MEF2 by HDAC4 and MITR is subjected to regulation by calcium. Nor was it clear whether the interaction between MEF2 and HDAC4 is relevant in regulating Nur77 expression. Herein we report that HDAC4 is a calmodulin-binding protein and that its association with MEF2 is regulated by calcium and calmodulin. Similar to Cabin1, HDAC4 binds to the N-terminal MADS/MEF domain of MEF2D and competes with p300 for the binding to MEF2. These results suggest that MEF2 is regulated by a family of calcium-dependent HDAC or HDAC-containing corepressor complexes. Jurkat T cells and DO11.10 T-hybridoma cells were grown in RPMI medium supplemented with 10% serum, 2 mm glutamine, and 50 units/ml streptomycin/penicillin. The mammalian expression vectors for the full-length and an N-terminal deletion mutant of HDAC4 were subcloned into pBJ5 vector as described previously (16.Grozinger C.M. Hassig C.A. Schreiber S.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4868-4873Crossref PubMed Scopus (654) Google Scholar). Both HDAC4 constructs were tagged with a Flag epitope at the C termini. The mammalian expression vector for HDAC4-(155–220) was subcloned into the pCS2+MT vector by inserting the corresponding polymerase chain reaction fragment into the EcoRI/XhoI sites. The bacterial expression vector (pGEX-HDAC4-(155–220)) was constructed by inserting the polymerase chain reaction fragment into the pGEX-KG vector at theBamHI and XhoI sites. Recombinant GST-HDAC4-(155–220) was purified from Escherichia coliDH5α harboring pGEX-HDAC4-(155–220) by conventional glutathione affinity chromatography. Other plasmids used in this study were described previously (34.Youn H.D. Sun L. Prywes R. Liu J.O. Science. 1999; 286: 790-793Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). T cells were lysed in a lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). The lysate was incubated with appropriate antibodies and protein A/G beads for 2 h before the beads were washed three times with lysis buffer. Immunoprecipitates were subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by Western blot with appropriate antibodies. Anti-HDAC4 antibodies were prepared as described previously (16.Grozinger C.M. Hassig C.A. Schreiber S.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4868-4873Crossref PubMed Scopus (654) Google Scholar); anti-MEF2 antibody was provided by R. Prywes (Columbia University); anti-Flag antibody was purchased from Sigma; and anti-c-myc antibody was from Babco. CaM-Sepharose was incubated with either cell lysates containing Flag-tagged HDAC4 or recombinant GST-HDAC4-(155–220) in the presence of either CaCl2 (2 mm) or EGTA (10 mm) for 2 h, washed three times with lysis buffer. Precipitates were subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by Western blot with anti-Flag antibodies or anti-GST antibodies. Jurkat cells were transfected by electroporation (250 V, 950 microfarads) with 10 μg of expression vectors, 2 μg of LacZ, 2.5 μg of luciferase reporter gene plasmids. After a 24-h incubation, transfected cells were treated with 40 nm PMA and 1 μm ionomycin overnight. Luciferase activity was measured and normalized to β-galactosidase activity. To prepare the35S-labeled MEF2D in vitro, 1 μg of pSG-MEF2 vector in which the MEF2 expression is under the control of the T7 promoter was sequentially reacted with T7 RNA polymerase and reticulocyte mixture per manufacturer's instructions (Novagen). We have previously shown that the minimal MEF2-binding domain of Cabin1 contains an overlapping CaM-binding domain, accounting for the regulation of Cabin1-MEF2 interaction by calcium and calmodulin (34.Youn H.D. Sun L. Prywes R. Liu J.O. Science. 1999; 286: 790-793Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). As HDAC4 has also been reported to bind to the N-terminal MADS/MEF2 domain of MEF2 and repress the MEF2 transcriptional activity (21.Miska E.A. Karlsson C. Langley E. Nielsen S.J. Pines J. Kouzarides T. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5099-5107Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar, 23.Wang A.H. Bertos N.R. Vezmar M. Pelletier N. Crosato M. Heng H.H. Th'ng J. Han J. Yang X.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7816-7827Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar), we wondered whether the interaction between HDAC4 and MEF2 is regulated by calcium in a similar manner. The minimal MEF2-binding domain of HDAC4 was reported to lie between amino acid residues 155 and 220. Sequence alignment of minimal MEF2-binding domain of HDAC4 with that of Cabin1 revealed that this domain also possesses features similar to other CaM-binding domains with a hydrophobic residue flanked by a basic region toward the N terminus and a predicted α-helix toward the C terminus (Fig. 1 A). To determine whether HDAC4 is a CaM-binding protein, Do11.10 T cell lysates containing Flag-epitope-tagged HDAC4 were incubated with CaM-Sepharose beads in the presence of either EGTA or CaCl2. Flag-HDAC4 is bound to CaM-Sepharose beads only in the presence of Ca2+, but not in its absence (Fig.1 B). The same protein did not bind to control Sepharose either in the presence or absence of calcium. To assess whether the binding of Flag-HDAC4 to CaM-Sepharose is direct, we investigated the interaction between recombinant GST-HDAC4-(155–220) and CaM-Sepharose. Recombinant GST-HDAC4-(155–220), which spans at the MEF2-binding domain of HDAC4, bound to CaM-Sepharose beads in the presence of Ca2+ (Fig. 1 C), suggesting that HDAC4 is a CaM-binding protein and that the CaM-binding domain of HDAC4 overlaps the MEF2-binding domain of HDAC4. Similar to Cabin1, the minimal CaM-binding domain of HDAC4 lies within the MEF2-binding region, suggesting that binding of CaM to HDAC4 and that of MEF2 is mutually exclusive. To test this possibility, we generated 35S-MEF2D by in vitro transcription and translation, expressed Flag-HDAC4 in Jurkat T cells, and examined the binding of Flag-HDAC4 to MEF2D by coimmunoprecipitation in the presence or absence of Ca2+. 35S-MEF2D was immunoprecipitated with Flag-HDAC4 by an anti-Flag antibody in the presence of EGTA. The presence of Ca2+ significantly decreased the binding, presumably through competition from CaM in the Jurkat cell lysates (Fig. 2 A). The effect of calcium on the interaction between HDAC4 and MEF2D was further confirmed with endogenous proteins. Thus, endogenous MEF2D from DO11.10 T cell lysates coimmunoprecipitated with HDAC4 only in the presence of EGTA (Fig. 2 B), consistent with the notion that activated CaM abrogates the interaction between HDAC4 and MEF2D, as has been observed for the interaction between Cabin1 and MEF2D (34.Youn H.D. Sun L. Prywes R. Liu J.O. Science. 1999; 286: 790-793Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). It has been shown that HDAC4 inhibits the activation of the minimal MEF2-responsive element of the c-Jun promoter and Gal4-HDAC4 represses the activation of a Gal4-responsive reporter gene (21.Miska E.A. Karlsson C. Langley E. Nielsen S.J. Pines J. Kouzarides T. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5099-5107Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar, 23.Wang A.H. Bertos N.R. Vezmar M. Pelletier N. Crosato M. Heng H.H. Th'ng J. Han J. Yang X.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7816-7827Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). As the two MEF2-binding sites are the primary Ca2+-responsive elements in the Nur77 promoter, it was most likely that HDAC4 also represses transcription from the Nur77 promoter. When Jurkat T cells were transfected with HDAC4 along with the Nur77 (−1148)-luciferase reporter gene, which contains an 1148-base pair Nur77 promoter fragment, HDAC4 inhibited the reporter gene in response to stimulation by PMA and ionomycin (data not shown). It has been known that two MEF2-responsive elements reside within the fragment spanning nucleotides −307 to −242 (31.Woronicz J.D. Lina A. Calnan B.J. Szychowski S. Cheng L. Winoto A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6364-6376Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). We determined if HDAC4 repressed the MEF2-mediated activation of Nur77 using pNur77 (−307 to −242)-luciferase reporter gene. As expected, full-length HDAC4 inhibited the MEF2-responsive luciferase activity in response to treatment with PMA and ionomycin (Fig.3 A). To investigate which domain of HDAC4 is involved in the repression of MEF2 transcriptional activity, we generated deletion mutants of HDAC4 and determined their ability to inhibit the Nur77 (−307 to −242)-luciferase reporter gene activation. The deletion mutant of HDAC4 lacking the N-terminal MEF2-binding domain (HDAC4-(612–1048)) no longer inhibited the Nur77 reporter gene activation. In contrast, the minimal MEF2-binding domain of HDAC4 (HDAC4-(155–220)) was capable of inhibiting the minimal Nur77 reporter gene activation, albeit with a lower potency than the full-length of HDAC4 (Fig. 3 A). These results suggest that both the N-terminal MEF2-binding domain and the C-terminal catalytic domain of HDAC4 are required for the full repression of MEF2 and that binding of the minimal MEF2-binding domain to MEF2 can down-regulate its transcriptional activity independent of HDAC activity. It has been shown that HDAC4 binds to the N-terminal MADS/MEF domain of MEF2 (21.Miska E.A. Karlsson C. Langley E. Nielsen S.J. Pines J. Kouzarides T. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5099-5107Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar). We further verified that the MADS/MEF domain of MEF2 is necessary for the repression of MEF2 by HDAC4 using fusion proteins between either the Gal4 DNA-binding domain or the VP16 activation domain and various fragments of MEF2D. Although the activation of the Gal4-dependent luciferase reporter gene by Gal4-MEF2D fusion protein was inhibited by overexpression of HDAC4, that mediated by either Gal4-VP16 or Gal4-MEF2D-(91–514) that lacked the MADS/MEF domain of MEF2D was resistant to coexpression of HDAC4. These results indicated that the N-terminal MADS/MEF domain is necessary for inhibition of MEF2 transcriptional activity by HDAC4. Furthermore, activation of the Nur77 reporter gene by fusion proteins between either the full-length MEF2C and MADS/MEF domain of MEF2C-(1–117) or the transactivation domain of VP16 was inhibited by HDAC4 (Fig.3 C), suggesting that the MADS/MEF domain of MEF2 is sufficient to mediate its repression by HDAC4. The coactivator p300 has been shown to bind to the MADS domain of MEF2 (36.Sartorelli V. Huang J. Hamamori Y. Kedes L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1010-1026Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). The same domain has also been reported to bind to HDAC4 (21.Miska E.A. Karlsson C. Langley E. Nielsen S.J. Pines J. Kouzarides T. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5099-5107Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar, 23.Wang A.H. Bertos N.R. Vezmar M. Pelletier N. Crosato M. Heng H.H. Th'ng J. Han J. Yang X.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7816-7827Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). These observations raised the possibility that HDAC4 may compete with p300 for MEF2 binding. We have found that both the N- and the C-terminal domains of p300 bind to MEF2D with the C-terminal domain having a higher affinity for MEF2D than that of N-terminal domain.2 We thus used the C-terminal domain of p300 to determine whether the minimal MEF2-binding domain of HDAC4 competed with p300 for binding to MEF2. DO11.10 cells were transfected with Flag-p300-(1737–2414), Flag-HDAC4, and c-myc-MEF2D, respectively. Cells transfected with each plasmid were divided into two aliquots and lysed in a lysis buffer containing either CaCl2 or EGTA. The cell lysates containing c-myc-MEF2D were incubated with those containing Flag-HDAC4 for 1 h in the presence of CaCl2or EGTA, followed by addition of cell lysates containing Flag-p300-(1737–2414). After a 2-h incubation, c-myc-MEF2D was immunoprecipitated with anti-c-myc antibodies. As shown in Fig.4 A, there was little binding between p300 and MEF2D in the presence of EGTA. In the presence of calcium, however, a dramatic increase was observed in the amounts of p300 bound to MEF2D (Fig. 4 A). Together with the demonstration the HDAC4 is bound to MEF2D only in the presence of EGTA (Fig. 2 A), these results are consistent with the competition between HDAC4 and p300 for binding to MEF2D. As p300 and HDAC4 have opposite effects on MEF2 transcriptional activity, we turned to the Nur77 reporter gene to assess the competition between p300 and HDAC4 for MEF2 in vivo. When Jurkat cells were transfected with pNur77 (−307 to −242)-luciferase reporter gene and increasing amounts of p300, p300 increased the Nur77 reporter gene activity in a dose-dependent fashion (Fig.4 B). Coexpression of HDAC4 led to a dose-dependent cancellation of the enhancement of the reporter gene activity by p300. Thus, the p300 HAT and HDAC4 are capable of turning on and off the Nur77 promoter by mutual competition for MEF2 binding. The presence of a CaM-binding domain in HDAC4 confers calcium dependence to the competitive binding of HDAC4 and Cabin1 to MEF2, which is likely to be partly responsible for the silencing and activation of Nur77 and other MEF2 target genes in the absence and presence of calcium signaling, respectively. TCR-mediated expression of members of the Nur77 family plays a key role in thymocyte apoptosis (37.Winoto A. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1997; 9: 365-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). MEF2 has been shown to mediate calcium-dependent transcriptional activation of Nur77 (31.Woronicz J.D. Lina A. Calnan B.J. Szychowski S. Cheng L. Winoto A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6364-6376Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). That MEF2 is constitutively bound to the promoter of Nur77 regardless of calcium status in cells has implicated the existence of MEF2 repressors that keeps MEF2 in an inactive state. We recently identified Cabin1 as a transcriptional corepressor of MEF2 (34.Youn H.D. Sun L. Prywes R. Liu J.O. Science. 1999; 286: 790-793Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the repression of MEF2 by Cabin1 is sensitive to calcium signaling. In the presence of calcium, Cabin1 is released from MEF2, enabling its transcriptional activity. In addition to Cabin1, three other MEF2-specific transcriptional corepressors, HDAC4, HDAC5, and MITR, were recently reported. Like Cabin1, HDAC4, HDAC5, and MITR were shown to bind to MEF2 and inhibit its transcriptional activity. Although transcriptional repression of MEF2 by HDAC5 has recently been reported to be regulated by CaM kinase IV (22.Lu J. McKinsey T.A. Nicol R.L. Olson E.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 4070-4075Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar), it was not known whether the transcriptional repression by HDAC4 and MITR is also sensitive to calcium. Through sequence comparison, we identified a putative CaM-binding domain with the minimal MEF2-binding domain of HDAC4 as well as that of MITR (Fig. 1 A). We showed that HDAC4 is a CaM-binding protein. Furthermore, the binding of CaM to HDAC4 releases it from MEF2, offering a mechanism of derepression of MEF2 by calcium and CaM. Although MITR has not been subjected to the same scrutiny, its association with MEF2 is likely to be regulated in the same fashion given that a CaM-binding domain is also found within its MEF2-interacting domain. The same is likely to be true for HDAC5 given its significant similarity to HDAC4 in general and the MEF2-binding domain in particular. Thus, at least four MEF2 corepressors have been identified, and they appear to be functionally redundant. However, the ways they recruit histone deacetylase activity for chromatin remodeling are clearly different. Whereas Cabin1 recruits HDAC1 and -2 through the corepressor mSin3, MITR directly recruits HDAC1/2. The interaction of HDAC4 or HDAC5 and MEF2 is most direct among all four corepressors of MEF2 with a MEF2-binding domain and the HDAC catalytic domain residing within the same polypeptide. These alternative modes of HDAC recruitment have been seen for other corepressors. Similar to Cabin1, MAD and N-CoR indirectly recruit HDAC1/2 through mSin3. Unlike Cabin1 but similar to MITR, both Rb and TGIF directly recruit HDAC1/2 (38.Brehm A. Miska E.A. McCance D.J. Reid J.L. Bannister A.J. Kouzarides T. Nature. 1998; 391: 597-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (1077) Google Scholar,39.Magnaghi-Jaulin L. Groisman R. Naguibneva I. Robin P. Lorain S. Le Villain J.P. Troalen F. Trouche D. Harel-Bellan A. Nature. 1998; 391: 601-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (804) Google Scholar). Each of these corepressors is specific for a distinct transcription factor. It remains unclear why four different repressors exist for MEF2. One explanation may be that each one is optimized for silencing a different region of the promoter when anchored to the chromatin through interaction with MEF2. It is imaginable that the Cabin1-mSin3-HDAC complex may be optimal for silencing chromatin located further away from the MEF2-binding site than MITR and HDAC4/HDAC5. In addition, these corepressors may be expressed at different levels both temporally and spatially during and after development. In fact, Cabin1 has been found to be expressed predominantly in thymus, whereas HDAC4 has been found to be expressed predominantly in muscle and brain (12.Fischle W. Emiliani S. Hendzel M.J. Nagase T. Nomura N. Voelter W. Verdin E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11713-11720Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar, 16.Grozinger C.M. Hassig C.A. Schreiber S.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4868-4873Crossref PubMed Scopus (654) Google Scholar, 23.Wang A.H. Bertos N.R. Vezmar M. Pelletier N. Crosato M. Heng H.H. Th'ng J. Han J. Yang X.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7816-7827Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). One common feature of all known transcriptional corepressors is their ability to recruit histone deacetylases to remodel the chromatin into a transcriptionally incompetent state. HDAC activity has been shown to be crucial for transcriptional repression. It follows that deletion of the domain necessary for recruiting histone deacetylase activity would render a repressor inactive. It is thus somewhat surprising that the minimal MEF2-binding domain of HDAC4, which lacks histone deacetylase catalytic domain, is still able to inhibit MEF2-dependent activation of the minimal Nur77 promoter (Fig. 3) (23.Wang A.H. Bertos N.R. Vezmar M. Pelletier N. Crosato M. Heng H.H. Th'ng J. Han J. Yang X.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7816-7827Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). The HDAC-independent inhibition of MEF2 by HDAC5 has also been reported (24.Lemercier C. Verdel A. Galloo B. Curtet S. Brocard M.-P. Khochbin S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15594-15599Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). These results can now be explained by the mutually exclusive binding of HDAC4 and the coactivator p300 as they both bind to the N-terminal MADS/MEF domain of MEF2. In this respect, HDAC4 is similar to TGIF, a Smad repressor, which has also been shown to compete with p300 for the binding to Smad (40.Wotton D. Lo R.S Lee S. Massague J. Cell. 1999; 97: 29-39Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar). Thus, HDAC4 represses MEF2 by a “two-hit” mechanism, one through its HDAC activity and the other through competition for MEF2 against the coactivator p300. We have found that the Cabin1 also operates through the “two-hit” mechanism. 3H.-D. Youn, T. A. Chatila, and J. O. Liu, unpublished results. As an important second messenger, calcium is known to regulate the transcription of a large number of genes. Given the role of chromatin remodeling by HDACs in the repression of transcription, it is not surprising that association of HDACs or HDAC-containing repression complexes with a transcription factor is regulated by calcium signaling. We have previously shown that the repression of MEF2 by Cabin1 is regulated by calcium and calmodulin. In this manuscript, we demonstrated that HDAC4 is a CaM-binding protein itself and that its association with MEF2 is regulated by calcium and CaM. It is likely that the interaction between MITR and MEF2 is regulated by calcium and CaM in a similar fashion. Furthermore, the presence of the putative CaM-binding domain in two other Class II HDACs, HDAC5 and HDAC7, suggests that they are also likely to be bound to and regulated by CaM. Together, HDAC4, HDAC5, and HDAC7, along with Cabin1 and MITR, represent an emerging family of transcriptional repressors that provides a link between calcium signaling and chromatin remodeling.

https://openalex.org/W2131672649,"Both Ser16 and Thr17 of phospholamban (PLB) are phosphorylated, respectively, by cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) and Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII). PLB phosphorylation relieves cardiac sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ pump from inhibition by PLB. Previous studies have suggested that phosphorylation of Ser16 by PKA is a prerequisite for Thr17 phosphorylation by CaMKII and is essential to the relaxant effect of β-adrenergic stimulation. To determine the role of Thr17 PLB phosphorylation, we investigated the dual-site phosphorylation of PLB in isolated adult rat cardiac myocytes in response to β1-adrenergic stimulation or electrical field stimulation (0.1–3 Hz) or both. A β1-adrenergic agonist, norepinephrine (10−9–10−6m), in the presence of an α1-adrenergic antagonist, prazosin (10−6m), selectively increases the PKA-dependent phosphorylation of PLB at Ser16in quiescent myocytes. In contrast, electrical pacing induces an opposite phosphorylation pattern, selectively enhancing the CaMKII-mediated Thr17 PLB phosphorylation in a frequency-dependent manner. When combined, electric stimulation (2 Hz) and β1-adrenergic stimulation lead to dual phosphorylation of PLB and exert a synergistic effect on phosphorylation of Thr17 but not Ser16. Frequency-dependent Thr17 phosphorylation is closely correlated with a decrease in 50% relaxation time (t 50) of cell contraction, which is independent of, but additive to, the relaxant effect of Ser16phosphorylation, resulting in hastened contractile relaxation at high stimulation frequencies. Thus, we conclude that in intact cardiac myocytes, phosphorylation of PLB at Thr17 occurs in the absence of prior Ser16 phosphorylation, and that frequencydependent Thr17 PLB phosphorylation may provide an intrinsic mechanism for cardiac myocytes to adapt to a sudden change of heart rate. Both Ser16 and Thr17 of phospholamban (PLB) are phosphorylated, respectively, by cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) and Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII). PLB phosphorylation relieves cardiac sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ pump from inhibition by PLB. Previous studies have suggested that phosphorylation of Ser16 by PKA is a prerequisite for Thr17 phosphorylation by CaMKII and is essential to the relaxant effect of β-adrenergic stimulation. To determine the role of Thr17 PLB phosphorylation, we investigated the dual-site phosphorylation of PLB in isolated adult rat cardiac myocytes in response to β1-adrenergic stimulation or electrical field stimulation (0.1–3 Hz) or both. A β1-adrenergic agonist, norepinephrine (10−9–10−6m), in the presence of an α1-adrenergic antagonist, prazosin (10−6m), selectively increases the PKA-dependent phosphorylation of PLB at Ser16in quiescent myocytes. In contrast, electrical pacing induces an opposite phosphorylation pattern, selectively enhancing the CaMKII-mediated Thr17 PLB phosphorylation in a frequency-dependent manner. When combined, electric stimulation (2 Hz) and β1-adrenergic stimulation lead to dual phosphorylation of PLB and exert a synergistic effect on phosphorylation of Thr17 but not Ser16. Frequency-dependent Thr17 phosphorylation is closely correlated with a decrease in 50% relaxation time (t 50) of cell contraction, which is independent of, but additive to, the relaxant effect of Ser16phosphorylation, resulting in hastened contractile relaxation at high stimulation frequencies. Thus, we conclude that in intact cardiac myocytes, phosphorylation of PLB at Thr17 occurs in the absence of prior Ser16 phosphorylation, and that frequencydependent Thr17 PLB phosphorylation may provide an intrinsic mechanism for cardiac myocytes to adapt to a sudden change of heart rate. phospholamban cAMP-dependent protein kinase sarcoplasmic reticulum norepinephrine protein phosphatase 1 calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II Phospholamban (PLB)1 is the major regulator of cardiac sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca2+-ATPase and Ca2+ transport across the SR membrane, thereby modulating myocardial relaxation (for review see Ref.1.Simmerman H.K.B.

Over the last two decades, intensive studies have been focused on the physiological significance of the dual site phosphorylation of PLB. These previous studies in perfused hearts or in vivo have provided several lines of evidence leading to the concept that Ser16 phosphorylation is a prerequisite for phosphorylation of Thr17 and that Ser16 phosphorylation is largely responsible for β-adrenergic modulation of cardiac relaxation (4.Lindemann J.P.

Recent studies in transgenic mice overexpressing the Ser16 → Ala16 PLB mutant have further demonstrated that prevention of Ser16phosphorylation abolishes Thr17 phosphorylation and attenuates β-adrenergic responses (19.Luo W. Chu G. Sato Y. Zhou Z. Kadambi V.J. Kranias E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4734-4739Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Thus, it is widely accepted that phosphorylation of PLB at Ser16 is obligatory for Thr17 phosphorylation and that Ser16phosphorylation is the dominant molecular event responsible for accelerated cardiac relaxation. However, in vitro studies in the isolated SR membranes have consistently indicated that Ser16 and Thr17 can be readily and independently phosphorylated by PKA and CaMKII, respectively, and that when both are phosphorylated, there is an additive interaction (20.Bilezikjian L.M. Kranias E.G. Potter J.D. Schwartz A. Circ. Res. 1981; 49: 1356-1362Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar,21.Simmerman H.K. Collins J.H. Theibert J.L. Wegener A.D. Jones L.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 13333-13341Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The apparent discrepancy between in vivo and in vitro PLB phosphorylation is yet to be reconciled. To resolve this paradox and to further address the relative contribution of PKA- and CaMKII-mediated PLB phosphorylation in beat-to-beat cardiac functional modulation, individually we manipulated PKA activity, using β-adrenergic stimulation in quiescent rat ventricular myocytes, and CaMKII activity, by electrically pacing the myocytes at different stimulation frequency (0.1–3 Hz) in the absence of β-adrenergic stimulation. Both stimuli were also combined to explore possible interactions between PKA- and CaMKII-mediated signaling. Under those experimental conditions, we measured PLB phosphorylation at Ser16 and Thr17 as well as relaxation time of cell contraction. Here, we report our surprising findings that electrical stimulation alone increases CaMKII-dependent phosphorylation of PLB at Thr17 in a frequency-dependent manner without altering PKA-mediated Ser16 phosphorylation, that phosphorylation of Thr17 is markedly enhanced by β-adrenergic stimulation in the electrically paced but not in quiescent myocytes, and that Thr17 phosphorylation is associated with a significant relaxant effect, regardless of β-adrenergic stimulation. Single ventricular myocytes were isolated from adult rat (2–4-month old) hearts by a standard enzymatic technique (22.Spurgeon H.A. Stern M.D. Baartz G. Raffaeli S. Hansford R.G. Talo A. Lakatta E.G. Capogrossi M.C. Am. J. Physiol. 1990; 258: H574-H586PubMed Google Scholar). The cells were suspended in HEPES buffer, pH 7.4, containing (in mmol/liter): 20 HEPES, 1 CaCl2, 137 NaCl, 5 KCl, 15 dextrose, 1.3 MgSO4, and 1.2 NaH2PO4. Cells were kept at rest or stimulated at different frequencies ranging from 0.1 to 3 Hz at 23 °C, and cell length was monitored from the bright-field image by an optical edge tracking method using a photodiode array (model 1024 SAQ, Reticon) with a 3-ms time resolution (22.Spurgeon H.A. Stern M.D. Baartz G. Raffaeli S. Hansford R.G. Talo A. Lakatta E.G. Capogrossi M.C. Am. J. Physiol. 1990; 258: H574-H586PubMed Google Scholar). The half-time of contractile relaxation (t 50) was measured as the time from cell peak shortening to 50% relaxation. The detection of site-specific PLB phosphorylation was performed as described previously (9.Kuschel M. Zhou Y.-Y. Cheng H. Zhang S.-J. Chen Y. Lakatta E.G. Xiao R.-P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22048-22052Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Briefly, a 500-μl suspension of isolated rat ventricular myocytes was stimulated over a wide range of frequencies (0.1–3 Hz) at 23 °C. Following a 5-min stimulation, 4× sample buffer was added, and the samples were frozen in liquid nitrogen. For β1-adrenergic stimulation, myocytes were incubated with norepinephrine (NE, 10−9–10−6m) and prazosin (10−6m) for 10 min. In another subset of experiments, myocytes were first incubated with NE (10−7m) plus prazosin (10−6m) for 5 min and then were stimulated electrically (at 2 Hz) for another 5 min in the continued presence of β1-adrenergic stimulation. Samples were solubilized prior to electrophoresis at 95 °C for 5 min to fully dissociate PLB into its monomers. Following electrophoresis, proteins were transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (PVDF, Sigma), which was probed with the phosphorylation site-specific PSer16 and PThr17 PLB antibodies (PhosphoProtein Research). Protein concentration was determined by the method of Lowry et al. (23.Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using ovalbumin as standard. Following incubation with a peroxidase-conjugated antibody (Dianova), films were exposed to the chemiluminescence (ECL, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) reaction and quantified with a video documentation system (Bio-Rad). Results are presented as the mean ± S.E. Statistical significance was determined by Student'st test, the Mann-Whitney test (when variances were significantly different), or one-way analysis of variance, when appropriate. Values with p < 0.05 were considered statistically significant. Freshly isolated single rat quiescent ventricular myocytes were challenged by NE (10−9–10−6m), a β1-adrenergic receptor agonist, in the presence of an α1-adrenergic antagonist, prazosin (10−6m). Phosphorylation of Ser16 or Thr17 in response to β1-adrenergic stimulation was determined by immunoblots with anti-PSer16 PLB and anti-PThr17 PLB antibodies. As shown in Fig. 1, NE increased PKA-mediated PLB phosphorylation at Ser16 in a dose-dependent manner, with an EC50 of ∼10−7m. In contrast, NE, even at the maximal concentration (10−6m), had only a very minor effect on CaMKII-dependent phosphorylation of Thr17 (Fig.1). To examine PLB phosphorylation at the CaMKII site Thr17, myocytes were electrically paced for 5 min at frequencies ranging from 0.1 to 3.0 Hz. Fig. 2 shows the response of Ser16 or Thr17 PLB phosphorylation to stimulation frequency in the absence of β-adrenergic stimulation. There was a near linear increase in Thr17 PLB phosphorylation with increasing stimulation frequency, and the phosphorylation was not yet saturated at the highest stimulation frequency (147.70 ± 13.98 at 3 Hz versus 44.07 ± 11.35 at rest, p < 0.01). In the same cells, however, no significant PKA-mediated PLB phosphorylation at Ser16was observed at any stimulation frequency. The pattern of Ser16 and Thr17 phosphorylation induced by electrical stimulation alone was thus opposite to that in quiescent cells induced by β-adrenergic stimulation, suggesting that CaMKII-mediated Thr17 PLB phosphorylation can occur independent of any prior Ser16 PLB phosphorylation in intact cardiac myocytes. To further investigate possible interactions between the PKA and CaMKII phosphorylation sites, we measured site-specific PLB phosphorylation using electrical stimulation in conjunction with β1-adrenergic stimulation. Following a 5-min incubation with 10−7m NE plus 10−6m prazosin, myocytes were either kept at rest or electrically paced at 2 Hz for another 5 min in the continued presence of NE. Electrical stimulation had no significant effect on NE-induced Ser16 PLB phosphorylation (Fig.3 A). In contrast, β1-adrenergic stimulation markedly augmented the frequency-dependent PLB phosphorylation at Thr17, resulting in a 3-fold augmentation compared with that in the absence of β-adrenergic stimulation (Fig. 3 B). Thus, there is a synergistic interaction between electrical stimulation and β-adrenergic stimulation in conferring Thr17 PLB phosphorylation, whereas the effect of β-adrenergic stimulation on Ser16 phosphorylation is independent of electrical stimulation. To determine the functional role of Thr17PLB phosphorylation, we examined the t 50 of contraction in the absence as well as in the presence of β1-adrenergic stimulation in rat cardiomyocytes. We found that in the absence of β1-adrenergic stimulation,t 50 after a 5-min pacing period was abbreviated relative to t 50 of the first post-rest beat. The higher the pacing frequency, the briefer the t 50of relaxation (t 50 values: 326.5 ± 11.32 ms for post-rest; and 299.74 ± 13.84, 281.16 ± 11.84, 251.19 ± 8.31, 222.23 ± 6.21, and 205.1 ± 5.42 ms for steady state stimulation at 0.1, 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, 3.0 Hz, respectively). Fig. 4 C shows that the frequency-dependent abbreviation of 50% relaxation time was linearly correlated to the frequency-dependent increase in Thr17 PLB phosphorylation but was totally dissociated from Ser16 phosphorylation (which remained unchanged during electrical pacing) (Fig. 2). In the presence of β1-adrenergic stimulation, the first post-rest beat relaxed 14.1% faster relative to NE-untreated cells (Fig.4 B), and this was accompanied by an enhanced PLB phosphorylation occurring exclusively at the PKA site (Figs. 1 and3 A). The relaxant effect of NE was almost doubled by the application of 2 Hz electrical stimulation (Fig. 4 B). Concomitantly, the enhanced relaxant effect was accompanied by a markedly potentiated Thr17 phosphorylation (Fig.4 A) in the absence of any change in Ser16 PLB phosphorylation (Fig. 3 A), suggesting that the increased Thr17 PLB phosphorylation has an additive effect to hasten relaxation during combined β1-adrenergic and electrical stimulation. There are four major findings in the present study. First, β-adrenergic receptor stimulation in quiescent ventricular myocytes increases PKA-dependent phosphorylation of PLB at Ser16 and accelerates the relaxation rate of the first post-rest beat, with little effect on the CaMKII-dependent phosphorylation of Thr17 (Fig. 1). This observation is consistent with the previous notion that Ser16 is the direct and dominant site for PKA-mediated phosphorylation underlying β-adrenergic relaxant effect. Second, and more importantly, in the absence of β-adrenergic stimulation, electrical stimulation enhances phosphorylation of PLB at Thr17 in a frequency-dependent manner without altering the phosphorylation status of Ser16 (Fig. 2). These results suggest that phosphorylation states of Ser16 and Thr17 can be regulated independently in intact cardiac myocytes. Third, a combination of the β1-adrenergic agonist, NE (10−7m), and electrical stimulation (at 2 Hz) induces dual phosphorylation of PLB at Ser16 and Thr17, exhibiting a synergistic effect on Thr17 but not Ser16 phosphorylation (Fig. 3). Finally, we provided direct evidence that the frequency-dependent Thr17 PLB phosphorylation is associated with a significant relaxant effect, independent of β-adrenergic-receptor stimulation (Fig. 4). The observations described above indicate that CaMKII-dependent Thr17 phosphorylation can occur independent of PKA-mediated Ser16 phosphorylation and is likely involved in the modulation of cardiac relaxation. This conclusion is in contrast to the well accepted sequential model of PLB phosphorylation at Ser16 and Thr17 (4.Lindemann J.P. Jones L.R. Hathaway D.R. Henry B.G. Watanabe A.M. J. Biol.

Several differences between the present and previous studies may account for the different outcomes. First, our experimental setting permits either a selective PKA activation (β1-adrenergic stimulation in quiescent cardiac myocytes) or a selective CaMKII activation (electrical stimulation in the absence of β-adrenergic stimulation), avoiding possible cross-talk between PKA and CaMKII signaling pathways. In contrast, most previous studies were performed in vivo, or in isolated beating hearts, and could not distinguish the primary effects of PKA from its secondary effects via interaction with the CaMKII signaling pathway (see below). Additionally, using site-specific antibodies for PSer16 or PThr17 PLB with an appropriate exposure time for the chemiluminescence reaction (see “Experimental Procedures”), we have greatly improved the sensitivity to detect a low level phosphorylation of PLB in the present study. Our results indicate that the increase in Thr17 PLB phosphorylation induced by electrical stimulation (2 Hz) is ∼30% of that induced by a combined β-adrenergic and electrical stimulation (∼15% of the total phosphorylation of PLB). This relatively low level of PLB phosphorylation could have been overlooked in previous studies, particularly when it was measured by32P incorporation into PLB. It is noteworthy that although previous studies have demonstrated the reliability and specificity of the site-specific antibodies for PSer16 and PThr17 PLB (12.Kuschel M. Karczewski P. Hempel P. Schlegel W.P. Krause E.-G. Bartel S. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: H1625-H1633PubMed Google Scholar, 16.Mundina-Weilenmann C.M.DE Vittone L. Ortale M. de Cingolani G.C. Mattiazzi A. J. Biol.

Chem. 1994; 269: 25073-25077Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), a recent study (25.Mayer E.J. Huckle W. Johnson R.G. McKenna E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 267: 40-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) shows poor reactivities of those antibodies with dual-phosphorylated PLB. If this were the case, we might underestimate the degree of the sequential PLB phosphorylation. However, this is unlikely, because the present results show that in the presence of both electrical and β-adrenergic stimuli anti-PSer16 and anti-PThr17 detected a clear increase in the phosphorylation of both sites (Fig. 3 and4). Finally, it has been proposed that in vivo or in beating hearts, the dependence of Thr17 phosphorylation on prior Ser16 phosphorylation is due to a counteraction of protein phosphatases on phosphoproteins (16.Mundina-Weilenmann C.M.DE Vittone L. Ortale M. de Cingolani G.C. Mattiazzi A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 33561-33567Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). In principle, a low level of protein phosphatase activity in freshly isolated myocytes relative to that found in vivo might also explain the discrepancy between this and previous reports (4.Lindemann J.P. Jones L.R. Hathaway D.R. Henry B.G. Watanabe A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 464-471Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12.Kuschel M. Karczewski P. Hempel P. Schlegel W.P. Krause E.-G.

However, this explanation is unlikely because in quiescent cardiac myocytes β-adrenergic stimulation increases Thr17 PLB phosphorylation only in the presence of protein phosphatase inhibitors (either okadaic acid or calyculin A), 2R.-P. Xiao, D. Hagemann, and W. Zhu, unpublished data. suggesting that protein phosphatases are rather active in intact isolated cardiac myocytes. It is noteworthy that the increase in phosphorylation at the CaMKII site Thr17 in response to a combination of NE and 2 Hz electrical stimulation is much greater than the summation of its separate responses to these two stimuli (Fig. 3), suggesting a synergistic interaction between β-adrenergic and electrical stimuli. The most plausible explanation is that β-adrenergic stimulation indirectly enhances Thr17 phosphorylation through cross-talking with CaMKII signaling pathway. For instance, β-adrenergic stimulation elevates CaMKII activity by enhancing sarcolemmal L-type Ca2+currents (I Ca), SR Ca2+ cycling, and intracellular Ca2+ transients (26.Bean B.P. Nowycky M.C. Tsien R.W. Nature. 1984; 307: 371-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar, 27.Xu A. Hawkins C. Narayanan N. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 1997; 29: 405-418Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 28.Xiao R.-P. Lakatta E.G. Circ. Res. 1993; 73: 286-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). This mechanism appears to be minimized in the absence of intracellular Ca2+ transients, as evidenced by the insensitivity of Thr17 phosphorylation to β-adrenergic stimulation in quiescent myocytes (Fig. 1). In addition to the Ca2+-dependent cross-talk, PKA may also enhance CaMKII signaling by inhibiting protein phosphatase 1 (PP1), which is the major phosphatase dephosphorylating PLB (29.MacDougall L.K. Jones L.R. Cohen P Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 28: 725-734Crossref Scopus (186) Google Scholar), either by direct inhibition of PP1 activity via phosphorylation of its regulatory subunit (29.MacDougall L.K. Jones L.R. Cohen P Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 28: 725-734Crossref Scopus (186) Google Scholar) or by indirect inhibition of the phosphatase via phosphorylation and subsequent activation of endogenous phosphatase inhibitor 1 (30.Cohen P. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1989; 58: 453-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (2156) Google Scholar, 31.Gupta R.C. Neumann J. Watanabe A.M. Lesch M. Sabbah H.N. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: H1159-H1164PubMed Google Scholar). Both mechanisms prevent PP1 from dephosphorylating PLB. In this regard, it has been shown that in beating hearts, a protein phosphatase inhibitor, okadaic acid, permits Thr17 PLB phosphorylation in response to high extracellular [Ca2+], in the absence of β-adrenergic stimulation (16.Mundina-Weilenmann C.M.DE Vittone L. Ortale M. de Cingolani G.C. Mattiazzi A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 33561-33567Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Regardless of the specific mechanism, the potent effect of β-adrenergic stimulation to enhance CaMKII signaling may masquerade as a sequential phosphorylation of Ser16 and Thr17 under certain experimental conditions. The present results indicate that CaMKII-mediated phosphorylation of PLB at Thr17 is linearly correlated to the increase in stimulation frequency. The strong frequency dependence of Thr17 phosphorylation may be attributed largely to an intrinsic “memory” ability of CaMKII. Recent studies have demonstrated that CaMKII undergoes autophosphorylation during activation (13.Braun A.P. Schulman H. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1995; 57: 417-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (738) Google Scholar). The autophosphorylated CaMKII retains some kinase activity even in the interval of intracellular Ca2+transients, leading to an accumulative CaMKII activation during high frequency stimulation (13.Braun A.P. Schulman H. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1995; 57: 417-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (738) Google Scholar). The intrinsic memory property of CaMKII makes Thr17 PLB phosphorylation unique as compared with PKA-mediated Ser16phosphorylation. As a result of frequency-dependent CaMKII activation, phosphorylation of Thr17 PLB may function as a frequency detector of heart rate; the higher the heart rate and the more frequent intracellular Ca2+ transients, the greater is CaMKII-mediated Thr17 PLB phosphorylation. Because frequency-dependent Thr17 PLB phosphorylation is closely associated with the frequency-dependent acceleration of relaxation (Fig. 4), CaMKII-mediated Thr17PLB phosphorylation may provide a constant beat-to-beat intrinsic regulation of cardiac contractile kinetics. In summary, the present results provide the first documentation that in intact cardiac myocytes, frequency-dependent Thr17 PLB phosphorylation by CaMKII occurs independently of PKA-mediated Ser16 phosphorylation. The increase in phosphorylation of Thr17 PLB is associated with a profound relaxant effect. These conclusions not only challenge the traditional sequential model of PLB phosphorylation but also suggest a novel autoregulatory mechanism in cardiac beat-to-beat functional modulation.

In this study, we have demonstrated that amino-terminal domains of two microfibrillar proteins, fibrillin-1 and fibrillin-2, interact with tropoelastin in solid phase binding assays. The tropoelastin-binding site was localized to a region beginning at the glycine-rich and proline-rich regions of fibrillin-2 and fibrillin-1, respectively, and continuing through the second 8-cysteine domain. Characterization of the binding requirements using the fibrillin-2 construct found that a folded, secondary structure was necessary for binding. Furthermore, binding between tropoelastin and fibrillin was mediated by ionic interactions involving the lysine side chains of tropoelastin. The importance of the lysine side chains was corroborated by the finding that the fibrillin-2 construct did not bind to mature elastin, whose lysine side chains have been modified to form cross-links. Interestingly, there was no interaction between the fibrillin constructs and tropoelastin in solution phase, suggesting that binding of tropoelastin to a solid substrate exposes a cryptic binding site. These results suggest that fibrillin plays an important role in elastic fiber assembly by binding tropoelastin and perhaps facilitating side chain alignment for efficient cross-linking.

Functional elastin is an insoluble matrix of polymerized monomeric subunits termed tropoelastin. Tropoelastin exhibits a modular domain structure consisting of repeating hydrophobic sequences, which contribute to the elasticity of the molecule, and lysine-rich regions that are involved in intra- and intermolecular cross-linking (1Mecham R. Davis E. Yurchenco P. Birk D. Mecham R. Extracellular Matrix Assembly and Structure. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego1994: 281-314Crossref Google Scholar). Cross-linking of tropoelastin monomers is initiated when the ε-amino groups of lysine residues within tropoelastin become oxidized by the copper-requiring enzyme lysyl oxidase. Subsequent non-enzymatic condensation of modified and unmodified lysines then form the characteristic bifunctional and tetrafunctional cross-links specific to insoluble elastin (2Reiser K. McCormick R.J. Rucker R.B. FASEB J. 1992; 6: 2439-2449Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar, 3Kagan H.M. Trackman P.C. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1991; 5: 206-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). Proper cross-linking is essential for elastin function as is demonstrated by weak and mechanically compromised elastic tissue associated with lathyrism, copper deficiency, and in the disease Menkes' syndrome (4Christiano A.M. Uitto J. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1994; 103: 53-57Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), conditions that effect the amount or the activity of lysyl oxidase. As assessed by immunohistochemical and immunoelectron microscopic techniques, tropoelastin always co-localizes with extracellular matrix structures termed microfibrils. Microfibrils are 10–12-nm filaments first identified as obligatory components of elastic fibers, although they are also found in non-elastic tissues, such as in the ciliary zonules of the eye (5Cleary E. Gibson M. Int. Rev. Connect. Tissue Res. 1983; 10: 97-209Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Rotary shadowing electron microscopy reveals microfibrils as linear arrays of electron dense “beads” separated by ∼50 nm with filamentous “strings” (6Ren Z. Brewton R. Mayne R. J. Struct. Biol. 1991; 106: 57-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 7Wright D. Mayne R. J. Ultrastruct. Mol. Struct. Res. 1988; 100: 224-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 8Wallace R. Streeten B. Hanna R. Curr. Eye Res. 1991; 10: 99-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Microfibrils are comprised predominantly of two proteins, fibrillin-1 (fib-1)1 and fibrillin-2 (fib-2) (9Sakai L. Keene D. Engvall E. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 103: 2499-2509Crossref PubMed Scopus (902) Google Scholar, 10Sakai L.Y. Keene D.R. Glanville R.W. Baechinger H.P. J. Biol.

Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 855-863Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). Fib-1 and fib-2 have significant similarity in primary sequence and predicted protein domains (11Zhang H. Apfelroth S. Hu W. Davis E. Sanguineti C. Bonadio J. Mecham R. Ramirez F. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 855-863Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar, 12Pereira L. D'Alessio M. Ramirez F. Lynch J. Sykes B.

Genomics. 1993; 17: 476-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). For example, each possesses tandem arrays of EGF-like and 8-cysteine (8-Cys) domains, the latter being first described in latent transforming growth factor-β-binding protein-1 (14Kanzaki T. Olofsson A. Morén A. Wernstedt C. Hellman U. Miyazono K. Claesson-Welsh L. Heldin C.-H. Cell. 1990; 61: 1051-1061Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar). There is one region of each protein, however, that is distinctive; exon 10 of fib-1 encodes a proline-rich region, whereas the analogous exon in fib-2 is rich in glycine. These domains are found in similar positions within the fibrillin proteins. Although the function of microfibrils in the extracellular space is not fully characterized, one role is to act as a molecular scaffold for the deposition and alignment of tropoelastin molecules (1Mecham R. Davis E. Yurchenco P. Birk D. Mecham R. Extracellular Matrix Assembly and Structure. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego1994: 281-314Crossref Google Scholar, 15Ross R. Fialkow P. Altman L. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1976; 79: 7-15Crossref Scopus (60) Google Scholar). This alignment presumably allows for the proper cross-linking and maturation of the elastin fiber. The prevalence of the fibrillins within microfibrils makes them candidates for the binding and alignment of tropoelastin molecules. We have assessed the ability of tropoelastin to bind to recombinantly expressed, amino-terminal fragments of fib-1 and fib-2 using solid phase binding assays and co-immunoprecipitation experiments, focusing on domains where fib-1 and fib-2 sequences are most divergent, the proline-rich region in fib-1 and the glycine-rich domain in fib-2. We were interested especially in fib-2 since it has been suggested that fib-2 preferentially localizes to elastin-rich matrices (11Zhang H. Apfelroth S. Hu W. Davis E. Sanguineti C. Bonadio J. Mecham R. Ramirez F. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 855-863Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). We have determined that a tropoelastin-binding domain is contained within the amino-terminal half of fib-2, and we have mapped at least one active site to a region that contains the Gly-rich region, downstream EGF-like loops, and most of the second 8-Cys domain. Binding to tropoelastin was not unique to fib-2, however, since the analogous region of fib-1 also interacted with tropoelastin. Interestingly, neither fibrillin fragment interacted with tropoelastin in solution phase when co-expressed in CHOK1 cells, suggesting that a cryptic binding site is exposed when tropoelastin binds a two-dimensional surface such as a plastic dish or, perhaps, a highly insoluble fibrillin-containing microfibril. All materials were obtained through Sigma unless otherwise stated. Oxalic acid-solubilized bovine elastin (α-elastin) was purchased from Elastin Products Co. (Owensville, MO). Tissue culture reagents and supplements were provided by the Washington University Tissue Culture Support Center. Recombinant human tropoelastin produced in bacteria was purified as described (16Indik Z. Abrams W.R. Kucich U. Gibson C., W. Mecham R.P. Rosenbloom J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1990; 280: 80-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). NLR3e/6 and Aik have been described previously (17Trask T.M. Ritty T.M. Broekelmann T. Tisdale C. Mecham R.P. Biochem. J. 1999; 340: 693-701Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). NLR3/6 consists of fib-2 sequences from bp −144 to +3342 (Met-1 to Thr-1114), whereas Aik spans bp +1274 to +2256 (Gly-425 to Phe-752) (Fig. 1). Fib-2 cDNA sequences can be accessed by GenBankTM accession number U03272, and our numbering refers to this sequence (11Zhang H. Apfelroth S. Hu W. Davis E. Sanguineti C. Bonadio J. Mecham R. Ramirez F. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 855-863Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar, 18Zhang H. Hu W. Ramirez F. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 1165-1176Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). PET spans bp +1168 to +2165 (Ser-390 to Ser-722) (Fig. 1), and its construction has been described in Trasket al. (17Trask T.M. Ritty T.M. Broekelmann T. Tisdale C. Mecham R.P. Biochem. J. 1999; 340: 693-701Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Fib-1 cDNA sequences are numbered according to Pereira et al. (12Pereira L. D'Alessio M. Ramirez F. Lynch J. Sykes B. Pangilinan T. Bonadio J. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1993; 2: 961-968Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar) (GenBankTM accession number L13923). Cloning of the LEEC construct and its expression in CHOK1 cells has been described (19Ritty T.M. Milewicz D.M. Mecham R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8933-8940Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) Both Aik and PET contain the fib-2 sequence from bp −201 to +137 (Met-1 to Gln-46) at their amino termini, which serves as a leader sequence for secretion (17Trask T.M. Ritty T.M. Broekelmann T. Tisdale C. Mecham R.P. Biochem. J. 1999; 340: 693-701Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Expression of NLR3e/6, Aik, and PET in CHOK1 cells using the pEE14 mammalian expression vector (20) is described elsewhere (17Trask T.M. Ritty T.M. Broekelmann T. Tisdale C. Mecham R.P. Biochem. J. 1999; 340: 693-701Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Antibody against Aik was generated using bacterially expressed Aik protein (17Trask T.M. Ritty T.M. Broekelmann T. Tisdale C. Mecham R.P. Biochem. J. 1999; 340: 693-701Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The anti-Gly antibody (αGly) was raised against a subfragment of the fib-2 cDNA construct, Aik, spanning bp +1274 to +1488 (Gly-425 to Asp-496), which contains most of the unique glycine-rich region specific for fib-2. ABamHI/EcoRV fragment of Aik/pBS.SK− was cloned into pQE32 cut with BamHI/SmaI. Due to cloning constraints, the residues MRGSHHHHHHGIPRAA are amino-terminal to Gly-425, and the amino acids GSTCSQA are carboxyl-terminal to Asp-496. Purification was performed as described by Trask et al.(17Trask T.M. Ritty T.M. Broekelmann T. Tisdale C. Mecham R.P. Biochem. J. 1999; 340: 693-701Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). An antibody specific for fib-1 (αPro) was raised against the proline-rich region of fib-1 expressed in bacteria as described by Trask et al. (17Trask T.M. Ritty T.M. Broekelmann T. Tisdale C. Mecham R.P. Biochem. J. 1999; 340: 693-701Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Tropoelastin-specific antibodies were raised against human tropoelastin expressed in bacteria and purified over a reverse-phase C-18 HPLC column (16Indik Z. Abrams W.R. Kucich U. Gibson C., W. Mecham R.P. Rosenbloom J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1990; 280: 80-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Serum-free media from 24- to 28-h incubations with transfected cells were centrifuged to remove cell debris, and aliquots were run on polyacrylamide gels containing SDS-PAGE gels. All samples contained 50 mm dithiothreitol (DTT). Transfer of proteins to nitrocellulose and incubation with antibodies were described by Trasket al. (17Trask T.M. Ritty T.M. Broekelmann T. Tisdale C. Mecham R.P. Biochem. J. 1999; 340: 693-701Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). To determine whether the recombinant proteins containedN-linked sugars, confluent P100 dishes of transfected cells were incubated in the presence or absence of 5 μg/ml tunicamycin (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). A second treatment of tunicamycin was added after 7 h of conditioning. The following day, the conditioned media were collected and centrifuged. Aliquots were run on SDS-PAGE gels and transferred to nitrocellulose, and proteins of interest were detected by Western blotting. Aik and NLR3e/6 were detected with the αGly antibody; PET was detected with αPro antibody. The presence of O-linked sugars was detected using Jacalin beads bound to Sepharose 4B (Vector Laboratories, Inc., Burlingame, CA). The Jacalin lectin specifically recognizes O-linked sugars, preferring the structure galactosyl-β-1,3-N-acetylgalactosamine. Conditioned media were precleared with Sepharose 4B for 90 min at room temperature. The Sepharose beads were pelleted, and Jacalin beads were added to the supernatant and incubated at 4 °C overnight. The supernatants were collected, and all beads were washed five times with PBS. Bound material was eluted with SDS-PAGE sample buffer (62.5 mmTris, pH 6.8, 0.4% (w/v) SDS, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 0.003% (w/v) bromphenol blue) including 100 mm DTT. Samples were run on SDS-PAGE gels and subjected to Western blotting. For experiments using unpurified protein, serum-free conditioned medium from transfected cells was extensively dialyzed against 0.1× PBS at 4 °C with at least three buffer changes. The dialyzed material was lyophilized and then resuspended in 0.5% (w/v) non-fat milk, water at 1/10th the original volume (to give a 10× concentrate of protein in 1× PBS). The pH was adjusted to ∼7 as necessary. Flat-bottomed microtiter plates (Nunc Maxisorp, Rochester, NY) were coated with purified human recombinant tropoelastin (16Indik Z. Abrams W.R. Kucich U. Gibson C., W. Mecham R.P. Rosenbloom J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1990; 280: 80-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), bovine α-elastin, or bovine serum albumin (BSA) at 10 μg/ml in 14 mm sodium bicarbonate, 6 mm sodium carbonate (bicarbonate buffer) overnight at 4 °C. Plates were washed three times with PBS, 0.5% (v/v) Tween 20 before blocking nonspecific binding sites with 5% (w/v) non-fat milk/PBS. Binding was carried out with various dilutions of the 10× protein concentrate in 0.5% (w/v) milk/PBS at 37 °C for 60 min. In assays including purified protein, 0.5% (w/v) BSA/PBS was used in place of non-fat milk for this step. Plates were then washed, incubated at 37 °C for 60 min in primary antibody diluted 1:1000 in 0.5% (w/v) milk/PBS, washed again, and then incubated with goat anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase-linked secondary antibody (Bio-Rad) diluted 1:2000 in 0.5% (w/v) milk/PBS. Bound protein was quantified with a colorimetric assay using the ATBS-substrate reagent (Kirkegaard & Perry Laboratories, Inc., Gaithersburg, MD) for 10 min at room temperature. Plates were read at a wavelength of 410 or 415 nm. Experiments were done in triplicate wells. To assess the ionic requirements for binding, the concentration of sodium chloride was increased in the binding reaction, taking into account that PBS contains 137 mm sodium chloride. Aik and PET were concentrated from HyQ-CCM5 (HyClone Laboratories, Inc., Logan, UT) conditioned media and were purified by reverse-phase HPLC as described (17Trask T.M. Ritty T.M. Broekelmann T. Tisdale C. Mecham R.P. Biochem. J. 1999; 340: 693-701Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The C4 column was equilibrated in 80% (v/v) 10 mm ammonium acetate (pH 5.5), 20% (v/v) acetonitrile. Protein was eluted using a linear gradient of 20–70% acetonitrile at a flow rate of 150 ml/h. Fractions were dried under vacuum and resuspended in PBS. Aik/CHO and PET/CHO cells were cultured in the presence of 150 μCi/ml [35S]sulfate (specific activity <100 mCi/mmol, ICN) for 5 h in sulfate- and serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 1 mm sodium pyruvate and 100 μm each of non-essential amino acids. Cells were cultured separately in the presence of 40 μCi/ml [35S]cysteine (specific activity >800 Ci/mmol, ICN, Costa Mesa, CA) in cysteine- and serum-free DMEM as a positive control. The conditioned medium was centrifuged to pellet any detached cells. To the medium was added BSA to 10 μg/ml, protein A-Trisacryl beads (Pierce), and polyclonal antibody at a final concentration of 25–50 μg/ml. Immunoprecipitation was done at 4 °C overnight. The Trisacryl beads were washed four times with PBS, 0.5% Tween 20 and then eluted in SDS-PAGE sample buffer containing DTT. To inhibit the sulfation of Aik, potassium chlorate was added to the medium prior to conditioning to a final concentration of 1.5 mg/ml per treatment. To confirm inhibition, cells were radiolabeled with [35S]sulfate for 5 h before immunoprecipitation. For non-sulfated Aik used in the binding assay, the cells were allowed to condition the sulfate-free media overnight with 2–3 treatments of chlorate without radiolabel. This medium was used for the binding assays with BSA added to 5 mg/ml. To control for possible direct effects of chlorate on binding to tropoelastin (rather than via inhibition of the sulfation of Aik), chlorate was added to a final concentration of 1.5 mg/ml to untreated conditioned medium and incubated at 37 °C for 30 min before use in the binding assay. Tropoelastin at 1.2 mg/ml was diluted 1:1 with a saturated sodium acetate solution and kept on ice. 1 μl of acetic anhydride was added for each milligram of tropoelastin, equally distributed over four additions in 60 min on ice. After the reaction was complete, the tropoelastin was diluted in bicarbonate buffer and plated onto microtiter wells. Mock-treated tropoelastin was prepared using the same procedure but without including acetic anhydride in the saturated sodium acetate solution. Human tropoelastin, cloned into the EcoRI site in the pEE14 expression vector (18 μg), was transfected into Aik/CHO and PET/CHO cells in P100 dishes using liposome technology. 48 h after transfection, the cells were incubated with 40 μCi/ml [35S]cysteine and 50 μCi/ml [4,5-3H]leucine (specific activity 40–60 Ci/mmol, ICN) for 5 h in serum-free supplemented DMEM (lacking cysteine and leucine). The medium was collected and centrifuged to remove any detached cells. The cell layer was washed three times with PBS and then lysed in 150 mm sodium chloride, 0.5% (w/v)n-octyl β-d-glucopyranoside, 50 mmTris, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 mm benzamidine, 2 mm ε-aminocaproic acid, pH 7.0 (OBG buffer) at room temperature for 10 min. The cell layer was scraped from the dish and centrifuged to pellet the insoluble material. The medium and soluble cell lysate (which includes soluble extracellular matrix components) were subject to immunoprecipitation as described above using anti-Aik, anti-Pro, or anti-TE polyclonal antibodies. Both were incubated with Trisacryl/protein A beads without primary antibody (preclear) for 30 min at 37 °C. Immunoprecipitation was performed for 60–90 min at 37 °C. Immunoprecipitates from Aik/CHO transfectants were washed in PBS, 0.5% (v/v) Tween 20, and the PET immunoprecipitates were washed with OBG buffer. All samples were eluted from the beads in reducing sample buffer. The samples were run on SDS-PAGE gels, fixed, enhanced, and subject to fluorography. Polyclonal antibodies specific for fib-1 or fib-2 have been difficult to obtain because of the high degree of sequence similarity between the two proteins. We addressed this problem by generating antibodies to bacterial fusion proteins containing the proline-rich domain of fib-1 and glycine-rich domain of fib-2 (see “Experimental Procedures” and Fig. 1). The Western blot in Fig.2 A shows that these polyclonal antibodies were specific for their respective antigens; the antibody to the glycine-rich domain (αGly) reacted with Aik and NLR3e/6 but not PET, and similarly, the anti-Pro (αPro) antibody recognized PET but not the fib-2 constructs. Also, neither antibody reacted with proteins in the medium of untransfected CHOK1 cells. Constructs containing amino-terminal regions of fib-1 and fib-2, depicted schematically in Fig. 1, were expressed in CHOK1 cells. The fib-2 construct, Aik, begins five residues into the glycine-rich region (11Zhang H. Apfelroth S. Hu W. Davis E. Sanguineti C. Bonadio J. Mecham R. Ramirez F. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 855-863Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar) and extends into the second 8-cysteine domain, ending three residues short of the 8th cysteine. PET includes the first residue of the proline-rich domain of fib-1 (12Pereira L. D'Alessio M. Ramirez F. Lynch J. Sykes B. Pangilinan T. Bonadio J. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1993; 2: 961-968Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar) and ends with the last residue predicted for the second 8-Cys domain. Both Aik and PET contain the putative leader sequence of fib-2 found within amino acids Met-1 to Gln-46 (see Fig. 1). NLR3e/6 contains contiguous sequences from the initiator methionine of fib-2 to the end of the first EGF-like loop of the middle stretch of 12 EGF-like domains in the full-length molecule. LEEC contains the leader sequence of fib-1 spliced onto the large central region of EGF-like domains (exons 23–44) and the carboxyl-terminal domain (exons 64–65) of fib-1. The Western blots shown in Fig. 2 A demonstrate that these proteins were stably expressed in CHOK1 cells. Treatment of the cells with tunicamycin (Fig.3 A) confirmed that all constructs were N-linked glycosylated as predicted by their primary sequences. PET was O-linked glycosylated as assessed by its ability to be recognized by Jacalin, a lectin that specifically recognizes O-linked sugars (Fig. 3 B). Aik and NLR3e/6, however, did not bind to Jacalin and, thus, did not containO-linked sugars. Fig.4 A shows that unpurified NLR3e/6 bound in a dose-dependent manner to tropoelastin that had been coated onto microtiter wells. There was minimal interaction of NLR3e/6 with wells blocked with non-fat milk. Aik, a smaller construct containing the front portion of NLR3e/6, also bound to tropoelastin (Fig. 4 B) thus localizing at least one active region within NLR3e/6 responsible for its binding activity. No interaction was seen between Aik and bovine serum albumin or wells coated with non-fat milk indicating specificity toward tropoelastin. HPLC-purified Aik exhibited similar binding characteristics as compared with unpurified Aik/CHO conditioned medium (Fig. 4 C), indicating that a direct interaction between Aik and tropoelastin was occurring. No binding was observed between tropoelastin and purified Aik expressed in bacteria (Fig. 4 D), suggesting that the folded, secondary structure of Aik is critical for its binding activity. The possible binding of tropoelastin to fibrillin-1 was investigated using the PET construct, which contains regions of fib-1 that are analogous to Aik. Fig. 4 E indicates that purified PET, like Aik, bound to tropoelastin in a dose-dependent manner. To determine whether tropoelastin binding was specific for the amino-terminal region of fibrillin and not a general property of any fragment of the molecule, LEEC, a construct containing the central region and carboxyl-terminal domain of fib-1, was used as a competitor of Aik in the tropoelastin binding assays. Because our antibodies could not recognize native LEEC, it was not possible to access direct binding of LEEC to tropoelastin using the microwell assay. As shown in Fig.4 B, concentrations of LEEC greater than 5 μg/ml did not inhibit binding of Aik to tropoelastin-coated wells, suggesting that LEEC itself does not bind tropoelastin. It should be noted that because of the propensity of tropoelastin to bind to plastic surfaces even when blocked with high levels of protein, it is not possible to do solid phase binding assays with tropoelastin in the solution phase (21Prosser I.W. Whitehouse L.A. Parks W.C. Stahle-Bäckdahl M. Hinek A. Park P.W. Mecham R.P. Connect. Tissue Res. 1991; 25: 265-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) nor is it possible to determine accurately binding affinities. The highly charged nature of tropoelastin (pI ∼13) suggests that ionic interactions may play a role in binding to fibrillin. This was investigated by conducting the binding assays in buffers of increasing ionic strength. For these assays, we used conditioned medium from the Aik/CHO cells as a source of protein. Fig.5 A shows that binding was sensitive to increasing amounts of sodium chloride, exhibiting an ∼75% inhibition of binding at 400 mm. This inhibition by sodium chloride implicates a charge-charge interaction. To assess whether the lysine side chains of tropoelastin were involved in binding, purified tropoelastin was acetylated with acetic anhydride, a chemical modification that renders amino groups uncharged. Fig.5 B shows that Aik bound ∼60% less well to acetylated tropoelastin as compared with mock-treated tropoelastin. This modification did not alter the ability of tropoelastin to bind to the microtiter wells when detected with tropoelastin antibody (data not shown). Estimations of the efficiency of acetylation using this procedure indicated that only ∼30% of the lysine residues of tropoelastin were modified. Binding of the fib-1 construct, PET, to tropoelastin was also sensitive to ionic conditions (Fig. 5 A), exhibiting a ∼65% inhibition at 400 mm sodium chloride. By analogy to the data obtained with Aik, we believe that PET also interacted with the unmodified lysine residues in tropoelastin. Characterization of post-translational modifications of our fib-2 constructs demonstrated that NLR3e/6 (data not shown) and Aik incorporated [35S]sulfate (Fig.6 A). Because the fib-2 constructs were not O-glycosylated (Fig. 3 B), their sulfate groups were most likely on tyrosine residues or, possibly, N-linked sugars (22Kornfeld R. Kornfeld S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1985; 54: 631-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (3776) Google Scholar, 23Huttner W.B. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1987; 12: 361-363Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 24Rosenquist G.L. Nicholas Jr., H.B. Protein Sci. 1993; 2: 215-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Autoradiography of medium from PET/CHO cells incubated with [35S]sulfate showed weak labeling of PET, with much longer exposure times required to detect only minimal signal. We are uncertain whether this low level of labeling reflects fewer sulfated amino acids in PET as compared with Aik or if trace amounts of sulfate are incorporated into the sulfur-containing amino acids methionine and cysteine through cellular recycling of the [35S]sulfate. Interestingly, Kieltyet al. (25Kielty C.M. Whittaker S., P. Shuttleworth C.A. FEBS Lett. 1996; 386: 169-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) demonstrated that full-length fib-1 will efficiently incorporate [35S]sulfate. Our results suggest that the site of sulfation in fib-1 must be outside the region encoded by PET. Because sulfation imparts a negative charge, we sought to determine if this post-translational modification was important for the interaction of Aik with the positively charged lysine residues in tropoelastin. Sulfation of proteins can be inhibited with potassium chlorate, which inhibits the synthesis of the cellular sulfate donor group, 3′-phosphoadenosine 5′-phosphosulfate (26Baeuerle P.A. Huttner W., B. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1986; 141: 870-877Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). Treatment of Aik/CHO cells with chlorate fully prevented the sulfation of Aik (Fig. 6 B) without affecting the level of protein expression as demonstrated by the Western blot in Fig. 6, C and D, which shows that non-sulfated Aik bound ∼30% less well to tropoelastin implicating this modification as contributing to binding. Chlorate itself had no adverse effect on the binding assays, since adding the chemical to untreated conditioned medium did not appreciably alter the binding of sulfated Aik to tropoelastin (Fig. 6 D). The majority of lysine residues in tropoelastin are modified to form covalent cross-links in insoluble elastin (1Mecham R. Davis E. Yurchenco P. Birk"
https://openalex.org/W2140597133,"The DNA binding of three different NF-κB dimers, the p50 and p65 homodimers and the p50/p65 heterodimer, has been examined using a combination of gel mobility shift and fluorescence anisotropy assays. The NF-κB p50/p65 heterodimer is shown here to bind the κB DNA target site of the immunoglobulin κ enhancer (Ig-κB) with an affinity of approximately 10 nm. The p50 and p65 homodimers bind to the same site with roughly 5- and 15-fold lower affinity, respectively. The nature of the binding isotherms indicates a cooperative mode of binding for all three dimers to the DNA targets. We have further characterized the role of pH, salt, and temperature on the formation of the p50/p65 heterodimer-Ig-κB complex. The heterodimer binds to the Ig-κB DNA target in a pH-dependent manner, with the highest affinity between pH 7.0 and 7.5. A strong salt-dependent interaction between Ig-κB and the p50/p65 heterodimer is observed, with optimum binding occurring at monovalent salt concentrations below 75 mm, with binding becoming virtually nonspecific at a salt concentration of 200 mm. Binding of the heterodimer to DNA was unchanged across a temperature range between 4 °C and 42 °C. The sensitivity to ionic environment and insensitivity to temperature indicate that NF-κB p50/p65 heterodimers form complexes with specific DNA in an entropically driven manner.

Members of the Rel/NF-κB family are essential for diverse biological functions such as the regulation of innate and adaptive immunity, development, and apoptosis in a wide array of eukaryotes from Drosophila to man (1Baeuerle P.A. Baltimore D. Science. 1988; 242: 540-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (1674) Google Scholar, 2Baeuerle P.A. Henkel T. Annu. Rev.

Franzoso G. Brown K. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1994; 10: 405-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (2003) Google Scholar). Like most transcription factors, dimers of NF-κB proteins modulate transcription by directly binding to enhancer sequences located in the regulatory regions of numerous genes. These DNA sequences are collectively known as κB DNA sequences. In mammals, the Rel/NF-κB dimers arise from five polypeptides, p50, p52, p65, c-Rel, and RelB. The most abundant of these dimers are the p50/p65 heterodimer and the p50 homodimer. The existences of some, but not all, of the other possible dimers have been shown to exist in cells. The NF-κB family can be divided into two subgroups based on the presence or absence of an activation domain. p50 and p52 do not contain a distinct activation domain and belong to class I. The other three members constitute the class II subfamily. It is generally believed that the homodimers of p50 and p52 and the p50/p52 heterodimer function as transcriptional repressors. The remaining combinations of dimeric NF-κB proteins, containing at least one monomer of p65, c-Rel, or RelB, act as activators. Rel/NF-κB proteins share a region that shows over 45% sequence similarity across the entire family. This region, known as the Rel homology region (RHR),1 is responsible for DNA binding and subunit dimerization. High resolution x-ray crystal structures of RHRs are known for four homodimers, p50, p52, p65, and c-Rel in their DNA-bound conformations (5Müller C.W. Rey F.A. Sodeoka M. Verdine G.L. Harrison S.C. Nature. 1995; 373: 311-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar, 6Ghosh G. van Duyne G. Ghosh S. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1995; 373: 303-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar, 7Cramer P.

Biol. 1998; 5: 67-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). These structures show that, as expected, Rel/NF-κB proteins also share similar structures. Most of the RHR is folded into two immunoglobulin-like domains connected by a 10-amino acid linker; the N-terminal domain confers sequence specificity in DNA binding, and the C-terminal domain is involved in dimerization as well as DNA backbone recognition. These structures show that, unlike most other transcription factors, NF-κB dimers do not use any secondary structure for contacting DNA. All the DNA-contacting residues emanate from loops connecting secondary structures. Crystal structures of these complexes suggest that in their free form the N-terminal domains should be flexible with respect to the dimerization domain. Recently, the NMR structures of a 16-base pair duplex DNA containing the κB target from the HIV-LTR, which is identical to the κB site in the immunoglobulin light chain κ gene (Ig-κB), and a mutant form of the target site that abolishes DNA binding have been solved (9Tisne C. Hantz E. Hartmann B. Delepierre M. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 279: 127-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 10Tisne C. Hartmann B. Delepierre M. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 3883-3894Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). These show that the phosophodiester bonds of the sugar-phosphate backbone of the native duplex preferentially adopt a distinct conformation in the 5′ and 3′ regions of the κB site. The mutant site is incapable of adopting the native DNA's conformation, suggesting that κB-DNA sequence also plays a role in NF-κB-DNA complex formation. The combined flexibility of the NF-κB dimers and their target DNA allows NF-κB to adopt multiple conformations in a promoter specific manner. Among NF-κB's most well characterized DNA targets are the κB DNA sites of the immunoglobulin light chain κ gene and HIV-LTR (Ig-κB) and the interferon β gene (IFN-κB). A crystal structure of the NF-κB p50/p65 heterodimer bound to the Ig-κB DNA target has been completed (11Chen F.E. Huang D.B. Chen Y.Q. Ghosh G. Nature. 1998; 391: 410-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). In order to understand the mechanism of DNA binding by NF-κB, thermodynamic parameters need to be determined for various NF-κB dimers and κB DNA target sites. In this study we have analyzed binding of Ig-κB and IFN-κB DNA targets with three different NF-κB dimers: p50 homodimer, p65 homodimer, and p50/p65 heterodimer, using both a gel mobility assay and a solution-based fluorescence anisotropy assay. The binding of NF-κB p50/p65 heterodimer to Ig-κB DNA has been further tested for its dependence on pH, salt, and temperature. 5′-Fluorescein-labeled oligonucleotides were purchased from the Keck Oligonucleotide Synthesis Facility at Yale University (New Haven, CT).

The Nucleotide Removal Kit was purchased from Qiagen. All proteins were purified according to Refs. 5Müller C.W. Rey F.A. Sodeoka M. Verdine G.L. Harrison S.C.

Protein Eng. 1999; 12: 423-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar. Monomeric p50 and p65 mutants were generated through a two-step polymerase chain reaction strategy using internal primers. The N- and C-terminal primers for both mutants were the same as those used for the wild type proteins (12Chen F. Kempiak S. Huang D. Phelps C. Ghosh G. Protein Eng. 1999; 12: 423-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). For the p50 Y267D/L269D mutant, the internal primers used were: N-terminal, 5′-GGGGAGGAGATTGATCTAGATTGTGACAAGGTTC-3′; C-terminal, 5′-GAACCTTGTCACAATCTAGATCAATCTCCTCCCC-3′. For the p65 F213D/L215D mutant, the internal primers used were: N-terminal, 5′-GGGGATGAGATCGATCTAGATTGCGACAAGGTG-3′; C-terminal, 5′-CACCTTGTCGCAATCTAGATCGATCTCATCCCC-3′. The oligonucleotide used for the EMSAs was 5′-TCTGA GGGACTTTCCTGATC-3′, which contains the heterodimer target site Ig-κB (underlined). This oligonucleotide was annealed to its complimentary strand and end radiolabeled with32P using T4-polynucleotide kinase and [γ-32P]ATP. The labeled DNA was then purified using a Nucleotide Removal Kit. Binding reactions were performed using constant DNA concentration (100 pm for the p50/p65 heterodimer or 1 nm for the p50 and p65 homodimers) in 20 μl of binding buffer (20 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 μg of poly(dI-dC) DNA, 0.25 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 5% glycerol (v/v)) at 20 °C for 30 min. The reaction mixes were then loaded onto a 6% 0.25× Tris borate-EDTA-polyacrylamide gel and run for 2 h at 120 V. The gels were then dried and exposed to a phosphorimage storage plate for a Molecular Dynamics Storm 860 scanner, which was used to visualize the gels. Gels were quantified using ImageQuant version 1.2 from Molecular Dynamics. Two 5′-fluorescein labeled oligonucleotides were used for these assays. A 39-mer containing the Ig-κB target site from the HIV-LTR (underlined) (5′-GATCGCTG GGGACTTTCCAGGGAGGCGTGGCCTGAGTCC-3′) and a 17-mer containing the IFN-κB site (underlined) (5′-AGT GGGAAATTCCTCGG-3′). Both were annealed to their complimentary strands prior to use. p50, p65, or the p50/p65 heterodimer were then serially diluted into 0.6-ml binding reactions. After the dilutions, each tube was blanked and the labeled oligonucleotides were added at constant concentration (100 pm, 1 nm, or 10 nm for p50/p65, p50, and p65, respectively), and the reactions were incubated at 20 °C for 45 min to 1 h. For the monomeric p50 (Y267D/L269D), reactions were set up using a hairpin oligonucleotide with the sequence 5′-AAAGTCCCCACCCCCTG GGGACTTT-3′ containing the p50 Ig-κB half-site from the HIV-LTR (underlined) added to the titrated protein at 1 nm. The anisotropy value of each reaction tube was then measured using a Beacon 2000 fluorescence polarization analyzer (Panvera, WI). Buffers used in the assays were as follows: Temperature Dependence, 20 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 50 mm NaCl; Salt Dependence, 20 mm Tris (pH 8.0), and 0, 25, 50, 75, 100, 150, and 200 mm NaCl or KCl; pH Dependence, 20 mm buffer (pH 6.0, 6.2, and 6.5 MES, pH 6.8 and 7.0 MOPS, pH 7.5, 8.0, and 8.5 Tris, and pH 9.0 CAPSO). All salt and pH experiments were carried out at 37 °C; temperature dependence assays were carried out at 4, 8, 16, 22, 30, 37, and 42 °C. First, the fraction of DNA bound in each reaction was determined. For EMSA the fraction bound was determined by integrating the area under the peaks for each band and dividing the area of the bound DNA band by the total area of the bound and free DNA bands. For the FAAs fraction bound was calculated by subtracting the experimentally determined polarization value for free DNA from the observed polarization value for each data point, then dividing each by the polarization value for NF-κB saturated DNA. The apparent dissociation constant (K app) was determined graphically as the point where fraction bound equals 0.5. Data from all homodimer experiments were globally fit to a cooperative binding model using the following equation.Fraction DNA bound(FB)=([NF­κB]/Kmonomer)+([NF­κB]2/aKmonomer2)1+(2[NF­κB]/Kmonomer)+([NF­κB]2/aKmonomer2)Equation 1 K monomer is the equilibrium dissociation constant of one monomer interacting with its DNA half-site, anda is a cooperativity factor for the binding of the second monomer. The statistical factor of 2 in the denominator arises due to the two equivalent monomer-binding sites available prior to the binding of the first monomer. Equation 1 was modified to determine the cooperativity of p50/p65 binding as follows.FB=([NF­κB]/Kmonomer(p65)+[NF­κB]/Kmonomer(p50))+([NF­κB]2/aKmonomer(p65)Kmonomer(p50))1+(2[NF­κB]/Kmonomer(p65)+2[NF­κB]/Kmonomer(p50))+([NF­κB]2/aKmonomer(p65)Kmonomer(p50))Equation 2 K monomer(p65) is the affinity of the p65 monomer for its DNA half-site, K monomer(p50) is the affinity of the p50 monomer for its DNA half-site, and ais a cooperativity factor for the binding of the second monomer. K app values from salt dependence FAAs were then fit to the following models to determine the number of cations and H2O molecules displaced upon NF-κB binding.log(Ka,app)=log(K0)Z*ψ*log[NaCl]Equation 3 K 0 is the extrapolated apparentK a at 1 m NaCl concentration,Z is the number of cations displaced, and ψ is the number of cations thermodynamically bound to each DNA backbone phosphate previously determined to be 0.88 (13Lohman T.M. deHaseth P.L.

The RHR of p50 and p65 homodimers and the p50/p65 heterodimer have been overexpressed and purified from overexpressing E. coli clones. We have measured the DNA binding of the p50 homodimer using a gel mobility shift assay. The DNA probe used for this assay was a 20-mer duplex DNA containing a centrally located 10-base pair Ig-κB site. Fig.1 shows the free and bound DNA for the p50 homodimer, as well as the p65 homodimer and p50/p65 heterodimer. The data fit best to a cooperative binding model (Equations 1 and 2) describing two subunits assembling sequentially on the DNA. Fig.2 shows the data for NF-κB p50 homodimer binding to Ig-κB DNA fit to the cooperative model.Figure 2NF-κB dimers bind DNA cooperatively.

The binding conditions were similar to those for gel mobility shift assays. This solution-based assay circumvents the problems of artifactual dissociation of a protein-DNA complex as it migrates through a gel matrix. Fig. 3 shows titrations of Ig-κB DNA with the three different NF-κB dimers. The total fluorescence intensity did not change during the assay, indicating that anisotropy signals were not due to changes in fluorescence lifetime or other experimental artifacts. To determine the time required for each reaction to reach equilibrium anisotropy, a kinetic experiment was performed in which each sample was measured at different times until no change in anisotropy was observed. Accordingly, sufficient time was allowed before recording the final anisotropy value. Control experiments showed that the presence or absence of carrier DNA poly(dI-dC) (2 μg/ml) and glycerol (5%) had no effect in binding. Additionally, we have verified the activities of each protein sample used for the assays by measuring anisotropy at various stoichiometric protein-DNA ratios (over a range from 20/1 to 1/20). We observe that approximately 85% of the NF-κB in each preparation is fully active (data not shown). Anisotropy profiles for each binding experiment show an initial plateau indicating unbound DNA, followed by a rise in anisotropy as proteins bind to DNA, and a final plateau showing saturated binding. As mentioned previously for EMSA experiments, the binding data for anisotropy experiments fit the cooperative model. The apparent dissociation constants obtained from these anisotropy experiments are very similar to those found in EMSA experiments. Next, we measured the affinity of the p50 homodimer for the IFN-κB site. These results are presented in Table I. Our results show that the NF-κB p50 homodimer has similar affinities for both Ig-κB and IFN-κB DNA targets.Table INF-κB binding to Ig-κB and IFN-κB DNAIg-κB (FAA-pH 7.5)K appK monomeranmnmp5054.3 ± 1.1210 ± 22.65.0 × 10−2 ± 3.7 × 10−3p65150.7 ± 29.2379 ± 50.61.6 × 10−1 ± 4.2 × 10−2p50/p6512.8 ± 2.21.7 × 10−3 ± 1.6 × 10−4K appIg-κB (EMSA-pH 8.0)Ig-κB (FAA-pH 8.0)IFN-κB (FAA)nmnmnmp5085.3 ± 0.684.1 ± 16.249.2 ± 11.4 (pH 7.5)p65464.1 ± 53.0341.1 ± 43.9414.9 ± 24.2 (pH 8.0)p50/p6516.8 ± 5.619.6 ± 3.827.3 ± 4.6 (pH 8.0)Apparent equilibrium dissociation constants (K app) from FAA experiments for NF-κB binding to Ig-κB and IFN-κB DNA and from electrophoretic mobility shift experiments on Ig-κB.

To further investigate the cooperative nature of binding, it is important to determine the affinity of a monomer for its κB half-site target. The cooperative model predicts that the monomers bind sequentially to their DNA half-sites, with the second monomer binding to its half-site with much higher affinity due to its interaction with the pre-bound first subunit. In order to test this hypothesis, we created a monomeric mutant p50 using information from crystallographic models and biochemical studies of the p50 homodimer (16Sengchanthalangsy L.L. Datta S. Huang D.-B. Anderson E. Braswell E.H. Ghosh G. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 289: 1029-1040Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 17Huang D.-B. Huxford T. Chen Y.-Q. Ghosh G. Structure. 1997; 5: 1427-1436Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The tyrosine at position 267 and leucine at position 269 are critical for subunit dimerization of p50. These residues are located away from the protein-DNA interface and are not involved in DNA contacts. We have created and purified the Tyr267 → Asp/Leu269→ Asp double mutant to homogeneity. Size exclusion chromatography clearly shows that the mutant p50 is monomeric even at a high protein concentration (5 mg/ml, Fig.4 A). Binding experiments have been performed with a DNA probe that bears only a single half-site (Fig. 4 B). This eliminates any possible binding of two molecules of mutant p50 monomer in a non-cooperative manner. The p50 monomer binds to this target with an affinity of 210 nm(K monomer). Using this value in Equation 1yields a cooperativity factor of 0.050, suggesting that the second subunit binds to the DNA with 20 times higher affinity compared with the first monomer, 10.5 nm. The apparent equilibrium constant (K app) for 2 monomers binding to DNA is 2.2 × 10−15m2. However, in the pH, salt, and temperature studies, we focus on the overall K app, the concentration where half of the DNA is bound, which represents the affinity of the entire NF-κB dimer-DNA complex. We have performed analogous binding experiments with p65 homodimer for both Ig-κB and IFN-κB DNA targets (Table I). Binding with Ig-κB DNA has been tested through both EMSA and polarization experiments at pH 8.0. EMSA experiments show that p65 homodimer binds the DNA with an affinity of 464 nm and fluorescence anisotropy gives a value of 341 nm. At pH 7.5 the p65 homodimer binds Ig-κB more tightly, with an affinity of approximately 150 nm. We also observe that the binding affinity of p65 homodimer IFN-κB DNA is similar to its affinity for Ig-κB DNA (414 nm versus 341 nm at pH 8.0). The nature of binding isotherms also suggests a cooperative mode of binding. We therefore set out to determine the cooperativity of interactions between p65 and κB targets. We have created monomeric p65 by mutating Phe231 and Leu233 located at the subunit interface to aspartic acid. These two residues are located at the equivalent positions to that of Tyr267 and Leu269, respectively, in p50. We overexpressed, purified, and tested the oligomeric nature by size exclusion chromatography. As expected, this double mutant was monomeric. However, the mutant tends to aggregate, preventing us from using it in binding experiments. We have overexpressed the monomeric DNA binding N-terminal domain of p65. X-ray crystal structures show that this fragment provides most of the sequence-specific binding of target DNA while lacking the phosphate backbone contacts contributed by the dimerization domain. This fragment binds a κB half-site with an affinity of approximately 1,800 nm at pH 7.5. Considering this as the absolutely upper limit, and the affinity of p50 RHR monomer, 210 nm, being the lower limit, we fit the K monomer anda values in Equation 1, with K monomerconstrained to be less than 1,800 nm, to the p65 RHR data at pH 7.5. This yielded a K monomer of 379 nm and a cooperativity value (a) of 0.16, suggesting that the second molecule of p65 monomer binds the second half-site of DNA with 6–7-fold higher affinity. In addition to the homodimers, we have also extensively studied the NF-κB p50/p65 heterodimer. We have determined the apparent binding affinities of the heterodimer for the Ig-κB DNA target using both gel mobility shift and fluorescence anisotropy assays. Similar to the results observed for the homodimers, we do not see any difference in binding affinities between these two methods. TheK app values of the p50/p65 heterodimer for Ig-κB are approximately 20 nm at pH 8.0 in both assays. We observe that the heterodimer binds to IFN-κB with a relatively lower affinity compared with its Ig-κB targets. The apparent dissociation constants of Ig-κB and IFN-κB for the heterodimer are 19 and 27 nm, respectively, at pH 8.0. Our results show that the p50/p65 heterodimer has the highest affinity for Ig-κB DNA, p50 homodimer binds with intermediate affinity, whereas p65 shows the lowest binding affinity. The nature of binding isotherm clearly indicates that the heterodimer binds κB targets with highest cooperativity of the three dimers tested here. Using the equilibrium binding constants of the p50 and p65 monomers to their DNA half-sites, we observe that the cooperativity of the heterodimer is 0.0017 (the second subunit binds 500 times tighter than the first) using Equation 2. To test the pH sensitivity of the interactions between the heterodimer and Ig-κB DNA, we performed binding experiments at pH 7.5 and 8.0 using fluorescence anisotropy assay. These experiments showed approximately 2-fold higher affinity at pH 7.5 than at pH 8.0. To observe if both the homodimers also exhibit a similar binding trend, the homodimers were subjected to similar experiments. The homodimers did not show a large difference in affinities as was observed for the heterodimer. Nevertheless, both these dimers did show slightly higher affinities at pH 7.5 compared with pH 8.0. To further investigate the pH dependence of equilibrium binding constants of the heterodimer-DNA complex, we tested a wider pH range. The apparent binding constants were determined for the heterodimer/Ig-κB DNA complex at seven different pH values ranging from 6.0 to 9.0. At pH 6.0, no change in anisotropy was observed due to background noise, but a change of intensity was recorded with increases in protein concentration. Therefore, the binding constant was determined from the plot of increase of fluorescence intensityversus protein concentration. As shown in Fig.5, apparent binding constants vary only roughly 2-fold between pH 6.8 and 8.0, with the highest affinity is observed at pH 7.0. Below pH 6.8 binding constants increase significantly as pH decreases. Similarly, K appincreases as pH increases with a 5–6-fold increases of the binding constant at pH 9.0, the highest pH used in the assay. The dependence of the apparent K for the p50/p65 heterodimer-Ig-κB DNA complex on salt concentration was determined at pH 8.0 and 37 °C using the anisotropy method. As shown in Table II, the K app of this complex is highly dependent on the salt concentration. K app remained unchanged between salt concentrations from 0 to 50 mm. Whereas K app is approximately 20 nm at 50 mm NaCl, it is reduced by a factor of 3–4 at 100 mm NaCl concentration. A reduction inK app value of 2 orders of magnitude is observed at 200 mm salt concentration. FAA experiments replacing NaCl with KCl produced no observable changes in the apparent equilibrium constants. The salt effect on the heterodimer/Ig-κB DNA complex is shown in a log-log plot of salt concentrationversus K app in Fig.6. The plot fits Equations 3 and 4relating equilibrium binding constants to ion-water models at NaCl concentrations where binding is salt-dependent. LogK app exhibits a linear dependence on log salt concentrations from 75 to 200 mm. From the fit to these data points, it appears that between 5 and 6 ions and approximately 430 water molecules are released upon the protein-DNA complex formation. The release of large numbers of water molecules is a hallmark of specific, protein-DNA complex formation (18Lundback T. Hard T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 4754-4759Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Similar strong salt dependence of apparent equilibrium binding constants (K app) on salt was also observed for the p50 homodimer/IFN-κB DNA complex. Like the heterodimer/Ig-κB DNA complex, the binding constants do not change at salt concentrations between 0 and 50 mm. Above 75 mm NaCl concentration, p50/IFN-κB DNA complex is even more salt-dependent than the heterodimer. The binding constant is decreased over 200-fold at 200 mm salt compared with 50 mm salt concentration.Table IINaCl dependence of p50/p65 heterodimer binding to Ig-κB DNA[NaCl]K appmmnm015.1 ± 8.82517.6 ± 7.75019.6 ± 1.47538.3 ± 9.910068.9 ± 9.7150307.4 ± 4.12001445.0 ± 33.6Fluorescence anisotropy assays at pH 8.0, 37 °C were used to determine the apparent equilibrium constants at NaCl concentrations between 0 and 200 mm.

Cellular hypoxia is also found in these conditions. We have previously shown that cox-2 is transcriptionally regulated by hypoxia in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) in culture via the transactivation factor NF-κB p65, leading to increased production of prostaglandin E2, an inhibitor of vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation. Sp1 is a transactivation factor known to be important in the regulation of cytokine expression in association with NF-κB. We hypothesized that Sp1 is involved in the induction of cox-2in hypoxic HUVEC. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays with hypoxic HUVEC nuclear protein showed that both Sp1 and the related protein Sp3 specifically bound to the cox-2 promoter. Immunoblotting demonstrated that hypoxia increased the nuclear localization of Sp1 but did not change the Sp3 content in HUVEC. Overexpression of Sp1 through transfection of HUVEC enhancedcox-2 promoter activity as measured by reporter gene expression and by the production of COX-2. The specificity of the results was confirmed by mutation of the Sp1-binding site in thecox-2 promoter construct and by reproducibility in an Sp-deficient Drosophila SL2 cell line. The regulatory role of Sp1 discovered in this work supports the concept that a mechanistic link exists between vascular cellular hypoxia and mediators of inflammation associated with aortic aneurysm and heart failure.

The cyclooxygenases, also referred to as prostaglandin endoperoxide synthases or PGH synthases, catalyze the rate-limiting step in prostaglandin synthesis. A constitutive cyclooxygenase (COX-1) and an inducible cyclooxygenase (COX-2) have been identified. Both COX-1 and COX-2 perform the same enzymatic function, converting arachidonic acid to PGG2 and then PGH2. PGH2 is the progenitor of the thromboxanes, prostacyclin, and PGE2, among other prostaglandins (1Samuelsson B. Goldyne M. Granström E. Hamberg M. Hammarström S. Malmsten C. Annu. Rev.

Nishimura T. Cardiovasc. Res. 1997; 35: 217-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Both COX-2 expression and NF-κB activation appear in heart failure (4Wong S.C. Fukuchi M. Melnyk P. Rodger I. Giaid A. Circulation. 1998; 98: 100-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). The wall of an aneurysmal human aorta is also hypoxic (5Björnheden T. Levin M. Evaldsson M. Wiklund O. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1999; 19: 870-876Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar) and has increased cellular COX-2 content and PGE2production (6Holmes D.R. Wester W. Thompson R.W. Reilly J.M. J. Vasc. Surg. 1997; 25: 810-815Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). These findings are not surprising in light of our earlier work, within which we demonstrated that cox-2 is transcriptionally regulated by hypoxia via the transactivation factor NF-κB p65 in human vascular endothelial cells (7Schmedtje Jr., J.F. Ji Y.-S. Liu W.-L. DuBois R.N. Runge M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 601-608Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (636) Google Scholar), leading to increased production of PGE2 (8Ji Y.-S. Xu Q. Schmedtje Jr., J.F. Circ. Res. 1998; 83: 295-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Nuclear factor-κB p65 (RelA) is one of the NF-κB family of transcriptional activator proteins. The p65 subunit is known to be responsible for initiating transcription by DNA binding (9Schmitz M.L. Baeuerle P.A. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 3805-3817Crossref PubMed Scopus (666) Google Scholar), but it is also likely that a number of other proteins bind with dimerized p65-p50 to initiate NF-κB-mediated transcription so as to allow a gene-specific response to this ubiquitous transcription factor (10Thanos D. Maniatis T. Cell. 1995; 80: 529-532Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1217) Google Scholar). The intracellular signaling mechanism that leads to induction ofcox-2 by hypoxia in human vascular endothelium includes binding of p65 to the NF-κB consensus element closest to the transcription start site. However, we learned in earlier deletion experiments that there is a relationship between the length of the region upstream of this NF-κB element and the degree of induced transcription. It appeared to us that binding of the NF-κB p65 is a necessary but not sufficient step in hypoxic induction of COX-2 (7Schmedtje Jr., J.F. Ji Y.-S. Liu W.-L. DuBois R.N. Runge M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 601-608Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (636) Google Scholar). After finding that cytoplasmic NF-κB p65 and IκBα (an inhibitory protein that binds NF-κB p65 precursors) levels are not changed by hypoxia, we hypothesized that other factors might play a role in regulating the cox-2 promoter. The HMG I(Y) family of proteins features multiple A·T hooks and is associated with NF-κB-mediated transactivation. We recently discovered that hypoxia increases expression of HMG I(Y) proteins while facilitating transactivation of the cox-2 promoter (8Ji Y.-S. Xu Q. Schmedtje Jr., J.F. Circ. Res. 1998; 83: 295-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Sp1 is typically a positive-acting transcription factor that is ubiquitously expressed and required for the expression of a variety of genes (11Kadonaga J.T. Carner K.R. Masiarz F.R. Tjian R. Cell. 1987; 51: 1079-1090Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1251) Google Scholar). It is known to be important in the regulation of cytokine and human immunodeficiency virus gene activation in association with NF-κB (12Hirano F. Tanaka H. Hirano Y. Hiramoto M. Handa H. Makino I. Scheidereit C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1266-1274Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Sp3 is a bi-functional regulator of transcription (repressor/activator, depending on the context) that competes with Sp1 for the same binding site. Sp1 mediates expression of the constitutive cyclooxygenase (COX-1) (13Xu X.-M. Tang J.L. Chen X.M. Wang L.H. Wu K.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6943-6950Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Transcription of the hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α) gene is initiated just downstream of two Sp1 sites (14Iyer N.V. Leung S.W. Semenza G.L. Genomics. 1998; 52: 159-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Extension of our previous search for hypoxia-related regulatory elements in the cox-2 promoter (15Appleby S.B. Ristimäki A. Neilson K. Norko K. Hla T. Biochem. J. 1994; 302: 723-727Crossref PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar) revealed an Sp1-binding site just upstream of the NF-κB-3′ element that we already know enhances cox-2 transcription in hypoxia. We therefore hypothesized that Sp1 is involved in the induction of cox-2 in hypoxic human vascular endothelial cells, and this hypothesis is supported by the results of experiments detailed herein. HUVEC were obtained as cryopreserved primary cultures that demonstrated factor VIII-related antigen and low density lipoprotein uptake (Clonetics). HUVEC were grown in Medium 199 with 2.2 g of NaHCO3/liter, 50 units/ml penicillin, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin (Life Technologies, Inc.) with 5% fetal bovine serum (HyClone Labs), 50 μg/ml endothelial cell growth supplement (Collaborative Biomedical Products), 50 μg/ml heparin, and 1.0 μg/ml hydrocortisone. The medium was prepared with a pH of 7.3. Incubator conditions were either normoxic (21% O2, 5% CO2) or hypoxic (1% O2, 5% CO2, balance N2) in a humidified incubator with an interior temperature of 37 °C. The medium was equilibrated to the environmental gas conditions overnight before cellular exposure. HUVEC cells were studied at the third to fifth passages. Hypoxic stimulation was produced with ambient oxygen concentrations of 1% (using a controlled incubator with CO2/O2 monitoring and CO2/N2 gas sources). Reoxygenation was prevented through immediate replacement of hypoxic medium with lysis buffers while the cells were on ice. The pO2 was generally 30–40 mm Hg in hypoxia and 160 mm Hg in normoxia. Hypoxic HUVECs were therefore maintained in an oxygen environment approximating that of desaturated or venous blood. Their appearance and growth were indistinguishable from those of normoxic cells by phase contrast microscopy. Drosophila Schneider SL2 cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection and grown at 25 °C without CO2 in Schneider's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 50 units/ml penicillin, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin. SL2 Cells were passaged every 4 days. The wild type of COX-2 promoter construct pGL2-NF-κB-3′-WT (containing bases −531 to +65 relative to the transcriptional start site) was described previously (7Schmedtje Jr., J.F. Ji Y.-S. Liu W.-L. DuBois R.N. Runge M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 601-608Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (636) Google Scholar) and is referred to as pWT here. The Sp1 mutant of COX-2 promoter construct pSPM was created by mutation of the Sp1-binding site in the pWT from 5′-GGGAGG-3′ to 5′-GAAAGG-3′ (−245 to −240) by PCR. To generate pSPM, two sets of PCR primers were used to amplify the COX-2 promoter DNA. Set 1 included forward primer NF-κB-P1 (−531 to −510) and reverse mutagenic primer CX9LMR (−221 to −250, 5′-CCCACTCTCCTGTCTGATCCCTTTCTCTCC-3′, mutated bases areitalicized and bold). Set 2 included forward mutagenic primer CX9LMF (−250 to −221, 5′-GGAGAGAAAGGGATCAGACAGGAGAGTGGG-3′, mutated bases areitalicized and bold) and reverse primer NF-κB-P2 (+65 to +46). Both NF-κB-P1 and NF-κB-P2 were previously described (7Schmedtje Jr., J.F. Ji Y.-S. Liu W.-L. DuBois R.N. Runge M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 601-608Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (636) Google Scholar). Two fragments generated from these two sets of primers by PCR were gel-purified and combined for 4 cycles of PCR. NF-κB-P1 and NF-κB-P2 were then added for another 28 PCR cycles. The resulting fragment was then subcloned into pGL2-Basic at KpnI andXhoI in the multiple cloning site. The correctness of the mutation was confirmed by sequencing. The PCR protocol for each cycle was 94 °C for 30 s, 65 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 80 s. The pPacSp1 and pPacβ-gal plasmids were kindly provided by Dr. Robert Tjian (16Courey A.J. Tjian R. Cell. 1988; 55: 887-898Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1079) Google Scholar). The pPacSp3, pCMVSp1, and pCMVSp3 plasmids were kindly provided by Dr. Guntram Suske (17Hagen G. Müller S. Beato M. Suske G. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3843-3851Crossref PubMed Scopus (655) Google Scholar). Cell lysate and nuclear protein extraction were performed as described previously (7Schmedtje Jr., J.F. Ji Y.-S. Liu W.-L. DuBois R.N. Runge M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 601-608Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (636) Google Scholar). Protein extracts were separated on SDS-polyacrylamide gel, blotted to the membrane, and reacted with polyclonal anti-Sp1 or anti-Sp3 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) in blocking buffer for 30 min at 37 °C and then incubated similarly with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-IgG for 30 min and washed in TBST buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 137 mm NaCl, and 0.1% Tween 20) for 5 min five times. The membrane was then incubated in luminol ECL detection reagents (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and exposed to the film. A monoclonal anti-COX-2 antibody (Transduction Laboratories) was used to detect COX-2 protein. Immunoblotting with anti-chicken α-tubulin antibody (Sigma) was performed for comparative purposes. Nuclear protein extraction from HUVEC and gel shift assay were performed as described previously (7Schmedtje Jr., J.F. Ji Y.-S. Liu W.-L. DuBois R.N. Runge M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 601-608Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (636) Google Scholar). The duration of HUVEC exposure to hypoxia was 2 h. The DNA probes (20,000 cpm) labeled by [γ-32P]ATP and 1.0 μg of bulk carrier poly(dI-dC) DNA were incubated with 3 μg of nuclear protein extract. An oligonucleotide CX9 corresponding to the Sp1-binding site in the COX-2 promoter (5′-GGAGAGGGAGGGATCAGACA-3′) and a consensus Sp1 (Promega) oligonucleotide c-Sp1 (5′-ATTCGATCGGGGCGGGGCGAGC-3′) were used as probes and competitors to perform the EMSA. A CX9 mutant CX9M (5′-GGAGAG AAAGGGATCAGACA-3′, mutated bases are italicized and bold) was used to confirm the specific Sp1 binding. Anti-Sp1, anti-Sp3, anti-NF-κB p65 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and anti-α-tubulin antibodies were used to perform supershift. Briefly, the antibodies were incubated with the nuclear protein for 30 min at room temperature. The probes were then added into the mixture and incubated for another 30 min at room temperature. Blocking with cold DNA or substitution of 5.0 μg of bovine serum albumin for nuclear protein was performed as a control. The protein-DNA product was run in a 5% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel and autoradiographed. We performed transfection of human vascular endothelial cells in 35-mm dishes at 60–80% confluency in 21% O2, 5% CO2, at 37 °C. For each dish, 12 μl of Lipofectin reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) and 88 μl of Opti-MEM I medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) were mixed and incubated at room temperature for 45 min. The mammalian expression plasmid pCMVSp1 or pCMVSp3 was used to perform co-transfection with 3 μg of pWT or pSPM. pSV2PAP, containing the alkaline phosphatase reporter gene downstream from an SV40 promoter, was included in each transfection to control the transfection efficiency. The Lipofectin and DNA solution were mixed with another 800 μl of Opti-MEM I medium, overlaid on the cells, and incubated at 37 °C for 8 h. The mixture was then replaced with the original medium. After recovering overnight, HUVEC cells were treated with hypoxia or continued normoxia for 24 h and lysed with 200 μl of Reporter lysis buffer (Promega). Luciferase activity was then determined in cell lysates using a Turner Designs luminometer. Alkaline phosphatase activity was determined as described previously (7Schmedtje Jr., J.F. Ji Y.-S. Liu W.-L. DuBois R.N. Runge M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 601-608Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (636) Google Scholar). The results of luciferase (measured in light units) and alkaline phosphatase (OD) activity was reported as a ratio, thereby correcting for minor discrepancies in transfection efficiency. TheDrosophila SL2 cells were transfected using calcium phosphate precipitation as described previously (18Di Nocera P.P. Dawid I.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 80: 7095-7098Crossref Scopus (268) Google Scholar). Cells were transfected at 50–60% confluence in 35-mm dishes. For each dish, 100 μl of 0.25 m CaCl2 containing the DNA was added dropwise to 100 μl of 2× HBS (274 mm NaCl, 9.4 mm KCl, 2.8 mm Na2HPO4, 11 mm dextrose, 42 mm Hepes, final pH 7.1) and incubated at room temperature for an hour. The Drosophilaexpression plasmid pPacSp1 or pPacSP3, both of which were under control of the Drosophila actin promoter, was used to co-transfect with pWT. The total amounts of DNA were kept constant with the PUC19 plasmid. The pPacβ-gal (200 ng) plasmid was included in each transfection to control the transfection efficiency. The transfection solution was added dropwise into culture dish medium and incubated for 42 h. Transfected cells were subsequently harvested by pipetting the medium across the dish several times, washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, pH 7.4), and lysed by adding 200 μl of lysis buffer. Cell lysates were used to perform luciferase assay and β-galactosidase assay using commercially available reagents (Promega). The Drosophila results were expressed as a ratio of luciferase activity to β-galactosidase activity. Several potential cis-acting elements have been found within the promoter region of cox-2. Our previous transfection analysis using a set of deletion constructs revealed that the NF-κB-3′ element (−223 to −214) is critical to the hypoxia-mediated cox-2 induction. Furthermore, when the promoter region is extended from −225 to −245 base pairs, reporter gene promotion was increased (7Schmedtje Jr., J.F. Ji Y.-S. Liu W.-L. DuBois R.N. Runge M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 601-608Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (636) Google Scholar), indicating that other elements in addition to NF-κB-3′ may be involved in regulation ofcox-2 transcription by hypoxia. Sequence analysis of thecox-2 promoter revealed an Sp1 consensus element (−245 to −240) just upstream from the NF-κB-3′ element that we previously demonstrated to enhance cox-2 transcription in hypoxia (Fig.1). To determine if Sp1/Sp3 interacts with this Sp1 consensus element in the cox-2 promoter, we performed electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA) with HUVEC nuclear protein using the oligonucleotide CX9 containing the Sp1 consensus element in thecox-2 promoter as a probe. Probes were described under “Experimental Procedures.” As shown in Fig.2, two major DNA-protein complexes were observed. Hypoxia enhanced the binding intensity. For comparison, a consensus Sp1 oligonucleotide c-Sp1 was also used as a probe to perform EMSA. The binding profile was identical to that observed with CX9. The DNA-protein complexes were competed away with 100-fold excess of unlabeled CX9 or c-Sp1. Antibodies specific for Sp1 and Sp3 supershifted the DNA-protein complexes. Sp1 antibody partially eliminated the upper complex. Sp3 antibody almost completely eliminated the lower complex and diminished the upper complex. As controls, the nonspecific NF-κB and α-tubulin antibodies were used to perform supershift. None of them had an effect on the DNA-protein complexes, indicating the binding is Sp1/Sp3-specific. The binding specificity was further confirmed by a mutation experiment. We mutated the Sp1 site of CX9 by only two bases and created CX9M. No DNA-protein complex was observed when CX9M was used as a probe, suggesting that the intact Sp1 site is required for interaction of Sp1/Sp3 with the cox-2promoter. To determine how Sp1 and Sp3 changed in response to hypoxia, Western blotting was performed with normoxic and hypoxic HUVEC protein extracts. As shown in Fig. 3, Sp1 antibody recognized a doublet band migrating at ∼100 kDa. Sp3 antibody recognized two doublet bands migrating at ∼110 and 80 kDa, respectively. Sp1 content was increased approximately 2-fold after 2 h hypoxia in HUVEC nuclear protein (but not cytoplasmic, data not shown), suggesting that hypoxia increases the nuclear localization of Sp1. Meanwhile, Sp3 content was not changed by hypoxia. Taken together, hypoxia resulted in an elevated Sp1/Sp3 ratio. To determine directly the role of Sp1 and Sp3 on regulation of cox-2 promoter activity, aDrosophila Schneider SL2 cell line that does not express endogenous Sp1 and Sp3 was used to perform co-transfection experiments. The wild type cox-2promoter luciferase reporter construct pWT was transfected into SL2 cells with the expression vectors pPacSp1 or pPacSp3. As shown in Fig. 4, overexpression of pPacSp1 (over the range 0–100 ng/well) caused a dose-dependent increase of cox-2 promoter activity as measured by luciferase reporter gene expression, with a maximal 16-fold increase. Overexpression of pPacSp3 also increased thecox-2promoter activity, with a maximal 3-fold increase. Similar dose-response co-transfection experiments were also performed in HUVECs except that mammalian expression vectors pCMVSp1 and pCMVSp3 were used instead of pPacSp1 and pPacSp3. As illustrated in Fig.5, the promoter activity of pWT was enhanced by increasing the amount of pCMVSp1 (over the range 0–1000 ng/well) with a maximal 5-fold increase but not by pCMVSp3. Increasing amount of pCMVSp3 (over the range 0–1000 ng/well) actually caused a decrease of the promoter activity. Sp1 also increased the promoter activity of pSPM (an Sp1 mutant of cox-2 promoter luciferase reporter construct in which the Sp1 site was mutated by two bases as in EMSA) but to a much less extent than that of pWT. These results indicate that Sp1 specifically activates cox-2 promoter activity in mammalian cells as well as in SL2 cells. Sp3 appears to be a bi-functional regulator of the cox-2 promoter, a repressor in HUVEC and an activator in SL2 cells. To determine if Sp1-site mutation affects hypoxia-mediatedcox-2 promoter induction, either the wild type construct pWT or Sp1 mutant construct pSPM was transfected into HUVECs and treated with 24-h hypoxia. Compared with normoxia control, hypoxia significantly increased the cox-2 promoter activity of pWT by 2.2-fold but not that of pSPM (Fig.6). This suggests that the Sp1-binding site in the cox-2 promoter region is critical to the regulation of cox-2 expression by hypoxia. To determine the effect of Sp1 and Sp3 on cox-2 promoter activity in hypoxic HUVEC, 300 ng of pCMVSp1 or pCMVSp3 along with 3 μg of pWT were co-transfected into HUVECs. After 24 h normoxia or hypoxia treatment, cells were harvested and assayed for promoter activity. A blank vector pCMV5 (19Andersson S. Davis D.L. Dahlbäck H. Jörnvall H. Russell D.W. J. Biol.

Compared with base line (co-transfection with blank vector under normoxia), overexpression ofsp1 synergistically increased the cox-2promoter activity with hypoxia. In contrast, overexpression of sp3not only caused a lower cox-2 promoter activity than that of base line but also decreased the transactivation of the cox-2promoter by hypoxia (Fig. 7). It appears that Sp3 represses cox-2 gene expression under both normoxia and hypoxia in HUVECs. To determine the effect of overexpression of sp1 on COX-2 protein expression in hypoxic HUVECs, 300 ng of expression plasmid pCMV-Sp1 was transfected into HUVECs. In the control experiment, 300 ng of blank vector pCMV5 was transfected into HUVECs as we found DNA transfection itself resulted in slightly less COX-2 production. After 24 h normoxia or hypoxia treatment, cell lysates were collected and employed for Western blot analysis using COX-2 antibody. As demonstrated in Fig.8, Sp1 progressively increased COX-2 immunoreactive protein in hypoxic HUVECs. We did not demonstrate a clear reduction of COX-2 protein by Sp3 (data not presented) as there was very little COX-2 protein production at base-line normoxia. We previously demonstrated that cox-2 is induced by hypoxia via the NF-κB p65 transcription factor in human vascular endothelium, leading to increased production of PGE2, and that the expression of the high mobility group protein HMG I(Y), known to be associated with NF-κB-mediated transactivation, is increased by hypoxia, facilitating transactivation of the cox-2 promoter. In this study, we demonstrated that Sp1 (and possibly Sp3) also participates in the regulation of cox-2 gene expression by hypoxia. Sp1 content was increased by hypoxia in HUVEC nuclear (but not cytoplasmic) protein, whereas Sp3 was not changed. Both Sp1 and Sp3 bound specifically to a Sp1 consensus sequence just upstream of the NF-κB-3′ element that we previously demonstrated to enhance the COX-2 transcription in hypoxia. Overexpression of sp1synergistically increased cox-2 promoter activity and protein expression with hypoxia. We conclude that hypoxia increases the nuclear localization of the Sp1 and thereby activates expression ofcox-2 in vascular endothelium. The Sp family includes Sp1, Sp2, Sp3, and Sp4. All four members contain highly conserved DNA-binding zinc finger domains close to the C terminus and glutamine-rich and serine/threonine-rich domains in the N-terminal region. In most promoters, Sp1 and Sp3 recognize the classical Sp1 consensus element with comparable affinity and specificity (20Suske G. Gene (Amst.). 1999; 238: 291-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (985) Google Scholar). In our study, both Sp1 and Sp3 bind to the same Sp1 consensus sequence (−250 to −231) in the COX-2 promoter. However, they contribute differently to cox-2 promoter activity. In HUVEC, Sp1 not only activated cox-2 promoter in a dose-dependent manner but also synergistically enhanced the promoter with hypoxia. In contrast, Sp3 acted as a repressor in HUVECs. Co-transfection of a higher dose of Sp3 resulted in decreasedcox-2 promoter activity. It has been reported elsewhere that down-regulation of sp3 in hypoxic C2C12 myocytes removes the associated transcriptional repression of muscle specific pyruvate kinase-M and β-enolase, thereby enabling expression of these glycolytic enzyme genes (21Discher D.J. Bishopric N.H. Wu X.S. Peterson C.A. Webster K.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26087-26093Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). In our experiment, hypoxia activated the COX-2 promoter by increasing the activator Sp1 and not changing the repressor Sp3. In both cases, the Sp1/Sp3 ratio is elevated. It appears that an elevated Sp1/Sp3 ratio is critical to the gene activation involved with Sp1 and Sp3 as both compete for the same binding site. Both Sp1 and Sp3 are expressed at high levels in endothelial cells, and the Sp1/Sp3 ratio in these cells is much higher than that in non-endothelial cells (22Hata Y. Duh E. Zhang K. Robinson G.S. Aiello L.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19294-19303Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). In Sp-deficient Drosophila SL2 cells, we noticed that Sp3 acted as a weak activator of COX-2 promoter instead of a repressor. This is consistent with the concept that Sp3 is a bi-functional regulator (repressor/activator) depending on the promoter or cellular context, as reported previously (20Suske G. Gene (Amst.). 1999; 238: 291-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (985) Google Scholar, 23Hansen T.V.O. Bundgaard J.R. Nielsen F.C. Rehfeld J.F. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1999; 155: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). An inhibitory domain has been identified at the 5′ end of the zinc finger DNA-binding domain of Sp3; our findings support previous data indicating that the inhibitory domain of Sp3 functions only in mammalian cells (24Majello B. De Luca P. Lania L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4021-4026Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). HIE-1 is not found adjacent to cox-2 (15Appleby S.B. Ristimäki A.

Given the sum of our published data, it would appear that there are hypoxia-inducible enhancers other than HIE-1 that regulatecox-2 transcription.

Russell D.W. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 72-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (1073) Google Scholar). This protein can induce transcription of the gene for endothelial tyrosine kinase Tie-2, and its activity is stimulated by hypoxia. It shares a 48% sequence identity with HIF-1α.

Hh signaling complex glutathione S-transferase phosphate-buffered saline protease inhibitor mixture polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis wild type Hedgehog (hh) was first identified as a Drosophila melanogaster gene required during early embryogenesis (1.Nusslein-Volhard C.

Although the importance of Hh family members in development and various human pathologies continues to be uncovered, their mechanism of action remains poorly understood. A combination of genetics and biochemistry has begun to delineate a pathway through which Hh acts. Hh binds to the multiple membrane-spanning receptor, Patched (Ptc) (3.Marigo V. Davey R.A. Zuo Y.

Cos2 associates with Fu and Ci in a large multiprotein complex (∼1000 kDa) (22.Robbins D.J. Nybakken K.E. Kobayashi R. Sisson J.C. Bishop J.M. Thérond P.P. Cell. 1997; 90: 225-234Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). This complex binds microtubules in an Hh-dependent manner, presumably through Cos2. It has been suggested that this Hh signaling complex (HSC)1 is involved in the proteolytic processing of Ci, generating a transcriptional repressor form of Ci in the absence of Hh (23.Ruiz i Altaba A. Cell. 1997; 90: 193-196Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). This processing of Ci is inhibited when Hh is present, leading to an accumulation and activation of full-length Ci (24.Aza-Blanc P. Ramirez-Weber F.A. Laget M.P. Schwartz C. Kornberg T.B. Cell. 1997; 89: 1043-1053Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (552) Google Scholar). Su(fu) was originally described as an extragenic suppressor of fu that was able to completely rescue both embryonic and adult fu phenotypes (25.Préat T. Genetics. 1992; 132: 725-736Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It has been previously reported, using a yeast two-hybrid approach, that Su(fu) may bind directly to Fu and Ci (26.Monnier V. Dussillol F. Alves G. Lamour-Isnard C. Plessis A. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 583-586Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Monnier et al. (26.Monnier V. Dussillol F. Alves G. Lamour-Isnard C. Plessis A. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 583-586Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) suggested a model in which Su(fu) forms a bridge between Fu and Ci, which do not directly interact. Their model would require Su(fu) to be an integral part of the HSC, a role inconsistent with the observation thatSu(fu) null flies have no apparent phenotype (25.Préat T. Genetics. 1992; 132: 725-736Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We provide here biochemical evidence for a tetrameric signaling complex consisting of Fu, Ci, Cos2, and Su(fu) that does not appear to be enriched on microtubules. Furthermore, we demonstrate that Cos2, Ci, and Fu can all associate directly with each other to form a competent trimeric Hh signaling complex, even in the absence of Su(fu). Although both of these complexes contain Ci, upon Hh stimulation Ci enriches in the nucleus whereas the other components do not. A full-length Su(fu) cDNA was fused in frame to the cDNA for glutathioneS-transferase (GST). The fusion protein was produced and purified by binding to glutathione-agarose as described previously (27.Crowley M.T. Harmer S.L. Defranco A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1145-1152Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Antiserum was then produced to the purified protein by standard methods (Research Genetics, Huntsville, AL), followed by affinity purification (28.Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual.

Sf21 cells were cultured in Grace's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented to 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin:streptomycin. The baculoviruses were produced, and infections were carried out according to the manufacturer's directions (Bac-to-Bac, Life Technologies, Inc.).

Cellular lysates were centrifuged at 5,000 × g for 15 min, and the supernatants were subsequently centrifuged at 100,000 ×g for 30 min. The resulting cellular lysates were then immunoprecipitated as described previously (22.Robbins D.J. Nybakken K.E. Kobayashi R. Sisson J.C. Bishop J.M. Thérond P.P.

C, co-sedimentation of Su(fu) with Fu, Ci, and Cos2. GST-Su(fu) co-sedimentation was performed on various baculovirus-infected cellular lysates, and wt baculovirus-infected lysate was used as a control (lanes 1–3). Associated proteins were fractionated by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with the appropriate antibodies. An incubation of cellular lysates with glutathione beads in the absence of GST is also shown for each condition (Ctrl.).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Sf21 cells were lysed as described above. The supernatants were pre-cleared with glutathione-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for 30 min at 4 °C. The various pre-cleared supernatants were incubated for 1 h with 5 μg of either GST alone or GST-Su(fu). Glutathione-Sepharose 4B was then added to each tube and incubated for an additional 30 min. Bound proteins were collected by centrifugation, washed 3 times with PBS, 1% Nonidet P-40, and eluted by boiling in 2× PAGE loading buffer (0.12 m Tris, 20% glycerol, 4% SDS, 0.2% bromphenol blue). Imaginal discs were isolated from wild type orSu(fu) LP/Su(fu) LPthird instar larvae (22.Robbins D.J. Nybakken K.E. Kobayashi R. Sisson J.C. Bishop J.M. Thérond P.P. Cell. 1997; 90: 225-234Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). Su(fu) LP is a null allele (25.Préat T. Genetics. 1992; 132: 725-736Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The imaginal discs from approximately 40 larvae were lysed in 400 μl of Nonidet P-40 buffer containing PI at 4 °C. Immunoprecipitations from these lysates were performed as described previously (22.Robbins D.J. Nybakken K.E. Kobayashi R. Sisson J.C. Bishop J.M. Thérond P.P. Cell. 1997; 90: 225-234Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). To determine the direct interactions among the members of the HSC we made baculoviruses that express Fu, Cos2, or Ci. These various recombinant viruses were used to infect Sf21 cells on their own, in pairs, or in triplicate. 48 h post-infection the cells were lysed, and aliquots of the lysates were separated by SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblotting. The various components of the HSC were highly and specifically expressed in the appropriately infected cells (Fig.1 A). These overexpressed proteins were then immunoprecipitated with antibodies to Fu, Cos2, and Ci or with normal rabbit serum. We demonstrate here that a trimeric Fu, Ci, and Cos2 complex can form (Fig. 1 B). From the appropriately double-infected lysates, Fu co-immunoprecipitated with either Ci or Cos2 (lanes 14–16 and 8–10) and Cos2 co-immunoprecipitated with Ci (lanes 11–13), compared with the appropriate controls. Additionally, all three overexpressed proteins are immunoprecipitated from the triple-infected Sf21 lysates with antibodies to Fu, Ci, or Cos2 but not with control IgG (lanes 17–20). Thus, Fu, Cos2, and Ci bind to each other in a trimeric complex, in what we speculate is a direct fashion (see “Discussion”). These results, especially the association between Fu and Ci, were contradictory to a previous report suggesting that Su(fu) tethered Ci to Fu (26.Monnier V. Dussillol F. Alves G. Lamour-Isnard C. Plessis A. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 583-586Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To verify the existence of a trimeric Fu, Ci, and Cos2 complex that does not require Su(fu), we immunoprecipitated with Fu antibodies from cellular lysates made from wild typeDrosophila or Drosophila lackingSu(fu). We were able to specifically co-immunoprecipitate Ci and Cos2 with Fu from both lysates (Fig. 1 C). These data are consistent with our baculovirus data, which provide evidence for a complex of Fu, Ci, and Cos2 that forms and is stable in the absence of Su(fu). The existence of this trimeric signaling complex, in the absence of Su(fu), is consistent with the lack of an apparent phenotype in Su(fu) null flies (25.Préat T. Genetics. 1992; 132: 725-736Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Because Hh signaling does not appear to be interrupted by the lack of Su(fu), Su(fu) can not be a requisite member of the HSC. Although Su(fu) is not a requisite component of the HSC, it might still associate with it. To test this possibility we made antibodies to Su(fu) to use to co-immunoprecipitate the other components of the HSC. These antibodies were tested for their specificity by immunoblotting cellular lysates made from wild type Drosophila orDrosophila lacking Su(fu). The Su(fu) antibodies detected an immunoreactive protein of the predicted size, approximately 54 kDa, which was absent in lysates from Su(fu) flies (Fig.2 A). Tubulin was immunoblotted to verify protein normalization. Thus, our Su(fu) antibodies specifically recognize Su(fu). Cellular lysates from cl8 cells, treated with or without Hh, were immunoprecipitated with antibodies to Su(fu), Fu, or control IgG (Fig.2 B). We show here that Ci and Fu co-immunoprecipitate with Su(fu) and that this association is Hh-independent. We further demonstrate that Cos2 associates with these Su(fu)-containing complexes and that these associations are not detected in immunoprecipitations performed with an equivalent amount of control IgG (compare lanes 1 and 4 to 2 and 5). Thus, Su(fu) can exist complexed with all the currently identified members of the HSC, and the bulk of these associations are independent of Hh. To determine which components of the HSC associate directly with Su(fu) we added GST-Su(fu) or GST to lysates of baculovirus-infected Sf21 cell as indicated in Fig. 2 C. These proteins were then collected by sedimentation with glutathione-agarose beads, fractionated by SDS-PAGE, and immunoblotted. Cos2 did not co-sediment with GST-Su(fu) significantly more than with GST alone, suggesting that Su(fu) does not bind Cos2 directly. However, when Su(fu) was incubated with lysates from cells co-infected with Cos2 and either Ci or Fu, the amount of Cos2 that co-sedimented was increased. Thus, Fu and Ci appear to bind directly to Su(fu) (lanes 9 and 12), whereas Cos2 binds to Su(fu) through either Fu or Ci (lanes 15 and 18). Finally, we demonstrate that all three known components of the HSC co-sediment with GST-Su(fu) from lysates of Sf21 cells infected with Fu, Ci, and Cos2. Thus, we are able to recreate the tetrameric signaling complex seen in vivo, by mixing recombinant Su(fu) with lysate from Fu, Cos2, and Ci triple-infected cells. To determine whether Su(fu) is part of the previously described microtubule-bound HSC (17.Sisson J.C. Ho K.S. Suyama K. Scott M.P.

Cell. 1997; 90: 225-234Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar) we used Drosophilaembryo extracts to perform a microtubule co-sedimentation assay. As described previously, Fu, Cos2, and Ci enrich on microtubules, compared with a control assay performed in the absence of taxol-stabilized microtubules (Fig. 3). However, Su(fu) did not appear to co-sediment on microtubules with the other members of the HSC. Thus, although Su(fu) is part of a tetrameric signaling complex, this Su(fu)-containing complex does not appear to be enriched on microtubules. This suggests that there are at least two HSCs, one containing Su(fu) and one not, which may be in equilibrium with each other. To test the possibility that the non-microtubule bound HSC containing Su(fu) might translocate with Ci to the nucleus we treated cl8 cells with either Hh or the nuclear export inhibitor leptomysinB (LMB). As previously reported (31.Chen C.H. von Kessler D.P. Park W. Wang B. Ma Y. Beachy P.A. Cell. 1999; 98: 305-316Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar), both Hh and LMB were able to induce nuclear accumulation of Ci (Fig.4). However, neither agent had any effect on the nuclear accumulation of the other components of the HSC, including Su(fu). Thus, before Ci translocates to the nucleus it apparently dissociates from the other known members of the HSC, because there is no nuclear enrichment of Fu, Cos2, or Su(fu) in response to Hh or LMB. Although new components of the Hh signaling pathway continue to emerge, the biochemical mechanisms underlying Hh signal transduction remain poorly understood. We have previously demonstrated that several components of the Hh signaling pathway form a large cytoplasmic complex that binds microtubules in an Hh-dependent manner (17.Sisson J.C. Ho K.S. Suyama K. Scott M.P. Cell. 1997; 90: 235-245Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar, 22.Robbins D.J. Nybakken K.E. Kobayashi R. Sisson J.C. Bishop J.M. Thérond P.P. Cell. 1997; 90: 225-234Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). We show here that Fu, Cos2, and Ci bind directly to each other to form a stable trimeric signaling complex, which exists and functions inDrosophila that lack Su(fu). Additionally, we provide evidence for a second HSC that contains Su(fu) and does not appear to be enriched on microtubules. Su(fu) binds to this second HSC to form a cytoplasmic tetrameric complex with Fu, Ci, and Cos2. In response to Hh, we show that full-length Ci leaves these cytoplasmic complexes and translocates to the nucleus, where it acts as a positive regulator of the Hh pathway. There appear to be multiple associations among the various components of the trimeric HSC. These multiple associations may account for the stability of this complex on microtubules (17.Sisson J.C. Ho K.S. Suyama K. Scott M.P. Cell. 1997; 90: 235-245Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar, 22.Robbins D.J. Nybakken K.E. Kobayashi R. Sisson J.C. Bishop J.M.

Cell. 1997; 90: 225-234Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar), as well as provide an explanation for the elaborate genetic interactions observed among the various genes that encode this signaling complex (10.Forbes, A. J., Nakano, Y., Taylor, A. M., and Ingham, P. W. (1993) Dev. Suppl. 115–24Google Scholar, 25.Préat T. Genetics. 1992; 132: 725-736Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 33.Ohlmeyer J.T. Kalderon D.

Dev. 1996; 55: 159-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). We propose that the interactions between Fu, Ci, and Cos2 in this trimeric signaling complex are direct and do not require participation of any endogenous Sf21 proteins, for the following reasons: 1) Fu, Ci, and Cos2 are highly over-expressed by their respective baculoviruses and should therefore be present in large stoichiometric excess over any HSC component endogenous to Sf21 cells; 2) baculovirus-expressed Cos2 does not bind to GST-Su(fu), consistent with the lack of endogenous Sf21 Fu or Sf21 Ci (see Fig. 2 C); and finally 3) Fu isolated from baculovirus-infected Sf21 cells migrates through a gel filtration column with a molecular size inconsistent with the presence of additional members of the HSC. 2J. Sosinski and D. J. Robbins, unpublished data. If a trimeric HSC is sufficient to elaborate Hh signaling, then what role might Su(fu) play in a tetrameric complex? We speculated that Su(fu) might interact with the HSC because of the genetic interactions among Su(fu),fu, ci, and cos2 (33.Ohlmeyer J.T. Kalderon D. Nature. 1998; 396: 749-753Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar, 35.Préat T. Thérond P. Limbourg-Bouchon B. Pham A. Tricoire H. Busson D. Lamour-Isnard C. Genetics. 1993; 135: 1047-1062Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For example, alleles of fu that encode mutations in their protein kinase domain display no phenotype in an Su(fu)homozygous background. However, mutations that delete the carboxyl terminus of Fu result in a cos2 phenotype in anSu(fu) background. Additionally, cos2heterozygotes have a more severe cos2 phenotype in anSu(fu) background than in a wild type background. We have now biochemically demonstrated that Su(fu) interacts with an Fu, Ci, and Cos2 complex to form a tetrameric signaling complex (see Fig. 2). It appears that Su(fu) binds directly to Fu and Ci, but not to Cos2, and that the bulk of these interactions are stable in both the presence and absence of Hh. However, this Su(fu)-containing complex does not appear to be enriched on microtubules. Thus, this tetrameric complex may represent a stable intermediate in the progression of Ci from the cytoskeleton to the nucleus. The equilibrium between these various complexes may change in response to Hh, as may occur when Ci sheds the other members of the HSC prior to nuclear translocation (see below). A number of vertebrate homologs of Su(fu) have recently been identified (32.Stone D.M. Murone M. Luoh S. Ye W. Armanini M.P. Gurney A. Phillips H. Brush J. Goddard A. de Sauvage F.J. Rosenthal A. J.

These groups suggest that Su(fu) sequesters Gli1 in the cytoplasm, thereby limiting its ability to act as a transcription factor. It has also been proposed that Cos2 may act by sequestering Ci in the cytoplasm (17.Sisson J.C. Ho K.S. Suyama K. Scott M.P. Cell. 1997; 90: 235-245Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar, 22.Robbins D.J. Nybakken K.E. Kobayashi R. Sisson J.C. Bishop J.M. Thérond P.P.

Cell. 1999; 98: 305-316Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). We propose that Su(fu) and Cos2, both of which bind directly to Ci, play redundant roles in sequestering Ci in the cytoplasm, Cos2 by tethering Ci to microtubules and Su(fu) by some other distinct mechanism. This might explain why no change in Ci localization has been detected in either cos2 orSu(fu) mutants, because both gene products would have to be deficient to observe a change in localization of Ci (17.Sisson J.C.

Silva A.J. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1999; 9: 209-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). A critical autophosphorylation at Thr286confers calcium-independent activity to the kinase and underlies its ability to decode the frequency of calcium transients (2De Koninck P. Schulman H. Science. 1998; 279: 227-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (1083) Google Scholar). Although CaMKII is an abundant soluble protein, it is also a major component of postsynaptic densities (PSDs), cytoskeletal scaffolds for neurotransmitter receptors and their regulators (3Kennedy M.B. Trends Neurosci. 1997; 20: 264-268Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar, 4Ziff E.B.

Localization of CaMKII to PSDs is believed to be important in regulating the phosphorylation of glutamate receptor GluR1 subunits (5McGlade-McCulloh E. Yamamoto H. Tan S.E. Brickey D.A.

We have recently identified the NR2B subunit of theN-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA)-receptor as a targeting protein for Thr286-autophosphorylated CaMKII (9Strack S. Colbran R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20689-20692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar,10Strack S. McNeill R.B. Colbran R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23798-23806Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). Here, we characterize developmentally regulated, putative splice variants of the postsynaptic density protein densin-180 as additional PSD-anchoring proteins that bind CaMKII by a mechanism different from that of NR2B. Rat forebrain RNA was isolated with Trizol reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to supplied instructions. Sense and antisense primers corresponding to the borders of the putative cytosolic domain of densin-180 including BamHI and EcoRI adapters (sense, CGGGATCCGACAAGACATCAGATAACAGTG; antisense, GGAATTCTTAGACAGTGAGCTCACGTTG) were used to clone densin-180 by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) according to instructions for the Access RT-PCR kit (Promega). RT-PCR products were gel-purified and ligated into the prokaryotic glutathioneS-transferase (GST)-fusion protein expression vector pGEX-2T (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and sequenced on both strands. The D variant contains a novel 141-bp insert (GenBankTMaccession no. AF266164). Truncation constructs were generated utilizing PCR or endogenous restriction sites. Site-directed mutagenesis was carried out by separately PCR-amplifying densin-180 halves 5′ and 3′ of the point mutation, utilizing complementary mutagenic primers that also incorporate a unique silent restriction site to permit reassembly of the two PCR products. Fusion protein were expressed and purified on glutathione-agarose by standard methods. Purification of the murine α isoform of CaMKII from Sf9 cells, site-specific autophosphorylation of CaMKIIα at Thr286 in the presence and at Thr305/306 in the absence of calcium/calmodulin, and [32P]CaMKIIα overlay binding assays were performed as described (11McNeill R.B. Colbran R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10043-10049Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Glutathione-microtiter plate binding and glutathione-agarose sedimentation assays were described previously (10Strack S. McNeill R.B. Colbran R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23798-23806Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). A membrane-targeted fusion protein cDNA was constructed as described for a similar protein targeted to mitochondria (10Strack S. McNeill R.B. Colbran R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23798-23806Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). Briefly, this construct encodes, from N to C termini, a 10-amino acid membrane-targeting sequence from the Lck tyrosine kinase with myristoylation and dual palmitoylation sites (12Zlatkine P. Mehul B. Magee A.I. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 673-679PubMed Google Scholar), a Myc epitope tag, and the GST and green fluorescent protein coding sequences. Domain 4 of the densin-180 cytoplasmic tail was ligated into BamHI and EcoRI sites between the GST and green fluorescent protein sequences. HEK293 cells were cotransfected with the membrane-targeted fusion protein and CaMKII expression plasmids, and colocalization was assayed by double-immunofluorescence confocal microscopy (9Strack S. Colbran R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20689-20692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar, 10Strack S. McNeill R.B. Colbran R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23798-23806Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). In an effort to identify proteins that target CaMKII to PSDs, we have previously characterized a p190 band enriched in postsynaptic densities that binds Thr286-autophosphorylated CaMKIIα by overlay (11McNeill R.B. Colbran R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10043-10049Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). The NR2B subunit of the NMDA receptor was shown to be a component of this 190-kDa binding activity (9Strack S. Colbran R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20689-20692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar, 10Strack S. McNeill R.B. Colbran R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23798-23806Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). To reveal other potential CaMKII-binding proteins that comigrate with NR2B, PSD proteins were treated with N-glycanase to removeN-linked carbohydrates. Deglycosylation lead to a quantitative increase in electrophoretic mobility of NR2A and NR2B subunit immunoreactivity, whereas only a fraction of the CaMKII-binding activity was shifted similarly (data not shown), implicating the existence of at least one other ∼190 kDa CaMKII-binding protein in PSDs. Densin-180 is a PSD-enriched O-sialoglycoprotein of 180 kDa with a sequence predicting a large N-terminal extracellular domain, a single transmembrane domain, and a short cytosolic tail ending in a PDZ domain of unknown ligand specificity (13Apperson M.L. Moon I.S. Kennedy M.B. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 6839-6852Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As a first step toward investigating whether densin-180 is the missing CaMKII-binding protein, RT-PCR was used to isolate cDNA clones encoding the densin-180 cytosolic tail from rat brain RNA isolated at various developmental stages. The predicted 790-bp RT-PCR product (A variant) was amplified, along with additional products of 670, 570, and 940 bp, designated B through D (Fig. 1 B). Sequencing revealed that the A variant encodes the known densin-180 cytosolic tail (13Apperson M.L. Moon I.S. Kennedy M.B. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 6839-6852Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), whereas the B and C variants encode cytosolic tails lacking amino acids 1291–1330 and 1331–1404, respectively. The D variant encodes a C-terminal tail with a novel 47-amino acid sequence inserted after R1290 (clone numbering from Ref. 13Apperson M.L. Moon I.S. Kennedy M.B. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 6839-6852Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which is unlikely to be an incompletely spliced intron because its 5′ and 3′ ends do not conform to an intronic splice site consensus (17Senapathy P. Shapiro M.B. Harris N.L. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 183: 252-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (624) Google Scholar). These variants define five domains of the densin-180 cytosolic tail (Fig. 1 A), presumably corresponding to differentially spliced exons; domain 1 and 5, the PDZ domain, are common to all variants (Fig. 1 A). Presumed splice variations in the densin-180 extracellular domain also were described (13Apperson M.L. Moon I.S. Kennedy M.B. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 6839-6852Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), implying even greater structural diversity of densin-180. The putative splicing of the cytosolic tail appears to be developmentally regulated. Expression of the D variant was predominant at E18 but decreased during early postnatal development, paralleling increased expression of A and B variants (Fig. 1 B). The C variant was most consistently detected in embryonic and early postnatal RNA samples. Since most synapses (and PSDs develop postnatally, embryonic forms of densin-180 may be involved in early developmental processes such as process outgrowth and path finding. Densin-180 can be phosphorylated by CaMKII in PSDs at unidentified sites (18). Phosphoamino acid analysis following exhaustive phosphorylation of cytosolic tail fusion proteins by CaMKIIin vitro revealed 90% Ser phosphate and 10% Thr phosphate, indicating phosphorylation at multiple sites (data not shown). Intriguingly, a sequence matching a consensus CaMKII phosphorylation site, (I/L)XRXX(S/T) (14White R.R. Kwon Y.-G. Taing M. Lawrence D.S. Edelman A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3166-3179Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar), bridges domain boundaries and is altered in some densin variants (Fig.2 A). Deletion of domain 3 in variant B removes Ser94 as a potential phosphate acceptor (numbering starting with the first residue of the longest, D variant cytosolic tail), but reconstitutes the consensus motif with Ser134 in domain 4. Insertion of domain 2 of the D variant replaces the terminal LDR residues of domain 1 with LQK, which differs only in a conservative substitution (Arg to Lys) from the phosphorylation consensus. Ser94 (or the positionally equivalent Ser134 in the B variant) was mutated to Asp, and CaMKII phosphorylation of the GST-cytosolic tail fusion proteins was compared with wild-type sequences (Fig.2 B). Replacing this serine in the A, B, and D variants reduced 32P incorporation by about half and abolished phosphorylation of the C variant completely, demonstrating that differential splicing conserves phosphorylation of this residue. These data also imply the existence of an additional phosphorylation site in domain 4, missing in the C variant. Phosphoamino acid analysis of truncation constructs narrowed down the candidate residue to the single serine within residues 180–205, Ser198 (data not shown), even though the context of this residue (TKGQRS) does not conform to the CaMKII phosphorylation consensus (14White R.R. Kwon Y.-G. Taing M. Lawrence D.S. Edelman A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3166-3179Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Indeed, the S198D mutant A variant displayed a 40–50% reduced phosphorylation, and the S94D/S198D double mutant could be phosphorylated to less than 10% of wild-type (Fig. 2 B), indicating that these two residues are the major CaMKII phosphorylation sites, at least in vitro. To determine whether CaMKII can stably interact with the cytosolic tails of densin-180, fusion proteins were probed with CaMKIIα, 32P-labeled by autophosphorylation at Thr286 ([32P-Thr286]CaMKIIα). Specific binding was detected to the full-length cytosolic tails of the A, B, and D but not the C variant (Fig.3 A); signal intensities were similar to CaMKII binding to NR2B fusion proteins on the same blots (not shown). The failure of CaMKII to bind to the C variant suggested that domain 4 contains important binding determinants. Furthermore, overlay analysis of truncation constructs demonstrated that domain 4 is sufficient for CaMKII binding (Fig.3 B). Residues 155–182 within domain 4 were found necessary for binding but supported only reduced interaction with CaMKII when expressed in isolation, suggesting that flanking regions may stabilize the interaction of CaMKII with densin-180 residues 155–182. Interestingly, the sequence of this domain bears no resemblance to that of the CaMKII-binding domain in NR2B (residues 1290–1309 (14White R.R. Kwon Y.-G. Taing M. Lawrence D.S. Edelman A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3166-3179Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar)). Whereas NR2B-(1290–1309) contains a high affinity CaMKII phosphorylation site that modulates CaMKII binding (14White R.R. Kwon Y.-G. Taing M. Lawrence D.S. Edelman A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3166-3179Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar), residues 155–182 in densin-180 are not phosphorylated and the presumed phosphomimetic S94D/S134D and S198D mutations do not affect CaMKII binding by overlay (not shown). To determine the affinity of the CaMKII:densin-180 interaction, [32P-Thr286]CaMKIIα was incubated with densin-180 cytosolic tail (A variant) GST-fusion proteins immobilized on glutathione-coated microtiter plates (Fig.4 A). CaMKII bound saturably with an affinity of 150–250 nm (n = 2), and Scatchard analysis indicated a simple bimolecular event (not shown). This K d is similar to theK d for the CaMKII:NR2B interaction (9Strack S. Colbran R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20689-20692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar) and two orders of magnitude lower than the average concentration of CaMKII in neurons (11McNeill R.B. Colbran R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10043-10049Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 15Erondu N.E. Kennedy M.B. J. Neurosci. 1985; 5: 3270-3277Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that both complexes can exist in neurons. NR2B only binds to the Thr286-autophosphorylated, calcium/calmodulin-independent form of CaMKII (9Strack S. Colbran R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20689-20692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar, 10Strack S. McNeill R.B. Colbran R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23798-23806Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). In contrast, densin-180 bound significant amounts of inactive CaMKII,32P-labeled by Thr305/306 autophosphorylation in the absence of calcium/calmodulin (11McNeill R.B. Colbran R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10043-10049Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), in glutathione-plate assays (Fig. 4 A, inset), a finding that was confirmed in overlay experiments (not shown). Furthermore, in glutathione-agarose cosedimentation experiments, Thr286 autophosphorylation increased the amount of CaMKII copurifying with densin-180 to stoichiometric levels, even though some CaMKII copurified without prior autophosphorylation (Fig. 4 B). The finding that the densin-180 and NR2B interactions differ in their degree of dependence on CaMKII Thr286 autophosphorylation, combined with the lack of conservation between the CaMKII-binding domains in NR2B and densin-180, suggests different mechanisms of binding. Competition experiments support this conclusion. Whereas soluble NR2B cytosolic tail protein inhibits CaMKII binding to immobilized GST-NR2B fusion protein in a concentration-dependent manner, it has no effect on CaMKII binding to GST-densin-180 (Fig. 4 C), indicating that densin-180 and NR2B interact with different and independent sites on CaMKII and suggesting that ternary complexes may exist in neurons. Densin-180 is highly enriched in PSDs and colocalizes with CaMKII at synapses of hippocampal neurons (13Apperson M.L. Moon I.S. Kennedy M.B. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 6839-6852Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), consistent with our proposed function of densin-180 as a CaMKII-targeting protein. To demonstrate directly that densin-180 can alter the subcellular localization of CaMKII, we cotransfected HEK293 cells with CaMKII and a synthetic fusion protein targeted to the membrane via multiple acylations (see “Experimental Procedures”). This fusion protein was expressed in large patches and in small punctate or ring-shaped profiles (Fig.5). The small profiles, shown to be on the cell surface by optical sectioning, likely correspond to caveolae, where the tyrosine kinase Lck from which the membrane-targeting sequence was derived is localized (16Shenoy-Scaria A.M. Dietzen D.J. Kwong J. Link D.C. Lublin D.M. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 353-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). Coexpression of the membrane-targeted fusion protein without insert had no effect on the localization of CaMKII, which remained diffusely localized in the cytoplasm (Fig. 5). When the CaMKII-binding domain 4 of densin-180 (residues 132–205, Fig. 3 B) was inserted into the membrane-targeting vector, CaMKII localization changed dramatically, resulting in strong colocalization (Fig. 5). Colocalization of CaMKII with artificially targeted NR2B sequences and NMDA receptors containing the full-length NR2B subunit requires calcium mobilization and is not absolute, presumably because CaMKII:NR2B complex formation requires Thr286 autophosphorylation of CaMKII but is antagonized by NR2B phosphorylation (9Strack S. Colbran R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20689-20692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar, 10Strack S. McNeill R.B. Colbran R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23798-23806Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). In contrast, CaMKII and densin-180 colocalization was near perfect under basal conditions and was not detectably altered by calcium ionophore treatment (2 μm A23187 for 5 and 15 min, data not shown). In summary, densin-180 may be responsible for constitutively anchoring CaMKII to the PSD, where it is poised to respond to localized calcium influx by phosphorylating postsynaptic substrates important in synaptic plasticity. The highly regulated CaMKII:NR2B interaction (9Strack S. Colbran R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20689-20692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar, 10Strack S. McNeill R.B. Colbran R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23798-23806Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar), on the other hand, may underlie the dynamic association of CaMKII with PSDs following synaptic activation (7Strack S. Choi S. Lovinger D.M. Colbran R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13467-13470Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar, 8Shen K. Meyer T. Science. 1999; 284: 162-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar). Although phosphorylation of densin-180 itself does not appear to affect CaMKII binding, the careful reconstitution of one of the phosphorylation sites during alternative splicing suggests phosphorylation could have other important roles, perhaps in regulating the association of densin-180 with other proteins. Finally, the existence of the C variant of densin-180 that lacks the CaMKII-binding domain suggests alternative splicing as a potential mechanism for regulating the association of CaMKII with PSDs."

Within the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum, these chaperones are also involved in reverse translocation and degradation of misfolded proteins. We describe here the cloning and characterization of a novel Hsp40 chaperone, which we named HEDJ. Epitope-tagged HEDJ was demonstrated by confocal microscopy to be localized to the endoplasmic reticulum. Protease susceptibility, glycosidase treatment, and detergent solubility assays demonstrated that the molecule was luminally oriented and membrane-associated. In vitro experiments demonstrated that the J domain interacted with the endoplasmic reticulum-associated Hsp70, Bip, in an ATP-dependent manner and was capable of stimulating its ATPase activity. HEDJ mRNA expression was detected in all human tissues examined. Highly homologous sequences were found in mouse, Drosophila, andCaenorhabditis elegans data bases.

For example, the ER is a site not only of protein modification and sorting but is also an important site of quality control. Intramolecular folding, a requisite for normal protein function, must occur upon import into the ER lumen, where molecular chaperones such as calnexin and calreticulin interact with nascent proteins and retain them in the ER until folding has been correctly achieved (1Cannon K.S. Helenius A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7537-7544Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 2Zhang J.X. Braakman I. Matlack K.E. Helenius A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 1943-1954Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 3Tatu U. Helenius A. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 555-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). In an incompletely understood manner, proteins that remain misfolded are exported from the endoplasmic reticulum to the cytoplasm where they are commonly ubiquitinated and degraded by the proteosome (4Xiong X. Chong E. Skach W.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2616-2624Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 5Kopito R.R. Cell. 1997; 88: 427-430Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar). Central to each of these activities are molecular chaperones belonging to the Hsp70 and Hsp40 families. Within the ER lumen, Bip (also known as Grp78 in mammalian cells or Kar2 in yeast), a member of the Hsp70 chaperone family, is involved in essentially all aspects of protein synthesis and secretion. For example, in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, mutations in Bip result in defects in protein translocation, folding, and reverse translocation (6Vogel J.P. Misra L.M. Rose M.D. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 110: 1885-1895Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar, 7Nguyen T.H. Law D.T. Williams D.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 1565-1569Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). However, Bip, like other Hsp70 chaperones, cannot work in isolation. The intrinsic ATPase and folding activity of Bip is stimulated by members of the Hsp40 co-chaperones, also known as DNAJ-related proteins, afterEscherichia coli DNAJ, the progenitor family member. These co-chaperones are characterized by the presence of a highly conserved 75-amino acid region termed the J domain, which is the predominant site of interaction with Hsp70 partners (8Greene M.K. Maskos K. Landry S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6108-6113Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). The main function of Hsp40 co-chaperones appears to be stimulation of Hsp 70 chaperones (9Suh W.C. Burkholder W.F. Lu C.Z. Zhao X. Gottesman M.E. Gross C.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 15223-15228Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar, 10Silver P.A. Way J.C. Cell. 1993; 74: 5-6Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar, 11Russell R. Wali Karzai A.

Sci. 1994; 19: 176-181Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar). Given their importance for Hsp70 function, Hsp40 molecules are involved in nearly all aspects of protein synthesis and secretion (13Caplan A.J. Cyr D.M. Douglas M.G. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1993; 4: 555-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar, 14Cheetham M.E. Caplan A.J. Cell Stress Chaperon. 1998; 3: 28-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar). In addition to their role in stimulating ATP hydrolysis by Hsp70, some Hsp40 chaperones are felt to have an intrinsic ability to bind and fold at least some misfolded proteins (15Hendrick J.P. Langer T. Davis T.A. Hartl F.U. Wiedmann M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10216-10220Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 16Hartl F.U. Nature. 1996; 381: 571-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (3077) Google Scholar). During post-translational protein translocation into the yeast ER, Bip interacts with Sec63, a membrane-anchored protein bearing a J domain (17Corsi A.K. Schekman R. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 1483-1493Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 18Sadler I. Chiang A. Kurihara T. Rothblatt J. Way J. Silver P. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 2665-2675Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar, 19Matlack K.E.S. Plath K. Misselwitz B. Rapoport T.A. Science. 1997; 277: 938-941Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 20Lyman S.K. Schekman R. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 1163-1171Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 21Pilon M. Romisch K. Quach D. Schekman R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 3455-3473Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). It is assumed that Sec63, which forms part of the translocation apparatus, attracts Bip to the site of protein import via its J domain. Upon activation by Sec63, Bip binds nascent peptides and assists in protein import either by serving as an anchor during passive forward movement (a “Brownian ratchet”) (22Matlack K.E. Misselwitz B. Plath K. Rapoport T.A. Cell. 1999; 97: 553-564Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar), by actively pulling nascent molecules into the ER lumen (23Glick B.S. Cell. 1995; 80: 11-14Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar), or perhaps by both mechanisms. Mutations in either Bip or Sec63 result in defects in protein translocation into the ER (24Brodsky J.L. Goeckeler J. Schekman R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9643-9646Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). As mentioned previously, it is known that Bip also participates in refolding misfolded proteins once they reach the ER lumen and assists in reverse translocation of those that remain misfolded (25Brodsky J.L. Werner E.D. Dubas M.E. Goeckeler J.L. Kruse K.B. McCracken A.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3453-3460Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar, 26Sommer T. Wolf D.H. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 1227-1233Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). Recently it has become evident that the functions of Bip in import and export are distinct (25Brodsky J.L. Werner E.D. Dubas M.E. Goeckeler J.L. Kruse K.B. McCracken A.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3453-3460Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar), perhaps suggesting that Bip interacts with Hsp40 co-chaperones other than Sec63 in reverse translocation. Similarly, Bip likely interacts with another (or several other) Hsp40 molecules to enable protein folding within the lumen. Indeed, in S. cerevisiae, two additional Hsp40 co-chaperones have thus far been identified in the ER and found to interact with Bip in protein folding (27Schlenstedt G. Harris S. Risse B. Lill R. Silver P.A. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 979-988Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 28Silberstein S. Schlenstedt G. Silver P.A. Gilmore R. J.

Cell . 1999; 10: 609-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). In contrast, no Hsp40 molecules have yet been identified in the ER of higher eucaryotes, including mammalian cells (28Silberstein S. Schlenstedt G. Silver P.A. Gilmore R. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 921-933Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 29Nishikawa S. Endo T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 244: 785-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). We describe here the expression pattern and intracellular localization of a novel Hsp40 chaperone, which we have termed HEDJ (forhuman ER-associatedDNAJ; the nomenclature follows that of yeast and human cytoplasmic Hsp40 molecules). HEDJ was found to be expressed in all human tissues examined. It was localized to the endoplasmic reticulum with a luminal orientation, was membrane-associated, and was able to bind and stimulate the activity of Bip. Highly homologous genes were found in mouse, Drosophila, and Caenorhabditis elegans data bases. Vero cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) and maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal calf serum. Transfections were performed as described (31Haslam D.B. Baenziger J.U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 10697-10702Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Approximately 5 × 105 cells were transfected with a mixture of plasmid DNA (3 μg) and LipofectAMINE (50 μl; Life Technologies, Inc.) in serum-free medium. 24 h later, medium was added. Experiments on transiently transfected cells were performed 48 h after transfection. For stable transfection, geneticin (1000 μg/ml; G418, Life Technologies, Inc.) was added to culture medium 48 h after transfection, and the cells were continually passaged in the presence of geneticin at 1000 μg/ml. Monoclonal anti-V5 antibody was obtained from Invitrogen. Monoclonal anti-HA antibody was obtained from Babco. Affinity purified polyclonal anti-calregulin and anti-Bip were obtained from StressGen. Human multiple tissue RNA blots were purchased from CLONTECH. Double-stranded DNA probes were radiolabeled with [32P]dCTP (3000 Ci/mmol) by random priming using reagents from Roche Molecular Biochemicals.Taq DNA polymerase and dNTPs were from Life Technologies, Inc. A portion of the HEDJ cDNA was isolated in a genetic screen for molecules involved in intracellular trafficking of shiga toxin, which will be described in detail elsewhere. In brief, Vero cells were transiently transfected with a cDNA expression library and exposed to shiga toxin. Resistant cells were enriched, and plasmid DNA was harvested by Hirt extraction and then used in a further two rounds of transfection and enrichment. After the third round of transient transfection and enrichment, cells were stably transfected with the enriched cDNA clones and selected in the presence of shiga toxin for two weeks. The cDNA inserts in toxin-resistant cells was amplified by polymerase chain reaction from cell lysates using primers flanking cDNA inserts. The resulting polymerase chain reaction products were directly cloned into plasmid pCR3.1Topo/V5/His (Invitrogen). Two transformants characterized contained identical inserts of approximately 600 base pairs and demonstrated homology to the Hsp40 family of co-chaperones. Although no matching sequences were identified in the GenBankTM data base, several identical sequences were identified in the human EST data base. Successive searches using BLAST against the human EST data base allowed identification of the entire coding region. The insert from plasmid pHED3 was released by digestion with HindIII and XhoI, gel purified, labeled with [32P]dCTP, and used as probe for Northern blots. 50 ng of purified β-actin DNA (CLONTECH) was similarly labeled. Human multiple tissue RNA blots were prehybridized for 30 min at 68 °C in RapidHyb solution (CLONTECH) and then hybridized for 1 h at 68 °C in the same solution containing 1.5 million cpm/ml of probe. Filters were washed at 50 °C in 0.2× SSC, O.1% SDS and exposed to Kodak Biomax MS film at −70 °C. A full-length, V5 epitope-tagged molecule was generated by amplifying the HEDJ cDNA from a human skeletal muscle library (CLONTECH) using primers Hsp-1 (5′-GGCCTCACAGGGCCGGGTGGGCTGG-3′) and Hsp-3 (5′-ATATCCTTGCAGTCCATTGTATACCTTC-3′), which deleted the stop codon. The resulting product was ligated into plasmid pCR3.1-Topo/V5/His to create plasmid pHED3, which consists of the full-length HEDJ, an in-frame 3′ fusion with the V5 epitope and a C-terminal histidine tag. The insert was sequenced to ensure fidelity. A truncated, HA epitope-tagged HEDJ was constructed by amplifying the HEDJ cDNA with primers Hsp-1 and Hsp-HA (5′-CTAGCCTGAGGCATAGTCAGGCACGTCATAAGGATAGCCGTTCTCACTATCTGACAGAACCTC-3′). The resulting product, which encodes amino acid residues 1–81 of the HEDJ cDNA, a C-terminal HA epitope (NGYPYDVPDYASG), and a stop codon, was ligated into vector pCR3.1-Topo/V5/His to create plasmid pHED-HA. The insert was sequenced to verify that errors had not been introduced by polymerase chain reaction. Vero cells were transiently transfected with pHED3 (full-length, V5/His-tagged HEDJ) or pHED-HA (truncated, HA-tagged HEDJ). Transfected cells were seeded in multiwell chambers on a glass slide, fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde at 4 °C for 1 h, permeabilized by the addition of 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS for 5 min at room temperature, and then incubated for 1 h at room temperature with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum plus 2% BSA (blocking buffer). Primary antibodies used were mouse anti-V5 or anti-HA at 1:200 dilution in blocking buffer. Double labeling experiments included goat anti-calnexin (DPP-23) at 1:200 dilution for 1 h at room temperature. After washing, Oregon yellow-conjugated anti-mouse (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) or Texas Red-conjugated anti-goat (Sigma) secondary antibody was added at 1:200 dilution in blocking buffer and incubated a further 1 h at room temperature. The slides were washed several times in blocking buffer then PBS, mounted with Aqua PolyMount (Polysciences, Warrington, PA), and visualized by epifluoresence confocal microscopy (Bio-Rad). Image processing was performed with the LaserSharp 1024 software package. To isolate crude microsomal extracts pHED3 transfected cells were scraped into PBS, centrifuged, resuspended in 100 mm MES buffer, pH 6.7, and then disrupted by 10 strokes in a tightly fitting glass Dounce homogenizer. Nuclei and cellular debris were removed by centrifugation at 4000 × g. Microsomes were precipitated from the supernatant by the addition of MnCl2 to 20 mm and incubation on ice for 30 min. Microsomes were sedimented for 5 min at 4000 × gand resuspended in the appropriate buffer for later experiments. Protease treatment was performed by adding proteinase K to a concentration of 100 μg/ml to microsomes resuspended in PBS either in the presence or absence of Triton X-100 at 1% final concentration. After incubating at 4 °C for 1 h, SDS-PAGE buffer was added, and the samples were boiled, electrophoresed on a 4–20% polyacrylamide gradient gel, and transferred to nitrocellulose. After blocking in 5% skim milk in PBS, HEDJ, or calregulin was detected by the addition of antibody against V5 (1:2500) or calregulin (1:500), respectively, and incubating for 2 h at room temperature. After washing and adding secondary antibody (horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse or anti-goat; 1:5000) for 1 h, filters were washed, immersed in ECL reagents (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and exposed to film. Glycosidase treatment was performed by resuspending microsomes to a final volume of 40 μl in water containing protease inhibitors (complete mixture; Roche Molecular Biochemicals). 40 μl of denaturation buffer (0.5% SDS, 1% β-mercaptoethanol) was added, and the samples were placed in a boiling water bath for 10 min and then divided into three aliquots. To these were added either Endo H (20 milliunits; Roche Molecular Biochemicals), PNGase F (100 units; New England Biolabs), or no glycosidase. The appropriate buffer was added, the volume was brought to 80 μl with water, and the samples were incubated at 37 °C. Aliquots were removed after 1 or 2 h and subjected to electrophoresis on a 10% polyacrylamide gel followed by Western blotting as described above. Solubilization of HEDJ was performed by preparing microsomes from pHED3 transfected cells. After freezing at −20 °C, the microsomes were resuspended in either PBS alone or PBS containing 0.1% Triton X-100, 1% Triton X-100, or 1% deoxycholate (DOC). After rocking at 4 °C for 1 h the samples were centrifuged at 4000 × gfor 5 min to sediment residual membranes and microsomes. The supernatant was removed to a new tube, and the pellet was resuspended in an equal volume of water. SDS-PAGE sample buffer was added, and the products were subjected to electrophoresis and Western blotting as described above. The J domain and a segment of the G/F linker region (residues 18–120) were amplified from plasmid pHED-7 using primers Hsp8 (5′-GGCCTGGAATTCGGGGCGGTGATTGCCGGACGAG-3′) and Hsp9 (5′-GCAGGTCGACTCGAGCTATCCTCCAAACATGAAACCAAAATCCCC-3′). The product was cloned into vector pCR3.1-Topo, sequenced to ensure fidelity, released by EcoRI and XhoI digestion, and subcloned into plasmid pGEX-6.1 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) to create plasmid pGEX-HED7. HEDJ J domain-GST fusion protein (GST-tHEDJ) was purified from E. coli D5α by growing a 1-liter culture to anA 600 value of ∼0.6 and then inducing protein expression by the addition of isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside to 1 mm and incubating a further 2 h. Cells were pelleted by centrifugation, frozen at −20 °C, and then resuspended in 10 ml 1% Triton X-100 in PBS. Bacteria were lysed by sonication, and debris was removed by centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 15 min. The supernatant was applied to a 1-ml glutathione agarose column (GSTrap; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), which was then washed with 5 column volumes of binding buffer (100 mm KCl, 20 mm Tris, pH 7.0, 5 mm MgCl2) and eluted with binding buffer containing 20 mm reduced glutathione. 1-ml fractions were collected, and those containing pure fusion protein were combined and dialyzed against binding buffer. The Bip cDNA, excluding the signal peptide, was amplified from a Daudi (human Burkitt lymphoma) cell line by polymerase chain reaction using primers HED-10 (5′-CCAGGACTCGAGCGGGCCGAGGAGGAGGAC-3′) and HED-11 (5′-GGACCACTCGAGCTACAACTCATCTTTTTCTGC-3′). The product was ligated into vector pCR3.1-Topo/V5/His, released by XhoI digestion and subcloned into XhoI-digested plasmid pET-14b (Novagene), which placed Bip in-frame with an N-terminal His6 tag to create plasmid pET-Bip. Subsequently, nucleotide sequencing revealed a nucleotide substitution in the Bip cDNA, which resulted in substitution of proline for leucine at amino acid position 604. Nevertheless, we found that purified Bip bound the HEDJ J domain in an ATP-dependant fashion (see “Results”), indicating that the amino acid substitution did not interfere with the Bip-J domain interaction. His-tagged Bip was purified from a 1-liter culture of E. coli BL21 (DE3) harboring pET-Bip by growing to anA 600 value of ∼0.8 and then inducing protein expression by the addition of isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside to 1 mm and incubating a further 2 h. Bacteria were sedimented, washed with PBS, frozen at −20 °C, and then resuspended in PBS containing 1% Triton X-100. The cells were sonicated, debris was removed by centrifugation, and the supernatant was applied to a 1-ml Hi-Trap column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). After washing with 10 ml of PBS, proteins were eluted with a linear gradient of imidazole in PBS. Fractions containing Bip were identified by slot-blotting, pooled, and dialyzed against 20 mm Tris, pH 7.0. Binding assays were performed as described by Corsi and Schekman (17Corsi A.K. Schekman R. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 1483-1493Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) with modifications as follows. 50 μg of purified GST-HEDJ or GST were added to 50 μl of glutathione agarose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in a final volume of 500 μl of binding buffer. After 1 h at 4 °C the beads were sedimented, washed several times with ice-cold binding buffer, and then resuspended in 500 μl of binding buffer. Purified Bip (50 μg) was added to each sample in the presence or absence of 1 mm ATP. Following a 2-h incubation while rotating at 4 °C, the beads were sedimented and washed five times with 1 ml of binding buffer. GST-HEDJ, GST, and associated Bip were released by the addition of 100 μl of binding buffer containing 20 mm reduced glutathione. Laemmli buffer was added to the supernatant, and the samples were boiled and subjected to SDS-PAGE. Proteins were detected by Coomassie staining. To determine whether the HEDJ J domain was capable of stimulating the ATPase activity of Bip, in vitroassays were performed using GST fusion proteins and purified recombinant Bip. GST-HEDJ, GST, and recombinant Bip were purified as described above. Each protein was dialyzed overnight into ATPase assay buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 6.8, 50 mm NaCl, 2 mm MgCl2). Assays were performed essentially as described (17Corsi A.K. Schekman R. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 1483-1493Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), in a final volume of 100 μl consisting of ATPase buffer, to which was added KCl to 20 mm, 0.5 mCi of [α-32P]ATP, and 100 μm ATP. Reactions contained 1.0 μg of Bip (∼140 nm), and either no addition or 2.5 μg of GST or GST-HEDJ. Comparison was made with a reaction containing neither Bip or a GST containing protein. At each time point between 0 and 75 min, which was in the linear range, 5 μl was removed and spotted on a plastic backed polyethyleneimine-cellulose thin layer plate (Sigma). Radioactive ADP was separated from ATP by chromatography in 0.5 m formic acid in 0.5 mLiCl2. The plates were exposed for 1 h to x-ray film to identify the Rf and location of ADP. Individual spots were cut from the TLC plate, and the amount of radioactive ADP was determined in a scintillation counter. To demonstrate saturability of the ATPase stimulation of Bip, ATPase assays were repeated with varying concentrations of either GST-tHEDJ or GST in the presence or absence of Bip (0.5 μg for a final concentration of ∼70 nm). Reactions were incubated for 60 min at room temperature, and the quantity of ADP released was determined by TLC and scintillation counting as described above. TheV max was determined by correcting for the specific activity of [32P]ATP (220 cpm/pmol) and the final concentration of GST-tHEDJ in each reaction and then performing nonlinear regression analysis of the data using GraphPad Prism (version 2.0). A partial Vero cell cDNA was isolated in the process of a phenotypic cloning approach to identify genes involved in shiga toxin trafficking. When compared by BLAST with the GenBankTM data base there were no sequences that matched with high probability. However, when compared with the human EST data base, several matching sequences were identified. When the nucleotide sequence was translated into predicted peptide sequence using the first ATG as the start codon and compared with the SwissProt data base, at least 50 matching sequences were identified, all belonging to the DNAJ or Hsp40 family of co-chaperones. The role of this chaperone in shiga toxin pathogenesis is currently under study. Iterative BLAST searches were performed against the human EST data base to identify the entire HEDJ coding region and predicted stop codon. Based on the deduced cDNA sequence, primers were designed to allow amplification of approximately 150 base pairs of 5′-untranslated DNA and the entire coding region of HEDJ from human skeletal muscle cDNA. Nucleotide sequencing of the insert demonstrated that the HEDJ sequence matched that predicted from EST sequences (Fig.1 A). The cDNA encodes a peptide consisting of 358 amino acids, which demonstrate high homology to the Hsp40 (DNAJ) co-chaperones. Blast and tblastx searches were performed against the mouse EST, C. elegans, and Drosophila data bases. Highly homologous sequences were found in each (Fig. 1 B). NoSaccharomyces sequences matched with high probability. Like other Hsp40 chaperones, HEDJ contained a highly conserved region of 75 amino acids known as the J domain, which interact with Hsp70 partners to stimulate ATPase and folding activity. Additionally, HEDJ contained domains shared by many other Hsp40 molecules such as a glycine/phenylalanine-rich putative linker region, a cystine-rich domain, and a C-terminal domain, which in other Hsp40 molecules has been postulated to directly bind misfolded peptides (Fig.1 C). Unlike essentially all other known Hsp40 genes in higher eucaryotes, HEDJ contained a predicted signal peptide at the N terminus, suggesting that it is likely translocated into the endoplasmic reticulum.Figure 1Sequence analysis of a human HEDJ cDNA.

Hybridizing transcripts of 2.2 and 2.0 kilobases were found in all tissues examined, with relatively highest HEDJ expression found in the pancreas and testis and the least hybridization to RNA from thymus and small intestine (Fig. 2). The two bands likely represent alternately spliced HEDJ message, although the possibility of a highly related, cross-hybridizing message cannot be excluded. In all cases, hybridization with an β-actin probe confirmed approximately equal loading of RNA in each sample. As described previously, Hsp40 chaperones are involved in nearly all aspects of protein folding, secretion, and degradation. These activities have been intensively studied in yeast, where three Hsp40-like proteins have been identified within the ER; each apparently with overlapping but distinct activities. In contrast, in higher eucaryotes, the only J domain containing protein known to exist in the ER is Sec63. In this regard, we were particularly interested in determining whether HEDJ was localized to the ER, as was predicted by the presence of the signal peptide. Vero cells were transiently transfected with a cDNA encoding full-length HEDJ and a C-terminal V5 epitope and histidine tag. Confocal immunofluorescence microscopy was utilized to examine the intracellular localization of HEDJ. Cells were permeabilized and labeled with mouse anti-V5 and goat anti-calregulin (as a marker for endoplasmic reticulum) and then fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-mouse and Texas Red-conjugated anti-goat antibodies. As expected, all cells were labeled with anti-calregulin antibody in a perinuclear and lacy reticular pattern throughout the cell (Fig.3 A). Approximately 15% of cells were brightly labeled with the anti-V5 antibody in a pattern that was essentially identical to that of calregulin labeling. These results imply a transfection efficiency of approximately 15% and demonstrate that V5-tagged HEDJ is expressed in a similar distribution as calregulin. Control experiments were performed by omitting primary antibody or by substituting cells transfected with vector alone and demonstrated minimal background labeling (data not shown). We have been unable to raise antiserum in rabbits either to full-length recombinant HEDJ or to peptide antig"

The peripheral V1 domain is responsible for ATP hydrolysis and is coupled to the mechanism of proton translocation. The integral V0 domain is responsible for the translocation of protons across the membrane and is composed of five different polypeptides. Unlike the F0 domain of the F-type ATP synthase, which contains 12 copies of a single 8-kDa proteolipid, the V-ATPase V0 domain contains three proteolipid species, Vma3p, Vma11p, and Vma16p, with each proteolipid contributing to the mechanism of proton translocation (Hirata, R., Graham, L. A., Takatsuki, A., Stevens, T. H., and Anraku, Y. (1997) J. Biol. Chem. 272, 4795–4803). Experiments with hemagglutinin- and c-Myc epitope-tagged copies of the proteolipids revealed that each V0 complex contains all three species of proteolipid with only one copy each of Vma11p and Vma16p but multiple copies of Vma3p. Since the proteolipids of the V0 complex are predicted to possess four membrane-spanning α-helices, twice as many as a single F-ATPase proteolipid subunit, only six V-ATPase proteolipids would be required to form a hexameric ring-like structure similar to the F0 domain. Therefore, each V0complex will likely be composed of four copies of the Vma3p proteolipid in addition to Vma11p and Vma16p. Structural differences within the membrane-spanning domains of both V0 and F0 may account for the unique properties of the ATP-hydrolyzing V-ATPase compared with the ATP-generating F-type ATP synthase.

This family of ATP-driven proton pumps is located within the endomembrane systems of eukaryotic cells, where their primary function is the acidification of intracellular compartments. The pH gradient generated by the activity of the V-ATPase is utilized by secondary transporters to drive the transport of small molecules. The V-ATPase and the F-type ATP synthases share an overall similar structural organization (4Dschida W.J. Bowman B.J. J. Biol.

Both complexes contain a soluble catalytic domain (V1 and F1) that is coupled to a membrane-spanning domain (V0 and F0) by one or more “stalk” components (5Boekema E.J. Ubbink-Kok T. Lolkema J.S.

In the case of the F-ATP synthase the binding and hydrolysis of ATP by the catalytic domain induce rotation of a central stalk, which is fixed at one end to the membrane domain subunits (subunit c ring) (11Sabbert D. Engelbrecht S. Junge W. Nature. 1996; 381: 623-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar, 12Noji H. Yasuda R. Yoshida M. Kinoshita Jr., K.

Science. 1999; 286: 1722-1724Crossref PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar). It still remains unclear how rotation of this central stalk complex brings about proton translocation through the membrane domain. The membrane domain of the V-ATPase (V0) is composed of five different subunits involved in the mechanism of proton translocation. The principal components involved in proton translocation in both V-ATPases and F-ATP synthases are a highly conserved family of hydrophobic proteins. These are termed proteolipids due to their solubility in organic solvents. The V0 domain is composed of three members of the proteolipid family, VMA3(16.5-kDa; subunit c), VMA11 (17-kDa; subunitc′), and VMA16 (23-kDa; subunit c"") (1Anraku Y. Hirata R. Wada Y. Ohya Y. J. Exp. Biol. 1992; 172: 67-81Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The proteolipids of the V-ATPase (subunits c,c′, and c"") share a high degree of sequence similarity and are predicted to contain at least four α-helical transmembrane domains (14Nelson H. Nelson N. FEBS Lett. 1989; 247: 147-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 15Holzenburg A. Jones P.C. Franklin T. Pali T. Heimburg T. Marsh D. Findlay J.B. Finbow M.E. Eur. J.

Takatsuki A. Stevens T.H. Anraku Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4795-4803Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). The F0 domain of the Escherichia coli F-ATP synthase is composed of 12 copies of an 8-kDa proteolipid, forming two α-helical transmembrane domains, arranged in a ring-like structure (19Jones P.C. Jiang W. Fillingame R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17178-17185Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 20Girvin M.E. Rastogi V.K. Abildgaard F. Markley J.L. Fillingame R.H.

A. 1999; 96: 7785-7790Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Each F0 domain proteolipid possesses an acidic amino residue in the second helix that is critical for its role in proton translocation (22Miller M.J. Oldenburg M. Fillingame R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 4900-4904Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). It is thought that the V-ATPase proteolipids arose due to a gene duplication event from an ancestral 8-kDa progenitor gene, because the amino and carboxyl halves of the V-ATPase proteolipids are homologous to each other and to the 8-kDa proteolipid of the E. coli F-ATP synthase (14Nelson H. Nelson N. FEBS Lett. 1989; 247: 147-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 23Mandel M. Moriyama Y. Hulmes J.D. Pan Y.-C.E. Nelson H. Nelson N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

A fundamental difference between these proteolipids is that the larger V-ATPase proteolipids have lost one of the acidic residues from the amino-terminal half of the polypeptide (second helix). Within each of the V-ATPase proteolipids so far identified, this highly conserved acidic residue is located only within the extreme carboxyl-terminal transmembrane domain. Mutation of this conserved acidic residue results in a fully assembled complex that is unable to pump protons (18Hirata R. Graham L.A. Takatsuki A. Stevens T.H. Anraku Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4795-4803Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). This supports the critical role of this residue in the mechanism of proton translocation. In this paper we describe a biochemical approach designed to address the stoichiometry of Vma3p, Vma11p, and Vma16p proteolipids within the yeast V-ATPase enzyme complex. We have attached epitope tags (HA and c-Myc) to each of the proteolipid species. Immunoprecipitation and Western blot analysis has revealed that each V-ATPase V0domain is composed of all three proteolipid species, with only a single copy each of Vma11p and Vma16p and therefore multiple copies of the Vma3p proteolipid.

Open table in a new tab Whole cell extracts and vacuolar membranes were prepared as described previously (26Uchida E. Ohsumi Y. Anraku Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 1090-1095Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Before storage, vacuolar membrane vesicles were washed with 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA (TE7.5), and 2 mmdithiothreitol. Following washing, vacuolar membrane vesicles were stored at −80 °C in TE7.5 15% glycerol. SDS-PAGE analysis was performed using 12% polyacrylamide gels, and proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose. Immunoblots were probed with affinity-purified monoclonal anti-HA antibodies (Babco Inc. (Berkeley, CA)) at a dilution of 1:10,000 or affinity-purified polyclonal anti-c-Myc antibodies (Pierce) used at a dilution of 1:5000. Proteins were visualized using anti-mouse or anti-rabbit secondary antibodies conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (1:10,000 dilution) (Bio-Rad) and visualized using chemiluminescent substrate (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Protein concentration assays were performed using the bioinchoninic acid method according to the manufacturer's protocol. The proteolipids Vma3p, Vma11p, and Vma16p were each tagged at the carboxyl terminus with the 9-amino acid epitope (YPYDVPDYA) from influenza hemagglutinin (HA) as described previously (18Hirata R. Graham L.A. Takatsuki A. Stevens T.H. Anraku Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4795-4803Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Vma3p tagged at the carboxyl terminus with the 10-amino acid epitope of the human c-MYC gene product (EQKLISEEDL) was kindly provided by Dr. Ryogo Hirata. Vma3p-c-myc was constructed in a similar fashion to Vma3p-HA except the AatII-NheI fragment was replaced with the synthetic oligonucleotide (5′-gacgtcgtctgcgaacaaaaattaaattctgaagaagatctctagc-3′) introducing the tag immediately before the stop codon. Vma11p and Vma16p were also tagged with the c-Myc epitope at the extreme carboxyl terminus following the method of Kunkel (27Kunkel T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 488-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (4881) Google Scholar) using primers 5′-ttttaaacttttgactcacaagtcttcttcagaaataagcttttgttcttcagagcctc-3′ and 5′-tggtttgagcgcttacaagtcttcttcagaaataagcttttgttcctgaaattcagaagc-3′ respectively. The 4.6-kilobase SacI-XhoI fragment containing either the HA- or c-Myc epitope-tagged VMA3 gene from pRHA316 and pRHA318 was subcloned into the vector pBluescript (Stratagene (La Jolla CA)). The URA3 gene subcloned into the EagI site upstream of the VMA3 ORF was removed by digestion with PstI and SmaI and replaced with the gene encoding kanamycin resistance (Kanr from a KanMx plasmid, SpeI-PstI partial fragment, and blunted (28Wach A. Brachat A. Pohlmann R. Philippsen P. Yeast. 1994; 10: 1793-1808Crossref PubMed Scopus (2218) Google Scholar)), generating plasmids pLG69 and pLG68, respectively. Yeast strains containing an epitope-tagged copy of VMA3were generated by one-step gene replacement with the SacI-XhoI fragment from either pLG68 or pLG69 and selected for the ability to grow on rich (YEPD) media in the presence of 200 μg/ml G418 (geneticin sulfate, Life Technologies, Inc.). Yeast strains containing an epitope-tagged copy of VMA11 were generated by two-step gene replacement using MscI-linearized pLG40 or pLG64. Similarly, yeast strains containing an epitope-tagged copy of VMA16 were generated by two-step gene replacement using BglI-linearized pLG34 or pLG35. The resultant strains expressing epitope-tagged Vma3p-HA, Vma11p-HA, or Vma16p-HA were manipulated further by integrating into the genome a second epitope-tagged proteolipid at the URA3 locus usingStuI-linearized pRS306-derived plasmid also encoding a tagged proteolipid (pLG40, pLG64, pLG34, and pLG35). Isolated vacuolar membrane vesicles were washed 3 times with ice-cold TE7.5 buffer containing 10% glycerol, followed by centrifugation at 100,000 ×g. Membrane vesicles (pellets) were solubilized in PBS containing 1% C12E9 (Sigma) detergent and incubated on ice for 30 min (29Doherty R.D. Kane P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16845-16851Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Solubilized membranes were subsequently centrifuged at 100,000 × g to remove any insoluble material. Supernatants were transferred to fresh tubes and normalized to a total protein concentration of 5 mg/ml. Following the addition of 20 μl of a 50% slurry of protein A-Sepharose CL-4B beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) prepared in PBS + 1% C12E9, detergent samples were incubated at 4 °C with constant mixing for 1 h. After incubation the samples were centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. The pre-cleared supernatant was transferred to a fresh tube, and 5 μl of the affinity-purified monoclonal anti-HA antibody (Babco) was added and incubated at 4 °C for 2 h with constant mixing. 20 μl of a 50% slurry of protein A-Sepharose CL-4B was then added and incubated overnight at 4 °C with constant agitation. The protein A beads were collected by brief centrifugation and washed 6 times with 1 ml of cold PBS, followed by six washes with 1 ml of cold PBS + 1% C12E9. Pellets were resuspended in 150 μl of reducing SDS-PAGE sample buffer (5% β-mercaptoethanol), and 20 μl of the supernatant was loaded onto 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. To determine whether every V-ATPase complex contains copies of each of the three proteolipids, epitope tags (HA or c-Myc) were attached to the carboxyl terminus of each of the three proteolipid species, Vma3p, Vma11p, and Vma16p. Strains expressing integrated copies of HA and/or c-Myc forms of the various proteolipids grew as well as wild-type cells on YEPD media buffered to neutral pH. The stable expression of two different epitope-tagged proteolipids within each strain was determined by immunoblot analysis (Fig. 1, Aand B). Cell extracts were prepared from each of the strains expressing both HA- and c-Myc-tagged proteolipids and probed with anti-HA antibodies (Fig. 1 A) or anti-c-Myc antibodies (Fig.1 B). Comparing equivalent lanes in Fig. 1, A and B, it is evident that both HA- and c-Myc-tagged proteolipids were expressed in each strain. The next step was to demonstrate that each of the tagged proteolipids was present on the vacuolar membrane and incorporated into an active fully assembled V-ATPase complex. Vacuolar membrane vesicles were prepared from each of the yeast strains and solubilized in PBS containing 1% C12E9 detergent. Solubilized extracts were analyzed by immunoblotting for the presence of each of the tagged proteolipids using anti-HA (Fig. 1 C) and anti-c-Myc (Fig. 1 D) antibodies. Samples of equal total protein concentration were loaded onto the gels in order to determine the relative expression levels of each of the tagged proteolipids. All proteolipids were present on the vacuolar membrane and were found to exhibit a differential expression pattern, i.e. Vma3p, whether HA- or c-Myc-tagged proteolipid was present at a higher level than either Vma11p or Vma16p. From these data the exact molar ratio cannot be determined, but it is clear that there is more of Vma3p than Vma11p or Vma16p. We next examined whether all three proteolipids are part of the same complex and if each complex contains multiple copies of the proteolipids. Vacuolar membranes from each of the strains (BPY01-05) were solubilized with 1% C12E9 in PBS and used for a co-immunoprecipitation study. Following immunoprecipitation using monoclonal anti-HA antibodies, V1subunits were detected in the immunoprecipitate indicating an assembled complex (V1 + V0) was effectively immunoprecipitated from each of the constructed strains (data not shown). To determine the stoichiometry of proteolipids present in each complex, V-ATPase was immunoprecipitated using monoclonal anti-HA antibodies from solubilized vacuolar membranes prepared from yeast strain BPY02 expressing Vma3p-HA and Vma11p-c-myc. The immunoprecipitate and remaining supernatants were probed with both anti-HA and anti-c-Myc antibodies in order to determine whether a c-Myc-tagged copy of Vma11p was co-immunoprecipitated with Vma3p-HA (Fig.2). Both Vma3p-HA-tagged proteolipid as well as >85% of the Vma11p-c-myc epitope-tagged proteolipid was detected in the immunoprecipitate (Fig. 2, A and C, lane 2, relative to Fig. 2, B and D, lane 2). The fact that both proteolipids can be immunoprecipitated with anti-HA antibody demonstrates that each enzyme complex must contain copies of both Vma3p-HA and Vma11p-c-myc-tagged proteolipids. The V-ATPase complex was also immunoprecipitated out of a strain (BPY04) that expressed copies of both Vma3p-HA and Vma16p-c-myc proteolipids. Following immunoprecipitation using anti-HA antibodies, both Vma3p-HA and Vma16p-c-myc were present in the immunoprecipitate, as demonstrated by lane 4 in Fig. 2, A and C. Analysis of the immunoprecipitate and supernatants revealed that Vma3p-HA was efficiently precipitated (>80%; Fig. 2,A and B, lane 4) and that Vma16p-c-myc was efficiently co-immunoprecipitated (>90%; Fig. 2, C and D, lane 4). Immunoprecipitation of HA-tagged Vma3p from strains expressing either c-Myc-tagged copies of Vma11p or Vma16p resulted in co-immunoprecipitation of both forms (Vma3p + Vma11p and Vma3p + Vma16p) of the tagged proteolipids. Therefore, each V-ATPase complex must contain copies of all three proteolipids, consistent with the genetic results that all three proteolipids are essential for function (18Hirata R. Graham L.A. Takatsuki A. Stevens T.H. Anraku Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4795-4803Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar, 30Umemoto N. Ohya Y. Anraku Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 24526-24532Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In order to determine whether each V-ATPase complex contains more than one copy of either Vma3p, Vma11p or Vma16p, we immunoprecipitated the complex from cells expressing two epitope-tagged copies of the same proteolipid (e.g. Vma3p-HA and Vma3p-c-myc). Isolated vacuolar membranes were solubilized, and the V-ATPase was immunoprecipitated with monoclonal anti-HA antibodies. Polyclonal anti-c-Myc antibodies were then used to monitor by immunoblot analysis whether the complex also contains a second c-Myc-tagged copy of the same proteolipid. The solubilized V-ATPase complex isolated from cells expressing copies of both Vma11p-HA and Vma11p-c-myc (BPY03) was immunoprecipitated with anti-HA antibodies, and ∼100% of Vma11p-HA was immunoprecipitated (Fig. 2, A and B, lane 3). Vma11p-c-myc was not detected in the immunoprecipitate when samples were probed using polyclonal anti-c-Myc antibodies (Fig. 2 C, lane 3). However, Vma11p-c-myc was present in the cells and detected in the supernatant (Fig. 2 D, lane 3). These data indicate that only a single copy of Vma11p is incorporated into each V-ATPase complex. The same results were observed when the V-ATPase complex was immunoprecipitated from solubilized vacuolar membranes isolated from the yeast strain BPY05, expressing copies of both Vma16p-HA and Vma16p-c-myc. By comparing Fig. 2, A and C, lane 5, it is clear that immunoprecipitation of Vma16p-HA did not co-immunoprecipitate Vma16p-c-myc, since no Vma16p-c-myc was detected in the immunoprecipitate using anti c-Myc antibodies. However, Vma16p-c-myc was present in the supernatant (Fig. 2 D, lane 5). These data indicate that only a single copy of the proteolipid Vma16p is incorporated into the yeast V-ATPase complex. Immunoprecipitation of the V-ATPase complex from solubilized vacuolar membranes isolated from the strain BPY01, expressing both Vma3p-HA and Vma3p-c-myc, demonstrates that every V-ATPase complex contains multiple copies of Vma3p. Following immunoprecipitation using monoclonal anti-HA antibodies, Vma3p-HA was detected in the immunoprecipitate (Fig. 2 A, lane 1). By using polyclonal anti-c-Myc antibodies, Vma3p-c-myc was also detected in the immunoprecipitate, indicating that both epitope-tagged copies of the proteolipid are present within each V-ATPase complex. The same results were also observed when anti-c-Myc antibodies were used to immunoprecipitate the complex (data not shown). We observed that the expression of both epitope-tagged forms of the same proteolipid are similar at the protein level as demonstrated in Fig. 1, indicating that either copy could be inserted into the V-ATPase complex with equal probability. If multiple copies of Vma11p and Vma16p were present per complex, then both tagged versions of the same proteolipid would have been detected in the immunoprecipitate. The data obtained clearly demonstrate that the V-ATPase complex contains only a single copy of both Vma11p and Vma16p and multiple copies of Vma3p. Both the V-ATPases and F-ATP synthases share an overall similar structural organization (4Dschida W.J. Bowman B.J. J. Biol.

FEBS Lett. 2000; 470: 244-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). A striking difference between these two complexes is the presence of three different species of proteolipid within the V0 domain compared with a single proteolipid species within F0. The yeast V-ATPase requires all three proteolipid species to assemble and function correctly, since the loss of any one proteolipid or mutation of any one of the single conserved acidic residues results in a complete loss of V-ATPase activity (18Hirata R. Graham L.A. Takatsuki A. Stevens T.H. Anraku Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4795-4803Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). In this paper we have demonstrated that each V-ATPase complex contains only a single copy of both Vma11p and Vma16p but multiple copies of Vma3p. The data clearly demonstrate that immunoprecipitation of Vma11p-HA or Vma16p-HA from solubilized vacuolar membranes does not co-immunoprecipitate Vma11p-c-myc or Vma16p-c-myc from cells expressing both tagged copies of the same proteolipid. Therefore, each complex must contain only a single copy of both Vma11p and Vma16p. However, when any one of the proteolipids is expressed in the same cells as Vma3p-HA, either Vma3p-c-myc, Vma11p-c-myc, or Vma16p-c-myc can be co-immunoprecipitated from solubilized vacuolar membranes demonstrating the presence of all three proteolipids within each complex. Complexes composed of only Vma3p-Vma11p, Vma3p-Vma16p, or any single proteolipid can be ruled out, as the loss of any one of the proteolipid genes results in a complete loss of V-ATPase function in yeast (1Anraku Y. Hirata R. Wada Y. Ohya Y. J. Exp. Biol. 1992; 172: 67-81Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Our data indicate that each V0 domain contains only a single copy of Vma11p (c′) and Vma16p (c""). However, the exact number of Vma3p (c) subunits per V0 domain remains uncertain. The data of Arai et al. (33Arai H. Terres G. Pink S. Forgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 8796-8802Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) indicate ∼5.5 copies of a 16-kDa hydrophobic species (presumably c plus c′) and ∼0.85 copies of a 19-kDa hydrophobic polypeptide (possibly c"") per V0 domain for the bovine V-ATPase. Unfortunately, these data cannot distinguish between a stoichiometry of c 4 c′c"" (6 proteolipids/V0) and c 5 c′c"" (7 proteolipids/V0) for the V0 domain. Whereas a V0 domain stoichiometry of c 4 c′c"" seems most likely for a number of reasons (see below), further studies will be required to define unambiguously the overall proteolipid stoichiometry as well as the structure of the V0 domain. Recently it has been demonstrated that the F0 domain of the E. coli F-ATP synthase is composed of 12 copies of a single 8-kDa subunit c arranged in a ring-like complex comprising 24 transmembrane α-helices (34Jones P.C. Fillingame R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29701-29705Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Since both the F-ATP synthase and V-ATPases share a similar architectural plan and are likely to operate through a similar mechanism, our model is that the V0domain will be composed of a total of six proteolipid subunits (four copies of Vma3p and one each of Vma11p and Vma16p) also contributing 24 transmembrane α-helices. The fact that the V0 domain contains three proteolipid species unlike the F0 domain may help explain some of the functional differences observed between these two enzymes. An important difference between these two complexes concerns the number of buried acidic residues in the V0/F0 domain, which presumably explains the different in vivo functions of the enzymes, hydrolysisversus synthesis of ATP (35Cross R.L. Taiz L. FEBS Lett. 1990; 259: 227-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The V0 domain contains half the number of buried acidic residues compared with the F0 domain and would account for the difference in H+/ATP stoichiometry between the two complexes. The E. coli F-ATP synthase has been shown to rotate in discrete 120° steps per ATP hydrolyzed, presenting four protonated proteolipids to subunit a per step (12Noji H. Yasuda R. Yoshida M. Kinoshita Jr., K. Nature. 1997; 386: 299-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (1925) Google Scholar). Therefore, the F-ATPase has a H+/ATP stoichiometry of 4, whereas according to the same model the V-ATPase would have a H+/ATP stoichiometry of 2. Vma3p- and Vma11p-like proteolipids have been identified in a number of species including S. cerevisiae (14Nelson H. Nelson N.

However, to date only a single gene encoding a subunit c-like proteolipid has been identified in mouse (40Hanada H. Hasebe M. Moriyama Y. Maeda M. Futai M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 176: 1062-1067Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) and humans (41Hasebe M. Hanada H. Moriyama Y. Maeda M. Futai M. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Biol. 2000; 203: 107-116Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Comparing the sequence identities of both the mouse and human subunit c against Vma3p (c)- and Vma11p (c′)-like proteins, identified in S. cerevisiae, S. pombe, C. elegans, and D. melanogaster, suggests that both human and mouse forms of subunit c are more closely related to Vma3p than Vma11p. The human form of Vma3p (h-16.5 kDa) is 63% identical to S. cerevisiae Vma3p and 58% identical to S. cerevisiae Vma11p. The mouse Vma3p (m-16.5 kDa) is 68% identical to S. cerevisiae Vma3p and also 58% identical to S. cerevisiae Vma11p (Table II). Based on the presence of Vma11p (c′) homologues in S. cerevisiae, C. elegans, and D. melanogaster, we predict that further investigation will reveal Vma11p (c′) homologues in the mouse and human genomes.Table IIIComparison of amino acid identity of proteolipid isoforms between different speciesVma3p proteolipidsm16.5 kDah16.5 kDaCe16.5 kDaDm16.5 kDaSp16.5 kDaSc16.5 kDaM. musculus (m)1009183737168H. sapiens (h)10078726463C. elegans (Ce)100726868D. melanogaster (Dm)1007962S. pombe (Sp)10062S. cerevisiae (Sc)100Vma11p proteolipidsCe17 kDaDm17 kDaSp17 kDaSc17 kDaC. elegans (Ce)100594649D. melanogaster (Dm)1006260S. pombe (Sp)10059S. cerevisiae(Sc)100Vma16p proteolipidsh22 kDaCe22 kDaSp22 kDaSc22 kDaH. sapiens (h)100644847C. elegans (Ce)1004352S. pombe (Sp)10056S. cerevisiae(Sc)100Proteolipid amino acid sequences were aligned using the ClustalW program, and pairwise sequence identity was compared between species for each of the three-proteolipid species.

Cell. 1986; 47: 1041-1051Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). The yeast subunit Vma16p sequence shares 56% identity with the S. pombe sequence and 47% identity with the human Vma16p (Table III). The C. elegans Vma16p shares 64% sequence identity with the human Vma16p and 52% identity with S. cerevisiae Vma16p. In addition, the mouse Vma16p2 is reported to share 96% identity with the human homologue, illustrating the highly conserved nature of this proteolipid between species. Vma16p is larger than Vma3p or Vma11p and may form five transmembrane domains due to a 50-amino acid extension at its amino terminus. This first membrane-spanning helix of Vma16p (shown in Fig. 3 B) may fill a portion of the space at the center of the proteolipid ring. Comparing the sequences of all Vma16p proteolipids identified to date has revealed that all Vma16p-like proteolipids contain two buried conserved acidic residues within transmembrane regions. These are located within putative helices 3 and 5 (Fig. 3 B), assuming five transmembrane helices. However, in yeast only the acidic residue located within the third transmembrane domain is required for V-ATPase activity and function (18Hirata R. Graham L.A. Takatsuki A. Stevens T.H. Anraku Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4795-4803Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Thus, the V0 domain can be modeled as a hexamer with four copies of Vma3p and a single copy of each of Vma11p and Vma16p (Fig. 3 B). Structural difference within the membrane domain proteolipid components of the V-ATPase and F-ATPase complexes is one explanation for the unique properties of these two complexes. The fact that the V-ATPase functions in vivo to hydrolyze ATP may be primarily due to the presence of three essential but different proteolipid species all operating co-operatively within each V-ATPase complex. We thank Dr. Kate Bowers and members of the Capaldi laboratory for critical reading of the manuscript and extremely helpful suggestions. We also thank Dr. Ryogo Hirata for providing the c-Myc-tagged VMA3and Dr. Phil Jones for sharing his insights (personal communication) regarding the unique role of Vma16p in V-ATPase proton translocation."

Consistent with previous studies, cicaprost abrogated U46619-mediated platelet aggregation and mobilization of intracellular calcium ([Ca2+]i). In HEK 293 cells, signaling by TPα, but not TPβ, was subject to IP-mediated desensitization in a protein kinase A-dependent, protein kinase C-independent manner. Desensitization of TPα signaling was independent of the nature of the IP agonist used, the level of IP expression, or the subtype of Gq protein. Signaling by TPΔ328, a truncated variant of TP devoid of the divergent residues of the TPs, or by TPαS329A, a site-directed mutant of TPα, were insensitive to IP agonist activation. Whole cell phosphorylations established that TPα, but not TPβ or TPαS329A, is subject to IP-mediated phosphorylation and that TPα phosphorylation is inhibited by H-89. Thus, we conclude that TPα, but not TPβ, is subject to cross-desensitization by IP mediated through direct protein kinase A phosphorylation at Ser329 and propose that TPα may be the isoform physiologically relevant to TP:IP-mediated vascular hemostasis.

TXA2, which is synthesized mainly by platelets, mediates platelet shape change and aggregation and constriction of vascular and bronchial smooth muscle, whereas prostacyclin, which is synthesized mainly by the vascular endothelium, is a potent inhibitor of platelet aggregation and induces vasodilation (2.O'Mahony D.J.

Perturbations in the levels of TXA2 or prostacyclin, or their synthases or receptors, have been implicated in various cardiovascular disorders (4.Oates J.A. FitzGerald G.A. Branch R.A. Jackson E.K.

However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the counter-regulation of TXA2 and prostacyclin signaling are poorly understood. Both TXA2 and prostacyclin exert intracellular effects by interaction with specific members of the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family, termed TP and IP, respectively (9.$$$$$$ ref data missingGoogle Scholar, 10.Coleman R.A. Smith W.L. Narumiya S. Pharmacol. Rev. 1994; 46: 205-229PubMed Google Scholar). There are two isoforms of TP in humans, termed TPα and TPβ, as recommended by the International Union of Pharmacology classification on prostanoid receptors (11.Hirata M. Hayashi Y. Ushikubi F.

These receptors, which are identical for their first 328 amino acids and differ exclusively in their carboxyl-terminal cytoplasmic tail (C-tail) regions, arise due to alternative splicing in exon 3 of the TP gene (12.Raychowdhury M.K.

Wide cell and tissue distribution of the mRNA for both TP isoforms was recently confirmed by selective reverse transcription-PCR procedures (14.Miggin S.M. Kinsella B.T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1425: 543-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Isoform specific antibodies permitted detection of TPα, but not TPβ, in human platelets, leading to the suggestion that TPα may be the predominant isoform in platelets (15.Habib A. FitzGerald G.A. Maclouf J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2645-2651Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar), despite the presence of mRNA for both isoforms in platelets (16.Hirata T. Ushikubi F. Kakizuka A. Okuma M. Narumiya S. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 97: 949-956Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). The major signaling pathway used by TP in vivo is G protein-dependent stimulation of the β-isoforms of phospholipase C (PLCβ), resulting in increased intracellular concentrations of diacylglycerol and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) and mobilization of intracellular calcium ([Ca2+]i) (17.Brass L.F.

It was recently demonstrated that the cloned TPα can functionally couple to both Gq and G11 following stimulation with the selective TXA2 mimetic U46619 and the isoprostane 8-epi-prostaglandin F2α to mobilize [Ca2+]i (26.Kinsella B.T. O'Mahony D.J. Fitzgerald G.A. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1997; 281 (564): 957PubMed Google Scholar). Coupling to G11 was more efficient than that to Gq. Both TP isoforms couple similarly to G11 in stably transfected HEK 293 cells (27.Walsh M.T. Foley J.F. Kinsella B.T. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1998; 286: 1026-1036PubMed Google Scholar) but oppositely regulate adenylyl cyclase activity in transfected Chinese hamster ovary cells (16.Hirata T. Ushikubi F. Kakizuka A. Okuma M.

Moreover, Gh, the novel high molecular weight G protein that may also function as a transglutaminase (28.Nakaoka H. Perez D.M. Baek K.J. Das T. Husain A. Misono K. Im M.J. Graham R.M.

Habib A. FitzGerald G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12774-12779Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). A single receptor, termed IP, appears to mediate the actions of prostacyclin leading to activation of adenylyl cyclase via Gs and elevation of intracellular cAMP (33.Boie Y. Rushmore T.H.

Marder V.J. Salzman E.W. Hirsh J. Hemostasis and Thrombosis: Basic Principles and Clinical Practice. 3rd Ed. Lippincott, Philadelphia1994Google Scholar). However, IP may also couple to multiple G protein/effector systems including phosphoinositide turnover via a pertussis toxin insensitive G protein (35.Namba T. Oida H. Sugimoto Y. Kakizuka A.

In human erythroleukemia cells, IP has even been proposed to differentially couple to both Gs and Gi (37.Schwaner I. Offermanns S. Spicher K. Seifert R. Schultz G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1265: 8-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Iloprost, a stable carbacyclin analogue of prostacyclin, can stimulate opening of ATP-sensitive K+ channels, leading to hyperpolarization and relaxation of canine carotid artery (38.Siegel G. Carl A. Adler A. Stock G. Eicosanoids. 1989; 2: 213-222PubMed Google Scholar). IP is unique among the family of GPCRs in that it undergoes posttranslational modification by carbon-15 farnesyl isoprene groups (39.Hayes J.S. Lawler O.A. Walsh M.-T. Kinsella B.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23707-23718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). This isoprenylation is absolutely required for receptor activation of adenylyl cyclase via GS and for efficient coupling to PLC via Gq or G11 (39.Hayes J.S. Lawler O.A. Walsh M.-T. Kinsella B.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23707-23718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). A commonly observed phenomenon among GPCRs is desensitization, defined as reduced receptor responsiveness to repeated agonist challenge (40.Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18677-18680Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (908) Google Scholar). GPCR desensitization consists of two key mechanisms, namely phosphorylation of the receptor by specific serine/threonine kinases and sequestration or internalization of receptors to intracellular vesicles where they are unavailable for interaction with G proteins. GPCRs can be subject to either homologous (41.Krupnick J.G. Benovic J.L. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1998; 38: 289-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (858) Google Scholar, 42.Chuang T.T. Lacovelli L.

Chem. 1991; 266: 2233-2238Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) desensitization, mediated via phosphorylation by G protein-coupled receptor kinases or the second messenger-activated protein kinases, including cAMP-dependent PKA and PKC. Such desensitizations provide mechanisms for feedback regulatory loops following receptor activation and signaling and also for cross-talk between different second messenger systems (43.Selbie L.A. Hill J. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1998; 19: 87-93Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). TPα may be phosphorylated in vitro, in the third extracellular loop and the C-tail, by both PKA and PKC (48.Kinsella B.T. O'Mahony D.J. FitzGerald G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29914-29919Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Differences in the complement and distribution of serine (Ser) and threonine (Thr) residues within the divergent C-tails of TPα and TPβ could affect their sensitivity to phosphorylation. Both TPs may be phosphorylated in response to stimulation with the TXA2 mimetic U46619 in transfected HEK 293 cells (49.Habib A. Vezza R. Creminon C. Maclouf J. FitzGerald G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7191-7200Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), and recent studies indicate that TPβ but not TPα undergoes agonist induced internalization (50.Parent J.-L. Labrecrue P. Orsini M.J. Benovic J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8941-8948Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Like TP, IP is sensitive to desensitization by second messenger kinases following stimulation with the IP agonist iloprost, with a single PKC phosphorylation site being critical for its desensitization (51.Smyth E.M. Nestor P.V. FitzGerald G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 33698-33704Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar,36.Smyth E.M. Li W.H. FitzGerald G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23258-23266Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Thus, both TP and IP are potentially vulnerable to “heterologous desensitization” by elements of intracellular cascades induced by activation of other receptors; for example, the IP:adenylyl cyclase system is essential to the control of platelet responses and may be manifested at different levels of the signaling system (52.Murray R. Shipp E. Fitzgerald G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 21670-21675Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Indeed, cross-talk occurs between TP and IP in human platelets, with prior U46619 stimulation enhancing iloprost-mediated generation of cAMP (52.Murray R. Shipp E. Fitzgerald G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 21670-21675Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Similarly, in the megakaryoblastic cell line MEG-01, TXA2mimetics U46619 and STA2 dose-dependently augment subsequent iloprost-induced cAMP formation in a PKC-dependent manner (53.Watanabe T. Sunaga S. Togo M. Satoh H. Higashihara M. Hashimoto Y. Kurokawa K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1304: 161-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). In view of the interplay between TXA2 and prostacyclin in the maintenance of vascular homeostasis, we considered the potential influence that the intracellular signaling processes induced by IP may have on TP function. In particular, we examined the effect that the selective, high affinity IP agonists cicaprost and iloprost exhibited on U46619-mediated TP responses in platelets. More specifically, we investigated whether cross-talk between IP and TP signaling exists and considered whether such cross-talk may have differential impacts on signaling by the individual TPα and TPβ isoforms. Our results indicate that TPα, but not TPβ, appears to be a direct target for cross-talk between IP: TP responses. Furthermore, H-89, a selective inhibitor of PKA (54.Geilen C.C. Wieprecht M. Wieder T. Reutter W. Fukushi Y. FEBS Lett. 1992; 309: 381-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 55.Findik D. Song Q. Hidaka H. Lavin M.J. Cell. Biochem. 1995; 57: 12-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), but not the PKC inhibitor GF 109203X (56.Toullec D. Pianetti P. Coste H. Bellevergue P. Grand-Perret T. Ajakane M. Baudet V. Boissin P. Boursier E. Loriolle F. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15771-15781Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), reduced IP-mediated desensitization of TPα and platelet TP(s), whereas TPβ was insensitive to this desensitization pathway. Prior exposure of HEK.TPΔ328 cells, stably overexpressing a variant of TP truncated at amino acid 328 at the point of divergence of TPα and TPβ, to cicaprost or iloprost did not affect subsequent U46619-mediated TP signaling, implying that the C-tail region is a crucial determinant of heterologous desensitization of TPα by IP-mediated signaling. TPα and TPβ are predicted to contain 9 and 10 putative PKA sites, respectively; however, 8 are conserved between both isoforms, and thus, TPα and TPβ contain 1 and 2 putative PKA sites, respectively, within their unique C-tail sequences. Thus, TPα is predicted to contain a unique PKA consensus site within its divergent C-tail, where Ser329 represents the putative target residue for phosphorylation. U46619-mediated [Ca2+]i mobilization by HEK.TPαS329A cells stably overexpressing a site-directed mutant of TPα was insensitive to IP (cicaprost or iloprost)-mediated desensitization, confirming that Ser329 is a target for IP-mediated desensitization. Finally, whole cell phosphorylation assays established that TPα, but not TPβ or TPαS329A, is subject to IP-mediated phosphorylation and that phosphorylation of TPα is abrogated in the presence of H-89. Thus, taken together, our results establish that TPα, but not TPβ, is subject to cross-desensitization by IP that is mediated through direct PKA phosphorylation of Ser329 and therefore imply that TPα may be the isoform physiologically relevant to the maintenance of vascular hemostasis.

Deletion of the amino acids carboxyl to Arg328, at the point of divergence between TPα and TPβ was achieved by conversion of Ser codon 329 to a stop codon (Ser329 TCG to stop329 TAA). Site-directed mutagenesis was performed by PCR mutagenesis using pCMV:TXR as template and oligonucleotides 5′-CTCTAAGCTTATG TGG CCC AAC GGC AGT-3′ (sense primer; nucleotides +1 to +18 of TP sequences are underlined) and 5′-CTCTGGATCC TTA TCTGGGCCGGGTGCTGAG-3′ (antisense primer; sequences complementary to nucleotides + 967 to +984 of TP sequences are underlined, and the mutator in-frame stop codon is in boldface italics). The resulting PCR-amplified cDNA was subcloned into the HindIII-BamHI site of pcDNA3 (Invitrogen) to generate pcDNA3:TPΔ328.

PCR amplifications were performed using Expand High Fidelity®Taq DNA polymerase, and products were subcloned into theHindIII site of pHM6 to generate pHM:TPαS329A. The plasmids pcDNA3:TPΔ328 and pHM:TPαS329A were verified by double-stranded DNA sequencing using Sequenase Version 2.0 (United States Biochemical Corp.). The plasmids pCMV:Gα11, pCMV:Gαq, and pcDNA3:mIP, coding for Gα11, Gαq, and mouse prostacyclin receptor (IP), respectively, have been described previously (26.Kinsella B.T. O'Mahony D.J.

Human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection and were grown in minimal essential medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum. Cells were transfected with 10 μg of pADVA (58.Gorman C.M. Gies D.R. McCray G. DNA Protein Eng. Tech. 1990; 2: 3-10Google Scholar) and 25 μg of pCMV-, pcDNA-, or pHM-based vectors using the calcium phosphate/DNA co-precipitation procedure (26.Kinsella B.T. O'Mahony D.J. Fitzgerald G.A. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1997; 281 (564): 957PubMed Google Scholar). For transient transfections, cells were harvested 48 h after transfection. To create stable cell lines, HEK 293 cells were transfected with 10 μg ofScaI-linearized pADVA plus 25 μg ofPvuI-linearized pcDNA- or pHM-based vectors. Forty-eight hours posttransfection, G418 (0.8 mg/ml) was added; after approximately 21 days, resistant colonies were selected, and clonal cell lines were expanded. In this way, HEK.TPΔ328(pcDNA3:TPΔ328), HEK.HATPα (pHM:TPα), HEK.HATPβ (pHM:TPβ), and HEK.HATPαS329A(pHM:TPαS329A) stable cell lines were established using their respective plasmids (in parentheses). HEK.α1 and HEK.β3 stable cell lines overexpressing TPα and TPβ, respectively, have been described (27.Walsh M.T. Foley J.F. Kinsella B.T. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1998; 286: 1026-1036PubMed Google Scholar). The HEK.α10 cell line, which was established under identical conditions as HEK.α1 cells and expresses similar levels of TPα (K d = 5.56 ± 0.98 nm; B max 3.38 ± 0.08 pmol/mg of cell protein) and HEK.β3 cells (K d = 8.44 ± 1.44 nm; B max 3.24 ± 0.33 pmol/mg of cell protein), was used in this study. Blood was drawn via venipuncture from normal human volunteers, who had not taken any medication for at least 10 days, into syringes containing indomethacin (10 μm) and 3.8% sodium citrate (9:1 v/v) (final concentration, 0.38% sodium citrate). The blood was centrifuged for 10 min at 160 × g; and the platelet-rich plasma was removed and recentrifuged for 10 min at 160 × g to remove contaminating red blood cells. Where necessary, platelet-poor plasma was prepared by spinning the remaining blood at 900 ×g for 15 min. For aggregation studies, platelets in platelet-rich plasma were diluted to approximately 108platelets/ml in platelet-poor plasma; 0.5-ml aliquots were preincubated at 37 °C for 2 min before addition of the aggregating agent (1 μm U46619, 1 μm cicaprost) or vehicle, and the extent of aggregation was monitored by light transmission in a Biodata Pap 4 aggregometer. TXB2 formation was routinely measured in platelet-rich plasma and platelet-poor plasma by enzyme immunoassay using a thromboxane B2 EIA kit (Cayman Chemical Co.). Measurements of intracellular calcium either in transfected HEK 293 cells or in platelets were made by monitoring the intensity of Fura2 fluorescence as described previously (26.Kinsella B.T. O'Mahony D.J. Fitzgerald G.A. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1997; 281 (564): 957PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were stimulated with 1 μm U46619, 1 μm cicaprost, 1 μm iloprost unless otherwise specified. The PKA inhibitor H-89 or PKC inhibitor GF 109203X was added at times and concentrations specified in the figure legends. In all cases, the drug (agonists/kinase inhibitors in ethanol or DMSO) was diluted 1:1000 in vehicle (modified Ca2+/Mg2+-free Hank's buffered salt solution, containing 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.67, 0.1% bovine serum albumin) for HEK 293 cells and platelet resuspension buffer (10 mm HEPES, 145 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 5.5 mm glucose, pH 7.4) for platelets, and 20 μl of the vehicle (containing an equivalent volume of the drug solvent) or drug in vehicle was added to 2 ml of cells; the vehicle had no effect on [Ca2+]i mobilization by either TP isoform and had no effect on experimental data. The ratio of the fluorescence at 340 nm to that at 380 nm is a measure of [Ca2+]i (59.Grynkiewicz G. Poenie M. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3440-3450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), assuming a K d of 225 nm Ca2+for Fura2/AM. The results presented in the figures are representative data from at least four independent experiments and are plotted as changes in intracellular Ca2+ mobilized as a function of time upon ligand stimulation. TP radioligand binding assays were carried out at 30 °C for 30 min in 100-μl reactions in the presence of 0–40 nm [3H]SQ29,548 for Scatchard analyses or in the presence of 20 nm[3H]SQ29,548 for saturation radioligand binding experiments (26.Kinsella B.T. O'Mahony D.J. Fitzgerald G.A. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1997; 281 (564): 957PubMed Google Scholar). IP radioligand binding assays were carried out on nonfractionated HEK 293 cells, as described previously (39.Hayes J.S. Lawler O.A. Walsh M.-T. Kinsella B.T. J. Biol.

Although it has been implicated in mediating apoptosis and growth factor signaling, its role in regulating cell growth is not yet clear. Here, the influence of JNK on basal (unstimulated) growth of human tumor glioblastoma T98G cells was investigated using highly specific JNK antisense oligonucleotides to inhibitJNK expression. Transient depletion of either JNK1 or JNK2 suppressed cell growth associated with an inhibition of DNA synthesis and cell cycle arrest in S phase. The growth-inhibitory potency of JNK2 antisense (JNK2 IC50 = 0.14 μm) was greater than that of JNK1 antisense (JNK1 IC50 = 0.37 μm), suggesting that JNK2 plays a dominant role in regulating growth of T98G cells. Indeed, JNK2 antisense-treated populations exhibited greater inhibition of DNA synthesis and accumulation of S-phase cells than did the JNK1 antisense-treated cultures, with a significant proportion of these cells detaching from the tissue culture plate. JNK2 (but not JNK1) antisense-treated cultures exhibited marked elevation in the expression of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21cip1/waf1 accompanied by inhibition of Cdk2/Cdc2 kinase activities. Taken together, these results indicate that JNK is required for growth of T98G cells in nonstress conditions and that p21cip1/waf1 may contribute to the sustained growth arrest of JNK2-depleted T98G cultures.

Indeed, JNK2 antisense-treated populations exhibited greater inhibition of DNA synthesis and accumulation of S-phase cells than did the JNK1 antisense-treated cultures, with a significant proportion of these cells detaching from the tissue culture plate. JNK2 (but not JNK1) antisense-treated cultures exhibited marked elevation in the expression of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21cip1/waf1 accompanied by inhibition of Cdk2/Cdc2 kinase activities. Taken together, these results indicate that JNK is required for growth of T98G cells in nonstress conditions and that p21cip1/waf1 may contribute to the sustained growth arrest of JNK2-depleted T98G cultures. c-Jun N-terminal kinase stress-activated protein kinase JNK antisense oligonucleotides antisense oligonucleotides targeting expression of JNK1or JNK2, respectively 4′-6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (3-(4, 5′-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxylphenyl-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium inner salt propidium iodide ultraviolet light C band The c-Jun N-terminal kinase/stress-activated protein kinase (JNK/SAPK)1 signal transduction pathway consists of a cascade of protein phosphorylation reactions leading to the activation of JNK. Numerous proinflammatory factors and other stressful stimuli activate JNK by dual-specificity kinases (JNK kinases), which are in turn activated via phosphorylation by upstream kinases (1Ip Y.T.

The function of the JNK pathway has mostly been studied within the context of cellular stress, where its activation causes both stabilization and elevated activity of targeted transcription factors via their phosphorylation by JNK (1Ip Y.T.

Much less is known about the role of JNK in normally growing cells, but recent studies suggest that nonactivated JNK is important for regulating degradation of its substrates (4Fuchs S.Y. Fried V. Ronai Z. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 1483-1490Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Three different JNK genes, designated JNK1,JNK2, and JNK3, have been described.JNK1 and JNK2 are ubiquitously expressed, whileJNK3 is largely restricted to brain, heart, and testis. Each of the JNK genes produces several isoforms derived from alternative splicing, but the functional significance of the different isoforms is unclear. JNK1 and JNK2 display distinct substrate affinities (10Gupta S. Barrett T. Whitmarsh A.J. Cavanagh J. Sluss K.H. Dérijard B. Davis R.J.

For example, JNK1 plays a role in the production of neurite-like structures in PC12 cells (16Yao R. Yoshihara M. Osada H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18261-18266Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), while JNK2 has been implicated in regulating expression of E-selectin (17Xu X.S. Vanderziel C.

Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 205-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (1381) Google Scholar, 2Karin M. Liu Z.G. Zandi E. Curr. Opin.

For instance, a rapid increase in JNK activity is required for apoptosis in cells of neuronal origin following withdrawal of nerve growth factor (21Xia Z. Dickens M. Raingeaud J. Davis R.J. Greenberg M.E. Science. 1995; 270: 1326-1331Crossref PubMed Scopus (5034) Google Scholar), but in other instances, such as following tumor nectosis factor-α treatment, JNK activation appears to inhibit apoptosis (22Lee S.Y.

Several lines of evidence suggest that the JNK pathway may play a role in cellular transformation and tumor cell growth. JNK activation is required for cellular transformation by certain oncogenes as well as by constitutively activated c-Ras, Rac, and protein-activated kinase-65 (24Auer K.L. Contessa J. Brenz-Verca S.

In addition, growth factors such as epidermal growth factor and platelet-derived growth factor can cause activation of the JNK pathway (18Bost F. Dean N. McKay R. Mercola D. J. Biol.

Potapova O. Liu C. Yang Y.-M. Charbono W. Dean N.M. McKay R. Mercola D. Cancer Gene Ther. 1998; 5: 527Google Scholar). We have recently reported that treatment with JNK2-specific antisense oligonucleotides (JNK2AS) led to apoptosis in several cell types in a p53-dependent fashion and provided evidence that p21cip1/waf1, a downstream target of p53, was an important factor in the survival of cells with wild type p53 status (36Potapova O. Gorospe M. Dougherty R.H. Dean N.M. Gaarde W.A. Holbrook N.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1713-1722Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). In a panel of human tumor cell lines containing null/mutant p53, the human T98G glioblastoma cell line stood out as an exception in that we failed to see any apoptosis following treatment with JNK antisense oligonucleotides (JNKAS). The present study was initiated to further investigate the role of JNK in regulating basal growth (normal culture conditions) of human glioblastoma T98G cells. We demonstrate that targeted inhibition of JNK expression, accomplished through use of specific antisense oligonucleotides, does not result in significant apoptosis of T98G cells but rather results in marked growth suppression that is associated with inhibition of DNA synthesis, cell cycle arrest in S phase, and p53-independent induction of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21cip1/waf1. These findings indicate that JNK is essential for normal growth of T98G cells and suggest that the JNK pathway regulates molecules vital for replication of these tumor cells. Human glioblastoma T98G cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.), supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Irvine Scientific). For metabolic protein labeling, cells were incubated in methionine-free, cysteine-free, and serum-free medium for 4 h in the presence of 200 μCi of TranslabelTM (ICN Chemical) containing carrier-free [35S]methionine/cysteine. Immediately after incubation, cells were washed with cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in 0.5-ml radioimmune precipitation buffer containing protease and phosphatase inhibitors (0.15 m NaCl, 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.2, 1% deoxycholic acid, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm orthovanadate, 10 mm NaF and 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate). All phosphorothioate oligonucleotides used in this study were prepared and characterized by Isis Pharmaceuticals, Inc. as described previously (18Bost F. Dean N. McKay R. Mercola D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 33422-33429Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 37Dean N.M. McKay R. Condon T.P. Bennett C.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16416-16424Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Two oligonucleotides, ISIS12539 (5′-CTCTCTGTAGGCCCGCTTGG-3′) and ISIS12560 (5′-GTCCGGGCCAGGCCAAAGTC-3′), termed JNK1AS and JNK2AS, respectively, specifically eliminate the expression of respective JNK proteins (17Xu X.S.

Biol. 1999; 19: 1938-1949Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). To control for nonspecific events, “sense” sequence oligonucleotides (JNK1S (ISIS14320) and JNK2S (ISIS14318)), and “scrambled” sequence oligonucleotides (JNK1Scr (ISIS14321) and JNK2Scr (ISIS14319)) with the same base composition as the antisense oligonucleotides, but in arbitrary order, were employed. Oligonucleotides were delivered to cells by lipofection as described previously (18Bost F. Dean N. McKay R. Mercola D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 33422-33429Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Briefly, solutions for lipofection were made by mixing 10 μg/ml LipofectinTM (Life Technologies, Inc.) reagent in minimal essential medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) with an equal volume of oligonucleotide solution, incubating this mixture at room temperature for 15 min and diluting it with LipofectinTM solution to a final oligonucleotide concentration of 0.4 μm. Cells were incubated with the LipofectinTM-oligonucleotide solution at 37 °C in 10% CO2 for 12–16 h, after which they were washed once with serum-free medium and cultured in complete medium. To determine the proliferation rates, cells were seeded at 25 × 103cells/cm2 in six-well cluster plates, and growth was assessed by daily cell counting (Coulter counter) in triplicate. For determination of cell viability and assessment of DNA synthesis, cells were seeded at 1–5 × 103 cells/well in 96-well tissue culture plates. The viable cell mass was determined by the addition of 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium inner salt (MTS) as described in the manufacturer's protocol (Promega). Cell viability is expressed as the ratio of viable cell mass following a given treatment to that of untreated cells × 100 (Viable Cell Mass (%); see Fig. 5). Rates of DNA synthesis were measured by incorporation of [3H]thymidine into polymeric DNA. Cells were treated with oligonucleotides and pulsed with 0.5 μCi of [3H]thymidine/well for 3 h at the indicated times. Harvested lysates were transferred to paper spots with a PhD-200A cell harvester (Cambridge Technologies), and the amount of radioactive DNA was quantitated by scintillation counting using Biosafe-II scintillation liquid. Total RNA was isolated from treated cells using RNA Stat-60 (Tel-Test B) according to the manufacturer's instructions. RNA (30 μg/lane) was size-separated in agarose-formaldehyde gels and transferred to GeneScreen Plus nylon membranes (NEN Life Science Products). JNK1 andJNK2 cDNAs, isolated from pBSJNK2–1×HA and 3×HA-JNK1SRα3, respectively, were labeled with [α-32P]dATP using a random primer labeling kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Hybridization and washes were performed by the method of Church and Gilbert (38Church G.M. Gilbert W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 1991-1995Crossref PubMed Scopus (7267) Google Scholar), and hybridization signals were visualized and quantified using a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics. To monitor the quality of sample loading and transfer, membranes were hybridized to a 24-base oligonucleotide 3′-ACGGTATCTGATCGTCTTCGAACC-5′ complementary to 18 S RNA. For Western analyses, 50 μg of cell whole-cell lysates (18Bost F. Dean N. McKay R. Mercola D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 33422-33429Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar) were size-fractionated in 12% SDS-PAGE and transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. Proteins were detected using an enhanced chemiluminescence system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) following incubation of the polyvinylidene difluoride membranes with specific antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Cell cycle distribution was analyzed using propidium iodide (PI)-stained cells. Briefly, 2–5 × 106 cells were fixed in 70% ethanol, incubated with 1 μg/ml RNase A, stained with 1 μg/ml propidium iodide (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), and analyzed on a FACScalibur flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson). The percentages of cells in the various stages of the cell cycle were determined using the ModFitLT software program. S-phase cells were detected using 5-bromo-2′-deoxyuridine (BrdUrd) Labeling and Detection Kit I (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) as described by the manufacturer with some modifications. Briefly, the cells were treated with oligonucleotides and 24 h later pulsed for 1 h with 10 μm of BrdUrd labeling reagent to allow incorporation of BrdUrd into DNA in place of thymidine. The cells were fixed for 24 h with 70% ethanol diluted in glycine buffer (50 mm glycine, 0.01% Triton X-100, 0.15m NaCl, pH 2.0) and incubated with anti-BrdUrd monoclonal antibodies. After incubation with anti-mouse Ig-fluorescein, bound anti-BrdUrd monoclonal antibodies were visualized by fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis. The number of apoptotic cells following treatment with JNKAS was determined using an APO-BRDUTM kit (Pharmingen) following the manufacturer's protocol. Briefly, 1–2 × 106cells were fixed in 1% methanol-free formaldehyde following incubation in 70% ethanol at −20 °C. To detect genomic DNA degradation, bromodeoxyuridine triphosphate was incorporated into DNA breaks by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase enzyme. Finally, cells were stained with fluorescein-labeled anti-BrdUrd antibody to detect DNA breaks and with PI/RNase A solution for counterstaining of the total DNA. Dual parameter display was used to assess the number of apoptotic cells following analysis on FACScalibur flow cytometer. To detect JNK activation following UV-C exposure, JNKAS-treated and control cultures were irradiated with 40 J/m2 UV-C 24 h postlipofection, washed with cold phosphate-buffered saline 30 min later, and suspended in whole-cell extract buffer (18Bost F. Dean N. McKay R. Mercola D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 33422-33429Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). An in vitro JNK kinase assay was performed using a fusion protein containing glutathione linked to the 1–222 fragment of human c-Jun (GST-c-Jun) as substrate, as described (6Hibi M. Lin A. Smeal T. Minden A. Karin M. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 2135-2148Crossref PubMed Scopus (1709) Google Scholar). Briefly, 50 μg of cell lysate was incubated for 3 h at 4 °C with 10 μg of GST-c-Jun bound to glutathione-Sepaharose-4B (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). After washing three times in whole-cell extract buffer and once in kinase reaction buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.7, 20 mmMgCl2, 20 mm β-glycerophosphate, 20 mm p-nitrophenyl phosphate, 0.1 mmsodium vanadate, 2 mm dithiothreitol, the beads were incubated with 30 μl of kinase reaction buffer containing 20 μm ATP and 5 μCi of [α-32P]ATP for 30 min at 30 °C. The reaction was stopped by the addition of Laemmli sample buffer. Samples were boiled for 5 min and resolved by electrophoresis through 12% polyacrylamide-SDS gels (SDS-PAGE). To detect Cdk2 and Cdc2 kinase activities following JNKAS treatment, cells were harvested in Cdk2/Cdc2 lysis buffer (50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.4, 250 mm NaCl, 5 mm NaF, 0.1% Triton X-100, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mmsodium orthovanadate) supplemented with protease inhibitors, and cellular debris were removed from soluble extracts by centrifugation at 16,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. Cdk2 and Cdc2 were immunoprecipitated from 100-μg aliquots after a 16-h incubation at 4 °C in the presence of either anti-Cdk2 (Pharmingen), or anti-cyclin B1 antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), respectively. Immunoprecipitates were washed with Cdk2/Cdc2 lysis buffer and with H1 kinase buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 10 mmMgCl2, and 1 mm dithiothreitol). Kinase activities associated with anti-Cdk2 and anti-cyclin B1 immunoprecipitates were assayed in 50 μl of H1 kinase buffer containing 10 μg of histone H1 (Ambion) supplemented with 2 mm EGTA and 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP. Reactions were carried out for 30 min at 37 °C and stopped by the addition of Laemmli sample buffer. Reaction products were electrophoresed in 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Results were visualized with a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics). To examine a role for the JNK pathway in mediating basal growth of T98G cells and to test whether there is a preferential role for JNK1 or JNK2, we employed specific JNK1 and JNK2 antisense oligonucleotides (18Bost F. Dean N. McKay R. Mercola D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 33422-33429Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 19Bost F. McKay R. Bost M. Potapova O. Dean N. Mercola D. Mol.

Preliminary experiments using a control fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled oligonucleotide (c-rafISIS13153) revealed that the efficiency of uptake of the phosphorothioate oligonucleotide, delivered as described under “Experimental Procedures,” was nearly 100% (Fig.1). The specificity of the elimination ofJNK1 and JNK2 mRNAs by JNKAS in T98G cells is shown in Fig. 2. While neither mock treatment nor treatment with control “scrambled” (JNKScr) oligonucleotides had any effect on JNK mRNA levels in T98G cells, treatment with JNK1AS and JNK2AS resulted in >95% elimination of the respective mRNAs 24 h postlipofection (Fig. 2 A). Although the JNK1 andJNK2 mRNA levels have largely recovered by 72 h, an effective “window of observation” was provided by the antisense treatment as indicated in Fig. 2 B (shaded area). The efficiency of inhibition of JNKexpression was confirmed by Western analysis (Fig.3 A). Major JNK isoforms migrate with apparent molecular masses of 46 and 54 kDa. The slower migrating proteins (p54JNK) are largely, but not exclusively, composed of the JNK2 isoforms, whereas the faster migrating proteins (p46JNK) are largely, but not exclusively, composed of JNK1 isoforms (1Ip Y.T. Davis R.J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 205-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (1381) Google Scholar). Treatment with JNK1AS and JNK2AS markedly attenuated the 46- and 54-kDa components, respectively (Fig. 3 A), consistent with the known distribution of JNK isoforms. Time course studies of 35S-metabolically labeled T98G cells indicated that the half-lives for degradation of JNK1 and JNK2 proteins are 14 and 3.4 h, respectively (Fig. 3 B). This is consistent with the marked reduction in steady-state levels of both JNK proteins (a reflection of both reduced synthesis and degradation of existing proteins) between 30 and 50 h post-treatment (data not shown). Determination of kinase activity in cells irradiated with UV-C (40 J/m2) 24 h postlipofection revealed a markedly lower level of JNK activation in JNKAS-treated cells relative to control cells (Fig. 3 C).Figure 2Transient elimination of JNK mRNA expression following JNKAS treatment.

A, attenuation of JNK protein levels 24 h postlipofection. T98G cells were treated with 0.4 μm oligonucleotides (0.2 μm each in combinations). One hundred-μg aliquots of whole-cell lysates were processed for Western blot analysis, and JNK levels were detected using SC-571 JNK antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). B, half-life determination of JNK1 and JNK2. T98G cells were metabolically labeled for 4 h with [35S]methionine as described under “Experimental Procedures,” and the amount of labeled JNK proteins at designated times was determined by immunoprecipitation, separation by SDS-PAGE, and visualization by autoradiography (lower panel). JNK1-specific antibodies SC-479 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) were used to detect JNK1 levels, and SC-571 antibodies were used for detection of JNK2 levels in JNK1-depleted lysates. The log function of normalized intensities of the resulting bands for each protein was plotted as a function of the time after the end of the metabolic labeling period.

Cells treated with a combination of 0.2 μm each JNK1AS and JNK2AS (labeled JNKAS) or 0.2 μm each JNK1Scr and JNK2Scr (labeled JNKScr) were exposed to 40 J/m2 UV-C (lanes labeled +) or left untreated (−) 24 h postlipofection. JNK activity was measured 30 min later by in vitro kinase assay as described under “Experimental Procedures.”View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To determine whether inhibition of JNK has an effect on the growth of T98G cells, we assessed the viability of T98G cells over a 24–120-h time period following JNKAS treatment. Viable cell mass was measured both using an MTS-based colorimetric assay and by direct cell counts. The viability of mock- and JNKScr-treated cultures was very similar to that of untreated cells over the entire time course (Fig.4, A and B). In contrast, treatment with either JNK1AS or JNK2AS led to a marked reduction in viable cell mass. Growth suppression following treatment with JNK2AS was more pronounced than seen with JNK1AS treatment (∼40% versus 65% that of controls at 24 h postlipofection, respectively), especially at later time points (∼15% versus 75%, respectively, at 120 h postlipofection), although statistically significant differences in growth inhibition by both JNKAS were observed as early as 24 h postlipofection. As determined by direct counting from 24–72 h postlipofection, the number of viable cells in attached JNK1AS-treated cultures was significantly diminished relative to that of control cultures (Fig. 4 C). Consistent with the transient loss in JNK expression, JNK1AS-treated cells resumed growth at later times with cell numbers recovering to 70% of that seen in control cultures by day 5 (Fig. 4 B). JNK2AS-treated cells exhibited a greater loss in cell mass than their JNK1AS-treated counterparts at all times, and, unlike that seen with JNK1AS, their growth did not recover with time. Five days post-lipofection, the viable cell mass of the JNK2AS-treated population was 15% of that seen for control groups (Fig.4 B). In summary, although the magnitude of the growth inhibition a"
https://openalex.org/W2104576267,"NIPP1 is a regulatory subunit of a species of protein phosphatase-1 (PP1) that co-localizes with splicing factors in nuclear speckles. We report that the N-terminal third of NIPP1 largely consists of a Forkhead-associated (FHA) protein interaction domain, a known phosphopeptide interaction module. A yeast two-hybrid screening revealed an interaction between this domain and a human homolog (CDC5L) of the fission yeast protein cdc5, which is required for G<sub>2</sub>/M progression and pre-mRNA splicing. CDC5L and NIPP1 co-localized in nuclear speckles in COS-1 cells. Furthermore, an interaction between CDC5L, NIPP1, and PP1 in rat liver nuclear extracts could be demonstrated by co-immunoprecipitation and/or co-purification experiments. The binding of the FHA domain of NIPP1 to CDC5L was dependent on the phosphorylation of CDC5L, <i>e.g.</i>by cyclin E-Cdk2. When expressed in COS-1 or HeLa cells, the FHA domain of NIPP1 did not affect the number of cells in the G<sub>2</sub>/M transition. However, the FHA domain blocked β-globin pre-mRNA splicing in nuclear extracts. A mutation in the FHA domain that abolished its interaction with CDC5L also canceled its anti-splicing effects. We suggest that NIPP1 either targets CDC5L or an associated protein for dephosphorylation by PP1 or serves as an anchor for both PP1 and CDC5L."

V., Guruswamy, S., Cao, K. T., Pessin, J. E., and Olson, A. L. (1998) J. Biol. Chem. 273, 14285–14292). Our studies demonstrated that an MEF2 binding site within this region was necessary, but not sufficient, for GLUT4 promoter function in transgenic mice. We have identified a second regulatory element (Domain I) that functions cooperatively with the MEF2 domain in regulating GLUT4 transcription. Using a yeast-one hybrid screen, we obtained a partial cDNA and generated an antibody directed against a protein binding specifically to Domain I. Sequence analysis of the partial cDNA indicates that the protein binding to Domain I is a novel protein. The antibody specifically labels two proteins of approximately 70 and 50 kDa in Western blot analysis. These molecular masses correspond to Domain I binding proteins identified by UV-cross-linking nuclear extracts to a Domain I probe. The antibody raised against the Domain I binding protein inhibited formation of a Domain I-protein complex in electrophoretic mobility shift assays. We conclude that we have identified an authentic, novel, Domain I binding protein required for transcriptional regulation of the human GLUT4 promoter.

Several lines of evidence have shown that the effect of insulin on glucose uptake in these tissues results directly from the recruitment of the GLUT41 facilitative glucose transporter from an intracellular vesicle pool to the plasma membrane (for recent reviews see Refs. 1Olson A.L.

GLUT4 was first implicated as the major insulin responsive glucose transporter when it was shown to be the predominant isoform expressed in tissues exhibiting insulin-stimulated glucose uptake (3James D.E.

Proof that GLUT4 is the primary effector molecule for insulin-mediated glucose disposal came from transgenic animals.

Insulin-mediated glucose homeostasis is extremely sensitive to GLUT4 levels in the major insulin responsive tissues, including heart, skeletal muscle, and adipose tissue. In rodent models of insulin deficiency (fasting or streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetes), GLUT4 protein and mRNA expression are markedly reduced and together account for the reduced insulin-dependent glucose transport in response to insulin under these conditions (13Berger J.

Genetic studies strengthen the relationship between insulin-mediated glucose homeostasis and the levels of GLUT4 protein. Transgenic mice expressing only one allele of the GLUT4 gene were shown to express GLUT4 protein at reduced levels, resulting in a progressive diabetic phenotype characterized by impaired glucose homeostasis (20Stenbit A.E. Tsao T.-S. Li J. Burcelin R. Grenen D.L. Factor S.M. Houseknicht K. Katz E.B. Charron M.J. Nat. Med. 1997; 3: 1096-1101Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). In STZ-diabetic mice, overexpression of GLUT4 in either fat or skeletal muscle, under the control of heterologous tissue-specific promoters, improves glucose homeostasis (21Leturque A. Loizeau M. Vaulont S. Salminen M. Girard J. Diabetes. 1996; 45: 23-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 22Tozzo E. Gnudi L. Kahn B.B.

Finally, expression of the humanGLUT4 gene within the context of the genetically diabeticdb/db strain of mice improved glycemic control and insulin sensitivity (23Gibbs E.M. Stock J.L. McCoid S.C.

The close association between the GLUT4 protein pool size and physiologic changes in glucose homeostasis make manipulation of GLUT4 gene expression a potentially important target for therapeutic interventions designed to treat insulin resistance associated with diabetes. To manipulate GLUT4 gene expression as a therapeutic strategy, a detailed understanding of the regulation of GLUT4 transcription at the molecular level is required. GLUT4mRNA expression is subject to tissue-specific, hormonal, and metabolic regulation. Changes in GLUT4 gene expression occurin vivo during states of altered glucose homeostasis. In general, GLUT4 mRNA expression is down-regulated in states of relative insulin-deficiency such as STZ-induced diabetes and chronic fasting (for review see Refs. 24Olson A.L. Pessin J.E. Cell. Dev. Biol. 1996; 7: 287-293Google Scholar and 25Stephens J.M. Pilch P.F. Endocr. Rev. 1995; 16: 529-546PubMed Google Scholar). The observed differences in steady-state levels of GLUT4 mRNA are attributed to changes in mRNA synthesis, with rates determined by nuclear run-on transcription assays demonstrating that GLUT4gene transcription in STZ-induced diabetic animals is decreased in both adipose tissue and skeletal muscle (26Gerrits P.M. Olson A.L. Pessin J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 640-644Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 27Neufer P.D. Carey J.O. Dohm G.L. J. Biol.

These results underscore the importance of understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying function of the GLUT4 promoter, if pharmacological methods for increasing GLUT4 expression are to be developed. Transgenic mice have provided a valuable model system for studying the GLUT4 gene promoter within a natural physiologic context. Using transgenic mice, we have shown previously that regions regulating expression of the human GLUT4 gene are located within 895 base pairs (bp) of DNA positioned upstream of the major transcription initiation site (28Liu M.L.

The 895-bp regulatory region supported a pattern of gene expression identical to that of the mouseGLUT4 gene, both in terms of tissue specificity and regulation, in fasting and STZ-induced models of insulin deficiency (31Thai M.V. Guruswamy S. Cao K.T. Pessin J.E. Olson A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14285-14292Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). We determined in those studies that an MEF2 DNA binding domain performs a critical role in regulation of the human GLUT4gene promoter; however, our data indicated that the MEF2 binding site alone is not sufficient to support a regulated and tissue-specific program of gene expression (30Olson A.L.

Chem. 1998; 273: 14285-14292Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). In the current study, we have identified a second regulatory region within the functional portion of the human GLUT4 promoter that acts synergistically with the MEF2 binding domain to support a pattern of transcription identical to the endogenous GLUT4 gene. In addition, we have identified a novel DNA binding protein that interacts with this regionin vitro. Our experimental evidence indicates that the two regulatory regions of the human GLUT4 promoter function cooperatively to support transcription in transgenic mice. cDNA constructs used to generate transgenic mice were derived from the plasmid hGLUT4[2.4]CAT (28Liu M.L. Olson A.L. Moye-Rowley W.S. Buse J.B. Bell G.I. Pessin J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11673-11676Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Two internal deletions in hGLUT4[2.4]CAT were generated by polymerase chain reaction. Internal deletions were made between nucleotides −711 and −526 (Δ711/526) and between nucleotides −742 to −526 (Δ742/526). The promoter-reporter constructs were obtained by digesting plasmid DNA with AVRII and HindIII so that the 5′-end of each reporter construct corresponded to nucleotide position −895 relative to the major transcription initiation site of the humanGLUT4 gene. These constructs are referred to as 895Δ711/526-hG4-CAT and 895Δ742/526-hG4-CAT, respectively. The DNA fragments containing the promoter-reporter construct were isolated by agarose gel electrophoresis and injected into the pronucleus of fertilized mouse embryos at the Microinjection Core Facility at the Oklahoma Medical Research Foundation, in Oklahoma City (Dr. Brian Sauer, director). Transgenic animals carrying the appropriate constructs were identified by slot blot analysis of isolated tail DNA using the 4.6-kilobase (kb) SacI/HinDIII fragment of hGLUT4[2.4]CAT as a probe. Insulin-deficient diabetes was induced by a single intraperitoneal injection of STZ (200 mg/kg of body weight) following an overnight fast as described previously (32LeMarchand-Brustel Y. Olichon-Berthe C. Gremeaux T. Tant J.F. Rochet N. Van Obberghen E. Endocrinology. 1990; 127: 2687-2695Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). 72 h after injection, tail vein blood samples were assayed for glucose concentration using chemstrips (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Animals with blood glucose levels greater than 400 mg/dl were considered diabetic. The diabetic animals were either left untreated or were treated with 1 unit of regular insulin per day for 2 days. The mice were killed 5 days after STZ injection, and the tissues were frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −70 °C until analyzed. Total cellular RNA was isolated from frozen tissues using guanidinium isothiocyanate extraction followed by purification on a CsCl gradient (33Chirgwin J.M. Przybyla A.E. MacDonald R.J. Rutter W.J. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 5294-5299Crossref PubMed Scopus (16652) Google Scholar) as described previously (34Olson A.L. Perlman S. Robillard J.E. Pediatr. Res. 1990; 28: 183-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). RNA was quantified spectrophotometrically by absorbance at 260 nm and stored as an ethanol precipitate at −70 °C. RNase protection analysis was carried out as described previously (31Thai M.V. Guruswamy S. Cao K.T. Pessin J.E. Olson A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14285-14292Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Tissues were harvested and frozen in liquid nitrogen. The frozen tissues were pulverized in liquid nitrogen and homogenized in 10 volumes of homogenization buffer A (250 mm sucrose; 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.6; 25 mm KCl; 1 mm EDTA; 10% glycerol; 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF); 0.5 mmbenzamidine; 2 μg/ml each of aprotinin, leupeptin, and pepstatin A; 2 mm levamisole; 10 mm β-glycerophosphate; and 1 mm sodium vanadate) with 10 strokes of a Teflon pestle. The homogenate was centrifuged 10 min at 2400 × g at 4 °C. The pellet was resuspended in 10 ml of homogenization buffer A and homogenized with 10 strokes of a Dounce homogenizer with a tight fitting pestle (pestle B). The homogenate was layered over one-half volume of buffer A-1.0 (buffer A with addition of 1.0m sucrose) and centrifuged at 2400 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The pellet was resuspended in 2 volumes of buffer A-1.0, and repelleted by microcentrifugation at 16,000 ×g for 20 s. The crude nuclear pellet was then resuspended in 1 volume of nuclear extraction buffer (10 mmHepes, pH 7.6; 325 mm NaCl; 3 mmMgCl2; 0.1 mm EDTA; 10% glycerol; 1 mm dithiothreitol (DTT); 0.1 mm PMSF; 0.5 mm benzamidine; and 2 μg/ml each of aprotinin, leupeptin, and pepstatin A) and incubated on ice for 20 min, and the particulate material was removed by centrifugation at 16,000 × gin a microcentrifuge for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was dialyzed against buffer C (25 mm Hepes, pH 7.6; 100 mm KCl; 0.1 mm EDTA; 10% glycerol; 1 mm DTT; 0.1 mm PMSF; 0.5 mmbenzamidine; 2 μg/ml each of aprotinin, leupeptin, and pepstatin A; 2 mm levamisole; 10 mm β-glycerophosphate; and 1 mm sodium vanadate) for 4 h. The dialysate was assayed for total protein (Bradford) and stored at −70 °C. DNase I footprinting was performed using a DNA fragment corresponding to nucleotides −800 to −412 of the human GLUT4 promoter with an internal deletion of nucleotides −711 to −526. The probe was prepared by end labeling the AvrII/BssHI fragment cleaved from the parental 2.4-hGR-CAT plasmid carrying the internal deletion. The fragment was end-labeled with T4 polynucleotide kinase, cut with BamHI, and gel-isolated so that the probe was labeled at only the 3′-end. DNase I footprinting was performed without or with nuclear extracts from heart and liver, using a Core Footprinting system (Promega, Madison, WI). Electrophoresis of the DNase I footprint was performed on a 7.5 m urea/6% acrylamide sequencing gel adjacent to a Maxam and Gilbert guanine sequencing ladder of the fragment. The gel was fixed, dried, and exposed to film at −70 °C with intensifying screens. Oligonucleotides containing the human GLUT4 Domain I DNA binding site (CTTGTCCCTCGGACCGGCTCCAGGAACCAA and its complement) were custom-synthesized (Life Technologies, Inc.). The oligonucleotides containing the OCT1 DNA binding site were commercially prepared (Santa Cruz). Oligonucleotides were end-labeled with T4 polynucleotide kinase. Labeled probes (0.5 ng) were incubated with 10 μg of total protein isolated from nuclei in a 10-μl reaction containing 2 μg of poly(dI-dC), 40 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 15 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm DTT, and 5% glycerol for 20 min at room temperature. For competition studies, extracts were preincubated with various concentrations of unlabeled oligonucleotide as indicated for 5 min before addition of the radiolabeled probe. For competition studies using antibodies, extracts were preincubated with 2.5 μg of either preimmune IgG, anti-GST-GEFdb IgG, or IgG from an irrelevant antiserum raised against a glutathioneS-transferase (GST) fusion protein. Preincubation was carried out for 1 h on ice before addition of the radiolabeled probe. Samples were electrophoresed on a non-denaturing 6% polyacrylamide gel (29:1 acrylamide:bis acrylamide) buffered with Tris borate/EDTA (TBE; 22 mm Tris, 22 mm boric acid, and 0.5 mm EDTA) at 300 V for 25 min at room temperature. Gels were then dried and an exposure of them was made on film at room temperature. The MATCHMAKER one-hybrid system (CLONTECH) was used in screening a human skeletal muscle cDNA library to identify a protein that binds to the Domain I regulatory element of the human GLUT4 promoter. A Domain I/pHISi-1 reporter construct was generated by inserting three tandem repeats of the Domain I sequence (AATTCCCTCGGACCGGCTCCACCAATCCCTCGGACCGGCTCCAGGAATCCCTCGGACCGGCTCCAGGAA) into the SmaI/EcoRI sites of the pHISi-1 integration vector. PHISi-1 was also used to make a reporter construct containing a mutant Domain I sequence (Mut1) target element (AATTCCCTCGGGTTAACTCCAGGAATCCCTCGGGTTAACTCCAGGAATCCCTCGGGTTAACTCCAGGAA) that was unable to bind nuclear proteins during electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA). pHISi-1 expresses the HIS3 gene from a minimal promoter that allows a low level of HIS3expression. A large scale transformation of the yeast strain YM4271 (his−, ura−, leu−) with the target vector constructs was performed on medium lacking histidine. A stable transformant growing on His− medium that did not grow on His− medium supplemented with 15 mm3-amino-1,2,4-triazole (added to suppress growth resulting from low levels of HIS3 expression from the minimal promoter) was used as the Domain I/pHISi-1 reporter strain for library screening. The Mut1/pHISi-1 stable transformant was constructed using the same procedure. An adult human skeletal muscle cDNA library (CLONTECH) was probed by transformation of the Domain I/pHISi-1 reporter strain. Transformants expressing library proteins that activated transcription of the Domain I/pHISi-1 construct were selected on Leu−/His−/3-amino-1,2,4-triazole dropout medium. cDNA from positive transformants was isolated and retransformed into the Mut1/pHISi-1 reporter strain. Transformants that failed to grow in the Mut1/pHISi-1 reporter strain were selected for further characterization. A cDNA clone (GenBank™ accession number AF249267) isolated from the yeast one-hybrid screen was subcloned in-frame into the GST-3X fusion protein vector (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The fusion protein (GST-GEFdb) was isolated from Escherichia coli(DH5-α strain) by lysing cells in radioimmune precipitation buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 0.15 m NaCl, 1% deoxycholate, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% SDS, 2 mm PMSF) followed by affinity purification over a GST-Sepharose column according to the manufacturer's specifications. The fusion protein was eluted from the column with 20 mm glutathione (pH 8.0) and was concentrated using Centricon-30 filters (Amicon Inc.). The concentrated samples were dialyzed overnight against 1000 sample volumes of Tris-buffered saline (TBS, 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl). Antibodies against the isolated fusion protein were raised in rabbits (Cocalico Biologicals). IgG proteins were purified from preimmune rabbit serum and GST-GEFdbantiserum by protein-G affinity chromatography. 30 μg of total nuclear extract protein were solubilized in an equal volume of 2× Laemmli sample buffer (120 mm Tris, pH 6.8, 4% SDS, 20% glycerol, and 200 mm DTT) and separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) using 7.5 acrylamide gels. Separated proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore) in buffer (25 mm Tris and 190 mm glycine, pH 8.5) overnight at 0.2 A at 4 °C. Polyvinylidene difluoride membranes were blocked 1 h at room temperature with the TBS solution containing 0.2% Tween 20 and 7% dried milk (Carnation). Blocked membranes were probed with the rabbit polyclonal antibody raised against GST-GEFdb (0.2 μg/ml) in TBS containing 0.1% Tween 20 and 2% bovine serum albumin (Sigma) for 1 h at room temperature. To determine specificity, the polyclonal antibody solution was also preincubated with 15 μg of GST-GEFdb fusion protein immobilized on agarose beads. The solution (depleted of GST-GEFdb-specific IgG) was used for Western blot analysis. Immunoreactive proteins were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (SuperSignal, Pierce) following incubation of the blot with a goat-anti-rabbit secondary antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Pierce). In our previous studies, we demonstrated that the smallest promoter-enhancer construct capable of supporting regulated, tissue-specific expression of the GLUT4 gene (895-hG4-CAT) consisted of 895 bp of DNA located immediately upstream of the transcription initiation site (30Olson A.L.

Two lines of evidence suggested that functional activity of 895-hG4-CAT was regulated by two regulatory domains consisting of a proximal MEF2 binding domain and an uncharacterized upstream element located in the vicinity of nucleotide −730 (relative to the major transcription initiation site). First, transgenic mRNA expression was ablated upon introduction of a loss-of-function mutation in the MEF2 binding domain in the 895-hG4-CAT reporter construct (31Thai M.V. Guruswamy S. Cao K.T. Pessin J.E. Olson A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14285-14292Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Second, a 5′-deletion of all sequences upstream of −730 resulted in a pattern of expression that was not regulated under STZ diabetes and was not tissue-specific (30Olson A.L. Pessin J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23491-23495Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The focus of the current study was to confirm that an additional regulatory element upstream of the MEF2 regulatory domain was required for GLUT4 promoter function in transgenic mice, and to define that element. Sequence analysis of the region upstream of the MEF2 binding domain did not reveal any known transcription factor binding domains. We assumed, however, that an important functional domain would coincide with a region of significant sequence conservation between species. A 60-bp region with greater than 90% sequence homology exists between nucleotides −712 and −772 (186 bp upstream of the MEF2 binding domain) (30Olson A.L. Pessin J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23491-23495Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). We refer to this region as Domain I. The 186 bp of DNA intervening between Domain I and the MEF2 binding domain showed little sequence conservation, suggesting that it may not be functionally important. To test our hypothesis that the unconserved sequences did not contain a regulatory element, we mutated the 895-hG4-CAT construct, deleting the unconserved sequences between −526 and −711 (895Δ711/526-hG4-CAT). RNA expression from this construct was studied in eight independent founder lines using an RNase protection assay. This assay was designed to measure transgenic mRNA in conjunction with endogenous GLUT4 mRNA. The pattern of tissue-specific expression from 895Δ711/526-hG4-CAT is shown in Fig.1 A. RNA expression from the modified GLUT4 promoter-enhancer in this construct was restricted to GLUT4-expressing tissues (Fig. 1 A, lanes 1–4). Importantly, transgenic CAT mRNA was not expressed in liver and brain, tissues that express little or no GLUT4 mRNA. The pattern of transgene expression from 895Δ711/526-hG4-CAT is identical to that observed for previous constructs carrying the full-length human GLUT4 regulatory region (30Olson A.L. Pessin J.E. J.

Chem. 1998; 273: 14285-14292Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar), indicating that the unconserved region is not required for regulated expression of GLUT4. It is well established that in both rats and mice,GLUT4 gene expression is down-regulated in insulin-deficient states. This has been shown to be due to a decrease in the rate of transcription (26Gerrits P.M. Olson A.L. Pessin J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 640-644Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29Olson A.L. Liu M.-L. Moye-Rowley W.S. Buse J.B. Bell G.I. Pessin J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9839-9846Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Decreased transcription is an insulin-dependent response, because the transcription rate and GLUT4 mRNA levels were fully restored following insulin therapy (26Gerrits P.M. Olson A.L. Pessin J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 640-644Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29Olson A.L. Liu M.-L. Moye-Rowley W.S. Buse J.B. Bell G.I. Pessin J.E. J. Biol.

To determine if 895Δ711/526-hG4-CAT was regulated by insulin deficiency in a manner analogous to the endogenousGLUT4 gene, we examined transgenic CAT mRNA expression in STZ-induced diabetes. Expression of CATmRNA in white and brown adipose tissue, heart, and hindquarter skeletal muscle was reduced in diabetic mice identically to that observed for the endogenous mouse GLUT4 gene (Fig.1 D) (30Olson A.L. Pessin J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23491-23495Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Treatment of these diabetic mice with insulin restored CAT mRNA to normal levels (Fig. 1 D). These data demonstrate that the unconserved sequences between positions −711 to −526 do not contribute to the function of the GLUT4 promoter with respect to either tissue-specific expression or regulated expression during insulin deficiency. Having substantially narrowed the control region of the human GLUT4 gene responsible for regulation of transcription, we employed DNase I footprint analysis to determine the specific site(s) that bind nuclear proteins and hence confer function. Footprint analysis was performed on a 202-bp DNA fragment corresponding to nucleotides −412 to −800 with an internal deletion of nucleotides −711 to −526 (corresponding to the unconserved 186-bp region). Footprints were carried out using nuclear extracts prepared from heart and liver (Fig.2). Analysis by this method revealed a strong DNase I hypersensitivity site upstream of a protected region spanning the DNA between nucleotides −712 and −742. This hypersensitivity site was apparent in footprints with extracts from both heart and liver, however, hypersensitivity was much less prominent using liver extracts. The presence of a DNase I hypersensitivity site in Domain I prompted us to carry out an electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) to determine if a sequenc"
https://openalex.org/W1981356615,"Upon binding of their ligands, death receptors belonging to the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor family initiate a signaling pathway leading to the activation of caspases and ultimately apoptosis. TNF, however, in parallel elicits survival signals, protecting many cell types from cell death that can only be induced by combined treatment with TNF and inhibitors of protein synthesis. Here, we report that in NIH3T3 cells, apoptosis in response TNF and cycloheximide is not inhibited by the broad spectrum caspase inhibitor benzyloxycarbonyl-Val-Ala-Asp-fluoromethyl ketone (zVAD.fmk). Moreover, treatment with zVAD.fmk sensitizes the cells to the cytotoxic action of TNF. Sensitization was also achieved by overexpression of a dominant-negative mutant of Fas-associated death domain protein and, to a lesser extent, by specific inhibition of caspase-8. A similar, but weaker sensitization of zVAD.fmk to treatment with the TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) or anti-CD95 antibody was demonstrated. The unexpected cell death in response to TNF and caspase inhibition occurs despite the activation of nuclear factor κB and c-Jun N-terminal kinases. The mode of cell death shows several signs of apoptosis including DNA fragmentation, although activation of caspase-3 was excluded. TNF/zVAD.fmk-induced cell death is preceded by an accumulation of cells in the G2/M phase of the cell cycle, indicating an important role of cell cycle progression. This hypothesis is further strengthened by the observation that arresting the cells in the G1 phase of the cell cycle inhibited TNF/zVAD.fmk-induced cell death, whereas blocking them in the G2/M phase augmented it."
https://openalex.org/W1492108202,"The caspase family of cysteine proteases plays important roles in bringing about apoptotic cell death. All caspases studied to date cleave substrates COOH-terminal to an aspartate. Here we show that the Drosophila caspase DRONC cleaves COOH-terminal to glutamate as well as aspartate. DRONC autoprocesses itself following a glutamate residue, but processes a second caspase, drICE, following an aspartate. DRONC prefers tetrapeptide substrates in which aliphatic amino acids are present at the P2 position, and the P1 residue can be either aspartate or glutamate. Expression of a dominant negative form of DRONC blocks cell death induced by the Drosophila cell death activators reaper, hid, and grim, and DRONC overexpression in flies promotes cell death. Furthermore, the Drosophila cell death inhibitor DIAP1 inhibits DRONC activity in yeast, and DIAP1's ability to inhibit DRONC-dependent yeast cell death is suppressed by HID and GRIM. These observations suggest that DRONC acts to promote cell death. However, DRONC activity is not suppressed by the caspase inhibitor and cell death suppressor baculovirus p35. We discuss possible models for DRONC function as a cell death inhibitor."

In cells, two forms of pol II are detectable containing either a hypophosphorylated (pol IIA) or hyperphosphorylated CTD (pol II0). Although pol IIA is consistently found in the initiation complex, pol II0 is associated with elongating complexes.An increasing number of genes have been shown to be regulated by promoter-proximal pausing of pol II.

The passage of the paused pol II into a processive mode coincides in vivo with hyperphosphorylation of the CTD (11O'Brien T. Hardin S. Greenleaf A. Lis J.T.

The capping enzyme is not stably associated with basal transcription factors or the RNA pol II holoenzyme but is directly and specifically recruited to the hyperphosphorylated form of CTD (20Cho E.J.

The cleavage-polyadenylation factors CPSF and CstF specifically bind to the hyperphosphorylated CTD and copurify with pol II in a high molecular mass complex (21McCracken S. Fong N. Yankulov K. Ballantyne S. Pan G. Greenblatt J. Patterson S.D. Wickens M. Bentley D.L. Nature. 1997; 385: 357-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (735) Google Scholar), suggesting that polyadenylation factors can be recruited to an RNA 3′-processing signal by pol II, where they dissociate from the polymerase and initiate polyadenylation. In an extension of this model, pol II is required for 3′-processing in vitro in the absence of transcription (30Hirose Y. Manley J.L. Nature. 1998; 395: 93-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar, 31Hirose Y. Tacke R. Manley J.L. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1234-1239Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar).In addition to pre-mRNA maturation, hyperphosphorylation of CTD appears to play an important role in rendering pol II processive. A positive and a negative elongation factor, implicated in 5,6-dichloro-1-β-d-ribofuranosylbenzimidazole (DRB) inhibition of transcription elongation, have been identified. DSIF (DRB sensitivity-inducing factor) is a negative elongation factor that renders elongation sensitive to DRB (32Wada T. Takagi T. Yamaguchi Y. Ferdous A. Imai T. Hirose S. Sugimoto S. Yano K.

Handa H. Genes Cells. 1998; 3: 9-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The state of CTD phosphorylation determines the negative action of DSIF on RNA elongation and provides a direct link between DSIF and the positive elongation factor P-TEFb, a CTD-specific kinase (cyclin T/cdk9), which is inhibited by DRB (37Zhu Y. Pe'ery T. Peng J. Ramanathan Y. Marshall N. Marshall T. Amendt B. Mathews M.B. Price D.H. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2622-2632Crossref PubMed Scopus (606) Google Scholar, 38Wei P. Garber M.E. Fang S.M.

Other factors,e.g. the Elongator complex, may also bind to pol II in a CTD-dependent manner (39Otero G. Fellows J. Li Y. de Bizemont T. Dirac A.M. Gustafsson C.M. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Svejstrup J.Q. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 109-118Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar). Taken together, a huge body of evidence suggests an important role for CTD in activation of RNA elongation and maturation of pre-mRNA in vivo.However, it is not yet clear whether the CTD of pol II is always required for transcriptional initiation in vivo. Several studies showed that pol II with a deleted CTD is transcriptionally active in vitro (Serizawa et al. (40Serizawa H. Conaway J.W. Conaway R.C. Nature. 1993; 363: 371-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar)) and initiates and transcribes transiently transfected genes (21McCracken S. Fong N. Yankulov K. Ballantyne S. Pan G. Greenblatt J. Patterson S.D. Wickens M. Bentley D.L. Nature. 1997; 385: 357-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (735) Google Scholar, 41Gerber H.P. Hagmann M. Seipel K. Georgiev O. West M.A. Litingtung Y. Schaffner W. Corden J.L. Nature. 1995; 374: 660-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar) as well as the CUP1 gene in yeast (42McNeil J.B. Agah H. Bentley D. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2510-2521Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Here, we show evidence that pol II with a deleted CTD is defective in global gene transcription and is unable to transcribe up to promoter-proximal pause sites on chromosomal templates.DISCUSSIONWe have established human B-cell lines conditionally expressing the large subunit of pol II to study the effect of CTD deletions on transcription initiation and promoter-proximal pausing. Long term cultures could be established in the presence of α-amanitin from Raji cells expressing LS*wt but not from cells expressing LS*Δ31 and LS*Δ5. Raji cells expressing LS*wt initially run through a crisis but thereafter proliferated quite normally in the presence of α-amanitin, with a doubling time of 30 h. Thus, constitutive expression of LS*wt from a heterologous promoter does not conflict with proliferation and long term survival of Raji cells. Currently we do not know the reason for the initial crisis. A possible reason for the crisis could be the point mutation in LS*wt that confers α-amanitin resistance. Cells expressing this mutant may have an altered gene expression pattern and require an adaptation phase for growth. In contrast, expression of LS*Δ31, even though it initially prolonged survival, and LS*Δ5 failed to replace the endogenous LS in regard to long term survival. This is in line with an earlier report that ratL6 myoblasts expressing LS*Δ31 showed a limited growth in a colony assay, whereas LS*Δ5 failed to support growth (4Bartolomei M.S. Halden N.F. Cullen C.R. Corden J.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 330-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar).In this study we were particularly interested in the question how deletion of the CTD affects global gene expression in Raji cells. LS*Δ5 has been shown to be defective in enhancer-driven expression of transiently transfected genes (41Gerber H.P. Hagmann M. Seipel K. Georgiev O. West M.A. Litingtung Y. Schaffner W. Corden J.L. Nature. 1995; 374: 660-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). The mutant has also been reported to be unable to facilitate pre-mRNA maturation in transient transfection experiments (21McCracken S. Fong N. Yankulov K. Ballantyne S. Pan G. Greenblatt J. Patterson S.D. Wickens M. Bentley D.L. Nature. 1997; 385: 357-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (735) Google Scholar). However, LS*Δ5 is able to transcribe transiently transfected CMV promoter and SP1-driven promoter constructs (41Gerber H.P. Hagmann M. Seipel K. Georgiev O. West M.A. Litingtung Y. Schaffner W. Corden J.L. Nature. 1995; 374: 660-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). These results could be confirmed for the CMV promoter and in addition for the c-myc promoter in RajiLS*Δ5 cells. pol II with a deleted CTD has also been reported to initiate at theDrosophila hsp70 gene promoter and to transcribe to the promoter-proximal pause site in vitro (53Li B. Weber J.A. Chen Y. Greenleaf A.L. Gilmour D.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5433-5443Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Thus, it was not clear whether LS*Δ5 has a general defect in initiation and/or elongation.A first approach to compare steady-state mRNA levels in cells expressing LS*wt and LS*Δ5 turned out to be unsuccessful, because treatment with α-amanitin for 24 h did not lead to significant changes in steady-state mRNA levels. This unexpected result suggested that inhibition of pol II transcription by α-amanitin may lead to a global stabilization of mRNA in Raji cells. Stabilization of mRNA by protein synthesis inhibitors, like cycloheximide, is a well known phenomenon that most likely results from the inhibition of the synthesis of factors required for mRNA degradation. Stabilization of mRNA by transcription inhibitors has been reported for the transferrin receptor gene (54Seiser C. Posch M. Thompson N. Kuhn L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29400-29406Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) and multidrug resistance genemdr1 (55Kuo M.T. Julian J. Husain F. Song R. Carson D.D. J. Cell. Physiol. 1995; 164: 132-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) but is not yet known to be a general phenomenon. This observation certainly deserves further analysis. Here, this phenomenon made a comparison of mRNAs levels in cells expressing LS*wt and LS*Δ5 impossible.As a consequence we measured the transcription rate of genes in nuclear run-on experiments. More than 500 transcriptionally active genes in phorbol ester-stimulated Raji cells were analyzed. These genes were also found to be transcribed in cells expressing LS*wt but were repressed or strongly reduced in transcription in cells expressing LS*Δ5, indicating that LS*Δ5 has a severe and general defect in transcription in vivo. We did not detect a single gene whose transcription was not severely affected. Notably, the low but significant transcription signals that were still detectable for a few genes in RajiLS*Δ5 but not in RajiLS*mock cells in the presence of α-amanitin indicate that the mutant LS*Δ5 is not transcriptionally dead. This is in agreement with the transient transfection experiments by us and others (21McCracken S. Fong N. Yankulov K. Ballantyne S. Pan G. Greenblatt J. Patterson S.D. Wickens M. Bentley D.L. Nature. 1997; 385: 357-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (735) Google Scholar, 22McCracken S. Fong N. Rosonina E. Yankulov K. Brothers G. Siderovski D. Hessel A. Foster S. Shuman S. Bentley D.L.

Nature. 1995; 374: 660-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). The ability of LS*Δ5 to transcribe from some promoters in transfection may rely on the fact that transiently transfected DNA does not establish proper chromatin and may be easily accessible for the transcriptional machinery. Genes packaged in regular chromatin may be less accessible to the transcriptional machinery, particularly if the CTD is deleted. In conclusion, a minimal size of the CTD appears to be required for the transcription of all mammalian genes. However, we cannot rule out that very few of the ∼100,000 estimated genes do not require the function of CTD for its transcription. For example, the CUP1 gene in yeast has been reported to be transcribed quite efficiently by pol II with a deleted CTD (42McNeil J.B. Agah H. Bentley D. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2510-2521Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar).What could be the reason that pol II without a CTD is unable to transcribe chromatin-packaged genes? In addition to binding of pre-mRNA maturation factors, CTD may permit recruitment of factors to the transcriptional machinery, either directly or indirectly, that allows transcription of chromatin-packaged DNA templates. Such a factor could be the Elongator complex, for example, which harbors HAT activity and binds to pol II only if the CTD is hyperphosphorylated (39Otero G. Fellows J. Li Y. de Bizemont T. Dirac A.M. Gustafsson C.M. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Svejstrup J.Q. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 109-118Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar). Alternatively, the phosphorylated CTD may be required to release inhibitory factors from pol II, e.g. DSIF, which interfere with elongation (32Wada T. Takagi T. Yamaguchi Y. Ferdous A. Imai T. Hirose S. Sugimoto S. Yano K. Hartzog G.A. Winston F. Buratowski S. Handa H. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 343-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar, 33Wada T. Takagi T. Yamaguchi Y. Watanabe D. Handa H. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 7395-7403Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar, 36Yamaguchi Y. Wada T. Handa H. Genes Cells. 1998; 3: 9-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Since phosphorylation of the CTD is assumed to be a critical step in activation of promoter-proximal paused pol II, we asked if the transition from a paused to an elongating pol II is affected if CTD is deleted. At the hsp70A and the c-fos promoters, pol II with a deleted CTD was unable to produce a transcription signal in nuclear run-ons, neither in uninduced nor induced cells. The run-on reactions have been carried out in the presence of Sarkosyl, which has been described to release nucleosomes from DNA (23Scheer U. Cell. 1978; 13: 535-549Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) and activate paused pol II (8Rougvie A.E. Lis J.T. Cell. 1988; 54: 795-804Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar). If pol II with a deleted CTD would be present at the pause site, Sarkosyl should induce its transcriptional activity in nuclear run-on experiments. Therefore, thehsp70A and c-fos genes in Raji cells do not harbor a pol II with a LS*Δ5 at promoter-proximal pause sites. Thus, LS*Δ5 has a defect in initiation or in the very early steps of RNA elongation prior to the polymerase undergoing its conformational change required for elongation. We found evidence that LS*Δ5 may have, dependent on the promoter, a defect at both levels. If the endogenous LS and LS*Δ5 were coexpressed in the absence of α-amanitin, LS*Δ5 showed a dominant-negative effect on transcription of the episomal construct. This suggests that LS*Δ5 can still somehow interact with or bind to the promoter but is unable to elongate. As a consequence the promoter is blocked for binding of endogenous pol II. Interestingly, this dominant-negative effect of LS*Δ5 was not seen for the c-myc, Ig μ, c-fos, and hsp70A genes. For these genes, CTD may already be required for binding of pol II to the promoter. pol II with a deleted CTD cannot compete in binding. From these data we conclude that the CTD not only fulfills important tasks in RNA elongation and maturation of pre-mRNA but also in initiation and/or early elongation. Eukaryotic mRNA synthesis is catalyzed by the multisubunit RNA polymerase II (pol II).1 The large subunit of pol II (LS) is highly conserved among eukaryotic RNA polymerases and also shows striking homology to the large subunit ofEscherichia coli RNA polymerase (1Uptain S.M. Kane C.M. Chamberlin M.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 117-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar). The LS has evolved a particularly structured carboxyl-terminal domain (CTD) that is not present in other RNA polymerases (2Corden J.L. Patturajan M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 413-416Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). This CTD comprises multiple copies of a heptapeptide repeat with the consensus sequence Tyr-Ser-Pro-Thr-Ser-Pro-Ser. The number of repeats varies from 26/27 in yeast to 52 in mouse and human cells (3Young R.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1991; 60: 689-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). Deletion of more than half of the repeats in yeast and mouse interferes with cell viability (4Bartolomei M.S. Halden N.F. Cullen C.R. Corden J.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 330-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 5Allison L.A. Wong J.K. Fitzpatrick V.D. Moyle M. Ingles C.J. Mol. Cell.

Mice homozygous for a deletion of 13 repeats are smaller than wild-type littermates and have a high rate of neonatal lethality (7Litingtung Y. Lawler A.M. Sebald S.M. Lee E. Gearhart J.D. Westphal H. Corden J.L. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1999; 261: 100-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), suggesting that CTD is important in regulating growth during mammalian development. In cells, two forms of pol II are detectable containing either a hypophosphorylated (pol IIA) or hyperphosphorylated CTD (pol II0). Although pol IIA is consistently found in the initiation complex, pol II0 is associated with elongating complexes. An increasing number of genes have been shown to be regulated by promoter-proximal pausing of pol II. These genes includeDrosophila hsp70 and hsp26 genes, as well as the mammalian c-myc, c-fos, and immunoglobulin κ genes (8Rougvie A.E. Lis J.T.

The passage of the paused pol II into a processive mode coincides in vivo with hyperphosphorylation of the CTD (11O'Brien T. Hardin S. Greenleaf A. Lis J.T. Nature. 1994; 370: 75-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar, 16Weeks J.R. Hardin S.E. Shen J. Lee J.M. Greenleaf A.L. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 2329-2344Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Recent studies suggest that the hyperphosphorylated CTD functions as a platform for the assembly of complexes that cap, splice, cleave, and polyadenylate pre-mRNA (2Corden J.L. Patturajan M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 413-416Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 17Bentley D. Curr. Opin.

Capping of mRNA occurs shortly after transcription initiation (19Coppola J.A. Field A.S. Luse D.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 1251-1255Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), preceding other mRNA processing events such as mRNA splicing and polyadenylation. The capping enzyme is not stably associated with basal transcription factors or the RNA pol II holoenzyme but is directly and specifically recruited to the hyperphosphorylated form of CTD (20Cho E.J. Takagi T. Moore C.R. Buratowski S. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 3319-3326Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar, 21McCracken S. Fong N. Yankulov K. Ballantyne S. Pan G. Greenblatt J. Patterson S.D.

Similarly, several components of the splicing machinery (25Kim E. Du L. Bregman D.B. Warren S.L. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 19-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar, 26Misteli T. Spector D.L.

Biol. 1998; 18: 2406-2415Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) are recruited to pol II by the hyperphosphorylated CTD. The cleavage-polyadenylation factors CPSF and CstF specifically bind to the hyperphosphorylated CTD and copurify with pol II in a high molecular mass complex (21McCracken S. Fong N. Yankulov K. Ballantyne S. Pan G. Greenblatt J. Patterson S.D. Wickens M. Bentley D.L. Nature. 1997; 385: 357-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (735) Google Scholar), suggesting that polyadenylation factors can be recruited to an RNA 3′-processing signal by pol II, where they dissociate from the polymerase and initiate polyadenylation. In an extension of this model, pol II is required for 3′-processing in vitro in the absence of transcription (30Hirose Y. Manley J.L. Nature. 1998; 395: 93-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar, 31Hirose Y. Tacke R. Manley J.L. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1234-1239Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). In addition to pre-mRNA maturation, hyperphosphorylation of CTD appears to play an important role in rendering pol II processive. A positive and a negative elongation factor, implicated in 5,6-dichloro-1-β-d-ribofuranosylbenzimidazole (DRB) inhibition of transcription elongation, have been identified. DSIF (DRB sensitivity-inducing factor) is a negative elongation factor that renders elongation sensitive to DRB (32Wada T. Takagi T. Yamaguchi Y. Ferdous A. Imai T. Hirose S. Sugimoto S. Yano K.

DGKα and γ were present throughout the cytoplasm of CHO-K1 cells. Tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate (TPA) induced irreversible translocation of DGKγ, but not DGKα, from the cytoplasm to the plasma membrane. The (TPA)-induced translocation of DGKγ was inhibited by the mutation of C1A but not C1B domain of DGKγ and was not inhibited by staurosporine. Arachidonic acid induced reversible translocation of DGKγ from the cytoplasm to the plasma membrane, whereas DGKα showed irreversible translocation to the plasma membrane and the Golgi network. Purinergic stimulation induced reversible translocation of both DGKγ and α to the plasma membrane. The timing of the ATP-induced translocation of DGKγ roughly coincided with that of PKCγ re-translocation from the membrane to the cytoplasm. Furthermore, re-translocation of PKCγ was obviously hastened by co-expression with DGKγ and was blocked by an inhibitor of DGK (R59022). These results indicate that DGK shows subtype-specific translocation depending on extracellular signals and suggest that PKC and DGK are orchestrated temporally and spatially in the signal transduction.

Chem. 1999; 274: 11447-11450Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). One of the important roles of DG is the activation of protein kinase C (PKC) (1Nishizuka Y. Nature. 1984; 308: 693-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (5760) Google Scholar, 3Nishizuka Y. Nature. 1988; 334: 661-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (3536) Google Scholar, 4Nishizuka Y. Science. 1992; 258: 607-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (4230) Google Scholar). Thus, DG is very important for regulation of PKC activity and cellular response. DG is produced physiologically as a result of the signal-induced hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol by phospholipase C and also from phosphatidylcholine by phospholipase D. Generated DG is phosphorylated to phosphatidic acid by diacylglycerol kinase (DGK) or cleavage by DG lipase (2Topham M.K. Prescott S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11447-11450Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar, 5Bell R.L. Kennerly D.A. Stanford N. Majerus P.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

DGK is an important enzyme for inactivating PKC by attenuation of the DG level, contributing to regulation of the cellular response. In addition, phosphatidic acid itself activates PKCζ and PLCγ1 (7Limatola C. Schaap D. Moolenaar W.H. Blitterswijk W.J. Biochem. J. 1994; 304: 1001-1008Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar, 8Jones G.A. Carpenter G. J. Biol.

Science. 1990; 250: 982-985Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). DGKs have additional important functions for various cellular responses. To date at least nine subtypes of mammalian DGKs have been cloned and divided into five groups based on structure (2Topham M.K. Prescott S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11447-11450Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). Generally, all DGKs have cysteine-rich regions homologous to the C1A and C1B motifs of PKCs in the regulatory domain at the N terminus of the protein and possess a conserved catalytic domain in the C terminus of the protein. Type I DGKs, including DGKα, -β, and -γ, have EF-hand motifs and two cysteine-rich regions in the regulatory domain (10Sakane F. Yamada K. Kanoh H. Yokoyama C. Tanabe T. Nature. 1990; 344: 345-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 11Goto K. Kondo H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 7598-7602Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 12Goto K. Fukuyama M. Kondo H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 13042-13046Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Type II DGKs such as DGKδ and -η, have a pleckstrin homology domain instead of the EF-hand motif in addition to two cysteine-rich regions (13Sakane F. Imai S. Kai M. Wada I. Kanoh H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8394-8401Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 14Tang W. Bunting M. Zimmerman G.A. McIntyre T.M. Prescott S.M. J. Biol.

Type III, consisting of DGKε, has only two cysteine-rich regions in the regulatory domain. Type IV, DGKζ and -ι, has a unique motif similar to the myristoylated alanine-rich C-kinase substrate (MARCKS) phosphorylation site in the regulatory domain and four ankyrin repeats at its C terminus (15Bunting M.

Zimmerman G.A. Prescott S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32746-32752Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The final group, type V, includes DGKθ, which has three cysteine-rich regions and a pleckstrin homology domain with an overlapping Ras-associating domain (17Houssa B. Schaap D. Wal J.V.D. Goto K. Kondo H. Yamakawa A. Shibata M. Takenawa T. Blitterswijk W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10422-10428Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). In contrast to the accumulated knowledge of molecular structure, the functions and regulatory mechanism of each DGK subtype are still unknown. Recently, we developed a system to monitor the translocation of PKCs fused with GFP in living cells (18Sakai N. Sasaki K. Ikegaki N. Shirai Y. Ono Y. Saito N. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 1465-1476Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Using this system, we demonstrated that each subtype of PKC shows distinct translocation in response to various stimuli, suggesting that each subspecies has a spatially and temporally different targeting mechanism that depends on the extracellular and intracellular signals (19Shirai Y. Kashiwagi K. Yagi K. Sakai N. Saito N. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 511-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 20Ohmori S. Shirai Y. Sakai N. Fujii M. Konishi H. Kikkawa U. Saito N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5263-5271Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, we hypothesize that the subtype-specific targeting of PKC contributes to the subspecies-specific functions. Interestingly, in addition to PKC, translocation of DGK by several stimuli such as phorbol ester (21Ishitoya J. Yamakawa A. Takenawa T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1987; 144: 1025-1030Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 22Maroney A.C. Marara I.G. J. Biol.

Pharmacol. 1997; 53: 1683-1694Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar) has been shown by analysis of immunoblots or of DGK activity, although previous studies concerning the translocation of DGKs have been performed using crude DGKs, and subtype-specific translocation could not be demonstrated. Furthermore, the involvement of PKC in the regulation of activity and localization of DGKα has been described (24Nobe K. Ohata H. Momose K. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1997; 53: 1683-1694Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 25Kanoh H. Ono T. FEBS Lett. 1986; 201: 97-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 26Kanoh H. Yamada K. Sakane F.

Nature. 1998; 394: 697-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). These observations suggest that the translocation of DGKs is an effective process to regulate their activity and subtype-specific functions and that DGKs and PKCs are not only functionally but also temporally and spatially correlated in their signal transduction pathways. In this study, we examined translocations of DGKα and -γ fused with GFP and investigated temporal and spatial correlations between DGK and PKC in addition to their functional correlation. Adenosine triphosphate (ATP), uridine triphosphate (UTP), calcium ionophore A 23187, and tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate (TPA) were purchased from Sigma. Arachidonic acid and 1,2-dioctanoylglycerol (DiC8) were purchased from Doosan Serdary Research Laboratories (Eaglewood Cliffs, NJ) and Biomol Research Laboratories (Plymouth Meeting, PA), respectively. DGK inhibitor (R59022) was a product of Research Biochemicals International. All the other chemicals used were of analytical grade.

The CHO-K1 cell strain was a gift from Dr. Nishijima (National Institute of Health, Tokyo, Japan). COS-7 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, and CHO-K1 cells were cultured in Ham's F-12 medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2. Both media contained 25 mm glucose, and both were buffered with 44 mm NaHCO3 and supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, penicillin (100 units/ml), and streptomycin (100 μg/ml). The fetal bovine serum used was not heat-inactivated. The plasmid bearing cDNA for pig DGKα (designated as BS 585) (10Sakane F. Yamada K. Kanoh H. Yokoyama C. Tanabe T.

U. S. A. 1994; 91: 13042-13046Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) as the template. The sense and antisense primers were 5′-AACTCGAGAAGATGAGTGACGGGCAATGG-3′ and 5′-TTCCCGGGAGTCCTTTGAACGGCTTTTCCT-3′, respectively. The PCR product of DGKγ was first subcloned into a TA cloning vector, pCRTM2.1 (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA). The plasmid was designated as BS465. The cDNA encoding DGKγ in BS465 was digested with XhoI and SmaI then subcloned into the XhoI andSmaI site in pEGFPN1 (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA) or SalI and SmaI site in pEGFPC1 (CLONTECH) (BS470 and BS561, respectively). Similarly, a cDNA fragment of pig DGKα with an XhoI site in the 5′-terminus and a SmaI site in the 3′-terminus was produced by PCR with BS585 as the template and subcloned into a TA cloning vector, pCRTM 2.1 (BS597). Finally, the DGKα was subcloned into the SalI and SmaI site in pEGFPC1 (BS606). Site-directed mutagenesis was performed according to the manufacturer's recommended protocol with ExSite PCR-based site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA), using BS465 as a template. The sense and antisense primers for producing a mutant DGKγ whose Cys-285 in C1A domain was substituted to Gly (C1A mutant) were 5′-GCCACATCATGCTGATGGGC-3′ and 5′-CAAAGTTGCAGTAAGTGGGCTT-3′, respectively. The primers for a mutant DGKγ, whose Cys-348 in the C1B region was substituted to Gly (C1B mutant), were 5′-GCCACAAAAGTATCAAGTGCTAC-3′ and 5′-CACGGTCACACTTGACGGA-3′. Mutagenesis was confirmed by verifying sequences. Each C1A or C1B mutant of DGKγ cDNA was subcloned into SalI andSmaI sites in pEGFPC1, as in the case of BS561 (designated BS691 and BS692, respectively). Plasmids (approximately 32 μg) encoding each subtype of DGKs or their GFP fusion proteins were transfected into 6 × 106 COS 7 cells using a Gene Pulser (Bio-Rad, 960 μF, 220 V). After being cultured for 2 days, the cells were harvested with PBS(−) and centrifuged. The cell pellet was resuspended in 300 μl of homogenate buffer (250 mm sucrose, 10 mm EGTA, 2 mm EDTA, 50 mm Tris/HCl, 200 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1% Triton X-100, pH 7.4). After the sonication (UD-210 TOMY, Japan; output 3, duty 50%, 10 times, at 4 °C), samples were collected for immunoblotting and kinase assay. For immunoblotting, the samples were subjected to 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, followed by blotting onto a polyvinylidine difluoride membrane (Millipore, Bedford, MA). Nonspecific binding sites were blocked by incubation with 5% skim milk in 0.01 m phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4 (PBS) for 18 h at 4 °C. The membrane was then incubated with anti-DGKγ antibodies (diluted 1: 1000) (12Goto K. Fukuyama M. Kondo H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 13042-13046Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) or anti-GFP antibody (CLONTECH) for 1 h at room temperature. After washing with 0.01 m PBS containing 0.03% Triton X-100 (PBS-T), the membrane was incubated with peroxidase-labeled anti-rabbit IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, West Grove, PA) for 30 min. After three rinses with PBS-T, the immunoreactive bands were visualized using a chemiluminescence detection kit (ECL, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). To determine the kinase activity, appropriate volumes of the homogenate samples described above were subjected to octyl glucoside mixed-micelle assay (29Preiss J. Loomis C.R. Bishop W.R. Stein R. Niedel J.E. Bell R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 8597-8600Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The amount of each sample subjected to kinase assay was determined based on the amount of DGKs or their fusion proteins assessed by immunoblotting. 1-Steroyl-2-arachidonoyl-sn-glycerol was used as a substrate. The radioactivity of phosphatidyl acid was separated on a 20-cm Silica Gel 60 (Merck) thin layer chromatography plate using a chloroform:methanol:acetic acid (65:15:5) solution and detected by BAS 2000 (Fujix, Tokyo, Japan). Plasmids (approximately 5.5 μg) were transfected into 1.0 × 106 cells by lipofection using TransITTM-20 (Mirus Co., Madison, WI) according to the manufacturer's standard protocol. After being cultured at 37 °C for 16–24 h, the cells were spread onto glass-bottom culture dishes (MatTek Corp., Ashland, MA). Experiments were performed 16–48 h after the transfection. The culture medium was replaced with HEPES buffer composed of 135 mm NaCl, 5.4 mm KCl, 1 mmMgCl2, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 5 mm HEPES, 10 mm glucose, pH 7.3 (Ringer's solution). Translocation of the GFP fusion protein was triggered by a direct application of various stimulants at 10 times higher concentration into the Ringer's solution to obtain the appropriate final concentration. The fluorescence of the fusion protein was monitored with a confocal laser-scanning fluorescent microscope (LSM 410 invert, Carl Zeiss, Jena, Germany) at 488-nm argon excitation using a 515–535-nm band pass barrier filter. All experiments were performed at 37 °C. For simultaneous observation of GFP-DGKγ and PKCγ-GFP in the same field, a plasmid-bearing variant, BFP, was co-transfected with PKCγ-GFP into CHO-K1 cells as a marker for detecting PKCγ-GFP-expressing cells. The GFP-DGKγ- or PKCγ-GFP-expressing cells, which were individually transfected, were spread again and mixed into the same glass-bottomed culture dishes. The CHO-K1 cells expressing GFP-DGKγ or PKCγ-GFP were determined based on the fluorescence of BFP. The fluorescence of the BFP was monitored with a confocal laser-scanning fluorescent microscope (LSM 410 invert, Carl Zeiss, Jena, Germany) at 364-nm UV laser excitation using a 397-nm long pass barrier filter, whereas that of GFP was monitored at 488-nm argon excitation using a 515–535-nm band pass barrier filter. After confirming, translocation of GFP-DGKγ or PKCγ-GFP was triggered and observed based on the fluorescence of GFP as described above. Texas red-conjugated wheat germ agglutinin was used to monitor the Golgi network. After induction of the translocation of GFP-DGKα by 100 μm arachidonic acid, the cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and 0.2% picric acid in 0.1 m PBS for 30 min. After washing 3 times with 0.1 m PBS, the fixed cells were treated with PBS containing 0.3% Triton X-100 and 10% normal goat serum for 20 min. The cells were then incubated with 0.5 μg/ml Texas red-conjugated wheat germ agglutinin (Molecular Probes, Leiden, the Netherlands) in PBS-T for 30 min. Finally, the fluorescence of Texas red and GFP were observed under a confocal laser-scanning fluorescent microscope, the former at 588-nm argon excitation using a 590-nm long pass barrier filter and the latter at 488-nm argon excitation using a 510–535-nm band pass barrier filter. Fig. 1 A shows constructs of two fusion proteins of DGKγ with GFP. GFP-DGKγ possesses GFP at the N terminus of the protein, whereas GFP is located at the C terminus of DGKγ-GFP. Immunoblotting using the anti-DGKγ antibody revealed that the molecular size of both fusion proteins is about 120 kDa, which is about 30 kDa larger than intact DGKγ (Fig.1 B). Furthermore, no significant degraded products were detected, although nonspecific bands were observed in all lanes. Anti-GFP antibody also recognized the 120-kDa bands of DGKγ-GFP and GFP-DGKγ but not intact DGKγ or other proteins (data not shown). Fig. 1 C shows that GFP-DGKγ had kinase activity as significant as that of intact DGKγ, whereas no activity of DGKγ-GFP was detectable. Therefore, we produced only GFP-DGKα. GFP-DGKα had reasonable molecular mass (about 110 kDa) and showed sufficient kinase activity (data not shown). In the following experiments, GFP-DGKγ and GFP-DGKα were used. When GFP-DGKα and -γ were expressed in CHO-K1 cells, the fluorescence of GFP-DGKγ and GFP-DGKα was observed throughout the cytoplasm and in the nucleus (Figs. 2 and3). The expression level of GFP-DGKγ and GFP-DGKα in the nucleus varied in the cells.Figure 3Translocation of GFP-DGKα. Top row, application of 100 μm ATP induced a translocation of GFP-DGKα from the cytoplasm to the plasma membrane. The translocation was observed within 30 s after the stimulation and quickly re-translocated within 1 min. The fluorescence of GFP-DGKα in the nucleoplasm was not changed in response to ATP. Bar, 10 μm. Second row, significant translocation of DGKα by arachidonic acid (AA) at 100 μm was detected at 30 s. Subsequently, dotty fluorescence accumulated in the nucleus, and intense fluorescence was detected near the nucleus at 12 min.Bar, 10 μm. Third row, TPA exerted no effects on the localization of GFP-DGKα in either the cytoplasm or the nucleoplasm. Bar, 10 μm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) As a result of stimulation with 100 μm ATP, DGKγ in the cytoplasm was translocated to the plasma membrane within 0.5–1 min and returned to the cytoplasm within 5–10 min (Fig. 2,top row). As a result of stimulation with 100 μm arachidonic acid, DGKγ in the cytoplasm was translocated to the plasma membrane within 30 s and returned to cytoplasm within 12 min, which was similar to ATP-induced translocation (Fig. 2, middle row). However, these stimuli exerted no effect on DGKγ in the nucleus. Activation by 1 μm TPA induced obvious translocation of DGKγ from the cytoplasm to the membrane (Fig. 2, bottom row). The TPA-induced translocation began within 30 s and remained on the plasma membrane for at least 60 min after the treatment. The TPA-induced translocation was not inhibited by staurosporine, an inhibitor for protein kinases (data not shown). In contrast to DGKγ, the effects of these stimuli on the translocation of DGKα were quite distinct. TPA caused no translocation of DGKα, unlike DGKγ, and ATP-induced translocation of DGKα occurred in 30 s and returned in 2 min, which meant that it occurred and was completed earlier than DGKγ (Fig. 3,top and bottom rows). Arachidonic acid at 100 μm translocated DGKα in the cytoplasm to the perinuclear area in addition to the plasma membrane (Fig. 3,middle row). Furthermore, DGKα in the nucleus was also affected by arachidonic acid. DGKα showed dot-like accumulation within the nucleus 3 min after arachidonic acid stimulation (Fig. 3,middle). Occasionally, DGKα was translocated from the nucleoplasm to the nuclear membrane during the late phase of the arachidonic acid-induced translocation (data not shown). To identify the intracellular compartment in which GFP-DGKα accumulated in response to arachidonic acid, the Golgi network was visualized by Texas red-conjugated wheat germ agglutinin in the CHO-K1 cells expressing GFP-DGKα after arachidonic acid treatment. Intense GFP fluorescence was present on the plasma membrane and perinuclear area (Fig. 4,left). Fluorescence of Texas red was present around the nucleus, indicating the Golgi network and also the plasma membrane due to glycosylated transmembrane proteins (Fig. 4, center). An overlapping image shows that the fluorescence of Texas-red and of GFP were co-localized in the perinuclear region (Fig. 4,right). Two mutants of DGKγ fused with GFP were produced. In one mutant, Cys-285 in the C1A region was replaced by Gly (C1A mutant), and in the other mutant, Cys-348 in the C1B region was substituted with Gly (C1B mutant). Both mutants showed unique localization when expressed in CHO-K1 cells. Unlike intact DGKγ, in almost of the cells, intense fluorescence was present throughout the cytoplasm with faint fluorescence in the nucleus (Fig. 5). TPA at 1 μm induced irreversible translocation of the C1B mutant similar to that of intact DGKγ. In contrast, the C1A mutant was not translocated in response to TPA. For the purpose of clarifying spatial and temporal correlations between DGKγ and PKCγ, their ATP-induced translocations were compared. To distinguish DGKγ and PKCγ, both cDNA of PKCγ-GFP and variant BFP were simultaneously transfected into the CHO-K1 cells and spread into a glass-bottomed dish together with the CHO-K1 cells that were separately transfected with GFP-DGKγ alone. Accordingly, blue with slight green fluorescence and bright green fluorescence in Fig. 6 showed the CHO-K1 cells expressing PKCγ and DGKγ, respectively. Intense fluorescence of PKCγ-GFP was observed throughout the cytoplasm with faint fluorescent in the nucleus. As a result of stimulation with 100 μm ATP, PKCγ was translocated from the cytoplasm to the plasma membrane at 10 s after the stimulation, and translocation was most significant at 30 s. Then, PKCγ was re-translocated within 1 min. In contrast to PKCγ, the translocation of DGKγ was initiated around 30 s after the stimulation and was seen most significantly at 2 min. Finally, DGKγ was re-translocated at 5 min. However, there was no significant difference in the time course of ATP-induced translocations of GFP-DGKα and PKCγ-GFP (data not shown). Effects of co-expression of DGKγ and of a DGK inhibitor on the translocation of PKCγ-GFP were investigated. Fig. 7shows the translocation of PKCγ-GFP in different conditions. In normal conditions, after simultaneous application of 10 μm DiC8, and 1 μm calcium ionophore A23187, PKCγ-GFP was translocated from the cytoplasm to the plasma membrane within 2 min and restored within 8 min (Fig. 7 B). When co-expressed with DGKγ, the same stimulation induced translocation of PKCγ-GFP within 20 s, but PKCγ-GFP was quickly re-translocated from the membrane to the cytoplasm, which was completed by 2 min (Fig.7 A). On the other hand, in the presence of R59022 (a DGK inhibitor), re-translocation of PKCγ-GFP was significantly inhibited, although the initiation of the translocation was not altered (Fig.7 C). Inhibitors for PKC did not alter the translocation of DGKγ induced by ATP, arachidonic acid, or TPA (data not shown). It has been shown that both PKCγ and DGKγ are abundantly expressed in Purkinje cells (12Goto K. Fukuyama M. Kondo H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 13042-13046Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 30Kose A. Saito N. Ito H. Kikkawa U. Nishizuka Y. Tanaka C. J. Neurosci. 1988; 8: 4262-4268Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and possess not only cysteine-rich regions but also calcium-sensitive domains (2Topham M.K. Prescott S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11447-11450Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). These findings suggest a functional correlation between this DG-dependent kinase and DG-catalyzing kinase. DGKα has a very similar enzymological character to that of DGKγ but shows glial expression in the brain (11Goto K. Kondo H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 7598-7602Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar), suggesting that each DGK subtype has a specific function. Thus, we chose DGKα and -γ to study the different functions among many DGK subtypes. Although GFP is a useful tool as a marker protein, it should be verified that each GFP fusion protein has the same biological properties as its native protein. Especially, to judge the movement of the fusion protein by GFP fluorescence, it is necessary to confirm that no significant cleavage product of the fusion protein is present. We, therefore, produced two types of fusion proteins, DGKγ-GFP and GFP-DGKγ, and compared their enzymological and immunological properties with native DGKγ. Both DGKγ-GFP and GFP-DGKγ were of appropriate sizes, since the molecular weights of DGKγ and GFP are 88 and 27 kDa, respectively (Fig. 1 B), and no significant degraded products were detected by either anti-DGKγ or GFP antibodies, although nonspecific bands were observed with anti-DGKγ antibody. Unexpectedly, DGKγ-GFP showed no kinase activity, whereas the activity of GFP-DGKγ was almost the same as that of native DGKγ (Fig. 1 C). This suggests that the C terminus of DGKγ may play an important role in its activity. Previously, we confirmed that both GFP-PKCγ and PKCγ-GFP showed similar kinase activity to that of intact PKCγ (18Sakai N. Sasaki K. Ikegaki N. Shirai Y. Ono Y. Saito N. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 1465-1476Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). These results indicate that it depends on the property of each protein whether GFP is attached at the N or C terminus of the protein. Based on the finding that only GFP-DGKγ had kinase activity, we can assume that GFP was fused to the N terminus of DGKα. GFP-DGKα was recognized as the 110-kDa band, which is a suitable size because DGKα is an 80-kDa protein and has enough kinase activity (data not shown). To date, we have accumulated knowledge concerning translocations of PKCs in CHO-K1 cells (19Shirai Y. Kashiwagi K. Yagi K. Sakai N. Saito N. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 511-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 20Ohmori S. Shirai Y. Sakai N. Fujii M. Konishi H. Kikkawa U. Saito N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5263-5271Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 31Shirai Y. Kashiwagi K. Sakai K. Saito N. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 1335-1343PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, translocation of DGK by several stimuli such as phorbol ester (21Ishitoya J. Yamakawa A. Takenawa T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1987; 144: 1025-1030Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 22Maroney A.C. Marara I.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 2537-2544Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), calcium (23Sakane F. Yamada K. Imai S. Kanoh H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 7096-7100Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and also receptor-mediated translocation (24Nobe K. Ohata H. Momose K. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1997; 53: 1683-1694Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar) have so far been reported. Therefore, the effects of TPA (a phorbol ester), calcium ionophore (A23187), and ATP as an agonist of purinergic receptors expressed in CHO-K1 cells (32Iredale P.A. Hill S.J. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1993; 110: 1305-1310Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) on the translocation of GFP-DGKγ and GFP-DGKα were examined in CHO-K1 cells. Moreover, the effect of arachidonic acid was examined based on the finding that fatty acids induce distinct translocation among PKC subtypes (19Shirai Y. Kashiwagi K. Yagi K. Sakai N. Saito N. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 511-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Calcium ionophore at 20 μm induced generally similar translocations between GFP-DGKγ and GFP-DGKα. Namely, both DGK fusion proteins in the cytoplasm moved to the plasma membrane at 10–15 s after the ionophore stimulation and were finally restored to the cytoplasm (data not shown). In contrast, ATP, TPA, and arachidonic acid showed distinct effects on the translocations of DGKγ and -α, as described above (Figs. 2 and 3). This is the first report visualizing the subtype-specific translocation of DGKα and -γ in living cells. Although DGKs have cysteine-rich regions homologous to the C1A and C1B motifs of PKCs, phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate binding in DGKs, unlike PKCs, has never been detected (2Topham M.K. Prescott S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11447-11450Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar, 33Houssa B. Blitterswijk W.J. Biochem. J. 1998; 331: 677-679Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Recently, Hurley et al.(34Hurley J.H. Newton A.C. Paker P.J. Blumberg P.M. Nishizuka Y. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 477-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar) compared amino acid sequences of C1 domains of many proteins, including PKCs (α, β, γ, δ, ε, η, θ, ζ and μ) and DGKs (α, β, γ, δ, ε, and ζ), and divided them into two groups, typical and atypical. C1 domains in the typical group fit the profile for phorbol ester binding, whereas those in the atypical did not. According to Hurley et al. (34Hurley J.H. Newton A.C. Paker P.J. Blumberg P.M. Nishizuka Y. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 477-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar), DGK C1 domains have no property to bind DG and TPA except for C1A regions in DGKγ and β. Therefore, to elucidate whether the C1A region is responsible for TPA-induced translocation of DGKγ, we investigated the translocation of the two mutants. Based on a previous report that mutation on the 17th cysteine in the C1B of PKCδ completely abolished its phorbol ester binding (35Kazanietz M.G. Wang S. Miline G.W.A. Lewin N.E. Liu H.L. Blumberg P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21852-21859Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar), Cys-285 in the C1A region or Cys-348 in the C1B region were replaced by Gly, which corresponds to the 17th cysteine in the C1B region of PKCδ. The C1B mutant showed TPA-induced irreversible translocation, whereas the C1A mutant was not translocated in response to TPA (Fig. 5), indicating that interaction between TPA and the C1A domain of DGKγ resulted in the translocation. Together with the results showing that DGKα does not respond to TPA, these results support Hurley's classification. Among the C1 domains in Hurley's typical group, those of PKCs can be further divided into two subgroups based on the data from Irie et al. (36Irie K. Oie K. Nakahara A. Yanai Y. Ohigashi H. Wender P.A. Fukuda H. Konishi H Kikkawa U. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1998; 120: 9159-9167Crossref Scopus (141) Google Scholar). C1B of all conventional and novel PKCs have a high affinity binding to phorbol ester, whereas all their C1A domains except for the C1A of PKCγ show very low affinity. Since phorbol ester binding of DGK has not been detected in vitro, the C1A domain of DGKγ is thought to belong to the low affinity group. More interestingly, arachidonic acid induced the translocation of C1A mutant but not the C1B mutant of DGKγ (data not shown). These results indicate not only that the loss of TPA-induced translocation observed in the C1A mutant is not due to the loss of translocation ability but also that the domain interacting with arachidonic acid differs from that interacting with TPA. Alternatively, Cys-285 in C1A domain of DGKγ may be unnecessary for arachidonic acid binding. When expressed in the CHO-K1 cells, both GFP-DGKγ and GFP-DGKα were observed in the cytoplasm and the nucleoplasm, although the expression level of the fusion proteins in the nucleoplasm varied from cell to cell. The percentage of cells expressing the fusion protein in the nucleoplasm increased during the culture (data not shown). In contrast, both mutants of DGKγ were detected mainly in the cytoplasm, and a significantly low amount of the mutant was expressed in the nucleus. Since neither mutant showed a significant kinase activity (data not shown), kinase activity may be necessary for expression of DGKγ and -α in the nucleoplasm or for their translocation into the nucleoplasm. Alternatively, the different localization of the C1 mutants may be due to loss of interaction with an unknown protein, because it was suggested that the C1 region of DGK is important for protein-protein interaction (2Topham M.K. Prescott S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11447-11450Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). Furthermore, despite a lack of kinase activity, the mutants showed translocation, indicating that kinase activity is not necessary for the translocation of DGK, as seen in the translocations of PKCs (18Sakai N. Sasaki K. Ikegaki N. Shirai Y. Ono Y. Saito N. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 1465-1476Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar, 20Ohmori S. Shirai Y. Sakai N. Fujii M. Konishi H. Kikkawa U. Saito N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5263-5271Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It is also noteworthy that GFP-DGKγ, but not GFP-DGKα, showed a similar translocation to that of PKCγ-GFP. For example, PKCγ-GFP and GFP-DGKγ were translocated to the plasma membrane reversibly by arachidonic acid (Fig. 2 and 19), whereas GFP-DGKα was targeted to the Golgi network in addition to the plasma membrane (Fig. 4). TPA caused translocation of both GFP-DGKγ and PKCγ-GFP but not GFP-DGKα. Furthermore, DGKγ and PKCγ showed spatially similar but temporally different translocations after purinergic receptor activation (Fig. 6). This phenomenon may indicate a functional correlation of the two kinases, because PKC is probably translocated to the plasma membrane before DGK is targeted there, so PKC is activated by DG for a long time. In other words, the time lag between the translocation of DGK and PKC may regulate the duration of PKC activation. In fact, co-expression of DGKγ hastens the re-translocation of PKCγ from the membrane to the cytoplasma, and the inhibitor of DGK blocked the re-translocation of PKCγ (Fig. 7), indicating clearly the functional correlation of DGK and PKC. Further experiments, however, are necessary to conclude that the temporal and spatial orchestration of PKCγ and DGKγ occurred in vivo,i.e. in Purkinje cells in which both kinases are abundantly expressed. In the present study, we could not find any evidence that PKC directly regulates the translocation of DGK, although the direct phosphorylation of DGK by PKC was reported previously. For example, Kanoh et al. (25Kanoh H. Ono T. FEBS Lett. 1986; 201: 97-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 26Kanoh H. Yamada K. Sakane F. Imaizumi T. Biochem. J. 1989; 258: 455-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) report in vitro and in vivophosphorylation of DGK by PKC, and Nobe et al. (24Nobe K. Ohata H. Momose K. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1997; 53: 1683-1694Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar) also show that phosphorylation of DGK by PKC increased kinase affinity to the micell. Furthermore, Topham et al. (27Topham M.K. Bunting M. Zimmerman G.A. McIntyre T.M. Blackshear P.J. Prescott S.M. Nature. 1998; 394: 697-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar) indicate that PKCα and -ζ regulated nuclear localization of DGKζ. However, in the present study, treatment with staurosporine, a PKC inhibitor, exerted no effect on the initial localization or on any translocation of the two subtypes of DGKs (data not shown). Further experiments are required to elucidate the regulatory mechanism of DGK by PKC. In conclusion, we demonstrated that DGK as well as PKC shows subtype-specific translocation and that translocation depends on extracellular signals and contributes to the regulation of DGK activity and its subtype-specific function, although the significance of this study may be limited because of using overexpressed enzymes. Our results suggested that functionally correlated proteins such as PKC and DGK are orchestrated temporally and spatially in the signal transduction mediated via both kinases. We thank Dr. Hideo Kanoh for helpful discussions of our work."
https://openalex.org/W2065754451,"FUI1 and function unknown now 26 (FUN26) are proteins of uncertain function with sequence similarities to members of the uracil/allantoin permease and equilibrative nucleoside transporter families of transporter proteins, respectively. [3H]Uridine influx was eliminated by disruption of the gene encoding FUI1 (fui1) and restored by expression of FUI1 cDNA, whereas influx in transport-competent andfui1-negative yeast were unaffected, respectively, by disruption of the FUN26 gene or overexpression of FUN26 cDNA. FUI1 transported uridine with high affinity (K m , 22 ± 3 μm) and was unaffected or inhibited only partially by high concentrations (1 mm) of a variety of ribo- and deoxyribonucleosides or nucleobases. When FUN26 cDNA was expressed in oocytes of Xenopus laevis, inward fluxes of [3H]uridine, [3H]adenosine, and [3H]cytidine were stimulated, and uridine influx was independent of pH and not inhibited by dilazep, dipyridamole, or nitrobenzylmercaptopurine ribonucleoside. Fractionation of yeast membranes containing immunotagged recombinant FUN26 (shown to be functional in oocytes) demonstrated that the protein was primarily in intracellular membranes. These results indicated that FUI1 has high selectivity for uracil-containing ribonucleosides and imports uridine across cell-surface membranes, whereas FUN26 has broad nucleoside selectivity and most likely functions to transport nucleosides across intracellular membranes. FUI1 and function unknown now 26 (FUN26) are proteins of uncertain function with sequence similarities to members of the uracil/allantoin permease and equilibrative nucleoside transporter families of transporter proteins, respectively. [3H]Uridine influx was eliminated by disruption of the gene encoding FUI1 (fui1) and restored by expression of FUI1 cDNA, whereas influx in transport-competent andfui1-negative yeast were unaffected, respectively, by disruption of the FUN26 gene or overexpression of FUN26 cDNA. FUI1 transported uridine with high affinity (K m , 22 ± 3 μm) and was unaffected or inhibited only partially by high concentrations (1 mm) of a variety of ribo- and deoxyribonucleosides or nucleobases. When FUN26 cDNA was expressed in oocytes of Xenopus laevis, inward fluxes of [3H]uridine, [3H]adenosine, and [3H]cytidine were stimulated, and uridine influx was independent of pH and not inhibited by dilazep, dipyridamole, or nitrobenzylmercaptopurine ribonucleoside.

Among the earliest examples of transport systems genetically identified in Saccharomyces cerevisiae were those responsible for the uptake of purine and pyrimidine nucleosides and nucleobases (5Grenson M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1969; 11: 249-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 6Jund R. Lacroute F. J. Bacteriol. 1970; 102: 607-615Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Whereas a great deal is now known about the proteins (FUR4, FCY2) responsible for nucleobase transport in S. cerevisiae, there is, as yet, little information about the proteins responsible for nucleoside transport. Although S. cerevisiae appears to lack the capacity for salvage of purine nucleosides and thymidine from the external environment, import of uridine across the cell surface has been observed in this organism (5Grenson M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1969; 11: 249-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 6Jund R. Lacroute F. J. Bacteriol. 1970; 102: 607-615Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A nucleoside-specific vacuolar transport process with selectivity for adenosine and guanosine has also been identified in S. cerevisiae (7Nagy M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1979; 558: 221-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). The molecular identity of these transport proteins has not, as yet, been unambiguously identified (7Nagy M. Biochim. Biophys.

A variety of nucleoside transporters of higher (Homo sapiensand Rattus norvegicus) and lower (Escherichia coli) organisms have recently been identified by molecular cloning and functional expression in Xenopus laevis oocytes (9Yao S.Y.

Mammalian nucleoside transporters comprise two functionally and structurally distinct families, the concentrative nucleoside transporter (CNT1), and equilibrative nucleoside transporter (ENT) proteins. CNTs mediate Na+-dependent symport of nucleosides against their concentration gradients and are predicted to possess 8–14 transmembrane-spanning domains, with 13 favored (17Baldwin S.A. Mackey J.R. Cass C.E. Young J.D. Mol. Med. Today. 1999; 5: 216-224Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). Thus far, two CNT subtypes, the pyrimidine-nucleoside selective (CNT1) and purine-nucleoside selective (CNT2) transporters, have been identified in mammalian tissues (10Yao S.Y. Ng A.M. Ritzel M.W.

ENTs mediate bidirectional transport of nucleosides down their concentration gradients and are predicted to possess 11 transmembrane-spanning domains with large cytoplasmic loops between transmembrane-spanning domains 1 and 2 and 6 and 7. Two broadly selective ENT subtypes, which are subdivided based on their sensitivity (ENT1) or resistance (ENT2) to inhibition by nmconcentrations of nitrobenzylmercaptopurine ribonucleoside (NBMPR), have been identified in both human (h) and rat (r) cells by molecular cloning (9Yao S.Y.

Hogue D.L. Cass C.E. Biochem. J. 1992; 288: 987-996Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) and organellar membranes including mitochondria (20Camins A. Jimenez A. Sureda F.X. Pallas M.

Chem. 1989; 264: 4850-4856Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Data base analysis of the S. cerevisiae genome indicated that the protein encoded by the yeast open reading frame YAL022c, termed FUN26 (function unknown now 26), shares limited amino acid identity (∼18%) with hENT1 and hENT2 (14Griffiths M. Yao S.Y. Abidi F. Phillips S.E. Cass C.E. Young J.D. Baldwin S.A. Biochem. J. 1997; 328: 739-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar, 15Griffiths M. Beaumont N. Yao S.Y. Sundaram M. Boumah C.E. Davies A. Kwong F.Y. Coe I. Cass C.E. Young J.D. Baldwin S.A. Nat. Med. 1997; 3: 89-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). These observations suggested that FUN26 is a functional member of the ENT family of transporter proteins. FUN26, which was identified as a result of the sequencing of chromosome 1 of S. cerevisiae (23Barton A.B. Kaback D.B. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 1872-1880Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), does not share sequence similarity with other yeast proteins and is predicted to have 517 amino acids (58.3 kDa) with 11 transmembrane-spanning domains, a large hydrophilic N-terminal tail (76 amino acids) and two large hydrophilic regions between transmembrane-spanning domains 1 and 2 (19 amino acids) and 6 and 7 (78 amino acids). FUN26 is not an essential protein because disruption of the gene (YAL022c) was not lethal (23Barton A.B. Kaback D.B. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 1872-1880Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). FUI1 is a yeast protein, unrelated to FUN26, that has also recently been suggested to be a putative nucleoside transporter (8Wagner R. de Montigny J. de Wergifosse P. Souciet J.L. Potier S. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1998; 159: 69-75Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The locus encoding FUI1 (YBL042c), which is on chromosome 2, was originally identified from a mutant with increased resistance to the cytotoxic nucleoside analog 5-fluorouridine (6Jund R. Lacroute F. J. Bacteriol. 1970; 102: 607-615Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). FUI1 is predicted to be a protein of 639 amino acids (72 kDa) with 10 transmembrane-spanning domains. The increased resistance to 5-fluorouridine of thefui1-disruption mutant led to the suggestion that FUI1 is a uridine transporter (8Wagner R. de Montigny J. de Wergifosse P. Souciet J.L. Potier S. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1998; 159: 69-75Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and computer-assisted classification and functional assignment of known, and predicted, yeast facilitators placed FUI1 in the “uracil/allantoin” permease family (24Nelissen B. Mordant P. Jonniaux J.L. De Wachter R. Goffeau A. FEBS Lett. 1995; 377: 232-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 25Nelissen B. De Wachter R. Goffeau A. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 1997; 21: 113-134Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). FUI1 shares 70 and 69% amino acid similarity with FUR4 (uracil permease) and DAL4 (allantoin permease), respectively. There is, as yet, no direct evidence that FUI1 encodes a membrane transporter with selectivity for uridine and/or uracil. The present work was undertaken to determine the roles of FUN26 and FUI1 in the transport of uridine and other nucleosides in S. cerevisiae. Their involvement in the import of extracellular uridine was assessed by analysis of the effects of disruption of the FUN26 and FUI1 genes by insertional mutagenesis and reintroduction of the intact coding sequences in the pYES2 yeast expression vector on (i) 5-fluorouridine and 5-fluorouracil toxicities in plating studies, and (ii) inward fluxes of [3H]uridine alone and in the presence of high concentrations (≥1 mm) of a variety of nucleosides and nucleobases. FUI1 exhibited high affinity and selectivity for uridine and was shown to be the protein responsible for inwardly directed transport of uridine into S. cerevisiae. Expression of the FUN26 cDNA failed to confer uridine transport capability on yeast with the fui1 gene disruptions and was, therefore, tested in oocytes of X. laevis, because of the proven effectiveness of the latter system in the identification of nucleoside transport proteins (9Yao S.Y.

Baldwin S.A. Nat. Med. 1997; 3: 89-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). The functional characteristics of recombinant FUN26 produced in oocytes established that FUN26 accepts both purine and pyrimidine nucleosides, but not nucleobases, as permeants. A broadly selective nucleoside transport process has been described in yeast vacuolar membranes (7Nagy M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1979; 558: 221-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). To determine if FUN26 localizes to internal membranes, the protein was tagged with the c-Myc immunoepitope, and yeast membrane fractions prepared by continuous sucrose gradient centrifugation were analyzed for the presence of recombinant FUN26myc by immunoblotting. The results presented here indicated separate roles of FUI1 and FUN26 in uridine metabolism, with FUI1 mediating uptake of uridine from the extracellular environment and FUN26-mediating uptake and/or release of uridine (and other nucleosides) from intracellular compartments. KY114 (MATa, gal, ura3–52, trp1, lys2, ade2, hisd2000) was the parental yeast strain used throughout. Polymerase chain reaction-mediated one-step gene disruption yeast mutants were generated by the method of Baudin (26Baudin A. Ozier-Kalogeropoulos O. Denouel A. Lacroute F. Cullin C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 3329-3330Crossref PubMed Scopus (1112) Google Scholar). Other strains were generated by transformation of the yeast/E. coli shuttle vector pYES2 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) into KY114 using a standard lithium acetate method (27Ito H. Fukuda Y. Murata K. Kimura A. J. Bacteriol. 1983; 153: 163-168Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). cDNA inserts were under transcriptional control of the inducible GAL1 promoter wherein the promoter was either induced or repressed using galactose or glucose as carbon sources, respectively. Yeast strains were maintained in complete minimal medium (CMM) containing 0.67% yeast nitrogen base (Difco, Detroit, MI), amino acids (as required to maintain auxotrophic selection) and either 2% glucose (CMM/GLU) or 2% galactose (CMM/GAL). Agar plates contained CMM with various supplements and 2% agar (Difco, Detroit, MI). Plasmids were propagated in the E. colistrain TOP10F' (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) and maintained in Luria broth (28Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) with ampicillin (50 μg/ml). The FUI1 open reading frame was inserted into the yeast expression vector pYES2 to generate pYFUI1 using the primers (restriction sites underlined) 5′-FUI1sacI (5′-GCTGAG CTC ATG CCG GTA TCT GAT TCT GG-3′) and 3′-FUI1sphI (5′-GCA GCA TGC TTA GAT ATA TCG TAT CTT TTC ATA GC-3′). The FUN26 open reading frame was inserted into pYES2 to generate pYFUN26 using the primers (restriction sites underlined) 5′-FUNkpnI (5′-GCTGGT ACC ATG AGT ACT AGT GCG GAC ACT G-3′) and 3′-FUNsphI (5′-GCA GCA TGC CTA CCT GAT AAT AAA GTC AAT TAT G-3′). A version of FUN26 with the c-Myc immunoepitope at its C terminus was engineered to allow detection of the recombinant protein by immunoblotting. pYFUN26myc was generated using the primers (restriction sites underlined) 5′-FUNkpnI and 3′-FUNmyc (5′-GCA GCA TGCCTA CAA GTC CTC TTC AGA AAT GAG CTT TTG CTC CCT GAT AAT AAA GTC AAT TAT GAA G-3′). Chromosomal DNA from KY114, prepared as described previously (29Ausubel, F. M., Brent, R., Kingston, R. E., Moore, D. D., Seidman, J. G., Smith, J. A., and Struhl, K. (eds) (1997) Current Protocols in Molecular Biology (Chanda, V. B., ed) Vol. 3, pp. 13.10.5—13.10.7, John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New YorkGoogle Scholar), was used as the template for all polymerase chain reaction amplification reactions. The FUN26 gene disruption plasmid pYFUN26-HIS3 was generated by subcloning the blunted-HIS3(BamHI) fragment from pJJ215 into the blunted XhoI/PstI sites of pYFUN26. The FUI1 gene disruption plasmid was generated by subcloning the blunted TRP1(BglII) fragment from pAS5 (30Williams J.B. Lanahan A.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 213: 325-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) into the blunted BglII/AflI sites of pYFUI1. pAS5 and pJJ215 were generous gifts of Dr. B. Lemire, University of Alberta, Edmonton, AB. For functional expression of FUN26 and FUI1 mRNA in oocytes of X. laevis, the FUN26 and FUI1 open reading frames were subcloned into the Xenopus oocyte expression vector pSP64T (31Krieg P.A. Melton D.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 12: 7057-7070Crossref PubMed Scopus (1079) Google Scholar) immediately downstream of the Xenopus β-globin 5′-untranslated region and immediately upstream of theXenopus β-globin 3′-untranslated region, generating pGFUN26 and pGFUI1, respectively. The fidelity of all cDNA constructs was confirmed by sequencing the cDNA inserts, and the regions of the plasmids that included the cloning sites by standard cycle sequencing using an automated 310 Genetic Analyzer (PE Biosystems, Foster City, CA.) Yeast membranes were prepared by a previously described method (32Vickers M.F. Mani R.S. Sundaram M. Hogue D.L. Young J.D. Baldwin S.A. Cass C.E. Biochem. J. 1999; 339: 21-32Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) in which yeast were grown to an optical density at 600 nm (A 600) of 0.8–1.5, collected by centrifugation (500 × g, 5 min, 4 °C), washed three times with breaking buffer (10 mm Tris, 1 mmEDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.1% (v/v) 2-mercaptoethanol, pH 7.4) that contained protease inhibitors (complete protease inhibitors, Roche Molecular Biochemicals), and lysed by vortexing in the presence of glass beads (425–600 μm, Sigma-Aldrich Canada Ltd., Oakville, ON) for 15 min at 4 °C. Unbroken cells and glass beads were removed from lysates by centrifugation (500 ×g, 5 min, 4 °C), and membrane fractions were obtained by centrifugation of lysates (100,000 × g, 60 min, 4 °C). The resulting membrane pellets were resuspended in breaking buffer that contained protease inhibitors. The samples were either used immediately or frozen (−80 °C) in breaking buffer. Yeast membranes prepared as described above were fractionated on a continuous sucrose gradient as described elsewhere (33Sekler I. Kopito R. Casey J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21028-21034Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 34Villalba J.M. Palmgren M.G. Berberian G.E. Ferguson C. Serrano R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12341-12349Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, yeast crude membranes were layered on a 20 (w/w) to 53% (w/w) continuous sucrose gradient followed by centrifugation (18 h, 150,000 × g, 4 °C), and 1-ml portions of the gradient were removed and further centrifuged (60 min, 180,000 × g, 4 °C). The proteins present in the membranes (pellet) were separated electrophoretically and analyzed by immunoblotting (see below). Yeast membranes that had been solubilized in urea were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (35Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206597) Google Scholar), after which proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene fluoride membranes (Immobilon-P, Millipore, Bedford, MA) that were subjected to the following treatments at 4 °C: (i) incubation in TTBS (0.2% Tween-20, Tris-buffered saline) containing 5% (w/v) skim milk powder, (ii) incubation in TTBS with the primary antibody and 1% (w/v) skim milk powder, (iii) washing with TTBS, (iv) incubation with TTBS-containing species-specific horseradish-peroxidase secondary antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories Inc., West Grove, PA) and 1% (w/v) skim milk powder, (v) washing with TTBS, and (vi) visualization with enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and autoradiography. The primary antibodies used were 9E10 (anti-c-Myc, BAbCo, Richmond, CA.), PEP12 (prevacuolar marker, a generous gift of Dr. D. Hogue, B.C. Cancer Agency, Vancouver, B.C.) (36Darsow T. Burd C.G.

The uptake of3H-nucleosides (purchased from Moravek Biochemicals, Brea, CA) by logarithmically proliferating yeast was measured as described previously (32Vickers M.F. Mani R.S. Sundaram M. Hogue D.L. Young J.D. Baldwin S.A. Cass C.E. Biochem. J. 1999; 339: 21-32Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) using the “oil stop” method (38Harley E.R. Paterson A.R. Cass C.E. Cancer Res. 1982; 42: 1289-1295PubMed Google Scholar, 39Hogue D.L. Hodgson K.C. Cass C.E. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1990; 68: 199-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) with the following modifications. Yeast were grown in CMM/GLU or CMM/GAL to anA 600 of 0.8–1.5, washed three times with fresh medium, and resuspended to an A 600 of 4. Transport reactions (conducted at room temperatures) were initiated by the rapid addition of 100-μl portions of yeast cultures to 100-μl portions of transport medium that contained3H-permeant and had been layered on a cushion of oil in a 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tube. Transport was terminated by centrifuging (12,000 × g, 2 min, room temperature) yeast cells through the oil. The oil and unincorporated 3H-permeant were removed by aspiration, and the pellets were solubilized with 5% Triton X-100 for determination of the radioactive content by scintillation counting. In vitro synthesized transcripts were prepared from pGFUN26 and pGFUI1 (SP6 MEGAscript Kit Ambion, Austin, TX) in water and injected into isolated mature stage VI oocytes from X. laevis as described previously (40Huang Q.Q. Harvey C.M. Paterson A.R. Cass C.E. Young J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20613-20619Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Mock-injected oocytes were injected with water alone. Inward fluxes of 3H-nucleosides (Moravek Biochemicals, Brea, CA) were measured by conventional tracer techniques (40Huang Q.Q. Harvey C.M. Paterson A.R. Cass C.E. Young J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20613-20619Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). FUI1, which was identified genetically as a uridine transporter (6Jund R. Lacroute F. J.

Rev. 1997; 21: 113-134Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The high degree of sequence identity with DAL4 (allantoin permease), FUR4 (uracil permease), THI10 (thiamine permease), and three open reading frames that encode putative thiamine permeases suggested a functional relationship between FUI1 and the uracil/allantoin permeases. FUN26, the protein of unknown function predicted from the YAL022c open reading frame, has limited (∼18%) amino acid sequence identity with members of the ENT family of nucleoside transporters. The limited sequence identity of FUN26 with ENT proteins, first noted when the hENT1 and hENT2 cDNAs were cloned and functionally expressed (14Griffiths M. Yao S.Y. Abidi F. Phillips S.E. Cass C.E. Young J.D. Baldwin S.A. Biochem. J. 1997; 328: 739-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar, 15Griffiths M. Beaumont N. Yao S.Y. Sundaram M. Boumah C.E. Davies A. Kwong F.Y. Coe I. Cass C.E. Young J.D. Baldwin S.A. Nat. Med. 1997; 3: 89-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar), suggested that FUN26 may encode a nucleoside transporter of S. cerevisiae. The gene loci for FUI1 and FUN26 were disrupted by insertional mutagenesis (26Baudin A. Ozier-Kalogeropoulos O. Denouel A. Lacroute F. Cullin C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 3329-3330Crossref PubMed Scopus (1112) Google Scholar) to allow determination of their functional characteristics independently of each other, taking advantage of the TRP1−/HIS3−phenotype of the KY114 yeast strain. The TRP1 sequence, encoding phosphoribosyl-anthranilate isomerase (EC 5.3.1.24), was inserted within the FUI1 coding sequence and the resultingfui1::TRP1 disruption fragment was introduced into KY114. The fui1-disruption mutants were selected in medium that lacked tryptophan. Similarly, the HIS3 sequence, encoding imidazoleglycerolphosphate dehydratase (EC 4.2.1.19), was inserted within the FUN26 coding sequence and the resultingfun26::HIS3 disruption fragment was introduced into KY114. The fun26-disruption mutants were selected in medium that lacked histidine. Polymerase chain reaction analysis of yeast chromosomal DNA prepared from either the parental strain or the TRP1+ and HIS3+ transformants confirmed disruption of the fui1 and fun26 loci, respectively. Yeast are sensitive to 5-fluorouridine and 5-fluorouracil (6Jund R. Lacroute F. J. Bacteriol. 1970; 102: 607-615Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and disruption of a gene encoding a cell-surface transport protein that mediates uptake of these drugs would be expected to impart resistance to cytotoxicity. The experiments of Fig. 1 were undertaken to determine if disruption of the fui1 and/or fun26genes altered sensitivity to either 5-fluorouridine or 5-fluorouracil. When cultures of the parental (FUI1+, FUN26+) strain and the fui1-disruption andfun26-disruption mutants were plated on solid medium that contained graded concentrations of 5-fluorouridine (Fig.1 a), growth of the fui1-disruption mutant was observed at the highest (1 mm) concentration tested, whereas growth of the parental (FUI1+, FUN26+) strain and the fun26-disruption mutant was inhibited at the lowest (10 μm) concentration tested. When thefui1-disruption mutant was transformed with pYFUI1 and grown under inducing conditions, the resulting transformants exhibited even greater sensitivity to 5-fluorouridine than the parental (FUI1+, FUN26+) strain. When the KY114 parental strain was transformed with pYFUN26 and grown under inducing conditions, the sensitivity to 5-fluorouridine was the same as observed for the parental strain (KY114). A similar result was obtained when thefui1-disruption mutant was transformed with pYFUN26 and grown under inducing conditions. When similar plating experiments were undertaken with 5-fluorouracil, identical sensitivities were observed for all yeast strains and transformants (Fig. 1 b). Taken together, the results of Fig. 1 indicated a role, presumably involving inwardly directed transport across the plasma membrane, for FUI1, but not for FUN26, in 5-fluorouridine toxicity and no role for either FUI1 or FUN26 in 5-fluorouracil toxicity"
https://openalex.org/W2094972117,"Polycomb group (PcG) proteins were first described in Drosophila as factors responsible for maintaining the transcriptionally repressed state of Hox/homeotic genes in a stable and heritable manner throughout development. A growing number of vertebrate genes related to the Drosophila PcG proteins have recently been identified, including two Polycomb orthologues, Pc2 and M33. PcG proteins form multiprotein complexes, termed PcG bodies, that are thought to repress transcription by altering chromatin structure. Here we report the identification and characterization of HPC3 (humanPolycomb 3), a novel PcG protein isolated in a yeast two-hybrid screen using human RING1 as bait. HPC3 shows strong sequence similarity to Drosophila Pc and also to vertebrate Pc2 and M33, particularly within the chromodomain and C-box. Previous studies indicate that M33 and human Pc2 (HPC2) can interact with RING1, and we show here that HPC3 also binds to RING1. This interaction is dependent upon the HPC3 C-box but, only partially on the RING finger of RING1. In contrast to HPC2, HPC3 interactions with RING1 are only observed in vivo with covalently modified forms of RING1. HPC3 also colocalizes with other PcG proteins in human PcG bodies. Consistent with its role as a PcG member, HPC3 is able to act as a long range transcriptional silencer when targeted to a reporter gene by a heterologous DNA-binding domain. Taken together, these data suggest that HPC3 is part of a large multiprotein complex that also contains other PcG proteins and is involved in repression of transcriptional activity.

Polycomb Group phosphate-buffered saline kilobase(s) chloramphenicol acetyltransferase DNA-binding domain activation domain Genetic analyses in Drosophila have revealed two classes of genes that are involved in maintaining the long term expression patterns of Hox/homeotic genes (1McGinnis W.

The Polycomb group (PcG)1 gene products are transcriptional repressors that maintain the silenced state of Hox genes in a stable and heritable manner, while the members of the trithorax group act to maintain the state of transcriptional activation (reviewed in Refs. 4Bienz M. Müller J. Bioessays. 1995; 17: 775-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 5Kennison J.A. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1995; 29: 289-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar, 6Orlando V. Paro R.

It has been postulated that the PcG family comprises at least 30–40 genes (11Jürgens G. Nature. 1985; 316: 153-155Crossref Scopus (338) Google Scholar, 12Landecker H.L. Sinclair D.A. Brock H.W. Dev. Gen. 1994; 15: 425-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), which cooperate to maintain the repressed state of Hox genes, but at present less than half of these loci have been characterized at the molecular level. Loss of PcG function in Drosophila does not directly alter the initial Hox gene expression patterns, but instead leads to ectopic expression at later developmental stages that often results in transformations of segmental identity. One hypothesis is that PcG-mediated repression is achieved by altering higher order chromatin structure, but exactly how the PcG proteins achieve this heritable silenced state is still a matter of debate (discussed in Refs. 4Bienz M. Müller J. Bioessays. 1995; 17: 775-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar and13Paro R. Trends Genet. 1990; 6: 416-421Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar, 14Paro R.

Cell. 1998; 93: 333-336Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). Recent data indicate that PcG-mediated repression of gene activity might be achieved by interaction with nucleosomes (18Breiling A. Bonte E. Ferrari S. Becker P.B. Paro R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 8451-8460Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) and histone deacetylation (19van der Vlag J. Otte A.P. Nat. Genet. 1999; 23: 474-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar) and suggest that PcG proteins may function antagonistically to the human SWI/SNF family of chromatin remodeling complexes (20Shao Z. Raible F. Mollaaghababa R. Guyon J.R. Wu C.T. Bender W. Kingston R.E. Cell. 1999; 98: 37-46Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (665) Google Scholar). A steadily increasing number of mammalian genes have been identified that share structural and functional similarity to members of theDrosophila PcG (reviewed in Refs. 21Gould A. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1997; 7: 488-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar, 22Schumacher A. Magnuson T. Trends Genet. 1997; 13: 167-170Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 23van Lohuizen M. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 1998; 54: 71-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), providing opportunities for comparing the functions of these genes between mammals and flies. Early evidence for conservation of the PcG came from the work on the murine proto-oncogene Bmi1, which was originally identified as a collaborator ofEμ-myc in lymphomagenesis (24Haupt Y. Alexander W.S. Barri G. Klinken S.P. Adams J.M. Cell. 1991; 65: 753-763Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar, 25van Lohuizen M. Verbeek S. Scheijen B. Wientjens E. van der Gulden H. Berns A. Cell. 1991; 65: 737-752Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (676) Google Scholar). Recently, it has been shown that Bmi1 regulates cell proliferation and senescence as well as apoptosis via the ink4a/arf gene locus (26Jacobs J.J. Kieboom K. Marino S. DePinho R.A. van Lohuizen M. Nature. 1999; 397: 164-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (1353) Google Scholar, 27Jacobs J.J. Scheijen B. Voncken J.W. Kieboom K. Berns A. van Lohuizen M. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2678-2690Crossref PubMed Scopus (539) Google Scholar). Both Bmi1 and the highly related Mel18 gene products share regions of high homology with the Drosophila PcG proteins Psc and Su(z)2 (28Brunk B.P. Martin E.C. Adler P.N. Nature. 1991; 353: 351-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 29van Lohuizen M. Frasch M. Wientjens E. Berns A.

Knockout mice for these genes show posterior transformations of the axial skeleton that often correlate with anterior shifts of Hox gene expression boundaries during development, similar to those seen in Drosophila PcG mutants (31van der Lugt N.M. Domen J. Linders K. van Roon M. Robanus-Maandag E. te Riele H. van der Valk M. Deschamps J. Sofroniew M. van Lohuizen M.

Typically, mammalian PcG phenotypes are not as extensive as the more prominent Drosophila loss-of-function mutations, an observation that may be explained by the increased potential for overlapping PcG gene functions in vertebrate embryos (33Bel S. Cor N. Djabali M. Kieboom K. van der Lugt N. Alkema M.J. van Lohuizen M. Development. 1998; 125: 3543-3551PubMed Google Scholar). Biochemical evidence in both Drosophila and vertebrates indicates that PcG proteins form large multiprotein complexes that are associated with DNA. Yeast two-hybrid and co-immunoprecipitation experiments reveal interactions between the following mouse and human PcG proteins: MPh1/MPh2, HPH1/HPH2, Bmi1, Mel18, M33, MPc2, and HPC2 (34Alkema M.J.

Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 887-898Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). PcG bodies have been shown to be stably associated with large areas of pericentromeric heterochromatin in a cell cycle-independent manner (42Saurin A.J. Shiels C. Williamson J. Satijn D.P.E. Otte A.P. Sheer D. Freemont P.S. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 887-898Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). It has previously been shown that PcG complexes inDrosophila are likely to vary in composition, depending on chromosomal localization (15Pirrotta V. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1997; 7: 249-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). In support of this, the PRC1 complex of PcG proteins, although in excess of 2 million daltons in size, only contains a subset of PcG proteins (20Shao Z. Raible F. Mollaaghababa R. Guyon J.R. Wu C.T. Bender W. Kingston R.E. Cell. 1999; 98: 37-46Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (665) Google Scholar). The existence of different complexes has also been observed in vertebrates. For example, the mammalian homologues of Drosophila E(z) and ESC, EZH1/EZH2 and EED, constitute part of a mammalian PcG complex that is biochemically and cytologically distinct from the PcG complex formed by human BMI1, RING1, HPC2, HPH1/HPH2, or their murine counterparts (43Sewalt R. van der Vlag J. Gunster M.J. Hamer K.M. den Blaauwen J.L. Satijn D.P.E. Hendrix T. van Driel R. Otte A.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3586-3595Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar, 44van Lohuizen M. Tijms M.

Acta. 1999; 1447: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar), and it has been suggested that the different PcG complexes function in an antagonistic manner (46Lessard J. Schumacher A. Thorsteinsdottir U. van Lohuizen M. Magnuson T. Sauvageau G. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2691-2703Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). To further characterize the mammalian PcG complex, we set out to identify additional RING1-interacting proteins by yeast two-hybrid screening. Here we describe the identification and characterization of a new RING1-interacting protein, Pc3. Pc3 shows strong similarity within the conserved chromodomain and C-box to the known vertebrate Polycomb proteins Pc2 and M33 but, in addition, possesses an atypical RED domain containing a long stretch of alternating Arg-Asp and Arg-Glu repeats. We show that HPC3 (humanPolycomb 3) can bind and associate specifically to two other PcG members, Bmi1 and RING1, but interestingly, in vivo interactions are only observed with covalently modified forms of RING1. In line with its role as a Polycomb protein, HPC3 is also able to function as a long range transcriptional repressor when recruited to DNA by a heterologous DNA-binding domain. Taken together, these data suggest that HPC3 is a member of the PcG complex of transcriptional repressors and may contribute to its gene silencing function. Full-lengthRING1 (47Lovering R. Hanson I.M. Borden K.L. Martin S. O'Reilly N.J. Evan G.I. Rahman D. Pappin D.J. Trowsdale J. Freemont P.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Song O. Nature. 1989; 340: 245-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (4863) Google Scholar). Saccharomyces cerevisiae (CG-1945 strain) was co-transformed with the pAS2–1.RING1 and cDNA library with transformants plated on selective medium lacking Leu, Trp, and His but containing 35 mm 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole. From a screen of approximately 4.5 × 106 individual library clones (∼65% of the library), 146 colonies were obtained, of which 79 were positive for β-galactosidase activity. To further eliminate false positives, the pGAD10-containing clones were isolated from these colonies and subjected to further retransformation with various pAS2–1 clones (CLONTECH). The remaining clones were subjected to numerous rounds of cDNA sequencing. The RING1 and HPC3 clones used in domain mapping experiments were derived by the polymerase chain reaction, and all constructs were fully sequenced. RING1 fragments were subcloned in frame to the GAL4 DNA-binding domain in pAS2–1 (CLONTECH), and HPC3 fragments were subcloned in frame to the GAL4 activation domain in pGANG (CLONTECH), except for the HPC3 C-box clone, which was generated from the library screen as a GAL4 activation domain fusion in pGAD10 (CLONTECH). The yeast strains Y190 (CLONTECH) and PJ69–4A (49James P. Halladay J. Craig E.A. Genetics. 1996; 144: 1425-1436Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) were used during the interaction assays and were transformed using the EasyComp transformation kit (Invitrogen). All clones were individually tested for β-galactosidase activity as follows: 5-ml cultures of positive transformants were grown for 2 days in medium lacking Leu and Trp and used to inoculate 10 ml of YPD medium. Cultures were grown to an OD of 0.5–0.8 at λ = 600 nm. Cells were washed and then permeabilized, and β-galactosidase activity was measured as described (CLONTECH yeast protocols handbook), using chlorophenol red-β-d-galactopyranoside as chromogenic substrate. Full-length HPC3 was obtained by screening a plated human breast carcinoma cDNA library (ZR-75; Stratagene) using the RING1 interacting clone, isolated from the yeast two-hybrid screen. cDNA library filters were hybridized in CHURCH buffer (0.5 m phosphate, pH 7.5, 10 mm EDTA, 7% SDS, 100 μg/ml) sonicated salmon sperm cDNA (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), 15% (v/v) formamide overnight at 60 °C and then washed to a stringency of 0.2× standard sodium citrate, 0.1% SDS at 65 °C. Rapid amplification of cDNA ends cDNA cloning to isolate additional 5′ HPC3 sequence was performed using the Marathon kit (CLONTECH). A full-length HPC3cDNA clone was subsequently obtained and subcloned into the mammalian expression vector pMLV2T (50Dalton S. Treisman R. Cell. 1992; 68: 597-612Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar). Human 2C4 (HT1080) fibrosarcoma cells were grown to approximately 70% confluence and transiently transfected using the Qiagen SuperFect transfection reagent. To assess the HPC3-RING1 interaction in vivo, 2C4 cells were transfected with pMLV.RING1 and pMLV.HPC3 with specific immunoprecipitation of Myc-tagged HPC3 by the 9E10 monoclonal antibody (51Evan G.I. Lewis G.K. Ramsay G. Bishop J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1985; 5: 3610-3616Crossref PubMed Scopus (2167) Google Scholar). Transfected cells were lysed in HS lysis buffer (250 mm NaCl, 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 5 mmEDTA, 0.1% Nonidet P-40) containing a protease inhibitor mixture (1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.03 mmleupeptin, 2 mm benzamidine, 4 μg/ml aprotinin, 0.8 mg/ml pepstatin A). Cell lysates were collected and briefly sonicated, and cell debris removed by centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 5 min at 4 °C. Lysates were also precleared for 1 h using normal mouse antibodies (10 μg; Sigma) and protein G-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) to minimize nonspecific binding. Precleared lysates were then incubated with the 9E10 monoclonal antibody for 1 h at 4 °C with gentle agitation. Immunocomplexes were isolated by incubation with protein G-Sepharose (1:100, v/v) for 30 min at 4 °C and gently washed three times with lysis buffer. All samples were resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred onto Hybond ECL membrane (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) overnight at 80 mA at 4 °C. Blots were probed with either a 1:200 dilution of the indicated RING1 polyclonal antisera (42Saurin A.J. Shiels C. Williamson J. Satijn D.P.E. Otte A.P. Sheer D. Freemont P.S. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 887-898Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar) or a 1:1000 dilution of the 9E10 monoclonal antibody (51Evan G.I. Lewis G.K. Ramsay G. Bishop J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1985; 5: 3610-3616Crossref PubMed Scopus (2167) Google Scholar) with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated sheep anti-mouse antibody (1:1000; DAKO) and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit antibody (1:2000; DAKO) used as secondary antibodies. All blots were developed using the ECL reagent system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Cells were grown to near confluence on glass coverslips and washed with PBS before fixing with 4% formaldehyde, followed by permeabilization with 0.5% Triton in PBS for 10 min. After washing with PBS, cells were incubated with block solution (10% fetal calf serum in PBS with 0.1% Tween 20) for at least 10 min at room temperature. Incubation with antibodies was in block solution for 1 h at room temperature, followed by washing once with PBS plus 0.1% Tween 20 and twice with PBS. Samples were incubated with secondary fluorochrome-conjugated antibodies (swine anti-rabbit fluorescein isothiocyanate conjugate, DAKO, and sheep anti-mouse Texas Red; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) diluted 1:200 in block solution for 1 h at room temperature. Coverslips were then washed once in PBS plus 0.1% Tween 20, twice in PBS, and once in distilled water before mounting and analysis by confocal microscopy. All samples were visualized and recorded on a Zeiss LSM510 confocal microscope. Full-length HPC3 and the indicated HPC3 fragments were subcloned into the mammalian expression vector, pMLVGAL4, as N-terminal fusions with the GAL4 DNA-binding domain. The CAT reporter plasmids used were those described by Schoorlemmer et al. (54Koonin E.V. Zhou S. Lucchesi J.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 4229-4233Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). pG5tkCAT contains five GAL4-binding sites upstream of a HSVtk promoter; pG5–1.6-tkCAT contains an additional 1.6-kb fragment inserted between the GAL4-binding sites and the promoter; ptkCAT uses the same HSVtk promoter but lacks the GAL4-binding sites. COS-7 and HT1080 cells were grown in DMEM plus 10% fetal calf serum and split 1:8–1:10 the day before transfection into 3-mm tissue culture plates. All transfections were done using the calcium phosphate precipitation method (52Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 16.33-16.36Google Scholar). Total cDNA transfected per well of cells was 5 μg: 2.5 μg of CAT reporter plasmid, 1.67 μg of effector plasmid, and 0.83 μg of pSV-β-Gal (Promega) reference plasmid. Cells were harvested 40–48 h after transfection, and reporter gene expression was determined in the same cell extract using CAT and β-galactosidase enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kits with substrate enhancer (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Expression values are standardized against β-galactosidase expression from the pSV-β-Gal reference plasmid. CAT expression values obtained with the reporter plasmid in the presence of empty pMLVGAL4 effector plasmid were set to 100 arbitrary units, and CAT levels in cells transfected with HPC3 or RING1 are expressed relative to those obtained with the empty GAL4 vector. The results represent the mean values of five independent experiments. As RING1 has been previously identified as a mammalian PcG protein (39Satijn D.P. Gunster M.J. van der Vlag J. Hamer K.M. Schul W. Alkema M.J. Saurin A.J. Freemont P.S. van Driel R. Otte A.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4105-4113Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar), we wanted to identify novel RING1-interacting proteins, which, by inference, could be part of the PcG complex. We therefore performed a yeast two-hybrid screen of a nontransformed human lung cDNA library, where RING1 is known to be expressed (data not shown), using full-length RING1 as bait. After cDNA isolation and subsequent retransformation to test for false positives, 57 colonies remained of potential interest and were sequenced. Twelve of these clones, representing overlapping cDNA fragments from the same gene, could all be translated in an identical reading frame (data not shown) with high sequence identity to the previously described “C-box” interaction domain present in other PcG proteins (see Fig.1; Ref. 53Satijn D.P. Olson D.J. van der Vlag J. Hamer K.M. Lambrechts C. Masselink H. Gunster M.J. Sewalt R.G. van Driel R. Otte A.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6076-6086Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). The interaction of other clones with RING1 is currently under investigation. Thirteen additional cDNA clones for this RING1-interacting gene were obtained by high stringency screening of a human breast carcinoma cDNA library, and sequence analysis revealed that all clones overlapped with the original yeast clone but contained additional 5′ sequence. Further 5′ sequence was obtained by 5′ rapid amplification of cDNA ends. Conceptual translation of the assembled cDNA sequence indicates the presence of a 1167-base pair open reading frame encoding a previously unidentified 389-amino acid protein (Fig.1 A). Data base searches resulted in a number of significant matches to known Polycomb-related genes, includingDrosophila Pc, murine M33 and humanPc2 (Table I). We thus call this new gene Polycomb 3 or Pc3 (Fig.1 A). The level of sequence identity is much higher within the N- and C-terminal regions of the predicted protein (Table I; Fig.1, B and C), which include two previously identified Pc subdomains. The N-terminal region contains a chromatin organization modifier domain or chromodomain (Fig. 1 B), which is found in over 40 proteins, including a subset of PcG proteins (54Koonin E.V. Zhou S. Lucchesi J.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 4229-4233Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Multiple sequence alignment of the HPC3 chromodomain with other chromodomains shows a high degree of sequence identity ranging from 60 to 65%, with the highest level of identity found within the core of the domain (Table I; Fig. 1 B). The C-terminal region of HPC3 contains a C-box protein-protein interaction domain found in a number of Pc homologues (Table I; Fig. 1 C). In addition to the chromodomain and C-box, HPC3 contains an unusual sequence comprising a tandem repeat of Arg-Asp or Arg-Glu residues (Fig. 1 A), corresponding to a large stretch of alternating positive/negative charges. This domain has been termed the RED or RD domain and is found in a variety of proteins, although its function is not known (55Assier E. Bouzinba-Segard H. Stolzenberg M.C. Stephens R. Bardos J. Freemont P. Charron D. Trowsdale J. Rich T. Gene (Amst.). 1999; 230: 145-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Compared with other vertebrate PcG proteins, Pc3 is most similar in length to Drosophila Pc (390 and 389 residues, respectively). Furthermore, an alignment of Pc3 with Pc not only shows sequence similarities along the whole length of the alignment but places the RED domain in a similar linear position to the poly-His sequence in Pc (Fig. 1 D). It remains to be seen whether these two regions are functionally related.Table ISequence identities between HPC3 and other Polycomb group proteinsProteinNo. of residuesSequence identityOverallChromodomainC-boxExcluding chromodomain/C-box%%%%Pc39024485113XPc47129665416M3351932625116HPC25832722122Pairwise sequence comparisons were performed using the AMPS package (68Barton G.J.

The C-box domain of HPC3 was isolated as the RING1-interacting sequence in the yeast two-hybrid screen. This conserved domain has previously been shown to be necessary and sufficient for the interactions of both HPC2 and XPc with RING1 (39Satijn D.P. Gunster M.J. van der Vlag J. Hamer K.M. Schul W.

To determine whether this also applies to HPC3 and to test for the specificity of the HPC3-RING1 interaction, we used the yeast two-hybrid system. Constructs were made that express the GAL4 DNA-binding domain (GAL4 DBD) fused to either full-length RING1, RING1 lacking the RING finger, or the RING finger alone (Fig.2 A). Constructs were also made for HPC3 with the GAL4 activation domain (GAL4 AD) fused to full-length HPC3, the HPC3 C-box, or HPC3 lacking the C-box (Fig. 2 A). The par"

The levels of individual phosphatidylinositols are controlled by specific lipid kinases, whose activities and localization are in turn regulated by a variety of effectors. Here we have examined the effect of overexpression of frequenin, a modulator of phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase activity, on biosynthetic and postendocytic traffic in polarized Madin-Darby canine kidney cells. Endogenous frequenin was identified in these cells by polymerase chain reaction, Western blotting, and indirect immunofluorescence. Adenoviral-mediated overexpression of frequenin had no effect on early Golgi transport of membrane proteins, as assessed by acquisition of resistance to endoglycosidase H. However, delivery of newly synthesized influenza hemagglutinin from the trans-Golgi network to the apical cell surface was severely inhibited in cells overexpressing frequenin, whereas basolateral delivery of the polymeric immunoglobulin receptor was unaffected. Overexpression of frequenin did not affect postendocytic trafficking steps including apical and basolateral recycling and basal-to-apical transcytosis. We conclude that frequenin, and by inference, phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase, plays an important and selective role in apical delivery in polarized cells.

We have been interested in the mechanisms that regulate cargo sorting and vesicle formation along the biosynthetic and postendocytic pathways. In recent years, rapidly accumulating evidence has implicated polyphosphoinositides as key players in membrane trafficking (reviewed in Ref. 1Corvera S. D'Arrigo A. Stenmark H. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 460-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). In addition to their function as second-messenger precursors, these lipids are now thought to participate physically in the formation and release of vesicles from various compartments along the secretory pathway. The regulation of polyphosphoinositide formation by specific lipid kinases is therefore the subject of intense study. Frequenin is a myristoylated ∼22-kDa calmodulin-related calcium-binding protein that modulates regulated secretion in neuronal and neuroendocrine cells (2McFerran B.W. Graham M.E. Burgoyne R.D. J.

Recently, frequenin was demonstrated to regulate the activity of the yeast phosphatidylinositol 4-OH kinase (PI4K)1 Pik1 (5Hendricks K.B. Wang B.Q. Schneiders E.A. Thorner J. Nature Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 234-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar), which is homologous to the mammalian PI4K β isoform (PI4Kβ (6Meyers R. Cantley L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4384-4390Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar)). AlthoughFRQ1 is an essential gene in yeast, overexpression ofPIK1 suppressed a frq1Δ mutation; however, overexpression of frequenin did not rescue a pik1Δ mutant, suggesting that PIK1 acts downstream of FRQ1 (5Hendricks K.B. Wang B.Q. Schneiders E.A. Thorner J. Nature Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 234-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). PIK1 activity was subsequently found to regulate secretion in yeast at the level of thetrans-Golgi (7Walch-Solimena C. Novick P. Nature Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 523-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar, 8Hama H. Schnieders E.A. Thorner J. Takemoto J.Y. DeWald D.B. J. Biol.

Novick P. Nature Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 523-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). Although initial reports suggested that frequenin expression was localized exclusively to neuronal tissues (3Pongs O. Lindemeier J. Zhu X.R. Theil T. Engelkamp D. Krah-Jentgens I. Lambrecht H.-G.

Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8001-8005Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), the recent discovery of a yeast homolog of frequenin led us to examine its expression in a non-neuronal cell line. Interestingly, we found that cultured Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells expressed significant levels of frequenin mRNA and protein. Therefore, we tested whether mammalian frequenin interacts with PI4Kβ, and investigated the effect of frequenin overexpression on biosynthetic and postendocytic protein traffic in this polarized epithelial cell line. Low passage MDCK T23 cells (9Henkel J.R. Apodaca G. Altschuler Y. Hardy S. Weisz O.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 8: 2477-2490Crossref Scopus (51) Google Scholar) were maintained in minimal essential medium (Cellgro, Fisher Scientific, Pittsburgh, PA) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Atlanta Biologicals, Norcross, GA), streptomycin (100 μg/ml), and penicillin (100 units/ml). MDCK T23 cells stably express the polymeric immunoglobulin receptor (pIgR) as well as the tetracycline transactivator, which is required for expression of influenza hemagglutinin (HA) from adenovirus. For all experiments, cells were seeded at high density (∼2 × 105 cells/well) on 12-mm Transwells (0.4 μm pore, Costar, Cambridge, MA) for 2–3 days prior to infection with recombinant adenovirus at the indicated multiplicity of infection (m.o.i.) as described in Ref. 9Henkel J.R. Apodaca G. Altschuler Y. Hardy S. Weisz O.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 8: 2477-2490Crossref Scopus (51) Google Scholar. Experiments were performed the following day. A cDNA fragment encoding frequenin from rat brain was subcloned into the pAdlox vector, and a recombinant adenovirus generated as described in Ref. 10Hardy S. Kitamura M. Harris-Stansil T. Dai Y.

Generation of a control adenovirus encoding a nonsense sequence (influenza M2 inserted in the reverse orientation) and of adenovirus encoding influenza HA has been previously described (9Henkel J.R. Apodaca G. Altschuler Y. Hardy S. Weisz O.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 8: 2477-2490Crossref Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Generation and affinity purification of two rabbit polyclonal anti-frequenin antibodies (44162 and 44163) and chicken anti-frequenin antibody 21 generated against purified mammalian frequenin are described in detail elsewhere (11Werle M.J. Roder J. Jeromin A. Neurosci. Lett. 2000; 284: 33-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), 2A. Jeromin, M. R. Soranzo, F. Vita, C. Borchetta, J. Roder, and G. Zabucchi, submitted for publication. Polyclonal anti-PI4Kβ antibody was purchased from Upstate Biotechnology (Lake Placid, NY). Detection of PI4Kβ by Western blotting was performed according to the manufacturer's protocol. The same procedure was used to detect frequenin in solubilized cell lysates, membrane, and cytosolic fractions. MDCK cells grown to confluence on 6-cm dishes were mock-infected or infected with AV-frequenin. The following day, cells were rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline and scraped using a rubber policeman into 0.5 ml of buffer containing 30 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm CaCl2, and 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The cells were then passed through a 20-gauge needle 10 times, and centrifuged for 1 h at 100,000 × g. The pellet was resuspended in the original volume of buffer, and the supernatant and resuspended pellet were trichloroacetic acid precipitated and solubilized with Laemmli sample buffer. Samples were run on 12% SDS-PAGE gels and Western blotted using rabbit polyclonal antibody 44163. Blots were exposed to film (BioMax MR, Eastman Kodak Co., Rochester, NY), and bands were quantitated after scanning using Quantity One software (Bio-Rad). Indirect immunofluorescence staining of filter-grown MDCK T23 cells expressing frequenin was performed using the pH shift protocol as described previously (9Henkel J.R. Apodaca G. Altschuler Y. Hardy S. Weisz O.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 8: 2477-2490Crossref Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Frequenin was detected using rabbit polyclonal anti-frequenin antibody 44163. Cy3-conjugated goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody (1:1000 dilution) was from Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc. (Avondale, PA). Imaging was performed on a Nikon Eclipse TE300 inverted microscope (Fryer Co. Inc., Huntley, IL) using a CFI plan apochromat × 100 oil-immersion objective (numerical aperture 1.4) with a DAPI/FITC/TRITC (4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole/fluorescein isothiocyanate/tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate) triple band filter set (single band exciters; Chroma Technology Corp., Brattleboro, VT). Vertical series of images, each 0.5 μm apart, were captured with a Hamamatsu C4742-95 digital CCD camera (Hamamatsu, Hamamatsu City, Japan) using Openlab software (Improvision, Coventry, United Kingdom) with the following settings: exposure time 400–600 ms, offset 20–40%, gain 69%, camera binning ×1, and 8-bit grayscale. Images were then cropped to a 600 × 600 pixel region of interest and processed using the Openlab multi-neighbor deconvolution module (4 neighbors) to remove out-of-focus information. Projections of two consecutive sections were saved in tag-information file format and the contrast levels of the images were adjusted using Photoshop software (Adobe, Mountain View, CA) on a Power PC G-3 Macintosh computer (Apple, Cupertino, CA). The rate of transport through the cis/medial Golgi was quantitated by monitoring acquisition of HA to endoglycosidase H (endo H) resistance as described in Ref. 12Henkel J.R. Weisz O.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6518-6524Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar. Briefly, cells were starved for 30 min, radiolabeled with [35S]methionine for 10 min, then chased for the indicated times. Cells were then solubilized and HA immunoprecipitated using a monoclonal antibody. After collection with fixed Staphylococcus aureus (Calbiochem, La Jolla, CA), antibody-antigen complexes were eluted, divided in half, and mock-treated or treated with endo H (New England Biolabs, Inc., Beverly, MA). Samples were electrophoresed on 10% SDS-PAGE gels and quantitated using a PhosphorImager with Quantity One software (Personal Molecular Imager FX; Bio-Rad). To measure delivery of HA from the trans-Golgi network (TGN) to the cell surface, cells were starved and radiolabeled as described above, then chased for 2 h at 19 °C to accumulate newly synthesized HA in the TGN.

RNA isolated from MDCK cells using two methods was amplified by polymerase chain reaction using degenerate oligonucleotides directed against the sequence of rat frequenin. A single band of approximately 200 base pairs was observed, identical to that seen in control amplifications using authentic rat frequenin cDNA (Fig. 1). This is in agreement with the finding that frequenin cloned from mouse kidney is identical in sequence to the protein originally cloned from brain. 3David Mount, personal communication. Western blotting of MDCK cells using a polyclonal antibody raised in either rabbit or chicken against purified rat/mouse frequenin revealed a single band at approximately 18 kDa, similar to the reported molecular weight of rat frequenin (Fig. 2). In MDCK cells infected with a recombinant adenovirus encoding rat frequenin (AV-frequenin), the intensity of this band increased by an average of 3.3-fold. Similar results (a range of between ∼2 and ∼4-fold increase in virally infected cells) were obtained by scanning and quantitating other blots from several experiments. Because frequenin associates with membranes via a myristoyl anchor, we tested whether overexpression of frequenin altered its membrane distribution. Crude membrane fractionation revealed that approximately 60% of endogenous frequenin was membrane associated, and overexpression of frequenin had no effect on the relative proportion of membrane-associated frequenin (Fig. 3). Digital deconvolution of uninfected MDCK cells processed for indirect immunofluorescence using rabbit polyclonal anti-frequenin antibody revealed punctate staining that was concentrated throughout the cytoplasm (Fig.4, panels A-H), consistent with frequenin localization on membranous organelles. There was no effect on the overall staining pattern in cells overexpressing frequenin (Fig. 4, panels I-P), consistent with our fractionation data.Figure 2Expression of frequenin in MDCK cells by adenoviral infection.

Bar, 10 μm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) In yeast, the frequenin homolog Frq1 has been reported to interact with thePIK1 gene product, PI4K. A mammalian homolog of Pik1 was recently isolated that encodes a wortmannin-sensitive β isoform of PI4K (6Meyers R. Cantley L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4384-4390Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). We therefore performed coimmunoprecipitation experiments to determine whether PI4Kβ and frequenin associate in MDCK cells. Mock-infected or AV-frequenin-infected MDCK cells were solubilized and immunoprecipitated with anti-frequenin or anti-PI4Kβ antibodies. The samples were then electrophoresed and Western blotted with the converse antibody (Fig. 5). A ∼97-kDa band, consistent with the molecular mass of PI4Kβ was observed when immunoprecipates of frequenin from AV-infected but not mock-infected cells were blotted with anti-PI4Kβ antibody. The same band was observed in MDCK cell lysates that had been immunoprecipitated using anti-PI4Kβ antibody, confirming the identity of this protein (not shown). Interestingly, in some experiments, an additional band of ∼110 kDa was also observed in cell lysates and in anti-frequenin immunoprecipitates blotted with anti-PI4Kβ antibody (Fig. 5,upper band); however, this band was not specific to cells overexpressing frequenin. The identity of this protein is unknown. By indirect immunofluorescence, PI4K localized to numerous intracellular punctae, reminiscent of the localization of frequenin; in addition, some nuclear localization was also observed (not shown). Overexpression of frequenin had no effect on the gross distribution of PI4K. We tested whether overexpression of frequenin affects endocytic trafficking pathways in polarized MDCK cells. The MDCK T23 cells stably express pIgR, which is a useful marker to follow the basolateral-to-apical transcytotic and apical recycling pathways. Previously we demonstrated that adenoviral infection with a control virus (expressing a nonsense construct) had no effect on the rate of postendocytic traffic in cells (9Henkel J.R. Apodaca G. Altschuler Y. Hardy S. Weisz O.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 8: 2477-2490Crossref Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Thus, in these experiments, we compared the rates of basolateral-to-apical transcytosis and apical recycling of 125I-IgA in cells infected with frequenin and cells infected with the control virus (Fig.6, A and B). Overexpression of frequenin had no effect on the rate of IgA transcytosis or recycling, even when 5-fold higher levels of virus were used (not shown). In addition, frequenin had no effect on the rate of basolateral recycling in polarized MDCK cells as measured using125I-transferrin as a marker (Fig. 6 C). Thus, overexpression of frequenin does not appear to alter the delivery of pre-endocytosed proteins to the apical or basolateral plasma membrane of polarized cells. We next examined whether overexpression of frequenin affects biosynthetic delivery in MDCK cells. To test whether frequenin overexpression affects the rate of protein traffic through the early secretory pathway, we monitored acquisition of endo H resistance of newly synthesized influenza HA (Fig. 7). This assay measures the rate of delivery of proteins from their synthesis to arrival at the cis/medial Golgi. The endo H kinetics of HA were identical in cells infected with a control AV compared with cells overexpressing frequenin, suggesting that frequenin does not normally modulate transport through the early secretory pathway. However, when transport of radiolabeled HA from the TGN to the cell surface was monitored, we observed a dramatic delay in apical delivery of this protein in cells overexpressing frequenin (Fig.8). However, overexpression of frequenin did not cause missorting of HA, as the cell surface distribution of HA measured after long chase times (6 h) was unaffected (85.2 ± 6.9% apical in control cells versus 93 ± 10.4% apical in frequenin-expressing cells, mean ± S.D.,n = 3). Treatment with concentrations of wortmannin (10 μm) that inhibit PI4K had a similar effect on HA delivery from the TGN to the cell surface (not shown).Figure 8Frequenin overexpression inhibits HA TGN-to-apical cell surface delivery. Polarized MDCK T23 cells were infected with AV-HA and either AV-frequenin or control AV. Cells were starved, radiolabeled, and chased for 2 h at 19 °C. The medium was replaced with prewarmed medium and delivery of HA to the apical plasma membrane quantitated using a surface trypsinization assay as described under “Materials and Methods.” A representative gel is shown in panel A; HA0 marks the position of uncleaved HA, and the migration of cleavage products HA1 and HA2 are noted. Quantitation of the rate of HA delivery to the cell surface is shown in panel B. Similar results were obtained in six experiments, however, the total amount and rate of cell surface and HA delivery varied somewhat between experiments. The raw data from six independent experiments was subjected to paired t test analysis; asterisks denote time points in which HA delivery in frequenin-expressing cells is statistically different from control.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The effect of frequenin on the initial rate of HA TGN-to-apical delivery but not on its ultimate sorting could reflect a delay in apical delivery alone or a generalized defect in TGN-to-cell surface delivery. Because only a small fraction of HA is delivered to the basolateral surface, we could not determine whether frequenin affected the kinetics of delivery of this pool; therefore, we tested whether frequenin affects the delivery of pIgR, which is rapidly and efficiently delivered to the basolateral cell surface after synthesis. Interestingly, overexpression of frequenin had no effect on the kinetics of pIgR delivery to the basolateral surface of polarized MDCK cells (Fig. 9). In addition, frequenin overexpression delayed apical but not basolateral secretion of another protein, a glycosylated form of the human growth hormone (not shown) that we and others have demonstrated is secreted predominantly apically (13Henkel J.R. Gibson G.A. Poland P.A. Ellis M.A. Hughey R.P. Weisz O.A. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 495-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 14Scheiffele P. Peranen J. Simons K. Nature. 1995; 378: 96-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar). We have demonstrated that frequenin is endogenously expressed in MDCK cells, and that overexpressed frequenin coimmunoprecipitates with the wortmannin-sensitive β isoform of PI4K. Overexpression of frequenin inhibited delivery of newly synthesized influenza HA from thetrans-Golgi network to the apical surface of polarized MDCK cells; however, the proper sorting of this protein was ultimately unimpaired. By contrast, transport through the early secretory pathway, cell surface delivery of a basolaterally directed protein, basolateral-to-apical transcytosis, and recycling of preinternalized proteins to either membrane domain were unaffected by frequenin overexpression. Although we have not determined whether frequenin overexpression inhibits the budding of vesicles from the TGN or their fusion with the apical membrane, our data are consistent with recent observations demonstrating a role for PI4K in Golgi-to-cell surface delivery in yeast (7Walch-Solimena C. Novick P. Nature Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 523-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar, 8Hama H. Schnieders E.A. Thorner J. Takemoto J.Y. DeWald D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34294-34300Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). The mechanism by which frequenin regulates PI4K activity is not clear, and is likely to be complex. Frequenin may mediate membrane targeting and localization of PI4K; alternatively, frequenin might regulate PI4K activity directly. Membrane targeting of frequenin requires a myristate anchor and is dependent on Ca2+ (5Hendricks K.B. Wang B.Q. Schneiders E.A. Thorner J. Nature Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 234-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). However, both the physical interaction between Pik1 and frequenin and frequenin's stimulation of Pik1 activity in vitro were shown to be independent of Ca2+ concentration and frequenin myristoylation (5Hendricks K.B. Wang B.Q. Schneiders E.A. Thorner J. Nature Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 234-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). Thus, it is possible that frequenin regulates PI4K localization and activity independently. Balla and colleagues 4Tamas Balla, personal communication. have demonstrated that overexpression of frequenin stimulates activity of heterologously expressed PI4K in COS cells, however, the mechanism is unknown. We did not detect any effect of frequenin overexpression on the localization of PI4K by indirect immunofluorescence. Numerous attempts to examine the membrane distribution of PI4K in mock-infected versusfrequenin-overexpressing cells gave highly variable and irreproducible results, although the majority of PI4K was recovered in the soluble fraction, consistent with previous results by Wong et al. (15Wong K. Meyers R. Cantley L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13236-13241Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Thus, we conclude that overexpression of frequenin does not have a dramatic effect on PI4K distribution, although subtle localized changes would be difficult to detect. Polyphosphoinositide metabolism has been demonstrated to play a critical role in vesicular traffic through the Golgi complex, and particularly in vesicle release from the TGN (see Refs. 1Corvera S. D'Arrigo A. Stenmark H. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 460-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar, 16Fang M. Rivas M.P. Bankaitis V.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1404: 85-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, and 17Czech M.P. Cell. 2000; 100: 603-606Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar, for review). Recent insight into the mechanism by which PI4K might function in this context comes from the observation that ARF recruits PI4Kβ (as well as an unidentified PI5K) to the Golgi complex, and thus causes an increase in phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) levels (18Godi A. Pertile P. Meyers R. Marra P. Di Tullio G. Iurisci C. Luini A. Corda D. De Matteis M.A. Nature Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 280-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar). In addition, ARF also activates phospholipase D activity, which stimulates PI5K activity and further increases PIP2 levels (19Brown H.A. Gutkowski S. Moomaw C.R. Slaughter C. Sternweis P.C. Cell. 1993; 17: 1137-1144Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (823) Google Scholar, 20Lorra C. Huttner W.B. Nature Cell Biol. 1999; 1: E113-E115Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Negatively charged phospholipids such as PIP2 have been suggested to play numerous roles in vesicle formation, including altering membrane fusogenicity and curvature (21Chernomordik L. Chem. Phys. Lipids. 1996; 81: 203-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar, 22Sheetz M.P. Singer S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1974; 71: 4457-4461Crossref PubMed Scopus (1321) Google Scholar). In addition, increased PIP2 levels may serve to recruit or modulate proteins that contain pleckstrin-homology domains, such as dynamin and spectrin. Dynamin is present on the TGN and has been found to participate in vesicle budding from the TGN (23Jones S.M. Howell K.E. Henley J.R. Cao H. McNiven M.A. Science. 1998; 279: 573-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). Phosphoinositide-mediated alterations in the Golgi-specific cytoskeleton have also been postulated to drive vesicle formation from the TGN (20Lorra C. Huttner W.B. Nature Cell Biol. 1999; 1: E113-E115Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). A further clue to the role of polyphosphoinositide formation in post-Golgi biosynthetic traffic comes from a recent report on the effect of PI5K overexpression in 3T3 cells, which along with other nonpolarized cell lines, can differentially regulate delivery of heterologously expressed “apical” and “basolateral” proteins (24Peranen J. Auvinen P. Virta H. Wepf R. Simons K. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 153-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). Recently, Rozelle et al. (25Rozelle A.L. Machesky L.M. Yamamoto M. Driessens M.H.E. Insall R.H. Roth M.G. Luby-Phelps K. Marriott G. Hall A. Yin H.L. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 311-320Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar) reported that overexpression of PI5K in 3T3 fibroblasts resulted in increased cellular PIP2 levels accompanied by a dramatic elevation in the formation of actin comets around vesicles. Comet formation was found to be regulated by N-WASP, a member of the Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein family, which has previously been shown to induce actin comet formation around vesicles in a PIP2dependent manner (26Ma L. Cantley L.C. Janmey P.A. Kirschner M.A. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 1125-1136Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). The majority of comets in PI5K-overexpressing cells were associated with Golgi-derived vesicles, and intriguingly, were selectively associated with vesicles carrying the apical marker HA, whereas vesicles carrying a basolateral marker were rarely seen associated with comets (25Rozelle A.L. Machesky L.M. Yamamoto M. Driessens M.H.E. Insall R.H. Roth M.G. Luby-Phelps K. Marriott G. Hall A. Yin H.L. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 311-320Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar). Actin polymerization is known to nucleate from cholesterol- and sphingolipid-rich membrane domains (lipid rafts) under some conditions (27Harder T. Simons K. Eur. J. Immunol. 1999; 29: 556-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar), and these rafts are also enriched in PIP2 (28Pike L.J. Casey L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26453-26456Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). Segregation into lipid rafts has been suggested as a mechanism for the sorting of apically destined proteins (29Simons K. Ikonen E. Nature. 1997; 387: 569-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (8157) Google Scholar); thus, one could envision a selective role for PIP2formation in generation or release of apically destined vesicles. However, the rate of HA delivery to the cell surface was not quantified in the study described above, and it is not clear whether actin comet formation ultimately stimulates or inhibits apical membrane delivery. In fact, we observed an inhibition of HA cell surface delivery in both MDCK and HeLa cells (data not shown) infected with AV-frequenin; this might suggest that elevated PIP2 levels somehow inhibit the delivery of apical cargo. We did not observe any effects of frequenin overexpression on the steady state localization of actin, PI4K, or the TGN marker furin (data not shown). We found no effect of frequenin overexpression on the rate of recycling of preinternalized apical and basolateral proteins, even at very high expression levels. In addition, we did not observe any obvious effect of frequenin on the intracellular accumulation of apical or basolateral markers, although we did not measure internalization rates. The selective effect of frequenin overexpression on biosynthetic delivery was surprising given that overexpression of PI4K has been demonstrated to modulate endocytosis in other systems. For example, Walch-Solimena and Novick (7Walch-Solimena C. Novick P. Nature Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 523-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar) reported that PIK1 mutants show a defect in endocytosis at the level of the endosome, although the affected step was not defined. Moreover, a recent report demonstrated a role for PI4Kβ in agonist-induced endocytosis of G protein-coupled receptors in neuroblastoma cells (30Sorensen S.D. Linseman D.A. McEwen E.L. Heacock A.M. Fisher S.K. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 53: 827-836PubMed Google Scholar). Because several mammalian homologs of Pik1 have been identified, it is possible that another PI4K isoform regulates this step in MDCK cells. To our knowledge, the expression and localization of PI4K isoforms in MDCK cells have not yet been investigated. Immunoblots of MDCK cell lysates using PI4Kβ-specific antiserum sometimes revealed a ∼110-kDa band in addition to the reproducible 97-kDa protein that coprecipitated with overexpressed frequenin; interestingly, coprecipitation of this protein with frequenin occurred even in the absence of frequenin overexpression (Fig. 4). This protein might represent an additional form of PI4K that interacts strongly with endogenous frequenin; however, we do not know the identity of this protein at present. Several studies have also shown that overexpression of frequenin results in stimulated release of regulated secretory vesicles (2McFerran B.W. Graham M.E. Burgoyne R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22768-22772Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 3Pongs O. Lindemeier J. Zhu X.R. Theil T. Engelkamp D. Krah-Jentgens I. Lambrecht H.-G. Koch K.W.

Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8001-8005Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). In addition, PI4K activity was recently demonstrated to be essential for stimulated secretion from isolated nerve terminals and permeabilized adrenal chromaffin cells (31Wiedemann C. Schafer T. Burger M.M. Sihra T.S. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 5594-5602Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 32Wiedemann C. Schafer T. Burger M.M. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2094-2101Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Together these observations suggest that frequenin acts as a positive regulator of PI4K activity on synaptic vesicles or chromaffin granules. By contrast, we observed that overexpression of frequenin inhibits protein delivery from the TGN to the plasma membrane of polarized cells. Because MDCK cells do not have a significant regulated secretion pathway, we cannot determine whether this pathway is affected by frequenin overexpression in our current system. In summary, our results suggest that frequenin-mediated modulation of PI4K activity disrupts the delivery of an apical protein to the plasma membrane of polarized MDCK cells. Thus, in addition to its function in regulating synaptic vesicle release in neuronal cells, frequenin may play a more ubiquitous role in membrane trafficking than has previously been appreciated. Studies are underway to pinpoint the exact step(s) affected by frequenin, as this is likely to reveal interesting mechanistic parallels and differences between constitutive membrane transport and neuronal release.

The comparative analysis of comprehensive genome data bases has uncovered a large set of such proteins, which includes enzymes involved in bacterial-specific intermediary metabolism and those involved in the biosynthesis of the bacterial cell wall. The bacterial cell wall comprises a large number of carbohydrates that are not found in mammalian cells, one of which is the activated form of l-rhamnose, dTDP-l-rhamnose. dTDP-l-rhamnose is found in the O-antigen of many Gram-negative bacteria and is a common constituent of cell wall polysaccharides. dTDP-l-rhamnose is synthesized from α-d-glucose 1-phosphate by a set of four bacterial-specific enzymes, called RmlA through D, whose sequences are highly conserved between different organisms. RmlA, glucose-1-phosphate thymidylyltransferase, catalyzes the synthesis of dTDP-d-glucose from dTTP and α-d-glucose 1-phosphate. The next enzyme in the pathway, dTDP1-d-glucose 4,6-dehydratase (RmlB) reduces dTDP-d-glucose to dTDP-4-keto-6-deoxy-d-glucose in an NADH-dependent reaction. RmlC, dTDP-4-keto-6-deoxy-d-hexulose 3,5-epimerase, then converts dTDP-4-keto-6-deoxy-d-glucose to dTDP-4-keto-l-rhamnose. Finally, RmlD, dTDP-4-keto-l-rhamnose reductase, reduces dTDP-4-keto-l-rhamnose to dTDP-l-rhamnose in an NADPH-dependent reaction (1Graninger M. Nidetzky B. Heinrichs D.E. Whitfield C. Messner P. J.

More recent studies have focused on the molecular genetics and structural biology of the corresponding enzymes (1Graninger M. Nidetzky B. Heinrichs D.E. Whitfield C. Messner P. J. Biol.

In this study, we report the crystal structures of the apo and a ligand-bound form of the RmlC homologue from Methanobacterium thermoautotrophicum, an organism that is one of the target organisms in our structural proteomics effort. Structural analysis of RmlC has uncovered significant structural homology to concanavalin A and has allowed us to hypothesize a mechanism for the dTDP-4-keto-6-deoxy-d-glucose epimerization reaction. The RmlCgene from M. thermoautotrophicum genomic DNA was amplified by polymerase chain reaction and cloned into the pET15b expression vector (Novagen). Recombinant dTDP-4-keto-6-deoxy-d-hexulose epimerase (RmlC) was expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 Gold (DE3) cells (Stratagene) harboring a plasmid encoding three rare E. colitRNA genes (AGG and AGA for Arg and ATA for Ile). Conditions for protein expression and purification were similar to those in the Qiagen protein purification handbook except that a heat step (55 °C for 10 min) and a centrifugation step were introduced after cell lysis to remove most contaminating E. coli proteins. Purified RmlC was dialyzed against 10 mm HEPES and 500 mmNaCl and concentrated to 10 mg/ml using BioMax concentrators (Millipore). For the preparation of selenomethionine (Se-Met) protein, RmlC was expressed in a methionine auxotroph strain B834(DE3) (Novagen) and purified under the same conditions as native RmlC with the addition of 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol in all buffers. Gel filtration of RmlC was performed with a Superdex 200 prep 16/60 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) column equilibrated with 10 mm HEPES and 500 mm NaCl using high performance liquid chromatography (LKB-Wallac). Protein standards included aldolase, bovine serum albumin, ovalbumin, and cytochrome c. Chromatography was performed at 4 °C at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. An initial crystallization condition was obtained with a sparse crystallization matrix (Hampton Research Crystal ScreenTM I) using the hanging drop vapor diffusion technique. This condition was modified slightly by varying the pH and concentration of polyethylene glycol and yielded crystals suitable for native and MAD data collection. The best crystals grew in 10% polyethylene glycol 4000 and 100 mm sodium acetate at pH 4.6 in 2–4 days at 22 °C using hanging drops (3 μl:3 μl protein:precipitant ratio). They reached approximate dimensions of 600 × 200 × 200 microns3. These crystals belonged to space group C2 with unit cell dimensions 67.7 Å × 53.1 Å × 51.7 Å and β = 96.6°. There was a single molecule in the asymmetric unit and the Matthews coefficient was 2.3 Å3/dalton resulting in an estimated solvent content of 46%. Soaking of RmlC crystals was carried out in 10 mmdTDP with 10% polyethylene glycol 4000 and 100 mm sodium acetate at pH 4.6 for 4 h. The structure of RmlC was determined by the MAD method using selenium as the anomalous scatterer. A three-wavelength MAD experiment was performed at the BioCARS 14BMD beamline at the Advanced Photon Source. The high resolution data of the native crystal were also collected with the BioCARS 14BMD beamline. The MAD and native data were processed and scaled with the DENZO/SCALEPACK (3Otwinowski Z. Minor W.

The dTDP complex model was refined against 1.75-Å resolution data to a workingR-factor of 0.195 and a free R-factor of 0.224. This model contains 183 amino acid residues, 119 water molecules, and one molecule of dTDP (Fig. 1). The first two amino acids at the N terminus are not visible in the electron density map in either model. PROCHECK (8Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar) was used to evaluate the stereochemistry of both of the refined models, which showed that more than 90% of the residues are in the allowed region and only one amino acid (Glu-68) was in the disallowed regions, because it is present in a γ turn between β6 and β7. RmlC is a homodimer; this was confirmed by gel filtration analysis (data not shown). The monomer comprises thirteen β-strands and three short α-helices (Fig. 1). Eight of the β-strands are arranged in a central eight-stranded antiparallel β-sheet (strands β5A to β12A) that resembles a jelly roll (Fig. 1). Four other strands β1A, β2A, β3B, and β4B (from subunits A and B) extend from strands β5A, β7A, β10A, and β11A from the jelly roll to form an eight-stranded anti-parallel β-sheet. A second β-sheet is formed by β13A aligned in an antiparallel manner with strands β6A, β8A, β9A, and β11A (Fig.2). The helices are located on the periphery of the molecule. Helix 1 packs against strand β1 from the N-terminal β-sheet. Helices 2 and 3 flank the carboxyl terminus of the subunit and are also involved in important crystal packing interactions. Helix 2 also contributes to the active site of the same subunit. The dimer interface is formed by an extensive set of hydrophobic and electrostatic contacts between β3 and β5, β7 and β7, and α1 and β5. Some of these ionic interactions include Arg-61 to Asp-24 via a water molecule and the formation of two salt bridges (Glu-52 to Arg-76 and Asp-50 to Lys-134). Hydrophobic interactions occur between residues Phe-33 Ala-36, Tyr-28, Arg-26 (aliphatic side chain), Val-48, Val-59, Ile-78, and Leu-138 at the subunit interface. These interactions result in a total buried surface area of 3,042 Å2 out of a total of 16,306 Å2 for the dimer. A search for structural homologues using the program DALI (9Holm L. Sander C. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 233: 123-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (3562) Google Scholar) revealed that RmlC is homologous to concanavalin A, phosphomannose isomerase, and arabinose operon regulatory protein (AraC). The nearest structural neighbor is concanavalin A, which has a Z-score of 6.4 and root mean square deviation (r.m.s.d.) of 1.8 Å over 87 out of 178 Cα atoms. The overall core topology of all these molecules is similar to the jelly roll structural motif. Residues involved in substrate binding and catalysis were identified by determining the structure of RmlC in the presence of a substrate analogue, dTDP. The electron density map of the complex revealed a well ordered dTDP with high occupancy (Fig. 3). The substrate-binding site is located in the center of a cavity formed by the jelly roll structural motif (which is at the middle of one face of one subunit) (Fig. 2). Residues from β-strands 3 and 4 from one subunit combine with β-strands 5, 6, 11, and 12 from the other subunit to form a complete active site. The active site is open at the center of each subunit to permit entry and exit of the ligand through the B-face (Fig.2). The active site is lined with a number of charged residues (Gln-49, Asp-84, Asp-144, Asp-172, Glu-31, Lys-73, Lys-171, Glu-52, Arg-26, Arg-61, His-64, His-120, and Cys-135) and a number of residues with hydrogen-bonding potentials (Ser-53, Ser-55, Ser-169, Gln-49, Glu-3 and Asn-51), which together comprise a potential network for substrate binding and catalysis. The active site is also lined with aromatic residues (Trp-175, Phe-29, Phe-122, Tyr-133 and Tyr-139), which provide favorable environments for the base moiety of dTDP and potentially for the sugar moiety of the substrate (Fig.4).Figure 4A detailed view of the active site of RmlC.

Residues are color-coded based on whether they originate from subunit A (yellow) or B (blue), and the catalytic triad is colored green.

There are, however, some notable differences between the apo- and dTDP-enzymes. The most prominent differences occur within residues 140–144, which are visible in the presence of dTDP. In the presence of the ligand, this loop becomes ordered, closing off a portion of the active site. This loop may be important in regulating the passage of the substrate/product into and out of the active site and may serve to keep the external solvent molecules away from the active site. The dTDP portion of dTDP-4-keto-6-deoxy-d-hexulose anchors the substrate in the active site of the enzyme. dTDP binds between strands β5, β6, β11, and β12 of one subunit and β3 and β4 of the other subunit. Aromatic stacking is observed between Tyr-139 and Phe-29 and the base of dTDP. In fact, the electron density of the side chains of Tyr-133, Tyr-139, and Lys-171 was observed only in the presence of dTDP. Tyr-139 stacks against the base moiety of dTDP and Lys-171 makes ionic interactions with an oxygen of the β-phosphate of dTDP through a water molecule. The base of dTDP is bound in an anticonformation relative to the ribose ring (Fig. 4) by hydrogen bonding to Glu-31B and Gln-49A. The diphosphate portion of dTDP is securely anchored to the protein by ionic interactions between the oxygens of the phosphates with Arg-61A and Arg-26B. In addition to these interactions, there are also a number of interactions between the phosphate oxygens and the enzyme, which are mediated by water molecules (waters 1035, 1036, 1071, and 1095). The use of three-dimensional structural information to generate hypotheses about reaction mechanisms and protein function is likely to be a common occurrence in structural genomics projects, which will provide structural information often in the absence of the corresponding biochemical information. In this instance, a possible reactive center(s) for the epimerization of hexulose by RmlC was determined by analyzing the three-dimensional structure and by applying distance constraints based on existing mechanisms of epimerization (10Thoden J.B. Hegeman A.D. Wesenberg G. Chapeau M.C. Frey P.A. Holden H.M. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 6294-6304Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 11Kopp J. Kopriva S. Suss K.H. Schulz G.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 287: 761-771Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Sugar phosphate epimerization centers are commonly about 5–7 Å away from the phosphorous atom of the β-phosphate (11Kopp J. Kopriva S. Suss K.H. Schulz G.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 287: 761-771Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Within hydrogen-bonding distances from the epimerization centers, we identified a number of ionizable groups (His-64, His-120, Asp-172, Asp-84, and Lys-73) that are able to participate in acid/base chemistry. Both His-64 and His-120 are strategically placed in the active site such that they are proposed to be within hydrogen-bonding distance from the epimerization sites of the hexulose moiety of the substrate. Interestingly, the ε-imine of His-64 is hydrogen-bonded to one of the carboxylates of Asp-172 and similarly for His-120 with Asp-84. Interactions between His and Asp residues of this nature were observed in the active site of mandelate racemase (MR) where they functioned as catalytic dyads in the acid/base mechanism (12Schafer S.L. Barrett W.C. Kallarakal A.T. Mitra B. Kozarich J.W. Gerlt J.A. Clifton J.G. Petsko G.A. Kenyon G.L. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 5662-5669Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). There are also a number of well ordered water molecules occupying this region of the active site and they are within hydrogen-bonding distance to the hexulose moiety of the substrate. These water molecules could potentially be involved in proton exchange with acidic groups in the active site and may even participate in proton transfer to the enolate intermediate of hexulose. To examine the generality of the proposed reaction mechanism, we examined if the residues proposed to be important for binding and catalysis were conserved. The sequences of 17 randomly selected members of the RmlC family were aligned. Thirty residues were conserved in all sequences (Fig.5). Nine of these charged residues (Arg-26, Glu-31, Arg-61, His-64, Lys-73, Asp-84, His-120, Lys-171, and Asp-172) and are located in the active site. Another highly conserved region, which forms strand β6 (residues V59 XRGLHZQ66, whereX is hydrophobic and Z is aromatic), forms the base of the active site (where hexulose would be predicted to be positioned in the reaction). Two of the residues in strand β6, Arg-61 and His-64 are predicted to be involved in substrate binding and the hypothesized catalytic reaction of hexulose epimerization, respectively. Another conserved residue in this region is Gly-62 whose peptide bond is in the cis-conformation. Since this is an energetically unfavorable conformation it may indicate that Gly-62 is required to orient catalytic residues found on β6 in the active site. Notably, the set of invariant residues are found in the sequences of RmlC homologues from many pathogenic bacteria and others, suggesting that the architecture of the active site is also conserved and that this structure might be used to guide the development of antibacterial drugs. While this manuscript was under review, the structure of RmlC from Salmonella typhimurium was published (16Giraud M.F. Leonard G.A. Field R.A. Berlind C. Naismith J.J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 398-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). We thank the staff of BioCARS for their help during data collection at Sector 14 of the Advanced Photon Source.

Interestingly, prokaryotic (P-type) and endoplasmic reticular (ER-type) SPases are functionally equivalent, but structurally quite different, forming two distinct SPase families that share only few conserved residues. P-type SPases were, so far, exclusively identified in eubacteria and organelles, whereas ER-type SPases were found in the three kingdoms of life. Strikingly, the presence of ER-type SPases appears to be limited to sporulating Gram-positive eubacteria. The present studies were aimed at the identification of potential active site residues of the ER-type SPase SipW of Bacillus subtilis, which is required for processing of the spore-associated protein TasA. Conserved serine, histidine, and aspartic acid residues are critical for SipW activity, suggesting that the ER-type SPases employ a Ser-His-Asp catalytic triad or, alternatively, a Ser-His catalytic dyad. In contrast, the P-type SPases employ a Ser-Lys catalytic dyad (Paetzel, M., Dalbey, R. E., and Strynadka, N. C. J. (1998) Nature 396, 186–190).

These similarities include the direction of protein transport (i.e. export from the cytoplasm), the targeting signal (i.e. the signal peptide), the signal recognition particle, components of the translocation channel, signal peptidases (SPases), and thiol-disulfide oxidoreductases (for reviews, see Refs.1Dalbey R.E.

Notwithstanding these similarities, significant differences between protein transport across bacterial plasma membranes and the ER membrane do exist. First, protein transport is energized in different ways. Although bacterial protein export requires a cytosolic force-generator (i.e. SecA), and the proton-motive-force (5den Blaauwen T.

Second, as exemplified by the SPases, the similarities between components of the different protein transport machineries are rather weak (see Refs. 1Dalbey R.E. Lively M.O. Bron S. van Dijl J.M. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 1129-1138Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar and 2Pohlschröder M. Prinz W.A. Hartmann E. Beckwith J.

Homologous SPases have been identified in Gram-positive and Gram-negative eubacteria, the inner membrane of yeast mitochondria, the thylakoid membrane of chloroplasts, archaea, and the ER membranes of yeast and higher eukaryotes, such as Homo sapiens (Ref. 1Dalbey R.E. Lively M.O. Bron S. van Dijl J.M. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 1129-1138Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar; see Fig. 1). These enzymes, which remove signal peptides from translocated proteins, are required for the release of the mature protein from the trans side of the membrane (for reviews, see Refs. 1Dalbey R.E. Lively M.O. Bron S. van Dijl J.M. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 1129-1138Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar and 13Pugsley A.P. Microbiol. Rev. 1993; 57: 50-108Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We have previously shown that SPases can be divided into two distinct subfamilies, denoted P- and ER-type SPases. P-type SPases were exclusively identified in eubacteria, mitochondria, and chloroplasts, whereas ER-type SPases were identified in eukaryotes, archaea, and four sporulating Gram-positive eubacteria, Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus amyloliquefaciens, Bacillus anthracis, and Clostridium perfringens (Ref. 14Tjalsma H. Bolhuis A. van Roosmalen M.L. Wiegert T. Schumann W. Broekhuizen C.P. Quax W.J. Venema G. Bron S. van Dijl J.M. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2318-2331Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar; see Fig. 1). Recent studies have provided strong evidence that the P-type SPases employ a Ser-Lys catalytic dyad (1Dalbey R.E. Lively M.O. Bron S. van Dijl J.M. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 1129-1138Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar, 15Paetzel M. Dalbey R.E. Strynadka N.C.J. Nature. 1998; 396: 186-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar) In contrast, the catalytic mechanism of the ER-type SPases remains to be elucidated (16VanValkenburg C. Xuemin C. Mullins C. Fang H. Green N. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11519-11525Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The observation that B. subtilis contained an ER-type SPase, denoted SipW, was remarkable for two reasons. First, SipW represented the first ER-type SPase identified in a eubacterium. Second, SipW happened to be the fifth chromosomally encoded SPase of B. subtilis (14Tjalsma H. Bolhuis A. van Roosmalen M.L. Wiegert T. Schumann W. Broekhuizen C.P. Quax W.J. Venema G. Bron S. van Dijl J.M. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2318-2331Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). In contrast to SipW, the other four SPases ofB. subtilis, denoted SipS, SipT, SipU, and SipV, are of the P-type (14Tjalsma H. Bolhuis A. van Roosmalen M.L. Wiegert T. Schumann W. Broekhuizen C.P.

Chem. 1997; 272: 25983-25992Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Notably, SipU, SipV, and SipW are of minor importance for the processing of secretory pre-proteins, in contrast to SipS and SipT, which are critical for protein secretion and viability (14Tjalsma H. Bolhuis A. van Roosmalen M.L. Wiegert T. Schumann W. Broekhuizen C.P. Quax W.J. Venema G. Bron S. van Dijl J.M.

Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 2448-2454Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This suggested that SipU, SipV, and SipW might be required for the processing of a specific subset of the approximately 180 predicted pre-proteins of B. subtilis. The latter hypothesis was recently confirmed for SipW, which was shown to be required for the processing of the spore-associated protein TasA, displaying antibacterial activities (20Stöver A.G. Driks A. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 1664-1672Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Consistent with a role in sporulation, the expression of the tasA gene (previously known ascotN; Ref. 14Tjalsma H. Bolhuis A. van Roosmalen M.L. Wiegert T. Schumann W. Broekhuizen C.P. Quax W.J. Venema G. Bron S. van Dijl J.M. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2318-2331Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar), which is located immediately downstream of the sipW gene, depended on the post-exponential growth phase-specific transcription factors SpoOA and SpoOH (20Stöver A.G. Driks A. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 1664-1672Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 21Stöver A.G. Driks A. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 5476-5481Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, TasA was not only incorporated into spores, but also secreted into the growth medium. Similar to TasA, the YqxM pre-protein, which is specified by a gene that is located immediately upstream of the sipW gene, was also processed and secreted in a SipW-dependent manner. In contrast to TasA, mature YqxM was not incorporated into spores (22Stöver A.G. Driks A. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 7065-7069Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The present studies were aimed at the identification of potential active site residues of SipW. For this purpose, TasA was an ideal reporter because its processing is strongly dependent on the presence of the SipW protein (20Stöver A.G. Driks A. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 1664-1672Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 23Serrano M. Zilhao R. Ricca E. Ozin A.J. Moran Jr., C.P. Henriques A.O. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 3632-3643Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, in contrast to YqxM, the precursor and mature forms of TasA can be readily detected in sporulating cells of B. subtilis. Finally, TasA could be used to study the importance of processing by SipW for the incorporation of this protein into spores, as neither TasA nor SipW is required for the sporulation process per se. The results show that conserved Ser, His, and Asp residues are critical for the activity of SipW, and that catalytically active SipW is required for the incorporation of mature TasA into spores.

Bron S. van Dijl J.M. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 17: 621-631Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) in such a way thatsipW transcription is driven by the constitutive erythromycin promoter. Site-directed mutations were introduced into plasmid-borne copies of sipW by a two-step PCR approach (29van Dijl J.M. de Jong A. Venema G. Bron S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3611-3618Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), using lbw-1, lbw-2, and the mutagenic oligonucleotides shown in Table II. Amplified fragments were cleaved with SalI andEcoRI, and ligated into the corresponding sites of pGDL48. The resulting plasmids were named pW-x, where x indicates the position and type of amino acid substitution in the corresponding SipW mutant protein.Table IIOligonucleotides used for sipW mutagenesisPrimerSequenceLbw-15′-aagtcgacAGAAGGAAAGCGGGGAAGAGGAGGATG-3′Lbw-25′-aagaattcTTGCCAGGTTTACAACTG-3′W-S47A5′-GAACTCCGGCTCCATCGcACCTGACAGAACTG-3′W-H87A5′-GCAAATACGGCGGTCACCgcCAGAATTGTgGACATAACAAAGCAAGG-3′W-H87K5′-GCAAATACGGCGGTCACCaAgAGAATTGTgGACATAACAAAGCAAGG-3′W-R88A5′-GCAAATACGGCGGTCACCCACgcAATTGTgGACATAACAAAGCAAGG-3′W-K104A5′-GGAGACCATTTGTTATTcAAAACAgcAGGTGATAATAATGCAGC-3′W-D106A5′-GGAGACCATTTGTTATTcAAAACAAAAGGTGcTAATAATGCAGCAGCTG-3′W-D112A5′-GGAGACCATTTGTTATTcAAAACAAAAGGTGATAATAATGCAGCAGCTGaTTCAGCGCCTGTATCGG-3′Mismatches with the original sequence of sipW are indicated in lowercase letters.

To this purpose, cells were resuspended in protoplast buffer (20 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.5, 15 mm MgCl2, 20% sucrose) and incubated for 30 min in the presence of 0.5 mg/ml lysozyme (37 °C). Next, the protoplasts were collected by centrifugation and resuspended in fresh protoplast buffer. If desired, the protoplast-supernatant, which contains cell wall-associated proteins, was collected and used for SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. The protease accessibility of (membrane-associated) proteins was tested by incubating the protoplasts at 37 °C in the presence of 1 mg/ml trypsin (Sigma) for 30 min. In parallel, protoplasts were incubated without trypsin, or in the presence of trypsin and 1% Triton X-100. To isolate endospores, protoplasts were lysed by incubation for 5 min in protoplast buffer containing 1% Triton X-100. To release proteins from the spore envelope, spores were collected by centrifugation, resuspended in protoplast buffer, and incubated for 30 min in the presence of 1 mg/ml lysozyme (37 °C). Next, the samples were incubated at 37 °C in the presence of 1 mg/ml trypsin (Sigma) and 1% Triton X-100 for 30 min to test the protease sensitivity of spore-associated proteins. All trypsin digestions were terminated by the addition of 1.2 mg/ml trypsin inhibitor (Sigma), before boiling in loading buffer for SDS-PAGE. To obtain SipW-specific antibodies, the pET32a plasmid (Novagen) was used to fuse part of SipW (residues 25–133; lacking its putative membrane anchors) to a thioredoxin fragment containing a hexahistidine tag. The fusion protein was expressed in E. coli, and purified by metal affinity chromatography using the Talon resin supplied byCLONTECH. Rabbits were immunized with the fusion protein at Eurogentec. Western blotting was performed as described by Kyhse-Andersen (31Kyhse-Andersen J. J. Biochem. Biophys. Methods. 1984; 10: 203-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (2158) Google Scholar). Samples for SDS-PAGE were prepared as described by van Dijl et al. (32van Dijl J.M. de Jong A. Smith H. Bron S. Venema G. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1991; 227: 40-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). After separation by SDS-PAGE, proteins were transferred to Immobilon PVDF membranes (Millipore Corp.). (Pre-)TasA, SipW, GroEL, β-lactamase, or SspB-LacZ, were visualized with specific antibodies and horseradish peroxidase anti-rabbit-IgG conjugates (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Thus far, genes for 19 different ER-type SPases have been identified in Gram-positive eubacteria, archaea, and eukaryotes. This allowed a detailed comparison of the deduced amino acid sequences of these enzymes (Fig.1), which showed that they consist of a highly conserved amino-terminal moiety (Fig.2 A, indicated withER-C) and a highly variable carboxyl-terminal moiety (Fig.2 A, indicated with ER-V). In some enzymes, the variable moiety contains one or three putative membrane spanning domains (Fig. 2 B). The highly conserved moiety contains one amino-terminal membrane anchor (A) and four conserved domains (B–E), which are present in all known P- and ER-type SPases (Fig. 1; see Refs. 1Dalbey R.E.

Domain B contains the conserved serine residue, which has been shown to be critical for the activity of P-type SPases from E. coli (15Paetzel M. Dalbey R.E. Strynadka N.C.J.

Science. 1993; 262: 1997-2004Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Streches of conserved amino acids resembling domain C of the P-type SPases, which seems to be involved in substrate binding (15Paetzel M. Dalbey R.E. Strynadka N.C.J. Nature. 1998; 396: 186-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar) and catalysis (46Bolhuis A. Tjalsma H. Stephenson K. Harwood C.R. Venema G. Bron S. van Dijl J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 15865-15868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), can be found twice in ER-type SPases (Fig. 1, domain C andC′). Domain D of the ER-type SPases contains a strictly conserved histidine residue, replacing the strictly conserved lysine residue in domain D of the P-type SPases. Finally, domain E contains two conserved aspartic acid residues, the equivalents of which are involved in salt bridge formation in the P-type SPases (15Paetzel M. Dalbey R.E. Strynadka N.C.J. Nature. 1998; 396: 186-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar, 47Klenotic P.A. Carlos J.L. Samuelson J.C. Schuenemann T.A. Tschantz W.R. Paetzel M. Strynadka N.C.J. Dalbey R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6490-6498Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Recent observations indicate that these salt bridges are important determinants for the stability of some P-type SPases, such as SipS ofB. subtilis (29van Dijl J.M. de Jong A. Venema G. Bron S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3611-3618Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 46Bolhuis A. Tjalsma H. Stephenson K. Harwood C.R. Venema G. Bron S. van Dijl J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 15865-15868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Interestingly, domain E of the Sec11 protein of Archeoglobus fulgidus seems to be duplicated (Fig. 1). Taken together, these observations suggest that the conserved residues in domains B–E are required for the catalytic activity and/or stability of the ER-type SPases. To investigate whether the conserved residues of domains A–E of the ER-type SPases are required for the activity of SipW of B. subtilis, we exploited the recent observation that SipW is of major importance for processing of the spore-associated protein TasA (20Stöver A.G. Driks A. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 1664-1672Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To this purpose, a plasmid-based complementation system was developed, involving B. subtilis strain ΔW-CtasA, which lacks SipW (“ΔW”) and constitutively produces pre-TasA (“CtasA”). First, B. subtilis ΔW-CtasA was transformed with pGDL140 (“SipW”; constitutive expression of sipW), pGDL41 (“SipS”; 5-fold overproduction of SipS in the stationary growth phase; data not shown), or pGDL48 (“empty vector”; no SPase overproduction). Next, the effects on the processing of pre-TasA to the mature form were evaluated by growing the resulting strains in TY medium, sampling after 4, 16, and 32 h of post-exponential growth, and Western blotting of total cell and sporangial lysates. The results show that after 4 h of post-exponential growth (t= 4), only pre-TasA was present in cells of B. subtilisΔW-CtasA, irrespective of the (over)production of SipS or SipW (Fig. 3 A). The observation that the presence of multiple copies of sipW did not stimulate pre-TasA processing at t = 4 suggests that SipW requires an as yet unidentified partner protein that is not (yet) expressed at this time. In contrast, after 16 h of post-exponential growth (t = 16), B. subtilis ΔW-CtasA cells producing SipW contained both the precursor and mature forms of TasA, whereas no mature TasA was observed in B. subtilis ΔW-CtasAcells lacking SipW (Fig. 3 A). Finally, after 32 h (t = 32), most TasA molecules in B. subtilis ΔW-CtasA cells producing SipW were mature. In contrast, significantly lower amounts of mature TasA were detectable in B. subtilis ΔW-CtasA cells lacking SipW (Fig. 3 A). The SipW-independent processing of pre-TasA att = 32 was not affected by SipS overproduction, suggesting that one or more other SPases are responsible for this effect. As no SipW-independent processing of pre-TasA was observed att = 16, this time point was selected to monitor the activity of SipW proteins with site-specific mutations. To investigate the importance for pre-TasA processing of conserved residues in domains B–E of SipW, the residues Ser-47, His-87, Arg-88, Lys-104, Asp-106, or Asp-112 were replaced by alanine (see Fig. 1; note that the latter residue numbers correspond to the sequence of SipW ofB. subtilis (Bsu)). Alanine was chosen because it is small, and has a chemically inert side chain, minimizing conformational strain and indirect effects on catalysis. To monitor pre-TasA processing by the various SipW mutant proteins, B. subtilis ΔW-CtasA was transformed with plasmids encoding wild-type SipW (positive control), the SipW mutant proteins S47A, H87A, R88A, K104A, D106A, or D112A, or SipS (negative control). The resulting strains were grown in TY medium until t = 16. As demonstrated by Western blotting, more than 50% of the TasA molecules in cells producing SipW-R88A, -K104A, or -D112A was in the mature form, similar to cells producing wild-type SipW (Fig.3 B), showing that Arg-88, Lys-104, and Asp-112 are not important for pre-TasA processing. In contrast, very low amounts of mature TasA were detectable in cells producing SipW-D106A. No mature TasA was detectable in cells producing SipW-S47A or -H87A, as in SipS-producing cells. These results show that the conserved serine and histidine residues of SipW are critical for the processing of pre-TasA, and that Asp-106 is very important for this activity. Notably, the conserved His-87 of SipW could be replaced by lysine without loss of pre-TasA processing (Fig. 3 D), suggesting that a basic residue at this position is required for activity of SipW. Unexpectedly, only the completely inactive SipW-S47A and -H87A mutant proteins reacted (weakly) with a SipW-specific antibody, whereas neither wild-type SipW nor the active SipW mutant proteins, including SipW-D106A, were detectable (Fig. 3 C,upper panel). This weak interaction, or the complete absence of reactivity between SipW (mutant proteins) and SipW-specific antibodies was not due to a loss ofsipW-containing plasmids, as shown by the detection of comparable amounts of the plasmid-encoded β-lactamase in all samples (Fig. 3 C, lower panel). The latter observations suggest that the catalytically active forms of SipW are subject to self-cleavage, as described previously for the purified SPase of E. coli (49Talarico T.L. Dev I.K. Bassford P.J. Ray P.H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 181: 650-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). In summary, these results suggest that Ser-47 and His-87 are involved in catalysis, and that Asp-106 is either involved in catalysis or in maintaining a stable conformation. To investigate the importance of SipW for TasA incorporation into spores, fractionation experiments were performed (schematically presented in Fig.4 A), in which the cytosolic GroEL protein was used as a reference marker for protoplast integrity and, upon permeabilization of membranes with Triton X-100, trypsin activity. As shown with B. subtilis ΔW-CtasA(pGDL140), at t = 32, TasA has a dual localization in sporulating cells producing SipW. First, a significant fraction of the mature TasA could be released from these cells by protoplasting, showing that these molecules were present in the cell wall (Fig.4 B). Second, pre-TasA remained protoplast-associated, but was degraded when trypsin was added to the protoplasts, showing that this form of TasA accumulated at the membrane-cell wall interface. Third, significant amounts of mature TasA remained associated with the protoplasts in a trypsin-resistant form. The latter TasA molecules were not degraded by trypsin when the protoplasts were lysed with Triton X-100. In fact, these molecules were associated with spores, and they only became accessible to trypsin upon incubation of isolated spores with lysozyme and Triton X-100 (Fig. 4 A; note that lysozyme and Triton X-100 were sufficient to cause spore lysis due to the absence of a spore coat in B. subtilisΔW-CtasA). In contrast, all mature TasA produced byB. subtilis ΔW-CtasA (pGDL41), which lacks SipW, was released from the sporulating cells by protoplasting, showing that it was localized in the cell wall of the mother cell and not in spores (Fig. 4 C). Similar to SipW-producing cells, the pre-TasA molecules accumulating in cells lacking SipW were protoplast-associated and, upon protoplasting, accessible to trypsin, indicating that they were localized at the membrane-cell wall interface of the mother cell. In addition, a specific 29-kDa degradation product of TasA (d), which accumulates in the absence of SipW, was localized at the membrane-cell wall interface. To verify whether the above fractionation experiments truly reflected the situation in sporulating cells that are wild-type with respect to the temporally controlled synthesis of TasA and SipW, similar fractionation experiments were performed with B. subtilisPM8. This strain offers the advantage that it produces the E. coli β-galactosidase (LacZ) exclusively in the forespore (26Mason J.M. Hackett R.H. Setlow P. J. Bacteriol. 1988; 170: 239-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar,27Margolis P. Driks A. Losick R. Science. 1991; 254: 562-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Thus, the fractionation of spore-associated proteins can be monitored with antibodies against LacZ. This was not possible with antibodies against GroEL as this protein appears to be absent from spores (Fig. 4, B and C). As shown in Fig.4 D, B. subtilis PM8 showed similar fractionation patterns for TasA and GroEL as B. subtilisΔW-CtasA (pGDL140) (Fig. 4 B). Furthermore, LacZ cofractionated with spores. Notably, a significant fraction of the LacZ molecules appeared to be trypsin-sensitive upon protoplast lysis, indicating that the spores were not yet mature. To determine whether active SipW is required for the sorting of TasA to spores, fractionation experiments were performed with B. subtilis ΔW-CtasA producing SipW mutant proteins. As shown in Fig. 5, trypsin-resistant mature TasA was absent from protoplasts of B. subtilisΔW-CtasA producing the S47A or H87A SipW mutant proteins. In contrast, trypsin-resistant mature TasA was present in protoplasts of B. subtilis ΔW-CtasA producing the H87K, R88A, K104A, D106A, or D112A SipW mutant proteins, or wild-type SipW. Irrespective of the presence of active or inactive mutant SipW proteins, the pre-TasA accumulating in protoplasts of B. subtilis ΔW-CtasA was accessible to trypsin (Fig.5). In summary, these observations show that active SipW is required for the incorporation of mature TasA into spores, but not for the accumulation of mature TasA in the cell wall of sporulating cells. In the present studies, we document the importance of SipW for processing of pre-TasA and incorporation of mature TasA into spores. Translocated pre-TasA was almost exclusively processed by SipW, a process that requires three conserved residues (i.e. Ser-47, His-87, and Asp-106) of this SPase. In sporulating cells lacking active SipW, TasA did not reach the spores. Instead, TasA precursors were translocated across and remained attached to the cytoplasmic membrane, most likely with their uncleaved signal peptides. Upon prolonged growth in the absence of SipW, pre-TasA was processed by other, yet unidentified, SPases of B. subtilis. Most likely, this alternative pre-TasA processing is a result of the combined activities of SipS, SipT, SipU, and/or SipV, as the SPases of B. subtilis, including SipW, have overlapping substrate specificities (14Tjalsma H. Bolhuis A. van Roosmalen M.L. Wiegert T. Schumann W. Broekhuizen C.P. Quax W.J. Venema G. Bron S. van Dijl J.M. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2318-2331Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 18Tjalsma H.

Strikingly, mature TasA produced by alternative processing in the absence of SipW did not reach the spores, but remained associated with the cell wall. This shows that the presence of SipW is a prerequisite for the incorporation of mature TasA into spores. Interestingly, this process requires active SipW and cannot be promoted by catalytically inactive SipW molecules. It is presently not clear how SipW functions as a determinant for the incorporation of TasA into spores, or why alternatively processed mature TasA is not incorporated into spores. As recently confirmed by the crystal structure of a catalytically active soluble fragment of the E. coli SPase I (15Paetzel M. Dalbey R.E. Strynadka N.C.J. Nature. 1998; 396: 186-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar), also known as leader peptidase, P-type SPases employ a Ser-Lys catalytic dyad, similar to LexA-like proteases (29van Dijl J.M. de Jong A. Venema G. Bron S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3611-3618Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 45Nunnari J. Fox T.D. Walter P.

The observations that the catalytic serine residue of the P-type SPases is well conserved in the ER-type SPases, and that this conserved serine residue (Ser-47) is essential for the activity of SipW, indicate that the ER-type SPases employ a serine residue for catalysis. Notably, the ER-type SPases contain a strictly conserved histidine residue instead of the catalytic lysine residue of the P-type SPases (17van Dijl J.M. de Jong A. Vehmaanper J. Venema G. Bron S. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 2819-2828Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 53Dalbey R.E. von Heijne G. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1992; 17: 474-478Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). This conserved histidine residue (His-87) is essential for activity of SipW. Taken together, these findings suggest that Ser-47 of SipW acts as a nucleophile that attacks the carbonyl carbon of the scissile peptide bond, whereas His-87 acts as a general base by stripping the proton from the hydroxyl group of the serine side chain. A similar role has been proposed for the corresponding serine and histidine residues of Sec11p from yeast (16VanValkenburg C. Xuemin C. Mullins C. Fang H. Green N. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11519-11525Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The role of the strictly conserved Asp-106 residue of SipW, which is important, but not essential, for activity, is less clear. First, by analogy to the classical serine proteases, Asp-106 could form a catalytic triad together with Ser-47 and His-87, thereby serving to keep the side chain of His-87 deprotonated. Second, Asp-106 could be a determinant for the stability of SipW, as described previously for Asp-146 of SipS of B. subtilis (14Tjalsma H. Bolhuis A. van Roosmalen M.L. Wiegert T. Schumann W.

Chem. 1995; 270: 3611-3618Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) and Asp-103 of Sec11p (16VanValkenburg C. Xuemin C. Mullins C. Fang H. Green N. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11519-11525Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The latter hypothesis is supported by the observation that both aspartic acid residues are present at equivalent positions in the conserved domain E of P- and ER-type SPases. Furthermore, the recent observation that the equivalent Asp residue in domain E of the SPase I of E. coli is not required for activity (49Talarico T.L. Dev I.K. Bassford P.J. Ray P.H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 181: 650-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) suggests that this conserved Asp residue has a structural rather than a catalytic function. Thus, it is possible that ER-type SPases, such as SipW, employ a Ser-His catalytic dyad, instead of the Ser-His-Asp catalytic triad of the classical serine proteases. The latter view is strongly supported by the observation that the potential active site His-47 residue of SipW can be replaced by lysine without loss of pre-TasA processing activity. This implies that the catalytic mechanisms of P-type SPases and ER-type SPases are, at least to some extent, related. We thank Drs. A. Bolhuis, J. D. H. Jongbloed, M. L. van Roosmalen, and other members of the EuropeanBacillus Secretion Group for useful discussions."

Although all myosins share basic structural and enzymatic features, they differ widely in their physiologic behavior. Comparing myosin II and myosin V provides an illustrative example (1Mehta A.D.

Myosin V is designed to work as a single, processive motor, whereas myosin II is designed to work in a large, filamentous ensemble. Even within the myosin II family there are major differences in shortening velocity, economy of force production, and in vitro motility between fast myosins, such as those from vertebrate skeletal muscle, and slow myosins, including vertebrate smooth muscle and non-muscle myosin II (3Ruppel K.M. Spudich J.A. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1996; 12: 543-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Because all myosins appear to use the same general kinetic scheme for their ATPase cycles, differences in their properties must be reflected in corresponding differences in the rate and equilibrium constants that describe the individual kinetic schemes. During the course of its ATPase cycle, myosin alternates between conformations that bind actin weakly and those that bind actin strongly (4Arner A. Malmqvist U. Acta Physiol.

The strong binding conformations generate force, and the lifetime of the strong binding state limits the rate of actin-myosin filament sliding. One of the major differences between myosin isoforms is in the duty ratio, which is defined as the fraction of the total cycle time that a myosin isoform spends in a strong binding conformation (6Guilford W.H.

Warshaw D.M. Biophys. J. 1995; 68: 256-258PubMed Google Scholar). Such differences have been described between fast skeletal and smooth muscle myosin II and include an increased duty ratio, as well as slower rates of hydrolysis (8Rosenfeld S.S. Taylor E.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 11908-11919Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and ADP release (9Rosenfeld S.S. Taylor E.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 9994-9999Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) for smooth muscle myosin II. An increase in the duty ratio of smooth muscle myosin II implies a longer lifetime of the strong binding state, which under physiologic conditions means a longer lifetime of ADP-bound state(s) (4Arner A. Malmqvist U. Acta Physiol. Scand. 1998; 164: 363-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). This could be accomplished either by adding an additional, unique actomyosin:ADP state for smooth muscle myosin or by slowing the ADP release step. Information relevant to this issue has been obtained from structural studies of gizzard S1. Whittaker et al. (10Whittaker M. Wilson-Kubalek E.M. Smith J.E. Faust L. Milligan R.A. Sweeney H.L. Nature. 1995; 378: 748-751Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar) produced three-dimensional density maps of nucleotide-free and ADP-bound chicken gizzard acto-S1, generated by cryo-electron microscopy and helical image reconstruction. These maps demonstrated that ADP release induces an additional 23o tilt of the regulatory domain. Similar conclusions were also reached from studies utilizing EPR spectroscopy and x-ray fiber diffraction (11Gollub J. Cremo C.R. Cooke R. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 796-802Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 12Poole K.I.V. Lorenz M. Ellison P. Evans G. Rosenbaum G. Boesecke P. Holmes K.C. Cremo C.R. J. Muscle Res. Cell Motil. 1997; 18: 179-268Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), as well as from studies with brush border myosin I (13Jontes J.D. Wilson-Kubalek E.M. Milligan R.A. Nature. 1995; 378: 751-753Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Interestingly, this movement is not seen in the corresponding skeletal muscle isoform (10Whittaker M. Wilson-Kubalek E.M. Smith J.E. Faust L. Milligan R.A. Sweeney H.L. Nature. 1995; 378: 748-751Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). These findings have been interpreted to mean that ADP release contributes to the power stroke in a subset of myosin II isoforms, as well as in some of the unconventional myosins (13Jontes J.D. Wilson-Kubalek E.M. Milligan R.A. Nature. 1995; 378: 751-753Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 14Jontes J.D. Milligan R.A. Pollard T.D. Ostap E.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 14332-14337Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), perhaps through the presence of an additional structural transition not present in skeletal muscle myosin II. However, several other lines of evidence call into question the significance of this extra tilt. Cremo and Geeves (15Cremo C.R. Geeves M.A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 1969-1978Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar) examined the equilibrium binding and kinetic properties of smooth muscle S1:ADP1 with actin. They concluded that the tight affinity of ADP for acto-S1 (K d = 5 μm) would make ADP release energetically unfavorable under physiologic conditions and therefore could not provide free energy to drive rotation of the regulatory domain. Furthermore, equilibrium binding data were used to argue that the thermodynamic coupling between ADP and actin binding to S1 was appreciably lower in smooth muscle than in skeletal muscle myosin, which suggested a strain-dependent mechanism would be required to drive ADP release. Dantzig et al. (16Dantzig J.A. Barsotti R.J. Manz S. Sweeney H.L. Goldman Y.E. Biophys. J. 1999; 77: 386-397Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) examined the effects of MgADP on rigor tension in gizzard smooth muscle and found that, contrary to expectation, its addition did not reduce tension. They postulated that the additional movement of the regulatory domain may contribute to the latch state, by slowing release of ADP from attached heads. The presence of an additional tilt in the mechanism of smooth muscle myosin II implies that there is an additional actomyosin ADP intermediate in the pathway of nucleotide dissociation. If this is so, the rate of transition through this intermediate might contribute to economy of force production by smooth and non-muscle myosin II isoforms by controlling the rate of ADP release. In order to evaluate this, we have examined the interactions of ADP with smooth muscle S1 and acto-S1 with transient fluorescent and kinetic methodologies. We have also examined myosin II from Dictyostelium, which has been the subject of extensive structural and biochemical characterization (17Gulick A.M. Bauer C.B. Thoden J, B. Rayment I. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 11619-11628Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar, 18Smith C.A. Rayment I. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 5404-5417Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar, 19Fisher A.J. Smith C.A. Thoden J.B. Smith R. Sutoh K. Holden H.M. Rayment I. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 8960-8972Crossref PubMed Scopus (629) Google Scholar). Although we find evidence for only one myosin:ADP state for myosin II from Dictyostelium, corresponding studies on smooth muscle myosin II clearly demonstrate the presence of two such states, both of which are on the pathway to ADP release. The relevance of these results to models of strain-dependent release will be discussed. The N-methylanthraniloyl derivative of 2′deoxy-ADP was synthesized as described (20Hiratsuka T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1983; 742: 496-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). N-1-pyrenyl iodoacetamide was obtained from Molecular Probes (Portland, OR). Protease inhibitors and chemicals used for buffers were obtained from Sigma. Sephacryl S-300-HR and prepoured Sephadex G-25 columns were obtained from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Dephosphorylated smooth muscle myosin was obtained from chicken gizzards (21Persechini A. Hartshorne D.J. Biochemistry. 1983; 22: 470-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Actin was prepared from rabbit acetone powder as described (22Spudich J.A. Watt S. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 4866-4871Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). S-1 was prepared by digestion of myosin withStaphylococcus aureus V8 protease and column purified on Sephacryl S-300-HR (23Ikebe M. Hartshorne D.J. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 6177-6185Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). All myosin heavy chain constructs were subcloned into the baculovirus transfer vector, pVL 1393 (Invitrogen). Generation of the recombinant baculoviruses coding for the myosin heavy chain constructs followed published techniques (24Liepnieks J.J. Light A. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 1677-1683Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Expression of these constructs with the smooth regulatory and essential (LC17a) light chains and subsequent purification of the recombinant myosins followed published procedures (25Summers M.D. Smith G.E. Tex. Agric. Exp. Stn. Bull. 1987; : 1555Google Scholar). To generate the recombinant Dictyostelium myosin S1, the cDNA for Dictyostelium myosin II was truncated at the codon corresponding to lysine 833 to create an S1-like fragment. A Flag peptide sequence (35Hopp T.P. Prickett K.S. Prince V. Libby R.T. March C.J. Cerretti P. Urdal D.L. Conlon P.J. Bio/Technology. 1988; 6: 1205-1210Crossref Scopus (743) Google Scholar) followed by a stop codon was appended. The S1-like construct and the Dictyostelium cDNAs encoding for the regulatory and essential light chains were subcloned into baculovirus transfer vectors (pVL 1392/93, Invitrogen). Expression of the truncated heavy chain with the regulatory and essential light chains and subsequent purification of the recombinantDictyostelium myosin followed published procedures (30Sweeney H.L. Rosenfeld S.S. Brown F. Faust L. Smith J. Xing J. Stein L. Sellers J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6262-6270Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Actin was labeled at cysteine 374 withN-1-pyrenyl iodoacetamide as described (26Cooper J.A. Walker S.B. Pollard T.D. J. Muscle Res. Cell Motil. 1983; 4: 253-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar). Steady state fluorescence measurements were made on an SLM/Aminco 8000C fluorescence spectrophotometer, with sample holder thermostated at 20 °C. Fluorescence lifetimes were measured using a picosecond laser as excitation source, as described (27Rosenfeld S.S. Correia J.J. Xing J. Rener B. Gong W. Cheung H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30212-30222Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) in samples that had been equilibrated in 20 mm KCl, 25 mm Hepes, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, pH 7.50. Measurements of the rates of mant nucleotide and pyrenyl actin binding to and release from S1 were made using a Hi-Tech Scientific stopped-flow spectrometer equipped with a 150-watt xenon lamp. The instrument dead time was determined to be 1.4 ms. For studies with mant nucleotide, fluorescence was excited by energy transfer from protein tryptophan, using a 295 nm input from a monochrometer, and a 400 nm cut filter was used to measure the fluorescence emission at a right angle from the incident beam. Data were fit to a sum of exponentials. For studies using pyrene actin fluorescence, the excitation wavelength was 365 nm, and a 405 nm interference filter was used to collect the fluorescence emission (Omega Optical). Proteins were run on SDS-polyacrylamide electrophoresis as described (28Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205531) Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were determined colorimetrically (Bio-Rad Protein Assay). Recombinant S1, derived from Dictyostelium and smooth myosin II, at 2–5 mg/ml in 10 mm imidazole, pH 7.0, 50 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm EGTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol was used to decorate rabbit skeletal muscle actin filaments adsorbed to holey carbon support films on EM grids. For the nucleotide-free condition, apyrase was added to the solution (final concentration ∼10 IU/ml) on the grid just prior to blotting and freezing in liquid ethane slush. For the ADP condition, the myosin buffer was supplemented with 5 mm MgADP. A Gatan cold stage, operating at −180 °C, was used to examine the grids in a Philips CM200 FEG electron microscope. Images of filaments spanning holes in the support film were recorded at 40,000× at 1.1–2.0 μm under focus. Selected images of well ordered filaments were digitized with spot and step sizes equivalent to 4.97 Å at the specimen. Image analysis, averaging, and calculation of three-dimensional maps were carried out essentially as described previously (29Sosa H. Dias D.P. Hoenger A. Whittaker M. Wilson-Kubalek E. Sablin E. Fletterick R.J. Vale R.D. Milligan R.A. Cell. 1997; 90: 217-224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). The three-dimensional maps were visualized with Volvis. We had previously shown that the fluorescence of recombinant smooth muscle S1 complexed with the fluorescent ADP analogue 2′dmD could be characterized by two lifetimes, suggesting that smooth S1:ADP consists of an equilibrium mixture of two states (30Sweeney H.L. Rosenfeld S.S. Brown F. Faust L. Smith J. Xing J. Stein L. Sellers J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6262-6270Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). In order to examine this more closely, we prepared proteolytic gizzard S1, and we measured the time-dependent fluorescence decays of complexes with 2′dmD as a function of temperature. The large concentrations of protein required for these measurements precluded our performing this experiment with recombinant S1. At all temperatures, the decay data could be adequately fitted to the sum of two exponentials, yielding two lifetimes. At 20 °C, the lifetimes of these components were 7.95 ± 0.30 and 0.81 ± 0.10 ns, with fractional amplitudes of 0.72 and 0.28, respectively (Table I). Neither of these lifetimes represents unbound nucleotide, since the lifetime of unbound mant-ADP is 3.8 ± 0.2 ns (27Rosenfeld S.S. Correia J.J. Xing J. Rener B. Gong W. Cheung H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30212-30222Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), and at the concentration of S1 used in this study (110 μm), less than 1% of the nucleotide should be unbound. In order to determine the equilibrium constant between these two states, it is necessary to determine the fractional intensity of each component. For a two component system, the fractional intensities (f 1and f 2) are given by Equation 1,Table IFluorescence lifetimes and equilibrium constants for complexes of S1 and acto-S1 with 2′dmDSampleSourceTτ1f 1τ2f 2K(= f 2/f 1)°CnsnsS1:2′dmDProteolytic108.45 ± 0.320.980.47 ± 0.130.0110.011S1:2′dmDProteolytic207.95 ± 0.350.950.81 ± 0.180.0430.045S1:2′dmDRecombinant208.73 ± 0.200.931.8 ± 0.100.070.075Acto-S1:2′dmDProteolytic106.98 ± 0.290.640.30 ± 0.110.360.56Acto-S1:2′dmDProteolytic207.97 ± 0.400.430.28 ± 0.100.571.32Acto-S1:2′dmDRecombinant107.6 ± 0.300.830.67 ± 0.200.170.20Acto-S1:2′dmDRecombinant207.8 ± 0.300.610.72 ± 0.200.390.61Dictyostelium S1:2′dmDRecombinant208.31 ± 0.40The conditions were 20 mm KCl, 25 mm Hepes, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, pH 7.5.

Cheung H.C. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 4317-4322Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The two fractional intensities provide a measure of the mole fractions of the two components. Thus, the ratio off 2/f 1 is an equilibrium constant describing the equilibrium between these two S1:ADP states. We measured the fluorescence decay parameters of proteolytic S1:2′dmD as a function of temperature, and Fig. 1 shows a van't Hoff plot depicting ln(f 1/f 2)versus the reciprocal of temperature, in degrees Kelvin. The component with longer lifetime is favored at all temperatures. The data fit a two-state equilibrium with ΔH0 = 10.6 kcal/mol and ΔS0 = 29.3 cal/(degrees·mol). At 20 °C,f 2/f 1 0.045, and at 10 °C, f 2/f 1 = 0.011 (Table I). We have previously reported that the fluorescence decay of 2′dmD complexed with recombinant S1 likewise consists of two components, with lifetimes of 8.73 ± 0.2 ns and 1.8 ± 0.1 ns and fractional components of 0.70 and 0.30, respectively (30Sweeney H.L. Rosenfeld S.S. Brown F. Faust L. Smith J. Xing J. Stein L. Sellers J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6262-6270Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). This would correspond to f 2/f 1= 0.075 at 20 °C (Table I). Similar studies using recombinant S1 from Dictyosteliummyosin II, a fast myosin, also revealed two components. However, one of these had a lifetime of 3.82 ± 0.20 ns, identical to free nucleotide, and its fractional emission of 0.30 was nearly identical to the fraction of free nucleotide determined by equilibrium dialysis (0.27). The other, corresponding to bound nucleotide, had a lifetime of 8.31 ± 0.30 ns (Table I). We therefore conclude that the short lifetime component seen with smooth muscle myosin represents an additional myosin ADP state not seen in fast myosin II isoforms. We next repeated these measurements for a complex of 12.4 μm proteolytically prepared smooth muscle S1, 12.4 μm 2′dmD, and 25 μm phalloidin-stabilized actin. The lower concentration of S1 was used to reduce the turbidity of the acto-S1 mixture. Given the dissociation constant of S1:ADP for actin in the steady state (15Cremo C.R. Geeves M.A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 1969-1978Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar), essentially all of the S1 should remain bound. We measured the concentration of 2′dmD not bound to the acto-S1 complex by sedimenting the complex in an Airfuge and measuring the absorbance of the supernatant at 356 nm. This yielded an unbound nucleotide concentration of 6.8 μm, corresponding to an unbound fraction of 0.48 and a dissociation constant of 5.7 μm. The fluorescence decay of this complex at 20 °C could be described by three exponential terms with lifetimes of 7.97 ± 0.3, 3.97 ± 0.2, and 0.28 ± 0.1 ns and fractional intensities of 0.17, 0.60, and 0.23, respectively (Table I). The fractional intensity of 0.60 is similar to the fraction of unbound nucleotide, and the lifetime for this component is likewise very close to that for free nucleotide. Furthermore, the fluorescence decay of a mixture of 12 μm 2′dmD and 20 μmphalloidin-stabilized actin yielded a single lifetime of 3.87 ± 0.2 ns, and we therefore conclude that the component of the acto:S1 complex with lifetime of 3.97 ns is free nucleotide. The other two lifetime components, representing two acto:S1:2′dmD states, are related by an equilibrium constantf 2/f 1 = 1.32. Repeating this experiment at 10 °C again produced three components, with lifetimes of 6.98 ± 0.3, 4.23 ± 0.2, and 0.30 ± 0.1 ns and fractional intensities of 0.25, 0.61, and 0.14 (Table I). This corresponds to an equilibrium constant of 0.56 between the two acto:S1:2′dmD states. These results thus demonstrate that actin binding shifts the equilibrium distribution of the two S1:ADP states toward the shorter lifetime component by a factor of 30–50. Repeating these experiments with a complex of 6.0 μmrecombinant smooth S1 + 6.0 μm 2′dmD, and 40.0 μm phalloidin-stabilized actin also revealed the presence of three components in the fluorescence decay. At 20 °C, the lifetimes were 7.82 ± 0.3, 3.70 ± 0.2, and 0.72 ± 0.2 ns with fractional intensities of 0.23, 0.63, and 0.14, respectively. The corresponding lifetimes and fractional intensities at 10 °C were 7.58 ± 0.3, 3.99 ± 0.2, and 0.67 ± 0.2 ns and 0.25, 0.70, and 0.05. The component with lifetime of 3.70 ± 0.2 ns, with unbound fraction at 20 °C of 0.63, is considered free nucleotide, since its fractional intensity is in good agreement with direct measurements of unbound nucleotide that were obtained by sedimenting the complex in an Airfuge. This revealed a free nucleotide concentration of 4.1 μm, corresponding to an unbound fraction of 0.68 and dissociation constant of 8.3 μm. Measurement of actin-bound S1:ADP was performed with a sedimentation assay using 3H-labeled S1, as described (8Rosenfeld S.S. Taylor E.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 11908-11919Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and revealed an unbound fraction of <0.07. Thus, lifetime studies of recombinant S1:2′dmD:actin also reveal evidence of two states that are related by an equilibrium constant of 0.20 at 10 °C and 0.61 at 20 °C (TableI). These results demonstrate the presence of two S1:ADP and two acto-S1:ADP states in smooth muscle, as defined by a probe in the nucleotide-binding site. In order to determine how these states relate to actin binding affinity, we next performed a series of transient state kinetic measurements with pyrene-labeled actin. The formation of a strongly bound actomyosin state can be monitored by using a pyrenyl probe on actin, since strong binding of S1 to actin quenches the pyrene fluorescence (32Taylor E.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 294-302Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Several investigators have utilized this to demonstrate that binding of ADP to acto:S1 has no effect on the pyrene fluorescence for both smooth muscle myosin II and brush border myosin I (14Jontes J.D. Milligan R.A. Pollard T.D. Ostap E.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 14332-14337Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 15Cremo C.R. Geeves M.A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 1969-1978Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). We found similar results with recombinant S1 bound to phalloidin-stabilized pyrene-labeled actin (data not shown), and we conclude from this that the two acto:S1:ADP states detected from fluorescence lifetime studies are both in a strong actin-binding conformation. It does not automatically follow, however, that the predominant S1:ADP state detected from lifetime studies retains this strong binding conformation. This is supported by the results depicted in Fig. 2. In this experiment, a 10-fold molar excess of pyrene-labeled actin was mixed with recombinant S1 + 2 mm ADP at 20 °C in the stopped flow. The quenching of the pyrenyl probe followed a single exponential process following a lag phase (Fig. 2, inset), as has been described with skeletal S1 (32Taylor E.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 294-302Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The rate of the quenching varied hyperbolically with actin concentration, with an initial slope defining an apparent second order rate constant of 3.4 μm−1s−1. Fitting to a hyperbolic dependence on actin concentration yielded an apparent binding constant of 2.4 μm and a maximum rate of 6.9 s−1(Fig. 2). The kinetics of this reaction are consistent with the following Reaction 1, originally described for skeletal muscle S1 (32Taylor E.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 294-302Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), M·D+A*↔M·D·A*↔M·D·AREACTION 1 where A* is pyrene actin with unquenched fluorescence; A is quenched pyrene actin; D is ADP; and M is myosin. This implies that, as in the case of skeletal muscle S1, the initial M·D complex is in a weak actin binding conformation. Formation of the M·D·A* complex, associated with the lag phase, is then followed by an isomerization to strong binding complex (M·D·A) whose fluorescence is quenched. We next examined the kinetics of ADP dissociation from acto:S1 by mixing pyrene actin + recombinant S1 + ADP in the stopped flow with 4 mm ATP. At 20 °C, the resulting fluorescence enhancement occurred as a single exponential process whose rate constant showed a small concentration dependence, and over an ADP concentration range of 20–200 μm was between 61 and 77 s−1 (data not shown). Repeating the experiment at 10 °C produced a fluorescence transient that was best fit by two exponential terms. The ratio of the amplitudes of these two phases remained constant at 0.20–0.25 in favor of the slower phase, over an ADP concentration range of 30– 300 μm. The rate constant of the faster process demonstrated an inverse relationship with [ADP], whereas that for the second phase showed little dependence on [ADP] and was in the range of 6–10 s−1 (Fig.3 A). The dependence of the rate of the faster phase on [ADP] could be described by Equation2:λobs=KATP·kd·[ATP]1+KATP·[ATP]+[ADP]KADPEquation 2 where λobs is the observed rate constant;K ATP is the apparent binding constant of ATP to the acto-S1 complex; k d is the rate constant of acto-S1 dissociation produced by mixing with ATP at concentration [ATP]; and K ADP is the dissociation constant for ADP binding to the acto-S1 complex. These values are summarized in Table II. A similar result had been reported for brush border myosin I at room temperature (14Jontes J.D. Milligan R.A. Pollard T.D. Ostap E.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 14332-14337Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar).Table IIKinetic parameters for the release of ADP from recombinant S1:pyrene actin and Δ25/50 S1:pyrene actinReactionTK ATPk dK ADP°Cm−1s−1μmΔ25/50 S1:actin2-aActin, pyrene-labeled actin. + ADP × ATP2021631891.8S1:actin2-aActin, pyrene-labeled actin. + ADP × ATP1011862276.12-a Actin, pyrene-labeled actin. Open table in a new tab We had previously reported that loop 1, a surface-exposed segment of random coil bridging the catalytic site and connecting the 25- and 50-kDa domains, modulates the rate of ADP release and that its deletion reduced the rate of ADP release by nearly 10-fold (30Sweeney H.L.

We repeated the above experiments with a mutant of smooth muscle S1 in which this loop had been deleted (Δ25/50 S1), and we found that at 20 °C, it produced a biphasic fluorescence transient with roughly equal amplitudes. Furthermore, the rates for the two phases demonstrated an ADP concentration dependence very similar to wild type S1 at 10 °C (Fig. 3 B). The rate of the faster phase of the transient for Δ25/50 S1 could likewise be fit to Equation 2, and results are summarized in Table II. A double exponential decay would be expected if release of ADP occurs subsequent to an isomerization reaction, as has been described for brush border myosin I (14Jontes J.D. Milligan R.A. Pollard T.D. Ostap E.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 14332-14337Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). For smooth muscle S1, this isomerization can be detected by either reducing the temperature or by eliminating loop 1, both of which appear to slow this isomerization. The"

Here we have identified by differential display a novel oncogenic Ras target, mob-5, encoding a 23-kDa cytokine-like secreted protein. Mob-5 expression could be induced by oncogenic Ha-ras and Ki-ras, but not by normal ras activation. Inhibitors of both Ha-Ras and mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase completely abolished the mob-5 expression in ras transformed cells, with concomitant loss of the transformation phenotype. Using an alkaline phosphatase-tagged Mob-5 as ligand, a putative Mob-5 receptor was identified on the cell surface of oncogenic ras transformed cells. Thus, the Mob-5/Mob-5 receptor may represent a novel putative autocrine loop coordinately activated by rasoncogenes.

Inhibitors of both Ha-Ras and mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase completely abolished the mob-5 expression in ras transformed cells, with concomitant loss of the transformation phenotype. Using an alkaline phosphatase-tagged Mob-5 as ligand, a putative Mob-5 receptor was identified on the cell surface of oncogenic ras transformed cells. Thus, the Mob-5/Mob-5 receptor may represent a novel putative autocrine loop coordinately activated by rasoncogenes. farnesyltransferase inhibitor mitogen-activated protein rat intestinal epithelial polymerase chain reaction base pairs isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside alkaline phosphatase interleukin 10 Ras proteins are among the most important molecular switch molecules that relay mitogenic or differentiation signals from the cell surface to the nucleus where selective gene expression takes place. Oncogenic mutations lock the Ras proteins into a permanent “on” position, leading to unregulated cell proliferation, which is the hallmark of cancer (1Barbacid M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1987; 56: 779-827Crossref PubMed Scopus (3778) Google Scholar, 2Lowy D.R. Willumsen B.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1993; 62: 851-891Crossref PubMed Scopus (1124) Google Scholar). Mutations in ras oncogenes have been detected in over 90% of pancreatic cancers and 50% of colorectal cancer (3Kiaris H. Spandidos D.A. Int. J. Oncol. 1995; 7: 413-421PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast to the extensive body of knowledge related to the genetics of ras activation (4Boguski M.S. McCormick F. Nature. 1993; 366: 643-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (1761) Google Scholar), relatively little is known of the transcriptional events triggered by Ras. Of a fewras target genes previously identified, including transin/stromelysin-1 (5Matrisian L.M. Glaichenhaus N. Gesnel M-C. Breathnach R. EMBO J. 1985; 4: 1435-1440Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar), glucose transporter (6Flier J. Mueckler M.M. Usher P. Lodish H.F.

Samuels M.L. Pritchard C.A. Abraham J.A. McMahon M. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1953-1964Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar), and mob-1/IP10 (10Liang P. Averboukh L. Zhu W. Pardee A.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12515-12519Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar,11Zhang R. Zhang H. Zhu W. Coffey R. Pardee A.B. Liang P. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 1607-1610Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), nearly all were shown to be inducible in normal cells by serum growth factors, likely through the activation of endogenousras (12Dobrowolski S. Harter M. Stacey D.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5441-5449Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 13Durkin J.P. Whitfield J.F. Mol. Cell.

One long standing puzzle surroundingras has been that although the effects of Ras activation are very similar to those of serum growth factors,ras-transformed cells may be oncogenic, whereas the parental cells continuously exposed to serum growth factors are not. To search for additional ras target genes, especially those that may be oncogenic ras-specific, optimized differential display technology (15Liang P. Pardee A.B. Science. 1992; 257: 967-971Crossref PubMed Scopus (4700) Google Scholar, 16Liang P. Zhu W. Zhang X. Guo Z. O'Connell R. Averboukh L. Wang F. Pardee A.B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 5763-5764Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar) was employed to systematically search for such genes in comparative studies involving two carefully chosen paradigms. Since the development of the method, it has been realized that differential display, like other competitive methods such as DNA microarray, is mechanism-based, rather than function-based gene screening tool (17Liang P. Methods. 1998; 16: 361-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Therefore, much effort should be made to establish the comparative systems based on as direct and simple a mechanism as possible to identify the relevant genes. To this end, alteration in gene expression in Rat-1 embryo fibroblasts upon conditional expression of oncogenic Ha-ras was analyzed to identify the early ras inducible genes. In the other complementary screening, changes in gene expression was followed in the oncogenic Ha-ras transformed Rat-1 cells upon the treatment with inhibitors of either Ras farnesyltransferase (FTI)1 (18Kohl N.E. Mosser S.D. deSolms S.J. Giuliani E.A. Pompiano D.L. Graham S.L. Smith R.L. Scolnick E.M. Oliff A. Gibbs J.B. Science. 1993; 260: 1934-1937Crossref PubMed Scopus (619) Google Scholar) or MAP kinase kinase (19Pang L. Sawada T. Decker S.J. Saltiel A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13585-13588Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (896) Google Scholar), which is one of the major Ras downstream kinases required for cell transformation. Here we describe the identification and biochemical characterization of mob-5, the only oncogenicras-specific gene identified in both paradigms. We demonstrate that mob-5 encodes a cytokine-like secreted protein, which binds specifically to its putative cell surface receptor (Mob-5R) expressed by the ras-transformed cells, but not by their normal parental controls. We propose that the coordinate activation of this novel ligand/receptor loop may play an important role inras oncogene-mediated neoplasia. All cell lines including Rat1, Rat1(ras), Rat-1:iRas (10Liang P. Averboukh L. Zhu W. Pardee A.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Biol. 1998; 18: 6131-6141Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar), rat intestinal epithelial (RIE), RIE(Ha-ras), and RIE(Ki-ras) (Ko, 1995) were routinely grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) with 10% bovine calf serum (HyClone, Logan, UT) and 1% penicillin-streptomycin (Life Technologies, Inc.) at 37 °C with 10% CO2. 293T cells and their derivatives were maintained under the same condition as above except 10% fetal bovine serum (HyClone, Logan, UT) was used in place of 10% bovine calf serum. Serum starvation and restimulation of the Rat-1 cells in the absence and presence of cyclohexamide (Sigma) was carried out essentially as described previously (11Zhang R. Zhang H. Zhu W. Coffey R. Pardee A.B. Liang P. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 1607-1610Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Total RNA from cells were purified using the RNApure reagent following the manufacture's instruction (GenHunter Corp., Nashville, TN). DNase I treatment of RNA prior to differential display was carried out using the MessageClean kit (GenHunter Corp., Nashville, TN). Differential display PCR reactions were setup in 96-well PCR plates (Perkin-Elmer) by the Beckman Biomek 2000 automated liquid dispensing workstation using one-base anchored oligo(dT) primers and rationally designed arbitrary 13-mers (16Liang P. Zhu W. Zhang X. Guo Z. O'Connell R. Averboukh L. Wang F. Pardee A.B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 5763-5764Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar) from the RNAimage kits (GenHunter Corp., Nashville, TN). The cDNAs were amplified in the presence of [α-33P]dATP (NEN Life Science Products) using Taq DNA polymerase (Qiagene) and separated on 6% denaturing polyacrylamide gels (National Diagnostic, Atlanta, GA). Total RNA was isolated from Ha-Ras-transformed rat embryo fibroblasts as described (16Liang P. Zhu W. Zhang X. Guo Z. O'Connell R. Averboukh L. Wang F. Pardee A.B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 5763-5764Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar) and then further purified by poly(A) selection using a poly(A)Tract mRNA isolation system (Promega, Madison, WI). The lambda ZAP II Vector/Gigapack cloning kit was used to construct the cDNA library following the instructions provided by the manufacturer. 500,000 plaques were screened for full-length mob-5 cDNA using α 32P-labeled 394-bp mob-5 cDNA probe from differential display. Positive plaques were excised as phagemids and sequenced by the molecular biology core facility of the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA. The entire mda-7 coding region was amplified from RNA isolated from human colon cancer tissues by reverse transcriptase-PCR based on the published sequence (24Jiang H. Lin J.J. Su Z. Goldstein N.I. Fisher P.B. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 2477-2486PubMed Google Scholar). The cDNA synthesis was carried out in a total volume of 20 μl containing 1 μg of DNA-free total RNA, 50 mm Tris-Cl (pH 8.0), 100 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 20 μm dNTP, 1 μm oligo(dT)20 primer (GenHunter), and 200 units of Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (GenHunter) at 37 °C for 1 h. After 5 min at 75 °C to inactivate the Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase, 1/10 of the reverse transcriptase reaction was used as template for PCR amplification of mda-7 using 0.2 μm of each LMda-7 primer (5′-AAGATCTGAGGCTGCTT-3′) and RMda-7 primer (5′-CCAGATCTAGACATTCAGAGCTTGTAG-3′). The PCR was carried out in 40 μl containing 4 μl of 10× PCR buffer, 1.6 μl of 1.25 mmdNTP, and 0.4 μl of Taq polymerase (Qiagen). After an initial denaturation period of 3 min at 94 °C, 30 cycles consisting of 15 s at 94 °C, 40 s at 56 °C, and 2 min at 72 °C followed. After the final 5-min extension at 72 °C, the reverse transcriptase-PCR products were analyzed on a 1.5% agarose gel. The amplified mda-7 cDNA was cloned into the PCR-TRAP vector (GenHunter) and completely sequenced. A 507-bpBamHI-HindIII fragment, containing the rat Mob-5 coding region without its N-terminal 23 signal peptides was generated by PCR using the cloned Mob-5 cDNA as a template. The primers used were Lhis (5′-CCAGAGCTTCAGGGTC-3′) and Rhis (5′-AAGCTTTCCGGATTGGCAAT-3′). The PCR product was first subcloned into the PCR-TRAP vector (GenHunter, Nashville, TN) and theBamHI-HindIII insert was then excised, purified, and ligated into corresponding sites of the 6X-His tag expression vector pQE32 (Qiagen, Chatsworth, CA). For the expression of recombinant Mda-7–6XHis-tagged protein, the coding region of Mda-7 excluding the putative signal peptide sequence (codon 1–44) was amplified by PCR using primers Lhis-hMob5 (5′-GGATCCABBTATCAGGGG-3′) and Rhis-hMob5 (5′-AAGCTTGTAGAATTTCTGCATC-3′). The PCR product was cloned into the PCR-TRAP cloning vector and then excised as aBamHI-HindIII fragment before ligating into the corresponding sites of pQE32. The recombinant plasmids were transformed into Escherichia coli TG1 cells to produce N-terminal 6X-His tagged Mob-5 and Mda-7. Upon induction with 2 mm IPTG (Life Technology, Inc.), the recombinant His-tagged Mob-5 and Mda-7 were overproduced as insoluble proteins in the bacteria and purified on a nickel-Sepharose column under denaturing conditions according to the manufacturer's protocol (Qiagen). The purified proteins were dialyzed in PBS to remove the denaturant and then injected into New Zealand White rabbits to produce polyclonal antibodies (HRP Inc., Denver, PA). A 680-bp BspHI-BglII restriction fragment containing the entire coding region of mob-5 was generated by PCR using the cloned mob-5 cDNA as a template. The targeting construct was subsequently inserted between the NcoI and BamI sites of retroviral vector pMFG-S (36Danos O. Mulligan R.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 6460-6464Crossref PubMed Scopus (805) Google Scholar, 37Dranoff G. Jaffee E. Lazenby A. Golumbek P. Levitsky H. Brose K. Jackson V. Hamada H. Pardoll D. Mulligan R.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 3539-3543Crossref PubMed Scopus (2658) Google Scholar) and sequenced to ensure the sequence accuracy. Both the entire Mob-5 and Mda-7 coding regions including their signal peptides were amplified by PCR and subsequently inserted into the BglII site of APtag2 cloning vector (26, GenHunter Corp., Nashville TN) to allow the C-terminal fusion of the AP. All constructs were sequenced to ensure sequence accuracy. The recombinant plasmids and APtag4, which express the secreted AP alone (26Flanagan J.G. Leder P. Cell. 1990; 63: 185-194Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (633) Google Scholar), were stably transfected into 293T cells. The expression of the fusion proteins, AP activity assay, and receptor binding were essentially as described before (26Flanagan J.G. Leder P. Cell. 1990; 63: 185-194Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (633) Google Scholar). Specifically, for receptor binding assays, the cells were seeded at 5 × 105/well in 6-well plates in duplicates. After cells reach confluence, receptor binding assay was carried out with 1 ml of either the AP fusion protein containing medium or AP alone containing medium (all were 0.7 unit/ml) produced by the 293T cells. Recombinant plasmids were transfected into target cells by the standard calcium phosphate precipitation method. For retroviral packaging, pMFG-S-Mob-5 was cotransfected with pCMV-Neo vector at a rate of 10:1 (10 μg of pcmv-mob-5, 1 μg of pCMV-Neo) into the CRIP packaging cells to produce G418 (1 mg/ml)-resistant stable cell lines. Retroviral infection was carried out essentially as described previously (35Zhang R. Averboukh L. Zhu W. Zhang H. Jo H. Dempsey P.J. Coffey R., A. Pardee A.B. Liang P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6131-6141Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). For protein expression of Mob-5-AP, Mda-7-AP, and AP alone, the corresponding plasmids were co-transfected into the 293T cells, with a puromycin resistant vector, pBabe-puro, at a ratio of 10:1, and stable clones were selected by 10 μg/ml puromycin. Aliquots of 30 μl of each cell culture medium were separated by electrophoresis on a sodium dodecyl sulfate-12% polyacrylamide gel (National Diagnostics, Atlanta, GA) and blotted onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore, Bedford, MA). For immunblotting, a 1:2000 dilution of either Mob-5-, Mda-7- or AP-specific antibodies (GenHunter Corp., Nashville, TN) was used. The secondary antibody was anti-rabbit IgG conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Western blot for Ras was carried out using anti-Ras antibody (Oncogene Science) and 50 μg/lane of total cellular protein extracted from Rat-1:iRas cells before and after IPTG treatment. Reactive proteins were visualized with an ECL kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) following the manufacturer's protocol. Using automated differential display screening with rational primer designs (16Liang P. Zhu W. Zhang X. Guo Z. O'Connell R. Averboukh L. Wang F. Pardee A.B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 5763-5764Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar), two paradigms, one with Rat-1:iRas cells containing IPTG inducible oncogenic Ha-ras (9McCarthy S.A. Samuels M.L. Pritchard C.A. Abraham J.A. McMahon M. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1953-1964Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 11Zhang R. Zhang H. Zhu W. Coffey R. Pardee A.B. Liang P. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 1607-1610Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) and the other with oncogenic Ha-ras transformed Rat-1 cells before and after treatment of a MAP kinase kinase inhibitor PD98059 (19Pang L. Sawada T. Decker S.J. Saltiel A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13585-13588Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (896) Google Scholar), were set up for the systematic screening of oncogenic ras target genes. After screening through 90 combinations of primers representing 70% coverage of the genes expressed in a cell (20Liang P. Bauer D. Averboukh L. Warthoe P. Rohrwild M. Muller H. Strauss M. Pardee A.B. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 254: 304-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar), a total of 14ras inducible genes and 7 ras repressible genes were identified (21Jo H. Zhang H. Zhang R. Liang P. Methods. 1998; 16: 365-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). 2P. Liang, unpublished results.Four of these ras inducible genes, transin/stromelysin-1 (5Matrisian L.M. Glaichenhaus N.

Shuman M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 8375-8383Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), were also identified by other methods in previous studies as ras targets. One of the 14 ras inducible genes, designated mob-5, appeared to be novel, and the gene was identified in both screenings using either an inducible ras oncogene or inhibitor, which blocksras signaling (Fig. 1,A and B). The 394-bp mob-5 cDNA was reamplified from the differential display gels, cloned, and used as a probe to successfully verify the Ha-ras induction of the gene (Fig. 2 A). Mob-1, a knownras target gene, previously (10Liang P. Averboukh L. Zhu W. Pardee A.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12515-12519Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 11Zhang R. Zhang H. Zhu W. Coffey R. Pardee A.B. Liang P. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 1607-1610Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) was used as a control for ras induction. The IPTG treatment of Rat-1:iRas led to the appearance of the oncogenic Ha-Ras protein 4 h post IPTG induction, with concomitant rapid induction of mob-5 mRNA. This result suggests that mob-5 is an early target gene of oncogenic Ha-ras.Figure 2Northern blot confirmation of mob-5 as an oncogenic Ha-ras-specific target gene. A, total RNA from Rat-1:iRas cells before and after IPTG induction of Ha-ras were analyzed by Northern blot using mob-5 cDNA as a probe. Another ras target gene, mob-1, was also analyzed as a positive control. The induction of oncogenic Ha-Ras protein was confirmed by Western blot as indicated from the same cells. Note the induction of mutant Ha-Ras and mob-5 at 4 h after IPTG addition. B, mob-5 expression cannot be activated by serum growth factors. Normal Rat-1 cells were starved for serum (0.5% BCS) for 48 h and then stimulated with 10% bovine calf serum in the absence or presence of protein synthesis inhibitor, cyclohexamide, as indicated. Total cellular RNAs were analyzed by Northern blot using the same 32P-labeled cDNA probes as used in Fig. 2 A. Note the superinduction of mob-1, but not mob-5, by serum and protein synthesis inhibitor, cyclohexamide (CHX). C, inhibition of mob-5 expression in Ha-ras-transformed cells by FTI. Exponentially growing Rat-1(ras) cells were treated with 5 μm of FTI 739,749 for the period indicated, and the total cellular RNA was analyzed by Northern blot using mob-5 cDNA as a probe. Ribosomal RNA was shown as a control for loading.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Previous studies showed that ras is required for the immediate early response to external growth factor stimulation and normal cell proliferation (12Dobrowolski S. Harter M. Stacey D.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5441-5449Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 13Durkin J.P. Whitfield J.F. Mol. Cell.

Although mob-5 expression was not detected in nontransformed Rat-1 cells in continuous culture, one would predict that it could be expressed in response to serum stimulation if the gene is a downstream target of the Ras signaling pathway. Consistent with this prediction were findings that almost all of the previously identified ras target genes including mob-1 (16Liang P. Zhu W. Zhang X. Guo Z. O'Connell R. Averboukh L. Wang F. Pardee A.B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 5763-5764Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar), heparin-binding epidermal growth factor (9McCarthy S.A. Samuels M.L. Pritchard C.A. Abraham J.A. McMahon M. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1953-1964Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar), Transin (5Matrisian L.M. Glaichenhaus N. Gesnel M-C. Breathnach R. EMBO J. 1985; 4: 1435-1440Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar), osteopontin (22Craig A. Nemir M. Mukherjee B.B. Chambers A.F. Denhardt D.T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1988; 157: 166-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), and glucose transporter (6Flier J. Mueckler M.M. Usher P. Lodish H.F. Science. 1987; 235: 1492-1495Crossref PubMed Scopus (688) Google Scholar) could be induced by serum growth factors. To test the serum inducibility of the mob-5 expression, Rat-1 cells were starved for serum and then restimulated with 10% fetal calf serum. Unlike mob-1, mob-5 expression was not detected following serum stimulation, either in the presence or absence of protein synthesis inhibitor (Fig. 2 B). In addition, Northern blot analysis failed to detect any mob-5 expression in normal tissues from adult rats, which included brain, heart, lung, kidney, stomach, pancreas, spleen, intestine, skin, skeletal muscle, and blood (data not shown). The tetrapeptide FTI has been shown to be able to inhibit Ha-ras-mediated cell transformation of rat embryo fibroblasts (18Kohl N.E. Mosser S.D. deSolms S.J. Giuliani E.A. Pompiano D.L. Graham S.L. Smith R.L. Scolnick E.M. Oliff A. Gibbs J.B. Science. 1993; 260: 1934-1937Crossref PubMed Scopus (619) Google Scholar). FTIs inhibit the farnesylation of Ras protein, thereby preventing its membrane localization and biological function. If mob-5 is indeed a target gene of ras, one would predict that FTIs would down-regulate mob-5 expression in oncogenic Ha-ras-transformed cells. To test this, exponentially growing Rat-1(ras) cells were treated with 5 μm of FTI, and the mob-5 mRNA expression and cellular morphology were monitored following the drug addition. As predicted, mob-5 mRNA expression was essentially abolished in 24 h (Fig. 2 C), when the cells began to lose the transformed cellular morphology (data not shown). Using the 394-bp cDNA probe obtained by differential display, the full-length mob-5 cDNA was isolated from a cDNA library of Ha-ras-transformed rat embryo fibroblasts (10Liang P. Averboukh L. Zhu W. Pardee A.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12515-12519Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The 1.2-kilobase mob-5 cDNA encodes an open reading frame of 183 amino acids with an in-frame stop codon 27 bases upstream of the putative translation initiation codon (Fig. 3 A). As predicted, the 394-bp mob-5 cDNA sequence identified by differential display lies at the 3′-end of the mob-5 full-length cDNA. The predicted Mob-5 protein exhibits 68% sequence identity to Mda-7, a gene isolated as a differentiation associated gene from human melanoma cells treated with interferon-β and Mezerein (24 and Fig.3 B). The only other gene that showed a significant degree of homology (23% identity) to Mob-5 over most of the coding regions is interleukin 10 (IL-10) from both viral or cellular origins, which is a potent anti-inflammatory cytokine (Fig.3 C and 31). The Mob-5 protein sequence contains a typical signal peptide sequence at its N terminus, suggesting that Mob-5 may be a secreted protein, although previous study failed to demonstrate so for Mda-7 (24Jiang H. Lin J.J. Su Z. Goldstein N.I. Fisher P.B. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 2477-2486PubMed Google Scholar). Overexpression of the full-length mob-5 cDNA with retroviral vector in a variety of rodent fibroblasts, including Rat-1 cells, led to a high level secretion of Mob-5 protein with a predicted molecular mass of 23 kDa. The Mob-5 protein secreted into the culture medium could be readily detected by Western blot using polyclonal antibody directed against the recombinant Mob-5 (Fig.4 A). However, overexpression of Mob-5 alone in Rat-1 cells did not lead to any detectable phenotypic changes, such as morphological transformation. To determine whether the secreted Mob-5 is a signaling molecule or a cytokine (like IL-10), it is important to know if its specific receptor(s) exist. To this end, APtag technology (26Flanagan J.G. Leder P. Cell. 1990; 63: 185-194Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (633) Google Scholar) was employed to create a Mob-5-AP fusion protein, which can then be used as an affinity agent for the receptor analysis. This strategy has been successfully used to identify and clone a number of important cell surface receptors, including those of leptin (27Tartaglia L.A. Dembski M. Weng X. Deng N. Culpepper J. Dvos R. Richards G.J. Campfield L.A. Clark F.T. Deeds J. Muir C. Sanker S. Moriarty A. Moore K.J. Smutko J.S. Mays G.G. Woolf E.A. Monroe C.A. Tepper R.I. Cell. 1995; 83: 1263-1271Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3231) Google Scholar) and semaphorin III (28He Z. Tessier-Lavigne M. Cell. 1997; 90: 739-751Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (970) Google Scholar). Like Mob-5 itself, Mob-5-AP was secreted at a high level from 293T cells stably transfected with the recombinant plasmid. The secreted 90-kDa Mob-5-AP can be readily detected from the culture medium by either the alkaline phosphatase assay or direct Western blot analysis using anti-Mob-5 antibody (Fig. 4 A). The construct of the Mob-5-AP fusion protein was also verified by Western blot using antibody to the 67-kDa human placental secreted AP (Fig. 4 A, right panel). For the Mob-5 receptor study, Rat-1 cells before and after transformation by oncogenic Ha-ras were incubated with the cell culture medium containing an equal amount of either the Mob-5-AP fusion protein or secreted AP itself. Unlike the AP alone control, Mob-5-AP was found to be preferentially bound to the cell surface of the Ha-ras-transformed cells but not of the parental Rat-1 control (Fig. 4 B). Because Ki-ras mutations have been tightly linked with cancers of gastric intestinal origins (3Kiaris H. Spandidos D.A. Int. J. Oncol. 1995; 7: 413-421PubMed Google Scholar), RIE cells were analyzed for the expression of mob-5. Northern blot analysis was conducted with RIE cells before and after transformation by oncogenic Ha-ras and Ki-ras (29Ko T.C. Sheng H.M. Reisman D. Thompson E.A. Beauchamp R.D. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 177-184PubMed Google Scholar). Consistent with the results obtained with fibroblasts, both oncogenic Ha-rasand Ki-ras were shown to be able to activate mob-5 expression in RIE cells (Fig.5 A). With a high degree of homology to Mda-7, Mob-5 may be the rat homolog of Mda-7. Supporting this hypothesis, mda-7 was found to be overexpressed in nearly all human colon cancer specimens analyzed.2 However, without any functional data on either protein, one cannot rule out that Mob-5 and Mda-7 are instead closely related members of a same gene family. Based on the published cDNA sequence of mda-7, the entire coding region of the gene was amplified from human colon cancer tissues by reverse transcriptase-PCR. DNA sequence analysis of the resulting mda-7 clone revealed a single amino acid (Ser) insertion between the codon 14 and 15 of the published Mda-7 sequence (24Jiang H. Lin J.J. Su Z. Goldstein N.I. Fisher P.B. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 2477-2486PubMed Google Scholar). The Mda-7-AP fusion protein was constructed and expressed in 293T cells. Unlike previous studies on Mda-7, here the Mda-7-AP directed by the signal peptide of Mda-7 was found to be secreted at a high level into the culture medium. The secreted Mda-7-AP could be readily detected by both AP activity assay (range from 0.7 to 1.7 unit/ml) and direct Western blot analysis using polyclonal antibody against Mda-7 (Fig. 5 B, left panel). Further confirmation of the 90-kDa Mda-7-AP fusion protein was obtained by Western blot using antibody to AP itself (Fig. 5 B,right panel). As in Rat-1 cells, the putative Mob-5 receptor was also found to be differentially expressed between the normal and Ha-ras-transformed RIE cells using Mob-5-AP fusion protein as a ligand (Fig. 5 C, left panel).

A yeast two-hybrid screen of a fetal liver-hematopoietic cDNA library using PBX1a as bait led to the discovery of a novel non-homeodomain-containing protein that interacts with PBX1 as well as PBX2 and PBX3. RNA analysis revealed it to be expressed in CD34+ hematopoietic cell populations enriched in primitive progenitors, as is PBX1; search of the expressed sequence tag data base indicated that it is also expressed in other early embryonic as well as adult tissues. The full-length cDNA encodes a 731-amino acid protein that has no significant homology to known proteins. This protein that we have termed hematopoietic PBX-interacting protein (HPIP) is mainly localized in the cytosol and in small amounts in the nucleus. The region of PBX that interacts with HPIP includes both the homeodomain and immediate N-terminal flanking sequences. Strikingly, electrophoretic mobility shift assays revealed that HPIP inhibits the ability of PBX-HOX heterodimers to bind to target sequences. Moreover, HPIP strongly inhibits the transactivation activity of E2A-PBX. Together these findings suggest that HPIP is a new regulator of PBX function.

PBX1, a member of the PBX family along with PBX2 and PBX3 (4Monica K. Galili N. Nourse J. Saltman D. Cleary M.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 6149-6157Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar), was initially identified as the chromosome 1 participant of the t(1;19) translocation, which occurs in 25% of pediatric pre-B cell acute lymphocytic leukemia and that creates a chimeric gene designatedE2A-PBX1 (5Kamps M.P.

However, the structure of the protein, in which the majority of PBX1, including the homeodomain, is fused to the transcriptional activation domain of E2A (6Nourse J. Mellentin J.D. Galili N.

In vitro and in vivo data strongly suggest that PBX functions in combination with heterologous homeodomain proteins, including class I HOX proteins. As HOX cofactors, PBC proteins improve HOX specificity due to the increased size of the cooperative binding site and the strength of DNA binding, as well as by modulating recognition of cooperative binding sites by different groups of HOX proteins (12Mann R.S. Chan S.K. Trends Genet. 1996; 12: 258-262Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar, 13Shen W.F. Chang C.P. Rozenfeld S. Sauvageau G. Humphries R.K. Lu M. Lawrence H.J. Cleary M.L.

In addition, cooperative DNA binding with PBC proteins may act to change the regulatory signal of HOX proteins, from repressors to activators (15Pinsonneault J. Florence B. Vaessin H. McGinnis W. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2032-2042Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). HOX-PBC interaction optimally requires the PBC homeodomain and a short carboxyl-terminal region, called the HOX cooperativity motif (16Green N.C. Rambaldi I. Teakles J. Featherstone M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13273-13279Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 17Chang C.P. Brocchieri L. Shen W.F. Largman C. Cleary M.L. Mol. Cell.

Although PBC proteins contribute to HOX DNA binding specificity, PBC-HOX complexes exhibit little transcriptional activity and thus alone do not account for the precise functions that these complexes execute in vivo (18Krosl J.

The highly conserved amino-terminal domain of PBC proteins mediates protein dimerizion and DNA binding with members of the MEIS subfamily of homeodomain proteins (MEIS-HTH and PNOX1-PREP1) (19Knoepfler P.S.

Moreover, recent data have shown that PREP1, MEIS, and HTH proteins can bind to DNA together with PBC-HOX heterodimers to generate trimeric protein complexes and that PREP1-PBX-HOX complexes are more potent transcriptional activators than PBX-HOX heterodimers (24Jacobs Y.

Zappavigna V. Ferretti E. Mavilio F. Blasi F. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1434-1445Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar,27Shen W.F. Rozenfeld S. Kwong A. Kom ves L.G. Lawrence H.J. Largman C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 3051-3061Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar), suggesting that PREP1 as well as MEIS and HOX proteins from paralog groups 9 and 10 form stable PBX complexes in vivo. Indeed, DNA-independent complex formation with PREP1/MEIS/HTH can regulate the cellular localization of PBC proteins by masking the activity of a nuclear export signal, resulting in nuclear localization (28Berthelsen J. Kilstrup-Nielsen C. Blasi F. Mavilio F. Zappavigna V. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 946-953Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar, 29Abu-Shaar M. Ryoo H.D. Mann R.S. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 935-945Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). PBX proteins thus appear to function as part of large nucleoprotein complexes. The interactions within these complexes are probably decisive factors that allow the DNA binding proteins to discriminate among target regulatory elements. How these complexes are regulated during either early embryonic development or cellular differentiation of somatic cells to control gene expression is still unclear. We speculated that characterization of additional PBX-interacting proteins might shed light on the mechanism of PBX function, and specifically, we sought to identify novel cofactors or modifiers of PBX1 using the yeast two-hybrid system. We chose to focus on the hematopoietic system as a source of putative interacting factors due to the compelling evidence showing the importance of PBX as well as PBX partners in normal hematopoiesis and in leukemia (11Thorsteinsdottir U.

We report here the cloning and characterization of a novel PBX-interacting protein, hematopoietic PBX1-interacting protein (HPIP). We demonstrate that HPIP interacts with PBX1 in vivo and, moreover, that it prevents the binding of PBX1-HOX complexes to consensus DNA binding sites. We also show that HPIP inhibits the transactivation activity of E2A-PBX. HPIP appears to be the first nonhomeoprotein shown to interact directly with and regulate the transcriptional factor function of PBX1. We also show that HPIP is co-expressed with PBX1 in early hematopoietic cells, and therefore, it may contribute to the function of PBX1 during hematopoiesis and leukemic transformation. PBX1a (herein designated as PBX1) fragments were amplified from the Sp-PBX1a plasmid (kindly provided by M. Cleary, Stanford University). PCRs1were carried out using Platinium Taq DNA polymerase (Life Technologies, Inc.) as recommended by the manufacturer, and all DNA fragments generated were fully sequenced to rule out possible PCR-induced mutations. PBX and HPIP Expression Plasmids—cDNA fragments encoding the entire PBX1 coding sequence without the first Met (PBX1ΔMet) were amplified by PCR using specific primers and cloned into the yeast pGBT9 vector (CLONTECH), the bacterial pGX-5X-3X (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) vector, and the mammalian pSuperCatch vector (33Georgiev O. Bourquin J.P. Gstaiger M. Knoepfel L. Schaffner W. Hovens C. Gene ( Amst. ). 1996; 168: 165-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) to generate pGBT9-PBX, pGX-PBX, and pSC-FLAG-PBX, respectively. Different fragments of PBX1, as indicated in Fig.6, were amplified by PCR using the appropriate combination of primers and cloned into pAC2 to create pAC2-PBX deletion mutants. An expression cassette for PBX1 tagged on the amino teminus with an HA epitope was generated by cloning a PBX1ΔMet amplified by PCR in frame with an HA epitope isolated from pCFV 3HA and inserted into Bluescript KS+. The HA-PBX1 cDNA was then cloned into pSuperCatch (pSC-HA-PBX1). HPIP4 cDNA was cloned into pGBT9 to make pBT9 HPIP4. HPIP5 cDNA was cloned into pSuperCatch to make pSC-HPIP5. HPIP cDNA was isolated from BS-HPIP and cloned into pSuperCatch in frame with the FLAG epitope to make pSC-HPIP. FLAG-tagged HPIP encoding cDNA was isolated from pSC-HPIP and cloned into the HpaI site of the murine retroviral vector MSCVneoEB (Robert G. Hawley, Sunnybrook Research Institute, Toronto, Canada) (34Hawley R.G. Lieu F.H. Fong A.Z. Hawley T.S. Gene Ther. 1994; 1: 136-138PubMed Google Scholar) to make MSCVNeo-FLAG-HPIP. Virus-containing supernatants were collected from BOSC cells transfected with the retroviral vector using standard protocols. HPIP cDNA was isolated from pSC-HPIP and cloned into pEGF-C1 vector (CLONTECH Laboratories, Inc.) to make pEGFP HPIP. HPIP5 cDNA was cloned into pM (CLONTECH) to make pM HPIP5. Details of all constructs are available upon request. The bait plasmid, pGBT9-PBX1, was transfected into the HF7C strain and used to screen 106 independent pAC2 activator plasmid cDNAs from human week 14 fetal liver (CLONTECH). Colony selection, isolation of plasmid DNA from positive clones, and tests of specificity were performed essentially as described (35Abramovich C. Yakobson B. Chebath J. Revel M. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 260-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Positive pAC2 plasmid inserts were excised with BglII, cloned into theBamHI site of BS-KS, and sequenced. To obtain a full-length HPIP cDNA, 105 independent phages from a human bone marrow CD34+ cDNA library 2G. Sauvageau, P. Rosten, and R. K. Humphries, unpublished observations. were screened with32P-labeled HPIP5. Bacterially expressed GST-PBX protein was purified as described (35Abramovich C. Yakobson B. Chebath J. Revel M. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 260-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). pSC-PBX1 was transfected into COS cells, and 48–72 h later, FLAG-tagged PBX (FLAG-PBX) protein was extracted using high salt buffer (1% Triton, 50 mm Hepes, 500 mm NaCl, 1 μg/ml aprotenin, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 100 μg/ml leupeptin), diluted to a final concentration of 150 mm NaCl, incubated with anti-FLAG agarose-M2 beads (Kodak Scientific Imaging System) for 2 h at 4 °C and washed three times with isotonic buffer (high salt buffer with 150 mm NaCl) to give M2-PBX1 beads. As a control, proteins from nontransfected COS cells were extracted, incubated with beads, and washed as above (M2-COS beads). The HA-tagged HPIP5 (HA-HPIP5) protein was produced in vitro using the TNT Coupled Reticulocyte Lysate System (Promega). Pull-down assays were performed by incubating equal amounts of GST or GST-PBX1 immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose beads with HA-HPIP5 diluted in isotonic buffer. The mixtures were incubated for 3 h at 4 °C and washed three times with isotonic buffer, and bound proteins were eluted, separated by 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and subjected to Western blot analysis using monoclonal anti-HA antibodies (Babco) (36Abramovich C. Shulman L.M. Ratovitski E. Harroch S. Tovey M. Eid P. Revel M. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5871-5877Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). For pull-down assays with COS-produced FLAG-PBX1, equal amounts of anti FLAG-M2 beads (M2 beads), M2-PBX1 beads, or M2-COS beads were mixed with HA-HPIP5 protein and processed as above. For co-immunoprecipitation, 10 μg/10-cm plate of pSC-FLAG-HPIP5, pSC-HA-PBX1, or both plasmids together were transfected into COS cells by the DEAE-dextran method (37Sambrook J Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 16.41-16.46Google Scholar); proteins were extracted after 48 h with high salt buffer, diluted to 150 mm NaCl, and incubated with anti-FLAG M2 beads for 4 h. Bound proteins were washed, separated on SDS-PAGE, and subjected to Western blots with anti-FLAG M2 monoclonal antibodies (Kodak Scientific Imaging System) or polyclonal anti-HA antibodies (Babco). Bone marrow cells from human organ donor vertebrae were fractionated into CD34+and CD34− subpopulations using a monoclonal anti-CD34 antibody and fluorescence-activated cell sorting; total RNA was isolated and assayed by reverse transcription-PCR as described (38Sauvageau G. Lansdorp P.M. Eaves C.J. Hogge D.E. Dragowska W.H. Reid D.S. Largman C. Lawrence H.J. Humphries R.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12223-12227Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar). Amplified cDNAs were separated on a 1% agarose gel, transferred to ζ probe membrane (Bio-Rad), and probed with randomly primed radioactive DNA ([α-32P]ATP) fragments specific for each gene. For Northern blots, poly(A)+ RNA was isolated from total RNA (prepared using Trizol; Life Technologies, Inc.) using the Oligotex Direct mRNA kit (Qiagen). 2 μg of poly(A)+ RNA was subjected to formaldehyde/agarose gel electrophoresis, transferred to ζ probe membrane and probed. Rat-1 cells were infected with MSCVNeo-FLAG-HPIP virus, selected with 1.5 mg/ml of G418 for 7 days and plated on glass cover slides for 48 h. Fixed cells were permeabilized with 0.1% Triton in PBS and blocked with PBS 3% bovine serum albumin, and the FLAG-HPIP fusion protein was visualized by incubation with M2 anti-FLAG antibodies (1:500), washed, and incubated with anti-mouse IgG-horseradish peroxidase-conjugated second antibody (1:50). The cover slides were mounted for examination with a Zeiss Axiphot fluorescence microscope. NIH 3T3 cells were transfected with GFP-HPIP by electroporation. Twenty-four hours after transfection, the cells were replated on glass cover slides. Twenty-four hours later, the cells were fixed, stained with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole, mounted, and viewed. Nuclear and cytoplasmic extracts from Rat-1 cells expressing FLAG-HPIP were isolated following standard procedures (39Davis L. Kuehl M. Battey J. Lange A.A. Basic Methods in Molecular Biology. 2nd Ed. Elsevier Science, New York1994Google Scholar). Extracts were subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western analysis using the anti-FLAG M2 monoclonal antibody. EMSA was performed using complementary oligonucleotides containing consensus binding sites for either PBX-HOXB7, PBX1-HOXA9, or PBX1-HOXA10 as described previously (13Shen W.F. Chang C.P.

Kom ves L.G. Lawrence H.J. Largman C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 3051-3061Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). For transient transfection, 293 cells were split into 24-well plates and 24 h later were transfected (by calcium phosphate) with a mixture of 3 μg of plasmid in each of triplicate wells. For a typical triplicate, 1 μg of pGL3-PBX reporter plasmid (kindly provided by M. Kamps, University of California, San Diego), 0.2 μg of MSCVpac E2A-PBX1a (40Thorsteinsdottir U. Krosl J. Kroon E. Haman A. Hoang T. Sauvageau G. Mol. Cell Biol. 1999; 19: 6355-6366Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), and 1 μg of either pM, pM HPIP5, MSCVNeo FLAG HPIP, or MSCVNeo was used. The pM and MSCVNeo vectors were used in these experiments to balance the amount of input DNA in transfections. Cells were harvested 48 h after transfection, and luciferase activities were measured with the Luciferase Assay System (Promega). In an effort to identify proteins that interact with PBX1 in early stages of hematopoiesis, we used the full-length PBX1a cDNA as bait to screen a library of human fetal liver cDNAs prepared at 14 weeks gestation when the liver is an active site of hematopoiesis. A yeast two-hybrid screen of 106 primary transformants yielded seven potential positive clones that showed strong interaction with PBX1 fused to the Gal4 DNA binding domain (GBD) but not with two negative control fusion proteins, GBD-lamin and GBD-rev. Sequence analysis revealed that two of the clones contained independent, partial cDNA inserts derived from the same mRNA. We named the protein encoded by this mRNA HPIP (forhematopoietic PBX1-interactingprotein), and the proteins derived from the partial cDNA as HPIP4 and HPIP5, respectively, where HPIP5 cDNA has an additional 100 base pairs at the 5′-end (Fig. 3). The interaction between HPIP and PBX1 observed in yeast cells was further confirmed in vitro using HA-tagged HPIP5 and immobilized GST-PBX1 or FLAG-PBX1 proteins. Immobilized GST-PBX was incubated with HA-HPIP5, and bound protein was analyzed by Western blotting. As shown in Fig. 1 A, HA-HPIP5 (lane 1) associated with GST-PBX1 (lane 2) but not with GST alone (lane 3). Furthermore, as shown in Fig. 1 B, HA-HPIP5 (lane 1) interacted with anti-FLAG M2 beads that were incubated with extracts of COS cells expressing FLAG-PBX1 (lane 3) but not with M2 beads alone (lane 2) or M2 beads incubated with extracts of mock-transfected COS cells. In vivo interaction between HPIP and PBX1 in mammalian cells was demonstrated by co-immunoprecipitation of FLAG-HPIP5 and HA-tagged PBX1 expressed in COS cells (Fig. 1 C). HPIP expression in hematopoietic cells was confirmed by Northern blot analysis of erythroid K562 and myeloid HL60 cells, which revealed a 5-kilobase pair transcript in both cell lines (Fig.2). HPIP expression in primitive human hematopoietic cells was also demonstrated by reverse transcription-PCR analysis of RNA obtained from human bone marrow. Fig. 2 Bshows that HPIP is strongly expressed in the CD34+ fraction containing the hematopoietic progenitors and at lower levels in the CD34− mature cell population. The same pattern of expression was found for PBX1, indicating that HPIP and PBX1 are co-expressed in the same hematopoietic compartment. A search of the expressed sequence tag data base using HPIP5 cDNA sequence showed that several embryonic and adult human clones encode potential proteins essentially identical to portions of HPIP, including clones isolated from heart, adult and infant brain, cerebellum, synovial sarcoma, and Jurkat T-cells. Mouse expressed sequence tags with significant matches to HPIP were identified from 14-day postcoitum embryos, irradiated colon, heart, and 2-cell embryos, indicating that human HPIP has a mouse homolog gene. Using the partial HPIP5 cDNA as a probe, a 3.5-kilobase pair clone containing a 2,193-nucleotide potential open reading frame and a 1,200-nucleotide 3′-untranslated region was identified from a human bone marrow CD34+ cDNA library (GenBankTM accession number AF221521). The open reading frame would encode a protein of 731 amino acids (aa) with a predicted molecular mass of 80 kDa (Fig.3). Thus, HPIP4 and HPIP5 constitute the C-terminal 308 and 341 aa respectively (aa 424–731 and 391–731) (Fig.3). Nucleotide data base searches showed that the sequence of HPIP cDNA, from nucleotide 1799 to nucleotide 2210, has 83% identity to a cDNA cloned from human lymphocytes (human clone A9A2BRB7, GenBankTM accession no. U00952) (41Epplen C. Epplen J.T. Hum. Genet. 1994; 93: 35-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Protein data base searches indicated that HPIP encodes a novel protein with no significant homology to any proteins of known function. Analysis using the PSORT II algorithm predicted that HPIP has a coil-coil secondary structure between aa 234 and 392 (coil regions have been implicated in protein-protein interactions) and two putative nuclear localization signals at aa 131 and 462, with the later resembling bipartite nuclear localization sequences commonly found in nuclear transcription factors. HPIP has several putative phosphorylation sites (e.g. sites for CKII, GSK3, mitogen-activated protein kinase, protein kinase A, protein kinase C, protein kinase B, protein kinase G, CaMII, p34 cdc2 , and p70 s6k ) and a leucine-rich region that resembles nuclear export signals that bind to the CRM1 export receptor (42Fornerod M. Ohno M. Yoshida M. Mattaj I.W. Cell. 1997; 90: 1051-1060Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1739) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3). To assess the subcellular localization of HPIP, a GFP-HPIP fusion protein was expressed in NIH 3T3 cells. As shown in Fig.4, most GFP-HPIP-expressing cells showed strong staining in the cytoplasm and more diffuse nuclear staining. Occasional cells showed stronger nuclear staining (not shown). A similar pattern of HPIP localization was observed in RAT-1 cells expressing HPIP tagged with a FLAG epitope (Fig. 4). Together, these findings indicate that HPIP is expressed mainly in the cytosol and in small amounts in the nucleus. To determine the molecular weight of HPIP and to see whether there is a difference in the mass between the cytosolic and nuclear protein, Western blot analysis of nuclear and cytosolic cell extracts of RAT-1 cells expressing FLAG-HPIP was performed. A strong band of approximately 98 kDa was apparent in cytosolic extracts, and a fainter band of the same molecular weight was seen in nuclear extracts (Fig. 5).Figure 5Molecular mass of HPIP. Nuclear (lane 1) and cytosolic (lane 2) preparations of Rat-1 cells (5 × 106and 106 cells, respectively) stably expressing FLAG-HPIP were resolved on a 7.5% SDS-PAGE. FLAG-HPIP was detected by immunoblotting with anti FLAG M2 antibodies. Lane 3 is from a total cell extract of nontransfected Rat-1 cells.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To localize the regions within PBX1 that interact with HPIP, different regions of PBX1 in frame with an HA epitope and the Gal4 activation domain were cloned. The different PBX1 plasmids were co-transfected with HPIP4 cDNA cloned in frame with the Gal4 binding domain in the pGBT9 vector, and the interaction of HPIP4 with the different PBX1 deletions was scored according to the color of the colonies by β-galactosidase filter assay. A PBX1 deletion mutant containing the N terminus plus the homeodomain (PBX1-(2–290)) bound HPIP4 with the same efficiency as the wild type PBX1 (Fig. 6). Conversely, PBX1 mutants expressing either the homeodomain alone (PBX1230–290) or the homeodomain plus the C terminus (PBX1-(230–430)) did not detectably interact with HPIP4 in this assay. Interestingly, mutant PBX1-(2–230), containing the N terminus of the protein, showed very weak binding to HPIP4, and only the addition of the full homeodomain restored the strong interaction seen with the full-length PBX1. These results indicate that the sequence of PBX1 N terminus of the homeodomain is sufficient for interaction with HPIP4; however, the homeodomain is needed for strong interaction. The contributions of sequences N-terminal to the homeodomain were further mapped to sequences between aa 160 and the homeodomain (Fig.6). This region is highly conserved in the PBX family, and as shown in Fig. 6, both PBX2 and PBX3 were able to interact with HPIP4. One of the major biological roles of PBX proteins is the formation of DNA binding complexes with HOX protein partners (9Lu Q. Knoepfler P.S. Scheele J. Wright D.D. Kamps M.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3786-3795Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 12Mann R.S. Chan S.K. Trends Genet. 1996; 12: 258-262Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar,13Shen W.F.

Since PBX proteins do not exhibit strong DNA binding in the absence of HOX partners, to assess the possible biological significance of HPIP, we studied its effect on the ability of PBX protein to form cooperative DNA binding complexes with a series of HOX proteins. We first used EMSA to analyze the influence of full-length HPIP on the formation of a heterodimeric DNA binding complex between PBX1 and HOXB7 proteins. HPIP reduced complex formation by approximately 70% (Fig. 7, comparelane 2 with lane 3). However, since the reticulocyte lysate used to synthesize the various proteins produced a nonspecific gel shift band in the same location as the PBX-HOXB7 complex (lane 1), the EMSA analysis was repeated using a different oligonucleotide target on which PBX forms cooperative gel shift bands with HOXA9 and HOXA10 but for which the lysate nonspecific binding is greatly decreased (14Shen W.F. Rozenfeld S. Lawrence H.J. Largman C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8198-8206Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). In these experiments, the addition of HPIP decreased PBX-HOXA10 and PBX-HOXA9 complexes by 50 and 80%, respectively (Fig. 7, lane 3). We then investigated whether the inhibition of the DNA binding activity of PBX by HPIP, seen in the EMSA, would be reflected in the transcriptional activity of PBX. PBX, in contrast with E2A-PBX, is unable to activate transcription by itself (8LeBrun D.P. Cleary M.L. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 1641-1647PubMed Google Scholar, 10Van Dijk M.A. Voorhoeve P.M. Murre C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6061-6065Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 46Lu Q. Wright D.D. Kamps M.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 3938-3948Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); therefore, and based on our deletion data pointing at HPIP as a potential E2A-PBX binding protein, we studied the effect of HPIP on the ability of E2A-PBX to induce a luciferase reporter gene driven by seven copies of a E2A-PBX binding site (TGATTGAT) (47Calvo K.R. Knoepfler P. McGrath S. Kamps M.P. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 8033-8043Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) upstream of the minimal FOS promoter. Co-expression of the E2A-PBX reporter plasmid, E2A-PBX, and HPIP decreased the E2A-PBX-mediated transcriptional activity seen in cells expressing the reporter plasmid and E2A-PBX alone by approximately 80% (Fig. 8). This was reproducible in multiple independent experiments and using two different expression vectors for HPIP 5 and full-length HPIP. Although PBX homeodomain protein is thought to function as a transcription factor, its mechanism of action remains unknown. The only proteins known to associate with PBX are other homeodomain proteins. Using a yeast two-hybrid screen with the full-length PBX1a as bait, we cloned two partial cDNAs from a fetal hematopoietic liver cell library encoding a novel nonhomeodomain protein that binds PBX1 as well as PBX2 and PBX3. The validity of the association of HPIP with PBX1 was supported by in vitro interaction in pull-down experiments and in vivo by co-precipitation from mammalian cells transiently transfected with both cDNAs. HPIP cDNA encodes a novel protein of 731 amino acid residues containing no homology to any known protein. The predicted HPIP protein has a calculated molecular mass of 80 kDa that migrates as a 98-kDa polypeptide in SDS-PAGE. The slow migration of HPIP possibly results from either post-translational modifications or intrinsic SDS-resistant folding of the protein. HPIP is predicted to have a coil-coil domain, suggesting that it interacts with other proteins. Northern blot analysis showed that HPIP was expressed in hematopoietic cell lines of erythroid (K562) and myeloid (HL60) origin. Interestingly, PBX2 and PBX3 but not PBX1 are expressed in HL60 cells (4Monica K. Galili N. Nourse J. Saltman D. Cleary M.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 6149-6157Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar), suggesting that HPIP may regulate the functions of the first two proteins in this cell line. Using Southern blot analysis of total amplified RNA, we showed that the expression of HPIP, as well as the expression of PBX1, was much higher in primitive hematopoietic cells than in more mature ones. These results indicate co-expression of PBX and HPIP in primitive hematopoietic precursors and suggest a functional interaction between these two proteins during early hematopoiesis. Expressed sequence tags corresponding to portions of HPIPDNA were identified from embryonic and adult human and mouse tissues, suggesting that the function of HPIP is not restricted to the hematopoietic system and that it may be implicated in the early stages of development. HPIP has two putative nuclear localization signals and a leucine-rich region that resembles a nuclear export signal. Our subcellular localization studies show HPIP to be localized mainly in the cytoplasm, although a small amount was found in the nucleus. This finding, together with the knowledge that PBX is expressed in both nuclei and cytosol (48LeBrun D.P. Matthews B.P. Feldman B.J. Cleary M.L. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 2059-2067Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), implies that HPIP could in principle interact with PBX in either compartment. If the initial interaction occurs in the cytoplasm, the heterodimer would either stay in the cytosol or enter the nucleus as a complex. If the initial interaction occurs in the nucleus, HPIP would have to enter the nucleus on its own and then bind PBX. In either case, the interaction between HPIP and PBX could block the function of the latter. Using deletion mutants of PBX1 in the yeast two-hybrid system, we mapped the HPIP binding domain of PBX to the region between aa 160 and 230. This sequence, on its own, was enough to support weak binding to HPIP; however, the full-length homeodomain was required for strong interaction. Two possibilities can account for this result; one is that the homeodomain directly contacts HPIP, and the other is that the homeodomain is needed to maintain the conformation of the N-terminal region open to bind HPIP. We support the first explanation, as we saw, using co-immunoprecipitation experiments with in vitrotranslated HPIP and PBX proteins, that the PBX homeodomain alone was able to bind the full-length HPIP (data not shown). Specific regions have been identified in PBX1 that mediate its functions. The PBX sequence that we found sufficient for binding to HPIP (aa 160–230), partially overlaps a domain reported by Lu and Kamps to selectively repress Sp1-activated transcription in a DNA binding-independent manner (49Lu Q. Kamps M.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 470-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Moreover, Kamps et al. reported a region of PBX1 upstream of the homeodomain (aa 89–232) in E2A-PBX1 as responsible for homeodomain-independent transformation of NIH 3T3 cells (50Kamps M.P. Wright D.D. Lu Q. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 19-30PubMed Google Scholar). The PBX homeodomain has been shown to be essential for binding of PBX to DNA and for interaction with HOX proteins (16Green N.C.

Furthermore, the PBX homeodomain is needed in E2A-PBX for blocking myeloid differentiation as well as for E2A-PBX-mediated apoptosis of hematopoietic cells (50Kamps M.P. Wright D.D. Lu Q.

Interestingly, in contrast to HOX proteins, HPIP does not have either of the tryptophan-containing motifs shown to bind the tryptophan-binding pocket of PBX (13Shen W.F. Chang C.P. Rozenfeld S.

Biol. 1995; 15: 5811-5819Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar), suggesting that the PBX homeodomain interacts with HPIP through a novel binding mechanism. Insight into the function of the interaction between HPIP and PBX1 was obtained by electrophoretic mobility shift assays, which revealed that the full-length HPIP protein inhibited the binding of different PBX-HOX complexes to DNA. Since the binding of PBX to DNA is essential for its transcriptional activity, this finding suggests that HPIP could modulate the transcription factor function of PBX. Indeed, we showed that the transient expression of HPIP in transfected cells significantly inhibited the enhanced E2A-PBX-mediated transcription of a reporter plasmid. These data are significant, since they indicate 1) a functional in vivo interaction between HPIP and PBX and 2) that HPIP can repress the transactivation activity of E2A-PBX. In summary, we have discovered HPIP, a novel nonhomeodomain protein that is able to interact with the different members of the PBX family as well as with the PBX sequences on E2A-PBX. We have shown that HPIP is co-expressed with PBX1 in early hematopoietic precursors and that HPIP is able to block the binding of PBX1 to a PBX-HOX consensus binding site and to inhibit the transcriptional activation activity of E2A-PBX. While the functions of HPIP remain to be fully resolved, the data presented here strongly suggest that it is likely to be a regulator of PBX proteins in their activities as transcriptional regulators.

https://openalex.org/W2022485917,"The Bacillus subtilis McpB is a class III chemotaxis receptor, from which methanol is released in response to all stimuli. McpB has four putative methylation sites based upon theEscherichia coli consensus sequence. To explore the nature of methanol release from a class III receptor, all combinations of putative methylation sites Gln371, Gln595, Glu630, and Glu637 were substituted with aspartate, a conservative substitution that effectively eliminates methylation. McpB(Q371D,E630D,E637D) in a Δ(mcpA mcpB tlpA tlpB)101::cat mcpC4::erm background failed to release methanol in response to either the addition or removal of the McpB-mediated attractant asparagine. In the same background, McpB(E630D,E637D) produced methanol only upon asparagine addition, whereas McpB(Q371D,E630D) produced methanol only upon asparagine removal. Thus methanol release from McpB was selective. Mutants unable to methylate site 637 but able to methylate site 630 had high prestimulus biases and were incapable of adapting to asparagine addition. Mutants unable to methylate site 630 but able to methylate site 637 had low prestimulus biases and were impaired in adaptation to asparagine removal. We propose that selective methylation of these two sites represents a method of adaptation novel from E. coliand present a model in which a charged residue rests between them. The placement of this charge would allow for opposing electrostatic effects (and hence opposing receptor conformational changes).

We propose that CheC, a protein not found in enteric systems, has a role in regulating this selective methylation. insertion/deletion chemotaxis buffer kilobase Chemotaxis is the process by which motile bacteria sense their environment and move toward more favorable surroundings. This is accomplished by altering the direction of flagellar rotation in response to changes in effector gradients. Information about the outside of the cell is transduced to the inside via transmembrane receptors called methyl-accepting chemotaxis proteins. Both ligand binding to the extracellular portion of the receptor and methyl modification of the intracellular portion induce conformational changes that modulate the activity of an associated histidine kinase, CheA (1Garrity L.F. Ordal G.W. Microbiology. 1997; 143: 2945-2951Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). CheA activity in turn regulates phosphorylation of the response regulator CheY, the activated form of which binds to the motor switch to promote smooth swimming (1Garrity L.F. Ordal G.W. Microbiology. 1997; 143: 2945-2951Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 2Bischoff D.S. Bourret R.B. Kirsch M.L. Ordal G.W. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 9256-9261Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). However, bacteria respond only to changes in their environment. In the presence of unchanging stimuli, the transduced signal is shut off despite the fact that ligand is still bound. This ability to adapt is essential for chemotaxis and allows cells to respond to ever changing environmental conditions. In Escherichia coli, adaptation depends largely upon the reversible methyl esterification of certain glutamate residues that serve to counteract the effects of bound ligand (3Terwilliger T.C. Koshland Jr., D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 7719-7725Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 4Terwilliger T.C. Bogones E. Wang E.A. Koshland Jr., D.E. J. Biol.

The methylesterase CheB, which is also CheA-activated, demethylates the receptor to promote adaptation to attractant removal. Receptor demethylation results in the release of volatile methanol from the cell (6Stock J.B. Koshland Jr., D.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1978; 75: 3659-3663Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 7Fuhrer K.K. Ordal G.W. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 7443-7448Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8Goldman D.J. Nettleton D.O. Ordal G.W.

CheB also functions as a deamidase that converts the nascent glutamine residues of some sites to glutamates, which in turn serve as sites for CheR-mediated methylation (3Terwilliger T.C. Koshland Jr., D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 7719-7725Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A dedicated methyltransferase, CheR, methylates the receptor using S-adenosylmethionine as the methyl donor to promote adaptation to attractant addition (10Springer W.R. Koshland Jr., D.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 533-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar, 11Burgess-Cassler A. Ullah A.H.J. Ordal G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 8412-8417Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A deletion in either of these genes results in cells that cannot adapt to stimuli (12Kirsch M.L. Zuberi A.R. Henner K.

Mechanistically, the binding of attractant to the N-terminal sensing domain of the E. coli aspartate receptor Tar is believed to cause a 1.6 Å downward displacement with a 5° tilt in the second transmembrane spanning helix (TM2) of one monomer relative to the other transmembrane helices of the homodimeric receptor complex. This piston-like displacement may be propagated down the length of the receptor because of its predominantly α-helical nature and thus affect CheA activity (13Lynch B.A. Koshland Jr., D.E. Proc.

The cytosolic C terminus is an antiparallel coiled-coil containing the methylation and signaling regions (Fig. 1). Methylation of the receptor presumably causes a compensatory shift in TM2 that restores basal CheA activity. Reversible receptor methyl esterification is also implicated in adaptation in Bacillus subtilis. However, deletions ofcheB and cheR merely impair adaptation, particularly at high receptor occupancy (12Kirsch M.L. Zuberi A.R. Henner K. Peters P.D. Yadzi M.A. Ordal G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25350-25356Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This has led to speculation that B. subtilis has both methylation-dependent and methylation-independent adaptation systems (9Kirsch M.L. Peters P.D. Hanlon D.W. Kirby J.R. Ordal G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 18610-18916Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Unlike E. coli, methanol is released both upon the addition and the removal of all attractants tested, a result that suggests the mechanism of adaptation is different between the two organisms. Moreover, adaptation also involves CheC, a protein with no E. coli counterpart (18Rosario M.M.L. Kirby J.R. Bochar D.A. Ordal G.W.

Sequence alignments reveal three distinct classes of receptor (21Le Moual H. Koshland Jr., D.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 261: 568-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Class III receptors are typified by the presence of four 14-amino acid insertion/deletion (INDEL)1regions located within the methylation and signaling regions. Class II receptors have only INDELs 2 and 3 within the signaling region, whereas class I receptors contain no INDELs (Fig. 1). These INDEL regions are postulated to give the antiparallel coiled-coil receptor helices extra length without altering their orientation (21Le Moual H. Koshland Jr., D.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 261: 568-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Enteric bacteria such as E. coli and Salmonella typhimurium have class I receptors that release methanol in response to negative stimuli while suppressing methanol release in response to positive stimuli (22Toews M.L.

Moreover, theB. subtilis receptor McpB undergoes net demethylation followed by net remethylation in response to the addition of asparagine such that the level of receptor methylation in the prestimulus and adapted states is the same (20Kirby J.R. Saulmon M.M. Kristich C.J. Ordal G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11092-11100Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). For class I receptors, attractants cause a net increase in receptor methylation, whereas repellents cause a net decrease (28Dunten P. Koshland Jr., D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 1491-1496Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29Borkovich D.A. Alex L.A. Simon M.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 6756-6760Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). The restoration of net receptor methylation in B. subtilisfollowing the addition of asparagine suggested that selective methylation changes might be taking place at a specific subset of sites on the unbound versus bound receptor. To explore this possibility, all combinations of glutamines/glutamates within the four putative consensus sites reported by Hanlon and Ordal (30Hanlon D.W. Ordal G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14038-14046Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) were substituted with aspartate. Similar substitutions in the E. coli receptor Tar were very poorly methylated (31Shapiro M.J. Koshland Jr., D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11054-11059Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In this way, we ensure a fixed negative charge at a given site. If the selective methylation hypothesis is true, then some mutants should greatly affect methanol release and adaptation to attractant addition, whereas other mutants should affect methanol release and adaptation to attractant removal.

A long polymerase chain reaction was performed on pAIN700 to create the various aspartate substitution mutants using the following 5′-phosphorylated primers (Integrated DNA Technologies) to generate pING1 through pING1234, where the number denotes an aspartate substitution at the indicated site (numbered 1 through 4 from the N to the C terminus) (34Fisher C.L.

The pAIN700 was subjected to polymerase chain reaction using the above primers, which were designed to create a new restriction site at the ligation junction to make the mutant identifiable by restriction digest. The polymerase chain reaction product was then ligated, digested with Dpn1 to remove template plasmid, and then transformed into TG1 E. coli. AmpR candidate colonies were screened using the introduced restriction sites (BglII for Q371D and Q595D, NheI for E630D, and EcoRV for E637D). The pertinent region of each single substitution mutant was sequenced at the W. M. Keck Center for Comparative and Functional Genomics. Double, triple, and quadruple substitutions were created in an iterative process. The proximity of site Glu630 to Glu637 required the use of a special forward primer to create the E630D/E637D double mutant. 2.8-kbEcoRI/NotI fragments containing the mutantmcpB alleles were subcloned into pAIN750 digested with the same enzymes to generate pONG1 through pONG1234. pAIN750 is a modified version of the amyEintegration vector pDG1730 (17Guerout-Fleury A.-M. Frandsen N. Stragier P. Gene (Amst.). 1996; 180: 57-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar). The variousmcpB alleles were crossed into the amyE locus of OI3180 (Δ(mcpA mcpB tlpA tlpB)101::cat) by linearizing the respective pONG subclones with AatII, transforming into OI3180, and selecting for CmRSpecRErmSAmy− (35Smibert R.M.

The above strains were then crossed with OI3280 chromosomal DNA, selecting for ErmR colonies to place all mutantmcpB alleles in a Δ(mcpA mcpB tlpA tlpB)101::cat mcpC4::erm background. Experiments were performed as described (33Ullah A.H.J. Ordal G.W. J. Bacteriol. 1981; 145: 958-965Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, 100 μl of a 2-ml overnight culture was added to 10 ml of LB, incubated at 37 °C, and grown to early stationary phase. Cells were washed twice in CB with 250 μg ml−1chloramphenicol, once in protoplast buffer with 250 μg ml−1 chloramphenicol, and resuspended toA 600 = 1.0 in 3 ml of protoplast buffer with 250 μg ml−1 chloramphenicol and 4 mg ml−1 lysozyme. Cells were shaken at 250 rpm at 37 °C for 20 min following the addition of 150 μl of 1 μml-[methyl-3H]methionine. 1-ml aliquots were removed and flash-frozen in dry ice/acetone baths. Samples were then thawed, and centrifuged at 3000 × gfor 45 min at 4 °C. Pelleted membranes were resuspended in 100 μl of 4× SDS solubilizer, boiled for 7 min, and electrophoresed at 15 V cm−1 through 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, pH 8.8 (36Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar). Gels were treated for fluorography as described (37Laskey R.A. Mills A.D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1975; 56: 335-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (3037) Google Scholar). Cells were treated as outlined for pulse label methylations except that nol-[methyl-3H]methionine was added. Western analysis of mcpB mutants was performed as described (38Kirby J.R. Niewold T.B. Maloy S. Ordal G.W. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 35: 44-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Antigen-antibody was detected using Supersignal (Pierce). Visualization required a 5-s to 1-min exposure of Kodak X-Omat AR film. The continuous flow assay has been described (39Thoelke M.S. Bedale W.A. Nettleton D.O. Ordal G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 2811-2816Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, 100 μl of a 2-ml overnight culture was added to 10 ml of LB, incubated at 37 °C, and grown to early stationary phase. Cells were washed three times in CB with 250 μg ml−1 chloramphenicol and resuspended toA 600 = 1.0 in 3 ml of CB with 250 μg ml−1 chloramphenicol. Cells were shaken at 250 rpm at 37 °C for 20 min following the addition of 150 μl of 1 μml-[methyl-3H]methionine. Radiolabeled cells were then transferred onto a 0.45-μm Nalgene filter and connected to the continuous flow apparatus at a flow rate of 15 ml min−1. Cells were pretreated with 504 μm asparagine in CB with 250 μg ml−1chloramphenicol for 4 min and then switched back to CB with chloramphenicol only for 6 min before the assay was initiated by collecting 0.3-min fractions. 504 μm asparagine was added at t = 5 and t = 15 min and removed att = 10 and t = 20 min. A 0.4-ml aliquot of each fraction was transferred to lidless 0.5-ml Eppendorf tubes, which were in turn placed into scintillation vials containing 2.5 ml of scintillation fluid. Vials were sealed, and volatile methanol was allowed to equilibrate with the scintillation fluid for 36 h before counting. Chemotaxis to asparagine is solely mediated through McpB. The value of 504 μm asparagine is predicted to titrate 90% of the McpB receptors based upon the experimentally determined K d value (40Ordal G.W. Villani D.P. Gibson K.J. J. Bacteriol. 1977; 129: 156-165Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The tethered cell assay has been described (20Kirby J.R. Saulmon M.M. Kristich C.J. Ordal G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11092-11100Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Strains were grown on tryptose blood agar base plates O/N in a 30 °C wet incubator. Cells were taken straight off the plate and suspended in minimal medium. The suspension was then diluted to A 600 = 0.014 in 25 ml of minimal medium and grown at 37 °C with vigorous shaking (250 rpm) for 4.5 h. 15 min prior to harvesting, 200 μl of a 5% glycerol, 0.5 m sodium lactate solution was added to the culture. The cells were blended at full speed in a Warring blender for 10 s to shear the flagella. A 250-μl aliquot of blended cells was placed atop a glass coverslip preincubated with 10 μl of anti-flagella antibody and incubated for 15 min. The coverslip was then inverted and placed within a laminar flow chamber to be observed by phase-contrast microscopy in a system similar to those described previously (9Kirsch M.L. Peters P.D. Hanlon D.W. Kirby J.R. Ordal G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 18610-18916Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 41Block S.M. Segall J.E. Berg H.C. J. Bacteriol. 1983; 154: 312-323Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). CB with or without 504 μmasparagine was pumped through the laminar flow chamber at a constant rate of 1 ml min−1. Rotating cells were videotaped and analyzed by a Hobson Tracker, Bacterial Edition (Hobson Tracking Systems Ltd., Sheffield, U.K.), which generates text files containing continuous time rotational data. Programs written with Matlab software (The Mathworks, Inc.) processed the data. For each cell, the continuous time rotational data were converted to discrete time data with a step size of 0.1 s. All the data points within a 4-s window were then averaged to generate a data set with a step size of 4 s that contained the probability of counterclockwise rotation (smooth swimming behavior). The data for all cells in the sample population were then pooled and averaged, and the resulting data were smoothed over a five data point window to generate the final graph. To test whether an aspartate substitution at a given site prevents its methylation, the quadruple aspartate mutant was tested in the continuous flow assay. In this experiment, the evolution of [3H]methanol was followed by collecting eluant fractions as buffer or buffer plus asparagine was passed over cells caught on a 0.45-μm filter (see “Experimental Procedures”). As expected, McpB(Q371D,Q595D,E630D,E637D)had no [3H]methanol release upon either the addition or removal of asparagine (data not shown). McpB(Q371D,E630D,E637D) also failed to release [3H]methanol (Fig. 2). Therefore, site 595 did not contribute to McpB methanol production and is not likely a site of methylation. Given the deviation of this site from the methylation consensus sequence, this was not too surprising (Fig. 1). Moreover, no methylation was observed for McpB(Q371D,E630D,E637D) in pulse label methylation experiments (data not shown; see “Experimental Procedures”). Thus [3H]methanol production from McpB was attributable only to sites 371, 630, and 637. Western blot analysis using anti-McpB antibody confirmed approximate wild-type expression for allmcpB mutants used in this study (data not shown). All experiments were done in a Δ(mcpA mcpB tlpA tlpB)101::cat mcpC4::erm background to avoid the possible complication of receptor cooperativity. We conclude that sites 371, 630, and 637 are the only sites of methylation on McpB. To determine the contribution of individual sites on methanol production, continuous flow assays were performed on each of the single substitution mutants. All mutants released [3H]methanol upon both the addition and removal of asparagine (Fig. 3). McpB(Q595D) had wild-type [3H]methanol production, a result consistent with it not being a site of methylation (Fig. 3 B). However, the release of [3H]methanol was markedly diminished for the remaining mutants. We conclude that no site is solely responsible for [3H]methanol release upon either the addition or removal of asparagine. Greater insight into the B. subtilismethylation system has come from the double aspartate substitution mutants. McpB(Q371D,E630D) failed to release [3H]methanol upon asparagine addition, whereas leaving [3H]methanol release upon asparagine removal intact (Fig.4 A). Thus sites 371 and 630 were responsible for [3H]methanol release upon asparagine addition, whereas the unaltered site 637 only contributed to [3H]methanol release upon asparagine removal. However, McpB(Q371D,E637D) released [3H]methanol upon both asparagine addition and removal. Unaltered site 630 was therefore indiscriminate and contributed to [3H]methanol release in both cases (Fig. 4 B). Finally, McpB(E630D,E637D)released [3H]methanol upon asparagine addition but failed to release [3H]methanol upon asparagine removal (Fig.4 C). Thus sites 630 and 637 were responsible for [3H]methanol release upon asparagine removal, whereas the unaltered site 371 only contributed to [3H]methanol release upon asparagine addition. It has been demonstrated for the E. coli receptor Tar that aspartate substitutions have polar effects on nearby sites. Specifically, methylation was nearly eliminated at sites seven residues N-terminal to a mutated site (31Shapiro M.J. Koshland Jr., D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11054-11059Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We do not know the extent to which an aspartate at site 637 effects methylation of site 630 or vice versa. However, we note that because [3H]methanol can be detected in both McpB(Q371D,E637D) and McpB(Q371D,E630D), the unaltered sites must be at least partially susceptible to methylation changes. We conclude that methanol evolution from McpB is selective. Only sites 371 and 630 are subject to methyl turnover upon asparagine addition, whereas only sites 630 and 637 are subject to methyl turnover upon removal. Methanol release upon asparagine removal for some mutants lagged behind that of the native receptor. [3H]Methanol release for both M"
https://openalex.org/W1976253518,"Rat brain phospholipase D1 (rPLD1) belongs to a superfamily defined by the highly conserved catalytic motif (H(X)K(X)4D, denoted HKD. rPLD1 contains two HKD domains, located in the N- and C-terminal regions. The integrity of the two HKD domains is essential for enzymatic activity. Our previous studies showed that the N-terminal half of rPLD1 containing one HKD motif can associate with the C-terminal half containing the other HKD domain to reconstruct wild type PLD activity (Xie, Z., Ho, W.-T. and Exton, J. H. (1998)J. Biol. Chem. 273, 34679–34682). In the present study, we have shown by mutagenesis that conserved amino acids in the HKD domains are important for both the catalytic activity and the association between the two halves of rPLD1. Furthermore, we found that rPLD1 could be modified by Ser/Thr phosphorylation. The modification occurred at the N-terminal half of the enzyme, however, the association of the N-terminal domain with the C-terminal domain was required for the modification. The phosphorylation of the enzyme was not required for its catalytic activity or response to PKCα and small G proteinsin vitro, although the phosphorylated form of rPLD1 was localized exclusively in the crude membrane fraction. In addition, we found that the individually expressed N- and C-terminal fragments did not interact when mixed in vitro and were unable to reconstruct PLD activity under these conditions. It is concluded that the association of the N- and C-terminal halves of rPLD1 requires their co-expression in vivo and depends on conserved residues in the HKD domains. The association is also required for Ser/Thr phosphorylation of the enzyme.

Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1436: 105-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). It hydrolyzes phosphatidylcholine to phosphatic acid and choline. Phosphatic acid is generally recognized as the signaling product of PLD and functions as an effector in different physiological processes. Phosphatic acid can be converted to diacylglycerol by phosphatidate phosphohydrolase or to lysophosphatidic acid by a specific phospholipase A2. Diacylglycerol is a well characterized activator for protein kinase C, while lysophosphatidic acid is a major extracellular signal that acts on specific cell surface receptors. PLD also catalyzes a phosphatidyl transfer reaction using primary alcohols as nucleophilic acceptors to produce phosphatidylalcohols. This reaction is used as a specific measure of PLD activity. The physiological function of PLD is still under investigation. Several studies have shown that PLD plays a role in a variety of signaling pathways (2Exton J.H. Physiol. Rev. 1997; 77: 303-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar). Different factors, including protein tyrosine kinases, protein kinase C (PKC), heterotrimeric and small G proteins, and intracellular Ca2+ regulate PLD activity directly or indirectly (2Exton J.H.

To date, two isoforms of mammalian PLD (PLD1 and PLD2) have been cloned. These isoforms share about 50% amino acid similarity, but exhibit quite different regulatory properties. PLD1 has a low basal activity and responds to PKC and to members of the Rho and ARF families of small G proteins (5Hammond S.M. Altshuller Y.M. Sung T.-C. Rudge S.A. Rose K. Engebrecht J. Morris A.J.

The PKC interaction domain has been mapped to the N-terminal part of the molecule (9Park S.-K. Min D.S. Exton J.H. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

PLD2, on the other hand, exhibits a high basal activity and generally shows little response to stimuli (13Kodaki T. Yamashita S. J. Biol.

However, a recent study has shown that PLD2 can be tyrosine phosphorylated and its activity up-regulated in HEK293 cells treated with epidermal growth factor (16Slaaby R. Jensen T. Hansen H.S. Frohman M.A. Seedorf K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33722-33727Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). The precise cellular localization of the two isoforms is not well defined. However, recent reports have shown that both isoforms are present in a caveolin-rich membrane fraction (17Czarny M. Lavie Y.

Ryu S.H. Biochem. 1999; 38: 3763-3769Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Sequence analysis has revealed that PLD belongs to a superfamily defined by an invariant motif, HXK(X)4D, denoted “HKD” (19Morris A.J. Engebrecht J. Frohman M.A. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1996; 17: 182-185Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar, 20Ponting C.P. Kerr I.D. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 914-922Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar, 21Koonin E.G. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 242-243Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). The enzymes within the family exhibit diverse functions and include phospholipid synthases, poxvirus envelope proteins, aYersinia murine toxin (Ymt), and the Nuc endonuclease. Despite the distinct substrate specificities of the superfamily members, the consensus HKD motif appears to be essential for their enzymatic activity. PLD contains two copies of the HKD motif. Mutation of either HKD motif inactivates human PLD1 and mouse PLD2 (11Sung T.C. Zhang Y. Morris A.J. Frohman M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3659-3666Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 22Sung T.-C. Roper R.L. Zhang Y. Rudge S.A. Temel R. Hammond S.M. Morris A.J. Moss B. Engebrecht J.

Biochemical and structural studies of the Nuc endonuclease and Ymt suggest that the histidine residue in the conserved motif is directly involved in the catalytic reaction by forming a phosphoenzyme intermediate (23Rudolph A.E.

A. 1998; 95: 9202-9207Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). We have cloned a PLD1 isoform from rat brain (rPLD1) and have studied its properties in vivo and in vitro (7Park S.-K. Provost J.P. Bae C.D. Ho W.-T. Exton J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29263-29271Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 9Park S.-K. Min D.S. Exton J.H. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Chem. 1998; 273: 4823-4826Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Our previous study of this isoform showed that N-terminal or C-terminal fragments containing only one of the HKD domains did not have PLD activity when expressed in COS7 cells (10Xie Z. Ho W.-T. Exton J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34679-34682Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). However, PLD activity was restored when the two fragments were coexpressed (10Xie Z. Ho W.-T. Exton J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34679-34682Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the N- and C-terminal fragments were shown to physically associate (10Xie Z. Ho W.-T. Exton J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34679-34682Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Thus, the two HKD domains are likely brought together to form an active catalytic center by interdomain association. In this study, we use site-directed mutagenesis to examine the importance of conserved amino acids in the HKD domains for the association of the N- and C-terminal halves of rPLD1. In the process of this investigation, we found that rPLD1 can be modified by Ser/Thr phosphorylation and this modification requires the interdomain association of the N- and C-terminal halves of the enzyme. 4β-Phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), phosphatidylinositol 4,5-biphosphate (PIP2), bovine serum albumin, Triton X-100, and microcystin were from Sigma. Phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (PC), and phosphatidylbutanol standard were from Avanti Polar Lipids Corp. Dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine, choline-[methyl-3H]-, and [3H]myristic acid were from NEN Life Science Products. Protein A-agarose beads, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, penicillin, streptomycin, and fetal bovine serum were from Life Technologies, Inc. The transfection reagent FuGENE6 and the protease inhibitor mixture were from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. COS7 cells were from American Type Culture Collection. SDS-polyacrylamide gels were from Novex. The PcDNA3 vectors and the monoclonal antibodies against the V5 and Xpress epitope tags were from Invitrogen. Anti-mouse antibodies conjugated with horseradish peroxidase were from Vector Laboratories. PKCα (recombinant human) was from Panvera. Purified Ser/Thr phosphatase mixture was generously provided by Dr. Roger Colbran (Vanderbilt University). The N-terminal Xpress-tagged full-length rPLD1 or the N- or C-terminal fragments of rPLD1 with coding regions corresponding to amino acids 1–584 and 585–1036, respectively, were created by PCR amplification and subcloned at theKpnI/XbaI sites in the polylinker region of PcDNA3.1 vector (Invitrogen) as described (10Xie Z. Ho W.-T. Exton J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34679-34682Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The C-terminal V5-tagged full-length rPLD1 containing amino acids 1 to 584 was also generated by PCR amplification followed by subcloning into theHindIII/XbaI site in the polylinker region of PcDNA3.1/V5 His A vector (Invitrogen). The forward PCR primer was 5′-AGGGTAAGCTTACCATGTCACTAAGAAGTGAGGC. The reverse primer was 5′-TGCTCTAGAGGAGGCGCTGTCGACGCT. The PCR fragments were subcloned in-frame with the C-terminal V5-tag. The site-directed mutations of rPLD1 were generated as described in the QuickChange™ Site-Directed Mutagenesis Instruction manual from Stratagene. All the constructs were sequenced to verify the coding regions of rPLD1. COS-7 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 4 mml-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 10% fetal bovine serum in humidified 10% CO2. Six-well plates were seeded with 2 × 105 COS-7 cells/well and 10 cm-dishes were seeded with 6 × 105 cells and transfected with FuGENE6 according to manufacturer's instructions. After 6 h transfection with FuGENE6, COS-7 cells in six-well plates were serum-starved (0.5% fetal bovine serum in Dulbecco's mdoified Eagle's medium) in the presence of 1 μCi/ml [3H]myristic acid. After overnight starvation, the cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and incubated in serum-free medium supplemented with 0.3% bovine serum albumin for 50 min. PLD activity was then assayed as described (28Malcolm K.C. Elliott C.M. Exton J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13135-13139Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were incubated in 0.3% 1-butanol for 25 min. Cells were then washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and stopped with methanol. Lipids were extracted, and the phosphatidylbutanol product was resolved by thin layer chromatography. Bands co-migrating with a phosphatidylbutanol standard were quantitated by scintillation counting. Two 10-cm dishes of COS-7 cells were harvested after transfection and overnight starvation as described above. The cells were washed twice with ice-cold lysis buffer (25 mm Hepes, pH 7.2, 10% glycerol, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm of dithiothreitol, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and protease inhibitor mixture). The cells were then resuspended in lysis buffer and passed through a 27-gauge needle five times. The cell lysate was first spun at 500 × g for 10 min to remove unbroken cells. The supernatant was then spun at 120,000 × g for 45 min at 4 °C to separate the cytosolic and crude membrane fractions. The particulate fraction was washed four times with the lysis buffer and then passed through a 27-gauge needle until the pellet was resuspended. The Bradford method was used for the quantitation of protein in the cytosolic and the crude membrane fractions. When the interaction of the N- and C-terminal domains was examined in vitro, the membrane fraction expressing either N- or C-terminal or both fragments were solubilized in the above lysis buffer with the supplementation of Triton X-100 to a final concentration of 0.5% and SDS to 0.1%. The suspension was first mixed as indicated under “Results” and spun at 120,000 × g for 10 min to remove unsolubilized debris and then the supernatant was subjected to immunoprecipitation as described below. Protein samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE on 8% gels and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Immobilon-P, Millipore). The blots were then blocked with 5% non-fat milk and incubated with appropriate primary antibodies followed by incubation with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody. Immunoreactive bands were detected using enhanced chemiluminescence. COS-7 cells cultured on 6-well plates (35 mm well) were transfected and starved as described above. The cells were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and then resuspended in immunoprecipitation buffer (IP buffer) containing 25 mm Hepes, pH 7.2, 10% glycerol, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 50 mm KC1, 0.5% Triton X-100, 10 mm NaF, 10 mmNa4P2O7, 1.2 mmNa3VO4, 1 μm microcystin, and 2 tablets of protease mixture. The cell suspension was then passed through a 27-gauge needle five times and the resulting cell lysate was spun at 15,000 rpm in an Eppendorf microcentrifuge for 10 min at 4 °C to pellet the unbroken cells. The supernatant was then precleared by mixing it with 1 μg of affinity purified mouse IgG and 20 μl of a 1:1 slurry of protein A beads for 1 h at 4 °C. The mixture was then spun and the resulting supernatant was incubated with 3 μl of Xpress mouse antibody and 20 μl of protein A beads overnight. The immunoprecipitates were washed four times with the IP buffer and then resuspended in SDS sample buffer and analyzed by Western blotting. Full-length or N- and C-terminal halves of rPLD1 were immunoprecipitated by anti-Xpress antibodies as described above and washed twice with the IP buffer to remove proteins nonspecifically bound to the protein A beads and an additional two times with dephosphorylation buffer (25 mm Hepes, pH 7.2, 50 mm KCl, 10% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 2 tablets of protease inhibitor mixture) to remove the detergent in the IP buffer. The resulting products on the protein A-agarose beads were then suspended in the reaction buffer and treated with either no addition, or with the addition of Ser/Thr phosphatase mixture (29MacMillan L.B. Bass M.A. Cheng N. Howard E.F. Tamura M. Strack S. Wadzinski B.E. Colbran R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35845-35854Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) containing mainly PP1 and PP2A or with the phosphatase mixture preinactivated with 1 μm microcystin, a potent inhibitor of protein phosphatase type 1 and 2A (30MacKintosh C. Beattie K.A. Klumpp S. Cohen P. Codd G.A. FEBS Lett. 1990; 264: 187-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (1401) Google Scholar). After 30 min incubation at room temperature, the reaction was either stopped by the addition of SDS sample buffer and analyzed by Western blotting, or the agarose beads were reisolated, washed with dephosphorylation buffer, and used for in vitro PLD assay. The catalytic activity of the immunoprecipitated full-length or N- and C-terminal halves of rPLD1 was measured by the formation of [3H]phosphatidylbutanolin vitro as described (7Park S.-K. Provost J.P. Bae C.D. Ho W.-T. Exton J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29263-29271Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Briefly, phospholipid vesicles generated from PE/PIP2/PC (16:1.4:1) containing [palmitoyl-3H]PC (0.5 μCi/reaction) were used with butanol (1% v/v) as substrates. The reaction mixtures were incubated at 37 °C for 30 min and stopped with chloroform/methanol/HCl (50:98:2). The lipids were extracted from the organic phase and resolved by thin layer chromatography. Bands co-migrating with a phosphatidylbutanol standard were quantitated by scintillation counting. Our previous work showed that the N-terminal fragment of rPLD1 containing one of the HKD domains can form a functional complex with the C-terminal fragment containing the other HKD domain (10Xie Z. Ho W.-T. Exton J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34679-34682Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Studies of human PLD1 have shown that mutation of amino acids in the conserved HKD motifs diminishes PLD activity (22Sung T.-C. Roper R.L. Zhang Y. Rudge S.A. Temel R. Hammond S.M. Morris A.J. Moss B. Engebrecht J. Frohman M.A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4519-4530Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar) and recent characterizations of the Nuc endonuclease (25Gottlin E.B. Rudolph A.E. Zhao Y. Matthews H.R. Dixon J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9202-9207Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar) and Ymt (23Rudolph A.E. Stuckey J.A. Zhao Y. Matthews H.R. Patton W.A. Moss J. Dixon J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11824-11831Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) have demonstrated that the conserved histidine residue in the HKD motif directly participates in the catalytic reaction by forming a phosphoenzyme intermediate. We tested the possibility that the HKD motifs and their surrounding regions are important for the interdomain association. Patches of hydrophobic amino acids containing mainly leucine, isoleucine, and valine found either within or close to the HKD domains are highly conserved among mammalian PLD1, PLD2, and yeast PLD SPO14 as outlined in Fig.1 A. We examined the roles of these amino acids in the interdomain interaction by mutating them to the less hydrophobic amino acid alanine. The mutations in the N-terminal half of rPLD1 were L467A, V468A, I469A, and I470A, and the mutations in the C-terminal half of rPLD1 were L861A, L862A, I863A, V869A, I870A, and I871A. In the following text, the wild type N- and C-terminal fragments of rPLD1 are referred to as rPLD1NT and rPLD1CT, respectively. In addition, the rPLD1NT used in the following experiments was tagged at its C terminus with a V5 epitope and rPLD1CT was tagged at its N terminus with an Xpress epitope. These two constructs have been shown to be able to associate and reconstruct wild type PLD activity when co-transfected in COS-7 cells (10Xie Z. Ho W.-T. Exton J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34679-34682Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). We first examined the effect of the mutations of the hydrophobic amino acids on PLD activity in COS-7 cells (Fig. 1 B). Co-transfection of wild type rPLD1NT with rPLD1CT in COS-7 cells reconstructed a PLD activity comparable to wild type. Mutation L467A in rPLD1NT decreased the reconstructed activity to 60% of that of wild type, while mutations V468A and I469A reduced it to 30% of wild type activity, and mutation I470A produced no activity above vector alone. When rPLD1CT carrying a V869A mutation was co-transfected with wild type rPLD1NT, 30% of wild type PLD activity was obtained. When mutation I871A was generated at the C-terminal half of rPLD1, residual activity was reproducibly observed when the mutated construct was co-transfected with the wild type N-terminal half in COS-7 cells. However, when mutations L861A, L862A, I863A, and I870A were examined, only background PLD activity comparable to vector control was observed. Thus, all the alanine mutations generated in either the N- or C-terminal halves decreased the PLD activity, although to different degrees. The loss of activity could not be ascribed to poor expression of the mutant proteins (Fig. 2,A and C). In addition to alanine mutations, we also mutated I470 to valine or glycine. Although the I470A mutation reduced the PLD activity to background level, wild-type activity was observed when Ile470 was conservatively mutated to valine, a more hydrophobic amino acid than alanine (Fig. 1 B, lane 6). However, mutation of Ile470 to glycine totally abolished the PLD activity (data not shown). Similarly, mutating Ile469 or Ile871 to glycine diminished the residual PLD activity to vector control (data not shown). These results suggest that these patches of hydrophobic amino acids are important for PLD activity. To investigate the roles of these amino acids in the association of the N- and C-terminal fragments of PLD, immunoprecipitation assays were performed. As mentioned above, the rPLD1NT and rPLD1CT fragments were differentially tagged with V5 and Xpress epitopes, respectively. The COS-7 cells were co-transfected with the indicated wild type or mutant N- and C-terminal fragments of rPLD1 and the cell lysates (Fig. 2,A and C) were immunoprecipitated with anti-Xpress antibodies, and analyzed by Western blotting with anti-V5 antibodies (Fig. 2, B and D). As a negative control, rPLD1NT was co-transfected with a nonspecific plasmid expressing Xpress-tagged β-galactosidase. No protein band was detected by anti-V5 antibodies in this control experiment (lane 1 in Fig. 2, Band D). As a positive control, rPLD1CT was co-transfected with rPLD1NT and a protein corresponding to the size of rPLD1NT (∼66 kDa) was detected by anti-V5 antibodies (lane 2 in Fig. 2,B and D). A slower migrating band was also detected, and the significance of this is described in a later section. When mutated N- or C-terminal fragments were co-transfected with their corresponding wild type C- or N-terminal halves, we found that rPLD1NT (L467A) showed a comparable ability as wild type rPLD1NT to associate with rPLD1CT (Fig. 2 B, lane 3). However, rPLD1NT (V468A), rPLD1NT (I469A), or rPLD1CT (V869A) retained only partial ability to associate with its corresponding wild type C- or N-terminal half (shown in Fig. 2, B and D), which is consistent with their limited ability to reconstruct a wild type PLD activity (Fig.1 B). As for the L861A, L862A, I863A, I870A, and I871A mutants of rPLD1CT, only very slight or no association with their N-terminal halves was observed (Fig. 2 D). Consistent with its effect on PLD activity, rPLD1NT (I470A) lost its ability to associate with the C-terminal fragment, whereas the I470V mutation did not affect the association between rPLD1NT and PLD1CT (Fig.2 B). In addition, mutation of Ile469, Ile470, Ile863, or Ile871 to glycine all reduced the interdomain association to the background level (Fig. 3 or data not shown). Examination of the expression of the mutated N- or C-terminal fragments in COS-7 cells showed that all the mutants were stably expressed at levels comparable with that of the corresponding wild type fragment (Fig. 2,A and C) and were localized in the crude membrane fraction (data not shown). Based on the above results, we conclude that these hydrophobic amino acids are important for the association between the N- and C-terminal halves of rPLD1. The reduced PLD activity caused by the various mutations (Fig. 1 B) correlated closely with their effects on the interdomain association. Thus it seems very likely that the loss of catalytic activity is due to the decreased interdomain association caused by the mutations of these hydrophobic amino acids. Several mutations in the HKD motifs, such as H464D, K860R, and G479V have been shown previously to inactivate the enzymatic activity of human PLD1 (22Sung T.-C. Roper R.L. Zhang Y. Rudge S.A. Temel R. Hammond S.M. Morris A.J. Moss B. Engebrecht J. Frohman M.A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4519-4530Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). We generated the corresponding H464D, H464E, and G479V mutations in the N-terminal half and K860R in the C-terminal half of rPLD1. Consistent with the findings with human PLD1, all these rPLD1 mutants lost the ability to reconstruct PLD activity when co-transfected with their corresponding wild type halves (data not shown). Furthermore, we found that these mutations also dramatically decreased the interaction between the N- and C-halves of rPLD1 (Fig.2 E), although these mutant constructs were stably expressed in COS-7 cells (Fig. 2 F). Analysis of human PLD1 mutants in the conserved HKD domains has suggested that no significant conformational changes were generated by the mutations (22Sung T.-C. Roper R.L. Zhang Y. Rudge S.A. Temel R. Hammond S.M. Morris A.J. Moss B. Engebrecht J. Frohman M.A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4519-4530Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). In addition, evaluation of HKD mutations in Ymt by UV and CD spectral measurements indicated no disruption of secondary structure (23Rudolph A.E. Stuckey J.A. Zhao Y. Matthews H.R. Patton W.A. Moss J. Dixon J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11824-11831Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Thus, the effects of the point mutations in the HKD motifs on the interdomain association and catalytic activity or rPLD1 were unlikely to be nonspecifically caused by dramatic conformational changes of the molecule. In summary, the results shown above suggest that"
https://openalex.org/W2002694377,"The Crk family of adaptor proteins participate in diverse signaling pathways that regulate growth factor-induced proliferation, anchorage-dependent DNA synthesis, and cytoskeletal reorganization, important for cell adhesion and motility. Using kidney epithelial 293T cells for transient co-transfection studies and the nerve growth factor (NGF)-responsive PC12 cell line as a model system for neuronal morphogenesis, we demonstrate that the non-receptor tyrosine kinase c-Abl is an intermediary for NGF-inducible c-Crk II phosphorylation on the negative regulatory Tyr222. Transient expression of a c-Crk II Tyr222 point mutant (c-Crk Y222F) in 293T cells induces hyperphosphorylation of paxillin on Tyr31 and enhances complex formation between c-Crk Y222F and paxillin as well as c-Crk Y222F and c-Abl, suggesting that c-Crk II Tyr222phosphorylation induces both the dissociation of the Crk SH2 domain from paxillin and the Crk SH3 domain from c-Abl. Interestingly, examination of the early kinetics of NGF stimulation in PC12 cells showed that c-Crk II Tyr222 phosphorylation preceded paxillin Tyr31 phosphorylation, followed by a transient initial dissociation of the c-Crk II paxillin complex. PC12 cells overexpressing c-Crk Y222F manifested a defect in cellular adhesion and neuritogenesis that led to detachment of cells from the extracellular matrix, thus demonstrating the biological significance of c-Crk II tyrosine phosphorylation in NGF-dependent morphogenesis. Whereas previous studies have shown that Crk SH2 binding to paxillin is critical for cell adhesion and migration, our data show that the phosphorylation cycle of c-Crk II determines its dynamic interaction with paxillin, thereby regulating turnover of multiprotein complexes, a critical aspect of cytoskeletal plasticity and actin dynamics. The Crk family of adaptor proteins participate in diverse signaling pathways that regulate growth factor-induced proliferation, anchorage-dependent DNA synthesis, and cytoskeletal reorganization, important for cell adhesion and motility. Using kidney epithelial 293T cells for transient co-transfection studies and the nerve growth factor (NGF)-responsive PC12 cell line as a model system for neuronal morphogenesis, we demonstrate that the non-receptor tyrosine kinase c-Abl is an intermediary for NGF-inducible c-Crk II phosphorylation on the negative regulatory Tyr222. Transient expression of a c-Crk II Tyr222 point mutant (c-Crk Y222F) in 293T cells induces hyperphosphorylation of paxillin on Tyr31 and enhances complex formation between c-Crk Y222F and paxillin as well as c-Crk Y222F and c-Abl, suggesting that c-Crk II Tyr222phosphorylation induces both the dissociation of the Crk SH2 domain from paxillin and the Crk SH3 domain from c-Abl. Interestingly, examination of the early kinetics of NGF stimulation in PC12 cells showed that c-Crk II Tyr222 phosphorylation preceded paxillin Tyr31 phosphorylation, followed by a transient initial dissociation of the c-Crk II paxillin complex. PC12 cells overexpressing c-Crk Y222F manifested a defect in cellular adhesion and neuritogenesis that led to detachment of cells from the extracellular matrix, thus demonstrating the biological significance of c-Crk II tyrosine phosphorylation in NGF-dependent morphogenesis. Whereas previous studies have shown that Crk SH2 binding to paxillin is critical for cell adhesion and migration, our data show that the phosphorylation cycle of c-Crk II determines its dynamic interaction with paxillin, thereby regulating turnover of multiprotein complexes, a critical aspect of cytoskeletal plasticity and actin dynamics. Src homology 2 focal adhesion kinase nerve growth factor Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium green fluorescent protein phosphate-buffered saline bovine serum albumin The Crk adaptor proteins, first described as the product of an avian oncogene, v-crk, contain Src homology 2 (SH2)1 and SH3 domains that serve as binding sites for a diverse set of signaling proteins (1Birge R.B.

Although c-Crk and v-Crk may have some overlapping functions due to their SH2 and N-terminal SH3 domains, both c-Crk II and CrkL contain an additional SH3 domain in the C terminus (10Hoeve J.T.

Biol. 1992; 12: 3482-3489Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar) as well as a conserved tyrosine (c-Crk II Tyr221 and CrkL Tyr207 in the human isoforms; c-Crk II Tyr222in the avian isoform) that can be phosphorylated by the non-receptor tyrosine kinase c-Abl (17Feller S.M.

Biol. 1998; 18: 5082-5090Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Moreover, c-Crk Tyr222 is flanked by an AQPS motif in the linker region, which when phosphorylated, conforms to a consensus Crk SH2 binding site and has been hypothesized to negatively regulate c-Crk function(s) by forming an intramolecular bridge (19Rosen M.K. Yamazaki T. Gish G.D. Kay C.M. Pawson T. Kay L.E. Nature. 1995; 374: 477-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Although these studies suggest a model of c-Crk regulation that is analogus to that of Src family tyrosine kinases upon phosphorylation by C-terminal Src kinase (CSK) (20Thomas J.E. Soriano P. Brugge J.S. Science. 1991; 254: 568-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), the underlying mechanism by which phosphorylated Tyr222modulates c-Crk II biological functions is not well understood. Following their activation by binding to extracellular matrix molecules, integrins couple with intracellular tyrosine kinases such as FAK, Pyk2, Src, and c-Abl, leading to the formation of complex signaling networks involving kinases, their substrates, and adaptor proteins (21Guan J.L. Shalloway D. Nature. 1992; 358: 690-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (724) Google Scholar, 22Lev S. Moreno H. Martinez R. Canoll P. Peles E. Musaacchio J.M. Plowman G.D. Rudy B. Schlessinger J.

Two of the major tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins that orchestrate the assembly of focal adhesions are paxillin and p130cas (26Turner C.E. Miller J.T. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 1583-1591Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 27Nojima Y. Morino N. Mimura T. Hamasaki K. Furuya H. Sakai R. Sato T. Tachibana K. Morimoto C. Yazaki Y. Hirai H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15398-15402Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). Although unrelated structurally, both genes encode multidomain proteins that can associate with and become phosphorylated by various nonreceptor tyrosine kinases (FAK, Src, CSK, and c-Abl for paxillin and FAK and Src family members for p130cas) (25Giancotti F.G. Rouslahti E. Science. 1999; 285: 1028-1032Crossref PubMed Scopus (3794) Google Scholar, 28Schlaepfer D.D. Hauck C.R. Sieg D.J. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 1999; 71: 435-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (1027) Google Scholar). Furthermore, after tyrosine phosphorylation, both paxillin and p130cas present multiple docking sites for the Crk SH2 domain (29Birge R. Fajardo J. Reichman C. Shoelson S. Songyang Z. Cantley L. Hanafusa H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 4648-4656Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar, 30Schaller M.D. Parsons J.T. Mol. Cell.

EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3748-3756Crossref PubMed Scopus (592) Google Scholar), thereby recruiting additional signaling proteins to focal adhesions via the Crk N-terminal SH3 domain (3Feller S.M. Posern G. Voss J. Kardinal C. Sakkab D. Zheng J. Knudsen B. J. Cell. Physiol. 1998; 177: 535-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Accordingly, the binding of DOCK180 to p130cas·Crk complex has been implicated in altering cell morphology via the activation of Rac1 (32Kiyokawa E. Hashimoto Y. Kurata T. Sugimura H. Matsuda M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24479-24484Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar), and mutations in either the Crk SH2 domain or the Crk-binding sites of p130cas have been shown to impair cell migration in carcinoma cells (14Klemke R.L. Leng J. Molander R. Brooks P.C. Vuori K. Cheresh D.A. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 961-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar). Recently, it has also been shown that phosphorylation of Tyr31 and Tyr118 on paxillin regulates cell migration through an association of Crk in NBT-II cells (33Petit V. Boyer B. Lentz D. Turner C.E. Thiery J.P. Valles V.M. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 957-970Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar), suggesting that Crk binding to paxillin and p130cas may have redundant functions. Although integrin-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation of paxillin and p130cas has been best characterized, various growth factors including insulin, epidermal growth factor, and platelet-derived growth factor also induce rapid changes in cell shape that correlate with tyrosine phosphorylation of paxillin and p130cas (34Abedi H. Dawes K.E. Zachary I. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11367-11376Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 35Casamassima A. Rozengurt E. J. Biol.

Chem. 1997; 272: 25993-25998Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Although these results clearly support a model of cross-talk between receptor tyrosine kinases and molecules residing in focal adhesions, it remains unclear whether Crk proteins might be signaling intermediates that orchestrate these interactions. Using the PC12 cells as a model system of nerve growth factor (NGF)-induced neuronal morphogenesis (37Greene L. Tischler A. Adv. Cell. Neurobiol. 1982; 3: 373-414Crossref Google Scholar), we and others have previously shown that NGF induces rapid actin reorganization and membrane ruffling that accompany alterations in cell shape (38Altun-Gultekin Z.F. Wagner J.A. J. Neurosci. Res. 1996; 44: 308-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), with concomitant tyrosine phosphorylation of c-Crk II and paxillin (4Hempstead B.L. Birge R.B. Fajardo J.E. Glassman R. Mahadeo D. Kraemer R. Hanafusa H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1964-1971Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 39Ribon V. Saltiel A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7375-7380Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). In the present study, we describe a novel pathway in which activation of the NGF receptor Trk A leads to c-Abl-mediated phosphorylation of c-Crk II at Tyr222, which catalyzes the dissociation of the Crk SH2 domain from paxillin and the dissociation of the Crk SH3 domain from c-Abl. The significance of this mechanism is highlighted by the findings that a c-Crk II Tyr222 mutant (c-Crk Y222F), while causing constitutive complex formation between c-Crk and paxillin as well as c-Crk and c-Abl, impairs NGF-dependent cellular spreading and neurite outgrowth. Thus, although previous studies have indicated that Crk binding to paxillin and p130cas is critical for cell adhesion and motility, we propose that the dynamic nature of substratum adhesion and detachment, a critical aspect of NGF-induced morphogenesis, is determined in part by the phosphorylation/dephosphorylation cycle of c-Crk II on Tyr222. Fibroblasts immortalized from Abl (−/−) or FAK (−/−) homozygous mice were generous gifts of David Baltimore (California Institute of Technology) and Tadashi Yamamoto (Tokyo University), respectively, and were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% calf serum. Abl (−/−) fibroblasts engineered to stably re-express wild-type c-Abl after DNA transfection with pBabe-c-Abl were a gift from Tohru Ouchi (Mount Sinai School of Medicine). Wild-type PC12 cells were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% calf serum and 5% horse serum. TrkA-overexpressing PC12-615 cells, c-Crk II overexpressing PC12 cells, and c-Crk Y222F-expressing PC12 cells were maintained in DMEM containing 10% calf serum and 5% horse serum with 200 μg/ml G418. 293T cells and Bosc23 ecotropic virus-packaging cell lines were grown in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. Anti-peptide polyclonal antibodies that recognize Tyr222-phosphorylated c-Crk II (pCrk) were provided by Michiyuki Matsuda (National Institute of Infectious Diseases, Tokyo, Japan) (40Hashimoto Y. Katayama H. Kiyokawa E. Ota S. Kurata T. Gotoh N. Otsuka N. Shibata M. Matsuda M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17186-17191Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), and monoclonal anti-Src antibodies were from Joan Brugge (Harvard Medical School). Anti-TrkA polyclonal antibodies were generated as described previously (41Hempstead B.L. Rabin S.J. Kaplan L. Reid S. Parada L.F. Kaplan D.R. Neuron. 1992; 9: 883-896Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). Commerically available antisera were purchased from the indicated sources: anti-phosphotyrosine (Tyr(P)) antibodies PY20 (Transduction Laboratories), 4G10 (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.), and PY-99 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology); anti-FLAG monoclonal M2 (Eastman Kodak Co.); anti-c-Abl monoclonal 8E9 (Pharmingen) and anti-c-Abl monoclonal Ab-3 (Calbiochem); anti-paxillin monoclonal (Zymed Laboratories Inc. or Transduction Laboratories); anti-FAK, anti-c-Crk II, and anti-p130cas (all from Santa Cruz Biotechnology). The c-crk II, c-abl, and trkA plasmids and respective mutants have been previously described. Briefly, avian c-crk II and c-crk Y222F were subcloned into the pEBG vector, driven by the human elongation factor 1-α promotor (42Mayer B.J. Hirai H. Sakai R. Curr. Biol. 1995; 5: 296-305Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). Wild-type and kinase-deficient (K290M) murine type IV c-abl (43Ben-Neriah Y. Bernards A. Paskind M. Daley G.Q. Baltimore D. Cell. 1986; 44: 577-586Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar) were provided by David Baltimore as described previously (44Mayer B.J. Baltimore D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2883-2894Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar) and were subcloned into pcDNA3 (Invitrogen). Expression plasmids for TrkA (pcDNA3-trkA), kinase-dead c-Src (pBabe K295M src), or kinase-dead FAK (pCR K454M FAK) were provided by David Kaplan (McGill University), Hisataka Sabe (Osaka Bioscience institute), and Steven Hanks (University of Virginia), respectively. To construct a FLAG epitope-tagged paxillin expression vector, a full-length chicken paxillin cDNA in pGEX (26Turner C.E. Miller J.T. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 1583-1591Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was digested with BamHI and then subcloned into pFLAG-CMV2 (Eastman Kodak) usingBamHI-EcoRI linkers. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). The following sequences (5′-3′) of the sense mutagenic oligonucleotides were used, with mismatches indicated in uppercase: for the Y31F mutation, gag gaa acg cct tTc tcc tac cca act g; for Y118F, gag gaa cac gtg tTc agc ttc cca aac; and for Y182F, g acc gga cct cac tT t gtc atc cca gag. All point mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing. To generate clonal PC12 cell lines stably overexpressing Crk protein, cells were transfected with 18 μg of pEBG-c-Crk II or pEBG-c-Crk Y222F plasmid DNA and 2 μg of pMEXneo using the LipofectAMINE™ reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.), and cell lines were expanded as described previously (4Hempstead B.L. Birge R.B. Fajardo J.E. Glassman R. Mahadeo D. Kraemer R. Hanafusa H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1964-1971Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). We found that a high level of c-Crk II or c-Crk Y222F expression was unstable in PC12 cells over multiple passage. 2M. Escalante and R. B. Birge, unpublished result. Therefore, cell lines were routinely monitored for consistent levels of of c-Crk II or c-Crk Y222F expression, and when necessary, aliquots of early passaged lines were re-established from liquid nitrogen stocks. For transient transfections, subconfluent cultures of 293T cells were transfected for 4 h in serum-free Opti-MEM with plasmid DNAs using the LipofectAMINE reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.), and cells were lysed 48 h after transfection. Where applicable, 293T cells were stimulated with 100 ng/ml NGF (Collaborative Biomedical Sciences) in serum-free DMEM before lysis. A cDNA encoding full-length c-Crk II or c-Crk Y222F was subcloned into a bicistronic pCX-bsr retroviral vector in which c-Crk II and green fluorescent protein (GFP) are expressed from the same transcript via an internal ribosome entry site. c-Crk-expressing virus was produced by LipofectAMINE-mediated transfection of 1.0 μg of pCX-crk DNA together with 1.0 μg of pC-Eco retroviral DNA into the Bosc23 replication incompetent ecotropic packaging line (Retromax™, Imgen) according to the manufacturer's protocols. Transfection media was replaced with 10 ml of DMEM containing 10% fetal calf serum for 24 h and then collected and frozen at −70 °C. The cells were re-fed with fresh DMEM (10 ml) and maintained for an additional 16 h. A total of 20 ml of virus-containing tissue culture media were pooled, centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 3 h, and resuspended into 2.0 ml of PC12 cell medium containing 7 μg/ml Polybrene. PC12 cells, seeded at 50% confluency, were infected with the concentrated stock for 48 h, and medium was changed and incubated for an additional 48 h. Between 20 and 30% PC12 cells were GFP-positive, and high levels of ectopic protein expression was detectable for up to 1 week. PC12 cells were incubated with phosphatidylethanolamine-conjugated anti-Annexin V (Chemicon) in the binding buffer (5 mm CaCl2, 140 mm NaCl, 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4) for 30 min at 4 °C, and stained cells were analyzed using FACScan. For sorting, PC12 cells infected with each GFP expression vector were sorted by green fluorescence using FACStarPlus (Becton Dickinson Inc, San Jose, CA). For analysis of adherent and non-adherent pools, PC12 cells were infected with pCX virus, and 3 days after infection, poorly adherent cells were collected by gentle trituration and pooling the media after washing in PBS. The adherent cells were harvested mechanically in PBS containing 10 mm EDTA. The ratio of total GFP-positive cells in each population was quantified by flow cytometry. 293T cells were lysed in ice-cold HNTG buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, and 1% Triton X-100) containing 0.1 mm sodium molybdate, 1 mm sodium vanadate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 10 μg/ml aprotinin. PC12 cells were lysed in TLB buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 137 mm NaCl, 2 mmEDTA, 20 mm β-glycerophosphate, 2 mm sodium pyrophosphate, and 10 mm NaF) containing phosphate and protease inhibitors. Cleared lysates were incubated with specific antibodies (typically 1–2 μg) for 3 h at 4 °C followed by incubation with protein A-Sepharose beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) or protein G plus-Sepharose (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). After washing with lysis buffer, immune complexes were subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis using standard protocols. Blots were incubated with the indicated primary antibodies and the appropriate horseradish peroxide-conjugated secondary antibodies, followed by detection using enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) reagent (Renaissance, NEN Life Science Products). Immune complex kinase assays for c-Abl were performed using [γ-32P]ATP and GST-Crk 120–225 as an exogenous substrate as described previously (17Feller S.M. Knudsen B. Hanafusa H. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2341-2351Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). After 20 min at room temperature, kinase reactions were terminated by boiling in SDS sample buffer before SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Gels fixed in 50% methanol, 10% acetic acid were subjected to autoradiography. Quantification of kinase activity was performed using a Molecular Dynamics Phospho-Imager. Wild-type PC12 and c-Crk II- or c-Crk Y222F-expressing PC12 cells were plated on glass coverslips coated with collagen type IV and cultured in the presence of NGF for the indicated times (5Teng K.K. Courtney J.C. van Bergen Henegouwen P. Birge R.B. Hempstead B.L. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 1996; 8: 157-170Crossref Scopus (14) Google Scholar). After rinsing with PBS, cells were fixed at room temperature for 30 min in 3% paraformaldehyde, permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 for 5 min, and incubated with anti-paxillin monoclonal antibody (Zymed Laboratories Inc., diluted 1:200 in PBS containing 0.2% gelatin). After washing, cells were incubated with fluorescein-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (1:200 dilution). To detect F-actin, cells were incubated with rhodamine-conjugated phalloidin (Molecular Probes;1:200 dilution) for 30 min, washed in PBS, and mounted in Vectashield (Vector Labs). To assess the extent of plasma membrane flattening, cells were labeled with BSA-conjugated DiI (kindly provided by Sushmita Mukherjee, Weill Medical College of Cornell University) for 1 min, washed in PBS, and immediately fixed in 3% paraformaldehyde. Cells were examined with an epifluorescence microscope at 100× (Nikon) or with a confocal laser-scanning microscope (Bio-Rad) using 60× objective, generating 0.54-μm sections. Serial X-Y sections obtained from the confocal microscope were reanalyzed in the x-zplane using NIH Image software to make height and area measurements. Height measurements were made by averaging the height of threez-sections per cell. Area measurements were calculated by tracing the outline of a representative slice. Cell attachment was assessed according to the methods of Tomaselli (45Tomaselli K.J. Damsky C.H. Reichardt L.F. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 2347-2358Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Briefly, PC12 cells were plated in 96-well flat-bottomed plates coated with BSA (1 mg/ml), poly-d-lysine (1 mg/ml), or collagen IV (2 mg/ml). Cells were incubated in media containing 3% serum and 100 ng/ml NGF for 6 h at 37 °C. Unattached cells were dislodged from the bottom of the well by three washes in PBS. Attached cells were fixed in glutaraldehyde and stained with 0.5% trypan blue. Quantitation of attached cells was performed by measuring absorbance at 590 nm of individual wells using a microtiter plate reader. Each value represents the mean and S.D. of determinations made on triplicate cultures performed in parallel and is expressed as a percentage of cell attachment on the indicated substrate relative to the cell attachment to poly-d-lysine. When PC12 cells are stimulated to differentiate with NGF, multiple proteins, including c-Crk II and paxillin, become tyrosine-phosphorylated within minutes after growth factor stimulation (4Hempstead B.L.

To identify the residues on paxillin and c-Crk II that are tyrosine-phosphorylated following NGF stimulation, Tyr to Phe point mutants of paxillin or c-Crk II were co-expressed with the NGF receptor TrkA in human epithelial kidney (HEK) 293T cells (Fig.1). Mutagenesis of the three putative high affinity Crk SH2 binding motifs in the N-terminal region of paxillin (Tyr31-Ser-Tyr-Pro, Tyr118-Ser-Phe-Pro, and Tyr182-Val-Ile-Pro (26Turner C.E. Miller J.T.

To map the sites of NGF-inducible paxillin phosphorylation in more detail, Tyr31, Tyr118, and Tyr182 residues were mutated singly or in combination and co-expressed with TrkA in 293T cells (Fig. 1 B). Paxillin mutants containing a Y31F substitution exhibited the most significant reduction (>70%) in Trk A-dependent phosphorylation after NGF treatment (Fig.1 B), whereas a Y113F,Y182F paxillin double mutant with an intact Tyr31 was less affected. To demonstrate that Tyr31 represents the major NGF-inducible Crk binding motif in paxillin, 293T cells co-expressing TrkA and c-Crk II with either FLAG-tagged paxillin, FLAG-tagged Y31F paxillin, or FLAG-tagged paxillin Y31F,Y118F,Y182F paxillin, were immunoprecipitated with anti-Crk antibodies (Fig. 1 C). As indicated, mutation of Tyr31 in paxillin significantly disrupted binding to c-Crk II, which was not further abrogated upon co-expression of Y31F,Y118F,Y182F paxillin with TrkA and c-Crk II (Fig. 1 C,inset). These results indicate that paxillin Tyr31 is the major site mediating c-Crk II interaction following NGF stimulation in vivo. Although Tyr222 is a major site for c-Crk II phosphorylation in vitro (17Feller S.M. Knudsen B. Hanafusa H. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2341-2351Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar), we sought to verify that the same tyrosine residue becomes tyrosine phosphorylated in vivo following TrkA activation. Toward this goal, wild-type c-Crk II or the point mutant of c-Crk II at Tyr222 (c-Crk Y222F) were coexpressed with TrkA in 293T cells. Using either an anti-phosphotyrosine (Tyr(P)) antisera or phospho-c-Crk-specific Tyr222 (pCrk) antisera, we found that wild-type c-Crk II, but not c-Crk Y222F, was phosphorylated upon NGF treatment (Fig.1 D, compare lanes 2 and 3 in respective panels). Together, these observations suggest that c-Crk II is phosphorylated exclusively on Tyr222 upon NGF stimulation in vivo. A recent study by Yano et al. (47Yano H. Cong F.. Birge R.B. Goff S.G. Chao M.V. J. Neurosci. Res. 2000; 59: 356-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) reports an interaction between c-Abl and TrkA in both PC12 cells and after cotransfection into 293T cells. Since c-Abl is known to interact with c-Crk II (17Feller S.M. Knudsen B. Hanafusa H. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2341-2351Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar) and with paxillin (23Lewis J.M. Schwartz M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14225-14230Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), it may be a likely candidate to mediate the NGF-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of these proteins. To assess the role of c-Abl in NGF-induced c-Crk II phosphorylation, c-Crk II and TrkA were coexpressed in fibroblasts derived form Abl (−/−) mice. Whereas c-Crk Tyr222 was readily phosphorylated in NGF-stimulated PC12 cells (39Ribon V. Saltiel A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7375-7380Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) or in 293T cells co-expressing c-Crk and TrkA (Fig. 1 D), NGF treatment of Abl (−/−) fibroblasts"

Trk receptors show more restricted ligand specificity, whereas all neurotrophins are able to bind to p75. One important function of p75 is the enhancement of nerve growth factor signaling via TrkA by increasing TrkA tyrosine autophosphorylation. Here, we have examined the importance of p75 on TrkB- and TrkC-mediated neurotrophin signaling in an MG87 fibroblast cell line stably transfected with either p75 and TrkB or p75 and TrkC, as well as in PC12 cells stably transfected with TrkB. In contrast to TrkA signaling, p75 had a negative effect on TrkB tyrosine autophosphorylation in response to its cognate neurotrophins, brain-derived neurotrophic factor and neurotrophin 4/5. On the other hand, p75 had no effect on TrkB or TrkC activation in neurotrophin 3 treatment. p75 did not effect extracellular signal-regulated kinase 2 tyrosine phosphorylation in response to brain-derived neurotrophic factor, neurotrophin 3, or neurotrophin 4/5. These results suggest that the observed reduction in TrkB tyrosine autophosphorylation caused by p75 does not influence Ras/mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling pathway in neurotrophin treatments.

The primary event in neurotrophin signaling is the specific activation of receptor tyrosine kinases of the Trk family.

NT-3 can activate also TrkA and TrkB, although at much higher neurotrophin concentrations than TrkC (reviewed in Refs. 15Barbacid M.

Neurobiol. 1994; 42: 347-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Neurotrophin binding to a specific Trk receptor causes receptor dimerization and the activation of the intrinsic tyrosine kinase domain of Trk. The initial substrate of the Trk kinase is the receptor itself, which results from tyrosine phosphorylation of the other subunit of Trk dimer (18Jing S. Tapley P. Barbacid M. Neuron. 1992; 9: 1067-1079Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar). A tyrosine-phosphorylated Trk recruits, phosphorylates, and activates a variety of adapter molecules that initiate downstream signaling cascades. Phosphotyrosine residues of activated Trk-receptors serve as specific recognition sites for effector molecules that contain a Src homology 2 domain. Among the proteins that interact with tyrosine-phosphorylated TrkA are the enzymes phospholipase Cγ (PLCγ) and phosphoinositol 3-kinase and the adapter protein Shc (19Obermeier A. Halfter H. Wiesmuller K.H. Jung G. Schlessinger J. Ullrich A. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 933-941Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 20Obermeier A. Lammers R. Wiesmuller K.H. Jung G. Schlessinger J. Ullrich A.

Neuron. 1994; 12: 691-705Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar). Each of these molecules activates distinct signaling pathways that may have different functions. The Ras/mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway initiated by Shc or PLCγ is involved in differentiation, while the phosphoinositol 3-kinase pathway is important for survival. It appears that in response to NGF, MAPKs like extracellular signal-regulated kinase 2 (ERK2), are cooperatively regulated by Shc and PLCγ in TrkA expressing cell lines (21Loeb D.M. Stephens R.M. Copeland T. Kaplan D.R. Greene L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8901-8910Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Stephens R.M. Loeb D.M. Copeland T.D. Pawson T. Greene L.A. Kaplan D.R. Neuron. 1994; 12: 691-705Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar). A major consequence of Ras activation in cells is threonine/tyrosine phosphorylation and activation of ERKs and Ras appears to be an indispensable element in NGF-promoted ERK activation. In NGF-treated PC12 cells, ERK becomes phosphorylated at a threonine and a tyrosine residue (23Payne D.M. Rossomando A.J. Martino P. Erickson A.K. Her J.H. Shabanowitz J. Hunt D.F. Weber M.J. Sturgill T.W. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 885-892Crossref PubMed Scopus (842) Google Scholar) leading to activation and translocation of ERK to the nucleus (24Chen R.H. Sarnecki C. Blenis J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 915-927Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the nucleus it phosphorylates its target molecules including several transcription factors, as well as another family of kinases, the ribosomal S6 kinases (summarized in Refs. 25Chen R.H. Tung R.

Zhong L.T. Yang J. Bitler C.M. Butcher L.L. Bredesen D.E. Science. 1993; 261: 345-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (749) Google Scholar). The p75 receptor has a number of distinct effects on Trk function. It alters the ligand binding specificity of Trks and enhances the proportion of TrkA receptors binding NGF with high affinity (13Kaplan D.R. Hempstead B.L. Martin-Zanca D. Chao M.V. Parada L.F. Science. 1991; 252: 554-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (1142) Google Scholar, 32Hempstead B.L. Martin-Zanca D. Kaplan D.R. Parada L.F. Chao M.V.

Co-expression of TrkA with an excess of p75 dramatically increases the rate of association of NGF with Trk, in effect increasing the binding affinity (34Mahadeo D. Kaplan L. Chao M.V. Hempstead B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6884-6891Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Another effect of p75 on TrkA is to enhance NGF-induced TrkA tyrosine kinase activity. Introduction of p75 into MAH sympathoprogenitor cells expressing TrkA increases NGF-stimulated TrkA autophosphorylation (35Verdi J.M. Anderson D.J. Neuron. 1994; 13: 1359-1372Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) and inhibition of NGF binding to p75 on PC12 cells reduces NGF-mediated TrkA autophosphorylation (36Barker P.A. Shooter E.M. Neuron. 1994; 13: 203-215Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar). p75 also has a number of Trk-independent effects on cell processes. These include retrograde transport of neurotrophins (37Curtis R. Adryan K.M. Stark J.L. Park J.S. Compton D.L. Weskamp G. Huber L.J. Chao M.V. Jaenisch R. Lee K.F. Lindsay R.M. DiStefano P.S.

Baeuerle P.A. Barde Y.A. Science. 1996; 272: 542-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (614) Google Scholar). In the presence of NGF, p75 can also either rescue cells from apoptosis or trigger the apoptotic cascade (31Rabizadeh S. Oh J. Zhong L.T. Yang J. Bitler C.M. Butcher L.L. Bredesen D.E. Science. 1993; 261: 345-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (749) Google Scholar, 41Casaccia-Bonnefil P. Carter B.D. Dobrowsky R.T. Chao M.V.

The latter may be due to elevated sphingomyelin hydrolysis leading to increased intracellular ceramide level (43Dobrowsky R.T. Werner M.H. Castellino A.M. Chao M.V. Hannun Y.A. Science. 1994; 265: 1596-1599Crossref PubMed Scopus (548) Google Scholar). Although the collaboration of p75 and TrkA has been characterized by several groups, the influence of p75 on TrkB and TrkC mediated signaling is more poorly understood. A truncated form of p75 lacking most of the cytoplasmic domain can collaborate with TrkA and TrkB, but not with TrkC, in a mouse fibroblast cell line expressing endogenous NGF and BDNF but not NT-3 (44Hantzopoulos P.A. Suri C. Glass D.J. Goldfarb M.P. Yancopoulos G.D. Neuron. 1994; 13: 187-201Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). p75 is also needed for neural differentiation in avian neural crest cultures expressing tyrosine kinase-deficient TrkC (45Hapner S.J. Boeshore K.L. Large T.H. Lefcort F. Dev. Biol. 1998; 201: 90-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Recently Bibel et al. (46Bibel M. Hoppe E. Barde Y.A. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 616-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar) using co-immunoprecipitation reported the physical interaction of p75 with all Trk receptors having a hemagglutinin epitope at their N-terminal end. They also found that the transient expression of p75 in a fibroblast cell line stably expressing TrkB reduced the TrkB autophosphorylation induced by NT-4/5 and NT-3, but not by BDNF. In light of these observations we have studied the function of p75 on TrkB and TrkC mediated signaling in a mouse fibroblast cell line stably expressing both p75 and TrkB or TrkC receptors as well as in PC12 cells stably transfected with TrkB and revealed a dual function of p75 in Trk-mediated neurotrophin signaling. The G418-resistant MG87 mouse fibroblast cell lines stably transfected with rat TrkB or TrkC cDNA were from Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.. These cell lines were stably transfected with 9 μg of rat p75 cDNA and 1 μg of histidinol selection plasmid, and selected for 10 days with 500 μg/ml G418 (Life Technologies, Inc.) and 2.5 mm histidinol (Sigma). To confirm the expression of p75 in the TrkB and TrkC lines, clones were lysed with RIPA buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% deoxycholic acid, 0.1% SDS) supplemented with protease inhibitors (CompleteTM, Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and subjected to a Western blot analysis. Blots were probed with rabbit anti-p75 (Promega) and rabbit anti-pan-Trk (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) antibodies. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibody (Sigma) was used as a secondary antibody. The expression of Trk and p75 was detected with the enhanced chemiluminescence reagent (DuPont) and by exposure to x-ray film (X-Omat AR, Kodak). Selected clones were tested by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (47Krüttgen A. Moller J.C. Heymach Jr., J.V. Shooter E.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9614-9619Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) and Northern blot analysis (data not shown) to exclude the endogenous expression of NGF, BDNF, NT-3, and NT-4/5, which could potentially interfere with the results. Cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Cellgro) containing 200 μg/ml G418 (Life Technologies, Inc.), 1 mm histidinol (Sigma), antibiotics (penicillin, 100 units/ml; streptomycin, 100 μg/ml, Life Technologies, Inc.), and 10% bovine calf serum (HyClone) in 5% CO2 at 37 °C. The PC12 cell line was stably transfected with TrkB cDNA as described above using the neomycin selection plasmid and maintained in the media noted above except that 6% of bovine calf serum, 6% of equine serum (HyClone), and 200 μg/ml G418 were used. 5 × 105 cells/well were plated in 6-well plates 1 day prior to neurotrophin treatment. Cells were starved in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with antibiotics and 0.1% of bovine serum albumin, fraction V, (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in the presence or absence of protein A purified REX antibody (20 μg/ml) (48Weskamp G. Reichardt L.F. Neuron. 1991; 6: 649-663Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar), a generous gift from Dr. Louis F. Reichardt) or NGF (1 μg/ml) for 30 min at 37 °C and treated with 0–100 ng/ml NGF (2.5 S, Harlan Bioproducts for Science, Inc.), BDNF, NT-3, or NT-4/5 (Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.) for 5 (Trk) or 7 (ERK2) min under the same conditions. Thereafter, cells were washed once with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, lysed with RIPA buffer supplemented with 1 mm sodium orthovanadate (Sigma) and protease inhibitors at 4 °C for 20 min, centrifuged, and the supernatants transferred to a fresh tube. Protein concentration was measured using bicinchoninic acid protein assay (Pierce) according to the manufacturer's instructions. For Trk phosphorylation assays, equal amounts of protein were immunoprecipitated with pan-Trk antibody and protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for 2 h at 4 °C. Immunocomplexes were washed three times with ice-cold RIPA buffer and resuspended in 30 μl of Laemmli sample buffer (49Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207479) Google Scholar). For ERK2 assays, equal amount of whole cell lysates were analyzed. After boiling for 5 min, proteins were separated by 7.5 (Trk) or 12% (ERK2) SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and analyzed by Western blotting. Blots were probed with mouse monoclonal anti-phosphotyrosine 4G10 antibody (Upstate Biotechnology) or mouse monoclonal anti-pERK antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), the secondary antibody being horseradish peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-mouse antibody (Pierce). The phosphorylation of Trk and ERK2 was detected with enhanced chemiluminescence reagents (NEN Life Science Products Inc.) and by exposure to x-ray film. The results were analyzed by densitometry. In fibroblast cell lines transfected with TrkB or TrkC cognate neurotrophins are known to induce the autophosphorylation of the Trk receptors with BDNF, NT-3, and NT-4/5 being preferred ligands for TrkB and NT-3 for TrkC (50Ip N.Y. Stitt T.N. Tapley P. Klein R. Glass D.J. Fandl J. Greene L.A. Barbacid M. Yancopoulos G.D. Neuron. 1993; 10: 137-149Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar). To determine which ligands are able to induce the tyrosine autophosphorylation of TrkB and TrkC in the stably transfected MG87 cell lines expressing either TrkB or TrkC, the lines were exposed to the four neurotrophins in the presence or absence of stably transfected p75. As expected, TrkB was phosphorylated in response to 100 ng/ml BDNF, NT-3, and NT-4/5 both with and without p75 expression (Fig. 1, a andb). In the presence of p75 the tyrosine phosphorylation level of TrkB was similar in response to all three neurotrophins but in the absence of p75 the phosphorylation level was lower in response to NT-3 compared with BDNF and NT-4/5. There are two potential explanations for this observation. Either p75 increases TrkB phosphorylation in response to NT-3 or p75 decreases TrkB phosphorylation in response to BDNF and NT-4/5. The data in the next section show that the latter explanation is correct. TrkC was uniquely phosphorylated in response to NT-3 only in the absence of p75 (Fig.1 C). Interestingly, a slight tyrosine phosphorylation of TrkC was observed in response to BDNF and NT-4/5 when p75 was coexpressed (Fig. 1 d). p75 has been reported to enhance TrkA mediated signaling by increasing the tyrosine autophosphorylation of TrkA in PC12 and MAH cells (35Verdi J.M. Anderson D.J. Neuron. 1994; 13: 1359-1372Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 36Barker P.A. Shooter E.M. Neuron. 1994; 13: 203-215Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar). Recently, p75 was observed to reduce the tyrosine autophosphorylation of TrkB in response to NT-3 and NT-4/5 in the A293 cell line stably transfected with TrkB and transiently with p75 (46Bibel M. Hoppe E. Barde Y.A. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 616-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar). We examined the influence of p75 on TrkB and TrkC mediated signaling with the Trk tyrosine phosphorylation assay in stably transfected MG87 cells. The neurotrophin binding to p75 was blocked with either the REX antibody (48Weskamp G. Reichardt L.F.

The positive influence of REX and nonspecific rabbit IgG antibodies on TrkB and TrkC phosphorylation was excluded using Western blotting (data not shown). The blocking of BDNF binding to p75 with the REX antibody caused an increased tyrosine autophosphorylation of TrkB over a wide range of BDNF concentrations suggesting an inhibitory effect of p75 on BDNF-induced TrkB mediated signaling (Fig.2 a). Since NGF is known to bind to p75 but not to TrkB or TrkC, and it was not able to induce TrkB or TrkC phosphorylation in the MG87 cell lines (Fig. 1) we used its p75 blocking capacity in BDNF treatment using a TrkB/p75 expressing cell line. Blocking p75 with NGF gave similar results as with the REX antibody blocking (Fig. 2 b). The blocking of NT-4/5 binding to p75 with NGF caused a reduced TrkB tyrosine phosphorylation, which was more prominent at lower neurotrophin concentrations but was not observed at high NT-4/5 concentration (100 ng/ml, Fig. 2 c). Interestingly, p75 had no influence on NT-3 induced TrkB tyrosine phosphorylation (Fig.2 d). In contrast to the TrkB expressing cell line, TrkC in the TrkC expressing line was significantly tyrosine autophosphorylated only in response to NT-3 (Fig. 1, c and d). Therefore, the influence of p75 on TrkC phosphorylation was examined using only NT-3 treatment. The inhibition of NT-3 binding to p75 with REX antibody did not have any influence on TrkC phosphorylation over a wide range of NT-3 concentrations (Fig. 3). Based on these observations we suggest that p75 does not play a role in TrkB or TrkC tyrosine autophosphorylation in response to NT-3. All three Trk receptors are expressed at the highest levels in the nervous system (14Lamballe F. Klein R. Barbacid M. Cell. 1991; 66: 967-979Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (920) Google Scholar, 51Klein R. Parada L.F. Coulier F. Barbacid M. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 3701-3709Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar, 52Martin-Zanca D. Barbacid M. Parada L.F. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 683-694Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar), whereas the expression of p75 is not so highly restricted (53Lomen-Hoerth C. Shooter E.M. J. Neurochem. 1995; 64: 1780-1789Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Therefore, we wanted to confirm our results in a more neuronal-like environment and for that purpose PC12 cells stably transfected with TrkB cDNA were used. TrkA was not phosphorylated in response to BDNF, NT-3, or NT-4/5 in PC12 cells (Ref. 47Krüttgen A. Moller J.C. Heymach Jr., J.V. Shooter E.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9614-9619Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar and data not shown). The phosphorylation status of TrkB was determined in the presence or absence of REX antibody in BDNF and NT-4/5 treatments. In both instances the blocking of neurotrophin binding to endogenously expressed p75 increased the autophosphorylation of TrkB (Fig.4), which is consistent with the results obtained from stably transfected MG87 fibroblast cell lines. We also tested the influence of p75 on TrkA phosphorylation mediated by NGF treatment. We were able to use the same PC12/TrkB cell line because PC12 cells express endogenous TrkA in addition to p75. As previously reported (36Barker P.A. Shooter E.M. Neuron. 1994; 13: 203-215Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar), the blocking of NGF binding to p75 with REX caused a reduced autophosphorylation of TrkA at relatively low concentrations of NGF (Fig. 4). To analyze downstream effects of p75 on TrkB and TrkC mediated signaling, we determined the tyrosine phosphorylation status of ERK2 in MG87 cells stably expressing both p75 and either TrkB or TrkC. Cells were treated with BDNF, NT-3, or NT-4/5 for 7 min and whole cell lysates were analyzed by Western blotting using phopho-ERK specific antibody. In the TrkB expressing cell line, BDNF and NT-4/5 were able to induce the phosphorylation of ERK2 to a similar extent (Fig.5 a). On the other hand, NT-3 although able to induce ERK2 phosphorylation, was less effective than BDNF and NT-4/5, even though the level of TrkB autophosphorylation is the same in the presence of p75 in response to all three neurotrophins (Fig. 1 b). More surprisingly, the addition of NGF to abolish the binding of other neurotrophins to p75 had no effect on the level of ERK2 phosphorylation induced by these three neurotrophins (Fig.5 a). This suggests that the observed reduction in TrkB autophosphorylation caused by p75 does not affect the Ras/MAPK signaling pathway. In the TrkC expressing cell line only NT-3 was able to increase the phosphorylation of ERK2 (Fig. 5 b). Again, the blocking of p75 had no influence on ERK2 phosphorylation in this cell line. The neurotrophins are distinguished by receptor-signaling systems of two different transmembrane proteins, the Trks and p75. Although at least some of the biological actions of a neurotrophin are mediated solely by its interaction with a Trk receptor p75 has been shown to collaborate with Trks to modify their activation. In this work we found that in MG87 fibroblasts p75 decreases the autophosphorylation of TrkB when induced by BDNF or NT-4/5 whereas p75 has no influence on NT-3-induced TrkB or TrkC activation. The collaboration of p75 with BDNF- or NT-4/5-induced TrkB and TrkC is, therefore, the opposite of what has been reported with NGF-induced TrkA. For example, coexpression of p75 with TrkA in a sympathoadrenal cell line (MAH) led to an 8-fold increase in tyrosine autophosphorylation of TrkA (35Verdi J.M. Anderson D.J. Neuron. 1994; 13: 1359-1372Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Consistent with this result is the blocking of NGF binding to p75 in rat primary sympathetic neurons (54Lachance C. Belliveau D.J. Barker P.A. Neuroscience. 1997; 81: 861-871Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) and in PC12 cells caused a reduced TrkA phosphorylation and also a decrease in the induction of the expression level of an immediate early gene, c-fos (36Barker P.A. Shooter E.M. Neuron. 1994; 13: 203-215Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar). Additionally, BDNF binding to p75 in PC12 cells was shown to result in a reduced TrkA signaling (55MacPhee I.J. Barker P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23547-23551Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). In contrast, transient expression of p75 in A293 cells stably transfected with TrkB has no effect on TrkB phosphorylation induced by BDNF, whereas NT-3 and NT-4/5 caused reduced TrkB phosphorylation (46Bibel M. Hoppe E. Barde Y.A. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 616-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar). Only the result with NT-4/5 agrees with the data we have obtained. Possible reasons behind these different results may be differences in the transfection status of p75 (transient versus stable) and/or in the cell lines used in the experiments. It should be noted that we were able to obtain the same results in PC12 cells that we obtained in MG87 cells, i.e. suppression of BDNF and NT-4/5-induced activation of TrkB by p75 and, as a control, p75 enhanced activation of TrkA by NGF at lower concentrations. In this MG87 fibroblast cell line NT-3 was the dominant ligand for TrkC and p75 had no effect on the activation of TrkC by NT-3. What was noticeable about the introduction of p75 into TrkC expressing cell line was a relaxation in the absolute specificity of TrkC for NT-3. In the presence of p75 both BDNF and NT-4/5 activated TrkC to a slight extent. The possibility of TrkB contamination in this cell line was excluded by Western blotting using a TrkB specific antibody (TRB (48Weskamp G. Reichardt L.F. Neuron. 1991; 6: 649-663Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar), data not shown). There are at least two general mechanisms whereby the two neurotrophin receptors can collaborate at the level of the receptors. In the first, p75 acts to bind and pass on a neurotrophin such as NGF to TrkA. If the transfer reaction is as rapid as the initial binding to p75 then the relatively slow on rate of NGF binding to TrkA is converted to a more rapid on rate, increasing the affinity of the p75·TrkA complex for NGF (34Mahadeo D. Kaplan L. Chao M.V. Hempstead B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6884-6891Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 36Barker P.A. Shooter E.M. Neuron. 1994; 13: 203-215Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar). The existence of a high molar ratio of p75 to TrkA argues in favor of this mechanism. In the second, changes in conformation in one or both receptors are thought to regulate the affinity of neurotrophin binding. A model based on the allosteric properties of the p75 receptor has been described in detail by Bothwell (56Bothwell M. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1995; 18: 223-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (765) Google Scholar). The finding that p75 interacts directly with a Trk (46Bibel M. Hoppe E. Barde Y.A. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 616-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar) suggests that the second model may be correct. Binding of a neurotrophin to p75 can now be thought of as directly affecting the conformation and, therefore, the affinity of a Trk receptor and this type of regulation could work to increase or decrease Trk affinity. Alternatively, or in addition, p75 and the Trks could indirectly interact to modify Trk phosphorylation through their signaling cascade. For example, elevation of ceramide, one of the signaling molecules activated by p75 (43Dobrowsky R.T. Werner M.H. Castellino A.M. Chao M.V. Hannun Y.A. Science. 1994; 265: 1596-1599Crossref PubMed Scopus (548) Google Scholar), has been shown to locally inhibit sympathetic axonal growth (57de Chaves E.I.P. Bussiere M. Vance D.E. Campenot R.B. Vance J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3028-3035Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) while McPhee and Barker (55MacPhee I.J. Barker P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23547-23551Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) have identified a ceramide activated serine-threonine kinase that could potentially down-regulate TrkA-mediated growth signals through TrkA phosphorylation. Interestingly, truncated p75 lacking most, but not all, of the intracellular domain of the receptor still has the ability to enhance both TrkA and TrkB phosphorylation in the MG87 cell line that expresses NGF and BDNF (44Hantzopoulos P.A. Suri C. Glass D.J. Goldfarb M.P. Yancopoulos G.D. Neuron. 1994; 13: 187-201Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). These results suggest that changes in receptor-binding site conformation that occur in the absence of the intracellular domain may be of primary importance. The truncated p75 had no effect on TrkC phosphorylation in the absence of exogenously added NT-3. Since these cells do not express endogenous NT-3, it is possible that the autocrine expression of a neurotrophin (NGF and BDNF in this instance) can affect p75/Trk interaction. The inability of p75 to affect exogenous NT-3 binding to TrkB and TrkC could arise for at least two reasons. First, NT-3 binding to TrkB, TrkC, and/or p75 causes no change in the conformation of the complex. If this is correct then TrkB and TrkC behave differently in this regard than TrkA. This difference has been noted before. There are differences in the neurotrophin-binding domains of the Trks and these differences distinguish TrkA from TrkB and TrkC but not the latter two from each other (58Ultsch M.H. Wiesmann C. Simmons L.C. Henrich J. Yang M. Reilly D. Bass S.H. de Vos A.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 290: 149-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Furthermore, Canossa et al. (59Canossa M. Twiss J.L. Verity A.N. Shooter E.M. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3369-3376Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) found that TrkB could transphosphorylate TrkC and vice versa, in COS cells but that TrkA did not take part in this phenomenon. Perhaps the failure of p75 to modify NT-3 binding to TrkB and TrkC fit into the same pattern. The other explanation for the lack of effect of p75 on NT-3-induced TrkB or TrkC phosphorylation is that there is no interaction between the signaling mechanisms of the receptors. Important aspects of the p75/Trk interaction are their physiological implications. The ability of p75 to enhance TrkA activation demonstrated in a number of in vitro experiments as described above is reflected in the properties of sensory neurons from p75 knock-out mice. There neurons show a reduced sensitivity to low concentrations of NGF compared with wild type mice (60Lee K.F. Davies A.M. Jaenisch R. Development. 1994; 120: 1027-1033Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It appears, therefore, that these neurons rely on the enhanced activation of TrkA by p75 to respond to the low levels of NGF present at certain stages of development. Although the binding of BDNF to p75 has been shown, for example, to inhibit sympathetic axonal growth in the pineal gland, this phenomenon is mediated directly through p75 signaling (61Kohn J. Aloyz R.S. Toma J.G. Haak-Frendscho M. Miller F.D. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 5393-5408Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 62Yamashita T. Tucker K.L. Barde Y-A. Neuron. 1999; 24: 585-593Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar) rather than by inhibition of TrkA signaling. As far as we are aware, potential systems in which the physiological consequences of the inhibition of TrkB and TrkC signaling through p75 have not been studied. As one attempt to determine if the reduced activation of TrkB and TrkC are due to changes in the signaling components of the receptors we analyzed the phosphorylation status of ERK2, one of the commonest signaling intermediates, after neurotrophin treatment. We found that its phosphorylation status was not affected by blocking neurotrophin binding to p75. Lachange et al. (54Lachance C. Belliveau D.J. Barker P.A. Neuroscience. 1997; 81: 861-871Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) also noted, in results consistent with these observations, that p75 reduced TrkA phosphorylation but had no effect on NGF-mediated survival in sympathetic neurons. The phosphorylation of tyrosine 490 (Tyr490) in TrkA activates the Ras/MAPK pathways by forming a recognition site for the Shc adaptor protein (20Obermeier A. Lammers R. Wiesmuller K.H. Jung G. Schlessinger J. Ullrich A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22963Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Stephens R.M. Loeb D.M. Copeland T.D. Pawson T. Greene L.A. Kaplan D.R. Neuron. 1994; 12: 691-705Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar). In addition to this, the binding of PLCγ to the activated TrkA at Tyr785 is sufficient to induce ERK activity in response to NGF (22Stephens R.M. Loeb D.M. Copeland T.D. Pawson T. Greene L.A. Kaplan D.R. Neuron. 1994; 12: 691-705Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar). Our observation that the ERK2 phosphorylation level is similar despite the blocking of the neurotrophin binding to p75 suggests that, at least, Shc or PLCγ is activated in response to BDNF and NT-4/5 even though the total tyrosine phosphorylation of TrkB is reduced by p75. Most likely, the reduced TrkB tyrosine phosphorylation does not influence the Ras/MAPK signaling pathway but uses another cascade in the signal transduction. Also the invariable phosphorylation status of TrkB, TrkC, and ERK2 after NT-3 treatment suggest that under these circumstances either p75 does not play a role in NT-3-mediated Trk activation or that its influence is mediated by a Trk tyrosine phosphorylation independent pathway. It appears that the role of p75 in neurotrophin activation is far more complex than was initially assumed. The presence of p75 can act in a positive (binding of NGF to TrkA) or negative (binding of BDNF or NT-4/5 to TrkB) fashion or have no effect at all (binding of NT-3 to TrkB or TrkC) in Trk mediated activation. How p75 affects the downstream signaling from the Trks is part of the puzzle that is actively under investigation. We thank Dr. Jose M. Cosgaya for critical reading of the manuscript.

https://openalex.org/W2159106090,"We have investigated the structural basis for the differential catalytic function of the yeast Gcn5p-containing histone acetyltransferase (HAT) A2 complex and free recombinant yeast Gcn5p (rGcn5p). HAT A2 is shown to be a unique complex that contains Gcn5p, Ada2p, and Ada3p, but not proteins specific to other related HAT A complexes, e.g. ADA, SAGA. Nevertheless, HAT A2 produces the same unique polyacetylation pattern of nucleosomal substrates reported previously for ADA and SAGA, demonstrating that proteins specific to the ADA and SAGA complexes do not influence the enzymatic activity of Gcn5p within the HAT A2 complex. To investigate the role of substrate interactions in the differential behavior of free and complexed Gcn5p, sucrose density gradient centrifugation was used to characterize the binding of HAT A2 and free rGcn5p to intact and trypsinized nucleosomal arrays, H3/H4 tetramer arrays, and nucleosome core particles. We find that HAT A2 forms stable complexes with all nucleosomal substrates tested. In distinct contrast, rGcn5p does not interact stably with nucleosomal arrays, despite being able to specifically monoacetylate the H3 N terminus of nucleosomal substrates. Our data suggest that the ability of the HAT A2 complex to bind stably to nucleosomal arrays is functionally related to both local and global acetylation by the complexed and free forms of Gcn5p."

Although more than a dozen related coreceptor molecules have been shown by one or more laboratories to function in the fusion or entry of at least one virus isolate, it is now well recognized that the principal HIV-1 coreceptors remain the initially discovered CXC chemokine receptor CXCR4 and the CC-chemokine receptor CCR5 (6Broder C.C.

The viral entry process is believed to occur through a receptor-mediated activation of Env's membrane fusogenic activity. The most favored model for the mechanism underlying this activation process involves at least two stages of receptor-induced conformational alterations in Env; the first is through CD4 binding, leading to exposure of the coreceptor binding site, followed by coreceptor binding and a further presumed conformational change resulting in the exposure and insertion of the hydrophobic fusion peptide domain of the gp41 NH2 terminus into the receptor-bearing target cell (reviewed in detail in Refs. 7Dimitrov D.S.

Defining the elements of the coreceptor molecules involved in Env interaction and the membrane fusion process remains an area of critical importance for our complete understanding of the virus entry mechanism. To date, a variety of studies, employing the use of both Env and coreceptor genetic chimeras and mutations, have provided an extensive array of important structural information on several coreceptors as well as on Env determinants for coreceptor use, which have been reviewed in detail (3Moore J.P. Trkola A. Dragic T. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1997; 9: 551-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar, 7Dimitrov D.S. Broder C.C. HIV and Membrane Receptors.

Immunol. 1998; 10: 237-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Although not all in complete agreement, these studies have clearly indicated that multiple extracellular domains of the coreceptors are required for supporting the Env-mediated fusion process, involving cooperativity between particular elements of the NH2-terminal domain and one or more of the three extracellular loops. We recently studied a large battery of CXCR4 mutants, primarily generated using an alanine-scanning mutagenesis strategy (12Chabot D.J. Zhang P.F. Quinnan G.V. Broder C.C. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 6598-6609Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Those results indicated that negatively charged glutamic acid residues in the NH2 terminus (Glu14, Glu15, and Glu32) and the aspartic acid residue (Asp97) in extracellular loop 1 (ecl-1) were important for CXCR4 function as a coreceptor for X4 HIV-1 clade B isolates. It was speculated that the role of these negatively charged residues was related to their electrostatic interactions with positively charged Env residues in the V3 loop region of the previously classified syncytium-inducing (X4) Envs (13De Jong J.J. De Ronde A. Keulen W. Tersmette M. Goudsmit J. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 6777-6780Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14Fouchier R.A. Groenink M. Kootstra N.A. Tersmette M. Huisman H.G. Miedema F. Schuitemaker H. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 3183-3187Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, several point mutations, N11A and R30A in the NH2 terminus and N176A, D187A, and D193A in ecl-2, were noted to enhance the ability of CXCR4 to serve as a coreceptor for otherwise CCR5-dependent R5 HIV-1 isolates, while retaining full function for X4 and R5X4 isolates. The most potent of these mutations was an alanine substitution for the aspartic acid residue at position 187 in ecl-2, which was also identified in another study (15Wang Z. Berson J.F. Zhang T. Cen Y.-H. Sun Y. Sharron M. Lu Z. Peiper S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15007-15015Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Additional complexity to the Env-receptor system comes from the assessment of Env regions involved in coreceptor interaction and goes beyond solely a notion of electrostatic interactions between the V3 loop and a coreceptor (recently reviewed in Refs. 8Berger E.A. Murphy P.M. Farber J.M. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1999; 17: 657-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (1882) Google Scholar and 9Hoffman T.L. Doms R.W. Mol. Membr. Biol. 1999; 16: 57-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). More recently, we have discovered that removal of the N-linked glycosylation modifications of the CXCR4 molecule also permit the receptor to serve as a potential coreceptor for otherwise CCR5-dependent HIV-1 Envs (16Chabot D.J. Chen H. Dimitrov D.S. Broder C.C. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 4404-4413Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Together these findings support the hypothesis that there are conserved elements important for coreceptor activity between the CXCR4 and CCR5 molecules. To further investigate the possible existence of important conserved elements in coreceptor activity between the CXCR4 and CCR5 molecules, we focused on the CXCR4-D187A mutant, and here we demonstrate that this mutation also permits a variety of HIV-1 R5 primary isolate Envs, including those of other genetic subtypes, to employ it as a functional coreceptor. Further, we examined the corresponding region of CCR5 and demonstrate that the substitution of the serine residue in the homologous ecl-2 position of CCR5, with aspartic acid, dramatically and specifically impairs CCR5 coreceptor activity for a variety of R5 and R5X4 isolates across several HIV-1 clades. These results highlight a homologous and critical region in ecl-2, of both the CXCR4 and CCR5 major coreceptor molecules, for their respective coreceptor activities. On the one hand, charge elimination can expand CXCR4 coreceptor activity, while a similar charge introduction can destroy CCR5 coreceptor function, depending on the particular isolate Env. The present findings, taken together with other observations, soundly support the hypothesis that conserved extracellular domains, common to both CXCR4 and CCR5 involved in their coreceptor activities exist, and this information will aid the efforts aimed at defining the Env-coreceptor interactions and virus entry process in greater detail.

HeLa cell monolayers were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Quality Biologicals, Gaithersburg, MD) supplemented with 10% bovine calf serum, 2 mml-glutamine, and antibiotics (DMEM-10). U373-MG cell monolayers were maintained in the same way, except 15% bovine calf serum was used. The U373-MG-CD4+ cell monolayers were also supplemented with 200 μg of G418 (Calbiochem)/ml. Cell lines expressing mutant or wild-type CCR5 molecules were prepared by N-[1-(2,3-dioleoyloxy)propyl]-N,N,N-trimethylammonium methyl-sulfate (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) transfection of U373-MG-CD4+ cells with pCDNA3.1 Hygro+ (Invitrogen, Carlsbad CA) containing coreceptor gene linked to T7 promoter. At 48 h post-transfection, medium was replaced with DMEM-15 containing 200 μg/ml G418 and 200 μg/ml hygromycin B (Life Technologies, Inc.). Medium was changed three times per week, and surviving cells were cloned and expanded in DMEM-15 containing 200 μg/ml G418 and 100 μg/ml hygromycin B. For Env expression, we employed a battery of plasmids and recombinant vaccinia viruses encoding the Env genes from several R5, X4, and R5X4 HIV-1 isolates. The following recombinant vaccinia viruses expressing gp160 from different HIV-1 isolates were used: vCB-28 (JR-FL), vCB-32 (SF162), vCB-34 (SF2), vCB-39 (ADA), vCB-41 (LAV), vCB-43 (Ba-L), vCB-52 (CM235), vCB-53 (CM243) (18Broder C.C. Berger E.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9004-9008Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar), and vDC-1 (89.6) (12Chabot D.J. Zhang P.F. Quinnan G.V. Broder C.C. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 6598-6609Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The following recombinant vaccinia viruses expressing gp160 from different SIV isolates were used: vCB-74 (mac239), vCB-75 (mac316), and vCB-76 (mac316mut) (19Edinger A.L. Amedee A. Miller K. Doranz B.J. Endres M. Sharron M. Samson M. Lu Z.H. Clements J.E. Murphey-Corb M. Peiper S.C. Parmentier M. Broder C.C. Doms R.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4005-4010Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Purified vaccinia virus stocks were used at a multiplicity of infection of 10 plaque-forming units/cell. Plasmids encoding gp160 from primary isolates linked to T7 promoter were obtained from the National Institutes of Health AIDS Research and Reagent Program (Rockville, MD) and include 93BR019.10, 93019.4, 92UG975.10, 93BR029.2, 92TH022–4, MA301965–26, 92BR025–9, HA301593.1, 92TH014–12, 92BR020–4, 91US005.11, 92UG037.8, and 92RW020.5. For CD4 expression, we used recombinant vaccinia virus vCB-3 (20Broder C.C. Dimitrov D.S. Blumenthal R. Berger E.A. Virology. 1993; 193: 483-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Bacteriophage T7 RNA polymerase was produced by infection with vTF1–1 (P11 natural late vaccinia virus promoter) (21Alexander W.A. Moss B. Fuerst T.R. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 2934-2942Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The Escherichia coli lacZ gene linked to the T7 promoter was introduced into cells by infection with vaccinia virus recombinant vCB21R-LacZ, which was described previously (22Alkhatib G. Broder C.C. Berger E.A. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 5487-5494Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For coreceptor expression, we employed recombinant vaccinia virus or one of two alternative plasmid expression protocols. For cell fusion assays, we either infected cells with vaccinia virus encoding chemokine receptor linked to the vaccinia virus p7.5 early-late promoter or we transfected cell monolayers with plasmids containing coreceptor genes linked to a strong synthetic vaccinia virus early-late promoter (pSC59) (23Chakrabarti S. Sisler J.R. Moss B. BioTechniques. 1997; 23: 1094-1097Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar) followed by infection 2 h later with the Western Reserve wild-type strain of vaccinia virus, and transfection of monolayers was performed with N-[1-(2,3-dioleoyloxy)propyl]-N,N,N-trimethylammonium methyl-sulfate (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). For virus infection assays, cells were transfected with coreceptor genes linked to the cytomegalovirus promoter in pCDNA3 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), and transfection was performed by the DEAE-dextran procedure, as described below. CCR5 and CXCR4 mutations were made by using a QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions. Two mutagenic polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis-purified oligonucleotides were used per mutation. The identities of all mutant constructs were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Wild-type and mutant CXCR4 expression levels were determined by fluorescent antibody staining using the conformation-dependent 12G5 (24Strizki J.M. Turner J.D. Collman R.G. Hoxie J. Gonzalez-Scarano F. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 5678-5683Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) or the conformation-independent 4G10 2C. C. Broder and E. A. Berger, unpublished observations. mouse monoclonal antibodies (mAbs). Target cells were transfected as described above, infected with vCB-3 for 2 h at 37 °C, and incubated overnight at 31 °C. Following overnight incubation, cells were removed from plates with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 10 mm EDTA, and cells (0.5–1.0 × 106) were washed twice with PBS and once with PBS containing 2.5% goat serum on ice. Cells were stained in 100 μl of PBS containing 2.5% goat serum and 2 μg/100 μl 12G5 or 4G10 mAb to CXCR4 for 1 h on ice. Wild-type and mutant CCR5 expression levels were determined by fluorescent antibody staining using the conformation-dependent 2D7 (25Wu L. LaRosa G. Kassam N. Gordon C.J. Heath H. Ruffing N. Chen H.

Mackay C.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1925-1930Crossref PubMed Scopus (946) Google Scholar) mAbs. Cells were stained in 100 μl of PBS containing 2.5% goat serum and 2 μg of 2D7 or 5C7 mAb to CCR5/100 μl for 1 h on ice. Cells were then washed twice with PBS and once with PBS containing 2.5% goat serum. After specific antibody staining, cells were washed and stained in 100 μl of PBS containing 2.5% goat serum and 10 μl of phycoerythrin-labeled goat anti-mouse immunoglobulin G (IgG) for 45 min, washed three times with PBS, and fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde in PBS. Fluorescence was measured with an EPIC XL flow cytometer (Coulter, Miami, FL). Fusion between Env-expressing and receptor-expressing cells was measured using a reporter gene assay in which the cytoplasm of one cell population contained vaccinia virus-encoded T7 RNA polymerase and the cytoplasm of the other contained the E. coli lacZ gene linked to the T7 promoter; β-galactosidase is synthesized in fused cells (27Nussbaum O. Broder C.C. Berger E.A. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 5411-5422Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cell fusion reactions were conducted with the various indicated cell mixtures in 96-well plate format at 37 °C. Typically, the ratio of CD4-expressing to Env-expressing cells was 1:1 (2 × 105 total cells/well, 0.2-ml total volume). Cytosine arabinoside (40 μg/ml) was added to the fusion reaction mixture to reduce nonspecific β-galactosidase production (28Berger E.A. Nussbaum O. Broder C.C. Karn J. HIV: a Practical Approach. 2. Oxford University Press, Cambridge1995: 123-145Google Scholar). For quantitative analyses, Nonidet P-40 was added (0.5% final concentration) at 3 h, and aliquots of the lysates were assayed for β-galactosidase at ambient temperature with the substrate chlorophenol red-d-galactopyranoside (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Fusion results were calculated and expressed as rates of β-galactosidase activity (change in optical density at 570 nm/min × 1000) (27Nussbaum O. Broder C.C. Berger E.A. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 5411-5422Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and all fusion reactions and β-galactosidase quantifications were performed in duplicate. U373-MG-CD4+ target cells were prepared in 48-well plates and transfected with the desired coreceptor-encoding plasmid by the DEAE-dextran method. Briefly, 0.2 μg of DNA mixed in 110 μl of DMEM-2.5 with 100 μmchloroquine diphosphate, and 1.1 μl of DEAE-dextran stock (10 mg/ml) was added to each well of semiconfluent cells. After 4 h, medium was replaced with 10% Me2SO/PBS for 2 min. Monolayers were then washed with PBS and incubated overnight in DMEM-15. Viral infection assays were performed with a luciferase reporter HIV-1 Env pseudotyping system (29Connor R.I. Chen B.K. Choe S. Landau N.R. Virology. 1995; 206: 935-944Crossref PubMed Scopus (1093) Google Scholar). Viral stocks were prepared as described previously by transfecting 293T cells with plasmids encoding the luciferase virus backbone (pNL-Luc-ER) and Env from HIV strain 89.6 (30Collman R. Balliet J.W.

Retroviruses. 1998; 14: 939-949Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), or SF2 (34Sanchez-Pescador R. Power M.D. Barr P.J. Steimer K.S. Stempien M.M. Brown-Shimer S.L. Gee W.W. Renard A. Randolph A. Levy J.A. Dina D. Luciw P.A. Science. 1985; 227: 484-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar). The resulting supernatant was clarified by centrifugation for 10 min at 2000 rpm in a Sorvall RT-7 centrifuge (RTH-750 rotor) and stored at 4 °C. Monolayers were infected with 100 μl of virus containing 8 μg/ml DEAE-dextran. After 2 h, 0.5 ml of DMEM-15 was added to each well. Cells were lysed at 72 h postinfection by resuspension in 105 μl of cell lysis buffer (Promega, Madison, WI), and 50 μl of the resulting lysate was assayed for luciferase activity, using luciferase substrate (Promega). Previously, we demonstrated that several alanine substitution point mutations in CXCR4 (N11A, R30A, D187A, D193A) either alone or in combination could allow CXCR4 to serve as a functional coreceptor for prototypic R5 HIV-1 clade B Envs while retaining its coreceptor activity for X4 and R5X4 HIV-1 clade B Envs (12Chabot D.J. Zhang P.F. Quinnan G.V. Broder C.C. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 6598-6609Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Combining some of these single mutations together resulted in greater than additive effects on expanding CXCR4 coreceptor activity. The single most potent coreceptor-expanding mutation was the elimination of the negatively charged aspartic acid residue at position 187 (Asp187) in ecl-2. We speculated that the removal of this key negatively charged residue in ecl-2 reduced the domain's net negative charge and allowed for an appropriate region of an R5 Env, perhaps including the V3 loop, to properly associate with the altered coreceptor's extracellular surface, which is otherwise repelled, and results in Env-mediated fusion. Similar results concerning the Asp187 residue were also reported by Wang et al.(15Wang Z. Berson J.F. Zhang T. Cen Y.-H. Sun Y. Sharron M. Lu Z. Peiper S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15007-15015Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The expansion of CXCR4's coreceptor activity, to include its recognition and use by prototypic clade B R5 HIV-1 isolate Envs, as a result of just a single charge-deleting point mutation was somewhat surprising. This observation strongly suggested the presence of conserved elements, between the principal coreceptors CXCR4 and CCR5, important for Env interaction and their coreceptor activity. To investigate this observation further and determine the breath of the mutation's effect and whether there is a similar important site in CCR5, we performed a series of additional experiments examining primary isolate HIV-1 Envs and additional CCR5 mutants. We employed the well characterized β-galactosidase reporter gene assay for HIV-1 Env-mediated cell fusion in our analysis (18Broder C.C. Berger E.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9004-9008Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 27Nussbaum O. Broder C.C. Berger E.A. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 5411-5422Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 35Feng Y. Broder C.C. Kennedy P.E. Berger E.A. Science. 1996; 272: 872-877Crossref PubMed Scopus (3636) Google Scholar). In these experiments, plasmids encoding wild-type CXCR4 or CCR5 and the CXCR4-D187A mutant under control of a vaccinia virus promoter were transfected into U373-MG cells, and CD4 was supplied by infection with a recombinant vaccinia virus. Shown in Fig.1 A is the coreceptor activity of CXCR4-D187A, in comparison with wild-type CXCR4 and CCR5, for a variety of prototypic CCR5-dependent R5 HIV-1 clade B isolate Envs. The surface-expressed level of the CXCR4-D187A mutant was equivalent to that of wild-type CXCR4 as determined by either 12G5 and 4G10 mAb immunostaining and flow cytometry (Ref. 12Chabot D.J. Zhang P.F. Quinnan G.V. Broder C.C. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 6598-6609Crossref PubMed Google Scholar and data not shown). The level of coreceptor activity of CXCR4-D187A, for these otherwise CCR5-dependent Envs, was significant and ranged from 36 to 69% of the fusion signals obtained with wild-type CCR5 in the same experiment (Fig. 1 A). The actual rate of reporter gene activity is shown along with the level of activity obtained with a mock-transfected (vector) cell population expressing CD4 without any coreceptor for comparison. In other experiments, the CXCR4-D187A molecule could also serve as a functional coreceptor in virus entry assays using the HIV-1 luciferase reporter gene pseudotyping system (29Connor R.I. Chen B.K. Choe S. Landau N.R. Virology. 1995; 206: 935-944Crossref PubMed Scopus (1093) Google Scholar) with the R5 Envs JR-FL, ADA, Ba-L, and SF162 (12Chabot D.J. Zhang P.F. Quinnan G.V. Broder C.C. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 6598-6609Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Because this single amino acid change could so dramatically expand CXCR4's coreceptor activity for prototypic R5 clade B Envs, we examined additional R5 HIV-1 primary isolate Envs including those of alternate genetic subtypes (clades) to determine whether they could employ it as a functional coreceptor as well. A panel of plasmid-encoded primary isolate Envs were employed in the cell fusion assay and screened for their ability to utilize the CXCR4-D187A mutant in comparison with wild-type CXCR4 and CCR5. Two primary clade B isolates (91US005.11 and 92BR020.4), a clade F/B mosaic (93BR019.10-all gp120 F), and a clade A (92RW020.5) R5 Env were clearly quite capable of employing the CXCR4-D187A mutant coreceptor, having Env fusion activities nearly equivalent to the level of activity obtained with target cells expressing wild-type CCR5 (Fig.1 B). The X4 Env LAV was also included as a control in this experiment as in Fig. 1 A, to confirm that wild-type CXCR4 and the D187A mutant were equivalent in expression and function (data not shown). The overall reporter gene signals were lower in this experiment in comparison with Fig. 1 A because both the coreceptor genes and the Env genes (most driven by a T7 promoter system) were transfected as plasmids in this assay (Fig.1 B). Although not universally accepted as a functional coreceptor for all R5 Envs examined, the CXCR4-D187A mutant clearly supported Env-mediated fusion for additional isolates other than those exclusively from clade B."
https://openalex.org/W2025574928,"Expression of inflammatory nitric oxide synthase (NOS2) is mediated by transcription factor NFκB. By using the specific proteasome inhibitor lactacystin to examine IκB degradation, we observed a paradoxical increase in lipopolysaccharide- and cytokine-dependent NOS2 expression at low concentrations or when lactacystin was added subsequent to cytokines. Lactacystin reduced the initial accumulation of NOS2 mRNA but reduced its subsequent decrease. Lactacystin increased NOS2 promoter activation after 24 h, but not after 4 h, and similarly prevented initial NFκB activation and at later times caused NFκB reactivation. Lactacystin reduced initial degradation of IκB-α and IκB-β, however, at later times selectively increased IκB-β, which was predominantly non-phosphorylated. Expression of full-length rat IκB-β, but not a carboxyl-terminal truncated form, inhibited NOS2 induction and potentiation by lactacystin. Lactacystin increased IκB-β expression in the absence of NOS2 inducers, as well as expression of heat shock protein 70, and the heat shock response due to hyperthermia increased IκB-β expression. These results suggest that IκB-β contributes to persistent NFκB activation and NOS2 expression in glial cells, that IκB-β is a stress protein inducible by hyperthermia or proteasome inhibitors, and that delayed addition of proteasome inhibitors can have stimulatory rather than inhibitory actions.

NFκB is a dimeric complex consisting of two members of the Rel protein family including p50, p52, Rel A (p65), Rel B, and the oncogene c-rel. NFκB is maintained in the cytoplasm by association with members of the IκB protein family (36Beg A.A. Baldwin Jr., A.S. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 2064-2070Crossref PubMed Scopus (738) Google Scholar) whose ankyrin repeat domains bind to, and mask, nuclear localization sites present in NFκB subunits. Inflammatory stimulation by cytokines or lipopolysaccharides (LPS) results in activation of IK kinases, leading to serine phosphorylation of IκBs at their amino termini (28Alkalay I. Yaron A. Hatzubai A. Orian A. Ciechanover A. Ben-Neriah Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10599-10603Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar). Phosphorylated IκBs are ubiquinated at amino-terminal lysine residues (31Scherer D.C. Brockman J.A. Chen Z. Maniatis T. Ballard D.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 11259-11263Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar) which targets then for degradation by the 26 S proteasome (28Alkalay I. Yaron A. Hatzubai A. Orian A. Ciechanover A. Ben-Neriah Y.

EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2876-2883Crossref PubMed Scopus (933) Google Scholar). This allows the rapid translocation of NFκB to the nucleus, where it binds to κB DNA motifs present in a variety of promoter regions including that of NOS2 (26Xie Q.W. Whisnant R. Nathan C. J. Exp. Med. 1993; 177: 1779-1784Crossref PubMed Scopus (1030) Google Scholar) as well as of IκB−α (32Simeonidis S. Stauber D. Chen G.Y. Hendrickson W.A. Thanos D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 49-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). The de novo transcription of IκB−α results in a rapid increase of IκB−α protein expression, which can reassociate with active NFκB (both in the cytoplasm as well as in the nucleus) thus reducing ongoing NFκB activity. The expression patterns and phosphorylation kinetics of IκB proteins are therefore key to the overall level of NFκB activation. However, the characterization of IκB proteins in astrocytes is limited (33Feinstein D.L. J. Neurochem. 1998; 70: 1484-1496Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 34Kemler I. Fontana A.

Neuropharmacology. 1999; 38: 1325-1333Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Recently, the cloning of the second major member of the IκB family, IκB−β, has allowed molecular characterization of the interaction of this isoform with NFκB (29Thompson J.E. Phillips R.J. ErdjumentBromage H. Tempst P. Ghosh S. Cell. 1995; 80: 573-582Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (693) Google Scholar). In contrast to IκB−α, the IκB−β gene is not induced upon NFκB activation, presumably due to lack of κB-binding sites in its promoter region (29Thompson J.E. Phillips R.J. ErdjumentBromage H. Tempst P. Ghosh S. Cell. 1995; 80: 573-582Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (693) Google Scholar). Instead, alternative signals, not yet well characterized, lead to increased IκB−β transcription and de novo expression of hypophosphorylated IκB−β. Non-phosphorylated IκB−β can bind to NFκB but does not mask its nuclear localization site nor transcription activation domain. NFκB·IκB−β complexes can enter the nucleus and exhibit transcriptional activity, and it has been proposed that this mechanism is responsible for persistent NFκB activation (37Attar R.M. Macdonald-Bravo H. Raventos-Suarez C. Durham S.K. Bravo R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 477-487Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 38DeLuca C. Petropoulos L. Zmeureanu D. Hiscott J. J. Biol.

Chem. 1996; 271: 16317-16322Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of IκB−β at its carboxyl-terminal PEST domain (41Chu Z.L. McKinsey T.A. Liu L. Qi X. Ballard D.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5974-5984Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) converts IκB−β to an inhibitory molecule similar in properties to IκB−α. Thus, the phosphorylation state of IκB−β dictates its role as an inhibitoryversus a stimulatory molecule. It is not yet clear what maintains the hypophosphorylated state of newly made IκB−β during persistent activation, but it has been suggested that LPS and IL-1β induce an IκB−β-specific phosphatase (38DeLuca C. Petropoulos L. Zmeureanu D. Hiscott J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13010-13016Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). We have previously used a nonspecific serine protease inhibitor (TPCK) of the 26 S proteasome, as well as the more selective peptide aldehyde inhibitor benzyloxycarbonyl-Ile-Glu (O-t−butyl)−Ala-leucinal (ZIE), to investigate NFκB activation in astrocytes and C6 cells (22Feinstein D.L. Galea E. Reis D.J. Nitric Oxide. 1997; 1: 167-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). ZIE inhibited NOS2 induction only when present during the initial times of incubation with NOS2 inducers, whereas TPCK inhibited NOS2 expression regardless of when it was added to cells, pointing to effects of TPCK on events other than initial NFκB activation. To further examine the role of the NFκB·IκB system in induction of glial NOS2 expression, we have now used lactacystin (43Mellgren R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29899-29903Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 44Fenteany G. Schreiber S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8545-8548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar), a recently identified microbial product that is a specific inhibitor of the 26 S proteasome. In contrast to peptide aldehyde inhibitors such as ZIE, lactacystin shows no inhibition of any other proteases tested (including thrombin, cathepsin B, calpains I and II, trypsin, chymotrypsin, and papain) (44Fenteany G. Schreiber S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8545-8548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). In the present study, we demonstrate that NOS2 expression in brain glial cells is blocked by lactacystin, validating previous reports that proteasome activity is requisite for NOS2 induction. Surprisingly, we observed that low doses of lactacystin, or addition of high doses of lactacystin at times after the initial stimulation with NOS2 inducers, caused potentiation rather than inhibition of NOS2 expression. The increased NOS2 expression was accompanied by an enhanced re-expression of IκB−β, but not IκB−α. Since lactacystin induces a heat shock response (HSR) in these cells (Ref. 45Kim D. Kim S.H. Li G.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 254: 264-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, and Fig. 8 below), we tested the possibility that IκB−β, as previously shown for IκB−α (46Wong H.R. Ryan M. Wispe J.R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 231: 257-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 47Wong H.R. Ryan M.A. Menendez I.Y. Wispe J.R.

Surg. 1997; 132: 1283-1287Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), is a stress protein. Our results suggest that sustained NFκB activation, mediated by increases in IκB-β expression, is important for glial cell NOS2 expression, which may be potentiated by proteasome inhibitors due to induction of a HSR. Cell culture reagents (DMEM, antibiotics, LPS (Salmonella typhimurium),N-p-tosyl-l-phenylalanine chloromethyl ketone (TPCK), and protease inhibitors (leupeptin, aprotinin, and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF)) were from Sigma. ZIE was from Peninsula Laboratories (Belmont, CA). Fetal calf serum (FCS) was from Atlanta Biological Co. (Norcross, GA). Recombinant rat IFN, G418 (geneticin), and synthetic oligonucleotides were from Life Technologies, Inc. Human recombinant IL-1β (4 × 106unit/mg) was obtained from the National Institutes of Health AIDs reagents program. Polyclonal antibodies directed against IκB−α (SC-371, which recognizes the carboxyl terminus of IκB-α) and IκB−β (SC-945, which recognizes the carboxyl terminus of the 43-kDa IκB-β isoform) were used at 1:1,500 dilution and were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Monoclonal antibody directed against HSP70 (SPA-810) was used at 1:1,000 dilution and was fromStressGen Biotechnologies Corp. (Victoria, Canada). Peroxidase-conjugated goat secondary antibodies were from Vector Laboratories (Burlingame, CA). Enhanced chemiluminescence reagents were from Pierce. Taq polymerase and cDNA synthesis reagents were from Promega (Madison, WI). Lactacystin was purchased from Dr. E. J. Corey (Harvard University). C6 glioma and human U172 astrocytoma cells were grown in DMEM containing 10% FCS and antibiotics (penicillin and streptomycin). Cells were passaged once a week into 6- or 96-well plates and used after 3–4 days at which point they were 90–95% confluent. Primary astrocytes were from cerebral cortices of postnatal day 1 Harlan Sprague-Dawley rats prepared in 96-well plates as described previously (13Galea E. Feinstein D.L. Reis D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10945-10949Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar). Media were changed every 3 days. After 2 weeks growth in complete media (DMEM with 10% FCS) the cultures consisted of 95–98% astrocytes and 2–3% microglia. NOS2 expression was induced in C6 cells by overnight incubation in DMEM containing 1% FCS and NOS2 inducers as indicated (final concentrations of inducers were as follows: LPS, 1 μg/ml; IL-1β, 2 ng/ml; IFN 20 units/ml). NOS2 was induced in primary astrocyte cultures in DMEM containing 1% FCS and LPS. After 24 h, NOS2 induction was assessed indirectly by the accumulation of nitrite in the culture media. An aliquot of media (100 μl) was mixed with 50 μl of Griess reagent (48Green L.C. Wagner D.A. Glogowski J. Skipper P.L. Wishnok J.S. Tannenbaum S.R. Anal. Biochem. 1982; 126: 131-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (10824) Google Scholar), incubated at room temperature for 10 min, and then the absorbance at 546 nm determined. Solutions of NaNO2 served as standards. Background nitrite accumulation in unstimulated cells (cells incubated overnight in the absence of cytokines or LPS) was not significantly different from nitrite accumulation measured in media alone. A 2,168-bp fragment of the rat NOS2 promoter was amplified from Harlan Sprague-Dawley liver genomic DNA by PCR using primers derived from the published rat NOS2 promoter sequence (49Zhang H. Chen X. Teng X. Snead C. Catravas J.D. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1998; 55: 1873-1880Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) (forward, 5′-CAG CCA AGT ATT CCA AAG CAA-3′, corresponding to bases 1108–1127; reverse, 5′−AGT CCA GTC CCC TCA CCA A-3′, corresponding to bases 3259–3277), and its identity was confirmed by DNA sequence analysis. Briefly, the 2.2-kb fragment was ligated into the pGL3 basic luciferase vector (Promega, Madison, WI) and co-transfected into C6 cells with plasmid pCMV-Neo (containing a neomycin resistance gene) using Lipofectin reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.). After 2 days, stable transfectants were selected by growth in 0.4 mg/ml G418 (Sigma). The resulting cell line, C6-2.2, has a low level of basal luciferase activity, which can be induced between 4- and 10-fold upon incubation with LPS plus IFN. 2V. Gavrilyuk and D. L. Feinstein, unpublished results. Cells were incubated with the indicated NOS2 inducers in DMEM containing 1% FCS and the indicated concentrations of lactacystin. After varying the incubation times, the media were removed, and the cells were washed once with cold phosphate-buffered saline. To prepare lysates, 50 μl of CHAPS buffer (10 mm CHAPS, 10 mm Tris, pH 7.4) were added to each well, the plate frozen at −80 °C, thawed, and shaken on a rotary shaker for 10–15 min at room temperature. Aliquots of cell lysates (10–20 μl) containing equal amounts of protein (10–20 μg) were placed into wells of an opaque white 96-well microplate. An equal volume of luciferase substrate (Steady Glo reagent, Promega) was added to all samples, and the luminescence was measured in a microplate luminometer (Rosys-Anthos, Austria). The data are presented as the percentage of luciferase activity measured in the presence of NOS2 inducers and lactacystin, relative to the activity of control cells (incubated in media alone). Nuclear extracts were prepared from C6 cells as described previously (33Feinstein D.L. J. Neurochem. 1998; 70: 1484-1496Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Following stimulation with NOS2 inducers, cells were washed in cold phosphate-buffered saline, pelleted, and resuspended in hypotonic buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm KCl, 1 mm DTT) and protease inhibitors (10 μg/ml aprotinin and leupeptin, 100 μm TPCK, 1 mm PMSF). After 15 min on ice, Nonidet P-40 was added to a final concentration of 0.6%, and the lysates were incubated a further 5 min and then centrifuged for 15 min at 12,000 × g to pellet the nuclei. The nuclei were washed once in the same buffer by gentle resuspension and centrifugation. Nuclear extracts were prepared by extraction of the nuclear pellet for 15 min at 4 °C in 50–100 μl of 400 mm NaCl, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, and 1 mm PMSF. Extracts were used immediately or frozen at −80 °C until use. Double-stranded κB consensus binding sites were obtained by annealing complementary κB site oligonucleotides (sequence 5′ AGT TGA GGG GAC TTT CCC AGG C-3′). The resulting double-stranded κB DNA was radiolabeled with32P using T4 kinase, and unincorporated nucleotide was removed by ethanol precipitation. Aliquots of nuclear extracts (1–2 μg) were incubated in binding buffer (50 mm NaCl, 200 ng of poly(dI·dC), 1 mm DTT, 5% glycerol, 10 mmHEPES, pH 7.9, 1 mm PMSF, 50 μg/ml aprotinin) containing 20–50,000 cpm of κB probe. After 20 min incubation at room temperature, the samples were applied to a 5% non-denaturing acrylamide gel that has been pre-run for 1 h at 100 V at 4 °C. The running buffer and gel buffer were both 0.5× TBE (Tris/borate/EDTA). Samples were electrophoresed for 2.5 h at 200 V in a cold box, after which the gels were dried and exposed to x-ray film at room temperature for up to 2 days. For competition assays, the binding reaction was carried out in the presence of a 100-fold excess of non-radioactive κB probe or mutated κB probe. For supershift EMSA, the nuclear extracts were preincubated for 10 min at room temperature with 1 μg of antibodies to NFκB subunits p50 or p65. C6 cells were incubated for indicated times (0–60 min) in a cell culture incubator equilibrated to 43 ± 0.5 °C, 95% humidity, and 5% CO2. Following incubation, the cells were returned to a 37 °C incubator and allowed to recover for 4 h before preparation of cell lysates for Western blot analysis. After incubation with NOS2 inducers and proteasome inhibitors, cells were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, scraped from the dishes, and collected by centrifugation (3,000 × g for 5 min). The cells were resuspended directly into 5 volumes of 8 m urea. Aliquots were either frozen at −80 °C or immediately mixed with an equal volume of a 2× gel sample buffer (2× buffer: 124 mm Tris-Cl, pH 6.8, 0.2% SDS, 10% β−mercaptoethanol, 10 mm EDTA, 50% glycerol) and boiled for 5 min. Protein samples (approximately 20 μg) were separated through SDS-10% polyacrylamide gels. After electrophoresis, proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes by semi-dry electrophoretic transfer. The membranes were blocked in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween 20 (TBST), and 5% dry milk (1 h), rinsed, and incubated with primary antibodies in TBST containing 0.5% bovine serum albumin overnight with gentle shaking at 4 °C. The primary antibody was removed, membranes washed 4 times in TBST, and 0.1 μg/ml peroxidase-labeled goat secondary antibodies added for 1 h. Following 4 washes in TBST, bands were visualized by incubation in enhanced chemiluminescence reagents and exposure to x-ray film. Quantitative assessment of band intensities was obtained by imaging of autoradiographs with an Alpha Innotech (Temucula, CA) Imaging 2000 system. Band intensities were determined from autoradiographs obtained from at least two different exposure times, and background intensities (determined from an equal-sized area of the film immediately below the band of interest) were subtracted. For analysis of the phosphorylation state of IκB-β, an aliquot of whole cell lysate was diluted 5-fold to reduce urea concentration, calf intestine alkaline phosphatase (CIP) buffer added, and samples incubated for 30 min at 37 °C with 10 units of CIP. Samples were separated by SDS-10% polyacrylamide electrophoresis gels that also contained 4 m urea, which we found increases band resolution. Gels were run at 50 V for approximately 18 h with 4 changes of the running buffer. Total cytoplasmic RNA was prepared from cells by the Nonidet P-40 lysis procedure, and levels of NOS2 mRNA were estimated by competitive RT-PCR assay (50Galea E. Reis D.J. Feinstein D.L. J. Neurosci. Res. 1994; 37: 406-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). The primers used for NOS2 detection were 1704F (5′ CTG CAT GGA ACA GTA TAA GGC AAA C-3′), corresponding to bases 1704–1728; and 1933R (5′ CAG ACA GTT TCT GGT CGA TGT CAT GA-3′), complementary to bases 1908–1933 of rat iNOS cDNA sequence (50Galea E. Reis D.J. Feinstein D.L. J. Neurosci. Res. 1994; 37: 406-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar) which yield a 230-bp product. PCR was done in the presence of 2 fg of a 180-bp NOS2 CIS (50Galea E. Reis D.J. Feinstein D.L. J. Neurosci. Res. 1994; 37: 406-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar) which is amplified with the same efficiency as the cDNA template. The mRNA levels of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase were determined in parallel aliquots of cDNA, with primers 796F (5′ GCC AAG TAT GAT GAC ATC AAG AAG) and 1059R (5′ TCC AGG GGT TTC TTA CTC CTT GGA) which yield a 264-bp product. PCR was initiated by a hot start method, and conditions were 35 cycles of denaturation at 93 °C for 35 s; annealing at 63 °C for 45 s; and extension at 72 °C for 45 s; followed by 10 min at 72 °C done in a Hybaid Thermoreactor (Franklin, MA) controlled by tube temperature. PCR products were separated by electrophoresis through 2% agarose gels containing 0.1 μg/ml ethidium bromide. Band intensities were determined using the Alpha Infotech 2000 software. A search of the rat dbEST data base identified ESTAI176319 (566 bp) as 92% identical to the corresponding region of the mouse IκB-β cDNA. This clone is part of rat Unigene cluster Rn.8395 that contains 11 overlapping rat ESTs. The longest contig spans the entire coding region of rat IκB-β and is contained in rat ESTAI574838. The insert in this EST contains a 5′-untranslated regions of 68 bp, a coding region of 1077 bp, a 3′-untranslated region of 54 bp, and a short poly(A)+ tract. The DNA sequence of rat IκB-β (GenBankTM accession number AF246634) is 92% identical to the mouse IκB-β, and the predicted protein of 359 residues is 92% identical to the mouse IκB-β protein. The coding region was subcloned into the pcDNA3.1 expression vector (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) to give p3.1-IκBβ, and the expressed protein was detected with an antibody against mouse IκB−β (Santa Cruz SC-20) when transiently expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells (not shown), confirming its identity as rat IκB-β cDNA. The carboxyl-terminal 54 residues of the rat IκB-β , containing a PEST sequence and casein kinase II phosphorylation site, was deleted by PCR methods and subcloned back into pcDNA3.1 to yield p3.1-ΔIκB-β. Cells were transfected with the either p3.1-IκB-β or p3.1-ΔIκB-β using the Lipofectin 2000 reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.). Briefly, cells wer"

In the present study, we performed a more detailed chimera analysis, and narrowed the domain for the ring recognition to a region from the first transmembrane domain to the first extracellular loop. One chimera with the replacement of the second transmembrane domain and the first extracellular loop of mDP with that of mIP bound only iloprost. The amino acid substitutions in this chimera suggest that Ser50 in the first transmembrane domain of mIP confers the broad ligand recognition of mIP and that Lys75 and Leu83 in the second transmembrane domain of mDP confer the high affinity to PGD2 and the strict specificity of ligand binding of mDP, respectively."

Detailed analysis of in vivo or in vitro folding of these mutant proteins revealed that one or two amino acid residues at the N terminus of pro-GCAP-II are critical, not only for the chaperone function in the folding but also for the net stabilization of pro-GCAP-II. In addition, size exclusion chromatography revealed that pro-GCAP-II exists as a dimer in solution.

Guanylin and uroguanylin are generated as precursor proteins (preproguanylin (prepro-GCAP-I) or preprouroguanylin (prepro-GCAP-II), respectively), which contain the prepro-leader sequences which precede the mature portion. After cleavage of the pre-sequence, pro-GCAP-I and/or pro-GCAP-II are further processed to give the mature peptides, guanylin or uroguanylin (Fig. 1). GCAP-II, a plasma form of uroguanylin, is one of the mature forms of pro-GCAP-II in vivo (4Hess R. Kuhn M. Schultz-Knappe P. Raida M. Fuchs M. Klodt J. Adermann K. Kaever V. Cetin Y. Forssmann W.-G.

Recent studies in this laboratory have shown that spontaneous refolding to the native conformation is attained in pro-GCAP-II but not in GCAP-II (17Hidaka Y. Ohno M. Hemmasi B. Hill O. Forssmann W.-G. Shimonishi Y. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 8498-8507Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), i.e. GCAP-II requires the propeptide, in order to efficiently fold into the bioactive form. There are a few examples, such as subtilisin, α-lytic protease, etc., in which the peptides of the pro-leader sequences in the precursor proteins aid the mature proteins in the proper assembly of the three dimensional structures in vitro and are referred to as “intramolecular chaperones” (18Zhu X. Ohta Y. Jordan F. Inouye M. Nature. 1989; 339: 483-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar, 19Sohl J.L. Jaswal S.S. Agard D.A.

The mature proteins are produced by enzymatic cleavage of the peptides in the pro-leader sequences from the folded precursor proteins. In these examples, the peptides in the pro-leader sequences function not only to diminish the activation energy but also to stabilize the rate-determining transition state(s) in the folding pathway (20Shinde U. Inouye M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1993; 18: 442-446Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 21Hu Z. Zhu X. Jordan F. Inouye M. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 562-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Moreover, the N-terminal peptide in the pro-leader sequence of prosubtilisin, the precursor protein of subtilisin, mediates the folding of the protein intermolecularly. Prosubtilisin exists as homodimer that is assembled during the folding of the protein (21Hu Z. Zhu X. Jordan F. Inouye M. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 562-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 22Hu Z. Haghjoo K. Jordan F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3375-3384Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). However, the mechanism, at the molecular level, of the folding of these proteins via the peptides in the pro-leader sequence remains unclear. In a recent study, it was demonstrated that guanylin, which is homologous to GCAP-II, requires the assistance of the propeptide of the precursor protein, pro-GCAP-I, not only to achieve correct folding but also for the formation of the native disulfide linkages (23Schulz A. Marx U.C. Hidaka Y. Shimonishi Y. Rosch P. Forssmann W.-G. Adermann K. Protein Sci. 1999; 8: 1850-1859Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). These findings, and our previous studies, led us to conclude that the propeptide in the pro-leader sequence of pro-GCAP-I and pro-GCAP-II plays a functional role as an intramolecular chaperone in the correct folding of the mature peptide and is also crucial for the disulfide-coupled folding of the reduced precursor (17Hidaka Y. Ohno M. Hemmasi B. Hill O. Forssmann W.-G. Shimonishi Y. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 8498-8507Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 23Schulz A. Marx U.C. Hidaka Y. Shimonishi Y. Rosch P. Forssmann W.-G. Adermann K. Protein Sci. 1999; 8: 1850-1859Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Furthermore, these studies have led us to propose that the mature form of pro-GCAP-II, GCAP-II, is not at the thermodynamic ground state but, rather, is kinetically trapped in the precursor protein (17Hidaka Y. Ohno M. Hemmasi B. Hill O. Forssmann W.-G. Shimonishi Y. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 8498-8507Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Consequently, these studies raised questions as to which region(s) of the protein, or the manner in which the pro-leader sequence of pro-GCAP-II, contributes to the correct folding of the mature peptide. In this report, we provide evidence that the amino acid residues at the N terminus of the pro-leader sequence are heavily involved in the correct assembly of the three dimensional structure of pro-GCAP-II and, in turn, of GCAP-II. These residues function to stabilize the bioactive form of the mature portion during the folding of the entire protein. Moreover, we provide evidence that supports the existence of a homodimer, which is stabilized by intermolecular and non-covalent interactions between the region in the pro-leader sequence and, possibly, in the intermediate as well as the final steps of the folding process. The data obtained provide basic information, which is critical for our understanding of the role of the pro-leader sequence of the precursor proteins during the maturation of peptide hormones, such as GCAP-II and guanylin. Restriction enzymes were purchased from Toyobo (Osaka, Japan) and New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA). Taqpolymerase, T4 DNA ligase, and endoproteinase Arg-C were obtained from Takara Shuzo Co. (Kyoto, Japan). Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) and fetal bovine serum (FBS) were purchased from Nissui Pharmaceutical, Co. (Tokyo, Japan) and Dainippon Pharmaceutical, Co. (Osaka, Japan), respectively. Thr-Ile-Ala-uroguanylin and its disulfide isomers were synthesized according to a previously described procedure (17Hidaka Y. Ohno M. Hemmasi B. Hill O. Forssmann W.-G. Shimonishi Y. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 8498-8507Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). All other chemicals and solvents were reagent grade. PCR was carried out using a Sanyo DNA amplifier MIR-D30 (Osaka, Japan). The cDNAs encoding the deletion mutant proteins were subcloned into a pET17b expression vector (Novagen), following the introduction, by means of PCR, of anNdeI site at its 5′ end and a XhoI site at its 3′ end using pEX2 as a template. The cDNA sequences of the vectors were confirmed as described above. E. coli BL21(DE3) cells, which were transformed with the expression vector, was cultured at 37 °C in Luria broth medium supplemented with ampicillin (50 mg/liter). The production of the mutant proteins was induced by the addition of 1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β -d-galactopyranoside at the mid-log phase of cell growth. After incubation at 37 °C for 3 h, the cells were harvested and washed with phosphate-buffered saline without magnesium and calcium ions, containing 1% Triton and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The cells were resuspended in the same buffer, sonicated on ice, and centrifuged (15,000 × g, 20 min). The mutant proteins, isolated as an inclusion body, possessed the Met residue at the N terminus derived from the NdeI site during subcloning. The proteins thus prepared were characterized by mass spectrometry and amino acid analysis. The pEX2 vector derived from the pcDNA3 vector (Invitrogen), which contains a strong cytomegalovirus enhancer-promoter sequence for a high level of protein expression in mammalian cells (17Hidaka Y. Ohno M. Hemmasi B. Hill O. Forssmann W.-G. Shimonishi Y. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 8498-8507Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), was used in this experiment. The construction of the expression vectors of the N-terminal deletion mutants of pro-GCAP-II was carried out as follows. The pEX2 vector, which carries a cDNA encoding pre-pro-GCAP-II between a BamHI site at its 5′ end and a XbaI site at its 3′ end (8Hill O. Cetin Y. Cieslak A. Magert H.J. Forssmann W.-G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1253: 146-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), was employed as a template for the construction of the expression vectors in carrying the cDNAs of the N-terminal deletion mutant proteins of pro-GCAP-II. To efficiently use the signal sequence (the pre-region of pre-pro-GCAP-II) for the expression of the mutant proteins, the cDNA fragment from a BamHI site to the end of the signal sequence was amplified by PCR using the pEX2 vector as a template and a sense (ATATAGGATCCAGGGAGCGCGATG) as primer 1 and an antisense (TCTCTCTAGAGAATTCCTCGAGTGACTGTGTGCTCTG) as primer 2. The cDNA fragment encoding the signal sequence was inserted between theBamHI and XbaI sites of pEX2, resulting in the construction of pcDNA3H, which contains a unique XhoI site after the signal sequence between the BamHI site and the XbaI site. The cDNAs encoding the deletion mutant proteins were prepared by PCR and subcloned into the site between theXhoI site and the XbaI site in pcDNA3H. The resulting expression vectors comprised the cDNA sequences, which encode the signal peptide of pre-pro-GCAP-II and each of the deletion mutant proteins, pro-GCAP-II-(7–86), pro-GCAP-II-(12–86), and pro-GCAP-II-(18–86). The mutant proteins (pro-GCAP-II-(7–86) and pro-GCAP-II-(18–86)) contained two additional amino acid residues, which are derived from the XhoI site in the expression vector, at their N termini. The cDNA sequences of the vectors thus constructed were confirmed by analysis using an Applied Biosystems 373A sequencing system. Human embryonic kidney 293T cells (24Wada A. Hirayama T. Kitaura H. Fujisawa J. Hasegawa M. Hidaka Y. Shimonishi Y. Infect. Immun. 1998; 64: 5144-5150Crossref Google Scholar) were maintained in 10% FBS/DMEM and transferred in a 10-cm diameter plate at 60–80% confluence with 20 μg of each of the expression vectors and the SuperFect reagent (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) according to the manufacturer's specifications. After incubation for 16 h, the medium was replaced by DMEM (10 ml/plate) without FBS and the cells were incubated for an additional 2 days at 37 °C in a CO2 incubator. The recombinant proteins, which were expressed as inclusion bodies in E. coli cells, were treated with 20 eq of DTT in 50 mm Tris/HCl (pH 8.0) (200 μl) containing 6 m guanidine HCl under an N2atmosphere at 50 °C for 1 h. The supernatant of the reaction mixture or the culture medium (20 ml) of the 293T cells were applied to a column of Cosmosil 140C18-OPN (1 ml) (Nacarai Tesque Inc., Kyoto, Japan) pre-equilibrated with and washed with 20 ml of solvent A (20% CH3CN in 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid). The adsorbed proteins, which were eluted with solvent B (80% CH3CN in 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid), were collected and lyophilized. The protein was purified by HPLC and analyzed by mass spectrometry, as described previously (17Hidaka Y. Ohno M. Hemmasi B. Hill O. Forssmann W.-G. Shimonishi Y. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 8498-8507Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The yield of the purified protein was 0.5–1 nmol/10 ml of the culture medium of 293T cells, as estimated by amino acid analyses. The recombinant protein (1 nmol) was incubated with endoproteinase Arg-C (50 pmol) in 0.1 m Tris/HCl (pH 8.0) (200 μl) at 37 °C for 18 h. The digest was treated with anhydrotrypsin agarose as described previously (17Hidaka Y. Ohno M. Hemmasi B. Hill O. Forssmann W.-G. Shimonishi Y. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 8498-8507Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), and the supernatant was subjected to HPLC. The eluates were analyzed by mass spectrometry and amino acid analysis. The HPLC apparatus consisted of a Waters 600 multisolvent delivery system (Bedford, MA) equipped with a Hitachi L-3000 photodiode array detector and a D-2000 chromato-integrator (Tokyo, Japan). The protein (1 nmol) was dissolved in 50 mm Tris/HCl (pH 7.4) (50 μl) containing 0.2m NaCl and chromatographed on a TSK-Gel G3000SWXL column (7.8 × 300 mm; Tosoh, Tokyo, Japan). The protein was eluted with 50 mm Tris/HCl (pH 7.4) containing 0.2 m NaCl at a flow rate of 0.8 ml/min, and the eluate was monitored at 220 nm. The molecular mass of the protein was calibrated using a gel filtration calibration kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) containing bovine serum albumin (67 kDa), ovalbumin (43 kDa), RNase A (13.7 kDa), and thioredoxin (20 kDa). Thioredoxin was prepared from E. coli cells transformed with pET32b (Novagen), which possesses the cDNA encoding thioredoxin, purified on a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid resin (Qiagen), and identified by mass spectrometric analysis. The fully reduced pro-GCAP-II-(12–86) was prepared as follows. The protein (2 nmol) was incubated with 20 eq of DTT in 50 mm Tris/HCl (pH 8.0) (200 μl) containing 6m guanidine HCl under an N2 atmosphere at 50 °C for 1 h. The reduced pro-GCAP-II-(12–86) was purified by HPLC, as described above, and lyophilized. The reduced pro-GCAP-II-(12–86) (1 nmol) was dissolved in 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid (20 μl) and mixed with 9 volumes of 50 mm Tris/HCl (pH 8.0) in the presence of 2 mm GSH and 1 mmGSSG as described previously, and incubated at room temperature for 2 days. The oxidative refolding experiment was also carried out in the redox buffer in the presence of the synthetic complementary N-terminal peptides (VYIQYQ or VYIQYQGFRVQ). The reaction mixture was analyzed by HPLC. All solutions used for the refolding experiment were flushed with N2, and the reaction was carried out in a sealed vial under an atmosphere of N2. In a previous report, we demonstrated that the mature form of GCAP-II does not possess sufficient information to permit for its correct folding and that the propeptide in pro-GCAP-II aids in the folding process, yielding only the bioactive form of GCAP-II (17Hidaka Y. Ohno M. Hemmasi B. Hill O. Forssmann W.-G. Shimonishi Y. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 8498-8507Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). This result provided confirmation that the function of the propeptide in the pro-leader sequence of pro-GCAP-II was to serve as an intramolecular chaperone in the folding of GCAP-II, and consequently raised a number of questions, such as (i) which region(s) in the pro-leader sequence of pro-GCAP-II contribute to the correct folding of the mature peptide, and (ii) how does the propeptide play a role in the folding of GCAP-II in vivo andin vitro? To address these problems, we first searched the sequence motif(s) in the pro-leader sequence of pro-GCAP-II in the primary structures of pro-GCAP-IIs, which have been determined thus far, and then deduced the secondary structure of pro-GCAP-II using the Chou-Fasman method (25Chou P.Y. Fasman G.D. Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol. Biol. 1978; 47: 45-148PubMed Google Scholar), as shown in Fig. 1. The amino acid sequences of the N-terminal region (amino acid residues 1–23) and the C-terminal region (amino acid residues 38–65) in the pro-leader sequence of pro-GCAP-II are highly homologous in all species, whereas that in the central region (amino acids 24–37) is diverse. This raises the possibility that the N-terminal region (amino acid residues 1–23), along with the C-terminal region (amino acid residues 38–65), acts as an intramolecular chaperone for the correct folding of pro-GCAP-II to yield the bioactive conformation of the mature peptide, GCAP-II. Further, the secondary structure prediction implied that the N-terminal region (amino acids 1–6) and the C-terminal region (LCVNV, amino acid residues 76–80) in the mature region exist as β-strands, not only in pro-GCAP-II, but also in pro-GCAP-I. Schulz et al. (23Schulz A. Marx U.C. Hidaka Y. Shimonishi Y. Rosch P. Forssmann W.-G. Adermann K. Protein Sci. 1999; 8: 1850-1859Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) recently demonstrated that the N-terminal region (amino acids 1–5) is in close proximity to the C-terminal region (a portion of guanylin) in the solution structure of pro-GCAP-I, as evidenced by NMR measurement. This may be extended to the speculation that the N-terminal region shares a characteristic secondary structure of pro-GCAP-I with the C-terminal mature region. A similar molecular conformation may be imagined in the structure of pro-GCAP-II, since it is likely that pro-GCAP-II has a conformation similar to that of pro-GCAP-I,i.e. it is possible that the N-terminal region (amino acids 1–23) in the pro-leader sequence of pro-GCAP-II interacts with the C-terminal mature region. This interaction may lead to the proper folding of pro-GCAP-II and contribute to the stabilization of the three dimensional structure of the mature portion of pro-GCAP-II, GCAP-II. To examine the nature of the participation of the N-terminal region in the pro-leader sequence of pro-GCAP-II in terms of its correct folding, we prepared a series of mutant proteins of pro-GCAP-II, in which the N-terminal amino acid residues were sequentially deleted from the N terminus of pro-GCAP-II (Fig. 2). The recombinant proteins were generated using E. coli BL21(DE3) cells. All mutant proteins were expressed with an additional Met residue at their N termini, which originated from the starting codon. For example, the deletion of a Val residue at the N terminus of pro-GCAP-II resulted in the production of the mutant protein, Met1-pro-GCAP-II-(2–86) (Fig. 2). Since the mutant proteins were produced as inclusion bodies in the bacterial cells, as is the case for the expression of many eukaryotic proteins by E. coli cells, we were not able to define the conformational states of the mutant proteins immediately after expression in the cells. As a result, the recombinant proteins were purified by HPLC in the reduced form and then oxidatively refolded to the oxidized forms in the presence of 2 mm GSH and 1 mm GSSG following previously reported procedures (17Hidaka Y. Ohno M. Hemmasi B. Hill O. Forssmann W.-G. Shimonishi Y. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 8498-8507Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The refolded proteins were subjected to HPLC, which indicated the presence of a few isomers, which comprised different disulfide linkages (data not shown). It was not possible to completely separate these isomers from each other under the conditions used in this experiment. The refolded proteins were then directly digested by endoproteinase Arg-C and the resulting digests were separated by HPLC, as previously reported (17Hidaka Y. Ohno M. Hemmasi B. Hill O. Forssmann W.-G. Shimonishi Y. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 8498-8507Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The ratios of the disulfide isomers in the digests, which have different disulfide linkages and were clearly separated on HPLC as is the case in our paper (17Hidaka Y. Ohno M. Hemmasi B. Hill O. Forssmann W.-G. Shimonishi Y. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 8498-8507Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), were estimated by measurement of their peak areas on HPLC and shown in Fig. 2. The mutant protein, Met1-pro-GCAP-II-(2–86), consisted predominantly of the native-type Thr-Ile-Ala-uroguanylin (the native-type Thr-Ile-Ala-uroguanylin contains two disulfide linkages between Cys74 and Cys82 and Cys77 and Cys85 (Ref. 17Hidaka Y. Ohno M. Hemmasi B. Hill O. Forssmann W.-G. Shimonishi Y. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 8498-8507Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar)), along with small amounts of biologically inactive isomers 1 and 2 (the positions of the disulfide bonds of isomer 1 are between Cys74 and Cys85 and Cys77 and Cys82, and isomer 2 between Cys74 and Cys77 and Cys82 and Cys85 (Ref. 17Hidaka Y. Ohno M. Hemmasi B. Hill O. Forssmann W.-G. Shimonishi Y. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 8498-8507Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar)), as found in the folding of the wild-type pro-GCAP-II (17Hidaka Y. Ohno M. Hemmasi B. Hill O. Forssmann W.-G. Shimonishi Y. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 8498-8507Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). This indicates that the mutation of the Val residue to Met at the N terminus had no significant effect on the folding of pro-GCAP-II. The mutant proteins, Met2-pro-GCAP-II-(3–86) and Met3-pro-GCAP-II-(4–86), were composed of the native-type Thr-Ile-Ala-uroguanylin, isomer 1 and isomer 2 in ratios of 1: 1.14: 0.82 and 1: 4.4: 2.10, respectively. These data suggest that the deletion of the amino acid residue at the N terminus greatly affects the construction of the native tertiary structure in the mature region of pro-GCAP-II, because the native-type disulfide pairing comprises only one-third of the mutant protein (Met2-pro-GCAP-II-(3–86)). Further, the mutant protein, Met3-pro-GCAP-II-(4–86), in which two amino acid residues were deleted from the N terminus, nearly completely lacked the ability to form the correct disulfide pairing in the mature region and, thus, was devoid of the chaperone function in the pro-leader sequence of pro-GCAP-II, because the ratio of the native type to isomers was comparable with that in the folding of the mature hormone, GCAP-II (17Hidaka Y. Ohno M. Hemmasi B. Hill O. Forssmann W.-G. Shimonishi Y. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 8498-8507Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). To further investigate whether the Tyr residue at position 2 from the N terminus is involved in the folding of pro-GCAP-II, the mutant protein, Met1,2-pro-GCAP-II-(3–86), was prepared in which the Tyr residue was replaced by Met. The result indicates that the distribution of the native-type isomers 1 and 2 in Met1,2-pro-GCAP-II-(3–86) were nearly the same as in the case of Met1-pro-GCAP-II-(2–86) and, therefore, that the replacement of the Tyr residue with Met had no effect on the function of the propeptide in the pro-leader sequence. Collectively, these results indicate that the two N-terminal amino acid residues in length, in particular the N-terminal residue, play an important role in the formation of the correct disulfide linkages of the mature portion of pro-GCAP-II in vitro and, thus, in the function of the intramolecular chaperone of the propeptide in the pro-leader sequence of pro-GCAP-II. Since the mutant proteins were expressed as inclusion bodies in the E. coli cells, we were not able to estimate the effect of the deletion of the N-terminal residue on the in vivo folding of pro-GCAP-II. Therefore, we prepared the wild-type pro-GCAP-II in human embryonic kidney 293T cells, as well as the N-terminal deletion mutants, in which the N-terminal amino acid residues were sequentially deleted from the N terminus, and three types of mutant proteins of pro-GCAP-II, which are devoid of the N-terminal region, as shown in Fig. 2: 1) pro-GCAP-II-(7–86), which is deprived of the 6 N-terminal amino acid residues; 2) pro-GCAP-II-(12–86), which lacks the 11 N-terminal residues; and 3) pro-GCAP-II-(18–86), which lacks the 17 N-terminal residues that comprise an invariant region (amino acid residue sequence 12–17) in both pro-GCAP-II and pro-GCAP-I. The N-terminal deletion mutant proteins, which lack the N-terminal Val or Val-Tyr residues, could not be isolated from 293T cells, although the reason for this is not clear at present. The mutant proteins, which were deleted in a portion of the peptide in the pro-leader sequence of pro-GCAP-II, might be due to its failure to fold in the endoplasmic reticulum, resulting in a protein that is susceptible to degradation by proteases and is not secreted from the endoplasmic reticulum (26Wulfing C. Pluckthun A. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 12: 685-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). The other deletion mutants and the wild-type pro-GCAP-II were expressed in human kidney 293T cells via the expression vector, secreted into the culture media, and then purified by HPLC (Fig. 3) and analyzed by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (Fig. 4). The wild-type pro-GCAP-II showed a signal at m/z = 9487.0, which is consistent with the mass value (9487.9) calculated from the amino acid sequence. In contrast, pro-GCAP-II-(7–86), pro-GCAP-II-(12–86), and pro-GCAP-II-(18–86) exhibited mass spectral signals atm/z = 17859.5, 16203.0, and 15248.0, respectively, which are twice the theoretical values, calculated from their amino acid sequences. No monomeric forms of the N-terminal deletion mutant proteins were detected on Fig. 3. These results indicate that the wild-type pro-GCAP-II was prepared as a monomer and, conversely, that th"

In addition, ScNPI was capable of inhibiting subtilisin BPN′ (K i = 1.4 nm) (EC3.4.21.62). The scnpi gene consists of two regions, a signal peptide (28 amino acid residues) and a mature region (113 amino acid residues, M r = 11,857). The deduced amino acid sequence of scnpi showed high similarity to those of Streptomyces subtilisin inhibitor (SSI) and its homologues. The reactive site of ScNPI for inhibition of subtilisin BPN′ was identified to be Met71–Tyr72 bond by specific cleavage. To identify the reactive site for ScNP, Tyr33 and Tyr72, which are not conserved among other SSI family inhibitors but are preferable amino acid residues for ScNP, were replaced separately by Ala. The Y33A mutant retained inhibitory activity toward subtilisin BPN′ but did not show any inhibitory activity toward ScNP. Moreover, a dimer of ternary complexes among ScNPI, ScNP, and subtilisin BPN′ was formed to give the 2:2:2 stoichiometry. These results strongly indicate that ScNPI is a double-headed inhibitor that has individual reactive sites for ScNP and subtilisin BPN′.

Methods Enzymol. 1995; 248: 183-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (699) Google Scholar). In 1969, Yokote and Noguchi (4Yokote Y. Kawasaki K. Nakajima J. Noguchi Y. Nippon Nogeikagaku Kaishi. 1969; 43: 125-131Crossref Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 5Yokote Y. Noguchi Y. Nippon Nogeikagaku Kaishi. 1969; 43: 132-138Crossref Scopus (14) Google Scholar) found a novel zinc metalloproteinase (ScNP)1 in the culture supernatant of Streptomyces caespitosus. ScNP is one of the smallest zinc metalloproteinase with a molecular weight of 14,376 (6Harada S. Kinoshita T. Kasai N. Tsunasawa S. Sakiyama F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 233: 683-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). ScNP specifically cleaves the peptide bond at the amino-terminal side of aromatic amino acid residues (7Kurisu G. Sugimoto A. Harada S. Takagi M. Imanaka T. Kai Y. J. Ferment. Bioeng. 1997; 83: 590-592Crossref Scopus (9) Google Scholar). ScNP has a common zinc ligand motif (HEXXH), but its third zinc ligand is not the conventional Glu or His but an Asp residue (8Kurisu G. Kinoshita T. Sugimoto A. Nagara A. Kai Y. Kasai N. Harada S. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1997; 121: 304-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Since ScNP carries a Met turn in its structure, which is a feature of Metzincins, it belongs to Metzincins superfamily (3Rawlings N.D. Barrett A.J. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 248: 183-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (699) Google Scholar). Since proteinaceous proteinase inhibitors are very close to the natural substrate, it is very useful for studies of the structure and function of proteinases. Moreover, the studies of inhibitors can lead to efficient drug design that could ultimately lead to novel therapeutic interventions. Many proteinaceous proteinase inhibitors have been found in animals, plants, and microorganisms. However, natural inhibitors for metalloproteinases are very rare. Known examples includeStreptomyces metalloproteinase inhibitor (9Oda K. Koyama T. Murao S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1979; 571: 147-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), Erwinia chrythanthemi inhibitor (10Letoffe S. Delepelaire P. Wandersman C. Mol. Microbiol. 1989; 3: 79-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), and tissue inhibitors of matrix metalloproteinases (11Osthues A. Knauper V. Oberhoff R. Reinke H. Tschesche H.

We have isolated a novel proteinaceous inhibitor for ScNP from a culture supernatant of Streptomyces sp. I-355 and named it S treptomyces caespitosus neutral proteinase inhibitor (ScNPI). ScNPI strongly inhibited not only ScNP (metalloproteinase) but also subtilisin BPN′ (serine proteinase). Unexpectedly, ScNPI had sequence homology to Streptomyces subtilisin inhibitor (SSI) family (15Ikenaka T. Odani S. Sakai M. Nabeshima Y. Sato S. Murao S. J. Biochem.

DIG (digoxigenin) DNA Labeling Kit and DIG Nucleic Acid Detection Kit were purchased from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. PCR kit and ABI PRISMTM DyeTerminator Cycle Sequencing Ready Reaction Kit were purchased from Perkin-Elmer. The mycelia of Streptomyces sp. I-355 were inoculated into 100 ml of a medium that consisted of 2% starch, 4% polypeptone, 0.1% NaCl, 0.1% K2HPO4, 0.1% yeast extract, and 0.05% MgSO4·H2O at pH 7.0 in a 500-ml flask at 30 °C for 72 h with shaking (100 strokes/min). After the cultivation, mycelia were removed by centrifugation (8,000 rpm, 40 min). The supernatant was adjusted to pH 4 with 1 n HCl and then the supernatant was treated at 80 °C for 5 min to inactivate endogenous proteinases. After the treatment, the supernatant was neutralized with 1 n NaOH and used for the purification of inhibitor. The precipitate from 80% saturation of ammonium sulfate was collected by filtration with Hyflo Super-Cel and dissolved in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0 (Buffer A). Cold acetone was slowly added to the sample with stirring to give 33.3% saturation (v/v). After standing at −30 °C for 2 h, the precipitate was removed by centrifugation (8,000 rpm, 20 min). Cold acetone was slowly added to the supernatant with stirring to give 80% saturation (v/v). After standing at −80 °C for 2 h, the precipitate was collected by centrifugation (15,000 rpm, 10 min). The precipitate was dissolved in Buffer A and dialyzed against the same buffer. The dialysate was loaded on a column of DEAE-Sepharose fast flow (26 × 215 mm) equilibrated with Buffer A. The column was washed with the same buffer, and then the inhibitor was eluted with a 0–0.5 m NaCl linear gradient. Fractions containing inhibitory activity were pooled and precipitated with ammonium sulfate (80% saturation). The precipitate was collected by centrifugation (15,000 rpm, 20 min) and dissolved in Buffer A. The sample was loaded on a column of Sephadex G-75 (26 × 900 mm) equilibrated with 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5 (Buffer B), and then the inhibitor was eluted with the same buffer at a flow rate of 30 ml/h. Fractions containing inhibitory activity were pooled. The sample was loaded on a column of Mono Q HR 5/5 (5 × 50 mm) equilibrated with Buffer B. The column was washed with the same buffer, and then the inhibitor was eluted with a 0–0.2m NaCl linear gradient at a flow rate of 0.7 ml/min. Fractions containing inhibitory activity were pooled and stored at −80 °C until use. Molar concentration (as monomer) of ScNPI was measured by BCA Protein Assay Kit using bovine serum albumin as a standard. Concentrations of ScNP and subtilisin BPN′ were spectrophotometrically determined using E 1 cm,1% at 280 nm values of 15.5 and 11.7, respectively. Tricine SDS-PAGE was performed by the method of Schagger and Jagow (25Schagger H. Jagow G.V. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10494) Google Scholar) using 16.5% T, 3% C polyacrylamide gel. The following proteins were used as molecular weight standards: bovine serum albumin (66.2 kDa), ovalbumin (45.0 kDa), carbonic anhydrase (31.0 kDa), soybean trypsin inhibitor (21.5 kDa), lysozyme (14.4 kDa), and aprotinin (6.5 kDa). After the electrophoresis, the gel was stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250. The purified ScNPI was loaded on a column of Superdex 200-HR-10/30 (10 × 300 mm) equilibrated with 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 0.15 m NaCl, and then the inhibitor was eluted with the same buffer at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. Bovine serum albumin (66.2 kDa), ovalbumin (45.0 kDa), chymotrypsinogen A (25.0 kDa), and cytochrome c (12.4 kDa) were used as molecular weight standards. In order to synthesize PCR primers, the partial amino acid sequence of ScNPI was determined. S-Pyridylethylated ScNPI was cleaved with 0.1% CNBr in 70% HCOOH and lyophilized. The resulting peptides were separated by Tricine SDS-PAGE. After electrophoresis, the peptides were electrophoretically transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane and subjected to sequence analysis. Genomic DNA of Streptomyces sp. I-355 was prepared as described previously (26Tanaka T. Kuroda M. Sakaguchi K. J. Bacteriol. 1977; 129: 1487-1494Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) with slight modification. PCR was done with Ampli Taq Polymerase Stoffel fragment (Perkin-Elmer).

The DNA fragments obtained bySalI digestion were ligated into SalI site of pUC18 and transformed into E. coli JM109 cells. DNA sequencing was carried out using ABI PRISMTM TaqDye Deoxy Terminator Cycle Sequencing Ready Reaction kit (Perkin-Elmer) with a Perkin-Elmer model 373A DNA sequencer. The plasmid pScNPI-4, containing the 2.5-kb scnpigene (in this paper), was digested with SmaI. The resulting 1.0-kb fragment was used as the template for PCR. The mature region ofscnpi gene was amplified by PCR (denaturation at 96 °C for 1 min, annealing at 55 °C for 1.5 min, and extension at 72 °C for 1.5 min, 25 cycles) using ER(+) as a sense primer and BH(−) as an antisense primer. The amplified DNA fragment was digested withEcoRI-BamHI and then ligated intoEcoRI-BamHI site of pIN-III-OmpA2 vector. The resulting plasmid was transformed into E. coli JM109 cells. Mutant ScNPIs were constructed by PCR using mutagenic primers (TableI). In a first PCR, mutant genes were constructed as separate halves by a combination of primer ER(+) and Y33A(−), primer BH(−), and Y33A(+) with the same PCR condition for the wild-type gene. Another combination was primer ER(+) and Y72A(−), primer BH(−), and Y72A(+). The PCR products were mixed together and used as templates in a second PCR using the flanking sequence primers, ER(+) and BH(−). The amplified fragment was digested with EcoRI-BamHI and then ligated into EcoRI-BamHI site of pIN-III-OmpA2 vector. The resulting plasmid was transformed into E. coliJM109 cells. The mutation site was confirmed by DNA sequence using ER (+) as a sequencing primer. E. coli JM109 cells harboring recombinant plasmid were inoculated into 100 ml of M9 medium (0.6% Na2HPO4, 0.3% KH2PO4, 1.0% NH4Cl, 0.2% glucose, 0.1 mmCaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, and 0.2% casamino acid, pH 7.4) containing 50 μg/ml ampicillin and 1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactoside in a 500-ml flask with shaking (110 strokes/min) at 30 °C for 20 h. After the cultivation, cells were collected by centrifugation (6,000 rpm, 20 min) and suspended in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5 (10 ml of buffer/1 g of cells). The suspension was sonicated and centrifuged (15,000 rpm, 10 min). Solid ammonium sulfate was slowly added to the supernatant with stirring to give 80% saturation. The precipitate was collected by centrifugation (15,000 rpm, 10 min) and dissolved in Buffer B and dialyzed against the same buffer. The subsequent purification steps were the same as described for the authentic ScNPI. 0.25 ml of 1.18 μm ScNP and 0.25 ml of inhibitor solution were incubated at 37 °C for 10 min. Then 1.5 ml of 4/3% Hammersten casein in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, was added and incubated at 37 °C for 60 min. After the incubation, the reaction was stopped by the addition of 2 ml of 0.44 mtrichloroacetic acid. The precipitate was then removed by filtration. 0.5 ml of the filtrate was neutralized with 2.5 ml of 0.44m sodium carbonate and incubated with 0.5 ml of 1n Folin-Ciocalteu's reagents solution at 37 °C for 20 min, and then the absorbance at 660 nm was measured. One inhibitor unit (IU) was defined as the amount of inhibitor that caused a 50% reduction of caseinolytic activity. In all of the reactions, enzyme was preincubated with 10 or 50 m excess of inhibitor at 37 °C for 10 min. 0.25 ml of enzyme (167 nm thermolysin, 104 nm vimelysin, 163 nm P. elastase, and 565 nmalmelysin) and 0.25 ml of inhibitor solution were incubated at 37 °C for 10 min. Then 1.5 ml of 4/3% Hammersten casein in 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, was added and incubated at 37 °C for 40 min. Residual enzyme activity was measured as described above. 0.25 ml of 1.18 μm subtilisin BPN′ and 0.25 ml of inhibitor solution were incubated at 37 °C for 10 min. Then 1.5 ml of Hammersten casein in 0.1 m borate buffer, pH 9.5, was added and incubated at 37 °C for 15 min. 0.25 ml of 2.85 μm pepsin and 0.25 ml of inhibitor solution were incubated at 37 °C for 10 min. Then 1.5 ml of Hammersten casein in 0.1 m lactate buffer, pH 3.0, was added and incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. 20 μl of 430 nm trypsin and 20 μl of inhibitor solution were incubated at 37 °C for 10 min. Then 360 μl of 0.1 mm Bz-Arg-MCA in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, containing 0.1 mNaCl, 10 mm CaCl2, and 0.01% Triton X-100 was added and incubated at 37 °C for 20 min. Reaction was stopped by the addition of 800 μl of 15% acetic acid. Fluorescence intensity was measured with a Hitachi F-2000 spectrophotometer at λex 380 nm and λem 460 nm. 25 μl of 5 nm chymotrypsin and 25 μl of inhibitor solution were incubated at 37 °C for 10 min. Then 200 μl of 0.1 mmSuc-Ala-Ala-Pro-Phe-MCA in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, containing 10 mm CaCl2 and 0.01% Triton X-100 was added and incubated at 37 °C for 20 min. Reaction was stopped by the addition of 750 μl of 15% acetic acid. 25 μl of 544 nm cathepsin B and 25 μl of inhibitor solution were incubated at 37 °C for 10 min. Then, 500 μl of 20 μm benzyloxycarbonyl-Phe-Arg-MCA in 0.4 mphosphate buffer, pH 6.0, containing 4 mm EDTA and 8 mm cysteine monohydrochloride was added and incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 1 ml of 0.1 m sodium acetate buffer, pH 5.0, containing 0.1m iodoacetic acid. Kinetic analysis for ScNP was performed by using a newly designed fluorogenic substrate, MOCAc-Ala-Arg-Gly-Tyr-Gln-Gly-Lys(Dnp)-NH2. All of the reactions were carried out in 50 mm TES-NaOH, pH 7.0, containing 10 mm CaCl2 and 0.01% Triton X-100 (v/v) (Buffer C) at 25 °C. Fluorescence intensity was measured with a Hitachi F-2000 fluorescence spectrophotometer at λex 328 nm and λem 393 nm. Substrate concentration was estimated from the fluorescence intensity of the perfectly cleaved substrate using MOCAc-Pro-Leu-Gly-OH as a standard compound. Initial velocity was calculated from the increase of fluorescence intensity for 1 min caused by the release of MOCAc-Ala-Arg-Gly. Kinetic parameters were determined from a Lineweaver-Burk plot. ScNP (final concentration of 5.9 nm) in 980 μl of Buffer C was incubated at 25 °C for 5 min. Then 20 μl of the fluorogenic substrate (final concentration of 4.7–16.5 μm) in the same buffer was added to the enzyme solution. Thek cat value was calculated by an equation ofV max = k cat[E]0, where [E]0 is the enzyme concentration. Inhibition constant (K i) was calculated from a Dixon plot. ScNP (final concentration of 5.9 nm) and various concentrations of ScNPIs (final concentration of 1.5–3.5 nm; in the case of authentic ScNPI, 2.1–6.2 nm) in 980 μl of Buffer C were incubated at 25 °C for 30 min. Then 20 μl of the substrate in the same buffer was added to give a final concentration of 2.6, 3.9, and 5.2 μm. K i values toward subtilisin BPN′ were also calculated from a Dixon plot. Subtilisin BPN′ (final concentration of 5.14 nm) and various concentrations of ScNPIs (final concentration of 0.51–2.09 nm) in 980 μl of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, containing 10 mmCaCl2 and 0.01% Triton X-100 (v/v) were incubated at 25 °C for 20 min. Then 20 μl of Suc-Ala-Ala-Pro-Phe-MCA in the same buffer was added to give a final concentration of 25, 50, and 100 μm. A fluorescence intensity was measured with a Hitachi F-2000 fluorescence spectrophotometer at λex 380 nm and λem 460 nm at 25 °C. Initial velocities were calculated from the liberated 7-amino-4-methylcoumarin (AMC) per min. Limited proteolysis by subtilisin BPN′ was performed according to the method of Hiromi et al. (14) with slight modification. ScNPI (1 nmol) and subtilisin BPN′ (0.65 nmol) were mixed in 50 μl of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and incubated at 25 °C for 10 min. Then an equal volume of ice-chilled 0.5m glycine HCl, pH 2.5, was added to the mixture. Immediately, proteins were precipitated with trichloroacetic acid at a final concentration of 15%. The precipitate was subjected to Tricine SDS-PAGE. In the case of ScNP, ScNPI (1 nmol) was incubated with ScNP (1 nmol) in 100 μl of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, at 37 °C for 60 min. Then an equal volume of 0.5 m glycine HCl, pH 2.5, was added to the mixture and incubated at 4 °C for 60 min. The data were measured from the far-UV region (190–250 nm) to the near-UV region (250–350 nm) with a Jasco J-720 model CD spectropolarimeter using a 0.1-cm path length cell or a 1-cm path length cell, respectively. Complex formation between ScNPI and ScNP or subtilisin BPN′ was demonstrated by gel filtration on Superdex 200-HR-10/30 (10 × 300 mm) equilibrated with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm CaCl2, 0.15 m NaCl, and 0.02% NaN3. ScNPI (1.2 nmol) and ScNP (1.2 nmol) or subtilisin BPN′ (1.2 nmol) were incubated at 25 °C for 30 min in 200 μl of the same buffer. After the incubation, the mixture was applied onto the column. Elution was carried out with the same buffer at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. A formation of the ternary complex was also analyzed by the same procedure. ScNPI (1.2 nmol), ScNP (1.2 nmol), and subtilisin BPN′ (1.2 nmol) were incubated at 25 °C for 30 min in the 200 μl of the same buffer. After the incubation, the mixture was applied onto the column. According to the high similarity of amino acid sequences between ScNPI and Streptomyces subtilisin inhibitor (SSI), we assumed that the structure of ScNPI is similar to that of SSI. Based on this, a hypothetical model was predicted. The locations of the reactive sites of ScNPI for subtilisin BPN′ and ScNP were predicted by superimposing the reactive sites on the crystal structure-based α-carbon framework of Streptomyces subtilisin inhibitor (SSI) (28Mitsui Y. Satow Y. Watanabe Y. Iitaka Y. J. Mol. Biol. 1979; 131: 697-724Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). ScNPI was purified from a culture supernatant of Streptomyces sp. I-355 to electrophoretic homogeneity by three steps of column chromatography: DEAE-Sepharose fast flow, Sephadex G-75, and Mono Q. About 10 mg of the purified ScNPI was obtained from 2 liters of the culture supernatant (data not shown). The specific inhibitory activity of purified ScNPI was 340 IU/mg. The purified ScNPI showed a single protein band on Tricine SDS-PAGE with a molecular weight of 11,000 (Fig. 3). The molecular weight in the native state was also estimated to be 20,000 by gel filtration (data not shown), indicating that the inhibitor exists as dimers. The effects of ScNPI on several proteinase activities were investigated. Toward metalloproteinases, ScNPI strongly inhibited ScNP and slightly inhibited vimelysin.

Open table in a new tab Kinetic analysis for ScNP was performed by using a newly designed fluorogenic substrate, MOCAc-Ala-Arg-Gly-Tyr-Gln-Gly-Lys(Dnp)-NH2. ScNP specifically cleaved this peptide at the Gly-Tyr bond. The kinetic parameters for cleavage by ScNP were calculated from a Lineweaver-Burk plot. The K m, k cat, andk cat/K m values of ScNP were determined to be 12.4 μm, 0.39 s−1, and 3.1 × 104m−1 s−1, respectively (data not shown). K i values of authentic ScNPI were determined from a Dixon plot (data not shown).K i values toward ScNP and subtilisin BPN′ were determined to be 1.6 and 1.4 nm, respectively. In order to synthesize oligonucleotide primers for PCR, the partial amino acid sequence of ScNPI was analyzed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The amino-terminal amino acid sequence of the native ScNPI was identified as 1SAHGPSAMVTVIQGSGEPT20- and that of the CNBr-cleaved peptide fragment of ScNPI was identified as YFDPVTVTADGVLNGRRVAWKHTFS-. A 260-base pair DNA fragment containing the scnpi gene was amplified by PCR (data not shown). The fragment was labeled with DIG and used as a probe for hybridization. Genomic DNA of Streptomyces sp. I-355 was digested withBamHI, PstI, SacI, SalI,SphI, and XhoI and subjected to Southern blot analysis with the probe. A 2.5-kb fragment of SalI-digested DNA was hybridized with the probe (data not shown). A partial genomic library was then constructed. One colony was obtained from about 1,500E. coli transformants. The plasmid containing the full-length scnpi gene was named pScNPI-4. The location of the scnpi gene was determined by Southern blot analysis of pScNPI-4. A 1.0-kb SmaI fragment was subjected to sequence analysis (Fig. 1). An open reading frame consisted of 423 nucleotides. The deduced amino acid sequence consisted of 141 amino acid residues with a molecular weight of 14,656 (Fig. 1). All of the partial amino acid sequences of the ScNPI agreed with the predicted ScNPI gene product. A comparison of the NH2-terminal amino acid sequence of the authentic ScNPI and the deduced amino acid sequence of the scnpi gene revealed that ScNPI consisted of two regions, a signal region (28 amino acid residues) and a mature region (113 amino acid residues,M r = 11,857). The deduced amino acid sequence of ScNPI showed high similarity to those of Streptomycessubtilisin inhibitor (SSI) and its homologues (Fig.2). Thus, ScNPI was revealed to be a novel proteinase inhibitor that belongs to the SSI family.Figure 2Comparison of the amino acid sequence of ScNPI and those of SSI family inhibitors.

We demonstrate that the C-terminal helix of Tn5 transposase (residues 458–468 of 476 total amino acids) is required for synaptic complex formation during Tn5 transposition. Specifically, deletion of eight amino acids or more from the C terminus greatly reduces or abolishes synaptic complex formation in vitro. Due to this impaired synaptic complex formation, transposases lacking eight amino acids are also defective in the cleavage step of transposition. Interactions within the synaptic complex dimer interface were investigated by site-directed mutagenesis, and residues required for synaptic complex formation include amino acids comprising the dimer interface in the Tn5 inhibitor x-ray crystal structure dimer. Because the crystal structure dimer was hypothesized to be the inhibitory complex and not a synaptic complex, this result was surprising.

IS50R encodes two proteins, a 476-amino acid (aa) cis-acting transposase (Tnp) protein, which is essential for transposition, and a 421-aa inhibitor protein (Inh), which inhibits transposition both in cis and in trans (2Johnson R.C.

Krebs M.P. Reznikoff W.S. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 6932-6938Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Because translation of Inh begins from a downstream, in-frame, independent start codon, Inh is identical to Tnp except that 55 aa on the N terminus are missing. IS50L encodes proteins P3 and P4 corresponding to Tnp and Inh of IS50R. These proteins are nonfunctional because of an ochre codon at residue Glu-451 (4, see Ref.5Reznikoff W.S. Bhasin A. Davies D.R.

Biol. 1997; 271: 362-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Interaction of these bound Tnp monomers through Tnp-Tnp dimerization forms a complex nucleoprotein structure termed a synapse (3de la Cruz N.B. Weinreich M.D. Wiegand T.W. Krebs M.P. Reznikoff W.S.

Nicking of one DNA strand then occurs via nucleophilic attack of a water molecule (activated by a Tnp-coordinated Mg2+) on the phosphodiester backbone between the +1 position of the OE and the −1 position of the flanking DNA (donor backbone). This released 3′-OH then attacks the opposite DNA strand creating a hairpin intermediate (8Goryshin I.Y. Kil Y.V. Reznikoff W.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 1998; 273: 7367-7374Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). A second activated water molecule then resolves the hairpin intermediate. Strand transfer then occurs via a transesterification reaction in which the 3′-OH groups of the transposon attack the phosphodiester backbone of the captured target DNA in a staggered fashion. Formation of a covalent bond between the oxygen of the 3′-OH groups of the transposon ends and the 5′-phosphate groups of the target integrates the transposon (10Mizuuchi K. Adzuma K. Cell. 1991; 66: 129-140Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Integration results in a 9-bp duplication of target DNA (4Berg D.E. Howe M.M Mobile DNA.

Previous studies have implied a role for the N-terminal 113 amino acids of Tnp in OE DNA binding (7Zhou M. Reznikoff W.S. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 271: 362-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 11Mahnke Braam L.A. Reznikoff W.S. J. Biol.

Reznikoff W.S. Rayment I. J. Biol.

Reznikoff W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10908-10913Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), yet a role for the C-terminal region (aa 441–476) in transposition has not been elucidated nor has the region of Tnp required for synaptic complex formation (dimerization) been established.Previous experiments hypothesized two regions of Tnp to be important for dimerization (11Mahnke Braam L.A. Reznikoff W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10908-10913Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The first, aa 114–314, encompasses the catalytic core of Tnp. The second, aa 441–476, includes the C-terminal α helix. These two dimerization domains were thought to have distinct functions; the catalytic dimerization domain was hypothesized to be required for synapsis whereas the C-terminal dimerization domain was necessary for inhibition. This theory was based, in part, on a functional domain comparison of Tn5 Tnp with Tn10Tnp, a catalytically identical prokaryotic transposase. A homologous catalytic dimerization domain was detected in Tn10 Tnp, but the C-terminal dimerization domain was not found. Two different amino acid sequence alignments of Tn10 Tnp and Tn5 Tnp reveal no similarity between the two proteins in this C-terminal region (11Mahnke Braam L.A. Reznikoff W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10908-10913Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). 2M. Steiniger-White, unpublished data. 2M. Steiniger-White, unpublished data. Because Tn5also encodes Inh, which inhibits transposition through production of nonfunctional Inh-Tnp multimers (3de la Cruz N.B. Weinreich M.D. Wiegand T.W. Krebs M.P. Reznikoff W.S. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 6932-6938Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and this type of regulation by dimerization to an inhibitor protein is unique to Tn5, it was concluded that the C-terminal dimerization domain was primarily important for inhibition.This hypothesis was supported upon elucidation of the x-ray crystal structure of the Tn5 Inh dimer (12Davies D.R. Braam L.M. Reznikoff W.S. Rayment I. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11904-11913Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). In the dimer structure, residues in the C terminus of each monomer form a scissor-like dimerization interface (Fig. 2). The authors concluded that the structure could not represent the synaptic complex because the distance between monomer active sites in the dimer structure is 65 Å. If no conformational change occurs following cleavage and the transposon is inserted into target DNA with a 9-bp stagger, the active sites in the synaptic complex would be approximately 35 Å apart. Because a dramatic conformational change along multiple axes would be required for the C-terminal dimerization helix to be involved in synaptic complex formation, the authors hypothesized the dimer structure to be the inhibitory complex. Investigation of this hypothesis by analysis of a site-directed mutant (A466D) confirmed the requirement of dimerization of the C-terminal α helices for inhibition (13Mahnke Braam L.A. Goryshin I.Y. Reznikoff W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 86-92Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar).Figure 2Location of C-terminal Tnp mutants.

C-terminal residues Ser-458, Gly-462, and Ala-466 were mutated to disrupt the C-terminal dimerization interface. These residues are colored red, and their side chains are represented as “ball and stick” in each Inh monomer. The dimer interface interactions are primarily hydrophobic, and the crossover point of the two C-terminal helices within the interface is at residue Gly-462. Dimerization of the C-terminal α helices brings Gly-462 and Ala-466 residues from each monomer into close proximity. Another important interaction includes hydrogen bonding of each Ser-458 residue with the Lys-459 residue (not shown) of the opposite monomer. Residues shown in green were deleted progressively (from the C terminus) to determine the number of C-terminal residues required for a functional Tnp.

After screening 1000 colonies, only deletions C-terminally truncated by seven amino acids or less were found to be functional (data not shown). These experiments established a requirement for the C terminus in transposition.In this manuscript we present evidence that the C-terminal α helix of Tnp is required for both in vivo and in vitrotransposition; deletion of eight or more amino acids from this helix resulted in loss of function. We determined that the C-terminal α helix is necessary for synapsis, but does not directly affect the cleavage step of transposition. Investigation of the synapsis dimer interface revealed interactions identical with those seen in Inh dimer crystal structure. This inferred that the interface observed in the Inh x-ray structure is required for synaptic complex formation.Note Added in ProofFollowing completion of this work, the x-ray crystal structure of Tn5 transposase complexed with OE DNA (preintegration complex) was solved (Davies, D. R., Goryshin, I. Y., Reznikoff, W. S., and I. Rayment (2000) Science, in press). The C-terminal or helix, discussed in this manuscript, was the primary protein-protein dimerization interface seen in the co-crystal structure. Therefore, the biochemical data presented here correlate well with structural data.

Note Added in ProofFollowing completion of this work, the x-ray crystal structure of Tn5 transposase complexed with OE DNA (preintegration complex) was solved (Davies, D. R., Goryshin, I. Y., Reznikoff, W. S., and I. Rayment (2000) Science, in press). The C-terminal or helix, discussed in this manuscript, was the primary protein-protein dimerization interface seen in the co-crystal structure. Therefore, the biochemical data presented here correlate well with structural data.

https://openalex.org/W2162834285,"Archaeal zinc-containing ferredoxin fromSulfolobus sp. strain 7 contains one [3Fe-4S] cluster (cluster I), one [4Fe-4S] cluster (cluster II), and one isolated zinc center. Oxidative degradation of this ferredoxin led to the formation of a stable intermediate with 1 zinc and ∼6 iron atoms. The metal centers of this intermediate were analyzed by electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR), low temperature resonance Raman, x-ray absorption, and1H NMR spectroscopies. The spectroscopic data suggest that (i) cluster II was selectively converted to a cubane [3Fe-4S]1+ cluster in the intermediate, without forming a stable radical species, and that (ii) the local metric environments of cluster I and the isolated zinc site did not change significantly in the intermediate. It is concluded that the initial step of oxidative degradation of the archaeal zinc-containing ferredoxin is selective conversion of cluster II, generating a novel intermediate containing two [3Fe-4S] clusters and an isolated zinc center. At this stage, significant structural rearrangement of the protein does not occur. We propose a new scheme for oxidative degradation of dicluster ferredoxins in which each cluster converts in a stepwise manner, prior to apoprotein formation, and discuss its structural and evolutionary implications.

The 2.0-Å resolution x-ray crystal structure (PDB1 entry 1XER ; Ref. 6Fujii T. Hata Y. Wakagi T. Tanaka N. Oshima T. Nat. Struct.

A similar zinc site was also found in ferredoxin from Thermoplasma acidophilumstrain HO-62 that also contained one [3Fe-4S]1+,0cluster, and one [4Fe-4S]2+,1+ cluster (7Iwasaki T. Suzuki T. Kon T.

This site was analyzed by zinc K-edge x-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) (8Cosper N.J. Stålhandske C.M.V. Iwasaki H. Oshima T. Scott R.A. Iwasaki T. J. Biol.

Thus, these unusual ferredoxins contain both the conventional FeS clusters and a structurally conserved, isolated zinc center. This new class of bacterial type ferredoxin, isolated from phylogenetically diverse members of several aerobic and thermoacidophilic archaea, are thus called “zinc-containing ferredoxins” (2Kerscher L.

Another unexpected result of the crystal structure of air-oxidizedSulfolobus sp. zinc-containing ferredoxin was the presence of two [3Fe-4S] clusters beside one isolated zinc center (9Fujii T. Hata Y. Oozeki M. Moriyama H. Wakagi T. Tanaka N. Oshima T. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 1505-1513Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). The number and type of FeS clusters in this structure are inconsistent with our previous spectroscopic analysis of the purified protein, which suggested one [3Fe-4S]1+,0 cluster (cluster I; E ½ = −280 mV) and one [4Fe-4S]2+,1+ cluster (cluster II;E ½ = −530 mV) (5Iwasaki T.

The primary structure ofSulfolobus sp. ferredoxin showed the presence of seven cysteines that are arranged in two FeS cluster-binding motifs, one from the sequence, Cys45-Leu-Ala-Asp48-Gly-Ser-Cys51and Cys93-Pro, and the other from the sequence, Cys55-Pro and Cys83-Ile-Phe-Cys86-Met-Ala-Cys89(5Iwasaki T.

The latter motif provides a typical binding site for a [4Fe-4S] cluster with complete cysteinyl ligation, although Cys86 does not serve as a ligand to the [3Fe-4S] cluster II in the crystal structure (Fig. 1). Because FeS clusters have a remarkable facility for interconversion under protein-bound conditions (reviewed in Ref. 14Beinert H. Holm R.H. Münck E. Science. 1997; 277: 653-659Crossref PubMed Scopus (1531) Google Scholar), the significant discrepancy of the types of FeS clusters of Sulfolobus sp. zinc-containing ferredoxin in the crystalline and as-isolated states may represent selective degradation of the cluster II to a [3Fe-4S] form in vitro. Although the [4Fe-4S] ↔ [3Fe-4S] cluster interconversion is well known in some bacterial type ferredoxins (14Beinert H. Holm R.H. Münck E.

In this instance, it has been proposed that ferricyanide oxidation results in complete destruction of the [4Fe-4S] cluster, to produce an intermediate containing only one [3Fe-4S] cluster (cluster I), en route to complete disruptions of both clusters and ultimately to unfolded protein (30Morgan T.V.

Herein, we report comparisons of EPR, resonance Raman, XAS, and1H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) analyses of the metal centers in the native 7Fe and the intermediate forms ofSulfolobus sp. zinc-containing ferredoxin. Our spectroscopic data demonstrate the oxidative degradation of cluster II to form a [3Fe-4S] cluster, yielding a 6Fe-containing intermediate of zinc-containing ferredoxin. This will be also discussed with respect to the structure and evolution of a ferredoxin core fold module. DEAE-Sepharose Fast Flow and Sephadex G-50 gels were purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, and NMR-grade D2O was from Wako Pure Chemicals (Tokyo, Japan). Water was purified by the Milli-Q purification system (Millipore). Other chemicals used in this study were of analytical grade. Sulfolobus sp. strain 7 cells (JCM 10545), originally isolated from Beppu Hot Springs, Japan, were cultivated aerobically and chemoheterotrophically at pH 2.5–3 and 75–80 °C, and the 7Fe form of the archaeal ferredoxin was routinely purified as described previously (5Iwasaki T.

Absorption spectra were recorded using a Hitachi U3210 spectrophotometer or a Beckman DU-7400 spectrophotometer. Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry of purified apoferredoxin (made in distilled water) was performed by a Finnigan MAT VISION 2000 instrument at an accelerating potential of 5.0 kV, using a 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid matrix.

Purified zinc-containing ferredoxins in 20 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 6.8, were concentrated by pressure filtration with an Amicon YM-3 membrane. Further concentration was achieved by placing the samples under a stream of dry nitrogen gas. The resultant samples (∼2–3 mm), containing 30% (v/v) glycerol, were frozen in a 24 × 3 × 2-mm polycarbonate cuvette with a Mylar-tape front window for XAS studies.

The NMR sample was prepared by exchanging the buffer of purified ferredoxin into 10 mm sodium deuterium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5 (pH was uncorrected), using an Amicon ultrafiltration device with a YM-3 membrane (final concentration, ∼3 mm ferredoxin). Sweep widths of 30 KHz were used for the purified protein. 1H spectra were recorded with either a slow repetition time (2 s) using presaturation for water suppression or with a fast repetition time (100 ms) using a super water elimination Fourier transform (super-WEFT) pulse sequence (43Inubushi T. Becker E.D. J. Magn. Reson. 1983; 51: 128-133Google Scholar) with a relaxation delay (60 ms) between the π and π/2 pulse sequence for water suppression. The spectra were calibrated by referencing to the residual HDO signal, assigned to a 4.74-ppm shift at 303 K. The standard JEOL software package was used for data processing. Protein concentration of purified ferredoxins was measured as described previously (10Iwasaki T. Oshima T. FEBS Lett. 1997; 417: 223-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Metal content analyses were carried out by inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometry with a Seiko SPS 1500 VR instrument at Tokyo Institute of Technology and a Jobin-Yvon JY 38S instrument at Rigaku Ltd. The typical yield of the purified intermediate obtained from the 7Fe form was ∼30% under the conditions described under “Experimental Procedures.” The matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry suggested that masses [M + H]1+ of these apoproteins are identical within the experimental error (data not shown). Chemical analysis by inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometry suggested the iron:zinc ratio of 6.9:1.0 mol/mol in the native 7Fe form and 5.6:1.0 mol/mol in the intermediate form. The 7Fe form of Sulfolobussp. ferredoxin elicited a sharp g = 2.02 EPR signal (0.9–1.0 spin/mol) attributed to a [3Fe-4S]1+ cluster as reported previously (5Iwasaki T. Wakagi T. Isogai Y. Tanaka K.

The intermediate form also elicited a sharp EPR signal at g = 2.02, detectable up to 20 K, but with different lineshapes and relaxation behavior. The microwave power saturation behavior of the EPR signal at 8 K, of the intermediate form (P ½ of 36 mW assuming a single component; P ½ of 0.7 mW and 110 mW assuming two components; open squares in Fig.2 B), was also different from that of the native 7Fe form (P ½ of 60 mW; closed squares in Fig. 2 B). Under non-saturation conditions, the spin concentration of the g = 2.02 EPR signal of the intermediate was estimated to be ∼1.7 spin/mol, indicating the presence of approximately two S = 1/2 [3Fe-4S]1+ clusters. No EPR signals were detected at temperatures above 35 K, suggesting the absence of a stable radical species in the air-oxidized intermediate (cf. Refs.30Morgan T.V. Stephens P.J. Devlin F. Stout C.D.

Upon reduction of the native 7Fe form, the sharp g = 2.02 EPR signal attributed to that of a [3Fe-4S]1+cluster was fully reduced, thus giving rise to a very broad low field resonance at g ∼ 12, which is characteristic of the reduced S = 2 [3Fe-4S]0 cluster (44Johnson M.K. Bennett D.E. Fee J.A. Sweeney W.V. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 911: 81-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3, trace A). A rhombic EPR signal at g = 2.06, 1.94, and 1.90, attributed to the reduced S = 1/2 [4Fe-4S]1+ cluster, was detected. This signal had additional wings on the high and low field sides of the main EPR signal (g = 2.11 and 1.85), resulting from magnetic interactions with the reduced S = 2 [3Fe-4S]0 cluster. These EPR signals could be detected up to 30 K (data not shown), and no evidence for the presence of a high multiplicity S = 3/2 [4Fe-4S]1+ cluster was obtained (Fig. 3, trace A). Reduction of the intermediate under the same conditions resulted in the disappearance of most of the sharp g = 2.02 EPR signal attributed to the S = 1/2 [3Fe-4S]1+clusters, and the appearance of the broad low field resonance atg = 12 characteristic of the S = 2 [3Fe-4S]0 cluster, as the predominant species (Fig. 3,traces B, C, and D). Several weak and minor resonances, mainly consisting of the remainingS = 1/2 [3Fe-4S]1+ cluster atg = 2.02 and a very weak radical feature atg = 2 of unknown origin, were also reproducibly detected in the g ∼ 2 region (<0.1 spin/mol). All these minor species existed in a substoichiometric amount (<0.1 spin/mol), indicating minor heterogeneity in the dithionite-reduced intermediate form. Low temperature resonance Raman spectroscopy has been utilized as a probe for distinguishing between types of oxidized FeS clusters (16Conover R.C. Kowal A.T. Fu W. Park J.-B. Aono S. Adams M.W.W.

Hence, the properties of the air-oxidized FeS clusters of Sulfolobus sp. ferredoxin were investigated by resonance Raman spectroscopy (Fig.4, A and B).

A weak band at 335 cm−1 appears in the native 7Fe form and is assigned to the Fe-S bridging mode of a regular biological [4Fe-4S]2+ cluster with complete cysteinyl ligation (46Czernuszewicz R.S.

A panel of U5A cells expressing truncation mutants of IFNAR2c on their cell surface were generated for study. Janus kinase (JAK) activation was detected in all mutant cell lines; however, STAT1 and STAT2 activation was observed only in U5A cells expressing full-length IFNAR2c and IFNAR2c truncated at residue 462 (R2.462). IFNAR2c mutants truncated at residues 417 (R2.417) and 346 (R2.346) or IFNAR2c mutant lacking tyrosine residues in its cytoplasmic domain (R2.Y-F) render the receptor inactive. A similar pattern was observed for IFN-inducible STAT activation, STAT complex formation, and STAT-DNA binding. Consistent with these data, IFN-inducible gene expression was ablated in U5A, R2.Y-F, R2.417, and R2.346 cell lines. The implications are that tyrosine phosphorylation and the 462–417 region of IFNAR2c are independently obligatory for receptor activation. In addition, the distal 53 amino acids of the intracellular domain of IFNAR2c are not required for IFN-receptor mediated STAT activation, ISFG3 or SIF complex formation, induction of gene expression, and inhibition of thymidine incorporation. These data demonstrate for the first time that both tyrosine phosphorylation and a specific domain of IFNAR2c are required in human cells for IFN-dependent coupling of JAK activation to STAT phosphorylation, gene induction, and antiproliferative effects. In addition, human and murine cells appear to require different regions of the cytoplasmic domain of IFNAR2c for regulation of IFN responses.

Langer J.A. Zoon K. Samuel C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1987; 56: 727-777Crossref PubMed Scopus (1604) Google Scholar). Type I IFNs also elicit important antiproliferative effects in a number of cell lines and play a major role in mediating immunomodulatory activity (2Stark G. Kerr I.M. Williams B.R.G. Silverman R.H. Schreiber R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 67: 227-264Crossref Scopus (3387) Google Scholar). Cellular responses to type I IFNs require the interaction of type I IFNs with their cognate receptor, which is composed of two receptor subunits, IFNAR1 and IFNAR2c (also designated α and βL, respectively). Once activated, the type I IFN receptor initiates signaling events, which culminate in the induction of a broad spectrum of IFN-responsive genes (2Stark G. Kerr I.M. Williams B.R.G. Silverman R.H. Schreiber R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 67: 227-264Crossref Scopus (3387) Google Scholar, 3Uzé G. Lutfalla G. Mogensen K. J. Interferon Cytokine Res. 1996; 15: 3-26Crossref Scopus (232) Google Scholar). One of the major signaling events coupled to receptor stimulation is the activation of signal transducers and activators of transcription (STATs). IFN-activated STAT transcription complexes include heterodimers of STAT1 and STAT2 along with a DNA-binding protein of 48 kDa present in the cell cytoplasm (3Uzé G. Lutfalla G. Mogensen K. J. Interferon Cytokine Res. 1996; 15: 3-26Crossref Scopus (232) Google Scholar). This IFN-stimulated gene factor 3 (ISGF3) binds to IFN-sensitive response elements present in the promoter regions of IFN-inducible genes and initiates gene expression (2Stark G. Kerr I.M. Williams B.R.G. Silverman R.H. Schreiber R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 67: 227-264Crossref Scopus (3387) Google Scholar, 3Uzé G. Lutfalla G. Mogensen K. J. Interferon Cytokine Res. 1996; 15: 3-26Crossref Scopus (232) Google Scholar). The mechanism by which activation of the type I IFN receptor leads to STAT activation and gene expression is unclear. It is known that early stages of signaling require IFN-induced receptor heterodimerization of both receptor chains (2Stark G. Kerr I.M. Williams B.R.G. Silverman R.H. Schreiber R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 67: 227-264Crossref Scopus (3387) Google Scholar, 3Uzé G. Lutfalla G. Mogensen K. J. Interferon Cytokine Res. 1996; 15: 3-26Crossref Scopus (232) Google Scholar). However, the mechanism by which STATs and other regulatory proteins interact with the human type I IFN receptor is unclear, despite some emerging evidence of receptor interactive domains. A proposed STAT2 binding site on IFNAR1 has been suggested which includes two phosphorylated tyrosines, Tyr466 and Tyr481, in which an SH2 domain within STAT2 mediates the binding of STAT2 to these sites. For one of these sites, critical residues include not only Tyr466 but also valine +1 and serine+5 carboxyl-terminal to tyrosine 466 (4Krishnan K. Singh B. Krolewski J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19495-19501Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). STAT binding sites on IFNAR2c have also been proposed from in vitro results using glutathione S-transferase-IFNAR2244–462“pull-down” experiments, where both STAT1 and STAT2 have been shown to pre-associate with IFNAR2c, in a manner independent of receptor phosphorylation and dimerization (5Xiaoxia L. Leung S. Kerr I.M. Stark G.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2048-2056Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). This pre-association entails the binding of STAT2 in the absence of STAT1. More recent studies, using mouse L929 cells, have mapped this constitutive binding site for STAT2 to amino acids 404–462 of IFNAR2c (6Nadeau O. Domanski P. Usacheva A. Uddin S. Platanias L.C. Pitha P. Raz R. Levy D. Majchrzak B. Fish E. Colamonici O.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4045-4052Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). In addition to this constitutive site on IFNAR2c, tyrosine phosphorylation of the proximal tyrosines (tyrosines 269, 306, 316, 318, and 336) of IFNAR2c is required, however, it is insufficient by itself, for efficient STAT2 activation (6Nadeau O. Domanski P. Usacheva A. Uddin S. Platanias L.C. Pitha P. Raz R. Levy D. Majchrzak B. Fish E. Colamonici O.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4045-4052Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Therefore, stimulation of mouse cells expressing human IFNAR2c containing only the proximal tyrosines of IFNAR2c or the constitutive docking site with human IFNα2 results in STAT tyrosine phosphorylation, ISGF3 formation, but no antiviral response. Thus, in this case, efficient STAT2 activation requires both constitutive and phosphotyrosine-dependent binding sites on the receptor. To further define the role of IFNAR2c in IFN signaling, we have chosen to express mutated forms of IFNAR2c having specific modifications in its intracellular domain, in a human cell line, U5A, which lacks IFNAR2c (7Lutfalla G. Holland S.J. Cinato E. Monneron D. Reboul J. Rogers N.C. Smith J.M. Stark G.R. Gardiner K. Morgensen K.E. Kerr I.M. Uzé G. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5100-5108Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). In this way, one can directly measure the effects of such mutants on a variety of IFN-inducible responses, in a human cell that contains complementary Janus kinases and STAT proteins in a background devoid of heterologous receptor chains. All cell lines were purchased from American Type Tissue Culture (ATCC) and grown at 37 °C in 5% CO2. HT1080 or U5A cells (provided by Drs. Ian Kerr and George Stark) were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) containing 10% (v/v) bovine calf serum,l-glutamine, and 5% penicillin and streptomycin (Life Technologies, Inc.). U5A cells were obtained as described previously (8Pellegrini S. John J. Shearer M. Kerr I.M. Stark G.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 4605-4612Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). Human IFNβ1b (specific activity = 2.5 × 107 units/mg) was produced as described previously (9Russell-Harde D. Knauf M. Croze E. J.

STAT1, STAT2, TYK2, JAK1, and anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies (Tyr(P)) were purchased from Transduction Laboratories or Santa Cruz Biotechnology. For detection of activated JAK1, a specific antibody that recognizes an amino acid sequence within JAK1 containing the activation-dependent phosphorylated tyrosines 1022 and 1023 (OPA1–03051, Affinity BioReagents) was used. U5A cells (1 × 106 cells/well) were transfected with the corresponding plasmid using Superfectin (11Tang M.X. Redemann C.T. Szoka F.C. Bioconjugate Chem. 1996; 7: 703-714Crossref PubMed Scopus (856) Google Scholar). Plasmids containing a neomycin selection marker, IFNAR2c truncations, and the full intracellular tyrosine to phenylalanine substitutions were constructed as described previously (6Nadeau O.

Multiple stable cell lines for each IFNAR2c mutant were selected in media containing G-418 (1.0 mg/ml). After selection, individual clones were picked and expanded; an integration of each IFNAR2c mutant DNA was determined by polymerase chain reaction using primer sets spanning introns. Positive clones were further expanded and tested for their ability to bind type I IFN. Cell lines expressing IFNAR2c truncation mutants (1 × 107 cells) were solubilized in lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 1% Nonidet P-40 (v/v), 150 mm sodium chloride, 1 mm EDTA, 2.5% glycerol (v/v), 1.0 mm sodium fluoride, 1.0 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1.0 mmphenylmethysulfonyl fluoride, 0.5 μg/ml leupeptin, and 5.0 μg/ml trypsin inhibitor) for 30 min at 4 °C and insoluble material removed by centrifugation. For immunoprecipitation, the indicated antibodies were added to each sample, incubated overnight, mixed with Protein G-agarose (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), and resolved by SDS-PAGE (10% Novex gels). Proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride filters (Pro-Blot) and incubated in blocking buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 0.1% Tween 20 (v/v), 150 mm sodium chloride, 1 mm EDTA, 1.0 mm sodium fluoride, 1.0 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1.0 mm phenylmethysulfonyl fluoride, 0.5 μg/ml leupeptin, and 5.0 μg/ml trypsin inhibitor) overnight at 4 °C, incubated with the appropriate antibody and washed in blocking buffer. Following washing, the membrane was incubated with a specific second antibody (1:1000 dilution) coupled to horseradish peroxidase for 1 h, washed three times in blocking buffer, and developed using a chemiluminescent detection method (Pierce). To reprobe immunoblots, membranes were incubated overnight in 0.01 m sodium citrate, pH 3.0, washed in blocking buffer, and reprobed with the appropriate antibody. A phosphorylated form of IFNα2 was used, and ligand binding assays were performed as described previously (10Croze E. Russell-Harde D. Wagner T.C. Pu H. Pfeffer L.M. Perez D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 33165-33168Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Ligands were phosphorylated (specific activities of 60–62 μCi/μg) as described previously (10Croze E.

Binding data were analyzed according to Scatchard (13Scatchard G. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1965; 51: 660-672Crossref Scopus (17809) Google Scholar). Nonspecific binding was determined in the presence of a 100-fold excess of unlabeled IFN. Gel shift assays were performed using 32P-labeled double-stranded oligonucleotides representing the human 2–5A oligoadenylate synthetase IFN-sensitive response element and the m67SIE element present in the c-fos promoter. Cell were stimulated with IFNα2 (1000 units/106 cells) or IFNβ1b (1000 units/106cells) for 15 min, and cell pellets collected and processed for EMSA as described previously (14Ghislain J.J. Fish E.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12408-12413Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Reaction mixtures were separated by electrophoresis through a 6% polyacrylamide gel and analyzed by autoradiography (14Ghislain J.J. Fish E.N. J. Biol.

Cells were stimulated with human IFNα2 (1000 units/106 cells), IFNβ1b (1000 units/106 cells), or IFNγ (1000 units/106 cells) for 17 h; whole cell pellets collected and processed for TaqMan® analysis as described previously (15Applied Biosystems/Perkin-ElmerTaqMan® Gold RT-PCR Protocol Manual.

Cells were seeded (2 × 104 cells/well) in a 24-well cell culture plate and incubated overnight in either IFNβ1b (1000 units/ml) or IFNα2 (1000 units/ml). At time 0, complete medium containing [3H]thymidine ([methyl-3H]thymidine, specific activity = 40–60 Ci/mmol; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was added and cells harvested at 4, 8, and 12 h. At each time point, cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline followed by, 10% trichloroacetic acid and 100% ethanol. Prior to determining incorporation of radioactivity, cells were solubilized in 1 m potassium hydroxide and mixed with Ecolume scintillation fluid. U5A is a human lung fibrosarcoma cell line that cells lacks IFNAR2c but expresses IFNAR1. Sensitivity to type I IFNs can be restored in U5A cells upon transfection with a plasmid encoding full-length IFNAR2c (7Lutfalla G. Holland S.J. Cinato E. Monneron D. Reboul J. Rogers N.C. Smith J.M. Stark G.R. Gardiner K. Morgensen K.E. Kerr I.M. Uzé G. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5100-5108Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). Therefore, U5A cells provide a human cell line in which mutant forms of IFNAR2c can be used to determine the role of this receptor chain in type I IFN signaling in a human cell background. Using this approach, intracellular truncation mutants of IFNAR2c were stably expressed in U5A cells and multiple cell lines of each clone were analyzed with similar results. Initially, integration of cDNA encoding IFNAR2c mutants was demonstrated in transfected U5A cells by polymerase chain reaction (data not shown). For clones of interest, receptor number and binding affinities were then directly determined (Table I). High affinity binding of type I IFNs to the receptor requires both IFNAR1 and IFNAR2c (17Russell-Harde D. Pu H. Betts M. Harkins R.N. Perez H.D. Croze E. J. Biol.

All cell lines reported here expressed mutant IFNAR2c receptor chains at levels equal to or greater than HT1080 cells, demonstrating that truncations or replacement of all tyrosine residues within the cytoplasmic domain of IFNAR2c, do not affect ligand binding.Table IReceptor number and binding affinityCell typeReceptor numberBinding affinityreceptors/cellpmHT108010,000720 ± 200U5AND–IFNAR2c28,000300 ± 200U5AR2.46228,000325 ± 138U5AR2.41715,000375 ± 200U5AR2.34635,000300 ± 200U5AR2-R2.Y-F35,000425 ± 249Binding affinity and receptor number calculations were determined by Scatchard analysis (13Scatchard G.

IFN-induced receptor dimerization likely leads to conformationally distinct receptor complexes, dependent on the type I IFN subtype (10Croze E. Russell-Harde D. Wagner T.C. Pu H. Pfeffer L.M.

Chem. 1996; 271: 23630-23633Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Such IFN-inducible activation of IFNAR1 and IFNAR2 is independent of the phosphorylation state of the receptor subunits (21Russell-Harde D. Wagner T.C. Perez H.D. Croze E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 255: 539-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Therefore, type I IFN receptor-binding interactions appear to be directly dependent on unique interactions of type I IFNs with the two receptor chains (22Mogensen K.E. Lewerenz M. Reboul J. Lutfalla G. Uzé G. J. Interferon Cytokine Res. 1999; 19: 1069-1098Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). It is assumed that IFN-induced receptor assembly leads to the specific activation of the Janus kinases, TYK2 and JAK1, and the subsequent phosphorylation of both receptor chains. The assembly of both receptor chains initiates activation of these kinases in an IFN-dependent manner. Earlier work has demonstrated a specific association between IFNAR1 and TYK2 and IFNAR2c and JAK1 (18Domanski P. Witte M. Rubinstein M. Hackett R. Pitha P. Colamonici O.R. J. Biol.

Accordingly, to confirm that the various truncations or mutations to IFNAR2 had no effect on TYK2-IFNAR1 function, we examined the extent of IFN-inducible TYK2 activation in transfectants expressing variant IFNAR2c constructs. Our data indicate that IFNAR1 function, at least in the context of IFN-inducible TYK2 activation, is unaffected in transfectants expressing the mutant IFNAR2c constructs, but IFNAR1-associated TYK2 activation is ablated in the U5A cells (Fig.1 A). Similarly, JAK1 activation was also observed in all mutant cell lines expressing IFNAR2c mutants. However, JAK1 activation was not observed in IFN-stimulated U5A cells (Fig. 1 B). Therefore, Janus kinase activation (TYK2 and JAK1) is dependent on receptor dimerization, and does not require the intracellular region distal to residue 346 in IFNAR2c or tyrosine phosphorylation of IFNAR2c. In order to determine the contribution of distinct regions of the intracellular portion of IFNAR2c to STAT recruitment and activation, we examined IFN-inducible STAT1 and STAT2 activation in each of the transfectants expressing mutant IFNAR2c. U5A cells expressing IFNAR2c truncation mutants were stimulated for 15 min with either IFNα2 (1000 units/106 cells) or IFNβ1b (1000 units/106cells) and the level of STAT1 or STAT2 activation determined by measuring the extent of STAT1 or STAT2 tyrosine phosphorylation. In contrast to U5A cells in which IFN-inducible STAT activation does not occur, STAT activation could be completely rescued by expressing full-length IFNAR2c in the U5A cells (Fig.2). Removal of the distal 53 residues (R2.462) from the cytoplasmic region of IFNAR2c (R2c) had no effect on STAT1 or STAT2 activation (Fig. 2). However, further truncation to residue 417 (R2.417) or residue 346 (R2.346) resulted in a complete loss of STAT1 and STAT2 activation, as measured by IFN-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation (Fig. 2). Furthermore, substitution of all tyrosines present in the cytoplasmic domain of IFNAR2c (R2.Y-F) with phenylalanine residues, also resulted in a complete loss of STAT1 and STAT2 activation (Fig. 2). These results suggest an obligatory role for intracellular tyrosine residues and the 417–462 region of IFNAR2c in activation of STAT1 and STAT2. Furthermore, the distal 53 residues of IFNAR2c, which contain a potentially phosphorylatable tyrosine residue at position 512, are apparently not required for STAT activation. Upon IFN stimulation, STAT1 and STAT2 assemble to form the ISFG3 transcription complex (27Schindler C. Darnell J.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 621-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (1656) Google Scholar). Formation of other IFN-dependent STAT containing transcription complexes also occurs, such as those binding to the m67 c-sis-inducible element (SIF) present in the promoter region of the c-fosgene (6Nadeau O. Domanski P. Usacheva A. Uddin S. Platanias L.C. Pitha P. Raz R. Levy D. Majchrzak B. Fish E. Colamonici O.R. J. Biol.

EMBO J. 1990; 9: 4477-4484Crossref PubMed Scopus (554) Google Scholar). IFN-dependent formation of both ISGF3 (Fig.3 A) and SIF (Fig.3 B) complexes were determined for all of the IFNAR2c truncation mutants. Formation of ISGF3 and SIF complexes were observed in response to IFNα2 or IFNβ1b stimulation in HT1080, R2c, and R2.462 cell lines but not in U5A, R2.Y-F, and cells expressing the R2.417 and R2.346 IFNAR2c truncation mutants (Fig. 3, A and B). These results are consistent with observations demonstrating a loss of STAT1 and STAT2 phosphorylation-activation in the R2.Y-F and R2.417 and R2.346 IFNAR2c mutants (Fig. 2). In a recent report, it has been suggested that IFN-inducible STAT complex formation and DNA binding does not necessarily correlate with IFN-inducible transcriptional activation (29Uddin S. Majchrzak B. Woodson J. Arunkumar P. Alsayed Y. Pine R. Young P.R. Fish E.N. Platanias L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30127-30131Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Apparently, following STAT-DNA binding, there is an obligatory event, which is p38-dependent, which is required for transactivation and transcription (29Uddin S. Majchrzak B. Woodson J. Arunkumar P.

Accordingly, we undertook experiments to determine whether any of the mutations introduced into IFNAR2c in the transfectants affected IFN-inducible gene induction. Specifically, IFN-inducible gene expression for known IFN-responsive genes was examined by TaqMan® analysis (15Applied Biosystems/Perkin-ElmerTaqMan® Gold RT-PCR Protocol Manual. Applied Biosystems/Perkin-Elmer, Foster City, CA1997Google Scholar) and RNase protection assays (16Rani M.R.S. Foster G.R. Leung S. Leaman D. Stark G.R. Ransohoff R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22878-22884Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). As shown in Table II, IFN-inducible βR1, ISG 54, and ISG 6–16 gene expression was observed in the HT1080, R2c, and R2.462 cell lines but not in U5A cells expressing the R2.417, R2.346, and R2.Y-F IFNAR2c mutants. A similar pattern of gene expression was observed using RNase protection assays (data not shown). In all cases for which gene expression could be measured, both IFNα2 and IFNβ1b were capable of inducing gene expression, although some variation in gene expression levels was observed depending on whether IFNα2 or IFNβ1b was used. As expected, differential expression of βR1 and ISG-54 was observed in HT1080 cells and to some extent in the R2c and R2.462 cell lines. Consistent with the gel shift data, IFNα- and IFNβ-dependent gene expression was absent in cells expressing IFNAR2c truncation mutants R2.417 or R2.346 and IFNAR2c lacking intracellular tyrosine residues (R2.Y-F).Table IIIFN-dependent gene expressionCell lineβR1ISG 6–16ISG 54IFNβIFNαIFNγIFNβIFNαIFNγIFNβIFNαIFNγHT 10801.540.155117.79.12121.41.481R2c17.722.3110.66.93144.815.01R2.4623.71.35110.610.7179.16.881R2.417<0.01<0.011<2.0<2.01<1.0<1.01R2.346<0.01<0.011<2.0<2.01<1.0<1.01R2.Y-F<0.01<0.011<2.0<2.01NDND1TaqMan® analysis was used to determine the relative expression levels of βR1, ISG 54, and ISG 6–16 in response to IFN stimulation.

ND, not determined. IFN-dependent gene expression leads to a number of important cellular responses such as control of cell growth. Therefore, we examined the effects of the various IFNAR2c mutants on IFN-dependent growth inhibitory effects as measured by short term [3H]thymidine incorporation. Consistent with STAT activation and gene expression studies, IFN-inducible growth inhibition was not observed in the U5A, R2.417, R2.346, and R2.Y-F transfectant cell lines (Fig. 4). However, IFN stimulation of U5A cells expressing IFNAR2c (R2c) or the R2.462 mutant did result in a strong inhibition of [3H]thymidine incorporation (Fig. 4). A similar pattern of antiproliferative effects was observed over a 4–5-day period (data not shown). Studies using identical mutant human IFNAR2c variants expressed in mouse l-929 cells have been reported previously (6Nadeau O. Domanski P. Usacheva A. Uddin S. Platanias L.C. Pitha P. Raz R. Levy D.

Such cells simultaneously express a heterologous combination of both mouse and human type I IFN receptor chains in which the specific response to human IFNs is generally dependent on the absolute species specificity of type I IFNs. Using this approach, two IFN-regulatory regions of IFNAR2c have been reported. These include an IFNβ response region (IBR) located between residues 417–462 (30Domanski P. Nadeau O.W. Platanias L.

Chem. 1998; 273: 3144-3147Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) and a distal negative regulatory domain (31Platanias L.C. Domanski P. Nadeau O. Yi T. Uddin S. Fish E. Neel B.G. Colamonici O.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5577-5581Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Furthermore, a STAT2 binding site was mapped to the 404–462 region of IFNAR2c using glutathioneS-transferase fusion proteins encoding different regions of the intracellular domain (6Nadeau O. Domanski P. Usacheva A. Uddin S. Platanias L.C. Pitha P. Raz R. Levy D. Majchrzak B. Fish E. Colamonici O.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4045-4052Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The existence of an IFNβ response region (IBR) or distal negative regulatory domain was not observed in the current study in human cells due to a complete loss of receptor function in IFNAR2c mutants truncated at residue 417. This is in contrast to results obtained when identical IFNAR2c truncation mutants were stably expressed in mouse L929 cells. In this case, IFNα2-dependent antiviral effects and detectable STAT2 and STAT1 tyrosine phosphorylation were observed in mouse cells expressing IFNAR2c truncated at residues 417 or 346. Furthermore, a negative regulatory effect on cell growth as measured by [3H]thymidine incorporation was not observed for any of the IFNAR2c mutants analyzed in the present study. Only IFNAR2c and the R2.462 truncation mutant expressed in U5A cells were capable of producing an inhibition of [3H]thymidine incorporation upon stimulation with type I IFN. Therefore, a complete loss of receptor function occurs in U5A cells expressing IFNAR2c mutants R2.417, R2.346, and R2.Y-F as measured by STAT1 and STAT2 activation, ISGF3/SIF complex formation, gene expression (βR1, ISG 54, ISG 6–16), and antiproliferative activity. A differential induction of an antiviral state was previously reported for human IFNβ and IFNα2 on murine cells expressing the R2.417 or R2.346 IFNAR2c truncation mutant and wild type IFNAR1 (30Domanski P. Nadeau O.W. Platanias L. Fish E. Kellum M. Pitha P. Colamonici O.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3144-3147Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). However, this observed antiviral activity did not correlated with impaired Janus kinase, STAT1, and STAT2 activation or ISGF3 complex formation. Therefore, the induction of an antiviral state in these cells by human IFNs is likely to require a functional JAK/STAT activation pathway, which is absent in U5A cells expressing similar IFNAR2c truncation mutants. Our data confirm previous results demonstrating the requirement of the 417–462 region of IFNAR2c for STAT activation and receptor function. However, in human cells, this region is absolutely required for receptor function and cannot be compensated for by additional STAT binding sites on either receptor chain. It is likely that, even though in U5A cells expressing IFNAR2c mutants, TYK2 and JAK1 activation occurs in response to type I IFNs, the inability of R2.417, R2.346, and R2.Y-F to induce STAT phosphorylation is due to the inability of these mutants to bind STATs or correctly present them as substrates for activated JAKs. The lack of any STAT activation in human U5A cells, which express IFNAR1, confirms that IFNAR1 on its own is unable to induce downstream signaling events such as STAT activation. In addition, it is interesting to note that, even though the 417–462 region of IFNAR2c was demonstrated to be critical for STAT1 and STAT2 phosphorylation, there are no tyrosine residues within this region. This confirms that the interaction of STATs with this site is independent of tyrosine phosphorylation. Furthermore, the distal tyrosine at residue 512 (Tyr512) is not present in the R2.462 IFNAR2c truncation mutant, demonstrating that Tyr512appears not to be required for IFN-dependent STAT1 and STAT2 activation, transcription complex formation, gene expression, or antiproliferative effects. Species differences in STATs and JAKs have been documented (25Gauzzi M.C. Barbieri G. Richter M.F. Uzé G. Ling L. Fellous M. Pellegrini S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1839-1844Crossref Scopus (105) Google Scholar) and may lead to variations in the way mouse and human cells couple IFN-dependent receptor activation to gene expression. Indeed, the differences in receptor function observed using IFNAR2c mutants expressed in either mouse or human cells is unclear but may be partly due to such species differences. However, it is clear from studies using either human or mouse cells that both phosphotyrosine-dependent and -independent sites exist within the intracellular domain of IFNAR2c, which couple downstream signaling to type I IFN receptor activation. Clearly, our data demonstrate for the first time that differences exist in the manner in which the human and murine IFNAR2c influences IFN-dependent STAT activation. It will now be necessary to determine which phosphotyrosine residues in IFNAR2c are critical for IFN signaling and what role they play in regulating differential type I IFN signaling and gene expression in human cells.

One expressed on β2-μ-associated HLA class I heavy chains has been mapped to amino acid residues 194–198, and the other one expressed on β2-μ-free HLA class I heavy chains has been mapped to amino acid residues 239–242, 245, and 246. The two antigenic determinants have no homology in their amino acid sequence. Since only the x-ray structure of β2-μ-associated HLA class I heavy chain (6Madden D.R. Garboczi D.N. Wiley D.C.

To obtain this information, we have analyzed by NMR the induced solution conformation of the linear X19 peptide and the cyclic LX-8 peptide in the presence of mAb TP25.99. The linear and the cyclic peptides were identified by panning a linear and a cyclic random phage display peptide library with mAb TP25.99, as described in a related paper.2Additionally, both peptides were shown to inhibit the interaction of TP25.99 with both β2-μ-free and β2-μ-associated HLA class I heavy chains with an approximate IC50 of 30 μm. The resulting solution structure of the linear X19 peptide is based on a total of 133 experimental NMR distance restraints where the atomic r.m.s. distribution about the mean coordinate position for residues 4–13 is 0.87 ± 0.13 Å for the backbone atoms. The resulting solution structure of the cyclic LX-8 is based on a total of 50 experimental NMR distance restraints where the atomic r.m.s. distribution about the mean coordinate position for residues 3–10 is 0.78 ± 0.22 Å for the backbone atoms. We thank Roger French for the probability analysis of the sequence match between the peptides and HLA class I heavy chain α3 domain."
