https://openalex.org/W3200136047,"Abstract SARS-CoV-2 messenger RNA vaccination in healthy individuals generates immune protection against COVID-19. However, little is known about SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccine-induced responses in immunosuppressed patients. We investigated induction of antigen-specific antibody, B cell and T cell responses longitudinally in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) on anti-CD20 antibody monotherapy ( n = 20) compared with healthy controls ( n = 10) after BNT162b2 or mRNA-1273 mRNA vaccination. Treatment with anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody (aCD20) significantly reduced spike-specific and receptor-binding domain (RBD)-specific antibody and memory B cell responses in most patients, an effect ameliorated with longer duration from last aCD20 treatment and extent of B cell reconstitution. By contrast, all patients with MS treated with aCD20 generated antigen-specific CD4 and CD8 T cell responses after vaccination. Treatment with aCD20 skewed responses, compromising circulating follicular helper T (T FH ) cell responses and augmenting CD8 T cell induction, while preserving type 1 helper T (T H 1) cell priming. Patients with MS treated with aCD20 lacking anti-RBD IgG had the most severe defect in circulating T FH responses and more robust CD8 T cell responses. These data define the nature of the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine-induced immune landscape in aCD20-treated patients and provide insights into coordinated mRNA vaccine-induced immune responses in humans. Our findings have implications for clinical decision-making and public health policy for immunosuppressed patients including those treated with aCD20."
https://openalex.org/W3199923482,"A smaller-dose jab does the job Low-dose messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccines potentially allow health providers to administer more doses from a limited vaccine supply and can be less reactogenic. Whether low-dose COVID-19 mRNA vaccines generate immune responses comparable to currently approved doses remains an open question, however. Mateus et al . report the results of a clinical trial comparing patients who received a 25-μg mRNA-1273 (Moderna) COVID-19 vaccine to 100-μg mRNA-1273 COVID-19 vaccinees and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2–infected individuals. The low-dose Moderna vaccine generated long-lived T cell immunity that was equivalent between younger and older patients and that could be enhanced by the presence of cross-reactive T cells. Moreover, antibody and T cell responses induced by the low-dose vaccine were comparable to natural infection and about half as strong as those seen with high-dose vaccination. —STS"

Here we show that SARS-CoV-2, like other viruses, evokes cellular senescence as a primary stress response in infected cells. Virus-induced senescence (VIS) is indistinguishable from other forms of cellular senescence and is accompanied by a senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP), which comprises pro-inflammatory cytokines, extracellular-matrix-active factors and pro-coagulatory mediators5-7. Patients with COVID-19 displayed markers of senescence in their airway mucosa in situ and increased serum levels of SASP factors. In vitro assays demonstrated macrophage activation with SASP-reminiscent secretion, complement lysis and SASP-amplifying secondary senescence of endothelial cells, which mirrored hallmark features of COVID-19 such as macrophage and neutrophil infiltration, endothelial damage and widespread thrombosis in affected lung tissue1,8,9. Moreover, supernatant from VIS cells, including SARS-CoV-2-induced senescence, induced neutrophil extracellular trap formation and activation of platelets and the clotting cascade. Senolytics such as navitoclax and a combination of dasatinib plus quercetin selectively eliminated VIS cells, mitigated COVID-19-reminiscent lung disease and reduced inflammation in SARS-CoV-2-infected hamsters and mice. Our findings mark VIS as a pathogenic trigger of COVID-19-related cytokine escalation and organ damage, and suggest that senolytic targeting of virus-infected cells is a treatment option against SARS-CoV-2 and perhaps other viral infections."
https://openalex.org/W3200931843,"The heartbeat is initiated by voltage-gated sodium channel NaV1.5, which opens rapidly and triggers the cardiac action potential; however, the structural basis for pore opening remains unknown. Here, we blocked fast inactivation with a mutation and captured the elusive open-state structure. The fast inactivation gate moves away from its receptor, allowing asymmetric opening of pore-lining S6 segments, which bend and rotate at their intracellular ends to dilate the activation gate to ∼10 Å diameter. Molecular dynamics analyses predict physiological rates of Na+ conductance. The open-state pore blocker propafenone binds in a high-affinity pose, and drug-access pathways are revealed through the open activation gate and fenestrations. Comparison with mutagenesis results provides a structural map of arrhythmia mutations that target the activation and fast inactivation gates. These results give atomic-level insights into molecular events that underlie generation of the action potential, open-state drug block, and fast inactivation of cardiac sodium channels, which initiate the heartbeat."

https://openalex.org/W3199420529,"African swine fever virus (ASFV) is a large DNA virus that is highly contagious and pathogenic in domestic pigs with a mortality rate up to 100%. However, how ASFV suppresses JAK-STAT1 signaling to evade the immune response remains unclear. In this study, we found that the ASFV-encoded protein MGF-505-7R inhibited proinflammatory IFN-γ-mediated JAK-STAT1 signaling. Mechanistically, MGF-505-7R was found to interact with JAK1 and JAK2 and mediate their degradation. Further study indicated that MGF-505-7R promoted degradation of JAK1 and JAK2 by upregulating the E3 ubiquitin ligase RNF125 expression and inhibiting expression of Hes5, respectively. Consistently, MGF-505-7R-deficient ASFV induced high levels of IRF1 expression and displayed compromised replication both in primary porcine alveolar macrophages and pigs compared with wild-type ASFV. Furthermore, MGF-505-7R deficiency attenuated the virulence of the ASFV and pathogenesis of ASF in pigs. These findings suggest that the JAK-STAT1 axis mediates the innate immune response to the ASFV and that MGF-505-7R plays a critical role in the virulence of the ASFV and pathogenesis of ASF by antagonizing this axis. Thus, we conclude that deletion of MGF-505-7R may serve as a strategy to develop attenuated vaccines against the ASFV."

https://openalex.org/W3199156848,"Pre-emptive school closures are frontline community mitigation measures recommended by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) for implementation during severe pandemics. This study describes the spatiotemporal patterns of publicly announced school closures implemented in response to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic and assesses how public K-12 districts adjusted their methods of education delivery and provision of subsidized meals. During February 18–June 30, 2020, we used daily systematic media searches to identify publicly announced COVID-19–related school closures lasting ≥1 day in the United States (US). We also collected statewide school closure policies from state government websites. Data on distance learning and subsidized meal programs were collected from a stratified sample of 600 school districts. The first COVID-19–associated school closure occurred on February 27, 2020 in Washington state. By March 30, 2020, all but one US public school districts were closed, representing the first-ever nearly synchronous nationwide closure of public K-12 schools in the US. Approximately 100,000 public schools were closed for ≥8 weeks because of COVID-19, affecting &gt;50 million K-12 students. Of 600 districts sampled, the vast majority offered distance learning (91.0%) and continued provision of subsidized meal programs (78.8%) during the closures. Despite the sudden and prolonged nature of COVID-19–associated school closures, schools demonstrated flexibility by implementing distance learning and alternate methods to continue subsidized meal programs."
https://openalex.org/W3200409129,"An emerging mechanism of ubiquitylation involves partnering of two distinct E3 ligases. In the best-characterized E3-E3 pathways, ARIH-family RING-between-RING (RBR) E3s ligate ubiquitin to substrates of neddylated cullin-RING E3s. The E3 ARIH2 has been implicated in ubiquitylation of substrates of neddylated CUL5-RBX2-based E3s, including APOBEC3-family substrates of the host E3 hijacked by HIV-1 virion infectivity factor (Vif). However, the structural mechanisms remained elusive. Here structural and biochemical analyses reveal distinctive ARIH2 autoinhibition, and activation on assembly with neddylated CUL5-RBX2. Comparison to structures of E3-E3 assemblies comprising ARIH1 and neddylated CUL1-RBX1-based E3s shows cullin-specific regulation by NEDD8. Whereas CUL1-linked NEDD8 directly recruits ARIH1, CUL5-linked NEDD8 does not bind ARIH2. Instead, the data reveal an allosteric mechanism. NEDD8 uniquely contacts covalently linked CUL5, and elicits structural rearrangements that unveil cryptic ARIH2-binding sites. The data reveal how a ubiquitin-like protein induces protein-protein interactions indirectly, through allostery. Allosteric specificity of ubiquitin-like protein modifications may offer opportunities for therapeutic targeting."
https://openalex.org/W3200960148,"Purpose The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has caused many children to stay indoors. Increased near work and insufficient outdoor activities are considered important risk factors for myopic progression. This study aimed to compare the changes in myopic progression before and after COVID-19 in children treated with low-concentration atropine. Methods The records of 103 eyes of 103 children who were treated with low-concentration atropine eye drops were retrospectively reviewed. We classified children according to the concentration of atropine eye drops and children’s age. The beginning of the pre-COVID-19 period was set from January 2019 to May 2019, and the endpoint was set in March 2020. The beginning of the post-COVID-19 period was set in March 2020, and the endpoint was set from January 2021 to March 2021. We evaluated the questionnaires administered to children’s parents. Results A significant myopic progression was observed in the post-COVID-19 period compared to the pre-COVID-19 period in the 0.05% and 0.025% atropine groups (P &lt; 0.001 and P = 0.020, respectively). For children aged 5 to 7 and 8 to 10 years, the axial elongations were significantly faster in the post-COVID-19 period than in the pre-COVID-19 period (P = 0.022 and P = 0.005, respectively). However, the rates of axial elongation and myopic progression were not significantly different between pre- and post-COVID-19 in children aged 11 to 15 years (P = 0.065 and P = 0.792, respectively). The average time spent using computers and smartphones and reading time were significantly increased, and the times of physical and outdoor activity were significantly decreased in the post-COVID-19 period compared to the pre-COVID-19 period. Conclusions The rates of myopic progression have increased substantially after the spread of COVID-19 with an increase in the home confinement of children. Therefore, it is necessary to control the environmental risk factors for myopia, even in children undergoing treatment for the inhibition of myopic progression."
https://openalex.org/W3201137649,"Bycatch mortality is a major factor contributing to shark population declines. Post-release mortality (PRM) is particularly difficult to quantify, limiting the accuracy of stock assessments. We paired blood-stress physiology with animal-borne accelerometers to quantify PRM rates of sharks caught in a commercial bottom longline fishery. Blood was sampled from the same individuals that were tagged, providing direct correlation between stress physiology and animal fate for sandbar ( Carcharhinus plumbeus , N = 130), blacktip ( C . limbatus , N = 105), tiger ( Galeocerdo cuvier , N = 52), spinner ( C . brevipinna , N = 14), and bull sharks ( C . leucas , N = 14). PRM rates ranged from 2% and 3% PRM in tiger and sandbar sharks to 42% and 71% PRM in blacktip and spinner sharks, respectively. Decision trees based on blood values predicted mortality with &gt;67% accuracy in blacktip and spinner sharks, and &gt;99% accuracy in sandbar sharks. Ninety percent of PRM occurred within 5 h after release and 59% within 2 h. Blood physiology indicated that PRM was primarily associated with acidosis and increases in plasma potassium levels. Total fishing mortality reached 62% for blacktip and 89% for spinner sharks, which may be under-estimates given that some soak times were shortened to focus on PRM. Our findings suggest that no-take regulations may be beneficial for sandbar, tiger, and bull sharks, but less effective for more susceptible species such as blacktip and spinner sharks."
https://openalex.org/W3199389769,"Objectives The purpose of this study was to examine the time course of changes in the range of motion and muscle-tendon unit stiffness of the hamstrings after two different intensities of static stretching. Methods Fourteen healthy men (20.9 ± 0.7 years, 169.1 ± 7.5cm, 61.6 ± 6.5kg) received static stretching for 60 seconds at two different intensities based on the point of discomfort (100%POD and 120%POD) of each participant, in random order. To evaluate the time course of changes in the flexibility of the hamstrings, the knee extension range of motion (ROM), passive torque at end ROM, and muscle-tendon unit stiffness were measured pre-stretching, post-stretching, and at both 10 and 20 minutes after static stretching. Results For both intensities, ROM and passive torque at pre-stretching were significantly smaller than those at post-stretching (p &lt; 0.01 in both intensities), 10 minutes (p &lt; 0.01 in both intensities), and 20 minutes (p &lt; 0.01 in both intensities). The muscle-tendon unit stiffness at pre-stretching was significantly higher than that at post-stretching (p &lt; 0.01), 10 minutes (p &lt; 0.01), and 20 minutes (p &lt; 0.01) only in the 120%POD, but it showed no change in the 100%POD. Conclusion The results showed that ROM and passive torque increased in both intensities, and the effects continued for at least 20 minutes after stretching regardless of stretching intensity. However, the muscle-tendon unit stiffness of the hamstrings decreased only after static stretching at the intensity of 120%POD, and the effects continued for at least 20 minutes after stretching."
https://openalex.org/W3200256638,"The reclassification of membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis (MPGN) into immune-complex MPGN (IC-MPGN) and C3 glomerulopathy (C3G) based on immunofluorescence findings in kidney biopsies has provided insights into these two distinct diseases. C3G is further classified into dense deposit disease and C3 glomerulonephritis (C3GN) based on electron micrographic findings. Although these diseases have poor outcomes, limited Japanese literature confined to small, single-center cohorts exist on these diseases. We retrospectively analyzed 81 patients with MPGN type I and III from 15 hospitals in the Japan Renal Biopsy Registry to compare demographic, clinical characteristics and treatment outcomes of patients with IC-MPGN to those with C3GN. Of the 81 patients reviewed by immunofluorescence findings in kidney biopsies, 67 patients had IC-MPGN and 14 patients had C3GN. Age at diagnosis and systolic and diastolic pressure were higher and proteinuria and impaired renal function were significantly more prevalent in patients with IC-MPGN than those with C3GN. About 80% of the patients in both groups were treated with immunosuppressive therapy. At last follow-up (median 4.8 years), complete remission rate of proteinuria was significantly higher in patients with C3GN (64.3%) than in those with IC-MPGN (29.9%; P = 0.015). The renal survival rate was lower in patients with IC-MPGN when compared to C3GN (73.1% vs. 100%; log-rank, P = 0.031). Systolic blood pressure and renal function at baseline were independent predictors of progression to end-stage kidney disease. The overall prognosis of patients with C3GN is more favorable than for patients with IC-MPGN."
https://openalex.org/W3199423142,"Autophagosome-lysosome pathway (ALP) insufficiency has been suggested to play a critical role in the pathogenesis of cardiac hypertrophy. However, the mechanisms underlying ALP insufficiency remain largely unknown, and strategies to specifically manipulate ALP insufficiency for treating cardiac hypertrophy are lacking. Transcription factor EB (TFEB), as a master regulator of ALP, regulates the generation and function of autophagosomes and lysosomes. We found that TFEB was significantly decreased, whereas autophagosome markers were increased in phenylephrine (PE)-induced and transverse aortic constriction-induced cardiomyocyte hypertrophy and failing hearts from patients with dilated cardiomyopathy. Knocking down TFEB induced ALP insufficiency, as indicated by increased autophagosome markers, decreased light chain 3II flux, and cardiomyocyte hypertrophy manifested through increased levels of atrial natriuretic peptide and β-myosin heavy chain and enlarged cell size. The effects of TFEB knockdown were abolished by promoting autophagy. TFEB overexpression improved autophagic flux and attenuated PE-stimulated cardiomyocyte hypertrophy and transverse aortic constriction-induced hypertrophic remodeling, fibrosis, and cardiac dysfunction. Curcumin analog compound C1, a specific TFEB activator, similarly attenuated PE-induced ALP insufficiency and cardiomyocyte hypertrophy. TFEB knockdown increased the accumulation of GATA4, a transcription factor for several genes causing cardiac hypertrophy by blocking autophagic degradation of GATA4, whereas knocking down GATA4 attenuated TFEB downregulation-induced cardiomyocyte hypertrophy. Both TFEB overexpression and C1 promoted GATA4 autophagic degradation and alleviated PE-induced cardiomyocyte hypertrophy. In conclusion, TFEB downregulation plays a vital role in the development of pressure overload-induced cardiac hypertrophy by causing ALP insufficiency and blocking autophagic degradation. Activation of TFEB represents a potential therapeutic strategy for treating cardiac hypertrophy."

https://openalex.org/W3200351600,"Dengue is hyperendemic in most Southeast Asian countries including Thailand, where all four dengue virus serotypes (DENV-1 to -4) have circulated over different periods and regions. Despite dengue cases being annually reported in all regions of Thailand, there is limited data on the relationship of epidemic DENV infection between humans and mosquitoes, and about the dynamics of DENV during outbreaks in the northeastern region. The present study was conducted in this region to investigate the molecular epidemiology of DENV and explore the relationships of DENV infection in humans and in mosquitoes during 2016–2018. A total of 292 dengue suspected patients from 11 hospitals and 902 individual mosquitoes (at patient’s houses and neighboring houses) were recruited and investigated for DENV serotypes infection using PCR. A total of 103 patients and 149 individual mosquitoes were DENV -positive. Among patients, the predominant DENV serotypes in 2016 and 2018 were DENV-4 (74%) and DENV-3 (53%) respectively, whereas in 2017, DENV-1, -3 and -4 had similar prevalence (38%). Additionally, only 19% of DENV infections in humans and mosquitoes at surrounding houses were serotypically matched, while 81% of infections were serotypically mismatched, suggesting that mosquitoes outside the residence may be an important factor of endemic dengue transmission. Phylogenetic analyses based on envelope gene sequences showed the genotype I of both DENV-1 and DENV-4, and co-circulation of the Cosmopolitan and Asian I genotypes of DENV-2. These strains were closely related to concurrent strains in other parts of Thailand and also similar to strains in previous epidemiological profiles in Thailand and elsewhere in Southeast Asia. These findings highlight genomic data of DENV in this region and suggest that people’s movement in urban environments may result in mosquitoes far away from the residential area being key determinants of DENV epidemic dynamics."
https://openalex.org/W3200476002,"The human AAA+ ATPase p97, also known as valosin-containing protein, a potential target for cancer therapeutics, plays a vital role in the clearing of misfolded proteins. p97 dysfunction is also known to play a crucial role in several neurodegenerative disorders, such as MultiSystem Proteinopathy 1 (MSP-1) and Familial Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS). However, the structural basis of its role in such diseases remains elusive. Here, we present cryo-EM structural analyses of four disease mutants p97R155H, p97R191Q, p97A232E, p97D592N, as well as p97E470D, implicated in resistance to the drug CB-5083, a potent p97 inhibitor. Our cryo-EM structures demonstrate that these mutations affect nucleotide-driven allosteric activation across the three principal p97 domains (N, D1, and D2) by predominantly interfering with either (1) the coupling between the D1 and N-terminal domains (p97R155H and p97R191Q), (2) the interprotomer interactions (p97A232E), or (3) the coupling between D1 and D2 nucleotide domains (p97D592N, p97E470D). We also show that binding of the competitive inhibitor, CB-5083, to the D2 domain prevents conformational changes similar to those seen for mutations that affect coupling between the D1 and D2 domains. Our studies enable tracing of the path of allosteric activation across p97 and establish a common mechanistic link between active site inhibition and defects in allosteric activation by disease-causing mutations and have potential implications for the design of novel allosteric compounds that can modulate p97 function.

Berger J.M. Evolutionary relationships and structural mechanisms of AAA+ proteins.Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol.

Freemont P.S. The AAA+ ATPase p97, a cellular multitool.Biochem. J. 2017; 474: 2953-2976Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). A common thread among these applications is the recruitment of numerous cofactors to process ubiquitinated substrates, through the generation of mechanical energy from ATP hydrolysis. Critical functions for p97 include the translocation and restructuring of proteins from large cellular structures such as organelle membranes and extraction of ubiquitinated client proteins to facilitate their degradation through the ubiquitin-proteasome system. In this role, p97 recruits ubiquitin-binding cofactors to denature ubiquitinated substrates by pulling the polypeptide through the central pore (3Cooney I. Han H. Stewart M.G. Carson R.H. Hansen D.T.

Cryo-EM analyses of full-length p97 in the substrate-free form have established the overall organization of N, D1, and D2 domains (Fig. 1A) in three distinct quaternary conformations that correspond to distinct nucleotide occupancies of the D1 and D2 nucleotide-binding sites (Fig. 1B) (5Banerjee S. Bartesaghi A. Merk A. Rao P. Bulfer S.L. Yan Y. Green N. Mroczkowski B. Neitz R.J. Wipf P. Falconieri V. Deshaies R.J. Milne J.L.S. Huryn D.

Conformation I is observed when ADP is bound to both the D1 and D2 domains, while conformation II is observed when ADP in the D2-binding site is exchanged with ATPγS, which is a slowly hydrolyzable ATP analog to preserve the ATP-bound structure for cryo-EM analysis. Relative to conformation I, there is a rotational twist of the D2 domain with relatively minimal changes in the D1 and N domains. Conformation III is observed when ATPγS is bound to both D1 and D2 nucleotide-binding sites and results in substantial tertiary and quaternary structural rearrangements in the D1 and N domains. The N-domain in conformation III adopts a distinct “up” position, enabling its binding to endogenous cofactors required for subsequent substrate binding and processing. The nucleotide occupancy in these three conformational states is consistent with the higher affinity of the D1 domain for both ADP and ATP ligands relative to the D2 domain, with a ∼40-fold lower KD in D1 relative to D2, as measured by Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR) experiments (6Bulfer S.L.

However, substrate binding results in the conversion of the hexameric arrangement to a spiral arrangement of the six protomers similar to the quaternary conformation observed for most other members of the AAA+ ATPase family (3Cooney I.

Still, other mutations in the D1-D2 linker are implicated in cancer drug resistance (15Bastola P. Wang F. Schaich M.A. Gan T. Freudenthal B.D. Chou T.F. Chien J.

A central unanswered question in understanding the origin of the disease phenotype is whether the functional consequences can be traced to mutation-induced alterations in protein structure. Prior structural information on p97 mutants largely comes from X-ray crystallographic studies of N-D1 truncated p97 constructs (16Tang W.K. Xia D.

Here, we have examined full-length forms of five p97 mutants: three were chosen for their relatively high incidence in the p97-related neurodegenerative disorder MSP-1 (R155H, R191Q, A232E), one for its relatively unusual position in the D2 domain in p97 and its role in familial ALS (D592N), and one for its identification in resistance to the drug CB-5083 (E470D) (15Bastola P.

Our experiments with these mutants were designed to explore the extent to which the mutations influence the conformational landscape. While p97 is amenable to structural analysis in both substrate-free forms and in the presence of bound protein substrates and cofactors, we chose to study substrate-free complexes since our goal is to unravel the intrinsic effects of the mutations on quaternary structure. Previous studies have shown that the primary effect of MSP-1 mutations is in the transition between conformations (I-III) rather than directly on the hydrolytic domains (6Bulfer S.L. Chou T.F.

We also report cryo-EM structures of full-length wild-type p97 complexed to CB-5083 in the presence of ADP and ATPγS and describe how the binding of the inhibitor influences the overall quaternary arrangement of the N, D1, and D2 domains. Taken together, our results provide a detailed understanding of the structural mechanisms underlying the effects of the disease mutations and an explanation of the resistance of the E470D mutation to inhibition by CB-5083. All five mutants displayed relative ATPase activities similar to previously reported biochemical studies (Figs. 1C and S1A) (12Niwa H. Ewens C.A. Tsang C. Yeung H.O. Zhang X. Freemont P.S.

An ALS disease mutation in Cdc48/p97 impairs 20S proteasome binding and proteolytic communication.Protein Sci. 2015; 24: 1521-1527Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The structural effects of the mutations on p97 structure as determined by cryo-EM studies fall into two distinct categories where the differences in behavior relative to p97WT are observed in the presence of bound ADP but not ATPγS (Fig. 1D) or in the presence of bound ATPγS but not ADP (Fig. 1E). These effects are described in greater detail below. In the p97R191Q, p97R155H, and p97A232E mutants, the primary variation in conformational outcome as compared with p97WT is observed when the D1 and D2 domains are both occupied by ADP (Fig. 1D). In these mutants, the ADP-bound conformation of the D1 domain displays many of the structural signatures observed only upon ATPγS binding to p97WT, suggesting that these mutations shift the conformational equilibrium toward promoting ATP binding. This effect is most readily visible in p97R191Q, with p97R155H and p97A232E displaying similar effects in the D1 domain, but of a smaller magnitude (Figs. 2, A–C, S1, B–D and S2A). R155 is located at the N-D1 interface in the ADP-bound state making contacts with polar residues from the N-D1 domain (20Tang W.K. Li D. Li C.C. Esser L. Dai R. Guo L. Xia D. A novel ATP-dependent conformation in p97 N-D1 fragment revealed by crystal structures of disease-related mutants.EMBO J. 2010; 29: 2217-2229Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2B). Mutation to histidine may disrupt interactions resulting in greater flexibility of the N-domain, consistent with disorder in this domain, observed as a decrease in local resolution in the N-domain cryo-EM density. This finding is consistent with previously published NMR studies where the N-domain flexibility, i.e., exchange between “up” and “down” conformations in the ADP-bound state, is inversely proportional to the charged/hydrogen bonding nature of the residues at position 155 (17Schuetz A.K. Kay L.E. A dynamic molecular basis for malfunction in disease mutants of p97/VCP.Elife. 2016; 5e20143Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). R191 is located at the start of the linker connecting the N and D1 domains (Figs. 1A and 2), surrounded by negatively charged residues, in particular E195 (Fig. 2, B and D). R191 may stabilize the “down” position of the N-domain by maintaining an extended loop conformation in the linker. A unique aspect of the mutation-induced structural changes in the ADP-bound state of p97R191Q is a dramatic ordering of the linker connecting the N and D1 domains into an α-helical structure between residues 190–199 (Figs. 2B and S1A). This structural ordering is observed in p97WT only when ATPγS is bound to the D1 domain, which arises from changes propagated at the other side of the linker proximal to the D1 nucleotide-binding site. The dramatic shift from extended linker to an α-helix upon loss of charge by mutation from arginine to glutamine appears to confirm the vital role R191 plays in stabilizing the “down” position in the N-domain of p97WT. Further inspection of the structure of p97R191Q in the ADP-bound state shows a shift in the local conformation of the loop region between K425 and L445 of the D1 domain that is located at the junction between the N and D1 domains (Figs. 2E and S1B). The change in the structure of this loop is such that it is close to the conformation observed for this region in p97WT upon the occupancy of the D1 nucleotide-binding site with ATPγS. Residue A232 is located at the interface between two p97 protomers, and the introduction of the glutamate at this position will result in steric repulsion (Fig. 2B) separating the putative hydrogen bonding residues T127 and T436 of the N and D1 domains of the adjacent monomer, respectively (Fig. S1C). This disruption likely accounts for the increased flexibility of the N-domain and also results in a shift similar to that of p97R191Q in the loop region between K425 and L445 of the D1 domain adjacent to the E232 residue (Figs. 2B and S1D). Of note, a T127A mutation has been reported in an individual with FTD (21Shi Z. Liu S. Xiang L. Wang Y. Liu M. Liu S. Han T. Zhou Y. Wang J. Cai L. Gao S. Ji Y. Frontotemporal dementia-related gene mutations in clinical dementia patients from a Chinese population.J. Hum. Genet. 2016; 61: 1003-1008Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), further suggesting the importance of this hydrogen-bonding interaction for the function of p97. Despite varying degrees of differences in the ADP-bound state as compared with p97WT, all three mutants display essentially similar structures when the D1 and D2 domains are bound to ATPγS and in the state corresponding to conformation III of p97WT (Fig. S3, A–D) (5Banerjee S. Bartesaghi A. Merk A. Rao P. Bulfer S.L. Yan Y. Green N. Mroczkowski B. Neitz R.J. Wipf P. Falconieri V. Deshaies R.J. Milne J.L.S. Huryn D. Arkin M. et al.2.3 Å resolution cryo-EM structure of human p97 and mechanism of allosteric inhibition.Science. 2016; 351: 871-875Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). This is not surprising since R155, R191, and A232 are all exposed to solvent in conformation III, i.e., no longer interacting at the N-D1 interface; therefore the mutations at these sites are not expected to affect the quaternary conformation significantly. The effect of the ATPγS-driven conformational change is especially noteworthy in the case of the p97R155H mutant because the upward movement of the N-domain results in the displacement of R155 by ∼25 Å to a solvent exposed face of the protein, away from the N-D1 interface. In the ATPγS-bound state, p97R155H and other N-D1 mutants with similar phenotypes may have an effect on cofactor or substrate binding since it is in close proximity to the site where cofactors are expected to interact with p97 (22Hänzelmann P. Schindelin H. The interplay of cofactor interactions and post-translational modifications in the regulation of the AAA+ ATPase p97.Front. Mol. Biosci. 2017; 4: 21Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Indeed, the p97R155H mutant has been found to have altered responses relative to p97WT when bound to either p47 or p37 cofactors (23Zhang X. Gui L. Zhang X. Bulfer S.L. Sanghez V. Wong D.E. Lee Y.J. Lehmann L. Lee J.S. Shih P.Y. Lin H.J. Iacovino M. Weihl C.C. Arkin M.R. Wang Y. et al.Altered cofactor regulation with disease-associated p97/VCP mutations.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2015; 112: E1705-E1714Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). In contrast to the mutants discussed above, in the p97E470D and p97D592N mutants, minimal structural differences are observed as compared with p97WT when the D1 and D2 domains are occupied by ADP (Fig. S4). However, when bound to ATPγS, in contrast to displaying the dramatic quaternary structural changes observed in p97WT, the predominant conformation displayed in these two mutants is one in which the N-terminal domain is in the “down” position in a state most closely resembling conformation II of p97WT (Figs. 3 and S1E). These results imply that the mutations decouple ATPγS binding in the D1 domain from inducing the structural rearrangement of N domain from the “down” to “up” conformation. Although we would expect the E470D mutation to have minimal effects because of the conservative substitution, residue 470 is located at a critical juncture between the D1 and D2 domains. This major effect highlights the structural role of this side chain in maintaining the network of interactions by which the structural changes in the D2 domain are communicated to the D1 domain. D592 is located in the pore loop region of the hexamer at the inter-protomer interface (Fig. 1C), indicating that interactions distal to the D1-D2 interface can also influence the coupling between these domains. As observed during the activity assays, the p97E470D and p97D592N mutants differ in terms of their effects on ATPase activity (Fig. 1C). This suggests that p97E470D stimulates increased ATPase activity in the D2 domain, possibly by removing the requirement for ATP binding to the D1 domain for D2 hydrolysis, whereas this intra-protomer D1-D2 communication across the linker is maintained in the p97D592N mutant. CB-5083 is a potent inhibitor of p97 function, with an IC50 of ∼10 nM (24Zhou H.J. Wang J. Yao B. Wong S. Djakovic S. Kumar B. Rice J. Valle E. Soriano F. Menon M.K. Madriaga A. Kiss Von Soly S. Kumar A. Parlati F. Yakes F.M. et al.Discovery of a first-in-class, potent, selective, and orally bioavailable inhibitor of the p97 AAA ATPase (CB-5083).J. Med. Chem. 2015; 58: 9480-9497Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). The binding site of CB-5083 to the D2 domain was characterized in a previous X-ray crystallographic study using p97 truncated to only contain the D1 and D2 domains p97D1D2 structure determined at a resolution of 3.75 Å (25Tang W.K. Odzorig T. Jin W. Xia D. Structural basis of p97 inhibition by the site-selective anticancer compound CB-5083.Mol. Pharmacol. 2019; 95: 286-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). In order to assess the effect of CB-5083 binding in the context of full-length protein, we carried out cryo-EM studies of p97WT bound to CB-5083 in the presence of either ADP or ATPγS. The cryo-EM structure of the ADP- CB-5083- p97WT complex resolved at an overall resolution 2.5 Å allows unambiguous positioning of CB-5083 in the D2 domain. The inhibitor is held in place by a combination of polar interactions mediated through its terminal amide side chain and central quinazoline scaffold, and nonpolar interactions involving the pendant phenyl group. The tertiary and quaternary structures of the D1 and D2 domains remain the same under both conditions, demonstrating that when CB-5083 is bound to the D2 domain, the conformation of the D1 domain is locked and unresponsive to either the presence or the identity of the bound nucleotide. Importantly, the N-domain is in the “down” position when either ADP or ATPγS occupies the D1 nucleotide-binding site (Figs. 4A and S2B). Notably, the vast majority of p97 particles bound to CB-5083 were in the dodecameric state, regardless of D1 nucleotide occupancy (Figs. S15 and S16); this state is often observed only in the ADP-bound p97WT structures but not in the ATPγS-bound structures, further supporting the observation that the CB-5083-bound D2 domain is locked in conformation I. In this respect, the effect of CB-5083 binding is similar to that observed for the E470D and D592N mutants, where the conformation of the N and D1 domains is unchanged with binding of either ADP or ATPγS (Fig. 4B). However, unlike these mutants, CB-5083-bound p97WT is locked in conformation I and retains the same tertiary structure in the D2 domain as that seen for ADP-bound p97. CB-5083, as an ATP-competitive inhibitor, can exert its effects on p97 function by blocking the allosteric conformational changes required for transition from conformation I to conformation II (Fig. 4C). The same step is blocked by the phenyl indole-based allosteric inhibitor UPCDC-30245, which binds p97 distal to the nucleotide binding site, but prevents the transition to conformation II because of a steric block of the conformational change in the D2 domain by the bound inhibitor (5Banerjee S. Bartesaghi A. Merk A. Rao P. Bulfer S.L. Yan Y. Green N. Mroczkowski B. Neitz R.J. Wipf P. Falconieri V. Deshaies R.J. Milne J.L.S. Huryn D. Arkin M. et al.2.3 Å resolution cryo-EM structure of human p97 and mechanism of allosteric inhibition.Science. 2016; 351: 871-875Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). A detailed inspection of the interactions in the nucleotide-binding pocket provides an explanation for the effects observed with CB-5083 binding. As shown in Figure 4D, the interactions of the two phosphate moieties in ADP are confined to a single nucleotide-binding domain, but when ATPγS is bound, the third (gamma) phosphate moiety is involved in H-bonding interactions with R766 and R635 in the neighboring protomer. These additional interactions explain why ATPγS binding initiates the sequence of quaternary structural changes via interactions at the inter-protomer interface. Although CB-5083 binding site overlaps with the nucleotide-binding site of the D2 domain and shares interactions with some of the residues that interact with ADP/ATP, the key inter-protomer interaction between R766 and the γ-phosphate of ATP is missing in the CB-5083-bound structure, preventing the generation of the type of quaternary conformational changes seen upon ATPγS binding to p97WT. The cryo-EM structural studies presented here allow us to propose a structural model for the observed increase in ATPase activity of MSP-1 related p97 mutants. Our results demonstrate that the effects of the N-D1 mutations are mediated chiefly through the destabilization of the N domain in the ADP-bound state, either through a loss of interdomain interactions in p97R155H and p97R191Q or through inter-protomer steric effects in p97A232E. We expect that the primary effect of the N-D1 mutants on p97 is a disruption in cofactor recruitment in-vivo, due to the shift in the conformational equilibrium toward the N domain “up” state. This is supported by previous biochemical and NMR analysis (17Schuetz A.K. Kay L.E.

Leaders played an important role in shaping the experiences of Health Care Workers (HCWs) during this time. However, research is needed on how HCWs experienced and characterized HCLs’ response and support. The aim of our study was to examine HCWs’ experiences with leadership and to identify aspects of HCLs’ response that were effective in supporting HCWs in their roles during the early phases of the pandemic. This was a qualitative study based on open-ended semi-structured interviews conducted (June 1- July 18, 2020) with frontline HCWs during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in Connecticut, USA. Participants (N = 45) included physicians, nurses, respiratory therapists and patient care assistants who worked in inpatient and outpatient settings in various specialties, roles and 3 health systems across Connecticut, USA during the COVID-19 pandemic. Participants were offered a $25 gift card as an incentive for participation. We used inductive techniques derived from grounded theory to develop themes. We identified 6 main themes related to leadership response and support of HCWs during the pandemic namely: 1) Effective communication and transparency; 2) Prioritizing their health and safety; 3) Employee scheduling considerations: autonomy, assignment support and respite; 4) Appreciation- financial and nonfinancial; 5) Showing up and listening and 6) Stepping up with resources. Our findings can inform leadership responses to future pandemics and other unanticipated crises leading to strengthening of the health care system as a whole."

In the human colorectal carcinoma cell line, HCT116, many genes implicated in the metabolic activities that are modulated by c-Myc have been reported to be downregulated following treatment with the DNA methyltransferase inhibitor, 5-Aza-CdR (17Yang X.

In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patient samples, hypermethylated gene bodies are associated with increased expression levels of oncogenes (19Arechederra M. Daian F. Yim A. Bazai S.K. Richelme S.

Commun. 2018; 9: 3164Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Moreover, locus-specific remethylation of hypomethylated gene body regions of homeobox oncogenes can directly increase their expression (20Su J. Huang Y.-H. Cui X. Wang X. Zhang X. Lei Y. Xu J.

Hence, gene body methylation may function as a positive regulator of transcription; nevertheless, the molecular mechanism underlying its regulation remains to be clarified. Ribosomal RNA (rRNA) is a crucial component of ribosomes and is involved in the control of protein synthesis, of which transcriptional regulation is responsive to alterations in physiological and pathological activities (21Henderson A.

DNA methyltransferases and histone-modifying enzymes have been extensively studied with respect to their regulation of rDNA expression. In short, methylated promoters abolish rDNA transcription by inhibiting the assembly of the transcription initiation complex (24Santoro R. Grummt I. Molecular mechanisms mediating methylation-dependent silencing of ribosomal gene transcription.Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 719-725Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Moreover, cryptic rDNA transcripts, including long noncoding RNAs and intergenic spacer (IGS) transcripts, promote the establishment of H4K20me3, thereby forming a heterochromatin structure and suppressing rDNA transcription (25Mayer C.

Notably, it was hypothesized that depletion of DNMTs would enhance rDNA transcription; however, knockout of DNMTs actually leads to a reduction in the global methylation status across rDNA repeats, including promoters and gene bodies, and inconsistent changes in pre-rRNA synthesis measured by different methods, prompting us to investigate the relationship of hypomethylation and rDNA transcription and underlying mechanisms (27Espada J.

Plant homeodomain (PHD) finger protein 6 (PHF6) is an X-linked gene encoding a highly conserved protein possessing two atypical PHD zinc finger domains, in which a variety of mutations have been identified and shown to be associated with X-linked mental retardation (XLMR), Börjeson–Forssman–Lehmann syndrome (BFLS; OMIM 301900) (29Lower K.M.

PHF6 bidirectionally modulates gene expression in leukemic cells, since it maintains chromatin accessibility at B cell-associated genes but forms a repressive conformation at T cell-related genes (32Meacham C.E.

PHF6 regulates phenotypic plasticity through chromatin organization within lineage-specific genes.Genes Dev. 2017; 31: 973-989Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Additionally, PHF6 is involved in the control of neuronal migration by physically interacting with the PAF1 transcription elongation complex to regulate schizophrenia susceptibility genes (34Zhang C. Mejia L.A. Huang J. Valnegri P. Bennett E.J. Anckar J. Jahani-Asl A. Gallardo G. Ikeuchi Y. Yamada T. Rudnicki M. Harper J.W. Bonni A.

Moreover, PHF6 is highly enriched at rDNA gene bodies compared with promoters and inhibits rDNA transcription by reducing the levels of upstream binding factor (UBF) and directly interacting with UBF via its PHD1 domain to impede its release from the rDNA promoter (35Wang J. Leung J.W. Gong Z. Feng L. Shi X. Chen J. PHF6 regulates cell cycle progression by suppressing ribosomal RNA synthesis.J. Biol. Chem. 2013; 288: 3174-3183Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 36Todd M.A. Huh M.S. Picketts D.J. The sub-nucleolar localization of PHF6 defines its role in rDNA transcription and early processing events.Eur. J. Hum. Genet. 2016; 24: 1453-1459Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). However, as a potential chromatin reader protein, the question of whether PHF6 is able to regulate rDNA transcription by altering chromatin signatures at rDNA gene body regions remains unanswered. As previously highlighted, gene body methylation appears to be correlated with active rDNA transcription, while H4K20me3 is a well-known histone modification that strongly inhibits rDNA transcription; therefore, it is of great interest to investigate the regulatory mechanism of gene body methylation and its opposite effect to H4K20me3 on rDNA transcription. In the present study, we show that gene body methylation secures rDNA transcription by preventing the recruitment of the epigenetic regulator, PHF6, which guides the histone methyltransferase, SUV4-20H2, to establish H4K20me3 in gene body regions. Loss of gene body DNA methylation induces increased occupancy of PHF6 at gene bodies due to its capability to bind to unmethylated CpG sites. Coimmunoprecipitation and gain-of-function assays reveal that PHF6 can interact with SUV4-20H2 and subsequently establish H4K20me3 marks, which indicate a more compact chromatin structure in gene body regions, thus suppressing rDNA transcription. In conclusion, these findings suggest a gene body methylation-based epigenetic cross talk among PHF6, SUV4-20H2, and the histone modification, H4K20me3, in the regulation of rDNA transcription. Previous studies have revealed different effects of hypomethylation caused by DNMTs deficiency on rDNA transcription (27Espada J. Ballestar E. Santoro R. Fraga M.F. Villar-Garea A. Nemeth A. Lopez-Serra L. Ropero S. Aranda A. Orozco H. Epigenetic disruption of ribosomal RNA genes and nucleolar architecture in DNA methyltransferase 1 (Dnmt1) deficient cells.Nucleic Acids Res. 2007; 35: 2191-2198Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 28Gagnon-Kugler T.

Cell. 2009; 35: 414-425Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). In view of the fact that gene knockout may lead to side effects by artificial interference with gene expression and nontargets, the functional correlation between hypomethylation and rDNA transcription needs to be verified under physiological conditions. To this end, a C2C12 myoblast differentiation and serum deprivation system was employed, during which rDNA transcription was biologically downregulated (26Bierhoff H. Dammert M.A. Brocks D. Dambacher S. Schotta G. Grummt I. Quiescence-induced LncRNAs trigger H4K20 trimethylation and transcriptional silencing.Mol. Cell. 2014; 54: 675-682Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Myotubes were formed by incubation of myoblasts with 2% horse serum for 6 days (Fig. 1A), and a high level of Myogenin (Myog) expression was detected correspondingly (Fig. 1B). Fluorouridine (FUrd) was used to pulse-label the nascent rRNA for the detection of pre-rRNA synthesis. We found that pre-rRNA synthesis markedly decreased during the differentiation of C2C12 myoblasts into myotubes (Fig. 1, C and D). Further analysis of the rDNA methylation status by methylated DNA immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing (MeDIP-seq) revealed a reduction in the DNA methylation level in both the rDNA promoter and gene body regions (Fig. 1, E and F). Despite the decreased DNA methylation levels in promoter, the pre-rRNA synthesis was reduced, suggesting a positive correlation between the gene body methylation status and rDNA transcription. Next, we further monitored this correlation in cells with serum deprivation treatment. The pre-rRNA synthesis in serum-deprived HEK293T cells was measured by real-time quantitative reverse transcription PCR (RT-qPCR) and northern blotting, and we found that rDNA transcription was markedly reduced in HEK293T cells following serum deprivation compared with those cultured under normal conditions (Fig. 1, G and H). Intriguingly, a dramatic decrease in the level of gene body methylation was seen in serum-deprived HEK293T cells, comparing with those cultured under normal conditions (Fig. 1, I and J). Notably, the promoter methylation level remained unchanged regardless of the altered nutrient state (Fig. 1, K and L). These findings indicate that maintenance of gene body methylation is positively correlated with rDNA transcription. To dissect the mechanism underlying the positive correlation between gene body methylation and rDNA transcription, we therefore depleted DNA methyltransferases in HEK293T cells using the CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing technique to determine the methyltransferase responsible for rDNA gene body regions. Previously, the catalytically inactive isoform DNMT3B3 has been shown to be the dominant isoform, with little to no expression of catalytically active DNMT3B1 in somatic cells (37Liao J. Karnik R. Gu H. Ziller M.J. Clement K. Tsankov A.M. Akopian V. Gifford C.A. Donaghey J. Galonska C. Targeted disruption of DNMT1, DNMT3A and DNMT3B in human embryonic stem cells.Nat. Genet. 2015; 47: 469-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). Loss of DNMT3B does not alter the methylation status in colorectal cancer cells (27Espada J. Ballestar E. Santoro R. Fraga M.F. Villar-Garea A. Nemeth A. Lopez-Serra L. Ropero S. Aranda A. Orozco H. Epigenetic disruption of ribosomal RNA genes and nucleolar architecture in DNA methyltransferase 1 (Dnmt1) deficient cells.Nucleic Acids Res. 2007; 35: 2191-2198Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Indeed, we found that DNMT3B was undetectable by western blotting in HEK293T cells (Fig. S1A), and knockout of DNMT3B did not affect rDNA gene body methylations status (Fig. S1, B and C). Furthermore, our previous work has proved that there was almost no change in methylation levels at gene bodies in DNMT3A KO cells compared with wild-type cells (38Lyu G. Zong L. Zhang C. Huang X. Xie W. Fang J. Guan Y. Zhang L. Ni T. Gu J. Tao W. Metastasis-related methyltransferase 1 (Merm1) represses the methyltransferase activity of Dnmt3a and facilitates RNA polymerase I transcriptional elongation.J. Mol. Cell Biol. U. S. A. 2018; 11: 78-90Crossref Scopus (1) Google Scholar). Considering that DNMT1 deficiency in colorectal cancer cells causes hypomethylation in rDNA gene bodies, whereas loss of DNMT3B does not alter the methylation status (27Espada J. Ballestar E. Santoro R. Fraga M.F. Villar-Garea A. Nemeth A. Lopez-Serra L. Ropero S. Aranda A. Orozco H. Epigenetic disruption of ribosomal RNA genes and nucleolar architecture in DNA methyltransferase 1 (Dnmt1) deficient cells.Nucleic Acids Res. 2007; 35: 2191-2198Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar), we speculated that DNMT1 may also be responsible for rDNA gene body methylation. Subsequent genome bisulfite sequencing assays showed that the gene body methylation level was reduced in DNMT1 KO cells compared with that in wild-type cells (Figs. S1D and 2, A and B). These results suggest that DNMT1 is the primary methyltransferase for the maintenance of rDNA gene body methylation. To elucidate whether DNMT1 is involved in the regulation of rDNA transcription, we pulse-labeled cocultured DNMT1 KO and wild-type HEK293T cells with FUrd. As expected, despite decreases in DNA methylation levels in promoters (Fig. S1, E and F), DNMT1 deletion led to a marked reduction in pre-rRNA synthesis (Fig. 2, C and D). Moreover, the decreased pre-rRNA level in DNMT1 KO cells was rescued through DNMT1 overexpression (Fig. 2E). These results suggest that DNMT1 is required for rDNA transcription. In accordance with this result, both the mRNA and protein levels of DNMT1 were decreased in differentiated myotubes, comparing with those in myoblasts (Fig. 2F). Subsequently, chromatin immunoprecipitation assays followed by real-time quantitative PCR (ChIP-qPCR) showed a decline in the binding of DNMT1 to gene body regions (Fig. 2G). Similarly, we found that serum deprivation led to a decrease in both the mRNA and protein levels of DNMT1 along with its reduced occupancy at gene bodies (Fig. 2, H and I). And ectopic expression of DNMT1 in serum-starved HEK293T cells rescued the previous loss of methylation in rDNA gene body (Fig. S2). Overall, these results indicate that DNMT1-mediated rDNA gene body methylation is positively associated with the regulation of rDNA transcription. Next, we explored the mechanism of DNMT1 in rDNA transcription regulation. In view of the cross talk between DNA methylation and histone modifications, we assessed the enrichment of several histone modifications (i.e., H3K9me3, H3K27me3, H3K36me3, and H4K20me3) at rDNA gene bodies in DNMT1-depleted cells. The results showed that DNMT1 deficiency results in significant increase in H4K20me3 enrichment in rDNA gene body regions while the occupancy of other histone modifications remains unchanged (Figs. 3A and S3A), which is consistent with the findings that H4K20me3 represses rDNA transcription (26Bierhoff H. Dammert M.A. Brocks D. Dambacher S. Schotta G. Grummt I. Quiescence-induced LncRNAs trigger H4K20 trimethylation and transcriptional silencing.Mol.

Oncol. 2017; 50: 1372-1382Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). To further confirm that DNMT1-mediated gene body methylation opposed the enrichment of H4K20me3 to regulate rDNA transcription, we then depleted the major methyltransferases involved with H4K20me3, SUV4-20H1/H2 (designated as SUV4-20H), in HEK293T cells. Since the efficient antibodies for human SUV4-20H1/H2 were not commercially available, H4K20me3 protein levels were used as an indicator for the knockout of SUV4-20H1/H2. Indeed, knockout of SUV4-20H led to a marked decrease in both the abundance of the H4K20me3 protein and its enrichment in rDNA gene body regions (Fig. 3, B and C). FUrd incorporation followed by immunofluorescence microscopy showed that loss of SUV4-20H increased the fluorescence signal, which is indicative of upregulated pre-rRNA synthesis (Fig. 3D). Accordingly, reverse transcription PCR experiments also showed augmented pre-rRNA synthesis in SUV4-20H knockout cells (Fig. 3E). Moreover, we found that depletion of SUV4-20H neither affected the DNA methylation level (Fig. 3, F and G) nor changed the occupancy of DNMT1 (Fig. S3B) in gene body regions. These results demonstrate that DNMT1 opposes H4K20me3 enrichment in rDNA gene body regions. In addition, triple knockout of DNMT1, SUV4-20H1, and SUV4-20H2 led to a reduction of pre-rRNA synthesis compared with that in HEK293T cells (Figs. S3C and 3H), but a significant increase in rDNA transcription compared with that in DNMT1 KO cells (Fig. 3I), suggesting that hypomethylation of rDNA gene bodies leads to rDNA transcriptional silencing, in part, due to an increase in H4K20me3 enrichment at gene bodies. Taken together, these results suggest that DNMT1-mediated gene body methylation is positively associated with rDNA transcription by antagonizing H4K20me3. Previous evidence as well as our findings showed that PHF6 was localized in the nucleolus and inhibited rDNA transcription (Fig. S4, A–C) (35Wang J. Leung J.W. Gong Z. Feng L. Shi X. Chen J.

PHF6 has two PHD-like domains, suggesting that it is a potential histone modification reader. To test this hypothesis, we performed peptide binding assays in vitro, the result revealed that PHF6 could bind to repressive histone modifications, such as H3K9me3, H3K27me3, and H4K20me3 (Fig. 4A). In addition, PHF6 has also been shown to physically interact with subunits of the NuRD complex, such as HDAC1 in the nucleoplasm (41Todd M.A.M. Picketts D.J.

To explore the regulatory role of PHF6 in histone modifications enrichments, we first assessed the occupancies of different histone modifications (i.e., H3K4me3, H3K9me2, H3K9me3, H3K27me3, and H4K20me3), in PHF6 KO and wild-type cells. The results showed that PHF6 deficiency resulted in declined enrichments of repressive histone modifications, including H4K20me3, at rDNA gene bodies but not in promoter regions, which is of most interest to us (Fig. 4B, Fig. S4D). Meanwhile, lack of PHF6 gave rise to increased occupancy of Pol Ⅰ at gene bodies (Fig. S4E). Next, we explore the distribution of PHF6 in rDNA repeat units using four pairs of primers, each of which was aligned to IGS, promoters, 18S and 28S (Fig. 4C, upper panel), respectively. In accordance with a previous report (36Todd M.A. Huh M.S. Picketts D.J. The s"

Here, we address this by applying precision nuclear run-on sequencing and the assay for transposase-accessible chromatin sequencing to measure nascent transcription and chromatin accessibility in airway epithelial cells after wood smoke particle (WSP) exposure. We used transcription factor enrichment analysis to identify temporally distinct roles for ternary response factor-serum response factor complexes, the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR), and NFκB in regulating transcriptional changes induced by WSP. Transcription of canonical targets of the AHR, such as CYP1A1 and AHRR, was robustly increased after just 30 min of WSP exposure, and we discovered novel AHR-regulated pathways and targets including the DNA methyltransferase, DNMT3L. Transcription of these genes and associated enhancers rapidly returned to near baseline by 120 min after exposure. The kinetics of AHR- and NFκB-regulated responses to WSP were distinguishable based on the timing of both transcriptional responses and chromatin remodeling, with induction of several cytokines implicated in maintaining NFκB-mediated responses through 120 min of exposure. In aggregate, our data establish a direct and primary role for AHR in mediating airway epithelial responses to WSP and identify crosstalk between AHR and NFκB signaling in controlling proinflammatory gene expression. This work also defines an integrated genomics-based strategy for deconvoluting multiplexed transcriptional responses to heterogeneous environmental exposures."
https://openalex.org/W3199564943,"Although they represent the cornerstone of analgesic therapy, opioids, such as morphine, are limited in efficacy by drug tolerance, hyperalgesia and other side effects. Activation of microglia and the consequent production of proinflammatory cytokines play a key pathogenic role in morphine tolerance, but the exact mechanisms are not well understood. This study aimed to investigate the regulatory mechanism of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) on microglial activation induced by morphine in mouse microglial BV-2 cells. In this research, BV-2 cells were stimulated with morphine or pretreated with AG1478 (an inhibitor of EGFR). Expression levels of cluster of differentiation molecule 11b (CD11b), EGFR, and phospho-EGFR were detected by immunofluorescence staining. Cell signaling was assayed by Western blot. The migration ability of BV-2 cells was tested by Transwell assay. The production of interleukin-1beta (IL-1β) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) in the cell supernatant was determined by ELISA. We observed that the expression of CD11b induced by morphine was increased in a dose- and time- dependent manner in BV-2 cells. Phosphorylation levels of EGFR and ERK1/2, migration of BV-2 cells, and production of IL-1β and TNFα were markedly enhanced by morphine treatment. The activation, migration, and production of proinflammatory cytokines in BV-2 cells were inhibited by blocking the EGFR signaling pathway with AG1478. The present study demonstrated that the EGFR/ERK signaling pathway may represent a novel pharmacological strategy to suppress morphine tolerance through attenuation of microglial activation."
https://openalex.org/W3200736897,"Objective Although Problematic Internet Use (PIU) is an emerging area of study in psychology, little is known about the unique features of specific subgroups of internet users and their psychosocial vulnerabilities within robust and nationwide populations. Methods The aim of this study was to identify distinct latent groups of internet users based on their PIU risk and to compare their psychosocial outcomes. To achieve this, a nationally representative sample of adolescents of the same grade ( N = 1,066, Mean age = 13.46 years, range = 12–16) was recruited from several schools in Slovenia through stratified random sampling. Results A Latent Profile Analysis (LPA) revealed a two-class solution, with Class 1 ( n = 853, 80%) featuring ‘ low PIU risk ’ participants and Class 2 ( n = 213, 20%) including ‘ high PIU risk ’ participants. Behaviorally, the main feature of Class 1 denoted ‘ time management difficulties ’ while Class 2 was best characterized by ‘ mood and time management issues ’. Further frequentist and Bayesian analyses indicated that Class 2 presented greater psychosocial risk compared to Class 1 due to significantly higher levels of PIU (generalized and across specific PIU subfactors) coupled with lower levels of subjective well-being and self-control. Conclusions Contrary to what was initially envisaged, the two classes did not differ in terms of perceived quality in parent-child relationship. This study shows that PIU patterns and symptom-severity may be developmentally specific, further highlighting the need for clinically age-adjusted PIU screening practices within epidemiological and healthcare settings."
https://openalex.org/W3201224237,"αB-crystallin is a small heat shock protein that forms a heterooligomeric complex with αA-crystallin in the ocular lens. It is also widely distributed in tissues throughout the body and has been linked with neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s, where it is associated with amyloid fibrils. Crystallins can form amorphous aggregates in cataracts as well as more structured amyloid-like fibrils. The arginine 120 to glycine (R120G) mutation in αB-crystallin ( Cryab -R120G) results in high molecular weight crystallin protein aggregates and loss of the chaperone activity of the protein in vitro , and it is associated with human hereditary cataracts and myopathy. Characterizing the amorphous (unstructured) versus the highly ordered (amyloid fibril) nature of crystallin aggregates is important in understanding their role in disease and important to developing pharmacological treatments for cataracts. We investigated protein secondary structure in wild-type (WT) and Cryab -R120G knock-in mutant mouse lenses using two-dimensional infrared (2DIR) spectroscopy, which has been used to detect amyloid-like fibrils in human lenses and measure UV radiation-induced changes in porcine lenses. Our goal was to compare the aggregated proteins in this mouse lens model to human lenses and evaluate the protein structural relevance of the Cryab -R120G knock-in mouse model to general age-related cataract disease. In the 2DIR spectra, amide I diagonal peak frequencies were red-shifted to smaller wavenumbers in mutant mouse lenses as compared to WT mouse lenses, consistent with an increase in ordered secondary structure. The cross peak frequency and intensity indicated the presence of amyloid in the mutant mouse lenses. While the diagonal and cross peak changes in location and intensity from the 2DIR spectra indicated significant structural differences between the wild type and mutant mouse lenses, these differences were smaller than those found in human lenses; thus, the Cryab -R120G knock-in mouse lenses contain less amyloid-like secondary structure than human lenses. The results of the 2DIR spectroscopy study confirm the presence of amyloid-like secondary structure in Cryab -R120G knock-in mice with cataracts and support the use of this model to study age-related cataract."
https://openalex.org/W3201298802,"Background Face masks, also referred to as half masks, are essential to protect healthcare professionals working in close contact with patients with COVID-19-related symptoms. Because of the Corona material shortages, healthcare institutions sought an approach to reuse face masks or to purchase new, imported masks. The filter quality of these masks remained unclear. Therefore, the aim of this study was to assess the quality of sterilized and imported FFP2/KN95 face masks. Methods A 48-minute steam sterilization process of single-use FFP2/KN95 face masks with a 15 minute holding time at 121°C was developed, validated and implemented in the Central Sterilization Departments (CSSD) of 19 different hospitals. Masks sterilized by steam and H 2 O 2 plasma as well as new, imported masks were tested for particle filtration efficiency (PFE) and pressure drop in a custom-made test setup. Results The results of 84 masks tested on the PFE dry particle test setup showed differences of 2.3±2% (mean±SD). Test data showed that the mean PFE values of 444 sterilized FFP2 face masks from the 19 CSSDs were 90±11% (mean±SD), and those of 474 new, imported KN95/FFP2 face masks were 83±16% (mean±SD). Differences in PFE of masks received from different sterilization departments were found. Conclusion Face masks can be reprocessed with 121 °C steam or H 2 O 2 plasma sterilization with a minimal reduction in PFE. PFE comparison between filter material of sterilized masks and new, imported masks indicates that the filter material of most reprocessed masks of high quality brands can outperform new, imported face masks of unknown brands. Although the PFE of tested face masks from different sterilization departments remained efficient, using different types of sterilization equipment, can result in different PFE outcomes."

Availability of reliable antibacterial consumption (ABC) data is a prerequisite to implement this strategy.To quantify and describe the national ABC in Sri Lanka and to examine any differences in the consumption between public and private sector.The methodology for this survey was adapted from World Health Organization (WHO) methodology for a global programme on surveillance of antimicrobial consumption. Aggregate data on national consumption of systemic antibacterials (J01- Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical Classification (ATC) for 2017 were retrospectively extracted from all available data sources and classified using ATC classification. Quantity of consumption was converted to Defined Daily Doses (DDDs). Data are presented as total consumption and comparison between the public and private sector. Selected key quality indicators of ABC were compared between these two sectors.From the available data sources, the total ABC in 2017 was 343.46 million DDDs. Private sector consumption accounted for 246.76 million DDDs compared to 97.96 million DDDs distributed to entire public sector by the Ministry of Health. Beta-lactam-penicillins antibacterial group accounted for 58.79% in public sector compared to 27.48% in private sector while macrolides, quinolones and other beta-lactam antibacterials accounted for 60.51% in the private compared to 28.41% in public sector. Consumption of Reserve group antibacterials was negligible, and limited to private sector. Watch category antibacterials accounted for 46%, 24% and 54% of the total, public and private sector consumption, respectively.A disproportionately higher use of broad spectrum and Watch category antibacterials was observed in the private sector which needs further study. This national consumption survey highlights the need and provides the opening for establishment of ABC surveillance in Sri Lanka."
https://openalex.org/W3162035541,"The bilingual language control literature generally assumes that cross-language interference resolution relies on inhibition of the non-target language. A similar approach has been taken in the bidialectal language control literature. However, there is little evidence along these lines for proactive language control, which entails a control process that is implemented as an anticipation of any cross-language interference. To further investigate the possibility of proactive inhibitory control, we examined the effect of language variety preparation time, by manipulating the cue-to-stimulus interval, on parallel language activation, by manipulating cognate status. If proactive language control relies on inhibition, one would expect less parallel language activation (i.e., a smaller cognate facilitation effect) with increased proactive inhibitory control (i.e., a long cue-to-stimulus interval). This was not the case with either bilinguals or bidialectals. So, the current study does not provide evidence for proactive inhibitory control during bilingual and bidialectal language production."
https://openalex.org/W3199545576,"Introduction Stair falls can be caused by inconsistent stair dimensions. During ascent, inconsistently taller stair risers lead to reduced foot clearances as the inconsistency goes unnoticed. A stair horizontal-vertical illusion increases perceived riser heights and foot clearance and could offset reduced foot clearances over inconsistently taller risers, though this might impact other stair safety measures. Method Twelve participants (age: 22 (3) years) ascended a seven-step staircase under three conditions: i) all steps consistent in riser height (consistent), ii) a 1cm increase in step 5 riser height (inconsistent) and iii) a 1cm increase in step 5 riser height, superimposed with a stair horizontal-vertical illusion (illusion). Vertical foot clearance, foot overhang, and margins of stability were assessed over step 4, 5 and 6. Perceived riser height due to the illusion was determined through a computer perception test. A One-Way Repeated Measures ANOVA compared biomechanical variables between conditions. A One Sample t test compared perceived riser height to the true height. Results Over the inconsistent step 5, foot clearance reduced by 0.8cm compared to consistent. Illusion increased foot clearance by 1.1cm and decreased foot overhang by 4% compared to inconsistent. On step 4 the illusion led to more anterior instability compared to inconsistent. Illusion and inconsistent led to more mediolateral stability compared to consistent. The illusion increased perceived riser height by 12%. Discussion Foot clearance reductions over inconsistently taller risers can be offset by a stair horizontal-vertical illusion. Additional benefits included a safer foot overhang and unaffected stability over the inconsistent riser. Changes to step 4 stability might have resulted from leaning forward to look at the step 5 illusion. The stair horizontal-vertical illusion could be a practical solution for inconsistently taller stair risers, where a rebuild is usually the only solution."
https://openalex.org/W3199743679,"The 2016 Iranian Census reveals that 14 of the country’s 31 provinces have sub-replacement fertility. The province of Tehran, where a woman on average gives birth to 1.5 children during her reproductive period, has the lowest fertility in Iran. However, the ‘two-child’ norm prevails in the country and even a woman of young reproductive age still values having at least two children on average. In other words, there exists a gap between a woman’s actual and desired fertility. This paper examines the demographic and socio-economic factors influencing the gap between actual and desired fertility in Tehran city based on a sample survey of 400 married women aged 15–49 years, conducted in 2015. The findings of the study reveal that the women of Tehran would be able to meet their fertility desires of two or more children if they were able to achieve their intended number of children they stated in the survey. However, should these women face any socio-economic constraint, they would be very likely to restrain their fertility desires and have fewer additional children than they initially intended, and thus continue with the sub-replacement fertility as being observed in Iran today."
https://openalex.org/W3200141367,"Accumulation of α-synuclein is a main underlying pathological feature of Parkinson's disease and α-synucleinopathies, for which lowering expression of the α-synuclein gene (SNCA) is a potential therapeutic avenue. Using a cell-based luciferase reporter of SNCA expression we performed a quantitative high-throughput screen of 155,885 compounds and identified A-443654, an inhibitor of the multiple functional kinase AKT, as a potent inhibitor of SNCA. HEK-293 cells with CAG repeat expanded ATXN2 (ATXN2-Q58 cells) have increased levels of α-synuclein. We found that A-443654 normalized levels of both SNCA mRNA and α-synuclein monomers and oligomers in ATXN2-Q58 cells. A-443654 also normalized levels of α-synuclein in fibroblasts and iPSC-derived dopaminergic neurons from a patient carrying a triplication of the SNCA gene. Analysis of autophagy and endoplasmic reticulum stress markers showed that A-443654 successfully prevented α-synuclein toxicity and restored cell function in ATXN2-Q58 cells, normalizing the levels of mTOR, LC3-II, p62, STAU1, BiP, and CHOP. A-443654 also decreased the expression of DCLK1, an inhibitor of α-synuclein lysosomal degradation. Our study identifies A-443654 and AKT inhibition as a potential strategy for reducing SNCA expression and treating Parkinson's disease pathology."
https://openalex.org/W3200255436,"Histone deacetylase 3 (HDAC3) plays an important role in signal-dependent transcription and is dysregulated in diseases such as cancer. Previous studies have shown that the function of HDAC3 requires an activation step, which is mediated by the interactions of HDAC3 with the deacetylase-activation domain (DAD) of nuclear receptor corepressors and inositol tetraphosphate (IP4). However, the role of the unique HDAC3 C-terminal region in HDAC3 activation is elusive. Here multiple biochemical, structural, and functional studies show that HDAC3 activation requires a priming step mediated by the C terminus to remodel HDAC3 conformation. We show that multiple C-terminal mutations prevent HDAC3 activation by preventing this C terminus-dependent conformational change. Mechanistically, we demonstrate that the C terminus-mediated function in altering HDAC3 conformation is required for proper complex formation of HDAC3 with DAD and IP4 by allowing HDAC3 to undergo IP4-dependent interaction with DAD. Remarkably, we found that this C terminus function is conformation dependent, being necessary for HDAC3 activation prior to but not after the conformational change. Together, our study defines two functional states of free HDAC3, reveals the complete HDAC3 activation pathway, and links the C terminus function to the specific interaction between HDAC3 and DAD. These results also have implications in how signaling pathways may converge on the C terminus to regulate HDAC3 and suggest that the C terminus-mediated conformational change could represent a new target for inhibiting HDAC3 in diseases such as cancer."
https://openalex.org/W3200591898,"Obesity and diabetes have strong heritable components, yet the genetic contributions to these diseases remain largely unexplained. In humans, a missense variant in Creb3 regulatory factor (CREBRF) [rs373863828 (p.Arg457Gln); CREBRFR457Q] is strongly associated with increased odds of obesity but decreased odds of diabetes. Although virtually nothing is known about CREBRF's mechanism of action, emerging evidence implicates it in the adaptive transcriptional response to nutritional stress downstream of TORC1. The objectives of this study were to generate a murine model with knockin of the orthologous variant in mice (CREBRFR458Q) and to test the hypothesis that this CREBRF variant promotes obesity and protects against diabetes by regulating energy and glucose homeostasis downstream of TORC1. To test this hypothesis, we performed extensive phenotypic analysis of CREBRFR458Q knockin mice at baseline and in response to acute (fasting/refeeding), chronic (low- and high-fat diet feeding), and extreme (prolonged fasting) nutritional stress as well as with pharmacological TORC1 inhibition, and aging to 52 weeks. The results demonstrate that the murine CREBRFR458Q model of the human CREBRFR457Q variant does not influence energy/glucose homeostasis in response to these interventions, with the exception of possible greater loss of fat relative to lean mass with age. Alternative preclinical models and/or studies in humans will be required to decipher the mechanisms linking this variant to human health and disease."
https://openalex.org/W3200879707,"Objectives To examine similarities and dissimilarities in patient and family caregiver dyads in their experience of stress, support, and sense of security. Methods 144 patients and their family caregivers participated. Patients were admitted to six Swedish specialist palliative home care units and diagnosed with a non-curable disease with an expected short survival. We analysed similarity patterns of answers within dyads (correlations) as well as dissimilarities, expressed as the difference between within-dyad responses. The latter were subjected to a model-building procedure using GLM, with 13 sociodemographic and clinical characteristics as independent variables. Results Within dyads, patients and family caregivers scored similar in their perception of support and sense of security with care. There was also dissimilarity within dyad responses in their perception of stress and support that could be attributed to sociodemographic or clinical characteristics. When patients scored higher levels of stress than family caregivers, the family caregiver was more likely to be male. Also family caregiver attachment style (attachment anxiety), patient age and the relationship of the family caregiver to the patient explained dissimilarities within the dyads. Conclusions Patients and family caregivers within the dyads often, but not always, had similar scores. We suggest that it is important that the healthcare staff identify situations in which perceptions within the dyads regarding stress and perception of support differ, such that they can recognise patients’ and family caregivers’ unique needs in different situations, to be able to provide adequate support and facilitate dyadic coping."
https://openalex.org/W3199105769,"With ongoing improvements in vehicle automation, research on automation trust has attracted considerable attention. In order to explore effects of automation trust on drivers’ visual distraction, we designed a three-factor 2 (trust type: high trust group, low trust group) × 2 (video entertainment: variety-show videos, news videos) × 3 (measurement stage: 1–3) experiment. 48 drivers were recruited in Dalian, China for the experiment. With a driving simulator, we used detection-response tasks (DRT) to measure each driver’s performance. Their eye movements were recorded, and automation-trust scale was used to divide participants into high trust group and low trust group. The results show that: (1) drivers in the high trust group has lower mental workload and paid more attention to visual non-driving-related tasks; (2) video entertainment also has an impact on distraction behavior, variety-show videos catch more attention than news videos. The findings of the present study indicate that drivers with high automation trust are more likely to be involved in non-driving-related visual tasks."
https://openalex.org/W3199769853,"Among tennis coaches and players, the standard volley and drop volley are considered basically similar, but muscles need to be relaxed (deactivation) just at the moment of impact when hitting the drop volley. However, this is not evidence-based. The aim of this study was to clarify racket head trajectory and muscle activity during the drop volley and to compare them with those of the standard volley. We hypothesized that 1) the racket head would move less forward for the drop volley than for the standard volley and 2) the wrist and elbow muscles be relaxed for the drop volley at the time of ball impact. Eleven male college students with sufficient tennis experience volunteered to participate in this study. Wireless EMG sensors recorded activation of the four arm muscles. Each subject performed the standard volley or the drop volley with both a forehand and a backhand from a position near the net. Four high speed video cameras (300 Hz) were set up on the court to measure ball speed and racket head trajectory. Returned ball speed of the drop volley was significantly lower than that of the standard volley (p &lt; 0.05). The racket head moved less forward than in the standard volley, supporting the first hypothesis. Muscle activity of the drop volley, just before and after ball impact for both the forehand and backhand, was lower than that of the standard volley. However, the activity was in the form of a gradual increase as impact time approached, rather than a sudden deactivation (relaxation), which did not support the second hypothesis. For the drop volley, lower muscle activity in the forearm enabled a softer grip and thus allowed a “flip” movement of the racket to diminish the speed of the returned ball."
https://openalex.org/W3199828463,"Myotonic Dystrophy Type 1 (DM1) is the most common form of adult muscular dystrophy (~1:8000). In DM1, expansion of CTG trinucleotide repeats in the 3' untranslated region of the dystrophia myotonica protein kinase (DMPK) gene results in DMPK mRNA hairpin structures which aggregate as insoluble ribonuclear foci and sequester several RNA-binding proteins. The resulting sequestration and misregulation of important splicing factors, such as muscleblind-like 1 (MBNL1), causes the aberrant expression of fetal transcripts for several genes that contribute to the disease phenotype. Previous work has shown that antisense oligonucleotide-mediated disaggregation of the intranuclear foci has the potential to reverse downstream anomalies. To explore whether the nuclear foci are, to some extent, controlled by cell signalling pathways, we have performed a screen using a small interfering RNA (siRNA) library targeting 518 protein kinases to look at kinomic modulation of foci integrity. RNA foci were visualized by in situ hybridization of a fluorescent-tagged (CAG)10 probe directed towards the expanded DMPK mRNA and the cross-sectional area and number of foci per nuclei were recorded. From our screen, we have identified PACT (protein kinase R (PKR) activator) as a novel modulator of foci integrity and have shown that PACT knockdown can both increase MBNL1 protein levels; however, these changes are not suffcient for significant correction of downstream spliceopathies."
https://openalex.org/W3200130244,"Fake news is a complex problem that leads to different approaches used to identify them. In our paper, we focus on identifying fake news using its content. The used dataset containing fake and real news was pre-processed using syntactic analysis. Dependency grammar methods were used for the sentences of the dataset and based on them the importance of each word within the sentence was determined. This information about the importance of words in sentences was utilized to create the input vectors for classifications. The paper aims to find out whether it is possible to use the dependency grammar to improve the classification of fake news. We compared these methods with the TfIdf method. The results show that it is possible to use the dependency grammar information with acceptable accuracy for the classification of fake news. An important finding is that the dependency grammar can improve existing techniques. We have improved the traditional TfIdf technique in our experiment."

Past research has shown that trypophobic stimuli trigger emotional and physiological reactions, but relatively little is known about the antecedents, prodromes, or simply covariates of trypophobia.The goals of this study were (a) to draw the contours of the nomological network of trypophobia by assessing the associations of symptoms of trypophobia with several constructs that were deemed relevant from past research on anxiety disorders and specific phobias, (b) to compare such associations with those found for symptoms of spider phobia and blood and injection phobia (alternative dependent variables), and (c) to investigate the main effect of gender on symptoms of trypophobia and replicate the association of gender with symptoms of spider phobia and blood and injection phobia (higher scores for women).Participants (N = 1,134, 53% men) in this cross-sectional study completed an online questionnaire assessing the constructs of interest.Most assessed constructs typically associated with anxiety disorders (neuroticism, conscientiousness, anxiety sensitivity, trait anxiety, disgust sensitivity, and disgust propensity) were also associated with trypophobia in the predicted direction. All of these constructs were also associated with spider phobia and blood and injection phobia. Behavioral inhibition was negatively associated with trypophobia and spider phobia-contrary to what was expected, but positively with blood and injection phobia. We found no gender difference in trypophobia, whereas women scored higher on spider phobia and blood and injection phobia.Although some differences were observed, the nomological network of trypophobia was largely similar to that of spider phobia and blood and injection phobia. Further studies are needed to clarify similarities and dissimilarities between trypophobia and specific phobia."
https://openalex.org/W3201256160,"16S rRNA gene sequencing of DNA extracted from clinically uninfected hip and knee implant samples has revealed polymicrobial populations. However, previous studies assessed 16S rRNA gene sequencing as a technique for the diagnosis of periprosthetic joint infections, leaving the microbiota of presumed aseptic hip and knee implants largely unstudied. These communities of microorganisms might play important roles in aspects of host health, such as aseptic loosening. Therefore, this study sought to characterize the bacterial composition of presumed aseptic joint implant microbiota using next generation 16S rRNA gene sequencing, and it evaluated this method for future investigations. 248 samples were collected from implants of 41 patients undergoing total hip or knee arthroplasty revision for presumed aseptic failure. DNA was extracted using two methodologies—one optimized for high throughput and the other for human samples—and amplicons of the V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene were sequenced. Sequencing data were analyzed and compared with ancillary specific PCR and microbiological culture. Computational tools (SourceTracker and decontam) were used to detect and compensate for environmental and processing contaminants. Microbial diversity of patient samples was higher than that of open-air controls and differentially abundant taxa were detected between these conditions, possibly reflecting a true microbiota that is present in clinically uninfected joint implants. However, positive control-associated artifacts and DNA extraction methodology significantly affected sequencing results. As well, sequencing failed to identify Cutibacterium acnes in most culture- and PCR-positive samples. These challenges limited characterization of bacteria in presumed aseptic implants, but genera were identified for further investigation. In all, we provide further support for the hypothesis that there is likely a microbiota present in clinically uninfected joint implants, and we show that methods other than 16S rRNA gene sequencing may be ideal for its characterization. This work has illuminated the importance of further study of microbiota of clinically uninfected joint implants with novel molecular and computational tools to further eliminate contaminants and artifacts that arise in low bacterial abundance samples."

We recorded the BIS, electromyograph (EMG) activity on a BIS monitor (EMG_BIS), PLE, and EMG activity on a PLE monitor (EMG_PLE) in 40 patients receiving general anesthesia. During the awake state, we analyzed the changes in parameters before and 2 min after the eyes were closed. During sedation, we compared the changes in the parameters before and at 4 min after injecting rocuronium (group R) or normal saline (group C) between the two groups. During anesthesia, we compared the changes in parameters before and at 4 min after injecting sugammadex (group B) or normal saline (group D) between the two groups. During the awake state, the BIS, EMG_BIS, and EMG_PLE, but not PLE, decreased significantly with closed eyes. An effect of EMG on the BIS was evident, but not on PLE. During sedation, the BIS decreased with the decrease in EMG_BIS regardless of NMB caused by rocuronium, but NMB decreased PLE, although the degree of the decrease in EMG_PLE after NMB was similar to that after placebo. To determine the effect of NMB on electroencephalograms (EEGs) in groups R and C, we plotted the power spectra before and at 4 min after injecting rocuronium or normal saline. Changes in slow and delta frequency bands were observed at 4 min after injecting rocuronium relative to before injecting rocuronium. There was no effect of EMG on either the BIS or PLE during anesthesia. In conclusion, the effect of electromyograph activity and/or neuromuscular blockade on BIS or PLE depends on the level of consciousness."

It would be valuable to translate these finding with measurements more practical for human tissues. Here we show that DepMap essential genes and other literature curated functional genes exhibit cell-specific preferential epigenetic conservation when DNA methylation measurements are compared between replicate cell lines and between intestinal crypts from the same individual. Culture experiments indicate that epigenetic drift accumulates through time with smaller differences in more functional genes. In NCI-60 cell lines, greater targeted gene conservation correlated with greater drug sensitivity. These studies indicate that two measurements separated in time allow normal or neoplastic cells to signal through conservation which human genes are more essential to their survival in vitro or in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W3200089403,"There are two different concepts of corporate reputation grounded in individual and collective perceptions, respectively. The aim of this study was to identify how these two ways of conceiving of corporate reputation affect investors’ decisions about whether or not to buy stock in a given company. As this problem tackles individual decision-making processes, we designed and applied an incentivised economic experiment based on vignette studies and focused on individual decisions of single investors. Subjects took part in an online game that imitates stock exchange conditions and that concerns corporate reputation and investing. We found that the individual propensity to invest is not directly based on an investor’s perception (rooted in historical share price and other objective metrics) of a firm’s reputation but rather on an investor’s subjective recognition of collective corporate reputation in the market. This suggests a need to rethink the popular measures of corporate reputation in the context of studies of stock market investor decisions."

https://openalex.org/W3197894855,"Reactive oxygen species are key factors that strongly affect the cellular redox state and regulate various physiological and cellular phenomena. To monitor changes in the redox state, we previously developed fluorescent redox sensors named Re-Q, the emissions of which are quenched under reduced conditions. However, such fluorescent probes are unsuitable for use in the cells of photosynthetic organisms because they require photoexcitation that may change intracellular conditions and induce autofluorescence, primarily in chlorophylls. In addition, the presence of various chromophore pigments may interfere with fluorescence-based measurements because of their strong absorbance. To overcome these problems, we adopted the bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET) mechanism for the sensor and developed two BRET-based redox sensors by fusing cyan fluorescent protein-based or yellow fluorescent protein-based Re-Q with the luminescent protein Nluc. We named the resulting redox-sensitive BRET-based indicator probes ""ROBINc"" and ""ROBINy."" ROBINc is pH insensitive, which is especially vital for observation in photosynthetic organisms. By using these sensors, we successfully observed dynamic redox changes caused by an anticancer agent in HeLa cells and light/dark-dependent redox changes in the cells of photosynthetic cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803. Since the newly developed sensors do not require excitation light, they should be especially useful for visualizing intracellular phenomena caused by redox changes in cells containing colored pigments."

However, changes in plasma XOR (pXOR) activity after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) for stable coronary artery disease (CAD) remains unknown. Methods Herein, we compared the change in the pXOR activity in patients undergoing PCI with that in patients undergoing coronary angiography (CAG) and further evaluated the relation between changes in pXOR activity and in-hospital and long-term outcomes of patients undergoing PCI. The pXOR activity of 80 consecutive patients who underwent PCI and 25 patients who underwent CAG during the hospitalization was analyzed daily. The percentage changes from baseline regulated time interval was evaluated. Results We found that although pXOR activity decreased after PCI, and remained low until discharge, no significant changes were observed in patients undergoing CAG. Furthermore, among the patients undergoing PCI, those who experienced in-hospital adverse events, had a higher percentage of pXOR reduction 3 days after PCI. There was no association between these changes and long-term events. Conclusions A significant change in pXOR activity was observed in patients undergoing PCI than in patients undergoing CAG, and there seems to be a correlation between the in-hospital outcomes and the percentage reduction from baseline in pXOR activity."

Methods A total of 210 knees underwent MOWHTO for medial compartmental osteoarthritis (OA) were enrolled in this study. Mean follow-up period was 42.7 months. We assessed BTU for the medial compartment of the knee before MOWHTO and at the time of plate removal. Radiologic parameters included Kellgren-Lawrence (K-L) grade and Hip-Knee-Ankle angle (HKAA). Clinical evaluation included American Knee Society (AKS) score and cartilage status was graded at the time of MOWHTO and second-look arthroscopy according to the International Cartilage Repair Society (ICRS) grading system and articular cartilage regeneration stage. Statistical analysis performed to assess the relationships among postoperative BTU of the medial compartment, radiologic parameters, arthroscopic changes and clinical outcomes. Results BTU of medial femoral condyle and tibial plateau were significantly decreased at 2 years after MOWHTO (p&lt;0.001). AKS scores and arthroscopic cartilage status were also significantly improved following MOWHTO. BMI and postoperative HKAA showed significant correlations with postoperative changes of BTU in uni- and multi-variable analysis. Meanwhile, postoperative changes of BTU did not show significant correlation with clinical outcomes or cartilage regeneration following MOWHTO. Conclusion Lower BMI and postoperative valgus alignment were significant predictor for postoperative BTU decrease of the medial compartment following MOWHTO. However, postoperative changes of BTU did not reflect cartilage regeneration or clinical outcomes until the midterm follow-up."

This technology can be used as a backup memory for an external dram c ache memory without needing to modify the software. However, the higher read and write latencies of non-volatile memory may exacerbate the memory wall problem. In this work we present a novel off-chip prefetch technique based on a Hidden Markov Model that specifically deals with the latency problem caused by complexity of off-chip memory access patterns. Firstly, we present a thorough analysis of off-chip memory access patterns to identify its complexity in multicore processors. Based on this study, we propose a prefetching module located in the llc which uses two small tables, and where the computational complexity of which is linear with the number of computing threads. Our Markov-based technique is able to keep track and make clustering of several simultaneous groups of memory accesses coming from multiple simultaneous threads in a multicore processor. It can quickly identify complex address groups and trigger prefetch with very high accuracy. Our simulations show an improvement of up to 76% in the hit ratio of an off-chip dram c ache for multicore architecture over the conventional prefetch technique ( g/dc ). Also, the overhead of prefetch requests (failed prefetches) is reduced by 48% in single core simulations and by 83% in multicore simulations."
https://openalex.org/W3200436790,"When grasping an object, the opening between the fingertips (grip aperture) scales with the size of the object. If an object changes in size, the grip aperture has to be corrected. In this study, it was investigated whether such corrections would influence the perceived size of objects. The grasping plan was manipulated with a preview of the object, after which participants initiated their reaching movement without vision. In a minority of the grasps, the object changed in size after the preview and participants had to adjust their grasping movement. Visual feedback was manipulated in two experiments. In experiment 1, vision was restored during reach and both visual and haptic information was available to correct the grasp and lift the object. In experiment 2, no visual information was provided during the movement and grasps could only be corrected using haptic information. Participants made reach-to-grasp movements towards two objects and compared these in size. Results showed that participants adjusted their grasp to a change in object size from preview to grasped object in both experiments. However, a change in object size did not bias the perception of object size or alter discrimination performance. In experiment 2, a small perceptual bias was found when objects changed from large to small. However, this bias was much smaller than the difference that could be discriminated and could not be considered meaningful. Therefore, it can be concluded that the planning and execution of reach-to-grasp movements do not reliably affect the perception of object size."
