https://openalex.org/W2607067924,"Adult tissue stem cells (SCs) reside in niches, which, through intercellular contacts and signaling, influence SC behavior. Once activated, SCs typically give rise to short-lived transit-amplifying cells (TACs), which then progress to differentiate into their lineages. Here, using single-cell RNA-seq, we unearth unexpected heterogeneity among SCs and TACs of hair follicles. We trace the roots of this heterogeneity to micro-niches along epithelial-mesenchymal interfaces, where progenitors display molecular signatures reflective of spatially distinct local signals and intercellular interactions. Using lineage tracing, temporal single-cell analyses, and chromatin landscaping, we show that SC plasticity becomes restricted in a sequentially and spatially choreographed program, culminating in seven spatially arranged unilineage progenitors within TACs of mature follicles. By compartmentalizing SCs into micro-niches, tissues gain precise control over morphogenesis and regeneration: some progenitors specify lineages immediately, whereas others retain potency, preserving self-renewing features established early while progressively restricting lineages as they experience dynamic changes in microenvironment."
https://openalex.org/W2605887061,"Optical motion capturing systems are expensive and require substantial dedicated space to be set up. On the other hand, they provide unsurpassed accuracy and reliability. In many situations however flexibility is required and the motion capturing system can only temporarily be placed. The Microsoft Kinect v2 sensor is comparatively cheap and with respect to gait analysis promising results have been published. We here present a motion capturing system that is easy to set up, flexible with respect to the sensor locations and delivers high accuracy in gait parameters comparable to a gold standard motion capturing system (VICON). Further, we demonstrate that sensor setups which track the person only from one-side are less accurate and should be replaced by two-sided setups. With respect to commonly analyzed gait parameters, especially step width, our system shows higher agreement with the VICON system than previous reports."
https://openalex.org/W2606946599,"Muscle regeneration is a dynamic process during which cell state and identity change over time. A major roadblock has been a lack of tools to resolve a myogenic progression in vivo. Here we capitalize on a transformative technology, single-cell mass cytometry (CyTOF), to identify in vivo skeletal muscle stem cell and previously unrecognized progenitor populations that precede differentiation. We discovered two cell surface markers, CD9 and CD104, whose combined expression enabled in vivo identification and prospective isolation of stem and progenitor cells. Data analysis using the X-shift algorithm paired with single-cell force-directed layout visualization defined a molecular signature of the activated stem cell state (CD44+/CD98+/MyoD+) and delineated a myogenic trajectory during recovery from acute muscle injury. Our studies uncover the dynamics of skeletal muscle regeneration in vivo and pave the way for the elucidation of the regulatory networks that underlie cell-state transitions in muscle diseases and ageing."
https://openalex.org/W2607342107,"The E3 ubiquitin ligase adaptor speckle-type POZ protein (SPOP) is frequently dysregulated in prostate adenocarcinoma (PC), via either somatic mutations or mRNA downregulation, suggesting an important tumour suppressor function. To examine its physiologic role in the prostate epithelium in vivo, we generated mice with prostate-specific biallelic ablation of Spop. These mice exhibited increased prostate mass, prostate epithelial cell proliferation, and expression of c-MYC protein compared to littermate controls, and eventually developed prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN). We found that SPOPWT can physically interact with c-MYC protein and, upon exogenous expression in vitro, can promote c-MYC ubiquitination and degradation. This effect was attenuated in PC cells by introducing PC-associated SPOP mutants or upon knockdown of SPOP via short-hairpin-RNA, suggesting that SPOP inactivation directly increases c-MYC protein levels. Gene Set Enrichment Analysis revealed enrichment of Myc-induced genes in transcriptomic signatures associated with SPOPMT. Likewise, we observed strong inverse correlation between c-MYC activity and SPOP mRNA levels in two independent PC patient cohorts. The core SPOPMT;MYCHigh transcriptomic response, defined by the overlap between the SPOPMT and c-MYC transcriptomic programmes, was also associated with inferior clinical outcome in human PCs. Finally, the organoid-forming capacity of Spop-null murine prostate cells was more sensitive to c-MYC inhibition than that of Spop-WT cells, suggesting that c-MYC upregulation functionally contributes to the proliferative phenotype of Spop knock-out prostates. Taken together, our data highlight SPOP as an important regulator of luminal epithelial cell proliferation and c-MYC expression in prostate physiology, identify c-MYC as a novel bona fide SPOP substrate, and help explain the frequent inactivation of SPOP in human PC. We propose SPOPMT-induced stabilization of c-MYC protein as a novel mechanism that can increase total c-MYC levels in PC cells, in addition to amplification of c-MYC locus."
https://openalex.org/W2605773539,"The current literature reveals that the intrathalline coexistence of multiple microalgal taxa in lichens is more common than previously thought, and additional complexity is supported by the coexistence of bacteria and basidiomycete yeasts in lichen thalli. This replaces the old paradigm that lichen symbiosis occurs between a fungus and a single photobiont. The lichen Ramalina farinacea has proven to be a suitable model to study the multiplicity of microalgae in lichen thalli due to the constant coexistence of Trebouxia sp. TR9 and T. jamesii in long-distance populations. To date, studies involving phycobiont diversity within entire thalli are based on Sanger sequencing, but this method seems to underestimate the diversity. Here, we aim to analyze both the microalgal diversity and its community structure in a single thallus of the lichen R. farinacea by applying a 454 pyrosequencing approach coupled with a careful ad hoc-performed protocol for lichen sample processing prior to DNA extraction. To ascertain the reliability of the pyrosequencing results and the applied bioinformatics pipeline results, the thalli were divided into three sections (apical, middle and basal zones), and a mock community sample was used. The developed methodology allowed 40448 filtered algal reads to be obtained from a single lichen thallus, which encompassed 31 OTUs representative of different microalgae genera. In addition to corroborating the coexistence of the two Trebouxia sp. TR9 and T. jamesii taxa in the same thallus, this study showed a much higher microalgal diversity associated with the lichen. Along the thallus ramifications, we also detected variations in phycobiont distribution that might correlate with different microenvironmental conditions. These results highlight R. farinacea as a suitable material for studying microalgal diversity and further strengthen the concept of lichens as multispecies microecosystems. Future analyses will be relevant to ecophysiological and evolutionary studies to understand the roles of the multiple photobionts in lichen symbioses."
https://openalex.org/W2607389896,"High CD44 expression is associated with enhanced malignant potential in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC), among the deadliest of all human carcinomas. Although alterations in autophagy and CD44 expression are associated with poor patient outcomes in various cancer types, the relationship between autophagy and cells with high CD44 expression remains incompletely understood. In transformed oesophageal keratinocytes, CD44Low-CD24High (CD44L) cells give rise to CD44High-CD24-/Low (CD44H) cells via epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in response to transforming growth factor (TGF)-β. We couple patient samples and xenotransplantation studies with this tractable in vitro system of CD44L to CD44H cell conversion to investigate the functional role of autophagy in generation of cells with high CD44 expression. We report that high expression of the autophagy marker cleaved LC3 expression correlates with poor clinical outcome in ESCC. In ESCC xenograft tumours, pharmacological autophagy inhibition with chloroquine derivatives depletes cells with high CD44 expression while promoting oxidative stress. Autophagic flux impairment during EMT-mediated CD44L to CD44H cell conversion in vitro induces mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress and cell death. During CD44H cell generation, transformed keratinocytes display evidence of mitophagy, including mitochondrial fragmentation, decreased mitochondrial content and mitochondrial translocation of Parkin, essential in mitophagy. RNA interference-mediated Parkin depletion attenuates CD44H cell generation. These data suggest that autophagy facilitates EMT-mediated CD44H generation via modulation of redox homeostasis and Parkin-dependent mitochondrial clearance. This is the first report to implicate mitophagy in regulation of tumour cells with high CD44 expression, representing a potential novel therapeutic avenue in cancers where EMT and CD44H cells have been implicated, including ESCC."
https://openalex.org/W2606656203,"The role of maternal colostrum to infant development has been extensively studied and presented. Among the main factors which contribute to breast milk composition are maternal diet, age and body mass index, parity, duration of pregnancy and stage of lactation. This study aims to investigate the potential impact of several factors including demographic (i.e. maternal age and nationality) on the colostrum fatty acid profile. Colostrum was collected the third day postpartum in a Greek maternity hospital. Certain lipid quality indices and fatty acid ratios were estimated and results were statistically processed. The main identified fatty acids were palmitic (C16:0), oleic (C18:1ω-9), and linoleic (C18:2ω-6) acids. Among fatty acids, saturated fatty acids predominated (47.61%), followed by monounsaturated fatty acids (39.26%), while polyunsaturated fatty acids had the lowest proportion (13.13%). Values of lipid quality indices were within the reported in the literature ranges. Maternal body mass index, nationality, age, mode of delivery, gender and fetal weight percentile were studied in respect to their potential influence on the fatty acid profile of colostrum fat. Results suggest that colostrum fatty acid profile was mainly dependent on maternal nationality and age rather than mode of delivery and maternal BMI. Regarding the effect of maternal nationality, significant differences were found for saturated and monounsaturated fatty acids. Of the most interesting findings is that colostrum fat from older (≥35 years) mothers had less saturated fat and more appropriate LQIs values. Finally, a reversed correlation was observed between the customized centile of the infants and the colostrum fat content."
https://openalex.org/W2607494825,"Objectives This study examined gastroenterologists’ motivation for prescribing biosimilars, assessed their treatment preferences in relation to prescribing behaviour, and explored patient attitudes to biosimilars. Methods Data were taken from the Adelphi Real World Biosimilars Programme, a real-world, cross-sectional study undertaken in 2015–2016 with German gastroenterologists and patients with ulcerative colitis or Crohn’s disease. Gastroenterologists provided data on their prescribing behaviour and attitudes towards biosimilars, and invited the next eight eligible consecutive consulting patients to complete a detailed questionnaire. For analysis, gastroenterologists were split into ‘Investigative’, ‘Conservative’, and ‘Other’ groups. Results Overall, 25 gastroenterologists and 136 patients participated. Biosimilars accounted for <15% of all biologic therapies and >80% of gastroenterologists would prescribe a bio-originator rather than biosimilar as 1st line therapy if unrestricted. Patients showed some reluctance to accept biosimilars, although of those receiving biosimilars, 79% were satisfied with the current treatment of their condition, and 69% were satisfied with the control of symptoms. Although at least 35% of patients in each analysis group reported no concerns when starting treatment with a bio-originator or biosimilar, 41% of previously biologic-naïve patients prescribed a biosimilar indicated potential side effects and potential long-term problems, and 24% not knowing enough about the drug, as concerns. Conclusion Results demonstrate that there is reluctance from patients to accept biosimilars and the need to further educate patients who are unsure to allow them to be involved in decision making, highlighting the importance of patient and physician communication. There remains a need for further research into non-clinical switching and the long term impact of prescribing biosimilars."
https://openalex.org/W2607167416,"Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. There is evidence to support a connection between COPD and diabetes mellitus (DM), another common medical disorder. However, additional research is required to improve our knowledge of these relationships and their possible implications. In this study, we investigated the impact of DM on patient outcomes through the clinical course of COPD.We conducted a cohort study in patients from the Taiwan Longitudinal Health Insurance Database between 2000 and 2013. Patients with COPD were identified and assessed for pre-existing and incident DM. A Cox proportional hazards model was built to identify factors associated with incident DM and to explore the prognostic effects of DM on COPD patients. A propensity score method was used to match COPD patients with incident DM to controls without incident DM.Pre-existing DM was present in 332 (16%) of 2015 COPD patients who had a significantly higher hazard ratio (HR) [1.244, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.010-1.532] for mortality than that of the COPD patients without pre-existing DM. During the 10-year follow-up period, 304 (19%) of 1568 COPD patients developed incident DM; comorbid hypertension (HR, 1.810; 95% CI, 1.363-2.403), cerebrovascular disease (HR, 1.517; 95% CI, 1.146-2.008) and coronary artery disease (HR, 1.408; 95% CI 1.089-1.820) were significant factors associated with incident DM. Survival was worse for the COPD patients with incident DM than for the matched controls without incident DM (Log-rank, p = 0.027).DM, either pre-existing or incident, was associated with worse outcomes in COPD patients. Targeted surveillance and management of DM may be important in clinical care of the COPD population."
https://openalex.org/W2605530173,"The barrier function of the small intestinal mucosa prevents the introduction of undesired pathogens into the body. Breakdown of this barrier function increases intestinal permeability. This has been proposed to induce not only gastrointestinal diseases, including inflammatory bowel disease and irritable bowel syndrome, but also various other diseases, including allergies, diabetes mellitus, liver diseases, and collagen diseases, which are associated with this so called ""leaky gut syndrome."" As such, a method to prevent leaky gut syndrome would have substantial clinical value. However, no drugs have been demonstrated to improve disturbed intestinal permeability in humans to date. Therefore, we investigated whether a drug used to treat chronic constipation, lubiprostone, was effective for this purpose.Healthy male volunteers were treated with lubiprostone (24 μg/day) for 28 days. Intestinal permeability was evaluated by measuring the lactulose-mannitol ratio (LMR) after administration of diclofenac and compared with an untreated group. The examination was conducted three times in total, i.e., at baseline before diclofenac administration and after 14 and 28 days of lubiprostone treatment. Blood endotoxin activity was also evaluated at the same time points.The final analysis was conducted on 28 subjects (14 in the lubiprostone group and 14 in the untreated group). The LMR after 28 days of treatment was significantly lower in the lubiprostone group than that in the untreated group (0.017 vs. 0.028, respectively; 95% confidence interval, -0.022--0.0001; p = 0.049). Blood endotoxin activity exhibited almost no change over time in the lubiprostone and untreated groups and displayed no significant differences at any time point of examination.This study is the first to report an improvement in leaky gut using an available drug in humans. The result suggests that lubiprostone may prevent and ameliorate ""leaky gut syndrome"". However, a pivotal trial is needed to confirm our finding."
https://openalex.org/W2606545932,"Molecular profiling of glioblastomas has revealed the presence of key signaling hubs that contribute to tumor progression and acquisition of resistance. One of these main signaling mechanisms is the nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) pathway, which integrates multiple extracellular signals into transcriptional programs for tumor growth, invasion and maintenance of the tumor-initiating population. We show here that an extracellular protein released by glioblastoma cells, fibulin-3, drives oncogenic NF-κB in the tumor and increases NF-κB activation in peritumoral astrocytes. Fibulin-3 expression correlates with a NF-κB-regulated 'invasive signature' linked to poorer survival, being a possible tissue marker for regions of active tumor progression. Accordingly, fibulin-3 promotes glioblastoma invasion in a manner that requires NF-κB activation both in the tumor cells and their microenvironment. Mechanistically, we found that fibulin-3 activates the metalloprotease ADAM17 by competing with its endogenous inhibitor, TIMP3. This results in sustained release of soluble tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα) by ADAM17, which in turn activates TNF receptors and canonical NF-κB signaling. Taken together, our results underscore fibulin-3 as a novel extracellular signal with strong activating effect on NF-κB in malignant gliomas. Because fibulin-3 is produced de novo in these tumors and is absent from the normal brain, we propose that targeting the fibulin-3/NF-κB axis may provide a novel avenue to disrupt oncogenic NF-κB signaling in combination therapies for malignant brain tumors."
https://openalex.org/W2607106572,"Insects protect themselves from microbial infections through innate immune responses, including pathogen recognition, phagocytosis, the activation of proteolytic cascades, and the synthesis of antimicrobial peptides. Termites, eusocial insects inhabiting microbe-rich wood, live in closely-related family groups that are susceptible to shared pathogen infections. To resist pathogenic infection, termite families have evolved diverse immune adaptations at both individual and societal levels, and a strategy of trade-offs between reproduction and immunity has been suggested. Although termite immune-inducible genes have been identified, few studies have investigated the differential expression of these genes between reproductive and neuter castes, and between sexes in each caste. In this study, we compared the expression levels of immune-related genes among castes, sexes, and ages in a Japanese subterranean termite, Reticulitermes speratus. Using RNA-seq, we found 197 immune-related genes, including 40 pattern recognition proteins, 97 signalling proteins, 60 effectors. Among these genes, 174 showed differential expression among castes. Comparing expression levels between males and females in each caste, we found sexually dimorphic expression of immune-related genes not only in reproductive castes, but also in neuter castes. Moreover, we identified age-related differential expression of 162 genes in male and/or female reproductives. In addition, although R. speratus is known to use the antibacterial peptide C-type lysozyme as an egg recognition pheromone, we determined that R. speratus has not only C-type, but also P-type and I-type lysozymes, as well as other termite species. Our transcriptomic analyses revealed immune response plasticity among all castes, and sex-biased expression of immune genes even in neuter castes, suggesting a sexual division of labor in the immune system of R. speratus. This study heightens the understanding of the evolution of antimicrobial strategies in eusocial insects, and of sexual roles in insect societies as a whole."

Defining the composition, dynamics, and ultimately, the structure of the Hrd1 complex is a crucial step in understanding the molecular basis of glycoprotein quality control but has been hampered by the lack of suitable techniques to interrogate this complex under native conditions. In this study we used genome editing to generate clonal HEK293 (Hrd1.KI) cells harboring a homozygous insertion of a small tandem affinity tag knocked into the endogenous Hrd1 locus. We found that steady-state levels of tagged Hrd1 in these cells are indistinguishable from those of Hrd1 in unmodified cells and that the tagged variant is functional in supporting the degradation of well characterized luminal and membrane substrates. Analysis of detergent-solubilized Hrd1.KI cells indicates that the composition and stoichiometry of Hrd1 complexes are strongly influenced by Hrd1 expression levels. Analysis of affinity-captured Hrd1 complexes from these cells by size-exclusion chromatography, immunodepletion, and absolute quantification mass spectrometry identified two major high-molecular-mass complexes with distinct sets of interacting proteins and variable stoichiometries, suggesting a hitherto unrecognized heterogeneity in the functional units of Hrd1-mediated protein degradation.

https://openalex.org/W2606465385,"Programmed cell death or apoptosis of infected host cells is an important defense mechanism in response to viral infections. This process is regulated by proapoptotic and prosurvival members of the B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2) protein family. To counter premature death of a virus-infected cell, poxviruses use a range of different molecular strategies including the mimicry of prosurvival Bcl-2 proteins. One such viral prosurvival protein is the fowlpox virus protein FPV039, which is a potent apoptosis inhibitor, but the precise molecular mechanism by which FPV039 inhibits apoptosis is unknown. To understand how fowlpox virus inhibits apoptosis, we examined FPV039 using isothermal titration calorimetry, small-angle X-ray scattering, and X-ray crystallography. Here, we report that the fowlpox virus prosurvival protein FPV039 promiscuously binds to cellular proapoptotic Bcl-2 and engages all major proapoptotic Bcl-2 proteins. Unlike other identified viral Bcl-2 proteins to date, FPV039 engaged with cellular proapoptotic Bcl-2 with affinities comparable with those of Bcl-2's endogenous cellular counterparts. Structural studies revealed that FPV039 adopts the conserved Bcl-2 fold observed in cellular prosurvival Bcl-2 proteins and closely mimics the structure of the prosurvival Bcl-2 family protein Mcl-1.

Proapoptotic Bcl-2 proteins are further subdivided into members that contain multiple BH domains including Bax and Bak and the BH3-only proteins, which only harbor a BH3 motif. Upon activation, proapoptotic Bak and Bax oligomerize to permeabilize the outer mitochondrial membrane (8Westphal D. Kluck R.M. Dewson G.

Sequencing of the fowlpox virus genome and subsequent analysis identified the virus open reading frame 39 (FPV039) (26Afonso C.L. Tulman E.R. Lu Z. Zsak L. Kutish G.F. Rock D.L. The genome of fowlpox virus.J.

Virol. 2007; 81: 11032-11045Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Subsequent studies revealed that FPV039 is a potent inhibitor of apoptosis and localizes to the mitochondrial membrane via a C-terminal transmembrane domain. Mechanistically, FPV039 suppresses apoptosis triggered by overexpression of proapoptotic proteins including Bak and Bax and all the BH3-only proteins and was shown to immunoprecipitate with the BH3-only proteins Bim and Bik as well as Bak and activated Bax (27Banadyga L. Gerig J. Stewart T. Barry M. Fowlpox virus encodes a Bcl-2 homologue that protects cells from apoptotic death through interaction with the proapoptotic protein Bak.J.

Virol. 2009; 83: 7085-7098Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). However, the precise molecular and structural basis of how FPV039 inhibits apoptosis remains to be determined. To address these questions, we investigated the binding of FPV039 to peptides encoding the BH3 domain from all proapoptotic Bcl-2 family members including Bak, Bax, and Bok and all the BH3-only proteins. We then determined crystal structures of FPV039 bound to two of the identified interactors, Bmf and Bik BH3. Our studies showed that FPV039 is a highly promiscuous prosurvival viral Bcl-2 (vBcl-2) protein that binds to all BH3-only proteins as well as Bax and Bak and provide a mechanistic platform to understand FPV039-mediated apoptosis inhibition. To understand how FPV039 interacts with proapoptotic members of the Bcl-2 family of proteins, truncated FPV039 comprising the first 143 residues was recombinantly expressed in Escherichia coli and purified using a two-step purification method using affinity chromatography followed by size-exclusion chromatography. FPV039 exhibited low solubility, necessitating sample buffer optimization to achieve concentrations of 30 μm in a final buffer comprising 20 mm trisodium citrate, pH 6.0, 200 mm sodium chloride. We then examined binding of FPV039 to peptides encompassing the BH3 domain of all proapoptotic Bcl-2 proteins using isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC). Unexpectedly, ITC revealed that FPV039 was able to bind to peptides of all BH3-only proteins as well as peptides from Bak and Bax but not Bok (Fig. 1). FPV039 engages several BH3-only proteins with high affinity including Bid (2 nm), Bim (15 nm), Hrk (24 nm), Bmf (16 nm), Puma (24 nm), Noxa (28 nm), and Bik (30 nm). In contrast, FPV039 only engaged Bad (653 nm) with moderate affinity. Furthermore, FPV039 bound Bak BH3 with 76 nm affinity and Bax BH3 with 76 nm affinity.

In the presence of BH3 domain peptides, FPV039 could be concentrated to higher concentration, allowing us to perform SAXS analysis of FPV039·Bak BH3 domain peptide complex at concentrations ranging from 0.31 to 7.35 mg/ml. The scattering curve profile is conserved throughout the concentration range tested, suggesting an absence of interparticle interference (Fig. 2). The scattering conforms to a straight line in the low q region on the Guinier plot (Fig. 2A), and the calculated radius of gyration does not vary significantly with the measured concentration range, suggesting an absence of significant concentration effects from the highest concentration (Fig. 2). The molecular mass calculated from I(0) on the absolute scattering scale across the concentration range was ∼20.0 kDa, corresponding to an oligomerization state of ∼1 for the FPV039·Bak BH3 domain complex (Fig. 2C).Table 1Small-angle X-ray scattering data collection and scattering-derived parametersFPV039·Bak BH3 domainData collection parameters InstrumentSAXS/WAXS beamline, Australian Synchrotron Beam geometry (μm)80 × 200 Wavelength (keV)12 q range (Å−1)0.011–0.619 Exposure time (s)1 (per frame; 17 frames) Concentration range (mg ml−1)0.31–7.35 Temperature (K)293.15Structural parametersaReported for 7.35 mg/ml.

Open table in a new tab To understand the structural basis of FPV039 interaction with the BH3 domain of proapoptotic Bcl-2 proteins, we determined the structures of FPV039 in complex with Bmf (Fig. 3A and Table 2) and Bik BH3 domains (Fig. 3B). Although FPV039 has limited sequence identity to Bcl-2 proteins, FPV039 adopts a Bcl-2 fold comprising eight α-helices and harboring the conserved BH3 domain-binding groove observed in all the other prosurvival Bcl-2 members that is used to bind both Bmf and Bik BH3 domains (Fig. 4, A and B). Interestingly, FPV039 features an extended loop between α5 and α6 that is only visible in the FPV039·Bik BH3 complex structure but not in the FPV039·Bmf BH3 complex structure, suggesting considerable flexibility in the loop. The closest structural homolog as identified by a Dali search is Mcl-1 (root mean square deviation of 0.92 Å over 107 Cα carbon atoms with 25% sequence identity), whereas BHRF1 is the closest vBcl-2 homolog (30Kvansakul M.

The ligand-binding groove of FPV039 is formed by α2–α5 with the α5 helix forming the floor of the groove. FPV039 bound to the BH3 domains of Bmf and Bik by utilizing the four conserved hydrophobic residues in the BH3 domain as well as a conserved ionic interaction between Asp-151 (for Bmf) and Asp-57 (for Bik) from the BH3 domain and Arg-85 from FPV039 (Figs. 4, C and D, and 5A). Inspection of the FPV039·Bmf BH3 complex interface (Fig. 4C) revealed that Bmf residues Ile-142, Leu-146, Ile-149, and Phe-153 protrude into four hydrophobic pockets on the FPV039-binding groove. Furthermore, four hydrogen bonds and a salt bridge are found at the interface with the salt bridge formed by Arg-85FPV039 and Asp-151Bmf, and the hydrogen bonds are formed by Tyr-141FPV039 and His-154Bmf, Asn-82FPV039 and Asp-151Bmf, Asp-79FPV039 and Gln-147Bmf, and Arg-65FPV039 and Thr-138Bmf. Similarly, the interface of FPV039 and the Bik BH3 domain (Fig. 4D) involves four hydrophobic residues of Bik (Phe-60, Ile-56, Leu-53, and Val-49), which protrude into four hydrophobic pockets on FPV039. Furthermore, the salt bridge observed in FPV039·Bmf is conserved and formed by Arg-85FPV039–Asp-57Bik in the FPV039·Bik BH3 domain complex. A total of five hydrogen bonds are formed between Bik BH3 domain and FPV039, two of which are also observed in FPV039·Bmf including Tyr-141FPV039–Asn-61Bik and Asn-82FPV039–Asp-57Bik. In contrast, three of the hydrogen bonds are unique to FPV039·Bik and not found in the Bmf complex, and these are formed by Ser-50FPV039–Tyr-64Bik, Lys-80FPV039–Asp-57Bik, and Gln-75FPV039–Gln-48Bik.

https://openalex.org/W2606390380,"In May 2011, a major incident involving phthalates-contaminated foodstuffs occurred in Taiwan. Di-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) was added to foodstuffs, mainly juice, jelly, tea, sports drink, and dietary supplements. Concerns arose that normal pubertal development, especially reproductive hormone regulation in children, could be disrupted by DEHP exposure.To investigate the association between phthalate exposure and reproductive hormone levels among children following potential exposure to phthalate-tainted foodstuffs.A total of 239 children aged <12 years old were recruited from 3 hospitals in north, central, and south Taiwan after the episode. Structured questionnaires were used to collect the frequency and quantity of exposures to 5 categories of phthalate-contaminated foodstuffs to assess phthalate exposure in children. Urine samples were collected for the measurement of phthalate metabolites. The estimated daily intake of DEHP exposure at the time of the contamination incident occurred was calculated using both questionnaire data and urinary DEHP metabolite concentrations. Multiple regression analyses were applied to assess associations between phthalate exposure and reproductive hormone levels in children.After excluding children with missing data regarding exposure levels and hormone concentrations and girls with menstruation, 222 children were included in the statistical analyses. After adjustment for age and birth weight, girls with above median levels of urinary mono-(2-ethyl-5-hydroxyhexyl) phthalate, mono-(2-ethyl-5-oxohexyl) phthalate, and sum of mono-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate concentrations had higher odds of above median follicle-stimulating hormone concentrations. Girls with above median estimated average daily DEHP exposures following the contamination episode also had higher odds of sex hormone-binding globulin above median levels.Phthalate exposure was associated with alterations of reproductive hormone levels in girls."
https://openalex.org/W2606026876,"Date palm (Phoenix dactyliferaL.) is the mainstay of oasis agriculture in the Saharan region. It is cultivated in a large part of the Mediterranean coastal area of the Sahara and in most isolated oases in the Algerian desert. We sampled 10 oases in Algeria to understand the structure of date palm diversity from the coastal area to a very isolated desert location. We used 18 microsatellite markers and a chloroplast minisatellite to characterize 414 individual palm trees corresponding to 114 named varieties. We found a significant negative inbreeding coefficient, suggesting active farmer selection for heterozygous individuals. Three distinct genetic clusters were identified, a ubiquitous set of varieties found across the different oases, and two clusters, one of which was specific to the northern area, and the other to the drier southern area of the Algerian Sahara. The ubiquitous cluster presented very striking chloroplast diversity, signing the frequency of haplotypes found in Saudi Arabia, the most eastern part of the date palm range. Exchanges of Middle Eastern and Algerian date palms are known to have occurred and could have led to the introduction of this particular chlorotype. However, Algerian nuclear diversity was not of eastern origin. Our study strongly suggests that the peculiar chloroplastic diversity of date palm is maintained by farmers and could originate from date palms introduced from the Middle East a long time ago, which since then, hasbeen strongly introgressed. This study illustrates the complex structure of date palm diversity in Algerian oases and the role of farmers in shaping such cryptic diversity."
https://openalex.org/W2606879338,"Ligand-dependent corepressor (LCoR) is a transcriptional repressor of ligand-activated estrogen receptors (ERs) and other transcription factors that acts both by recruiting histone deacetylases and C-terminal binding proteins. Here, we first studied LCOR gene expression in breast cancer cell lines and tissues. We detected two mRNAs variants, LCoR and LCoR2 (which encodes a truncated LCoR protein). Their expression was highly correlated and localized in discrete nuclear foci. LCoR and LCoR2 strongly repressed transcription, inhibited estrogen-induced target gene expression and decreased breast cancer cell proliferation. By mutagenesis analysis, we showed that the helix-turn-helix domain of LCoR is required for these effects. Using in vitro interaction, coimmunoprecipitation, proximity ligation assay and confocal microscopy experiments, we found that receptor-interacting protein of 140 kDa (RIP140) is a LCoR and LCoR2 partner and that this interaction requires the HTH domain of LCoR and RIP140 N- and C-terminal regions. By increasing or silencing LCoR and RIP140 expression in human breast cancer cells, we then showed that RIP140 is necessary for LCoR inhibition of gene expression and cell proliferation. Moreover, LCoR and RIP140 mRNA levels were strongly correlated in breast cancer cell lines and biopsies. In addition, RIP140 positively regulated LCoR expression in human breast cancer cells and in transgenic mouse models. Finally, their expression correlated with overall survival of patients with breast cancer. Taken together, our results provide new insights into the mechanism of action of LCoR and RIP140 and highlight their strong interplay for the control of gene expression and cell proliferation in breast cancer cells."
https://openalex.org/W2605944665,"Objective Characterization of Staphylococcus aureus clinical isolates derived from lower respiratory tract infections (LRTIs), and correlation between the functionality of the accessory gene regulator (Agr) and genotypic and phenotypic characteristics, clinical variables and clinical outcome. Methods S aureus isolates derived from LRTIs and control groups (nasal carriage and bacteraemia) were genotyped using StaphyType DNA microarray. Agr activity was evaluated using the CAMP synergistic haemolysis assay and the Vesicle Lysis Test (VLT). Discordant strains were analysed by quantitative reverse-transcriptase real-time PCR (qRT-PCR). Results Agr was functional in 79.7% and 84.5% of strains according to the CAMP and VLT assays respectively. Higher concordance with RNAIII expression measured by qRT-PCR was observed with the VLT assay (76.2%) compared with the CAMP assay (23.8%). No statistically significant differences were observed in Agr functionality between the study groups, nor the phenotypical/genotypical bacterial characteristics. No association between increased mortality/respiratory complications and Agr function was observed. Conclusions Agr activity was high (82.2%) in isolates from LRTIs suggesting the importance of this global regulator in lower respiratory tract colonisation and infection. However, equally high Agr activity was observed in isolates derived from nasal carriage and bacteraemia, contradictory to previous observations. Agr functionality measured by the VLT assay was superior to CAMP assay."
https://openalex.org/W2605426759,"Osteoarthritis (OA) is the most common degenerative joint disorder and genetic factors have been shown to have a significant role in its etiology. The first metatarsophalangeal joint (MTP I) is highly susceptible to development of OA due to repetitive mechanical stress during walking. We used whole exome sequencing to study genetic defect(s) predisposing to familial early-onset bilateral MTP I OA inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. A nonsynonymous single nucleotide variant rs41310883 (c.524C>T, p.Thr175Met) in TUFT1 gene was found to co-segregate perfectly with MTP I OA. The role of TUFT1 and the relevance of the identified variant in pathogenesis of MTP I OA were further assessed using functional in vitro analyses. The variant reduced TUFT1 mRNA and tuftelin protein expression in HEK293 cells. ATDC5 cells overexpressing wild type (wt) or mutant TUFT1 were cultured in calcifying conditions and chondrogenic differentiation was found to be inhibited in both cell populations, as indicated by decreased marker gene expression when compared with the empty vector control cells. Also, the formation of cartilage nodules was diminished in both TUFT1 overexpressing ATDC5 cell populations. At the end of the culturing period the calcium content of the extracellular matrix was significantly increased in cells overexpressing mutant TUFT1 compared to cells overexpressing wt TUFT1 and control cells, while the proteoglycan content was reduced. These data imply that overexpression of TUFT1 in ATDC5 inhibits chondrogenic differentiation, and the identified variant may contribute to the pathogenesis of OA by increasing calcification and reducing amount of proteoglycans in the articular cartilage extracellular matrix thus making cartilage susceptible for degeneration and osteophyte formation."
https://openalex.org/W2605598171,"Serofast, a persistent nontreponemal serological response observed in early syphilis patients after conventional treatment, remains a concern of clinicians and syphilis patients. No consensus has been established, however, that defines an effective treatment strategy and clarifies the pathogenesis. In this study, 517 patients with early syphilis were enrolled and treated. Twelve months after treatment, 79.3% (410/517) of patients achieved serological cure, 20.1% (104/517) were serofast, and 0.6% (3/517) were serological failures. Multivariate analysis demonstrated that older age (>40 years) and lower baseline RPR titer (≤ 1:8) were associated with serofast status. We also identified 21 T. pallidum molecular subtypes among early syphilis patients and detected a new subtype, 14i/a. We found that the proportion of 14i/a type in serofast patients was significantly higher than that in patients with serological cure, predicting an increasing risk of serofast status. Levels of chemerin were higher in the serum of serofast cases than serological cure cases, potentially indicating a novel cytokine marker for serofast in early syphilis patients after therapy. We hope that these results contribute to improve guidelines for the management of syphilis patients who experience serofast."
https://openalex.org/W2607255329,"We aimed to explore whether mortality data are consistent with the view that aging is accelerated for people with a history of incarceration compared to the general population, using data on mortality rates and life expectancy for persons in Ontario, Canada.We obtained data from the Ontario Ministry of Community Safety and Correctional Services on all adults admitted to provincial correctional facilities in Ontario in 2000, and linked these data with death records from provincial vital statistics between January 1, 2000 and December 31, 2012. We used life table methods to calculate mortality rates and life expectancies for this cohort by sex and 5-year age group. We similarly generated population comparison rates using publicly available data for the general population of Ontario in 2006 as the midpoint of the follow up period. We compared these mortality indices between the 2000 Ontario prison cohort and the general population by age group and sex.The difference in all-cause mortality rates between the 2000 Ontario prison cohort and the general population was greatest for younger adults, with the prison cohort experiencing rates of death that would be expected for persons at least 15 years older at ages 20 to 44 for men and ages 20 to 59 for women. Life expectancy in the 2000 Ontario prison cohort was most similar to life expectancy of persons five years older in the general population at age intervals 20 to 45 in men and 20 to 30 in women.For most of adulthood, life expectancy and mortality rates are worse for adults with a history of incarceration than for the general population in Ontario, Canada. However, the association between mortality and incarceration status is modified by age, with the greatest relative burden of mortality experienced by younger persons with a history of incarceration and modified by sex, with worse relative mortality in women. Future research should explore the association between incarceration status and markers of aging including mortality, morbidity and physical appearance."
https://openalex.org/W2605619245,"Ocean acidification may affect zooplankton directly by decreasing in pH, as well as indirectly via trophic pathways, where changes in carbon availability or pH effects on primary producers may cascade up the food web thereby altering ecosystem functioning and community composition. Here, we present results from a mesocosm experiment carried out during 113 days in the Gullmar Fjord, Skagerrak coast of Sweden, studying plankton responses to predicted end-of-century pCO2 levels. We did not observe any pCO2 effect on the diversity of the mesozooplankton community, but a positive pCO2 effect on the total mesozooplankton abundance. Furthermore, we observed species-specific sensitivities to pCO2 in the two major groups in this experiment, copepods and hydromedusae. Also stage-specific pCO2 sensitivities were detected in copepods, with copepodites being the most responsive stage. Focusing on the most abundant species, Pseudocalanus acuspes, we observed that copepodites were significantly more abundant in the high-pCO2 treatment during most of the experiment, probably fuelled by phytoplankton community responses to high-pCO2 conditions. Physiological and reproductive output was analysed on P. acuspes females through two additional laboratory experiments, showing no pCO2 effect on females' condition nor on egg hatching. Overall, our results suggest that the Gullmar Fjord mesozooplankton community structure is not expected to change much under realistic end-of-century OA scenarios as used here. However, the positive pCO2 effect detected on mesozooplankton abundance could potentially affect biomass transfer to higher trophic levels in the future."
https://openalex.org/W2606638126,"Overexpression of the transcriptional coregulators C-terminal binding proteins 1 and 2 (CtBP1 and 2) occurs in many human solid tumors and is associated with poor prognosis. CtBP modulates oncogenic gene expression programs and is an emerging drug target, but its oncogenic role is unclear. Consistent with this oncogenic potential, exogenous CtBP2 transformed primary mouse and human cells to anchorage independence similarly to mutant H-Ras. To investigate CtBP’s contribution to in vivo tumorigenesis, Apcmin/+ mice, which succumb to massive intestinal polyposis, were bred to Ctbp2+/− mice. CtBP interacts with adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) protein, and is stabilized in both APC-mutated human colon cancers and Apcmin/+ intestinal polyps. Ctbp2 heterozygosity increased the median survival of Apcmin/+ mice from 21 to 48 weeks, and reduced polyp formation by 90%, with Ctbp2+/− polyps exhibiting reduced levels of β-catenin and its oncogenic transcriptional target, cyclin D1. CtBP’s potential as a therapeutic target was studied by treating Apcmin/+ mice with the CtBP small-molecule inhibitors 4-methylthio-2-oxobutyric acid and 2-hydroxy-imino phenylpyruvic acid, both of which reduced polyposis by more than half compared with vehicle treatment. Phenocopying Ctbp2 deletion, both Ctbp inhibitors caused substantial decreases in the protein level of Ctbp2, as well its oncogenic partner β-catenin, and the effects of the inhibitors on CtBP and β-catenin levels could be modeled in an APC-mutated human colon cancer cell line. CtBP2 is thus a druggable transforming oncoprotein critical for the evolution of neoplasia driven by Apc mutation."

Thermobifida fusca is a moderately thermophilic bacterium and holds high biocatalytic potential as a source for several highly thermostable enzymes. We report here on the isolation and characterization of a thermostable F420: NADPH oxidoreductase (Tfu-FNO) from T. fusca, the first F420-dependent enzyme described from this bacterium. Tfu-FNO was heterologously expressed in Escherichia coli, yielding up to 200 mg of recombinant enzyme per liter of culture. We found that Tfu-FNO is highly thermostable, reaching its highest activity at 65 °C and that Tfu-FNO is likely to act in vivo as an F420 reductase at the expense of NADPH, similar to its counterpart in Streptomyces griseus. We obtained the crystal structure of FNO in complex with NADP+ at 1.8 Å resolution, providing the first bacterial FNO structure. The overall architecture and NADP+-binding site of Tfu-FNO were highly similar to those of the Archaeoglobus fulgidus FNO (Af-FNO).

https://openalex.org/W2607079119,"The neuraminidase inhibitors (NAIs) oseltamivir and zanamivir are commonly used for the treatment and control of influenza A and B virus infection. However, the emergence of new influenza virus strains with reduced susceptibility to NAIs may appear with the use of these antivirals or even naturally. We therefore screened the neuraminidase (NA) sequences of seasonal influenza virus A(H1N1), A(H1N1)pdm09, A(H3N2), and influenza B virus strains identified in Thailand for the presence of substitutions previously reported to reduce susceptibility to NAIs. We initially examined oseltamivir resistance (characterized by the H275Y mutation in the NA gene) in 485 A(H1N1)pdm09 strains circulating in Thailand and found that 0.82% (4/485) had this substitution. To further evaluate the evolution of the NA gene, we also randomly selected 98 A(H1N1)pdm09, 158 A(H3N2), and 69 influenza B virus strains for NA gene amplification and sequencing, which revealed various amino acid mutations in the active site of the NA protein previously shown to be associated with reduced susceptibility to NAIs. Phylogenetic analysis of the influenza virus strains from this study and elsewhere around the world, together with the estimations of nucleotide substitution rates and selection pressure, and the predictions of B-cell epitopes and N-linked glycosylation sites all provided evidence for the ongoing evolution of NA. The overall rates of NA evolution for influenza A viruses were higher than for influenza B virus at the nucleotide level, although influenza B virus possessed more genealogical diversity than that of influenza A viruses. The continual surveillance of the antigenic changes associated with the NA protein will not only contribute to the influenza virus database but may also provide a better understanding of selection pressure exerted by antiviral use."

In this population, host factors and parasite biomass associated with severe imported malaria are poorly known.From data collected by the Centre National de Référence du Paludisme, we identified epidemiological, demographic and biological features including parasite biomass and anti-plasmodial antibody levels (negative, positive and strongly positive serology) associated with different disease severity groups (very severe, moderately severe, and uncomplicated malaria) in 3 epidemiological groups (travelers/expatriates, first- and second-generation migrants).Age, ethnicity, absence of prior infection with P. falciparum, antibody levels, plasma PfHRP2 levels, total and circulating parasite biomass were related to severe malaria onset. Sequestered parasite biomass tended to be increased in very severe malaria, and was strongly correlated to the antibody level of the host.Prior exposure to P. falciparum is associated with high anti-plasmodial antibody levels which influence clinical presentation of imported malaria and its correlated circulating and sequestered parasite burden."

Ectopically expressed hTrx1 significantly increased RR activity, DNA synthesis, and cell proliferation and migration. Importantly, inhibition of both hTrx1 and RRM1 produced a synergistic anticancer effect in CRC cells and xenograft mice. Furthermore, hTrx1 rather than hGrx1 was the efficient reductase for RRM1 regeneration. We also observed a direct protein-protein interaction between RRM1 and hTrx1 in CRC cells. Interestingly, besides the known two conserved cysteines, a third cysteine (Cys779) in the RRM1 C terminus was essential for RRM1 regeneration and binding to hTrx1, whereas both Cys32 and Cys35 in hTrx1 played a counterpart role.

Class Ia RRs are found in all types of eukaryotes (including human, mouse, and yeast), several viruses, a few prokaryotes (including Escherichia coli), and some bacteriophages. In Class Ia RRs, the large subunit R1 (named as RRM1 in human RR) contains the substrate-binding site as well as binding sites for allosteric regulators that control overall activity and substrate specificity, respectively. Using E. coli Class Ia RR as a prototype model, it has been proposed that substrate turnover by R1 is initiated by a thiyl radical that is present on Cys439 in the substrate-binding site. Disulfide bridges that connect Cys225 and Cys462 at the active site and Cys754 and Cys759 at the C-terminal tail also participate in the catalytic cycle. The small subunit R2 of Class Ia RRs (named as RRM2 and RRM2B, two types of R2, in human RR) contains a diiron-tyrosyl radical cofactor essential for enzyme activity (1Kolberg M. Strand K.R. Graff P.

The expression and activity of RR are well regulated because of its unique function in DNA synthesis. The expression of RR subunit proteins is controlled by RNA transcription and protein degradation in response to cell cycle and DNA repair signals. At the same time, the enzymatic activity of RR is regulated by multiple factors that include allosteric regulation, post-translational modification, subcellular localization, and intracellular environment (6Aye Y.

Reduction of ribonucleotide in the RR catalysis involves the formation of a disulfide in the active site of R1 subunit. Structural studies with E. coli RR show that the active site cleft of the R1 subunit is not wide enough to permit the direct reduction by the external redoxin systems, so the reduction of active site disulfide (Cys225 and Cys462) is carried out by a pair of shuttle cysteine residues in the C-terminal mobile tail of R1 subunit (Cys754 and Cys759).

Although oxidative stress may disrupt biological functions, redox reactions in a cell are often tightly regulated and play essential physiological roles (26Trachootham D. Lu W.

The mechanism for the increase of hTrx1 in cancer cells remains unknown. There are a number of mechanisms by which hTrx1 might cause increased cell growth including an increased supply of reducing equivalents for DNA synthesis, activation of transcription factors that regulate cell growth, and an increase in the sensitivity of cells to other cytokines and growth factors (27Harris I.S.

Because of its role as a stimulator of cell growth and an inhibitor of apoptosis, hTrx1 has served as a target for the development of drugs to treat and potentially prevent cancer (24Arnér E.S. Holmgren A. The thioredoxin system in cancer.Semin. Cancer Biol. 2006; 16: 420-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar). In addition, human Grx1 (hGrx1) expression in the previous studies is decreased in dysplastic tissue and even more decreased in the tumors as compared with non-neoplastic tissue. The down-regulation of hGrx1 has previously been described in lung cancer tissue where an inverse correlation of hGrx1 expression and cell proliferation of the tumors was found (33Said K. Glaumann H. Björnstedt M. Bergquist A. The value of thioredoxin family proteins and proliferation markers in dysplastic and malignant gallbladders in patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis.Dig. Dis. Sci. 2012; 57: 1163-1170Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). However, how human redox system regulates RRM1 catalysis reduction remains unclear (22Holmgren A. Sengupta R. The use of thiols by ribonucleotide reductase.Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2010; 49: 1617-1628Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 23Sengupta R. Holmgren A. Thioredoxin and glutaredoxin-mediated redox regulation of ribonucleotide reductase.World J. Biol. Chem. 2014; 5: 68-74Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Based on all the available crystal structures of RRM1, the C-terminal regions are thermally labile and structurally undefined; therefore, the location of the C terminus in the tertiary structure of RRM1 is not well resolved. Which and how the human cellular redox proteins (e.g. hTrx1 or hGrx1) regulate human RR enzymatic activity are unclear. In addition, based on our knowledge, there is still no experimental demonstration of the genetic/physical interaction between hTrx1 and RRM1 as well as the potential molecular mechanisms involved. Although the general concepts of redox signaling have been established, the identity and function of many regulatory switches remain unclear, especially in the context of cancer (24Arnér E.S. Holmgren A. The thioredoxin system in cancer.Semin. Cancer Biol. 2006; 16: 420-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar, 27Harris I.S. Treloar A.E. Inoue S. Sasaki M. Gorrini C. Lee K.C.

Whether and how the human cellular redox proteins affect the malignant proliferation of tumor cells via regulating human RR enzymatic activity are still unclear. In the present study, we found that hTrx1 but not hGrx1 expression increased in parallel with RRM1 levels and malignant progression in the cancer tissues of CRC patients. Furthermore, hTrx1 significantly promoted RR activity, DNA synthesis, and cancer phenotypes in an RRM1-dependent way in cancer cells. Combined inhibition of hTrx1 and RRM1 produced a synergistic anticancer effect in cancer cell and xenograft mouse models. Subsequent biochemical evidence suggested that hTrx1 rather than hGrx1was responsible for RRM1 regeneration and RR activity. RRM1 directly bound to and was reduced by hTrx1 through the two known cysteines with a novel Cys779 residue in its C-terminal tail also required for RRM1 activity, whereas the Cys32 and Cys35 in hTrx1 played a catalytic role against RRM1. Overall, we, for the first time, have demonstrated the genetic and physical interaction of RRM1 and hTrx1 in the CRC context, providing a new potential target for drug discovery for CRC. Immunohistochemical analysis was performed on 228 cases of clinical specimens of CRC (Table 1). The results showed that the expressions of RRM1, hTrx1, and hTrxR1 were up-regulated in most of the CRC tissues over their paired normal tissues (>90% specimens), whereas the hGrx1 expression level was relatively low in both normal and cancer tissues (Fig. 1, A–C, and supplemental Fig. S1). The hTrx1 expression level paralleled that of either RRM1 or hTrxR1, whereas the hGrx1 expression did not (Fig. 1D). The expressions of RRM1 and hTrx1 were significantly increased in the cancer tissues and positively correlated with cancer invasion (T1–T3) and metastasis (M0-M1) (p < 0.01) (Fig. 1E and Table 1). Consistently, The Cancer Genome Atlas data analysis showed that the hTrx1 mRNA expression level positively correlated with the mRNA levels of RRM1 in 376 CRC cases (supplemental Fig. S2 and supplemental methods). Therefore, the results showed that the expression of hTrx1 but not hGrx1 was up-regulated in parallel with RRM1, and both were correlated with the pathological staging of CRC, suggesting a potential connection among hTrx1, RRM1, and CRC malignant progression.Table 1Correlation of the expression of RRM1 and hTrx1 with clinicopathological features in CRC Open table in a new tab Figure 1The expression of hTrx1 but not hGrx1 was up-regulated in parallel with RRM1 increasing malignant progression in colorectal cancer.

Ectopic expression of hTrx1 increased RR enzymatic activity and cell proliferation in cancer cells, whereas RRM1 knockdown with siRNA completely reversed the effect (Fig. 2, A and B, and supplemental Fig. S3). EdU incorporation assays showed that hTrx1 enhanced DNA synthesis that is dependent on RRM1 in cancer cells (Fig. 2C). Moreover, wound healing assays showed that hTrx1 increased the migration of the transfected cancer cells, whereas hTrx1 knockdown with siRNA showed the opposite effect (Fig. 2D). The results indicated that hTrx1 significantly increased RR activity and DNA synthesis in cancer cells, which might then enhance CRC malignancy. Gemcitabine is a nucleoside analog widely used in cancer chemotherapy. It is converted intracellularly to the active metabolites dFdCDP and dFdCTP. dFdCDP inhibits RRM1, thereby decreasing the deoxynucleotide pool available for DNA synthesis (7Jordheim L.P. Sève P.

PX-12 is an irreversible hTrx1 inhibitor with antitumor properties. PX-12 decreases the activity of hTrx1 by thioalkylating the critical cysteine residue (Cys73) or by increasing the dimerization of its oxidative form (34Powis G. Mustacich D. Coon A.

Cancer Res. 2007; 13: 2109-2114Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3A, gemcitabine and PX-12 showed different orders of potencies in selected cell lines. The IC50 values for gemcitabine were 25.0 ± 1.1 and 37.7 ± 1.3 nm for SW480 and SW620, respectively. The IC50 values for PX-12 were 11.9 ± 1.0 and 18.5 ± 1.1 μm for SW480 and SW620, respectively. Combined treatment with gemcitabine and PX-12 yielded a significantly greater growth inhibition than either agent used alone in both SW480 and SW620 cells (Fig. 3B). Quantitative analyses with the Chou-Talalay method (37Ashton J.C. Drug combination studies and their synergy quantification using the Chou-Talalay method.Cancer Res. 2015; 752400Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) indicated a synergistic antiproliferation effect (combination index (CI) <1) (Fig. 3C). Plate clone formation assays also demonstrated a significantly combined action of the two drugs against CRC cells (Fig. 3D). To further investigate the in vivo role, SW480 or SW620 cells were subcutaneously injected into nude mice to generate CRC xenografts followed by treatment with gemcitabine and/or PX-12. Although each group of mice showed similar body weights during the treatment (Fig. 3E), combined treatment with gemcitabine and PX-12 significantly reduced the volumes (Fig. 3, F and G) and weights (Fig. 3H) of the xenografts compared with the control and single-drug groups. No apparent histopathological changes were observed with H&E staining in liver tissue sections of the treated mice, suggesting the combined treatment did not cause liver damage in mice (Fig. 3I). These results indicated that combined use of hTrx1 and RRM1 inhibitors produced a synergistic anticancer effect in CRC cell lines and xenograft mice at the indicated dosages. In Class Ia RRs, Grx1 is the most efficient electron donor for the E. coli enzyme, whereas Trx1 and Grx1 show similar reduction efficiencies for the mouse enzyme (23Sengupta R. Holmgren A.

Sci. U.S.A. 1994; 91: 9813-9817Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Different reductant or redoxin systems were evaluated for their redox potentials for human RR activity (supplemental Table S1). As shown in Fig. 4A, the hTrx1/hTrxR1 system activated the RRM1 specific activity with much higher efficiency than the hGrx1 system and the generic reductant DTT. The specific activity of RRM1 was significantly up-regulated with the increase of hTrx1 concentration, which is not the case for the parallel hGrx1 group (Fig. 4, B and C). The apparent Km value for hTrx1 was about 1.45 μm, whereas Vmax was around 1.58 dCDP/s/RRM1 monomer. The results indicated that, in the external electron donors, hTrx1 is the most efficient reductase for human RR catalysis rather than hGrx1 and the small reductant DTT. There was no significant difference in RRM1 and hTrx1 protein levels among different CRC cell lines (supplemental Fig. S4). Immunofluorescence revealed co-localization of RRM1 and hTrx1 in SW480 cells (supplemental Fig. S5 and supplemental methods). SW480 cells were transfected with RRM1-FLAG expression plasmids. The cell lysates were analyzed by immunoprecipitation using anti-FLAG® M2 magnetic beads followed by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining. Protein band"
https://openalex.org/W2607261016,"The US FDA approval of broad-spectrum histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors has firmly laid the cancer community to explore HDAC inhibition as a therapeutic approach for cancer treatment. Hitting one HDAC member could yield clinical benefit but this required a complete understanding of the functions of the different HDAC members. Here we explored the consequences of specific HDAC5 inhibition in cancer cells. We demonstrated that HDAC5 inhibition induces an iron-dependent reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, ultimately leading to apoptotic cell death as well as mechanisms of mitochondria quality control (mitophagy and mitobiogenesis). Interestingly, adaptation of HDAC5-depleted cells to oxidative stress passes through reprogramming of metabolic pathways towards glucose and glutamine. Therefore, interference with both glucose and glutamine supply in HDAC5-inhibited cancer cells significantly increases apoptotic cell death and reduces tumour growth in vivo; providing insight into a valuable clinical strategy combining the selective inhibition of HDAC5 with various inhibitors of metabolism as a new therapy to kill cancer cells."

These diverse activities and 2AQ occurrence in vastly different phyla have raised much interest in the biosynthesis pathways leading to their production. Previous studies in plants have suggested that type III polyketide synthases (PKSs) might be involved in 2AQ biosynthesis, but this hypothesis is untested. To this end, we cloned two novel type III PKSs, alkyldiketide-CoA synthase (ADS) and alkylquinolone synthase (AQS), from the 2AQ-producing medicinal plant, Evodia rutaecarpa (Rutaceae). Functional analyses revealed that collaboration of ADS and AQS produces 2AQ via condensations of N-methylanthraniloyl-CoA, a fatty acyl-CoA, with malonyl-CoA. We show that ADS efficiently catalyzes the decarboxylative condensation of malonyl-CoA with a fatty acyl-CoA to produce an alkyldiketide-CoA, whereas AQS specifically catalyzes the decarboxylative condensation of an alkyldiketide acid with N-methylanthraniloyl-CoA to generate the 2AQ scaffold via C–C/C–N bond formations. Remarkably, the ADS and AQS crystal structures at 1.80 and 2.20 Å resolutions, respectively, indicated that the unique active-site architecture with Trp-332 and Cys-191 and the novel CoA-binding tunnel with Tyr-215 principally control the substrate and product specificities of ADS and AQS, respectively.

https://openalex.org/W2607007924,"Clinical trials have revealed that the potential anticancer agent, 2-methoxyestradiol (2ME2) has limitations due to its low bioavailability. Subsequently, 2ME2 derivatives including (8R,13S,14S,17S)-2-ethyl-13-methyl-7,8,9,11,12,13,14,15,16,17-decahydro-6H-cyclopenta[a]phenanthrane-3,17-diyl bis(sulphamate) (EMBS) have shown improved efficacies in inducing apoptosis. However, no conclusive data exist to explain the mode of action exerted by these drugs. This study investigated the mode of action used by EMBS as a representative of the sulphamoylated 2ME2 derivatives. Hydrogen peroxide and superoxide production was quantified using dichlorofluorescein diacetate and hydroethidine. Cell proliferation and mitochondrial metabolism were investigated using crystal violet and Alamar Blue. Apoptosis was assessed using Annexin V-FITC while mitochondrial integrity was assessed using Mitocapture. Autophagy was visualised using LC3B II antibodies. The effects of EMBS on H2A phosphorylation and nuclei were visualised using phospho H2A antibody and 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole, dihydrochloride. Data showed that EMBS exposure leads to increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) production which is correlated with loss of cell proliferation, mitochondrial membrane damage, decreased metabolic activity, G2/M arrest, endoreduplication, DNA double stranded breaks, micronuclei and apoptosis induction. Treatment of EMBS-exposed cells with the ROS scavenger, N-acetyl cysteine, abrogated ROS production, cell cycle arrest and apoptosis implying an essential role for ROS production in EMBS signaling. The inhibition of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) activity also inhibited EMBS-induced apoptosis suggesting that EMBS triggers apoptosis via the JNK pathway. Lastly, evaluation of LC3IIB protein levels indicated that autophagy is not activated in EMBS-exposed cells. Our data shows that EMBS targets a pathway that leads to increased ROS production as an early event that culminates in G2/M arrest and apoptosis by means of JNK-signaling in cancer cells. This study suggests a novel oxidative stress-dependent mode of action for sulphamoylated derivatives."
https://openalex.org/W2273740070,"Reducing child undernutrition is a key social policy objective of the Ethiopian government. Despite substantial reduction over the last decade and a half, child undernutrition is still high; with 48 percent of children either stunted, underweight or wasted, undernutrition remains an important child health challenge. The existing literature highlights that targeting of efforts to reduce undernutrition in Ethiopia is inefficient, in part due to lack of data and updated information. This paper remedies some of this shortfall by estimating levels of stunting and underweight in each woreda for 2014. The estimates are small area estimations based on the 2014 Demographic and Health Survey and the latest population census. It is shown that small area estimations are powerful predictors of undernutrition, even compared to household characteristics, such as wealth and education, and hence a valuable targeting metric. The results show large variations in share of children undernourished within each region, more than between regions. The results also show that the locations with larger challenges depend on the chosen undernutrition statistic, as the share, number and concentration of undernourished children point to vastly different locations. There is also limited correlation between share of children underweight and stunted across woredas, indicating that different locations face different challenges."

https://openalex.org/W2606339350,"Partamona seridoensis is an endemic stingless bee from the Caatinga, a Neotropical dry forest in northeastern Brazil. Like other stingless bees, this species plays an important ecological role as a pollinator. The aim of the present study was to investigate the genetic structure and evolutionary history of P. seridoensis across its current geographic range. Workers from 84 nests from 17 localities were analyzed for COI and Cytb genic regions. The population structure tests (Bayesian phylogenetic inference, AMOVA and haplotype network) consistently characterized two haplogroups (northwestern and eastern), with little gene flow between them, generating a high differentiation between them as well as among the populations within each haplogroup. The Mantel test revealed no isolation by distance. No evidence of a potential geographic barrier in the present that could explain the diversification between the P. seridoensis haplogroups was found. However, Pleistocene climatic changes may explain this differentiation, since the initial time for the P. seridoensis lineages diversification took place during the mid-Pleistocene, specifically the interglacial period, when the biota is presumed to have been more associated with dry conditions and had more restricted, fragmented geographical distribution. This event may have driven diversification by isolating the two haplogroups. Otherwise, the climatic changes in the late Pleistocene must not have drastically affected the population dynamics of P. seridoensis, since the Bayesian Skyline Plot did not reveal any substantial fluctuation in effective population size in either haplogroup. Considering its importance and the fact that it is an endemic bee from a very threatened Neotropical dry forest, the results herein could be useful to the development of conservation strategies for P. seridoensis."
https://openalex.org/W2606407606,"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is characterized by a high frequency of chronic cases owing to the impairment of innate and adaptive immune responses. The modulation of natural killer (NK) cell functions by HCV leads to an impaired innate immune response. However, the underling mechanisms and roles of HCV proteins in this immune evasion are controversial, especially in the early phase of HCV infection. To investigate the role of HCV nonstructural proteins especially NS3 in the impairment of NK functions, NK cells were isolated from the PBMCs by negative selection. To assess the direct cytotoxicity and IFN-γ production capability of NK cells, co-cultured with uninfected, HCV-infected, HCV-NS3 DNA-transfected Huh-7.5, or HCV-NS replicon cells. To determine the effect of an NS3 serine protease inhibitor, HCV-infected Huh-7.5 cells were treated with BILN-2061. Then, NK cells were harvested and further co-cultured with K-562 target cells. NK cell functions were analyzed by flow cytometry and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. When co-cultured with HCV-infected Huh-7.5 cells, the natural cytotoxicity and IFN-γ production capability of NK cells were significantly reduced. NK cell functions were inhibited to similar levels upon co-culture with HCV-NS replicon cells, NS3-transfected cells, and HCV-infected Huh-7.5 cells. These reductions were restored by BILN-2061-treatment. Furthermore, BILN-2061-treatment significantly increased degranulation against K-562 target cells and IFN-γ productivity in NK cells. Consistent with these findings, the expression levels of activating NK cell receptors, such as NKp46 and NKp30, were also increased. In HCV-infected cells, the serine protease NS3 may play a role in the abrogation of NK cell functions in the early phase of infection through downregulation of NKp46 and NKp30 receptors on NK cells. Together, these results suggest that NS3 represents a novel drug target for the treatment of HCV infections."
https://openalex.org/W2607444309,"Reducing perinatal morbidity and mortality is one of the major challenges in modern health care. Analysing the ST segment of the fetal electrocardiogram was thought to be the breakthrough in fetal monitoring during labour. However, its implementation in clinical practice yields many false alarms and ST monitoring is highly dependent on cardiotocogram assessment, limiting its value for the prediction of fetal distress during labour. This study aims to evaluate the relation between physiological variations in the orientation of the fetal electrical heart axis and the occurrence of ST events.A post-hoc analysis was performed following a multicentre randomised controlled trial, including 1097 patients from two participating centres. All women were monitored with ST analysis during labour. Cases of fetal metabolic acidosis, poor signal quality, missing blood gas analysis, and congenital heart disease were excluded. The orientation of the fetal electrical heart axis affects the height of the initial T/QRS baseline, and therefore the incidence of ST events. We grouped tracings with the same initial baseline T/QRS value. We depicted the number of ST events as a function of the initial baseline T/QRS value with a linear regression model.A significant increment of ST events was observed with increasing height of the initial T/QRS baseline, irrespective of the fetal condition; correlation coefficient 0.63, p<0.001. The most frequent T/QRS baseline is 0.12.The orientation of the fetal electrical heart axis and accordingly the height of the initial T/QRS baseline should be taken into account in fetal monitoring with ST analysis."

Several metabolic pathways are considered to contribute to the development of atherosclerosis, but comprehensive metabolic alterations to atherosclerotic arterial cells remain unknown. The present study investigated metabolic changes and their relationship to vascular histopathological changes in the atherosclerotic arteries of rabbits with alloxan-induced diabetes. Diabetic atherosclerosis was induced in rabbit ilio-femoral arteries by injecting alloxan (100 mg/kg), injuring the arteries using a balloon, and feeding with a 0.5% cholesterol diet. We histologically assessed the atherosclerotic lesion development, cellular content, pimonidazole positive-hypoxic area, the nuclear localization of hypoxia-inducible factor-1α, and apoptosis. We evaluated comprehensive arterial metabolism by performing metabolomic analyses using capillary electrophoresis-time of flight mass spectrometry. We evaluated glucose uptake and its relationship to vascular hypoxia using 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose and pimonidazole. Plaque burden, macrophage content, and hypoxic areas were more prevalent in arteries with diabetic, than non-diabetic atherosclerosis. Metabolomic analyses highlighted 12 metabolites that were significantly altered between diabetic and non-diabetic atherosclerosis. A half of them were associated with glycolysis metabolites, and their levels were decreased in diabetic atherosclerosis. The uptake of glucose evaluated as 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose in atherosclerotic lesions increased according to increased macrophage content or hypoxic areas in non-diabetic, but not diabetic rabbits. Despite profound hypoxic areas, the nuclear localization of hypoxia-inducible factor-1α decreased and the number of apoptotic cells increased in diabetic atherosclerotic lesions. Altered glycolysis metabolism and an impaired response to hypoxia in atherosclerotic lesions under conditions of insulin-dependent diabetes might be involved in the development of diabetic atherosclerosis."

Based on the previously proposed methods BayesCπ for single continuous trait and BayesTCπ for single threshold trait, we developed a novel method based on a linear-threshold model, i.e., LT-BayesCπ, for joint genomic prediction of a continuous trait and a threshold trait. Computing procedures of LT-BayesCπ using Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithm were derived. A simulation study was performed to investigate the advantages of LT-BayesCπ over BayesCπ and BayesTCπ with regard to the accuracy of genomic prediction on both traits. Factors affecting the performance of LT-BayesCπ were addressed. The results showed that, in all scenarios, the accuracy of genomic prediction obtained from LT-BayesCπ was significantly increased for the threshold trait compared to that from single trait prediction using BayesTCπ, while the accuracy for the continuous trait was comparable with that from single trait prediction using BayesCπ. The proposed LT-BayesCπ could be a method of choice for joint genomic prediction of one continuous and one threshold trait."
https://openalex.org/W2606247812,"There is little knowledge about how factors early in life affect the development of migraine and tension-type headache. We aimed to examine whether growth restriction in utero is associated with development of migraine and frequent tension-type headache in adults.The population-based Nord-Trøndelag Health Study (HUNT 3) contained a validated headache questionnaire, which differentiated between migraine and tension-type headache. These data were linked to information on weight and gestational age at birth from the Norwegian Medical Birth Registry. In total 4557 females and 2789 males, aged 19-41 years, were included in this registry-based study. Participants were categorized as appropriate for gestational age (AGA, 10th-90th percentile), small for gestational age (SGA, 3rd-10th percentile) or very small for gestational age (VSGA, < 3rd percentile). Logistic regression was used to calculate odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) for migraine and tension-type headache, with exposure being growth restriction at birth.The effect of growth restriction on migraine was modified by sex, with a significant association in males (p<0.001), but not in females (p = 0.20). In particular, males born VSGA were at increased risk of developing migraine (OR 2.73, 95% CI 1.63-4.58, p<0.001), with an intermediate risk among those born SGA (OR 1.50, 95% CI 0.96-2.35, p = 0.08) compared to those born AGA. There was no significant association between growth restriction and frequent TTH (p = 0.051).Growth restriction was associated with increased risk of migraine in adulthood among males, but not among females. This suggests that migraine might, in part, be influenced by early life events, and that males seem to be particularly vulnerable."
https://openalex.org/W2607198444,"Squamous cell carcinoma of the skin (SCC) represents one of the most common cancers in the general population and is associated with a substantial risk of metastasis. Previous work uncovered the functional role of CYFIP1 in epithelial tumors as an invasion inhibitor. It was down-regulated in some cancers and correlated with the metastatic properties of these malignant cells. We investigated its role and expression mechanisms in SCC. We analyzed the expression of CYFIP1 in patient derived SCC, primary keratinocytes and SCC cell lines, and correlated it to the differentiation and NOTCH1 levels. We analyzed the effects of Notch1 manipulation on CYFIP1 expression and confirmed the biding of Notch1 to the CYFIP1 promoter. CYFIP1 expression was down-regulated in SCC and correlated inversely with histological differentiation of tumors. As keratinocyte differentiation depends on Notch1 signaling, we investigated the influence of Notch1 on CYFIP1 expression. CYFIP1 mRNA was highly increased in human Notch1-overexpressing keratinocytes. Further manipulation of the Notch1 pathway in keratinocytes impacted CYFIP1 levels and chromatin immunoprecipitation assay confirmed the direct binding of Notch1 to the CYFIP1 promoter. CYFIP1 may be a link between loss of differentiation and invasive potential in malignant keratinocytes of cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma."
https://openalex.org/W2606740773,"The knowledge of spatial pattern and geographic beta-diversity is of great importance for biodiversity conservation and interpreting ecological information. Tropical forests, especially the Amazon Rainforest, are well known for their high species richness and low similarity in species composition between sites, both at local and regional scales. We aimed to determine the effect and relative importance of area, isolation and climate on species richness and turnover in orchid bee assemblages among plateaus in central Brazilian Amazonia. Variance partitioning techniques were applied to assess the relative effects of spatial and environmental variables on bee species richness, phylogeny and composition. We hypothesized that greater abundance and richness of orchid bees would be found on larger plateaus, with a set of core species occurring on all of them. We also hypothesized that smaller plateaus would possess lower phylogenetic diversity. We found 55 bee species distributed along the nine sampling sites (plateaus) with 17 of them being singletons. There was a significant decrease in species richness with decreasing size of plateaus, and a significant decrease in the similarity in species composition with greater distance and climatic variation among sampling sites. Phylogenetic diversity varied among the sampling sites but was directly related to species richness. Although not significantly related to plateau area, smaller or larger PDFaith were observed in the smallest and the largest plateaus, respectively."

https://openalex.org/W2606863126,"A frequently-studied phenomenon in cognitive-control research is conflict adaptation, or the finding that congruency effects are smaller after incongruent trials. Prominent cognitive control accounts suggest that this adaptation effect can be explained by transient conflict-induced modulations of selective attention, reducing congruency effects on the next trial. In the present study, we investigated these possible attentional modulations in four experiments using the Stroop and Flanker tasks, dissociating possible enhancements of task-relevant information from suppression of task-irrelevant information by varying when this information was presented. In two experiments, the irrelevant stimulus information was randomly presented shortly before, at the same time, or briefly after the presentation of the relevant dimension. In the other two, irrelevant information was always presented first, making this aspect fully predictable. Despite the central role that attentional adjustments play in theoretical accounts of conflict adaption, we only found evidence for such processes in one of the four experiments. Specifically, we found a modulation of the attention-related posterior N1 event-related potential component that was consistent with paying less attention to the irrelevant information after incongruent trials. This was accompanied by increased inter-trial mid-frontal theta power and a theta-power conflict adaptation effect. We interpret these results as evidence for an adaptive mechanism based on relative attentional inhibition. Importantly, this mechanism only clearly seems to be implemented in a very specific context of high temporal predictability, and only in the Flanker task."
https://openalex.org/W2607060211,"Background Tumour suppressor genes when mutated in the germline cause various cancers, but they can also be somatically mutated in sporadic tumours. We hypothesized that there may also be cancer-related germline variants in the genes commonly mutated in sporadic well-differentiated thyroid cancer (WDTC). Methods We performed a two-stage case-control association study with a total of 2214 cases and 2108 healthy controls from an Italian population. By genotyping 34 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), we covered a total of 59 missense SNPs and SNPs located in the 5' and 3' untranslated regions (UTRs) of 10 different genes. Results The Italian1 series showed a suggestive association for 8 SNPs, from which three were replicated in the Italian2 series. The meta-analysis revealed a study-wide significant association for rs459552 (OR: 0.84, 95%CI: 0.75–0.94) and rs1800900 (OR: 1.15, 95%CI: 1.05–1.27), located in the APC and GNAS genes, respectively. The APC rs459552 is a missense SNP, located in a conserved amino acid position, but without any functional consequences. The GNAS rs1800900 is located at a conserved 5'UTR and according to the experimental ENCODE data it may affect promoter and histone marks in different cell types. Conclusions The results of this study yield new insights on WDTC, showing that inherited variants in the APC and GNAS genes can play a role in the etiology of thyroid cancer. Further studies are necessary to better understand the role of the identified SNPs in the development of WDTC and to functionally validate our in silico predictions."
https://openalex.org/W2607229577,"Background Previous studies have found low use of anticoagulation prior to stroke, in people with atrial fibrillation (AF). This study examined data on patients with AF-related stroke from a population-based stroke register, and sought to examine changes in management of AF prior to stroke, and reasons for suboptimal treatment, in those who were known to be at a high risk of stroke. Methods The South London Stroke Register (SLSR) is an ongoing population-based register recording first-in-a-lifetime stroke. Trends in the prevalence of AF, and antithrombotic medication prescribed before the stroke, were investigated from 1995 to 2014. Multivariable logistic regression analyses were conducted to assess the factors associated with appropriate management. Results Of the 5041 patients on the register, 816 (16.2%) were diagnosed with AF before their stroke. AF related stroke increased substantially among Black Carribean and Black African patients, comprising 5% of the overall cohort in 1995-1998, increasing to 25% by 2011-2014 (p = 2]) increased from 9% (1995-1998) to 30% (2011-2014) (p 65) were significantly less likely to be prescribed an anticoagulant, with ethnicity, gender and deprivation showing no association with anticoagulation. Conclusions Most AF-related strokes occurred in people who could have been predicted to be at high risk before their stroke, yet were not prescribed optimal preventative treatment. The elderly,despite being at highest stroke risk, were rarely prescribed anticoagulants."
https://openalex.org/W2606228961,"Deficits in sequential motor learning have been observed in many patient populations. Having an understanding of the individual neural progression associated with sequential learning in healthy individuals may provide valuable insights for effective interventions with these patients. Due to individual variability in motor skill acquisition, the temporal course of such learning will be vary, suggesting a need for a more individualized approach. Knowing when a subject becomes aware of movement patterns may provide a marker with which to identify each individual's learning time course. To avoid interfering with the incidental nature of discovery during learning, such an indicator requires an indirect, behaviorally-based approach. In Part I, our study aimed to identify a reliable behavioral indicator predictive of the presence of incidental explicit awareness in a sequential motor learning task. Part II, utilized the predictive indicator and EEG to provide neural validation of perceptual processing changes temporally correlated with the indicator. Results of Part I provide a reliable predictive indicator for the timing of explicit awareness development. Results from Part II demonstrates strong classification reliability, as well as a significant neural correlation with behavior for subjects developing awareness (EXP), not observed with subjects without awareness (NOEXP). Additionally, a temporal correlation of peak activation between neural regions was noted over frontoparietal regions, suggesting that the incidental discovery of motor patterns may involve a facilitative network during awareness development. The proposed indicator provides a tool in which to further examine potential impacts of awareness associated with incidental, or exploratory, motor learning, while the individual nature of the indicator provides a tool for monitoring progress in rehabilitative, exploratory motor learning paradigms."
https://openalex.org/W2607014371,"In general, hemoproteins are capable of catalyzing redox reactions. Aldoxime dehydratase (OxdA), which is a unique heme-containing enzyme, catalyzes the dehydration of aldoximes to the corresponding nitriles. Its reaction is a rare example of heme directly activating an organic substrate, unlike the utilization of H2O2 or O2 as a mediator of catalysis by other heme-containing enzymes. While it is unknown whether OxdA catalyzes redox reactions or not, we here for the first time detected catalase activity (which is one of the redox activities) of wild-type OxdA, OxdA(WT). Furthermore, we constructed a His320 → Asp mutant of OxdA [OxdA(H320D)], and found it exhibits catalase activity. Determination of the kinetic parameters of OxdA(WT) and OxdA(H320D) revealed that their Km values for H2O2 were similar to each other, but the kcat value of OxdA(H320D) was 30 times higher than that of OxdA(WT). Next, we examined another redox activity and found it was the peroxidase activity of OxdAs. While both OxdA(WT) and OxdA(H320D) showed the activity, the activity of OxdA(H320D) was dozens of times higher than that of OxdA(WT). These findings demonstrated that the H320D mutation enhances the peroxidase activity of OxdA. OxdAs (WT and H320D) were found to catalyze another redox reaction, a peroxygenase reaction. During this reaction of OxdA(H320D) with 1-methoxynaphthalene as a substrate, surprisingly, the reaction mixture changed to a color different from that with OxdA(WT), which was due to the known product, Russig's blue. We purified and identified the new product as 1-methoxy-2-naphthalenol, which has never been reported as a product of the peroxygenase reaction, to the best of our knowledge. These findings indicated that the H320D mutation not only enhanced redox activities, but also significantly altered the hydroxylation site of the substrate."

The randomly occurring controller gain fluctuation phenomenon is investigated for non-fragile strategy. Moreover, the mixed time-varying delays composed of discrete and distributed delays are considered. By employing stochastic stability theory, synchronization criteria are developed for the Markov jump neural networks. On the basis of the derived criteria, the non-fragile synchronization controller is designed. Finally, an illustrative example is presented to demonstrate the validity of the control approach."
https://openalex.org/W2605470418,"Numerical value is long known to be associated with a variety of magnitude representations, such as size, time and space. The present study focused on the interactive relations of numerical magnitude with a spatial factor which is dominant in everyday vision and is often overlooked, namely, egocentric distance, or depth. We hypothesized that digits denoting large magnitudes are associated with large perceived distances, and vice versa. While the relations of numerical value and size have been long documented, effects of egocentric distance on numeral perception have been scarcely investigated, presumably due to the difficulty to disentangle size and depth factors within three-dimensional visual displays. The current study aimed to assess the potential linkage between egocentric distance and number magnitude, while neutralizing any perceived and/or physical size parameters of target digits. In Experiment 1, participants conducted a numeral size-classification task ('bigger or smaller than 5'), to which they responded with a near-to-body or a far-from-body key. Results revealed shorter responses for small than for large numbers when responded with a key positioned close to the body, and for large than small numbers when responded with a key positioned far from the body (regardless of hand-key mapping). Experiment 2 used verbal stimuli denoting near/remote concepts as irrelevant primes to target digits, further demonstrating a priming effect of conceived distance on numerical value processing. Collectively, our results suggest that distance magnitudes are associatively linked to numerical magnitudes and may affect digit processing independently of the effects of visual size."
