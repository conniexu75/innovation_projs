https://openalex.org/W2997968756,"Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) is the leading cause of death from infection worldwide1. The only available vaccine, BCG (Bacillus Calmette-Guérin), is given intradermally and has variable efficacy against pulmonary tuberculosis, the major cause of mortality and disease transmission1,2. Here we show that intravenous administration of BCG profoundly alters the protective outcome of Mtb challenge in non-human primates (Macaca mulatta). Compared with intradermal or aerosol delivery, intravenous immunization induced substantially more antigen-responsive CD4 and CD8 T cell responses in blood, spleen, bronchoalveolar lavage and lung lymph nodes. Moreover, intravenous immunization induced a high frequency of antigen-responsive T cells across all lung parenchymal tissues. Six months after BCG vaccination, macaques were challenged with virulent Mtb. Notably, nine out of ten macaques that received intravenous BCG vaccination were highly protected, with six macaques showing no detectable levels of infection, as determined by positron emission tomography-computed tomography imaging, mycobacterial growth, pathology and granuloma formation. The finding that intravenous BCG prevents or substantially limits Mtb infection in highly susceptible rhesus macaques has important implications for vaccine delivery and clinical development, and provides a model for defining immune correlates and mechanisms of vaccine-elicited protection against tuberculosis."

https://openalex.org/W2998110292,"More than one-third of Earth's landmass is drained by rivers that seasonally freeze over. Ice transforms the hydrologic1,2, ecologic3,4, climatic5 and socio-economic6-8 functions of river corridors. Although river ice extent has been shown to be declining in many regions of the world1, the seasonality, historical change and predicted future changes in river ice extent and duration have not yet been quantified globally. Previous studies of river ice, which suggested that declines in extent and duration could be attributed to warming temperatures9,10, were based on data from sparse locations. Furthermore, existing projections of future ice extent are based solely on the location of the 0-°C isotherm11. Here, using satellite observations, we show that the global extent of river ice is declining, and we project a mean decrease in seasonal ice duration of 6.10 ± 0.08 days per 1-°C increase in global mean surface air temperature. We tracked the extent of river ice using over 400,000 clear-sky Landsat images spanning 1984-2018 and observed a mean decline of 2.5 percentage points globally in the past three decades. To project future changes in river ice extent, we developed an observationally calibrated and validated model, based on temperature and season, which reduced the mean bias by 87 per cent compared with the 0-degree-Celsius isotherm approach. We applied this model to future climate projections for 2080-2100: compared with 2009-2029, the average river ice duration declines by 16.7 days under Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) 8.5, whereas under RCP 4.5 it declines on average by 7.3 days. Our results show that, globally, river ice is measurably declining and will continue to decline linearly with projected increases in surface air temperature towards the end of this century."
https://openalex.org/W2997822282,"Phase separation is a cooperative process, the kinetics of which underpin the orderly morphogenesis of domain patterns on mesoscopic scales1,2. Systems of highly degenerate frozen states may exhibit the rare and counterintuitive inverse-symmetry-breaking phenomenon3. Proposed a century ago4, inverse transitions have been found experimentally in disparate materials, ranging from polymeric and colloidal compounds to high-transition-temperature superconductors, proteins, ultrathin magnetic films, liquid crystals and metallic alloys5,6, with the notable exception of ferroelectric oxides, despite extensive theoretical and experimental work on the latter. Here we show that following a subcritical quench, the non-equilibrium self-assembly of ferroelectric domains in ultrathin films of Pb(Zr0.4Ti0.6)O3 results in a maze, or labyrinthine pattern, featuring meandering stripe domains. Furthermore, upon increasing the temperature, this highly degenerate labyrinthine phase undergoes an inverse transition whereby it transforms into the less-symmetric parallel-stripe domain structure, before the onset of paraelectricity at higher temperatures. We find that this phase sequence can be ascribed to an enhanced entropic contribution of domain walls, and that domain straightening and coarsening is predominantly driven by the relaxation and diffusion of topological defects. Computational modelling and experimental observation of the inverse dipolar transition in BiFeO3 suggest the universality of the phenomenon in ferroelectric oxides. The multitude of self-patterned states and the various topological defects that they embody may be used beyond current domain and domain-wall-based7 technologies by enabling fundamentally new design principles and topologically enhanced functionalities within ferroelectric films. The labyrinthine domain patterns formed in ultrathin films of ferroelectric oxides by subcritical quenching undergo an inverse phase transition to the less-symmetric parallel-stripe domain structure upon increasing temperature."

https://openalex.org/W2997341660,"This study aimed to identify the trends in the incidence of thymic cancer, i.e., thymoma, thymic carcinoma, and thymic neuroendocrine tumor, in the United States. Data from the United States Cancer Statistics (USCS) database (2001-2015) and those from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database (SEER 9 [1973-2015], SEER 13 [1992-2015], and SEER 18 [2000-2015]) were used in this study. All incidences were per 100,000 population at risk. The trends in incidence were described as annual percent change (APC) using the Joinpoint regression program. Data from the USCS (2001-2015) database showed an increase in thymic cancer diagnosis with an APC of 4.89% from 2001 to 2006, which is mainly attributed to the significant increase in the incidence of thymoma and thymic carcinoma particularly in women. The incidence of thymic cancer did not increase from 2006 to 2015, which may be attributed to the increase in the diagnosis of thymic carcinoma from 2004 to 2015, with a concomitant decrease in thymoma from 2008 to 2015. Before declining, the age-specific incidence of thymic cancer peaked at ages 70-74 years, with a peak incidence at 1.06 per 100,000 population, and decreased in older age groups. The incidence of thymic cancer was higher in men than in women. Asian/Pacific Islanders had the highest incidence of thymoma, followed by black and then white people. The incidence of thymic carcinoma increased from 2004 to 2015, with a concomitant decrease in thymoma from 2008 to 2015. Asian/Pacific Islanders had the highest incidence of thymoma than other races."
https://openalex.org/W2997653870,"Background Liquid biopsies enable the detection of circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA). However, the clinical significance of KRAS-mutated ctDNA for pancreatic cancer has been inconsistent with respect to its prognostic and predictive potential. Methods and findings A total of 422 blood samples were collected from 78 patients undergoing treatments for localized and metastatic pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma. KRAS mutation in tissues and KRAS ctDNA levels in plasma were determined by RASKET and droplet digital polymerase chain reaction. Longitudinal monitoring of KRAS ctDNA was performed to assess its significance for predicting recurrence and prognosis and for evaluating therapeutic responses to chemotherapy compared with carbohydrate antigen 19–9 (CA19-9). In 67 tumor tissues, discrepancies in point mutations of KRAS were rarely observed among individual patients, implying that one targeted point mutation of KRAS can be determined in tumor tissues prior to longitudinal blood monitoring. One-time blood assessment of KRAS-mutated ctDNA before surgery or chemotherapy was not clearly associated with recurrence and prognosis. Sequential blood monitoring was performed in 39 patients who underwent surgery for potentially resectable tumors. Increased CA19-9 levels were significantly associated with recurrence, but not prognosis (P<0.001, P = 1.0, respectively), whereas emergence of KRAS ctDNA was significantly associated with prognosis (P<0.001) regardless of recurrence. Furthermore, in 39 patients who did not undergo surgery, detection of KRAS ctDNA was a predictive factor for prognosis (P = 0.005). Multivariate analysis revealed that detection of KRAS ctDNA was the only independent prognostic factor regardless of tumor resection (hazard ratios = 54.5 for patients who underwent surgery and 10.1 for patients who did not undergo surgery; P<0.001 for both). Patients without emergence of KRAS ctDNA within 1 year after surgery showed significantly better prognosis irrespective of recurrence (P<0.001). No detection or disappearance of KRAS ctDNA within 6 months of treatment was significantly correlated with therapeutic responses to first-line chemotherapy (P<0.001). Changes in KRAS status provided critical information for the prediction of therapeutic responses. Conclusions Our study showed for the first time that detection of KRAS ctDNA levels within a short period enables the prediction of prognosis and therapeutic responses in patients with pancreatic cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2998545185,"Fragile X syndrome, the leading heritable form of intellectual disability, is caused by hypermethylation and transcriptional silencing of large (CGG) repeat expansions (> 200 repeats) in the 5′ untranslated region of the fragile X mental retardation 1 (FMR1) gene. As a consequence of FMR1 gene silencing, there is little or no production of FMR1 protein (FMRP), an important element in normal synaptic function. Although the absence of FMRP has long been known to be responsible for the cognitive impairment in fragile X syndrome, the relationship between FMRP level and cognitive ability (IQ) is only imprecisely understood. To address this issue, a high-throughput, fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) assay has been used to quantify FMRP levels in dermal fibroblasts, and the relationship between FMRP and IQ measures was assessed by statistical analysis in a cohort of 184 individuals with CGG-repeat lengths spanning normal (< 45 CGGs) to full mutation (> 200 CGGs) repeat ranges in fibroblasts. The principal findings of the current study are twofold: i) For those with normal CGG repeats, IQ is no longer sensitive to further increases in FMRP above an FMRP threshold of ~70% of the mean FMRP level; below this threshold, IQ decreases steeply with further decreases in FMRP; and ii) For the current cohort, a mean IQ of 85 (lower bound for the normal IQ range) is attained for FMRP levels that are only ~35% of the mean FMRP level among normal CGG-repeat controls. The current results should help guide expectations for efforts to induce FMR1 gene activity and for the levels of cognitive function expected for a given range of FMRP levels."
https://openalex.org/W2997415415,"Background Intracranial arteriovenous malformation (AVM) is a common cause of primary intracerebral hemorrhage in young adults. Lesions typically are sporadic and contain somatic mutations in KRAS or BRAF. The purpose of this study was to identify somatic mutations in a cohort of participants with brain AVM and to determine if any genotype-phenotype associations exist. Methods Human brain AVM specimens (n = 16) were collected during a clinically-indicated procedure and subjected to multiplex targeted sequencing using molecular inversion probe (MIP-seq) for mutations in KRAS, BRAF, HRAS, NRAS, and MAP2K1. Endothelial cells (ECs) were separated from non-ECs by immune-affinity purification. Droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) was used to confirm mutations and to screen for mutations that may have been missed by MIP-seq. Patient and AVM characteristics were recorded. Results We detected somatic mutations in 10 of 16 specimens (63%). Eight had KRAS mutations [G12D (n = 5), G12V (n = 3)] and two had BRAF mutations [V600E (n = 1), Q636X (n = 1)]. We found no difference in age, sex, presenting symptom, AVM location, or AVM size between patients with a confirmed mutation and those without. Nor did we observe differences in these features between patients with KRAS or BRAF mutations. However, two patients with BRAF mutations presented at an older age than other study participants. Conclusions Somatic mutations in KRAS and, less commonly in BRAF, are found in many but not all intracranial AVM samples. Currently, there are no obvious genotype-phenotype correlations that can be used to predict whether a somatic mutation will be detected and, if so, which gene will be mutated."
https://openalex.org/W2997129501,"The effects of various light intensities and spectral compositions on glutathione and amino acid metabolism were compared in wheat. Increase of light intensity (low-normal-high) was accompanied by a simultaneous increase in the shoot fresh weight, photosynthetic activity and glutathione content. These parameters were also affected by the modification of the ratios of blue, red and far-red components (referred to as blue, pink and far-red lights) compared to normal white light. The photosynthetic activity and the glutathione content decreased to 50% and the percentage of glutathione disulfide (characterising the redox state of the tissues) in the total glutathione pool doubled in far-red light. The alterations in the level and redox state of the antioxidant glutathione resulted from the effect of light on its synthesis as it could be concluded from the changes in the transcription of the related genes. Modification of the light conditions also greatly affected both the amount and the ratio of free amino acids. The total free amino acid content was greatly induced by the increase of light intensity and was greatly reduced in pink light compared to the normal intensity white light. The concentrations of most amino acids were similarly affected by the light conditions as described for the total free amino acid content but Pro, Met, Thr, ornithine and cystathionine showed unique response to light. As observed for the amino acid levels, the expression of several genes involved in their metabolism also enhanced due to increased light intensity. Interestingly, the modification of the spectrum greatly inhibited the expression of most of these genes. Correlation analysis of the investigated parameters indicates that changes in the light conditions may affect growth through the adjustment of photosynthesis and the glutathione-dependent redox state of the tissues. This process modifies the metabolism of glutathione and amino acids at transcriptional level."
https://openalex.org/W2997037077,"Proteinase-activated receptor (PAR)-4 is a member of the proteolytically-activated PAR family of G-protein–coupled receptors (GPCR) that represents an important target in the development of anti-platelet therapeutics. PARs are activated by proteolytic cleavage of their receptor N terminus by enzymes such as thrombin, trypsin, and cathepsin-G. This reveals the receptor-activating motif, termed the tethered ligand that binds intramolecularly to the receptor and triggers signaling. However, PARs are also activated by exogenous application of synthetic peptides derived from the tethered-ligand sequence. To better understand the molecular basis for PAR4-dependent signaling, we examined PAR4-signaling responses to a peptide library derived from the canonical PAR4-agonist peptide, AYPGKF-NH2, and we monitored activation of the Gαq/11-coupled calcium-signaling pathway, β-arrestin recruitment, and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway activation. We identified peptides that are poor activators of PAR4-dependent calcium signaling but were fully competent in recruiting β-arrestin-1 and -2. Peptides that were unable to stimulate PAR4-dependent calcium signaling could not trigger MAPK activation. Using in silico docking and site-directed mutagenesis, we identified Asp230 in the extracellular loop-2 as being critical for PAR4 activation by both agonist peptide and the tethered ligand. Probing the consequence of biased signaling on platelet activation, we found that a peptide that cannot activate calcium signaling fails to cause platelet aggregation, whereas a peptide that is able to stimulate calcium signaling and is more potent for β-arrestin recruitment triggered greater levels of platelet aggregation compared with the canonical PAR4 agonist peptide. These findings uncover molecular determinants critical for agonist binding and biased signaling through PAR4.

https://openalex.org/W2997697176,"Reduction of waste from food industry and food services is a current concern due to the large amount of waste generated, including peels and fruit seeds. The objective of this study was to obtain a flour produced from Cantaloupe melon seeds (Cucumis melo L. var. reticulatus) and to evaluate the viability of using the product as an ingredient in cake manufacturing. In this study, different formulations were developed: standard cake—0% (F1) and cakes containing melon seed flour as substitute of wheat flour in 10% (F2), 30% (F3), and 50% (F4) concentrations. Centesimal composition, dietary fibre, structural and morphological characterization, determination of mineral composition, and evaluation of fatty acids profile in melon seed flour were carried out. To determine the overall acceptance of cake formulations, sensory analysis was performed with 135 non-trained panelists, which also included the identification of sensorial attributes using the Just About Right ideal scale test. The results showed that the melon seed flour has considerable nutritional value, with 18% proteins, 3% moisture, 4% ash, 30% lipids, and 35% dietary fibre. Melon flour also has a significantly high content of minerals, mainly phosphorus (1507.62 mg/100 g), potassium (957.35 mg/100 g), and magnesium (504.03 mg/100 g). The polyunsaturated fatty acid fraction was the most abundant in melon seed flour, with predominance of omega-6 fatty acids (17.95 g/mg of sample). Sensorial analysis disclosed good acceptance for formulations containing 10% and 30% of melon seed flour, with the 10% formulation being the most accepted. The research showed the feasibility of using the melon seed flour in cake production, as well as the possibility of using food waste in restaurants and food industries in order to adhere to sustainable production actions."
https://openalex.org/W3106082145,"Galaxy clusters are the most massive virialized structures in the Universe and are formed through the gravitational accretion of matter over cosmic time. The discovery of an evolved galaxy cluster at redshift z=2, corresponding to a look-back time of 10.4 billion years, provides an opportunity to study its properties. The galaxy cluster XLSSC 122 was originally detected as a faint, extended X-ray source in the XMM Large Scale Structure survey and was revealed to be coincident with a compact over-density of galaxies with photometric redshifts of 1.9 +/- 0.2. Subsequent observations at millimetre wavelengths detected a Sunyaev-Zel'dovich decrement along the line of sight to XLSSC 122, thus confirming the existence of hot intracluster gas, while deep imaging spectroscopy from the European Space Agency's X-ray Multi-Mirror Mission (XMM-Newton) revealed an extended, X-ray bright gaseous atmosphere with a virial temperature of 60 million Kelvin, enriched with metals to the same extent as are local clusters. Here we report rest frame optical spectroscopic observations of XLSSC 122 and identify 37 member galaxies at a mean redshift of 1.98, corresponding to a look-back time of 10.4 billion years. We use photometry to determine a mean, dust-free stellar age of 2.98 billion years, indicating that star formation commenced in these galaxies at a mean redshift of 12, when the Universe was only 370 million years old. The full range of inferred formation redshifts, including the effects of dust, covers the interval from 7 to 13. These observations confirm that XLSSC 122 is a remarkably mature galaxy cluster with both evolved stellar populations in the member galaxies and a hot, metal-rich gas composing the intracluster medium."
https://openalex.org/W2998034877,"Studies have shown that muscle fatigue can lead to posture, joint angle, inter-joint coordination and variability alterations. However, the three-dimensional kinematic effects of localized muscular fatigue on a multijoint movement remain unclear. Healthy young adults (N = 17, 10 females) performed a standing repetitive pointing task when they were non-fatigued, and after localized muscle fatigue was induced at the elbow, the shoulder, and the trunk using isometric protocols performed until exhaustion. Joint angles and angular standard deviation (SD) of trunk, shoulder and elbow, and continuous relative phase (CRP) and CRP SD between trunk and shoulder, and shoulder and elbow were computed and compared between fatigue conditions. Results showed that trunk lateral flexion SD increased after fatigue of the elbow (0.1°, p = 0.04), shoulder (0.1°, p = 0.04) and trunk (0.1°, p<0.01). However, fatigue at different muscles brought different kinematic changes. Shoulder fatigue induced the greatest overall changes, with angular changes at all three joints. Trunk fatigue increased the shoulder horizontal abduction SD, elbow flexion SD and trunk-shoulder CRP. Elbow fatigue induced angular changes at trunk, shoulder and elbow, but did not affect CRP or CRP SD. This study highlights the crucial role of trunk variability in compensating for localized muscle fatigue during a repetitive upper limb task performed while standing."
https://openalex.org/W2997102954,"The current investigation compared the metabolic power and energetic characteristics in team sports with respect to positional lines and halves of match-play. Global positioning system (GPS) technology data were collected from 22 elite competitive hurling matches over a 3-season period. A total of 250 complete match-files were recorded with players split into positional groups of full-back; half-back; midfield; half-forward; full-forward. Raw GPS data were exported into a customized spreadsheet that provided estimations of metabolic power and speed variables across match-play events (average metabolic power [Pmet], high metabolic load distance [HMLD], total distance, relative distance, high-speed distance, maximal speed, accelerations, and deceleration). Pmet, HMLD, total, relative and high-speed distance were 8.9 ± 1.6 W·kg-1, 1457 ± 349 m, 7506 ± 1364 m, 107 ± 20 m·min-1 and 1169 ± 260 m respectively. Half-backs, midfielders and half-forwards outperformed full-backs (Effect Size [ES] = 1.03, 1.22 and 2.07 respectively), and full-forwards in Pmet (Effect Size [ES] = 1.70, 2.07 and 1.28 respectively), and HMLD (full-backs: ES = -1.23, -1.37 and -0.84 respectively, and full-forwards: ES = -1.77, -2.00 and -1.38 respectively). Half-backs (ES = -0.60), midfielders (ES = -0.81), and half-forwards (ES = -0.74) experienced a second-half temporal decrement in HMLD. The current investigation demonstrates that metabolic power may increase our understanding of the match-play demands placed on elite hurling players. Coaches may utilize these findings to construct training drills that replicate match-play demands."
https://openalex.org/W2997268496,"Background End-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients usually suffer from a high prevalence of central nervous system abnormalities, including cognitive impairment and emotional disorders, which severely influence their quality of life. There have been many neuroimaging research developments in ESRD patients with brain function abnormalities; however, the dysfunction of the salience network (SN) of them has received little attention. The purpose of this study was to investigate the changes of global functional connectivity density (gFCD) in brains of ESRD patients undergoing hemodialysis using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (re-fMRI). Methods re-fMRI data were collected from 30 ESRD patients undergoing hemodialysis (14 men, 38.33±7.44 years old) and 30 matched healthy controls (13 men, 39.17±5.7 years old). Neuropsychological tests including the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) and Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) were used to evaluate the neurocognitive and psychiatric conditions of the subjects. Blood biochemistry tests, including hemoglobin level, serum albumin level, blood urea level, serum phosphate, serum calcium, and parathyroid hormone level, and dialysis-related indicators, including blood pressure fluctuations in dialysis, single-pool Kt/V(spKt/V), and ultrafiltration volume of dialysis were obtained from the ESRD patients. A two-sample t-test was used to examine the group differences in gFCD between ESRD patients and healthy controls after controlling for age, gender and education. Results Compared with healthy controls, ESRD patients exhibited a significantly increased gFCD in the salience network, including the bilateral insula, and dorsal anterior cingulated cortex (dACC), and there was no significant correlation between gFCD and the structural mean grey matter volume in patients for every cluster in the brain regions showing significant different gFCD between the two groups. Furthermore, there were significant negative correlations between the degree of connectivity in the right insula and spKt/V. Conclusion Our findings revealed abnormal intrinsic dysconnectivity pattern of salience network-related regions in ESRD patients from the whole brain network perspective. The negative correlation between the right insula and spKt/V suggested that increased fractional removal of urea may reduce the pathological activity in the insula."
https://openalex.org/W2997147418,"Diets high in saturated fatty acids are linked to increased cardiovascular disease risk, whereas monounsaturated fatty acids have been associated with improved cardiovascular outcomes. Accordingly, cell culture studies have demonstrated that saturated fatty acids, particularly long chain saturated fatty acids such as palmitate, induce dysfunction and cell death in a variety of cell types, and monounsaturated fatty acids may confer protection against palmitate-mediated damage. The aim of the present study was to examine whether monounsaturated fatty acids could protect against palmitate-mediated cell death in endothelial cells, to determine if AMPK inactivation and activation (via compound C and AICAR, respectively) underlies both palmitate-induced damage and monounsaturated fatty acid-mediated protection, and to explore the role of ER stress in this context. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells were examined for cell viability and apoptosis following treatment for 24 hours with palmitate (0.25 and 0.5mM) alone or in combination with the monounsaturated fatty acids oleate or palmitoleate (0.25 and 0.5mM), AICAR, compound C, 4μ8C, or TUDCA. Compared to control cells, palmitate significantly decreased cell viability and increased apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner. The monounsaturated fatty acids oleate and palmitoleate completely prevented the cytotoxic effects of palmitate. Although palmitate induced markers of ER stress, chemical inhibition of ER stress did not prevent palmitate-induced lipoapoptosis. Conversely, the AMPK activator AICAR (0.1 and 0.5mM) conferred protection from palmitate mediated-alterations in viability, apoptosis and ER stress, whereas the AMPK inhibitor compound C (20 and 40μM) significantly exacerbated palmitate-mediated damage. Lastly, co-incubation with palmitate, monounsaturated fatty acids, and compound C significantly mitigated the protective effects of both oleate and palmitoleate. In conclusion, monounsaturated fatty acids confer protection against the cytotoxic effects of palmitate in vascular endothelial cells; and palmitate-mediated damage, as well as monounsaturated-mediated protection, are due in part to inactivation and activation, respectively, of the metabolic regulator AMPK. These results may have implications for understanding the deleterious effects of high saturated fat diets on cardiovascular dysfunction and disease risk."
https://openalex.org/W2997968653,"Hilly regions around the world are one of the most vulnerable places for inhabitation, where landslides represent a permanent threat for their population. In some particular cases, in the past, due to their topographic features, areas affected by massive landslides served a real opportunity for the location of strategic and fortified settlements. In this study, we have extended a previous approach of correlation between landslides and archaeological heritage, adding 14 new representative case studies of landslided hillforts, a new period with landslided hillforts, and a new typology of relationship (landslided tumuli) for establishing relative chronologies for landslide inventories. The landslide mapping presented here supplements a previous inventory, which now has 1211 landslides, and it is based on the interpretation of high-resolution DEMs, geomorphometric derivatives, remote sensing images, and field validation. For one of the most characteristic sites (Băiceni settlement, Iaşi County), we used Electrical Resistivity Tomography (ERT) to assess the geometry of the compound and complex landslides. The current approach allowed us to acquire a more accurate relative chronology of landslide activity during the Holocene and Upper Pleistocene, and more importantly, to establish the pattern of landslides evolution in the Moldavian Plateau, North-Eastern Romania. The relict landslides are Lateglacial and Lower Holocene, the old landslides are post-Holocene Climatic Optimum and pre-Medieval, while the recent landslides are post-Medieval. The landslide magnitude decreased continuously, the new events being retrogressive reactivations of earlier events scarps and landslide bodies (as shown by the ERT data). Further studies on absolute dating will improve the relative chronology. Still, while not all the landslides can be dated, the methodology that we describe can be applied to increase the spatial density of the relative chronology. The presented approach can be used in other regions all over the world to establish the relative age of landslide inventories when archaeological topography can be related to landslide topography."
https://openalex.org/W2998386539,"RNA modifications are recently emerged epigenetic modifications. These diverse RNA modifications have been shown to regulate multiple biological processes, including development. RNA modifications are dynamically controlled by the “writers, erasers, and readers”, where RNA modifying proteins are able to add, remove, and recognize specific chemical modification groups on RNAs. However, little is known about the ontogenic expression of these RNA modifying proteins in various organs, such as liver. In the present study, the hepatic mRNA expression of selected RNA modifying proteins involve in m6A, m1A, m5C, hm5C, m7G, and Ψ modifications was analyzed using the RNA-seq technique. Liver samples were collected from male C57BL/6 mice at several ages from prenatal through neonatal, infant, child to young adult. Results showed that most of the RNA modifying proteins were highly expressed in prenatal mouse liver with a dramatic drop at birth. After birth, most of the RNA modifying proteins showed a downregulation trend during liver maturation. Moreover, the RNA modifying proteins that belong to the same enzyme family were expressed at different abundances at the same ages in mouse liver. In conclusion, this study unveils that the mRNA expression of RNA modifying proteins follows specific ontogenic expression patterns in mice liver during maturation. These data indicated that the changes in expression of RNA modifying proteins might have a potential role to regulate gene expression in liver through alteration of RNA modification status."
https://openalex.org/W2998015975,"There are few effective targeted strategies to reduce hepatic ischemia-reperfusion (IR) injury, a contributor to poor outcomes in liver transplantation recipients. It has been proposed that IR injury is driven by the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). However, recent studies implicate other mediators of the injury response, including mitochondrial metabolic dysfunction. We examined changes in global gene expression after transient hepatic ischemia and at several early reperfusion times to identify potential targets that could be used to protect against IR injury. Male Wistar rats were subjected to 30 minutes of 70% partial warm ischemia followed by 0, 0.5, 2, or 6 hours of reperfusion. RNA was extracted from the reperfused and non-ischemic lobes at each time point for microarray analysis. Identification of differentially expressed genes and pathway analysis were used to characterize IR-induced changes in the hepatic transcriptome. Changes in the reperfused lobes were specific to the various reperfusion times. We made the unexpected observation that many of these changes were also present in tissue from the paired non-ischemic lobes. However, the earliest reperfusion time, 30 minutes, showed a marked increase in the expression of a set of immediate-early genes (c-Fos, c-Jun, Atf3, Egr1) that was exclusive to the reperfused lobe. We interpreted these results as indicating that this early response represented a tissue autonomous response to reperfusion. In contrast, the changes that occurred in both the reperfused and non-ischemic lobes were interpreted as indicating a non-autonomous response resulting from hemodynamic changes and/or circulating factors. These tissue autonomous and non-autonomous responses may serve as targets to ameliorate IR injury."

The combined activity of commercial antifungals and soluble and well-defined low molecular weight chitosan with average degrees of polymerization (DPn) of 17–62 (abbreviated C17 –C62) and fraction of acetylation (FA) of 0.15 against medically relevant yeast strains was studied. The minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) of C32 varied greatly among strains, ranging from > 5000 μg mL-1 (Candida albicans and C. glabrata) to < 4.9 (C. tropicalis). A synergistic effect was observed between C32 and the different antifungals tested for most of the strains. Testing of several CHOS preparations indicated that the highest synergistic effects are obtained for fractions with a DPn in the 30–50 range. Pre-exposure to C32 enhanced the antifungal effect of fluconazole and amphotericin B. A concentration-dependent post-antifungal effect conserved even 24 h after C32 removal was observed. The combination of C32 and commercial antifungals together or as part of a sequential therapy opens new therapeutic perspectives for treating yeast infections in humans."
https://openalex.org/W2998564252,"Drosophila has been instrumental as a model system in studying signal transduction and revealing molecular functions in development and human diseases. A point mutation in the Drosophila Janus kinase JAK (called hop) causes constitutive activation of the JAK/STAT pathway. We provide robust genetic evidence that the Homeodomain interacting protein kinase (Hipk) is required for endogenous JAK/STAT activity. Overexpression of Hipk can phenocopy the effects of overactive JAK/STAT mutations and lead to melanized tumors, and loss of Hipk can suppress the effects of hyperactive JAK/STAT. Further, the loss of the pathway effector Stat92E can suppress Hipk induced overgrowth. Interaction studies show that Hipk can physically interact with Stat92E and regulate Stat92E subcellular localization. Together our results show that Hipk is a novel factor required for effective JAK/STAT signaling."
https://openalex.org/W2996762696,"Retail chicken meat is a potential source of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Enterobacteriaceae (ESBL-E). In the past decade, vast national efforts were undertaken to decrease the antibiotic use in the veterinary sector, resulting in a 58% decrease in antibiotic sales in the sector between 2009 and 2014. This decrease in antibiotic use was followed by a decrease in ESBL-E prevalence in broilers. The current study investigates the prevalence of contamination with ESBL-E in retail chicken meat purchased in the Netherlands between December 2013 and August 2015. It looks at associations between the prevalence of contamination with ESBL-E and sample characteristics such as method of farming (free-range or conventional), supermarket chain of purchase and year of purchase. In the current study, 352 chicken meat samples were investigated for the presence of ESBL-E using selective culture methods. Six samples were excluded due to missing isolates or problems obtaining a good quality sequence leaving 346 samples for further analyses. Of these 346 samples, 188 (54.3%) were positive for ESBL-E, yielding 216 ESBL-E isolates (Escherichia coli (n = 204), Klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 11) and Escherichia fergusonii (n = 1)). All ESBL-E isolates were analysed using whole-genome sequencing. The prevalence of contamination with ESBL-E in retail chicken meat decreased from 68.3% in 2014 to 44.6% in 2015, absolute risk difference 23.7% (95% confidence interval (CI): 12.6% - 34.1%). The ESBL-E prevalence was lower in free-range chicken meat (36.4%) compared with conventional chicken meat (61.5%), absolute risk difference 25.2% (95% CI: 12.9% - 36.5%). The prevalence of contamination with ESBL-E varied between supermarket chains, the highest prevalence of contamination was found in supermarket chain 4 (76.5%) and the lowest in supermarket chain 1 (37.8%). Pairwise isolate comparisons using whole-genome multilocus sequence typing (wgMLST) showed that clustering of isolates occurs more frequently within supermarket chains than between supermarket chains. In conclusion, the prevalence of contamination with ESBL-E in retail chicken in the Netherlands decreased over time; nevertheless, it remains substantial and as such a potential source for ESBL-E in humans."
https://openalex.org/W2997232346,"Background Kyasanur Forest Disease (KFD) is a highly infectious viral illness transmitted by infected ticks through contact with monkeys and other forest animals. Till date there is no definite treatment available for KFD. Hence, vaccination is considered to be an important public health intervention to control KFD. This study aimed at estimating the vaccination coverage for primary and booster doses of KFD vaccine and exploring the perceived barriers to vaccination in the affected villages of Goa, India during 2015–18. Methodology & principal findings In this explanatory mixed methods study, vaccine coverage was estimated bydata obtained from the KFD vaccination registers maintained at the health centers catering to the KFD affected villages. To understand the barriers to vaccination,key informant interviews were conducted among implementing health officers, medical officers and nurses involved in vaccination. Perceptions of vaccinees and community members were studied through in-depth interviews and focus group discussions. Out of the 35,500 targeted population (6–65 years)for KFD vaccination, 32% received one dose and 13.2% received two doses. The coverage for first booster and annual booster was 4.9% and 0.5% respectively. The drop out from first to second and third doses was 57% and 85% respectively. 69% of doses were delivered during community outreach programmes and remaining at health facilities. Inadequate vaccine stock, inappropriate timing of vaccination campaign, lack of awareness and misconceptions related to indications of vaccines, travel distance for follow up doses given at community health centre and pain due to injection were perceived as reasons for poor vaccination coverage. Conclusions KFD vaccination coverage was poor in the villages affected by KFD in Goa. Both left-out and drop-out phenomena were observed in KFD vaccination. Vaccine implementation plan has to consider suitable time for the local people, maintain adequate vaccine stock and encourage community-based vaccination campaigns instead of facility-based to achieve optimal vaccine coverage."
https://openalex.org/W2998007192,"The present study was conducted in order to isolate, identify and characterize fowl aviadenovirus associated with inclusion body hepatitis (IBH) in three poultry farms (two of broiler chickens and one of breeder broiler chickens) in Morocco during 2015. Liver samples collected from affected three poultry farms were examined by histopathological examination. Tissue samples showing necrosis of hepatocytes associated with basophilic intranuclear inclusion bodies were homogenized and submitted to FAdV isolation in chicken embryo fibroblast (CEF) cell cultures and in SPF embryonated eggs. The cytopathic effect (CPE) was observed in the second passage with swelling and rounding of infected cells. The inoculated embryos were hemorrhagic and showed hepatitis with the presence of basophilic intra-nuclear inclusion bodies within hepatocytes. The presence of the virus was confirmed by conventional polymerase chain reaction based on hexon gene from all investigated samples. Moreover, phylogenetic analysis of the hexon gene revealed that FAdVs isolated from different affected poultry belonged to FAdV 11 serotype of the D genotype group. This work is the first isolation in cell culture and SPF embryonated eggs of FAdV from Moroccan broilers and breeder broiler chickens with IBH."
https://openalex.org/W2998307195,"Foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) is capable of infecting all cloven-hoofed domestic livestock species, including cattle, pigs, goats, and sheep. However, in contrast to cattle and pigs, the pathogenesis of FMDV in small ruminants has been incompletely elucidated. The objective of the current investigation was to characterize tissue- and cellular tropism of early and late stages of FMDV infection in sheep following three different routes of simulated natural virus exposure. Extensive post-mortem harvest of tissue samples at pre-determined time points during early infection (24 and 48 hours post infection) demonstrated that tissues specifically susceptible to primary FMDV infection included the paraepiglottic- and palatine tonsils, as well as the nasopharyngeal mucosa. Additionally, experimental aerosol inoculation of sheep led to substantial virus replication in the lungs at 24–48 hours post-inoculation. During persistent infection (35 days post infection), the paraepiglottic- and palatine tonsils were the only tissues from which infectious FMDV was recovered. This is strikingly different from cattle, in which persistent FMDV infection has consistently been located to the nasopharyngeal mucosa. Analysis of tissue sections by immunomicroscopy revealed a strict epithelial tropism during both early and late phases of infection as FMDV was consistently localized to cytokeratin-expressing epithelial cells. This study expands upon previous knowledge of FMDV pathogenesis in sheep by providing detailed information on the temporo-anatomic distribution of FMDV in ovine tissues. Findings are discussed in relation to similar investigations previously performed in cattle and pigs, highlighting similarities and differences in FMDV pathogenesis across natural host species."
https://openalex.org/W2998569388,"Background Precipitants of alcohol use transitions can differ from generalized risk factors. We extend prior research by predicting transitions in alcohol use disorder (AUD) during adolescence and emerging adulthood. Methods From 12/2009-9/2011, research assistants recruited 599 drug-using youth age 14–24 from Level-1 Emergency Department in Flint, Michigan. Youth were assessed at baseline and four biannual follow-ups, including a MINI Neuropsychiatric interview to diagnose AUD (abuse/dependence). We modeled AUD transitions using continuous time Markov Chains with transition probabilities modulated by validated measures of demographics, anxiety/depression symptoms, cannabis use, peer drinking, parental drinking, and violence exposure. Separate models were fit for underage (<21) and those of legal drinking age. Results We observed 2,024 pairs of consecutive AUD states, including 264 transitions (119 No-AUD→AUD; 145 AUD→No-AUD); 194 (32.4%) individuals were diagnosed with AUD at ≥1 assessment. Among age 14–20, peer drinking increased AUD onset (No-AUD→AUD transition) rates (Hazard ratio—HR = 1.70; 95%CI: [1.13,2.54]), parental drinking lowered AUD remission (AUD→No-AUD transition) rates (HR = 0.53; 95%CI: [0.29,0.97]), and cannabis use severity both hastened AUD onset (HR = 1.18; 95%CI: [1.06,1.32]) and slowed AUD remission (HR = 0.85; 95%CI: [0.76,0.95]). Among age 21–24, anxiety/depression symptoms both increased AUD onset rates (HR = 1.35; 95%CI: [1.13,1.60]) and decreased AUD remission rates (HR = 0.74; 95%CI: [0.63,0.88]). Friend drinking hastened AUD onset (HR = 1.18, 95%CI: [1.05,1.33]), and slowed AUD remission (HR = 0.84; 95%CI: [0.75,0.95]). Community violence exposure slowed AUD remission (HR = 0.69, 95%CI: [0.48,0.99]). In both age groups, males had >2x the AUD onset rate of females, but there were no sex differences in AUD remission rates. Limitations, most notably that this study occurred at a single site, are discussed. Conclusions Social influences broadly predicted AUD transitions in both age groups. Transitions among younger youth were predicted by cannabis use, while those among older youth were predicted more by internalizing symptoms and stress exposure (e.g., community violence). Our results suggest age-specific AUD etiology, and contrasts between prevention and treatment strategies."
https://openalex.org/W2996776727,"Upon myocardial damage, the release of cardiac proteins induces a strong antibody-mediated immune response, which can lead to adverse cardiac remodeling and eventually heart failure (HF). Stem cell therapy using mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) or cardiomyocyte progenitor cells (CPCs) previously showed beneficial effects on cardiac function despite low engraftment in the heart. Paracrine mediators are likely of great importance, where, for example, MSC-derived extracellular vesicles (EVs) also show immunosuppressive properties in vitro. However, the limited capacity of MSCs to differentiate into cardiac cells and the sufficient scaling of MSC-derived EVs remain a challenge to clinical translation. Therefore, we investigated the immunosuppressive actions of endogenous CPCs and CPC-derived EVs on antibody production in vitro, using both healthy controls and end-stage HF patients. Both MSCs and CPCs strongly inhibit lymphocyte proliferation and antibody production in vitro. Furthermore, CPC-derived EVs significantly lowered the levels of IgG1, IgG4, and IgM, especially when administered for longer duration. In line with previous findings, plasma cells of end-stage HF patients showed high production of IgG3, which can be inhibited by MSCs in vitro. MSCs and CPCs inhibit in vitro antibody production of both healthy and end-stage HF-derived immune cells. CPC-derived paracrine factors, such as EVs, show similar effects, but do not provide the complete immunosuppressive capacity of CPCs. The strongest immunosuppressive effects were observed using MSCs, suggesting that MSCs might be the best candidates for therapeutic targeting of B-cell responses in HF."
https://openalex.org/W2996858194,"Recently, extensive efforts have been made to understand the importance of the extra-renal uric acid (UA) excretion pathways and their contribution to UA-related diseases. However, the method typically used to measure UA concentrations in the intestinal lumen is difficult to real time and dynamic analysis. In this study, UA excretion in the rat intestinal lumen was measured in real time using an electrochemical method. A sensitive electrode to detect UA was constructed using a gold electrode modified with a mixed self-assembled monolayer. Excretion rate of UA in the intestine was calculated using time course data. A decrease in UA excretion rate was observed in the intestine after administration of serum UA-lowering drugs (benzbromarone, febuxostat, and topiroxostat). Inhibition of ATP-binding cassette transporter G2 (ABCG2) which has been reported as an important exporter of UA was suggested by administration of these drugs. On the other hand, an increase in excretion rate of UA was observed in the intestine of 5/6 nephrectomy rats. Upregulation of mRNA expression of the UA transporter organic anion transporter OAT3, which is related to the secretion at the basal membrane, suggested an enhancement of UA excretion by ABCG2, a high-capacity UA exporter. Observed urate excretion dynamics and mRNA expression of UA transporters in the intestine upon administration of serum UA-lowering drugs and 5/6 nephrectomy improve our understanding of the underlying mechanisms of intestinal UA excretion."
https://openalex.org/W2997649534,"Background A product of rational molecular design, PA-dPEG24 is the lead derivative of the PIC1 family of peptides with multiple functional abilities including classical complement pathway inhibition, myeloperoxidase inhibition, NET inhibition and antioxidant activity. PA-dPEG24 is composed of a sequence of 15 amino acid, IALILEPICCQERAA, and contains a monodisperse 24-mer PEGylated moiety at its C terminus to increase aqueous solubility. Here we explore a sarcosine substitution scan of the PA peptide to evaluate impacts on solubility in the absence of PEGylation and functional characteristics. Methods Sixteen sarcosine substitution variants were synthesized and evaluated for solubility in water. Aqueous soluble variants were then tested in standard complement, myeloperoxidase, NET formation and antioxidant capacity assays. Results Six sarcosine substitution variants were aqueous soluble without requiring PEGylation. Substitution with sarcosine of the isoleucine at position eight yielded a soluble peptide that surpassed the parent molecule for complement inhibition and myeloperoxidase inhibition. Substitution with sarcosine of the cysteine at position nine improved solubility, but did not otherwise change the functional characteristics compared with the parent compound. However, replacement of both vicinal cysteine residues at positions 9 and 10 with a single sarcosine residue reduced functional activity in most of the assays tested. Conclusions Several of the sarcosine PIC1 variant substitutions synthesized yielded improved solubility as well as a number of unanticipated structure-function findings that provide new insights. Several sarcosine substitution variants demonstrate increased potency over the parent peptide suggesting enhanced therapeutic potential for inflammatory disease processes involving complement, myeloperoxidase, NETs or oxidant stress."
https://openalex.org/W2998530075,"The high temporal and intensity resolution of modern accelerometers gives the opportunity of detecting even tiny body movements via motion-based sensors. In this paper, we demonstrate and evaluate an approach to identify pulse waves and heartbeats from acceleration data of the human wrist during sleep. Specifically, we have recorded simultaneously full-night polysomnography and 3d wrist actigraphy data of 363 subjects during one night in a clinical sleep laboratory. The acceleration data was segmented and cleaned, excluding body movements and separating episodes with different sleep positions. Then, we applied a bandpass filter and a Hilbert transform to uncover the pulse wave signal, which worked well for an average duration of 1.7 h per subject. We found that 81 percent of the detected pulse wave intervals could be correctly associated with the R peak intervals from independently recorded ECGs and obtained a median Pearson cross-correlation of 0.94. While the low-frequency components of both signals were practically identical, the high-frequency component of the pulse wave interval time series was increased, indicating a respiratory modulation of pulse transit times, probably as an additional contribution to respiratory sinus arrhythmia. Our approach could be used to obtain long-term nocturnal heartbeat interval time series and pulse wave signals from wrist-worn accelerometers without the need of recording ECG or photoplethysmography. This is particularly useful for an ambulatory monitoring of high-risk cardiac patients as well as for assessing cardiac dynamics in large cohort studies solely with accelerometer devices that are already used for activity tracking and sleep pattern analysis."

Quantitative analysis of LCN2 has been made with flow cytometry. Lens status, duration of symptoms, quadrants of detachment, as well as level of PVR, were assessed. Statistical analysis included Mann-Whitney test, Kruskal-Wallis test, t-test, Spearman's correlation coefficient and Fisher's exact test.Median LCN2 was significantly higher in the RRD group as compared to control (p<0.001). Within the RRD group there was a positive correlation between LCN2 and PVR grade (rs = 0.94, p<0.001). Median LCN2 was 35,759 pg/ml (IR = 55,347) in grade C PVR, 9,387 pg/ml (IR = 3721) in grade B, 4,917 pg/ml (IR = non computable) in grade A and 3,921 pg/ml (2132) in the no PVR group. Median LCN2 was also significantly higher in pseudophakic patients as compared to phakic patients (p = 0.007). LCN2 also correlates with the extend of detachment (≤2 vs >2 quadrants, p<0.001) as well as with duration of symptoms (rs = 0.87, p<0.001). After multivariate linear regression analysis, only PVR was independently related with LCN2 concentration. In particular, increased PVR grading was associated with increased LCN2 concentration (coefficient b = 2.97, 95% confidence interval = 1.89 to 4.67, p<0.001).A positive correlation between vitreous levels of LCN2 and PVR grading reveals a potential role in the pathogenesis and progression of PVR. Further studies could elucidate if LCN2 could be a therapeutic target."
https://openalex.org/W2998425706,"Schizophrenia (SZ) is a serious and incurable mental disorder characterized by clinical manifestations of positive and negative symptoms and cognitive dysfunction. High-frequency deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the ventral hippocampus (VHP) has been recently applied as a therapeutic approach for SZ in both experimental and clinical studies. However, little is known about the precise mechanism of VHP-DBS treatment for SZ and the role of hippocampal cell activation in the pathogenesis of SZ. With optogenetic technology in this study, we tried to inhibit neuronal activity in the VHP which has dense projections to the prefrontal cortex, before measuring long stumulus-induced delay eyeblink conditioning (long-dEBC) in a rodent model of SZ. Rats were administrated with phencyclidine (PCP, 3 mg/kg, 1/d, ip) for successive 7 days before optogenetic intervention. The current data show that PCP administration causes significant impairment in the acquisition and timing of long-dEBC; the inhibition of bilateral VHP neurons alleviates the decreased acquisition and impaired timing of longd-dEBC in PCP-administered rats. The results provide direct evidence at the cellular level that the inhibition of VHP neuronal cells may be a prominent effect of hippocampal DBS intervention, and increased activity in the hippocampal network play a pivotal role in SZ."
https://openalex.org/W2996894066,"Background 
Motor vehicle collisions comprise the majority of occupational-related fatalities in the United States and West Virginia has one of the highest occupational-related fatality rates in the nation. The purpose of this study was to compare work and non-work-related collisions, crash locations, and the characteristics of in-state and out-of-state drivers ≥18 years of age who were fatally injured in work-related collisions in West Virginia.


Methodology 
Data were from the 2000–2017 Fatality Analysis Reporting System. Work and non-work-related crashes and characteristics in-state vs. out-of-state drivers were compared using binary and multivariable logistic regression analyses. Crash locations were compared via spatial analyses using kernel density estimations.


Results 
Among the 5,835 individuals fatally injured in crashes, 209 were designated ‘at work’. The odds of being a work-related crash were 85% lower [Odds Ratio (OR) = 0.15; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.04, 0.49] among those testing positive for alcohol, but 2.5 times greater (OR = 2.56; 95% CI: 1.16, 5.65) among those holding a commercial driver’s license. The odds of being an in-state driver were 75% lower (OR = 0.25; 95% CI: 0.12, 0.53) among those wearing a safety belt, but 2.7 times greater among workers testing drug positive (OR = 2.67; 95% CI: 1.10, 6.52). In-state drivers were also less likely to be driving a large truck or be involved in single vehicle collisions and less likely to experience crashes on weekends, nights, or on highways. Spatial patterns of crash locations varied slightly between workers and non-workers.


Conclusions 
Work-related crashes differed greatly from non-work-related crashes in West Virginia. Stark differences existed between in-state and out-of-state workers and their crashes. Various avenues for workplace safety interventions exist, including seatbelt initiatives and drug testing policies for non-commercial drivers, which could help mitigate West Virginia’s elevated, occupational-related, traffic fatality rate."
https://openalex.org/W2997378949,"Objective Cardiovascular disease is an important contributor to the mortality rate of patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), which is related to SLE disease activity. Fragmented QRS (fQRS) complexes, defined by additional spikes in the QRS complex, are useful for identifying myocardial scars on electrocardiography and can be an independent predictor of cardiac events. We aimed to assess the relationship between disease activity in patients with SLE and fQRS at the time of diagnosis. Methods Forty-four patients with SLE were included. Patients with cardiac diseases, other rheumatic diseases, and prior treatment at the time of electrocardiography measurement were excluded. The appearance of fQRS represented exposure. The primary outcome was SLE Disease Activity Index 2000 (SLEDAI-2K). Multiple regression analysis was conducted to assess the association between fQRS and SLEDAI-2K adjusted for age, sex, and time from the estimated onset date to the date of diagnosis. Results Among patients with SLE at diagnosis, 26 (59.1%) had fQRS. The median SLEDAI-2K was 18 (interquartile range [IQR], 12–22) and 9 (IQR, 8–15) in the fQRS(+) and fQRS(-) groups, respectively. SLEDAI-2K was significantly higher in the fQRS(+) group than in the fQRS(-) group (regression coefficient, 2.69; 95% confidence interval, 0.76–4.61; p = 0.008). Conclusion Our results suggested that fQRS(+) patients with SLE had high disease activity. fQRS could likely detect subclinical myocardial involvement in patients with SLE and predict long-term occurrence of cardiac events."

Most dogs presented with mild hypoxemia and normocapnia, and all with increased alveolar-arterial difference for O2 (A-aDO2). In computed tomography, abnormal lung patterns, such as atelectasis and parenchymal band, were detected in all dogs, consistent with the regions affected by CBM.

https://openalex.org/W2998052606,"Human networks and engineered systems are traditionally designed to maximize efficiency. Ecosystems on the other hand, achieve long-term robustness and sustainability by maintaining a unique balance between pathway efficiency and redundancy, measured in terms of the number of flow pathways available for a given unit of flow at any node in the network. Translating this flow-based ecosystem robustness into an engineering context supports the creation of new robust and sustainable design guidelines for engineered systems. Thermodynamic cycles provide good examples of human systems where simple and clearly defined modifications can be made to increase efficiency. Twenty-three variations on the Brayton and Rankine cycles are used to understand the relationship between design decisions that maximize a system’s efficient use of energy (measured by thermodynamic first law efficiency) and ecological measures of robustness and structural efficiency. The results reveal that thermodynamic efficiency and ecological pathway efficiency do not always correlate and that while on average modifications to increase energy efficiency reduce the robustness of the system, the engineering understanding of ecological network design presented here can enable decisions that are able to increase both energy efficiency and robustness."

It is essential to understand the FMD phylodynamics to assist in the disease-eradication. FMD critically affects the Sri Lankan cattle industry causing substantial economic losses. Even though many studies have covered the serotyping and genotyping of FMD virus (FMDV) in Sri Lanka, there is a significant knowledge gap exists in understanding the FMDV phylodynamics in the country. In the present study, the VP1 genomic region of FMD viral isolates belonging to serotype C from Sri Lanka and other South Asian countries were sequenced. All the published VPI sequences of serotype C and most of the published VP1 sequences for lineage ME-SA/Ind-2001d of serotype O from Sri Lanka, India, and other South Asian countries were retrieved. The datasets of serotype C and serotype O were separately analyzed using Bayesian, maximum likelihood, and phylogenetic networking methods to infer the transboundary movements and evolutionary aspects of the FMDV incursions in Sri Lanka. A model-based approach was used to detect any possible recombination events of FMDV incursions. Our results revealed that the invasions of the topotype ASIA of serotype C and the lineage ME-SA/Ind-2001d have a similar pattern of transboundary movement and evolution. The haplotype networks and phylogenies developed in the present study confirmed that FMDV incursions in Sri Lanka mainly originate from the Indian subcontinent, remain quiet after migration, and then cause outbreaks in a subsequent year. Since there are no recombination events detected among the different viral strains across serotypes and topotypes, we can assume that the incursions tend to show the independent evolution compared to the ancestral viral populations. Thus, we highlight the need for thorough surveillance of cattle/ruminants and associated product-movement into Sri Lanka from other regions to prevent the transboundary movement of FMDV."
https://openalex.org/W2997794025,"Factors maintaining the populations of diverse species that share limited resources or prey remain important issues in ecology. In the present study, I propose that heritable intraspecific variation in prey, which facilitates natural selection, is a key to solve this issue. A mathematical model reveals that diverse genotypes in a prey promote the coexistence of multiple predator species. When two predators share a prey with multiple genotypes, evolution nearly selects the two prey genotypes. Through analysis, I establish a condition of coexistence of such multiple predator-one prey interaction with two genotypes. If each prey type has high defensive capacity against different predator species, stable coexistence is likely to occur. Particularly, interspecific variations of life-history parameters allow the coexistence equilibrium to be stable. In addition, rapid evolution in a prey allows more than two predator species to coexist. Furthermore, mutation tends to stabilize otherwise unstable systems. These results suggest that intraspecific variation in a prey plays a key role in the maintenance of diverse predator species by driving adaptive evolution."
https://openalex.org/W2996898831,"Understanding the mechanisms triggering variation of cell wall degradability is a prerequisite to improving the energy value of lignocellulosic biomass for animal feed or biorefinery. Here, we implemented a multiscale systems approach to shed light on the genetic basis of cell wall degradability in maize. We demonstrated that allele replacement in two pairs of near-isogenic lines at a region encompassing a major quantitative trait locus (QTL) for cell wall degradability led to phenotypic variation of a similar magnitude and sign to that expected from a QTL analysis of cell wall degradability in the F271 × F288 recombinant inbred line progeny. Using DNA sequences within the QTL interval of both F271 and F288 inbred lines and Illumina RNA sequencing datasets from internodes of the selected near-isogenic lines, we annotated the genes present in the QTL interval and provided evidence that allelic variation at the introgressed QTL region gives rise to coordinated changes in gene expression. The identification of a gene co-expression network associated with cell wall-related trait variation revealed that the favorable F288 alleles exploit biological processes related to oxidation-reduction, regulation of hydrogen peroxide metabolism, protein folding and hormone responses. Nested in modules of co-expressed genes, potential new cell-wall regulators were identified, including two transcription factors of the group VII ethylene response factor family, that could be exploited to fine-tune cell wall degradability. Overall, these findings provide new insights into the regulatory mechanisms by which a major locus influences cell wall degradability, paving the way for its map-based cloning in maize."

Three vectors were constructed for expressing rColH(FM, mutant for fat melting, with 6xHis tag), rColH(WT, wild-type, with 6xHis tag), and rColH(E451D, E451D mutant, without 6xHis tag) in Escherichia coli. rColH(FM) & rColH(WT) were purified by Ni Sepharose on a laboratory scale, while rColH(E451D) was purified by five chromatography purification steps on a large scale. Then, the stability of rColH(FM) and rColH(WT) was tested by SDS-PAGE to investigate the influence of the E451D mutation on stability. Afterwards, the enzyme kinetics of ColH (mutant or wild-type, with or without His tag) were investigated and compared. Finally, the adipolysis of rColH(E451D) at various doses was tested in vitro and in vivo. The ultrasound results in minipigs suggested that effective adipolysis was induced by rColH(E451D) compared with the negative control, and the histological results suggest dose-dependent fibrosis, necrosis, inflammation and cholesterol cleft formation. These findings indicate the possibility of rColH(E451D) becoming a new injectable drug to safely remove subcutaneous adipose."
https://openalex.org/W2998428345,"Cell free DNA (cfDNA) in plasma has been described as a potential diagnostic indicator for a variety of clinical conditions, including neonatal hypoxia. Neonatal hypoxia or perinatal asphyxia is a severe medical condition caused by a temporary interruption in oxygen availability during birth. Previously, we have reported temporal changes of cfDNA detected in blood in a newborn piglet model of perinatal asphyxia. However, cfDNA can also be found in other body liquids, opening for a less invasive diagnostic prospective. The objective of this study was to test and establish a reliable method for the isolation and quantification of cfDNA from urine and to explore changes in the quantities of cfDNA using a newborn piglet model of asphyxia. Animals were exposed to hypoxia-reoxygenation (n = 6), hypoxia-reoxygenation + hypothermia (n = 6) or were part of the sham-operated control group (n = 6) and urine samples (n = 18) were collected at 570 minutes post-intervention. Two alternative applications of cfDNA measurement were tested, an indirect method comprising a centrifugation step together with DNA extraction with magnetic beads versus a direct assessment based on two centrifugation steps. CfDNA concentrations were determined by a fluorescent assay using PicoGreen and by qRT-PCR. Genomic (gDNA) and mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) cfDNA were determined in parallel, taking into account potential differences in the rates of damages caused by oxidative stress. In contrast to previous publications, our results indicate that the direct method is insufficient. Application of the indirect method obtained with the fluorescence assay revealed mean cfDNA levels (SD) of 1.23 (1.76) ng/ml for the hypoxia samples, 4.47 (6.15) ng/ml for the samples exposed to hypoxia + hypothermia and 2.75 (3.62) ng/ml for the control animals. The mean cfDNA levels in piglets exposed to hypoxia + hypothermia revealed significantly higher cfDNA amounts compared to mean cfDNA levels in the samples purely exposed to hypoxia (p < 0.05); however, no significant difference could be determined when compared to the control group (p = 0.09). Application of the indirect method by qRT-PCR revealed mean cfDNA levels of mtDNA and gDNA at the detection limit of the technique and thus no reliable statistics could be performed between the observed cfDNA levels in the investigated groups. The methodology for detection and monitoring of cfDNA in urine has to be further optimized before it can be applied in a clinical setting in the future."
https://openalex.org/W2996768547,"Jamin-Lebedeff (JL) polarization interference microscopy is a classical method for determining the change in the optical path of transparent tissues. Whilst a differential interference contrast (DIC) microscopy interferes an image with itself shifted by half a point spread function, the shear between the object and reference image in a JL-microscope is about half the field of view. The optical path difference (OPD) between the sample and reference region (assumed to be empty) is encoded into a color by white-light interference. From a color-table, the Michel-Levy chart, the OPD can be deduced. In cytology JL-imaging can be used as a way to determine the OPD which closely corresponds to the dry mass per area of cells in a single image. Like in other interference microscopy methods (e.g. holography), we present a phase retrieval method relying on single-shot measurements only, thus allowing real-time quantitative phase measurements. This is achieved by adding several customized 3D-printed parts (e.g. rotational polarization-filter holders) and a modern cellphone with an RGB-camera to the Jamin-Lebedeff setup, thus bringing an old microscope back to life. The algorithm is calibrated using a reference image of a known phase object (e.g. optical fiber). A gradient-descent based inverse problem generates an inverse look-up-table (LUT) which is used to convert the measured RGB signal of a phase-sample into an OPD. To account for possible ambiguities in the phase-map or phase-unwrapping artifacts we introduce a total-variation based regularization. We present results from fixed and living biological samples as well as reference samples for comparison."
https://openalex.org/W2996923411,"The biological relevance of fibrinolysis to the host response to sepsis is illustrated by pathogens such as S. pyogenes and Y. pestis, whose virulence factors are proteins that challenge the balance between pro- and anti-fibrinolytic factors of the host, and by the consistent finding of hypofibrinolysis in the early stages of sepsis. Whether this hypofibrinolytic response is beneficial or detrimental to the host, by containing the spread of pathogens while at the same time limiting the access of immune cell to infectious foci, is still a matter of debate. Tranexamic acid (TnxAc) is an antifibrinolytic agent that is being increasingly used to prevent and control bleeding in conditions such as elective orthopedic surgery, trauma, and post-partum-hemorrhage, which are frequently followed by infection and sepsis. Here we used a model of polymicrobial sepsis to evaluate whether hypofibrinolysis induced by TnxAc influenced survival, tissue injury and pathogen spread. Mice were treated with two doses of TnxAc bid for 48h, and then sepsis was induced by cecal ligation and puncture. Despite the induction of hypofibrinolysis by TnxAc, no difference could be observed in survival, tissue injury (measured by biochemical and histological parameters), cytokine levels or pathogen spread. Our results contribute with a new piece of data to the understanding of the complex interplay between fibrinolysis and innate immunity. While our results do not support the use of TnxAc in sepsis, they also address the thrombotic safety of TnxAc, a low cost and widely used agent to prevent bleeding."
https://openalex.org/W2997891333,"Many ground-nesting bird species are suffering from habitat loss and population decline. Data on population ecology and demography in colonies of threatened species are thus essential for designing effective conservation protocols. Here, we used extensive ringing and observation data to estimate directly, for the first time, the survival rate of juvenile and adult Little Tern (Sternula albifrons), as well as testing for a possible effect of age on probability of survival. We estimated adult annual survival rate to be 0.77, and juvenile (first year) survival to be 0.49 with a possible linear decrease in the survival rate of the juveniles that ranged from 0.681 to 0.327. We found no evidence that survival was age-dependent among the early age classes after the first year. We discuss these findings in light of survival estimates for other species, and their implications for the Little Tern conservation."
https://openalex.org/W2998164049,"Infants born prematurely or with low birth weights are more susceptible to kidney dysfunction throughout their lives. Multiple proteins measured in urine are noninvasive biomarkers of subclinical kidney damage, but few studies have examined the joint effects of multiple biomarkers. We conducted an exploratory study of 103 children in the Programing Research in Obesity, Growth, Environment, and Social Stressors (PROGRESS) longitudinal birth cohort, and measured nine proteins selected a priori in banked spot urine samples collected at ages 4–6. The goal of our study was to explore the combined effects of kidney damage biomarkers previously associated with birth outcomes. To do this, we generated kidney biomarker indices using weighted quantile sum regression and assessed associations with length of gestation or birth weight. A decile increase in each kidney biomarker index was associated with 2-day shorter gestations (β = -2.0, 95% CI: -3.2, -0.9) and 59-gram lower birth weights (β = -58.5, 95% CI: -98.3, -18.7), respectively. Weights highlighting the contributions showed neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) (60%) and osteopontin (19%) contributed most to the index derived for gestational age. NGAL (66%) and beta-2-microglobulin (10%) contributed most to the index derived for birth weight. Joint analyses of multiple kidney biomarkers can provide integrated measures of kidney dysfunction and improved statistical assessments compared to biomarkers assessed individually. Additionally, shorter gestations and lower birth weights may contribute to subclinical kidney damage measurable in childhood."
