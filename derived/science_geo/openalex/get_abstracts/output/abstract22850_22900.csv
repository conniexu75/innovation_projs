https://openalex.org/W1988455121,U5 snRNA is an essential pre-mRNA splicing factor whose function remains enigmatic. Specific mutations in a conserved single-stranded loop sequence in yeast U5 snRNA can activate cleavage of G1----A mutant pre-mRNAs at aberrant 5' splice sites and facilitate processing of dead-end lariat intermediates to mRNA. Activation of aberrant 5' cleavage sites involves base pairing between U5 snRNA and nucleotides upstream of the cleavage site. Processing of dead-end lariat intermediates to mRNA correlates with base pairing between U5 and the first two bases in exon 2. The loop sequence in U5 snRNA may therefore by intimately involved in the transesterification reactions at 5' and 3' splice sites. This pattern of interactions is strikingly reminiscent of exon recognition events in group II self-splicing introns and is consistent with the notion that U5 snRNA may be related to a specific functional domain from a group II-like self-splicing ancestral intron.
https://openalex.org/W2055650366,"We have identified an estrogen-responsive enhancer element (DH3 ERE) in the estrogen-induced DNAase I-hypersensitive region III of the chicken ovalbumin gene, which is located ∼3.3 kb upstream from the mRNA start site and does not contain palindromic ERE. Four TGACC half-palindromic motifs, separated from each other by more than 100 bp, are responsible for conferring estrogen inducibility either to the proximal ovalbumin gene promoter or to heterologous promoters. Thus, widely spaced half-palindromic ERE motifs can act synergistically. Each half-palindromic motif was shown to bind the estrogen receptor (ER) with a low efficiency in vitro. However, two widely spaced half-palindromic motifs bound the ER cooperatively, much more efficiently than expected from binding to isolated half-ERE motifs. The ovalbumin promoter half-palindromic ERE motif located close to the TATA box was required for the activity of the distal DH3 ERE, but could be replaced by the binding sites of other transactivators."
https://openalex.org/W1995272144,"The promoter specificity of transcriptional activators is generally thought to be conferred by the specificity of the DNA-binding domain, which brings the activation domain to the appropriate promoter sequence. We show here, however, that Oct-1 and Oct-2 can differentially activate transcription not through DNA binding specificity but instead through the use of promoter-selective activation domains. These distinct activation domains lead to stimulation of the U2 small nuclear RNA promoter by Oct-1 and an mRNA promoter by Oct-2. An Oct-2 variant, called Oct-2B, differs from Oct-2 by an Oct-1-related C-terminal extension that results from alternative splicing. This variant gains the ability to activate the U2 small nuclear RNA promoter. Thus, the promoter selectivity of a transcriptional activator can be changed, in this case by alternative splicing, without affecting its DNA binding specificity."
https://openalex.org/W2157640447,"The kinetic behavior of the melanin biosynthesis pathway from L-tyrosine up to dopachrome has been studied from experimental and simulation assays. The reaction mechanism proposed is based on a single active site of tyrosinase. The diphenolase and monophenolase activities of tyrosinase involve one single (oxidase) and two overlapped (hydroxylase and oxidase) catalytic cycles, respectively. The stoichiometry of the pathway implies that one molecule of tyrosinase must accomplish two turnovers in the hydroxylase cycle for each one in the oxidase cycle. Furthermore, the steady-state rates of dopachrome production and O2 consumption from tyrosine and L-dopa, also fulfill the stoichiometry of the pathway: VO2T/VDCT = 1.5 and VO2T/VDCD = 1.0, where T represents L-tyrosine, DC represents dopachrome, and D represents L-dopa. It has been ascertained by high performance liquid chromatography that in the steady-state, a quantity of dopa is accumulated ([D]ss) which fulfills the constant ratio [D]ss = R[T]0. Taking this ratio into account, an analytical expression has been deduced for the monophenolase activity of tyrosinase. In this expression kcatT congruent to (2/3)k3(K1/K2)R, revealing that kcatT is not a true catalytic constant, since it also depends on equilibrium constants and on the experimental R = 0.057. This low value explains the lower catalytic efficiency of tyrosinase on tyrosine than on dopa, (VmaxT/KmT)/(VmaxD/KmD) congruent to (2/3)R, since a significant portion of tyrosinase is scavenged from the catalytic turnover as dead-end complex EmetT in the steady-state of the monophenolase activity of tyrosinase."
https://openalex.org/W1552444104,"Elevated fibronectin (Fn) and Fn fragment concentrations are found in the synovial fluid of osteoarthritic and rheumatoid arthritic patients. Fn has been shown to affect expression of chondrocytic matrix proteins, and Fn fragments have been shown to elevate gene expression of neutral proteinases in synoviocytes. For these reasons, we tested the effects of Fn fragments on protease release and resultant proteoglycan release from cartilage in serum-free bovine articular cartilage explant cultures. We have found that 1 microM amino-terminal 29- and 50-kDa gelatin-binding Fn fragments caused over a 50-fold enhancement of gelatinolytic and collagenolytic proteinase release with a 23-fold enhancement of proteoglycan (PG) release. Release was significant at fragment concentrations as low as 20 nM. An integrin-binding 140-kDa fragment mixture was the least active fragment, whereas native Fn had little activity. The relative activities of the fragments correlated with their relative abilities to bind to cartilage. The RGDS integrin-recognition peptide also caused release, although sequence mutants did not. PG release was blocked by actinomycin D, cycloheximide, and deoxyglucose. Fn fragment-mediated PG release was decreased in 10% serum by over 10-fold but was still 2-fold greater than in controls. In the presence of insulin-like growth factor-1, PG release was as great as without serum. We suggest that Fn fragments, as found in diseased synovial fluid, may contribute to protease-mediated damage to cartilage."
https://openalex.org/W1499429603,"The induction of liver cytochrome P450 4A-catalyzed fatty acid omega-hydroxylase activity by clofibrate and other peroxisome proliferators has been proposed to be causally linked to the ensuing proliferation of peroxisomes in rat liver. Since female rats are less responsive than males to peroxisome proliferation induced by clofibrate, the influence of gender and hormonal status on the basal and clofibrate-inducible expression of the 4A P450s was examined. Northern blot analysis using gene-specific oligonucleotide probes revealed that in the liver, P450 4A1 and 4A3 mRNAs are induced to a much greater extent in male as compared to female rats following clofibrate treatment, whereas P450 4A2 mRNA is altogether absent from female rat liver. Male-specific expression of P450 4A2 mRNA was also observed in kidney. Western blot analysis indicated that a similar sex dependence characterizes both the basal expression and the clofibrate inducibility of the corresponding P450 4A proteins. This suggests that the lower responsiveness of female rats to clofibrate-induced peroxisome proliferation may reflect the lower inducibility of the P450 4A fatty acid hydroxylase enzymes in this sex. Investigation of the contribution of pituitary-dependent hormones to the male-specific expression of 4A2 revealed that this P450 mRNA is fully suppressed in liver following exposure to the continuous plasma growth hormone profile that characterizes adult female rats; in this and other regards liver P450 4A2 is regulated in a manner that is similar, but not identical to, P450 3A2, a male-specific testosterone 6 beta-hydroxylase. In contrast, kidney 4A2 expression, although also male-specific, was not suppressed by continuous growth hormone treatment, but was regulated by pathways that, in part, involve testosterone as a positive regulator. The male-specific expression of liver and kidney P450 4A2 is thus under the control of distinct pituitary-dependent hormones acting in a tissue-specific manner."
https://openalex.org/W1528838750,"The effects of L-carnitine on myocardial glycolysis, glucose oxidation, and palmitate oxidation were determined in isolated working rat hearts. Hearts were perfused under aerobic conditions with perfusate containing either 11 mM [2-3H/U-14C]glucose in the presence or absence of 1.2 mM palmitate or 11 mM glucose and 1.2 mM [1-14C]palmitate. Myocardial carnitine levels were elevated by perfusing hearts with 10 mM L-carnitine. A 60-min perfusion period resulted in significant increases in total myocardial carnitine from 4376 +/- 211 to 9496 +/- 473 nmol/g dry weight. Glycolysis (measured as 3H2O production) was unchanged in carnitine-treated hearts perfused in the absence of fatty acids (4418 +/- 300 versus 4547 +/- 600 nmol glucose/g dry weight.min). If 1.2 mM palmitate was present in the perfusate, glycolysis decreased almost 2-fold compared with hearts perfused in the absence of fatty acids. In carnitine-treated hearts this drop in glycolysis did not occur (glycolytic rates were 2911 +/- 231 to 4629 +/- 460 nmol glucose/g dry weight.min, in control and carnitine-treated hearts, respectively. Compared with control hearts, glucose oxidation rates (measured as 14CO2 production from [U-14C]glucose) were unaltered in carnitine-treated hearts perfused in the absence of fatty acids (1819 +/- 169 versus 2026 +/- 171 nmol glucose/g dry weight.min, respectively). In the presence of 1.2 mM palmitate, glucose oxidation decreased dramatically in control hearts (11-fold). In carnitine-treated hearts, however, glucose oxidation was significantly greater than control hearts under these conditions (158 +/- 21 to 454 +/- 85 nmol glucose/g dry weight.min, in control and carnitine-treated hearts, respectively). Palmitate oxidation rates (measured as 14CO2 production from [1-14C]palmitate) decreased in the carnitine-treated hearts from 728 +/- 61 to 572 +/- 111 nmol palmitate/g dry weight.min. This probably occurred secondary to an increase in overall ATP production from glucose oxidation (from 5.4 to 14.5% of steady state myocardial ATP production). The results reported in this study provide direct evidence that carnitine can stimulate glucose oxidation in the intact fatty acid perfused heart. This probably occurs secondary to facilitating the intramitochondrial transfer of acetyl groups from acetyl-CoA to acetylcarnitine, thereby relieving inhibition of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex."
https://openalex.org/W1487719143,"Thyroid hormone receptors (TRs) are ligand-dependent transcription factors that bind to thyroid hormone response elements (TREs) to mediate positive and negative regulation of transcription of thyroid hormone-responsive genes. TR binding to TREs can be enhanced by interaction with a nuclear protein, triiodothyronine (T3) receptor auxiliary protein (TRAP). There are two major isoforms of thyroid hormone receptors, TR alpha-1 and TR beta-1, which are encoded on two separate genes. We studied the binding of TR alpha-1 and TR beta-1 to several TREs: the chick lysozyme TRE (F2), which is positively regulated by T3; rabbit beta-myosin heavy chain TRE, which is negatively regulated by T3; and an idealized inverted palindrome, TRElap. We demonstrate the formation of homodimers, TR alpha/TR beta dimers, and TR/TRAP heterodimers when receptor is bound to these DNA sequences. Surprisingly, we found that T3 decreased TR alpha-1 and TR beta-1 homodimer binding in a dose-dependent manner to these TREs as well as TR alpha/TR beta dimer binding to F2. In contrast, T3 did not affect TR/TRAP heterodimer binding to TREs suggesting that this heterodimer may be the stable complex occupying TREs in the presence of ligand."
https://openalex.org/W1485021232,"The coordinated action of many enzymatic activities is required at the DNA replication fork to ensure the error-free, efficient, and simultaneous synthesis of the leading and lagging strands of DNA. In order to define the essential protein-protein interactions and model the regulatory pathways that control Okazaki fragment synthesis, we have reconstituted the replication fork of Escherichia coli in vitro in a rolling circle-type DNA replication system. In this system, in the presence of the single-stranded DNA binding protein, the helicase/primase function on the lagging-strand template is provided by the primosome, and the synthesis of DNA strands is catalyzed by the DNA polymerase III holoenzyme. These reconstituted replication forks synthesize equivalent amounts of leading- and lagging-strand DNA, move at rates comparable to those measured in vivo (600-800 nucleotides/s at 30 degrees C), and can synthesize leading strands in the range of 150-500 kilobases in length. Using this system, we have studied the cycle of Okazaki fragment synthesis at the replication fork. This cycle is likely to have several well defined decision points, steps in the cycle where incorrect execution by the enzymatic machinery will result in an alteration in the product of the reaction, i.e. in the size of the Okazaki fragments. Since identification of these decision points should aid in the determination of which of the enzymes acting at the replication fork control the cycle, we have endeavored to identify those reaction parameters that, when varied, alter the size of the Okazaki fragments synthesized. Here we demonstrate that some enzymes, such as the DnaB helicase, remain associated continuously with the fork while others, such as the primase, must be recruited from solution each time synthesis of an Okazaki fragment is initiated. We also show that variation of the concentration of the ribonucleoside triphosphates and the deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates affects Okazaki fragment size, that the control mechanisms acting at the fork to control Okazaki fragment size are not fixed at the time the fork is assembled but can be varied during the lifetime of the fork, and that alteration in the rate of the leading-strand DNA polymerase cannot account for the effect of the deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates."
https://openalex.org/W1789143826,"Oxidative stress plays an important role in various types of cell injury and tumor promotion. Cells respond to oxidative stress in many ways including changes in membrane organization, ion movements, and altered gene expression, all of which contribute to the subsequent fate of affected cells. In this study, we investigated the expression of the proto-oncogenes c-fos, c-myc, and c-jun, which play a key role in proliferation and differentiation, using primary cultures of rat proximal tubular epithelium exposed to oxidative stress generated by the xanthine/xanthine oxidase system. This system generates superoxide and H2O2 in the extracellular space stimulating the release of active oxygen species from inflammatory cells. c-fos mRNA was expressed within 15 min, peaked at 30 min, and returned to constitutive levels by 3 h. c-jun mRNA began to rise after 30 min, peaked at 120 min, and remained above the constitutive levels up to 180 min. c-myc mRNA expression was less affected by the treatment, with levels increasing gradually over the 180 min period. The expression of c-fos was inhibited by superoxide dismutase but not by catalase and was super-induced by cycloheximide. H2O2 alone did not induce any c-fos mRNA in this system. Chelation of extracellular ionized calcium by EGTA or of intracellular ionized calcium by Quin 2/AM resulted in a marked decrease of c-fos expression. Two protein kinase C inhibitors, H-7 and staurosporine, partly diminished the expression of c-fos, whereas a third, 2-aminopurine, which has a broader spectrum of inhibiting protein kinases, almost completely abolished it. A poly ADP-ribosylation inhibitor, 3-aminobenzamide, had no effect on c-fos expression in this system. Our results show that oxidative stress provokes sequential expression of c-fos, c-jun, and c-myc, mRNA in this order. This c-fos expression appears to be largely controlled by calcium ion movement, which could include protein kinase C activation. Another protein kinase or kinases also appear to play an important role.—Maki, A.; Berezesky, I. K.; Fargnoli, J.; Holbrook, N. J.; Trump, B. F.

https://openalex.org/W1484764833,"Complementary DNAs encoding seven different proteins related to the rabbit intestinal Na+/glucose cotransporter, SGLT1, were isolated from a rabbit renal cDNA library at relatively high stringency. The messages for RK-B to RK-F were single mRNA species at 2.3 kilobases (kb) in heart and kidney. The message for RK-A was 4 kb and was found in brain, lung, intestine, liver, and kidney. RK-I mRNA was approximately 3 kb and was found in all tissues tested. The most abundant clone, RK-C, constituted nucleotides 66-2150 of the sodium-nucleoside cotransporter, SNST1. The 672-amino acid protein encoded by SNST1 is 61% identical and 80% similar in sequence to SGLT1. Expression of SNST1c in Xenopus oocytes resulted in nucleoside-stimulated 22Na uptake and sodium-dependent [3H]uridine uptake. The uptake of [3H]uridine was inhibited by a range of nucleosides, including the anti-human immunodeficiency virus drug, dideoxycytidine. The results of this study show that there is a family of SGLT1-related proteins found in a wide variety of tissues and that one of these is a Na+/nucleoside cotransporter."
https://openalex.org/W1656068683,"A novel serum amyloid A protein (SAA) has been identified as a normal apolipoprotein component of non-acute high density lipoprotein. This novel SAA has been designated constitutive SAA (C-SAA) to distinguish it from phase SAA (A-SAA). C-SAA was partially sequenced, and immunochemical analyses indicated that it constitutes a distinct subclass of apolipoproteins within the SAA superfamily. A C-SAA cDNA clone was isolated from a human liver library and sequenced. The clone predicts a pre-C-SAA molecule of 130 residues from which an 18-residue leader peptide is cleaved. The 112-residue mature molecule is 8 residues longer than human A-SAA; the size difference is due to the presence of an octapeptide between positions 70 and 77 that is not found in the corresponding region of human A-SAA. Paradoxically, octapeptides of similar composition are found at similar positions in the A-SAAs of a number of other species. The C-SAA octapeptide specifies the first two residues of a NSS tripeptide, the only potential N-linked glycosylation site in the molecule. Studies indicate that approximately 50% of these sites are glycosylated, thereby giving rise to two size classes, 14 and 19 kDa, of C-SAA in vivo. Human acute liver contains little C-SAA mRNA relative to the levels of A-SAA mRNA, and the treatment of PLC/PRF/5 hepatoma cells with monocyte-conditioned medium does not induce C-SAA mRNA concentrations to detectable levels, in contrast to the massive induction of A-SAA mRNA observed. C-SAA is therefore not a major acute reactant."
https://openalex.org/W1536715193,"Osteogenin and related bone morphogenetic proteins are members of the transforming growth factor-beta superfamily, and were isolated by their ability to induce cartilage and bone formation in vivo. The influence of osteogenin, purified from bovine bone, and of recombinant human bone morphogenetic protein-2B (BMP-2B) has been examined in bovine articular cartilage explants. Both differentiation factors stimulated in a dose-dependent manner the synthesis of proteoglycans and decreased their rate of degradation. At a dose of 30 ng/ml, proteoglycan synthesis was increased to levels observed with either 20 ng/ml insulin-like growth factor I, 10 ng/ml transforming growth factor-beta, or 20% fetal bovine serum. This increase of biosynthetic rates above basal medium levels was observed in young, adolescent, and adult tissues. Analysis of the size of the newly synthesized proteoglycans, the glycosaminoglycan chain size, and the glycosaminoglycan type of explants treated with osteogenin or BMP-2B were very comparable to each other, and to proteoglycans isolated from cartilage treated with either insulin-like growth factor I or fetal bovine serum. These results demonstrate that osteogenin and BMP-2B alone are capable of stimulating and maintaining the chondrocyte phenotype in vitro."
https://openalex.org/W1606305740,"p21ras and several other ras-related GTP-binding proteins are modified post-translationally by addition of 15-carbon farnesyl or 20-carbon geranylgeranyl isoprenoids to cysteines within a conserved carboxyl-terminal sequence motif, Caa(M/S/L), where a is an aliphatic amino acid. Proteins ending with M or S are substrates for farnesyltransferase, whereas those ending with L are modified preferentially by geranylgeranyltransferase. We recently reported that GTP-binding proteins encoded by rab1B (GGCC), rab2 (GGCC), and rab5 (CCSN) are modified by 20-carbon isoprenyl derivatives of [3H]mevalonate when translated in vitro, despite having carboxyl-terminal sequences distinct from the Caa(M/S/L) motif. We now show that these proteins function as specific acceptors for geranylgeranyl in vitro and are modified by 20-carbon isoprenyl groups in COS cells metabolically labeled with [3H]mevalonate. Proteins encoded by rab4 and rab6, with yet another distinct carboxyl-terminal motif (xCxC), are similarly modified by 20-carbon isoprenoids in vitro and in vivo. The geranylgeranyl modification of rab5 protein (CCSN) is catalyzed by an enzyme in brain cytosol but not by a purified geranylgeranyltransferase that modifies GTP-binding proteins with the CaaL motif. Unlike the prenylation of proteins with Caa(M/S/L) termini, the prenylation of rab5 protein is not inhibited by a synthetic peptide based on its carboxyl-terminal sequence (TRNQCCSN). When cellular isoprenoid synthesis is blocked by treatment of cells with lovastatin, rab proteins that are normally localized in membranes of the endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi apparatus, and endosomes accumulate in the cytosol. This change in rab protein localization is reversed by providing cells with mevalonate. These findings suggest that geranylgeranyl modification underlies the ability of rab GTP-binding proteins to associate with intracellular membranes, where they are postulated to function as mediators of vesicular traffic."
https://openalex.org/W1946744678,"Rat liver and canine pancreas rough endoplasmic reticulum-derived vesicles, which were sealed and of the same topographical orientation as in vivo, were used in a system in vitro to demonstrate translocation of ATP into their lumen. Translocation of ATP is saturable (apparent Km: 3-4 microM and Vmax: 3-7 pmol/min/mg of protein) and protein mediated because treatment of intact vesicles with Pronase, N-ethylmaleimide, or 4,4‘-diisothiocyanostilbene-2,2‘-disulfonic acid inhibit transport. The entire ATP molecule is being translocated; this was shown by high performance liquid chromatography analysis and the use of a nonhydrolyzable analog. Control experiments rule out that translocation of ATP attributed to rough endoplasmic reticulum-derived vesicles is due to contamination by mitochondria and Golgi vesicles. Following translocation of ATP into the lumen of the vesicles, binding to luminal proteins including BiP (immunoglobulin heavy chain-binding protein-glucose-regulated protein 78) and glucose-regulated protein 94 was observed. This binding appeared to be specific because similar experiments with GTP were negative. These studies strongly suggest that translocation of ATP into the rough endoplasmic reticulum lumen may serve as a mechanism for making ATP available in proposed energy requiring reactions within the lumen."
https://openalex.org/W1528445591,"Tissue factor (TF) is an integral membrane glycoprotein that serves as a cellular receptor and cofactor for the activation of the plasma protease factor VII. TF activity in both monocytes and endothelial cells is regulated by various cytokines and mitogens, including the protein kinase C (PKC) activator phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA). Three TF constructs (full-length human, a cytoplasmic domain deletion mutant, and a human-rat TF chimera), expressed in a human kidney cell line, were used to examine the in vivo phosphorylation state of TF after PMA treatment. The cytoplasmic domains of both rat and human TF were rapidly phosphorylated after cells were treated with 10-100 nM PMA. This response was completely abolished by preincubating cells with staurosporine, the potent PKC inhibitor, prior to PMA treatment. Localization of the phosphorylation site(s) to the cytoplasmic domain was demonstrated using a deletion mutant of TF and by CNBr digestion at the single methionine residue (Met-210) in the TF sequence. The rat TF cytoplasmic domain was phosphorylated to a higher specific activity than the human TF cytoplasmic domain. Phosphoamino acid analysis of the chimeric TF revealed both phosphothreonine and phosphoserine, whereas human TF contained only phosphoserine. Thus both potential phosphoacceptor sites are phosphorylated in the rat TF cytoplasmic domain. Alignment of TF cDNA sequences of mouse, rat, rabbit, and man revealed that the phosphoacceptor site (X-S*/T*-P-X, where asterisk indicates the phosphorylated residue) in the cytoplasmic domain has been conserved through evolution."
https://openalex.org/W1502535471,"The product of the cynT gene of the cyn operon in Escherichia coli has been identified as a carbonic anhydrase. The cyn operon also includes the gene cynS, encoding the enzyme cyanase. Cyanase catalyzes the reaction of cyanate with bicarbonate to give ammonia and carbon dioxide. The carbonic anhydrase was isolated from an Escherichia coli strain overexpressing the cynT gene and characterized. The purified enzyme was shown to contain 1 Zn2+/subunit (24 kDa) and was found to behave as an oligomer in solution; the presence of bicarbonate resulted in partial dissociation of the oligomeric enzyme. The kinetic properties of the enzyme are similar to those of carbonic anhydrases from other species, including inhibition by sulfonamides and cyanate. The amino acid sequence shows a high degree of identity with the sequences of two plant carbonic anhydrases. but not with animal and algal carbonic anhydrases. Since carbon dioxide formed in the bicarbonate-dependent decomposition of cyanate diffuses out of the cell faster than it would be hydrated to bicarbonate, the apparent function of the induced carbonic anhydrase is to catalyze hydration of carbon dioxide and thus prevent depletion of cellular bicarbonate."
https://openalex.org/W1605532464,"Growth hormone (GH) differentially regulates the expression of several male-specific and female-specific liver cytochrome P450 mRNAs as a function of its sex-dependent ultradian secretory pattern. Pulsatile GH release stimulates expression of the male-specific P450 2C11, while a continuous GH secretion pattern suppresses expression of 2C11 and stimulates the expression of the female-specific P450 2C12. To help define the level at which GH regulates the expression of 2C11 and 2C12 mRNA, liver nuclear RNA samples isolated from rats differing in GH status were analyzed for 2C11 and 2C12 hnRNAs by hybridization to 2C11 and 2C12 gene-specific exonic oligonucleotide probes, as well as exon/intron junction probes. The 2C11 and 2C12 hnRNAs were found to be responsive to circulating GH profiles in a manner indistinguishable from the corresponding mature, cytoplasmic mRNAs, with no 2C12 mRNA precursors found in untreated male or hypophysectomized female liver nuclei, and no 2C11 mRNA precursors in untreated female or hypophysectomized male liver nuclei. Thus, transport of 2C11 and 2C12 RNA to the cytoplasm and cytoplasmic mRNA stability are unlikely to be important GH-regulated control points for sex-specific P450 RNA expression. Run-on transcription analysis further established that GH regulates the sex-specific expression of the 2C11 and 2C12 genes at the level of transcript initiation. Transcription was also shown to be the major step for regulation of the male-specific P450 2A2 RNA, whose expression, unlike 2C11, is not obligatorily dependent on pulsatile GH release. In vitro footprinting analysis of 2C11 and 2C12 promoter fragments incubated with liver nuclear proteins isolated from rats differing in GH status revealed several sex- and GH-dependent differences in DNase cleavage patterns (hypersensitivity sites), demonstrating that GH can regulate specific protein-DNA interactions in the 5'-flanking sequences of these two genes. In vitro transcription assays driven by 2C11 and 2C12 5'-flanking DNA sequences fused to TATAA box-G-less cassette template constructs did not, however, faithfully mimic the sex-specific transcription of the 2C11 and 2C12 genes, indicating that additional cis-elements or trans-acting factors may be required to achieve the transcriptional regulation of these genes that occurs in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W1504466755,"Sodium oleate is able to activate soluble protein kinase C (Murakami, K., Chan, S. Y., and Routtenberg, A. (1986) J. Biol. Chem. 261, 15424-15429) but is unable to activate membrane-bound enzyme (El Touny, S., Khan, W., and Hannun, Y. (1990) J. Biol. Chem. 265, 16437-16443). Because physiologic interactions of fatty acids with protein kinase C occur in the presence of membranes, the following studies were conducted to evaluate the effects of surfaces (detergent micelles or platelet membranes) on the activation of protein kinase C by oleate. At concentrations at or above the critical micellar concentration (CMC) of Triton X-100, oleate was present primarily in Triton X-100/oleate-mixed micelles, as determined by gel permeation chromatography and equilibrium dialysis binding studies. At concentrations slightly below the CMC for Triton X-100, the presence of oleate caused the formation of a limited number of mixed micelles. Studies of the dose-dependent activation of purified platelet protein kinase C by sodium oleate in the presence of different concentrations of Triton X-100 indicated that only unbound oleate was able to activate protein kinase C. Platelet protein kinase C was resolved into two major isoenzymes (types II (beta) and III (alpha)) which displayed nearly identical interaction with oleate. Activation of protein kinase C by oleate in a physiologic setting employing platelet substrates and endogenous platelet protein kinase C was investigated. Oleate potently activated protein kinase C in the cytosolic compartment. In platelet homogenates as well as in a reconstituted platelet cytosol and membrane system, the dose dependence of protein kinase C on oleate showed a significant shift to the right. Approximately 30% of oleate was associated with platelet cytosol and 70% was associated with platelet membranes. Partitioning of oleate into the two platelet compartments showed little change with pH, temperature, or duration of incubation. When corrected for free oleate concentration, activation of protein kinase C by oleate showed identical dose dependence in cytosol and homogenate. Arachidonate, a potential physiologic activator of protein kinase C, showed similar behavior as oleate although only 30% of arachidonate partitioned into platelet membranes with the majority of arachidonate (70%) remaining in the cytosolic fraction.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"
https://openalex.org/W1535214827,"HepG2 cells were employed as model system to investigate potential relationships between early protein processing and Ca2+ storage by the endoplasmic reticulum. Ca2+ was required for glycoprotein processing and export by intact cells. The processing and export of alpha 1-antitrypsin and the secretion of complement factor 3, which are glycosylated proteins, were inhibited by the Ca2+ ionophore ionomycin whereas the export of albumin, a non-glycoprotein, was little affected. Ionomycin blocked processing of alpha 1-antitrypsin at the conversion from the high mannose to the complex glycosylated form without affecting ATP or GTP contents. Pre-existing inhibition of intracellular processing of alpha 1-antitrypsin by ionomycin was fully reversible upon removal of the ionophore with fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin. This reversal required Ca2+. After reversal the arrested form of alpha 1-antitrypsin was fully converted to the mature form and exported to the medium. Inhibitions of alpha 1-antitrypsin processing and complement factor 3 secretion by the metalloendoprotease antagonist Cbz-Gly-Phe-NH2 (where Cbz is benzyloxycarbonyl) were strongest at low extracellular Ca2+ but were reduced or prevented by high extracellular Ca2+. Processing and secretion of alpha 1-antitrypsin were reduced upon incubation in low Ca2+ medium. Exposure to dithiothreitol reduced albumin export while affecting alpha 1-antitrypsin export minimally. Suppression of amino acid incorporation into total cellular proteins of HepG2 cells accompanied inhibitions of protein processing by agents depleting sequestered Ca2+ stores or by dithiothreitol. Putative control of rates of translational initiation by the endoplasmic reticulum through linkage to rates of early protein processing is discussed."

This bifunctional protein contains peptidylglycine alpha-hydroxylating monooxygenase (PHM) and peptidyl-alpha-hydroxyglycine alpha-amidating lyase (PAL) catalytic domains necessary for the two-step formation of alpha-amidated peptides from their peptidylglycine precursors. In addition to the four forms of PAM mRNA identified previously, three novel forms of PAM mRNA were identified by examining anterior and neurointermediate pituitary cDNA libraries. None of the PAM cDNAs found in pituitary cDNA libraries contained exon A, the 315-nucleotide (nt) segment situated between the PHM and PAL domains and present in rPAM-1 but absent from rPAM-2. Although mRNAs of the rPAM-3a and -3b type encode bifunctional PAM precursors, the proteins differ significantly. rPAM-3b lacks a 54-nt segment encoding an 18-amino acid peptide predicted to occur in the cytoplasmic domain of this integral membrane protein; rPAM-3a lacks a 204-nt segment including the transmembrane domain and encodes a soluble protein. rPAM-5 is identical to rPAM-1 through nt 1217 in the PHM domain; alternative splicing generates a novel 3‘-region encoding a COOH-terminal pentapeptide followed by 1.1 kb of 3‘-untranslated region. The soluble rPAM-5 protein lacks PAL, transmembrane, and cytoplasmic domains. These three forms of PAM mRNA can be generated by alternative splicing. The major forms of PAM mRNA in both lobes of the pituitary are rPAM-3b and rPAM-2. Despite the fact that anterior and neurointermediate pituitary contain a similar distribution of forms of PAM mRNA, the distribution of PAM proteins in the two lobes of the pituitary is quite different. Although integral membrane proteins similar to rPAM-2 and rPAM-3b are major components of anterior pituitary granules, the PAM proteins in the neurointermediate lobe have undergone more extensive endoproteolytic processing, and a 75-kDa protein containing both PHM and PAL domains predominates. The bifunctional PAM precursor undergoes tissue-specific endoproteolytic cleavage reminiscent of the processing of prohormones."
https://openalex.org/W1506964027,"We have used an antiserum raised against a purified heparan sulfate proteoglycan (HSPG) preparation isolated from rat liver to screen a lambda gt11 expression library and have obtained overlapping cDNA clones that contain the full-length coding sequence of an HSPG core protein capable of spanning the plasma membrane. The open reading frame of the rat cDNA encodes a protein of 211 amino acids. The predicted protein sequence (23 kDa) has a high degree of homology with the published partial sequence of the human lung fibroblast HSPG, fibroglycan. The deduced protein sequence contains a 24-amino acid transmembrane domain and a 33-amino acid cytoplasmic domain, both of which are identical with the corresponding regions of human fibroglycan and are highly homologous to the human, hamster, and mouse epithelial HSPG, syndecan. The putative ectodomain, which has 85% homology to fibroglycan, contains three possible glycosaminoglycan attachment sites that may be occupied by heparan sulfate chains. The major 49-kDa core protein in the liver HSPG preparation was found to be reactive to an antibody that specifically recognizes the cytoplasmic domain of fibroglycan. We have used the full-length cDNA clone to analyze the expression of this transmembrane core protein gene in whole tissues and several epithelial and fibroblastoid cell lines. It hybridizes to three mRNA species in all cell and tissue types examined, but in liver, isolated hepatocytes, and kidney, an additional 0.8-kilobase mRNA was detected. The three common messages arise from differential use of alternative polyadenylation sites, whereas the fourth tissue-restricted RNA species represents a related gene transcript. The rat equivalent of human fibroglycan therefore appears to be the major transmembrane proteoglycan in liver, and its widespread expression in many diverse tissues and cells suggests that it plays an important role in cellular interactions."
https://openalex.org/W1581536325,"Triglyceride turnover in reperfused/ischemic rat hearts was investigated. Hearts were initially perfused under aerobic conditions for a 1-h pulse perfusion with 1.2 mM [1-14C]palmitate to label the endogenous lipid pools, followed by a 30-min period of no-flow ischemia or a 10-min period of retrograde perfusion (control). Hearts were then reperfused under aerobic conditions with buffer containing 1.2 mM [9,10-3H]palmitate. All buffers contained 11 mM glucose and 500 microunits/ml insulin. Rates of endogenous triglyceride lipolysis and synthesis were measured during reperfusion, whereas rates of exogenous palmitate oxidation were measured both prior to ischemia and during reperfusion following ischemia. During reperfusion of ischemic hearts, a 20% increase in exogenous fatty acid oxidation rates was seen compared with pre-ischemic rates. Despite an initial burst of endogenous fatty acid oxidation, no acceleration of steady state endogenous triglyceride lipolysis was seen compared with their nonischemic hearts. In contrast, a significant increase in triglyceride synthesis was observed. Triglyceride turnover was also measured in a series of hearts reperfused following ischemia in the absence of exogenous fatty acids. A significant enhancement of functional recovery was seen compared with hearts reperfused with 1.2 mM palmitate. In addition, a significant increase in fatty acid oxidation from endogenous triglyceride lipolysis was observed. We conclude that the heart quickly recovers its ability to oxidize exogenous fatty acids during reperfusion and that although triglyceride lipolysis is not accelerated during reperfusion of ischemic hearts in the presence of 1.2 mM palmitate, a significant increase in triglyceride synthesis does occur."
https://openalex.org/W1604352043,"High and low molecular weight kininogens (HK and LK) are able to bind to platelets to inhibit thrombin binding to and activation of platelets. The heavy chain domain on the kininogens that contains these functions has been determined. Domain 3 (D3) but not domains 1 or 2, completely inhibited 125I-HK binding to platelets (Ki = 24 +/- 7 nM, n = 4). 125I-D3 specifically bound to unstimulated platelets and human umbilical vein endothelial cells. On platelets, it was blocked by unlabeled D3 and HK but not prekallikrein, factor XII, C1s, or C1 inhibitor. Further, one monoclonal antibody (HKH13) directed to kininogens' D3 blocked 125I-HK and 125I-D3 binding to platelets. The binding of 125I-D3 to platelets was fully reversible by addition of 35 molar excess of unlabeled D3. D3 binding to platelets was saturable with an apparent Kd of 39 +/- 8 nM (n = 4) and 1227 +/- 404 binding sites/platelet. D3, like HK and LK, inhibited thrombin-induced platelet activation by preventing thrombin binding to platelets. Another monoclonal antibody (HKH12), directed to D3, which did not block HK binding to platelets, reduced HK's ability to inhibit 125I-alpha-thrombin binding. This result suggests that the region on D3 that inhibits 125I-alpha-thrombin binding to platelets is different from that which directly binds to platelets. These studies indicate that D3 of the kininogens contains both a binding region for platelets and endothelial cells and another region that inhibits thrombin-induced platelet activation."
https://openalex.org/W1602614663,"When isolated human fibroblast lysosomes are incubated with 4 microM [32P]phosphate at pH 7.0, orthophosphate is transported into lysosomes and is rapidly incorporated into low and high molecular weight products. We have characterized the high molecular weight (HMW) lysosomal material into which [32P]phosphate is incorporated and have found it to consist of long chains of inorganic polyphosphate based on the following observations. 1) greater than 97% of HMW 32P-lysosomal material is converted to [32P]orthophosphate when incubated with 1 N HCl for 20 min at 100 degrees C. 2) Incubation of HMW 32P-lysosomal material at pH 7.0 and 65 degrees C for 96 h results in the formation of [32P]trimetaphosphate, which is known to be produced only from linear chains of polyphosphate under these conditions. 3) HMW 32P-lysosomal material is resistant to degradation by proteinase K, ribonuclease, and deoxyribonuclease and extracts into the aqueous phase during phenol/chloroform extractions. 4) HMW 32P-lysosomal material displays heterogeneous mobility on polyacrylamide gels with most chains ranging in length from 100 to at least 600 phosphate residues. 5) HMW 32P-lysosomal material is partially hydrolyzed under alkaline conditions to yield a continuous ladder of polyphosphate species differing by one or several residues in length on polyacrylamide gels."
https://openalex.org/W1479833274,"Abstract We determined the role of specific thrombin exosites in the mechanism of inhibition by the plasma serine proteinase inhibitors heparin cofactor II (HC) and antithrombin (AT) in the absence and presence of a glycosaminoglycan by comparing the inhibition of alpha-thrombin to epsilon- and gamma T-thrombin (produced by partial proteolysis of alpha-thrombin by elastase and trypsin, respectively). All of the thrombin derivatives were inhibited in a similar manner by AT, either in the absence or presence of heparin, which confirmed the integrity of both heparin binding abilities and serpin reactivities of epsilon- and gamma T-thrombin compared to alpha-thrombin. Antithrombin activities of HC in the absence of a glycosaminoglycan with alpha-, epsilon, and gamma T-thrombin were similar with rate constants of 3.5, 2.4, and 1.2 x 10(4) M-1 min-1, respectively. Interestingly, in the presence of glycosaminoglycans the maximal inhibition rate constants by HC with heparin and dermatan sulfate, respectively, were as follows: 30.0 x 10(7) and 60.5 x 10(7) for alpha-thrombin, 14.6 x 10(7) and 24.3 x 10(7) for epsilon-thrombin, and 0.017 x 10(7) and 0.034 x 10(7) M-1 min-1 for gamma T-thrombin. A hirudin carboxyl-terminal peptide, which binds to anion-binding exosite-I of alpha-thrombin, dramatically reduced alpha-thrombin inhibition by HC in the presence of heparin but not in its absence. We analyzed our results in relation to the recently determined x-ray structure of D-Phe-Pro-Arg-chloromethyl ketone-alpha-thrombin (Bode, W., Mayr, I., Baumann, U., Huber, R., Stone, S. R., and Hofsteenge, J. (1989) EMBO J. 8, 3467-3475). Our results suggest that the beta-loop region of anion-binding exosite-I in alpha-thrombin, which is not present in gamma T-thrombin, is essential for the rapid inhibition reaction by HC in the presence of a glycosaminoglycan. Therefore, alpha-thrombin and its derivatives would be recognized and inhibited differently by HC and AT in the presence of a glycosaminoglycan."
https://openalex.org/W1527849891,"The different regioisomers of epoxyeicosatrienoic acids derived from cytochrome P-450 monooxygenase are readily esterified into phospholipids of mastocytoma cells. Incorporation of 14,15-epoxyeicosatrienoic acid was concentration-dependent, with Km = 1.1 microM and Vmax = 36 pmol/min/10(7) cells. Half-maximal incorporation occurred in 30 min, reaching a steady-state concentration of 470 pmol/10(6) cells. This was slightly lower than the values for arachidonic acid (665 pmol/10(6) cells) or 5-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (554 pmol/10(6) cells). The distribution of 14,15-epoxyeicosatrienoic acid was preferential in the order phosphatidylethanolamine greater than phosphatidylcholine greater than phosphatidylinositol greater than phosphatidyl serine much greater than neutral lipids plus fatty acids. This contrasted with 5(S)-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid, which was distributed primarily into phosphatidylcholine. Fast atom bombardment/tandem mass spectrometry facilitated identification of molecular species containing epoxyeicosatrienoic acids without relying on radioisotopes. Phosphatidylethanolamine plasmalogens with 16:1 or 18:2 at the sn-1 position, or an 18:0 acyl group, and phosphatidylcholine with 16:0 alkyl ether or an acyl group at the sn-1 position incorporated all possible epoxyeicosatrienoic acid regioisomers. Under basal conditions, cells eliminated 14,15-cis-epoxyeicosatrienoic acid slowly with a half-life of 34.9 +/- 7 h. Cells stimulated with calcium ionophore A23187 eliminated 14,15-epoxyeicosatrienoic acid rapidly. It was notable that its rate of release from phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylinositol exceeded that for arachidonic acid. A coenzyme A-independent transacylase also catalyzed the transfer of epoxyeicosatrienoic acids from mastocytoma cell membranes into 1-palmitoyl-2-lysophosphatidylcholine. The cellular incorporation, release, and distribution of epoxyeicosatrienoic acids is distinctive and contrasts with most other eicosanoids, suggesting that these compounds may have both autocoid and nonautocoid functions."
https://openalex.org/W1480714695,"A series of Azotobacter vinelandii strains have been constructed in which the nitrogenase Fe-protein (Av2) was altered by substitutions for Arg-100. This invariant residue is a likely partner in a salt bridge with the MoFe-protein and, in some species, is the site of reversible regulation by ADP-ribosylation (Pope, M. R., Murrell, S. A., and Ludden, P. W. (1985) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 82, 3173-3177). Although we find that arginine is the optimum amino acid, other residues in this position could support diazotrophic growth. These results were surprising because Klebsiella pneumoniae Fe-protein substituted by His-100 had been reported to be inactive (Lowery, R. G., Chang, C. L., Davis, L. C., McKenna, M.-C., Stevens, P. J., and Ludden, P. W. (1989) Biochemistry 28, 1206-1212). Two altered Fe-proteins (Av2-R100Y, the tyrosyl form, and Av2-R100H, the histidyl form) were isolated and, in contrast to this earlier report, we found that both had some activity in acetylene reduction. However, both altered proteins exhibited a decreased maximum velocity (35 and 3% of wild type, respectively) and were strongly inhibited by excess MoFe-protein. These adverse activity parameters were also manifest in the increased sensitivity of the altered proteins to inhibition by salts. Indeed, the salt sensitivity of Av2-R100H is so significant that its activity is masked in the normal assay and is easily missed. In addition, for Av2-R100H, substrate reduction is substantially uncoupled from MgATP hydrolysis. These results suggest that substitutions for Arg-100 may decrease the affinity of the Fe-protein for the MoFe-protein prior to electron transfer but increase affinity after electron transfer. Hence, the role of Arg-100 may be to provide the optimum balance in stabilities of these two complexes for maximum efficiency in substrate reduction."
https://openalex.org/W1565361955,"Acylpeptide hydrolase may be involved in N-terminal deacetylation of nascent polypeptide chains and of bioactive peptides. The activity of this enzyme from human erythrocytes is sensitive to anions such as chloride, nitrate, and fluoride. Furthermore, blocked amino acids act as competitive inhibitors of the enzyme. Acetyl leucine chloromethyl ketone has been employed to identify one active site residue as His-707. Diisopropylfluorophosphate has been used to identify a second active site residue as Ser-587. Chemical modification studies with a water-soluble carbodiimide implicate a carboxyl group in catalytic activity. These results and the sequence around these active site residues, especially near Ser-587, suggest that acylpeptide hydrolase contains a catalytic triad. The presence of a cysteine residue in the vicinity of the active site is suggested by the inactivation of the enzyme by sulfhydryl-modifying agents and also by a low amount of modification by the peptide chloromethyl ketone inhibitor. Ebelactone A, an inhibitor of the formyl aminopeptidase, the bacterial counterpart of eukaryotic acylpeptide hydrolase, was found to be an effective inhibitor of this enzyme. These findings suggest that acylpeptidase hydrolase is a member of a family of enzymes with extremely diverse functions."
https://openalex.org/W1588446024,"Abstract Chitinase isolated from Zea mays seeds is inactivated by 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide (EDC) in the absence of exogenous nucleophiles. Oligomers of N-acetylglucosamine,N,N',N,N'-tetra-N-acetylchitotetraose (GlcNAc4), and to a lesser extent, N,N',N-tri-N-acetylchitotriose (GlcNAc3) and N,N'-di-N-acetylchitobiose (GlcNAc2) provide partial protection against inactivation by the reagent. An examination of the concentration dependence of the protection afforded by GlcNAc4 revealed direct competition between the substrate analog and the reagent for the same binding sites on the enzyme. Isolation and Edman degradation of a new tryptic fragment, observed after inactivation of chitinase with EDC, revealed the sequence G-P-L-Q-I-S-W-N-*-N-Y-G-P-A-G-R, where the asterisk represents a cycle in which no amino acid was detected, presumably as a consequence of derivatization with EDC. In basic chitinases from dicotyledonous plants such as Arabidopsis thaliana, Phaseolis vulgaris (bean), Nicotiana tabacum (tobacco), and Solanum tuberosum (potato), as well as in the chitinase isolated from the monocotyledonous plant Hordeum vulgare (barley), this position is invariably occupied by a tyrosine. However, in the Oryza sativa (rice) basic chitinase, this position is occupied by a phenylalanine. The following additional evidence supports identification of this residue as tyrosine in Z. mays chitinase. (a) Inactivation of chitinase with EDC is reversible by treatment with hydroxylamine. (b) Liquid secondary ion mass spectrometric analysis of the isolated derivatized peptide revealed the presence of a molecular ion with a mass to charge ratio consistent with the peptide containing a derivatized tyrosine residue. These results provide evidence for an essential tyrosine residue at or near the catalytic site of chitinase that is selectively modified during inactivation with EDC."

Transformed Escherichia coli cells expressed Endo F1 activity very well, but the enzyme apparently was not processed and secreted into the medium as it normally is in Flavobacterium meningosepticum. DNA sequencing revealed an open reading frame of 1,017 nucleotides encoding a putative 50-amino acid signal sequence, and a mature protein (31,667 Da) of 289 amino acids. The deduced amino acid sequence was verified by direct Edman microsequencing of 88% of the purified protein as tryptic and V8 protease peptides. Alignment of Endo F1 (289 amino acids) with the established amino acid sequence of Streptomyces plicatus Endo H (271 amino acids) revealed a 32% structural identity over the entire sequence and a high degree of conservative replacements. Potential catalytic domains identified in other proteins that hydrolyze the beta 1,4 glycosidic linkage between N-acetylglucosamine residues are also conserved for amino acid identity and relative spacing in Endo F1."

Synthetic oligonucleotide guessmers, based on microsequenced tryptic peptides of Pfs40 purified by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, were used to clone the full length cDNA and genomic DNA encoding Pfs40. The deduced amino acid sequence predicted an integral membrane protein containing five EF-hand calcium-binding domains. The biological activity of one or more of these domains was confirmed by binding of 45Ca to both native and recombinant Pfs40. Antisera to recombinant Pfs40 immunoprecipitated the native radiolabeled 40-kDa surface protein.

https://openalex.org/W1486636993,"NGFI-A is a mammalian transcription factor that contains zinc fingers similar to those observed in several other proteins, including NGFI-C and Krox-20. To define precisely the DNA binding domain of NGFI-A, we selected mutants using a chimeric transcriptional activator that contains the NGFI-A zinc finger domain sandwiched between the lexA DNA binding domain and the GAL4 transcriptional activating domain. Expression of this lexA-NGFI-A-GAL4 (LAG) trimeric protein in yeast significantly retarded their growth, unlike an activator containing only the lexA and GAL4 components. This suggested that LAG inappropriately regulates genes in yeast that contain NGFI-A binding sites. Yeast that contained LAG reverted to wild-type growth at high frequency by inactivation of LAG. The mutations recovered from these revertants were specifically limited to the 83-residue NGFI-A zinc finger domain by requiring that the lexA and GAL4 portions of the LAG chimera remain functional. Nearly all of the 93 mutants obtained contained single missense mutations that mapped within the zinc fingers to residues thought to be important for zinc finger function. Deletion analysis of native NGFI-A verified that residues distant from the zinc fingers do not influence DNA binding, thus establishing the minimal functional DNA binding domain. Interestingly, many zinc finger residues ascribed specific functions by x-ray crystallography were never mutated in yeast, implying that the identity of these residues is not critical. Surprisingly, not all of the mutations tested significantly impaired NGFI-A-specific DNA binding, suggesting that the function of these zinc fingers is more diverse than previously recognized."
https://openalex.org/W1573159865,"Although CuZn-superoxide dismutase (CuZnSOD) has been shown to reduce oxidative damage in several systems, the quantitative relationship between the degree of protection and CuZnSOD activity has not been well investigated. Therefore, the ability of cells to tolerate superoxide toxicity was assessed as a function of endogenous CuZnSOD activity in several mouse and human cell lines with progressively higher levels of CuZnSOD activity. In five lines of fetal fibroblasts derived from SOD1-transgenic mice, with CuZnSOD activities of 1.7- to 7.1-fold the nontransgenic level and no changes in the cellular glutathione peroxidase (GSHPx) activity, a direct relationship (r = 0.97) between the LD50 to paraquat and enzyme activity was observed, suggesting that CuZnSOD activity is the single most important factor in determining the paraquat LD50. Mouse trisomy 16 fetal fibroblasts and human trisomy 21 lung fibroblasts, both expressing a 1.5-fold increase in CuZnSOD activity, were 1.5-fold more tolerant to paraquat than were their diploid counterparts. Furthermore, the protective effect of CuZnSOD at the DNA level, as shown by reduced thymine glycol generation, was demonstrated in paraquat-treated transgenic fibroblasts. A direct relationship (r = 0.78) of paraquat LD50 and CuZnSOD activity was also observed with a panel of six lines of SOD1- transfected HeLa cells with 1.6- to 7.3-fold the basal CuZnSOD activity. Moreover, there was no correlation between resistance to paraquat toxicity and the cellular GSHPx and/or catalase activity. Taken together, these results demonstrate a consistently protective effect of endogenous CuZnSOD against superoxide toxicity in both primary and transformed cell lines.—Huang, T.- T.; Carlson, E.

https://openalex.org/W1506286589,"Heterotrimeric factor VIIIa was reconstituted from isolated A2 subunit and A1/A3-C1-C2 dimer of thrombin-activated human factor VIII in a reaction that was sensitive to pH. Maximal levels of reconstituted factor VIIIa at pH 6.0 were as much as 20-fold greater than were values observed at pH 7.5. The presence of factor IXa and phospholipid resulted in a marked increase in factor VIIIa reconstituted at physiologic pH. However, the resultant factor VIIIa was unstable due to slow proteolysis of the A1 subunit. Factor IXa modified by the active site-specific reagent dansyl-glutamyl-glycyl-arginyl-chloromethyl ketone (DEGR-IXa) increased the level of factor VIIIa reconstituted from subunits to a similar extent as was observed for unmodified factor IXa and yielded stable factor VIIIa. This enhancement was saturated above a 1:1 molar ratio of DEGR-IXa to factor VIIIa subunits and could be blocked by an anti-factor IX antibody, suggesting that the DEGR-IXa-dependent increase in factor VIIIa reconstitution correlated with assembly of the factor X-ase complex. At a saturating amount of DEGR-IXa, the level of factor VIIIa reconstitution at pH 7.5 approached values obtained at pH 6.0. Fluorescence polarization measurements indicated that factor VIIIa altered binding of DEGR-IXa to phospholipid. However, neither the A2 subunit nor the A1/A3-C1-C2 dimer alone produced this effect. This result suggested that both A2 and A1/A3-C1-C2 were necessary for association of the cofactor with factor IXa. These results suggest a model in which assembly of the intrinsic factor X-ase complex stabilizes factor VIIIa through inhibition of subunit dissociation."
https://openalex.org/W1665781054,"A volatile anesthetic-gated current was characterized in patch-clamped cultured postnatal rat hippocampal neurons. In this preparation, the major volatile anesthetics, isoflurane, halothane, and enflurane, open an anion-selective conductance. This volatile anesthetic-gated current exhibits anion selectivity with a chloride-to-acetate permeability ratio of 15, shows outward rectification well described by the constant field equation, and is activated in a dose-dependent fashion with half-maximal response to isoflurane at 0.8 mM (0.032 atm). The current persists in the absence of external Ca2+ and is not blocked by strychnine, a glycine antagonist. However, the gamma-aminobutyric acidA (GABAA) antagonists, bicuculline and picrotoxinin, and the nonspecific anion channel blocker, 4,4'-diisothiocyanostilbene-2,2'-disulfonic acid (DIDS), completely block the response. These observations suggest that volatile anesthetics, like several other general anesthetics such as barbiturates, steroids, and etomidate, have a GABA-mimetic effect on vertebrate central neurons in culture. It is not clear whether this GABAA-gating property is a prerequisite for all general anesthetics. However, under normal physiological conditions of low intracellular Cl-, it is likely that drugs with both direct GABA agonist and GABA modulatory properties will produce overall depression of the central nervous system by increasing the normal inhibitory synaptic influence and by directly hyperpolarizing neurons."
https://openalex.org/W1482868950,"Abstract We have isolated a cDNA clone (RBP-2) for the protein (RBP-J kappa) which binds to immunoglobulin recombination signals with 23-base pair spacers (Matsunami, N., Hamaguchi, Y., Yamamoto, Y., Kuze, K., Kangawa, K., Matsuo, H., Kawaichi, M., and Honjo, T. (1989) Nature 342, 934-937). During further screening of a cDNA library from the same mouse pre-B cell line (38B9), we have isolated a second cDNA clone (RBP-2N) which differs from RBP-2 in its 5' sequence. RNase protection assays indicated that the RBP-2N type mRNA was produced in 10-20 times the quantity as RBP-2 mRNA. To elucidate the relationship between these two mRNAs, we analyzed the genomic organization of the RBP-J kappa gene. Southern hybridization of mouse genomic DNA detected at least 7 EcoRI fragments hybridizing to an RBP-2 cDNA probe, suggesting a complex structure for the RBP-J kappa gene. Cloning of each EcoRI fragment revealed one functional RBP-J kappa gene and three related genes. The functional gene was composed of 11 exons and spanned at least 50 kilobase pairs. The sequence of exon 1 and its 5'-flanking region contained a GC-rich promoter-like region but no apparent TATA box. The initiation site of transcription was heterogeneous, and the two types of mRNA are produced from the same exon by transcription initiation at different sites and by different usage of splice signals. Two of the three related genes were processed pseudogenes with scattered stop codons. The other was also a processed gene with a sequence exactly the same as that of RBP-2, except that this gene lacked the sequence corresponding to the first exon of the functional gene."
https://openalex.org/W1504705586,"The gene coding for the Dictyostelium discoideum lysosomal enzyme, alpha-mannosidase, has been cloned and sequenced. To accomplish this, the mature 60- and 58-kDa subunits of the enzyme were purified and subjected to liquid-phase N-terminal amino acid sequencing. Sequence information was obtained for both of the mature subunits, and a 48-mer oligonucleotide was synthesized based on the determined amino acid sequence of the 58-kDa subunit. Using this oligonucleotide as a probe, an 8-kilobase HindIII fragment of genomic DNA was isolated and subjected to Sanger dideoxy DNA sequencing. The first 4400 nucleotides contained the complete alpha-mannosidase gene and 1100 nucleotides of 5'-flanking DNA. Primer extension analysis indicated that transcription begins at multiple sites -48 to -64 nucleotides upstream of the first nucleotide of the predicted translation initiation codon. A single open reading frame (ORF) of 3015 nucleotides was found that was interrupted by a single intron and that contained the amino acid sequences of the N termini of the two mature alpha-mannosidase subunits; a polyadenylation signal was also found just downstream of the termination codon. A potential cleavable signal sequence was identified in the first 22 amino acids of the predicted precursor protein, and two propeptide regions (Pro I and II) were identified that were immediately upstream of the N termini of the 60- and 58-kDa mature subunits, respectively. These propeptide regions are not present in the mature protein and are therefore predicted to be proteolytically removed as the membrane associated 140-kDa precursor is transported to lysosomes and processed to the soluble 60- and 58-kDa mature forms of the enzyme. In fact, potential proteolytic cleavage sites were identified flanking the Pro I and Pro II regions. Pro I, which immediately follows the signal sequence, consists of 18 amino acids, most of which are highly charged and hydrophilic residues, while Pro II, found in the central portion of the precursor, is very hydrophobic. While no obvious transmembrane regions were identified, several short hydrophobic amino acid stretches were found to be localized in and around the Pro II region, and these may be responsible for attachment of precursors to membranes."
https://openalex.org/W1525394119,"We previously reported purification of two forms of DNA epsilon from calf thymus (Crute, J. J., Wahl, A. F., and Bambara, R. A. (1986) Biochemistry 25, 26-36). We have now used the polymerase photolabeling method to identify the polypeptides containing the active site in each enzyme preparation. The molecular mass of these polypeptides are 210 and 145 kDa for the polymerases now designated epsilon and epsilon*, respectively. Renaturation of activity from denaturing gel electrophoresis corroborates the trap results. Photolabeling of fractions suggests that the smaller subunit is derived by proteolysis of the larger subunit during purification. Native sedimentation coefficient measurements of polymerase-containing column fractions further suggest a precursor/product relationship between the two polymerases. Response of polymerization activity to a battery of inhibitors normally used to distinguish mammalian nuclear DNA polymerases was found to be essentially identical for polymerases epsilon, epsilon*, and the epsilon* generated in fractions initially containing epsilon. These latter results demonstrate that the loss of the protease-sensitive domain of the active site subunit does not affect catalytic function as measured in a standard DNA assay. The sole apparent functional difference observed here between the epsilon and epsilon* forms is evidence that only the full-length epsilon form can be directly photocrosslinked to dATP, independent of DNA synthesis. Photolabeling of the post-microsomal supernatant fraction from thymus glands obtained from fetal calves reveals the presence of both the epsilon and epsilon* polypeptide."

Stable transfectants of human T47D cells were generated which express recombinant rat GST-Yc from a human cytomegalovirus promoter-based expression vector. Among several GST-Yc transfectants characterized, two of them contained, respectively, 2- and 3-fold higher GST activity than parental cells or control transfectants and, respectively, 4-5- and 8-10-fold higher selenium-independent glutathione peroxidase activity. Cellular growth kinetics and rates of [3H]thymidine incorporation showed that both transfectants were more resistant to oxidative shocks mediated by cumene hydroperoxide or singlet oxygen generated by photosensitized rose bengal than were T47D cells and control transfectants. In contrast, a T47D transfectant, which expressed high levels of recombinant selenoglutathione peroxidase and showed enhanced resistance to cumene hydroperoxide (Mirault, M.-E., Tremblay, A., Beaudoin, N., and Tremblay, M. J. (1991) J. Biol. Chem. 266, 20752-20760), was as sensitive as parental cells to singlet oxygen. No difference was found in growth sensitivity to 1-h shock treatments with the quinonoid drug daunomycin, irrespective of GST-Yc or selenoglutathione peroxidase overexpression in these cells."
https://openalex.org/W1606329912,"The genes that encode fructose 1,6-bisphosphate aldolase of Drosophila melanogaster have been isolated and characterized. These genes exist in a single copy 8-kilobase pair locus in the Drosophila genome which is located at cytogenetic position 97A-B. The nucleotide sequence and transcript mapping suggest that three overlapping protein isozyme genes may be encoded at this locus. These isozyme genes all share a single promoter, a 5'-untranslated first exon, and two other protein coding exons. The isozyme-specific carboxyl-terminal amino acids are encoded by one of three alternatively utilized fourth exons: 4A, 4B, or 4C by alternative splicing. The transcript containing exon 4C, whose sequence has been reported previously, is abundant throughout development and has a developmental profile similar to other glycolytic gene transcripts; however, it shows developmental specificity in the alternative use of two polyadenylation signals which result in a 2.4-kilobase and a 1.9-kilobase transcript. The transcript containing exon 4B is 1.6 kilobases in size and is most abundant during the larval stages and during the time of eclosion. The transcript containing exon 4A is in low abundance and found only during the adult stage. Sequence comparisons of the alternative fourth exons indicate that the duplication leading to the multiple exons is quite old and preceded the origin of the genus Drosophila."
https://openalex.org/W1610468465,"Human epidermoid carcinoma A431 cells, which have an extremely large number of EGF receptors, have been used to elucidate EGF-induced biochemical reactions such as EGF receptor tyrosine kinase-mediated activation of Ca+ + influx (1, 2). In the present study, the 12-HETE biosynthesis enzyme was investigated. Our results show that the stereochemistry of 12-HETE biosynthesized in A431 cells is an “S”-enantiomer which is biosynthesized by a 12-lipoxygenase localized in the microsomal fraction. These results also indicate that EGF enhances the 12-lipoxygenase activity in A431 cells, which involves a de novo protein biosynthesis. The results found in the present report may contribute to the mechanism studies on the possible role of EGF in metastasis and growth control of tumor cells."
https://openalex.org/W1509468989,"We have previously demonstrated that the extracellular neutral metalloprotease (Npr) of Streptomyces cacaoi is synthesized as a 60-kDa preproenzyme (P60), then processed to the 35-kDa mature form (P35) (Chang, P. C., Kuo, T.-C., Tsugita, A., and Lee, Y.-H. W. (1990) Gene (Amst.) 88, 87-95). In this study, we investigated the active site and the mechanism involved in the maturation of the protease. Site-specific mutations at the putative zinc-binding ligands and active site of Npr at His202, Glu203, His206, and Glu240 led to complete abolishment of Npr activity and concomitant accumulation of a 57-kDa inactive protein (P57) which was secreted. Sequence analysis of the NH2 terminus indicated that P57 was derived from P60 after removal of the signal peptide and represented the proenzyme form of Npr (pro-Npr). Analysis of the zinc content of purified mutant P57 proteins revealed a dramatic loss of zinc atom as compared with the wild-type P35 protein. In vitro with the aid of exogenous active Npr, the mutant P57 protein could be converted to the mature inactive P35 with an identical NH2-terminal sequence and a molecular mass the same as that of the wild-type P35. From these studies, we conclude that these highly conserved residues (His202, Glu203, His206, and Glu240) are indispensable for zinc binding and protease activity, as well as processing of Npr. In addition, we have clearly demonstrated that maturation of Npr occurs extracellularly via an autocatalytic cleavage of the pro-Npr propeptide. This is the first report of such a maturation mechanism for an extracellular protease in streptomycetes which can serve as a model for further studies on the mechanism of secretion and processing of proteases from Gram-positive bacteria."
https://openalex.org/W1609698119,"Protein myristoylation was investigated in the yeast secretory pathway. Conditional secretory mutations were used to accumulate inteRmediaries in the pathway between the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi (sec 18, 20), within the Golgi (sec 7), and between the Golgi and plasma membrane (sec 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9). The accumulation of vesicles was paralleled by the enrichment of a defined subset of proteins modified either via ester or amide linkages to myristic acid: Myristoylated proteins of 21, 32, 49, 56, 75, and 136 kDa were enriched between the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi; proteins of 21, 32, 45, 56, 75, 136 kDa were enriched by blocks within the Golgi; and proteins of 18, 21, 32, 36, 49, 68, and 136 kDa were trapped in a myristoylated form by blocks between the Golgi and plasma membrane. This enrichment of myristoylated proteins was reversed upon returning the cells to the permissive temperature for secretion. The fatty acid was linked to the 21-kDa protein via a hydroxylamine-resistant amide linkage (N-myristoylation) and to the proteins of 24, 32, 49, 56, 68, 136 kDa via hydroxylamine-labile ester linkage (E-myristoylation). In addition, myristoylated proteins of 21, 56, and 136 kDa were glycosylated via amino linkages to asparagine. This suggests they are exposed to the lumen of the secretory pathway. Three proteins (24, 32, and 56) were E-myristoylated in the presence of protein synthesis inhibitors, indicating this modification can occur posttranslationally. After using cycloheximide to clear protein passengers from the secretory pathway the 21-, 32-, and 56-kDa proteins continued to accumulate in a myristoylated form when vesicular transport was blocked between the Golgi and plasma membrane. These data suggest that myristoylation occurs on a component of the secretory machinery rather than on a passenger protein."
https://openalex.org/W1536433819,"We have shown previously that 48 base pairs (bp) of 5'-flanking sequence are necessary for correct initiation at the major transcriptional start site of the Chinese hamster dihydrofolate reductase (dhfr) gene (Ciudad et al., 1988). As an upstream element, this sequence alone confers 25% of maximum promoter activity. The 5' half of this sequence is particularly well conserved among mammalian species; it contains one Sp1 binding site (GC box) and one CAA element. In the present work, we have analyzed the role of this region by extensive point mutational analysis. Twenty-three dhfr minigene constructs containing 1- or 2-base substitutions in this region of the promoter were tested by measuring their ability to transfect DHFR-deficient Chinese hamster ovary cells to a DHFR+ growth phenotype. Eight mutants, all in or near the GC box, exhibited reduced transfection efficiency. Promoter disfunction in these mutants was confirmed by RNase protection analysis of stable transfectants. Gel retardation experiments showed that mutants affected in the consensus sequence for Sp1 binding were deficient in binding a protein found in nuclear extracts of Chinese hamster ovary cells. Purified human transcription factor Sp1 was also unable to bind a promoter sequence bearing one of these single base substitutions, suggesting that Sp1 itself is involved in dhfr transcription in vivo. We conclude that most single base mutations in the GC box severely cripple or eliminate promoter function by inhibiting binding of transcription factors to this regulatory sequence and that Sp1 is likely to be involved in dhfr transcription in vivo. We also found that the well conserved CAA element is not absolutely necessary for transcription."
https://openalex.org/W1571936337,"As a first step in attempting to isolate the Na(+)-dependent System N transporter from rat liver we have investigated the use of prophase-arrested oocytes from Xenopus laevis for the functional expression of rat liver glutamine transporters. Individual oocytes, defolliculated by collagenase treatment, were injected with 50 nl of a 1 mg.ml-1 solution of poly(A)+ RNA (mRNA) isolated from rat liver. 50 microM L-[3H]glutamine uptake was measured 1-5 days post-injection: after 48 h, poly(A)+ RNA-injected oocytes showed a 60 +/- 12% increase in Na(+)-dependent glutamine uptake compared to controls. This increased uptake showed characteristic features of hepatic System N: that is, it tolerated Li(+)-for-Na+ substitution and was inhibited by the System N substrate L-histidine (5 mM) in Li medium, unlike endogenous Na(+)-dependent glutamine transport. In subsequent experiments rat liver poly(A)+ RNA, size-fractionated by density gradient fractionation, was injected into oocytes. Injection of poly(A)+ RNA of 1.9-2.8 kilobases (kb) in size resulted in a significant stimulation of Na(+)-dependent glutamine transport to 0.362 +/- 0.080 pmol.min-1/oocyte from 0.178 +/- 0.060 pmol.min-1/oocyte in vehicle-injected oocytes (p less than 0.01). A lighter fraction, with poly(A)+ RNA of less than 1.9 kilobases size resulted in a similar increase in Na(+)-dependent glutamine uptake which was largely Li(+)-tolerant: Li(+)-stimulated glutamine uptake in oocytes injected with this fraction increased to 0.230 +/- 0.070 pmol.min-1/oocyte from 0.098 +/- 0.029 pmol.min-1/oocyte in controls (p less than 0.05). This enhanced rate of Li(+)-stimulated glutamine uptake was inhibited 28 and 70%, respectively, by 1 and 5 mM L-histidine. Na(+)-independent uptake of glutamine rose by 72 +/- 12% in oocytes injected with poly(A)+ RNA of 2.8-3.6 kb (p less than 0.001). These results demonstrate that glutamine transporters, with characteristics associated with hepatic Systems N, L, and A (or ASC), can be expressed in X. laevis oocytes injected with specific size fractions of rat liver mRNA."
https://openalex.org/W1528149233,"We have investigated hypertension-associated alterations in intracellular cations in the kidney by measuring intracellular pH, free Mg2+, free Ca2+, and Na+ concentrations in perfused normotensive and hypertensive rat (8-14 weeks old) kidneys using 31P, 19F, and double quantum-filtered (DQ) 23Na NMR. The effects of both anoxia and ischemia on the 23Na DQ signal confirmed its ability to detect changes in intracellular Na+. However, there was a sizable contribution of the extracellular Na+ to the 23Na DQ signal of the kidney. The intracellular free Ca2+ concentration, measured using 19F NMR and 5,5'difluoro-1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid, also increased dramatically during ischemia; the increase could be partly reversed by reperfusion. No significant differences were found between normotensive and hypertensive kidneys in the ATP level, intracellular pH, intracellular free Mg2+, and the 23Na DQ signal or in the extent of the extracellular contribution to the 23Na DQ signal. Oxygen consumption rates were also similar for the normotensive (5.02 +/- 0.46 mumol of O2/min/g) and hypertensive (5.47 +/- 0.42 mumol O2/min/g) rat kidneys. The absence of a significant difference in intracellular pH, Na+ concentration, and oxygen consumption between normotensive and hypertensive rat kidneys suggests that an alteration in the luminal Na+/H+ antiport activity in hypertension is unlikely. However, a highly significant increase (64%, p less than 0.01) in free Ca2+ concentration was found in perfused kidneys from hypertensive rats (557 +/- 48 nM, blood pressure = 199 +/- 5 mmHg, n = 6) compared with normotensive rats (339 +/- 21 nM, blood pressure = 134 +/- 6, n = 4) indicating altered renal calcium homeostasis in essential hypertension. An increase in intracellular free Ca2+ concentration without an accompanying change in the intracellular Na+ suggests, among many possibilities, that the Ca2+/Mg(2+)-ATPase may be inhibited in the hypertensive renal tissue."
https://openalex.org/W1547343302,"ImuVert, a biologic response modifier, and interleukin 1 (IL 1) have been shown to protect the young rat from alopecia induced by cytarabine (ARA-C). In the present study the inhibition by ARA-C of DNA synthesis in hair follicles (HFs) and the protective effect of ImuVert and IL 1 were investigated in vivo and in vitro. Both ImuVert and IL 1 were equally effective in protecting rats from ARA-C-induced alopecia. DNA synthesis in HFs isolated from ARA-C-treated animals was 10–20% of untreated controls. Follicles isolated from animals given either ImuVert or IL 1 before ARA-C exhibited normal DNA synthesis. In vitro, the incubation of normal rat HF with ARA-C resulted in 80% inhibition of [3H]-thymidine uptake. Preincubation of the follicles for 1 hr with IL 1 before the addition of ARA-C completely blocked the inhibition. Preincubation with imuVert, however, was less effective in blocking the inhibition from ARA-C.—Jimenez, J. J.; Sawaya, M. E.; Yunis, A. A.

https://openalex.org/W1552789381,"In previous work (Brooker, R. J., and Wilson, T. H. (1985) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 82, 3959-3963), lactose permease mutants were isolated which possessed an enhanced recognition for maltose. In some of these mutants, the wild-type alanine residue at position 177 was changed to valine or threonine. To gain further insight into the side chain requirement at position 177 that confers maltose recognition, further substitutions of isoleucine, leucine, phenylalanine, proline, and serine have been made via site-directed mutagenesis. Permeases containing alanine or serine exhibited poor maltose recognition whereas those containing isoleucine, leucine, phenylalanine, proline, or valine showed moderate or good recognition. As far as galactosides are concerned, the Val-177, Pro-177, and Ser-177 mutants were able to transport lactose as well as, or slightly better than, the wild-type strain. The other mutants displayed moderately reduced levels of lactose transport. For example, the Phe-177 mutant, which was the most defective, showed a level of downhill transport which was approximately 20% that of the wild-type strain. In uphill transport assays, all of the position 177 mutants were markedly defective in their ability to accumulate beta-D-thiomethylgalactopyranoside against a concentration gradient. Finally, the position 177 mutants were analyzed for their ability to catalyze an H+ leak. Interestingly, even though the wild-type permease does not leak H+ across the bacterial membrane, all of the position 177 mutants were shown to transport H+ in the absence of sugars. For most of the mutants, this H+ leak was blocked by the addition of beta-D-thiodigalactoside. Overall, these results are discussed with regard to the effects of position 177 substitutions on the sugar recognition site and H+ transport."
https://openalex.org/W1522841678,"We have used synthetic peptides to study a conserved RNA binding motif in yeast poly(A)-binding protein. Two peptides, 45 and 44 amino acids in length, corresponding to amino and carboxyl halves of a 90-amino acid RNA-binding domain in the protein were synthesized. While the amino-terminal peptide had no significant affinity for nucleic acids, the carboxyl-terminal peptide-bound nucleic acids with similar characteristics to that for the entire 577 residue yeast poly(A)-binding protein. In 100 mM NaCl, the latter peptide retained over 50% of the intrinsic binding free energy of the protein, as well as, similar RNA versus DNA binding specificity. However, shuffling of the sequence of this 44 residue peptide had surprisingly little effect on its nucleic acid binding properties suggesting the overriding importance of amino acid composition as opposed to primary sequence. Deletion studies on the 44 residue peptide with the correct sequence succeeded in identifying amino acids important for conferring RNA specificity and for increasing our understanding of the molecular basis for nucleic acid binding by synthetic peptides. The shuffled peptide study, however, clearly indicates that considerable caution must be exercised before extrapolating results of structure/function studies on synthetic peptide analogues to the parent protein."
