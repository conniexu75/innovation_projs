https://openalex.org/W3205161018,"Abstract The Moon has a magmatic and thermal history that is distinct from that of the terrestrial planets 1 . Radioisotope dating of lunar samples suggests that most lunar basaltic magmatism ceased by around 2.9–2.8 billion years ago (Ga) 2,3 , although younger basalts between 3 Ga and 1 Ga have been suggested by crater-counting chronology, which has large uncertainties owing to the lack of returned samples for calibration 4,5 . Here we report a precise lead–lead age of 2,030 ± 4 million years ago for basalt clasts returned by the Chang’e-5 mission, and a 238 U/ 204 Pb ratio ( µ value) 6 of about 680 for a source that evolved through two stages of differentiation. This is the youngest crystallization age reported so far for lunar basalts by radiometric dating, extending the duration of lunar volcanism by approximately 800–900 million years. The µ value of the Chang’e-5 basalt mantle source is within the range of low-titanium and high-titanium basalts from Apollo sites ( µ value of about 300–1,000), but notably lower than those of potassium, rare-earth elements and phosphorus (KREEP) and high-aluminium basalts 7 ( µ value of about 2,600–3,700), indicating that the Chang’e-5 basalts were produced by melting of a KREEP-poor source. This age provides a pivotal calibration point for crater-counting chronology in the inner Solar System and provides insight on the volcanic and thermal history of the Moon."
https://openalex.org/W3207894168,"Mare volcanics on the Moon are the key record of thermo-chemical evolution throughout most of lunar history1-3. Young mare basalts-mainly distributed in a region rich in potassium, rare-earth elements and phosphorus (KREEP) in Oceanus Procellarum, called the Procellarum KREEP Terrane (PKT)4-were thought to be formed from KREEP-rich sources at depth5-7. However, this hypothesis has not been tested with young basalts from the PKT. Here we present a petrological and geochemical study of the basalt clasts from the PKT returned by the Chang'e-5 mission8. These two-billion-year-old basalts are the youngest lunar samples reported so far9. Bulk rock compositions have moderate titanium and high iron contents with KREEP-like rare-earth-element and high thorium concentrations. However, strontium-neodymium isotopes indicate that these basalts were derived from a non-KREEP mantle source. To produce the high abundances of rare-earth elements and thorium, low-degree partial melting and extensive fractional crystallization are required. Our results indicate that the KREEP association may not be a prerequisite for young mare volcanism. Absolving the need to invoke heat-producing elements in their source implies a more sustained cooling history of the lunar interior to generate the Moon's youngest melts."
https://openalex.org/W3206778834,"Clonal hematopoiesis (CH) results from somatic genomic alterations that drive clonal expansion of blood cells. Somatic gene mutations associated with hematologic malignancies detected in hematopoietic cells of healthy individuals, referred to as CH of indeterminate potential (CHIP), have been associated with myeloid malignancies, while mosaic chromosomal alterations (mCAs) have been associated with lymphoid malignancies. Here, we analyzed CHIP in 55,383 individuals and autosomal mCAs in 420,969 individuals with no history of hematologic malignancies in the UK Biobank and Mass General Brigham Biobank. We distinguished myeloid and lymphoid somatic gene mutations, as well as myeloid and lymphoid mCAs, and found both to be associated with risk of lineage-specific hematologic malignancies. Further, we performed an integrated analysis of somatic alterations with peripheral blood count parameters to stratify the risk of incident myeloid and lymphoid malignancies. These genetic alterations can be readily detected in clinical sequencing panels and used with blood count parameters to identify individuals at high risk of developing hematologic malignancies."
https://openalex.org/W3205324211,"Tumor-associated epitopes presented on MHC-I that can activate the immune system against cancer cells are typically identified from annotated protein-coding regions of the genome, but whether peptides originating from novel or unannotated open reading frames (nuORFs) can contribute to antitumor immune responses remains unclear. Here we show that peptides originating from nuORFs detected by ribosome profiling of malignant and healthy samples can be displayed on MHC-I of cancer cells, acting as additional sources of cancer antigens. We constructed a high-confidence database of translated nuORFs across tissues (nuORFdb) and used it to detect 3,555 translated nuORFs from MHC-I immunopeptidome mass spectrometry analysis, including peptides that result from somatic mutations in nuORFs of cancer samples as well as tumor-specific nuORFs translated in melanoma, chronic lymphocytic leukemia and glioblastoma. NuORFs are an unexplored pool of MHC-I-presented, tumor-specific peptides with potential as immunotherapy targets."
https://openalex.org/W3188076837,"Abstract The distribution of water in the Moon’s interior carries implications for the origin of the Moon 1 , the crystallization of the lunar magma ocean 2 and the duration of lunar volcanism 2 . The Chang’e-5 mission returned some of the youngest mare basalt samples reported so far, dated at 2.0 billion years ago (Ga) 3 , from the northwestern Procellarum KREEP Terrane, providing a probe into the spatiotemporal evolution of lunar water. Here we report the water abundances and hydrogen isotope compositions of apatite and ilmenite-hosted melt inclusions from the Chang’e-5 basalts. We derive a maximum water abundance of 283 ± 22 μg g −1 and a deuterium/hydrogen ratio of (1.06 ± 0.25) × 10 – 4 for the parent magma. Accounting for low-degree partial melting of the depleted mantle followed by extensive magma fractional crystallization 4 , we estimate a maximum mantle water abundance of 1–5 μg g −1 , suggesting that the Moon’s youngest volcanism was not driven by abundant water in its mantle source. Such a modest water content for the Chang’e-5 basalt mantle source region is at the low end of the range estimated from mare basalts that erupted from around 4.0 Ga to 2.8 Ga (refs. 5,6 ), suggesting that the mantle source of the Chang’e-5 basalts had become dehydrated by 2.0 Ga through previous melt extraction from the Procellarum KREEP Terrane mantle during prolonged volcanic activity."
https://openalex.org/W3207213424,"The nucleus accumbens (NAc) plays an important role in regulating multiple behaviors, and its dysfunction has been linked to many neural disorders. However, the molecular, cellular and anatomic heterogeneity underlying its functional diversity remains incompletely understood. In this study, we generated a cell census of the mouse NAc using single-cell RNA sequencing and multiplexed error-robust fluorescence in situ hybridization, revealing a high level of cell heterogeneity in this brain region. Here we show that the transcriptional and spatial diversity of neuron subtypes underlie the NAc's anatomic and functional heterogeneity. These findings explain how the seemingly simple neuronal composition of the NAc achieves its highly heterogenous structure and diverse functions. Collectively, our study generates a spatially resolved cell taxonomy for understanding the structure and function of the NAc, which demonstrates the importance of combining molecular and spatial information in revealing the fundamental features of the nervous system."
https://openalex.org/W3205195294,"Esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) shows remarkable variation in incidence that is not fully explained by known lifestyle and environmental risk factors. It has been speculated that an unknown exogenous exposure(s) could be responsible. Here we combine the fields of mutational signature analysis with cancer epidemiology to study 552 ESCC genomes from eight countries with varying incidence rates. Mutational profiles were similar across all countries studied. Associations between specific mutational signatures and ESCC risk factors were identified for tobacco, alcohol, opium and germline variants, with modest impacts on mutation burden. We find no evidence of a mutational signature indicative of an exogenous exposure capable of explaining differences in ESCC incidence. Apolipoprotein B mRNA-editing enzyme, catalytic polypeptide-like (APOBEC)-associated mutational signatures single-base substitution (SBS)2 and SBS13 were present in 88% and 91% of cases, respectively, and accounted for 25% of the mutation burden on average, indicating that APOBEC activation is a crucial step in ESCC tumor development."
https://openalex.org/W3207801663,"Longstanding social and economic inequities elevate health risks and vulnerabilities for Black, Indigenous and People of Color (BIPOC) communities. Engagement of BIPOC communities in infectious disease research is a critical component in efforts to increase vaccine confidence, acceptability, and uptake of future approved products. Recent data highlight the relative absence of BIPOC communities in vaccine clinical trials. Intentional and effective community engagement methods are needed to improve BIPOC inclusion. We describe the methods utilized for the successful enrollment of BIPOC participants in the U.S. Government (USG)-funded COVID-19 Prevention Network (CoVPN)-sponsored vaccine efficacy trials and analyze the demographic and enrollment data across the efficacy trials to inform future efforts to ensure inclusive participation. Across the four USG-funded COVID-19 vaccine clinical trials for which data are available, 47% of participants enrolled at CoVPN sites in the US were BIPOC. White enrollment outpaced enrollment of BIPOC participants throughout the accrual period, requiring the implementation of strategies to increase diverse and inclusive enrollment. Trials opening later benefitted considerably from strengthened community engagement efforts, and greater and more diverse volunteer registry records. Despite robust fiscal resources and a longstanding collaborative and collective effort, enrollment of White persons outpaced that of BIPOC communities. With appropriate resources, commitment and community engagement expertise, the equitable enrollment of BIPOC individuals can be achieved. To ensure this goal, intentional efforts are needed, including an emphasis on diversity of enrollment in clinical trials, establishment of enrollment goals, ongoing robust community engagement, conducting population-specific trials, and research to inform best practices."
https://openalex.org/W3206682102,"The basolateral amygdala (BLA) plays essential roles in behaviors motivated by stimuli with either positive or negative valence, but how it processes motivationally opposing information and participates in establishing valence-specific behaviors remains unclear. Here, by targeting Fezf2-expressing neurons in the BLA, we identify and characterize two functionally distinct classes in behaving mice, the negative-valence neurons and positive-valence neurons, which innately represent aversive and rewarding stimuli, respectively, and through learning acquire predictive responses that are essential for punishment avoidance or reward seeking. Notably, these two classes of neurons receive inputs from separate sets of sensory and limbic areas, and convey punishment and reward information through projections to the nucleus accumbens and olfactory tubercle, respectively, to drive negative and positive reinforcement. Thus, valence-specific BLA neurons are wired with distinctive input-output structures, forming a circuit framework that supports the roles of the BLA in encoding, learning and executing valence-specific motivated behaviors."
https://openalex.org/W3207767877,"The persistence of negative affect in pain leads to co-morbid symptoms such as anhedonia and depression-major health issues in the United States. The neuronal circuitry and contribution of specific cellular populations underlying these behavioral adaptations remains unknown. A common characteristic of negative affect is a decrease in motivation to initiate and complete goal-directed behavior, known as anhedonia. We report that in rodents, inflammatory pain decreased the activity of ventral tegmental area (VTA) dopamine (DA) neurons, which are critical mediators of motivational states. Pain increased rostromedial tegmental nucleus inhibitory tone onto VTA DA neurons, making them less excitable. Furthermore, the decreased activity of DA neurons was associated with reduced motivation for natural rewards, consistent with anhedonia-like behavior. Selective activation of VTA DA neurons was sufficient to restore baseline motivation and hedonic responses to natural rewards. These findings reveal pain-induced adaptations within VTA DA neurons that underlie anhedonia-like behavior."
https://openalex.org/W3206579671,"Abstract Acute myeloid and lymphoid leukemias often harbor chromosomal translocations involving the KMT2A gene, encoding the KMT2A lysine methyltransferase (also known as mixed-lineage leukemia-1), and produce in-frame fusions of KMT2A to other chromatin-regulatory proteins. Here we map fusion-specific targets across the genome for diverse KMT2A oncofusion proteins in cell lines and patient samples. By modifying CUT&amp;Tag chromatin profiling for full automation, we identify common and tumor-subtype-specific sites of aberrant chromatin regulation induced by KMT2A oncofusion proteins. A subset of KMT2A oncofusion-binding sites are marked by bivalent (H3K4me3 and H3K27me3) chromatin signatures, and single-cell CUT&amp;Tag profiling reveals that these sites display cell-to-cell heterogeneity suggestive of lineage plasticity. In addition, we find that aberrant enrichment of H3K4me3 in gene bodies is sensitive to Menin inhibitors, demonstrating the utility of automated chromatin profiling for identifying therapeutic vulnerabilities. Thus, integration of automated and single-cell CUT&amp;Tag can uncover epigenomic heterogeneity within patient samples and predict sensitivity to therapeutic agents."

https://openalex.org/W3207872172,"RNA interference (RNAi) for spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 can prevent and reverse behavioral deficits and neuropathological readouts in mouse models, with safety and benefit lasting over many months. The RNAi trigger, expressed from adeno-associated virus vectors (AAV.miS1), also corrected misregulated microRNAs (miRNA) such as miR150. Subsequently, we showed that the delivery method was scalable, and that AAV.miS1 was safe in short-term pilot nonhuman primate (NHP) studies. To advance the technology to patients, investigational new drug (IND)-enabling studies in NHPs were initiated. After AAV.miS1 delivery to deep cerebellar nuclei, we unexpectedly observed cerebellar toxicity. Both small-RNA-seq and studies using AAVs devoid of miRNAs showed that this was not a result of saturation of the endogenous miRNA processing machinery. RNA-seq together with sequencing of the AAV product showed that, despite limited amounts of cross-packaged material, there was substantial inverted terminal repeat (ITR) promoter activity that correlated with neuropathologies. ITR promoter activity was reduced by altering the miS1 expression context. The surprising contrast between our rodent and NHP findings highlight the need for extended safety studies in multiple species when assessing new therapeutics for human application."
https://openalex.org/W3207266761,"DNA deaminase enzymes play key roles in immunity and have recently been harnessed for their biotechnological applications. In base editors (BEs), the combination of DNA deaminase mutator activity with CRISPR-Cas localization confers the powerful ability to directly convert one target DNA base into another. While efforts have been made to improve targeting efficiency and precision, all BEs so far use a constitutively active DNA deaminase. The absence of regulatory control over promiscuous deaminase activity remains a major limitation to accessing the widespread potential of BEs. Here, we reveal sites that permit splitting of DNA cytosine deaminases into two inactive fragments, whose reapproximation reconstitutes activity. These findings allow for the development of split-engineered BEs (seBEs), which newly enable small-molecule control over targeted mutator activity. We show that the seBE strategy facilitates robust regulated editing with BE scaffolds containing diverse deaminases, offering a generalizable solution for temporally controlling precision genome editing."
https://openalex.org/W3205076367,"The aim of this study was to develop and evaluate a machine vision algorithm to assess the pain level in horses, using an automatic computational classifier based on the Horse Grimace Scale (HGS) and trained by machine learning method. The use of the Horse Grimace Scale is dependent on a human observer, who most of the time does not have availability to evaluate the animal for long periods and must also be well trained in order to apply the evaluation system correctly. In addition, even with adequate training, the presence of an unknown person near an animal in pain can result in behavioral changes, making the evaluation more complex. As a possible solution, the automatic video-imaging system will be able to monitor pain responses in horses more accurately and in real-time, and thus allow an earlier diagnosis and more efficient treatment for the affected animals. This study is based on assessment of facial expressions of 7 horses that underwent castration, collected through a video system positioned on the top of the feeder station, capturing images at 4 distinct timepoints daily for two days before and four days after surgical castration. A labeling process was applied to build a pain facial image database and machine learning methods were used to train the computational pain classifier. The machine vision algorithm was developed through the training of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) that resulted in an overall accuracy of 75.8% while classifying pain on three levels: not present, moderately present, and obviously present. While classifying between two categories (pain not present and pain present) the overall accuracy reached 88.3%. Although there are some improvements to be made in order to use the system in a daily routine, the model appears promising and capable of measuring pain on images of horses automatically through facial expressions, collected from video images."
https://openalex.org/W3207745724,"The aim of this study was to evaluate the predictive value of the constructs proposed by two influential theoretical frameworks: the Protection Motivation Theory (PMT) and the Big Five (B5) model of personality in predicting health-related coping behavior during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Both adaptive (i.e., preventive) and maladaptive (i.e., avoidant behavior and wishful thinking) coping behavior was measured. The study was conducted during the first wave of the pandemic. The sample consisted of 397 persons from the general Polish population. The findings provided strong support for the PMT constructs' predictive value, especially with regard to pandemic-related adaptive behavior. The B5 personality traits accounted for a small proportion of the variability of coping behavior, especially when maladaptive behavior was the outcome. The PMT model showed incremental validity over and above demographic variables and personality traits in predicting preventive behavior, avoidant behavior, and wishful thinking; however, the patterns of relationships differ across the types of coping behavior. According to the current results, to increase adherence to preventive measures during an epidemic, all the PMT constructs should be considered while persuasive communication to the public is formulated."
https://openalex.org/W3205690430,"Abstract The bipolar androgen therapy (BAT) to treat prostate cancer (PCa) includes cycles of supraphysiological androgen levels (SAL) under androgen-deprivation therapy (ADT). We showed previously that SAL induces cellular senescence in androgen-sensitive PCa cells and in ex vivo-treated patient PCa tumor samples. Here, we analyzed the underlying molecular pathway and reveal that SAL induces cellular senescence in both, castration-sensitive (CSPC) LNCaP and castration-resistant PCa (CRPC) C4-2 cells through the cell cycle inhibitor p15 INK4b and increased phosphorylation of AKT. Treatment with the AKT inhibitor (AKTi) potently inhibited SAL-induced expression of p15 INK4b and cellular senescence in both cell lines. Proximity-ligation assays (PLA) combined with high-resolution laser-scanning microscopy indicate that SAL promotes interaction of endogenous androgen receptor (AR) with AKT in the cytoplasm as well as in the nucleus detectable after three days. Transcriptome sequencing (RNA-seq) comparing the SAL-induced transcriptomes of LNCaP with C4-2 cells as well as with AKTi-treated cell transcriptomes revealed landscapes for cell senescence. Interestingly, one of the identified genes is the lncRNA SAT1 . SAL treatment of native patient tumor samples ex vivo upregulates lncRNA SAT1 . In PCa tumor tissues, lncRNA SAT1 is downregulated compared with nontumor tissues of the same patients. Knockdown indicates that the lncRNA SAT1 is crucial for SAL-induced cancer-cell senescence as an upstream factor for pAKT and for p15 INK4b . Further, knockdown of lncRNA SAT1 enhances cell proliferation by SAL, suggesting that lncRNA SAT1 serves as a tumor suppressor at SAL. Interestingly, immunoprecipitation of AR detected lncRNA SAT1 as an AR-interacting partner that regulates AR target-gene expression. Similarly, RNA-ChIP experiments revealed the interaction of AR with lncRNA SAT1 on chromatin. Thus, we identified a novel AR-lncRNA SAT1 -AKT-p15 INK4b signaling axis to mediate SAL-induced cellular senescence."
https://openalex.org/W3207202853,"The EMT (epithelial-to-mesenchymal-transition) subtype of gastric cancer (GC) is associated with poor treatment responses and unfavorable clinical outcomes. Despite the broad physiological roles of the micro-RNA (miR)-200 family, they largely serve to maintain the overall epithelial phenotype. However, during late-stage gastric tumorigenesis, members of the miR-200 family are markedly suppressed, resulting in the transition to the mesenchymal state and the acquisition of invasive properties. As such, the miR-200 family represents a robust molecular marker of EMT, and subsequently, disease severity and prognosis. Most reports have studied the effect of single miR-200 family member knockdown. Here, we employ a multiplex CRISPR/Cas9 system to generate a complete miR-200 family knockout (FKO) to investigate their collective and summative role in regulating key cellular processes during GC pathogenesis. Genetic deletion of all miR-200s in the human GC cell lines induced potent morphological alterations, G1/S cell cycle arrest, increased senescence-associated β-galactosidase (SA-β-Gal) activity, and aberrant metabolism, collectively resembling the senescent phenotype. Coupling RNA-seq data with publicly available datasets, we revealed a clear separation of senescent and non-senescent states amongst FKO cells and control cells, respectively. Further analysis identified key senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) components in FKO cells and a positive feedback loop for maintenance of the senescent state controlled by activation of TGF-β and TNF-α pathways. Finally, we showed that miR-200 FKO associated senescence in cancer epithelial cells significantly recruited stromal cells in the tumor microenvironment. Our work has identified a new role of miR-200 family members which function as an integrated unit serving to link senescence with EMT, two major conserved biological processes."
https://openalex.org/W3207440444,"We typically observe a decrement in vigilance with time-on-task, which favors the propensity for mind-wandering, i.e., the shifting of attention from the task at hand to task-unrelated thoughts. Here, we examined participants' mind-wandering, either intentional or unintentional, while performing vigilance tasks that tap different components of vigilance. Intentional mind-wandering is expected mainly when the arousal component is involved, whereas unintentional mind-wandering is expected mainly in tasks involving the executive component. The Psychomotor Vigilance Task (PVT) assessed the arousal component, whereas the Sustained Attention to Response task (SART) assessed the executive component of vigilance. The two types of mind-wandering were probed throughout task execution. The results showed that the overall rate of mind-wandering was higher in the PVT than in the SART. Intentional mind-wandering was higher with the PVT than with the SART, whereas unintentional mind-wandering was higher with the SART than with the PVT. Regarding mind-wandering as a function of vigilance decrement with time-on-task, unintentional mind-wandering in the PVT increased between blocks 1 and 2 and then stabilized, whereas a progressive increase was observed in the SART. Regarding intentional mind-wandering, a progressive increase was only observed in the SART. The differential patterns of intentional and unintentional mind-wandering in both tasks suggest that, intentional mind wandering occurs mainly in arousal tasks in which propensity to mind-wander has little impact on task performance. However, unintentional mind-wandering occurs mainly in executive tasks as a result of a failure of cognitive control, which promotes attentional resources to be diverted toward mind-wandering. These results are discussed in the context of the resource-control model of mind-wandering."
https://openalex.org/W3206638464,"Radiation is an important therapeutic strategy for hepatocellular (HCC). In this study, we evaluated the role of the dual PI3K/mTOR inhibitor, PKI-587, on radiosensitization of HCC and its possible mechanism. MTT, colony formation, flow cytometry, and immunofluorescence were used to analyze the proliferation, cell cycle, formation of residual γ-H2AX foci, and apoptosis of HCC cells. A SK-Hep1 xenograft HCC model was used to assess the effects of PKI-587 in combination with ionizing radiation in vivo. The activation levels of PI3K/AKT/mTOR and DNA damage repair pathways and their downstream effector molecules were detected with Western blot. It was found that PKI-587 sensitized HCC cells to radiation by increasing DNA damage, enhancing G0/G1 cell-cycle arrest, and inducing apoptosis. In vivo, the combination of radiation with PKI-587 significantly inhibited tumor growth. These findings suggest the usefulness of PKI-587 on radiosensitization of HCC cells by inhibiting the PI3K/AKT/mTOR and DNA damage repair pathways. The combination of ionizing radiation and PKI-587 may be a strategy to improve the efficacy of treating HCC."
https://openalex.org/W3205379013,"Eukaryotic initiation factor 2A (eIF2A) is a 65 kDa protein that functions in minor initiation pathways, which affect the translation of only a subset of messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNAs), such as internal ribosome entry site (IRES)-containing mRNAs and/or mRNAs harboring upstream near cognate/non-AUG start codons. These non-canonical initiation events are important for regulation of protein synthesis during cellular development and/or the integrated stress response. Selective eIF2A knockdown in cellular systems significantly inhibits translation of such mRNAs, which rely on alternative initiation mechanisms for their translation. However, there exists a gap in our understanding of how eIF2A functions in mammalian systems in vivo (on the organismal level) and ex vivo (in cells). Here, using an eIF2A-knockout (KO) mouse model, we present evidence implicating eIF2A in the biology of aging, metabolic syndrome and central tolerance. We discovered that eIF2A-KO mice have reduced life span and that eIF2A plays an important role in maintenance of lipid homeostasis, the control of glucose tolerance, insulin resistance and also reduces the abundance of B lymphocytes and dendritic cells in the thymic medulla of mice. We also show the eIF2A KO affects male and female mice differently, suggesting that eIF2A may affect sex-specific pathways. Interestingly, our experiments involving pharmacological induction of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress with tunicamycin did not reveal any substantial difference between the response to ER stress in eIF2A-KO and wild-type mice. The identification of eIF2A function in the development of metabolic syndrome bears promise for the further identification of specific eIF2A targets responsible for these changes."
https://openalex.org/W3205762162,"Disclosure of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) status improves adherence to antiretroviral therapy (ART) and increases the chance of virological suppression and retention in care. However, information on the effect of disclosure of HIV status on adherence to clinic visits and patient representation is limited. We evaluated the effects of disclosure of HIV status on adherence to clinic visits and patient representation among people living with HIV in eastern Uganda.In this quasi-randomized study, we performed a propensity-score-matched analysis on observational data collected between October 2018 and September 2019 from a large ART clinic in eastern Uganda. We matched participants with disclosed HIV status to those with undisclosed HIV status based on similar propensity scores in a 1:1 ratio using the nearest neighbor caliper matching technique. The primary outcomes were patient representation (the tendency for patients to have other people pick-up their medications) and adherence to clinic visits. We fitted a logistic regression to estimate the effects of disclosure of HIV status, reported using the odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI).Of 957 participants, 500 were matched. In propensity-score matched analysis, disclosure of HIV status significantly impacts adherence to clinic visits (OR = 1.63; 95% CI, 1.13-2.36) and reduced patient representation (OR = O.49; 95% CI, 0.32-0.76). Sensitivity analysis showed robustness to unmeasured confounders (Gamma value = 2.2, p = 0.04).Disclosure of HIV status is associated with increased adherence to clinic visits and lower representation to collect medicines at the clinic. Disclosure of HIV status should be encouraged to enhance continuity of care among people living with HIV."
https://openalex.org/W3207035443,"Diabetes mellitus (DM) and chronic kidney disease (CKD) are common causes of morbidity and mortality. Flaxseed contains several bioactive compounds that have been shown to possess anti-inflammatory and antioxidative properties. The aim of the present study was to investigate the possible effect of flaxseed in diabetic rats with adenine-induced CKD.Male Wister rats (n = 48) were randomly divided into seven equal groups and treated for 33 consecutive days as follows: G1: control. G2 adenine, G3: streptozotocin (STZ), G4: flaxseed, G5: adenine+flaxseed, G6: STZ+flaxseed, G7: adenine+STZ+flaxseed). DM or CKD were experimentally induced by a single intraperitoneal injection of streptozotocin (STZ) or by adenine via oral gavage, respectively.Rats fed adenine alone exhibited several changes including decreased body weight, increased food and water intake and urine output, increased urinary albumin/creatinine ratio. They also showed an increase in plasma urea and, creatinine, indoxyl sulfate, neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin and cystatin C, and a decrease in renalase activity. These were associated with significant changes in inflammatory and oxidative biomarkers, e.g., increase in 8-isoprostane, 8 -hydroxy -2-deoxy guanosine and decrease in antioxidant enzymes, as well as increase in interleukins 1β and 6, and NF-κB, and a decrease in interlukin-10. Histopathologically, there was increased tubular necrosis and fibrosis. Concomitant administration of adenine and STZ further worsened the renal damage induced by adenine alone. Flaxseed significantly ameliorated the changes caused by adenine and STZ, given either singly or in combination.These findings suggest that flaxseed is a potential therapeutic agent in attenuating the progression of CKD in diabetes."
https://openalex.org/W3205876780,"At birth, human infants are poised to survive in harsh, hostile conditions. An understanding of the state of newborn skin development and maturation is key to the maintenance of health, optimum response to injury, healing and disease. The observational study collected full-thickness newborn skin samples from 27 infants at surgery and compared them to skin samples from 43 adult sites protected from ultraviolet radiation exposure, as the standard for stable, mature skin. Transcriptomics profiling and gene set enrichment analysis were performed. Statistical analysis established over 25,000 differentially regulated probe sets, representing 10,647 distinct genes, in infant skin compared to adult skin. Gene set enrichment analysis showed a significant increase in 143 biological processes (adjusted p < 0.01) in infant skin, versus adult skin samples, including extracellular matrix (ECM) organization, cell adhesion, collagen fibril organization and fatty acid metabolic process. ECM organization and ECM structure organization were the biological processes in infant skin with the lowest adjusted P-value. Genes involving epidermal development, immune function, cell differentiation, and hair cycle were overexpressed in adults, representing 101 significantly enriched biological processes (adjusted p < 0.01). The processes with the highest significant difference were skin and epidermal development, e.g., keratinocyte differentiation, keratinization and cornification intermediate filament cytoskeleton organization and hair cycle. Enriched Gene Ontology (GO) biological processes also involved immune function, including antigen processing and presentation. When compared to ultraviolet radiation-protected adult skin, our results provide essential insight into infant skin and its ability to support the newborn's preparedness to survive and flourish, despite the infant's new environment laden with microbes, high oxygen tension and potential irritants. This fundamental knowledge is expected to guide strategies to protect and preserve the features of unperturbed, young skin."
https://openalex.org/W3206339739,"2-Phenylethanol (2-PE) is a valuable aromatic compound with favorable flavors and good properties, resulting in its widespread application in the cosmetic, food and medical industries. In this study, a mutant strain, AD032, was first obtained by adaptive evolution under 2-PE stress. Then, a fusion protein from the Ehrlich pathway, composed of tyrB from Escherichia coli, kdcA from Lactococcus lactis and ADH2 from Saccharomyces cerevisiae, was constructed and expressed. As a result, 3.14 g/L 2-PE was achieved using L-phenylalanine as a precursor. To further increase 2-PE production, L-glutamate oxidase from Streptomyces overexpression was applied for the first time in our research to improve the supply of α-ketoglutarate in the transamination of 2-PE synthesis. Furthermore, we found that the disruption of the pyruvate decarboxylase encoding gene PDC5 caused an increase in 2-PE production, which has not yet been reported. Finally, assembly of the efficient metabolic modules and process optimization resulted in the strain RM27, which reached 4.02 g/L 2-PE production from 6.7 g/L L-phenylalanine without in situ product recovery. The strain RM27 produced 2-PE (0.8 mol/mol) with L-phenylalanine as a precursor, which was considerably high, and displayed manufacturing potential regarding food safety and process simplification aspects. This study suggests that innovative strategies regarding metabolic modularization provide improved prospects for 2-PE production in food exploitation."

Insights into the implementation process and perceived effectiveness of the law could guide implementation in California and the many states that have enacted or are considering enacting such a law.We conducted 21 semi-structured interviews with 27 key informants, including judges, law enforcement officers, city and district attorneys, policy experts, and firearm violence researchers. Analysis of transcripts was guided by grounded theory and the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR).The following constructs emerged within 4 CFIR domains as salient features of implementation: 1) implementation characteristics: risk of violence, cost, and adaptability; 2) outer setting: interagency coordination and local firearm ideology; 3) inner setting: readiness for implementation and law enforcement firearm culture; and 4) implementation process: planning and engaging with those involved in implementation. Key informants perceived the law to be effective, particularly for preventing firearm suicide, but agreed that more research was needed. While most indicated that the law resulted in positive outcomes, concerns about the potential for class- and race-based inequities were also raised.Implementation of the GVRO law in California was hampered by a lack of funding to support local proactive implementation efforts. This resulted in ad hoc policies and procedures, leading to inconsistent practices and widespread confusion among those responsible for implementation. In states that have not begun implementation, we recommend dedicating funding for implementation and creating local procedures statewide prior to the law's rollout. In California, recommendations include providing training on the GVRO law-including an explication of agency-specific roles, responsibilities, and procedures-to officers, city attorneys, and civil court judges."
https://openalex.org/W3205898845,"Many organisms rely on oxygen to generate cellular energy (adenosine triphosphate or ATP). During severe hypoxia, the production of ATP decreases, leading to cell damage or death. Conversely, excessive oxygen causes oxidative stress that is equally damaging to cells. To mitigate pathological outcomes, organisms have evolved mechanisms to adapt to fluctuations in oxygen levels. Zebrafish embryos are remarkably hypoxia-tolerant, surviving anoxia (zero oxygen) for hours in a hypometabolic, energy-conserving state. To begin to unravel underlying mechanisms, we analyze here the distribution of the N-myc Downstream Regulated Gene (ndrg) family, ndrg1-4, and their transcriptional response to hypoxia. These genes have been primarily studied in cancer cells and hence little is understood about their normal function and regulation. We show here using in situ hybridization that ndrgs are expressed in metabolically demanding organs of the zebrafish embryo, such as the brain, kidney, and heart. To investigate whether ndrgs are hypoxia-responsive, we exposed embryos to different durations and severity of hypoxia and analyzed transcript levels. We observed that ndrgs are differentially regulated by hypoxia and that ndrg1a has the most robust response, with a ninefold increase following prolonged anoxia. We further show that this treatment resulted in de novo expression of ndrg1a in tissues where the transcript is not observed under normoxic conditions and changes in Ndrg1a protein expression post-reoxygenation. These findings provide an entry point into understanding the role of this conserved gene family in the adaptation of normal cells to hypoxia and reoxygenation."
https://openalex.org/W3206797930,"Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) is a neuroendocrine tumor either induced by integration of the Merkel cell polyomavirus into the cell genome or by accumulation of UV-light-associated mutations (VP-MCC and UV-MCC). Whether VP- and UV-MCC have the same or different cellular origins is unclear; with mesenchymal or epidermal origins discussed. DNA-methylation patterns have a proven utility in determining cellular origins of cancers. Therefore, we used this approach to uncover evidence regarding the cell of origin of classical VP- and UV-MCC cell lines, i.e., cell lines with a neuroendocrine growth pattern (n = 9 and n = 4, respectively). Surprisingly, we observed high global similarities in the DNA-methylation of UV- and VP-MCC cell lines. CpGs of lower methylation in VP-MCC cell lines were associated with neuroendocrine marker genes such as SOX2 and INSM1, or linked to binding sites of EZH2 and SUZ12 of the polycomb repressive complex 2, i.e., genes with an impact on carcinogenesis and differentiation of neuroendocrine cancers. Thus, the observed differences appear to be rooted in viral compared to mutation-driven carcinogenesis rather than distinct cells of origin. To test this hypothesis, we used principal component analysis, to compare DNA-methylation data from different epithelial and non-epithelial neuroendocrine cancers and established a scoring model for epithelial and neuroendocrine characteristics. Subsequently, we applied this scoring model to the DNA-methylation data of the VP- and UV-MCC cell lines, revealing that both clearly scored as epithelial cancers. In summary, our comprehensive analysis of DNA-methylation suggests a common epithelial origin of UV- and VP-MCC cell lines."

Proliposomes were developed by thin film hydration method and converted into the liposomal derived gel using carbopol-934 as a gelling agent. Formulations with varied lecithin to cholesterol ratios were investigated to obtain the optimal size, entrapment efficiency, and enhanced in vitro dissolution. Dynamic light scattering analysis revealed the particle size and zeta potential in the range of 385.1±2.45-762.8±2.05 nm and -22.4±0.55-31.2±0.96mV respectively. Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopic analysis depicted the physicochemical compatibility, powdered x-ray diffraction (PXRD) analysis predicted the crystalline nature of pure drug and its transition into amorphous form within formulation. The differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) demonstrated the thermal stability of the formulation. The in vitro drug release study using dialysis membrane displayed the enhanced dissolution of diacerein due to the presence of hydrophilic carrier (Maltodextrin) followed by sustained drug release due to the presence of lipid mixture (lecithin and cholesterol). Ex vivo permeation studies depicted 3.50±0.27 and 3.21±0.22 folds enhanced flux of liposomal gels as compared to control. The acute oral toxicity study showed safety and biocompatibility of the system as no histopathological changes in vital organs were observed. These results suggests that proliposomes and liposomal derived gel are promising candidates for the solubility and permeability enhancement of diacerein in the management of osteoarthritis."
https://openalex.org/W3205715797,"Tropical forests are one of the main carbon sinks on Earth, but the magnitude of CO2 absorbed by tropical vegetation remains uncertain. Terrestrial biosphere models (TBMs) are commonly used to estimate the CO2 absorbed by forests, but their performance is highly sensitive to the parameterization of processes that control leaf-level CO2 exchange. Direct measurements of leaf respiratory and photosynthetic traits that determine vegetation CO2 fluxes are critical, but traditional approaches are time-consuming. Reflectance spectroscopy can be a viable alternative for the estimation of these traits and, because data collection is markedly quicker than traditional gas exchange, the approach can enable the rapid assembly of large datasets. However, the application of spectroscopy to estimate photosynthetic traits across a wide range of tropical species, leaf ages and light environments has not been extensively studied. Here, we used leaf reflectance spectroscopy together with partial least-squares regression (PLSR) modeling to estimate leaf respiration (Rdark25), the maximum rate of carboxylation by the enzyme Rubisco (Vcmax25), the maximum rate of electron transport (Jmax25), and the triose phosphate utilization rate (Tp25), all normalized to 25°C. We collected data from three tropical forest sites and included leaves from fifty-three species sampled at different leaf phenological stages and different leaf light environments. Our resulting spectra-trait models validated on randomly sampled data showed good predictive performance for Vcmax25, Jmax25, Tp25 and Rdark25 (RMSE of 13, 20, 1.5 and 0.3 μmol m-2 s-1, and R2 of 0.74, 0.73, 0.64 and 0.58, respectively). The models showed similar performance when applied to leaves of species not included in the training dataset, illustrating that the approach is robust for capturing the main axes of trait variation in tropical species. We discuss the utility of the spectra-trait and traditional gas exchange approaches for enhancing tropical plant trait studies and improving the parameterization of TBMs."
https://openalex.org/W3207250517,"Knowledge of both the genetic diversity and geographical distribution of animal genetic resources is a prerequisite for their sustainable utilization, improvement and conservation. The present study was undertaken to explore the current morphological variability within the sheep population in Benin as a prelude for their molecular characterization. From November 2018 to February 2020, 25 quantitative linear body measurements and 5 qualitative physical traits were recorded on 1240 adult ewes from the 10 phytogeographic zones that comprise the three vegetation zones of Benin. Fourteen morphological indices were calculated based on the linear body measurements. The collected data were first analyzed using multiple comparisons of least-square means (LSmeans), followed by generalized linear model (GLM) procedures, to explore the relationships among the measured morphometric traits and the 10 phytogeographic zones. Next, the presence of any genetic sub-populations was examined using multivariate analytical methods, including canonical discriminant analysis (CDA) and ascending hierarchical clustering (AHC). Univariate analyses indicated that all quantitative linear body measurements varied significantly (P<0.05) across the phytogeographic zones. The highest values (LSmean± standard error) of withers height (68.3±0.47 cm), sternum height (46.0±0.35 cm), and rump height (68.8±0.47 cm) were recorded in the Mekrou-Pendjari zone, the drier phytogeographic zone in the North, whereas the lowest values, 49.2±0.34, 25.9±0.26, and 52.0±0.35 cm, respectively, were recorded in the Pobe zone in the South. Multivariate analyses revealed the prevalence of four distinct sheep sub-populations in Benin. The sub-population from the South could be assimilated to the short-legged and that from the North to the West African long-legged sheep. The two other sub-populations were intermediate and closer to the crossbreeds or another short-legged sub-breed. The proportion of individuals correctly classified in their group of origin was approximately 74%. These results uncovered a spatial morphological variation in the Beninese sheep population along a South-North phytogeographic gradient."
https://openalex.org/W3207524800,"Sri Lanka is an amphibian hotspot of global significance. Its anuran fauna is dominated by the shrub frogs of the genus Pseudophilautus. Except for one small clade of four species in Peninsular India, these cool-wet adapted frogs, numbering some 59 extant species, are distributed mainly across the montane and lowland rain forests of the island. With species described primarily by morphological means, the diversification has never yet been subjected to a molecular species delimitation analysis, a procedure now routinely applied in taxonomy. Here we test the species boundaries of Pseudophilautus in the context of the phylogenetic species concept (PSC). We use all the putative species for which credible molecular data are available (nDNA-Rag-1; mt-DNA- 12S rRNA, 16S rRNA) to build a well resolved phylogeny, which is subjected to species delimitation analyses. The ABGD, bPTP, mPTP and bGMYC species delimitation methods applied to the 16S rRNA frog barcoding gene (for all species), 12S rRNA and Rag-1 nDNA grouped P. procax and P. abundus; P. hallidayi and P. fergusonianus; P. reticulatus and P. pappilosus; P. pleurotaenia and P. hoipolloi; P. hoffmani and P. asankai; P. silvaticus and P. limbus; P. dilmah and P. hankeni; P. fulvus and P. silus.. Surprisingly, all analyses recovered 14 unidentified potential new species as well. The geophylogeny affirms a distribution across the island's aseasonal 'wet zone' and its three principal hill ranges, suggestive of allopatric speciation playing a dominant role, especially between mountain masses. Among the species that are merged by the delimitation analyses, a pattern leading towards a model of parapatric speciation emerges-ongoing speciation in the presence of gene flow. This delimitation analysis reinforces the species hypotheses, paving the way to a reasonable understanding of Sri Lankan Pseudophilautus, enabling both deeper analyses and conservation efforts of this remarkable diversification. http://zoobank.org/urn:lsid:zoobank.org:pub:DA869B6B-870A-4ED3-BF5D-5AA3F69DDD27."
https://openalex.org/W3207760952,"In recent years, noisy bustling environments have created situations in which earmuffs must soundproof only specific noise while transmitting significant sounds, such as voices, for work safety and efficiency. Two sound insulation technologies have been utilized: passive noise control (PNC) and active noise control (ANC). However, PNC is incapable of insulating selective frequencies of noise, and ANC is limited to low-frequency sounds. Thus, it has been difficult for traditional earmuffs to cancel out only high-frequency noise that people feel uncomfortable hearing. Here, we propose an acoustic notch filtering earmuff utilizing Helmholtz resonator (HR) arrays that provides a sound attenuation effect around the tuneable resonant frequency. A sheet-like sound insulating plate comprising HR arrays is realized in a honeycomb structure. Since the resonant frequency is determined by the geometry of the HR arrays, a highly audible sound region can be designed as the target frequency. In this research, the acoustic notch filtering performance of the proposed HR array plate is investigated in both simulations and experiments. Furthermore, the fabricated earmuffs using the novel HR array plates achieve a sound insulation performance exceeding 40 dB at the target frequency, which is sufficiently high compared to that of conventional earmuffs. The experimental results confirm that the proposed device is a useful approach for insulating frequency-selective sound."
https://openalex.org/W3205056410,"One influential view in neuroscience is that pairwise cell interactions explain the firing patterns of large populations. Despite its prevalence, this view originates from studies in the retina and visual cortex of anesthetized animals. Whether pairwise interactions predict the firing patterns of neurons across multiple brain areas in behaving animals remains unknown. Here, we performed multi-area electrical recordings to find that 2nd-order interactions explain a high fraction of entropy of the population response in macaque cortical areas V1 and V4. Surprisingly, despite the brain-state modulation of neuronal responses, the model based on pairwise interactions captured ∼90% of the spiking activity structure during wakefulness and sleep. However, regardless of brain state, pairwise interactions fail to explain experimentally observed entropy in neural populations from the prefrontal cortex. Thus, while simple pairwise interactions explain the collective behavior of visual cortical networks across brain states, explaining the population dynamics in downstream areas involves higher-order interactions."

It has significant impacts on both physical and emotional health-related quality of life comparable to other major illnesses. Accurately prediction of psoriasis using biomarkers from routine laboratory tests has important practical values. Our goal is to derive a powerful predictive model for psoriasis disease based on only routine hospital tests. We collected a data set including 466 psoriasis patients and 520 healthy controls with 81 variables from only laboratory routine tests, such as age, total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, blood pressure, albumin, and platelet distribution width. In this study, Boruta feature selection method was applied to select the most relevant features, with which a Random Forest model was constructed. The model was tested with 30 repetitions of 10-fold cross-validation. Our classification model yielded an average accuracy of 86.9%. 26 notable features were selected by Boruta, among which 15 features are confirmed from previous studies, and the rest are worth further investigations. The experimental results demonstrate that the machine learning approach has good potential in predictive modeling for the psoriasis disease given the information only from routine hospital tests."
https://openalex.org/W3205532659,"A growing level of environmental awareness in societies has led to an increased interest in the odor nuisance. Residents' complaints have ultimately revealed the need to develop adequate research methods that would ensure objective measurements, thus shedding more light on this complex problem. One of the possible ways to conduct an objective odor assessment is to use a sensory panel in the tests. This paper presents the procedure for selecting and training the sensory analysis team especially for the purposes of odor nuisance testing. Several useful suggestions for conducting studies that involve a sensory panel are also provided. This in turn can prove a useful tool, supplementing the EN 13725 standard within the scope of building and convening a sensory panel. In this paper a performance comparison of two sensory panels is also discussed: one that received a basic training of 20h, solely based on the guidelines of the EN 13725 standard and another, whose members completed an extended training of 60h, based on the standards and guidelines used in the field of sensory analysis. It has been shown that acquiring more knowledge and developing certain competences in the field of sensory analysis may contribute to an increase in the overall and individual precision of determinations as adequate sensory training improves the panel's performance."

Lane detection, as a vital part of ADAS, has poor real-time performance and accuracy in multiple scenarios, such as road damage, light changes, and traffic jams. Moreover, the sparse pixels of lane lines on the road pose a tremendous challenge to the task of lane line detection. In this study, we propose a model that fuses non bottleneck skip residual connections and an improved attention pyramid (IAP) to effectively obtain contextual information about real-time scenes and improve the robustness and real-time performance of current lane detection models. The proposed model modifies the efficient residual factorized pyramid scene parsing network (ERF-PSPNet) and utilizes skip residual connections in non bottleneck-1D modules. A decoder with an IAP provides high-level feature maps with pixel-level attention. We add an auxiliary segmenter and a lane predictor side-by-side after the encoder, the former for lane prediction and the latter to assist with semantic segmentation for classification purposes, as well as to solve the gradient disappearance problem. On the CULane dataset, the F1 metric reaches 92.20% in the normal scenario, and the F1 metric of the model is higher than the F1 metrics of other existing models, such as ERFNet-HESA, ENet_LGAD, and DSB+LDCDI, in normal, crowded, night, dazzling light and no line scenarios; in addition, the mean F1 of the nine scenarios reached 74.10%, the runtime (time taken to test 100 images) of the model was 5.88 ms, and the number of parameters was 2.31M, which means that the model achieves a good trade-off between real-time performance and accuracy compared to the current best results (i.e., a running time of 13.4 ms and 0.98M parameters)."

In the study of Sippel et al. (21Sippel C.J. Fallon R.J. Perlmutter D.H. Bile acid efflux mediated by the rat liver canalicular bile acid transport/ecto-ATPase protein requires serine 503 phosphorylation and is regulated by tyrosine 488 phosphorylation.J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19539-19545Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), Ser503 in rat CEACAM1-LF was shown to be phosphorylated by PKC and was required for bile acid efflux, along with an effect on the ITIM residue Tyr488. This study is complicated based on three issues. The first is that transfections were performed in heterologous cells, not in hepatocytes, the most active transporters of bile acids. Subsequently, BSEP, NTCP, and OSTα/β were shown to perform these functions in the liver (22Dawson P.A. Lan T. Rao A. Bile acid transporters.J. Lipid Res. 2009; 50: 2340-2357Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar) and not CEACAM1. Second, the claimed ecto-ATPase activity of CEACAM1 in BCs (23Sippel C.J. McCollum M.J. Perlmutter D.H. Bile acid transport by the rat liver canalicular bile acid transport/ecto-ATPase protein is dependent on ATP but not on its own ecto-ATPase activity.J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2820-2826Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was later shown to be due to NTPDase8 (24Bigonnesse F. Levesque S.A. Kukulski F. Lecka J. Robson S.C. Fernandes M.J. Sevigny J. Cloning and characterization of mouse nucleoside triphosphate diphosphohydrolase-8.Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 5511-5519Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), not CEACAM1. The third was the demonstration that Ser503 was phosphorylated by PKC since it was stimulated by forskolin and inhibited by staurosporine (21Sippel C.J. Fallon R.J. Perlmutter D.H. Bile acid efflux mediated by the rat liver canalicular bile acid transport/ecto-ATPase protein requires serine 503 phosphorylation and is regulated by tyrosine 488 phosphorylation.J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19539-19545Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), is unlikely in the case of human CEACAM1. While the amino sequence of rat CEACAM1-LF, preceding the critical Ser503 residue, indeed conforms to a PKC consensus sequence in rat (25Rust H.L. Thompson P.R. Kinase consensus sequences: A breeding ground for crosstalk.ACS Chem. Biol. 2011; 6: 881-892Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), the critical basic residues are absent in humans (Fig. 1). In consideration of alternative kinases, the downstream sequences following the conserved Ser503 in rat and mouse or Ser508 in man conform to a GSK3β consensus sequence including the requirement for the priming phosphorylation site +4Ser (26Sutherland C. What are the bona fide GSK3 substrates?.Int. J. Alzheimers Dis. 2011; 2011: 505607Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar, 27Frame S. Cohen P. Biondi R.M. A common phosphate binding site explains the unique substrate specificity of GSK3 and its inactivation by phosphorylation.Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 1321-1327Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (555) Google Scholar), conserved in 15/16 mammalian species sequenced (28Kammerer R. Zimmermann W. Coevolution of activating and inhibitory receptors within mammalian carcinoembryonic antigen families.BMC Biol. 2010; 8: 12Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). In our companion paper, we showed that when the cytoplasmic domain of CEACAM1-LF was phosphorylated on Ser512 by PKA, Ser508 became a substrate for GSK3β. Thus, it is likely that, in the course of evolution, the signaling kinases for CEACAM1 have changed along with the amino acid sequences among species. These observations, as well as the many studies that show important differences between rodents and humans in hepatic lipid storage and obesity (29Laber S. Cox R.D. Mouse models of human GWAS hits for obesity and diabetes in the post genomic era: Time for reevaluation.Front. Endocrinol. (Lausanne). 2017; 8: 11Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar) led us to examine CEACAM1-LF signaling in a human hepatocyte model in which the human CEACAM1 gene is highly expressed, similar to the liver (30Su R.C. Lad A. Breidenbach J.D. Blomquist T.M. Gunning W.T. Dube P. Kleinhenz A.L. Malhotra D. Haller S.T. Kennedy D.J.

We hypothesized that phosphorylation of Ser508, similar to the murine equivalent Ser503, regulated phosphorylation of tyrosines in the proximal and/or distal ITIMs. We further hypothesized that subsequent recruitment of SHP2 by the phosphorylated ITIMs would depend on which ITIM was phosphorylated. To evaluate our hypotheses, we selected HepG2 cells that highly express CEACAM1 (31Kiriyama S. Yokoyama S. Ueno M. Hayami S. Ieda J. Yamamoto N. Yamaguchi S. Mitani Y. Nakamura Y. Tani M. Mishra L.

Eskelinen S. Lehto V.P. Bile canaliculus formation in cultured HEPG2 cells.Lab. Invest. 1993; 68: 652-662PubMed Google Scholar). We knocked out CEACAM1 by a Crispr/Cas9 approach and compared the phenotype to the parental cells, as well as the CEACAM1−/− cell lines transfected with null and phosphorylation mimics of Ser508, and null mutants of the ITIMs. Given the importance of lipid storage dysregulation in the liver, we used lipid droplet formation with an emphasis on the role of the fatty acid (FA) transporter CD36 as a phenotypic readout for these cell lines. The distribution of energy-rich fatty acids throughout the body is mediated by endothelial lipoprotein lipase that hydrolyzes triacyl glycerides (TAGs) of postprandial circulating chylomicrons and VLDL (34Olivecrona G. Role of lipoprotein lipase in lipid metabolism.Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 2016; 27: 233-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). The released FAs, especially the long-chain FAs, are transported into the heart, skeletal muscle, and hepatocytes primarily by the widely distributed and highly regulated CD36 receptor (35Pepino M.Y. Kuda O. Samovski D. Abumrad N.A. Structure-function of CD36 and importance of fatty acid signal transduction in fat metabolism.Annu. Rev. Nutr. 2014; 34: 281-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). Upon binding its many ligands, CD36 is phosphorylated by the Src kinase Fyn in the muscle (36Huang M.M. Bolen J.B. Barnwell J.W. Shattil S.J. Brugge J.S. Membrane glycoprotein IV (CD36) is physically associated with the Fyn, Lyn, and Yes protein-tyrosine kinases in human platelets.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 7844-7848Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar) and platelets (37Chabowski A. Gorski J. Luiken J.J. Glatz J.F. Bonen A. Evidence for concerted action of FAT/CD36 and FABPpm to increase fatty acid transport across the plasma membrane.Prostaglandins Leukot. Essent. Fatty Acids. 2007; 77: 345-353Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Notably, CEACAM1-LF is also phosphorylated by Src kinases resulting in activation of its ITIMs (7Gray-Owen S.D. Blumberg R.S. CEACAM1: Contact-dependent control of immunity.Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2006; 6: 433-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). Similar to CEACAM1-LF, CD36 plays a prominent role in hepatic insulin resistance and hepatosteatosis (38Miquilena-Colina M.E. Lima-Cabello E. Sanchez-Campos S. Garcia-Mediavilla M.V. Fernandez-Bermejo M. Lozano-Rodriguez T. Vargas-Castrillon J. Buque X. Ochoa B. Aspichueta P. Gonzalez-Gallego J. Garcia-Monzon C. Hepatic fatty acid translocase CD36 upregulation is associated with insulin resistance, hyperinsulinaemia and increased steatosis in non-alcoholic steatohepatitis and chronic hepatitis C.Gut. 2011; 60: 1394-1402Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). Since transport of FAs (as opposed to inflammatory oxidized lipids) to tissues is an essential function, it is perhaps surprising that CD36 is often associated with inflammation (39Silverstein R.L. Febbraio M. CD36, a scavenger receptor involved in immunity, metabolism, angiogenesis, and behavior.Sci. Signal. 2009; 2re3Crossref PubMed Scopus (662) Google Scholar) and steatosis (40Wilson C.G. Tran J.L. Erion D.M. Vera N.B. Febbraio M. Weiss E.J. Hepatocyte-specific disruption of CD36 attenuates fatty liver and improves insulin sensitivity in HFD-fed mice.Endocrinology. 2016; 157: 570-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). We hypothesized that CEACAM1-LF and CD36 are biochemically connected in hepatocytes, since the absence of CEACAM1 is involved in inflammation and hepatosteatosis, and its liver levels are reduced in obesity (41Heinrich G. Muturi H.T. Rezaei K. Al-Share Q.Y. DeAngelis A.M. Bowman T.A. Ghadieh H.E. Ghanem S.S. Zhang D. Garofalo R.S. Yin L. Najjar S.M. Reduced hepatic carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion molecule 1 level in obesity.Front. Endocrinol. (Lausanne). 2017; 8: 54Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Furthermore, genetic studies implicate CD36 in obesity (42Love-Gregory L. Abumrad N.A. CD36 genetics and the metabolic complications of obesity.Curr. Opin. Clin. Nutr. Metab. Care. 2011; 14: 527-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) and regulation of bile acid levels (43Shibao C.A. Celedonio J.E. Tamboli R. Sidani R. Love-Gregory L. Pietka T. Xiong Y. Wei Y. Abumrad N.N. Abumrad N.A. Flynn C.R. CD36 modulates fasting and preabsorptive hormone and bile acid levels.J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 2018; 103: 1856-1866Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). A recent study has linked CD36 protein levels in HepG2 cells to proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9), in which CD36 directly associates with PCSK9 and is degraded by it in the proteasome (44Demers A. Samami S. Lauzier B. Des Rosiers C. Ngo Sock E.T. Ong H. Mayer G. PCSK9 induces CD36 degradation and affects long-chain fatty acid uptake and triglyceride metabolism in adipocytes and in mouse liver.Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2015; 35: 2517-2525Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). These data further connect CD36 to lipid storage since PCSK9 also regulates the levels of LDL receptor, a key lipid import receptor in the liver (45Lagace T.A. PCSK9 and LDLR degradation: Regulatory mechanisms in circulation and in cells.Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 2014; 25: 387-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). In addition, CD36 has been shown to form a complex with AMPK and LKB1, and in the presence of FAs, leads to the activation of AMPK (46Samovski D. Sun J. Pietka T. Gross R.W. Eckel R.H. Su X. Stahl P.D. Abumrad N.A. Regulation of AMPK activation by CD36 links fatty acid uptake to beta-oxidation.Diabetes. 2015; 64: 353-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Based on these observations, we also investigated the effect of CEACAM1 signaling on the expression of CD36 and its associated signaling proteins LKB1, Src, PCSK9, and AMPK. As stated above, HepG2 cells express high levels of CEACAM1-LF and form BC under ordinary culture conditions, two key features of human hepatocytes. CEACAM1 was genetically deleted from these cells by a CRISPR/Cas9 approach. Among the 30 sgRNAs tested, three directed at exon 4 gave surveyor nuclease treated DNA that showed fragmentation of the 806 kb exon 4 PCR fragment into smaller fragments (Fig. 2, A and B). Transfection of sgRNA 4.1 into HepG2 cells and FACS selection led to a CEACAM1−/− cell line lacking CEACAM1 expression (Fig. 2C). Ser-508 in the cytoplasmic domain of CEACAM1-LF was mutated to either Ala (S508A, kinase null mutation) or Asp (S508D, phosphorylation mimic), as well as the Tyr null mutants Y493F and Y520F (Fig. 2D) were generated and transfected into the CEACAM1−/− cell line. Immunoblot analysis of WT HepG2 cells shows high expression of human CEACAM1 compared with another reference line, Huh7, and absence of its expression in the genetically deleted line (Fig. 2E). Expression of the transfected mutants into the CEACAM1−/− line compared with the WT cell line is shown in Figure 2F. The relative lower level expression of the mutants Y493F and Y520F is a reproducible phenotype for these mutants. Insulin treatment had little effect on the expression of the CEACAM1-LF mutants, an expected result in which expression is driven by a β-actin promoter. When the cell lines were stained for lipid droplets with the fluorescent dye Vala, the trend was CEACAM1−/− = S508D = Y520F > WT > S508A > Y493F (Fig. 3, A–F). Quantitation of the fluorescent staining (Fig. 3G) reveals a 60% increase in lipid staining in CEACAM1−/− versus WT and an even greater increase in the S508D and Y520F mutants, 80% and 78%, respectively. The Y493F mutant had a 50% decrease in lipid droplet staining compared with WT cells, suggesting that abrogation of tyrosine phosphorylation at this site has a profound effect on lipid droplet storage. When a number of lipid droplets (LDs) per cell were analyzed according to large LDs (≥1 μm) versus small LDs (<1 μm) (Table 1 and Fig. S1), the lowest numbers of LDs were for WT = S508A or Y493F and highest number of LDs for CEACAM1−/− = S508D or Y520F.Table 1Lipid droplet sizes and number per cell for CEACAM1 WT, KO, and mutant HepG2 cell linesaCells were triple stained with Vala (lipid), DAPI (nuclei) and phalloidin (cell membrane). Lipid droplets (Vala) counted per cell (DAPI) were scored as ≥ or <1 μm and averaged for 50 cells. Repeat counts (three fields) were used to determine the standard deviations.

Open table in a new tab Immunostaining for CEACAM1 and F-actin (phalloidin) for BCs (Fig. 3, H–M) of WT cells demonstrated a predominant localization of BCs at the junctions of three cells (Fig. 3H). A similar F-actin staining pattern was seen for CEACAM1−/− and WT cells, indicating that genetic ablation of CEACAM1 did not affect BC formation (Fig. 3H versus Fig. 3I). In the case of the S508A mutant, BCs were enlarged with enhanced staining for CEACAM1 (Fig. 3J); however, BCs in the S508D mutant were of similar size to those in the WT cells (Fig. 3, H and K). The BC staining pattern for the tyrosine mutants (Fig. 3, L and M) revealed that the Y520F mutant was similar to WT cells and the S508D mutant, while the Y493F mutant was similar to the S508A mutant. Comparison of the lipid staining of the cell lines in Figure 3, A–F to the BC staining in Figure 3, H–M indicates a relationship between lipid content and BC size, indicating that the lower lipid content of the S508A mutant is associated with the increased size of the BCs. LC/MS was used to determine if lipid composition was affected in the cell lines. The results were normalized to POPC, the most abundant phospholipid. The most abundant TAGs (e.g., 16:0, 18:1, 18:1) were similar in all four cell lines (data not shown). In order to compare the effects of the CEACAM1−/− and mutant cells versus WT cells, the results were reported as a ratio to WT (Table 2). Notably, 19 out of the 20 top upregulated lipids in the CEACAM1−/− cells compared with the WT cells were TAGs, whereas only five of the top 20 downregulated lipids were TAGs. Only six of the top 20 upregulated lipids in the S508A mutant were TAGs, while 15 of the top 20 upregulated lipids in the S508D mutant were TAGs. Thus, the S508D mutant most closely resembles the CEACAM1−/− cell line in lipid composition. In terms of the constituent FAs of the TAGs, 14/20 of the upregulated TAGs for the CEACAM1−/− versus WT analysis had exclusively unsaturated FAs at all three positions, while only 3/20 had one unsaturated FAs in their TAGs. On the other hand, the five downregulated TAGs for the CEACAM1−/− versus WT had only saturated FAs. Strikingly, 22:5 and 22:6 polyunsaturated FAs (PUFAs) predominated in the upregulated TAGs. Docosapentaenoic acid (22:5) and docosahexaenoic acid (22:6) are important omega-6 PUFAs that are precursors to prostaglandins and leukotrienes, important in the inflammatory response. Non-TAG lipids upregulated in the S508A mutant were phospholipids, suggesting that these are the lipids destined for efflux via enlarged BCs, since phospholipids, not TAGs, are a common component of bile (47Muraca M. Vilei M.T. Miconi L. Petrin P. Antoniutti M. Pedrazzoli S. A simple method for the determination of lipid composition of human bile.J.

In qualitative evidence synthesis (QES), the rationale, triggers, and methods for updating are less clear cut. We updated a QES on adherence to anti-retroviral treatment to examine if thematic saturation renders additional research redundant.We adopted the original review search strategy and eligibility criteria to identify studies in the subsequent three years. We assessed studies for conceptual detail, categorised as 'rich' or 'sparse', coding the rich studies. We sought new codes, and appraised whether findings confirmed, extended, enriched, or refuted existing themes. Finally, we examined if the analysis impacted on the original conceptual model.After screening 3895 articles, 301 studies met the inclusion criteria. Rich findings from Africa were available in 82 studies; 146 studies were sparse, contained no additional information on specific populations, and did not contribute to the analysis. New studies enriched our understanding on the relationship between external and internal factors influencing adherence, confirming, extending and enriching the existing themes. Despite careful evaluation of the new literature, we did not identify any new themes, and found no studies that refuted our theory.Updating an existing QES using the original question confirmed and sometimes enriched evidence within themes but made little or no substantive difference to the theory and overall findings of the original review. We propose this illustrates thematic saturation. We propose a thoughtful approach before embarking on a QES update, and our work underlines the importance of QES priority areas where further primary research may help, and areas where further studies may be redundant."
https://openalex.org/W3205410957,"Traffic police riders are exposed to prolonged static postures causing significant angular deviation of the musculoskeletal, including the lumbar angle (L1-L5). This postural alteration contributes to awkward posture, musculoskeletal disorders and spinal injury, especially in the lower back area, as it is one of the most severe modern diseases nowadays. Thus, the study aimed to evaluate the effect of lumbar support with a built-in massager system on spinal angle profiles among traffic police riders. A randomised controlled trial (pre-testpost-test control design) was used to assess spinal angle pattern while riding the high-powered motorcycle for 20 minutes. Twenty-four traffic police riders were randomly selected to participate and 12 riders were assigned to the control group and 12 riders to the experimental group. The pre-test and post-test were conducted at a one-week interval. Each participant was required to wear a TruPosture Smart Shirt (to monitor spinal posture). The TruPosture Apps recorded the spinal angle pattern. The data indicated that the police riders using motorcycle seat with lumbar support and built-in massager system showed a huge improvement in maintaining posture which only involves slight spinal angle deviation changes from the spinal reference angle throughout the 20 minutes ride. The data collected then were analysed using the Mann-Whitney test and Wilcoxon signed-ranked test to verify a statistically significant difference between and within the control and experimental groups. There were significant differences in all sensors between the control group and experimental groups (p&lt;0.05) and within the experimental group. According to the findings, it can be said that the ergonomic intervention prototype (lumbar support with built-in massager system) successfully helps to maintain and improve the natural curve of the spinal posture. This indirectly would reduce the risk of developing musculoskeletal disorders and spinal injury among traffic police riders."
https://openalex.org/W3206121704,"Primary hyperlipidaemia in Schnauzer is characterized by increased plasma triglycerides (TG) and/or total cholesterol (TC) concentration and is associated with an increased risk of developing pancreatitis, insulin resistance and seizures. In humans, omega-3 fatty acids in addition to a low-fat diet can be used to reduce TG and TC. This study evaluated the therapeutic efficacy of omega-3 fatty acids associated to a diet management with two different fat content in Schnauzer with primary hyperlipidaemia. Eighteen dogs with primary hyperlipidaemia were divided into two groups: group 1, n = 10, 8 females, 2 males, age (mean ± standard deviation) of 7.13 ± 2.70 years and body weight (BW) (mean ± standard deviation) of 7.25 ± 1.22 kg were treated with fish oil (approximately 730 mg/day of omega-3) associated with a low-fat and low-calorie diet (approximately 24g of fat/1000 kcal) for 90 days (T90); and group 2, n = 8 dogs, 6 females, 2 males, with 7.0 ± 1.77 years old and average BW of 8.36 ± 1.51 kg, treated with fish oil (approximately 730 mg/day of omega-3) and maintenance diet with moderate amount of fat (approximately 33g of fat/1000 kcal) for 90 days. Plasma TG and TC concentrations and lipoprotein (LP) profile (VLDL, LDL, HDL) were evaluated before and after treatment. TG and TC serum concentrations, expressed in mg/dL (mean ± standard deviation), before and after treatment in group 1 were: TG = 391.30 ± 487.86 (T0) and 118.7 ± 135.21 (T90); TC = 308.2 ± 63.06 (T0) and 139 ± 36.91 (T90). As for group 2, TG = 391.63 ± 336.89 (T0) and 250.75 ± 211.56 (T90); TC = 257.25 ± 92.88 (T0) and 207.25 ± 63.79 (T90). A reduction (p<0.05) of TG and TC was observed in both groups. The distribution of TG and TC among LP was not different between the pre (T0) and post treatment (T90) periods. After 90 days of treatment, the administration of omega-3 fatty acids, associated with a low-fat or maintenance diet reduced triglyceridemia and cholesterolemia without altering LP profile. The current investigation shows that both therapies were effective in reducing plasma TC and TG concentrations without altering LP profile."
https://openalex.org/W3206154016,"Interval training (IT) results in improved fatigue resistance in skeletal muscle mainly due to an increased aerobic capacity, which involves increased muscle mitochondrial content and/or improved mitochondrial function. We hypothesized that IT with high-intensity contractions is more effective in increasing mitochondrial function, and hence fatigue resistance, than low-intensity contractions. To study this hypothesis without interference from differences in muscle fiber recruitment obliged to occur during voluntary contractions, IT was performed with in situ supramaximal electrical stimulation where all muscle fibers are recruited. We compared the effect of IT with repeated low-intensity (20 Hz stimulation, IT20) and high-intensity (100 Hz stimulation, IT100) contractions on fatigue resistance and mitochondrial content and function in mouse plantar flexor muscles. Muscles were stimulated every other day for 4 weeks. The averaged peak torque during IT bouts was 4.2-fold higher with IT100 than with IT20. Both stimulation protocols markedly improved in situ fatigue resistance, although the improvement was larger with IT100. The citrate synthase activity, a biomarker of mitochondrial content, was similarly increased with IT20 and IT100. Conversely, increased expression of mitochondrial respiratory chain (MRC) complexes I, III, and IV was only observed with IT100 and this was accompanied by increases in MRC supercomplex formation and pyruvate-malate-driven state 3 respiration in isolated mitochondria. In conclusion, the IT-induced increase in fatigue resistance is larger with high-intensity than with low-intensity contractions and this is linked to improved mitochondrial function due to increased expression of MRC complexes and assembly of MRC supercomplexes."

Investigating the spatial relationship of capital factor agglomeration is a key way to accelerate the upgrading of urban industrial structure and realize sustainable development. Based on the panel data of 284 cities in China from 2008 to 2017, we use the theoretical framework of spatial econometrics and estimate the spatial effects of capital factor agglomeration on the upgrading of urban industrial structure. Both the global Moran index and the local Moran scatter chart present that the agglomeration of capital factors and the upgrading index of urban industrial structure shows the characteristics of spatial agglomeration. The results reveal that the agglomeration of capital factors can significantly promote the upgrading of the industrial structure of local and surrounding cities. Still, the spatial spillover effect is not significant. We then explore the possible factors that limit the spatial spillover effects of capital agglomeration. Using the results of the paper, we provide policy suggestions for strengthening urban industrial construction and optimizing the urban governance model."

We used qualitative procedures in sampling, data collection and data analysis. Our data collection instrument was the semi-structured interview and we applied thematic content analysis to establish stakeholder evaluations of the RRBM model. The study population included10 experts working within key organizations and teachers from two schools. The organizations were sampled as providers, implementers and designers of interventions while schools were sampled as providers and consumers of interventions. Individual study participants were recruited purposively through snowball sampling. Results showed consensus among participants on the acceptability, potential for scale up and likelihood of model sustainability if implemented. In essence areas to consider improving and modifying included: focus on the rural girl child and inclusion of an economic empowerment component to target the underlying root causes of HIV risk taking behavior. Stakeholders also recommended intervention extension to out of school adolescent groups as well as involvement of traditional leaders. Involvement of parents and religious leaders in intervention scale up was also highlighted. The study serves as a benchmark for stakeholder involvement in model and intervention evaluation and as a link between researchers and project implementers, designers as well as policy makers to bridge the research to policy and practice gap."

We enrolled 336 participants (men 124; women 212; mean age 72.2 years) from a medical checkup program. LSS was diagnosed using a self-administered questionnaire, and lumbar symptoms were evaluated using the visual analog scale (low back pain, and pain and numbness of the lower limb). QOL related to low back pain was evaluated using the Japanese Orthopedic Association Back-Pain Evaluation Questionnaire (JOABPEQ: pain, and lumbar, and gait function). Radiological lumbar degeneration was classified using Kellgren-Lawrence grading and lateral radiographs of the lumbar spine. Cognitive function was measured using the Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE), and MCI was defined by a summary score of MMSE ≤27. Logistic and multiple linear regression analyses were performed to analyze the association between MCI, summary score of MMSE, and lumbar degenerative disease. The comorbidity rate of MCI and LSS was 2.1%, and the rate of MCI was 41% in participants with LSS. Lumbar function in JOABPEQ was associated with MCI. The presence of LSS and lumbar function in JOABPEQ were associated with MMSE. Over one-third of the people with LSS had MCI. The presence of LSS and deterioration of QOL due to low back pain were related to cognitive impairment. We recommend evaluating cognitive function for patients with LSS because the rate of MCI was high in LSS participants."

CT datasets prior to craniectomy and after cranioplasty were subtracted to quantify the volume and localization of the defect.Out of 91 patients, 21 had suitable datasets. Five cases had good cosmetic results with no defect visible, 16 patients had an apparent hollowing defect. Their average defect volume was 5.0 cm3 ± 4.5 cm3. The defect localizations were in the area behind the zygomatic process and just below the superior temporal line, covering an area of app. 3x3 cm2. Surgical attempts of temporal muscle restoration were more often found in reports of good results (p<0.01), but also in 50% of reports, whose surgeries resulted in hollowing of the temple. Mean time between the two surgeries was 112 ± 43 days. No significant differences between patients with and without hollowing defect were detected regarding time between the two surgeries, age or performing surgeon.This work supplies evidence for the indication of a surgical corrective during cranioplasty in the small but cosmetically relevant area of the ""frontozygomatic shadow"". Based on our 3D data analysis, future focused surgical strategies may obtain better aesthetical results here."

However, experience of CPAP application in pregnant women with acute respiratory failure (ARF) due to SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia is scarce. This study aimed to describe the natural history and outcome of ARF in a cohort of pregnant women with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia, focusing on the feasibility of helmet CPAP (h-CPAP) application and the variables related to ARF worsening. A retrospective, observational study enrolling 41 consecutive pregnant women hospitalised for SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia in a tertiary care center between March 2020 and March 2021. h-CPAP was applied if arterial partial pressure of oxygen to fraction of inspired oxygen ratio (PaO2/FiO2) was inferior to 200 and/or patients had respiratory distress despite adequate oxygen supplementation. Characteristics of patients requiring h-CPAP vs those in room air or oxygen only were compared. Twenty-seven (66%) patients showed hypoxemic ARF requiring oxygen supplementation and h-CPAP was needed in 10 cases (24%). PaO2/FiO2 was significantly improved during h-CPAP application. The device was well-tolerated in all cases with no adverse events. Higher serum C reactive protein and more extensive (≥3 lobes) involvement at chest X-ray upon admission were observed in the h-CPAP group. Assessment of temporal distribution of cases showed a substantially increased rate of CPAP requirement during the third pandemic wave (January-March 2021). In conclusion, h-CPAP was feasible, safe, well-tolerated and improved oxygenation in pregnant women with moderate-to-severe ARF due to SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia. Moderate-to-severe ARF was more frequently observed during the third pandemic wave."
https://openalex.org/W3206808054,"To determine whether age-related macular degeneration (AMD) severity or the frequency of retinal pigment epithelium mitochondrial DNA lesions differ in human donor eyes that have undergone cataract surgery compared to phakic eyes.Eyes from human donors aged ≥ 55 years were obtained from the Minnesota Lions Eye Bank. Cataract surgery status was obtained from history provided to Eye Bank personnel by family members at the time of tissue procurement. Donor eyes were graded for AMD severity using the Minnesota Grading System. Quantitative PCR was performed on DNA isolated from macular punches of retinal pigment epithelium to quantitate the frequency of mitochondrial DNA lesions in the donor tissue. Univariable and multivariable analyses were performed to evaluate for associations between (1) cataract surgery and AMD severity and (2) cataract surgery and mitochondrial DNA lesion frequency.A total of 157 subjects qualified for study inclusion. Multivariable analysis with age, sex, smoking status, and cataract surgery status showed that only age was associated with AMD grade. Multivariable analysis with age, sex, smoking status, and cataract surgery status showed that none of these factors were associated with retinal pigment epithelium mitochondrial DNA lesion frequency.In this study of human donor eyes, neither retinal pigment epithelium mitochondrial DNA damage nor the stage of AMD severity are independently associated with cataract surgery after adjusting for other AMD risk factors. These new pathologic and molecular findings provide evidence against a relationship between cataract surgery and AMD progression and support the idea that cataract surgery is safe in the setting of AMD."

This study aimed to evaluate the effects of cyproheptadine hydrochloride on growth parameters in prepubertal children with FTT. The medical records of prepubertal children who were newly diagnosed with FTT at China Medical University Hospital between 2007 and 2016 were retrospectively examined. The patients were divided into two groups depending on whether they had (T-group) or had not (NT-group) received cyproheptadine hydrochloride (0.3 mg/kg daily) for at least 14 days. The mean length of the treatment period was 97.22 days (range: 14-532 days). Weight, height, and body mass index were adjusted for age using the median values in the growth charts for Taiwanese boys and girls as the reference. A total of 788 patients aged 3-11 years were enrolled, 50 in the T-group and 738 in the NT-group. No statistically significant difference in the median age-adjusted weight value was noted between the T-group and NT-group during the follow up period. In the T-group, age-adjusted weight and body mass index were inversely associated with age (P <0.001, P <0.001) and positively associated with medication duration (P = 0.026, P = 0.04). Our findings underscore the positive association between cyproheptadine hydrochloride treatment and weight gain among prepubertal children. Further prospective clinical studies with a. longer and consistent treatment course is warranted."
