Previous studies have shown that the RNA helicase activity of eIF4A is dependent on the presence of a second initiation factor, eIF4B. In this report, eIF4A has been demonstrated to function independently of eIF4B as an ATP-dependent RNA helicase. The biochemical and kinetic properties of this activity were examined. By using a family of RNA duplexes with an unstructured single-stranded region followed by a duplex region of increasing length and stability, it was observed that the initial rate of duplex unwinding decreased with increasing stability of the duplex. Furthermore, the maximum amount of duplex unwound also decreased with increasing stability. Results suggest that eIF4A acts in a non-processive manner. eIF4B and eIF4H were shown to stimulate the helicase activity of eIF4A, allowing eIF4A to unwind longer, more stable duplexes with both an increase in initial rate and maximum amount of duplex unwound. A simple kinetic model is proposed to explain the mechanism by which eIF4A unwinds RNA duplex structures in an ATP-dependent manner."
https://openalex.org/W2115746022,"The p53 tumor suppressor protein is a transcription factor that plays a key role in the process of apoptosis and the cell's defense against tumor development. Activation of p53 occurs, at least in part, by phosphorylation of its protein. Very recently it has been reported that UV induced a functional activation of p53 via phosphorylation at serine 389. Here, we report that the UV-induced phosphorylation of p53 at serine 389 is mediated by p38 kinase. UVC-induced phosphorylation of p53 at serine 389 was markedly impaired by either pretreatment of cells with p38 kinase inhibitor, SB202190, or stable expression of a dominant negative mutant of p38 kinase. In contrast, there was no inhibition observed in cells treated with specific MEK1 inhibitor, PD98059, or with stable expression of a dominant negative mutant of ERK2 or JNK1. Most importantly, p38 kinase could be co-immunoprecipitated with p53 by using antibodies against p53. Incubation of active p38 kinase with p53 protein caused the phosphorylation of p53 protein at serine 389 in vitro, while no phosphorylation of p53 at serine 389 was observed when p53 was incubated with activated JNK2 or ERK2. Furthermore, pretreatment of cells with SB202190 blocked the p53 DNA binding activity and p53-dependent transcription. These results strongly suggest that the p38 kinase is at least one of the most important mediators of p53 phosphorylation at serine 389 induced by UVC radiation.

The p53 tumor suppressor protein is a transcription factor that enhances the transcriptional rate of several known genes, which play a critical role in transducing a signal from damaged DNA to specific cellular response (1Levine A.J.

At the N terminus is a transcriptional activation domain (amino acids 1–43) and within the central part of p53 is the sequence-specific DNA-binding domain (amino acids 100–300) (8Hupp T.R. Meek D.W.

These domains of p53 were defined in terms of separable activities that contribute to its overall functions.

In addition to these conditions, growing evidence indicates that the ability of p53 to inhibit diverse regulatory functions is also likely to depend on its phosphorylation, which is conformation-dependent (7Adler V.

It was found that phosphorylation of murine p53 protein at serine 389 (or homolog serine 392 of the human p53 protein) caused the enhancement of p53 DNA binding activityin vitro (28Hupp T.R. Lane D.P. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1994; 59: 195-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Very recently, two different research groups reported that UV radiation induced the phosphorylation of p53 at serine 389 and that this phosphorylation is important for p53-mediated transcriptional activation in vivo (29Lu H. Taya Y. Ikeda M. Levine A.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6399-6402Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 30Kapoor M. Lozano G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

A. 1998; 95: 2834-2837Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar) found that CKII could phosphorylate the p53 at serine 389 in vitro. Here, we demonstrated that UVC-induced p53 phosphorylation at serine 389 is mediated by p38 kinase by using a dominant negative mutant of p38 kinase and the p38 kinase inhibitor, SB202190, both in vitro and in vivo. Activated p38 kinase and active JNK2 were from Upstate Biotechnology; activated ERK2, Elk-1 fusion protein, c-Jun fusion protein, phospho-specific c-Jun (Ser63) antibody, phospho-specific Elk-1 antibody (Ser383), p38 kinase antibody, phospho-specific p38 kinase (Tyr182) antibody, phospho-specific p53 (Ser389) antibody, and p38 kinase assay kit were purchased from New England Biolabs; monoclonal mouse IgG against p53 antibody (Ab1) was from Oncogene Research Products; MEK1 specific inhibitor, PD98059, was from Biomol; p38 kinase inhibitor, SB202190, was from Calbiochem; dominant negative mutant of p38 kinase was a generous gift from Dr. Mercedes Rincon, Department of Medicine, University of Vermont, Burlington, VT (31Rincon M.

JB6 mouse epidermal cell line Cl 41 and its stable transfectants, Cl 41 CMV-neu, Cl 41 DN-p38 G7, Cl 41 DN-JNK1 mass1, Cl 41 MAPK-DN B3 mass1, and Cl 41 p53 were cultured in monolayers at 37 °C and 5% CO2 using Eagle's MEM containing 5% FBS, 2 mm l-glutamine, 25 μg/ml gentamicin (18Huang C.

The level of p53 phosphorylation at serine 389 induced by UVC radiation and the complex of p53 with p38 kinase was measured by Western blot for immunoprecipitation using specific antibodies against p53. Briefly, JB6 Cl 41 cells or its transfectants were cultured in 100-mm dishes with 5% FBS MEM until they reached 80% confluence. Then, the cells were starved by culturing them in 0.1% FBS MEM for 48 h. The cells were exposed to UVC irradiation for induction of p53 phosphorylation at serine 389. The cells were lysed on ice for 1 h in the lysis buffer and spun at 14,000 rpm for 5 min. The lysates were immunoprecipitated using p53 antibodies (Ab1) and protein G plus protein A-agarose. The bands were washed, and the phosphorylated protein of p53 at serine 389 and the p38 kinase, as well as phosphorylated p38 kinase, were selectively measured by Western immunoblotting using a specific antibody and chemiluminescent detection system. JB6 Cl 41 cells were cultured in a six-well plate until they reached 85–90% confluence. We used 1 μg of CMV-neo vector with or without 12 μg of plasmid DNA of dominant negative mutant of p38 kinase and 15 μl of LipofectAMINE reagent to transfect each well in the absence of serum. After 10–12 h, the medium was replaced by 5% FBS MEM. Approximately 30–36 h after the beginning of the transfection, the cells were digested with 0.033% trypsin, and cell suspensions were plated into 75-ml culture flasks and cultured for 24–28 days with G418 selection (300 μg/ml). Stable transfectants were identified by using p38 kinase activity assay kit. Stable transfected Cl 41 CMV-neu and Cl 41 DN-p38 G7 were established and cultured in G418-free MEM for at least two passages before each experiment. p38 kinase assay was carried out as described by the protocol of New England Biolabs. In brief, JB6 Cl 41 CMV-neu or Cl 40 DN-p38 G7 cells were starved for 48 h in 0.1% FBS MEM at 37 °C, 5% CO2 atmosphere incubator. The cells were washed once with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and were exposed to UVC (50 KJ/m2) for 30 min. Then, the cells were washed once with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in 300 μl of lysis buffer per sample (20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1% Triton, 2.5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mmβ-glycerolphosphate, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mg/ml leupeptin). The lysates were sonicated and centrifuged and the supernatant incubated with a specific p38 kinase antibody with gentle rocking for 4–10 h at 4 °C and then the protein A-Sepharose beads were added in the incubation for another 4 h. The beads were washed twice with 500 ml of lysis buffer with phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and twice with 500 μl of kinase buffer (25 mmTris, pH 7.5, 5 mm β-glycerolphosphate, 2 mmDTT, 0.1 mm Na3VO4, 10 mm MgCl2). The kinase reactions were carried out in the presence of 100 μm ATP and 2 μg of ATF-2 at 30 °C for 30 min. ATF-2 phosphorylation is selectively measured by Western immunoblotting using a chemiluminescent detection system and specific antibodies against phosphorylation of ATF-2 at Thr71. Phosphorylation of p53, c-Jun, or Elk-1 by activated ERK2, JNK2, or p38 kinase were carried out at 30 °C for 60 min in the presence of kinase buffer (25 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 5 mm β-glycerolphosphate, 2 mm DTT, 0.1 mm Na3VO4, 10 mm MgCl2) with 200 μm ATP and p53, c-Jun, or Elk-1 as substrate. The phosphorylation proteins were detected by Western immunoblotting using phospho-specific antibodies. The p53 DNA-protein binding assay was carried out according to methods described previously (37Sun Y. Bian J. Wang Y. Jacobs C. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 385-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The synthetic oligonucleotide of p53-binding consensus sequence (WAF-1: 5′-GAACATGTCCCAACATGTTG-3′ or GADD45: 5′-GAACATGTCTAAGCATGCTG-3′) was annealed and labeled with32P using T4 polynucleotide kinase and [γ-32P]ATP. Nuclear extracts were prepared from confluent Cl 41 cells treated with various concentrations of SB202190 for 1 h, then exposed to UVC (60 J/m2) and cultured for 18 h. Cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in cold lysis buffer (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.8, 50 mm KCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 20 μg/ml aprotinin, and 100 μm DTT) for 5 min. After washing once with the lysis buffer without Nonidet P-40, the pellet was resuspended in cold extraction buffer (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.8, 500 mm KCl, 10% glycerol, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 20 μg/ml aprotinin, and 100 μm DTT) and incubated on ice for 20 min with frequent mixing followed by spinning at 14,000 rpm for 5 min. The supernatant was then saved as the nuclear extract. Protein concentrations were determined using the Bio-Rad Protein Assay Kit. A DNA-binding reaction mixture of 24 μl contained 20 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 4% Ficoll-400, 2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm DTT, 1 μg of poly(dI/dC), 32P-labeled oligonucleotide (20,000 cpm) was incubated with 6 μg of protein-containing nuclear extract. To determine the binding specificity, 100 × excess of cold oligonucleotide was included in some reactions. The mixture was incubated at room temperature for 45 min and then loaded onto a 3.5% polyacrylamide gel. The gel was run in 0.5 × Tris borate-EDTA buffer at 160 V, dried, and scanned. p53-dependent transcription activity was assayed by using a Cl 41 cell line stably expressing a luciferase reporter gene, which was controlled by p53 DNA binding sequences (18Huang C.

Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 4102-4106PubMed Google Scholar) were trypsinized and 8 × 103 viable cells suspended in 100 μl of 5% FBS MEM were added into each well of a 96-well plate. Plates were incubated at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2. Twelve to 24 h later, cells were starved by culturing them in 0.1% FBS MEM for 12 h. The cells were treated with different concentrations of SB202190 for 1 h, then exposed to UVC (60 J/m2) for p53 induction and cultured for 24 h. The cells were extracted with lysis buffer, and luciferase activity was measured using a luminometer (Monolight 2010). The results are expressed as relative p53 activity (18Huang C. Ma W.-Y. Li J. Hecht S.S. Dong Z. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 4102-4106PubMed Google Scholar). P53 activity is regulated by multisite phosphorylation (7Adler V. Pincus M.R. Minamoto T. Fuchs S.Y. Bluth M.J.

To investigate the signal transduction pathways leading to phosphorylation of p53 at serine 389 in UV response, we first measured the UVC-induced phosphorylation of p53 at serine 389 in a mouse JB6 epidermal cell line, Cl 41. Previous studies indicated that Cl 41 cells contain high levels of wild-type p53 protein that could activate the p53-dependent transcription in UV response (18Huang C. Ma W.-Y. Li J. Hecht S.S. Dong Z. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 4102-4106PubMed Google Scholar, 36Sun Y. Nakamura K. Hegamyer G. Dong Z. Colburn N. Mol. Carcinog. 1993; 8: 49-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 37Sun Y.

Cl 41 cells were exposed to UVC radiation; the p53 protein in the cell lysate was immunoprecipitated with specific antibodies against p53 (Ab1). The levels of p53 phosphorylation were analyzed by Western blotting using phospho-specific antibody against p53 at serine 389. The results show that UVC radiation caused phosphorylation of p53 at serine 389 (Fig. 1). This phosphorylation was observed at 30 and 90 min after UVC exposure (Fig. 1 A). The dose response study indicated that 60 J/m2 UVC is the optimal dosage for induction of p53 phosphorylation at serine 389 (Fig.1 B). These results are in agreement with previous findings that UV radiation leads to increased phosphorylation of p53 at serine 389 (29Lu H. Taya Y. Ikeda M. Levine A.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6399-6402Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 30Kapoor M. Lozano G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2834-2837Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). UV radiation leads to activation of MAP kinase superfamily, comprising ERKs, JNKs, and p38 kinase (39Kyriakis J.M. Banerjee P. Nikolakaki E. Dai T. Rubie E.A. Ahmed M.F. Avruch J. Woodgett J.R.

Oncogene. 1997; 15: 2277-2287Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Since the UV radiation also leads to increased phosphorylation of p53 at serine 389, we investigated the possible role of MAP kinase family in this process. To test this possibility, we first examined the influence of specific chemical inhibitors on UVC-induced phosphorylation of p53 at serine 389. The results are shown in Fig.2. UVC-induced phosphorylation of p53 at serine 389 was completely impaired by pretreatment of cells with 1–2 μm SB202190, a specific inhibitor for p38 kinase, while 25–100 μm PD98059, which showed marked inhibition of UV-induced activation of MEK1 and ERKs (data not shown), did not show any inhibition of p53 phosphorylation at serine 389 (Fig. 2). These data suggest that p38 kinase may be involved in p53 phosphorylation at serine 389 in UVC response. To directly investigate the role of p38 kinase in UVC-induced phosphorylation of p53 at serine 389, we established a stable transfectant with a dominant negative mutant of p38 kinase (31Rincon M. Enslen H. Raingeaud J. Recht M. Zapton T. Su M.S.-S. Penix L.A. Davis R.J. Flavell R.A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2817-2829Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar,32Raingeaud J. Gupta S. Roger J.

The dominant negative mutant of p38 kinase was generated by replacing Thr180 and Tyr182 by Ala and Phe, respectively (31Rincon M. Enslen H. Raingeaud J. Recht M. Zapton T. Su M.S.-S. Penix L.A.

Cl 41 cells were transfected with dominant negative mutant of p38 kinase and selected with G418 as described under “Experimental Procedures.” G418-resistant transfectants were analyzed for the expression of dominant negative mutant by assay for UVC-induced p38 kinase activity. The results showed that expression of dominant negative mutant of p38 kinase specifically blocked UVC-induced p38 kinase activity (Fig. 3), while it did not inhibit the activation of ERKs and JNKs (data not shown). The expression of dominant negative mutant of p38 kinase markedly blocked p53 phosphorylation at serine 389 in UVC response (Fig.4 A). In contrast, overexpression of dominant negative ERK2 or JNK1 did not show significant inhibition of p53 phosphorylation at serine 389 (Fig. 4,B and C). The time course and dose response studies further indicated that p38 kinase appears to be the mediator of p53 phosphorylation at serine 389 in UVC response (Fig.5).Figure 4Blocking p53 phosphorylation at serine 389 by dominant negative mutant of p38 kinase. Cl 41 cell stable transfectants (as indicated) were seeded in 100-mm dishes and cultured until 90% confluent. The cells were starved by changing the 0.1% FBS MEM for 36–48 h.

Then, the cells were exposed to UVC at the dosage indicated and cultured for 30 min (A) or UVC (60 J/m2) (B) and cultured for the time period indicated. The cells were harvested, and phosphorylation levels of p53 were measured as described under “Experimental Procedures.”View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Because the above data revealed the important role of p38 kinase in the signaling pathway leading to phosphorylation of p53 at serine 389, we explored whether a direct interaction might exist between p38 kinase and p53. We exposed the Cl 41 cells to UVC radiation for the different times and incubated the cell extract with specific monoclonal antibodies against p53 and protein G plus protein A-agarose. The beads were washed extensively to eliminate nonspecific binding. The bead-coupled proteins were eluted with SDS sample buffer and measured by Western blot using specific antibodies against phosphorylation of p53 at serine 389 and phosphorylation of p38 kinase at threonine 182 or nonphosphorylated p38 kinase. We found that the p38 kinase binding to p53 was detected in the immunoprecipitation complex (Fig.6). Furthermore, the kinetics of p53 phosphorylation at serine 389 were well correlated with that of p38 kinase phosphorylation at threonine 182 after UVC exposure (Fig. 6). Very interestingly, the total p38 kinase in all the immunoprecipitation samples was almost the same (Fig. 6). These data suggested that nonphosphorylated p38 kinase could bind to p53, and the phosphorylated p38 kinase may be responsible for p53 phosphorylation. The above data strongly suggest that p38 kinase is the possible direct mediator of UVC-induced p53 phosphorylation at serine 389. If this is the case, the active p38 kinase should phosphorylate p53 at serine 389 in vitro. To test this, we incubated partially purified p53 protein with one of activated MAP kinase family in the presence of 200 μmATP. The phosphorylation level of p53 was detected by Western blot using specific antibodies. The results are shown in Fig.7. The p53 proteins were phosphorylated by active p38 kinase (Fig. 7 A), but not by active ERK2 or JNK2 (Fig. 7, B and C), while active ERK2 and JNK2 show their ability to phosphorylate Elk-1 or c-Jun, respectively (Fig. 7, B and C). Because the p53 used in this study consists of the purified baculovirus-expressed proteins that are a mixture of phosphorylated and unphosphorylated p53 at serine 389, a relatively high basal level of phosphorylation of p53 at serine 389 in the control group is probably due to a mixture of phosphorylated and unphosphorylated p53 at serine 389 in this baculovirus-expressed protein. These data, taken together with other results from this study, strongly suggest that p38 kinase is the direct mediator of UV-induced phosphorylation of p53 at serine 389. To investigate the functional requirement of p38 kinase mediating the phosphorylation of p53 at serine 389 in UV response, we determined the inhibitory effect of SB202190, a p38 kinase inhibitor, on p53-dependent transcription activity and DNA binding activity. The results showed that UVC-induced p53-dependent transcription activity and DNA binding activity could be blocked by pretreatment of cells with SB202190 (Fig.8). This band was shown to be compatible by the unlabeled p53 binding oligonucleotides and was not detectable in p53 −/− cells derived from p53 knockout mouse (Fig. 8, Aand B, and data not shown). This result suggests that phosphorylation of p53 at serine 389 is functionally required for p53-dependent transcription. DNA damage-induced activation of the p53 tumor suppressor is suggested to be central in cellular damage response pathways. One of the major roles of p53 in normal cells is to trigger cell cycle arrest or apoptosis in response to DNA damage by acting as a sequence-specific transcription factor that activated genes involved in control of cell cycle and apoptosis (20Martinez J.D. Craven M.T. Joseloff E. Milezarek G. Bowden G.T. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 2511-2520Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Mutations in the p53 gene have been found in over half of all human cancers (20Martinez J.D. Craven M.T. Joseloff E. Milezarek G. Bowden G.T. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 2511-2520Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Loss of p53 suppressor function, by mutation, is a universal step in the development of human cancer (42Hollstein M. Sidransky D. Vogelstein B. Harris C.C. Science. 1991; 253: 49-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (7461) Google Scholar). For these reasons, it was very interesting to investigate the signal transduction pathways leading to p53 phosphorylation and activation. UV radiation has been shown previously to induce p53 phosphorylation at serine 389. The critical kinase that mediates this UV-responsive phosphorylation is, however, not well documented. In this study, we determined the role of p38 kinase in UVC-induced p53 phosphorylation at serine-389. Exposure of Cl 41 cells to UVC radiation leads to activation of p38 kinase and the phosphorylation of p53 at serine 389 in Cl 41 cells. Pretreatment of cells with SB202190, a p38 kinase inhibitor, or expressing of dominant negative mutant of p38 kinase, impaired the phosphorylation of p53 at serine 389 and p53-dependent transactivation and DNA binding activity in UVC response. Most importantly, we found that p38 kinase was present in the immunoprecipitation proteins from a cell extract using specific antibodies against p53, and active p38 kinase was shown to phosphorylate the p53 protein at serine 389 in vitro. All these data demonstrated that p38 kinase plays a critical role in UVC-induced phosphorylation of p53 protein at serine 389, suggesting that there is a functional requirement of p38 kinase for UV-induced p53 activation. Exposure of cells to UV irradiation elicits a complex set of acute cellular responses called “UV responses.” Generally, UV responses serve to protect the cells. The initial signal triggering the UV response is in large part independent of DNA damage, but rather appears to be mediated by a membrane-associated component of the Ras pathway with activation of MAPKs (39Kyriakis J.M.

Chem. 1996; 271: 31262-31268Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). However, others argue that even UV-induced activation of MAPKs may have a DNA damage signal component (45Adler V. Fuchs S.Y. Kim J. Kraft A. King M.P. Pelling J. Ronai Z. Cell Growth Differ. 1995; 6: 1437-1446PubMed Google Scholar). Very recently, Bender et al. (46Bender K. Gottlicher M. Whiteside S. Rahmsdorf H.J. Herrlich P. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5170-5181Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar) reported that UV-induced activation of NFκB is through DNA damage-dependent and -independent pathways. In the case of p53, activating signals clearly involve both DNA damage signals and other nongenotoxic stresses (47Hartwell L.H. Kastan M.B. Science. 1994; 266: 1821-1828Crossref PubMed Scopus (2312) Google Scholar). It is accepted that p53 function is regulated at the levels of its transcription, translocation, protein turnover, cellular compartmentalization, stabilization, and association with other proteins, as well as phosphorylation (19Meek D.W. Campbell L.E. Jardine L.J. Knippschild U. McKendrick L. Milne M. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1997; 25: 416-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). p53 has multiple sites for phosphorylation in both N- and C-terminal domains, and p53 phosphorylation has been found to be mediated by several cellular kinases, including CKI, CKII, PKA, CDK7, ERKs, and JNKs (7Adler V.

Oncogene. 1997; 15: 2277-2287Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Among these protein kinases, those that are expected to produce stress-activated phosphorylation of p53 are JNKs and DNA-activated protein kinase, which reportedly phosphorylates residues of p53 within the N-terminal domain of p53 (19Meek D.W.

Ikeda M. Taya Y. Prives C. Cell. 1997; 91: 325-334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1755) Google Scholar). This phosphorylation was identified as one of the major sites on p53 in cellular stress response and contributed to p53 accumulation (48Shieh S.Y. Ikeda M. Taya Y. Prives C. Cell. 1997; 91: 325-334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1755) Google Scholar). JNKs phosphorylate the murine p53 at serine 34 (19Meek D.W. Campbell L.E. Jardine L.J. Knippschild U.

Pincus M.R. Minamoto T. Fuchs S.Y. Bluth M.J. Brandt-Rauf P.W. Friedman F.K. Robinson R.C. Chen J.M. Wang X.W. Harris C.C. Ronai Z. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

It was also reported that the DNA binding function of p53 is activated by phosphorylation of the C-terminal serine by purified CKII in vitro (28Hupp T.R. Lane D.P. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1994; 59: 195-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). The studies from two different groups indicated that UV radiation results in functional activation of p53 through phosphorylation of p53 protein at serine 389 (29Lu H. Taya Y. Ikeda M. Levine A.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6399-6402Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 30Kapoor M. Lozano G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2834-2837Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar) and that p53 could be phosphorylated at serine 389 by CKII in vitro (30Kapoor M. Lozano G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2834-2837Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). In this study, we found that inhibition of p38 kinase by either chemical p38 kinase inhibitor SB202190, or the biological inhibitor, dominant negative mutant of p38 kinase, results in blocking phosphorylation of p53 at serine 389 in UV radiation. Pretreatment of cells with SB202190 also impaired the UV-induced p53-dependent transcription and DNA binding activity. Most importantly, the p38 kinase not only phosphorylates the p53 at serine 389 both in vitro and in vivo, but also is present in the immunoprecipitation proteins from cell lysate using specific antibodies against p53. Furthermore, the phosphorylation at serine 389 is well correlated with the phosphorylation of p38 kinase, which is considered essential for activation of p38 kinase, in the time course studied. Taken together, our results provide evidence, bothin vitro and in vivo, that p38 kinase is a mediator of p53 phosphorylation at serine 389 in UVC response, and p38 kinase is functionally required for UV-induced p53-dependent transcription. We thank Dr. Mercedes Rincon for providing us with the dominant negative mutant of p38 kinase, Dr. H. H. O. Schmid for critical reading of the manuscript, and Carmen Hotson for secretarial assistance."

Furthermore, our results suggest that Group V sPLA2 expression is dependent upon the activation of Group IV cPLA2.DISCUSSIONA striking hallmark of the immunoinflammatory response is the generation of oxygenated derivatives of AA such as the prostaglandins. The response of major prostaglandin-secreting cells such as macrophages and mast cells to proinflammatory stimuli is generally biphasic (4Murakami M. Nakatani Y. Atsumi G. Inoue K. Kudo I. Crit. Rev. Immunol. 1997; 17: 225-284Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The first phase is completed within minutes after the addition of the stimulus, whereas the second phase usually takes several hours (4Murakami M. Nakatani Y. Atsumi G. Inoue K. Kudo I. Crit. Rev. Immunol. 1997; 17: 225-284Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Using the murine macrophage-like cell line P388D1, we have been studying the molecular mechanisms responsible for AA mobilization and prostaglandin production in response to LPS/PAF. When primed by LPS, these cells will respond to Ca2+-mobilizing stimuli such as PAF by generating a rapid burst of free AA, part of which is converted to prostaglandins such as PGE2. Strikingly, this process is completed within a few minutes after the addition of PAF (19Balsinde J. Barbour S.E. Bianco I.D. Dennis E.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 11060-11064Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). No free AA or prostaglandins are produced after the immediate phase is completed, not even after several hours of cell exposure to LPS/PAF (13Glaser K.B. Asmis R. Dennis E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 8658-8664Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Such a behavior, which is abnormal for a macrophage cell, has prevented us from studying the molecular mechanisms responsible for delayed prostaglandin production in macrophages. In an attempt to overcome this problem, we subcloned the P388D1 cells by limit dilution, and selecting on the basis of high responsivity to LPS/PAF, we obtained a clone termed MAB, which shows enhanced sensitivity to LPS/PAF in the immediate phase (min) and exhibits a delayed response (h) to LPS alone.Using the MAB clone, we have characterized the LPS-induced delayed prostaglandin production in terms of the role played by distinct PLA2 enzymes and their coupling with downstream COX enzymes during LPS signaling. Our previous work on the immediate response of the cells to LPS/PAF highlighted the very important role played by the novel Group V sPLA2 as the provider of most of the free AA directed to PGE2 biosynthesis (11Balboa M.A. Balsinde J. Winstead M.V. Tischfield J.A. Dennis E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32381-32384Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Herein, several lines of evidence suggest that Group V sPLA2 also behaves as a major provider of AA for the delayed phase of PGE2production in LPS-treated cells. First, delayed [3H]AA release and PGE2 production correspond with the induction of Group V sPLA2 mRNA and enhanced secretion of a sPLA2-like activity to the supernatants, with no change in the constitutive levels of cPLA2 and no detectable induction of Group IIA sPLA2. Second, delayed PGE2 production is strongly blunted by LY311727, a selective sPLA2 inhibitor. Third, an antisense oligonucleotide specific for Group V sPLA2 (11Balboa M.A. Balsinde J. Winstead M.V. Tischfield J.A. Dennis E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32381-32384Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar) suppresses Group V sPLA2 activity and inhibits delayed PGE2 production. Our conclusions in this regard fully agree with recent works by Kudo and co-workers (20Murakami M. Shimbara S. Kambe T. Kuwata H. Winstead M.V. Tischfield J.A. Kudo I. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14411-14423Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar, 21Murakami M. Kambe T. Shimbara S. Kudo I. J. Biol.

By using transfection techniques, Kudo and co-workers (20Murakami M. Shimbara S. Kambe T. Kuwata H. Winstead M.V. Tischfield J.A. Kudo I. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14411-14423Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar, 21Murakami M. Kambe T. Shimbara S. Kudo I. J. Biol.

Thus the cPLA2 inhibitor MAFP (1Balsinde J. Dennis E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6758-6765Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar) markedly blocked both long term [3H]AA release and Group V sPLA2 mRNA induction. Collectively, these results suggest an intriguing cross-talk between the cPLA2 and the Group V sPLA2 for the delayed phase of prostaglandin production in macrophages. This is a very interesting concept because cross-talk appears to exist as well between these two enzymes during the immediate phase of prostaglandin production (1Balsinde J. Dennis E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6758-6765Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar, 2Balsinde J. Balboa M.A. Dennis E.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7951-7956Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). In the immediate phase, cPLA2 activation generates a rapid and early burst of free AA inside the cell that enables sPLA2activation by an as yet unidentified mechanism (1Balsinde J. Dennis E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6758-6765Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar, 2Balsinde J. Balboa M.A. Dennis E.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7951-7956Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). In the delayed phase, cPLA2 activation influences sPLA2apparently by regulating sPLA2 mRNA levels.Cross-talk between cPLA2 and sPLA2 in the immediate phase of prostaglandin production was also found to take place in mast cells (3Reddy S.T. Herschman H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3231-3237Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar) when the same protocol originally used in macrophages (1Balsinde J. Dennis E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6758-6765Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar) was employed. Furthermore, a recent study by Kuwataet al. (22Kuwata H. Nakatani Y. Murakami M. Kudo I. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1733-1740Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar) about fibroblasts suggests that cross-talk between cPLA2 and sPLA2 in the delayed phase could also constitute a general mechanism of activation. Using a different cPLA2 inhibitor, arachidonyl trifluoromethyl ketone, Kuwata et al. (22Kuwata H. Nakatani Y. Murakami M. Kudo I. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1733-1740Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar) found that cPLA2inhibition blocked sPLA2 expression in fibroblasts, leading to reduced PGE2 generation. The study by Kuwata et al. (22Kuwata H. Nakatani Y. Murakami M. Kudo I. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1733-1740Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar) is interesting not only because it supports the possible universality of cross-talk between cPLA2 and sPLA2 but because the sPLA2 expressed by rat fibroblasts is a Group IIA enzyme, not Group V. This lends further support to the emerging notion that Group IIA and Group V sPLA2 may be functionally redundant (23Tischfield J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17247-17250Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). In addition, Kuwata et al. (22Kuwata H. Nakatani Y. Murakami M. Kudo I. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1733-1740Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar) were able to show that overcoming cPLA2 inhibition by exogenous AA partially restored the Group IIA sPLA2 expression. These results suggest that the AA mobilized by cPLA2 is responsible for cross-talk between cPLA2 and sPLA2 (22Kuwata H. Nakatani Y. Murakami M. Kudo I. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1733-1740Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). This is again reminiscent of what happens in the immediate phase of activation, wherein the cPLA2-derived AA is also responsible for cross-talk between cPLA2 and sPLA2, albeit by different mechanisms (1Balsinde J. Dennis E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6758-6765Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar, 2Balsinde J. Balboa M.A. Dennis E.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7951-7956Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Unfortunately, inhibition by MAFP of Group V sPLA2expression and activity could not be reversed in our macrophage studies with LPS alone by supplementing the medium with exogenous AA (up to 100 μm). This was not unexpected because P388D1cells manifest an extraordinarily high capacity to import free AA from exogenous sources and incorporate it into membranes (19Balsinde J. Barbour S.E. Bianco I.D. Dennis E.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 11060-11064Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 24Balsinde J. Bianco I.D. Ackermann E.J. Conde-Frieboes K. Dennis E.A. Proc.

Biochem. 1996; 235: 480-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), which is much higher than that of most other cells (26Surette M.E. Chilton F.H. Biochem. J. 1998; 330: 915-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Thus, the half-life of the free AA in the cell would be too short to adequately mimic the low but continued production of AA-derived cPLA2 upon long term LPS exposure.A model has recently emerged suggesting differential actions of COX-1 and COX-2 by virtue of differential coupling to distinct PLA2s (2Balsinde J. Balboa M.A. Dennis E.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7951-7956Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 3Reddy S.T. Herschman H.R. J. Biol.

Chem. 1996; 271: 30041-30051Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Thus, depending on whether cPLA2 or sPLA2 is the provider of free AA, either COX-1 or COX-2 would be responsible for PGE2release. However, which PLA2 form couples to which COX isoform appears to depend strongly on cell type. We have recently demonstrated that the immediate, PAF receptor-mediated phase of PGE2 production in LPS-primed macrophages involves sPLA2 coupling to COX-2 (2Balsinde J. Balboa M.A. Dennis E.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7951-7956Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). The current results support a similar kind of coupling for the delayed PGE2 production in LPS-treated cells. Identical coupling has been suggested by Arm and co-workers (6Bingham III, C.O. Murakami M. Fujishima H. Hunt J.E. Austen K.F. Arm J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25936-25944Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) for the delayed phase of PGE2 generation in mast cells. These results raise another interesting concept regarding the regulation of PGE2 during both phases of activation. As is the case for AA release (Fig. 2 A), we have observed that the amount of PGE2 generated during the Ca2+-dependent short term stimulation is comparable to the amount produced in the late phase. It follows from this comparison that although the effector enzymes involved in the response are the same (i.e. cPLA2, sPLA2, COX-2), the regulatory mechanisms differ. Thus, in the short phase at low levels of COX-2, it appears that the dramatic burst in AA release is what determines the amount of PGE2produced. In contrast, in the delayed phase at comparably lower AA availability, it appears that both the induction of large amounts of COX-2 protein and of the AA provider, Group V sPLA2, determine the amount of PGE2 produced.It is important to note, however, that our results have not excluded that a minor fraction of the long term PGE2 produced in response to LPS could arise from the AA generated by the cPLA2. Should this be the case, some cPLA2/COX-2 coupling may exist as well, similar to what has been suggested by Reddy and Herschman (3Reddy S.T. Herschman H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3231-3237Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar) for delayed PGD2production in mast cells and by Murakami et al. (5Murakami M. Kuwata H. Amakasu Y. Shimbara S. Nakatani Y. Atsumi G. Kudo I. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19891-19897Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) in cells derived from Group IIA-deficient mice. The striking feature of the current work is that although COX-1 is present in active form in the P388D1 cells (2Balsinde J. Balboa M.A. Dennis E.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7951-7956Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar), it appears to be spared from the process of long term PGE2 production. This finding remains unexplained but has recently been recognized in other cell types as well (6Bingham III, C.O. Murakami M. Fujishima H. Hunt J.E. Austen K.F. Arm J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25936-25944Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 8Murakami M. Matsumoto R. Urade Y. Austen K.F. Arm J.P. J. Biol.

Chem. 1998; 273: 1733-1740Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Recent work by Spencer et al. (16Spencer A.G. Woods J.W. Arakawa T. Singer I.I. Smith W.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9886-9893Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar) showed no differences in the distribution of COX-1 versus COX-2 among subcellular fractions in a variety of cells. Thus subcellular compartmentalization may not be the cause for COX-1 not being utilized during LPS signaling. Other putative explanations may include the existence of COX-selective regulatory components, selective coupling to terminal PG synthases, or kinetic differences in AA utilization by the two isoforms.In summary, we have established a subclone of P388D1 cells, MAB, that displays long term responsiveness to LPS in terms of PGE2 generation. We have confirmed (11Balboa M.A. Balsinde J. Winstead M.V. Tischfield J.A. Dennis E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32381-32384Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar) that these cells express Group V sPLA2, not Group IIA sPLA2, and found that (i) Group V sPLA2 is a key enzyme in long term AA mobilization as well and (ii) Group V sPLA2 is functionally coupled to COX-2. Furthermore, our results have suggested that cPLA2 plays a key role in long term AA mobilization, at least partly by regulating the expression of Group V sPLA2.

The immediate phase, which takes minutes and is elicited by Ca2+-mobilizing agonists such as platelet-activating factor (PAF), is characterized by a burst of AA liberation. In some cells such as P388D1 macrophages (1Balsinde J. Dennis E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6758-6765Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar, 2Balsinde J.

Chem. 1997; 272: 3231-3237Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar), this burst is mainly produced by a secretory phospholipase A2 (sPLA2) but is strikingly regulated by the cytosolic Group IV phospholipase A2(cPLA2). The delayed phase of prostaglandin production is accompanied by the continuous supply of AA over long incubation periods spanning several hours. There is some discrepancy about the identity of the PLA2 isoform(s) involved in the delayed phase. Despite this phase being independent of a Ca2+ increase, the cPLA2 has often been suggested to be critically involved (3Reddy S.T. Herschman H.R. J. Biol.

https://openalex.org/W2048697340,"Activation of ADP-ribosylation factors (ARFs), ∼20-kDa guanine nucleotide-binding proteins that play an important role in intracellular vesicular trafficking, depends on guanine nucleotide-exchange proteins (GEPs), which accelerate replacement of bound GDP with GTP. Two major families of ARF GEPs are known: ∼200-kDa molecules that are inhibited by brefeldin A (BFA), a fungal metabolite that blocks protein secretion and causes apparent disintegration of Golgi structure, and ∼50-kDa GEPs that are insensitive to BFA. We describe here two human brain cDNAs that encode BFA-inhibited GEPs. One is a ∼209-kDa protein 99.5% identical in deduced amino acid sequence (1,849 residues) to a BFA-inhibited ARF GEP (p200) from bovine brain. The other smaller protein, which is ∼74% identical (1,785 amino acids), represents a previously unknown gene. We propose that the former, p200, be named BIG1 for (brefeldin A-inhibited GEP1) and the second, which encodes a ∼202-kDa protein, BIG2. A protein containing sequences found in BIG2 had been purified earlier from bovine brain. Human tissues contained a 7.5-kilobase BIG1 mRNA and a 9.4-kilobase BIG2 transcript. The BIG1 andBIG2 genes were localized, respectively, to chromosomes 8 and 20. BIG2, synthesized as a His6 fusion protein in Sf9 cells, accelerated guanosine 5′-3-O-(thio)triphosphate binding by recombinant ARF1, ARF5, and ARF6. It activated native ARF (mixture of ARF1 and ARF3) more effectively than it did any of the nonmyristoylated recombinant ARFs. BIG2 activity was inhibited by BFA in a concentration-dependent manner but not by B17, a structural analog without effects on Golgi function. Although several clones for ∼50-kDa BFA-insensitive ARF GEPs are known, these new clones for the ∼200-kDa BIG1 and BIG2 should facilitate characterization of this rather different family of proteins as well as the elucidation of mechanisms of regulation of BFA-sensitive ARF function in Golgi transport. Activation of ADP-ribosylation factors (ARFs), ∼20-kDa guanine nucleotide-binding proteins that play an important role in intracellular vesicular trafficking, depends on guanine nucleotide-exchange proteins (GEPs), which accelerate replacement of bound GDP with GTP. Two major families of ARF GEPs are known: ∼200-kDa molecules that are inhibited by brefeldin A (BFA), a fungal metabolite that blocks protein secretion and causes apparent disintegration of Golgi structure, and ∼50-kDa GEPs that are insensitive to BFA. We describe here two human brain cDNAs that encode BFA-inhibited GEPs. One is a ∼209-kDa protein 99.5% identical in deduced amino acid sequence (1,849 residues) to a BFA-inhibited ARF GEP (p200) from bovine brain. The other smaller protein, which is ∼74% identical (1,785 amino acids), represents a previously unknown gene. We propose that the former, p200, be named BIG1 for (brefeldin A-inhibited GEP1) and the second, which encodes a ∼202-kDa protein, BIG2.

ADP-ribosylation factors (ARFs) 1The abbreviations used are: ARF(s), ADP-ribosylation factor(s); GEP, guanine nucleotide-exchange protein; BFA, brefeldin A; GTPγS, guanosine 5′-3-O-(thio)triphosphate PCR, polymerase chain reaction; kb, kilobase(s); bp, base pair(s); AEBSF, 4-(2-aminoethyl)butylsulfonyl fluoride; PH domain, pleckstrin homology domainare ∼20-kDa guanine nucleotide-binding proteins, initially identified by their ability to enhance cholera toxin-catalyzed ADP-ribosylation of the GTP-binding protein Gαs (1Kahn R.A. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 6228-6234Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). ARFs are ubiquitous in eukaryotic cells from Giardia to human and are known to play an important role in intracellular vesicular trafficking (for review, see Ref. 2Moss J. Vaughan M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12327-12330Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar), as well as to activate phospholipase D (3Brown H.A. Gutowski S. Moomaw C.R. Slaughter C. Sternweis P.C.

Six mammalian ARFs, identified by cDNA cloning, are grouped into three classes based on size, amino acid sequence, phylogenetic analysis, and gene structure: ARFs 1–3 in class I, ARFs 4 and 5 in class II, and ARF6 in class III (5Tsuchiya M. Price S.R. Tsai S.-C. Moss J. Vaughan M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 2772-2777Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Welsh C.F. Moss J. Vaughan M. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1994; 138: 157-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Like other GTPases that regulate many kinds of intracellular processes, ARFs are active and associate with membranes when GTP is bound, whereas inactive ARF·GDP is cytosolic. Replacement of GDP by GTP is accelerated by ARF GEPs or guanine nucleotide-exchange proteins, several of which have been identified (7Moss J. Vaughan M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21431-21434Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). These include Gea1 and Gea2 from yeast (8Peyroche A. Paris S. Jackson C.L.

Sec7 was identified in a group of conditionally lethal yeast mutants as a gene involved in Golgi vesicular trafficking and secretion (14Achstetter T. Franzusoff A. Field C. Schekman R. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 11711-11717Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The Sec7 gene product is a ∼230-kDa phosphoprotein that moves between membrane and cytosolic fractions (15Franzusoff A. Schekman R. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 2695-2702Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Its Sec7 domain was demonstrated relatively recently to function as a brefeldin A (BFA)-inhibited ARF GEP (16Sata M. Donaldson J.G. Moss J. Vaughan M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 4204-4208Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). BFA is a fungal fatty acid metabolite with a monocyclic lactone ring that blocks protein secretion reversibly and causes apparent collapse of Golgi membranes into the endoplasmic reticulum (17Misumi Y. Misumi Y. Miki K. Takatsuki A. Tamura G. Ikehara Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 11398-11403Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Lippincott-Schwartz J. Yuan L.C. Bonifacino J.S. Klausner R.D. Cell. 1989; 10: 801-813Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (1315) Google Scholar). These effects result from BFA inhibition of GEP-catalyzed ARF activation (GTP binding) (19Donaldson J.G. Finazzi D. Klausner R.D. Nature. 1992; 360: 350-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (596) Google Scholar, 20Helms J.B. Rothman J.E. Nature. 1992; 360: 352-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (585) Google Scholar). The two major types of ARF GEPs differ in size and susceptibility to inhibition by BFA. Their Sec7 domains contain the determinants of GEP activity as well as its BFA sensitivity. The larger ∼200-kDa GEPs (e.g. Sec7, Gea1, and Gea2 from yeast) are inhibited by BFA, whereas those of the cytohesin family are BFA-insensitive, ∼50-kDa proteins. Morinaga et al. (21Morinaga N.

A. 1997; 94: 12926-12931Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) reported the purification and cloning of a BFA-inhibited ARF GEP from bovine brain, which was referred to as p200. We describe here the cloning from a human brain library of two GEP cDNAs. One, with a deduced amino acid sequence (1,849 residues) 99.5% identical to that of p200, probably represents the human form of p200. The other, encoding a 202-kDa protein 74% identical in sequence, is a new BFA-inhibited human GEP. We propose that because of their BFA sensitivity and size relative to the cytohesins, these mammalian ARF GEPs be named BIG1 (forBFA-inhibited GEP) and BIG2, respectively. [α-32P]dCTP, [γ-32P]dATP, and [35S]GTPγS were purchased from NEN Life Science Products. All restriction enzymes andTaq polymerase used to prepare BIG1-In and BIG2-In were purchased from Roche Molecular Biochemicals (formerly Boehringer Mannheim). Sources of other materials are noted below or have been reported (22Morinaga N. Moss J. Vaughan M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 12926-12931Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). All plasmids were purified using Qiagen Plasmid Midi kits (Qiagen, Chatsworth, CA). An Applied Biosystems Inc. 373 DNA sequenator was used for sequencing. 500 ng of plasmid DNA, 3.2 pmol of primer, and 8 μl of Terminator Ready Reaction Mix (Perkin-Elmer) were used for cycle sequencing (25 cycles of 96 °C for 30 s, 50 °C for 15 s, and 60 °C for 4 min) in total volume of 20 μl. Probes for screening a human frontal cortex λ-ZAP cDNA library (1.2 × 106 plaque-forming units) (Stratagene) were prepared by PCR with bovine BIG1 cDNA (22Morinaga N. Moss J. Vaughan M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 12926-12931Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) as template. Sequences were: nucleotides 306–762 (probe 1), 2086–2728 (probe 2), and 5207–5541 (probe 3). Prehybridization overnight at 42 °C in 10% dextran sulfate, 1% SDS, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 0.5 m NaCl, and 30% formamide was followed by hybridization with 50 ng of radiolabeled probe (2 × 105 cpm/ml) in 100 ml of the same buffer overnight at 42 °C. Filters were then washed with 2 × SSC and 0.1% SDS at room temperature for 10 min twice and 1 × SSC and 0.1% SDS at 50 °C for 10 min. Two positive plaques were obtained with probe 1. The first contained bases 1–2487 of the BIG2 coding region named BIG2-N. (Base numbers are relative to A of ATG, equal to 1.) The other contained bases 1–420 of BIG1 (named BIG1-N). One plaque obtained with probe 2 contained bases 1738–4657 of BIG1 (named BIG1-C), and one with probe 3 (BIG2-C) contained bases 3514–5860 of BIG2. The sequence between BIG2-N and BIG2-C was obtained by a nested PCR. Primers for the first PCR (30 cycles of 94 °C for 1 min, 50 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 2 min) were BIG2-N bases 2359–2385 (forward) and 3655–3631 in BIG2-C (reverse), with 1 μl of human adrenal gland QUICK-Clone cDNA (CLONTECH) as template (total volume 100 μl). A sample (10 μl) of this PCR mixture was used as template in a nested PCR (30 cycles of 94 °C for 1 min, 52 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 2 min) with forward primer In-F (bases 2374–2402) and reverse primer In-R (bases 3593–3570). The single 1.2-kb product was subcloned in pCR2.1 (Invitrogen) to produce BIG2-In. Sequencing of the individual fragments generated a composite BIG2. The sequence between bases 421 and 1737 in BIG1 was obtained by an analogous procedure. Primers for the first PCR (30 cycles of 94 °C for 1 min, 55 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 2 min) were bases 275–299 in BIG1-N (forward) and 1886–1860 in BIG1-C (reverse). A sample (2 μl) of this PCR product was used as template in a nested PCR (30 cycles of 94 °C for 1 min, 52 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 2 min) with bases 300–329 (forward) and 1836–1811 (reverse) as primers. The 1.5-kb product was subcloned in pCR2.1 (named BIG1-In). Sequence of the 3′-terminus of the BIG1 cDNA was obtained by a rapid amplification of cDNA ends procedure using 2.5 units ofPfu DNA polymerase (Stratagene) and a Marathon Ready cDNA kit (CLONTECH), which included the DNA template and two reverse primers with adapters (AP-1 and AP-2). Gene-specific primers in BIG1-C were bases 4468–4491 (G-1, forward) and bases 4587–4611 (G-2, forward). In the first PCR (total volume 50 μl), 1 μl of template with G-1 and AP-1 was used for 30 cycles of 94 °C for 1 min, 68 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 3 min. 1 μl of this PCR mixture was used as template in the second PCR (total volume 50 μl) with G-2 and AP-2 for 30 cycles of 94 °C for 1 min, 65 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 3 min. The PCR product, which was purified using a QIAEX II gel extraction kit (Qiagen), was subcloned in pCR-Blunt (Invitrogen) and sequenced. Sequences of these cDNAs yielded a composite BIG1 sequence. For insertion of BIG2 into the baculovirus transfer vector pAcHLT-C (Pharmingen), restriction sites for NdeI and NotI were introduced, respectively, before the initiation and after the termination codons of BIG2. To insert the NdeI site, the forward primer was 5′-CATATGTATGCAGGAGAGCCAGACCAAG-3′ including theNdeI site (italics) and BIG2 initiation codon (underlined) with reverse primer (bases 298–274) and 500 ng of BIG2-N as template in a PCR (100 μl) with 5 units of Taq polymerase for 30 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 65 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 30 s. The 305-bp PCR product was subcloned into pCR-2.1 vector. The DNA excised from the purified plasmid withHindIII (site in pCR 2.1 vector) and NheI (base 219 of BIG2) was ligated to BIG2-N, which had been digested with the same enzymes, and named BIG2-Nde-Nhe. To ligate BIG2-Nde-Nhe and BIG2-In, BIG2-In (bases 2374–3593) was the DNA template with primers In-F and In-R and 2.5 units of PfuDNA polymerase (total volume 100 μl) for the first PCR (30 cycles of 94 °C for 1 min, 65 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 3 min). The 1.2-kb product (1.2-kb PCR) was purified using a QIAEXII gel extraction kit and eluted in 40 μl of distilled water. 1 μl of 1.2-kb PCR product and 500 ng of BIG2-N were used as templates in the second PCR (30 cycles of 94 °C for 1 min, 65 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 4 min) with Pfu DNA polymerase, forward primer (bases 1826–1848), and reverse primer In-R (total volume 100 μl). The 1.7-kb PCR (bases 1836–3593), which was purified using a QIAEXII gel extraction kit, was subcloned into pCR-Blunt vector. The plasmid DNA was digested with AatII (base 1849 of BIG2) andSpeI (site in pCR-Blunt vector). The excised DNA and the BIG2-Nde-Nhe, which had been digested with AatII andXbaI, were ligated and subcloned (named BIG2-Nde-Xba). To insert an NotI site after the termination codon, primers were BIG2 bases 3516–3540 (forward) and 5′-GCGGCCG CTACCACACTGGTG-3′ (reverse), which has an NotI site (italics) and the termination codon of BIG2 (underlined), with Pfu DNA polymerase (2.5 units) and 500 ng of BIG2-C as template in a volume of 100 μl for 30 cycles of 94 °C for 1 min, 65 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 4 min. The 1.8-kb PCR product was purified using a QIAEXII Gel Extraction kit and subcloned into pCR-Blunt vector (named BIG2-Not). BIG2-C (500 ng) and 1 μl of 1.2-kb PCR were used as templates for PCR (30 cycles of 94 °C/1 min, 60 °C/1 min, 72 °C/4 min) with primers In-F and bases 4249–4222 (reverse) in a total volume of 100 μl to obtain bases 2374–4249 (1.9 kb). The 1.9-kb PCR product was subcloned into pCR-Blunt vector (named BIG2-Nsi-ClaI) based on subsequent digestion with Nsi and ClaI. A 1.7-kbp DNA excised from BIG2-Not with ClaI and NotI was ligated to BIG2-Nsi-ClaI, which had been digested with ClaI (base 3791) and NotI (named BIG2-Nsi-Not). To construct the full-length BIG2 DNA, the 2.4-kb DNA, excised from BIG2-Nsi-Not with NsiI (base 2986 of BIG2) andNotI, was ligated to BIG2-Nde-Xba which had been digested with NsiI and NotI. The subcloned plasmid DNA was named BIG2-Full. BIG2-Full, excised withNdeI and NotI, was ligated to the baculovirus transfer vector pAcHLT-C with the His6 sequence encoded at its NH2 terminus. A sample (2 μg) and 0.5 μg of BaculoGold DNA (Pharmingen) were mixed with 2 × 106Sf9 cells in 3 ml of TNM-FH Insect medium (Pharmingen). After incubation at 27 °C for 5 days, a sample (10 μl) of the cell supernatant (Sup 1) was added to 1 × 105 Sf9 cells in 3 ml of medium followed by incubation for 5 days at 27 °C before the supernatant was collected (Sup 2). Sf9 cells (2 × 107) were added to 1 ml of Sup 2 and 30 ml of TNM-FH. After 5 days at 27 °C, cells were harvested by centrifugation, suspended in 1 ml of ice-cold 10 mm sodium phosphate (pH 8.0) and 100 mm NaCl containing 8 μg of benzamidine hydrochloride, 0.5 mm AEBSF, 5 μg of phenanthroline, 5 μg of aprotinin, and 5 μg of leupeptin, placed on ice for 45 min, and finally lysed by freezing and thawing twice. Clear lysate was separated from cellular debris by centrifugation (20,000 ×g, 15 min). The lysate (1 ml) was mixed with 0.3 ml of nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid agarose (Qiagen). After 1 h at 4 °C, the affinity matrix was washed five times with 1-ml portions of 5 mm imidazole and 50 mm sodium phosphate (pH 8.0) in 300 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, and 0.5 mm AEBSF. Bound protein was eluted with 100 mmimidazole and 50 mm sodium phosphate (pH 6.0) in the same solution of 300 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, and 0.5 mm AEBSF. The eluted protein was dialyzed against 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm NaN3, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.25m sucrose, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm AEBSF, and 30 mm NaCl overnight at 4 °C. Prehybridization and hybridization with a human Multiple Tissue Northern (MTN) (CLONTECH) were carried out according to the manufacturer's instructions. For prehybridization, ExpressHyb solution (CLONTECH) was used at 60 °C for 30 min. DNA probes, a 382-bp PCR product representing bases 121–502, in the 3′-untranslated region of BIG2 and a 467-bp PCR product corresponding to bases 715–1181 in the coding region of BIG1 were labeled with [α-32P]dCTP using a random primed DNA labeling kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). After hybridization, membranes were washed at room temperature with 2 × SSC and 0.05% SDS for 30 min, 2 × SSC and 0.1% SDS at 50 °C for 20 min, and 1 × SSC and 0.1% SDS at 50 °C for 10 min. For hybridization with glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase mRNA, 20 pmol of oligonucleotide (ACACAAATTCGAAGCTAAATAAAGCCGAGAGCTGGTAGT) was labeled with [γ-32P]dATP using 10 units of polynucleotide kinase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). 1.5 × 107 cpm of this or other labeled probe was used in 10 ml of ExpressHyb solution. Membranes were washed at room temperature in 2 × SSC and 0.05% SDS for 40 min 2 × SSC and 0.1% SDS at 42 °C for 15 min. Autoradiography film was exposed overnight at −80 °C. The NIGMS human/rodent somatic cell hybrid panel 2, version 3, containing DNA samples from human IMR-91 cells (NAIMR91), Chinese hamster RJK88 cells, and mouse 3T6 cells, was purchased from the Corielle Institute for Medical Research.Taq DNA polymerase (5 units) was used to prepare all DNA probes for chromosomal localizations. To construct the BIG1 probe, PCR R-1 was carried out with 2 μl of human/rodent hybrid cell genomic DNA as template, the forward primer 5′-CATTTACATCCCTCTGCTCTTT-3′ (which starts 24 bp downstream of the termination codon), and reverse primer 5′-TTTCTTCTTCTCTCCCCACTCC-3′ (which starts 425 bp downstream of the termination codon) for 30 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 55 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 30 s (total volume 20 μl). An intron from BIG2 was amplified from 200 ng of human genomic DNA (CLONTECH), with forward primer CL2-A (bases 2359–2385) and reverse primer (bases 2591–2568), in a volume of 100 μl for 30 cycles of 94 °C for 1 min, 65 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 2 min. The single PCR product was sequenced to verify the presence of the 622-bp intron at position 2533 in the coding region and ligated into pCR2.1. Human/rodent hybrid cell genomic DNA (2 μl) was used as template in PCR R-2 (total volume 20 μl) with forward primer CL2-A and reverse primer 5′-ACTCCTAAATCCTCCCAACC-3′ (bases 533–514 of the intron) for 30 cycles of 94 °C for 1 min, 55 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 1 min. GEP stimulation of [35S]GTPγS binding to ARF was assayed using a rapid filtration procedure. Partially purified ARF (predominantly ARFs 1 and 3) was prepared from bovine brain cytosol (21Morinaga N. Tsai S.-C. Moss J. Vaughan M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 12856-12860Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Assays, which were incubated for 20 min at 25 °C, contained 4 μm[35S]GTPγS (5 × 106 cpm), 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 1 mm dithiothreitol, 3 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 50 μg of bovine serum albumin, and 10 μg of phosphatidylserine with ARF substrate and GEP preparation as indicated (final volume, 50 μl). Assays were terminated by transfer to nitrocellulose filters (Millipore Corp.) followed by six washes, each with 2 ml of ice-cold buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 100 mmNaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA, and 3 mm MgCl2. Filters were dissolved in scintillation fluid for radioassay. Data presented are means ± S.E. of values from triplicate determinations. BIG2 was initially purified as part of a macromolecular complex of ∼670 kDa from bovine brain. After separation of complex components by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, proteins of ∼200 (p200) and 190 kDa exhibited BFA-inhibited ARF GEP activity (22Morinaga N. Moss J. Vaughan M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 12926-12931Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Sequences of peptides from p200 were used as the basis for cloning the bovine cDNA for BIG1. Cloning of human BIG1 and BIG2 cDNAs is described under “Experimental Procedures.” The cDNA for human BIG2 encodes a protein of 1,785 amino acids with a calculated molecular weight of 202,000. Both human and bovine BIG1 are somewhat larger with 1,849 amino acids and molecular weights of 209,000. Sequences of nine peptides produced by tryptic digestion of the p190 that had been purified from bovine brain (22Morinaga N. Moss J. Vaughan M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 12926-12931Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) are included in the deduced amino acid sequence of BIG2 (TableI). Seven are identical. In peptide 2 (19 amino acids), a phenylalanine in the human clone is tyrosine in the bovine, and in peptide 8 (9 amino acids), an alanine in the bovine sequence is proline in the human.

BIG2, which is overall 74% identical to human BIG1, is 90% identical in the 190 amino acids of the Sec7 domain (Fig.2). The BIG2 Sec7 domain is only ∼50% identical to the Sec7 domains of the BFA-insensitive cytohesins B2-1, ARNO, and GRP1 (which are themselves 85–90% identical), slightly less so to those from yeast Sec7 and EMB30, and only 34% identical to the Sec7 sequence from yeast Gea1 (Table II). Outside of the Sec7 domain, BIG1 and BIG2 have other large regions of >70% identity, much greater overall similarity than, for example, to the yeast Sec7 itself (Fig. 3).Figure 2Alignment of deduced amino acid sequences of Sec7 domains of ARF GEPs.

https://openalex.org/W2330189712,"Abundance and activity of p53 are predominantly regulated posttranslationally. Structural disturbance in transcribed genes induced by radiation, e.g. DNA damage, or by transcriptional inhibitors cause p53 protein stabilization by a yet unknown mechanism. Using stable and transient transfections for the analysis of p53 mutant proteins, we have ruled out a role in stabilization by UV, gamma irradiation or actinomycin C for the following putative phosphorylation sites in the p53 protein: serines 6, 9, 15, 33, 315 and 392, and threonine 18. By double mutation combinations of phosphorylations were also ruled out; 6,9; 15,18; 15,37. These mutations eliminate modifications by casein kinases I and II, DNA-PK, ATM, CDK and JNK. Also the 30 carboxyterminal amino acids are not required for induced p53 stabilization. Thus neither phosphorylations of individual amino acids nor interactions of the carboxyterminus of p53 with cellular macromolecules appear to play a role in the stabilization process. The only single prerequisite for induced stabilization of p53 is its prior destabilization by Mdm2. However, the level of active Mdm2 must be controlled carefully: overexpression of Mdm2 inhibits UV induced p53 stabilization."
https://openalex.org/W2081562689,"The functional role of the γ subunit of the Na,K-ATPase was studied using rat γ cDNA-transfected HEK-293 cells and an antiserum (γC33) specific for γ. Although the sequence for γ was verified and shown to be larger (7237 Da) than first reported, it still comprises a single initiator methionine despite the expression of a γC33-reactive doublet on immunoblots. Kinetic analysis of the enzyme of transfected compared with control cells and of γC33-treated kidney pumps shows that γ regulates the apparent affinity for ATP. Thus, γ-transfected cells have a decreasedK′ATP as shown in measurements of (i)K′ATP of Na,K-ATPase activity and (ii) K+ inhibition of Na-ATPase at 1 μm ATP. Consistent with the behavior of γ-transfected cells, γC33 pretreatment increases K′ATP of the kidney enzyme and K+ inhibition (1 μm ATP) of both kidney and γ-transfected cells. These results are consistent with previous findings that an antiserum raised against the pig γ subunit stabilizes the E 2(K) form of the enzyme (Therien, A. G., Goldshleger, R., Karlish, S. J., and Blostein, R. (1997) J. Biol. Chem. 272, 32628–32634). Overall, our data demonstrate that γ is a tissue (kidney)-specific regulator of the Na,K-ATPase that can increase the apparent affinity of the enzyme for ATP in a manner that is reversible by anti-γ antiserum.

Overall, our data demonstrate that γ is a tissue (kidney)-specific regulator of the Na,K-ATPase that can increase the apparent affinity of the enzyme for ATP in a manner that is reversible by anti-γ antiserum. The Na,K-ATPase is the sodium pump protein responsible for maintaining the electrochemical gradient present across the membranes of most animal cells (1Glynn I.M. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1993; 462: 1-30Crossref Scopus (119) Google Scholar). It consists of at least two subunits, α and β, each of which exists as one of several isoforms (α1, α2, α3, and α4 and β1, β2, and β3; for review, see Ref. 2Blanco G. Mercer R.W. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 44: F633-F650Google Scholar). The α subunit, also known as the catalytic subunit, contains the binding sites for the enzyme's nucleotide and cation substrates, as well as the catalytic and regulatory (calcium-dependent and cAMP-dependent protein kinase C and A, respectively) phosphorylation sites. The role of the β subunit is less clear, but it is required for normal processing and expression of the enzyme and may have a role in regulating the interaction of cations with the α subunit (3Chow D.C. Forte J.G. J. Exp. Biol. 1995; 198: 1-17Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The different isoforms of the pump are expressed in a tissue- and development-specific fashion and are believed to be distinct in both function and modes of regulation (2Blanco G. Mercer R.W. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 44: F633-F650Google Scholar). A small single-transmembrane protein called the γ subunit was originally believed to be a third subunit of the pump. It was discovered by Forbush et al. (4Forbush III, B. Kaplan J.H. Hoffman J.F. Biochemistry. 1978; 17: 3667-3676Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar) in 1978 and later cloned in rat, mouse, cow, sheep (5Mercer R.W.

Although its function has remained elusive, experiments in Xenopus oocytes have shown that the γ subunit alters the K+ affinity of the pump in a voltage- and Na+-dependent fashion (7Béguin P. Wang X. Firsov D. Puoti A. Claeys D. Horisberger J.-D. Geering K. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4250-4260Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar) and may induce cation channel activity (11Minor N.T. Sha Q. Nichols C.G. Mercer R.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6521-6525Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Our recent Western blot analysis using an anti-γ antiserum indicated that γ protein is detected only in the kidney medulla but not in other tissues tested (red blood cells, heart, brain, and kidney glomerulus) including cultured cell lines derived from cells of the kidney tubule. We showed that the antibodies bound to the cytoplasmic tail of γ and stabilized theE 2 form of the enzyme, presumably by disrupting α-γ interactions (12Therien A.G. Goldshleger R. Karlish S.J.D. Blostein R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32628-32634Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). In this report we show that expression of γ in cells devoid of this protein results in a significant increase in apparent affinity for ATP and that the γ-transfected cells resemble the α1β1γ kidney enzyme in that this effect is abrogated by antiserum raised against a 10-residue peptide of the C terminus of the γ subunit. γC33 is a rabbit polyclonal antiserum raised against a peptide representing the C-terminal 10 amino acids of the γ subunit. In the experiments reported herein, γC33 was used, and a control nonimmune serum was obtained from the same rabbit prior to immunization. The peptide, KHRQVNEDEL, was synthesized at the Alberta Peptide Institute, University of Alberta, and used either as the free peptide for competition studies or linked to keyhole limpet hemocyanin and emulsified with Freund's adjuvant before injection into rabbits. Antibody 6H is a mouse monoclonal antibody specific for the α1 isoform of the Na,K-ATPase, and was a generous gift from Dr. Michael Caplan, Yale University. Horseradish peroxidase-labeled secondary antibodies (donkey anti-rabbit) were purchased from BIO/CAN Scientific. 5′-Rapid amplification of cDNA ends (5′-RACE) 1The abbreviations used are: 5′-RACE, 5′-rapid amplification of cDNA endswas carried out using CLONTECH Marathon-ready cDNA from rat kidney following the manufacturer's instructions. Appropriate primers (see below) were synthesized, and the γ subunit gene sequence was amplified by polymerase chain reaction. The 5′-end primer contained a site for HindIII endonuclease (boldface), a Kozak sequence (underlined; see Ref. 13Kozak M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 8125-8132Crossref PubMed Scopus (4172) Google Scholar), and the first 24 bases of the γ subunit gene as determined by 5′-RACE (GGGGGGGAAGCTT GCCGCCACCATGACAGAGCTGTCAGCTAACCAT). The 3′-end primer contained a BamHI endonuclease site (boldface) and bases complementary to the last 24 bases of the γ subunit gene as determined by Mercer et al. (5Mercer R.W. Biemesderfer D. Bliss Jr., D.P. Collins J.H. Forbush III., B. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 579-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar) (GGGGGGGATCCGTCACAGCTCATCTTCATTGACCT). The resulting DNA was then cleaved with these endonucleases and ligated into the corresponding sites of pREP4 vector (Invitrogen) to make pREP4-γ. Sequencing of the recombinant plasmid was carried out using a Pharmacia T7 sequencing kit. pREP4 and pREP4-γ DNA used for transfections were purified using Qiagen affinity columns according to the manufacturer's instructions. HEK-293 cells at 50% confluency in a 14-cm culture plate were transfected with pREP4 or pREP4-γ using FuGENE 6 reagent (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and following the manufacturer's instructions. Cells were selected for 10 days, divided among 5 × 14 cm plates, and allowed to grow to confluency (about 3 weeks) in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% newborn calf serum and 400 μg/ml hygromycin B. Cellular membranes from transfected cells and from rat kidney medulla were prepared by the procedure described elsewhere (12Therien A.G. Goldshleger R. Karlish S.J.D. Blostein R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32628-32634Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Western blot analysis and densitometry measurements were carried out as described previously (14Therien A.G. Nestor N.B. Ball W.J. Blostein R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7104-7112Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) with the following modifications. 10% polyacrylamide gels were run on a Protean II gel electrophoresis apparatus (Bio-Rad), transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore), and blotted with 6H antibodies and γC33 antiserum, both at dilutions of 1:10,000. Na,K-ATPase and Na-ATPase assays were carried out at 37 °C in a final volume of 100 μl as described previously (12Therien A.G. Goldshleger R. Karlish S.J.D. Blostein R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32628-32634Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). For Na,K-ATPase assays, final concentrations of reactants were: 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm KCl, 40 mmcholine chloride, 4 mm MgSO4, 1 mmEDTA, 30 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), and varying concentrations of ATP as indicated. Na,K-ATPase activities shown represent the ATPase activities inhibited by 5 mm ouabain and ranged from 1500 to 4500, 130 to 180, and 110 to 130 nmol Pi/mg/min for kidney, HEK-pREP4, and HEK-pREP4-γ membranes, respectively. For Na-ATPase assays, final concentrations of reactants were: 20 mm NaCl, 20 mm choline chloride, 2 mm MgSO4, 1 mm EDTA, 5 mm EGTA, 20 mm histidine-Tris (pH 7.4), and 1 μm ATP. To determine effects of K+ on Na-ATPase, choline chloride was replaced by the indicated concentrations of KCl. For assays of effects of anti-γ, membranes were preincubated for 1 h at 4 °C in the presence of immune (γC33) or nonimmune (preimmune) sera at a ratio of 1:100. For experiments of K inhibition of Na-ATPase, the sera were dialyzed for 48 h at 4 °C against three changes of 1000 volumes of 5 mm imidazole (pH 7.4). When present, the 10-mer peptide was used in the antiserum preincubation at a concentration of 20 μm. K′ATP values were calculated by analyzing ATP activation curves using the Michaelis-Menten formulation. All experiments shown are representative of at least three separate experiments, and each data point shown is the mean ± S.E. of the difference between triplicate determinations carried out in the absence and presence of ouabain. We showed previously that the γ subunit protein is expressed in a tissue-specific manner. Of the various rat tissues analyzed by Western blotting (kidney medulla, kidney glomerulus, red blood cells, heart, and axolemma), γ was detected only in the kidney medulla (12Therien A.G. Goldshleger R. Karlish S.J.D. Blostein R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32628-32634Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). In more recent experiments (not shown) this analysis has been extended to additional tissues of the rat, namely the lung, small intestine, stomach, and spleen. The γ protein could not be detected in these tissues except for a trace amount in the spleen (relative to α, amounting to ≤2% of that present in the kidney medulla). The kidney-specific presence of γ also holds true with mouse tissues (kidney, axolemma, and heart) analyzed similarly. 2A. Therien, R. Daneman, and R. Blostein, unpublished observations. Our earlier evidence of a modulatory role for the γ subunit on the conformational equilibrium of the Na,K-ATPase reaction was inferred from studies of the effects of an anti-γ antiserum on enzymatic activity. To evaluate directly the functional role of γ, it was essential to transfect cDNA encoding γ into mammalian cells devoid of γ. An additional goal of such experiments was to establish the basis for the existence of γ as a doublet in the rat (5Mercer R.W. Biemesderfer D. Bliss Jr., D.P. Collins J.H. Forbush III., B. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 579-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar) as it is in the Xenopuskidney (7Béguin P. Wang X. Firsov D. Puoti A. Claeys D. Horisberger J.-D. Geering K. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4250-4260Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Accordingly, we first used 5′-RACE to ascertain that the previously reported cDNA of the rat γ subunit comprised the full-length sequence and, if not, whether the doublet in Western blots is secondary to the presence of an additional start codon in the mRNA for the γ subunit as is the case for Xenopuskidney (7Béguin P. Wang X. Firsov D. Puoti A. Claeys D. Horisberger J.-D. Geering K. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4250-4260Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). The resulting sequence, shown in Fig.1, confirmed the presence of a single initiator methionine. However, the γ cDNA thus obtained encodes a protein of 66 rather than 58 residues, as originally reported (5Mercer R.W. Biemesderfer D. Bliss Jr., D.P. Collins J.H. Forbush III., B. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 579-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar), and corresponds to the sequence subsequently revised by Minor et al. (11Minor N.T. Sha Q. Nichols C.G. Mercer R.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6521-6525Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The calculated molecular mass is 7237 Da. The dichotomy may be the result of either a cloning artifact or, possibly, an isoform variant. 3R. W. Mercer, personal communication. Efforts to express γ in HeLa and HEK cells using a standard stable transfection system resulted in levels of expression that, compared with the kidney, were considered too low (γ:α ≤ 0.1) given the relatively modest effects of anti-γ on the kidney enzyme. In an effort to increase the level of expression, we used the plasmid pREP4 that combines the advantages of “classical” transient and stable expression systems. In addition to a hygromycin resistance gene, this plasmid contains an origin of replication that allows it to remain expressed episomally for several weeks in the nuclei of primate and canine cells. Thus, hygromycin can be used to select for cells that contain multiple copies of the gene (rather than just one). Accordingly, we subcloned the gene for γ (revised sequence shown in Fig. 1) in pREP4 and transfected HEK-293 cells with both recombinant and wild type plasmids. Membranes were made from the transfected HEK-pREP4-γ and control HEK-pREP4 cells, and the amount of γ subunit protein relative to α subunit protein was estimated by a comparison with kidney membranes using Western blot analyses of both the γ and α subunits. The blots shown in Fig. 2 indicate that the γ doublet is present in both kidney and HEK-pREP4-γ membranes but not in control HEK-pREP4 membranes. The densities of the γ subunit doublet and α subunit band of HEK-pREP4-γ were compared with those of the kidney using several dilutions and varying times of exposure to film. We determined that pREP4-γ membranes contain 34 ± 12% (S.E.) of the amount of γ present in the kidney after normalizing for α1 densities. Assuming that the γ:α ratio of kidney is 1:1 (7Béguin P.

Acta. 1982; 686: 7-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), this indicates that the stoichiometry of the γ:α proteins in HEK-pREP4-γ ≈ 1:3. That this ratio reflects γ associated with α was confirmed in Western blots of immunoprecipitates using the antibody 6H (not shown). We showed earlier that binding of antibodies raised to the γ polypeptide doublet associated with the pig kidney Na,K-ATPase binds to the cytoplasmic tail of the γ subunit (12Therien A.G. Goldshleger R. Karlish S.J.D. Blostein R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32628-32634Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). This binding was associated with partial inhibition of the Na,K-ATPase activity. Moreover, inhibition varied as a function of conditions that affect the rate-limiting step(s) during steady-state hydrolysis, for example varying pH. Thus, the inhibition (≈30%) observed under conditions of optimal concentrations of substrates and at pH 7.4 decreased as the pH level increased and increased as pH decreased. We concluded that the antiserum caused a shift in theE 1 ↔ E 2(K) equilibrium toward E 2(K). To maximize the inhibitory effect of the antiserum, particularly for tests of the effect of γ in the transfected cells in which the γ:α ratio is lower than in the kidney medulla, we tested the prediction that inhibition would be greater at suboptimal ATP concentrations, under which conditions theE 2(K) → E 1 sequence becomes even more rate-limiting (17Post R.L. Hegyvary C. Kume S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 6530-6540Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For these experiments, a 10-residue peptide representing the C terminus of the γ subunit was synthesized and used for the production of γC33 antisera, allowing confirmation of the specificity of the anti-γ effects and providing free 10-mer peptide for competition studies. Fig.3 A shows a representative experiment on the effects of anti-γ (serum γC33) on Na,K-ATPase activity of renal enzyme at near saturating (1 mm) and subsaturating (10 μm) concentrations of ATP. As predicted, inhibition increases as the ATP concentration is lowered, from 36 ± 4% inhibition at 1 mm ATP to 70 ± 11% at 10 μm ATP (averages of several experiments). In addition, the presence of excess amounts of free peptide corresponding to the C terminus of γ during the preincubation reversed completely the inhibition observed at both ATP concentrations; no effect on the activity of nonimmune serum-treated enzyme was observed. Fig.3 B is a Lineweaver-Burk plot of a representative experiment showing the effect of ATP concentration on activity. It shows that pretreatment of the enzyme with antiserum γC33 caused a 1.8-fold increase in K′ATP (for values, seeinset in Fig. 4).V max for γC33-treated enzyme was 78 ± 7% that for nonimmune serum-treated enzyme. The critical implication of this result is that anti-γ reverses an increase in affinity effected by the γ subunit. This hypothesis was tested in HEK-pREP4-γ cells and HEK-pREP4 cells.Figure 4Effect of γC33 on ATP affinity of HEK-pREP4 and HEK-pREP4-γ pumps. Membranes isolated from HEK-pREP4-γ (filled circles) and HEK-pREP4 (open circles) were assayed for Na,K-ATPase activity (v) at varying ATP concentrations. Lineweaver-Burk plots of a representative experiment are shown, withV max values of the two membrane preparations normalized to 1.0.

Differences between nonimmune and immune serum-treated renal enzyme (p < 0.01), as well as between pREP4- and pREP4-γ-transfected cells (p < 0.02), are significant using Student's t test.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) We first compared the effect of γC33 on HEK-pREP4-γ, HEK pREP4 cells, and kidney enzymes, all assayed at 10 μm ATP. The experiment (not shown) indicated that γC33 caused 33 ± 2 and 82 ± 15% inhibition of HEK-pREP4-γ and kidney enzymes, respectively, and had no effect on the activity of HEK-pREP4 cells. This inhibition is consistent with the aforementioned relative amounts of γ in kidney versus HEK-pREP4-γ cells. Experiments were then carried out to determine whether the γ subunit has any effect on K′ATP. The plots shown in Fig. 4indicate that the HEK-pREP4-γ enzyme has a significantly higher affinity for ATP compared with control HEK-pREP4 enzyme (forK′ATP values, see inset). The γ-mediated-1.3-fold decrease in K′ATP in these cells, although modest, is in fact similar to the effect of γ in the kidney membranes, taking into account the lower α:γ ratio in the transfected cells (approximately one-third that of kidney membranes). This being the case, we used a more sensitive assay of ATP affinity to magnify the effect of γ and to determine whether anti-γ antiserum can reverse its effects. This assay takes advantage of the fact that K+ inhibits Na-ATPase activity at a very low (1 μm) ATP concentration under which condition the (low affinity) ATP-activated K+ deocclusion reaction becomes rate-limiting. Accordingly, this inhibition decreases as the affinity for ATP at its low affinity binding site increases (18Daly S.E. Lane L.K. Blostein R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23683-23689Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 5 A, K+ is less effective at inhibiting the Na-ATPase activity of pumps of γ-transfected membranes than of control membranes. Experiments were then carried out to test and compare K+ inhibition, and the effect of anti-γ thereupon, of the enzyme of the kidney medulla, HEK-pREP4-γ, and HEK-pREP4. Fig. 5 B shows the percentage inhibition at 0.2 mm KCl of these pumps in the presence of nonimmune versus immune serum. Whereas preincubation of kidney and pREP4-γ pumps with γC33 effected 2.1- and 1.5-fold increases in K+ inhibition, respectively, no γC33-mediated change was detected for HEK-pREP4 pumps. The successful transfection of the γ subunit into mammalian cells with sodium pumps devoid of this subunit has enabled the direct analysis of the functional role of this Na,K-ATPase-associated protein. Although the γ subunit does not appear to be necessary for normal Na,K-ATPase activity (7Béguin P. Wang X. Firsov D. Puoti A. Claeys D. Horisberger J.-D. Geering K.

Recently, Béguin et al. (7Béguin P. Wang X. Firsov D. Puoti A. Claeys D. Horisberger J.-D. Geering K. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4250-4260Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar) have shown that the rat γ subunit lowers the affinity of the pump for K+ in cRNA-injected Xenopus oocytes, at least in the absence of Na+. A γ-mediated decrease inK′ATP could explain this increase inK′0.5 for K+ because, as a first approximation, ATP and K+ affinities are inversely related (20Eisner D.A. Richards D.E. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1981; 319: 403-418Crossref Scopus (36) Google Scholar). However, that result may be confounded by the use of cRNA synthesized using the original sequence for rat γ (5Mercer R.W. Biemesderfer D. Bliss Jr., D.P. Collins J.H. Forbush III., B. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 579-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). In a recent report, the human γ subunit was shown to induce cation channel activity in Xenopus oocytes (11Minor N.T. Sha Q. Nichols C.G. Mercer R.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6521-6525Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), consistent with several reports of other channel-inducing membrane peptides (8Attali B. Latter H. Rachamim N. Garty H. Proc. Natl.

These proteins have homology with the γ subunit but are generally larger, and some contain possible protein kinases C and A phosphorylation sites at their C-terminal ends that are not present in the γ subunit (5Mercer R.W.

Although we have no information regarding such a role in our transfected cells, it should be pointed out that the sequence of the putative human γ subunit reported in the aforementioned study contains 30 extra amino acids at its N terminus (11Minor N.T. Sha Q. Nichols C.G. Mercer R.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6521-6525Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) that are absent in rat γ (cf. Fig. 1). Whether the rat γ subunit also has a channel function and/or this extended N terminus confers a particular functional role in forming channels in Xenopus oocytes remains to be determined. The N-terminal sequence of the rat γ subunit reported here and by Minor et al. (11Minor N.T. Sha Q. Nichols C.G. Mercer R.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6521-6525Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) is different from the one originally reported (5Mercer R.W. Biemesderfer D. Bliss Jr., D.P. Collins J.H. Forbush III., B. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 579-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). That it is the correct sequence is substantiated by the following observations. First, the γ subunit doublet present in membranes of transfected cells corresponds in size to that of kidney membranes (Fig. 2). Second, the presence of a lysine residue at position 13 (Fig. 1) where a glutamine was originally reported (5Mercer R.W. Biemesderfer D. Bliss Jr., D.P. Collins J.H. Forbush III., B. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 579-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar) is in accordance with the finding that the upper band of the rat γ subunit is cleaved by trypsin (treatment of intact right-side-out microsomes (12Therien A.G. Goldshleger R. Karlish S.J.D. Blostein R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32628-32634Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar)). Third, preliminary results using matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectroscopy indicate that the pig kidney γ subunit has a length of between 64 and 67 residues, 4A. Shainskaya and S. J. D. Karlish, unpublished observations.consistent with a length of 66 residues reported here and in Ref.11Minor N.T. Sha Q. Nichols C.G. Mercer R.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6521-6525Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar. The presence of two distinct bands of γ has been the subject of some controversy. Whereas Mercer et al. first showed that a single RNA species could yield two protein products evidenced on Western blots using an artificial translation system (5Mercer R.W. Biemesderfer D. Bliss Jr., D.P. Collins J.H. Forbush III., B. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 579-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar), Béguinet al. (7Béguin P. Wang X. Firsov D. Puoti A. Claeys D. Horisberger J.-D. Geering K. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4250-4260Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar) showed that in X. laevis the two bands were secondary to the presence of two distinct start codons (7Béguin P. Wang X. Firsov D. Puoti A. Claeys D. Horisberger J.-D. Geering K. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4250-4260Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Our results with 5′-RACE analysis preclude the presence of distinct ATG codons for the rat protein, indicating instead that post-translational modifications are involved, because transfection of HEK-293 cells with a gene containing single start and stop codons yielded two bands of similar mobilities to those of the kidney γ subunit. In addition, preliminary mass spectroscopy results are consistent with the notion that the difference between the two bands is the result of post-translational modifications.4 The differences in the ratio of the densities of the upper to the lower band between γ subunits of kidney and transfected HEK membranes (see Fig. 2) suggest tissue-specific variations in post-translational modifications. Whether each band has some distinct role remains to be determined. Overall, our results suggest an interaction between the Na,K-ATPase and the C-terminal tail of the γ subunit that regulates ATP affinity and that is reversible upon binding of antibodies to γ. The finding that γ increases the apparent affinity for ATP in γ-transfected cells is completely concurrent with the effect of anti-γ on the αβγ pump of the kidney tubule. Moreover, under conditions in which K+ sensitivity of Na-ATPase at low ATP concentration is used as a sensitive marker of differences in ATP affinity, the reversal of the γ effect by anti-γ is similar with the enzyme of γ-transfected cells and the kidney medulla. These similarities underscore our earlier interpretation of the effect of γ from analysis of the effects of the anti-γ antiserum. Whether the increased apparent affinity for ATP is, in fact, a true increase in affinity or a reflection of an alteration in conformational equilibrium toward E 1 form(s) is unclear and requires further analysis, as does the question of whether the difference in ATP affinity can be evidenced in a change in apparent affinity for extracellular K+. Whatever the case, it is the change in ATP affinity that is likely to be of major physiological relevance. The increase in apparent affinity for ATP effected by γ is approximately 2-fold, as evidenced in either the effect of anti-γ on the kidney enzyme or of γ transfected into HEK cells, extrapolating the ratio of γ:α in HEK-pREP-γ to that of the kidney. Such a change in apparent affinity may be of critical physiological importance. Although other physiological functions may be served by the γ subunit (as suggested recently by Jones et al. (22Jones H. Davies T.C. Kidder G.M. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 1545-1552Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar)), an almost 2-fold shift in ATP affinity is a potentially important regulatory mechanism. The γ subunit may serve to preserve the pumping activity in cells or conditions in which the ATP level falls suddenly. Relevant to this notion is the observation that the renal outer medulla is highly prone to anoxia because it works on the brink of anoxia even in normal circumstances (23Brezis M. Epstein F.H. Annu. Rev. Med. 1993; 44: 27-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 24Brezis M. Rosen S. N. Engl. J. Med. 1995; 332: 647-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (970) Google Scholar). That the γ subunit effect is reversible upon addition of anti-γ antibodies further underscores its physiological relevance. It may be hypothesized that, like the anti-γ antibodies, some cytosolic factor binds to the γ subunit and disrupts its interactions with the enzyme. Mutational analysis of the C-terminal 10 amino acids that comprise the epitope reactive with anti-γ may provide information on specific residues involved in α-γ interactions. We thank Drs. Robert W. Mercer, Washington University, and David C. Clarke, University of Toronto, for invaluable suggestions and Mrs. Ania Wilczynska for technical assistance.

PE plasmalogen, PE with two unsaturated fatty acids, and lyso-PE, which all do not favor bilayer organization, did not support proper refolding. Proper refolding occurred when these latter lipids were mixed with a bilayer-forming lipid (phosphatidylglycerol), which alone could not support refolding. l-Phosphatidylserine (PS; natural diastereomer) did support proper refolding. PE derivatives of increasing degrees of methylation were progressively less effective in supporting refolding, with phosphatidylcholine being completely ineffective.

Neitherd-PS (sn-glycero-1-phosphate backbone) nor P-d-S (d-serine in the head group) is competent in supporting proper refolding unless used in binary mixtures with phosphatidylglycerol.

(1998) EMBO J. 17, 5255–5264). How a polytopic membrane protein inserts into the membrane and adopts its native conformation remains one of the major unresolved questions of biology. During membrane assembly, integral membrane proteins must interact with other proteins and with the lipid bilayer itself, resulting in their proper conformational maturation. The role phospholipids play in forming a membrane bilayer and a hydrophobic environment for membrane protein folding and assembly is well accepted (1Marsh D. Watts A. New Comprehensive Biochemistry: Protein-Lipid Interactions. 25. Elsevier, Amsterdam1993: 41-66Google Scholar, 2Selinsky B.S. Yeagle P. The Structure of Biological Membranes. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1992: 603-651Google Scholar); however, the role specific phospholipids play in assisting or directing folding of membrane proteins has not been extensively explored. In order to determine the role that individual phospholipids play in the folding of membrane proteins in Escherichia coli, we are using the lactose permease (LacY) 1The abbreviations used are: LacY, lactose permease; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; PE, phosphatidylethanolamine; PG, phosphatidylglycerol; PC, phosphatidylcholine; PS, phosphatidylserine; PMME, monomethyl derivative of PE; PDME, dimethyl derivative of PE; mAb, monoclonal antibody; HII, inverted hexagonal II; CL, cardiolipin; d-PS, PS with sn-glycero-1-phosphate backbone; P-d-S, PS with d-serine in the head group1The abbreviations used are: LacY, lactose permease; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; PE, phosphatidylethanolamine; PG, phosphatidylglycerol; PC, phosphatidylcholine; PS, phosphatidylserine; PMME, monomethyl derivative of PE; PDME, dimethyl derivative of PE; mAb, monoclonal antibody; HII, inverted hexagonal II; CL, cardiolipin; d-PS, PS with sn-glycero-1-phosphate backbone; P-d-S, PS with d-serine in the head groupas a model system. LacY is one of the most intensively studied integral membrane proteins for which there is both extensive structural information (3Varela M.F. Wilson T.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1276: 21-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 4Kaback H.R. Voss J. Wu J. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1997; 7: 537-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) and monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) directed against several extramembrane epitopes whose recognition depends on secondary or tertiary structural organization (5Sun J. Wu J. Carrasco N. Kaback H.R. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 990-998Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 6Sun J. Li J. Carrasco N. Kaback H.R. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 274-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The organization of extramembrane and transmembrane domains of LacY is characteristic of the major facilitator superfamily of transport proteins (7Marger M.D. Saier M.H.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1993; 18: 13-20Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (743) Google Scholar), making results obtained from studies on LacY applicable to a variety of other transport proteins.Employing a novel blotting technique (Eastern-Western) in which proteins are exposed to phospholipids bound to a solid support during renaturation from SDS in the standard Western blotting procedure, we previously presented the following experimental evidence (8Bogdanov M. Sun J. Kaback H.R. Dowhan W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11615-11618Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 9Bogdanov M. Dowhan W. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5255-5264Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar) that the phospholipid phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) acts as a non-protein molecular chaperone in the folding of LacY: (i) LacY appears to foldin vivo with the assistance of PE as assessed by recognition by a conformation-sensitive mAb directed against periplasmic loop P7 (Phe242–Gly254), which is flanged by transmembrane domains VII and VIII and defines epitope 4B1 (Fig. 1); (ii) LacY assembled initially in vivo in the presence of PE either retains native-like conformation of this epitope throughout or has sufficient “conformational memory” to reform this epitope after SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) and Western blot analysis in the absence of added lipid; (iii) after SDS-PAGE and Western blotting, no phospholipid can be detected associated with LacY (less than one molecule of PE per 75 LacY monomers); (iv) LacY initially assembled in vivo in the absence of PE can form the native-like conformation of epitope 4B1 during refolding from SDS in the presence of specifically PE but not phosphatidylglycerol, CL, or phosphatidylcholine (PG, CL, and PC, respectively); (iv) extensive denaturation of LacY using urea-SDS eliminates epitope 4B1 in LacY originally assembled in PE-containing membranes and prevents its refolding in the presence of PE; (v) the requirement for PE in the folding of LacY has been demonstrated in an in situ assembly system using in vitro protein synthesis coupled within vitro phospholipid synthesis in the presence of membranes initially lacking PE; (vi) PE is not required either prior to or concomitant with membrane insertion but is required in a late step of conformational maturation to attain native structure. Thus, PE correctsin vitro a LacY folding defect caused by either in vivo or in vitro assembly in PE-deficient membranes, but once this epitope is formed in vivo, PE is not required to maintain its conformation. Based on these results, we proposed as a general principle that phospholipids can act as molecular chaperones of non-protein origin that specifically mediate the folding of multispanning polytopic membrane proteins, thereby extending the definition of chaperones to other biomolecules in addition to proteins.What are the minimum requirements of a phospholipid to facilitate membrane protein folding? In this study, we establish a specific requirement for a nonmethylated aminophospholipid of natural chirality and preference for lamellar organization for refolding of LacY into its native conformation in the region defined by epitope 4B1. The proper conformation of epitope 4B1 is required for full function of LacY as a transporter (5Sun J. Wu J. Carrasco N. Kaback H.R. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 990-998Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar).DISCUSSIONThe aim of the present study was to explore in more detail the specific properties of the head group, acyl chains, and physical state of phospholipids that support proper refolding of LacY. Although we do not understand the physical and chemical properties of the lipids and proteins once bound to a solid support in the Eastern-Western blotting procedure, several clear relationships from our studies can be made between the requirements to be effective in refolding of LacY and the physical and chemical properties in solution of phospholipids that support refolding: (i) a positively charged head group preferably with a small or ionizable amine; (ii) a fatty acid composition either singly or in binary mixtures that favors an overall bilayer or lamellar organization in solution; and (iii) a distinct preference for naturally occurring diastereomers of the aminolipid in single component systems or the presence of lamellar forming phospholipids of natural chirality in binary mixtures with an unnatural diastereomer of the aminolipid. These relationships clearly extend our previous conclusions supporting a distinct biological specificity for PE in phospholipid-assisted folding of LacY both in vivo and in vitro that goes well beyond simply providing a nonspecific detergent-like or two-phase environment for refolding of LacY.Since the requirement for naturally occurring PE in the refolding of LacY had been established both in vivo and in vitro, the finding that unsaturated PE as opposed to fully saturated PE cannot facilitate refolding was surprising. This finding raised the question of whether the phase properties of phospholipids were a factor in the refolding process. The refolding effectiveness of the various PE derivatives singly or in binary mixtures with PG is consistent with the importance of the overall macrostructure of the lipid phase and strongly suggests that refolding of LacY is dependent an overall lamellar macrostructure.Several reports have documented a preference or specificity for a particular physical organization of phospholipids. Protein translocation across the E. coli inner membrane lacking PE could be restored by (C18:1)PE (non-lamellar) but not (C14:0)PE or (C18:1)PC (both lamellar) (32Rietveld A.G. Koorengevel M.C. de Kruijff B. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5506-5513Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). (18:1Δ9cis)PE (non-lamellar) but not (18:1Δ9trans)PE (lamellar) significantly enhanced the respiratory control ratio of ubiquinol-cytochrome c reductase and ATP-induced membrane potential of the H+-ATPase (33Li L. Zheng L.X. Yang F.Y. Chem. Phys. Lipids. 1995; 76: 135-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The photochemical function of rhodopsin (34Brown M.F. Chem. Phys. Lipids. 1994; 73: 159-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar) and the ATPase activity of E. coli SecA protein (50Ahn T. Kim H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21692-21698Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) are enhanced by non-lamellar PE derivatives. However, mammalian Ca2+-ATPase activity (35Starling A.P. Dalton K.A. East J.M. Oliver S. Lee A.G. Biochem. J. 1996; 320: 309-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) is stimulated significantly more by lamellar phase- than HIIphase-forming derivatives of PE. Finally, lipopolysaccharide derivatives that tend to organize in nonbilayer structures were better facilitators of folding of PhoE protein in situ as it transits the inner membrane of E. coli (36de Cock H. Brandenburg K. Wiese A. Holst O. Seydel U. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5114-5119Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar).PS, which is only found in trace amounts in wild type E. coli, may present a more complex special case. Unlike PE, PS contains two chiral centers, one at the 2-sn-position and the other in the serine moiety. Consequently d-PS andl-PS are diastereomers and not enantiomers much like the glycerol-based glycolipids that have multiple chiral centers in the glycerol and sugar moieties. l-(C18:1)PS did not support refolding although it presumably favors a lamellar organization and contains a primary amine. Furthermore, the unnatural diastereomers at either chiral center did not support refolding, but all derivatives of PS were effective in binary mixtures with PG. Previous results have noted different effects of chirality between mixtures versussingle systems. Maximal activation of protein kinase C requires the synergistic action specifically of PS (natural diastereomer), Ca2+, and diacylglycerol. This activation displays no stereoselectivity or strict chemical specificity within the head group in the absence of diacylglycerol; i.e. P-l-S, P-d-S, and even PG are equally effective but at a reduced level in the absence of diacylglycerol (37Newton A.C. Keranen L.M. Biochemistry. 1994; 31: 6651-6658Crossref Scopus (121) Google Scholar). 2H and31P NMR studies have revealed small differences in the head group conformations of P-l-S and P-d-S (38Epand R.M. Stevenson C. Bruins R. Schram V. Glaser M. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 12068-12073Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). It was suggested that such structural differences might affect packing interactions and alter the effective area individual lipids occupy in respective single component bilayers of these diastereomers (39Browning J.L. Seelig J. Biochemistry. 1980; 19: 1262-1270Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar) that is not apparent in binary mixtures. Finally, the natural 1,2-sn-diastereomer of the glycolipid monoglucosyl didodecylglycerol has a higher propensity to form the lamellar phase than the unnatural 2,3-sn-diastereomer (40Mannock D.A. Lewis R.N. McElhaney R.N. Akiyama M. Yamada H. Turner D.C. Gruner S.M. Biophys. J. 1992; 63: 1355-1368Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) that adopts the HII phase. Moreover, the 1,2-rac mixture of this glycolipid displayed phase properties very similar to the natural diastereomer, indicating that mixtures of diastereomers are not simply additive in their final physical properties. All of these studies including our results support as biologically important the physical properties of the phospholipid macrostructure as well as the chemical properties of individual phospholipid species in biological processes.The failure of PC to assist proper refolding of LacY assembled in the absence of PE is not surprising, since PC cannot support active transport of LacY in an in vitro reconstituted system (29Chen C.-C. Wilson T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 10150-10158Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,30Page M.G. Rosenbusch J.P. Yamato I. J. Biol.

However, the fact that PC actively denatures or destabilizes epitope 4B1 during refolding of LacY originally assembled in the presence of PE now explains why native LacY does not display full function in PC-containing lipid vesicles. This result should be taken as a general caution in designing experiments involving membrane-associated proteins in which endogenous phospholipids are replaced by phospholipids not normally present in vivo.Still puzzling is why anionic phospholipids in the absence of PE do not support full function in reconstituted systems even for LacY originally assembled in the presence of PE (14Bogdanov M. Dowhan W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 732-739Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 29Chen C.-C. Wilson T.H. J. Biol.

EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5255-5264Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar) strongly suggests that retention of epitope 4B1 after subjecting native LacY to Western blotting is not due to residual PE, the presence of epitope 4B1, although required, may not be sufficient to support full LacY function in active transport in the absence of PE. Our results cannot rule out that PE per se is required for either maintenance of proper structures of domains other than 4B1 or is directly involved in net turnover of the permease required for energy-dependent active transport of substrate. The molecular basis for this PE requirement might be direct involvement in the mechanism of coupling of uphill movement of substrate with downhill proton movement. The ionizable phosphoamino group of PE may be located in close proximity to functionally important residues such as Glu269 of transmembrane helix VIII (41Ujwal M.L. Sahin-Tóth M. Persson B. Kaback H.R. Mol. Membr. Biol. 1994; 11: 9-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) or the salt bridge (Asp240–Lys319) between transmembrane helices VII and X (42Sahin-Tóth M. Dunten R.L.

Biol. 1997; 7: 537-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar).There is growing evidence that phospholipids can facilitate the folding of membrane proteins or proteins that interact with membranes as part of their biogenesis. CL may selectively influence refolding of rhodanase as it passes through the mitochondrial membrane without the aid of protein chaperones (43Zardeneta G. Horowitz P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 5811-5816Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 44Zardeneta G. Horowitz P.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 210: 831-837Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 45Zardeneta G.

OmpA, an outer membrane protein ofE. coli, was unfolded in 8 m urea without detergent, and refolding was initiated by rapid dilution of urea in the presence of PC vesicles that were required for regeneration of its native structure (46Surrey T. Jahnig F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 7457-7461Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Recent reports of specific effects of PG on folding of E. coli periplasmic DegP protein (47Skorko-Glonek J. Lipinska B. Krzewski K. Zolese G. Bertoli E. Tanfani F. J. Biol.

EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5567-5593Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) indicate that the phenomenon of lipid-assisted folding may be widespread and general among proteins that come in contact with membranes during their assembly. Heightened awareness of lipid-assisted folding of proteins hopefully will stimulate other investigators in designing experiments to investigate this process in many other systems. How a polytopic membrane protein inserts into the membrane and adopts its native conformation remains one of the major unresolved questions of biology. During membrane assembly, integral membrane proteins must interact with other proteins and with the lipid bilayer itself, resulting in their proper conformational maturation. The role phospholipids play in forming a membrane bilayer and a hydrophobic environment for membrane protein folding and assembly is well accepted (1Marsh D. Watts A. New Comprehensive Biochemistry: Protein-Lipid Interactions. 25. Elsevier, Amsterdam1993: 41-66Google Scholar, 2Selinsky B.S. Yeagle P. The Structure of Biological Membranes. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1992: 603-651Google Scholar); however, the role specific phospholipids play in assisting or directing folding of membrane proteins has not been extensively explored. In order to determine the role that individual phospholipids play in the folding of membrane proteins in Escherichia coli, we are using the lactose permease (LacY) 1The abbreviations used are: LacY, lactose permease; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; PE, phosphatidylethanolamine; PG, phosphatidylglycerol; PC, phosphatidylcholine; PS, phosphatidylserine; PMME, monomethyl derivative of PE; PDME, dimethyl derivative of PE; mAb, monoclonal antibody; HII, inverted hexagonal II; CL, cardiolipin; d-PS, PS with sn-glycero-1-phosphate backbone; P-d-S, PS with d-serine in the head group1The abbreviations used are: LacY, lactose permease; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; PE, phosphatidylethanolamine; PG, phosphatidylglycerol; PC, phosphatidylcholine; PS, phosphatidylserine; PMME, monomethyl derivative of PE; PDME, dimethyl derivative of PE; mAb, monoclonal antibody; HII, inverted hexagonal II; CL, cardiolipin; d-PS, PS with sn-glycero-1-phosphate backbone; P-d-S, PS with d-serine in the head groupas a model system. LacY is one of the most intensively studied integral membrane proteins for which there is both extensive structural information (3Varela M.F. Wilson T.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1276: 21-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 4Kaback H.R. Voss J. Wu J. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1997; 7: 537-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) and monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) directed against several extramembrane epitopes whose recognition depends on secondary or tertiary structural organization (5Sun J. Wu J. Carrasco N. Kaback H.R. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 990-998Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 6Sun J. Li J. Carrasco N. Kaback H.R. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 274-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The organization of extramembrane and transmembrane domains of LacY is characteristic of the major facilitator superfamily of transport proteins (7Marger M.D. Saier M.H.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1993; 18: 13-20Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (743) Google Scholar), making results obtained from studies on LacY applicable to a variety of other transport proteins. Employing a novel blotting technique (Eastern-Western) in which proteins are exposed to phospholipids bound to a solid support during renaturation from SDS in the standard Western blotting procedure, we previously presented the following experimental evidence (8Bogdanov M. Sun J. Kaback H.R. Dowhan W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11615-11618Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 9Bogdanov M. Dowhan W. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5255-5264Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar) that the phospholipid phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) acts as a non-protein molecular chaperone in the folding of LacY: (i) LacY appears to foldin vivo with the assistance of PE as assessed by recognition by a conformation-sensitive mAb directed against periplasmic loop P7 (Phe242–Gly254), which is flanged by transmembrane domains VII and VIII and defines epitope 4B1 (Fig. 1); (ii) LacY assembled initially in vivo in the presence of PE either retains native-like conformation of this epitope throughout or has sufficient “conformational memory” to reform this epitope after SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) and Western blot analysis in the absence of added lipid; (iii) after SDS-PAGE and Western blotting, no phospholipid can be detected associated with LacY (less than one molecule of PE per 75 LacY monomers); (iv) LacY initially assembled in vivo in the absence of PE can form the native-like conformation of epitope 4B1 during refolding from SDS in the presence of specifically PE but not phosphatidylglycerol, CL, or phosphatidylcholine (PG, CL, and PC, respectively); (iv) extensive denaturation of LacY using urea-SDS eliminates epitope 4B1 in LacY originally assembled in PE-containing membranes and prevents its refolding in the presence of PE; (v) the requirement for PE in the folding of LacY has been demonstrated in an in situ assembly system using in vitro protein synthesis coupled within vitro phospholipid synthesis in the presence of membranes initially lacking PE; (vi) PE is not required either prior to or concomitant with membrane insertion but is required in a late step of conformational maturation to attain native structure. Thus, PE correctsin vitro a LacY folding defect caused by either in vivo or in vitro assembly in PE-deficient membranes, but once this epitope is formed in vivo, PE is not required to maintain its conformation. Based on these results, we proposed as a general principle that phospholipids can act as molecular chaperones of non-protein origin that specifically mediate the folding of multispanning polytopic membrane proteins, thereby extending the definition of chaperones to other biomolecules in addition to proteins. What are the minimum requirements of a phospholipid to facilitate membrane protein folding? In this study, we establish a specific requirement for a nonmethylated aminophospholipid of natural chirality and preference for lamellar organization for refolding of LacY into its native conformation in the region defined by epitope 4B1. The proper conformation of epitope 4B1 is required for full function of LacY as a transporter (5Sun J. Wu J. Carrasco N. Kaback H.R. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 990-998Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). DISCUSSIONThe aim of the present study was to explore in more detail the specific properties of the head group, acyl chains, and physical state of phospholipids that support proper refolding of LacY. Although we do not understand the physical and chemical properties of the lipids and proteins once bound to a solid support in the Eastern-Western blotting procedure, several clear relationships from our studies can be made between the requirements to be effective in refolding of LacY and the physical and chemical properties in solution of phospholipids that support refolding: (i) a positively charged head group preferably with a small or ionizable amine; (ii) a fatty acid composition either singly or in binary mixtures that favors an overall bilayer or lamellar organization in solution; and (iii) a distinct preference for naturally occurring diastereomers of the aminolipid in single component systems or the presence of lamellar forming phospholipids of natural chirality in binary mixtures with an unnatural diastereomer of the aminolipid. These relationships clearly extend our previous conclusions supporting a distinct biological specificity for PE in phospholipid-assisted folding of LacY both in vivo and in vitro that goes well beyond simply providing a nonspecific detergent-like or two-phase environment for refolding of LacY.Since the requirement for naturally occurring PE in the refolding of LacY had been established both in vivo and in vitro, the finding that unsaturated PE as opposed to fully saturated PE cannot facilitate refolding was surprising. This finding raised the question of whether the phase properties of phospholipids were a factor in the refolding process. The refolding effectiveness of the various PE derivatives singly or in binary mixtures with PG is consistent with the importance of the overall macrostructure of the lipid phase and strongly suggests that refolding of LacY is dependent an overall lamellar macrostructure.Several reports have documented a preference or specificity for a particular physical organization of phospholipids. Protein translocation across the E. coli inner membrane lacking PE could be restored by (C18:1)PE (non-lamellar) but not (C14:0)PE or (C18:1)PC (both lamellar) (32Rietveld A.G. Koorengevel M.C. de Kruijff B. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5506-5513Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). (18:1Δ9cis)PE (non-lamellar) but not (18:1Δ9trans)PE (lamellar) significantly enhanced the respiratory control ratio of ubiquinol-cytochrome c reductase and ATP-induced membrane potential of the H+-ATPase (33Li L. Zheng L.X. Yang F.Y. Chem. Phys. Lipids. 1995; 76: 135-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The photochemical function of rhodopsin (34Brown M.F. Chem. Phys. Lipids. 1994; 73: 159-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar) and the ATPase activity of E. coli SecA protein (50Ahn T. Kim H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21692-21698Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) are enhanced by non-lamellar PE derivatives. However, mammalian Ca2+-ATPase activity (35Starling A.P. Dalton K.A. East J.M. Oliver S. Lee A.G. Biochem. J. 1996; 320: 309-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) is stimulated significantly more by lamellar phase- than HIIphase-forming derivatives of PE. Finally, lipopolysaccharide derivatives that tend to organize in nonbilayer structures were better facilitators of folding of PhoE protein in situ as it transits the inner membrane of E. coli (36de Cock H. Brandenburg K. Wiese A. Holst O. Seydel U. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5114-5119Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar).PS, which is only found in trace amounts in wild type E. coli, may present a more complex special case. Unlike PE, PS contains two chiral centers, one at the 2-sn-position and the other in the serine moiety. Consequently d-PS andl-PS are diastereomers and not enantiomers much like the glycerol-based glycolipids that have multiple chiral centers in the glycerol and sugar moieties. l-(C18:1)PS did not support refolding although it presumably favors a lamellar organization and contains a primary amine. Furthermore, the unnatural diastereomers at either chiral center did not support refolding, but all derivatives of PS were effective in binary mixtures with PG. Previous results have noted different effects of chirality between mixtures versussingle systems. Maximal activation of protein kinase C requires the synergistic action specifically of PS (natural diastereomer), Ca2+, and diacylglycerol. This activation displays no stereoselectivity or strict chemical specificity within the head group in the absence of diacylglycerol; i.e. P-l-S, P-d-S, and even PG are equally effective but at a reduced level in the absence of diacylglycerol (37Newton A.C. Keranen L.M. Biochemistry. 1994; 31: 6651-6658Crossref Scopus (121) Google Scholar). 2H and31P NMR studies have revealed small differences in the head group conformations of P-l-S and P-d-S (38Epand R.M. Stevenson C. Bruins R. Schram V. Glaser M. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 12068-12073Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). It was suggested that such structural differences might affect packing interactions and alter the effective area individual lipids occupy in respective single component bilayers of these diastereomers (39Browning J.L. Seelig J. Biochemistry. 1980; 19: 1262-1270Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar) that is not apparent in binary mixtures. Finally, the natural 1,2-sn-diastereomer of the glycolipid monoglucosyl didodecylglycerol has a higher propensity to form the lamellar phase than the unnatural 2,3-sn-diastereomer (40Mannock D.A. Lewis R.N. McElhaney R.N. Akiyama M. Yamada H. Turner D.C. Gruner S.M. Biophys. J. 1992; 63: 1355-1368Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) that adopts the HII phase. Moreover, the 1,2-rac mixture of this glycolipid displayed phase properties very similar to the natural diastereomer, indicating that mixtures of diastereomers are not simply additive in their final physical properties. All of these studies including our results support as biologically important the physical properties of the phospholipid macrostructure as well as the chemical properties of individual phospholipid species in biological processes.The failure of PC to assist proper refolding of LacY assembled in the absence of PE is not surprising, since PC cannot support active transport of LacY in an in vitro reconstituted system (29Chen C.-C. Wilson T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 10150-10158Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,30Page M.G. Rosenbusch J.P. Yamato I. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 15897-15905Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).

Chem. 1984; 259: 10150-10158Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and still maintaining epitope 4B1 (Fig. 3, lanes 1–3). Although previous evidence (8Bogdanov M. Sun J. Kaback H.R. Dowhan W.

EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5255-5264Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar) strongly suggests that retention of epitope 4B1 after subjecting native LacY to Western blotting is not due to residual PE, the presence of epitope 4B1, although required, may not be sufficient to support full LacY function in active transport in the absence of PE. Our results cannot rule out that PE per se is required for either maintenance of proper structures of domains other than 4B1 or is directly involved in net turnover of the permease required for energy-dependent active transport of substrate. The molecular basis for this PE requirement might be direct involvement in the mechanism of coupling of uphill movement of substrate with downhill proton movement. The ionizable phosphoamino group of PE may be located in close proximity to functionally important residues such as Glu269 of transmembrane helix VIII (41Ujwal M.L. Sahin-Tóth M. Persson B. Kaback H.R. Mol. Membr. Biol. 1994; 11: 9-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) or the salt bridge (Asp240–Lys319) between transmembrane helices VII and X (42Sahin-Tóth M. Dunten R.L.

There is growing evidence that phospholipids can facilitate the folding of membrane proteins or proteins that interact with membranes as part of their biogenesis. CL may selectively influence refolding of rhodanase as it passes through the mitochondrial membrane without the aid of protein chaperones (43Zardeneta G. Horowitz P.M. J. Biol.

https://openalex.org/W1977340592,"D-type cyclins are important cell cycle regulators that promote cellular proliferation in response to growth factors by inactivation of the retinoblastoma protein (Rb). Cyclin D1 has been shown to be overexpressed in several cancer types and to act as an oncogene in breast cancers. As D-type cyclins are rate limiting for progression into S phase, the level at which they accumulate must be carefully regulated. Several mechanisms leading to overexpression of cyclin D1 have been reported including amplification, translocation and stabilization of the mRNA. Here, we present data showing elevated cyclin D1 protein in breast cancer samples in the absence of elevated mRNA level. Further, we found that in these cases, cyclin D3 protein also accumulates and that the coordinate increase in cyclin D1 and D3 occurs in 15% (7/47) of breast cancers. In addition we show that blocking the activity of the 26S proteosome results in the accumulation of cyclin D1 and D3, that both D-type cyclins are ubiquitinated and associate with Cul-1, a component of the SCF ubiquitin ligase complex. Finally, we show that the coordinated elevation of cyclin D1 and D3 is also observed in the breast cell line MCF-7 and demonstrate that the degradation of cyclin D1 and D3 is deficient in this cell line. These results indicate that cyclin D1 and cyclin D3 share a common mechanism of degradation and we propose that the coordinate increase of D-type cyclins observed in primary breast cancers reflects a defect in their proteolysis."
https://openalex.org/W2068381385,"A bi-directional, saturable transport of glutathione (GSH) was found in rat liver microsomal vesicles. GSH transport could be inhibited by the anion transport blockers flufenamic acid and 4,4′-diisothiocyanostilbene-2,2′-disulfonic acid. A part of GSH taken up by the vesicles was metabolized to glutathione disulfide (GSSG) in the lumen. Microsomal membrane was virtually nonpermeable toward GSSG; accordingly, GSSG generated in the microsomal lumen could hardly exit. Therefore, GSH transport, contrary to previous assumptions, is preferred in the endoplasmic reticulum, and GSSG entrapped and accumulated in the lumen creates the oxidized state of its redox buffer.

The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) 1The abbreviations used are: ER, endoplasmic reticulum; GSH, glutathione; GSSG, glutathione disulfide; Mops, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid; Pipes, 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatographyof the cell is the site of the synthesis, posttranslational modification, and folding of proteins transported along the secretory pathway. The oxidizing environment in the lumen of the ER is necessary for the formation of disulfide bonds and for the proper folding of these proteins (1Gething M.J. Sambrook J. Nature. 1992; 355: 33-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (3601) Google Scholar). The oxidative effects are reflected in and supported by the GSH redox buffer; the ratio of GSH and GSSG is around 2:1 within the lumen of ER and along the secretory pathway, whereas the cytosolic ratio ranges from 30:1 to 100:1 (2Hwang C. Sinskey A.J. Lodish H.F. Science. 1992; 257: 1496-1502Crossref PubMed Scopus (1598) Google Scholar). However, the primary source(s) of the oxidative effect has not been demonstrated. Recent observations suggest two possible mechanisms. First, the preferential uptake of the oxidized member of a redox couple through the ER membrane and/or the efflux (or exocytosis) of its reduced form could ensure the oxidative environment. Alternatively, enzymes resident in the membrane or lumen of the ER could produce oxidizing compounds (e.g. reactive oxygen species) toward the lumen. Experimental evidence supports both mechanisms. Favoring the transport-based hypothesis, the preferential transport of dehydroascorbate (the oxidized form of ascorbate) has been described in rat liver microsomal vesicles (3Bánhegyi G.

Similarly, the selective microsomal transport of GSSG was also reported (2Hwang C. Sinskey A.J. Lodish H.F. Science. 1992; 257: 1496-1502Crossref PubMed Scopus (1598) Google Scholar, 4Söling H.-D. Weilandt A. Wasmuth M. Keppler D. Jungermann K. Transport in the Liver, Falk Symposium 74. Kluwer Academic Publisher, Dordrecht1994: 127-136Google Scholar). On the other hand, several microsomal enzymes (cytochrome P-450s, NADPH cytochrome P-450 reductase, gulonolactone oxidase, microsomal iron protein, NADPH-dependent oxidase, sulfydryl oxidase, etc.) can produce reactive oxygen species (5Puskás F.

The recent exploration of the ER oxidase protein (ERO1) and its role in the protein folding also support the latter mechanism (11Frand A.R. Kaiser C.A. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 161-170Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar, 12Pollard M.G. Travers K.J. Weissman J.S. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 171-182Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). Because of the conflicting opinions, the microsomal transport of GSH and GSSG has not been unequivocally established. The presently available data are based on the detection of microsome-associated radioactivity by applying a rapid filtration method and radiolabeled compounds (2Hwang C. Sinskey A.J. Lodish H.F. Science. 1992; 257: 1496-1502Crossref PubMed Scopus (1598) Google Scholar, 4Söling H.-D. Weilandt A. Wasmuth M. Keppler D. Jungermann K. Transport in the Liver, Falk Symposium 74. Kluwer Academic Publisher, Dordrecht1994: 127-136Google Scholar); however, intraluminal GSH or GSSG contents upon transport have not been directly demonstrated. Therefore, experiments were undertaken to reinvestigate the transport of GSH and GSSG through the ER membrane. The main difficulties in the investigation of microsomal transport processes are deriving from the very small intraluminal space, the presence of (intraluminal) reactions affecting the transported compounds and in case of several molecules, the significant binding to the membrane. To overcome these problems, glutathione transport was investigated by two different experimental approaches. The light scattering technique (13Meissner G. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 157: 417-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 14Fulceri R. Bellomo G. Gamberucci A. Scott H.M. Burchell A. Benedetti A. Biochem. J. 1992; 286: 813-817Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) allows the real time detection of the permeation of the compounds at high concentrations, whereas with the polyethylene glycol precipitation-rapid sedimentation method (5Puskás F. Braun L. Csala M. Kardon T. Marcolongo P. Benedetti A. Mandl J. Bánhegyi G. FEBS Lett. 1998; 430: 293-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 15Bánhegyi G. Braun L. Marcolongo P. Csala M. Fulceri R. Mandl J. Benedetti A. Biochem. J. 1996; 315: 171-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) high microsomal protein concentrations can be used, which makes the direct detection of the intraluminal pools possible. To distinguish the uptake from the binding to microsomal vesicles the pore-forming compound alamethicin was used (16Ojcius D.M. Young J.D.-E. Trends Biochem Sci. 1991; 16: 225-229Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 17Fulceri R. Bánhegyi G. Gamberucci A. Giunti R. Mandl J. Benedetti A. Arch. Biochem.

Chem. 1997; 272: 13584-13590Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Rat liver microsomes were prepared from male Sprague-Dawley rats (180–230 g) as described in Ref. 19Henne V. Söling H.-D. FEBS Lett. 1986; 202: 267-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar. Microsomal fractions were resuspended in a buffer containing 100 mm KCl, 20 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 20 mm Mops, pH 7.2. The suspensions were rapidly frozen and maintained under liquid N2 until required. The latency of mannose 6-phosphatase (20Burchell A. Hume R. Burchell B. Clin. Chim. Acta. 1988; 173: 183-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar) and p-nitrophenol UDP-glucuronosyltransferase (17Fulceri R. Bánhegyi G. Gamberucci A. Giunti R. Mandl J. Benedetti A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1994; 309: 43-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) activity was greater than 90 and 95%, respectively. Intactness of microsomal membrane was also ascertained by the sustained light scattering signal upon the addition of the poorly permeant sucrose (14Fulceri R. Bellomo G. Gamberucci A. Scott H.M. Burchell A. Benedetti A. Biochem. J. 1992; 286: 813-817Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). To measure microsomal water space, microsomes were diluted (10 mg protein/ml) in the above buffer containing [3H]H2O (0.2 μCi/ml) or [3H(C)]inulin (0.17 μCi/ml) and centrifuged, (100,000 × g for 60 min), and the radioactivity associated with pellets was measured to enable calculation of extravesicular and intravesicular water spaces (18Bánhegyi G.

Giunti R. Burchell A. Benedetti A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 219: 916-922Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Osmotically induced changes in microsomal vesicle size and shape (13Meissner G. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 157: 417-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) were monitored at 400 nm at a right angle to the incoming light beam, using a fluorimeter (Perkin-Elmer model 650-10S) equipped with a recorder, a temperature-controlled cuvette holder (22 °C), and a magnetic stirrer, as described elsewhere (14Fulceri R. Bellomo G. Gamberucci A. Scott H.M. Burchell A. Benedetti A. Biochem. J. 1992; 286: 813-817Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Briefly, microsomal vesicles (50 μg protein/ml) were equilibrated in a hypotonic medium (5 mm K-Pipes, pH 7.0), and the osmotically induced changes in light scattering were measured after the addition of a small volume (<10% of the total incubation volume) of the concentrated and neutralized solutions of the compounds to be tested. The rapid separation of polyethylene glycol-aggregated microsomes was performed as described previously (5Puskás F. Braun L. Csala M. Kardon T. Marcolongo P. Benedetti A. Mandl J. Bánhegyi G. FEBS Lett. 1998; 430: 293-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 15Bánhegyi G. Braun L. Marcolongo P. Csala M. Fulceri R. Mandl J. Benedetti A. Biochem. J. 1996; 315: 171-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Briefly, microsomes (10 mg protein/ml) were incubated in the presence of various concentrations of GSH or GSSG in a buffer containing 100 mm KCl, 20 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 20 mm Mops, pH 7.2 at 22 °C. To distinguish the intravesicular and the bound GSH/GSSG, the pore-forming antibiotic alamethicin (16Ojcius D.M. Young J.D.-E. Trends Biochem Sci. 1991; 16: 225-229Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 17Fulceri R. Bánhegyi G. Gamberucci A. Giunti R. Mandl J. Benedetti A. Arch. Biochem.

Chem. 1997; 272: 13584-13590Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) was added at the end of the incubations. At the indicated times 0.5-ml samples were taken and precipitated with 0.1 ml of 25% polyethylene glycol. Microsomal vesicles were rapidly sedimented by centrifugation (20 s at 13000 rpm). Pellets were washed two times with the buffer containing 5% polyethylene glycol. The final pellet was deproteinized with perchloric acid. GSH and GSSG contents were measured by HPLC according to Ref. 22Fariss M.W. Reed D.J. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 143: 101-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar. A Waters Alliance HPLC apparatus equipped with autosampler was used; results were analyzed by the Milleneum 2000 software. Glutathione, glutathione disulfide, flufenamic acid, alamethicin, 4,4′-diisothiocyanostilbene-2,2′-disulfonic acid were obtained from Sigma. [3H]H2O (1 mCi/g) and [3H(C)]inulin (500 mCi/g) were from NEN Life Science Products. All other chemicals were of analytical grade. Bondapak aminopropyl column (average particle size 10 μm, 300 × 3.9 mm inner diameter) was bought from Waters Millipore (Milford, MA). First, the permeability of rat liver microsomal membrane toward GSH and GSSG was tested with the light scattering method. Surprisingly, the addition of GSSG resulted in a sustained signal, indicating that microsomal membrane was impermeable toward GSSG, whereas GSH entered the vesicles (Fig. 1). Flufenamic acid, a known anion transport inhibitor (23Cousin J.L. Motais R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1982; 687: 147-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), hindered GSH permeation in a concentration-dependent way; 2.5 mm flufenamic acid almost completely prevented the influx (Fig. 1). Thereafter the transport was also detected by measuring the intravesicular GSH and GSSG contents upon their addition by using the polyethylene glycol precipitation-rapid sedimentation method. GSH addition (5 mm, a cytosol-like concentration) resulted in the time-dependent increase of intraluminal GSH content (Fig. 2). An initial rapid phase of uptake was followed by a second slower phase, which in accordance with the light scattering observations did not reach the level of the complete equilibrium estimated on the basis of the measured total intravesicular water space of the microsomes (3.46 ± 0.91 μl/mg protein; mean ± S.D., n = 4). GSH associated with the microsomal vesicles really occupied an intravesicular space, because the addition of the pore-forming alamethicin rapidly released it. GSH taken up by the vesicles was partially oxidized to GSSG. This oxidation process occurred mainly in the first 2 min of the uptake (Fig. 2) and resulted in an approximately 0.3 mm estimated intravesicular concentration of GSSG. The extravesicular GSSG concentration (presumably due to the contamination of added GSH) never exceeded 0.05 mm and did not increase during the incubation. Therefore, at least a 6-fold concentration gradient between the intra- and extravesicular GSSG pools was established, indicating that the oxidation of GSH was predominantly intravesicular. Intravesicularly formed GSSG could also be released from the lumen by alamethicin addition (Fig. 2). Upon the addition of GSSG (5 mm), as expected on the basis of light scattering experiments, a negligible amount of the added compound entered the vesicles (Fig. 2, open squares). The redox potentials of the intravesicular GSH/GSSG redox system were calculated by the Nernst equation from the measured intraluminal GSH and GSSG contents using −0.24 V standard potential for glutathione (2Hwang C. Sinskey A.J. Lodish H.F. Science. 1992; 257: 1496-1502Crossref PubMed Scopus (1598) Google Scholar). Concentrations were calculated from the measured contents on the basis of intravesicular water space of rat liver microsomal vesicles (see above). At the second, slower phase of the GSH uptake (after 6 min) the intraluminal redox potential of the GSH/GSSG redox system was stabilized around −0.183 mV, which is close to the value reported in the secretory pathway of an intact cell (2Hwang C. Sinskey A.J. Lodish H.F. Science. 1992; 257: 1496-1502Crossref PubMed Scopus (1598) Google Scholar). The initial rate of GSH uptake was protein concentration-dependent; the addition of ATP in accordance with previous observations (4Söling H.-D. Weilandt A. Wasmuth M. Keppler D. Jungermann K. Transport in the Liver, Falk Symposium 74. Kluwer Academic Publisher, Dordrecht1994: 127-136Google Scholar) did not stimulate GSH transport (data not shown). The influx of GSH was saturable (Fig.3). No increase in the initial rate (measured after 2 min of incubation) of accumulation of GSH or GSSG was detected above 5 mm extravesicular GSH concentrations (Fig.3). The apparent Michaelis constant for the total uptake of GSH (GSH + 2GSSG) was 1.65 mm, and the apparent maximal rate was 2.66 nmol/min/mg protein. The correlation coefficient for the linear Lineweaver-Burk plot was r = 0.9904. However, these kinetic data cannot be the exact parameters for the transport alone, because it is also affected by the intravesicular metabolism. The inhibitory effect of flufenamic acid could be demonstrated in the polyethylene glycol precipitation-rapid sedimentation experimental system. 4,4′-Diisothiocyanostilbene-2,2′-disulfonic acid, another anion transport inhibitor, also decreased the initial rate of GSH uptake (Table I).Table IInhibition of GSH influx and GSSG accumulation by flufenamic and 4,4′-diisothiocyanostilbene-2,2′-disulfonic acids in rat liver microsomal vesiclesAddition (n)GSHGSSGnmol/2 min/mg proteinNone (6)2.06 ± 0.301.01 ± 0.122.5 mm flufenamic acid (3)0.71 ± 0.090.32 ± 0.031.0 mm4,4′-diisothiocyanostilbene-2,2′-disulfonic acid (3)0.83 ± 0.070.38 ± 0.03 Open table in a new tab The microsomal GSH transport was bi-directional. After 15 min of incubation in the presence of GSH (5 mm), microsomes were precipitated with polyethylene glycol and were taken up in a GSH-free buffer. GSH release was detected as the decrease of its intravesicular content; the measurements indicated that GSH could leave the lumen of microsomes with a rate comparable with that of influx and flufenamic acid was inhibitory also on the efflux (Fig.4). GSSG produced by the intraluminal oxidation of GSH could hardly exit from the vesicles (Fig. 4); the half-time of the efflux was eventually longer than 1 h (data not shown). In this study, we demonstrate that GSH is the preferentially transported form of glutathione in the hepatic endoplasmic reticulum. The features of the transport meet the requirements of a facilitative transport process: it is bi-directional, time-, concentration-, and protein-dependent, saturable, and inhibitable. On the other hand, the very slow permeation of GSSG can be regarded as simple diffusion; the influx and efflux of GSSG are slower than those of sucrose, which is widely used as a nonpermeant test compound for the investigation of the integrity of microsomal membrane. Our results are in contradiction with the conclusion of previous reports indicating the preferential transport of GSSG (2Hwang C. Sinskey A.J. Lodish H.F. Science. 1992; 257: 1496-1502Crossref PubMed Scopus (1598) Google Scholar, 4Söling H.-D. Weilandt A. Wasmuth M. Keppler D. Jungermann K. Transport in the Liver, Falk Symposium 74. Kluwer Academic Publisher, Dordrecht1994: 127-136Google Scholar). This discrepancy can be due to the differences in the preparation of microsomes. In one of the studies (2Hwang C. Sinskey A.J. Lodish H.F. Science. 1992; 257: 1496-1502Crossref PubMed Scopus (1598) Google Scholar), microsomes were prepared and stored in reducing buffer (i.e. in the presence of 1 mm dithiothreitol). The permeability of the microsomal membranes to other low molecular mass compounds was not presented. A possible interpretation might be that an increased nonspecific permeability together with mixed disulfide formation between the reduced microsomal proteins and added GSSG led to the underestimation of GSH and overestimation of GSSG transport. The other study (4Söling H.-D. Weilandt A. Wasmuth M. Keppler D. Jungermann K. Transport in the Liver, Falk Symposium 74. Kluwer Academic Publisher, Dordrecht1994: 127-136Google Scholar) cannot be reconciled with our results due to shortage of data. However, in these reports, the intravesicular GSH and GSSG pools were not directly detected. The major novelties of the present report are (i) the estimation of these intravesicular pools, (ii) the use of alamethicin to distinguish the uptake and binding, and (iii) demonstration of the bi-directional feature of the transport. Our results, gained by two different methods, are consonant. Although the relatively long time required for the precipitation-sedimentation method might allow a partial efflux of the transported compound, the real time detection of the transport with the light scattering technique rules out the possible fast efflux of the investigated compound (especially GSSG) during the washing procedure. GSH taken up by microsomal vesicles was partially oxidized in the lumen. Because the oxidation was restricted to the early phase of the uptake, it can be attributed to a thiol-disulfide exchange with protein disulfides present in the lumen rather than a continuous oxidation. As for the transport system(s) involved in the permeability of ER to GSH, it appears to meet the feature of a facilitate transport,i.e. there is no energy requirement; it is saturable, bi-directional, and inhibitable. The inhibitors used here, however, do not allow a more precise characterization because they are known to be active on the transport of various anionic compounds (14Fulceri R. Bellomo G. Gamberucci A. Scott H.M. Burchell A. Benedetti A. Biochem. J. 1992; 286: 813-817Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 23Cousin J.L. Motais R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1982; 687: 147-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Because the transporters of ER have not been completely characterized both functionally and structurally, suggestions cannot be made on the basis of analogies. In summary, the primary source of the oxidizing environment in the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum is not the preferential GSSG transport. The intraluminal GSH/GSSG ratio can be generated by the retention of GSSG derived from GSH imported into the ER. GSSG can be formed in the lumen either by GSH-dependent reduction of imported dehydroascorbate (3Bánhegyi G. Marcolongo P. Puskás F. Fulceri R. Mandl J. Benedetti A. J. Biol.

Recent studies on the β2-adrenergic receptor have demonstrated that β-arrestin also targets the receptors to clathrin-coated pits for subsequent internalization and activation of mitogen-activated protein kinases. We and others have previously shown that muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (mAChRs) of the m1, m3, and m4 subtype require functional dynamin to sequester into HEK-293 tsA201 cells, whereas m2 mAChRs sequester in a dynamin-independent manner. To investigate the role of β-arrestin in mAChR sequestration, we determined the effect of overexpressing β-arrestin-1 and the dominant-negative inhibitor of β-arrestin-mediated receptor sequestration, β-arrestin-1 V53D, on mAChR sequestration and function. Sequestration of m1, m3, and m4 mAChRs was suppressed by 60–75% in cells overexpressing β-arrestin-1 V53D, whereas m2 mAChR sequestration was affected by less than 10%. In addition, overexpression of β-arrestin-1 V53D as well as dynamin K44A significantly suppressed m1 mAChR-mediated activation of mitogen-activated protein kinases. Finally, we investigated whether mAChRs sequester into clathrin-coated vesicles by overexpressing Hub, a dominant-negative clathrin mutant. Although sequestration of m1, m3, and m4 mAChRs was inhibited by 50–70%, m2 mAChR sequestration was suppressed by less than 10%. We conclude that m1, m3, and m4 mAChRs expressed in HEK-293 tsA201 cells sequester into clathrin-coated vesicles in a β-arrestin- and dynamin-dependent manner, whereas sequestration of m2 mAChRs in these cells is largely independent of these proteins.

Exposure of many G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) 1The abbreviations used are: GPCR, G protein-coupled receptor; mAChR, muscarinic acetylcholine receptor; MAP, mitogen-activated protein; NMS, N-methylscopolamineto their agonists results within seconds to minutes in attenuation of receptor responsiveness. An important step in this process of receptor desensitization is the rapid phosphorylation of agonist-bound receptors by G protein-coupled receptor kinases (1Krupnick J.G. Benovic J.L. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1998; 38: 289-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (857) Google Scholar). These kinases phosphorylate serine and threonine residues located in the third cytoplasmic loop (i.e. m1 and m2 muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (mAChRs)) (2Haga K. Kameyama K. Haga T. Kikkawa U.

Pitcher J.A. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13796-13803Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). After phosphorylation, cytosolic β-arrestins bind with increased affinity to the receptors and sterically inhibit further coupling of the receptors with G proteins (1Krupnick J.G. Benovic J.L. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1998; 38: 289-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (857) Google Scholar). To date, two β-arrestin isoforms, β-arrestin-1 (arrestin 2) and β-arrestin-2 (arrestin 3) have been identified, each undergoing alternative splicing (1Krupnick J.G. Benovic J.L. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1998; 38: 289-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (857) Google Scholar). Both isoforms are ubiquitously expressed, with β-arrestin-1 being the major β-arrestin expressed in many tissues (1Krupnick J.G. Benovic J.L. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1998; 38: 289-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (857) Google Scholar). Recent evidence indicates that β-arrestins do not only bind to GPCRs but also associate with nanomolar affinity with clathrin heavy chains and target β-arrestin-bound GPCRs to the clathrin-coated pits, leading to receptor internalization (5Ferguson S.S.G. Downey W.E. Colapietro A.-M. Barak L.S. Ménard L. Caron M.G. Science. 1996; 271: 363-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (846) Google Scholar, 6Goodman Jr., O.B. Krupnick J.G. Santini F. Gurevich V.V. Penn R.B. Gagnon A.W. Keen J.H. Benovic J.L. Nature. 1996; 383: 447-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (1170) Google Scholar). This process has been particularly well studied for the β2-adrenergic receptors. Overexpression of β-arrestin-1 or β-arrestin-2 in the presence of sufficient G protein-coupled receptor kinases augments internalization of β2-adrenergic receptors, whereas overexpression of the dominant-negative β-arrestin-1 V53D mutant, which binds with high affinity to clathrin cages but is significantly impaired in its ability to interact with β2-adrenergic receptors, suppresses β2-adrenergic receptor internalization (5Ferguson S.S.G.

The budding of clathrin-coated vesicles from the plasma membrane into the cytosol is catalyzed by the monomeric G protein dynamin. This protein oligomerizes at the neck of the invaginated clathrin-coated pits and pinches off the pits from the plasma membrane (10Van der Bliek A.M. Redelmeier T.E. Damke H. Tisdale E.J. Meyerowitz E.M. Schmid S.L. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 553-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (589) Google Scholar). Overexpression of the dominant-negative dynamin mutant K44A, which is not able to bind guanine nucleotides, effectively blocks β2-adrenergic receptor internalization, indicating that β2-adrenergic receptors sequester into clathrin-coated vesicles in an arrestin- and dynamin-dependent manner (8Zhang J. Ferguson S.S.G. Barak L.S. Ménard L. Caron M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18302-18305Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar). The primary function of internalization of the β2-adrenergic receptors is to allow resensitization of desensitized receptors in endosomes before their return to the plasma membrane (11Yu S.S.

Pharmacol. 1995; 47: 666-676PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, receptor internalization via clathrin-coated vesicles has recently been reported to be essential for β2-adrenergic receptor-induced activation of the mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase pathway (13Daaka Y.

The mAChRs have been subject of a large number of studies on the regulation of GPCRs by G protein-coupled receptor kinases and β-arrestins as well (1Krupnick J.G. Benovic J.L. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1998; 38: 289-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (857) Google Scholar). In contrast to β2-adrenergic receptors, which couple predominantly to G proteins of the Gs family, mAChRs efficiently activate G proteins of the Gi and Gq family. The family of mAChRs consists of five mammalian subtypes, with m1, m3, and m5 mAChRs predominantly activating phospholipase C via Gq proteins and m2 and m4 mAChRs efficiently inhibiting adenylyl cyclase by activation of Gi proteins. We and others have recently shown that the monomeric GTPase dynamin is essential for internalization of m1, m3, and m4 mAChRs in HEK-293 cells, whereas internalization of the m2 mAChRs is dynamin-independent (14Vögler O.

These results indicate that m1, m3, and m4 mAChRs sequester by a dynamin-dependent trafficking pathway, probably similar as used by β2-adrenergic receptors. Previous studies have shown that β-arrestins can interact with peptide sequences derived from the third intracellular loop of the m2 and m3 mAChRs in vitro(16Pals-Rylaarsdam R. Gurevich V.V. Lee K.B.

By analogy on the regulation of internalization of β2-adrenergic receptors, we hypothesized that β-arrestins are essential for the internalization of mAChR subtypes as well. In this study, we overexpressed the dominant-negative β-arrestin-1 mutant V53D in HEK-293 tsA201 cells and examined the effect on m1, m2, m3, and m4 mAChR sequestration. In addition, we investigated, using β-arrestin-1 V53D and dynamin K44A as inhibitors of clathrin-mediated endocytosis, whether receptor sequestration is required for m1 mAChR-mediated MAP kinase activation.

Rabbit anti-ERK1 antibody (C-16), mouse anti-T7 Tag antibody, and rabbit anti-phosphospecific p44/p42 MAP kinase antibody were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Novagen, and New England Biolabs, respectively. The goat peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse and goat peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit antibodies were obtained from Dianova (Hamburg) and Sigma, respectively. HEK-293 tsA201 cells (25Margolskee R.F. McHendry-Rinde B. Horn R. Biotechniques. 1993; 15: 906-911PubMed Google Scholar) were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, penicillin G (100 units/ml), and streptomycin (100 μg/ml) in an atmosphere of 5% CO2. Cell media were from Life Technologies, Inc. Cells on 150-mm plates were transfected with either 12.5 μg (m1, m3) or 25 μg (m2, m4) of pCD-PS containing mAChR DNA, together with 15 μg of pBC/β-arrestin-1, pcDNA-1 Amp/β-arrestin-1 V53D, pcDNA3/β-arrestin-1 (319–418), or control vector (pRK5) using the calcium phosphate method. In some experiments, cells were transfected with 150 μg instead of 25 μg of pCD-PS/m2 mAChR to increase m2 mAChR expression from ∼200 to ∼800 fmol/mg of protein. Cells on 150-mm plates were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline (150 mm NaCl, 2.7 mmKCl, 1.5 mm KH2PO4, 6.5 mm Na2HPO4, pH 7.4) and lysed by the addition of 1.0 ml of lysis buffer (1% SDS, 10 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.4). Lysate was transferred to a microcentrifuge tube and boiled for 5 min. After 5 passages through a 25-gauge needle, samples were centrifuged for 5 min to remove insoluble material and diluted with lysis buffer to an equal amount of protein as measured by the BCA method (Pierce). One hundred μl of electrophoresis sample buffer (250 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 4% SDS, 10% glycerol, 0.006% bromphenol blue, 2% 2-mercaptoethanol) were added to 100 μl of the diluted samples and boiled for another 5 min. After SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis on 10% polyacrylamide gels, protein was blotted onto nitrocellulose. Nitrocellulose was then blocked with 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20, and 5% bovine serum albumin (Fraction V, Sigma). After washing three times for 5 min in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20, the blot was incubated with mouse anti-arrestin monoclonal antibody (diluted 1: 2000) or mouse anti-T7 Tag monoclonal antibody (0.1 μg/ml) in blocking buffer for 1 h. After three washes for 5 min, the blot was incubated with peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibody (0.16 μg/ml) at room temperature. After 1 h, the blot was washed again, and immunoreactivity was visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Fourty-eight h after transfection, HEK-293 tsA201 cells on 100-mm plates were serum-starved overnight in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F12 medium before stimulation with 10 μm carbachol or 1 μm phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate. After stimulation for 5 min at 37 °C, cells were lysed in 0.5 ml of lysis buffer and processed as described above. After SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis on 10% polyacrylamide gels, phosphorylated MAP kinases on nitrocellulose filters were detected using a rabbit anti-phosphospecific MAP kinase antibody (diluted 1: 1000) and goat peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit antibody (diluted 1:5000). Expression of the total amount of MAP kinases was detected by incubation of nitrocellulose blots with rabbit anti-ERK1 antibody (0.1 μg/ml), which recognizes p44 and p42 MAP kinases, and goat peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit antibody (diluted 1:5000). Immunoreactivity was visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence. As described before (14Vögler O. Bogatkewitsch G.S. Wriske C. Krummenerl P. Jakobs K.H. Van Koppen C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12155-12160Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), 24 h after transfection, cells from 150-mm plates were replated on poly-l-lysine-coated 24-well plates and allowed to reattach and grow for another 24 h. The cells were then incubated with and without carbachol for 0–60 min in 25 mm HEPES-buffered Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 medium. For each manipulation, 6 wells of cells were taken. After washing with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, cells were incubated with 2 nm[3H]NMS in 500 μl of ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline with and without 30 μm atropine to measure total and nonspecific binding, respectively. After 4 h of incubation at 4 °C, cells were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, solubilized in 1% Triton X-100, scraped, and transferred into scintillation vials, which received 3.5 ml of scintillation fluid before radioactivity counting. Sequestration is expressed as (1 − quotient of cell surface receptors of carbachol-treated and untreated cells) × 100%. Untransfected HEK-293 tsA201 do not express detectable levels of mAChR. Western blot analysis demonstrated equal overexpression of β-arrestin-1 and β-arrestin-1 V53D in HEK-293 tsA201 cells transiently transfected with the expression vector encoding either β-arrestin (Fig.1 A). In the absence of overexpressed β-arrestins, agonist stimulation led to significant internalization of m1 mAChRs (Fig. 1 B). A 10-min incubation with 1 mm carbachol reduced cell surface receptor number by 21 ± 4%, with 35 ± 2 and 38 ± 3% of receptors internalized after 30 min and 60 min of incubation, respectively. Overexpression of β-arrestin-1 modestly increased the extent of m1 mAChR sequestration. After 10 min of incubation with 1 mmcarbachol, m1 mAChRs were sequestered by 27 ± 4%, and after 60 min of incubation, by 45 ± 3%. An increase in m1 mAChR sequestration of similar magnitude was observed at a lower carbachol concentration of 10 μm carbachol (Fig. 1 C). Overexpression of β-arrestin-1, however, did not appear to decrease the EC50 value of carbachol for inducing m1 mAChR internalization. In contrast to wild-type β-arrestin-1, β-arrestin-1 V53D significantly suppressed m1 mAChR sequestration. Receptor sequestration in β-arrestin-1 V53D-overexpressing cells was only 19 ± 3% after 60 min of incubation with 1 mmcarbachol. Furthermore, inhibition of m1 mAChR sequestration was evident at lower concentrations of carbachol as well. Incubation of control cells with 10 μm carbachol for 60 min led to a 23 ± 3% loss of cell surface receptor number, whereas receptor sequestration in β-arrestin-1 V53D-overexpressing cells was only 6 ± 2%. Daaka et al. (13Daaka Y. Luttrell L.M. Ahn S. Della Rocca G.J. Ferguson S.S.G. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 685-688Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar) recently demonstrated that overexpression of β-arrestin-1 V53D or dynamin K44A in HEK-293 cells inhibits activation of MAP kinases by β2-adrenergic receptors and lysophosphatidic acid receptors, suggesting that receptor internalization into clathrin-coated vesicles is required for receptor-mediated activation of MAP kinase. As m1 mAChRs appear to internalize by the same β-arrestin- and dynamin-dependent internalization pathway as utilized by β2-adrenergic receptors, we examined the effect of overexpressing β-arrestin-1 V53D and dynamin K44A on m1 mAChR-mediated activation of MAP kinase. As shown in Fig. 2, pCD-PS/m1 mAChR-transfected cells showed a significant increase in phosphorylated p42 and p44 MAP kinases in response to stimulation with 10 μm carbachol for 5 min (left panel). Co-expression of β-arrestin-1 V53D (middle panel) or dynamin K44A (right panel) significantly reduced carbachol-induced phosphorylation of the MAP kinases. In accordance with the study of Daaka et al. (13Daaka Y. Luttrell L.M. Ahn S. Della Rocca G.J. Ferguson S.S.G. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 685-688Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar), overexpression of β-arrestin-1 V53D or dynamin K44A did not alter phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate-induced MAP kinase stimulation. As shown in Fig. 3, overexpression of β-arrestin-1 V53D only marginally inhibited m2 mAChR sequestration, whereas m2 mAChR sequestration was only modestly stimulated by overexpression of wild-type β-arrestin-1. Comparison of the extent of receptor sequestration after 60 min of incubation with 10 μm and 0.1 μm carbachol showed that overexpression of either β-arrestin was without any significant effect on m2 mAChR sequestration at lower carbachol concentrations either (results not shown). However, under conditions of higher m2 mAChR expression (i.e. 737 ± 79 versus112 ± 22 fmol/mg of protein), overexpression of wild-type β-arrestin-1 significantly augmented m2 mAChR internalization. After 60 min of incubation with 10 μm and 1 mmcarbachol, m2 mAChR internalization in control cells was 24 ± 9 and 22 ± 8%, whereas in β-arrestin-1-transfected cells, m2 mAChR internalized by 43 ± 9 and 51 ± 3%, respectively (mean ±S.E., n = 6–9 independent experiments). In contrast to the m2 mAChRs, sequestration of m3 and m4 mAChRs, which like m1 mAChRs sequester in a dynamin-dependent manner (14Vögler O. Bogatkewitsch G.S. Wriske C. Krummenerl P. Jakobs K.H.

Chem. 1998; 273: 12967-12972Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), was β-arrestin-dependent. As depicted in Fig.4, overexpression of β-arrestin-1 V53D inhibited m3 and m4 mAChR sequestration by 68 and 64%, respectively, after 60 min of incubation with 1 mm carbachol. Overexpression of wild-type β-arrestin-1 had no (significant) stimulatory effect on the maximal extent of sequestration of either receptor subtype. In addition to investigating the effect of overexpressing β-arrestin-1 V53D, we also examined the influence of another dominant-negative inhibitor of β-arrestin-mediated receptor sequestration, β-arrestin-1 (319–418). Overexpression of β-arrestin-1 (319–418) reduced sequestration of m1, m3, and m4 mAChRs from 43 ± 4, 40 ± 2, and 47 ± 3% to 6 ± 4, 13 ± 2, and 12 ± 2%, respectively, following 60 min of incubation with 1 mm carbachol (mean ±S.E.,n = 6–8 independent experiments). Two recent studies have indicated that dynamin not only catalyzes the budding of clathrin-coated vesicles but of caveolae as well (26Henley J.R. Krueger E.W.A. Oswald B.J. McNiven M.A. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 85-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (624) Google Scholar, 27Oh P. McIntosh D.P. Schnitzer J.E. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 101-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (555) Google Scholar). To directly test whether m1, m3, and m4 mAChRs sequester into clathrin-coated vesicles, we took advantage of the recent availability of a dominant-negative form of clathrin, termed Hub (24Liu S.-H. Marks M.S. Brodsky F.M. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 1023-1037Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Hub comprises the carboxyl-terminal third of the clathrin heavy chain (residues 1073–1675) and specifically blocks clathrin-mediated endocytosis by depletion of clathrin light chains, causing clathrin-coated pits to be frozen at the plasma membrane. Transfection of HEK-293 tsA201 cells with pCDM8 containing T7 epitope-tagged Hub led to a large expression of Hub (Fig. 5 A). Expression of Hub caused a 50–70% inhibition of m1, m3, and m4 mAChR sequestration. In contrast, sequestration of m2 mAChRs was not affected (Fig. 5 B). In the present study, we determined the role of β-arrestin in mAChR sequestration and function using β-arrestin-1 wild type and the dominant-negative inhibitor of β-arrestin-mediated receptor sequestration, β-arrestin-1 V53D. This β-arrestin-1 mutant was chosen for its increased ability to interact with clathrin and its impaired capacity to bind to agonist-bound phosphorylated GPCRs (9Zhang J. Barak L.S. Winkler K.E.

Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32507-32512Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Overexpression of β-arrestin-1 V53D suppressed sequestration of m1, m3, and m4 mAChRs in HEK-293 tsA201 cells by 60–75%, indicating that these mAChR subtypes sequester predominantly in a β-arrestin-dependent manner. On the other hand, overexpression of β-arrestin-1 wild type only slightly stimulated m1, m3, and m4 mAChR internalization. The small magnitude of stimulation may be related to the possibility that other downstream partners involved in receptor internalization are rate-limiting, so additional β-arrestin is hardly able to promote receptor internalization further. In line with our observation that m1, m3, and m4 mAChR sequester in a β-arrestin-dependent manner, overexpression of Hub, a dominant-negative clathrin mutant (24Liu S.-H. Marks M.S. Brodsky F.M. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 1023-1037Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), significantly blocked sequestration of m1, m3, and m4 mAChRs. These data lend strong support to the hypothesis that m1, m3, and m4 mAChRs utilize the same sequestration pathway as β2-adrenergic receptors in HEK-293 cells. Our findings are consistent with immunocytochemical and biochemical studies on the internalization of m1, m3, and m4 mAChRs in a number of cells including HEK-293 cells. In these studies, internalized m1 mAChRs were found to colocalize with clathrin (28Tolbert L.M. Lameh J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17335-17342Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), or perturbation of clathrin distribution inhibited m3 and m4 mAChR internalization (29Slowiejko D.M. McEwen E.L. Ernst S.A. Fisher S.K. J. Neurochem. 1996; 66: 186-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 30Bogatkewitsch G.S. Lenz W. Jakobs K.H. Van Koppen C.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 50: 424-429PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, m2 mAChR sequestration was hardly affected by overexpression of wild-type β-arrestin-1, β-arrestin-1 V53D, or Hub under conditions of low m2 mAChR expression levels (i.e. 0.1–0.2 pmol/mg of protein). At higher levels of receptor expression (i.e. ∼0.75 pmol/mg of protein), overexpression of wild-type β-arrestin-1 strongly stimulated m2 mAChR sequestration in HEK-293 tsA201 cells, in accordance with a previous study by Pals-Rylaarsdam et al. (16Pals-Rylaarsdam R. Gurevich V.V. Lee K.B. Ptasienski J.A. Benovic J.L. Hosey M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23682-23689Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). These results suggest that at low m2 mAChR levels, the endogeneous internalization components are in excess over the number of m2 mAChRs, and the receptors sequester via the β-arrestin- and dynamin-independent pathway. At higher levels of receptor expression, the capacity of this internalization pathway becomes saturated and its components become rate-limiting, so overexpressed β-arrestin now supports sequestration of m2 mAChRs by the other, less efficient β-arrestin- and dynamin-dependent pathway in HEK-293 tsA201 cells (16Pals-Rylaarsdam R. Gurevich V.V. Lee K.B. Ptasienski J.A. Benovic J.L. Hosey M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23682-23689Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). During the course of this study, Lee et al. (15Lee K.B. Pals-Rylaarsdam R. Benovic J.L. Hosey M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12967-12972Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) reported that overexpression of another β-arrestin-1 mutant, termed arrestin 2- (319–418), did not lead to inhibition of m1, m3, and m4 mAChR internalization in HEK-293 tsA201 cells, whereas internalization of β2-adrenergic receptors was significantly suppressed. This β-arrestin mutant, which encodes the last 100 amino acids of β-arrestin-1 as the major clathrin binding determinants, binds weakly to phosphorylated agonist-activated GPCRs and blocks internalization via clathrin-coated vesicles as well (6Goodman Jr., O.B. Krupnick J.G. Santini F. Gurevich V.V. Penn R.B. Gagnon A.W. Keen J.H. Benovic J.L. Nature. 1996; 383: 447-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (1170) Google Scholar). In our study, however, β-arrestin-1 (319–418) significantly blocked sequestration of m1, m3, and m4 mAChRs. A possible explanation for this discordance may be that in the aforementioned study, expression of β-arrestin-1 (319–418) was insufficient to block interaction of mAChR-bound β-arrestin-1 to clathrin, whereas β2-adrenergic receptor internalization was effectively inhibited. In this respect, it is important to note that the degree of competition between β-arrestin-1 and β-arrestin-1 (319–418) for binding clathrin is related to the difference in binding affinity of the β-arrestins for clathrin. Because the G protein-coupled receptor kinase phosphorylation sites on the mAChRs and β2-adrenergic receptor are located differently (2Haga K. Kameyama K. Haga T. Kikkawa U. Shiozaki K. Uchiyama H.

Chem. 1996; 271: 13796-13803Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar), the binding affinity of β-arrestin for clathrin may in part be determined by the receptor species as well. In any event, our study definitively renews interest in the role of β-arrestin in mAChR internalization, which was called into question by the report of Lee et al. (15Lee K.B. Pals-Rylaarsdam R. Benovic J.L. Hosey M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12967-12972Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). In the present study, we observed that overexpression of β-arrestin-1 V53D and dynamin K44A blocks m1 mAChR-mediated activation of MAP kinase in HEK-293 cells. These results further corroborate the idea that m1, m3, and m4 mAChRs in HEK-293 cells sequester by the same clathrin-mediated sequestration pathway as is used by β2-adrenergic receptors (1Krupnick J.G. Benovic J.L. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1998; 38: 289-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (857) Google Scholar). It has been proposed that the agonist-occupied, β-arrestin-bound GPCR is actually part of a multisignaling complex assembled at the plasma membrane, which includes not only the receptor but various intermediates including active Raf kinase and which is internalized by the clathrin-coated vesicle pathway to activate cytosolic MAP kinase (13Daaka Y.

Thus, receptor sequestration and recycling is not only required to regulate mAChR responsiveness (30Bogatkewitsch G.S. Lenz W. Jakobs K.H. Van Koppen C.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 50: 424-429PubMed Google Scholar, 31Yang J. Williams J.A. Yule D.I. Logsdon C.D. Mol. Pharmacol. 1995; 48: 477-485PubMed Google Scholar, 32Szekeres P.G. Koenig J.A. Edwardson J.M. J. Neurochem. 1998; 70: 1694-1703Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) but also, at least in the case of m1 mAChRs, for activation of the MAP kinase cascade in HEK-293 cells. In summary, the present study demonstrates an important role for β-arrestin (or a β-arrestin-like protein) in the internalization of m1, m3, and m4 mAChRs in HEK-293 tsA201 cells. The lack of effect of β-arrestin V53D overexpression on the internalization of m2 mAChRs suggests that desensitization of m2 mAChRs can be β-arrestin-independent as well. Wu et al. (17Wu G. Krupnick J.G. Benovic J.L. Lanier S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17836-17842Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar) recently showed that a peptide sequence derived from the third cytoplasmic loop of m2 mAChRs and containing the G protein-coupled receptor kinase phosphorylation sites and a putative β-arrestin binding site (16Pals-Rylaarsdam R.

Chem. 1997; 272: 23682-23689Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar) does not bind β-arrestins derived from an enriched brain cytosol fraction, whereas a peptide sequence from the third cytoplasmic loop of m3 mAChRs is able to do so (17Wu G. Krupnick J.G. Benovic J.L. Lanier S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17836-17842Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). As the m2 receptor peptide sequence was able to bind to purified β-arrestins, perhaps there are other cytosolic proteins that preferentially bind to the m2 mAChR and effectively compete with β-arrestin. Like the β-arrestins, association of these unidentified proteins to the m2 mAChR might uncouple the receptor from its cognate G proteins and target the m2 mAChR to the clathrin-independent internalization pathway. It is, however, noteworthy, that m2 mAChRs (and the other mAChR subtypes likely as well) can use alternative sequestration pathways, dependent on the cell species involved (14Vögler O.

https://openalex.org/W2156807398,"The p53 tumour suppressor is frequently inactivated in human tumours. One form of inactivation results from overexpression of MDM2, that normally forms a negative auto-regulatory loop with p53 and inhibits its activity through complex formation. We have investigated whether disrupting the MDM2-p53 complex in cells that overexpress MDM2 is sufficient to trigger p53 mediated cell death. We find that expression of a peptide homologue of p53 that binds to MDM2 leads to increased p53 levels and transcriptional activity. The consequences are increased expression of the downstream effectors MDM2 and p21WAF1/CIP1, inhibition of colony formation, cell cycle arrest and cell death. There is also a decrease in E2F activity, that might have been due to the known physical and functional interactions of MDM2 with E2F1/DP1. However, this decrease is p53 dependent, as are also colony formation, cell cycle arrest and cell death. These results show that a peptide homologue of p53 is sufficient to induce p53 dependent cell death in cells overexpressing MDM2, and support the notion that disruption of the p53-MDM2 complex is a target for the development of therapeutic agents."

We demonstrate that both TGFbeta and bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) can induce endogenous Smad1 phosphorylation in intestinal epithelial cells (IECs). The combination of transient expression of RSmad1 and TGFbeta treatment had an additive effect on induction of the TGFbeta-responsive reporter 3TP-lux. Either inactivation of Ras by stable, inducible expression of a dominant-negative mutant of Ras (RasN17) or addition of MAP and ERK kinase (MEK) inhibitor PD98059 to cells significantly decreased the ability of both TGFbeta and BMP to induce phosphorylation of endogenous Smad1 in IECs. Moreover, either inactivation of Ras or addition of PD98059 to IEC 4-1 cells inhibited the ability of RSmad1 to regulate 3TP luciferase activity in both the presence and absence of TGFbeta. Collectively, our data indicate that TGFbeta can regulate RSmad1 function in epithelial cells, and that the Ras/MEK pathway is partially required for TGFbeta-mediated regulation of RSmad1."

Our present results suggest that the two NBDs of CFTR have different nucleotide occlusion characteristics, and only the occlusion in the C-terminal NBD2 requires vanadate. According to these data, although the formation of an occluded nucleotide can occur in both NBDs, the N-terminal NBD1 seems to have a rate-limiting role in the full ATP hydrolysis cycle. These results may significantly help our understanding of the molecular mechanism and regulation of the CFTR protein. 8-Azido-[α-32P]ATP (666 GBq/mm) was obtained from ICN Biomedicals.

The proteins were electroblotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, and the blots were dried and subjected to autoradiography in a phosphoimager (Bio-Rad). The identity of the 32P-azido-nucleotide-labeled bands was assured by immunostaining on the same blot. Isolated Sf9 cell membranes (100–200 μg of protein) were subjected to nucleotide occlusion as described above, and the labeled nucleotides were covalently bound to CFTR by UV irradiation. The samples were treated with different amounts of trypsin (1, 5, or 10 μg/ml) for 1, 2, 5, or 10 min at 4 °C, in a reaction buffer containing 40 mm MOPS-Tris, pH 7.0, 50 mm KCl, 0.5 mm EGTA, 2 mmdithiothreitol.

Fig. 1 demonstrates the expression of CFTR in Sf9 cell membranes and the nucleotide occlusion of this protein from 8-azido-[α-32P]ATP. As shown earlier (28Sarkadi B. Bauzon D. Huckle J.R. Earp H.S.

It has been documented that CFTR expressed in Sf9 cells is phosphorylated by endogenous protein kinases and produces active chloride channels without further kinase action (see Refs. 31Gabriel S.E.

In parallel patch-clamp experiments we could reproduce the described channel forming properties of the CFTR expressed in our baculovirus-Sf9 cell system. 2S. E. Gabriel, M. J. Stutts, and T. Hegedűs, unpublished data. In the experiments shown in Fig. 1, isolated Sf9 cell membranes were incubated for 2 min at 37 °C with 5 μm8-azido-[α-32P]ATP, in the presence of various additions as indicated in the figure legend. The membranes were washed twice in the dark in ice-cold solutions containing 10 mmMgATP, and the collected membrane fragments were irradiated by UV light after these washing steps. SDS-gel electrophoresis was applied to separate the 32P-labeled bands (Fig. 1 A), and immunoblotting (Fig. 1 B) was used to identify the CFTR protein. As shown in Fig. 1 A, a significant amount of 32P labeling was observed in CFTR even after washing the membranes in high ATP-containing cold buffers before photo cross-linking. Only a very small amount of 8-azido-nucleotide occlusion could be observed in the corresponding region of β-galactosidase expressing Sf9 cell membranes, while a nonspecific labeling occurred in all membrane preparations at about 120 kDa (see later). Nucleotide occlusion in CFTR was abolished by excess (1 mm) MgATP, but not by 1 mm MgAMP. This occlusion required the presence of Mg2+ (addition of EDTA blocked 32P labeling), and preincubation of the isolated membranes with 200 μm N-ethylmaleimide, a covalent SH-group reagent, strongly inhibited this reaction (see Fig. 1 A). Nucleotide occlusion also required at least 2 min of incubation at 37 °C (there was no significant occlusion at 4 °C), while washings at 37 °C instead of 4 °C resulted in the loss of labeling (data not shown). These data indicate that the occluded nucleotide in CFTR is formed in a Mg2+-dependent partial reaction of the temperature-dependent ATPase cycle of this protein. Fig. 2 demonstrates the effect of sodium orthovanadate on 8-azido-α-32P-nucleotide occlusion in the human CFTR and MDR1 proteins, expressed in Sf9 cell membranes. As shown, nucleotide occlusion by CFTR was significantly increased (about doubled) in the presence of vanadate. In the control (β-galactosidase expressing) membranes there was very little labeling in the molecular mass range corresponding to CFTR, either in the presence or absence of vanadate. As mentioned above, in all Sf9 cell membrane preparations a vanadate-independent nucleotide occlusion was observed in a protein band of about 120 kDa, and a vanadate-dependent occlusion in a protein of about 180 kDa (see Figs. 1 and 2). These bands may correspond to endogenous ATP binding or hydrolyzing proteins in the Sf9 membranes, not detected by the human CFTR-specific antibodies. As shown in Fig. 2, it is important to note that nucleotide trapping in MDR1 could only be observed in the presence of vanadate (see also Refs. 23Senior A.E. Al-Shawi M.K. Urbatsch I.L. FEBS Lett. 1995; 377: 285-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar and 25Szabó K. Welker E. Bakos É. Müller M. Roninson I.B. Váradi A. Sarkadi B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10132-10138Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Preincubation with N-ethylmaleimide inhibited nucleotide occlusion in both the CFTR and MDR1 proteins (see Fig. 2). Both in CFTR and MDR1, vanadate-induced nucleotide occlusion required Mg2+ and was eliminated by 1 mm ATP and not by 1 mm AMP. Nucleotide occlusion in CFTR with or without sodium orthovanadate at 5 μm 8-azido-ATP only slightly increased when the incubation period at 37 °C was increased up to 10 min, and labeling showed an apparent saturation above 50 μm 8-azido-ATP (data not shown in detail). Nucleotide occlusion in MDR1 reflects a Mg2+-dependent and drug substrate-stimulated partial reaction of the ATPase cycle, with the formation of a transitory state intermediate that is not exchangeable by ATP or ADP (21Urbatsch I.L. Sankaran B. Weber J. Senior A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19383-19390Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar, 22Urbatsch I.L. Sankaran B. Bhagat S. Senior A.E. J. Biol.

Chem. 1998; 273: 10132-10138Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The absolute vanadate dependence of the nucleotide occlusion in MDR1 indicates that ATP hydrolysis by this protein is relatively fast, and only the full inhibiton of the ATPase cycle by this transitory state phosphate analog can stabilize a trapped nucleotide. As shown above, in contrast to MDR1, nucleotide occlusion in CFTR could be observed without vanadate, simply by cooling down the incubation medium after the formation of the occluded nucleotide at 37 °C. These results indicate that the overall rate of ATP hydrolysis by CFTR is much slower than by MDR1, but involves basically the same Mg2+-dependent transition state intermediate(s). In the following experiments we have examined the formation of the occluded nucleotides in the two different nucleotide binding domains of CFTR. In order to separate these domains, we performed limited proteolysis of the CFTR in the Sf9 cell membranes after the nucleotide occlusion was achieved and the labeled nucleotides were covalently bound to CFTR by UV irradiation. As shown in Fig. 3, in agreement with the data in the literature (see Ref. 35Gregory R.J. Cheng S.H. Rich D.P. Marshall J. Paul S. Hehir K. Ostedgaard L. Klinger K.W. Welsh M.J. Smith A.E. Nature. 1990; 347: 382-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar), a properly executed limited trypsin cleavage of CFTR yielded two major fragments. These represented the C-terminal (about 65 kDa) and the N-terminal (about 40–45 kDa) parts, each without the R-domain of CFTR. As identified by antibodies recognizing either the N-terminal part, the C-terminal part, or the R-domain of the CFTR, at shorter time intervals or lower trypsin concentration, fragments of both the C-terminal (about 80 kDa) and the N-terminal (about 65–75 kDa) halves, containing most of the R-domain, also appeared on the blots. Further trypsinolysis resulted in the formation of degraded C-terminal (about 35 kDa) and N-terminal (about 25 kDa) fragments as well (all these fragments are still slightly visible on the overexposed immunoblots shown in Fig.3 B). Fig. 3 A demonstrates that when nucleotide occlusion was performed in the presence of 5 μm8-azido-[α-32P]ATP and 2 mmMg2+, 32P labeling was observed only in the N-terminal half of CFTR that is in the region of NBD1. In contrast, when labeling and washings were performed in the presence of sodium orthovanadate, both halves of the CFTR were labeled, that is the C-terminal NBD(2) domain could also occlude adenine nucleotide. The absence of free Mg2+ or the addition ofN-ethylmaleimide eliminated labeling in both NBDs, and there were no corresponding labeled fragments in the β-galactosidase-expressing membranes (not shown). In the case of MDR1, an active drug pump, it has been established that the protein can bind two ATP molecules, while only one occluded ADP is formed. In MDR1, ATP hydrolysis and vanadate-dependent nucleotide occlusion in each NBD occur randomly, in an alternating way, with a cooperative but equivalent role of the two NBDs (21Urbatsch I.L.

The present experiments with CFTR suggest that the two NBDs of this protein have different catalytic properties. These studies do not allow as yet to estimate the number of occluded nucleotides or to establish their actual form (ATP or ADP). Still, they strongly indicate that in the presence of MgATP, the N-terminal NBD1 in the CFTR rapidly forms an occluded nucleotide, while the complete hydrolysis of ATP (with the release of ADP and inorganic phosphate) is a much slower process. In contrast, in the C-terminal NBD2 ATP hydrolysis and ADP release can be much faster, unless vanadate blocks this release by stabilizing the transition state of the enzyme. In contrast to MDR1, the amino acid sequences in the two NBDs of the CFTR are strikingly different, and this may be the basis of their different ATP hydrolyzing properties. A recent report indicated differences in the nucleotide binding features of the two NBDs of another ABC transporter, the ATP-dependent K+channel regulator SUR1 protein, and nucleotide occlusion by SUR1 could be observed even in the absence of Mg2+ and vanadate (37Ueda K. Inagaki N. Seino S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22983-22986Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). It is tempting to speculate that channel-forming or -regulating ABC transporters allow nucleotide occlusion for the production of a functionally effective conformational change, but prevent unnecessary, rapid ATP hydrolysis. Current models of CFTR function (13Senior A.E. Gadsby D.C. Semin. Cancer Biol. 1997; 8: 143-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar) indicate that the frequency of ATP hydrolysis in the N-terminal NBD1 determines how often the chloride channel opens, while the rate-limiting step in channel closing is the ATP hydrolysis in the C-terminal NBD2. These steps may involve consecutive or parallel reactions, and the co-operation of the two NBDs, probably modified by protein kinase phosphorylation, may have a key role (38Carson M.R. Travis S.M.

https://openalex.org/W1982349215,"PTEN/MMAC1 is a recently characterized tumor suppressor. A pseudogene derived from the human PTEN/MMAC1 phosphatase, ΨPTEN, has been reported. Recent analysis of the pseudogene revealed conflicting results about the expression of ΨPTEN. In this study, we show that the PTEN/MMAC1 pseudogene is actively transcribed in all cells and tissues examined. In some cases, pseudogene transcripts were found to represent as much as 70% of the total PTEN/MMAC1 RNA. As ΨPTEN is transcribed, there is a potential for misinterpretation of PTEN/MMAC1 mutations when RT – PCR techniques are used, as well as potential for a ΨPTEN-encoded translation product. Although we were unable to detect a pseudogene protein product in the cell lines examined, a baculovirus produced GST pseudogene fusion protein exhibited phosphatase activity comparable to wild type. The results of this study, taken together, indicate the potential complication of PTEN/MMAC1 molecular analysis caused by the expression of ΨPTEN."

The ubiquitin-proteasome pathway is known to play an essential role in the control of p27 protein expression (17Pagano M. Tam S.W. Theodoras A.M. Beer-Romero P. Sal G.D. Chau V. Yew P.R. Draetta G.F. Rolfe M. Science. 1995; 269: 682-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (1735) Google Scholar). CKIs may have important roles in the withdrawal of the cells from the cell cycle in the differentiation process. p21 and p27 are both shown to be induced during the differentiation process of certain cell types including muscle, neuronal, and hematopoietic cells and in some cases introduction of p21 or p27 into cognate precursor cells is shown to induce their differentiation (20Halevy O.

Also, the accumulation of CKIs has been shown in many terminally differentiated cells in mouse embryo (1Sherr C.J. Roberts J.M. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1149-1163Crossref PubMed Scopus (3221) Google Scholar). However, among the studies of mice deficient in CKIs, only p57 is shown to be essential for mouse embryogenesis, suggesting that p57 may have specific roles in mouse development that cannot be compensated by other CKIs (25Zhang P. Liegeois N.J. Wong C. Finegold M. Hou H. Thompson J.C. Silverman A. Harper J.W. DePinho R.A. Elledge S.J. Nature. 1997; 387: 151-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (657) Google Scholar, 26Yan Y. Frisen J. Lee M.H. Massague J. Barbacid M. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 973-983Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar). Developmental defects shown in p57 knockout mice include a cleft palate and abnormal endochondral ossification, attributable to increased apoptosis or proliferation at the expense of cell differentiation. In the present study, we sought to investigate the possible involvement of CKIs in the control of cell growth and differentiation of osteoblastic cells. Osteoblasts isolated from the calvaria of rat fetus are useful in an in vitro culture system for studying the mechanisms of osteoblast differentiation (27Owen T.A. Aronow M. Shalhoub V. Barone L.M. Wilming L. Tassinari M.S. Kennedy M.B. Pockwinse S. Lian J.B. Stein G.S. J. Cell. Physiol. 1990; 143: 420-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (1384) Google Scholar). By analyzing this system, we found that p57 is accumulated in cells starved by low serum. Growth stimulation of these cells by transforming growth factor β1 (TGFβ1) resulted in a dramatic decrease in p57. Further analysis using a set of proteasome inhibitors demonstrated that p57 was degraded through the proteasomal degradation pathway. Because TGFβ1 inhibits the differentiation of these cells, our findings suggest a possible involvement of p57 and its proteasomal degradation in the control of cell growth and differentiation of osteoblastic cells. Primary rat osteoblastic cells were isolated from calvariae of 21-day-old Sprague-Dawley rats embryos as described previously (28Ishizuya T. Yokose S. Hori M. Noda T. Suda T. Yoshiki S. Yamaguchi A. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 2961-2970Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). The cells were maintained in α-MEM containing 10% FCS and antibiotics. Cells at the second passage were used for all experiments. Rabbit antisera against mouse p27, p57, and CDK2 were raised against synthetic peptides corresponding to the C terminus of each protein. Anti-mouse p21 antibody was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). All antibodies cross-react efficiently with the respective rat homologs. Cells were plated in 6-well plastic dishes with α-MEM containing 10% FCS and were cultured in α-MEM containing 0.5% FCS for 72 h prior to the experiment. The cells were then treated with TGFβ1 (1 ng/ml) for the times indicated. Cells were rinsed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in 180 μl of Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm NaF, 5 mm EDTA, 5 mm EGTA, 2 mm sodium vanadate, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 mg/ml aprotinin, and 0.1% Nonidet P-40), and the lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 15,000 ×g for 5 min at 4 °C. For immunoblot analysis, the samples were separated on 9 or 12.5% SDS-PAGE. Western blotting was performed using an enhanced chemiluminescence detection system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). To investigate the amount of CDK2 bound to each of the CKIs, total cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with rabbit polyclonal antibodies against p27 and p57 or monoclonal antibody against p21. Briefly, 2 μl of antisera or 2 μg of a monoclonal antibody was added to 200 μg of total cell lysates and incubated for 2 h at 4 °C. The immunocomplexes were brought down with protein G-Sepharose beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and the pellets were washed four times with ice-cold Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer. The samples were separated on 12.5% SDS-PAGE and analyzed by immunoblots for CDK2, as described above. Immunoprecipitations with anti-CDK2 antibodies were performed as described above. Immunoprecipitates were then washed twice with kinase buffer (80 mm sodium β-glycerophosphate, pH 7.4, 20 mmEGTA, 15 mm Mg(OAc)2, and 1 mmdithiothreitol) and were mixed with 10 μl of kinase buffer containing 50 μm ATP, 1.25 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, and 1 μg of histone H1. The samples were incubated at 25 °C for 30 min, and the reactions were terminated by addition of 30 μl of Laemmli sample buffer. The samples were separated on 12.5% SDS-PAGE; the gel was dried and visualized by autoradiography. MG132 (Z-Leu-Leu-Leu-aldehyde) and Z-Leu-Leu-aldehyde (z-LL-H) were purchased from Peptide Institute, Inc. (Osaka, Japan). Lactacystin was purchased from Calbiochem (La Jolla, CA). Cells were treated for 8 h with MG132 at a final concentration of 2.5 μm and with lactacystin and z-LL-H at final concentrations of 20 μm. Mouse p57 was transcribed and translated from pCMX-mp57 using TNT rabbit reticulocyte lysate (Promega) with [35S]methionine. pCMX-mp57 was constructed by inserting a mouse p57 cDNA, which was generated by polymerase chain reaction using mouse embryo cDNA as a template, into a pCMX plasmid vector (29Umesono K. Murakami K.K. Thompson C.C. Evans R.M. Cell. 1991; 65: 1255-1266Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1497) Google Scholar). To 20 μl of each sample the following was added: 9 μl of 10× buffer (500 mmTris-HCl, 100 mm MgCl2, 5 mmdithiothreitol, 50 μm MG132, and 3 μg/ml ubiquitin-aldehyde (MBL, Nagoya, Japan), 9 μl of 10× ATP regenerating system (20 mm ATP, 100 mm creatine phosphate, 100 IU/ml creatine kinase, and 10 IU/ml inorganic pyrophosphatase) and 40 μl of cell extract (2.7 mg/ml) of TGF-β1-treated rat osteoblastic cells. For the GST-ubiquitin experiment, 40 μg of bacterially purified GST-ubiquitin, which was generously provided by F. Osaka (Kato Cytoprotein Network Project, Exploratory Research for Advanced Technology, Japan), was included in the reaction. The reaction mixtures were incubated at 37 °C, and 20-μl samples were taken at 0 and 3 h. The reaction was terminated by the addition of Laemmli sample buffer, and the samples were run on a 9% polyacrylamide gel, dried, and visualized by autoradiography. TGFβ1 has been shown to induce proliferation of osteoblastic cells isolated from the calvaria of rat embryos (30Centrella M. McCarthy T.L. Canalis E. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 2869-2874Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 31Robey P.G. Young M.F. Flanders K.C. Roche N.S. Kondaiah P. Reddi A.H. Termine J.D. Sporn M.B. Roberts A.B. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 457-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar). We examined the expressions of p21, p27, and p57 in this system to see if these CKIs are involved in the regulation. All three CKIs were expressed in osteoblastic cells serum-starved in α-MEM containing 0.5% FCS. Treatment of these cells with TGFβ1 for 24 h resulted in a 5-fold increase in [3H]thymidine incorporation (data not shown), which is consistent with previous reports (30Centrella M. McCarthy T.L. Canalis E. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 2869-2874Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 31Robey P.G. Young M.F. Flanders K.C. Roche N.S. Kondaiah P. Reddi A.H. Termine J.D. Sporn M.B. Roberts A.B. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 457-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar). The amount of p57 was dramatically decreased within the first 12 h, whereas some decrease was also seen in p21 and p27 expressions during the growth induction by TGFβ1 treatment (Fig.1). These results suggested that the decrease in the expressions of CKIs may have important roles in the growth stimulation of rat osteoblastic cells by TGFβ1. The Cip/Kip family proteins (p21, p27, and p57) control cell cycle progression by binding and inhibiting cyclin-CDK complexes, including cyclin E/A-CDK2 complexes (7Harper J.W. Adami G.R. Wei N.

Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 650-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (911) Google Scholar). Therefore, we examined the possible changes in the amount of CDK2 bound to each CKI before and after TGFβ1 stimulation (Fig.2 A). Before the TGFβ1 treatment, a significant amount of CDK2 was shown to be bound to p27 and p57 but not to p21. As expected, after growth stimulation by TGFβ1, a decreased amount of CDK2 bound to p27, and none to p57 nor p21 were seen in these cells. Also, the activity of CDK2 in these cells, as determined by phosphorylation of histone H1 with anti-CDK2 immunoprecipitates, was induced by TGFβ1 treatment (Fig.2 B). These results suggest that TGFβ1 stimulates the cell proliferation of osteoblastic cells by reducing the amounts of p57 and p27 and releasing CDK2 bound to the CKIs, which in turn results in the induction of CDK2 activities. Our data demonstrated that the dramatic reduction of p57 expression by the TGFβ1 may have important roles in the control of osteoblastic cell growth stimulation. Although little is known about the control of p57 expression, the related CKI, p27, has been shown to be controlled by the ubiquitin-proteasome degradation pathway (17Pagano M. Tam S.W. Theodoras A.M. Beer-Romero P. Sal G.D. Chau V. Yew P.R. Draetta G.F. Rolfe M. Science. 1995; 269: 682-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (1735) Google Scholar). Therefore, we tested whether the proteasomal degradation pathway is involved in the TGFβ1-induced decrease in p57. Addition of MG132, a proteasome and calpain inhibitor (32Traenckner E.B. Wilk S. Baeuerle P.A. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5433-5441Crossref PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar, 33Jensen T.J. Loo M.A. Pind S. Williams D.B. Goldberg A.L. Riordan J.R.

(Tokyo). 1996; 119: 572-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar), to the culture medium completely blocked the decrease in p57 protein by TGFβ1 treatment (Fig.3 A), suggesting the possible involvement of the proteasomal degradation pathway. To determine whether the effect of MG132 was through specific inhibition of the proteasome pathway, we further tested the effects of a calpain inhibitor, z-LL-H (34Tsubuki S. Saito Y. Tomioka M. Ito H. Kawashima S. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1996; 119: 572-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar), and a proteasome specific inhibitor, lactacystin (35Fenteany G. Standaert R.F. Lane W.S. Choi S. Corey E.J. Schreiber S.L. Science. 1995; 268: 726-731Crossref PubMed Scopus (1504) Google Scholar). p57 was shown to be stabilized by MG132 and lactacystin, whereas z-LL-H had no effect (Fig. 3 B). These results clearly indicated that p57 is degraded specifically through the proteasome pathway in the osteoblastic cells treated with TGFβ1. Ubiquitination is known to have important roles in the control of the porteasomal degradation pathway. Therefore, we tested whether p57 can also be modified by ubiquitination. p57 was prepared by in vitro translation in rabbit reticulocyte lysate and was incubated with an addition of osteoblast cell extract, with or without bacterially produced GST-ubiquitin (Fig. 4). After 3 h of incubation, in addition to slower migrating bands seen in both reactions that may correspond to the ubiquitinated p57, several distinct bands were seen in the sample incubated with GST-ubiquitin (Fig. 4, last lane). Of these, a 92-kDa band nicely corresponds to p57 covalently modified by one GST-ubiquitin, as GST-ubiquitin is approximately 35 kDa. The fact that these bands were only seen in the sample incubated with GST-ubiquitin indicated that the bands indeed represent GST-ubiquitinated p57s, which confirms that p57 can be ubiquitinated. TGFβ is thought to have important roles in bone remodeling. TGFβ is locally produced by osteoblasts and is accumulated abundantly in bone matrix tissue (31Robey P.G. Young M.F. Flanders K.C.

Physiol. 1994; 160: 323-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar), induction of cellular alkaline phosphatase activity, a bone phenotype marker that precedes the onset of mineralization, was inhibited during TGFβ1-induced stimulation of primary rat osteoblast proliferation in our experiments (data not shown). CKIs are shown to play important roles in the induction of cell differentiation (20Halevy O. Novitch B.G. Spicer D.B. Skapek S.X. Rhee J. Hannon G.J. Beach D. Lassar A.B.

EMBO J. 1997; 16: 306-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar); therefore, our results strongly suggest that p57 may also play an important role in regulating the differentiation procedure of osteoblasts. It is worth noting that among the gene knockout studies of the Cip/Kip family proteins, only p57-deficient mice showed developmental abnormalities (25Zhang P. Liegeois N.J. Wong C. Finegold M. Hou H. Thompson J.C. Silverman A. Harper J.W. DePinho R.A. Elledge S.J. Nature. 1997; 387: 151-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (657) Google Scholar, 26Yan Y. Frisen J. Lee M.H. Massague J. Barbacid M. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 973-983Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar). Abnormalities shown in these mice include short limbs, a defect attributable to abnormal endochondral ossification, which may be caused by delayed cell cycle exit during chondrocyte differentiation (25Zhang P. Liegeois N.J. Wong C. Finegold M. Hou H. Thompson J.C. Silverman A. Harper J.W. DePinho R.A. Elledge S.J. Nature. 1997; 387: 151-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (657) Google Scholar, 26Yan Y. Frisen J. Lee M.H. Massague J. Barbacid M. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 973-983Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar). Similar ossification defects have been observed in double-knockout mice of the retinoblastoma-related proteins, p107 and p130 (39Cobrinik D. Lee M.H. Hannon G. Mulligan G. Bronson R.T. Dyson N. Harlow E. Beach D. Weinberg R.A. Jacks T. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1633-1644Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar). Chondrocytes and osteoblasts are thought to be derived from stem cells of the same origin, and interestingly, primary osteoblastic cells used in this experiment express p107 and p130 but not retinoblastoma, and p107 became phosphorylated when the cells were stimulated by TGFβ1. 2T. Urano and H. Toyoshima, unpublished observations.Therefore, it is tempting to speculate that p57, together with p107, can be involved in the regulation of cell growth and differentiation of cells of certain lineage, including osteoblasts and chondrocytes. Our results also indicated that the expression level of p57 can be mainly regulated by the ubiquitin-proteasome protein degradation pathway, as is the case with its related CKI, p27. The increasing importance of ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis of the regulators of cell proliferation such as cyclin D, cyclin E, and p27 has been extensively examined in a number of recent studies (reviewed in Refs. 40Pagano M. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 1067-1075Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar, 41Elledge S.J. Harper J.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1377: M61-M70PubMed Google Scholar, 42Hershko A. Ciechanover A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 425-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (6955) Google Scholar), and our findings have added another CKI in this category. It will be important to study how signals from TGFβ1 can be delivered to the regulation of this machinery."
https://openalex.org/W2007090320,"The Ca2+-dependent mannuronan C-5-epimerase AlgE4 is a representative of a family of Azotobacter vinelandii enzymes catalyzing the polymer level epimerization of beta-D-mannuronic acid (M) to alpha-L-guluronic acid (G) in the commercially important polysaccharide alginate. The reaction product of recombinantly produced AlgE4 is predominantly characterized by an alternating sequence distribution of the M and G residues (MG blocks). AlgE4 was purified after intracellular overexpression in Escherichia coli, and the activity was shown to be optimal at pH values between 6.5 and 7.0, in the presence of 1-3 mM Ca2+, and at temperatures near 37 degrees C. Sr2+ was found to substitute reasonably well for Ca2+ in activation, whereas Zn2+ strongly inhibited the activity. During epimerization of alginate, the fraction of GMG blocks increased linearly as a function of the total fraction of G residues and comparably much faster than that of MMG blocks. These experimental data could not be accounted for by a random attack mechanism, suggesting that the enzyme either slides along the alginate chain during catalysis or recognizes a pre-existing G residue as a preferred substrate in its consecutive attacks."

In contrast, substitution of Arg115 in bovinefutb-encoded α1,3-fucosyltransferase (Fuc-Tb) by Trp generated a protein unable to transfer fucose either on H-type 1 or H-type 2 acceptors.

Since all fucosyltransferases utilize GDP-fucose as donor substrate, their specificity depends on the recognition of the acceptor substrate and the type of linkage formed. Although the primary sequences of six human α1,3-fucosyltransferases are known, the amino acids involved in the recognition of different acceptor substrates as type 1 (Galβ1,3GlcNAc) and type 2 (Galβ1,4GlcNAc) disaccharides or blood group H-type 1 (Fucα1,2Galβ1,3GlcNAc) and H-type 2 (Fucα1,2Galβ1, 4GlcNAc) trisaccharides are not yet known. These last trisaccharides are better acceptors than the disaccharides because they give higher values of fucose incorporation with a better K m and they are unambiguous in the sense that C-2 of Gal is already substituted by Fuc, and therefore, they can accept fucose only on C-3 or C-4 of GlcNAc. This is particularly relevant for Fuc-TIII 1The abbreviations used are: Fuc-TIII, FUT3-encoded Lewis α1,3/1,4-fucosyltransferase; Fuc-TIV, FUT4-encoded myeloid α1,3-fucosyltransferase; Fuc-TV, FUT5-encoded α1,3/1,4-fucosyltransferase; Fuc-TVI, FUT6-encoded plasma α1,3-fucosyltransferase; Fuc-TVII, FUT7-encoded leukocyte α1,3-fucosyltransferase; Fuc-TIX, FUT9-encoded brain α1,3-fucosyltransferase; Fuc-Tb, bovinefutb-encoded α1,3-fucosyltransferase; Fuc-Th, hamsterfuth-encoded α1,3-fucosyltransferase; Tricine, N-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine1The abbreviations used are: Fuc-TIII, FUT3-encoded Lewis α1,3/1,4-fucosyltransferase; Fuc-TIV, FUT4-encoded myeloid α1,3-fucosyltransferase; Fuc-TV, FUT5-encoded α1,3/1,4-fucosyltransferase; Fuc-TVI, FUT6-encoded plasma α1,3-fucosyltransferase; Fuc-TVII, FUT7-encoded leukocyte α1,3-fucosyltransferase; Fuc-TIX, FUT9-encoded brain α1,3-fucosyltransferase; Fuc-Tb, bovinefutb-encoded α1,3-fucosyltransferase; Fuc-Th, hamsterfuth-encoded α1,3-fucosyltransferase; Tricine, N-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycinesince up to 4% of α1,2-fucosyltransferase activity has been found with this enzyme (8Gallet P.F.

The Lewis or Fuc-TIII enzyme is ∼100 times more efficient on H-type 1 compared with H-type 2 acceptor substrates (10Costache M. Apoil P. Cailleau A. Elmgren A. Larson G. Henry S. Blancher A. Iordachescu D. Oriol R. Mollicone R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29721-29728Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). The Fuc-TV enzyme is more efficient on H-type 2 than on H-type 1 substrates, although the relative type 1/type 2 activities are of the same order of magnitude (10Costache M. Apoil P. Cailleau A.

Finally, the remaining four α1,3-fucosyltransferases (Fuc-TIV, Fuc-TVI, Fuc-TVII, and Fuc-TIX) are able to use only type 2 acceptor substrates and are consequently called α1,3-fucosyltransferases.The Fuc-TIII, Fuc-TV, and Fuc-TVI enzymes constituting the primate Lewis subfamily of fucosyltransferases have appeared by two successive duplications of an ancestral Lewis gene, which occurred rather late in evolution (Fig. 1), after the great mammalian radiation and before the separation of higher apes and man from their common evolutionary path (10Costache M. Apoil P. Cailleau A. Elmgren A. Larson G. Henry S. Blancher A. Iordachescu D. Oriol R. Mollicone R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29721-29728Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). These three enzymes share ∼85% sequence identity; the main differences among them are located in the stem amino-terminal region (hypervariable region), whereas their carboxyl-terminal regions are almost identical. Therefore, the differences in type 1/type 2 specificity among these three enzymes are expected to be determined by amino acid differences in their hypervariable regions. Two different strategies have been developed to define the amino acids involved in the relative differences of type 1/type 2 acceptor substrate specificity.Subdomain swapping of segment 62–110 of Fuc-TIII and the corresponding segment of Fuc-TV increased the type 1 enzyme activity of Fuc-TV (11Xu Z. Vo L. Macher B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8818-8823Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Eight amino acids were shown to be Fuc-TV-specific in this area. Site-directed mutagenesis of two of them (Asn86 and Thr87) by the corresponding His and Ile of Fuc-TIII also increased type 1 enzyme activity (12Nguyen A.T. Holmes E.H. Whitaker J.M. Ho S.

Kelly R.J. Natsuka Y. Lowe J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20987-20996Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) preferred to analyze the more clear-cut difference between Fuc-TIII and Fuc-TVI. They divided the hypervariable region into five subdomains and created enzyme chimeras by subdomain swapping. Functional analysis of the chimeras showed that the type 1/type 2 specificity of human Fuc-TIII and Fuc-TVI depends on amino acids in the segment corresponding to residues 103–153 of Fuc-TIII. Eleven amino acids in this area were specific to Fuc-TVI and were considered as candidates to determine whether or not this α1,3-fucosyltransferase can utilize, in addition, type 1 acceptor substrates (15Legault D.J. Kelly R.J. Natsuka Y. Lowe J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20987-20996Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). These 11 amino acids could be reduced to four following the cloning, expression, and peptide sequence analysis of chimpanzee Fuc-TIII, Fuc-TV, and Fuc-TVI (10Costache M. Apoil P. Cailleau A.

Mollicone and R. Oriol, unpublished results.3R. Mollicone and R. Oriol, unpublished results. This study was conducted to define, by site-directed mutagenesis, the contribution to H-type 1/H-type 2 acceptor substrate specificity of the two amino acids Arg115 and Glu116 of Fuc-Tb and the corresponding residues Trp111 and Asp112 of Fuc-TIII.DISCUSSIONFucosyltransferases have a common domain structure including a short NH2-terminal cytoplasmic tail, a signal anchor domain, a stem region, and a globular COOH-terminal catalytic domain. Truncation at the COOH terminus of one or more amino acids induces a dramatic loss of enzyme activity, whereas truncation at the NH2 terminus of as much as 61 amino acids for Fuc-TIII or 75 amino acids for Fuc-TV does not alter the enzyme activity (11Xu Z.

Glycobiology. 1998; 8: 87-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar) peptide conserved motifs were described in the COOH-terminal catalytic domain of all the α1,3-fucosyltransferases, and they are presumed to be involved in GDP-fucose binding (26Breton C.

Glycobiology. 1996; 6: R7-R12Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), whereas the acceptor substrate-binding domain has been tentatively ascribed to a portion of the hypervariable region comprised between either positions 62 and 110 (11Xu Z. Vo L. Macher B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8818-8823Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) or positions 103 and 153 (15Legault D.J. Kelly R.J. Natsuka Y. Lowe J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20987-20996Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) of Fuc-TIII.Based on our previous results (10Costache M. Apoil P. Cailleau A. Elmgren A. Larson G. Henry S. Blancher A. Iordachescu D. Oriol R. Mollicone R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29721-29728Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), a short peptide segment corresponding to the sequence Pro101–Leu121 of Fuc-TIII was used for peptide sequence alignment of all known vertebrate α1,3-fucosyltransferases. A single amino acid, Arg in α1,3-fucosyltransferases and Trp in α1,3/1,4-fucosyltransferases, was expected to contribute to the type 1/type 2 acceptor specificity. By site-directed mutagenesis, we have now demonstrated that the single substitution of Trp111 by Arg conferred to the recombinant Lewis enzyme the ability to use efficiently H-type 2 instead of H-type 1 acceptor substrate. This newly acquired activity increased when, in addition, Asp112 was replaced by Glu. The involvement of Arg in fucose transfer was confirmed by the loss of Fuc-Tb activity when Trp substituted for Arg115.Several invertebrate and bacterial α1,3-fucosyltransferases have been recently found (reviewed in Ref. 28Oriol R. Mollicone R. Cailleau A. Balanzino L. Breton C. Glycobiology. 1999; 9: 323-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Two Helicobacter pylori enzymes have been cloned and expressed, and they both use type 2 acceptors (24Ge Z. Chan N.W.C. Palcic M.M. Taylor D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21357-21363Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 25Martin S.L. Edbrooke M.R. Hodgman T.C. van den Eijnden D.H. Bird M.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21349-21356Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar) and have the similarly charged amino acid Lys instead of Arg in the candidate position. A Caenorhabditis elegans α1,3-fucosyltransferase has also been cloned and expressed (29DeBose-Boyd R.A. Nyame A.K. Cummings R.D. Glycobiology. 1998; 8: 905-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), and it has Gln in the candidate position, but it can transfer Fuc onto acceptors as GalNAcβ1,4GlcNAcβ1-R to generate GalNAcβ1,4(Fucα1,3)GlcNAcβ1-R. These nematode oligosaccharides are different from all known type 1 or type 2 oligosaccharides of the lacto or neolacto series. The remaining invertebrate and bacterial putative α1,3-fucosyltransferases have only been defined by sequence homology to vertebrate enzymes, and nothing is known about their enzyme activity or about the structure of the acceptor substrates used. Nevertheless, some of them did not have either Trp or Arg in the corresponding candidate position of the putative acceptor-binding domain, suggesting that as in the case ofC. elegans, other acceptors might be used by these enzymes. However, the overall structure of the acceptor substrate-binding domain is, in general, preserved with a conserved His residue before and a carboxylic group (Asp or Glu) after the candidate position.Previous work by Hindsgaul et al. (30Hindsgaul O. Kaur K.J. Srivastava G. Blasczcyk-Thurin G. Crawley S.C. Herzee L.D. Palcic M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 17858-17862Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) suggested that oligosaccharide-reactive acceptor hydroxyl groups are involved in a critical hydrogen bond donor interaction with the glycosyltransferases. The main key polar groups on the oligosaccharide acceptors have been identified as the reactive hydroxyls at C-3 or C-4 of GlcNAc and C-6 of Gal (31DeVries T. Palcic M.P. Schoenmakers P.S. Van den Eijnden D.H. Joziasse D.H. Glycobiology. 1997; 7: 921-927Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 32Du M. Hindsgaul O. Carbohydr. Res. 1996; 286: 87-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). On the enzyme side, different amino acids can be involved in this hydrogen bond, but typical hydrogen bond acceptors are His and carboxylates (26Breton C. Oriol R. Imberty A. Glycobiology. 1998; 8: 87-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), as those found in the conserved amino acid positions flanking the candidate Arg or Trp residue for the definition of the type 1/type 2 enzyme activity. Therefore, these His, Glu, and Asp residues can be considered as candidates for the formation of hydrogen bonds with the acceptor oligosaccharide. Based on recent studies, it seems reasonable to suggest that the active-site base in the protein may be a carboxylate anion (33Murray B.W. Wittmann V. Burkart M.D. Hung S.C. Wong C.H. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 823-831Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 34Murray B.W. Takayama S. Schultz J. Wong C.H. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 11183-11195Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). In another study, Britten and Bird (35Britten C.J. Bird M.I. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1334: 57-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) investigated the amino acids essential for the activity of Fuc-TVI through chemical modification, and they concluded that the substrate-binding site of the enzyme possesses His residue(s) that are essential for enzyme activity.It has been suggested, in the case of the oligosaccharyltransferase, that the divalent cation cofactor might be in close proximity to the acceptor oligosaccharide substrate (36Hendrickson T.L. Imperiali B. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 9444-9450Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). A similar mechanism could occur in fucosyltransferases, and it was recently suggested that Mn2+ could interact with a carboxylate anion (Glu or Asp) in the fucosyltransferase on one side and with the oligosaccharide acceptor substrate on the other side (37Smith S.L. Compston C.A. Palcic M.M. Bamford M.J. Britten C.J. Field R.A. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1997; 25: S630Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). The complete loss of enzyme activity by the substitution Asp112 → Asn in Fuc-TIII or Glu116 → Gln in Fuc-Tb suggests that this carboxylate group is necessary for enzyme activity, and therefore, it constitutes a possible candidate for the active-site carboxylate anion.The Arg115 → Trp substitution in Fuc-Tb was not sufficient to change the specificity of the enzyme toward type 1 acceptors even with the additional mutation Glu116 → Asp. Therefore, Trp seems to contribute to a type 1 activity, but it is not sufficient by itself; and even more than the two tested candidates, Trp and Asp, are probably necessary to change the Fuc-Tb specificity. This is in accordance with the fact that only a very small increase in the number of cells producing Lea and sialyl-Leaantigens was observed in cells transfected by a Fuc-TVI chimera containing Fuc-TIII subdomains 4 and 5 (positions 103–153) (15Legault D.J. Kelly R.J. Natsuka Y. Lowe J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20987-20996Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). In another work (12Nguyen A.T. Holmes E.H. Whitaker J.M. Ho S. Shetterly S. Macher B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25244-25249Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), it was shown that two other amino acid changes in Fuc-TV (Asn86 → His and Thr87 → Ile) increased the type 1 activity of the recombinant enzyme.The molecular phylogeny of fucosyltransferase genes suggested that the duplication events at the origin of the bovine futb (16Oulmouden A.

Chem. 1997; 272: 8764-8773Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) and primate FUT6 genes occurred before the duplication that produced the primate FUT3 and FUT5 genes (Fig.1). Hence, it seems that the common ancestor of FUT3 andFUT5 genes has acquired the capacity to use type 1 acceptors without loss of the ability to use type 2 acceptors. This would help to explain the change in enzyme specificity by a single amino acid substitution in Fuc-TIII, whereas more complex changes are expected in Fuc-Tb or Fuc-TVI to generate a strong type 1 acceptor activity because other independent mutations might have occurred in Fuc-TVI and/or Fuc-Tb since their earlier divergence from the common evolutionary path (Fig. 1). Fucosyltransferases are type II transmembrane proteins catalyzing fucose transfer from GDP-fucose to different oligosaccharide acceptors in α1,2-, α1,3-, α1,4-, and α1,6-linkages. The fucosylated glycoconjugates they produce are blood group and oncodevelopmental antigens (1Oriol R. Cartron J.P. Rouger P. Molecular Basis of Major Blood Group Antigens. 6.

Subdomain swapping of segment 62–110 of Fuc-TIII and the corresponding segment of Fuc-TV increased the type 1 enzyme activity of Fuc-TV (11Xu Z. Vo L. Macher B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8818-8823Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Eight amino acids were shown to be Fuc-TV-specific in this area. Site-directed mutagenesis of two of them (Asn86 and Thr87) by the corresponding His and Ile of Fuc-TIII also increased type 1 enzyme activity (12Nguyen A.T. Holmes E.H. Whitaker J.M. Ho S. Shetterly S. Macher B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25244-25249Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), whereas site-directed mutagenesis of other amino acids in the central area (13Sherwood A.L.

Chem. 1998; 273: 25250-25255Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) of Fuc-TIII and Fuc-TV did not modify the relative type 1/type 2 acceptor substrate specificity. Lowe and co-workers (15Legault D.J. Kelly R.J. Natsuka Y. Lowe J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20987-20996Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) preferred to analyze the more clear-cut difference between Fuc-TIII and Fuc-TVI. They divided the hypervariable region into five subdomains and created enzyme chimeras by subdomain swapping. Functional analysis of the chimeras showed that the type 1/type 2 specificity of human Fuc-TIII and Fuc-TVI depends on amino acids in the segment corresponding to residues 103–153 of Fuc-TIII. Eleven amino acids in this area were specific to Fuc-TVI and were considered as candidates to determine whether or not this α1,3-fucosyltransferase can utilize, in addition, type 1 acceptor substrates (15Legault D.J. Kelly R.J. Natsuka Y. Lowe J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20987-20996Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). These 11 amino acids could be reduced to four following the cloning, expression, and peptide sequence analysis of chimpanzee Fuc-TIII, Fuc-TV, and Fuc-TVI (10Costache M. Apoil P. Cailleau A.

Furthermore, this number could be further reduced to two amino acids specific to Fuc-TVI (Arg110 and Glu111) and Fuc-Tb (Arg115 and Glu116) by addition of the hamster Fuc-Th enzyme 2Both Fuc-Tb and Fuc-Th are orthologous homologous to the ancestor of the human Fuc-TIII, Fuc-TV, and Fuc-TVI enzymes.2Both Fuc-Tb and Fuc-Th are orthologous homologous to the ancestor of the human Fuc-TIII, Fuc-TV, and Fuc-TVI enzymes. to the previous analysis. 3R. Mollicone and R. Oriol, unpublished results.3R. Mollicone and R. Oriol, unpublished results. This study was conducted to define, by site-directed mutagenesis, the contribution to H-type 1/H-type 2 acceptor substrate specificity of the two amino acids Arg115 and Glu116 of Fuc-Tb and the corresponding residues Trp111 and Asp112 of Fuc-TIII. DISCUSSIONFucosyltransferases have a common domain structure including a short NH2-terminal cytoplasmic tail, a signal anchor domain, a stem region, and a globular COOH-terminal catalytic domain. Truncation at the COOH terminus of one or more amino acids induces a dramatic loss of enzyme activity, whereas truncation at the NH2 terminus of as much as 61 amino acids for Fuc-TIII or 75 amino acids for Fuc-TV does not alter the enzyme activity (11Xu Z.

Glycobiology. 1998; 8: 87-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar) peptide conserved motifs were described in the COOH-terminal catalytic domain of all the α1,3-fucosyltransferases, and they are presumed to be involved in GDP-fucose binding (26Breton C. Oriol R. Imberty A. Glycobiology. 1998; 8: 87-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 27Breton C. Oriol R. Imberty A. Glycobiology. 1996; 6: R7-R12Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), whereas the acceptor substrate-binding domain has been tentatively ascribed to a portion of the hypervariable region comprised between either positions 62 and 110 (11Xu Z. Vo L. Macher B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8818-8823Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) or positions 103 and 153 (15Legault D.J. Kelly R.J. Natsuka Y. Lowe J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20987-20996Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) of Fuc-TIII.Based on our previous results (10Costache M. Apoil P. Cailleau A. Elmgren A. Larson G. Henry S. Blancher A. Iordachescu D. Oriol R. Mollicone R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29721-29728Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), a short peptide segment corresponding to the sequence Pro101–Leu121 of Fuc-TIII was used for peptide sequence alignment of all known vertebrate α1,3-fucosyltransferases. A single amino acid, Arg in α1,3-fucosyltransferases and Trp in α1,3/1,4-fucosyltransferases, was expected to contribute to the type 1/type 2 acceptor specificity. By site-directed mutagenesis, we have now demonstrated that the single substitution of Trp111 by Arg conferred to the recombinant Lewis enzyme the ability to use efficiently H-type 2 instead of H-type 1 acceptor substrate. This newly acquired activity increased when, in addition, Asp112 was replaced by Glu. The involvement of Arg in fucose transfer was confirmed by the loss of Fuc-Tb activity when Trp substituted for Arg115.Several invertebrate and bacterial α1,3-fucosyltransferases have been recently found (reviewed in Ref. 28Oriol R. Mollicone R. Cailleau A. Balanzino L. Breton C. Glycobiology. 1999; 9: 323-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Two Helicobacter pylori enzymes have been cloned and expressed, and they both use type 2 acceptors (24Ge Z. Chan N.W.C. Palcic M.M. Taylor D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21357-21363Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 25Martin S.L. Edbrooke M.R. Hodgman T.C. van den Eijnden D.H. Bird M.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21349-21356Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar) and have the similarly charged amino acid Lys instead of Arg in the candidate position. A Caenorhabditis elegans α1,3-fucosyltransferase has also been cloned and expressed (29DeBose-Boyd R.A. Nyame A.K. Cummings R.D. Glycobiology. 1998; 8: 905-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), and it has Gln in the candidate position, but it can transfer Fuc onto acceptors as GalNAcβ1,4GlcNAcβ1-R to generate GalNAcβ1,4(Fucα1,3)GlcNAcβ1-R. These nematode oligosaccharides are different from all known type 1 or type 2 oligosaccharides of the lacto or neolacto series. The remaining invertebrate and bacterial putative α1,3-fucosyltransferases have only been defined by sequence homology to vertebrate enzymes, and nothing is known about their enzyme activity or about the structure of the acceptor substrates used. Nevertheless, some of them did not have either Trp or Arg in the corresponding candidate position of the putative acceptor-binding domain, suggesting that as in the case ofC. elegans, other acceptors might be used by these enzymes. However, the overall structure of the acceptor substrate-binding domain is, in general, preserved with a conserved His residue before and a carboxylic group (Asp or Glu) after the candidate position.Previous work by Hindsgaul et al. (30Hindsgaul O. Kaur K.J. Srivastava G. Blasczcyk-Thurin G. Crawley S.C. Herzee L.D. Palcic M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 17858-17862Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) suggested that oligosaccharide-reactive acceptor hydroxyl groups are involved in a critical hydrogen bond donor interaction with the glycosyltransferases. The main key polar groups on the oligosaccharide acceptors have been identified as the reactive hydroxyls at C-3 or C-4 of GlcNAc and C-6 of Gal (31DeVries T. Palcic M.P. Schoenmakers P.S. Van den Eijnden D.H. Joziasse D.H. Glycobiology. 1997; 7: 921-927Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 32Du M. Hindsgaul O. Carbohydr. Res. 1996; 286: 87-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). On the enzyme side, different amino acids can be involved in this hydrogen bond, but typical hydrogen bond acceptors are His and carboxylates (26Breton C. Oriol R. Imberty A. Glycobiology. 1998; 8: 87-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), as those found in the conserved amino acid positions flanking the candidate Arg or Trp residue for the definition of the type 1/type 2 enzyme activity. Therefore, these His, Glu, and Asp residues can be considered as candidates for the formation of hydrogen bonds with the acceptor oligosaccharide. Based on recent studies, it seems reasonable to suggest that the active-site base in the protein may be a carboxylate anion (33Murray B.W. Wittmann V. Burkart M.D. Hung S.C. Wong C.H. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 823-831Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 34Murray B.W. Takayama S. Schultz J. Wong C.H. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 11183-11195Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). In another study, Britten and Bird (35Britten C.J. Bird M.I. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1334: 57-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) investigated the amino acids essential for the activity of Fuc-TVI through chemical modification, and they concluded that the substrate-binding site of the enzyme possesses His residue(s) that are essential for enzyme activity.It has been suggested, in the case of the oligosaccharyltransferase, that the divalent cation cofactor might be in close proximity to the acceptor oligosaccharide substrate (36Hendrickson T.L. Imperiali B. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 9444-9450Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). A similar mechanism could occur in fucosyltransferases, and it was recently suggested that Mn2+ could interact with a carboxylate anion (Glu or Asp) in the fucosyltransferase on one side and with the oligosaccharide acceptor substrate on the other side (37Smith S.L. Compston C.A. Palcic M.M. Bamford M.J. Britten C.J. Field R.A. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1997; 25: S630Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). The complete loss of enzyme activity by the substitution Asp112 → Asn in Fuc-TIII or Glu116 → Gln in Fuc-Tb suggests that this carboxylate group is necessary for enzyme activity, and therefore, it constitutes a possible candidate for the active-site carboxylate anion.The Arg115 → Trp substitution in Fuc-Tb was not sufficient to change the specificity of the enzyme toward type 1 acceptors even with the additional mutation Glu116 → Asp. Therefore, Trp seems to contribute to a type 1 activity, but it is not sufficient by itself; and even more than the two tested candidates, Trp and Asp, are probably necessary to change the Fuc-Tb specificity. This is in accordance with the fact that only a very small increase in the number of cells producing Lea and sialyl-Leaantigens was observed in cells transfected by a Fuc-TVI chimera containing Fuc-TIII subdomains 4 and 5 (positions 103–153) (15Legault D.J.

Macher B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25244-25249Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), it was shown that two other amino acid changes in Fuc-TV (Asn86 → His and Thr87 → Ile) increased the type 1 activity of the recombinant enzyme.The molecular phylogeny of fucosyltransferase genes suggested that the duplication events at the origin of the bovine futb (16Oulmouden A.

Chem. 1997; 272: 8764-8773Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) and primate FUT6 genes occurred before the duplication that produced the primate FUT3 and FUT5 genes (Fig.1). Hence, it seems that the common ancestor of FUT3 andFUT5 genes has acquired the capacity to use type 1 acceptors without loss of the ability to use type 2 acceptors. This would help to explain the change in enzyme specificity by a single amino acid substitution in Fuc-TIII, whereas more complex changes are expected in Fuc-Tb or Fuc-TVI to generate a strong type 1 acceptor activity because other independent mutations might have occurred in Fuc-TVI and/or Fuc-Tb since their earlier divergence from the common evolutionary path (Fig. 1).

https://openalex.org/W2077335984,"Arylsulfatase A belongs to the sulfatase family whose members carry a Cα-formylglycine that is post-translationally generated by oxidation of a conserved cysteine or serine residue. The formylglycine acts as an aldehyde hydrate with two geminal hydroxyls being involved in catalysis of sulfate ester cleavage. In arylsulfatase A and N-acetylgalactosamine 4-sulfatase this formylglycine was found to form the active site together with a divalent cation and a number of polar residues, tightly interconnected by a net of hydrogen bonds. Most of these putative active site residues are highly conserved among the eukaryotic and prokaryotic members of the sulfatase family. To analyze their function in binding and cleaving sulfate esters, we substituted a total of nine putative active site residues of human ASA by alanine (Asp29, Asp30, Asp281, Asn282, His125, His229, Lys123, Lys302, and Ser150). In addition the Mg2+-complexing residues (Asp29, Asp30, Asp281, and Asn282) were substituted conservatively by either asparagine or aspartate. In all mutants V max was decreased to 1–26% of wild type activity. The K m was more than 10-fold increased in K123A and K302A and up to 5-fold in the other mutants. In all mutants the pH optimum was increased from 4.5 by 0.2–0.8 units. These results indicate that each of the nine residues examined is critical for catalytic activity, Lys123 and Lys302 by binding the substrate and the others by direct (His125 and Asp281) or indirect participation in catalysis. The shift in the pH optimum is explained by two deprotonation steps that have been proposed for sulfate ester cleavage.

To analyze their function in binding and cleaving sulfate esters, we substituted a total of nine putative active site residues of human ASA by alanine (Asp29, Asp30, Asp281, Asn282, His125, His229, Lys123, Lys302, and Ser150). In addition the Mg2+-complexing residues (Asp29, Asp30, Asp281, and Asn282) were substituted conservatively by either asparagine or aspartate. In all mutants V max was decreased to 1–26% of wild type activity. The K m was more than 10-fold increased in K123A and K302A and up to 5-fold in the other mutants. In all mutants the pH optimum was increased from 4.5 by 0.2–0.8 units. These results indicate that each of the nine residues examined is critical for catalytic activity, Lys123 and Lys302 by binding the substrate and the others by direct (His125 and Asp281) or indirect participation in catalysis. The shift in the pH optimum is explained by two deprotonation steps that have been proposed for sulfate ester cleavage. Mammalian sulfatases are involved in the degradation of sulfated substrates like mucopolysaccharides, cerebroside sulfates, and sulfated steroids. The key residue for catalytic activity in sulfate ester cleavage has recently been shown to be a Cα-formylglycine (FGly; Refs. 1Schmidt B. Selmer T. Ingendoh A. von Figura K.

In the first half-cycle, one of the two geminal oxygens of the aldehyde hydrate attacks the sulfur of the sulfate ester leading to a transesterification of the sulfate group onto the aldehyde hydrate.

By this “intramolecular hydrolysis” the aldehyde group is regenerated. The essential role of FGly in forming the transient enzyme-sulfate ester has been shown indirectly (8Recksiek M. Selmer T.

Mutants of ASA and ASB were expressed in which the FGly had been replaced by a serine. These mutants were able to cleave sulfate ester and to generate a sulfated enzyme intermediate with a serine sulfate ester in position 69 (ASA) or 91 (ASB). However, due to the lack of a second hydroxyl group, the release of the sulfate group regenerating the aldehyde did not occur.The function of the other residues forming the active site remained speculative. In ASA one oxygen of the aldehyde hydrate is in close vicinity to the Mg2+ ion, which is complexed by residues Asp29, Asp30, Asp281, and Asn282, and the other oxygen is close to the imidazole ring of His125. Whereas Mg2+ is thought to coordinate the oxygen that attacks the sulfur in the first step of sulfate cleavage, His125 is a candidate to deprotonate the second hydroxyl of the aldehyde hydrate, which is involved in the release of the sulfate and the regeneration of the aldehyde. By modeling a sulfate anion into the active site, the positively charged residues Lys123, Lys302, His229, and residue Ser150 were proposed to fix the sulfate group (6Lukatela G. Krauss N. Theis K.

https://openalex.org/W2052063298,"Previously, we demonstrated that the Src tyrosine kinase interacts with the Shp-2 tyrosine phosphatase. To determine whether Shp-2 regulates Src kinase activity, we measured Src activity in cells overexpressing wild-type or catalytically-inactive C463S Shp-2. We observed a 2-3-fold increase in the specific activity of Src in both cell types and the increase did not appear to be due to dephosphorylation of Tyr 527 or phosphorylation of Tyr 416 on Src. Conversely, we observed a 2-3-fold decrease in the specific activity of Src when Shp-2 expression was inhibited. Using glutathione S-transferase-fusion proteins, we demonstrated that Shp-2 binds to the SH3 domain of Src. Our findings reveal that the Shp-2 tyrosine phosphatase can regulate the Src tyrosine kinase by a non-enzymatic mechanism. We also found that the phosphatase activity of Shp-2 immunoprecipitates is downregulated in cells transformed by Src or other proteins, and that Shp-2 preferentially associates with the membrane fraction of transformed cells. We suggest that membrane-association of Shp-2 is important for regulating Shp-2 activity."

We show that immunoprecipitation of solubilized sarcoplasmic reticulum membrane with antibodies directed against triadin or ryanodine receptor, leads to the co-immunoprecipitation of ryanodine receptor and triadin. We then investigated the functional importance of the cytoplasmic domain of triadin (residues 1–47) in the control of Ca2+release from sarcoplasmic reticulum. We show that antibodies directed against a synthetic peptide encompassing residues 2–17, induce a decrease in the rate of Ca2+ release from sarcoplasmic reticulum vesicles as well as a decrease in the open probability of the ryanodine receptor Ca2+ channel incorporated in lipid bilayers. Using surface plasmon resonance spectroscopy, we defined a discrete domain (residues 18–46) of the cytoplasmic part of triadin interacting with the purified ryanodine receptor. This interaction is optimal at low Ca2+ concentration (up to pCa 5) and inhibited by increasing calcium concentration (IC50 of 300 μm). The direct molecular interaction of this triadin domain with the ryanodine receptor was confirmed by overlay assay and shown to induce the inhibition of the Ca2+ channel activity of purified RyR in bilayer. We propose that this interaction plays a critical role in the control, by triadin, of the Ca2+channel behavior of the ryanodine receptor and therefore may represent an important step in the regulation process of excitation-contraction coupling in skeletal muscle.

Moreover, during recent years an increasing number of proteins located in the triad have been shown to be able to regulate Ca2+release from SR. Some of these proteins, such as the FK506-binding protein (FKBP12) and the cytoplasmic Ca2+-binding proteins calmodulin and S100A1, interact directly with the RyR and modulate its Ca2+ channel behavior (18Brillantes A.B.

A different set of results indicates that Ca2+ efflux through the RyR Ca2+channel is also controlled by luminal Ca2+ concentration presumably via a functional interaction between RyR and calsequestrin, the major Ca2+-binding protein of the SR lumen (23Ikemoto M.

Triadin is of particular interest because it is one of the SR membrane proteins that co-localize with RyR (26Caswell A.H. Brandt N.R. Brunschwig J.P. Purkerson S.

Based on its primary sequence analysis and accessibility to specific antibodies and protease, a model has been proposed for the membrane topography of skeletal triadin in the SR membrane (28Knudson C.M.

Although different results have suggested an interaction of triadin with either RyR, DHPR , or calsequestrin (30Kim K.C. Caswell A.H. Talvenheimo J.A. Brandt N.R.

In this study, we investigated the functional interaction between the cytoplasmic domain of triadin and the RyR. We show that antibodies specifically directed against the N-terminal cytoplasmic extremity of triadin inhibit caffeine-induced Ca2+ release from SR vesicles by reducing the open probability of the RyR Ca2+channel. Surface plasmon resonance measurements revealed a specific interaction of the cytoplasmic portion of triadin with purified RyR. This was confirmed by overlay assays, which showed this interaction to be direct. This interaction is dependent on the free Ca2+concentration and is completely inhibited in the presence of several millimolar of CaCl2. These results represent the first identification of a discrete domain of triadin directly involved in a functional interaction with RyR. This interaction would allow a direct control of RyR Ca2+ channel behavior by triadin from the cytosolic side and therefore strongly suggests that triadin is a major actor of excitation-contraction coupling in vivo. Heavy sarcoplasmic reticulum (HSR) vesicles were prepared from rabbit skeletal muscle as described previously (14Marty I. Robert M. Villaz M. De Jongh K.S. Lai Y. Catterall W.A. Ronjat M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 2270-2274Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Ryanodine receptor was purified on sucrose gradient after solubilization of HSR membrane with CHAPS as described by Lai et al. (8Lai F.A. Erickson H. Rousseau E. Liu Q.Y. Meissner G. Nature. 1988; 331: 315-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The fractions corresponding to the peak of bound [3H]ryanodine were pooled and concentrated by filtration on a YM30 membrane (Amicon Corp). Two peptides corresponding to residues 2–17 (peptide 1) and 18–46 (peptide 2) of the skeletal triadin (28Knudson C.M. Stang K.K. Moomaw C.R. Slaughter C.A. Campbell K.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12646-12654Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) were synthesized with an exogenous C-terminal Tyr and Cys, respectively. A third peptide (peptide 3), not related to triadin, was used for the surface plasmon resonance control experiments of RyR-peptide 2 interaction. This peptide was chosen because of its isoelectric point (pI 9.13) and molecular mass (2035 Da), which were similar to those of peptide 2 (pI 8.98, molecular mass 3180,9 Da). For overlay assays, peptide 2 was synthesized with an exogenous C-terminal biotinylated Lys. Antibodies directed against synthetic peptides corresponding to amino acids 2–17 (A-Nter) or 691–706 (A-Cter) extremity of triadin were obtained and characterized as described previously (29Marty I. Robert M. Ronjat M. Bally I. Arlaud G. Villaz M. Biochem. J. 1995; 307: 769-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). These antibodies were affinity purified against the corresponding peptide. Fab fragments of affinity purified A-Nter antibodies were prepared using a Fab preparation kit (Pierce). Heavy SR vesicles were solubilized in the presence of CHAPS as described in Ref. 14Marty I. Robert M. Villaz M. De Jongh K.S. Lai Y. Catterall W.A. Ronjat M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 2270-2274Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar. Solubilized proteins were then incubated with antibodies specifically directed against ryanodine receptor (anti-RyR) or either N-terminal (A-Nter) or C-terminal (A-Cter) extremity of triadin. The immune complex was then precipitated with protein A-Sepharose, and the immunoprecipitated proteins identified by Western blot analysis using a chemiluminescent technique after electrophoretic separation and transferred to an Immobilon sheet. A-Nter and A-Cter antibodies as well as anti-RyR antibodies used in these experiments were previously described by Martyet al. (29Marty I. Robert M. Ronjat M. Bally I. Arlaud G. Villaz M. Biochem. J. 1995; 307: 769-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). HSR vesicles (10 mg/ml) were incubated for 14 h in ice in the presence or in the absence of A-Nter antibodies (HSR protein/Ab ratio of 10 or 20). For control experiments, A-Nter antibodies were preincubated with an excess of corresponding peptide before their incubation with HSR vesicles. Ca2+ uptake and Ca2+ release were then monitored using arsenazo III as a Ca2+ indicator as described previously (16Ikemoto N. Antoniu B. Kim D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 13151-13158Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The arsenazo III signal was converted to nanomoles of Ca2+ by determining the Δ arsenazo III signal/Δ [Ca2+] coefficient from a calibration curve. The concentration of the contaminant Ca2+ brought by HSR vesicles and buffer was calculated to be 20 μm. For active Ca2+ loading of HSR vesicles, the vesicles (0.25 mg/ml) were incubated in a solution containing, 0.15 m KCl, 5.0 mm phosphoenolpyruvate, 10 units/ml pyruvate kinase, 2 mm MgCl2, 12.5 μmCaCl2, 34 μm arsenazo III and 20 mm MES, pH 6.8 (solution A). After incubation for 15 min at room temperature, Ca2+ uptake was induced by addition of 1 mm ATP. For Ca2+ release experiments, HSR vesicles were actively loaded as described above, and then mixed with 1 volume of solution B containing 0.15 m KCl, 34 μm arsenazo III, 10 mm caffeine, and 20 mm MES, pH 6.8. The time course of HSR Ca2+-release was monitored using a stopped flow apparatus (Bio-Logic SFM-3). Ten to fifteen traces, each representing 4,000 data points of the arsenazo III signal, were averaged for each experiment. Lipids bilayers were cast from a phospholipid solution in n-decane containing a 5:2:3 mixture of phosphatidylethanolamine/phosphatidylserine/phosphatidylcholine (30 mg/ml). The voltage control side was the cis chamber, and the trans chamber was referred to as ground. HSR membrane vesicles or purified RyR were applied on top of the preformed bilayer from the cis side. The experimental solutions were as follows: for the cis chamber, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.0, 250 mm NaCl, 1 mm ATP, 0.1 mmCaCl2, 0.1 mm EGTA (pCa 5.5); and for the trans chamber, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.0, 50 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm CaCl2, 0.1 mm EGTA (pCa 5.5). Traces were recorded at 0 mV. Single channel recording and analysis were performed as described previously (21Treves S. Scutari E. Robert M. Groh S. Ottolia M. Prestipino G. Ronjat M. Zorzato F. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 11496-11503Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Real time surface plasmon resonance experiments were performed on a BIAcore biosensor system (Pharmacia Biosensor AB, Uppsala, Sweden). All experiments were performed at 25 °C with a constant flow rate of 10 μl/min. Synthetic peptides were directly coupled to a carboxymethylated dextran matrix (CM5 sensor chip, Pharmacia Biosensor). Peptide 1 was coupled through its amino groups according to the protocol provided by Pharmacia Biosensor. Peptides 2 and 3 were immobilized through their unique C-terminal thiol group according to the protocols provided by Pharmacia Biosensor and modified as follows. Before peptide injection, excess of reactive carboxyl groups was inactivated with 35 μl of 1 mm ethanolamine hydrochloride, pH 8.5. After peptide immobilization, excess of reactive disulfide groups were neutralized with 25 μl of 1 m NaCl, 50 mm cysteine in 0.1 m formate, pH 4.3, and noncovalently bound peptides removed by a wash with 20 μl of 50 mm HCl. The concentration of peptide used was adjusted to obtain an equivalent level of immobilization (expressed in fmol/mm2) calculated according to the ratio of 1,000 units/ng of peptide immobilized/mm2 given by Pharmacia Biosensor. Purified RyR, previously dialyzed overnight at 4 °C against a buffer containing 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, and 150 mm NaCl was injected in the same buffer containing different concentrations of EGTA and CaCl2 to obtain the wanted values ofpCa. 2 μg of purified skeletal RyR were separated on 5–15% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred on an Immobilon sheet. The Immobilon sheet was then blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin for 30 min at room temperature in buffer A (150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EGTA, 0.1% T20, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4). Overlay was carried out with 50 nm of biotinylated peptide 2 for 2 h at room temperature in presence of 1% bovine serum albumin in buffer A. At the end of the incubation, the blot was washed 3 times for 5 min in buffer A. Peptide 2 binding proteins were revealed by chemiluminescent technique using peroxidase-conjugated anti-biotin monoclonal antibodies (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc.). The interaction between ryanodine receptor and triadin was first tested by co-immunoprecipitation experiments with specific antibodies. Solubilized HSR proteins were immunoprecipitated with antibodies directed against N-terminal (A-Nter) or C-terminal (A-Cter) domain of triadin or with antibodies directed against RyR, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Immunoprecipitated proteins were then analyzed by Western blot (Fig.1) with antibodies directed against either RyR or triadin. Fig. 1 shows that immunoprecipitation by A-Nter or A-Cter leads to the co-precipitation of RyR and triadin, as indicated by the labeling of the immune complex by both anti-RyR and A-Cter antibodies, whereas preimmune serum is unable to precipitate either of this two proteins. Conversely, immunoprecipitation with antibodies directed against RyR leads to the co-precipitation of RyR and triadin as indicated by immunobloting of the precipitated proteins with A-Cter and anti-RyR antibodies. These results confirm the existence of a complex containing both RyR and triadin (30Kim K.C. Caswell A.H. Talvenheimo J.A. Brandt N.R. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 9281-9289Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 31Guo W. Campbell K.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9027-9030Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar, 39). To investigate the functional role of the RyR-triadin interaction, we tested the effect of anti-triadin antibodies on Ca2+ uptake and Ca2+release from SR vesicles as well as on the RyR Ca2+ channel behavior. Using proteolytic degradation techniques, we have previously shown that the first 47 amino acids of triadin are protruding into the cytoplasm, whereas the rest of the protein is localized within the SR lumen (29Marty I. Robert M. Ronjat M. Bally I. Arlaud G. Villaz M. Biochem. J. 1995; 307: 769-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). We therefore focused our study on the role of the cytoplasmic domain of triadin in the regulation of Ca2+release from SR and tested the effect of the A-Nter antibodies, directed against residues 2–17 of triadin, on Ca2+ release from SR vesicles. SR vesicles, incubated in the presence or absence of A-Nter antibodies, were actively loaded with Ca2+ and then tested for Ca2+ release, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” As shown in Fig.2 A, representing the time course of Ca2+ uptake by SR vesicles preincubated in the absence (trace A) or presence (trace B) of A-Nter antibodies, these antibodies produce no significant effect on the active Ca2+ loading of the SR vesicles. Under the conditions used, the loading level was 103.4 ± 14.0 (n = 6) and 97.3 ± 5.8 (n = 8) nmol/mg for SR vesicles incubated in the absence or presence of A-Nter, respectively. In contrast, under the same conditions, incubation of the SR vesicles with A-Nter antibodies induces a clear inhibition of the Ca2+ release measured in the presence of caffeine (Fig.2 B, curves B and C compared withcurve A). The initial rate of Ca2+ release, calculated from the slope of Ca2+ release curve at time 0, decreased from 288 nmol of Ca2+ mg−1s−1 protein, trace A (no antibodies), to 96 and 37 nmol of Ca2+ mg−1 s−1 protein,trace B (proteins/A-Nter = 20) and trace C(proteins/A-Nter = 10). No significant change of Ca2+release rate was observed when SR vesicles were incubated with the peptide alone (data not shown) or with A-Nter antibodies pre-incubated with the corresponding peptide (curve D). These results clearly demonstrate that antibodies directed against the cytoplasmic domain of triadin inhibit Ca2+ release from SR vesicles. Therefore, modifying triadin can induce a modification of RyR function. However this effect of A-Nter antibodies could result from modification by the antibodies of either the RyR Ca2+ channel properties, or any other step of the Ca2+ release process. We then studied the effect of A-Nter antibodies on the intrinsic properties of the RyR Ca2+ channel after incorporation of HSR vesicles in planar lipid bilayer. Fig.3 shows the single channel recording and current integral obtained using Na+ as the current carrier. In control conditions (pCa 5.5 and 1 mm ATP), we observed a high conductance channel (490 pS) (Fig. 3, left trace). In the cis chamber, the addition of Fab fragment of the A-Nter induces a decrease of the normalized open probability of the channel from 0.25 (control conditions) to 0.03 (right trace), corresponding to an inhibition of 73 ± 8% (n = 4) of the RyR current. Neither addition of antigenic peptide alone nor that of A-Nter antibodies preincubated with the peptide induces a change of Ca2+ channel activity (data not shown). This channel was previously identified as the RyR Ca2+ channel based on its sensitivity to Ca2+, ryanodine, and ruthenium red (21Treves S. Scutari E. Robert M. Groh S. Ottolia M. Prestipino G. Ronjat M. Zorzato F. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 11496-11503Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). When purified RyR was incorporated into lipid bilayers, no effect of the A-Nter triadin antibodies on RyR Ca2+ channel activity was observed (data not shown), confirming the fact that the effect of A-Nter antibodies on RyR must occur via triadin. These data strongly suggest that the inhibition of the Ca2+ release from SR by A-Nter antibodies results from the reduction of the RyR Ca2+ channel open probability by these antibodies. The effect of A-Nter antibodies on the RyR Ca2+ channel properties described above could be due to the modification of a direct interaction between RyR and the cytoplasmic N-terminal region of triadin or an at-distance modification of the interaction between another region of triadin and RyR. The existence of a direct molecular interaction between RyR and the N-terminal region of triadin was then addressed using surface plasmon resonance technique. For these experiments, two peptides corresponding to residues 2–17 (peptide 1) and 18–46 (peptide 2) of triadin, respectively, were synthesized and immobilized to the dextran matrix coating the sensor chip. The interaction of each peptide with purified RyR was then monitored using the optical biosensor BIAcore. Fig.4 depicts the amplitude of the binding signal corresponding to the interaction of purified RyR with peptides 1 and 2 in the presence of 1 mm EGTA or 2 mmCa2+. Of these two peptides, only peptide 2 interacts with purified RyR in the presence of EGTA but not in the presence of 2 mm Ca2+. No interaction of purified RyR with peptide 1 was observed in the presence of EGTA or Ca2+. Accessibility of immobilized peptide 1 was ensured by its reactivity with A-Nter antibodies (data not shown). In the next set of experiments, we analyzed in more detail the interaction of purified RyR with peptide 2 in the presence of 1 mm EGTA. Fig. 5, upper trace, shows the sensorgrams representing the real time interaction of peptide 2 with increasing concentrations of purified RyR. Fig. 5, lower trace shows that the resonance unit response corresponding to the binding of purified RyR on peptide 2 is dose-dependent and approaches the saturation for concentrations of purified RyR close to 200 nm with an apparent affinity of 27 ± 5 nm (n = 4). The interaction between the purified RyR and the immobilized peptide 2 could be inhibited by preincubation of RyR with peptide 2 (data not shown). Nonspecific interaction between purified RyR and the activated surface sensor was measured on either a surface coated with peptide 3, unrelated to triadin (Fig. 5, curve E), or a surface sensor without immobilized peptide. In both cases, the nonspecific interaction was consistently found to represent less than 10% of the total binding signal. However the surface plasmon resonance interaction signal described above could reflect the interaction of triadin with RyR via another protein present in the purified RyR preparation. To test this hypothesis we performed overlay of biotinylated peptide 2 on purified RyR. Fig. 6, lane 1, shows that immunolabeling by anti-biotin antibodies of purified RyR preparation overlaid with biotinylated peptide 2 leads to the labeling of two bands corresponding to the high molecular weight protein RyR and to a lower molecular mass peptide (approximately 58 kDa), respectively. However labeling of the 58-kDa peptide was also observed when overlay was performed in the absence of peptide 2 (Fig. 6, lane 2) and is therefore likely due to a nonspecific labeling by the anti-biotin antibodies themselves. These results clearly demonstrate the direct molecular interaction between RyR and peptide 2 in presence of 1 mm EGTA. Therefore we investigated the effect of the free Ca2+concentration on the interaction of RyR with peptide 2. Purified RyR, at a fixed concentration, was injected on the peptide-coated sensor surface in a buffer containing different free Ca2+concentrations. Fig. 7 represents the variation of the specific binding signal amplitude as a function of [Ca2+] and shows that RyR-peptide 2 interaction is optimal at low Ca2+ concentrations (below micromolar) and is inhibited by increasing [Ca2+] with IC50for Ca2+ in the range of 300 μm. These results clearly indicate that purified RyR interacts directly with the peptide corresponding to residues 18–46 of triadin, this interaction being regulated by Ca2+. Fig. 8shows the recording of channel activity of purified RyR incorporated into lipid bilayers. As mentioned above, addition of A-Nter triadin antibodies to purified RyR incorporated to lipid bilayer did not induce any change in the RyR activity, indicating that the effect of these antibodies on RyR occur via triadin. Therefore we tested the effect of peptide 2 on the activity of the purified RyR incorporated into lipid bilayer. In the presence of 1 mm ATP and 3 μmfree Ca2+ in the cis chamber, RyR was consistently open as shown on Fig. 8 (control). The addition of peptide 2 (100 nm final concentration) in the cis chamber induces a decrease of the normalized open probability of the channel from 0.19 to 0.04 corresponding to a 79% inhibition of the current. These results demonstrate that the molecular interaction of peptide 2 with purified RyR induces the inhibition of the RyR channel activity. In conclusion, several new aspects of the interaction of triadin and RyR are described here. Our results represent the first evidence of a direct interaction of the cytoplasmic domain of triadin with RyR. Moreover, these results allow us to define a discrete domain restricted to the residues 18–46 of this cytoplasmic portion of triadin as responsible for the interaction with RyR. The interaction of the cytoplasmic domain of triadin with RyR is inhibited at millimolar [Ca2+]. We show that the cytoplasmic domain of triadin plays a functional role in the regulation of the Ca2+release from SR via the control of the RyR Ca2+ channel behavior. Indeed, antibodies directed against the cytoplasmic region of triadin induce both an inhibition of Ca2+ release from SR and a decrease of the open probability of RyR Ca2+ channel. Moreover, peptide 2 representing the domain of triadin directly involved in the interaction with the RyR can induce in vitrothe inhibition of the RyR channel activity. These results clearly demonstrate that triadin-RyR interaction directly modulates the intrinsic RyR Ca2+ channel properties and are in agreement with previous works (32Brandt N.R. Caswell A.H. Brunschwig J.P. Kang J.J. Antoniu B. Ikemoto N. FEBS Lett. 1992; 299: 57-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 33Liu G. Pessah I.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 33028-33034Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) suggesting that triadin is involved in the control of Ca2+ flux from SR. Recently, Ohkura et al. (36Ohkura M. Furukawa K.I. Fujimori H. Kuruma A. Kawano S. Hiraoka M. Kuniyasu A. Nakayama H. Ohizumi Y. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 12987-12993Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) have shown that addition of purified skeletal triadin to the cytoplasmic side of purified RyR incorporated in lipid bilayer induces a complete inhibition of RyR channel activity, whereas addition of triadin to the luminal side does not produce any change in the RyR activity. These authors propose that this regulation of RyR by triadin involves a cytoplasmic domain of triadin. According to our results, the cytoplasmic domain of triadin encompassing residues 18–46 could be a good candidate to mediate this interaction. Therefore we propose that the binding of the A-Nter to its epitope, which is located within the first 17 residues of triadin, stabilizes the interaction of a specific site, located between residues 18 and 46 of triadin, with RyR, leading to the stabilization of the closed state of the RyR Ca2+ channel. The involvement of triadin in the control of RyR via the cytoplasmic side also agrees with the results obtained by Liu and Pessah (33Liu G. Pessah I.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 33028-33034Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) showing the effect of cytoplasmic modulators on both triadin and RyR. However, this interaction of triadin with the RyR has to be strictly regulated. Interestingly, Guo and Campbell (31Guo W. Campbell K.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9027-9030Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar) have shown that the luminal domain of triadin is able to interact with both RyR and calsequestrin and have proposed that triadin could be the link between these two proteins. Therefore, according to the results presented here, it appears that triadin not only could mediate the control of the RyR Ca2+channel activity by luminal Ca2+ but also participate in the regulation of the RyR channel activity by cytoplasmic factors. Moreover, the luminal part of triadin could play a role in the regulation of the inhibitory effect of the cytoplasmic domain, providing a direct link between the luminal Ca2+concentration and the RyR activity. The strict dependence on free cytoplasmic Ca2+ concentration of the interaction of the cytoplasmic domain of triadin with RyR, described above, likely explains why Guo and Campbell (31Guo W. Campbell K.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9027-9030Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar) did not see any interaction of RyR with the fusion protein corresponding to the cytoplasmic domain of triadin, because their experiments were performed in the presence of mm Ca2+. Interestingly the RyR-triadin interaction highlighted in the present work is shown to be inhibited by Ca2+ in a range of concentrations in which Ca2+has previously been shown to control Ca2+ release from SR as well as ryanodine binding on RyR and therefore the functional state of RyR (7Imagawa T. Smith J.S. Coronado R. Campbell K.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 16636-16643Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 35Moutin M.J. Dupont Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 4228-4237Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This effect of Ca2+ on the RyR-triadin interaction suggests that the interaction of the cytoplasmic domain of triadin with RyR depends on the RyR conformational state and vice versa. Moreover, RyR·triadin complex is stabilized in the presence of Ca2+ concentrations corresponding to the cytoplasmic Ca2+ level of the resting cell, and strongly disfavored in the presence of Ca2+ concentrations corresponding to the [Ca2+] locally reached when RyR Ca2+ channels open. Therefore, RyR-triadin interaction, by sensing the [Ca2+] at the RyR channel mouth, could represent in vivo an important step of control of the RyR Ca2+ channel opening and closing by cytoplasmic Ca2+ level. The identification of the region of the ryanodine receptor involved in the interaction with the cytoplasmic domain of triadin will help to understand the process of cross-talk between triadin and RyR. In cardiac SR, the ryanodine receptor has been shown to also interact with an other integral membrane protein called junctin also present in skeletal muscle SR (25Jones L.R. Zhang L. Samborn K. Jorgensen A.O. Kelley J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30787-30796Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar, 34Zhang L. Kelley J. Schmeisser G. Kobayashi Y.M. Jones L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23389-23397Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar). Although junctin and triadin show some similarities (25Jones L.R. Zhang L. Samborn K. Jorgensen A.O. Kelley J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30787-30796Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar), the primary sequence of their cytoplasmic domain strongly differs, suggesting that they may have a different function, whereas their luminal domain sharing some association motifs is involved in the interaction with RyR and calsequestrin. Comparison of the effect of cytoplasmic domain of triadin and junctin could help to understand the respective role of these proteins."

In the present study, we have identified several proteins in neuroblastoma cells that are phosphorylated on tyrosine in response to GDNF. The phosphorylated proteins include focal adhesion kinase (FAK), paxillin and Crk-associated substrate, p130Cas, all of which are known to be associated with focal adhesions. Of these, paxillin and p130Cas interacted with Crk proteins in GDNF-treated neuroblastoma cells. GDNF also induced reorganization of the actin cytoskelton. Tyrosine phosphorylation of FAK, paxillin and p130Cas was inhibited by cytochalasin D or two specific inhibitors of phosphatidylinositol-3′ kinase (PI-3′ kinase), wortmannin and LY294002, indicating that their tyrosine phosphorylation depends on the formation of actin stress fiber and activation of PI-3′ kinase. In addition, phosphorylation of FAK but not of paxillin and p130Cas was markedly impaired by the Clostridium botulinum C3 exoenzyme that specifically ADP-ribosylates and inactivates Rho. These results suggested the presence of Rho-dependent and -independent signaling pathways downstream of PI-3′ kinase that mediate tyrosine phosphorylation of FAK, paxillin and p130Cas through Ret kinase."

The ability to distort DNA structure cannot fully explain the anticancer activity because the geometric isomer of cisplatin, trans-diamminedichloroplatinum(II), which also forms DNA adducts that modify the structure and block transcription and replication, is clinically ineffective. Efforts have therefore focused on identifying other cellular constituents that might interact specifically with cisplatin-DNA adducts to effect the antineoplastic response. By screening human and yeast cDNA expression libraries, genes were discovered for proteins that bind specifically to cisplatin-modified DNA (8Toney J.H. Donahue B.A. Kellett P.J. Bruhn S.L.

These proteins, human structure-specific recognition protein (hSSRP1) and intrastrand cross-link recognition protein (Ixr), both contain 80-amino acid peptides homologous to the DNA-binding domains of the chromosomal protein HMG1. HMG1 is the prototypical member of a family of proteins that contain such DNA-binding motifs. Most HMG-domain proteins bind specifically to the major cisplatin-DNA adducts, increasing the bend angle by up to 60°, as determined through gel mobility shift assays (10Pil P.M. Lippard S.J.

SSRP1 has recently been associated with a factor involved in transcription elongation, 2G. Orphanides, W.-H. Wu, W. S. Lane, M. Hampsey, and D. Reinberg, personal communication. offering further clues for how these proteins might be involved in the antitumor activity. In the present work, fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) was developed as a probe for the further characterization of HMG-domain protein binding to cisplatin-modified DNA. This technique is based on the coupling of transition dipoles between two fluorescent dyes, a donor and an acceptor, attached to a macromolecule. The efficiency of the energy transfer between donor and acceptor depends on the distance between them (16Selvin P.R. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 246: 300-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar). As the distance decreases, the efficiency of the energy transfer should increase. The FRET technique responds to small changes in distance in the range of 10–75 Å (16Selvin P.R. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 246: 300-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar) and can reveal increased bending caused by an HMG-domain protein binding to cisplatin-modified DNA. In addition, FRET has the potential to facilitate kinetic studies of the interaction. FRET has been used extensively to examine different types of nucleic acid structures (17Clegg R.M. Murchie A.I.H.

Recently, FRET techniques were used to investigate bending within a 30-bp oligonucleotide that accompanies the binding of the HMG-domain protein ChironomusHMG1 (26Heyduk E. Heyduk T. Claus P. Wiśniewski J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19763-19770Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The FRET distance measurements determined for theChironomus HMG1-DNA complex enabled a bend angle of 150° to be estimated for the DNA in that complex. Experiments undertaken here similarly examine the bend angle induced when an HMG domain protein binds to cisplatin-modified DNA. A 20-bp oligonucleotide probe modified with fluorescein as the donor and rhodamine as the acceptor was synthesized having a single cisplatin cross-link. Studies of the binding of HMG1 domain B to this FRET probe revealed the increased bending that accompanied protein-DNA complex formation, demonstrating the viability of this approach. In addition to examining the structural change that accompanies HMG1 domain B binding, FRET was employed to monitor the kinetics of the interaction by using stopped-flow techniques. Stopped-flow fluorescence spectroscopic experiments have afforded information about the rates of binding for several other protein-DNA complexes (25Parkhurst K.M. Brenowitz M. Parkhurst L.J.

In these studies, changes in either the intrinsic protein fluorescence or in a DNA probe containing a fluorescent label, resulting from protein-DNA complex formation, were monitored over time. The kinetics of yeast TATA-binding protein interacting with promoter DNA were revealed by FRET (25Parkhurst K.M. Brenowitz M. Parkhurst L.J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 7459-7465Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). As in the present work, these experiments used a fluorescein- and rhodamine-labeled DNA probe to follow protein-DNA complex formation. Here we provide the first quantitative information about the rates at which an HMG-domain protein binds to and dissociates from cisplatin-modified DNA. Distilled, deionized water from a Milli-Q system (Millipore) was used to prepare aqueous solutions. Atomic absorption spectrometry was performed on a Varian AA1475 instrument with a GTA95 graphite furnace. High performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) was carried out by using a Waters 600E system controller equipped with either a Waters 484 or 486 detector. This protein was obtained as described (13Chow C.S. Barnes C.M. Lippard S.J. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 2956-2964Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) with the following modifications. Escherichia coli cells were grown in LB media and lysed by sonication. After passing through the S-Sepharose column, the protein was purified by using an FPLC Superdex 75 size exclusion column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The eluent for the Superdex 75 column was phosphate-buffered saline (1 mmKH2PO4, 10 mmNa2HPO4, 0.137 m NaCl, and 2.7 mm KCl, pH 7.4) with a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. The 20-bp oligonucleotide probes with N-TFA C6 Amino Modifier (Cruachem) attached to the 5′ end were synthesized on a Cruachem PS250 DNA synthesizer by using standard cyanoethylphosphoramidite chemistry. The crude deprotected oligonucleotides were purified by size exclusion chromatography on a G-25 Sephadex (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) column using distilled, deionized water as the eluent. The top strand was modified with 5- and 6-carboxytetramethylrhodamine, succinimidyl ester (Molecular Probes), and the bottom strand was modified with 5- and 6-carboxyfluorescein, succinimidyl ester (Molecular Probes). The composition of the reaction mixture was 200 μm oligonucleotide, 5 mmrhodamine or fluorescein, respectively, and 0.1 m sodium carbonate buffer, pH 9.0. The reactions were stirred at room temperature for approximately 72 h. When the reactions were complete, excess unreacted dye was removed by using Centriplus 3 concentrators (Amicon) followed by dialysis (M rcut-off 1000, Spectra/Por). The FRET probes were purified by reverse phase HPLC on a Vydac C4 preparatory column (22 × 250 mm, 10-μm particle size) using a flow rate of 10 ml/min. Buffer A was 0.1 mNH4OAc, and Buffer B was 0.5 mNH4OAc in 50% CH3CN. The gradient used was 90% Buffer A to 60% Buffer A over 30 min, followed by 60% Buffer A to 50% Buffer A over 10 min. Because the rhodamine and fluorescein dyes employed in the syntheses were a mixture of the 5- and 6-succinimidyl ester isomers, two FRET probes were observed for each synthesis in the HPLC trace. The 5-isomer was the dominant product, eluting with a greater retention time for oligonucleotides labeled with both rhodamine (∼25 min) and fluorescein (∼20 min), and therefore was used in the FRET experiments. Electrospray mass spectrometry was used to characterize the rhodamine-labeled top strand and fluorescein-labeled bottom strand. The molecular mass determined for the rhodamine-labeled top strand with one sodium ion was 6543.45 Da (calculated mass, 6543.03 Da), and the molecular mass determined for the fluorescein-labeled bottom strand with one sodium ion was 6819.45 Da (calculated mass, 6819.03 Da). The purified rhodamine probe was lyophilized, dissolved in distilled, deionized water, and passed through a Dowex 50 × 8–200 (Aldrich) ion exchange column to exchange the ammonium ions for sodium ions. An activated cisplatin solution was made by reaction with 1.97 mol eq of AgNO3 (Aldrich) in distilled, deionized water on a shaker at room temperature overnight in the dark followed by centrifugation to remove the AgCl precipitate. The rhodamine-modified probe was platinated by addition of the activated cisplatin solution (2 eq) to a 100 μm solution of the oligonucleotide. The reaction mixture was incubated at 37 °C for ∼3 h. The product was purified by HPLC, using a Dionex Nucleopac PA-100 (9 × 250 mm) preparatory column at a flow rate of 4 ml/min. It was then eluted with a gradient of 75% Buffer A (0.025 m NH4OAc in 10% CH3CN) to 50% Buffer A/Buffer B (0.025 mNH4OAc, 1 m NaCl in 10% CH3CN) over 30 min. The collected peak was dialyzed (M rcut-off 1000, Spectra/Por) against distilled, deionized water for 48 h. Platinum atomic absorption spectroscopy revealed there to be one platinum atom per oligonucleotide strand. A portion of the 20-bp top strand with the C6 amino modifier described above was purified by HPLC on a Dionex Nucleopac PA-100 (9 × 250 mm) preparatory column. The flow rate was 4 ml/min, and the gradient and buffers were as described above for the rhodamine probe. The collected peak was dialyzed as above. This top strand was used to make the unplatinated, fluorescein-labeled control duplex probe (Fl-ds). The unlabeled cisplatin-modified top strand was made as described previously (32Poklar N. Pilch D.S. Lippard S.J. Redding E.A. Dunham S.U. Breslauer K.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 7606-7611Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar) and used to make the platinated, fluorescein-labeled control duplex probe (Pt/Fl-ds). Fig.1 shows a schematic drawing of the four different oligonucleotide duplex probes and their abbreviations. The fluorescein-labeled bottom strand was combined with unlabeled top strand, with unlabeled, cisplatin-modified top strand, with rhodamine-labeled top strand, or rhodamine-labeled, cisplatin-modified top strand to make the four different FRET probes. Equimolar amounts of the top and bottom strands were combined in a solution containing 10 mm Tris, pH 7.0, 50 mm NaCl, and 10 mm MgCl2. The solution was heated to 90 °C and slowly cooled to 4 °C over several hours. The duplex DNA was purified by ion exchange HPLC to remove excess single-stranded material. A Dionex Nucleopac PA-100 (9 × 250 mm) preparatory column was used at a flow rate of 4 ml/min and a gradient of 70% Buffer A to 45% Buffer A over 30 min, followed by 45% Buffer A to 0% Buffer A over the next 10 min. Under these conditions, the duplexes eluted at ∼35 min. The collected samples were dialyzed against distilled, deionized water for 48 h as above, and the resulting solutions were lyophilized to dryness. The duplex samples were redissolved in 10 mm Tris, pH 7.0, 50 mm NaCl, and 10 mm MgCl2. The solutions were heated to 90 °C and slowly cooled to 4 °C over several hours. A Dionex Nucleopac PA-100 (4 × 250 mm) column was used to check the purity of the final duplex materials by analytical ion exchange HPLC. These experiments were performed with a Hitachi F-3010 spectrofluorimeter at 25 °C. Emission spectra were recorded of both the unmodified and cisplatin-modified duplex probes labeled with both fluorescein and rhodamine in 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.0, and 200 mmNaCl solution in the presence of increasing concentrations of HMG1 domain B. The excitation wavelengths used were 480 and 550 nm, and fluorescence emission spectra were observed at 490–610 and 560–610 nm, respectively. Emission spectra obtained from exciting at 550 nm (rhodamine fluorescence only) were used to correct the data for dilution and photobleaching effects. The corrected emission spectral data at 520 nm were used to determine the dissociation constant,K d. K d values were determined by plotting the change in fluorescence intensity at 520 nm, ΔF, against the total protein concentration, [P t]. The data were fit to the expression described in Equation 1, where [D t] is the total oligonucleotide concentration and c is a constant that relates fluorescence intensity (I) to concentration. The average value ofc was determined to be 1.8 ± 0.5 × 10−9m I−1. This equation is derived directly from the equilibrium mass action expression with no assumptions. The value of [D t] was set to be the concentration of DNA used in each titration experiment.ΔF=(Kd+[Pt]+[Dt])−(Kd+[Pt]+[Dt])2−4[Dt][Pt]2cEquation 1 Time-correlated, single photon counting methods were employed to determine the fluorescence lifetime of the fluorescein in the oligonucleotide duplex probes. Light excitation was accomplished with a synchronously pumped, mode-locked, cavity-dumped picosecond dye laser system. The PUMP laser was a mode-locked Coherent Antares 76-s Nd:YAG (neodymium:yttrium-aluminum-garnet) system, which produced 22 W of 1.06-μm radiation in approximately 80-ps pulses at a repetition rate of 76.0 MHz. External frequency doubling and tripling units (CSK Optronics) were utilized to generate 1.6 W of 355-nm light, which pumped the laser dye coumarin 2 in the home-built system consisting of an extended-cavity Coherent 590 dye laser equipped with a Coherent 7220 cavity dumper. Approximately 15 mW of 450 nm light was generated at a repetition rate of 7.6 MHz, with pulse width of ∼5 ps. The sample was contained in a 1-ml fluorescence cuvette (10 × 10 mm), surrounded by an ice bath to ensure constant temperature, and irradiated within a light-tight box. The fluorescence was detected at right angles to the laser beam; no collection optics were employed, but the size of the active area on the microchannel plate photomultiplier tube (MCP-PMT; 2.0 inches in diameter) and its proximity to the sample (6 inches) ensured nearly f/3 collection efficiency. A combination of colored glass filters (Schott) was employed to act as a notch filter and block from the detector both scattered laser light and emission from the rhodamine on the fluorescent duplexes. This filter combination passed only a narrow band of wavelengths around 500 nm (30 nm, full width at half-maximum). Fluorescence was detected with a two-stage MCP-PMT (Hamamatsu R1564u) having a rise time of 70 ps. The MCP-PMT output was directed through two gain 10, 2.0-GHz preamplifiers (Sonoma Instrument) and then into a constant fraction discriminator (Tennelec TC454). To take advantage of the high repetition rate of the laser, the time-to-amplitude converter (Canberra 2145) was utilized in “reverse” mode, such that pulses from the MCP-PMT provided the “start” pulse, and a time-delayed photodiode (Antel Optronics, ARX-SP, 210-ps rise time) pulse provided the “stop” pulse. The ratio of the photon detection rate to the laser repetition rate was at all times less than 1%, and usually below 0.001. The output of the time-to-amplitude converter was temporarily stored in a multichannel analyzer (Nucleus, Inc., Oak Ridge, TN) and processed on a personal computer. Typical signal integration time was 5 min for one decay measurement. The fluorescence lifetime of the fluorescein dye was measured for 16 different samples by using the apparatus described above. The concentration of all DNA probes was 40 nm duplex in 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.0, and 200 mm NaCl. HMG1 domain B protein was added to the duplex DNA solutions, and fluorescence lifetime data were taken at 0, 1, 10, and 20 eq of added protein. The fluorescein lifetime data were analyzed by using standard least-squares methods. The decays were assumed to conform to Equation 2 (33O'Connor D.V. Phillips D. Time-correlated Single Photon Counting. Academic Press, London1984Google Scholar), in whichD(t) is the “true” decay function,R(t) is the instrument response function, determined experimentally to have a full width at half-maximum of 270 ps by scattering ps laser pulses at the MCP-PMT, and C andt o are constants.I(t)=R(t+to)⊗D(t)+CR(t+to)Equation 2 The CR(t + t o) term provides a correction for laser scatter, which was very difficult to eliminate completely, but always accounted for less than 1% of the detected photons. This correction assumes that the contribution of the scatter to the decay curve is identical to the instrument response function, that is, that all of the scatter arrives at the detector att = 0. The constant t o serves simply to set the zero of time. Both single and double exponential fits were performed (see below). For a single exponential fit, Aexp(−t/τ), the total number of fitted parameters would be four: A, amplitude of decay; τ, lifetime; C, amplitude of scattered light; andt o, zero time. The least-squares algorithm employed was a modified version of the Levenberg-Marquardt routine provided by Numerical Recipes (34Press W.H. Teukolsky S.A. Vetterling W.T. Flannery B.P. Numerical Recipes in FORTRAN. 2nd Ed. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, United Kingdom1992Google Scholar). The fluorescence lifetimes obtained from the fitting of the decay curves were used to calculate the FRET efficiencies and distances. The efficiency of energy transfer between donor and acceptor can be calculated by using Equation 3, where E is the efficiency of the energy transfer, τDA is the fluorescence lifetime of the donor in the presence of acceptor, and τD is the fluorescence lifetime of the donor in the absence of acceptor (16Selvin P.R. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 246: 300-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar).E=1−τDA/τDEquation 3 The distance between donor and acceptor, R, can be calculated from the FRET efficiency, E, according to Equation 4, where R o is a characteristic distance related to the properties of the donor and acceptor at which 50% of the energy is transferred (16Selvin P.R. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 246: 300-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar).R6=Ro6(1−E)/EEquation 4 An R o value of 45 Å determined for fluorescein and rhodamine (20Clegg R.M. Murchie A.I.H. Zechel A. Lilley D.M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 2994-2998Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar) was used to calculate R. Fig. 2 displays the geometric model used to evaluate a bend angle for the HMG1 domain B complex with cisplatin-modified DNA. This model is based on one (20Clegg R.M. Murchie A.I.H. Zechel A.

A. 1994; 91: 11660-11664Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar) where the 20-bp oligonucleotide is represented as a cylinder with the donor and acceptor dyes extending from the ends. Vectors describing the positions of the dyes are determined as the cylinder bends and used to calculate the distance between the dyes. The hinge point of the bend is chosen as the midpoint of the central axis of the cylinder and is designated as the origin in (x, y, z) space. The molecular modeling program QUANTA (Molecular Simulations, Inc.) was used to determine the initial positions of the donor and acceptor dyes. The first aspect examined in the model was the distance of the dyes relative to the center of the cylinder. Models of the two fluorescent dyes with their six-carbon linker chains were constructed and minimized by using the CHARMM routine contained in QUANTA. The measured distance from the center of the fluorophores to the end of the linker chain was ∼1.45 nm for both dyes. If the radius of the DNA is assumed to be 1.0 nm, then the perpendicular distance of the dyes from the center of the cylinder will be 2.45 nm. The dyes may bend in toward or away from the center of the cylinder, as shown in Fig.2. By keeping the 1.0-nm cylinder radius constant and allowing the 1.45-nm dye vector to bend, one can determine the components of the 1.45-nm vector that are perpendicular and parallel to the central cylinder axis. The second crucial aspect of this model is the position of the fluorescent dyes relative to the bend in the DNA. In order to determine these positions, a B-form DNA model of the 20-bp oligonucleotide was constructed in QUANTA with a rhodamine dye docked onto the 5′ end of the top strand and a fluorescein dye docked onto the 5′ end of the bottom strand. A cisplatin fragment analog,cis-{Pt(NH3)-(NH2(CH2)nCH3)}2+, was docked to the N-7 positions of the guanines in the top strand to mark the location of the 1,2-intrastrand d(GpG) cross-link and the corresponding DNA bend. Fig. 3 shows this model, which displays the positions of the fluorescent dyes relative to the cisplatin directed bend when projected down the helix axis. This view represents a slice of the cylinder in an (x,z) plane with the hinge point, (0, 0), lying in the center of the helix. The cisplatin adduct is defined to lie on thex axis. Measuring the angle between the vectors describing the position of the dyes and the x axis allows the components of these vectors along the x and zaxes to be determined. In this case, the angle between the rhodamine vector and the x axis is 70°, and the angle between the rhodamine and fluorescein vectors is 200°. The latter value is in relatively good agreement with the value of 227° used by others (20Clegg R.M. Murchie A.I.H. Zechel A. Lilley D.M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 2994-2998Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). In order to determine the vectors describing the positions of the dyes, both aspects of the model described above were combined. First, the perpendicular components of the 1.45-nm dye vectors were determined as they bend in toward and away from the cylinder. The magnitude of these components was used along with the angles determined in Fig. 3 to calculate the components of the dye vectors along the x andz axes. The component of the vector along the yaxis is the sum of the parallel component of the 1.45-nm dye vector combined with the length of half the cylinder. In this case, since the hinge point is located in the center of the helix, its distance to the top of the cylinder is 3.4 nm (0.34 nm/bp for 10 bp). Once the vectors were determined for a series of rhodamine and fluorescein angles, the distance between the two dyes was calculated. Only certain rhodamine and fluorescein angle pairs will yield the 6.4-nm distance (see “Results and Discussion”) determined for the unplatinated, linear duplex in these FRET experime"

One differentially expressed gene, the human homolog of sui1 (hu-sui1), encodes a translation initiation factor whose expression was suppressed by X antigen in HepG2 cells. Hu-Sui1 was also expressed in nontumor liver but not in tumor cells from patients with hepatocellular carcinoma. Introduction of hu-sui1 into HepG2 cells inhibited cell growth in culture, in soft agar, and partially inhibited tumor formation in nude mice. Hence, the suppression of hu-sui1 by X antigen may result in the abrogation of negative growth regulation and contribute to the development of hepatocellular carcinoma."
https://openalex.org/W2028854133,"Periodontal disease is characterized by inflammation of the periodontium manifested by recruitment of neutrophils, which can degranulate, releasing powerful proteinases responsible for destruction of connective tissues, and eventual loss of tooth attachment. Although the presence of host proteinase inhibitors (serpins) should minimize tissue damage by endogenous proteinases, this is not seen clinically, and it has been speculated that proteolytic inactivation of serpins may contribute to progression of the disease. A major pathogen associated with periodontal disease is the Gram-negative anaerobe Porphyromonas gingivalis, and in this report, we describe a novel proteinase that has been isolated from culture supernatants of this organism that is capable of inactivating the human serpin, α1-proteinase inhibitor, the primary endogenous regulator of human neutrophil elastase. This new enzyme, referred to as periodontain, belongs to the cysteine proteinase family based on inhibition studies and exists as a 75-kDa heterodimer. Furthermore, periodontain shares significant homology to streptopain, a proteinase from Streptococcus pyogenes, and prtT, a putative proteinase from P. gingivalis. Clearly, the presence of this enzyme, which rapidly inactivates α1-proteinase inhibitor, could result in elevated levels of human neutrophil elastase clinically detected in periodontal disease and should be considered as a potential virulence factor for P. gingivalis. Periodontal disease is characterized by inflammation of the periodontium manifested by recruitment of neutrophils, which can degranulate, releasing powerful proteinases responsible for destruction of connective tissues, and eventual loss of tooth attachment. Although the presence of host proteinase inhibitors (serpins) should minimize tissue damage by endogenous proteinases, this is not seen clinically, and it has been speculated that proteolytic inactivation of serpins may contribute to progression of the disease. A major pathogen associated with periodontal disease is the Gram-negative anaerobe Porphyromonas gingivalis, and in this report, we describe a novel proteinase that has been isolated from culture supernatants of this organism that is capable of inactivating the human serpin, α1-proteinase inhibitor, the primary endogenous regulator of human neutrophil elastase. This new enzyme, referred to as periodontain, belongs to the cysteine proteinase family based on inhibition studies and exists as a 75-kDa heterodimer. Furthermore, periodontain shares significant homology to streptopain, a proteinase from Streptococcus pyogenes, and prtT, a putative proteinase from P. gingivalis. Clearly, the presence of this enzyme, which rapidly inactivates α1-proteinase inhibitor, could result in elevated levels of human neutrophil elastase clinically detected in periodontal disease and should be considered as a potential virulence factor for P. gingivalis. The anaerobe Porphyromonas gingivalis has been strongly implicated as a major causative organism of adult onset periodontal disease (1Moore W.E.C. Holdeman L.V. Smibert R.M. Hash D.E. Burmeiter J.A.

Periodontal Res. 1981; 16: 259-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Enzymes from this organism have been found to degrade collagen, fibrinogen, immunoglobulins, complement proteins, and fibronectin, among others (for reviews, see Refs. 5Potempa J. Travis J.

Recent evidence has shown that three proteinases released from P. gingivalis, referred to as gingipains R (Rgp A and Rgp B) 1The abbreviations used are: Rgp, arginine-specific gingipain; α1-PI, α1-proteinase inhibitor; HNE, human neutrophil elastase; GCF, gingival crevicular fluid; RSL, reactive site loop; E-64, l-trans-epoxysuccinyl-leucylamide-(4-guanidino)-butane; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; NCBI, National Center for Biotechnology Information1The abbreviations used are: Rgp, arginine-specific gingipain; α1-PI, α1-proteinase inhibitor; HNE, human neutrophil elastase; GCF, gingival crevicular fluid; RSL, reactive site loop; E-64, l-trans-epoxysuccinyl-leucylamide-(4-guanidino)-butane; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; NCBI, National Center for Biotechnology Informationand gingipain K because of their ability to cleave specifically after arginine and lysine residues, respectively, may have a more physiologically relevant role in modulating the human immune system rather than in their general ability to degrade proteins. Working in concert, these proteinases have already been shown to produce bradykinin from high molecular weight kininogen, either directly or indirectly (kallikrein activation), resulting in vascular permeability enhancement (9Imamura T. Potempa J. Pike R.N. Travis J. Infect. Immun. 1995; 63: 1999-2003Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This mechanism, which is used to provide nutritional components for the growth and proliferation of P. gingivalis, is presumed to be responsible for both the increased gingival crevicular fluid (GCF) and edema noted clinically in the periodontal pockets of patients with advanced periodontitis (10Darany D.G. Beck F.M. Walters J.D. J. Periodontol. 1992; 63: 743-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar).The interaction of P. gingivalis with the host innate immune response have been paradoxical, with both pro- and anti-inflammatory responses reported. For example, P. gingivalislipopolysaccharide has been shown to increase mRNA levels of interleukin 8 in neutrophils (11Sugita N. Kimura A. Matsuki Y. Yamamoto T. Yoshie H. Hara K. Inflammation. 1998; 22: 253-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), whereas gingipains R have been shown to increase neutrophil chemotaxis by release of C5a from C5 of the complement system (12Wingrove J.A. DiScipio R.G. Chen Z. Potempa J. Travis J. Hugli T.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 18902-18907Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, these same proteinases are also capable of cleaving the C5a receptor from infiltrating neutrophils (13Jagels M.A. Travis J. Potempa J. Pike R. Hugli T.E. Infect. Immun. 1996; 64: 1984-1991Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), effectively neutralizing their localized chemotactic activity. Additionally, P. gingivalis cells have the ability to inhibit both interleukin 8 accumulation in gingival epithelial cells (14Darveau R.P. Belton C.M. Reife R.A. Lamont R.J. Infect. Immun. 1998; 66: 1660-1665Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) as well as transepithelial migration (15Madianos P.N. Papapanou P.N. Sandros J. Infect. Immun. 1997; 65: 3983-3990Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These contradictions may be explained by an apparent compartmentalization in the periodontal cavity, whereby distal activation of chemotactic components and proximal paralysis of these same factors create a “leukocyte wall” between the periodontal plaque and gingival epithelium (16Miyasaki K.T. J. Periodontol. 1991; 62: 761-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Indeed, it has recently been reported that soluble gingipains can stimulate interleukin 8 activity, whereas membrane-bound gingipains, with a limited ability to diffuse beyond the plaque surface, completely degrade interleukin 8 (17Mikolajczyk-Pawlinska J. Travis J. Potempa J. FEBS Lett. 1998; 440: 282-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar).The recruitment of neutrophils to the leukocyte wall through both the increased leakage of blood vessels and a chemotactic gradient would at first seem suicidal to P. gingivalis. However, this is not likely to be the case, as this organism has evolved mechanisms to survive in the presence of neutrophils. P. gingivalisproteinases have been shown to degrade C3 of the complement system and immunoglobulins (18Cutler C.W. Arnold R.R. Schenkein H.A. J. Immunol. 1993; 151: 7016-7029PubMed Google Scholar, 19Schenkein H.A. Fletcher H.M. Bodnar M. Macrina F.L. J. Immunol. 1995; 154: 5331-5337PubMed Google Scholar), thereby averting opsonization and subsequent detection by the host. Furthermore, gingipain R has been shown to have an inhibitory effect on the oxidative burst utilized by neutrophils to kill microorganisms (20Kadowaki T. Yoneda M. Okamoto K. Maeda K. Yamamoto K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21371-21378Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Similarly, the bacterial outer membrane ofP. gingivalis can act as an antioxidant sink due to the incorporation of large amounts of heme (21Smalley J.W. Silver J. Marsh P.J. Briss A.J. Biochem. J. 1998; 331: 681-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar).Activated neutrophils in the leukocyte wall undergo degranulation, due to the inability to phagocytize foreign organisms, thereby expelling large quantities of human neutrophil elastase (HNE) and cathepsin G. Although these proteinases can cause abnormal connective tissue destruction, the presence of human plasma proteinase inhibitors (serpins) should minimize this process as they would complex with the endogenous proteinases and be taken up by the liver for degradation. In fact, high protein levels of α1-proteinase inhibitor (α1-PI) have been detected in GCF samples from patients with severe periodontal disease (22Huynh C. Roch-Arveiller M. Meyer J. Giroud J.P. J. Clin. Periodontol. 1992; 19: 187-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar); however, despite the presence of this inhibitor, there also remains a high HNE activity (23Cox S.W. Eley B.M. J. Clin. Periodontol. 1992; 19: 333-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 24Uitto V.J. Nieminen A. Coil J. Hurttia H. Larjava H. J. Clin. Periodontol. 1996; 23: 30-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), indicating that the former must be present in either complexed, oxidized, or proteolytically inactivated forms. This is supported by evidence showing that less than 35% of available α1-PI in the GCF is active as an inhibitor (25Smith Q.T. Wang Y.-D. Sim B. Arch. Oral Biol. 1994; 39: 301-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Furthermore, it has been shown that individuals with α1-PI deficiencies have a significantly higher frequency of periodontal pocket depths ≥5 mm, thereby predisposing them to manifestations of periodontal disease (26Fokkema S.J. Timmerman M.F. van der Weijden F.A. Wolffe G.N. Renggli H.H. J. Clin Periodontol. 1998; 25: 617-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar).Recently, we provided preliminary data that indicated that P. gingivalis elicited a proteinase that rapidly inactivated α1-PI (27Nelson D. Potempa J. Travis J. Anal. Biochem. 1998; 260: 230-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). This enzyme is believed to be at least partially responsible for the altered balance between the levels of HNE and functional inhibitor in the GCF. In this report, we describe the purification and properties of this enzyme, which we refer to as periodontain, not only because of its function as a cysteine proteinase but also because it may act as a putative factor in the dysregulation of α1-PI function in the periodontal cavity. In addition, we provide the deduced protein sequence of periodontain as determined by both partial peptide sequencing of the purified protein and analysis of the P. gingivalis genome.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials UsedDiisopropyl fluorophosphate, leupeptin, and 3,4-dichloroisocoumarin were purchased from Calbiochem. All other materials used were obtained from Sigma, unless otherwise indicated, and were of at least analytical grade.MethodsBacteria CultivationThe strain of P. gingivalis(HG66) that was used for the purification of periodontain was a gift of Dr. Roland Arnold (University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, NC). Cells were grown in 5 liters of broth containing 150 g of trypticase soy broth, 25 g of yeast extract (both from Difco), 25 mg of hemin, 2.5 g of cysteine, 0.5 g of dithiothreitol, and 5 mg of menadione (all from Sigma), anaerobically, at 37 °C for 24 h in an atmosphere of 85% N2, 10% CO2, 5% H2. The seed culture was used to inoculate 100 liters of the same broth, and the bacterium was then grown in a 130-liter fermentor (W.B. Moore, Inc.) at the University of Georgia Fermentation Plant. Cells were grown for 24 h until late stationary phase of bacterial growth (A 660 > 2.0). Additional strains, 33277, W50 (both from ATCC), W12, and 381 (both gifts of Dr. Caroline A. Genco, Boston University Medical School), were grown under the same conditions in 1-liter volumes.Cellular LocalizationWhole cell culture mixtures were fractionated to determine localization of periodontain. First, a low speed centrifugation (6,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C) was used to pellet the cells, after which the supernatant was subjected to high speed ultracentrifugation (100,000 × g for 120 min at 4 °C) to separate vesicles from the supernatant, which contained all soluble proteins. For quantitation of proteolytic activity all samples were brought to an equal volume by the addition of 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4.α1-PI Inactivation AssayDetection of the proteolytic activity of periodontain was determined by following its ability to specifically inactivate α1-PI, using α-chymotrypsin as a target proteinase exactly as described previously (27Nelson D. Potempa J. Travis J. Anal. Biochem. 1998; 260: 230-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Briefly, native α1-PI (0.15 nmol) was mixed with samples containing a putative inactivating activity in assay buffer (50 mm Tris, 10 mm cysteine, pH 7.8) and allowed to incubate for a desired time, after which an equimolar amount of α-chymotrypsin (0.15 nmol) was added to complex any remaining functional α1-PI. The chymotrypsin substrate,N-Suc-Ala-Ala-Pro-Phe-para-nitroanilide, was added and, after a 4-min incubation, an end point absorbance at 405 nm was read in a Molecular Devices SpectraMax Plus spectrophotometer in order to determine the percentage of α1-PI remaining, relative to controls.Proteinase PurificationBacteria were harvested at stationary phase, and the cells were removed by continuous centrifugation (Sharples AS-16P). The cell-free culture fluid was concentrated to 5 liters in a Pellicon system (Millipore), using a 30-kDa molecular mass cut-off membrane, and then precipitated with 7.5 liters of acetone at −10 °C. The protein pellet was redissolved in 20 mm Bis-Tris, 150 mm NaCl, 0.02% NaN3, pH 6.8 (Buffer A), supplemented with 1.5 mm 4,4′-dithiopyridine disulfide, and dialyzed overnight against the same buffer in a 10-kDa molecular mass cut-off membrane (Spectra-Por) with two additional changes of Buffer A supplemented with 5 mm CaCl2. The dialyzed fraction was clarified by centrifugation (40,000 × g for 30 min), concentrated by ultrafiltration (Amicon PM-10 membrane), and applied in 20-ml fractions, each representing 5 liters of starting supernatant, to a Sephadex G-150 column (5 × 105 cm) equilibrated with Buffer A, at a flow rate of 30 ml/h. The activity was pooled, dialyzed against 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4 (Buffer B), and further purified by ion exchange chromatography on a Mono-Q column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, fast protein liquid chromatography system), with elution in a linear gradient of 0–500 mm NaCl in Buffer B. Activity was concentrated and final purification obtained by separation on a TSK-GEL G3000SW (TosoHaas) column using 50 mm Tris, 200 mm NaCl, pH 7.4.ElectrophoresisEnzyme purification and visualization of the heavy and light chains was monitored by SDS-PAGE on a 10% separating gel using the Tris-HCl/Tricine buffer system, according to Schagger and von Jagow (28Schagger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10439) Google Scholar). Nondenaturing PAGE (29Davis B.J. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1964; 121: 404-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (15919) Google Scholar) in a 4–20% gradient gel was used to show the native protein as a single band.Molecular Mass DeterminationThe mass of the native enzyme was determined by gel filtration using a TSK-GEL G3000SW (TosoHaas) calibrated with gel filtration standards (Bio-Rad). The mass of the separated heavy and light chains from SDS-PAGE were estimated by scanning the gel using the Eagle Eye II imaging system (Stratagene) and calculating a linear regression of low molecular weight electrophoresis standards (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) as reference. Accurate molecular mass measurements of the digestion products of α1-PI after enzymatic inactivation employed the use of matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization, with mass spectra acquired using a Vestec matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization linear time-of-flight mass spectrometer (Perspective Biosystems) at the Mass Spectroscopy Facility (University of Georgia, Athens, GA) according to the manufacturer's instructions.Protein Sequence AnalysisFor amino-terminal sequence analysis, proteins resolved by electrophoresis were electrotransferred onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane according to Matsudaira (30Matsudaira P. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 10035-10038Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Sequence analysis was performed with an Applied Biosystems 4760A gas-phase sequencer at the Molecular Genetics Instrumentation Facility (University of Georgia, Athens, Ga) operated according to the manufacturer's recommendations.Inhibition StudiesFor inhibition studies, periodontain was used at a concentration that was capable of completely inactivating 0.15 nmol of α1-PI in our standardized assay (27Nelson D. Potempa J. Travis J. Anal. Biochem. 1998; 260: 230-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) after exactly 1 h of incubation. Representatives of the various classes of proteinase inhibitors, at indicated concentrations, were preincubated with enzyme for 5 min prior to the addition of α1-PI. The cleavage of inhibitor (%) was normalized to a native inhibitor control in order to give the relative percent inactivation for each compound or protein tested against periodontain. The compound,l-trans-epoxysuccinyl-leucylamide-(4-guanidino)-butane (E-64), which stoichiometrically inhibits cysteine proteinases of the papain family, was used to titrate periodontain. This allowed us to quantitate stock solutions of periodontain in terms of active enzyme and make dilutions to the desired concentrations for the degradation experiments described below.Protein and Peptide Degradation by PeriodontainThe degradation of proteins was followed by using either native or reduced, carboxymethylated, maleylated lysozyme (30 μm). Either protein was incubated with periodontain (30 nm) in a final volume of 20 μl of assay buffer for specific time intervals. The reaction was stopped by addition of 20 μl of SDS sample buffer (4% SDS, 20% glycerol, 0.125 m Tris-HCl, pH 6.8), followed by boiling for 5 min, after which the entire sample was electrophoresed on a 12% gel and stained in 0.1% Coomassie Brilliant Blue to visualize the protein bands.To determine the cleavage sites within the reactive site loop (RSL) of α1-PI, inhibitor (20 μg) was incubated with 1 μg of periodontain for 4 h, after which the sample was subjected to 16% SDS-PAGE to separate the ∼ 3-kDa fragment obtained by cleavage within the loop. The fragment was analyzed for both amino-terminal sequence and molecular mass using an automated protein sequencer and mass spectroscopy, respectively, as described above.For analysis of the fragments obtained through digestion of the insulin β-chain, periodontain (8 nm) was incubated with this peptide substrate (40 μm) in assay buffer in a final volume of 90 μl for desired time intervals. After stopping the reaction by the addition of 10 μl of 10 n HCl, samples were centrifuged (10,000 × g for 2 min), and the entire supernatant (100 μl) was subjected to reverse-phase high pressure liquid chromatography. Sample application to a Beckman Ultrasphere 5 μm ODS column (4.6 × 250 mm) equipped with an Ultrasphere 5 μm ODS guard column (4.6 × 45 mm) was carried out in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in water (solvent A) and separations were performed with a linear gradient of 0.08% trifluoroacetic acid in 80% acetonitrile/water (solvent B) over 40 min at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. The peptide elution was monitored at 215 nm.Gelatin ZymographZymography analysis on gelatin gels was performed on pure samples of periodontain in the presence of 5 mm cysteine, with or without 100 μm E-64. After the addition of SDS sample buffer, the samples were subjected to electrophoreses at 4 °C on a 10% SDS-PAGE with gelatin (Difco) (0.1 mg/ml) incorporated into the gel. Following electrophoresis, the gel was washed twice with 2.5% (w/v) Triton X-100 to remove the SDS and then incubated in activation buffer (50 mm Tris, 20 mm cysteine, pH 7.4) at 37 °C for 2 h. The zymograph was developed in 0.1% Amido Black, with clearing zones indicating proteolytic digestion of the incorporated gelatin.Cloning of Gene Fragment Encoding the Amino Terminus of PeriodontainBased on the amino-terminal sequence (23 residues) of the heavy chain (55 kDa) of periodontain, a pair of degenerate oligonucleotide primers (5′-ACNGA(G/A)GGNGTNCCNGC-3′) and (5′-NCGCATNGG(G/A)TC(G/A)TT-3′) corresponding to residues 1–6 (TEGPA) and 19–23 (NDPMR), respectively, were designed. The DNA fragment coding for the amino terminus of periodontain was amplified by PCR using Pwo DNA polymerase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and 10 ng of W50 P. gingivalis DNA (purified by the Purgene kit, Gentra Systems Inc.). PCR was carried out with 500 ng of primers for 1 min at 94 °C, 1 min at 65 °C, and 20 s at 72 °C. The expected product of 69 base pairs was purified from a 2% agarose gel with the Ultrafree MC Millipore filter (Millipore), phosphorylated at the 5′-end with polynucleotide kinase, and blunt end ligated into aSmaI-digested pUC19 vector. The fragment coding for the amino terminus of periodontain was identified by sequence analysis.Identification of the Periodontain GeneA data base containing the unfinished P. gingivalis W83 genome (available from the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI), Unfinished Microbial Genomes at http://www.ncbi.gov) was searched for the presence of nucleotide sequences corresponding to the NH2-terminal amino acid sequences of both chains of periodontain using the TBALSTN algorithm (31Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schaffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Moler W. Lipman D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (59138) Google Scholar). The sequence of the clone, gnl‖TIGR‖P. gingivalis_112, which contained the translated sequence for both chains of periodontain, was retrieved from The Institute for Genomic Research data base (http://www.tigr.org). The gene encoding periodontain was identified using the NCBI open reading frame finder program (also found at NCBI) and the amino acid sequence, obtained by conceptual translation of the entire open reading frame, was further used for homology screening performed with the NCBI BLAST search tool.DISCUSSIONThe multiple trypsin-like proteolytic activities have a significant contribution to the virulence of P. gingivalis,for both invasion and host defense evasion. In support of this concept, deletion of the two genes (rgpA and rgpB) encoding various forms of gingipains R has been shown to attenuatein vitro virulence of the knockout strain (34Nakayama K. Kadowaki T. Okamoto K. Yamamoto K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23619-23626Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). In addition, the use of antibodies to gingipains R polypeptide chain-derived fragments has shown in vivo protection against P. gingivalis infection in a mouse model system (35Genco C.A. Odusanya B.M. Potempa J. Mikolajczyk-Pawlinska J. Travis J. Infect. Immun. 1998; 66: 4108-4114Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Despite the importance of these bacterial proteinases, the abundance of host-derived metalloproteinases and serine proteinases, including active HNE, in the gingival crevicular fluid of individuals with severe periodontitis, is still believed to be the primary factor responsible for much of the extracellular matrix destruction that occurs in this disease (36Cox S.W. Eley B.M. J. Periodontal Res. 1989; 24: 353-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The concentration of HNE within the neutrophil is near 3.0 μm, and it is likely to be as high as 268 μm at sites of inflammation (37Travis J. Pike R. Imamura T. Potempa J. Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med. 1994; 150: S143-S146Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), such as those that occur during the development of another major connective tissue disease, pulmonary emphysema.The regulating inhibitor of HNE is α1-PI, a plasma protein that forms a complex with this proteinase and is rapidly removed from the circulation and degraded (38Mast A. Enghild J.J. Nagase H. Suzuki K. Pizzo S.V. Salvesen G. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15810-15816Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The inhibitor, however, can itself be inactivated by either oxidation at its reactive site or by proteolytic cleavage by nontarget proteinases within the RSL region (27Nelson D. Potempa J. Travis J. Anal. Biochem. 1998; 260: 230-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 39Travis J. Salvesen G.S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1983; 52: 655-709Crossref PubMed Scopus (1473) Google Scholar), and it is believed that both mechanisms occur during the development of emphysema. Certainly, the high levels of active HNE in the GCF, despite the presence of α1-PI, would suggest that parallel mechanisms for inhibitor inactivation may be also occurring in periodontal disease (37Travis J. Pike R. Imamura T. Potempa J. Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med. 1994; 150: S143-S146Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In this respect, it has been reported that whole cells or culture supernatants from P. gingivalis are capable of proteolytically inactivating α1-PI (40Grenier D. Microbiology. 1996; 142: 955-961Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 41Carlsson J. Herrmann B.F. Hofling J.F. Sundqvist G.K. Infect. Immun. 1984; 43: 644-648Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), although it is clear that this is not due to any of the gingipain R or K forms because the inhibitor contains no basic residues within its RSL (42Potempa J. Mikolajczyk-Pawlinska J. Brassell D. Nelson D. Thogersen I.B. Enghild J.J. Travis J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21648-21657Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Thus, another proteinase(s) must be involved in this process, and it is likely that periodontain, the enzyme described in this report, serves this purpose.Periodontain was easily purified from P. gingivalis culture fluids and was found to be a cysteine proteinase that is apparently produced as a heterodimer. This enzyme is similar to the other characterized cysteine proteinases from P. gingivalis in that all are primarily secreted in strain HG66, yet are present on membranes and vesicles in all other strains. Each has a signal peptide sequence, a long prepropeptide, a large catalytic domain (∼50 kDa), and an additional carboxyl-terminal extension (20–40 kDa). In contrast, whereas the gingipains have a highly restrictive specificity, periodontain is characterized by an apparently nonspecific proteolysis of peptides or denatured proteins. Although the ability of this enzyme to hydrolyze α1-PI, a native protein, is contrary to our premise of its inability to cleave proteins with defined structure, this can be explained by the fact that the RSL is present in a flexible, extended conformation protruding above the protein core (43Elliott P.R. Abrahams J.-P. Lomas D.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 275: 419-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar) and, as such, may mimic a denatured protein or peptide.From analysis of the amino terminus of the catalytic subunit and subsequent cloning of this fragment, we were able to elucidate the entire gene sequence from the partially completed genome sequence forP. gingivalis obtained from NCBI. Searching the data base of known sequences has revealed that periodontain is highly homologous to both PrtT, a putative cysteine proteinase from P. gingivalis, and streptopain (EC 3.4.22.10), a secreted cysteine proteinase from Streptococcus pyogenes (TableIII and Fig. 5). The prtTgene, which has recently been cloned and sequenced (44Otogoto J.I. Kuramitsu H.K. Infect. Immun. 1993; 61: 117-123Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 45Madden T.E. Clark V.L. Kuramitsu H.K. Infect. Immun. 1995; 63: 238-247Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), is believed to encode a putative proteinase of 96–99 kDa. It is not surprising that periodontain and prtT have highly homologous sequences, being from the same organism. Indeed, rgpA andrgpB are two completely separate genes that code for almost identical proteins with significantly overlapping specificity. However, until the gene product for prtT has been purified and characterized, functional similarities between PrtT and periodontain cannot be assessed.Table IIIHomology of periodontain with streptopain and prtT (identity/similarity)DomainStreptopainprtTPrepropeptide27/4435 /56Catalytic subunit37/5252 /69C-terminal subunitN/AaN/A, not applicable.24 /42Full-length proteinN/A34 /52a N/A, not applicable.

The pyridoxal 5′-phosphate cofactor at the active site undergoes changes in absorptive properties during substrate binding and catalysis that have allowed us to study the kinetics of these reactions spectroscopically. Rapid scanning stopped-flow experiments of murine erythroid 5-aminolevulinate synthase demonstrate that reaction with glycine plus succinyl-CoA results in a pre-steady-state burst of quinonoid intermediate formation. Thus, a step following binding of substrates and initial quinonoid intermediate formation is rate-determining. The steady-state spectrum of the enzyme is similar to that formed in the presence of 5-aminolevulinate, suggesting that release of this product limits the overall rate. Reaction of either glycine or 5-aminolevulinate with ALAS is slow (k f = 0.15 s−1) and approximatesk cat. The rate constant for reaction with glycine is increased at least 90-fold in the presence of succinyl-CoA and most likely represents a slow conformational change of the enzyme that is accelerated by succinyl-CoA. The slow rate of reaction of 5-aminolevulinate with ALAS is 5-aminolevulinate-independent, suggesting that it also represents a slow isomerization of the enzyme. Reaction of succinyl-CoA with the enzyme-glycine complex to form a quinonoid intermediate is a biphasic process and may be irreversible. Taken together, the data suggest that turnover is limited by release of 5-aminolevulinate or a conformational change associated with 5-aminolevulinate release. 5-Aminolevulinate synthase (ALAS) is the first enzyme of the heme biosynthetic pathway in non-plant eukaryotes and the α-subclass of purple bacteria.

Jordan P.M. Haslam E. 1st Ed. Comprehensive Organic Chemistry: The Synthesis and Reactions of Organic Compounds. 5. Pergamon Press, Oxford and New York1979: 1121-1144Google Scholar). This reaction is the first step of heme biosynthesis in non-plant eukaryotes and the α-subclass of purple bacteria (2Ferreira G.C. Gong J. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1995; 27: 151-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). ALAS utilizes PLP as an obligatory cofactor and is evolutionarily related to transaminases (3Alexander F.W. Sandmeier E. Mehta P.K. Christen P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 219: 953-960Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). Mammals encode two distinct ALAS isoforms, one of which is expressed only in developing erythrocytes (4May B.K. Dogra S.C. Sadlon T.J. Bhasker C.R. Cox T.C. Bottomley S.S. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol. Biol. 1995; 51: 1-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). The erythroid-specific ALAS isoform accounts for approximately 90% of the heme in the body, and defects in the gene are associated with the erythropoietic disorder, X-linked sideroblastic anemia (5Bottomley S.S. May B.K. Cox T.C. Cotter P.D. Bishop D.F. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1995; 27: 161-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Current understanding of the ALAS catalytic mechanism is founded largely upon the results of radiolabeling studies conducted before the advent of molecular cloning technology and is summarized in Fig.1 (6Kikuchi G. Kumar A. Talmage P. Shemin D. J. Biol. Chem. 1958; 233: 1214-1219Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7Zaman Z. Jordan P.M. Akhtar M. Biochem.

Following formation of an external aldimine with glycine (II), the pro-Rproton of glycine is lost, transiently forming a quinonoid intermediate (III) in the presence of succinyl-CoA (10Nandi D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 8872-8877Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Condensation with succinyl-CoA results in formation of an aldimine to α-amino-β-ketoadipate (V). The glycine-derived carboxyl group is then lost (VI) and replaced by a proton to form an aldimine to ALA (VII), which dissociates to regenerate the holoenzyme. It had been considered in the literature that the carboxyl group of glycine might be lost before condensation with succinyl-CoA. This possibility was discounted when it was found that in the presence of glycine alone ALAS labilizes the pro-R proton but does not catalyze decarboxylation. Another possible mechanism involved the dissociation of the α-amino-β-ketoadipate intermediate (V) from the enzyme, followed by spontaneous decarboxylation to yield ALA. However, the observation that the pro-S proton of glycine is found in the pro-S position of ALA indicates that the decarboxylation of the α-amino-β-ketoadipate intermediate must occur on the enzyme surface, because if it had occurred free in solution the C-5 position of product ALA would be racemic. Whereas the chemical mechanism of ALAS is well characterized, much less is known about the kinetic mechanism and the role the protein plays in catalyzing the reaction. ALAS exists as a homodimer in which the active site resides at the subunit interface (11Tan D. Ferreira G.C. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 8934-8941Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Steady-state kinetic studies demonstrate a sequential mechanism with glycine binding before succinyl-CoA and with ALA released last (10Nandi D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 8872-8877Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Fanica-Gaignier M. Clement-Metral J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1973; 40: 19-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Turnover is slow, with a k cat of 0.17 s−1 at pH 7.2 and 30 °C (13Gong J. Hunter G.A. Ferreira G.C. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 3509-3517Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Lysine 313 of murine erythroid ALAS forms a Schiff base with the PLP cofactor in the absence of amino acid substrate (14Ferreira G.C. Neame P.J. Dailey H.A. Protein Sci. 1993; 2: 1959-1965Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). This residue is not essential for the binding of glycine or ALA, but it is required for catalysis (15Ferreira G.C. Vajapey U. Hafez O. Hunter G.A. Barber M.J. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 1001-1006PubMed Google Scholar). A crystal structure of ALAS is not currently available, but the evolutionary relatedness to other, more extensively characterized PLP-dependent enzymes, and in particular aspartate aminotransferase, has provided a basis for homology modeling studies of ALAS structure and function (13Gong J. Hunter G.A. Ferreira G.C. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 3509-3517Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 16Tan D. Harrison T. Hunter G.A. Ferreira G.C.

Arginine 439 has been shown to be important for the recognition and binding of the carboxyl group of the substrate glycine (16Tan D. Harrison T. Hunter G.A. Ferreira G.C. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 1478-1484Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), and aspartate 279 has been identified as a crucial residue that enhances the electron withdrawing capacity of the PLP cofactor by stabilizing the protonated form of the cofactor ring nitrogen (13Gong J. Hunter G.A. Ferreira G.C. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 3509-3517Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Additionally, tyrosine 121 has been implicated in binding the PLP cofactor (17Tan D. Barber M.J. Ferreira G.C. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 1208-1213Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). To understand more precisely the role(s) of these and other active site amino acids in the catalytic process, a quantitative assessment of the microscopic rate constants governing the wild-type reaction is a necessary prerequisite. Overproduction of recombinant murine erythroid ALAS inEscherichia coli has allowed us to begin detailed studies of the reaction mechanism. Here we present the results of stopped-flow absorbance studies of the reactions of ALAS with glycine and ALA, as well as the initial chemical event of the reaction cycle, the removal of the pro-R proton of glycine in the presence of succinyl-CoA to form a quinonoid intermediate. The following reagents were from Sigma: DEAE-Sephacel, β-mercaptoethanol, PLP, bovine serum albumin, α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase, α-ketoglutarate, NAD+, thiamin pyrophosphate, succinyl-CoA, ALA-hydrochloride, HEPES free acid, and the bicinchoninic acid protein determination kit. Glycerol, mono- and dibasic potassium phosphate, disodium EDTA dihydrate, ammonium sulfate, magnesium chloride hexahydrate, glycine, and sodium hydroxide were purchased from Fisher. Ultrogel AcA 44 was from IBF Biotechnics. The bicinchoninic acid protein determination kit was from Pierce. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide electrophoresis reagents were supplied by Bio-Rad. Recombinant murine erythroid ALAS was overproduced inE. coli and purified as described previously (18Ferreira G.C. Dailey H.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 584-590Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), with the following modifications to the protein purification procedure. 1) The pH level of buffer A (20 mm potassium phosphate, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol) was increased to 7.5; and 2) a 20–35% (by saturation) ammonium sulfate fractionation was utilized rather than the 0–40% (w/v) ammonium sulfate precipitation step. Following cell disruption and centrifugation, the magnetically stirred cytosoluble homogenate was raised to 20% saturation with respect to ammonium sulfate by dropwise addition of buffer A, pH 7.5, saturated with respect to ammonium sulfate at 4 °C. The solution was centrifuged at 35,000 ×g for 15 min and the supernatant brought up to 35% saturation with respect to ammonium sulfate as described above. Rapid precipitation was typically observable when the solution reached 30–33% ammonium sulfate saturation. After a 15-min centrifugation at 35,000 × g the pellet was redissolved in a minimal volume of buffer A, pH 7.5, and applied to the AcA 44 gel filtration column and then to a DEAE-Sephacel column as described (18Ferreira G.C. Dailey H.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 584-590Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Following purification, the enzyme was either dialyzed directly into 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, containing 10% v/v glycerol, or it was concentrated by pressurized dialysis in an Amicon 8050 stir cell equipped with a YM30 membrane before dialysis into the HEPES-glycerol buffer. Unless otherwise noted this buffer was used in each of the experiments reported here. The presence of glycerol was essential to keep the enzyme solubilized. The purified ALAS protein, typically at a concentration of 10–200 μm, was stored under liquid nitrogen in Nalgene 2.0-ml polypropylene cryovials when not in use and thawed by incubating the cryovials in 23 °C tap water for 5–10 min. Protein purity was determined by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (19Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206631) Google Scholar) and was never less than 95%. Enzymatic activity was determined using a continuous spectrophotometric assay (20Hunter G.A. Ferreira G.C. Anal. Biochem. 1995; 226: 221-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Protein concentration was determined by the bicinchoninic acid method using bovine serum albumin as standard as described previously (13Gong J. Hunter G.A. Ferreira G.C. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 3509-3517Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), and all protein concentrations are reported based on a subunit molecular mass of 56,000 Da. Rapid scanning stopped-flow kinetic measurements were conducted using a model RSM-1000 stopped-flow spectrophotometer equipped with a stopped-flow mixer with an optical path length of 1.5 mm (OLIS, Inc.). The dead time of this instrument is about 2 ms. Scans covering the wavelength range of 315–545 nm were collected at a rate of 1000 scans/s. For reactions longer than 3 s, the collected scans were averaged to yield either 62 or 31 scans/s to condense data files to a manageable size. An external water bath was used to maintain the temperature of the syringes (containing the reactants) and the stopped-flow cell compartment at 30 °C. The concentration of enzyme and ligands loaded into the syringes were always 2-fold greater than that reported in the figure legends, such that the reported concentrations represent the final concentrations present in the cell compartment after mixing. The concentration of reacting ligand utilized was never less than 10-fold greater than the enzyme concentration to ensure that pseudo-first order kinetics were observed. Time courses at wavelengths of interest were analyzed by fitting to equations for one to three exponentials with the SIFIT program supplied with the instrument, whereA t is the absorbance at timet, a is the amplitude of each phase, kis the observed rate constant for each phase, and c is the final absorbance.At=∑n=13aie−kit+cEquation 1 Qualities of fit were assessed both from visual analysis of the calculated residuals and from the Durbin-Watson ratio (21Durbin J.

Data were collected at a rate of 1000 scans/s and were averaged to yield 62 scans/s. The first event observed is the formation of a quinonoid intermediate absorption at 510 nm. The pre-steady-state burst of quinonoid intermediate formation reaches a plateau at 130 ms before it decays into the steady state (Fig.2 B). Upon exhaustion of succinyl-CoA, the limiting substrate, the steady-state quinonoid intermediate absorbance decays to a final value slightly greater than the starting absorbance. An expanded view of the first 3 s of the reaction is given in theinset. This portion of the time course could be described by a two-exponential process with rates of 12.6 and 1.82 s−1for quinonoid intermediate formation and decay into the steady state, respectively. The plot of the residual error associated with this fit had some structured deviation from ideality in the early data points, suggesting the time course might be better fit by a three-exponential process. This was not possible for this particular time course. however, because of an insufficient number of data points describing the process of quinonoid intermediate formation, but it was possible when the data were not averaged to give more data points in this region of the time course (see below). Representative spectra from the 2,500 spectra collected are shown in Fig. 2 C. Spectra corresponding to time 0 and 0.128 s are identical to those given in Fig. 2 A and are shown here for comparative purposes only. The spectrum at 4 s corresponds to ALAS during steady-state catalysis and shows considerable quinonoid intermediate absorption. The spectrum at 40 s also indicates some residual quinonoid intermediate absorption because of the accumulation of ALA, which binds to ALAS some 300-fold more tightly than glycine at pH 7.5. 2G. A. Hunter and G. C. Ferreira, unpublished observations. The reaction of glycine with ALAS can be analyzed by the increase in absorbance at 425 nm (15Ferreira G.C. Vajapey U. Hafez O. Hunter G.A. Barber M.J. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 1001-1006PubMed Google Scholar). The reaction of 65 μm murine erythroid ALAS with 100 mm glycine at pH 7.5 and 30 °C requires more than 30 s to reach equilibrium even at this saturating concentration of glycine (Fig. 3). The time course was best described by a biphasic process, with rates for the fast and slow phases of 1.16 ± 0.04 and 0.118 ± 0.001 s−1, respectively. The small amplitude of the fast phase resulted in a low signal to noise ratio. It was not possible to determine reliably the effect of glycine concentration on the observed rate constant for this phase. It was possible, however, to determine the concentration dependence of the slow phase, as shown in Fig. 3 B. The hyperbolic nature of the rate dependence verifies that the reaction of glycine with ALAS is a two-step process involving a kinetically significant intermediate. The data were fit to Equation 3 for a two-step process. The best fit of the points gave a value ofK d = 44 ± 9 mm for the initial binding, followed by k f = 0.15 ± 0.01 s−1 and k r = 0.028 ± 0.006 s−1, giving an overall binding K d of 8 mm. The interaction of ALA and ALAS includes the binding and formation of a stable quinonoid complex. The time dependence of this reaction is shown in Fig. 4 A, which records the reaction of 2 mm ALA with 65 μm ALAS at pH 7.5 and 30 °C. No evidence of an initial increase in absorbance at 420 nm is observed prior to formation of the quinonoid intermediate, and instead the kinetics are dominated by quinonoid complex formation. A biphasic process describes the time course of the reaction at 510 nm, with observed rates for the fast and slow phases of 1.43 and 0.147 s−1, respectively. The rate dependence on ALA concentration was also determined, as shown in Fig. 4 B. The fast phase was saturable, and a fit to Equation 3 yields values ofK d = 700 ± 300 μm,k 1 = 1.2 ± 0.2 s−1, andk −1 = 0.6 ± 0.2 s−1, respectively. The second, slow phase was concentration-independent, with a value of 0.15 ± 0.02 s−1. The pre-steady-state reaction of 25 μm murine erythroid ALAS-glycine complex (100 mm glycine) with 400 μm succinyl-CoA at pH 7.5 and 30 °C is depicted in Fig. 5. A fit of the data to a biphasic process left some structured deviation in the residuals (Fig.5 A). The Durbin-Watson ratio for this fit was less than 1, indicating a suboptimal fit. A satisfactory fit was obtained by fitting to a triphasic process (Fig. 5 B) and in the fit to the experimental data points (Fig. 5 C, solid line). The Durbin-Watson ratio for this fit was 1.16. Binding of succinyl-CoA and conversion of the ternary complex into a quinonoid intermediate thus occur in two kinetic steps, the first of which can be seen at 510 nm as a concave inflection with k obs = 53 s−1. The second, slower phase occurs withk obs = 18 s−1 and is followed by decay into the steady state. At 25 μm ALAS-glycine, the three phases for reaction of succinyl-CoA with the ALAS-glycine complex were resolvable, and it was possible to determine the effect of succinyl-CoA on the observed rate constants down to 240 μm succinyl-CoA (Fig.5 D). To acquire pseudo-first order rate constants at lower succinyl-CoA concentrations, and thus investigate the possibility of saturation kinetic behavior for the slow phase, the ALAS-glycine concentration was lowered to 10 μm. At this concentration the fast phase was not resolved from the slow phase, and a rate constant could be computed only for the slow phase. The rate of the fast phase was linearly dependent on the concentration of succinyl-CoA, with a non-zero intercept, whereas the slow phase was saturable. These data are consistent with two-step reaction kinetics of the following type.A⇌k−1k1B⇌k−2k2CEquation 4 k 1 is defined as the slope of the best fit line to the fast phase and equals 67,000 ± 4,000m−1 s−1. The intercept of this line, 29 ± 4 s−1, is equal to the sum of the other three rate constants, k −1,k 2, and k −2. A fit of the slow phase data to Equation 3 yields values ofK d = 110 ± 50 μm,k 2 = 21 ± 2 s−1, andk −2 = 1.4 ± 0.5 s−1. The maximal rate of the slow phase, equivalent to the sum ofk 2 and k −2, differs from the intercept value of the fast phase by 7 ± 4 s−1, yielding estimates of all four rate constants. The pre-steady-state kinetics of murine erythroid ALAS have been here investigated for the first time. The PLP cofactor at the active site of the holoenzyme undergoes changes in absorptive properties during catalysis that have allowed us to characterize both the reactions of ALAS with glycine and ALA and the initial chemical event in the forward reaction, removal of the pro-R proton of glycine to form a quinonoid intermediate. In contrast to the quinonoid intermediate formed in the presence of ALA, this quinonoid intermediate is unstable and decays rapidly. The data support a model in which release of the product ALA, or a conformational change associated with the release of ALA, limits the turnover rate. A pre-steady-state burst of quinonoid intermediate formation is observed when saturating concentrations of substrates are simultaneously reacted with ALAS. The observation of burst kinetics under these conditions indicates that a step following binding of substrates and formation of the initial quinonoid intermediate is rate-determining. The absorbance spectrum of ALAS during steady-state catalysis is also informative, because in the steady state the largest proportion of intermediates at any given instance will be at the rate-determining step. The steady-state spectrum will thus be that of the rate-limiting step if one step is completely rate-limiting, or it will be the sum of more than one intermediate if multiple steps are partially rate-limiting. Because considerable quinonoid intermediate is observed during steady-state catalysis, and the formation and decay of the first quinonoid intermediate occur faster thank cat, this quinonoid intermediate must correspond to the one formed in the presence of the product ALA. The data from this experiment thus indicate that the rate-determining step is associated with product release and suggest that it is associated with the release of ALA rather than CoA or carbon dioxide. Steady-state product inhibition studies have demonstrated that the first step of the ALAS catalytic cycle is the binding of glycine (10Nandi D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 8872-8877Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,12Fanica-Gaignier M. Clement-Metral J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1973; 40: 19-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). In the absence of succinyl-CoA, glycine binding is a two-step process. These steps could represent an initial noncovalent interaction followed by slow conversion of the internal aldimine to the external aldimine or formation of the external aldimine followed by a slow conformational change of the enzyme, among other possibilities. Many PLP-dependent enzymes, including aspartate aminotransferase (22Rhee S. Silva M.M. Hyde C.C. Rogers P.H. Metzler C.M. Metzler D.E. Arnone A. J. Biol.

(Tokyo). 1994; 116: 95-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Closure of the enzyme around the substrate appears to function primarily to increase substrate specificity. Interestingly,d-amino acid aminotransferase, a PLP-dependent enzyme that does not undergo significant conformational changes during reaction, has a broad substrate specificity (29Peisach D. Chipman D.M. Van Ophem P.W. Manning J.M. Ringe D. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 4958-4967Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 30Yonaha K. Misono H. Yamamoto T. Soda K. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 6983-6989Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). ALAS, however, shows strict substrate specificity for glycine; no other naturally occurring amino acid has been found to act as a substrate (31Jordan P.M. Dailey H.A. Biosynthesis of Heme and Chlorophylls. McGraw-Hill, New York1990: 55-121Google Scholar). These considerations argue that ALAS probably does undergo some structural rearrangement during catalysis. In the absence of succinyl-CoA, glycine reacts with ALAS in two kinetic steps. We postulate that these steps represent an initial binding step followed by a conformational change of the enzyme-glycine complex. The second step occurs with a rate constant of 0.15 s−1, a rate that approximates k cat, suggesting that it may limit turnover. When 100 mm glycine and 100 μm succinyl-CoA are added to ALAS simultaneously, however, the first observed event is formation of a quinonoid intermediate with an observed pseudo-first order rate constant of 12 s−1. The rate constant of the second step of the reaction of glycine with ALAS in this experiment could be no less than 12 s−1, 90-fold faster than in the absence of succinyl-CoA. If the slow step of the glycine binding reaction is a conformational change to a catalytically active configuration, one possible explanation for this phenomenon is that succinyl-CoA accelerates the rate at which this conformational change occurs. Another possibility is that succinyl-CoA acts as an allosteric effector for glycine binding by binding at some site distal from the active site. Reaction of ALA with ALAS differs from reaction with glycine in that ALA is converted to a quinonoid intermediate, whereas glycine is bound as a stable external aldimine. ALA reacts to form a quinonoid intermediate in two phases. The fast phase is saturable with a rapid equilibrium K d of 700 ± 300 μm,k f = 1.2 ± 0.2 s−1 andk r = 0.6 ± 0.2 s−1. This is followed by a slow phase of 0.15 ± 0.02 s−1 that is independent of the ALA concentration and identical to the rate at which glycine reacts in the absence of succinyl-CoA. The reaction between ALA and ALAS thus occurs in three kinetic steps and appears to be analogous to the reaction of glycine with ALAS with the addition of one step, which probably represents the process of quinonoid intermediate formation. The value of 0.6 ± 0.2 s−1 fork r indicates that the release of ALA is at least partially rate-determining. The requirements for excess substrate, and enough enzyme to observe sufficient signal, precluded a more precise determination of this rate constant. If this reaction could be monitored by fluorescence emission, the greater sensitivity of fluorescence detection stopped flow would permit the use of lower ALAS concentrations, which would in turn permit the measurement ofk obs at lower ALA concentrations. Fluorescence detection might also allow a more precise determination of the reverse rate constant for the second step of quinonoid intermediate formation, a reaction that may be irreversible. The kinetic data obtained in this study are summarized in Fig.6. The strict substrate specificity of ALAS for glycine is not observed with the second substrate, succinyl-CoA (31Jordan P.M. Dailey H.A. Biosynthesis of Heme and Chlorophylls. McGraw-Hill, New York1990: 55-121Google Scholar). The maximal rates of reaction of ALAS with glycine and a series of different CoA esters have been reported (32Shoolingin-Jordan P.M. LeLean J.E. Lloyd A.J. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 281: 309-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the maximal rates for the various compounds are similar to succinyl-CoA and in some cases markedly higher. Identical rates of reaction of a series of related substrates are often considered evidence for the formation of a common structural intermediate that precedes the rate-determining step (33Wang W. Hedstrom L. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 8479-8483Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 34Berndt M.C. Bowles M.R. King G.J. Zerner B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1298: 159-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 35Zhang Z.Y. Van Etten R.L. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 8954-8959Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 36Kirsch J.F. Igelstrom M. Biochemistry. 1966; 5: 783-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). A similar interpretation for ALAS is complicated by the observation that different CoA esters would necessarily give rise to different chemical intermediates and hence different products. A viable hypothesis would be that the various CoA esters each stimulate the same conformational change of the enzyme to a common conformer and the breakdown of this conformer to the initial state limits the rate of the overall reaction. Thus, the possibility that the kinetics of ALAS catalysis are dominated by interconversion of the enzyme between alternate conformations has not been discounted. An oversimplified model for this would be that ALAS exists in two conformational states, an open conformation in which the substrates bind and a closed conformation induced by substrate binding. Conversion of the open conformation to the closed conformation upon binding of either glycine or ALA is slow. In the presence of both glycine and succinyl-CoA, the rate of the conformational change is appreciably accelerated. Because ALA alone does not accelerate the conformational change, it appears that the impetus for lowering the energy barrier for going to the closed conformation is supplied from binding energy to the coenzyme A portion of succinyl-CoA. Thus, binding interactions between ALAS and the CoA portion of succinyl-CoA may drive a conformational change of ALAS toward the closed state wherein the condensation between glycine and succinyl-CoA occurs. CoA is then expelled, removing the energetic impetus for maintaining the closed conformation, and the enzyme slowly returns to the open conformation as ALA is released. In this model the rate-determining step is not simply the release of the product ALA from the enzyme but is a conformational change associated with release of ALA. This model could be tested in a number of ways. Fluorescence detection stopped-flow, circular dichroism, and isotope exchange studies should each offer more insight into the reaction mechanism.

PI3K has been implicated in a wide range of signaling pathways including those regulating proliferation and cell migration (12Vanhaesebroeck B. Leevers S.J. Panayotou G.

The modular domains in p85α possess intrinsic signaling functions, in that they bind numerous intracellular ligands and mediate the formation of multiprotein complexes. The proline-rich motifs bind the SH3 domains of the Src family tyrosine kinases, Lyn and Fyn (13Pleiman C.M. Hertz W.M. Cambier J.C.

The roles of the various isoforms of the adaptor subunits of the Class IA PI3Ks are as yet undefined. Some isoforms, especially the truncated isoforms p55α and p50α, have been shown to have restricted tissue distributions (9Inukai K. Funaki M. Ogihara T. Katagiri H. Kanda A. Anai M. Fukushima Y. Hosaka T. Suzuki M. Shin B.C. Takata K. Yazaki Y. Kikuchi M. Oka Y. Asano T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7873-7882Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar) compared with the 85-kDa isoforms. In addition, the truncated isoforms are clearly unable to interact with proline-rich motif- or SH3 domain-containing proteins or with small G proteins, and it has been shown that there is some selectivity in the recruitment of p85 isoforms by receptor tyrosine kinases (20Shepherd P.R. Nave B.T. Rincon J. Nolte L.A. Bevan A.P. Siddle K. Zierath J.R. Wallberg Henriksson H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19000-19007Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). However, it is not yet understood whether the large number of isoforms of both subunits of PI3K represents a functional redundancy or reflects a form of signaling specificity. We have therefore undertaken a detailed study of the potential interactions of the individual domains of the p85 protein in order to elucidate their roles within the adaptor subunit as a whole.

All cDNAs in pGEX-2T were expressed as glutathioneS-transferase fusion proteins and purified by glutathione affinity chromatography according to the manufacturer's instructions. cDNAs in the baculovirus transfer plasmid pVL1393 were co-transfected into Sf9 cells with BaculoGold-linearized baculovirus DNA (PharMingen), whereas those in the transfer plasmid pBlueBac4 were co-transfected into Sf9 cells with Bac-N-Blue baculovirus DNA (Invitrogen). The recombinant baculovirus was plaque-purified and amplified as described previously (25O'Reilly D.R. Miller L.K. Luckow V.A. Baculovirus Expression Vectors: A Laboratory Manual. Oxford University Press, New York1994Google Scholar). Exponentially growing Sf9 cells at a density of 1.5–2 × 106/ml were infected with recombinant baculoviruses at an multiplicity of infection between 10 and 20 and harvested 2–3 days post-infection. SV40-transformed monkey kidney cells (Cos7) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, at 37 °C and 10% CO2. Transient transfections were performed using DEAE-Dextran (Sigma). Cells (50% confluent) were transfected with 15 μg of plasmid DNA per 15-cm tissue culture dish and harvested 48 h post-transfection. Sf9 cells expressing recombinant p85 variants were lysed in Triton X-100 lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 5 mm dithiothreitol (DTT), and a range of protease inhibitors (50 μg/ml 4-(2-aminoethyl)-benzenesulphenylfluoride hydrochloride, 16 μg/ml benzamidine, 10 μg/ml 1,10-phenanthroline, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 5 μg/ml pepstatin A)). p85 variants were purified by affinity chromatography using a phosphotyrosine-affinity column that was synthesized by immobilizing 2 mg of phosphotyrosine (Sigma) per ml of Actigel (Sterogene) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, up to 50 ml of cell lysate was applied to a 14 × 1-cm column of phosphotyrosine-Actigel equilibrated in Buffer A (20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, containing 5 mmDTT) and eluted with 50 ml of Buffer A followed by 50 ml of Buffer A containing 150 mm NaCl and 50 ml of Buffer A containing 2m NaCl. Fractions of 2.5 ml were collected at a flow rate of 2.5 ml/min and exchanged into 3.5 ml of Buffer A using pre-packed Sephadex G-25 columns (PD10, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). If a second purification step was required, fractions containing p85 variants were pooled and applied to a 0.46 × 10-cm POROS 20 HQ column (Perspective Biosystems) equilibrated in Buffer A. Elution was carried out using 17 ml of Buffer A followed by a 75-ml linear gradient to 1m NaCl in the same buffer. Fractions of 2.5 ml were collected at a flow rate of 2.5 ml/min. Transfected or wild type Cos7 cells were harvested by trypsinization and Dounce-homogenized in hypotonic lysis buffer (5 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 2.5 mm KCl, 1 mmDTT, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsufonyl fluoride, 10 μm leupeptin, 10 μm pepstatin A, 1 mm 1,10-phenanthroline, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate). The cytoplasmic fraction was clarified by centrifugation at 100,000 × g at 4 °C for 45 min and filtered through a 0.22-μm membrane (Ultrafree-MC, Millipore). Aliquots of 200 μl or less of molecular mass standards (Bio-Rad), recombinant proteins, or cell lysates were applied to a Superose 12/30 HR column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated in TBS (20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl). Samples were eluted isocratically with TBS at a flow rate of 0.3 ml/min and 0.3- or 0.15-ml fractions were collected where necessary. All SE-AUC experiments were carried out using an Optima XL-A analytical ultracentrifuge (Beckman) equipped with absorbance optics and an An60Ti rotor. Protein samples were buffer exchanged into SE-AUC buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 50 mm NaCl, 7 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 0.02% NaN3) using either pre-packed Sephadex G-25 columns (NAP5, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) or by dialysis overnight. Three samples of 110 μl of protein at approximately 0.6, 0.3 and 0.15 mg/ml were analyzed, and the reference cells contained 125 μl of SE-AUC buffer. Experiments were performed at 4 °C at an optimized range of speeds between 4000 and 28,000 rpm. Equilibrium data were collected at 280 nm in step scan mode with a radial increment of 0.001 cm between data points. Five readings were averaged each scan, from which a base-line scan taken at 360 nm was subtracted in order to correct for optical imperfections. Readings were taken at 8-h intervals until no difference could be detected between consecutive scans. The equilibrium distributions from three different loading concentrations and up to three rotor speeds were analyzed both individually and simultaneously using the Nonlin curve-fitting algorithm supplied with the ultracentrifuge (Beckman). The procedure for measuring interactions between domains and peptides using the BIAcore biosensor (Biacore AB) has been previously described (26Panayotou G. Gish G. End P. Truong O. Gout I. Dhand R. Fry M.J. Hiles I. Pawson T. Waterfield M.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 3567-3576Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, biotinylated peptides were captured on immobilized avidin, and then sample was injected in running buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 3.4 mm EDTA, 4 mmDTT, 0.005% Tween 20), and the response at equilibrium was recorded. For competition experiments, the response at equilibrium was compared with that obtained upon preincubation of the protein or isolated domain solution with increasing amounts of free peptide. In order to calculate IC50 values, the results were plotted as resonance unitsversus peptide concentration, and the curve obtained was fitted with the equation R = (R max/1 + (C/IC50)P), where R is the response, R max is the response obtained in the absence of competitor, C is the concentration of competitor, and P is the Hill coefficient. Transfected Cos7 cells were lysed on ice in Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 50 mm NaCl, 50 mm NaF, 1 mm EDTA, 500 μm sodium orthovanadate, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mg/ml leupeptin, and 1 mm aprotinin), and cell debris and nuclei were removed by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. Immunoprecipitations from Cos7 cell lysates were performed for 2 h using p85α monoclonal antibodies (U9, U13, and U14 (27End P. Gout I. Fry M.J. Panayotou G. Dhand R. Yonezawa K. Kasuga M.

Precipitated proteins were analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), Western blotting onto polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Gelman Sciences), probing with an appropriate mouse monoclonal antibody, and detection of bound horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibody (Bio-Rad) using enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Protein in fractions from HP-SEC was precipitated using 10% trichloroacetic acid and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting as described above. Proteins were precipitated from Sf9 cell lysates using GST fusion proteins captured on glutathione-Sepharose CL 4B (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and analyzed for lipid kinase assay as described below. PI3K assays of glutathione-Sepharose CL 4B-precipitated proteins were carried out essentially as described previously (28Whitman M. Kaplan D.R. Schaffhausen B. Cantley L. Roberts T.M. Nature. 1985; 315: 239-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (544) Google Scholar). Lipid kinase assays contained 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm ATP, 20 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, and 200 μg/ml phosphatidylinositol. Extracted phospholipids were analyzed by thin layer chromatography in 65% 1-propanol, 0.7 m acetic acid, 50 mmphosphoric acid. It has previously been reported that both proline-rich motifs in p85α conform to the consensus ligand for the SH3 domain of p85α (29Rickles R.J. Botfield M.C. Weng Z. Taylor J.A. Green O.M. Brugge J.S. Zoller M.J. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5598-5604Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). In order to determine which of the two proline-rich motifs was the preferred ligand for the isolated p85α SH3 domain (p85αSH3), we compared its ability to bind to peptides derived from the sequences of the first (P1) or second (P2) proline-rich motifs of p85α, using an optical biosensor (Fig.1 A). Binding of p85αSH3 to immobilized P1 was observed in this system, producing a response of greater than 400 resonance units (Fig. 1 A), whereas little or no p85αSH3 injected at the same concentration bound to P2 (Fig.1 A), suggesting that P1 is the preferred ligand for p85αSH3. In contrast, wild type p85α, which contains the SH3 domain, did not bind immobilized P1 to a significant extent (Fig. 1 B). The small amount of binding observed was equivalent to that observed for binding of the same concentration of p85α to a surface on which P1 was not immobilized (data not shown). A mutant of p85α, in which two proline residues in PRM1 that have been shown to be important for p85α SH3 domain binding (30Yu H. Chen J.K. Feng S. Dalgarno D.C. Brauer A.W. Schreiber S.L. Cell. 1994; 76: 933-945Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (868) Google Scholar) were changed to alanine (p85αΔPRM1), was able to bind P1; however, a variant of p85α with mutations at the equivalent residues in PRM2 (p85αΔPRM2) was not. A variant of p85α in which both proline-rich motifs contained mutations (p85αΔPRM1:PRM2) bound to P1 to a similar extent as p85αΔPRM1 (Fig. 1 B). Mutations in PRM1 therefore allowed p85αSH3 to bind exogenous P1 peptide, whereas the SH3 domain in the context of wild type p85α could not bind to exogenous P1. Mutations in PRM2 did not affect binding to P1 peptide, confirming that the first proline-rich motif was the preferred ligand for the p85α SH3 domain. Thus, mutation of key residues in PRM1 of p85α not only affected this site but also the binding characteristics of the SH3 domain. These mutations increased the ability of the SH3 domain to bind exogenous ligands, indicating that in wild type p85α the SH3 domain interacts with PRM1 and that when this interaction is disrupted the SH3 domain is free to bind exogenous peptide. Similarly, deletion of the SH3 domain of p85α would be expected to free PRM1 and allow it to bind exogenous SH3 domains. When wild type p85α was co-expressed with the p110 catalytic subunit in Sf9 cells, a p85αSH3 GST fusion protein (GST-p85αSH3) immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose CL4B was poorly able to co-precipitate PI3K lipid kinase activity from Sf9 cell lysates. However, a monoclonal antibody directed against the SH2 domain of p85α was able to immunoprecipitate PI3K activity; thus both p85α and p110α were expressed in these cells. The same antibody was able to immunoprecipitate PI3K activity from lysates of Sf9 cells co-infected with p110α and a mutant of p85α in which the SH3 domain had been deleted (p85αΔSH3). Immobilized GST-p85αSH3 was able to co-precipitate the p110α-p85αΔSH3 complex to a much greater extent than the p110α-p85α complex (Fig. 1 C); thus deletion of the SH3 domain increased the ability of an exogenous SH3 domain to bind PRM1, confirming that the SH3 domain and PRM1 are bound to each other in both p85α and the p110α-p85α complex. Examination of purified, recombinant p85α and p85β by HP-SEC under native conditions showed that they had apparent molecular masses that were approximately double (162 ± 14 and 151 ± 12 kDa, respectively) that expected from their amino acid sequences (Fig.2, A and B). In contrast, the apparent molecular masses of the truncated p85α isoforms, p55γ and p49α (82 ± 4 kDa and 52 ± 2 kDa), were much closer to their predicted molecular masses (55 and 49 kDa; Fig. 2, A and B). There are several mechanisms by which a protein under native conditions can have an apparent molecular mass different from that predicted from its amino acid sequence. HP-SEC measures the hydrodynamic volume of a protein, which is defined as the spherical volume occupied by that protein as it tumbles rapidly in solution. Non-spherical proteins often elute with an abnormally high apparent molecular mass compared with the globular proteins used to calibrate the column. Proteins can also interact nonspecifically with the column matrix, impeding their progress through the column and resulting in a later elution time, leading to an underestimate of the molecular mass of a protein. High apparent molecular masses may also result from dimerization or oligomerization of the protein; thus we investigated whether the higher than expected molecular mass of p85α was due to dimerization by determining the molecular masses of p85α and p49α under different conditions. HP-SEC was carried out in buffers containing either 5 mmDTT or 8 m urea in order to determine whether the putative p85α dimeric interaction could be disrupted. The apparent molecular masses of p85α and p55γ were unaltered in the presence of 5 mm DTT (Fig. 2 B), suggesting that dimerization of p85α was not due to the presence of an intermolecular disulfide bond. In contrast, p85α had an apparent molecular mass of 89 ± 5 kDa in the presence of 8 m urea. High concentrations of urea disrupt non-covalent, but not covalent, bonds, indicating that p85α forms a dimer via a non-covalent interaction. The apparent molecular mass of p49α was relatively unaffected in the presence of 8m urea however (Fig. 2 B), suggesting that it is monomeric under native conditions. Sedimentation Equilibrium-Analytical Ultracentrifugation (SE-AUC) was employed to determine the apparent molecular masses of a number of p85α variants, as the equilibrium distribution of a solute in a gravitational field is dependent on the molecular mass of the solute, but independent of its shape, whereas HP-SEC is dependent on both mass and shape. Analysis of the equilibrium distribution of the concentration of protein with respect to radial position in the centrifuge demonstrated the occurrence of self-association in some samples. Self-association was defined as a lack of adherence to the Lamm equation, which describes the distribution of ideal, non-associating solute particles in a gravitational field. The occurrence of self-association manifests as a non-random distribution of residuals to the fit of the experimental (absorbanceversus radius) data to a derivative of the Lamm equation. The equilibrium distribution of p85α did not fit that of an ideal, non-associating solute, as the residuals were non-random (Fig.3 D). The apparent molecular mass of p85α was dependent on protein concentration and ranged between 80 and 110 kDa (Fig. 3 D), suggesting that p85α exists as an equilibrium of monomers and dimers under these conditions. In contrast, p49α was monomeric under the conditions examined. The residuals of the fit for an ideal, non-associating solute were distributed randomly around zero, and p49α had an apparent molecular mass of approximately 47 kDa (Fig. 3 C). Thus, p85α, which was apparently dimeric by HP-SEC, fitted a model for self-association, although the equilibrium dissociation constant for p85α dimer formation (estimated from the plot of apparent molecular massversus protein concentration; Fig. 3 D) was in the micromolar range, which is a lower affinity than that expected for a protein that was determined to be constitutively dimeric by HP-SEC. Given that p49α was shown to be monomeric using both techniques, this suggested that the dimerization of p85 was mediated by domains that are not present in p49α. The observation that p85α and p85β were dimeric under native conditions, but p55γ and p49α were not, suggested that the amino-terminal half of the higher molecular mass regulatory subunits was involved in intermolecular interactions that caused them to dimerize. Given that the SH3 domain and the first proline-rich motif reside in this region of the protein, and interact with each other (Fig. 1), we investigated whether this interaction was involved in the dimerization of p85α. Indeed, expression of the amino"

The QR-32 cell clone grows progressively after co-implantation with gelatin sponge in syngeneic C57BL/6 mice. The cell lines (QRsP) established from arising tumors after the co-implantation exhibited enhanced tumorigenicity and pulmonary metastasis in vivo as compared with parent QR-32 cells. The enhanced pulmonary metastasis of QRsP cells was correlated well with augmented production of matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) and increased expression of membrane-type 1-MMP (MT1-MMP). The QRsP cells also acquired higher chemokinetic activities to fibronectin and higher invasive activities through a reconstituted basement membrane. Furthermore we observed the elevated mRNA expression of E1AF in QRsP cells compared to parent QR-32 cells. Therefore, we transfected QR-32 cells with E1AF cDNA. Overexpression of E1AF in the QR-32 cells resulted in the induction of MT1-MMP expression and converting an exogenously added precursor MMP-2 into active form. E1AF transfectants exhibited more motile and invasive activities, and moderately increased pulmonary metastatic activities than parental QR-32 cells in vivo, although their metastatic activities were lower than those of QRsP cells. These findings suggest that the increased expression of E1AF in fibrosarcoma contributes to invasive phenotypes including MT1-MMP expression and enhanced cell migration, but not sufficient for exhibiting highly metastatic activity in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2319254625,"In breast cancer, loss of heterozygosity (LOH) has been described on the long arm of chromosome 7, at band q31, suggesting the presence of a tumor suppressor gene in this region. In this study, we have identified a second region of LOH on 7q, at band 7q22. Deletion of genetic material at 7q22 was found in all tumor types and grades and was associated with increased tumor size. The region of LOH at 7q22 in every case included one or more of three polymorphic markers that are located within the CUTL1 gene. LOH of 7q22 has also been documented in the case of human uterine leiomyomas (Zeng et al., 1997; Ishwad et al., 1997). Interestingly, in both leiomyomas and mammary tumors induced in transgenic mice expressing the Polyomavirus (PyV) large T (LT) antigen, immunocomplexes of CUTL1 and PyV LT antigen were detected (Webster et al., 1998). Altogether, genetic data in human breast cancer and biochemical analyses in breast tumors from transgenic mice suggest that CUTL1 is a candidate tumor suppressor gene."
https://openalex.org/W2012307677,"E2F is a heterodimeric transcription factor composed of one of five E2F subunits (E2F-1 to E2F-5) and a DP subunit. E2F regulates the expression of several growth-promoting genes, and thus, can be a target of antiproliferative action of interferons (IFNs). In this study, we investigated the mechanisms whereby IFN-alpha suppresses transcription of the E2F-1 gene. Transfection studies revealed that E2F-1 promoter was functionally divided into two parts: upstream activation sequences (UAS) and a downstream negative-regulatory element (E2F-binding sites). When cells were proliferating, transcription of the E2F-1 gene was primarily driven by the UAS, while E2F sites were not involved in activation. IFN-alpha markedly reduced E2F-1 promoter activity, but introduction of non-binding mutation at the E2F sites completely abrogated the inhibition. Free E2F4 was found to be the predominant species bound to the E2F sites in proliferating cells. IFN-alpha induced upregulation of E2F-4 along with dephosphorylation of pRB and p130, which resulted in the formation of E2F-4/pRB and E2F-4/p130 complexes on the E2F-1 promoter. These complexes function as transcriptional repressors to inhibit E2F-1 mRNA expression. Our findings indicate that E2F-4 is a critical regulator of E2F-1, which offer an excellent paradigm for understanding functional diversity within the E2F family."
https://openalex.org/W2332892439,"We investigated the intracellular mechanisms of retinoic acid (9-cis-RA, 13-cis-RA or all-trans-RA) and a cyclic AMP analog 8-Cl-cAMP on growth-inhibition and apoptosis in human ovarian cancer NIH: OVCAR-3 and OVCAR-8 cells. The cyclic AMP analog, 8-Cl-cAMP, acted synergistically with RA in inducing and activating retinoic acid receptor beta (RARbeta) which correlated with the growth inhibition, cell cycle arrest, and apoptosis in both cell types. In addition, combined treatment of cells with RA plus 8-Cl-cAMP resulted in the release of cytochrome c, loss in mitochondrial membrane potential and activation of caspase-3 followed by cleavage of anti-poly(ADP-ribose)polymerase and DNA-dependent protein kinase (catalytic subunit). Interestingly, inhibition of caspase-3 activation blocked RA plus 8-Cl-cAMP induced apoptosis. Furthermore, mutations in a CRE-related motif within the RARbeta promoter resulted in loss of both transcriptional activation of RARbeta and synergy between RA and 8-Cl-cAMP. Thus, RARbeta can mediate RA and/or cyclic AMP action in ovarian cancer cells by promoting apoptosis. Loss of RARbeta expression, therefore, may contribute to the tumorigenicity of human ovarian cancer cells. These findings suggest that RA and 8-Cl-cAMP act in a synergistic fashion in inducing apoptosis via caspase-3 activation, and may have potential for combination biotherapy for the treatment of malignant disease such as ovarian cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2329231189,"cdc2 gene expression is under the control of multiple factors. Although E2F/DP proteins have been reported to play a central role, they cannot account for all aspects of the fine modulation of cdc2 gene expression during cell cycle and embryonic development. To characterize the transcription factors that control cdc2 gene expression during nerve cell differentiation in avians, we have previously cloned the quail cdc2 gene promoter region. We had identified an octamer (CAGGTGGC) containing an E-box, which has important activity in regulating cdc2 transcription. Using in vivo genomic footprinting experiments, we show here that this motif, currently named IG, is the target of binding proteins at different stages of neuroretina development, confirming its importance as a regulatory response element for cdc2 gene expression. A subset of Helix-Loop-Helix family of transcription factors, known as Upstream Stimulatory Factors (USFs) specifically bind to this sequence as dimers. Moreover, our results indicate that USFs transactivate the promoter of cdc2 via the IG motif. These data may help to better understand the mechanisms that control cell division in differentiating nerve cells."

In analogy to cis-splicing,trans-splicing requires the participation of U snRNPs. Initial studies identified U2, U4, and U6 snRNAs in trypanosomes (3Mottram J. Perry K.L. Lizardi P.M. Lührmann R.

Cell. 1990; 61: 459-466Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Only recently, the trypanosome U5 homologue was identified (5Dungan J.D. Watkins K.P. Agabian N.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1986; 14: 8893-8903Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Another unique property of the trypanosomatid snRNAs is that they possess a divergent Sm site. In other eukaryotes, the Sm site constitutes the binding site for the common Sm proteins (8Branlant C. Krol A. Ebel J. Lazar E. Haendler B. Jacob M. Sri-Widada J. Jeanteur P. EMBO J. 1980; 1: 1259-1263Crossref Scopus (155) Google Scholar) that are recognized by anti-Sm antibodies present in autoimmune patients (9Lerner E.A. Lerner M.R. Janeway C.A.J. Steitz J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 2737-2741Crossref PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, so far, the trypanosome snRNPs represent the only exception in that they are not recognized by these antibodies, suggesting unique properties of the trypanosome core proteins (10Michaeli S.

Five core snRNP proteins were identified in Trypanosoma brucei ranging in size from 15 to 8.5 kDa, which are shared among all trans-spliceosomal snRNPs, including the SL, U2, U4/U6 (11Palfi Z. Günzl A. Cross M. Bindereif A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 9097-9101Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), and U5 RNP (12Lücke S. Klöckner T. Palfi Z. Boshart M. Bindereif A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4433-4440Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Recent studies in both mammalian and yeast systems have demonstrated that all the known Sm proteins possess homology in two regions that were termed Sm motifs 1 and 2 (13Hermann H. Fabrizio P. Raker V.A. Foulaki K. Hornig H. Brahms H. Lührmann R. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2076-2088Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar, 14Séraphin B.

The Sm motifs are also conserved in all putative homologues including plant and yeast (13Hermann H. Fabrizio P. Raker V.A. Foulaki K. Hornig H. Brahms H. Lührmann R.

EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2066-2075Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). This suggests that Sm proteins may have arisen from a single common ancestor. Recently, Sm-like proteins that do not belong to the canonical core proteins were also revealed, and one of them was identified as a U6-specific protein (14Séraphin B. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2089-2098Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). Very little is known about snRNP proteins in trypanosomes. The two trypanosome proteins that have been identified so far are the U2-specific 40 kDa, the human homologue of U2A′ (16Cross M. Wieland B. Palfi Z. Günzl A. Röthlisberger U. Lahm H.-W. Bindereif A. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 1239-1248Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) and the U5-specific PRP8/p220 homologue (12Lücke S. Klöckner T. Palfi Z. Boshart M. Bindereif A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4433-4440Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Interestingly, not all the amino acid positions critical for PRP8 function are conserved in the trypanosome protein p277, suggesting that certain differences exist between PRP8 functions in cis- and trans-splicing (12Lücke S. Klöckner T. Palfi Z. Boshart M. Bindereif A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4433-4440Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). In this study, we have purified the SL RNP particle from the trypanosomatid Leptomonas collosoma using a combination of conventional chromatography and affinity selection with biotinylated 2′-O-methyl (2′-OMe) antisense RNA oligonucleotide, resulting in the identification of a subset of core proteins and loosely bound proteins that were selected with the SL RNA. The L. collosoma proteins show immunological relationship to the T. brucei core proteins. Based on internal peptide sequences, one of the core proteins was cloned and sequenced; the analysis identified it as a bona fide Sm protein harboring the conserved Sm motifs 1 and 2, mostly related to the SmE protein. In sum, although snRNP proteins are not recognized by anti-Sm sera in trypanosomes and the Sm site is degenerate, trypanosomes do possess Sm proteins. L. collosoma cell culture and extract preparation (using 0.3 or 0.4 m KCl) has been previously described (17Goldring A. Karchi M. Michaeli S. Exp.

J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 10582-10588Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Extracts were prepared from 10 liters of cell cultures (5 × 107 cells/ml). The extract was fractionated on a DEAE-Sephacel column, and the material eluted at 0.4 m KCl was concentrated to 0.5–1 ml by chromatography on a 0.2-ml DEAE column. Affinity selection was performed (11Palfi Z. Günzl A. Cross M. Bindereif A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

All nucleotides in the SL-1 are 2′-O-methylated except X, which is biotinylated 2′-deoxythymidine. For U2 snRNP selections, U2–1 oligonucleotide 5′-UXXXXUAGCCGAGAAGAUAU-3′, complementary to nucleotides 1–15 ofT. brucei U2 RNA, was used (11Palfi Z. Günzl A. Cross M. Bindereif A. Proc. Natl. Acad.

The selected proteins were sliced from the gel, digested with LysC, and subjected to automatic protein sequencing (Technion, Institute of Technology, Haifa, Israel). RNA was released from the streptavidin-agarose beads as described previously (11Palfi Z. Günzl A. Cross M. Bindereif A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The primers used were: 1) 9825, 5′-GCCCGAAAGCTCGGTC-3′, complementary to nucleotides 80–95 of theL. collosoma SL RNA; 2) 24279, 5′-TTCATRAATCRTCXTANCC-3′ antisense to the Sm1 peptide IEGNLLGYDEFMNVVL; 3) 24280, 5′-GGNTAXGAYGAX-TTYATGAA-3′, sense to Sm1 motif; and 4) 24281, 5′-ACNACXCCNACXTTRTC-3′, antisense to Sm2 peptide sequence ILLRSXDNVGVVVAI. X denotes inosine, N is a mixture of all four nucleotides, R denotes purines, and Y denotes pyrimidines. 500 ng of degenerate oligonucleotides 24279, 24280, and 24281 were labeled each with 250 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (7000 Ci/mmol) and polynucleotide kinase. Each labeled oligonucleotide (108 Cerenkov counts) was used to screen a λ genomic library (50,000 plaques) of L. collosoma (17Goldring A. Karchi M. Michaeli S. Exp. Parasitol. 1995; 80: 333-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 19Goldring A. Michaeli S. Gene. 1995; 156: 139-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Two plaques gave positive signals with all three probes. Pure λ DNA was digested with HpaII andAluI, and DNA fragments of 0.6 and 1.6 kilobases were cloned into pBluescript SK and sequenced, using T3 and T7 primers. RNPs from the different purification steps were separated on a 5% nondenaturing gel buffered with 50 mmTris-glycine, pH 8.8. Previously, using affinity selection with biotinylated RNA oligonucleotide, the SL RNP of T. brucei was purified and a subset of five low molecular mass proteins of 15 to 8.5 kDa was identified. Only a single protein of 14.4 kDa appeared to be specific to SL RNP, whereas other proteins are shared with U2 and U4/U6 RNPs (11Palfi Z. Günzl A. Cross M. Bindereif A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 9097-9101Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Because of the experimental advantage of performing biochemical analysis with the monogenetic trypanosomatids, we have set up the purification of the SL RNP from L. collosoma extracts. Purification steps were scaled-up such that microgram amounts of proteins sufficient for microsequencing could be prepared. SL RNP was purified from high-salt extract because only under these conditions was it possible to recover about 80% of the particles. The SL RNP was highly enriched by two purification steps: depletion of the ribosomes and fractionation on a DEAE-Sephacel column. RNA was extracted from the different purification steps. Results presented in Fig.1 A, lanes 1–3, demonstrate that this fractionation procedure efficiently enriches for the major snRNAs, U2, U4, SL, and U6, but that other small RNAs such as 7SL RNA and tRNAs were still present in these fractions. To investigate the status of the SL RNP during purification, we analyzed the RNPs by native gel electrophoresis and Northern hybridization. The results presented in Fig. 1 B indicate that in the initial steps of purification, the SL RNP migrated as a slow form (lane 2) and was converted to a fast migrating form during fractionation on a DEAE column (lane 3). Fractionation of the DEAE eluate by CsCl gradient centrifugation suggests that these particles withstand fractionation in high salt gradients and band at a density of ∼1.4 g/ml, characteristic of core SL RNP particles (10Michaeli S. Roberts T.G. Watkins K.P. Agabian N. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 10582-10588Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Cross M. Günzl A. Palfi Z. Bindereif A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 5516-5526Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) (data not shown). It is currently unknown whether, during the conversion from the slowly to the fast migrating form of the SL RNP, only particle-specific proteins are dislodged or whether the SL RNP dissociates from a multi-snRNP complex. We have previously demonstrated that, when RNPs extracted at low ionic strength are fractionated on sucrose gradients, at least 50% of the SL RNP migrates at S values higher than 11 S (core SL RNP), suggesting that the SL RNP associates with other spliceosomal components (6Xu Y.-X. Ben-Shlomo H. Michaeli S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 8473-8478Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Affinity selection of the SL RNP and U2 RNP from the DEAE eluate demonstrates its high specificity and efficiency because, in both selections, a single RNA band of the expected size was observed (Fig. 1 A, lanes 4 and 5). To analyze the protein composition of the SL RNP, a concentrated DEAE column fraction prepared from 1011 cells was used in affinity selection with biotinylated antisense SL-1 RNA oligonucleotide. Proteins were analyzed on a 12% Tris-Tricine gel and stained with Coomassie Blue. Results presented in Fig.2 A show the enrichment of five proteins of 70, 15, 13, 12, and 8 kDa (lanes 1,2, 3, and 4). The proteins of ∼55 kDa are the most abundant proteins in the DEAE fraction (lanes 4 and 5) and most likely represent α and β tubulins. These proteins were nonspecifically selected because they were present in the control selection without the SL oligonucleotide (lane 5). The pattern of the selected small proteins of theL. collosoma SL RNP seems to differ only slightly from the pattern of the proteins selected in T. brucei. In addition, the L. collosoma SL RNP contains a protein of 70 kDa. Because this SL RNP purification was done at 0.4 m KCl, we will refer to this RNP as the core SL RNP. To investigate whether purification under less stringent conditions reveals additional SL RNP associated proteins, particles were extracted at 0.2 m KCl and were purified by DEAE chromatography. The selected proteins were stained with Coomassie Blue (Fig.2 B). The results indicate the presence of proteins of 28, 20, and 18 kDa in addition to the four low molecular mass proteins characteristic of the core SL RNP. However, the 18-kDa protein was bound nonspecifically to the beads as this protein was present also in the control selection in the absence of oligonucleotide (Fig.2 B, lane 5). The 70-kDa protein enriched in the core SL RNP (Fig. 2 A, lane 4), was not clearly seen under low salt conditions (Fig. 2 B, lane 4), most probably because of the nonspecific staining at the upper part of the gel. The results presented in Fig. 2 demonstrate the specificity of selection under high salt conditions but also the disadvantage of loosing additional, weakly associated proteins. To examine the relatedness of the core proteins, we used the antibodies raised against the T. brucei core proteins (anti-CP) in immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting experiments withL. collosoma DEAE fraction. The results presented in Fig.3 A demonstrate that anti-CP antibodies specifically immunoprecipitated the SL RNP because only very faint background levels of the SL RNA were observed when the nonimmune serum was used in the experiment (compare lanes 1 and2). To identify which of the L. collosoma SL RNP proteins are related to the T. brucei proteins, affinity-selected L. collosoma proteins were immunoblotted and reacted with anti-CP antiserum alongside to T. brucei affinity-selected proteins from SL and U2 RNPs. The result indicates strong reactivity with the 12-kDa protein. The anti-CP antibodies show the strongest reactivity with the T. brucei14- and 12.5-kDa proteins (21Palfi Z. Bindereif A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20159-20163Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) migrating close to the immunoreactive proteins of the L. collosoma SL RNP (Fig. 3 B,lanes 2 and 3). In a control experiment with nonimmune serum, no reactivity was observed with the L. collosoma proteins (data not shown). The reactivity with the 12-kDa protein indicates that the snRNP core proteins from L. collosoma and T. brucei are immunologically related. To clone the genes coding for core SL RNP proteins, the low molecular mass proteins were eluted from the gel and digested with LysC protease. Several internal peptide sequences were obtained from the four core proteins. In particular, two long peptides (peptide 1, IEGNLLGYDEFMNVVL; and peptide 2, ILLRSDNVGVVHAI) could be determined from the 12-kDa protein. Using degenerate oligonucleotides as probes, a genomic fragment of 1220 base pairs was cloned and sequenced (Fig.4). An open reading frame was identified coding for a 11.9-kDa protein of 94 amino acids. The spliced leader addition site (AG 3′ splice site) was mapped 16 nucleotides upstream of the first ATG (data not shown), and 22 consecutive pyrimidines were found upstream (Fig. 4, underlined in the sequence). These pyrimidines resemble the polypyrimidine tract found in intergenic regions of trypanosomatid genes that was shown to be essential for accurate trans-splicing (22Matthews K.R. Tschudi C. Ullu E. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 491-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). The polyadenylation site was mapped by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction and is located 417 nucleotides downstream of the stop codon (results not shown). Southern analysis indicated that the gene is present in a single copy in the L. collosoma genome (data not shown). A multiple alignment of the L. collosoma protein with its homologues is presented in Fig. 5. TheL. collosoma protein is 27% identical and 64% similar to the human SmE protein. Interestingly, the protein possesses the bipartite Sm motif that carries two conserved domains Sm1 and Sm2underlined in Fig. 5 (boundaries according to the nomenclature of Hermann et al. (13Hermann H. Fabrizio P. Raker V.A. Foulaki K. Hornig H. Brahms H. Lührmann R. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2076-2088Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar): Sm motif 1, 32 amino acids; Sm motif 2, 14 amino acids). The Sm motifs are the most conserved domains in SmE protein (∼45% identity). Among the few deviations in the Sm motifs of the L. collosoma protein from its homologues is position 7 of the Sm2 motif (Arg instead of Lys in most of the other species). This is especially interesting because Arg is conserved in all Sm2 motifs, but in all E proteins this Arg was changed to Lys, except for the L. collosoma protein where the canonical Arg is kept. Recently, functional analysis was performed on the yeast SmE protein (23Bordonné R. Tarassov I. Gene (Amst.). 1996; 176: 111-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 24Camasses A. Bragado-Nilsson E. Martin R. Séraphin B. Bordonné R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1956-1966Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The results pointed out the importance of certain hydrophobic residues for cell viability; these positions are essential for interactions of the protein with SmF and SmG (24Camasses A. Bragado-Nilsson E. Martin R. Séraphin B. Bordonné R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1956-1966Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Interestingly, of these seven important residues, all but one are either similar or identical in L. collosoma, suggesting that their function may be conserved in the trypanosome protein.Figure 5Alignment of the SmE homologues.

This finding is even more surprising after revealing the presence of Sm motifs in theL. collosoma protein. It was previously suggested that important domains for Sm autoimmunization are the conserved Sm motifs (13Hermann H. Fabrizio P. Raker V.A. Foulaki K. Hornig H. Brahms H. Lührmann R. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2076-2088Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). This current study suggests that not only are the Sm motifs involved in B-cells epitope recognition. Alternatively, the trypanosome Sm motifs may differ from the canonical motifs in those positions that are essential for recognition by the anti-Sm sera. The number of the core proteins described in this study is smaller than that observed inT. brucei (11Palfi Z. Günzl A. Cross M. Bindereif A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 9097-9101Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Either the L. collosoma SL RNP composition is less complex than that of T. brucei, or more than a single polypeptide migrates at the same position of the protein gel. The latter possibility is more likely, based on the differential staining intensity of the protein bands (Fig. 2, A andB). Cloning of the entire subset of the L. collosoma Sm proteins should clarify this issue. Core proteins assembled on the Sm site of snRNAs were shown to serve as the recognition signal for the m3G cap methyltransferase (25Mattaj I.W. Cell. 1986; 46: 905-911Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). Similarly, it was shown that accurate modification of the SL RNA cap structure in vitro requires the SL RNA to be assembled in a core particle (26Ullu E. Tschudi C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20365-20369Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The degeneracy of the Sm site in trypanosomes may reflect that each U snRNA, including the SL RNA, binds different subsets of core proteins. Indeed, the presence of unique proteins in the low molecular mass range has been observed for the SL and U4/U6 snRNPs (11Palfi Z. Günzl A. Cross M. Bindereif A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 9097-9101Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). This suggests that the different combinations of Sm proteins determined by the different Sm sites and surrounding sequences may influence the binding of the different methyltransferases and hence dictate the particular type of cap modification on the trypanosome snRNA. We thank Ora Asher for excellent technical assistance and Dr. Christian Tschudi for advice in library screening with degenerate oligonucleotides."

Subsequently, 15 molecular species of phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) with sn-1 C20-saturated and sn-2 C20-unsaturated acyl chains were semi-synthesized by acylation of C20-lysophosphatidylcholine with unsaturated C20 fatty acids followed by phospholipase D-catalyzed base-exchange reaction in the presence of excess ethanolamine. The gel-to-liquid crystalline phase transitions of these 15 mixed-chain PE, in excess H2O, were investigated by high resolution differential scanning calorimetry. In addition, the energy-minimized structures of these sn-1 C20-saturated/sn-2 C20-unsaturated PE were simulated by molecular mechanics calculations. It is shown that the successive introduction of cis double bonds into thesn-2 acyl chain of C(20):C(20)PE can affect the gel-to-liquid crystalline phase transition temperature,T m, of the lipid bilayer in some characteristic ways; moreover, the effect depends critically on the position ofcis double bonds in the sn-2 acyl chain. Specifically, we have constructed a novel T mdiagram for the 15 species of unsaturated PE, from which the effects of the number and the position of cis double bonds onT m can be examined simultaneously in a simple, direct, and unifying manner.

Most naturally occurring diacyl phospholipids in eukaryotic cell membranes are of a mixed acyl chain variety, meaning that the fatty acids esterified at the sn-1 and sn-2 positions of the glycerol backbone are originated primarily in vivofrom saturated and unsaturated fatty acyl-CoA, respectively. Since the chemical composition of fatty acids can vary greatly in terms of the acyl chain length, the degree of unsaturation, and the position ofcis carbon-carbon double bonds (Δ-bonds), 1The abbreviations used are: Δ-bonds, cis carbon-carbon double bonds; PC, phosphatidylcholine; PE, phosphatidylethanolamine; C(20):C(20)PE, saturated PE with 20 carbons in the sn-1 and 20 carbons in the sn-2 acyl chains; C(20):C(20:1Δn)PE, monounsaturated PE with a saturated sn-1 C20-acyl chain and a monounsaturated sn-2 C20-acyl chain with acis carbon-carbon double bond at the nth carbon atom from the carbonyl end (Δn); C(20):C(20:2Δn,n+3)PE, PE with a saturatedsn-1 C20-acyl chain and a dienoicsn-2 C20-acyl chain in which two methylene-interrupted Δ-bonds are at the n and (n + 3) carbon atoms from the carbonyl end; C(20):C(20:3Δn, n+3, n+6)PE, C(20):C(20:4Δn, n+3,n+6,n+9)PE, and C(20):C(20:5Δn, n+3,n+6,n+9,n+12)PE, 3, 4, and 5, respectively, methylene-interrupted Δ-bonds in thesn-2 C20-acyl chains; DSC, differential scanning calorimetry; MM, molecular mechanics; T m, phase transition temperature; ΔT 12, transition peak width at half-maximal height; ATS, all-trans segmentmembrane phospholipids are structurally an extremely diverse group of amphipathic molecules. In a given type of cell, membrane phospholipids may amount to several hundreds of distinctive chemical species. Despite the bewildering diversity, the basic motif of most unsaturated fatty acyl chains is surprisingly simple, viz. in thesn-2 acyl chain, the cis carbon-carbon double bonds are invariably separated by a three-carbon unit comprised of a methylene group (–CH2-) sandwiched by two olefinic carbons. The biochemical significance of this regular methylene-interrupted interval is, however, not clear. Although it has long been known that mixed-chain diacyl phospholipids in aqueous media can uniquely assemble into a two-dimensional sheet-like structure called the lipid bilayer, progress is nonetheless slow in understanding how variations in the chemical composition of fatty acyl chains affect the structure/property relationship of the lipid bilayer. This is, in part, due to the fact that up to the present time not a single x-ray crystal structure of mixed-chain phospholipid is available. A second reason is that many diacyl mixed-chain phospholipids containing single or multiple cis double bonds are rather difficult to synthesize (or semi-synthesize) in a typical biochemical or biophysical laboratory. Nevertheless, the pioneer work of Keough and co-workers (1Keough K.M.W. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1990; 18: 835-837Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 2Coolbear K.P. Berde C.B. Keough K.M.W.

Acta. 1987; 902: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) did provide interesting results showing how variations in the number of cis double bonds in thesn-2 acyl chain of phosphatidylcholine (PC) at certain fixed positions can affect the phase transition temperature (T m) of the lipid bilayer. Specifically, Keough and associates (1Keough K.M.W. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1990; 18: 835-837Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 2Coolbear K.P. Berde C.B. Keough K.M.W. Biochemistry. 1983; 22: 1466-1473Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 3Keough K.M.W. Griffin B. Kariel N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 902: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) have shown by DSC that the introduction of acis double bond into the sn-2 acyl chain of C(20):C(20)PC at carbon 11 from the carbonyl end, or C(11), gives rise to C(20):C(20:1Δ11)PC, which has a considerably lowerT m relative to its saturated counterpart. The introduction of a second cis double bond into thesn-2 acyl chain at the methylene-interrupted position toward the methyl end yields C(20):C(20:2Δ11,14)PC with a further reduction in T m. Interestingly, the introduction of a third cis double bond at C(17) results in a small increase in T m for C(20):C(20:3Δ11,14,17)PC. This down and up trend inT m has been confirmed calorimetrically by other groups (4Niebylski C.D. Salem Jr., N. Biophys. J. 1994; 67: 2387-2393Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 5Sanchez-Migallon M.P. Aranda F.J. Gomez-Fernandez J.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1279: 251-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). One can immediately raise a relevant question as to whether this down and up T m profile is a special or a general characteristic for acyl chain unsaturation. Phrased differently, what kind of T m profile will be observed if the first Δ-bond is introduced at C(5) or C(17) in the sn-2 acyl chain followed by successive incorporations of Δ-bonds at regular methylene-interrupted intervals, proceeding toward the methyl or carbonyl end? One may further ask an even more important question: do we know how to interpret the observed T m profile in terms of molecular structures of unsaturated phospholipids? In order to find answers to these fundamental questions, phospholipids with Δ-bond(s) at different positions along the sn-2 acyl chain need to be synthesized first, and the synthesized lipids should then be subjected to DSC studies. Furthermore, the structures of unsaturated lipids in the bilayer at T < T mhave to be estimated. Recently, we have semi-synthesized a limited number of diacyl mixed-chain phosphatidylethanolamines (PE) with sn-1 C20-saturated and sn-2 C20-unsaturated acyl chains (6Wang Z. Lin H. Li S. Huang C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23491-223499Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7Huang C. Li S. Lin H.-N. Wang G. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 334: 135-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 8Huang C. Lin H. Li S. Wang G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21917-21926Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 9Li S. Wang G. Lin H. Huang C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19009-19018Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Our calorimetric data showed that the T m profile exhibited by a series of mixed-chain PE containing 1–3 cis Δ-bonds in thesn-2 C20-acyl chains at Δ11-, Δ11,14-, and Δ11,14,17-positions, respectively, is parallel to that displayed by the corresponding mixed-chain PC observed earlier by Keough et al. (8Huang C. Lin H. Li S. Wang G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21917-21926Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The influence of single and multiple Δ-bonds on the chain-melting behavior of PC and PE bilayers thus appears very similar. If we can delineate the common structural features governing the shapes ofT m profiles for various series of mixed-chain PE, the information obtained may provide an understanding of the structure/property relationships underlying most other naturally occurring phospholipids. With this in mind, in the present study we have extended the list of synthesized mixed-chain PEs containingsn-1 C20-saturated and sn-2 C20-unsaturated acyl chains to a total of 15 different species. The phase transition behavior of these mixed-chain PE, in excess H2O, has also been investigated by high resolution DSC. Based on the calorimetric data, a novel T mdiagram is generated for the first time. In this diagram,T m values of 9 series of mixed-chain PE each containing three or more lipids are systematically arranged. The shapes of T m profiles displayed by various lipids in all nine series can be seen simultaneously in plots derived from theT m diagram. Furthermore, in this study we have used the computer-based molecular mechanics (MM) calculations to simulate the energy-minimum structures of these mixed-chain PEs. The characteristic T m profile obtained with lipids in each series of mixed-chain PE can be interpreted in terms of structural changes of the sn-2 acyl chain of the lipid resulting from acyl chain unsaturation. With the exception of six species of unsaturated C20 fatty acids that were synthesized in this laboratory as described in the next paragraph, all other C20-unsaturated fatty acids including arachidonic acid were obtained from Sigma. Lysophosphatidylcholine with a C20-acyl chain was purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids (Alabaster, AL). Phospholipase D, type I from cabbage, was obtained from Sigma. Chemicals used for the fatty acid synthesis were supplied by Aldrich. All routine reagents and organic solvents were of reagent and spectroscopic grades, respectively, and they were obtained from various commercial sources. In the present investigation, six species of C20-unsaturated fatty acids were synthesized; they were cis-14-eicosenoic,cis-17-eicosenoic, cis,cis-5,8-eicosadienoic,cis,cis-8,11-eicosadienoic,cis,cis-14,17-eicosadienoic, and all-cis-8,11,14,17-eicosatetraenoic acids. For monoenoic acids, the synthesis was carried out based on the method of Holman and co-workers (10Christie W.W. Holman R.T. Chem. Phys. Lipids. 1967; 1: 407-423Crossref Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 11Valicenti A.J. Pusch F.J. Holman R.T. Lipids. 1985; 20: 234-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). By using the synthesis ofcis-14-eicosenoic acid as an example, this method can be briefly described as follows: the starting material is 1-bromoundecan-11-ol. After the hydroxyl group has been protected by 3,4-dihydro-2H-pyran, the primary alkyl derivative can interact with heptyne-1 in the presence of butyl lithium to yield ω-hydroxyl alkyne. Upon further reacting with CH2(CO2Et)2 in the presence of EtONa, the chain elongation step gives a product of appropriate total number of carbons, viz. the eicosa-14-ynoic acid. Finally, the triple bond of this C20-alkynoic acid iscis-hydrogenated using Lindlar catalyst to formcis-14-eicosenoic acid. The syntheses of various dienoic C20 fatty acids were accomplished by the established procedure published recently from this laboratory (9Li S. Wang G. Lin H. Huang C. J. Biol.

(12Osbond J.M. Philpott P.G. Wickens J.C. J. Chem. Soc. 1961; : 2779-2787Crossref Scopus (97) Google Scholar) was employed, in which 1-bromoundeca-2,5,8-triyne and 8-nonyoic acid were coupled to form 8,11,14,17-eicosatetraynoic acid followed bycis-hydrogenation to form the final product of all-cis-tetraenoic acid. The purity of the synthesized mono- and dienoic acids was estimated by high pressure liquid chromatography. Mixed-chain sn-1 C20-saturated/sn-2 C20-unsaturated PE was semi-synthesized from the corresponding PC by the base-exchange reaction in the presence of excessive amounts of ethanolamine hydrochloride, at pH 5.6, using phospholipase D according to the method of Comfurius and Zwaal (14Comfurius P. Zwaal R.F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1977; 488: 36-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar) as described in detail elsewhere (6Wang Z. Lin H. Li S. Huang C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23491-223499Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Huang C. Lin H. Li S. Wang G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21917-21926Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The semi-synthesis of mixed-chain PC involved the acylation of C(20)-lysophosphatidylcholine with C20 fatty acid in the presence of catalyst 4-pyrrolidinopyridine using the established procedure reported previously (15Lin H. Wang Z. Huang C. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 7063-7072Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). In semi-synthesizing mixed-chain PE, all chemical and enzymatic reactions were carried out strictly under N2 to avoid possible lipid oxidation. All lipids were purified by column chromatography on silica gel 60, with which a mixture of CHCl3, CH3OH, 5% NH4OH, 175:35:4 (v/v/v) was used as the eluant. Only a single spot was observed for each of the PE synthesized, after about 1 μmol per sample was loaded on the thin layer plate and developed in CHCl3, CH3OH, 5% NH4OH (65:30:5). Prior to use, the lipid powder obtained from lyophilization of the lipid/benzene solution was kept at −20 °C. The lipid samples used for DSC experiments were prepared according to our previously reported protocols (13Batta A.K. Dayal B. Shefer S. Salen G. J. Chromatogr. 1984; : 260-284Google Scholar). Specifically, the lyophilized lipid power was dispersed in cold aqueous buffer solution containing 50 mm NaCl, 0.25 mm diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid, 5 mmphosphate buffer, pH 7.4, and 0.02 mg/ml NaN3. All DSC experiments were performed on a MicroCal MC-2 calorimeter with a DA-2 digital interface and data acquisition utility for automatic collection (Microcal, Northampton, MA). In these DSC runs, a constant heating scan rate of 15 °C/h was used; lipid samples were scanned a minimum of three times with at least 60–90 min of equilibration at low temperatures between scans. As in our previous studies (6Wang Z. Lin H. Li S. Huang C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23491-223499Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7Huang C. Li S. Lin H.-N. Wang G. Arch. Biochem.

Lin H. Huang C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19009-19018Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar), the phase transition temperature and the transition enthalpy were obtained from the second DSC heating curve. Specifically, the gel-to-liquid crystalline phase transition temperature, T m, corresponds to the peak position with maximal peak height, and the transition enthalpy, ΔH, can be determined from the area under the transition peak and the lipid concentration using the software provided by Microcal. In general, the T mvalue obtained at the transition with maximal peak height from the second DSC heating run was reproduced at ± 0.1 °C for each lipid sample. The ΔH value, however, has a considerable higher error owing to the uncertainty in deciding the onset and completion temperatures of the transition curve. The relative errors may amount to 20% for very broad transition curves as exhibited by some polyunsaturated lipids. All molecular mechanics (MM) force field calculations were carried out using an IBM RS/6000 computer workstation. The software MM3 (version 92) for MM calculations was supplied by Quantum Chemistry Program Exchange, Chemistry Department, Indiana University, Bloomington, IN. The MM3 computation began with the input of the estimated atomic coordinates for mixed-chain PE followed by systematic adjustment of the structural parameters by repeated automatic cycles of the Newton-Raphson minimization technique (16Allinger N.L. Yuh Y.H. Lii J.-H. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1989; 111: 8551-8582Crossref Scopus (2925) Google Scholar). These cycles of self-adjusted computation came to a halt as the steric energy reached the minimum. The structural data resulting from the MM3 computation were stored. Subsequently, these data were transferred into a Pentium P5–200 platform equipped with HyperChem 4.0 software (HyperCube, Gainesville, FL), from which the three-dimensional graphic images of the energy-minimized lipid molecules can be visualized. Details of the procedure for obtaining the energy-minimized structure for each sn-1 saturated/sn-2 unsaturated phospholipid were described previously (17Li S. Lin H. Wang Z.-Q. Huang C. Biophys. J. 1994; 66: 2005-2018Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 18Li S. Huang C. J. Comp. Chem. 1996; 17: 1013-1024Crossref Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 19Wang G. Li S. Lin H. Huang C. Biophys. J. 1997; 73: 283-292Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). It should be mentioned, however, that prior to stochastic search for the energy-minimized conformation ofsn-1 saturated/sn-2 unsaturated PE, the atomic coordinates (e.g. torsion angles) of the initially crude structure for a given mixed-chain PE were estimated based on the single crystal structure of C(12):C(12)PE (20Hitchcock P.B. Mason R. Thomas K.M. Shipley G.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1974; 71: 3036-3040Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar) and the energy-minimized unsaturated fatty acyl chain (18Li S. Huang C. J. Comp. Chem. 1996; 17: 1013-1024Crossref Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Any additional methylene-interruptedcis double bonds for the sn-2 acyl chain were constructed by usings −Δs + s +Δs −(ors +Δs − s −Δs +) as the added sequence (18Li S. Huang C. J. Comp. Chem. 1996; 17: 1013-1024Crossref Scopus (10) Google Scholar), where s ± refers toskew (±) conformations with torsion angles of about ± 110o and Δ denotes cis double bond with torsion angle of about 0o. These initial coordinates of the crude structural model were used as a set of initial input data in MM3 computations. Fig.1 shows the second DSC heating curves for aqueous dispersions prepared individually from a saturated identical chain C(20):C(20)PE and its five unsaturated ω3 derivatives. These unsaturated ω3PEs contain various numbers of ciscarbon-carbon double bonds in the sn-2 acyl chain of the lipid, with the position of the commonly shared double bond being 3 carbons from the methyl end (the ω3-position) or 17 carbons from the carbonyl end (the Δ17-position). The aqueous dispersion of C(20):C(20)PE is characterized by a single, sharp endothermic transition peaked at 82.5 °C; this peak temperature corresponds to the gel-to-liquid crystalline (or chain-melting) phase transition temperature, T m, as reported previously (21Huang C. Wang Z.-Q. Lin H.-N. Brumbaugh E.E. Li S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1189: 7-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). After the first cis carbon-carbon double bond is introduced into the sn-2 acyl chain of C(20):C(20)PE at the ω3 (or Δ17)-position, the resulting C (20Hitchcock P.B. Mason R. Thomas K.M. Shipley G.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1974; 71: 3036-3040Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar):C(20:1Δ17)PE also displays a single, sharp endothermic transition; however, its T m decreases by 15.7 °C, relative to its saturated counterpart, from 82.5 to 66.8 °C (Fig. 1). This single endothermic transition can also be attributed to the gel-to-liquid crystalline phase transition. Furthermore, as a cis double bond is introduced successively at a regular methylene-interrupted interval toward the carbonyl end, various polyunsaturated PEs with increasing numbers of double bonds are formed. These polyunsaturated PEs, in excess water, display calorimetrically broad gel-to-liquid crystalline phase transitions each with a characteristic T m (Fig. 1). Interestingly, in the plot of T m versus the number of double bonds as illustrated in the inset of Fig. 1, theT m value is observed to decrease nonlinearly with a stepwise increase in the number of cis carbon-carbon double bonds in the sn-2 acyl chain. In particular, theT m increment is diminished substantially between C(20):C(20:3Δ11,14,17)PE and C(20):C(20:5Δ5,8,11,14,17)PE. This nonlinear decrease inT m reflects that the successive increase in the degree of acyl chain unsaturation has a nonadditiveT m lowering effect. Nevertheless, all experimentalT m values fit reasonably well by a least squares binomial curve with a correlation coefficient of 0.9836 (theinset of Fig. 1). Values of T m, ΔH, and other thermodynamic parameters associated with the gel-to-liquid crystalline (or chain-melting) phase transition for all five species of unsaturated ω3 derivatives of C(20):C(20)PE are summarized in Table I.Table IThe thermodynamic parameters associated with the chain-melting phase transitions of C(20):C(20)PE and its unsaturated ω3 and ω6 derivativesLipidT mΔHΔSΔT 1/2°Ckcal/molcal/mol · K°CC(20):C(20)PE82.512.535.20.6The ω3PE seriesC(20):C(20:1Δ17)PE66.88.825.91.0C(20):C(20:2Δ14,17)PE45.75.216.30.9C(20):C(20:3Δ11,14,17)PE23.36.020.22.2C(20):C(20:4Δ8,11,14,17)PE16.45.719.62.4C(20):C(20:5Δ5,8,11,14,17)PE3.55.720.63.9The ω6PE seriesC(20):C(20:1Δ14)PE47.78.225.60.9C(20):C(20:2Δ11,14)PE22.44.515.22.4C(20):C(20:3Δ8,11,14)PE15.65.519.11.6C(20):C(20:4Δ5,8,11,14)PE6.65.218.63.1 Open table in a new tab In Fig. 2, the second DSC heating curves for aqueous dispersions prepared from four unsaturated ω6PEs and their common parent compound, C(20):C(20)PE, are illustrated. It is evident that all these DSC curves display single endothermic transitions each with a distinct T m value. Moreover, a nonlinearly decreased T m curve in the plot ofT m versus the number of ciscarbon-carbon double bonds is observed (the inset of Fig.2). In particular, the lipid species with an sn-2 arachidonyl (or all-cis-5,8,11,14-eicosatetraenoyl) chain has the smallest T m value of 6.6 °C. It should be mentioned that the phase transition behavior of C(20):C(20)PE and some of its ω6-unsaturated derivatives has been reported recently from this laboratory (8Huang C. Lin H. Li S. Wang G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21917-21926Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). However, the recently reported DSC thermograms were incomplete; for instance, the one displayed by the aqueous dispersion of C(20):C(20:1Δ14)PE was missing. In contrast, Fig. 2 comprises all DSC thermograms for PEs withsn-1 C20-saturated/sn-2 C20-ω6-unsaturated acyl chains. In Table I, the values ofT m, ΔH, and other thermodynamic parameters associated with the phase transition of C(20):C(20)PE and its four ω6-unsaturated derivatives are summarized. As described under “Experimental Procedures,” the monounsaturated C(20):C(20:1Δ14)PE was semi-synthesized by acylation of C(20)-lyso-PC with cis-14-eicosenoic acid followed by base-exchange reaction in the presence of excessive ethanolamine. Furthermore, the monoenoic ω6 fatty acid (cis-14-eicosenoic acid) was also synthesized in this laboratory. The single and symmetric endothermic transition withT m = 47.4 °C and ΔT 12 = 0.9 °C exhibited by the C(20):C(20:1Δ14)PE dispersion as seen in Fig. 2 can be taken as strong evidence indicating that the monounsaturated ω6PE and the monoenoic ω6 fatty acid synthesized in this laboratory have high degrees of isomeric and chemical purities. Furthermore, the single phase transition at 16.4 °C exhibited by the aqueous dispersion of C(20):C(20:4Δ8,11,14,17)PE is seen in Fig. 1 to be symmetrical with a ΔT 12 of 2.4 °C, reflecting again the high degree of purity of our synthesized all-cis-8,11,14,17-eicosatetraenoic acid as well as the synthesized C(20):C(20:4Δ8,11,14,17)PE. In recent years, the phase transition behavior of six lipid species of C(20):C(20)PE derivatives with ω9, ω12, and ω15 fatty acids esterified at the sn-2 position of the glycerol backbone has been characterized by high resolution DSC in this laboratory (6Wang Z. Lin H. Li S. Huang C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23491-223499Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7Huang C. Li S. Lin H.-N. Wang G. Arch. Biochem.

When the T m values from these six PEs and those obtained with ω3 and ω6 PEs shown in Figs. 1 and 2are codified, a general T m diagram forsn-1 C20-saturated/sn-2 C20-unsaturated PE can be generated for the first time (Fig. 3). Specifically, theT m diagram shown in Fig. 3 has the shape of a right-angled triangle, comprising 15 species of sn-1 C20-saturated/sn-2 C20-unsaturated PE. These lipids are arranged into 5 levels depending on the position of the ω-carbon, where the ω-carbon is defined as the first olefinic carbon atom in the lipid's sn-2 acyl chain when counting from the methyl end of the chain. The five parallel levels of unsaturated lipids are layered from top to bottom according to the following order: ω15PE, ω12PE, ω9PE, ω6PE, and ω3PE. Furthermore, the unique T m value of any givensn-1 C20-saturated/sn-2 C20-unsaturated PE is shown under the abbreviated name of the given lipid species in Fig. 3. Vertically, each column in theT m diagram also represents a series of unsaturated PEs, which share a common Δn-bond. Hence, each series is designated as the ΔnPE series, where the superscriptn denotes the position of the common ciscarbon-carbon double bond (Δ-bond) in the sn-2 acyl chain when counting from the carbonyl end. In this case, the carbonyl carbon is designated as the first carbon, or C(1), of the acyl chain. Next, we shall see that with this T mdiagram, the effects of acyl chain mono- and polyunsaturation on the chain-melting behavior of lipid bilayers can be examined directly in a unifying manner. For lipid species aligned horizontally along each row in theT m diagram (Fig. 3), the added ciscarbon-carbon double bond is introduced at a regular methylene-interrupted interval, proceeding toward the carbonyl end of the sn-2 acyl chain. In addition, this T mdiagram shows another common feature exhibited by each series of the ω(3–12)PE as follows. The T m decreases continuously but nonlinearly with a stepwise increase in the number ofcis double bonds. Consequently, we can arrive at a general conclusion that the gel-to-liquid crystalline phase transition behavior of PE bilayers is influenced markedly in a systematic way by the number of cis carbon-carbon double bonds present in thesn-2 acyl chain of the PE. The lipid species aligned vertically along each column in theT m diagram also show a growing number ofcis double bonds in the sn-2 acyl chain of the lipid (Fig. 3). However, the methylene-interrupted cisdouble bond is added on the methyl side of the existing double bond. Interestingly, the T m values exhibited by the Δ8-PE series of C(20):C(20:1Δ8)PE, C(20):C(20:2Δ8,11)PE, C(20):C(20:3Δ8,11,14)PE, and C(20):C(20:4Δ8,11,14,17)PE and the Δ11-PE series of C(20):C(20:1Δ11PE, C(20):C(20:2Δ11,14)PE, and C(20):C(20:3Δ11,14,17)PE show down and up trends, which can be viewed as an exception of the continuously downward trend of T m normally observed with most lipid series that contain a"

Although each vWf subunit displays a high affinity binding site for factor VIII in vitro, in plasma, only 2% of the vWf sites for factor VIII are occupied. We investigated whether interaction of plasma proteins with vWf or adhesion of vWf to collagen may alter the affinity or availability of factor VIII-binding sites on vWf. When vWf was immobilized on agarose-linked monoclonal antibody, factor VIII bound to vWf with high affinity, and neither the affinity nor binding site availability was influenced by the presence of 50% plasma. Therefore, plasma proteins do not alter the affinity or availability of factor VIII-binding sites. In contrast, when vWf was immobilized on agarose-linked collagen, its affinity for factor VIII was reduced 4-fold, with K D increasing from 0.9 to 3.8 nm. However, one factor VIII-binding site remained available on each vWf subunit. A comparable reduction in affinity for factor VIII was observed when vWf was a constituent of the subendothelial cell matrix and when it was bound to purified type VI collagen. In parallel with the decreased affinity for factor VIII, collagen-bound vWf displayed a 6-fold lower affinity for monoclonal antibody W5–6A, with an epitope composed of residues 78–96 within the factor VIII-binding motif of vWf. We conclude that collagen induces a conformational change within the factor VIII-binding motif of vWf that lowers the affinity for factor VIII. von Willebrand factor (vWf) is a multimeric adhesive glycoprotein that serves as a carrier for factor VIII in plasma.

Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1990; 6: 217-246Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As a carrier for factor VIII, plasma vWf functions to prevent factor VIII from binding to phosphatidylserine-containing membranes, where it may be degraded by anticoagulant proteases such as activated protein C (2Lajmanovich A. Hudry-Clergeon G. Freyssinet J. Marguerie G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1981; 678: 132-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 3Gilbert G.E. Drinkwater D. Barter S. Clouse S.B. J. Biol.

As an adhesive protein, plasma vWf forms the primary link between exposed extravascular collagen at a site of vascular rupture and platelets, which are sequestered from flowing blood by collagen-bound vWf (5Sakariassen K. Bolhuis P. Sixma J. Nature. 1979; 279: 636-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar, 6Houdijk W. Sakariassen K. Nievelstein P. Sixma J. J. Clin. Invest. 1985; 75: 531-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). vWf secreted from the basolateral surface of endothelial cells also functions as an adhesive protein. When the vascular matrix is exposed to flowing blood, the vWf-bound to type VI collagen supports adhesion of platelets and development of a thrombus (7Rand J.H. Glanville R.W. Wu X.X. Ross J.M. Zangari M. Gordon R.E. Schwartz E. Potter B.J. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1997; 78: 445-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Factor VIII is released from vWf following proteolytic activation by thrombin (8Lollar P. Hill-Eubanks D. Parker C. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 10451-10455Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and is then free to bind to phosphatidylserine-containing membranes, where it may assemble with the serine protease, factor IXa, to form an efficient procoagulant enzyme complex (9van Dieijen G.

Thus, we were motivated to determine the consequences that may occur when circulating vWf with bound factor VIII binds to collagen at a site of vascular injury. vWf, which is synthesized in both endothelial cells and megakaryocytes (1Wagner D.D. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1990; 6: 217-246Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10Sadler J.E. J. Biol.

The primary amino acid sequence of the mature subunit entails homologous domains arranged in the order D′-D3-A1-A2-A3-D4-C1-C2 (13Verweij C.L. Diergaarde P.J. Hart M. Pannekoek H.

The subunits are linked by C-terminal disulfide bonds prior to transport from the endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi apparatus (16Wagner D.D. Marder V.J. J.

Within the Golgi apparatus, the dimers are assembled into high molecular mass multimers under the influence of a large propeptide (18Verweij C.L. Hart M. Pannekoek H.

Each vWf subunit contains a factor VIII-binding motif with functional residues clustered in the D′ domain (20Foster P. Fulcher C. Marti T. Titani K. Zimmerman T.S. J. Biol.

J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10822-10827Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). The D domains of vWf are remarkable for a high cysteine content (10Sadler J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 22777-22780Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), with the vast majority of these residues forming intradomain disulfide bonds. We have recently observed that formation of the intersubunit disulfide bonds between D3 domains of dimers, linking them to form multimers, increases the affinity of vWf subunits for factor VIII 6-fold (23Bendetowicz A.V. Morris J.A. Wise R.J. Gilbert G.E. Kaufman R.J. Blood. 1998; 92: 529-538Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This suggests that high affinity factor VIII-binding sites reside on the internal subunits of vWf multimers rather than on the two terminating subunits and that the D′ domain is subject to conformational change despite its eight-intradomain disulfide bond restraints (17Marti T.

It functions as cofactor for factor IXa in the highly efficient factor X-activating enzyme complex (9van Dieijen G. Tans G. Rosing J. Hemker H. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 3433-3442Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Within this complex, factor VIII binds both to a platelet-binding site (24Nesheim M.E. Pittman D.D. Wang J.H. Slonosky D.

Chem. 1992; 267: 17006-17011Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The enzymatic product of this complex, activated factor X, activates prothrombin to thrombin (27Mann K.G. Nesheim M.E. Church W.R. Haley P. Krishnaswamy S. Blood. 1990; 76: 1-16Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Hemophilia, an X-linked bleeding disorder in which factor VIII or IX levels are decreased in plasma, illustrates the importance of factor VIII for normal hemostasis. Because von Willebrand factor protects factor VIII in plasma, factor VIII levels are decreased in patients with reduced or absent circulating vWf and in patients with mutant vWf with impaired factor VIII binding (28Mazurier C. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1992; 67: 391-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). In plasma, vWf multimers carry only one factor VIII molecule/50 vWf subunits. Binding studies conducted in vitro have yielded conflicting data for the number of available factor VIII-binding sites on plasma vWf multimers. A recent investigation from this laboratory (23Bendetowicz A.V. Morris J.A. Wise R.J. Gilbert G.E. Kaufman R.J. Blood. 1998; 92: 529-538Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) demonstrated a 1:1 stoichiometry of binding sites/vWf subunit, which is in agreement with the data of Lollar and Parker (29Lollar P. Parker C.

Blood. 1995; 85: 3150-3157Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, other studies reported different factor VIII/vWf ratios, such as 1:4, 1:10, 1:50, and 1:70 (30Vlot A.J.

Several investigators reported that factor VIII forms a high affinity complex with vWf, with dissociation constants range from 0.2 to 0.94 nm (30Vlot A.J. Koppelman S.J. van den Berg M.H. Bouma B.N.

A study by Leyte et al. (33Leyte A. Verbeet M. Brodniewicz-Proba T. van Mourik J. Mertens K. Biochem. J. 1989; 257: 679-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) suggested that the high affinity interaction is restricted to 1–2% of the available sites. We were motivated to determine whether any proteins in plasma reduce the affinity or availability of factor VIII-binding sites on vWf multimers, possibly explaining the discrepancies. In vitro, plasma vWf does not bind to its platelet receptor, glycoprotein Ib, in the absence of nonphysiologic cofactors such as ristocetin. However, after vWf binds to collagen or is adsorbed to a plastic surface, platelets bind to the immobilized vWf via the platelet glycoprotein Ib-IX receptor (6Houdijk W. Sakariassen K. Nievelstein P. Sixma J. J. Clin. Invest. 1985; 75: 531-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). The altered affinity of vWf for platelet glycoprotein Ib-IX is presumed due to a collagen-induced conformational change. We hypothesized that the apparent reduction in factor VIII-binding sites on vWf bound to microtiter wells may reflect a conformational change, induced by binding to collagen, that affects the affinity for factor VIII as well as for platelet glycoprotein Ib-IX. Fluorescein-5-maleimide, fluorescein isothiocyanate, and Alexa-conjugated streptavidin were purchased from Molecular Probes, Inc. (Eugene, OR). 20-μm polystyrene microspheres (density = 1.05 g/liters) were from Duke Scientific Corp. (Palo Alto, CA). Optiprep (1.3 g/liter) was from Life Technologies, Inc. Bovine serum albumin (BSA), benzamidine, ε-aminocaproic acid, and Histopaque (1.077 g/liter) were purchased from Sigma. 34-μm Superose 12 microspheres were purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Cryoprecipitate was obtained from the American Red Cross. Recombinant factor VIII, anti-factor VIII monoclonal antibody F8, and anti-vWf antibodies 13.7.9 and 16.9.2 were generously provided by D. Pittman (Genetics Institute Inc., Cambridge, MA). mAb W5–6A was a kind gift of Dr. D. N. Fass. Calf skin collagen was from Worthington. Heparin was from Becton and Dickinson. vWf was purified from cryoprecipitate and quantified with an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay as described previously (23Bendetowicz A.V. Morris J.A. Wise R.J. Gilbert G.E. Kaufman R.J. Blood. 1998; 92: 529-538Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recombinant vWf lacking the propeptide, therefore present only as C-terminal dimers, was expressed and purified as described previously (19Wise R.J. Pittman D.D. Handin R.I. Kaufman R.J. Orkin S.H. Cell. 1988; 52: 229-236Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Recombinant human factor VIII was labeled with fluorescein-5-maleimide as described previously (3Gilbert G.E. Drinkwater D. Barter S. Clouse S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15861-15868Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Anti-von Willebrand factor monoclonal antibody 16.9.2 was labeled with fluorescein isothiocyanate as described (23Bendetowicz A.V. Morris J.A. Wise R.J. Gilbert G.E. Kaufman R.J. Blood. 1998; 92: 529-538Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Anti-vWf mAb 13.7.9 was linked to cyanogen bromide-activated Superose 12 microspheres as described previously (23Bendetowicz A.V. Morris J.A. Wise R.J. Gilbert G.E. Kaufman R.J. Blood. 1998; 92: 529-538Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For calf skin collagen immobilization, cross-linked agarose microspheres 34 μm in diameter (Superose 12; 500 μl) were equilibrated with 1 mCO3Na2/HNaCO3 buffer, pH 11. CNBr (500 μg) dissolved in 500 μl of acetonitrile was added to the microspheres and incubated for 10 min on an ice bath while swirling. If necessary, 4 n NaOH was added to the mixture to maintain the pH between 10.5 and 11. The microspheres were extensively washed with distilled H2O and 100 mmcarbonate/bicarbonate buffer, pH 9.2. Subsequently, they were washed with cold 0.1 m sodium citrate, pH 6.5. The slurry of activated microspheres was added to a tube containing 12 ml of calf skin collagen (1–1.5 mg/ml) diluted in 0.1 m sodium citrate and incubated at 4 °C for 48–72 h on an inverting mixer. The microspheres were then washed with cold 0.1 m sodium citrate, pH 6.5. Nonspecific active sites were blocked by incubating the coated microspheres with 10 volumes of 100 mm Tris, pH 8, for 4 h to overnight at 4 °C with gentle mixing. Microspheres were kept at 4 °C until used, but no longer than 10 days. The microspheres were counted using a Coulter ZM counter. Collagen deposition was confirmed by indirect immunofluorescence microscopy; 10 μl of microspheres were incubated with anti-type I collagen mAb (Sigma) in a final volume of 500 μl on a inverting mixer. After 15 min of incubation at room temperature, the microspheres were washed with Trizma (Tris base)-buffered saline (TBS; 150 mm NaCl and 20 mm Trizma, pH 7.8), and the fluorescein-labeled anti-mouse antibody (Dako Corp.) was added and allowed to incubate for 15 min. Control microspheres were gelatin-coated microspheres (Sigma) and CNBr-activated, uncoated Superose 12 microspheres. Collagen-positive microspheres had a distinctive, bright fluorescent rim as seen by fluorescence microscopy, whereas this property was not observed either on the gelatin microspheres or on the uncoated ones. Calf skin collagen was adsorbed to 20-μm diameter polystyrene microspheres after extensive washing to remove surfactant. Microspheres (1 ml) were sedimented at 3000 rpm × 1 min using a tabletop microcentrifuge. The pellet was washed with H2O (1 ml), and the procedure was repeated six times. The microspheres were resuspended and incubated with 1 ml of 600 μg/ml collagen, pH 6.5, in 50 mm Tris and 150 mm NaCl overnight at 4 °C while rocking. Unbound collagen was removed by washing once with 10 volumes of TBS. Nonspecific sites were blocked with whole milk following a 1-h incubation at room temperature. Microspheres were counted with a Coulter ZM counter. They were flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen and kept at −80 °C until used. Type VI collagen purified from human placenta (80 μg/ml) was dialyzed into 0.5 mNa2CO3/NaHCO3 with the pH adjusted to 9.5. 1 ml of CNBr-activated Superose 12 microspheres was added to a 1-ml suspension of type VI collagen, and the reaction was allowed to proceed for 16 h at 4 °C with gentle rocking. Unreacted active sites were blocked with 0.1 m ε-aminocaproic acid, pH 7. Deposition of type VI collagen was confirmed by staining with mAb VI-I, a secondary biotinylated goat anti-mouse polyclonal antibody, followed by staining with Alexa-conjugated streptavidin with fluorescence detection of microspheres containing and lacking type VI collagen by flow cytometry. For factor VIII binding experiments, nonspecific binding of factor VIII to type VI collagen was reduced by incubating the microspheres with skim milk for 60 min at room temperature, followed by washing with TBS. Endothelial cell-conditioned microspheres were prepared as follows. Following activation with CNBr as described above, Superose microspheres were incubated with 2% (w/v) gelatin in 50 mmNa2HPO4, pH 7.8, for 16 h at 4 °C. Gelatin-coated microspheres were stored in 20% ethanol at 4 °C to minimize the likelihood of microbial contamination. Prior to incubation with human umbilical vein endothelial cells, prepared by standard techniques, microspheres were washed twice with endothelial cell growth medium. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells were grown to confluence on 100-mm gelatin-coated tissue culture dishes. Cells from one dish (∼2 × 106 cells) were removed by trypsin treatment, sedimented by gentle centrifugation, and resuspended in 5 ml of growth medium. The resuspended cells were combined with a 1-ml suspension of ∼2.5 × 106 gelatin-conjugated Superose 12 microspheres in endothelial cell growth medium and placed on a 100-mm bacteriological Petri dish on a rocker at 37 °C. Following 3 days of growth, the microspheres were harvested and washed by centrifugal sedimentation with Hanks' buffered saline. The endothelial cells were removed by treatment with 0.1 m NH4OH as described previously (36Baruch D. Denis C. Marteaux C. Schoevaert D. Coulombel L. Meyer D. Blood. 1991; 77: 519-527Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, microspheres were resuspended in 5 ml of 0.1 m NH4OH, incubated for 15 min at room temperature, sedimented, and resuspended in 0.1 mNH4OH for 15 min. Microspheres were then washed three times with Hanks' buffered saline and finally resuspended in TBS. The conditioned microspheres were stored at 4 °C. All experiments were performed within 2 weeks of endothelial cell stripping. Binding of fluorescein-labeled factor VIII to vWf immobilized on mAb 13.7.9 or collagen-Superose 12 was measured as described previously (23Bendetowicz A.V. Morris J.A. Wise R.J. Gilbert G.E. Kaufman R.J. Blood. 1998; 92: 529-538Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The same assay was employed to detect binding of fluorescein-labeled mAb W5–6A to vWf. Factor VIII binding to collagen-bound vWf on polystyrene microspheres was conducted as following. vWf (6.6 μg) was incubated with 3 × 106 collagen-coated polystyrene microspheres in a final volume of 720 μl in TBS containing 0.01% Tween 80 and BSA (TBST-BSA) for 45 min at room temperature while shaking in a Vortex mixer. Free vWf was separated from collagen-bound vWf on microspheres by sedimentation onto a density gradient. vWf/collagen-coated microspheres were layered onto 5.5 ml of TBST-BSA/Histopaque (1.015 g/liter) over a sublayer of 1 ml of TBST-BSA/Optiprep (1.221 g/liter). The preparation was centrifuged for 30 min at 400 × gbefore removal of microspheres from the interface between the two density layers. Microspheres were washed with 1 ml of TBST-BSA, and aliquots containing 30,000 microspheres were incubated with increasing concentrations of fluorescein-labeled factor VIII or mAb 16.9.2, as described above. After 15 min, vWf-bound fluorescein-labeled factor VIII or fluorescein-labeled mAb 13.7.9 was measured by flow cytometry as described previously (23Bendetowicz A.V. Morris J.A. Wise R.J. Gilbert G.E. Kaufman R.J. Blood. 1998; 92: 529-538Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). vWf (117 ng) was immobilized onto 200,000 mAb- or collagen-coated Superose 12 microspheres by incubating for 45 min at room temperature with continuous mixing on a Vortex mixer. The association of fluorescein-labeled factor VIII with vWf was monitored after the addition of either 1 or 10 nmfluorescein-labeled factor VIII to suspended vWf-coated mAb 13.7.9-Superose microspheres or 5 or 10 nmfluorescein-labeled factor VIII to vWf-coated collagen-Superose microspheres. At timed intervals, 50-μl aliquots were diluted to 500 μl, and bound factor VIII was measured immediately using flow cytometry. The average elapsed time between sample dilution and completion of data acquisition was ∼20 s. For dissociation experiments, 10 nm fluorescein-labeled factor VIII was allowed to equilibrate for 15 min with vWf bound to collagen-Superose or mAb 13.7.9-Superose. The dissociation of factor VIII from bound vWf was measured following the addition of 100 nm unlabeled factor VIII. At timed intervals, 50-μl aliquots were taken, and the fluorescence/microsphere was monitored as described above. Control experiments were performed to measure fluorescence due to nonspecific binding of fluorescein-labeled factor VIII to microspheres lacking vWf. This background fluorescence, ∼20% of total fluorescence at 1 nm factor VIII and 50% of total fluorescence at 16 nm factor VIII, was subtracted from the total fluorescence to obtain the specific fluorescence. The figures display specific fluorescence, and Table I reports values derived from specific fluorescence. Equilibrium binding data were analyzed using the equation F = F 0 +F max(VIIIf/(VIIIf +K D)), where F is the measured fluorescence/Superose bead, F 0 is the fluorescence/Superose bead in the absence of fluorescein-labeled factor VIII, F max is the maximum fluorescence with saturating concentrations of factor VIII, K D is the dissociation constant for factor VIII binding to vWf, and VIIIf is the molar concentration of fluorescein-labeled factor VIII. We assumed that the fraction of total factor VIII bound could be neglected (the nominal concentration of factor VIII-binding sites was 0.1 nm, assuming one binding site/vWf subunit). The variables K D and F maxwere determined using nonlinear least-squares analysis with FitAll Version 4.0 software (MTR Software, Toronto). The stoichiometry between factor VIII-binding sites and vWf subunits was determined using fluorescein-labeled mAb 13.7.9 as described under “Results.”Table IMeasured parameters for the binding of factor VIII to vWf on collagen versus anti-vWf monoclonal antibodyvWf attachment (matrix)Factor VIII sites/vWf subunitK Dk onk offnmnm−1min−1min−1mAb 13.7.9 (Superose 12)1.0 ± 0.2 (2)0.94 ± 0.27 (7)0.074 ± 0.043 (2)0.071 ± 0.039 (3)Type I–III collagensSuperose 121.0 ± 0.3 (3)3.7 ± 1.6 (3)0.052 ± 0.031 (3)0.77 ± 0.66 (3)Polystyrene1.0 ± 0.6 (3)4.8 ± 2.1 (4)NDaND, not determined.NDSubendothelial matrix (Superose 12)1bThe ratio of factor VIII-binding sites to mAb 16.9.2 epitopes was 3.5 for vWf in the subendothelial matrix, suggesting that access to the mAb 16.9.2 epitope was impaired by matrix proteins.

Open table in a new tab Kinetic association data were fitted according to first-order binding kinetics using nonlinear least-squares software (FitAll Version 4.0), assuming that the concentration of free fluorescein-labeled factor VIII did not change significantly in the course of the reaction (see above). Kinetic dissociation data were fitted according to exponential decay with a non-zero plateau using FitAll Version 4.0. Purified suspended vWf displays one high affinity binding site for factor VIII on each vWf subunit; yet in plasma, only 1–2% of these sites are actually occupied by factor VIII. We asked whether plasma contains protein(s) that inhibit binding of factor VIII to some fraction of vWf subunits. To address this question, we evaluated binding of factor VIII to immobilized vWf in the presence and absence of plasma. Purified vWf was immobilized on the non-inhibitory mAb 13.7.9 linked to 34-μm diameter cross-linked agarose microspheres (Superose). We have recently shown that vWf immobilized in this way displays one high affinity binding site/subunit, equivalent to suspended vWf (23Bendetowicz A.V. Morris J.A. Wise R.J. Gilbert G.E. Kaufman R.J. Blood. 1998; 92: 529-538Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Varying concentrations of fluorescein-labeled factor VIII were incubated with vWf microspheres and either buffer or a vWf-deficient plasma/buffer mixture at a 1:1 ratio. Fluorescein-labeled factor VIII bound saturably and with high affinity to immobilized vWf in the presence or absence of plasma (Fig. 1). The equivalent shapes and plateaus of the two binding isotherms indicated that plasma does not contain proteins that substantially inhibit binding of factor VIII to vWf. We hypothesized that vWf has decreased affinity for factor VIII when bound to collagen. To test this hypothesis, calf skin collagen was adsorbed to 20-μm diameter polystyrene microspheres, and the microspheres were incubated with suspended vWf. Saturable binding of vWf to collagen was detected by flow cytometry with fluorescein-labeled mAb 13.7.9. Half-maximal binding occurred at a vWf concentration of 1 μg/ml. We performed kinetic association and dissociation experiments to determine whether collagen-bound vWf would remain stably bound over the time period necessary for factor VIII binding. The results indicated that ∼40% of the bound material dissociated over 20 min, but that following the initial dissociation, at least 80% of bound vWf remained stably bound for >2 h. Thus, all equilibrium and kinetic factor VIII binding experiments were initiated at least 20 min after washing free vWf from the microspheres and completed within 2 h. Increasing concentrations of fluorescein-labeled factor VIII were added to the vWf/collagen-coated microspheres, and binding of factor VIII was measured by flow c"

Removal rates of NMPs varied dramatically (>20-fold) at different sites along three selected fragments encompassing a total length of 1775 base pairs. Repair of NMPs was not coupled to transcription, because the transcribed strands of HIS3 and induced GAL1:URA3 were not repaired faster than the nontranscribed strands. However, the repair rate of NMPs was significantly affected by the nearest neighbor nucleotides. Slow repair occurred at NMPs between purines, especially guanines, whereas fast repair occurred at NMPs between pyrimidines. NMPs between a purine and pyrimidine were repaired at moderate rates. Moreover, a rough correlation between nucleosome positions and repair rates exists in some but not all regions that were analyzed.

Moreover, a rough correlation between nucleosome positions and repair rates exists in some but not all regions that were analyzed. Subtle alterations in DNA molecules, such as oxidized or alkylated bases, are repaired by the base excision repair (BER) 1The abbreviations used are: BER, base excision repair; bp, base pair(s); DMS, dimethyl sulfate; NMP, N-methylpurine; NER, nucleotide excision repair; TS, transcribed strand; NTS, nontranscribed strandpathway (reviewed in Refs. 1Seeberg E.

There are two families of alkylated base DNA glycosylases (3Lau A.Y. Scharer O.D. Samson L. Verdine G.L. Ellenberger T.

Although their primary sequences and three-dimensional structures are unrelated, they may have common themes in recognition of alkylated bases and catalysis of glycosylic bond cleavage (3Lau A.Y.

The “flipping out” may occur in a later step during recognition and/or incision of damaged bases (6Mullen G.P. Wilson S.H. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 4713-4717Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Alkylation damage to DNA occurs frequently in nature and can be introduced either by alkylating agents present in the environment or by erroneous alkylation induced by the natural methyl donorS-adenosyl-methione (7Rydberg B. Lindahl T. EMBO J. 1982; 1: 211-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). Simple methylating agents such as dimethyl sulfate (DMS) produce a variety of damaged bases in DNA of which N-methylpurines (N 7-methylguanine andN 3-methyladenine) or NMPs constitute approximately 90% of the alterations (8Pieper R.O. Nickoloff J.A. Hoekstra M.F. DNA Damage and Repair: DNA Repair in Higher Eukaryotes. 2. Humana Press, Totowa, NJ1998: 33-49Google Scholar). In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the repair of NMPs occurs mainly through the BER pathway, although nucleotide excision repair (NER) may play a role if the BER pathway is abolished (9Xiao W. Chow B.L. Curr. Genet. 1998; 33: 92-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Initiation of this pathway inS. cerevisiae is by the action of the small (34 kDa) proteinMAG DNA glycosylase (10Chen J.

O'Connor T.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 284: 269-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). These studies raise several questions about BER in intact cells. As a damaged base is flipped out by a DNA glycosylase during BER, do neighboring nucleotides affect the rate of BER? Is there a coupling between transcription and BER of NMPs in yeast? Futhermore, as modulation of NER by chromatin structure has been well established (18Smerdon M.J. Thoma F. Nickoloff J.A. Hoekstra M.F. DNA Damage and Repair: DNA Repair in Higher Eukaryotes. 2. Humana Press, Totowa, NJ1998: 199-222Google Scholar), does nucleosome positioning also modulate BER? To address these questions, we studied BER of NMPs in a minichromosome in intact yeast cells. Strain RGY1 was made by transforming strain Y452 (MATα ura3-52 his3-1 leu2-3 leu2-112 cir°) with plasmid YRpSO1 (see Fig. 1). This plasmid was constructed and characterized by Drs. Stephano Omari and Fritz Thoma at the Swiss Federal Research Institute (ETH-Hönggerberg) in Zürich, Switzerland (19.Omari, S., Chromatin Structure during Transcription in the Yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae.Ph. D. Thesis, 1990, Swiss Federal Institute of Technology, Zurich, Switzerland.Google Scholar). RGY1 cells were grown at 30 °C in minimal medium containing 2% glucose or 2% galactose to late log phase (A 600 ∼ 1.0). The cultures were mixed with DMS to give a final concentration of 0.05% (v/v). After 5 min of incubation at room temperature, the cells were washed twice with either ice-cold 2% glucose or 2% galactose and resuspended in the same solutions containing 100 mmhydroxyurea to prevent DNA replication during repair incubation (20Abanobi S.E. Columbano A. Mulivor R.A. Rajalakshmi S. Sarma D.S.R. Biochemistry. 1980; 19: 1382-1387Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). One-tenth volume of a solution containing 10% yeast extract and 20% peptone was added to the DMS-treated cultures. After 0, 1, 2, and 4 h of repair incubation at 30 °C, an aliquot was removed, and plasmid DNA was isolated as described previously (21Smerdon M.J. Thoma F. Cell. 1990; 61: 675-684Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). A biotinylated oligonucleotide and streptavidin magnetic bead-facilitated end-labeling technique was used (22Li S. Waters R. Carcinogenesis. 1996; 17: 1549-1552Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 23Li S. Waters R. Smerdon M.J. Methods Companion Methods Enzymol. 1999; (in press)Google Scholar). Briefly, isolated plasmid DNA was cut with restriction enzyme(s) to release the three fragments that were analyzed. DdeI and StyI were used to release the 678-bp GAL1-URA3 fragment,StuI was used to release the 717-bp URA3-3′ fragment, and BstNI and BstXI were used to release the 659-bp HIS3 fragment (see Fig. 1). The restricted DNA was cleaved at NMP sites by incubation in 1m piperidine at 90 °C for 30 min (24Maxam A.M. Gilbert W. Methods Enzymol. 1980; 65: 499-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (9015) Google Scholar). One strand of the cleaved fragments was annealed to biotinylated oligonucleotides (sequences available upon request). The annealed fragments were attached to streptavidin magnetic beads (Dynal, Inc) and labeled using [α-32P]dATP (NEN Life Science Products) and Sequenase™ (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The labeled fragments were eluted, resolved on sequencing gels, and exposed to PhosphorImager screens (Molecular Dynamics). The band intensities in the gels were quantified using ImagQuaNT (Molecular Dynamics) and PeakFit 4.0 (SPSS, Inc.) deconvolution software as described (23Li S. Waters R. Smerdon M.J. Methods Companion Methods Enzymol. 1999; (in press)Google Scholar). Sequence markers were generated from polymerase chain reaction fragments, as described previously (22Li S. Waters R. Carcinogenesis. 1996; 17: 1549-1552Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 23Li S. Waters R. Smerdon M.J. Methods Companion Methods Enzymol. 1999; (in press)Google Scholar). YRpSO1 is a high copy number (∼50 copies/cell), autonomously replicating yeast plasmid 4263 bp in length (Fig. 1). It contains (a) the ARS1 orgin of replication, flanked by the 3′ end of the TRP1 gene (Fig. 1, open arrowhead) and the upstream region of the GAL3 gene (Fig. 1, nearnucleosome 9), (b) a galactose-inducibleGAL1:URA3 fusion gene, (c) a constitutively expressed HIS3 gene, and (d) the 5′ ends of thePET56 and DED1 genes of yeast (19.Omari, S., Chromatin Structure during Transcription in the Yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae.Ph. D. Thesis, 1990, Swiss Federal Institute of Technology, Zurich, Switzerland.Google Scholar). Moreover, a sequence of unknown function (UNF) lies downstream of theDED1 fragment. Twenty-two nucleosomes (Fig. 1, small numbered circles) are distributed in four regions, interrupted by four nuclease-sensitive gaps (19.Omari, S., Chromatin Structure during Transcription in the Yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae.Ph. D. Thesis, 1990, Swiss Federal Institute of Technology, Zurich, Switzerland.Google Scholar). 2F. Thoma, unpublished results. Following galactose induction, four nucleosomes (Fig. 1, nucleosomes 19–22) in the UNF-GAL10 region are destabilized or rearranged. Upon galactose induction, the level of GAL1:URA3 RNA increases dramatically (>150-fold) from essentially zero in glucose medium (25Smerdon M.J. Gupta R. Murad A.O. Bohr V.A. Wassermann K. Kraemer K.H. DNA Repair Mechanisms, Alfred Benzon Symposium 35. Munksgaard, Copenhagen, Denmark1993: 258-270Google Scholar). However, except for the regions mentioned above, no change in nucleosome structure is observed in the minichromosome (including theGAL1:URA3 fusion gene) in galactose cultures (19.Omari, S., Chromatin Structure during Transcription in the Yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae.Ph. D. Thesis, 1990, Swiss Federal Institute of Technology, Zurich, Switzerland.Google Scholar), indicating that only a few of the fusion genes are transcriptionally active at any one time. 3S. Li, R. Gupta, M. Meijer, M. Livingstone-Zatchej, F. Thoma, and M. J. Smerdon, submitted for publication. This fact presumably reflects insufficient GAL4p for binding to theUASg of the GAL1–10 promoter contained in the multicopy plasmid. Three fragments of YRpSO1 (GAL1-URA3(DdeI-StyI), URA3-3′ (StuI), and HIS3(BstNI-BstXI)) were chosen for analysis based on their proximity to the GAL1:URA3 and HIS3 genes (Fig. 1). Representative gels showing the incidence and repair of NMPs are shown in Figs. 2 and3. As can be seen, the induction of NMPs was primarily at G residues (i.e. compare 0 h andG lanes). This is in agreement with past reports (reviewed in Ref. 8Pieper R.O. Nickoloff J.A. Hoekstra M.F. DNA Damage and Repair: DNA Repair in Higher Eukaryotes. 2. Humana Press, Totowa, NJ1998: 33-49Google Scholar), as N 7-methylguanines induced by DMS account for >80% of the total adducts in DNA. We note that galactose caused no obvious change in the induction of NMPs in theUASg and the promoter regions of the GAL1:URA3fusion gene (Fig. 3). In contrast, changes in induction levels are observed in these regions of the single copy genomic GAL1gene.4 As mentioned above, this may reflect insufficient amounts of GAL4p bound to the UASg during galactose induction.Figure 3Phosphorimages of sequencing gels showing repair in the GAL1-URA3 and HIS3fragments.

A decrease in band intensities indicates that NMPs at respective sites are removed. This removal reflects the complete process of BER rather than just the excision of NMPs, as the apurinic sites generated from the excision of NMPs are also alkali-labile and unligated BER intermediates would (by themselves) be DNA single strand breaks. We detected no obvious DNA single strand breaks at any time during repair incubation if the samples were not treated with alkaline piperidine, presumably because the post-excision repair process is very fast. An example of the percentage of NMPs remaining in each strand after 2 h of repair incubation is shown in Fig. 4. As implied by this data, the time course of repair was similar at most sites in the two cultures (Fig. 4). Removal of NMPs does not appear to be coupled to transcription, because the transcribed strands of the constitutively expressed HIS3 gene and the galactose-induced GAL1:URA3 fusion gene are not repaired significantly faster (Figs. Figure 2, Figure 3, Figure 4). The fraction of NMPs remaining at each site in glucose and galactose cultures were directly compared to examine more subtle changes when transcription is induced (Fig.5). These results indicate that a few sites in the GAL1 promoter (nucleotides 462, 502, and 507; also see bands marked with bars in Fig. 3) and downstream of the GAL1:URA3 fusion gene (nucleotides 1684, 1720, and 1741) are repaired faster in galactose cultures. Because these sites are outside of the transcribed regions, this result may reflect subtle disruption of nucleosomes in these two regions that was undetected by nucleosome mapping (19.Omari, S., Chromatin Structure during Transcription in the Yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae.Ph. D. Thesis, 1990, Swiss Federal Institute of Technology, Zurich, Switzerland.Google Scholar). In both glucose and galactose cultures, the repair rate of NMPs varied dramatically along the three fragments (Figs. Figure 2, Figure 3, Figure 4). Analysis of these variations with DNA sequence yielded an unexpected correlation between NMP sequence location and removal by BER. Most NMP sites located between pyrimidines (e.g. bands marked by small arrows in Figs. 2 and 3) are repaired much faster than NMPs between purines, although exceptions to this trend do exist (e.g. bands marked by asterisks in Figs. 2 and 3). To determine how general this sequence effect may be, we compared the repair rates of NMPs at 371 different sites that were well separated (or easily deconvoluted) bands on sequencing gels. As can be seen in Table I, in both glucose and galactose cultures, NMPs between two purines (especially two Gs) are repaired most slowly, NMPs between two pyrimidines (C or T) are repaired most rapidly, and NMPs between a purine and pyrimidine are repaired at a moderate rate. In contrast, second adjacent nucleotides (or a combination of the first and second adjacent nucleotides) have little (or no) effect on repair of NMPs (data not shown).Table IEffect of nearest neighbor nucleotides on repair of NMPsSequenceaThe trinucleotides are shown 5′ → 3′, and underlined bold G denotes the NMP site.NMPs remaining at different repair timesbThe values (means ± S.D.) for both glucose (Glu) and galactose (Gal) cultures were obtained from a total of 371 NMP sites in the three fragments (GAL1-URA3, URA3-3′, andHIS3) of YRpSO1.2 h repair4 h repairGluGalGluGal%A GA88 ± 1191 ± 1480 ± 1778 ± 22A GC82 ± 1082 ± 1468 ± 2064 ± 21A GG91 ± 889 ± 982 ± 880 ± 11A GT81 ± 1877 ± 2362 ± 2758 ± 25C GA82 ± 1182 ± 1466 ± 2365 ± 23C GC66 ± 2154 ± 3038 ± 2736 ± 24C GG91 ± 691 ± 1078 ± 1577 ± 13C GT66 ± 2262 ± 1945 ± 2236 ± 16G GA90 ± 788 ± 1383 ± 1582 ± 18G GC86 ± 1387 ± 1670 ± 1771 ± 22G GG94 ± 5100 ± 391 ± 1093 ± 12G GT80 ± 1178 ± 1259 ± 2156 ± 19T GA82 ± 1779 ± 1859 ± 2258 ± 24T GC68 ± 2265 ± 2846 ± 2945 ± 28T GG91 ± 998 ± 881 ± 1578 ± 15T GT63 ± 2155 ± 2038 ± 2431 ± 18a The trinucleotides are shown 5′ → 3′, and underlined bold G denotes the NMP site.b The values (means ± S.D.) for both glucose (Glu) and galactose (Gal) cultures were obtained from a total of 371 NMP sites in the three fragments (GAL1-URA3, URA3-3′, andHIS3) of YRpSO1. Open table in a new tab As can be deduced from Fig. 4, a rough correlation between nucleosome positions and repair rates exists for both strands of the GAL1:URA3fusion gene in the nucleosome regions approximately centered at nucleotides 1300 and 1460. In these regions, most sites within nucleosomes were repaired slower, whereas most sites in the internucleosome regions were repaired faster. A rough correlation can also be deduced for the TS of the GAL1:URA3 gene in the nucleosome region approximately centered at nucleotides 430 and 610 (Fig. 4). Because nearest neighbor nucleotides can dramatically affect the repair rate of NMPs, the percentages of NMPs remaining at the 371 NMP sites after each repair time were also normalized by the mean values of the corresponding sequence contexts (Table I). After this normalization, the correlation between repair rates of NMPs and nucleosome positioning was somewhat more evident (data not shown). However, no obvious modulation of nucleosome positioning on repair was seen in the HIS3 gene and in the 5′ region of the NTS of theGAL1:URA3 fusion gene (Fig. 4). We observed no obvious preferential removal of NMPs in the transcribed strands of the galactose-induced GAL1:URA3fusion gene and in the constitutively expressed HIS3 gene of YRpSO1 (Figs. Figure 2, Figure 3, Figure 4, Figure 5). Conversely, we have found a coupling between NER of UV-induced cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers and transcription in both of these genes.3 These results agree with those found for BER of NMPs in the DHFR gene of Chinese hamster ovary cells (14Scicchitano D.A. Hanawalt P.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 3050-3054Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 15Scicchitano D.A. Hanawalt P.C. Mutat.

Biol. 1998; 284: 269-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) but differ from those obtained for the insulin gene in rat insulinoma cells (13LeDoux S.P. Patton N.J. Nelson J.W. Bohr V.A. Wilson G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 14875-14880Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). At present, the reason for this discrepancy is unclear, but it may reflect a difference in the mode of gene expression between these cells and/or gene types. In contrast to the lack of correlation with transcription, repair of NMPs is dramatically influenced by nearest neighbor nucleotides (TableI). These nucleotides could have a significant effect on the energy required for flipping out NMPs during recognition and incision by DNA glycosylases (3Lau A.Y. Scharer O.D. Samson L. Verdine G.L. Ellenberger T. Cell. 1998; 95: 249-258Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar, 4Labahn J. Scharer O.D. Long A. Ezaz-Nikpay K. Verdine G.L. Ellenberger T.E.

Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 4713-4717Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Indeed, theoretical calculations show that the stability of base stacking follows the order: purine-purine (G-G slightly > A-A) ≫ purine-pyrimidine > pyrimidine-purine > pyrimidine-pyrimidine, with a 2-kcal/mol spread between the least stable and most stable base pairs (26Friedman R.A. Honig B. Biophys. J. 1995; 69: 1528-1535Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Thus, it can be predicted that NMPs between purines (especially Gs) require the most energy to be flipped out, whereas those between pyrimidines require the least energy. These predictions fit exactly with our results (Table I). However, it should be noted that some NMPs located between pyrimidines were also repaired slowly (e.g. bands marked by asterisks in Figs. 2 and 3). The slow repair at these sites may reflect other factors in chromatin (e.g. nonhistone DNA-binding proteins) that may also affect repair of NMPs. We observed a rather weak correlation between NMP repair and nucleosome positioning (Fig. 4). 4S. Li and M. J. Smerdon, unpublished results.However, this does not necessarily mean that histone binding to DNA has little effect on NMP repair. Although this effect has not been well studied, many reports indicate that NER is modulated by nucleosomes (reviewed in Ref. 18Smerdon M.J. Thoma F. Nickoloff J.A. Hoekstra M.F. DNA Damage and Repair: DNA Repair in Higher Eukaryotes. 2. Humana Press, Totowa, NJ1998: 199-222Google Scholar). Therefore, this weak correlation between NMP repair and nucleosome positioning in YRpSO1 may suggest that the effect of nucleosome positioning is partially “masked” by effects of other factors on repair of NMPs. Finally, recently the more sensitive ligation-mediated polymerase chain reaction method was used to study BER of NMPs in human cells (17Ye N. Holmquist G.P. O'Connor T.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 284: 269-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). These authors also found extreme variability in BER rate at different positions and no transcription-coupled repair in the PGK1gene. Thus, the observations in the present work appear to be testable in mammalian cells. Clearly, it will be of interest to determine whether repair of NMPs in mammalian cells is modulated by the same pattern of nearest neighbor nucleotides as we found in yeast. We thank Dr. Ranjan Gupta for creating the yeast strain RGY1, Dr. Fritz Thoma for supplying the plasmid YRpSO1 and helpful discussions, and Dr. Louise Prakash for providing the yeast strain Y452. We also thank members of the Smerdon laboratory, particularly Maria Meijer and Joseph Kosmoski, for critical discussions."

Aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases are the family of enzymes responsible for correctly linking tRNA molecules with amino acids so that the latter may be subsequently incorporated into growing polypeptide chains. In addition to this fundamental role in protein biosynthesis, these enzymes have additional cellular roles, such as synthesis of signaling dinucleotides. The aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase enzyme family is also widely used in the course of study of such processes as evolution of modular proteins and mechanisms of RNA-protein recognition (reviewed in Refs. 1Kisselev L.L. Wolfson A.D. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol. Biol. 1994; 48: 83-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar and 2Yang D.C.H. Curr. Top. Cell. Regul. 1996; 34: 101-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Recently, attention has turned to the aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases as potential targets for new antibiotics (reviewed in Ref.3Schimmel P. Tao J. Hill J. FASEB J. 1998; 12: 1599-1609Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Additional medical interest is due to the observation that the most widely recognized myositis-specific autoantibodies are directed against aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (reviewed in Ref. 4Targoff I.N. Rheum. Dis. Clin. N. Am. 1994; 20: 857-880PubMed Google Scholar) A unique feature of aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases from higher eukaryotes is the existence of a high molecular mass multisynthetase complex. As isolated from a variety of cell types ranging from mammals to insects, this approximately 1 × 106-Da particle contains nine aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase activities: the arginyl-tRNA synthetase dimer, the aspartyl-tRNA synthetase dimer, glutaminyl-tRNA synthetase, isoleucyl-tRNA synthetase, leucyl-tRNA synthetase, the lysyl-tRNA synthetase dimer, methionyl-tRNA synthetase, and the glutamyl-/prolyl-tRNA synthetase (GluProRS), 1The abbreviations used are: GluProRS, the bifunctional glutamyl-/prolyl-tRNA synthetase polypeptide; ProRS, prolyl-tRNA synthetase; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography1The abbreviations used are: GluProRS, the bifunctional glutamyl-/prolyl-tRNA synthetase polypeptide; ProRS, prolyl-tRNA synthetase; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography which is a bifunctional polypeptide. The multisynthetase complex also contains three additional proteins that are identified by their apparent masses: p43, which contains the complete sequence of the endothelial monocyte-activating polypeptide II cytokine (5Quevillon S.

Chem. 1997; 272: 32573-32579Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar); p38, which is of as yet unknown function; and p18, which may mediate association of the multisynthetase complex with elongation factor 1 (6Quevillon S. Mirande M. FEBS Lett. 1996; 395: 63-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). In order to fully understand the biological function(s) of this intriguing particle, structural details of the multisynthetase complex are necessary. Thus far, electron microscopy studies have shown that the particle measures approximately 27 nm in diameter and appears to be a cup or elongated “U” shape (7Norcum M.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 15043-15051Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) as suggested by the distinct triangular, rectangular, and square-shaped orientations visible in negatively stained electron micrographs. A general idea of the distribution of polypeptides within the complex has been gained through dissociation of the native particle into subcomplexes (8Dang C.V. Yang D.C.H. J. Biol.

Additional evidence in support of interactions between certain of the synthetase polypeptides has been provided through use of the yeast two-hybrid system (10Rho S.B. Lee K.H. Kim J.W. Shiba K.

Within the constraints of these data, a working model has been presented (13Norcum M.T. Warrington J.A. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 79-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), which is composed of three domains arranged into a “Y”-shape made up of two “arms” and a “base.” The composition of each domain as well as likely positions of individual polypeptides within the domains have been suggested, but prior to this study there have been no precise localizations of specific components or sites within the multisynthetase complex. This article describes the first localization of a particular polypeptide within the particle. Specifically, the bifunctional glutamyl-/prolyl-tRNA synthetase has been visualized by immunoelectron microscopy using an antibody directed against prolyl-tRNA synthetase. The multisynthetase complex was isolated from rabbit reticulocyte lysate (Green Hectares) as described previously (13Norcum M.T. Warrington J.A.

As assessed by immunoblot analysis (15Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Samples of approximately 12 μg of multisynthetase complex in storage buffer (50 mmHepes-NaOH, pH 7.4, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mmEDTA, 50% glycerol) were incubated with 5 or 10 μl of one of the two immunoglobulin preparations plus 50 μl of 25 mmHepes-NaOH, pH 7.2, 25 mm NaCl for 2 h at room temperature, then immunocomplexes were isolated by HPLC gel filtration (GPC 300 column, Alltech) in the same buffer. Three different preparations of multisynthetase complex were used. In order to stabilize the multisynthetase complex for electron microscopy glutaraldehyde was added to 0.3% (7Norcum M.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 15043-15051Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and then the immunocomplexes negatively stained with 1% aqueous uranyl acetate. Electron micrographs were obtained with a LEO 912AB microscope operated at 80 kV at absolute magnification of 31,500 or 40,000 using the spectrometer slit to increase contrast by removing inelastically scattered electrons. Immunocomplexes were identified on micrographs and the orientation of the multisynthetase complex and antibody binding site were recorded. Of 413 immunocomplexes analyzed, only 14 were inconsistent with the primary localization. For preparation of figures, electron micrograph negatives were digitized at an optical resolution of 1000 dpi using an Agfa Duoscan flatbed scanner. Composite figures were prepared using standard graphics programs (Imgworks, Showcase and Snapshot) on a Silicon Graphics Indigo2 workstation, then converted to tif format. The original description and characterization of the antibodies directed against rat liver prolyl-tRNA synthetase (14Ting S.M. Bogner P. Dignam J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17701-17709Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) demonstrated specific reaction with the GluProRS polypeptide within the multisynthetase complex. That the immunoglobulin fractions prepared for this study retained that specificity was checked by immunoblot analysis (data not shown). Thus, immunoelectron microscopic visualization of the site of antibody binding is a reliable indicator of the position of this polypeptide within the particle. Panel A of Fig.1 shows a gallery of individual particles of negatively stained multisynthetase complex with one bound antibody. Examples of each type of characteristic orientation (7Norcum M.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 15043-15051Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) of the particle are given. In column A, triangular views of the particle are presented. Panels 1–3 show a “Y”-like orientation in which two arms and a base are visible. These likely correspond to the three domains of the working model of the complex (13Norcum M.T. Warrington J.A. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 79-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The site of antibody binding is clearly seen to be near the division between one arm and the base. In panels 4–6 of column A, the particle appears slightly rotated along the long axis so that the cleft between the arms is no longer visible. These can be termed “intermediate” views. The site of antibody binding is again at the division between the large end of the triangle and the smaller base. This is consistent with the placement based on the first three panels.Column B shows rectangular views of the multisynthetase complex. These have been interpreted to correspond to an approximately 90° rotation around the long axis of the particle from the Y-like view (7Norcum M.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 15043-15051Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The symmetry of this projection precludes assigning one end or the other as an arm or the base. However, the site of antibody binding is consistently located at or near the midpoint of the long axis. This would correspond to the position seen in the triangular orientations, that is, near the division of the two portions of the particle. Column C shows square-like views of the multisynthetase complex. The images in panels 1–3 have a central “hole” into which stain has penetrated, while those inpanels 3–6 do not. These are considered to be views from the “top” and “bottom” of the particle, respectively, given the interpretation that the triangular and rectangular orientations are “front” and “side” views of the “cup”. The site of antibody binding is on the periphery of the multisynthetase particle as suggested by the clear view of bound antibodies. It is also near the midpoint of the particle axis that is orthogonal to the rotational axis relating the triangular and rectangular orientations. Panel B of Fig. 1 is a gallery of images where two particles of the multisynthetase complex are linked by a single antibody. The dimers shown in column A all contain one particle in which the central cleft between the arms is visible, that is, front views. In each, the site of antibody binding is again at or near the division between an arm and the base. In panels 3 and 5, the other antigen combining site of the antibody is linked to a multisynthetase particle in the rectangular orientation. Again, the binding site is near the center of the long axis of the complex. Panels 1and 2 of column B clearly show antibodies linking the midpoints of two rectangular views and a rectangular with an intermediate orientation, respectively. The remaining images incolumn B show linked particles in the top or bottom orientations, which also emphasize the location of the antibody binding site near the midpoint of the complex. Approximately 3% of immunocomplexes analyzed cannot be interpreted in a manner consistent with the existence of only one antibody binding site near the intersection of two domains of the multisynthetase particle. Examples of these are shown in Fig.2. In column A are immunocomplexes that appear to have two antibody molecules bound to one multisynthetase complex. In each case, one site is consistent with that described above, while the other is on the opposite side of the particle. These views suggest the presence of another binding site, but their rare occurrence indicates that it is likely nonspecific binding. In column B, two antibodies are also bound, but their binding sites are very close together. However, both are consistent with localization of the GluProRS polypeptide near the midpoint of the particle. Column C shows dimers that are linked by two antibodies. Panels 1 and 2 each have one multisynthetase particle in the “front” view, which again clearly show that the primary antibody binding site is near the intersection of an arm and the base. The rectangular view of one of the particles inpanel 3 emphasizes the location of the epitopes near the midpoint of the long axis. The above data are summarized in a schematic (Fig.3) showing the relationship of the different particle orientations. When viewed from the front where the central cleft is visible, the major antibody binding site is near the division between one arm and the base of the particle. Partial rotation of the particle around the long axis gives an intermediate view, while the rectangular orientation can be considered the side view. In both, the primary antibody binding site is still clearly visible near the midpoint of the particle. The top and bottom orientations are obtained by orthogonal rotation, shown here from the intermediate view. Antibody binding is near the midpoint of one side of each square view. The area in the drawings representing the primary antibody binding site encompasses sections of both an arm and the base. This is to account for the variability of antibody location along the long axis as seen in both triangular (Fig. 1, panel A, column A) and rectangular (Fig. 1, panel A, column B) orientations, as well as the examples of closely spaced binding of two antibodies (Fig. 2, columns B and C). As suggested by the examples shown in column A of Fig. 2, a secondary minor binding site is depicted on the opposite side of the particle. The immunoelectron microscopic data presented here provide the first visualization of a specific site within the multisynthetase complex. The GluProRS polypeptide has been localized within a defined area of the particle by mapping the binding of antibody directed against ProRS. The primary area of antibody binding observed in this study overlaps significantly with the placement of GluProRS in the base of the three domain working model, which is based largely on cross-linking data (13Norcum M.T. Warrington J.A. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 79-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Although the primary area of antibody binding observed here is centered around the midpoint of the particle axes, it encompasses sections of both the domain termed the base as well as one arm domain. Not only is this range of locations noticeable in immunocomplexes containing one antibody (Fig. 1, panels A and B), but there are also images where two antibodies are bound in close proximity on the multisynthetase complex (Fig. 2, columns B andC). One explanation of these data is that the ProRS domain of GluProRS is very elongated and bridges the two particle domains. The range of binding site placements would thus be due to antibodies within the polyclonal immunoglobulin preparations that recognize multiple epitopes within the polypeptide. A second possibility is that the two closely bound antibodies are detecting two copies of GluProRS within the complex. A dimer can be envisioned to more easily cover the approximately 10-nm spread of the binding site. A stoichiometry of two copies of the bifunctional synthetase has been reported in complex from sheep liver (16Kerjan P. Triconnet M. Waller J.P. Biochimie (Paris). 1992; 74: 195-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), while others have observed variability from 1.0 to 1.5 in preparations from rat liver, rabbit liver, and rabbit reticulocytes (17Godar D.E. Godar D.E. Garcia V. Jacobo A. Aebi U. Yang D.C.H. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 6921-6928Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). In addition, when mammalian prolyl-tRNA synthetase is isolated in its low molecular mass form, it occurs as a dimer (14Ting S.M. Bogner P. Dignam J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17701-17709Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,18Bianchi C. Perego R. Del Monte U. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 187: 1071-1076Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). It would thus seem likely that the bifunctional polypeptide form is also a dimer. However, in preparations from this laboratory, the estimated molar ratio of the GluProRS polypeptide has always been close to one (7Norcum M.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 15043-15051Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Norcum M.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15398-15405Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), but this is a relative value based on densitometric analysis of bands on polyacrylamide gels. The presence of small numbers of complexes with an additional GluProRS polypeptide bound at a separate site within the complex would explain the observation here of the second, but rare, antibody binding site. This would also be consistent with the specificity of binding demonstrated by immunoblot analyses. If a monoclonal antibody to the GluProRS were available, the appropriate explanation could be readily determined and the binding site likely restricted considerably. As an alternative, tRNAPro and/or tRNAGlu can be used as structural probes for the two active sites within this bifunctional enzyme. Such experiments are currently under way. We sincerely thank J. Anthony Warrington for excellent technical assistance with protein purification and HPLC analyses."

The plausible intermediates 2-hydroxytrichodiene (2α- and 2β-) and 12,13-epoxytrichodiene and the dioxygenated compounds 12,13-epoxy-9,10-trichoene-2-ol (2α- and 2β-) were prepared specifically labeled with stable isotopes. They were then fed separately and/or together to Fusarium culmorum cultures, and the derived trichothecenes were isolated, purified, and analyzed. The stable isotopes enable easy localization of the labels in the products by 2H NMR, 13C NMR, and mass spectrometry. We found that 2α-hydroxytrichodiene is the first oxygenated step in the biosynthesis of both 3-acetyldeoxynivalenol and sambucinol. The stereoisomer 2β-hydroxytrichodiene and 12,13-epoxytrichodiene are not biosynthetic intermediates and have not been isolated as metabolites. We also demonstrated that the dioxygenated 12,13-epoxy-9,10-trichoene-2α-ol is a biosynthetic precursor to trichothecenes as had been suggested in a preliminary work. Its stereoisomer was not found in the pathway.

Trichothecenes are toxic secondary metabolites produced by fungi, in particular by Fusarium spp. They infect mostly wheat, grains, and corn and therefore affect human and animal health (1Rotter B.A. Prelusky D.B. Toxicol. Environ. Health. 1996; 48: 1-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (876) Google Scholar, 2Denijs M. Van Egmond H.P. Rombouts F.M. Notermans S.H.W. J.

Toxigenic Fusarium Species: Identity and Mycotoxicology. Pennsylvania State University Press, University Park, PA1984: 147-151Google Scholar): 3-acetyldeoxynivalenol (3-ADN) 1The abbreviations used are: 3-ADN, 3-acetyldeoxynivalenol; SOL, sambucinol; pre-SOL, 3-deoxysambucinol; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography; s, d, t, q and m, the usual singlet, doublet, triplet, quartet, and multiplet signals in NMR spectra; br and o, broad or overlapping lines, respectively; NOE, nuclear Overhauser effect; NOESY, nuclear Overhauser effect two-dimensional spectroscopy; FAB, fast atom bombardment; MS, mass spectrometry; t R, retention timeand sambucinol (SOL) (Fig. 1). These mycotoxins have been known for a long time (6Greenhalgh R. Hanson A.W. Miller J.D. Taylor A. J. Agric. Food Chem. 1984; 32: 945-948Crossref Scopus (33) Google Scholar); however, there is not yet an efficient detoxification procedure. Since trichodiene (TDN; 1, Fig. 1), the biosynthetic precursor to trichothecenes, is not toxic, knowledge of its first oxidized metabolite will enable the design of a potent inhibitor to trichothecenes. We therefore decided to focus on the identification of the oxygenation steps after the hydrocarbon trichodiene. The first oxygenated trichodiene derivatives isolated from F. culmorumwere 9,10-trichoene-12,13-diol (2d) and 12,13-epoxy-9,10-trichoene-2α-ol (3a) (Fig. 1) (8Zamir L.O. Devor K.A. Morin N. Sauriol F. J. Chem. Soc. Chem. Commun. 1991; : 1033-1035Crossref Google Scholar). These compounds had been detected by the kinetic pulse-labeling method (7Zamir L.O. Devor K.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 15348-15353Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and could accumulate when the inhibitor ancymidol was used (8Zamir L.O. Devor K.A. Morin N. Sauriol F. J. Chem. Soc. Chem. Commun. 1991; : 1033-1035Crossref Google Scholar). In addition, they had been isolated with a radiolabel after feeding (3RS)-[2-14C]mevalonate to F. culmorum cultures and isolating and purifying the derived radiolabeled 2d and 3a. These compounds were separately fed to F. culmorum cultures, and the derived trichothecenes 3-ADN and SOL were recovered and analyzed. Metabolite3a was found to be incorporated in both 3-ADN and SOL, whereas the trichothecenes obtained after the feeding of 2dwere unlabeled. This preliminary result suggests that 3amight be a biosynthetic precursor to 3-ADN and SOL, whereas2d is a dead end metabolite (8Zamir L.O. Devor K.A. Morin N. Sauriol F. J. Chem. Soc. Chem. Commun. 1991; : 1033-1035Crossref Google Scholar). This result is not extremely rigorous, since no degradation could be done on the radiolabeled trichothecenes obtained from the feeding of compound3a to prove the labeled site. Indeed, there is a possibility that the metabolite 3a was degraded and then resynthesized into the trichothecenes. Since we wanted to determine with certainty the sequence of oxygenation post-trichodiene, our first goal was to determine unambiguously if 3a is the dioxygenated metabolite and then what is the first oxygenated precursor: 2a,2b, or 2c. The isolated 2d was shown to be a dead end product and probably derives from opening of the epoxide 2c (8Zamir L.O. Devor K.A. Morin N. Sauriol F. J. Chem. Soc. Chem. Commun. 1991; : 1033-1035Crossref Google Scholar). In this paper, we have rigorously proven, for the first time, the two oxygenation steps of trichodiene and their sequence. A biosynthetic scheme for all of the oxidations leading to 3-ADN and SOL is proposed. Analytical high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) was performed on the same instrument used previously (9Zamir L.O. Nikolakakis A. Devor K.A. Sauriol F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27353-27359Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) or on a Perkin-Elmer Binary LC pump 250 coupled to a Waters 990 photodiode array detector or on a Waters 600 pump coupled to a Waters 996 photodiode array detector. Preparative and semipreparative HPLC were performed on a Waters Delta Prep 3000 instrument coupled to a Lambda-Max model 481 LC spectrophotometric detector. All ultraviolet detectors were set at 204 nm. Infrared spectra were measured in chloroform with a Perkin-Elmer model 683 infrared spectrophotometer. Flash chromatography was performed on silica gel 60, 230–400 mesh (EM Science). Thin layer chromatography was conducted on Silica Gel 60 F254-precoated TLC plates, 0.25 mm (EM Science). High performance TLC was run with LHP-KF, 0.2-mm plates (Whatman). Radiolabeled compounds were analyzed with a Bioscan Imaging Scanner System 200 (10Zamir L.O. Devor K.A. Sauriol F. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 14992-15000Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A Tracor Analytic Delta 300 instrument was used for liquid scintillation counting. F. culmorum slant cultures were homogenized with a Polytron homogenizer (10Zamir L.O. Devor K.A. Sauriol F. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 14992-15000Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). An F. culmorumstrain (HLX-1503) was grown as described previously (7Zamir L.O. Devor K.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 15348-15353Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Seed cultures were grown for either 2 or 3 days. Production cultures (25 ml of production medium in a 125-ml Erlenmeyer flask) were incubated for 1, 2, or 3 days. All of the NMR spectra were obtained at room temperature with a UNITY-500 spectrometer operating at 499.843 MHz for1H, 125.697 MHz for13C, and 76.735 MHz for 2H. The NMR spectra were obtained on 1–2 mg (natural product) and 5–10 mg (synthetic compounds) dissolved in 0.3–0.4 ml of deuterochloroform. The nuclear Overhauser effect two-dimensional spectroscopy (NOESY) experiment (hypercomplex phase mode) was obtained using a mixing time of 0.3 s and a relaxation delay of 1 s. For the compounds studied, when the diagonal signals were phased negative, the cross-peaks resulting from dipolar relaxation (nuclear Overhauser effect (NOE)) were phased positive. Fast atom bombardment (FAB) mass spectra were obtained with a V G ZAB-HS double-focusing instrument using a xenon beam having 8 kV energy at 1 mA equivalent current. The ratio between enriched and nonenriched metabolites was obtained by comparing, in the proton NMR, the integration of the doublet derived from the coupling of13C-H and the singlet corresponding to 12C-H. The extent of 13C (or 2H) obtained from labeled feedings was determined by correction of the appropriate protonated or sodiated quasimolecular ion clusters present in a computer average of 10 scans in low resolution FAB. The intensity of each ion of the cluster was reduced by the calculated contribution at that mass by natural heavy isotope substitution in all lighter ions of the cluster. The remaining intensities then represent the relative abundances of each labeled species. The percentage of isotope labeling estimated by NMR and by mass spectrometry (MS) agreed reasonably well. Analytical, semipreparative, and preparative HPLC was performed with the same columns as previously recorded (9Zamir L.O. Nikolakakis A. Devor K.A. Sauriol F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27353-27359Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). HPLC gradient A consisted of a linear gradient lasting 50 min with an initial concentration of 15% methanol, 85% water and a final concentration of 75% methanol, 25% water, which was held for 30 min and then increased linearly for 10 min to 100% methanol. The concentration was held for 20 min at 100% methanol before equilibrating to 15% methanol, 85% water. HPLC gradient B consisted of a linear gradient lasting 50 min with an initial concentration of 40% methanol, 60% water and a final concentration of 100% methanol, which was then held for 20 min. The metabolites isolated from the feedings were purified on analytical HPLC following isocratic conditions at a flow rate of 1 ml/min as follows: for 3-ADN, 35% methanol, 65% water; for SOL, 50% methanol, 50% water; for diacyl-SOL, 62% methanol, 38% water.

The 12,13-epoxy-[16-13C]9,10-trichoene-2β-ol3b, 45 mg in total, was dissolved in methanol and was equally distributed among nine sterile 125-ml Erlenmeyer flasks. The methanol was allowed to evaporate from the stoppered flasks overnight. To each of the nine flasks was added 0.1 ml of a 5% Brij 35 solution (15Zamir L.O. Gauthier M.J. Devor K.A. Nadeau Y. Sauriol F. J. Chem. Soc. Chem. Commun. 1989; : 598-600Crossref Google Scholar) and one 48-h production culture (previously prepared from a 3-day-old seed culture). Three controls were prepared by adding 0.1 ml of a 5% Brij 35 solution to each of three 48-h production cultures. The cultures were incubated for 7 days at 25 °C and 220 rpm. After 7 days, the three controls and the nine samples were filtered separately. The filtrates were saturated with NaCl and extracted with ethyl acetate. The organic extracts were dried over MgSO4, filtered, and concentrated in vacuo. The sample crude extract was fractionated by preparative HPLC using gradient A at 18 ml/min. Fraction 1 and fraction 3, corresponding to 3-ADN (t R = 36 min) and SOL (t R= 48 min), respectively, were further purified by HPLC. The pure 3-ADN (t R = 37 min) that was isolated contained no13C incorporation. SOL was acetylated by incubation at 25 °C for"
https://openalex.org/W2333046041,"A hallmark of neoplastic transformation by DNA tumor viruses is the deregulation of cell cycle genes. At least in some genes, this deregulation appears to be due to the oncoprotein-mediated disruption of complexes between E2F and pocket proteins and the ensuing generation of transcriptionally active free E2F. In the present study, we have analysed the effect of the SV40 large T oncoprotein (SV-LT) on the function of a different cell cycle-regulated transcriptional repressor, CDF, which is the principal regulator of the cdc25C, cyclin A and cdc2 genes. As shown by genomic footprinting of sorted G1 and G2 cell populations, transformation by SV-LT completely abrogated protection of the CDF binding site (CDE-CHR) in the cdc25C promoter. In agreement with this observation, expression of the SV-LT in fibroblasts led to a dramatic up-regulation of the cdc25C promoter in cells synchronized in G0. These findings indicate that the oncoprotein-mediated dissociation of the CDF repressor protein from its cognate DNA-binding site is a major mechanism in virus-induced transcriptional deregulation."
