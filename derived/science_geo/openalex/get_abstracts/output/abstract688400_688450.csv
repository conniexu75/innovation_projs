https://openalex.org/W4225753362,"The COVID-19 outbreak has posed an unprecedented challenge to humanity and science. On the one side, public and private incentives have been put in place to promptly allocate resources toward research areas strictly related to the COVID-19 emergency. However, research in many fields not directly related to the pandemic has been displaced. In this paper, we assess the impact of COVID-19 on world scientific production in the life sciences and find indications that the usage of medical subject headings (MeSH) has changed following the outbreak. We estimate through a difference-in-differences approach the impact of the start of the COVID-19 pandemic on scientific production using the PubMed database (3.6 Million research papers). We find that COVID-19-related MeSH terms have experienced a 6.5 fold increase in output on average, while publications on unrelated MeSH terms dropped by 10 to 12%. The publication weighted impact has an even more pronounced negative effect (-16% to -19%). Moreover, COVID-19 has displaced clinical trial publications (-24%) and diverted grants from research areas not closely related to COVID-19. Note that since COVID-19 publications may have been fast-tracked, the sudden surge in COVID-19 publications might be driven by editorial policy."

However, the reactions that can be run autonomously are still limited. Automating the stereospecific assembly of Csp3–C bonds would expand access to many important types of functional organic molecules1. Previously, methyliminodiacetic acid (MIDA) boronates were used to orchestrate the formation of Csp2–Csp2 bonds and were effective building blocks for automating the synthesis of many small molecules2, but they are incompatible with stereospecific Csp3–Csp2 and Csp3–Csp3 bond-forming reactions3–10. Here we report that hyperconjugative and steric tuning provide a new class of tetramethyl N-methyliminodiacetic acid (TIDA) boronates that are stable to these conditions. Charge density analysis11–13 revealed that redistribution of electron density increases covalency of the N–B bond and thereby attenuates its hydrolysis. Complementary steric shielding of carbonyl π-faces decreases reactivity towards nucleophilic reagents. The unique features of the iminodiacetic acid cage2, which are essential for generalized automated synthesis, are retained by TIDA boronates. This enabled Csp3 boronate building blocks to be assembled using automated synthesis, including the preparation of natural products through automated stereospecific Csp3–Csp2 and Csp3–Csp3 bond formation. These findings will enable increasingly complex Csp3-rich small molecules to be accessed via automated assembly. Identification of a hyperstable boronate enables automated lego-like synthesis to access a wider range of three-dimensionally complex small organic molecules rich in Csp3–C bonds."
https://openalex.org/W3153178885,"The COVID-19 pandemic has been damaging to the lives of people all around the world. Accompanied by the pandemic is an infodemic, an abundant and uncontrolled spread of potentially harmful misinformation. The infodemic may severely change the pandemic's course by interfering with public health interventions such as wearing masks, social distancing, and vaccination. In particular, the impact of the infodemic on vaccination is critical because it holds the key to reverting to pre-pandemic normalcy. This paper presents findings from a global survey on the extent of worldwide exposure to the COVID-19 infodemic, assesses different populations' susceptibility to false claims, and analyzes its association with vaccine acceptance. Based on responses gathered from over 18,400 individuals from 40 countries, we find a strong association between perceived believability of COVID-19 misinformation and vaccination hesitancy. Our study shows that only half of the online users exposed to rumors might have seen corresponding fact-checked information. Moreover, depending on the country, between 6% and 37% of individuals considered these rumors believable. A key finding of this research is that poorer regions were more susceptible to encountering and believing COVID-19 misinformation; countries with lower gross domestic product (GDP) per capita showed a substantially higher prevalence of misinformation. We discuss implications of our findings to public campaigns that proactively spread accurate information to countries that are more susceptible to the infodemic. We also defend that fact-checking platforms should prioritize claims that not only have wide exposure but are also perceived to be believable. Our findings give insights into how to successfully handle risk communication during the initial phase of a future pandemic."
https://openalex.org/W4210918803,"Researchers, policy makers and science communicators have become increasingly been interested in factors that affect public's trust in science. Recently, one such potentially important driving factor has emerged, the COVID-19 pandemic. Have trust in science and other science-related beliefs changed in Germany from before to during the pandemic? To investigate this, we re-analyzed data from a set of representative surveys conducted in April, May, and November 2020, which were obtained as part of the German survey Science Barometer, and compared it to data from the last annual Science Barometer survey that took place before the pandemic, (in September 2019). Results indicate that German's trust in science increased substantially after the pandemic began and slightly declined in the months thereafter, still being higher in November 2020 than in September 2019. Moreover, trust was closely related to expectations about how politics should handle the pandemic. We also find that increases of trust were most pronounced among the higher-educated. But as the pandemic unfolded, decreases of trust were more likely among supporters of the populist right-wing party AfD. We discuss the sustainability of these dynamics as well as implications for science communication."

https://openalex.org/W4210941149,"Vaccine hesitancy is currently recognized by the WHO as a major threat to global health. Recently, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic, there has been a growing interest in the role of social media in the propagation of false information and fringe narratives regarding vaccination. Using a sample of approximately 60 billion tweets, we conduct a large-scale analysis of the vaccine discourse on Twitter. We use methods from deep learning and transfer learning to estimate the vaccine sentiments expressed in tweets, then categorize individual-level user attitude towards vaccines. Drawing on an interaction graph representing mutual interactions between users, we analyze the interplay between vaccine stances, interaction network, and the information sources shared by users in vaccine-related contexts. We find that strongly anti-vaccine users frequently share content from sources of a commercial nature; typically sources which sell alternative health products for profit. An interesting aspect of this finding is that concerns regarding commercial conflicts of interests are often cited as one of the major factors in vaccine hesitancy. Further, we show that the debate is highly polarized, in the sense that users with similar stances on vaccination interact preferentially with one another. Extending this insight, we provide evidence of an epistemic echo chamber effect, where users are exposed to highly dissimilar sources of vaccine information, depending the vaccination stance of their contacts. Our findings highlight the importance of understanding and addressing vaccine mis- and dis-information in the context in which they are disseminated in social networks."
https://openalex.org/W4210859775,"The novel coronavirus-19 (COVID-19) has taken an immense physical, social, and emotional toll on frontline healthcare workers. Research has documented higher levels of anxiety, depression, and burnout among healthcare workers during the pandemic. Thus, creative interventions are needed now more than ever to provide brief, accessible support to frontline workers. Virtual reality is a rapidly growing technology with potential psychological applications. In this study, we piloted a three-minute Tranquil Cinematic-VR simulation of a nature scene to lower subjective stress among frontline healthcare workers in COVID-19 treatment units. We chose to film a nature scene because of the extensive empirical literature documenting the benefits of nature exposure and health.A convenience sample of frontline healthcare workers, including direct care providers, indirect care providers, and support or administrative services, were recruited from three COVID-19 units located in the United States. Inclusion criteria for participation included adults aged 18 years and older who could read and speak in English and were currently employed by the healthcare system. Participants viewed a 360-degree video capture of a lush, green nature preserve in an Oculus Go or Pico G2 4K head-mounted display. Prior to viewing the simulation, participants completed a brief demographic questionnaire and the visual analogue scale to rate their subjective stress on a 10-point scale, with 1 = 'Not at all stressed' to 10 = 'Extremely stressed.' We conducted paired t-tests to examine pre- and post-simulation changes in subjective stress as well as Kruskal-Wallis tests and Mann-Whitney U tests to examine differences by demographic variables. All analyses were conducted in SPSS statistical software version 28.0. We defined statistical significance as a p-value less than .05.A total of 102 individuals consented to participate in the study. Eighty-four (82.4%) participants reported providing direct patient care, 73 (71.6%) identified as women, 49 (48.0%) were between the ages of 25-34 years old, and 35 (34.3%) had prior experience with VR. The pre-simulation mean stress score was 5.5±2.2, with a range of 1 to 10. Thirty-three (32.4%) participants met the 6.8 cutoff for high stress pre-simulation. Pre-simulation stress scores did not differ by any demographic variables. Post-simulation, we observed a significant reduction in subjective stress scores from pre- to post-simulation (mean change = -2.2±1.7, t = 12.749, p < .001), with a Cohen's d of 1.08, indicating a very large effect. Further, only four (3.9%) participants met the cutoff for high stress after the simulation. Post-simulations scores did not differ by provider type, age range, gender, or prior experience with virtual reality.Findings from this pilot study suggest that the application of this Tranquil Cinematic-VR simulation was effective in reducing subjective stress among frontline healthcare workers in the short-term. More research is needed to compare the Tranquil Cinematic-VR simulation to a control condition and assess subjective and objective measures of stress over time."
https://openalex.org/W4210908665,"Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, conspiracy theories about the virus spread rapidly, and whilst governments across the globe put in place different restrictions and guidelines to contain the pandemic, these were not universally adhered to. This research examined the association between pandemic related risk perceptions, belief in conspiracy theories, and compliance with COVID-19 public guidelines amongst a UK sample (n = 368). Participants rated their level of concern for a series of potential risks during the pandemic (to the economy, personal health, freedom, media integrity and health risk to others). Participants also rated their level of belief in different conspiracy theories and self-reported their behaviour during the first UK lockdown. Mediational analyses showed that stronger belief in conspiracy theories was associated with perceptions of lower risk to health and higher risk to the economy and freedom, which in turn were associated with lower compliance with COVID-19 related governmental guidelines. Perception of information transparency risks did not mediate the association between belief in conspiracy theories and compliant behaviours. These results highlight the key role that risk perception may play in translating belief in conspiracy theories into low compliance with governmental COVID-19 related guidelines. Our findings suggest new patterns with respect to the relationship between conspiracy theory adherence and salience of different risk perceptions amidst the pandemic, which could have implications for the development of public health messaging and communication interventions."

Our aim is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) for prophylaxis of coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) in health personnel exposed to patients infected by SARS-CoV-2.Double-blind randomized, placebo-controlled single center clinical trial. Included subjects were health care workers caring for severe COVID-19 patients. Main outcome was time to symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection.127 subjects with a confirmed baseline negative RT-PCR SARS-CoV2 test were included in the trial. 62 assigned to HCQ and 65 to placebo. One subject (1.6%) in the HCQ group and 6 (9.2%) subjects in the placebo group developed COVID-19 (Log-Rank test p = 0.07). No severe COVID-19 cases were observed. The study was suspended because of a refusal to participate and losses to follow up after several trials reported lack of effectiveness of hydroxychloroquine in hospitalized patients with COVID-19.The effect size of hydroxychloroquine was higher than placebo for COVID-19 symptomatic infection in health personnel, although this was not statistically significant. The trial is underpowered due to the failure to complete the estimated sample size."
https://openalex.org/W4210845137,"Ultrasound imaging is a vital component of high-quality Obstetric care. In rural and under-resourced communities, the scarcity of ultrasound imaging results in a considerable gap in the healthcare of pregnant mothers. To increase access to ultrasound in these communities, we developed a new automated diagnostic framework operated without an experienced sonographer or interpreting provider for assessment of fetal biometric measurements, fetal presentation, and placental position. This approach involves the use of a standardized volume sweep imaging (VSI) protocol based solely on external body landmarks to obtain imaging without an experienced sonographer and application of a deep learning algorithm (U-Net) for diagnostic assessment without a radiologist. Obstetric VSI ultrasound examinations were performed in Peru by an ultrasound operator with no previous ultrasound experience who underwent 8 hours of training on a standard protocol. The U-Net was trained to automatically segment the fetal head and placental location from the VSI ultrasound acquisitions to subsequently evaluate fetal biometry, fetal presentation, and placental position. In comparison to diagnostic interpretation of VSI acquisitions by a specialist, the U-Net model showed 100% agreement for fetal presentation (Cohen's κ 1 (p<0.0001)) and 76.7% agreement for placental location (Cohen's κ 0.59 (p<0.0001)). This corresponded to 100% sensitivity and specificity for fetal presentation and 87.5% sensitivity and 85.7% specificity for anterior placental location. The method also achieved a low relative error of 5.6% for biparietal diameter and 7.9% for head circumference. Biometry measurements corresponded to estimated gestational age within 2 weeks of those assigned by standard of care examination with up to 89% accuracy. This system could be deployed in rural and underserved areas to provide vital information about a pregnancy without a trained sonographer or interpreting provider. The resulting increased access to ultrasound imaging and diagnosis could improve disparities in healthcare delivery in under-resourced areas."
https://openalex.org/W4210860689,"This study investigated the relationship between urban form and land surface temperature (LST) using the Multi-access Geographically Weighted Regression (MGWR) model. A case study on Nanjing City was conducted using building data, point-of-interest (POI) data, land use data, remote sensing data, and elevation data. The results show that the MGWR model can reveal the influence of altitude, urban green space, road, building height (BH), building density (BD) and POI on LST, with a superior fitting effect over the geographically weighted regression model. LST in Nanjing exhibits a significant spatial differentiation, and the distribution of LST hotspots is spatially consistent with the level of urban construction. In terms of the two-dimensional landscape pattern, LST decreases with altitude and increases with POI. In terms of the three-dimensional structure, building height has a positive correlation with LST. POI, urban roads, and urban buildings positively affect LST, while urban green space and altitude negatively affect LST. The results of this study were verified against existing findings. The LST of areas with high-rise and super high-rise buildings is lower than that of areas with mid-rise building, which can be attributed to the large number of shadow areas formed by high-rise and super high-rise buildings. A similar phenomenon was also observed between areas with medium- and high-density buildings. These findings provide a reference for urban architecture planning and can help to develop urban heat island adaptation strategies based on local conditions."
https://openalex.org/W4210898251,"Seagrasses form the foundation of many coastal ecosystems but are rapidly declining on a global scale. The Dutch Wadden Sea once supported extensive subtidal seagrass meadows that have all disappeared. Here, we report on the setbacks and successes of intertidal seed-based restoration experiments in the Dutch Wadden Sea between 2014–2017. Our main goals were to 1) optimize plant densities, and 2) reduce seed losses. To achieve our goals, we conducted research-based, adaptive seagrass ( Zostera marina ) restoration, adjusting methods yearly based on previous results. We applied various seeding methods in three subsequent years–from Buoy Deployed Seeding (BuDS), and ‘BuDS-in-frame’ in fall, to a newly developed ‘Dispenser Injection Seeding’ (DIS) method. Our adaptive experimental approach revealed high seed losses between seeding and seedling establishment of the BuDS methods (&gt;99.9%), which we mitigated by controlled harvest and storage of seeds throughout fall and winter, followed by DIS-seeding in spring. These iterative innovations resulted in 83 times higher plant densities in the field (0.012 to 1.00 plants m -2 ) and a small reduction in seed loss (99.94 to 99.75%) between 2015–2017. Although these developments have not yet resulted in self-sustaining seagrass populations, we are one step closer towards upscaling seagrass restoration in the Dutch Wadden Sea. Our outcomes suggest that an iterative, research-based restoration approach that focuses on technological advancement of precision-seeding may result in advancing knowledge and improved seed-based seagrass restoration successes."

Methods PFTPs were compared between male and female Indigenous Australian adults with and without chest radiologically proven chronic airway diseases (CADs). Results 485 adults (56% were female) with no significant difference in age, body mass index or smoking status between sexes were included. Females displayed a higher prevalence of radiology without CADs compared to males (66 vs. 52%, respectively). Among patients without CADs, after adjustment for age, stature and smoking, males displayed significantly higher absolute values of Forced Vital Capacity (FVC) (mean difference, 0.41L (0.21,0.62), p&lt;0.001) and Forced Expiratory Volume in one second (FEV 1 ) (mean difference 0.27L (0.07,0.47), p&lt;0.001), with no significant difference in FEV 1 /FVC ratio (mean difference -0.02 (-0.06, 0.02), p = 0.174). Male and female patients with radiologically proven CADs demonstrated lower FEV 1 /FVC values. However, compared to females, males showed significantly greater reductions in pre- [-0.53 (-0.74, -0.32) vs. -0.29 (-0.42, -0.16), p = 0.045] and post- [-0.51 (-0.72, -0.3) vs. -0.27 (-0.39, -0.14), p = 0.049] bronchodilator FEV 1 . Conclusions There are significant sex differences in the PFTPs among Indigenous Australians. Recognising these differences may be of value in the accurate diagnosis, management, monitoring and prognostication of CADs in this population."

https://openalex.org/W4210826202,"The biopsychological response patterns to digital stress have been sparsely investigated so far. Important potential stressors in modern working environments due to increased digitalization are multitasking and work interruptions. In this study protocol, we present a protocol for a laboratory experiment, in which we will investigate the biopsychological stress response patterns to multitasking and work interruptions.In total, N = 192 healthy, adult participants will be assigned to six experimental conditions in a randomized order (one single-task, three dual-task (two in parallel and one as interruption), one multitasking, and one passive control condition). Salivary alpha-amylase as well as heart rate as markers for Sympathetic Nervous System Activity, heart rate variability as measure for Parasympathetic Nervous System (PNS) activity, and cortisol as measure for activity of the hypothalamic-pituitary adrenal (HPA) axis will be assessed at six time points throughout the experimental session. Furthermore, inflammatory markers (i.e., IL-6, C-reactive protein (CRP), and secretory immunoglobulin-A) will be assessed before and after the task as well as 24 hours after it (IL-6 and CRP only). Main outcomes will be the time course of these physiological stress markers. Reactivity of these measures will be compared between the experimental conditions (dual-tasking, work interruptions, and multitasking) with the control conditions (single-tasking and passive control).With this study protocol, we present a comprehensive experiment, which will enable an extensive investigation of physiological stress-responses to multitasking and work interruptions. Our planned study will contribute to a better understanding of physiological response patterns to modern (digital) stressors. Potential risks and limitations are discussed. The findings will have important implications, especially in the context of digital health in modern working and living environments."
https://openalex.org/W4210870874,"The membrane protein M of the Porcine Epidemic Diarrhea Virus (PEDV) is the most abundant component of the viral envelope. The M protein plays a central role in the morphogenesis and assembly of the virus through protein interactions of the M-M, M-Spike (S) and M-nucleocapsid (N) type. The M protein is known to induce protective antibodies in pigs and to participate in the antagonistic response of the cellular antiviral system coordinated by the type I and type III interferon pathways. The 3D structure of the PEDV M protein is still unknown. The present work exposes a predicted 3D model of the M protein generated using the Robetta protocol. The M protein model is organized into a transmembrane and a globular region. The obtained 3D model of the PEDV M protein was compared with 3D models of the SARS-CoV-2 M protein created using neural networks and with initial machine learning-based models created using trRosetta. The 3D model of the present study predicted four linear B-cell epitopes (RSVNASSGTG and KHGDYSAVSNPSALT peptides are noteworthy), six discontinuous B-cell epitopes, forty weak binding and fourteen strong binding T-cell epitopes in the CV777 M protein. A high degree of conservation of the epitopes predicted in the PEDV M protein was observed among different PEDV strains isolated in different countries. The data suggest that the M protein could be a potential candidate for the development of new treatments or strategies that activate protective cellular mechanisms against viral diseases."

This harmful practice violates children's rights and continues to be widespread across developing nations like Bangladesh. This study investigated the mortality trend among Bangladeshi children and the impact of child marriage on under-5 children morbidity and mortality in Bangladesh.A sample of 8,321 children under-5 years old was analyzed using bivariate and multivariate statistical techniques collected from the recent 2017-18 BDHS data. Chi-square test and logistic regression (unadjusted and adjusted) were used to determine the influence of covariates on the target variable.Results revealed that child mortality was significantly higher among children whose mothers married at an early age than their counterparts. Although the general trend in the prevalence of different childhood mortality in Bangladesh was declining gradually from 1993 to 2018, it was still high in 2018. Also, marriage after 18 years lessens likelihood of diarrhea (adjusted OR = 0.93; 95% CI: 0.76-1.16) and cough (adjusted OR = 0.91; 95% CI: 0.78-1.17) among children. Furthermore, findings reveal that likelihood of different child mortality is higher among early married women.Immediate intervention through rigorous enforcement of policies and different programs to raise the age at marriage and by lessening socioeconomic disparities can combat the prevalence of high morbidity and mortality of under-5 years old children. Findings from this study will be helpful to accelerate strategies for achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) related to child and maternal health by 2030."
https://openalex.org/W3183357808,"Numerous metallurgical and materials science applications depend on quantitative atomic-scale characterizations of environmentally-sensitive materials and their transient states. Studying the effect upon materials subjected to thermochemical treatments in specific gaseous atmospheres is of central importance for specifically studying a material's resistance to certain oxidative or hydrogen environments. It is also important for investigating catalytic materials, direct reduction of an oxide, particular surface science reactions or nanoparticle fabrication routes. This manuscript realizes such experimental protocols upon a thermochemical reaction chamber called the ""Reacthub"" and allows for transferring treated materials under cryogenic & ultrahigh vacuum (UHV) workflow conditions for characterisation by either atom probe or scanning Xe+/electron microscopies. Two examples are discussed in the present study. One protocol was in the deuterium gas charging (25 kPa D2 at 200°C) of a high-manganese twinning-induced-plasticity (TWIP) steel and characterization of the ingress and trapping of hydrogen at various features (grain boundaries in particular) in efforts to relate this to the steel's hydrogen embrittlement susceptibility. Deuterium was successfully detected after gas charging but most contrast originated from the complex ion FeOD+ signal and the feature may be an artefact. The second example considered the direct deuterium reduction (5 kPa D2 at 700°C) of a single crystal wüstite (FeO) sample, demonstrating that under a standard thermochemical treatment causes rapid reduction upon the nanoscale. In each case, further studies are required for complete confidence about these phenomena, but these experiments successfully demonstrate that how an ex-situ thermochemical treatment can be realised that captures environmentally-sensitive transient states that can be analysed by atomic-scale by atom probe microscope."
https://openalex.org/W4226062900,"Intestinal barrier dysfunction plays a critical role in the pathophysiology of many diseases including severe acute pancreatitis (SAP). Interleukin-22 (IL-22) is a critical regulator of intestinal epithelial homeostasis. However, the mechanism, origin site, and characteristics of IL-22 in the intestinal barrier dysfunction remains elusive. Studies were conducted in patients with SAP and SAP mice model. SAP mice model was induced by intraductal infusion of 5% taurocholic acid. The level and source of IL-22 were analyzed by flow cytometry. The effect of IL-22 in SAP-associated intestinal injury were examined through knockout of IL-22 (IL-22-/- ) or administration of recombinant IL-22 (rIL-22). IL-22 increased in the early phase of SAP but declined more quickly than that of proinflammatory cytokines, such as IL-6 and TNF-α. CD177+ neutrophils contributed to IL-22 expression in SAP. IL-22 was activated in the colon rather than the small intestine during SAP. Deletion of IL-22 worse the severity of colonic injury, whereas administration of rIL-22 reduced colonic injury. Mechanistically, IL-22 ameliorates the intestinal barrier dysfunction in SAP through decreasing colonic mucosal permeability, upregulation of E-cadherin and ZO-1 expression, activation of pSTAT3/Reg3 pathway and restoration of fecal microbiota abundance. This study revealing that early decreased colonic IL-22 aggravates intestinal mucosal barrier dysfunction and microbiota dysbiosis in SAP. Colonic IL-22 is likely a promising treating target in the early phase of SAP management. Research in context Evidence before this study Intestinal barrier dysfunction plays a critical role in the pathophysiology of severe acute pancreatitis (SAP). Interleukin-22 (IL-22) is a critical regulator of intestinal epithelial homeostasis. However, the mechanism, origin site and characteristics of IL-22 in the intestinal barrier dysfunction remains elusive. Added value of this study Firstly, we determined the dynamic expression profile of IL-22 in SAP and found that IL-22 was mostly activated in the pancreas and colon and decreased earlier than proinflammatory cytokines. CD177+ neutrophils contributed to IL-22 expression in SAP. Furthermore, we found that IL-22 ameliorates intestinal barrier dysfunction in SAP through decreasing colonic mucosal permeability, upregulation of E-cadherin and ZO-1 expression, activation of pSTAT3/Reg3 pathway and restoration of fecal microbiota abundance. Implications of all the available evidence This study highlights the role of colonic injury and colonic IL-22 in SAP. IL-22 is likely a promising treating target in the early phase of SAP management."

To evaluate the pollution characteristics of heavy metals in the sediments of the Chishui River Basin, in the present study, the concentrations of five heavy metals in surface sediments of the Chishui River Basin in China were investigated using the geo-accumulation index, pollution load index, and potential ecological risk indexes. These indexes evaluated the degree of contamination and the influence of human activities on heavy metal levels in the basin. Cu, Zn, Cd, Hg, and As were found at concentrations of 5.12–120.40, 36.01–219.31, 0.03–1.28, 0.01–1.18, and 1.56–11.59 mg kg –1 , respectively, with mean values of 37.43, 91.92, 0.25, 0.07, and 5.16 mg kg –1 , respectively, in the order Zn &gt; Cu &gt; As &gt; Cd &gt; Hg. The contamination indices revealed Hg as the principal pollutant based on the spatial distribution, while Pearson’s correlation coefficients suggested that Cu, Zn, and As originated from a similar source. Hg had a different source from the other metals, whereas Cd originated from a different source compared with that of Zn, As, and Hg. This paper showed a Hg and Cd contamination in the Chishui River Basin."
https://openalex.org/W4220675332,"Oncogene activation, massive proliferation, and increased nutrient demands often result in nutrient and oxygen deprivation in solid tumors including breast cancer (BC), leading to the induction of oxidative stress and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, and subsequently triggering integrated stress response (ISR). To elucidate the role of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) in the ISR of BC, we performed transcriptome analyses and identified a lncRNA, UBA6-AS1, which was upregulated upon amino acid deprivation and ER stress. UBA6-AS1 was preferentially induced in triple-negative BC (TNBC) cells deprived of arginine or glutamine, two critical amino acids required for cancer cell growth, or treated with ER stress inducers. Mechanistically, UBA6-AS1 was regulated through the GCN2/eIF2α/ATF4 pathway, one of the major routes mediating ISR in amino acid sensing. In addition, both in vitro and in vivo assays indicated that UBA6-AS1 promoted TNBC cell survival when cells encountered metabolic stress, implicating a regulatory role of UBA6-AS1 in response to intratumoral metabolic stress during tumor progression. Moreover, PARP1 expression and activity were positively regulated by the GCN2/UBA6-AS1 axis upon amino acid deprivation. In conclusion, our data suggest that UBA6-AS1 is a novel lncRNA regulating ISR upon metabolic stress induction to promote TNBC cell survival. Furthermore, the GCN2-ATF4 axis is important for UBA6-AS1 induction to enhance PARP1 activity and could serve as a marker for the susceptibility of PARP inhibitors in TNBC."
https://openalex.org/W3113216365,"Fitting Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) models to incidence data is problematic when not all infected individuals are reported. Assuming an underlying SIR model with general but known distribution for the time to recovery, this paper derives the implied differential-integral equations for observed incidence data when a fixed fraction of newly infected individuals are not observed. The parameters of the resulting system of differential equations are identifiable. Using these differential equations, we develop a stochastic model for the conditional distribution of current disease incidence given the entire past history of reported cases. We estimate the model parameters using Bayesian Markov Chain Monte-Carlo sampling of the posterior distribution. We use our model to estimate the transmission rate and fraction of asymptomatic individuals for the current Coronavirus 2019 outbreak in eight American Countries: the United States of America, Brazil, Mexico, Argentina, Chile, Colombia, Peru, and Panama, from January 2020 to May 2021. Our analysis reveals that the fraction of reported cases varies across all countries. For example, the reported incidence fraction for the United States of America varies from 0.3 to 0.6, while for Brazil it varies from 0.2 to 0.4."
https://openalex.org/W4210823042,"There is an urgent need for better diagnostic and analytical methods for vaccine research and infection control in virology. This has been highlighted by recently emerging viral epidemics and pandemics (Zika, SARS-CoV-2), and recurring viral outbreaks like the yellow fever outbreaks in Angola and the Democratic Republic of Congo (2016) and in Brazil (2016-2018). Current assays to determine neutralising activity against viral infections in sera are costly in time and equipment and suffer from high variability. Therefore, both basic infection research and diagnostic population screenings would benefit from improved methods to determine virus-neutralising activity in patient samples. Here we describe a robust, objective, and scalable Fluorescence Reduction Neutralisation Test (FluoRNT) for yellow fever virus, relying on flow cytometric detection of cells infected with a fluorescent Venus reporter containing variant of the yellow fever vaccine strain 17D (YF-17D-Venus). It accurately measures neutralising antibody titres in human serum samples within as little as 24 h. Samples from 32 vaccinees immunised with YF-17D were tested for neutralising activity by both a conventional focus reduction neutralisation test (FRNT) and FluoRNT. Both types of tests proved to be equally reliable for the detection of neutralising activity, however, FluoRNT is significantly more precise and reproducible with a greater dynamic range than conventional FRNT. The FluoRNT assay protocol is substantially faster, easier to control, and cheaper in per-assay costs. FluoRNT additionally reduces handling time minimising exposure of personnel to patient samples. FluoRNT thus brings a range of desirable features that can accelerate and standardise the measurement of neutralising anti-yellow fever virus antibodies. It could be used in applications ranging from vaccine testing to large cohort studies in systems virology and vaccinology. We also anticipate the potential to translate the methodology and analysis of FluoRNT to other flaviviruses such as West Nile, Dengue and Zika or to RNA viruses more generally."
https://openalex.org/W4210915005,"Mistreatment, discrimination, and poor psycho-social support during childbirth at health facilities are common in lower- and middle-income countries. Despite a policy directive from the World Health Organisation (WHO), no operational model exists that effectively demonstrates incorporation of these guidelines in routine facility-based maternity services. This early-phase implementation research aims to develop, implement, and test the feasibility of a service-delivery strategy to promote the culture of supportive and dignified maternity care (SDMC) at public health facilities.Guided by human-centred design approach, the implementation of this study will be divided into two phases: development of intervention, and implementing and testing feasibility. The service-delivery intervention will be co-created along with relevant stakeholders and informed by contextual evidence that is generated through formative research. It will include capacity-building of maternity teams, and the improvement of governance and accountability mechanisms within public health facilities. The technical content will be primarily based on WHO's intrapartum care guidelines and mental health Gap Action Programme (mhGAP) materials. A mixed-method, pre-post design will be used for feasibility assessment. The intervention will be implemented at six secondary-level healthcare facilities in two districts of southern Sindh, Pakistan. Data from multiple sources will be collected before, during and after the implementation of the intervention. We will assess the coverage of the intervention, challenges faced, and changes in maternity teams' understanding and attitude towards SDMC. Additionally, women's maternity experiences and psycho-social well-being-will inform the success of the intervention.Evidence from this implementation research will enhance understanding of health systems challenges and opportunities around SDMC. A key output from this research will be the SDMC service-delivery package, comprising a comprehensive training package (on inclusive, supportive and dignified maternity care) and a field tested strategy to ensure implementation of recommended practices in routine, facility-based maternity care. Adaptation, Implementation and evaluation of SDMC package in diverse setting will be way forward. The study has been registered with clinicaltrials.gov (Registration number: NCT05146518)."
https://openalex.org/W4210926821,"Pediatric Emergency Department (ED) utilization in the U.S. saw large declines during the COVID19 pandemic. What is relatively unexplored is whether the extent of declines differed by race and insurance status. An observational study was conducted using electronic medical record (EMR) data from the largest pediatric ED in Alabama for 2020 and 2019. The four subgroups of interest were African-American (AA), Non-Hispanic White (NHW), privately insured (PRIVATE), and publicly insured or self-insured (PUBLIC-SELF). Percentage changes in the 7-day moving average between dates in 2020 and 2019 were computed for total and high-severity ED visits by subgroup. Trends in percentage changes were plotted. T-tests were used to compare mean changes between subgroups. Large percentage declines in total ED visits and somewhat smaller percentage declines in high-severity visits were observed from March 2020. Declines were consistently larger for AA than NHW and for PUBLIC-SELF than PRIVATE. T-test results indicated mean date-specific percentage declines were significantly larger for AA than NHW for total visits (-38.92% [95% CI: -41.1, -36.8] versus -29.11% [95% CI: -30.8, -27.4]; p<0.001) and high-severity visits (-24.31% [95% CI: -26.2, -22.4] versus -19.49% [95% CI:-21.2, -17.8]; p<0.001), and larger for PUBLIC-SELF than PRIVATE for total visits (-36.32% [95% CI:-38.4, -34.3] versus 27.63% [95% CI:-29.2, -26.0]; p<0.001) and high-severity visits (-21.72% [95% CI: -23.5, -19.9] versus -20.01% [95% CI: -21.7, -18.3]; p = 0.04). In conclusion, significant differences by race and insurance status were observed in the decline in ED visits during the COVID19 pandemic, including high-severity visits. Minority-race and publicly insured or self-insured children often depend on the ED for health needs, lacking a usual source of care. Thus, these findings have worrisome implications regarding unmet healthcare needs and future exacerbations in health disparities."
https://openalex.org/W4210823816,"Bronchiectasis is a chronic respiratory disease characterised by airways widening and recurrent infections, resulting in episodes of chronic cough, sputum expectoration, and dyspnoea. This leads to deterioration in daily function, repeated hospital admissions and poor quality of life. The prevalence and mortality related to bronchiectasis is increasing worldwide with growing economic burden on healthcare systems. Physiotherapy for bronchiectasis aims to decrease accumulation of sputum, dyspnoea, and improve exercise capacity and daily function. A robust evidence base to support physiotherapy in bronchiectasis is currently lacking. This is partly because of inconsistency and poor reporting of outcomes in available studies. A core outcome set is the minimum acceptable group of outcomes that should be used in clinical trials for a specific condition. This decreases research waste by improving consistency and reporting of key outcomes and facilitates the synthesis of study outcomes in systematic reviews and guidelines. The aim of the study is therefore to develop a core outcome set and outcome measurement set for physiotherapy research in adults with bronchiectasis. This will ensure outcomes important to key stakeholders are consistently used and reported in future research.This project will use the COMET Initiative and COSMIN guidelines of core outcome set development and will include three phases. In the first phase, a comprehensive list of outcomes will be developed using systematic review of reported outcomes and qualitative interviews with patients and physiotherapists. Then consensus on key outcomes will be established in phase two using a Delphi survey and a consensus meeting. Finally, in phase three, we will identify appropriate instruments to measure the core outcomes by evaluating the psychometric properties of available instruments and a stakeholders' meeting to establish consensus.The study was reviewed and has received ethical approval from the health-related Research Ethics Committee- Edge Hill University (ETH2021-0217).This study is registered with the COMET database. https://www.comet-initiative.org/Studies/Details/1931.

https://openalex.org/W4210874173,"Since the SARS-CoV-2 infection was identified in December 2019, SARS-CoV-2 infection has rapidly spread worldwide and has become a significant pandemic disease. In addition, human death and serious health problem caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection, the socio-economic impact has been very serious. Here, we describe the development of the viral vector vaccine, which is the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2 expressed on the surface of Newcastle disease virus (LVP-K1-RBD19). The RBD protein concentrations on the viral surface were measured by the sandwich ELISA method. 106.7 TCID50/ml of LVP-K1-RBD19 has a 0.17 μg of RBD protein. Optical density (OD) values of mouse sera inoculated with 10 μg of RBD protein expressed on the surface of LVP-K1-RBD19 generated 1.78-fold higher RBD-specific antibody titers than mice inoculated with 10 μg RBD protein with alum at 28 dpi. Moreover, mice inoculated with 10 μg of RBD protein expressed on the surface of LVP-K1-RBD19 virus showed more than 80% neutralization at 1:256 against the SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus. These results demonstrated that inactivated LVP-K1-RBD19 virus produces neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 in a short period and could be elect protective immunity in humans and LVP-K1-RBD19 will be a good candidate for the COVID-19 vaccine."
https://openalex.org/W4210929514,"Sudden emergence and rapid spread of COVID-19 created an inevitable need for expansion of the COVID-19 laboratory testing network across the world. The strategy to test-track-treat was advocated for quick detection and containment of the disease. Being the second most populous country in the world, India was challenged to make COVID-19 testing available and accessible in all parts of the country. The molecular laboratory testing network was augmented expeditiously, and number of laboratories was increased from one in January 2020 to 2951 till mid-September, 2021. This rapid expansion warranted the need to have inbuilt systems of quality control/ quality assurance. In addition to the ongoing inter-laboratory quality control (ILQC), India implemented an External Quality Assurance Program (EQAP) with assistance from World Health Organization (WHO) and Royal College of Pathologists, Australasia. Out of the 953 open system rRTPCR laboratories in both public and private sector who participated in the first round of EQAP, 891(93.4%) laboratories obtained a passing score of > = 80%. The satisfactory performance of Indian COVID-19 testing laboratories has boosted the confidence of the public and policy makers in the quality of testing. ILQC and EQAP need to continue to ensure adherence of the testing laboratories to the desired quality standards."
https://openalex.org/W4210834287,"It has previously been shown that readers spend a great deal of time skim reading on the Web and that this type of reading can affect comprehension of text. Across two experiments, we examine how hyperlinks influence perceived importance of sentences and how perceived importance in turn affects reading behaviour. In Experiment 1, participants rated the importance of sentences across passages of Wikipedia text. In Experiment 2, a different set of participants read these passages while their eye movements were tracked, with the task being either reading for comprehension or skim reading. Reading times of sentences were analysed in relation to the type of task and the importance ratings from Experiment 1. Results from Experiment 1 show readers rated sentences without hyperlinks as being of less importance than sentences that did feature hyperlinks, and this effect is larger when sentences are lower on the page. It was also found that short sentences with more links were rated as more important, but only when they were presented at the top of the page. Long sentences with more links were rated as more important regardless of their position on the page. In Experiment 2, higher importance scores resulted in longer sentence reading times, measured as fixation durations. When skim reading, however, importance ratings had a lesser impact on online reading behaviour than when reading for comprehension. We suggest readers are less able to establish the importance of a sentence when skim reading, even though importance could have been assessed by information that would be fairly easy to extract (i.e. presence of hyperlinks, length of sentences, and position on the screen)."
https://openalex.org/W4210934646,"Childhood stunting remains a major public health issue in many low- and middle-income countries. In Ghana, the progress made is insufficient to reach the targets set by the 2025 World Health Assembly and the 2030 United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. Although studies have examined the socio-demographic determinants of childhood stunting, there has not been any systematic study to examine the spatial associative effects of the socio-demographic and socio-ecological factors at the district level, where health programmes are implemented and monitored. Bayesian geo-additive semiparametric regression technique was used to analyse five conservative rounds of Demographic and Health Surveys in Ghana, with socio-ecological covariates derived from the Demographic and Health Survey Program Geospatial Covariate datasets to examine the temporal trends in childhood stunting, the extent of geospatial clustering at the district level and their associative relationships with socio-demographic and socio-ecological factors. The findings show that childhood stunting in Ghana is not spatially randomly distributed but clustered. Clustering of high childhood stunting was observed amongst districts in the Upper West, Upper East, Northern, North East, Savannah, and Western North regions, whilst clustering of low childhood stunting was observed in districts in the Greater Accra, Volta, Bono and the Eastern regions. Whist socio-demographic factors were predominantly associated with clustering of districts with high childhood stunting, the socio-ecological factors were mainly associated with clustering of districts with low childhood stunting. The socio-ecological factors identified to have a nonlinear associative effect with childhood stunting were Insecticide Treated Net (ITN) coverage, nightlight composite, travel time to a main settlement and population density. The findings suggest that targeted interventions at the district level are essential to reducing childhood stunting in Ghana."
https://openalex.org/W4210938135,"Mechanisms promoting coexistence between closely related species are fundamental for maintaining species diversity. Mechanisms of niche differentiation include allochrony which offsets the peak timing of resource utilisation between species. Many studies focus on spatial and temporal niche partitioning during the breeding season, few have investigated the role allochrony plays in influencing interspecific segregation of foraging distribution and ecology between congeneric species during the non-breeding season. We investigated the non-breeding migrations of Snares (Eudyptes robustus) and Fiordland penguins (Eudyptes pachyrhynchus), closely related species breeding between 100-350 km apart whose migration phenology differs by two months. Using light geolocation tracking, we examined the degree of overlap given the observed allochrony and a hypothetical scenario where the species commence migration simultaneously. We found that Fiordland penguins migrated to the Sub-Antarctic Frontal Zone and Polar Frontal Zone in the austral autumn whereas Snares penguins disperse westwards staying north of the Sub-Tropical Front in the austral winter. Our results suggest that allochrony is likely to be at the root of segregation because the relative profitability of the different water masses that the penguins forage in changes seasonally which results in the two species utilising different areas over their core non-breeding periods. Furthermore, allochrony reduces relatively higher levels of spatiotemporal overlap during the departure and arrival periods, when the close proximity of the two species' colonies would cause the birds to congregate in similar areas, resulting in high interspecific competition just before the breeding season. Available evidence from other studies suggests that the shift in phenology between these species has arisen from adaptive radiation and phenological matching to the seasonality of local resource availability during the breeding season and reduced competitive overlap over the non-breeding season is likely to be an incidental outcome."
https://openalex.org/W4221017194,"Parathyroid hormone (PTH) signaling downstream of the PTH 1 receptor (Pth1r) results in both bone anabolic and catabolic actions by mechanisms not yet fully understood. In this study, we show that Pth1r signaling upregulates the expression of several components of the Notch pathway and that Notch signals contribute to the catabolic actions of PTH in bone. We found that constitutive genetic activation of PTH receptor signaling in osteocytes (caPth1rOt) or treatment with PTH daily increased the expression of several Notch ligands/receptors in bone. In contrast, sustained elevation of endogenous PTH did not change Notch components expression. Deletion of the PTH receptor or sclerostin overexpression in osteocytes abolished Notch increases by PTH. Further, deleting the canonical Notch transcription factor Rbpjk in osteocytes decreased bone mass and increased resorption and Rankl expression in caPth1rOt mice. Moreover, pharmacological bone-targeted Notch inhibition potentiated the bone mass gain induced by intermittent PTH by reducing bone resorption and preserving bone formation. Thus, Notch activation lies downstream of anabolic signaling driven by PTH actions in osteocytes, and Notch pharmacological inhibition maximizes the bone anabolic effects of PTH."

Our study evaluated the cardiometabolic outcomes in women with prior HFDP versus women without HFDP 3-6 years post-partum in urban South Africa.A prospective cohort study was performed of 103 black African women with prior HFDP and 101 without HFDP, 3-6 years post-partum at Chris Hani Baragwanath Academic Hospital, Soweto. Index pregnancy data was obtained from medical records. Post-partum, participants were re-evaluated for anthropometric measurements, body composition utilizing dual energy X-ray absorptiometry(DXA) and biochemical analysis (two-hour 75gm OGTT fasting insulin, lipids, creatinine levels and glucose levels). Cardiovascular risk was assessed by Framingham risk score(FRS). Carotid intima media thickness(cIMT) was used as a surrogate marker for subclinical atherosclerosis. Factors associated with progression to cardiometabolic outcomes were assessed using multivariable logistic and linear regression models.Forty-six(45.1%) HFDP women progressed to diabetes compared to 5(4.9%) in non HFDP group(p<0.001); only 20(43.4%) were aware of their diabetic status in the whole group. The odds(OR, 95% confidence interval(CI)) of progressing to type 2 diabetes(T2DM) and metabolic syndrome(MetS) after correcting for confounders in the HFDP group was 10.5(95% CI 3.7-29.5) and 6.3(95%CI 2.2-18.1), respectively. All visceral fat indices were found to be significantly higher in the HFDP group after adjusting for baseline body mass index. Ten-year estimated cardiovascular risk(FRS) and mean cIMT was statistically higher in the HFDP group(8.46 IQR 4.9-14.4; 0.48 mm IQR 0.44-0.53 respectively) compared to the non-HFDP group(3.48 IQR 2.1-5.7; 0.46mm IQR 0.42-0.50) respectively and this remained significant for FRS but was attenuated for cIMT after correcting for confounders. HIV did not play a role in progression to any of these outcomes.Women with a history of HFDP have a higher risk of cardiometabolic conditions within 6 years post-partum in an urban sub-Saharan African setting."
https://openalex.org/W4226103155,"Incomplete vaccine uptake and limited vaccine availability for some segments of the population could lead policymakers to consider re-imposing restrictions to help reduce fatalities. Early in the pandemic, full business shutdowns were commonplace. Given this response, much of the literature on policy effectiveness has focused on full closures and their impact. But were complete closures necessary? Using a hand-collected database of partial business closures for all U.S. counties from March through December 2020, we examine the impact of capacity restrictions on COVID-19 fatality growth. For the restaurant and bar sector, we find that several combinations of partial capacity restrictions are as effective as full shutdowns. For example, point estimates indicate that, for the average county, limiting restaurants and bars to 25% of capacity reduces the fatality growth rate six weeks ahead by approximately 43%, while completely closing them reduces fatality growth by about 16%. The evidence is more mixed for the other sectors that we study. We find that full gym closures reduce the COVID-19 fatality growth rate, while partial closures may be counterproductive relative to leaving capacity unrestricted. Retail closures are ineffective, but 50% capacity limits reduce fatality growth. We find that restricting salons, other personal services and movie theaters is either ineffective or counterproductive."

However, the perspectives of players are often neglected, such as whether they see them as 'fair' game elements and how closely they feel this aligns with gambling. In this paper, we synthesise a conceptualisation for loot boxes through players' actual experience and explore if there are any parallels with gambling. Twenty-one participants who played video games took part in the research through either an interview or online survey. Thematic analysis suggested that six themes were core to exploring loot boxes: Random Chance Effects, Attitudes Towards Content, Implementation, Parallels with Gambling, Game Design, and The Player. The results suggested both indirect and direct parallels with gambling from the players experiences. Implications of game design and classifying loot boxes as gambling are discussed in relation to game design and risk factors of gambling and purchasing behaviour."
https://openalex.org/W4210869489,"Newcastle Disease Virus (NDV) is an avian RNA virus, which was shown to be effective and safe for use in oncolytic viral therapy for several tumour malignancies. The presence of a multi basic cleavage site (MBCS) in the fusion protein improved its oncolytic efficacy in vitro and in vivo. However, NDV with a MBCS can be virulent in poultry. We aimed to develop an NDV with a MBCS but with reduced virulence for poultry while remaining effective in killing human tumour cells. To this end, the open reading frame of the V protein, an avian specific type I interferon antagonist, was disrupted by introducing multiple mutations. NDV with a mutated V gene was attenuated in avian cells and chicken and duck eggs. Although this virus still killed tumour cells, the efficacy was reduced compared to the virulent NDV. Introduction of various mutations in the fusion (F) and hemagglutinin-neuraminidase (HN) genes slightly improved this efficacy. Taken together, these data demonstrated that NDV with a MBCS but with abrogation of the V protein ORF and mutations in the F and HN genes can be safe for evaluation in oncolytic viral therapy."
https://openalex.org/W4210880037,"Many skin diseases show circular red lesions on the skin, called erythema. Erythema is characterized by the expansion of its circular area solely from local stimulation. A pathological inflammatory response caused by the stimulation persistently increases inflammatory mediators in the dermis, whereas a normal inflammatory response transiently increases mediators, resulting in the shrinkage of the erythema. Although the diffusion of mediators theoretically reproduces the expansion, how the inflammatory response expands or shrinks the erythema remains unknown. A possibility is positive feedback, which affects mediator production and can generate two distinct stable states (i.e., inflamed and noninflamed), referred to as bistability. Bistability causes a state transition either from the noninflamed to inflamed state or the reverse direction by suprathreshold stimulation. Additionally, the diffusion selectively causes state transition in either direction, resulting in spatial spread of the transited state, known as the traveling wave. Therefore, we hypothesize that the traveling wave of the inflammatory response can account for both the expansion and shrinkage. Using a reaction-diffusion model with bistability, we theoretically show a possible mechanism in which the circular inflamed area expands via the traveling wave from the noninflamed to the inflamed state. During the expansion, the boundary between the inflamed and noninflamed areas moves at a constant velocity while maintaining its concentration gradient. Moreover, when the positive feedback is weak, the traveling wave selectively occurs from the inflamed to noninflamed state, shrinking the inflamed area. Whether the inflamed area expands or shrinks is mainly controlled by the balance of mediator concentration between the noninflamed and inflamed states, relative to the threshold. The traveling wave of the inflammatory response provides an experimentally testable framework for erythema expansion and shrinkage, thereby contributing to the development of effective treatments, including probiotics."

Methodology We undertook a case-control study age-matched to ±5years in 2018 at Muhimbili National Hospital. The study recruited 105 BC patients and 190 controls giving it 80% power to detect an odds ratio of ≥2 at the alpha error of &lt;5% for exposure with a prevalence of 30% in the control group with 95% confidence. Controls were recruited from in patients being treated for non-cancer related conditions. Information regarding hormonal, reproductive, nutritional and lifestyle risk for breast cancer and demography was collected by interviews using a predefined data set. Conditional multinomial logistic regression used to determine the adjusted odds ratio for variables that had significant p-value in the binomial logistic regression model with 5% allowed error at 95% confidence interval. Results The study recruited 105 cases and 190 controls. Only old age at menopause had a significant risk, a 2.6 fold increase. Adolescent obesity, family history of breast cancer, cigarette smoking and alcohol intake had increased odds for breast cancer but failed to reach significant levels. The rural residency had 61% reduced odds for developing breast cancer though it failed to reach significant levels. Conclusion Older age at menopause is a significant risk factor for the development of breast cancer among Tanzanian women. This study has shed light on the potential role of modifiable risk factors for breast cancer which need to be studied further for appropriate preventive strategies in similar settings."

Although many covalent and noncovalent inhibitors have been designed to inhibit this molecular target, none have gained FDA approval as a drug. Because of the high rate of COVID-19 pandemic development, in addition to laboratory research, we require in silico methods to accelerate rational drug design. The unbinding pathways of two SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro noncovalent inhibitors with the PDB IDs: 3V3M, 4MDS, 6W63, 5RF7 were explored from a comparative perspective using unbiased molecular dynamics (UMD) simulations. We uncovered common weak points for selected inhibitors that could not interact significantly with a binding pocket at specific residues by all their fragments. So water molecules entered the free binding S regions and weakened protein-inhibitor fundamental interactions gradually. N142, G143, and H163 are the essential residues, which cause key protein-ligand interactions in the binding pocket. We believe that these results will help design new potent inhibitors against SARS-CoV-2."
https://openalex.org/W4210823448,"Insects change their stimulus-response through the perception of associating these stimuli with important survival events such as rewards, threats, and mates. Insects develop strong associations and relate them to their experiences through several behavioral procedures. Among the insects, Apis species, Apis mellifera ligustica are known for their outstanding ability to learn with tremendous economic importance. Apis mellifera ligustica has a strong cognitive ability and promising model species for investigating the neurobiological basis of remarkable olfactory learning abilities. Here we evaluated the olfactory learning ability of A. mellifera by using the proboscis extension reflex (PER) protocol. The brains of the learner and failed-learner bees were examined for comparative transcriptome analysis by RNA-Seq to explain the difference in the learning capacity. In this study, we used an appetitive olfactory learning paradigm in the same age of A. mellifera bees to examine the differential gene expression in the brain of the learner and failed-learner. Bees that respond in 2nd and 3rd trials or only responded to 3rd trials were defined as learned bees, failed-learner individuals were those bees that did not respond in all learning trials The results indicate that the learning ability of learner bees was significantly higher than failed-learner bees for 12 days. We obtained approximately 46.7 and 46.4 million clean reads from the learner bees failed-learner bees, respectively. Gene expression profile between learners' bees and failed-learners bees identified 74 differentially expressed genes, 57 genes up-regulated in the brains of learners and 17 genes were down-regulated in the brains of the bees that fail to learn. The qRT-PCR validated the differently expressed genes. Transcriptome analyses revealed that specific genes in learner and failed-learner bees either down-regulated or up-regulated play a crucial role in brain development and learning behavior. Our finding suggests that down-regulated genes of the brain involved in the integumentary system, storage proteins, brain development, sensory processing, and neurodegenerative disorder may result in reduced olfactory discrimination and olfactory sensitivity in failed-learner bees. This study aims to contribute to a better understanding of the olfactory learning behavior and gene expression information, which opens the door for understanding of the molecular mechanism of olfactory learning behavior in honeybees."
https://openalex.org/W4210860844,"In case of early pregnancy loss (EPL) women can either choose for expectant, medical or surgical management. One week of expectant management is known to lead to spontaneous abortion in approximately 50% of women. Medical treatment with misoprostol is known to be safe and less costly than surgical management, however less effective in reaching complete evacuation of the uterus. Recently, a number of trials showed that prompt treatment with the sequential combination of mifepristone with misoprostol is superior to misoprostol alone in reaching complete evacuation. In this analysis we evaluate whether the sequential combination of mifepristone with misoprostol is cost-effective compared to misoprostol alone, in the treatment of EPL.A cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA) from a healthcare perspective was performed alongside a randomised controlled trial (RCT) in which standard treatment with misoprostol only was compared with a combination of mifepristone and misoprostol, in women with EPL after a minimum of one week of unsuccessful management. A limited societal perspective scenario was added. This RCT, the Triple M trial, was a multicentre, randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial executed at 17 hospitals in the Netherlands. The trial started on June 27th 2018, and ended prematurely in January 2020 due to highly significant outcomes from the predefined interim-analysis. We included 351 women with a diagnosis of EPL between 6 and 14 weeks gestation after at least one week of unsuccessful expectant management. They were randomized between double blinded pre-treatment with oral mifepristone 600mg (N = 175) or placebo (N = 176) taken on day one, both followed by misoprostol orally. In both groups, an intention-to-treat analysis was performed for 172 patients, showing a significant difference in success rates between participants treated with mifepristone and misoprostol versus those treated with misoprostol alone (79.1% vs 58.7% respectively). In this cost-effective analysis we measured the direct, medical costs related to treatment (planned and unplanned hospital visits, medication, additional treatment) and indirect costs based on the IMTA Productivity Cost Questionnaire (iPCQ). Quality Adjusted Life Years (QALY's) were calculated from participants' scores on the SF-36 questionnaires sent digitally at treatment start, and one, two and six weeks later. We found medical treatment with placebo followed by misoprostol to be 26% more expensive compared to mifepristone followed by misoprostol (p = 0.001). Mean average medical costs per patient were significantly lower in the mifepristone group compared to the placebo group (€528.95 ± 328.93 vs €663.77 ± 456.03, respectively; absolute difference €134.82, 95% CI 50,46-219,18, p = 0.002). Both indirect costs and QALY's were similar between both groups.The sequential combination of mifepristone with misoprostol is cost-effective compared with misoprostol alone, for treatment of EPL after a minimum of one week of unsuccessful expectant management."

The prevalence of common mental disorders such as depression and anxiety in the general population of Nigeria is comparatively low. Prevalence data of mental disorders in slum settings in Nigeria is sparse. There is a need to better understand the relationship between protective factors and the occurrence of common mental disorders in the Nigerian slum context. This study aimed to describe the relationship between protective factors and the occurrence of common mental disorders among female urban slum dwellers in Ibadan, Nigeria.A cross sectional household survey of 550 women was conducted in slum settlements in Ibadan, Nigeria. Interviewer administered questionnaires were completed to elicit information on protective factors (social connectedness, self-esteem, social support, resilience) and common mental disorders (depression, anxiety and stress). The DASS-21 was used to measure common mental disorders and protective factors were measured using the Social Connectedness Scale, Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support, Resilience scale and the Rosenberg Self Esteem Scale. A multivariable logistic regression model was employed to examine associations while adjusting for relevant confounders. Common mental disorders were reported by 14.0% of the respondents. Resilience and social support were found to be protective against reporting symptoms of common mental disorders. Women who reported higher levels of social support and resilience were less likely to report common mental disorders (OR:0.96, 95% CI 0.93, 0.98) and (OR:0.95, 95% CI 0.91, 0.99) respectively. Women who were 65 years and older were also less likely to report the occurrence of common mental disorders (OR:0.38, 95% CI 0.15, 0.98) compared to those aged 18-34 years.Social support and resilience appear to be protective against common mental disorders among these respondents. Further research should be conducted to explore the pathways through which protective factors reduce the likelihood of the occurrence of common mental disorders. This would be important in the development of mental health interventions."
https://openalex.org/W4210911909,"Teaching assistants (TAs) often lead courses using curricula they did not design. Therefore, examining how curriculum and professional development (PD) interact to influence TAs’ teaching practices is critical. This study describes the effects of a curriculum and PD intervention in two contexts: when TAs are teaching curriculum that is explicitly linked to PD, and when teaching curriculum that is not linked to PD. The Intervention curriculum featured structured opportunities for reform-oriented teaching practices. The Intervention PD was situated in the context of these specific curriculum activities and modelled the desired teaching practices. TAs that participated in the intervention implemented more student-centered teaching practices than TAs that did not participate in the intervention, even when teaching curriculum that was not designed to be student-centered and was not linked to PD. A linear model of TAs’ teaching practices that included PD type, task cognitive demand and curriculum type indicates that cognitive demand has the largest relationship with teaching practices, followed by PD type. These results have implications for policy. They suggest that investment in curriculum-linked TA PD can be effective even when teaching curricula that is not linked to PD. Additionally, investment in development of higher-cognitive-demand tasks may be an effective strategy to support implementation of student-centered practices."
https://openalex.org/W4210912767,"In many parts of the world, conditions for small scale agriculture are worsening, creating challenges in achieving consistent yields. The use of automated decision support tools, such as Bayesian Belief Networks (BBNs), can assist producers to respond to these factors. This paper describes a decision support system developed to assist farmers on the Mekong Delta, Vietnam, who grow both rice and shrimp crops in the same pond, based on an existing BBN. The BBN was previously developed in collaboration with local farmers and extension officers to represent their collective perceptions and understanding of their farming system and the risks to production that they face. This BBN can be used to provide insight into the probable consequences of farming decisions, given prevailing environmental conditions, however, it does not provide direct guidance on the optimal decision given those decisions. In this paper, the BBN is analysed using a novel, temporally-inspired data mining approach to systematically determine the agricultural decisions that farmers perceive as optimal at distinct periods in the growing and harvesting cycle, given the prevailing agricultural conditions. Using a novel form of data mining that combines with visual analytics, the results of this analysis allow the farmer to input the environmental conditions in a given growing period. They then receive recommendations that represent the collective view of the expert knowledge encoded in the BBN allowing them to maximise the probability of successful crops. Encoding the results of the data mining/inspection approach into the mobile Decision Support System helps farmers access explicit recommendations from the collective local farming community as to the optimal farming decisions, given the prevailing environmental conditions."
https://openalex.org/W4210917502,"Migration has been proposed as one of the factors that shape cultural similarities across countries. However, studying the relationship between culture and migration has been challenging, in part because culture is difficult to quantify. The traditionally used survey questionnaires have a number of drawbacks, including that they are costly and difficult to scale to a large number of countries. To complement survey data, we propose the use of passively-collected digital traces from social media. We focus on food and drink as markers of a country's culture. We then measure similarities between countries in terms of food and drink interests using aggregated data from the Facebook Advertising Platform. Methodologically, we offer approaches to measure the similarity between countries with both symmetric and asymmetric indices. Substantively, we assess the association between migration cultural similarity between countries by comparing our measure of cultural similarity with international migration data. In most countries, larger immigrant populations are associated with more similar food and drink preferences between their country of origin and the country of destination. Our results suggest that immigrants contribute to bringing the culture of their home countries to new countries. Moreover, our study identifies considerable variability in this pattern across countries."
https://openalex.org/W4210939607,"Recent work on microbe-host interactions has revealed an important nexus between the environment, microbiome, and host fitness. Marine invertebrates that build carbonate skeletons are of particular interest in this regard because of predicted effects of ocean acidification on calcified organisms, and the potential of microbes to buffer these impacts. Here we investigate the role of sulfate-reducing bacteria, a group well known to affect carbonate chemistry, in Pacific oyster ( Magallana gigas ) shell formation. We reared oyster larvae to 51 days post fertilization and exposed organisms to control and sodium molybdate conditions, the latter of which is thought to inhibit bacterial sulfate reduction. Contrary to expectations, we found that sodium molybdate did not uniformly inhibit sulfate-reducing bacteria in oysters, and oysters exposed to molybdate grew larger shells over the experimental period. Additionally, we show that microbiome composition, host gene expression, and shell size were distinct between treatments earlier in ontogeny, but became more similar by the end of the experiment. Although additional testing is required to fully elucidate the mechanisms, our work provides preliminary evidence that M . gigas is capable of regulating microbiome dysbiosis caused by environmental perturbations, which is reflected in shell development."
https://openalex.org/W3016853671,"NYU School of Medicine recently embarked on a re-design of its anatomy curriculum that decreased the use of cadavers with plastinated specimens. Plastinated models provide an authentic learning experience of the human body, but lack necessary labels outlining important structures. Due to the fragile nature of the specimens, we endeavored to solve the challenge of labeling by developing a digitized supplement and archive of plastinated and pathology specimens. An interdisciplinary team of faculty and multimedia designers at NYU School of Medicine designed and developed electronic resources related to the artistic models and plastinated specimens. Over the course of three months, 60 artistic and plastinated models of different sizes were captured from dozens of angles using a digital camera or an Artec Leo Scanner. The numerous image captures of the plastinated specimens were processed in Agisoft Metashape, a stand-alone software product, that performs photogrammetric processing of digital images and generates 3D spatial data. After Agisoft Metashape exported a complex 3D mesh with a high-resolution texture, anatomy faculty added labels to the digitized 3D anatomy specimens using the Sketchfab web platform. The labeled 3D anatomy models were then uploaded into the Living Anatomy site on NYU School of Medicine’s learning management system for students to explore before, during, and after their anatomy lab sessions. Quizzes using these models also were created to help students identify the structures and link them to physiology and clinical scenarios. The digitized 3D models allow students to zoom in, rotate and explore the specimens in a more interactive way, thereby enhancing the process of just observing fragile plastination models. When asked, 84% of students reported that the 3D models of plastinated specimens contributed “very much so” to their learning of anatomical relationships. We will continue to find opportunities for the meaningful integration of these 3D models within the anatomy curriculum as well as into other pre-clerkship and clerkship modules. We will also assess the educational outcomes of the 3D models and, by doing so, will incorporate instructional design into the process."
https://openalex.org/W4210906546,"BMP7 is a morphogen capable of counteracting the OA chondrocyte hypertrophic phenotype via NKX3-2. NKX3-2 represses expression of RUNX2, an important transcription factor for chondrocyte hypertrophy. Since RUNX2 has previously been described as an inhibitor for 47S pre-rRNA transcription, we hypothesized that BMP7 positively influences 47S pre-rRNA transcription through NKX3-2, resulting in increased protein translational capacity. Therefor SW1353 cells and human primary chondrocytes were exposed to BMP7 and rRNA (18S, 5.8S, 28S) expression was determined by RT-qPCR. NKX3-2 knockdown was achieved via transfection of a NKX3-2-specific siRNA duplex. Translational capacity was assessed by the SUNsET assay, and 47S pre-rRNA transcription was determined by transfection of a 47S gene promoter-reporter plasmid. BMP7 treatment increased protein translational capacity. This was associated by increased 18S and 5.8S rRNA and NKX3-2 mRNA expression, as well as increased 47S gene promotor activity. Knockdown of NKX3-2 led to increased expression of RUNX2, accompanied by decreased 47S gene promotor activity and rRNA expression, an effect BMP7 was unable to restore. Our data demonstrate that BMP7 positively influences protein translation capacity of SW1353 cells and chondrocytes. This is likely caused by an NKX3-2-dependent activation of 47S gene promotor activity. This finding connects morphogen-mediated changes in cellular differentiation to an aspect of ribosome biogenesis via key transcription factors central to determining the chondrocyte phenotype."
https://openalex.org/W4210922815,"In the UK, it is currently recommended that owned cats be neutered from four months of age. However, its uptake is inconsistent across the veterinary profession. Here we assess the effect of a brief video intervention that aimed to encourage four month neutering, whilst preserving clinical autonomy. We compare this theory-driven approach with traditional information giving and a control group. Veterinary surgeons who regularly undertook feline neutering work in the UK but did not routinely neuter cats at four months and/or recommend four month neutering for client owned cats were randomised into three groups (n = 234). Participants received either no information, a written summary of evidence or the video. The primary behaviour outcomes were the recommending and carrying out of neutering cats at four months. Evaluative, belief and stages of change measures were also collected. Self-reported outcomes were assessed pre-intervention, immediately post-intervention, two months post-intervention and six months post-intervention. At two months, participants that had received the video intervention were significantly more likely to have started recommending neutering cats at four months. At six months, participants that had received the video intervention were significantly more likely to have started carrying out neutering cats at four months. There were no significant behaviour changes for the other groups. At two months, the video intervention was associated with a significant increase in thinking about, and speaking to colleagues about, four-month neutering, relative to the control group. The written summary of evidence had no similar effect on stages of change, despite it being perceived as a significantly more helpful resource relative to the video. To conclude, a brief one-off video intervention resulted in an increase in positive behaviours towards neutering cats at 4 months, likely mediated by the social influences of the intervention prompting the opportunity to reflect and discuss four-month neutering with colleagues."
