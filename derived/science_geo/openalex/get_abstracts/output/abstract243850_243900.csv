https://openalex.org/W2086463712,"AUSTRALIA'S lack of abundant Permian and Triassic tetrapod vertebrate fauna has long been an enigma to palaeontologists. Both labyrinthodont and reptilian remains are common in South America, Southern Africa and Madagascar, and fairly common in India, while part of a labyrinthodont mandible has recently been reported from Antarctica1. Apart from a recent find in Western Australia, and a small collection from Tasmania, the few described Australian labyrinthodonts have been isolated specimens, while a single individual from Tasmania is the only Australian pre-Jurassic reptile."

https://openalex.org/W2037521351,"Two recent communications on electromagnetism1,2 exemplify the two basic approaches to the problem. It is possible to regard E, D, H and B as labels identifying different properties which it is convenient to distinguish, and in the main this is the approach taken by Rosser1. On the other hand, it is possible to look for physical realities corresponding to each of these terms and to examine various relationships to see whether these correspond with “reality”. This is basically the approach of Stopes-Roe2."
