https://openalex.org/W3134817791,"The emergence of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has affected health-care workers’ psychological and mental health. Few studies have been conducted examining the psychological effect of COVID-19 on health-care worker psychological health in Jordan. Therefore, the present study aims to assess the respective levels of fear, anxiety, depression, stress, social support, and the associated factors, experienced by Jordanian health-care workers during the COVID-19 Pandemic. This study adopted a cross-sectional, correlational design to collect data from 365 health-care workers in Amman, Jordan, from August 16th to 23rd, 2020. Along with collecting sociodemographic characteristics, the Fear of COVID-19 Scale, the Depression, Anxiety, Stress Scale, and the Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support electronically administered to participants. The majority of the participants (69.3%) were registered nurses. The mean overall score for the Fear of COVID-19 scale was 23.64 (SD + 6.85) which again exceeded the mid-point for the total score range (21), indicating elevated level fear of the COVID-19 pandemic. Participants had displayed extremely severe depression 40%, extremely severe anxiety 60%, and 35% severely distressed. Scores for depression (21.30 ± 10.86), anxiety (20.37 ± 10.80), stress (23.33 ± 10.87) were also high. Factors determined to be associated with psychological distress were being male, married, aged 40 years and older, and having more clinical experience. Assessment of social support indicated moderate-to-high levels of perceived support for all dimensions (significant other: 5.17 ± 1.28, family: 5.03 ± 1.30, friends: 5.05 ± 1.30). Weak significant correlations were found between social support and the other study variables (r &lt; 0.22), indicating a weak association with fear, depression, anxiety, and stress, respectively. Overall, Jordanian health-care workers sample reported fear, depression, anxiety, and stress. The associated factors were being male, married, aged 40 years and older, and having more clinical experience. Regarding social support, participants primarily relied on support from their families, followed by support from friends."

https://openalex.org/W3134573919,"The coronavirus pandemic has seen a marked rise in medical disinformation across social media. A variety of claims have garnered considerable traction, including the assertion that COVID is a hoax or deliberately manufactured, that 5G frequency radiation causes coronavirus, and that the pandemic is a ruse by big pharmaceutical companies to profiteer off a vaccine. An estimated 30% of some populations subscribe some form of COVID medico-scientific conspiracy narratives, with detrimental impacts for themselves and others. Consequently, exposing the lack of veracity of these claims is of considerable importance. Previous work has demonstrated that historical medical and scientific conspiracies are highly unlikely to be sustainable. In this article, an expanded model for a hypothetical en masse COVID conspiracy is derived. Analysis suggests that even under ideal circumstances for conspirators, commonly encountered conspiratorial claims are highly unlikely to endure, and would quickly be exposed. This work also explores the spectrum of medico-scientific acceptance, motivations behind propagation of falsehoods, and the urgent need for the medical and scientific community to anticipate and counter the emergence of falsehoods."
https://openalex.org/W3133843131,"Multimorbidity, the simultaneous presence of multiple chronic conditions, is an increasing global health problem and research into its determinants is of high priority. We used baseline untargeted plasma metabolomics profiling covering >1,000 metabolites as a comprehensive readout of human physiology to characterize pathways associated with and across 27 incident noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) assessed using electronic health record hospitalization and cancer registry data from over 11,000 participants (219,415 person years). We identified 420 metabolites shared between at least 2 NCDs, representing 65.5% of all 640 significant metabolite–disease associations. We integrated baseline data on over 50 diverse clinical risk factors and characteristics to identify actionable shared pathways represented by those metabolites. Our study highlights liver and kidney function, lipid and glucose metabolism, low-grade inflammation, surrogates of gut microbial diversity and specific health-related behaviors as antecedents of common NCD multimorbidity with potential for early prevention. We integrated results into an open-access webserver ( https://omicscience.org/apps/mwasdisease/ ) to facilitate future research and meta-analyses. Untargeted metabolomics profiling coupled with analysis of electronic health records in over 11,000 participants in the EPIC-Norfolk cohort reveals shared pathways that contribute to multimorbidity of noncommunicable diseases."
https://openalex.org/W3135825807,"Learning, especially rapid learning, is critical for survival. However, learning is hard; a large number of synaptic weights must be set based on noisy, often ambiguous, sensory information. In such a high-noise regime, keeping track of probability distributions over weights is the optimal strategy. Here we hypothesize that synapses take that strategy; in essence, when they estimate weights, they include error bars. They then use that uncertainty to adjust their learning rates, with more uncertain weights having higher learning rates. We also make a second, independent, hypothesis: synapses communicate their uncertainty by linking it to variability in postsynaptic potential size, with more uncertainty leading to more variability. These two hypotheses cast synaptic plasticity as a problem of Bayesian inference, and thus provide a normative view of learning. They generalize known learning rules, offer an explanation for the large variability in the size of postsynaptic potentials and make falsifiable experimental predictions."

https://openalex.org/W3135032927,"The endometrium is a dynamic tissue that exhibits remarkable resilience to repeated episodes of differentiation, breakdown, regeneration, and remodeling. Endometrial physiology relies on a complex interplay between the stromal and epithelial compartments with the former containing a mixture of fibroblasts, vascular, and immune cells. There is evidence for rare populations of putative mesenchymal progenitor cells located in the perivascular niche of human endometrium, but the existence of an equivalent cell population in mouse is unclear. We used the Pdgfrb-BAC-eGFP transgenic reporter mouse in combination with bulk and single-cell RNA sequencing to redefine the endometrial mesenchyme. In contrast to previous reports we show that CD146 is expressed in both PDGFRβ + perivascular cells and CD31 + endothelial cells. Bulk RNAseq revealed cells in the perivascular niche which express the high levels of Pdgfrb as well as genes previously identified in pericytes and/or vascular smooth muscle cells (Acta2, Myh11, Olfr78, Cspg4, Rgs4, Rgs5, Kcnj8, and Abcc9). scRNA-seq identified five subpopulations of cells including closely related pericytes/vascular smooth muscle cells and three subpopulations of fibroblasts. All three fibroblast populations were PDGFRα+/CD34 + but were distinct in their expression of Ngfr/Spon2/Angptl7 (F1), Cxcl14/Smoc2/Rgs2 (F2), and Clec3b/Col14a1/Mmp3 (F3), with potential functions in the regulation of immune responses, response to wounding, and organization of extracellular matrix, respectively. Immunohistochemistry was used to investigate the spatial distribution of these populations revealing F1/NGFR + cells in most abundance beside epithelial cells. We provide the first definitive analysis of mesenchymal cells in the adult mouse endometrium identifying five subpopulations providing a platform for comparisons between mesenchymal cells in endometrium and other adult tissues which are prone to fibrosis."

https://openalex.org/W3134565408,"Background The World Health Organization (WHO) has pointed out that urban taxi drivers and their passengers are at higher risk of transmitting coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) due to frequent contact among many people. Facemask wearing is one of the preventive measures recommended to control the transmission of the virus. A lack of evidence of the proportion of facemask wearing among taxi drivers and associated factors in Ethiopia, including Dessie City and Kombolcha Town, hinders the design of targeted interventions to advocate for facemask use. This study was designed to address this gap. Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted among 417 taxi drivers in Dessie City and Kombolcha Town from July to August, 2020. The study participants were selected using a simple random sampling technique after proportionally allocating the sample size from the total number of taxi drivers working in Dessie City and Kombolcha Town. The data were collected by trained data collectors using a structured questionnaire and an on-the-spot observational checklist. The collected data were checked, coded and entered to EpiData version 4.6 and exported to Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) version 25.0 for data cleaning and analysis. Bivariate (Crude Odds Ratio [COR]) and multivariable (Adjusted Odds Ratio [AOR]) logistic regression analyses were employed using 95% CI (confidence interval). From bivariate logistic regression analysis, variables with p- value &lt; 0.250 were retained into multivariable logistic regression analysis. Then, from the multivariable analysis, variables with p- value &lt; 0.050 were declared as factors significantly associated with facemask wearing among taxi drivers in Dessie City and Kombolcha Town. Main findings The proportion of taxi drivers who wore a facemask was 54.68% [95%CI: 50.10–59.7%]. The majority (58.3%) of drivers were using cloth facemasks, followed by N95 facemasks (24.5%) and surgical facemasks (17.3%). Out of the total 417 taxi drivers, more than two-thirds (69.8%) of them had a good knowledge about COVID-19 and 67.6% of taxi drivers had a positive attitude towards taking precautions against transmission of COVID-19. Three-fourths (74.1%) of the taxi drivers believed that wearing a facemask could prevent COVID-19. More than half (52.5%) felt discomfort when wearing a facemask. Almost three-fourths (72.2%) of taxi drivers felt that the presence of local government pressure helped them to wear a facemask. We found that marital status [AOR = 3.14, 95%CI: 1.97–5.01], fear of the disease [AOR = 2.1, 95%CI: 1.28–3.47], belief in the effectiveness of a facemask [AOR = 5.6, 95%CI: 3.1–10.16] and feeling government pressure [AOR = 3.6, 95%CI: 2.16–6.13] were factors significantly associated with wearing a facemask. Conclusion We found that the proportion of facemask wearers among taxi drivers was relatively low in Dessie City and Kombolcha Town. In order to increase that number, government bodies should work aggressively to encourage more taxi drivers to wear a facemask. We also recommend that government and non-government organizations work very closely together to implement strategies that promote facemask use, including increasing the availability of inexpensive facemasks, and monitoring and controlling facemask use."
https://openalex.org/W3134296362,"The blood-brain barrier (BBB) is formed by brain capillary endothelial cells (BECs) supported by pericytes and astrocytes. The BBB maintains homeostasis and protects the brain against toxic substances circulating in the blood, meaning that only a few drugs can pass the BBB. Thus, for drug screening, understanding cell interactions, and pathology, in vitro BBB models have been developed using BECs from various animal sources. When comparing models of different species, differences exist especially in regards to the transendothelial electrical resistance (TEER). Thus, we compared primary mice, rat, and porcine BECs (mBECs, rBECs, and pBECs) cultured in mono- and co-culture with astrocytes, to identify species-dependent differences that could explain the variations in TEER and aid to the selection of models for future BBB studies. The BBB models based on primary mBECs, rBECs, and pBECs were evaluated and compared in regards to major BBB characteristics. The barrier integrity was evaluated by the expression of tight junction proteins and measurements of TEER and apparent permeability (Papp). Additionally, the cell size, the functionality of the P-glycoprotein (P-gp) efflux transporter, and the expression of the transferrin receptor were evaluated and compared. Expression and organization of tight junction proteins were in all three species influenced by co-culturing, supporting the findings, that TEER increases after co-culturing with astrocytes. All models had functional polarised P-gp efflux transporters and expressed the transferrin receptor. The most interesting discovery was that even though the pBECs had higher TEER than rBECs and mBECs, the Papp did not show the same variation between species, which could be explained by a significantly larger cell size of pBECs. In conclusion, our results imply that the choice of species for a given BBB study should be defined from its purpose, instead of aiming to reach the highest TEER, as the models studied here revealed similar BBB properties."
https://openalex.org/W3135257092,"Cognitive dysfunction often occurs in diabetes mellitus patients. This study aimed to investigate the efficacy of melatonin (MLT) in improving diabetes-associated cognitive decline and the underlying mechanism involved. Type 2 diabetic mice and palmitic acid (PA)-stimulated BV-2 cells were treated by MLT, and the potential mechanisms among MLT, cognition, and autophagy were explored. The results showed that type 2 diabetic mice showed obvious learning and memory impairments in the Morris water maze test compared with normal controls, which could be ameliorated by MLT treatment. Meanwhile, MLT administration significantly improved neuroinflammation and regulated microglial apoptosis. Furthermore, autophagy inhibitor 3-methyladenine (3-MA) increased the microglial inflammation and apoptosis, indicating that the treatment effect of MLT was mediated by autophagy. Lastly, MLT treatment significantly decreased the levels of toll-like receptors 4 (TLR4), phosphorylated-protein kinase B (Akt), and phosphorylated-mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR), indicating that blocking TLR4/Akt/mTOR pathway might be an underlying basis for the anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptosis effects of MLT. Collectively, our study suggested that MLT could improve learning and memory in type 2 diabetic mice by activating autophagy via the TLR4/Akt/mTOR pathway, thereby inhibiting neuroinflammation and microglial apoptosis."
https://openalex.org/W3133704349,"Evidence on the role of the arts in promoting health and wellbeing has grown over the last two decades. In the United Kingdom, studies using secondary data sources have documented temporal variations in levels of arts engagement in the population, its determinants and its mental wellbeing implications. However, arts engagement is often characterized by prioritizing “high-brow” art forms. In this article, we introduce the HEartS Survey , a tool that aims to increase the balance between inclusivity and brevity of existing arts engagement measures and to focus specifically on the connection between arts engagement and social wellbeing. We explore trends in participatory and receptive engagement with literary, visual, performing, crafts and decorative arts among 5,338 adults in the UK in 2018–2019 using summative engagement scores and cluster analysis. Regression models, adjusted for demographic, socioeconomic, health, and social covariates, examine correlations between arts engagement and psychological and social wellbeing measures. Over 97% of respondents reported engagement in one or more arts activities at least once during 2018–2019, with reading and listening to music being the most popular activities. Arts engagement grouped into three distinct clusters: 19.8% constituted “ low engagers ” whose main source of engagement was occasional reading; 44.4% constituted “ receptive consumers ” who read and listened to music frequently and engaged with popular receptive arts activities such as cinema, live music, theater, exhibitions, and museums; and 35.8% constituted “ omnivores ” who frequently engaged in almost all arts activities. In agreement with existing studies, more arts engagement was associated with higher levels of wellbeing, social connectedness, and lower odds of intense social loneliness. In contrast, we found a positive association between more arts engagement, depression, and intense emotional loneliness for the most highly engaged omnivores . We conclude that arts engagement in the population forms specific profiles with distinct characteristics and consider implications for mental and social wellbeing."
https://openalex.org/W3135658592,"Many biochemical reactions require controlled recruitment of proteins to membranes. This is largely regulated by posttranslational modifications. A frequent one is S-acylation, which consists of the addition of acyl chains and can be reversed by poorly understood acyl protein thioesterases (APTs). Using a panel of computational and experimental approaches, we dissect the mode of action of the major cellular thioesterase APT2 (LYPLA2). We show that soluble APT2 is vulnerable to proteasomal degradation, from which membrane binding protects it. Interaction with membranes requires three consecutive steps: electrostatic attraction, insertion of a hydrophobic loop and S-acylation by the palmitoyltransferases ZDHHC3 or ZDHHC7. Once bound, APT2 is predicted to deform the lipid bilayer to extract the acyl chain bound to its substrate and capture it in a hydrophobic pocket to allow hydrolysis. This molecular understanding of APT2 paves the way to understand the dynamics of APT2-mediated deacylation of substrates throughout the endomembrane system."
https://openalex.org/W3134418899,"YcaO enzymes catalyze several post-translational modifications on peptide substrates, including thioamidation, which substitutes an amide oxygen with sulfur. Most predicted thioamide-forming YcaO enzymes are encoded adjacent to TfuA, which when present, is required for thioamidation. While activation of the peptide amide backbone is well established for YcaO enzymes, the function of TfuA has remained enigmatic. Here we characterize the TfuA protein involved in methyl-coenzyme M reductase thioamidation and demonstrate that TfuA catalyzes the hydrolysis of thiocarboxylated ThiS (ThiS-COSH), a proteinaceous sulfur donor, and enhances the affinity of YcaO toward the thioamidation substrate. We also report a crystal structure of a TfuA, which displays a new protein fold. Our structural and mutational analyses of TfuA have uncovered conserved binding interfaces with YcaO and ThiS in addition to revealing a hydrolase-like active site featuring a Ser-Lys catalytic pair."
https://openalex.org/W3134749997,"Tissues typically harbor subpopulations of resident immune cells that function as rapid responders to injury and whose activation leads to induction of an adaptive immune response, playing important roles in repair and protection. Since the lens is an avascular tissue, it was presumed that it was absent of resident immune cells. Our studies now show that resident immune cells are a shared feature of the human, mouse, and chicken lens epithelium. These resident immune cells function as immediate responders to injury and rapidly populate the wound edge following mock cataract surgery to function as leader cells. Many of these resident immune cells also express MHCII providing them with antigen presenting ability to engage an adaptive immune response. We provide evidence that during development immune cells migrate on the ciliary zonules and localize among the equatorial epithelial cells of the lens adjacent to where the ciliary zonules associate with the lens capsule. These findings suggest that the vasculature-rich ciliary body is a source of lens resident immune cells. We identified a major role for these cells as rapid responders to wounding, quickly populating each wound were they can function as leaders of lens tissue repair. Our findings also show that lens resident immune cells are progenitors of myofibroblasts, which characteristically appear in response to lens cataract surgery injury, and therefore, are likely agents of lens pathologies to impair vision like fibrosis."
https://openalex.org/W3135739891,"Plant community types are influenced by topographic factors, the physical and chemical properties of soil. Therefore, the study was carried out to investigate the relationships of soil and topographic factors on the distribution of species and plant community formation of the Dega Damot district in Northwestern Ethiopia. Vegetation and environmental data were collected from 86 plots (900 m 2 ). Agglomerative hierarchical cluster analysis and redundancy analysis (RDA) with R software were used to identify plant communities and analyze the relationship between plant community types and environmental variables. Five plant community types were identified: Erica arborea-Osyris quadripartita , Discopodium penninervium-Echinops pappii , Olea europaea -Scolopia theifolia , Euphorbia abyssinica-Prunus africana , Dodonaea anguistifolia-Acokanthera schimper i. The RDA result showed that the variation of species distribution and plant community formation were significantly related to altitude, organic matter, moisture content, slope, sand, pH, EC, total nitrogen and phosphorus. Our results suggest that the variation of plant communities (Community 1, 2, 3, and 4) were closely related to environmental factors, including altitude, moisture content, OM, slope, sand, pH, EC, soil nitrogen, and phosphorus, among which altitude was the most important one. However, all the measured environmental variables are not correlated to Dodonaea anguistifolia-Acokanthera schimper i community type. Therefore, it can be concluded that some other environmental variables may influence the species composition, which is needed to be further investigated."
https://openalex.org/W3135801884,"The accurate assessment of psychopathological behaviours of adolescents and young adults is imperative. Symptom Checklist-90-Revised (SCL-90-R) is one of the most comprehensive and widely used scales addressing this purpose internationally. Interestingly, associations between the different SCL-90 symptoms and family functioning have been highlighted. Nevertheless, the scale’s factorial structure has often been challenged. To contribute in this area, this study scrutinizes the psychopathological dimensions of the Symptom Checklist-90-Revised (SCL-90-R) in a large cohort of high school students (Mean age = 16.16; SD = .911) from Greece. It addresses this aim by: a) using first order and bi-factor confirmatory factor analysis, and exploratory structural equation models and; b) investigating the factors’ associations with family functioning. A total of 2090 public Greek High School students completed the SCL-90-R and the Family Adaptability and Cohesion Scale IV (FACES-IV) covering family functioning, satisfaction and communication. Six different solutions, yielded by separate permutations of CFA, ESEM, and bifactor models, were evaluated. Based on global fit, the clarity, reliabilities and the family functioning links of the dimensions in the models, the ESEM oblique model with the theorized nine factors emerged as the optimum. This model had adequate fit, and symptom dimensions were well defined. Also six of the nine factors demonstrated external associations with family functioning, satisfaction and communication. The clinical assessment benefits of these results are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W3133731990,"Histone modifications play critical roles in DNA damage repair to safeguard genome integrity. However, how different histone modifiers coordinate to build appropriate chromatin context for DNA damage repair is largely unknown. Here, we report a novel interplay between the histone methyltransferase KMT5A and two E3 ligases RNF8 and RNF168 in establishing the histone modification status for DNA damage repair. KMT5A is a newly identified substrate of RNF8 in vitro and in vivo. In response to DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs), RNF8 promotes KMT5A recruitment onto damaged chromatin in a ubiquitination-dependent manner. RNF8-induced KMT5A ubiquitination increases the binding capacity of KMT5A to RNF168. Interestingly, KMT5A not only drives a local increase in H4K20 monomethylation at DSBs, but also promotes RNF168’s activity in catalyzing H2A ubiquitination. We proved that the interaction between the H2A acidic patch and KMT5A R188/R189 residues is critical for KMT5A-mediated regulation of H2A ubiquitination. Taken together, our results highlight a new role for KMT5A in linking H4K20 methylation and H2A ubiquitination and provide insight into the histone modification network during DNA damage repair."
https://openalex.org/W2894086521,"Insulin secretion is impaired with increasing age. In this study, we aimed to determine whether aging induces specific transcriptional changes in human islets. Laser capture microdissection was used to extract pancreatic islet tissue from 37 deceased organ donors aged 1–81 years. The transcriptomes of the extracted islets were analysed using Ion AmpliSeq sequencing. 346 genes that co-vary significantly with age were found. There was an increased transcription of genes linked to senescence, and several aspects of the cell cycle machinery were downregulated with increasing age. We detected numerous genes not linked to aging in previous studies likely because earlier studies analysed islet cells isolated by enzymatic digestion which might affect the islet transcriptome. Among the novel genes demonstrated to correlate with age, we found an upregulation of SPP1 encoding osteopontin. In beta cells, osteopontin has been seen to be protective against both cytotoxicity and hyperglycaemia. In summary, we present a transcriptional profile of aging in human islets and identify genes that could affect disease course in diabetes."
https://openalex.org/W3134048513,"Pyrroloquinoline quinone (PQQ) has a variety of biological functions. However, rare attention has been paid to its effects on exercise-induced damage. Here, we assessed the potential protective effects of PQQ against the fatigue and oxidative damage caused by repeated exhaustive exercise, and studied the underlying mechanism. The models for exercise-induced fatigue were established, and the parameters were measured, including the time to exhaustion (TTE), biochemical indicators, the expression of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) and inflammatory cytokines and so on. Besides, the mitochondrial function was evaluated by the morphology, membrane potential, respiratory function, adenosine triphosphate (ATP) levels, and the application of the mitochondrial complex I inhibitor. The results demonstrate that PQQ prolongs TTE, causes the decrease in the activity of serum creatine kinase and lactate dehydrogenase, increases the activity of antioxidant enzymes, inhibits the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and malondialdehyde (MDA), and diminishes the over expression of NF-κB (p65) and inflammatory mediators. Furthermore, PQQ preserves normal mitochondrial function. Particularly, PQQ reduces the accumulation of ROS triggered by the mitochondrial complex I inhibitor. These data suggest that PQQ can significantly protect mice from exercise-induced fatigue and oxidative damage by improving mitochondrial function. These data also suggest that PQQ controls mitochondrial activity through directly affecting the NADH dehydrogenase."
https://openalex.org/W3134437974,"An increased omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid (n-3 PUFA) tissue status can lead to a significant formation of anti-inflammatory lipid mediators and effective reduction in inflammation and tissue injury in murine colitis. Arachidonic acid lipoxygenases (ALOX) have been implicated in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease as well as in the formation of pro- and anti-inflammatory lipid mediators. To explore the role of Alox15 in the protective response found in fat1 transgenic mice with endogenously increased n-3 PUFA tissue status fat1 transgenic mice were crossed with Alox15-deficient animals and challenged in the dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)- and the 2,4,6-trinitrobenzene sulphonic acid (TNBS)-induced colitis model. Transgenic fat1 mice rich in endogenous n-3 PUFAs were protected from colitis. However, additional systemic inactivation of the Alox15 gene counteracted this protective effect. To explore the molecular basis for this effect Alox15 lipid metabolites derived from n-3 PUFA were analyzed in the different mice. Alox15 deficiency suppressed the formation of n-3 PUFA-derived 15-hydroxy eicosapentaenoic acid (15-HEPE). In contrast, treating mice with intraperitoneal injections of 15S-HEPE protected wild-type mice from DSS- and TNBS-induced colitis. These data suggest that the anti-colitis effect of increased n-3 PUFA in the transgenic fat1 mouse model is mediated in part via Alox15-derived 15-HEPE formation."
https://openalex.org/W3135392115,"Background Early detection of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), the most common primary liver malignancy, is crucial to offer patients a potentially curative treatment strategy such as surgical resection or liver transplantation (LT). However, easily accessible biomarkers facilitating an early diagnosis of HCC as well as a reliable risk prediction are currently missing. The microRNA(miR)-107 has recently been described as a driver of HCC in both murine and human HCC but data on circulating miR-107 in HCC patients are scarce. In the present study, we evaluated a potential diagnostic and/or prognostic role of circulating miR-107 in patients undergoing tumor resection or LT for early-stage HCC. Methods The Kmplot bioinformatic tool was used to query publicly available databases (including TCGA, GEO and EGA) in order to analyse the prognostic value of tumoral miR-107 expression in HCC patients (n = 372). Serum levels of miR-107 were measured by qPCR in n = 45 HCC patients undergoing surgical tumor resection (n = 37) or LT (n = 8) as well as n = 18 healthy control samples. Results were correlated with clinical data. Results A high tumoral expression of miR-107 was associated with a significantly better overall survival compared to patients with low miR-107 expression levels (HR 0.69, 95% CI 0.48–0.99, p = 0.041). In addition, serum levels of miR-107 were significantly higher in HCC patients when compared to healthy controls. However, miR-107 serum levels in HCC patients were independent of different disease etiology, tumor stage or tumor grading. HCC patients with baseline miR-107 expression levels above a calculated ideal prognostic cut-off value (9.82) showed a clear trend towards an impaired overall survival (p = 0.119). Conclusion Tumoral miR-107 expression levels are a potential prognostic marker in early stage HCC. Furthermore, we describe a potential role of circulating miR-107 levels as a diagnostic biomarker in patients with early-stage HCC."
https://openalex.org/W3135866223,"First-degree relatives (FDRs) of type 2 diabetics (T2D) feature dysfunction of subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) long before T2D onset. miRNAs have a role in adipocyte precursor cells (APC) differentiation and in adipocyte identity. Thus, impaired miRNA expression may contribute to SAT dysfunction in FDRs. In the present work, we have explored changes in miRNA expression associated with T2D family history which may affect gene expression in SAT APCs from FDRs. Small RNA-seq was performed in APCs from healthy FDRs and matched controls and omics data were validated by qPCR. Integrative analyses of APC miRNome and transcriptome from FDRs revealed down-regulated hsa-miR-23a-5p, -193a-5p and -193b-5p accompanied by up-regulated Insulin-like Growth Factor 2 (IGF2) gene which proved to be their direct target. The expression changes in these marks were associated with SAT adipocyte hypertrophy in FDRs. APCs from FDRs further demonstrated reduced capability to differentiate into adipocytes. Treatment with IGF2 protein decreased APC adipogenesis, while over-expression of hsa-miR-23a-5p, -193a-5p and -193b-5p enhanced adipogenesis by IGF2 targeting. Indeed, IGF2 increased the Wnt Family Member 10B gene expression in APCs. Down-regulation of the three miRNAs and IGF2 up-regulation was also observed in Peripheral Blood Leukocytes (PBLs) from FDRs. In conclusion, APCs from FDRs feature a specific miRNA/gene profile, which associates with SAT adipocyte hypertrophy and appears to contribute to impaired adipogenesis. PBL detection of this profile may help in identifying adipocyte hypertrophy in individuals at high risk of T2D."
https://openalex.org/W3133534898,"Background Due to low care utilization, a complex intervention was done for two years to optimize the Ethiopian Health Extension Program. Improved quality of the integrated community case management services was an intermediate outcome of this intervention through community education and mobilization, capacity building of health workers, and strengthening of district ownership and accountability of sick child services. We evaluated the association between the intervention and the health extension workers’ ability to correctly classify common childhood illnesses in four regions of Ethiopia. Methods Baseline and endline assessments were done in 2016 and 2018 in intervention and comparison areas in four regions of Ethiopia. Ill children aged 2 to 59 months were mobilized to visit health posts for an assessment that was followed by re-examination. We analyzed sensitivity, specificity, and difference-in-difference of correct classification with multilevel mixed logistic regression in intervention and comparison areas at baseline and endline. Results Health extensions workers’ consultations with ill children were observed in intervention (n = 710) and comparison areas (n = 615). At baseline, re-examination of the children showed that in intervention areas, health extension workers’ sensitivity for fever or malaria was 54%, 68% for respiratory infections, 90% for diarrheal diseases, and 34% for malnutrition. At endline, it was 40% for fever or malaria, 49% for respiratory infections, 85% for diarrheal diseases, and 48% for malnutrition. Specificity was higher (89–100%) for all childhood illnesses. Difference-in-differences was 6% for correct classification of fever or malaria [aOR = 1.45 95% CI: 0.81–2.60], 4% for respiratory tract infection [aOR = 1.49 95% CI: 0.81–2.74], and 5% for diarrheal diseases [aOR = 1.74 95% CI: 0.77–3.92].

https://openalex.org/W3135255055,"Triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (TREM2) is a cell surface receptor expressed on macrophages, microglial cells, and pre-osteoclasts, and that participates in diverse cellular function, including inflammation, bone homeostasis, neurological development, and coagulation. In spite of the indispensable role of the TREM2 protein in the maintenance of immune homeostasis and osteoclast differentiation, the exact ligand for TREM2 has not yet been identified. Here, we report a putative TREM2 ligand which is secreted from MC38 cells and identified as a cyclophilin A (CypA). A specific interaction between CypA and TREM2 was shown at both protein and cellular levels. Exogenous CypA specifically interacted and co-localized with TREM2 in RAW264.7 cells, and the physical interactions were shown to regulate TREM2 signaling transduction. The Pro144 residue in the extracellular domain of TREM2 was found to be the specific binding site of CypA. When considered together, this provides evidence that CypA interacts specifically with TREM2 as a potent ligand."
https://openalex.org/W3135624641,"Potato ( Solanum tuberosum L.) is an important food crop that is grown and consumed worldwide. The growth and productivity of this crop are severely affected by various abiotic stresses. Basic leucine zipper (bZIP) transcription factors (TFs) in plants are well known for their function during growth and development. However, systematic and in-depth identification and functional characterization of the bZIP gene family of potato is lacking. In the current study, we identified a total of 90 bZIPs ( StbZIP ) distributed on 12 linkage groups of potato. Based on the previous functional annotation and classification of bZIPs in Arabidopsis , wheat, and rice, a phylogenetic tree of potato bZIPs was constructed and genes were categorized into various functional groups (A to I, S, and U) as previously annotated in Arabidopsis thaliana . Analyses of the transcript sequence (RNA-seq) data led to identifying a total of 18 candidate StbZIPs [four in roots, eight in the tuber, six in mesocarp and endocarp] that were expressed in a tissue-specific manner. Differential expression analysis under the various abiotic conditions (salt, mannitol, water, and heat stress) and treatment with phytohormones (ABA, GA, IAA, and BAP) led to the identification of forty-two [thirteen under salt stress, two under mannitol stress, ten under water stress, and eighteen under heat stress], and eleven [eight and three StbZIPs upon treatment with ABA, and IAA, respectively] candidate StbZIPs , respectively. Using sequence information of candidate StbZIPs , a total of 22 SSR markers were also identified in this study. In conclusion, the genome-wide identification analysis coupled with RNA-Seq expression data led to identifying candidate StbZIPs , which are dysregulated, and may play a pivotal role under various abiotic stress conditions. This study will pave the way for future functional studies using forward and reverse genetics to improve abiotic stress tolerance in potato."
https://openalex.org/W3134763990,"To select the optimum fertilizer application under specific irrigation levels and to provide a reliable fertigation system for tomato plants, an experiment was conducted by using a microporous membrane for water-fertilizer integration under non-pressure gravity. A compound fertilizer (N:P 2 O 5 :K 2 O, 18:7:20) was adopted for topdressing at four levels, 1290 kg/ha, 1140 kg/ha, 990 kg/ha, and 840 kg/ha, and the locally recommended level of 1875 kg/ha was used as the control to explore the effects of different fertilizer application rates on growth, nutrient distribution, quality, yield, and partial factor of productivity (PFP) in tomato. The new regime of microporous membrane water-fertilizer integration under non-pressure gravity irrigation reduced the fertilizer application rate while promoting plant growth in the early and intermediate stages. Except for the 990 kg/ha fertilizer treatment, yields per plant and per plot for each fertilizer application rate were higher than or equal to those of the control. The new regime could effectively improve PFP and reduce soil nutrient enrichment. Fertilizer at 840 kg/ha showed the optimum results by increasing PFP by 75.72% as compared to control. In conclusion, the fertilizer rate at 840 kg/ha has not only maintained the productivity of soil but also tomato growth and quality of fruit which makes the non-pressure gravity irrigation a potential and cost-effective way for fertilizer application."
https://openalex.org/W3135494798,"The midcycle luteinizing hormone (LH) surge initiates a cascade of events within the ovarian follicle which culminates in ovulation. Only mural granulosa cells and theca cells express large numbers of LH receptors, and LH-stimulated paracrine mediators communicate the ovulatory signal within the follicle. Recent reports identified the neuropeptide neurotensin (NTS) as a product of granulosa cells. Here, we demonstrate that granulosa cells were the primary site of NTS expression in macaque ovulatory follicles. Granulosa cell NTS mRNA and protein increased after human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) administration, which substitutes for the LH surge. To identify ovulatory actions of NTS, a NTS-neutralizing antibody was injected into preovulatory macaque follicles. hCG administration immediately followed, and ovaries were removed 48 hours later to evaluate ovulatory events. Follicles injected with control IgG ovulated normally. In contrast, 75% of NTS antibody-injected follicles failed to ovulate, containing oocytes trapped within unruptured, hemorrhagic follicles. Serum progesterone was unchanged. Of the three NTS receptors, SORT1 was highly expressed in follicular granulosa, theca, and endothelial cells; NTSR1 and NTSR2 were expressed at lower levels. Excessive blood cells in NTS antibody-injected follicles indicated vascular anomalies, so the response of monkey ovarian endothelial cells to NTS was evaluated in vitro. NTS stimulated endothelial cell migration and capillary sprout formation, consistent with a role for NTS in vascular remodeling associated with ovulation. In summary, we identified NTS as a possible paracrine mediator of ovulation. Further investigation of the NTS synthesis/response pathway may lead to improved treatments for infertility and novel targets for contraception."
https://openalex.org/W3133693140,"Aim Shortening the length of stay (LOS) is a potential and sustainable way to relieve the pressure that type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) patients placed on the public health system. Method Multi-stage random sampling was used to obtain qualified hospitals and electronic medical records for patients discharged with T2DM in 2018. A box-cox transformation was adopted to normalize LOS. Multilevel model was used to verify hospital cluster effect on LOS variations and screen potential factors for LOS variations from both individual and hospital levels. Result 50 hospitals and a total of 12,888 T2DM patients were included. Significant differences in LOS variations between hospitals, and a hospital cluster effect on LOS variations ( t = 92.188, P &lt;0.001) was detected. The results showed that female patients, patients with new rural cooperative’ medical insurance, hospitals with more beds, and hospitals with faster bed turnovers had shorter LOS. Conversely, elderly patients, patients with urban workers’ medical insurance, patients requiring surgery, patients with the International Classification of Diseases coded complication types E11.1, E11.2, E11.4, E11.5, and other complications cardiovascular diseases, grade III hospitals, hospitals with a lower doctor-to-nurse ratio, and hospitals with more daily visits per doctor had longer LOS. Conclusions The evidence proved that hospital cluster effect on LOS variation did exist. Complications and patients features at individual level, as well as organization and resource characteristics at hospital level, had impacted LOS variations to varying degrees. To shorten LOS and better meet the medical demand for T2DM patients, limited health resources must be allocated and utilized rationally at hospital level, and the patients with the characteristics of longer LOS risk must be identified in time. More influencing factors on LOS variations at different levels are still worth of comprehensive exploration in the future."
https://openalex.org/W3133704913,"Early-onset preeclampsia (PE) is a pregnancy complication that can lead to severe adverse maternal and fetal outcomes. However, the mechanisms underlying the development of early-onset PE are not fully understood. Ribosomal protein L39 (RPL39) is a member of the S39E family of ribosomal proteins that plays an important role in stem cell self-renewal, cancer metastasis, and chemoresistance. In this study, we aimed to explore the potential function of RPL39 in placental trophoblast cells. We analyzed the expression of RPL39 in early-onset PE and normal placental tissues using real-time PCR, western blot analysis, and immunohistochemistry. The results showed that RPL39 was markedly downregulated in early-onset PE placental tissues. RPL39 knockdown inhibited trophoblast cell proliferation, migration, and invasion, as well as placental explant outgrowth. Flow cytometry analysis suggested that knockdown of RPL39 resulted in cell cycle arrest at the G0/G1 phase, but had no significant effect on cell apoptosis. We also found that RPL39 knockdown could alter cell morphology. We then measured the expression of the epithelial cell marker E-cadherin following knockdown of RPL39 in Bewo and HTR8/SVneo cells. RPL39 knockdown increased the expression of E-cadherin. Furthermore, E-cadherin expression was upregulated in placental explant outgrowth tissues transfected with RPL39 small interfering RNA. In conclusion, RPL39 plays an essential role in proliferation, invasion, and migration of trophoblast cells by targeting E-cadherin. Our findings provide novel insight into the mechanisms underlying the occurrence of early-onset PE."
https://openalex.org/W3133852909,"Background Patients affected with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH) often require intensive care, and then present distinctive outcome from less severe patients. We aimed to specify their long-term outcome and to identify factors associated with poor outcome. Methods We conducted a retrospective study in a French university hospital intensive care unit. Patients with aSAH requiring mechanical ventilation hospitalized between 2010 and 2015 were included. At least one year after initial bleeding, survival and degree of disability were assessed using the modified Rankin Scale (mRS) via telephone interviews. A multivariable logistic regression analysis was performed to determine independent factors associated with poor outcome defined as mRS≥3. Results Two-hundred thirty-six patients were included. Among them, 7 were lost to follow-up, and 229 were analyzed: 73 patients (32%) had a good outcome (mRS&lt;3), and 156 (68%) had a poor outcome (mRS≥3). The estimated 1-year survival rate was 63%. One-hundred sixty-three patients patients (71%) suffered from early brain injuries (EBI), 33 (14%) from rebleeding, 80 (35%) from vasospasm and 63 (27%) from delayed cerebral ischemia (DCI). Multivariable logistic regression identified independent factors associated with poor outcome including delay between aSAH diagnosis and mRS assessment (OR, 0.96; 95% CI, 0.95-0.98; p&lt;.0001), age (OR per 10 points, 1.57; 95% CI, 1.12-2.19; p = 0.008), WFNS V versus WFNS III (OR, 5.71; 95% CI 1.51-21.61; p = 0.004), subarachnoid rebleeding (OR, 6.47; 95% CI 1.16-36.06; p = 0.033), EBI (OR, 4.52; 95% CI 1.81-11.29; p = 0.001) and DCI (OR, 4.73; 95% CI, 1.66-13.49; p = 0.004). Conclusion Among aSAH patients requiring assisted ventilation, two-third of them survived at one year, and one-third showed good long-term outcome. As it appears as an independant factor associated with poor outcome, DCI shoud retain particular attention in future studies beyond angiographic vasospasm."
https://openalex.org/W3134616126,"Anxiety influences how individuals experience and regulate emotions in a variety of ways. For example, individuals with lower anxiety tend to cognitively reframe (reappraise) negative emotion and those with higher anxiety tend to suppress negative emotion. Research has also investigated these individual differences with psychophysiology. These lines of research assume coherence between how individuals regulate outside the laboratory, typically measured with self-report, and how they regulate during an experiment. Indeed, performance during experiments is interpreted as an indication of future behavior outside the laboratory, yet this relationship is seldom directly explored. To address this gap, we computed psychophysiological profiles of uninstructed (natural) regulation in the laboratory and explored the coherence between these profiles and a) self-reported anxiety and b) self-reported regulation tendency. Participants viewed negative images and were instructed to reappraise, suppress or naturally engage. Electrodermal and facial electromyography signals were recorded to compute a multivariate psychophysiological profile of regulation. Participants with lower anxiety exhibited similar profiles when naturally regulating and following instructions to reappraise, suggesting they naturally reappraised more. Participants with higher anxiety exhibited similar profiles when naturally regulating and following instructions to suppress, suggesting they naturally suppressed more. However, there was no association between self-reported reappraisal or suppression tendency and psychophysiology. These exploratory results indicate that anxiety, but not regulation tendency, predicts how individuals regulate emotion in the laboratory. These findings suggest that how individuals report regulating in the real world does not map on to how they regulate in the laboratory. Taken together, this underscores the importance of developing emotion-regulation interventions and paradigms that more closely align to and predict real-world outcomes."
https://openalex.org/W3134742076,"Tuberculous meningitis (TBM) is the most fatal form of tuberculosis and frequently occurs in children. The inflammatory process initiates secondary brain injury processes that lead to death and disability. Much remains unknown about this cerebral inflammatory process, largely because of the difficulty in studying the brain. To date, studies have typically examined samples from sites distal to the site of disease, such as spinal cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and blood. In this pilot study, we examined the feasibility of using direct brain microdialysis (MD) to detect inflammatory mediators in brain extracellular fluid (ECF) in TBM. MD was used to help guide neurocritical care in 7 comatose children with TBM by monitoring brain chemistry for up to 4 days. Remnant ECF fluid was stored for offline analysis. Samples of ventricular CSF, lumbar CSF and blood were collected at clinically indicated procedures for comparison. Inflammatory mediators were quantified using multiplex technology. All inflammatory markers, with the exception of interleukin (IL)-10 and IL-12p40, were detected in the ECF. Cytokine concentrations were generally lower in ECF than ventricular CSF in time-linked specimens. Individual cases showed ECF cytokine increases coinciding with marked increases in ECF glycerol or decreases in ECF glucose. Cytokine levels and glycerol were generally higher in patients with more severe disease. This is the first report of inflammatory marker analysis from samples derived directly from the brain and in high temporal resolution, demonstrating feasibility of cerebral MD to explore disease progression and possibly therapy response in TBM."
https://openalex.org/W3135812473,"The importance of cell phenotype in determining the molecular mechanisms underlying β2-adrenoceptor (β2AR) function has been noted previously when comparing responses in primary cells and recombinant model cell lines. Here, we have generated haplotype-specific SNAP-tagged β2AR human embryonic stem (ES) cell lines and applied fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS) to study cell surface receptors in progenitor cells and in differentiated fibroblasts and cardiomyocytes. FCS was able to quantify SNAP-tagged β2AR number and diffusion in both ES-derived cardiomyocytes and CRISPR/Cas9 genome-edited HEK293T cells, where the expression level was too low to detect using standard confocal microscopy. These studies demonstrate the power of FCS in investigating cell surface β2ARs at the very low expression levels often seen in endogenously expressing cells. Furthermore, the use of ES cell technology in combination with FCS allowed us to demonstrate that cell surface β2ARs internalize in response to formoterol-stimulation in ES progenitor cells but not following their differentiation into ES-derived fibroblasts. This indicates that the process of agonist-induced receptor internalization is strongly influenced by cell phenotype and this may have important implications for drug treatment with long-acting β2AR agonists."
https://openalex.org/W3133579398,"We previously reported on the role of pericyte-like cells as functional sentinel immune cells in lung injury. However, much about the biological role of pericytes in lung injury remains unknown. Lung pericyte-like cells are well-positioned to sense disruption to the epithelial barrier and coordinate local inflammatory responses due to their anatomic niche within the alveoli. In this report, we characterized transcriptional responses and functional changes in pericyte-like cells following activation by alveolar components from injured and uninjured lungs in a mouse model of acute lung injury (ALI). Purified pericyte-like cells from lung digests using PDGFRβ as a selection marker were expanded in culture as previously described (1). We induced sterile acute lung injury in mice with recombinant human Fas ligand (rhFasL) instillation followed by mechanical ventilation (1). We then collected bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) from injured and uninjured mice. Purified pericyte-like cells in culture were exposed to growth media only (control), BALF from uninjured mice, and BALF from injured mice for 6 and 24 hours. RNA collected from these treatment conditions were processed for RNAseq. Targets of interest identified by pathway analysis were validated using in vitro and in vivo assays. We observed robust global transcriptional changes in pericyte-like cells following treatment with uninjured and injured BALF at 6 hours, but this response persisted for 24 hours only after exposure to injured BALF. Functional enrichment analysis of pericytes treated with injured BALF revealed the activation of pro-inflammatory, cell migration, and angiogenesis-related pathways, whereas processes associated with tissue development and cell differentiation were down-regulated. We validated select upregulated targets in the inflammatory, angiogenic, and cell migratory pathways using functional biological assays in vitro and in vivo. We conclude that lung pericyte-like cells are highly responsive to alveolar compartment content from both uninjured and injured lungs, but injured BALF elicits a more sustained response. The inflammatory, angiogenic, and migratory changes exhibited by activated pericyte-like cells underscore the phenotypic plasticity of these specialized stromal cells in the setting of acute lung injury."
https://openalex.org/W3133657427,"Migrating tumor cells are characterized by a sustained front-rear asymmetry, with a front enriched in filamentous actin, which is induced by Rho small GTPase Rac. Regulation of Rac activity by its regulators should be required for effective motility. Here, we show that FilGAP, a GTPase-activating protein (GAP) for Rac, controls front-rear polarity and contributes to maintain effective tumor cell migration through the extracellular matrix (ECM). Overexpression of FilGAP in breast cancer cells induced polarized morphology and led to increased migration speed in collagen matrices, while depletion of FilGAP impaired the cell polarity and migration. FilGAP localizes to the cell front through its pleckstrin-homology (PH) domain in a phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PIP3)-dependent manner and appears to inactivate Rac at its site. We found that the affinity of PH domain to PIP3 is critically involved in the maintenance of cell polarity. Moreover, small GTPase ADP-ribosylation factor 6 (Arf6), which binds to the FilGAP PH domain, also regulates FilGAP-mediated cell polarity and migration of breast cancer cells. We propose that FilGAP regulates front-rear polarity through its PIP3 and Arf6 binding in tumor cell migration through the ECM."
https://openalex.org/W3134586359,"Ethylene glycol butyl ether (EGBE) is a ubiquitous environmental pollutant that is commonly used in maquillage, industrial, and household products. EGBE has been shown to cause blood toxicity, carcinogenicity, and organ malformations. However, little is known about the impact of EGBE on the female reproductive system, especially oocyte quality. Here, we reported that EGBE influenced oocyte quality by showing the disturbed oocyte meiotic capacity, fertilization potential, and early embryonic development competency. Specifically, EGBE exposure impaired spindle/chromosome structure, microtubule stability, and actin polymerization to result in the oocyte maturation arrest and aneuploidy. In addition, EGBE exposure compromised the dynamics of cortical granules and their component ovastacin, leading to the failure of sperm binding and fertilization. Last, single-cell transcriptome analysis revealed that EGBE-induced oocyte deterioration was caused by mitochondrial dysfunction, which led to the accumulation of ROS and occurrence of apoptosis. Altogether, our study illustrates that mitochondrial dysfunction and redox perturbation is the major cause of the poor quality of oocytes exposed to EGBE."
https://openalex.org/W3135553924,"Recently, the incidence of thyroid cancer (THCA) has been on the rise. RNA binding proteins (RBPs) and their abnormal expression are closely related to the emergence and pathogenesis of tumor diseases. In this study, we obtained gene expression data and corresponding clinical information from the TCGA database. A total of 162 aberrantly expressed RBPs were obtained, comprising 92 up-regulated and 70 down-regulated RBPs. Then, we performed a functional enrichment analysis and constructed a PPI network. Through univariate Cox regression analysis of key genes and found that NOLC1 ( p = 0.036), RPS27L ( p = 0.011), TDRD9 ( p = 0.016), TDRD6 ( p = 0.002), IFIT2 ( p = 0.037), and IFIT3 ( p = 0.02) were significantly related to the prognosis. Through the online website Kaplan-Meier plotter and multivariate Cox analysis, we identified 2 RBP-coding genes ( RPS27L and IFIT3 ) to construct a predictive model in the entire TCGA dataset and then validate in two subsets. In-depth analysis revealed that the data gave by this model, the patient’s high-risk score is very closely related to the overall survival rate difference ( p = 0.038). Further, we investigated the correlation between the model and the clinic, and the results indicated that the high-risk was in the male group ( p = 0.011) and the T3-4 group ( p = 0.046) was associated with a poor prognosis. On the whole, the conclusions of our research this time can make it possible to find more insights into the research on the pathogenesis of THCA, this could be beneficial for individualized treatment and medical decision making."
https://openalex.org/W3133851586,"Background In India, under-five children with Severe Acute Malnutrition (SAM) are referred to Nutritional Rehabilitation Centers (NRCs). NRCs screen the causes of SAM including tuberculosis (TB). The national TB programme recommends upfront testing with a rapid molecular test if TB is suspected in children. Objective We estimated the yield of and adherence to the TB diagnostic guidelines (clinical assessment and assessment for microbiological confirmation) among under-five children with SAM admitted at NRCs (six in district Sagar and four in district Sheopur) of Madhya Pradesh, India in 2017. We also explored the challenges in screening from the health care providers’ perspective. Methods It was an explanatory mixed method study. The NRC records were reviewed This was followed by three key informant interviews and three focus group discussions among staff of NRC and TB programme. Manual descriptive thematic analysis was performed. Results Of 3230, a total of 2665(83%) children underwent Mantoux test, 2438(75%) underwent physical examination, 2277(70%) were asked about the symptoms suggestive of TB, 1220(38%) underwent chest radiograph and 485(15%) were asked for recent contact with TB. A total of 547(17%) underwent assessment for microbiological confirmation. Of 547, a total of 229 gastric aspirate specimens underwent rapid molecular test (24% positive) and 318 underwent sputum microscopy (44% positive). A total of 223 were diagnosed as TB (195 microbiologically and 28 clinically confirmed) and 209 were initiated on anti-TB treatment. The treatment outcome was favourable (cure or treatment completed) for 70(31%) and not recorded for 121(54%). The main perceived challenges in screening for TB were poor team skills, lack of diagnostic facilities and poor understanding of the guidelines due to inadequate training. Conclusion Though NRCs provided a unique window of opportunity for the screening and management of TB among under-five children with SAM, the utilization of this opportunity remained suboptimal."
https://openalex.org/W3133864617,"Organization of G protein-coupled receptors at the plasma membrane has been the focus of much recent attention. Advanced microscopy techniques have shown that these receptors can be localized to discrete microdomains and reorganization upon ligand activation is crucial in orchestrating their signaling. Here, we have compared the membrane organization and downstream signaling of a mutant (R108A, R3.50A) of the adenosine A3 receptor (A3AR) to that of the wild-type receptor. Fluorescence Correlation Spectroscopy (FCS) studies with a fluorescent agonist (ABEA-X-BY630) demonstrated that both wild-type and mutant receptors bind agonist with high affinity but in subsequent downstream signaling assays the R108A mutation abolished agonist-mediated inhibition of cAMP production and ERK phosphorylation. In further FCS studies, both A3AR and A3AR R108A underwent similar agonist-induced increases in receptor density and molecular brightness which were accompanied by a decrease in membrane diffusion after agonist treatment. Using bimolecular fluorescence complementation, experiments showed that the R108A mutant retained the ability to recruit β-arrestin and these receptor/arrestin complexes displayed similar membrane diffusion and organization to that observed with wild-type receptors. These data demonstrate that effective G protein signaling is not a prerequisite for agonist-stimulated β-arrestin recruitment and membrane reorganization of the A3AR."
https://openalex.org/W3134053423,"Normal thyroid tissue displays a prevalent expression of ERβ than ERα, which drastically turns upside down in the initiation and progression of papillary thyroid cancer (PTC). The underlying molecular mechanism of this phenomenon remains unclear. Here, we demonstrated that ERα and ERβ were coexpressed in human thyroid tissues and cells. ERα mRNA (A-1) and ERβ mRNA (0N-1), transcribed from Promoter A of ERα gene and Promoter 0N of ERβ gene, respectively, were the major mRNA isoforms which mainly contributed to total ERα mRNA and total ERβ mRNA in human thyroid-derived cell lines and tissues. The expression levels of ERα mRNA (A-1) and total ERα mRNA were gradually increased, and those of ERβ mRNA (0N-1) and total ERβ mRNA were decreased by degree in the initiation and progression of PTC. No aberrant DNA methylation of ERα 5′-untranslated region was involved in its up-regulation; however, aberrant DNA methylation in Promoter 0N and Exon 0N of ERβ gene was found to be involved in its down-regulation in the initiation and progression of PTC. ERβ can repress ERα gene transcription via recruitment of NCoR and displacement of RNA polymerase II at the Sp1 site in ERα Promoter A-specific region in thyroid-derived cells. It is suggested that DNA methylation of CpG islands in Promoter 0N and Exon 0N of ERβ gene leads to a decreased ERβ gene expression, which attenuates its inhibitory effect on ERα gene transcription and results in an increased ERα gene expression, cell proliferation, initiation, and progression of PTC."
https://openalex.org/W3134898315,"Immature neurons dominantly express the Na + -K + -2Cl - cotransporter isoform 1 (NKCC1) rather than the K + -Cl - cotransporter isoform 2 (KCC2). The intracellular chloride ion concentration ([Cl - ]i) is higher in immature neurons than in mature neurons; therefore, γ-aminobutyric acid type A (GABAA) receptor activation in immature neurons does not cause chloride ion influx and subsequent hyperpolarization. In our previous work, we found that midazolam, benzodiazepine receptor agonist, causes less sedation in neonatal rats compared to adult rats and that NKCC1 blockade by bumetanide enhances the midazolam-induced sedation in neonatal, but not in adult, rats. These results suggest that GABA receptor activation requires the predominance of KCC2 over NKCC1 to exert sedative effects. In this study, we focused on CLP290, a novel KCC2-selective activator, and found that midazolam administration at 20 mg/kg after oral CLP290 intake significantly prolonged the righting reflex latency even in neonatal rats at postnatal day 7. By contrast, CLP290 alone did not exert sedative effects. Immunohistochemistry showed that midazolam combined with CLP290 decreased the number of phosphorylated cAMP response element-binding protein-positive cells in the cerebral cortex, suggesting that CLP290 reverted the inhibitory effect of midazolam. Moreover, the sedative effect of combined CLP290 and midazolam treatment was inhibited by the administration of the KCC2-selective inhibitor VU0463271, suggesting indirectly that the sedation-promoting effect of CLP290 was mediated by KCC2 activation. To our knowledge, this study is the first report showing the sedation-promoting effect of CLP290 in neonates and providing behavioral and histological evidence that CLP290 reverted the sedative effect of GABAergic drugs through the activation of KCC2. Our data suggest that the clinical application of CLP290 may provide a breakthrough in terms of midazolam-resistant sedation."
https://openalex.org/W3134944519,"Prolonged periods of energy deficit leading to weight loss induce metabolic adaptations resulting in reduced energy expenditure, but the mechanisms for energy conservation are incompletely understood. We examined 42 healthy athletic females (age 27.5 ± 4.0 years, body mass index 23.4 ± 1.7 kg/m2) who volunteered into either a group dieting for physique competition (n = 25) or a control group (n = 17). The diet group substantially reduced their energy intake and moderately increased exercise levels to induce loss of fat mass that was regained during a voluntary weight regain period. The control group maintained their typical lifestyle habits and body mass as instructed. From the diet group, fasting blood samples were drawn at baseline (PRE), after 4- to 5-month weight loss (PRE-MID), and after 4- to 5-month weight regain (MID-POST) as well as from the control group at similar intervals. Blood was analyzed to determine leukocyte transcriptome by RNA-Sequencing and serum metabolome by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) platform. The intensive weight loss period induced several metabolic adaptations, including a prominent suppression of transcriptomic signature for mitochondrial OXPHOS and ribosome biogenesis. The upstream regulator analysis suggested that this reprogramming of cellular energy metabolism may be mediated via AMPK/PGC1-α signaling and mTOR/eIF2 signaling-dependent pathways. Our findings show for the first time that prolonged energy deprivation induced modulation of mitochondrial metabolism can be observed through minimally invasive measures of leukocyte transcriptome and serum metabolome at systemic level, suggesting that adaptation to energy deficit is broader in humans than previously thought."
https://openalex.org/W3135521738,"Chronic muscle loading (overload) induces skeletal muscles to undergo hypertrophy and to increase glucose uptake. Although AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) reportedly serves as a negative regulator of hypertrophy and a positive regulator of glucose uptake, its role in overload-induced skeletal muscle hypertrophy and glucose uptake is unclear. This study aimed to determine whether AMPK regulates overload-induced hypertrophy and glucose uptake in skeletal muscles. To this end, skeletal muscle overload was induced through unilateral synergist ablations in wild-type (WT) and transgenic mice, expressing the dominant-negative mutation of AMPK (AMPK-DN). After 14 days, parameters, including muscle fiber cross-sectional area (CSA), glycogen level, and in vivo [3H]-2-deoxy-D-glucose uptake, were assessed. No significant difference was observed in body weight or blood glucose level between the WT and AMPK-DN mice. However, the 14-day muscle overload activated the AMPK pathway in WT mice skeletal muscle, whereas this response was impaired in the AMPK-DN mice. Despite a normal CSA gain in each fiber type, the AMPK-DN mice demonstrated a significant impairment of overload-induced muscle glucose uptake and glycogenesis, compared to WT mice. Moreover, 14-day overload-induced changes in GLUT4 and HKII expression levels were reduced in AMPK-DN mice, compared to WT mice. This study demonstrated that AMPK activation is indispensable for overload-induced muscle glucose uptake and glycogenesis; however, it is dispensable for the induction of hypertrophy in AMPK-DN mice. Furthermore, the AMPK/GLUT4 and HKII axes may regulate overload-induced muscle glucose uptake and glycogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W3134312773,"Antisense transcription occurs widely more expected than when it was first identified in bacteria in the 1980s. However, the functional relevance of antisense transcripts in transcription remains controversial. Here, we investigated the putative role of antisense transcripts in regulating their corresponding sense transcripts by analyzing changes in correlative relationships between sense-antisense pairs under tumor and normal conditions. A total of 3469 sense-antisense gene pairs (SAGPs) downloaded from BioMart mapped to a list of sense and antisense genes in RNA-seq data derived from 80 paired colorectal cancer (CRC) samples were analyzed. As a result, cancer-related genes were significantly enriched in the significantly correlated SAGPs (SCPs). Differentially expressed genes estimated between normal and tumor conditions were also significantly more enriched in SCPs than in non-SCPs. Interestingly, using differential correlation analysis, we found that tumor samples had a significantly larger density of genes with higher correlation coefficients than normal samples, as verified by various cancer transcriptomes from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). Moreover, we found that the magnitude of the correlation between SAGPs could distinguish poor prognostic CRCs from good prognostic CRCs, showing that correlation coefficients between the SAGPs of CRCs with a poor prognosis were significantly stronger than CRCs with a good prognosis. Consistent with this finding, the Cox proportion hazards model showed that the survival rates were significantly different between patients with high and low expression of genes in the SCPs. All these results strongly support the idea that antisense transcripts are important regulators of their corresponding sense transcripts."
https://openalex.org/W3134711152,"The present study presents a non-surgical approach to assess colonic mechanical sensitivity in mice using colonometry, a technique in which colonic stretch-reflex contractions are measured by recording intracolonic pressures during saline infusion into the distal colon in a constant rate. Colonometrical recording has been used to assess colonic function in healthy individuals and patients with neurological disorders. Here we found that colonometry can also be implemented in mice, with an optimal saline infusion rate of 1.2 mL/h. Colonometrograms showed intermittent pressure rises that was caused by periodical colonic contractions. In the sceneries of colonic hypersensitivity that was generated post 2,4,6-trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (TNBS)-induced colonic inflammation, following chemogenetic activation of primary afferent neurons, or immediately after noxious stimulation of the colon by colorectal distension (CRD), the amplitude of intracolonic pressure (A ICP ) was markedly elevated which was accompanied by a faster pressure rising (ΔP/Δt). Colonic hypersensitivity-associated A ICP elevation was a result of the enhanced strength of colonic stretch-reflex contraction which reflected the heightened activity of the colonic sensory reflex pathways. The increased value of ΔP/Δt in colonic hypersensitivity indicated a lower threshold of colonic mechanical sensation by which colonic stretch-reflex contraction was elicited by a smaller saline infusion volume during a shorter period of infusion time. Chemogenetic inhibition of primary afferent pathway that was governed by Nav1.8-expressing cells attenuated TNBS-induced up-regulations of A ICP , ΔP/Δt, and colonic pain behavior in response to CRD. These findings support that colonometrograms can be used for analysis of colonic pain in mice."
https://openalex.org/W3134868502,"Mosaicism ratio, or MR, is a laboratory metric that can be calculated using massively parallel sequencing data from cell-free DNA (cfDNA) screening. MR compares the amount of cfDNA present from a particular chromosome or chromosomal region to the overall fetal fraction of the specimen. In singleton gestations, MR may be used to refine the positive predictive value of an abnormal cfDNA screening result by identifying cases that could be impacted by various biological factors, such as placental mosaicism or prior co-twin demise. The current study was designed to examine the behavior of mosaicism ratio (MR) in multifetal gestations. Multifetal cfDNA specimens with positive results for trisomies 21, 18, or 13 and confirmed diagnostic outcomes were compiled to examine MR of the aneuploid chromosome based on the number of affected fetuses/placentas. A second multifetal cohort was assembled to analyze the MR of the Y chromosome in cases with at least one male fetus. For aneuploid cases, the average MR of affected singletons (used as a biological proxy for two affected twins) was significantly higher than the average MR for twins in which one fetus was affected. The average MR of the aneuploid chromosome for one affected twin was 52%, 42%, and 48% of that of singleton gestations for trisomy 21, 18, and 13 cases, respectively. MR cutoffs of 0.7 for trisomy 21, and 0.5 for trisomies 18 and 13 may help predict whether one versus both twins are affected with aneuploidy when clinical concern arises. For male cases, the Y MR of XX/XY gestations was 48% of the Y MR for XY/XY gestations. Using a Y MR cutoff of 0.8 allowed determination of XX/XY versus XY/XY gestations with 92.3-94.9% accuracy. Based on the data presented, MR may have utility in the analysis and interpretation of cfDNA data from multifetal gestations."
https://openalex.org/W3134156136,"Cholinergic modulation of hippocampal network function is implicated in multiple behavioral and cognitive states. Activation of nicotinic and muscarinic acetylcholine receptors affects neuronal excitability, synaptic transmission and rhythmic oscillations in the hippocampus. In this work, we studied the ability of the cholinergic system to sustain hippocampal epileptiform activity independently from glutamate and GABA transmission. Simultaneous CA3 and CA1 field potential recordings were obtained during the perfusion of hippocampal slices with the aCSF containing AMPA, NMDA and GABA receptor antagonists. Under these conditions, spontaneous epileptiform discharges synchronous between CA3 and CA1 were recorded. Epileptiform discharges were blocked by addition of the calcium-channel blocker Cd 2+ and disappeared in CA1 after a surgical cut between CA3 and CA1. Cholinergic antagonist mecamylamine abolished CA3-CA1 synchronous epileptiform discharges, while antagonists of α7 and α4β2 nAChRs, MLA and DhβE, had no effect. Our results suggest that activation of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors can sustain CA3-CA1 synchronous epileptiform activity independently from AMPA, NMDA and GABA transmission. In addition, mecamylamine, but not α7 and α4β2 nAChRs antagonists, reduced bicuculline-induced seizure-like activity. The ability of mecamylamine to decrease hippocampal network synchronization might be associated with its therapeutic effects in a wide variety of CNS disorders including addiction, depression and anxiety."
https://openalex.org/W3135308097,"Neurofilaments(NFs) are the most abundant intermediate filaments that make up the inner volume of axon, with possible phosphorylation on their side arms, and their slow axonal transport by molecular motors along microtubule tracks in a “stop-and-go” manner with rapid, intermittent and bidirectional motion. The kinetics of NFs and morphology of axon are dramatically different between myelinate internode and unmyelinated node of Ranvier. The NFs in the node transport as 7.6 times faster as in the internode, and the distribution of NFs population in the internode is 7.6 folds as much as in the node of Ranvier. We hypothesize that the phosphorylation of NFs could reduce the on-track rate and slow down their transport velocity in the internode. By modifying the ‘6-state’ model with (a) an extra phosphorylation kinetics to each six state and (b) construction a new ‘8-state’ model in which NFs at off-track can be phosphorylated and have smaller on-track rate, our model and simulation demonstrate that the phosphorylation-induced decrease of on-track rate could slow down the NFs average velocity and increase the axonal caliber. The degree of phosphorylation may indicate the extent of velocity reduction. The Continuity equation used in our paper predicts that the ratio of NFs population is inverse proportional to the ratios of average velocity of NFs between node of Ranvier and internode. We speculate that the myelination of axon could increase the level of phosphorylation of NF side arms, and decrease the possibility of NFs to get on-track of microtubules, therefore slow down their transport velocity. In summary, our work provides a potential mechanism for understanding the phosphorylation kinetics of NFs in regulating their transport and morphology of axon in myelinated axons, and the different kinetics of NFs between node and internode."
https://openalex.org/W3135720454,"This article investigates the technical efficiency in German higher education while accounting for possible heterogeneity in the production technology. We investigate whether a latent class model would identify the different sub-disciplines of life sciences in a sample of biology and agricultural units based on technological differences. We fit a latent class stochastic frontier model to estimate the parameters of an output distance function formulation of the production technology to investigate if a technological separation is meaningful along sub-disciplinary lines. We apply bootstrapping techniques for model validation. Our analysis relies on evaluating a unique dataset that matches information on higher educational institutions provided by the Federal Statistical Office of Germany with the bibliometric information extracted from the ISI Web of Science Database. The estimates indicate that neglecting to account for the possible existence of latent classes leads to a biased perception of efficiency. A classification into a research-focused and teaching-focused decision-making unit improves model fit compared to the pooled stochastic frontier model. Additionally, research-focused units have a higher median technical efficiency than teaching-focused units. As the research focus is more prevalent in the biology subsample an analysis not considering the potential existence of latent classes might misleadingly give the appearance of a higher mean efficiency of biology. In fact, we find no evidence of a difference in the mean technical efficiencies for German agricultural sciences and biology using the latent class model."
