When calculated as a 0.1-micrometer microlayer of wet surfactants, the mean concentration of organic matter was 2.9 grams per liter, of which carbohydrates accounted for 28 percent. The data for plant pigments and particulate adenosine triphosphate indicated that bacterioneuston was enriched at seven of nine stations while phagotrophic protists were enriched at five stations. Instances of enrichment and inhibition were verified by cultural data for bacteria and amoebas. The observations indicate that the surface microlayers are largely heterotrophic microcosms, which can be as rich as laboratory cultures, and that an appreciable part of the dissolved organic carbon is carbohydrate of phytoplankton origin, released and brought to the surface by migrating and excreting phagotrophic protists."
https://openalex.org/W2072561297,"The bioenergetic implications of changing cereal grain protein concentrations and amino acid compositions by plant breeding are examined. It is shown that increased inputs of carbon assimilates and nitrogen are necessary when increasing protein concentration in cereal grains while maintaining high yields. Also, energetic requirements for obtaining endosperm proteins with a high lysine content in genotypes of maize and barley are slightly higher than in normal lysine stocks. The implications for plant breeding are discussed."

The Mt. Agung eruption in March 1963 produced a decrease of about 0.5 degrees C in the mean temperature of the tropical troposphere. The contribution of the Atlantic is not significant."
