However, the role of Smyd2 in immunity and inflammation remains poorly understood. In this study, we report that Smyd2 is a novel negative regulator for macrophage activation and M1 polarization. Elevated Smyd2 expression suppresses the production of proinflammatory cytokines, including IL-6 and TNF, and inhibits the expression of important cell surface molecules, including major MHC-II and costimulatory molecules. Furthermore, macrophages with high Smyd2 expression inhibit Th-17 cell differentiation but promote regulatory T cell differentiation as a result of increased TGF-β production and decreased IL-6 secretion. In macrophages, Smyd2 specifically facilitates H3K36 dimethylation at Tnf and Il6 promoters to suppress their transcription and inhibits NF-κB and ERK signaling. Therefore, our data demonstrate that epigenetic modification by Smyd2-mediated H3K36 dimethylation at Tnf and Il6 promoters plays an important role in the regulation of macrophage activation during inflammation.BackgroundMacrophages express Smyd2 during development and differentiation.ResultsSmyd2 inhibits macrophage IL-6 and TNF-α production.ConclusionSmyd2 negatively regulates M1 macrophage polarization.SignificanceThese findings are important for understanding the regulation of macrophage polarization and provide new insights for autoimmune disease therapy.

It is important to understand factors that increase or decrease metastatic activity in order to more effectively research and implement treatments for melanoma. Increased cell invasion through the extracellular matrix is required for metastasis and is enhanced by matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs). Tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases 3 (TIMP3) inhibits MMP activity. It was previously shown by our group that miR-21, a potential regulator of TIMP3, is over-expressed in cutaneous melanoma. It was therefore hypothesized that increased levels of miR-21 expression would lead to decreased expression of TIMP3 and thereby enhance the invasiveness of melanoma cells. miR-21 over-expression in the melanoma cell lines WM1552c, WM793b, A375 and MEL 39 was accomplished via transfection with pre-miR-21. Immunoblot analysis of miR-21-overexpressing cell lines revealed reduced expression of TIMP3 as compared to controls. This in turn led to a significant increase in the invasiveness of the radial growth phase cell line WM1552c and the vertical growth phase cell line WM793b (p < 0.05), but not in the metastatic cell lines A375 or MEL 39. The proliferation and migration of miR-21 over-expressing cell lines was not affected. Reduced expression of TIMP3 was achieved by siRNA knockdown and significantly enhanced invasion of melanoma cell lines, mimicking the effects of miR-21 over-expression. Treatment of tumor cells with a linked nucleic acid antagomir to miR-21 inhibited tumor growth and increased tumor expression of TIMP3 in vivo in 01B74 Athymic NCr-nu/nu mice. Intra-tumoral injections of anti-miR-21 produced similar effects. This data shows that increased expression of miR-21 enhanced the invasive potential of melanoma cell lines through TIMP3 inhibition. Therefore, inhibition of miR-21 in melanoma may reduce melanoma invasiveness."
https://openalex.org/W2141466449,"Background Exercise can relieve both depressive and anxiety disorders and it is therefore of importance to establish movement patterns of mildly to moderately affected sufferers to estimate the treatment potential. The aim is to describe the physical activity patterns of people affected by mild to moderate depressive and/or anxiety symptoms using objective measures of physical activity. Methods The design of the study was cross-sectional using data from 165 people aged 18–65 years, with mild to moderate depressive and/or anxiety disorder symptoms (scoring ≥10 on the PHQ-9). Diagnoses were made using Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI) and symptom severity was measured with the Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS). The participants wore accelerometers for a week to evaluate physical activity patterns. Results No statistically significant differences were detected between different diagnoses, though depressed participants tended to be less active and more sedentary. Only one-fifth of the sample followed public health guidelines regarding physical activity. Each one point increase in MADRS was associated with a 2.4 minute reduction in light physical activity, independent of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity and sedentary time. MADRS was positively associated with number of sedentary bouts. Conclusions The physical activity pattern of people with depressive and/or anxiety disorders was characterized by large amounts of sedentary time and low fulfillment of physical activity guidelines. There is therefore a large treatment potential for this group by increasing exercise. The results suggest that instead of focusing exclusively on high intensity exercise for treating depressive and anxiety disorders, health care providers might encourage patients to reduce sedentary time by increasing light physical activity and decreasing the number of sedentary bouts, though further studies are needed that can determine directionality."
https://openalex.org/W1996242564,"Currently, it is still a tough task for dentists to remineralize dentine in deep caries. The aim of this study was to remineralize demineralized dentine in a tooth model of deep caries using nanocomplexes of carboxymethyl chitosan/amorphous calcium phosphate (CMC/ACP) based on mimicking the stabilizing effect of dentine matrix protein 1 (DMP1) on ACP in the biomineralization of dentine. The experimental results indicate that CMC can stabilize ACP to form nanocomplexes of CMC/ACP, which is able to be processed into scaffolds by lyophilization. In the single-layer collagen model, ACP nanoparticles are released from scaffolds of CMC/ACP nanocomplexes dissolved and then infiltrate into collagen fibrils via the gap zones (40 nm) to accomplish intrafibrillar mineralization of collagen. With this method, the completely demineralized dentine was partially remineralized in the tooth mode. This is a bottom-up remineralizing strategy based on non-classical crystallization theory. Since nanocomplexes of CMC/ACP show a promising effect of remineralization on demineralized dentine via biomimetic strategy, thereby preserving dentinal tissue to the maximum extent possible, it would be a potential indirect pulp capping (IPC) material for the management of deep caries during vital pulp therapy based on the concept of minimally invasive dentistry (MID)."
https://openalex.org/W2146729586,"Targeted genome engineering to robustly express transgenes is an essential methodology for stem cell-based research and therapy. Although designer nucleases have been used to drastically enhance gene editing efficiency, targeted addition and stable expression of transgenes to date is limited at single gene/locus and mostly PPP1R12C/AAVS1 in human stem cells. Here we constructed transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs) targeting the safe-harbor like gene CLYBL to mediate reporter gene integration at 38%–58% efficiency, and used both AAVS1-TALENs and CLYBL-TALENs to simultaneously knock-in multiple reporter genes at dual safe-harbor loci in human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) and neural stem cells (NSCs). The CLYBL-TALEN engineered cell lines maintained robust reporter expression during self-renewal and differentiation, and revealed that CLYBL targeting resulted in stronger transgene expression and less perturbation on local gene expression than PPP1R12C/AAVS1. TALEN-mediated CLYBL engineering provides improved transgene expression and options for multiple genetic modification in human stem cells."
https://openalex.org/W2017044836,"The mechanism by which extracellular metabolites, including redox mediators and quorum-sensing signaling molecules, traffic through the extracellular matrix of biofilms is poorly explored. We hypothesize that functional amyloids, abundant in natural biofilms and possessing hydrophobic domains, retain these metabolites. Using surface plasmon resonance, we demonstrate that the quorum-sensing (QS) molecules, 2-heptyl-3-hydroxy-4(1H)-quinolone and N-(3-oxododecanoyl)-l-homoserine lactone, and the redox mediator pyocyanin bind with transient affinity to functional amyloids from Pseudomonas (Fap). Their high hydrophobicity predisposes them to signal-amyloid interactions, but specific interactions also play a role. Transient interactions allow for rapid association and dissociation kinetics, which make the QS molecules bioavailable and at the same time secure within the extracellular matrix as a consequence of serial bindings. Retention of the QS molecules was confirmed using Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1-based 2-heptyl-3-hydroxy-4(1H)-quinolone and N-(3-oxododecanoyl)-l-homoserine lactone reporter assays, showing that Fap fibrils pretreated with the QS molecules activate the reporters even after sequential washes. Pyocyanin retention was validated by electrochemical analysis of pyocyanin-pretreated Fap fibrils subjected to the same washing process.

Amyloids are insoluble fibers formed by either regulated or unregulated protein folding. Although they are more commonly associated with human diseases, amyloids fulfill important microbial functions, including as structural components in biofilms and in the cell wall of bacterial spores, adhesins mediating specific binding to and internalization into host cells, and as a means to attenuate the cytotoxicity of bacteriocins (1.Bieler S.

Furthermore, their assembly is regulated (5.Blanco L.P. Evans M.L. Smith D.R. Badtke M.P. Chapman M.R. Diversity, biogenesis and function of microbial amyloids.Trends Microbiol. 2012; 20: 66-73Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar), suggesting that such functions are not chance occurrences. Bacterial amyloids have been detected in natural biofilms from a range of aquatic systems, including water reservoirs, seawater, and wastewater treatment-activated sludges (6.Larsen P. Nielsen J.L.

Given their apparent abundance in natural biofilms and the tantalizing prospect of using them to better understand the formation of disease-related amyloids (4.Dueholm M.S. Nielsen P.H. Chapman M.

The curli fibers of Escherichia coli and Salmonella enterica, Fap fibrils of Pseudomonas spp., and TasA of Bacillus subtilis have each received attention (2.Barnhart M.M. Chapman M.R.

Their roles in biofilms have been described variously as those of adhesins, stabilizers (e.g. B. subtilis) (8.Romero D. Aguilar C. Losick R. Kolter R.

They have also been suggested to be virulence determinants, as with the curli fimbriae of enterohemorrhagic, enterotoxigenic, and sepsis-derived strains of E. coli (10.Olsen A. Herwald H. Wikstrom M.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa is an opportunistic bacterial pathogen (12.Ghafoor A. Hay I.D. Rehm B.H.A. Role of exopolysaccharides in Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilm formation and architecture.Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2011; 77: 5238-5246Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). Its virulence is associated with the ability to form biofilms (13.Mathee K. Ciofu O. Sternberg C. Lindum P.W.

Costerton J.W. Stoodley P. Bacterial biofilms: from the natural environment to infectious diseases.Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2004; 2: 95-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (4823) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the extracellular domain of P. aeruginosa biofilms is well understood chemically in terms of the EPS composition and metabolites produced. Thus, P. aeruginosa is often used in biofilm studies, including those addressing the effects of its amyloids on biofilm formation. Dueholm et al. (15.Dueholm M.S. Petersen S.V. S⊘nderkaer M. Larsen P. Christiansen G. Hein K.L. Enghild J.J. Nielsen J.L. Nielsen K.L. Nielsen P.H. Otzen D.E. Functional amyloid in Pseudomonas.Mol. Microbiol. 2010; 77: 1009-1020Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar) discovered a six-gene operon encoding the expression of functional amyloids (fapA–F) in P. aeruginosa, Pseudomonas fluorescens, and Pseudomonas putida. Overexpression of Fap fibrils, which are composed mainly of FapC, has since been shown to increase biofilm formation (9.Dueholm M.S. S⊘ndergaard M.T. Nilsson M. Christiansen G. Stensballe A. Overgaard M.T. Givskov M. Tolker-Nielsen T. Otzen D.E. Nielsen P.H.

Bacteria collectively coordinate their behavior and communicate with each other using quorum-sensing (QS) systems, whereby small molecules are secreted and elicit changes in gene expression in those cells responding to them (16.Dietrich L.E.P. Price-Whelan A. Petersen A. Whiteley M. Newman D.K. The phenazine pyocyanin is a terminal signalling factor in the quorum sensing network of Pseudomonas aeruginosa.Mol. Microbiol. 2006; 61: 1308-1321Crossref PubMed Scopus (522) Google Scholar). Four QS systems have been identified for P. aeruginosa, including the Las and Rhl systems, which employ the autoinducers N-(3-oxododecanoyl)-l-homoserine lactone (3-oxo-C12-HSL) and N-butyryl-l-homoserine lactone, respectively (17.Pearson J.P.

A fatty acid messenger is responsible for inducing dispersion in microbial biofilms.J. Bacteriol. 2009; 191: 1393-1403Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar); and the 4-quinolone signal system, unique to the members of the genus Pseudomonas, which involves 2-heptyl-3-hydroxy-4(1H)-quinolone (PQS) and the transcriptional regulator PqsR (20.Pesci E.C. Milbank J.B.J. Pearson J.P. McKnight S. Kende A.S. Greenberg E.P. Iglewski B.H. Quinolone signaling in the cell-to-cell communication system of Pseudomonas aeruginosa.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1999; 96: 11229-11234Crossref PubMed Scopus (845) Google Scholar). PQS is a putative iron chelator, which positively regulates the Rhl QS system (21.Diggle S.P. Matthijs S. Wright V.J. Fletcher M.P. Chhabra S.R. Lamont I.L. Kong X. Hider R.C. Cornelis P. Cámara M. Williams P. The Pseudomonas aeruginosa 4-quinolone signal molecules HHQ and PQS play multifunctional roles in quorum sensing and iron entrapment.Chem. Biol. 2007; 14: 87-96Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). The Rhl system in turn modifies elastase (LasB) and lectin (LecA) production. Furthermore, the PQS system utilizes the redox shuttle pyocyanin as its terminal signaling factor (16.Dietrich L.E.P. Price-Whelan A. Petersen A. Whiteley M. Newman D.K. The phenazine pyocyanin is a terminal signalling factor in the quorum sensing network of Pseudomonas aeruginosa.Mol. Microbiol. 2006; 61: 1308-1321Crossref PubMed Scopus (522) Google Scholar). Pyocyanin is a heterocyclic compound that belongs to the phenazine group, which when produced by P. aeruginosa enhances bacterial virulence (e.g. in chronic lung infections) and may also provide the bacterium with a competitive advantage as a result of its antimicrobial activity (22.Hunter R.C. Klepac-Ceraj V. Lorenzi M.M. Grotzinger H. Martin T.R. Newman D.K. Phenazine content in the cystic fibrosis respiratory tract negatively correlates with lung function and microbial complexity.Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 2012; 47: 738-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). QS molecules in P. aeruginosa are chemically distinct with different targets and a cascade of integrated and secondary effects that confound our understanding of their phenotypic consequences. However, they are all transmitted extracellularly, and they are all hydrophobic (23.Mashburn-Warren L. Howe J. Garidel P. Richter W. Steiniger F. Roessle M. Brandenburg K. Whiteley M. Interaction of quorum signals with outer membrane lipids: insights into prokaryotic membrane vesicle formation.Mol. Microbiol. 2008; 69: 491-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Although both the P. aeruginosa QS systems and its extracellular matrix have been studied extensively, the importance of possible interactions between the matrix components and QS molecules has not attracted the same level of interest. QS chemicals are transmitted through the extracellular domain. Mashburn and Whiteley (24.Mashburn L.M. Whiteley M. Membrane vesicles traffic signals and facilitate group activities in a prokaryote.Nature. 2005; 437: 422-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar) addressed the question of how transmission of hydrophobic QS molecules might be managed extracellularly by the packaging of a QS molecule into membrane vesicles before export. However, this was specific to PQS. Interactions between extracellular polymers and signaling chemicals are also probably crucial to their movement through biofilms. For example, it is believed that the immediate precursor of PQS, 4-hydroxy-2-heptylquinoline (HHQ), acts as a “messenger” molecule because it is secreted extracellularly and is then converted to PQS by other responding cells (21.Diggle S.P. Matthijs S. Wright V.J. Fletcher M.P. Chhabra S.R. Lamont I.L. Kong X. Hider R.C. Cornelis P. Cámara M. Williams P.

Biol. 2007; 14: 87-96Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). Biofilms can form in flowing, often highly turbulent aquatic environments like rivers or wastewater treatment plants (25.Purevdorj B. Costerton J.W. Stoodley P. Influence of hydrodynamics and cell signaling on the structure and behavior of Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilms.Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2002; 68: 4457-4464Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar, 26.Seviour T. Yuan Z. van Loosdrecht M.C.M. Lin Y. Aerobic sludge granulation: a tale of two polysaccharides?.Water Res. 2012; 46: 4803-4813Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar), where the loss of small molecules by high diffusion rates is a significant challenge for bacteria. These habitats also mostly consist of complex, mixed microbial communities, raising interesting challenges around signal cross-talk and uptake by non-self organisms (14.Hall-Stoodley L. Costerton J.W. Stoodley P. Bacterial biofilms: from the natural environment to infectious diseases.Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2004; 2: 95-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (4823) Google Scholar). Dilution or interception and potential interference or corruption of chemical signals represent a serious challenge to the bacteria. Although it is assumed that the EPS matrix allows biofilms to retain such molecules under non-quiescent conditions (27.Flemming H.-C. Wingender J. The biofilm matrix.Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2010; 8: 623-633Crossref PubMed Scopus (5943) Google Scholar), the ability of a single EPS to facilitate this by a reversible binding process has never been demonstrated. There are currently no high-resolution protein structures of biofilm-associated functional amyloids. However, amyloid fibers of the HET-s(218–289) prion and the β-amyloid peptide (Aβ(1–40)) associated with Alzheimer disease arise from β-solenoids that are stabilized by a hydrophobic triangular core (28.Paravastu A.K. Leapman R.D. Yau W.-M. Tycko R. Molecular structural basis for polymorphism in Alzheimer's β-amyloid fibrils.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 18349-18354Crossref PubMed Scopus (924) Google Scholar, 29.Wasmer C. Lange A. Van Melckebeke H. Siemer A.B. Riek R. Meier B.H. Amyloid fibrils of the HET-s(218–289) prion form a β solenoid with a triangular hydrophobic core.Science. 2008; 319: 1523-1526Crossref PubMed Scopus (826) Google Scholar). The current structural model of the Fap fibrils suggests that their amyloids also contain similar hydrophobic domains (9.Dueholm M.S. S⊘ndergaard M.T. Nilsson M. Christiansen G. Stensballe A. Overgaard M.T. Givskov M. Tolker-Nielsen T. Otzen D.E. Nielsen P.H. Expression of Fap amyloids in Pseudomonas aeruginosa, P. fluorescens, and P. putida results in aggregation and increased biofilm formation.Microbiologyopen. 2013; 2: 365-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Such domains represent potential binding sites for hydrophobic signaling molecules. In the present study, amyloids were identified as an EPS component that may play a role in binding signaling metabolites. We investigated such a functional role by characterizing the binding affinities of QS molecules and other small hydrophobic and non-hydrophobic metabolites to amyloid polymers using surface plasmon resonance (SPR) biosensor technology. We present two important physiological consequences of this binding. Under non-quiescent conditions, amyloids can act as storage reservoirs to enhance information retention and electroconductivity, thus providing the first direct evidence for a specific role for an EPS component of a bacterial biofilm in signal molecule binding. P. aeruginosa PAO1 was obtained from the Genetic Stock Center (strain PAO0001). The PQS reporter strain was constructed by introducing the promoter-probe plasmid pAC37, containing a PpqsA::gfp(ASV) transcriptional fusion, into P. aeruginosa PAO1 ΔpqsC, as described by Yang et al. (30.Yang L. Barken K.B. Skindersoe M.E. Christensen A.B. Givskov M. Tolker-Nielsen T.

The P. aeruginosa PAO1 ΔpqsC mutant, which is unable to synthesize the PQS precursor HHQ, was obtained from a transposon mutagenesis library screen (31.Wang V.B. Chua S.-L. Cao B. Seviour T. Nesatyy V.J. Marsili E. Kjelleberg S. Givskov M. Tolker-Nielsen T. Song H. Loo J.S.C. Yang L.

The 3-oxo-C12-HSL reporter strain was obtained by introducing a PlasB::gfp(ASV) transcriptional fusion and an extra copy of lasR under the influence of the lac promoter, which is constitutively expressed in P. aeruginosa into P. aeruginosa PAO1 ΔlasIΔrhlI via a mini-Tn5 insert, as described by Yang et al. (32.Yang L. Rybtke M.T. Jakobsen T.H. Hentzer M. Bjarnsholt T. Givskov M. Tolker-Nielsen T. Computer-aided identification of recognized drugs as Pseudomonas aeruginosa quorum-sensing inhibitors.Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2009; 53: 2432-2443Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). 3-Oxo-C12-HSL is thus sensed through the LasR reporter, which in turn regulates the lasB promoter (32.Yang L. Rybtke M.T. Jakobsen T.H. Hentzer M. Bjarnsholt T. Givskov M. Tolker-Nielsen T. Computer-aided identification of recognized drugs as Pseudomonas aeruginosa quorum-sensing inhibitors.Antimicrob.

Construction of the isogenic P. aeruginosa PAO1 ΔlasIΔrhlI strain, which is unable to synthesize 3-oxo-C12-HSL, is described elsewhere (33.Hentzer M. Wu H. Andersen J.B. Riedel K. Rasmussen T.B.

Attenuation of Pseudomonas aeruginosa virulence by quorum sensing inhibitors.EMBO J. 2003; 22: 3803-3815Crossref PubMed Scopus (1118) Google Scholar). PQS and HHQ were synthesized as described previously (21.Diggle S.P. Matthijs S. Wright V.J. Fletcher M.P. Chhabra S.R. Lamont I.L. Kong X. Hider R.C. Cornelis P. Cámara M. Williams P.

Biol. 2007; 14: 87-96Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar), and 25 mm stock solutions were prepared by dissolution in DMSO (25 mm). A stock solution of pyocyanin from P. aeruginosa (from Sigma-Aldrich) (480 μm) was prepared in DMSO. A synthetic gene corresponding to the mature FapC protein from P. aeruginosa PAO1 flanked by XbaI and XhoI restriction sites was designed using CLC Main Workbench version 6.0 and synthesized by GenScript (Germany). The synthetic gene was cloned into the pET32b(+) vector (Novagen) using the XbaI and XhoI restriction sites. This added a C-terminal His tag to the construct. The plasmid was transformed into E. coli BL21(DE3) (Invitrogen). Protein expression was carried out in 500 ml of LB medium (37 °C, 200 rpm). Induction was done with 1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside at A600 nm = 0.7–1.2, and cells were harvested 3 h after induction by centrifugation (10,000 × g, 30 min). The cell pellet was resuspended in 25 ml of extraction buffer (6 m guanidinium chloride, 20 mm potassium phosphate, 500 mm NaCl, pH 7.4) and sonicated three times for 1 min each. The sample was placed on ice for 1 min between sonications. The lysate was then incubated overnight at 4 °C with gentle shaking. Insoluble material was pelleted by centrifugation (20,000 × g, 30 min). The His-tagged FapC proteins were isolated from the supernatant using a 5-ml HisTrap HP column (GE Healthcare) and an elution buffer corresponding to the extraction buffer containing 500 mm imidazole. Purified monomers in elution buffer were desalted using a PD-10 desalting column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated with deionized water. Protein concentration was estimated by UV absorbance of the peptide bond using the following extinction coefficient for the recombinant protein: ϵ280 nm = 0.701 cm−1·(g/liter)−1. The protein was diluted in deionized water to 1 mg/ml and mixed with an equal amount of buffer (100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4) supplemented with 50 μg/ml sonicated native Fap fibrils, which acted as a template to ensure the assembly of FapC fibrils with a native structure. The native Fap fibrils were purified from P. aeruginosa PAO1 overexpressing the fap operon as described by Dueholm et al. (9.Dueholm M.S. S⊘ndergaard M.T. Nilsson M. Christiansen G. Stensballe A. Overgaard M.T. Givskov M. Tolker-Nielsen T. Otzen D.E. Nielsen P.H. Expression of Fap amyloids in Pseudomonas aeruginosa, P. fluorescens, and P. putida results in aggregation and increased biofilm formation.Microbiologyopen. 2013; 2: 365-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). 200-μl samples were loaded in a 96-well plate. Thioflavin T was added to a final concentration of 40 μm in a subset of the wells to visualize the fibrillation process. Immediately afterward, the plate was transferred to a Tecan GENios Pro plate reader, and ThT fluorescence was measured using excitation at 448 nm, emission at 485 nm, and a gain of 60. Measurements were obtained by bottom reads every 2 min, and 30 s of shaking (orbital, amplitude 2.5 mm) was applied between the reads. Reads were integrated for 40 μs. Three fibrillation curves were averaged to reduce the signal/noise ratio. The samples without ThT were collected, sonicated, and used to seed a new generation of recombinant FapC fibrils as described above. This step was repeated twice to ensure a uniform fibril batch without non-protein contaminants originating from the native fibrils. Recombinant α-synuclein was purified and fibrillated in vitro by shaking-induced fibrillation as described elsewhere (34.Lorenzen N. Lemminger L. Pedersen J.N. Nielsen S.B. Otzen D.E. The N-terminus of α-synuclein is essential for both monomeric and oligomeric interactions with membranes.FEBS Lett. 2014; 588: 497-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Amyloid fibrils were mounted on 400-mesh carbon-coated, glow-discharged nickel grids for 30 s. Grids were washed with one drop of double-distilled water and stained with three drops of 10 μg/ml phosphotungstic acid at pH 7.2. Samples were inspected in a transmission electron microscope (JEOL, 1010) at 60 kV. Images were obtained using an electron-sensitive CCD camera (Olympus, KeenView). For size determination, a cross-line carbon replica grid (2160 lines/mm) was used. FTIR was carried out using a Tensor 27 (Bruker) FTIR spectrophotometer equipped with a DTGS mid-infrared detector and a Golden Gate single reflection diamond attenuated total reflectance cell (Specac). Fibrils were dried on the attenuated total reflectance crystal using dry nitrogen. Attenuated total reflectance spectra were recorded from 4000 to 1000 cm−1 using a nominal resolution of 2 cm−1 and 128 accumulations. Resulting spectra were baseline-corrected, and interfering signals from H2O and CO2 were removed using the atmospheric compensation filter in the OPUS version 5.5 system (Bruker). Circular dichroism (CD) spectra from 250 to 190 nm were collected on a Jasco J-810 spectropolarimeter using 0.2-nm steps, a scan speed of 50 nm/min, a bandwidth of 1 nm, and a response time of 1 s. A 1-mm quartz cuvette (Hellma) was used, and the temperature was kept constant at 20 °C with a thermostatically controlled cell holder (Jasco PTC 423S). The protein concentration was diluted to 0.1 mg/ml with double-distilled H2O, and all spectra were baseline-corrected with respect to double-distilled H2O. To improve the signal/noise ratio, five scans were averaged on each sample. Data points with a high tension voltage higher than 600 V were removed. The results were expressed as mean residue ellipticity. FapC fibrils washed in double-distilled H2O were resupended in HBS-EP (10 mm HEPES, 150 mm NaCl, 3 mm EDTA, and 50 μm P20 (GE Healthcare), pH 7.4). Amyloid fibers were fragmented by sonication (80 Hz, 10 s) and centrifuged (14,000 × g, 30 s) to remove any large particles. 40 μl of centrate was mixed with 120 μl of 10 mm sodium acetate, pH 5.5, for the immobilization. SPR experiments were performed at 25 °C using Biacore T-200 biosensor with research grade carboxymethylated (CM5S) sensor chips (Biacore, Uppsala, Sweden) with the exception of the binding of Congo Red, which was done in a Biacore 3000 instrument. Carboxymethylated CM5S chips were activated using 70 μl of 0.2 m N-ethyl-N′-(dimethylaminopropyl)carbodimide and 0.05 m N-hydroxysuccinimide in a 1:1 ratio. 100 μl of amyloids in sodium acetate solution (10 mm, pH 4.5) were injected over the activated surface, and an immo"

Since they can be released by virtually any cell lineages and are retrieved in biological fluids, microparticles appear as potent biomarkers. However, the small dimensions of microparticles and soluble factors present in body fluids can considerably impede their quantification. Here, flow cytometry with improved methodology for microparticle resolution was used to detect microparticles of human and mouse species generated from platelets, red blood cells, endothelial cells, apoptotic thymocytes and cells from the male reproductive tract. A family of soluble proteins, the secreted phospholipases A2 (sPLA2), comprises enzymes concomitantly expressed with microparticles in biological fluids and that catalyze the hydrolysis of membrane phospholipids. As sPLA2 can hydrolyze phosphatidylserine, a phospholipid frequently used to assess microparticles, and might even clear microparticles, we further considered the impact of relevant sPLA2 enzymes, sPLA2 group IIA, V and X, on microparticle quantification. We observed that if enriched in fluids, certain sPLA2 enzymes impair the quantification of microparticles depending on the species studied, the source of microparticles and the means of detection employed (surface phosphatidylserine or protein antigen detection). This study provides analytical considerations for appropriate interpretation of microparticle cytofluorometric measurements in biological samples containing sPLA2 enzymes."
https://openalex.org/W2041984540,"Acute and chronic pain conditions are often debilitating, inflicting severe physiological, emotional and economic costs and affect a large percentage of the global population. However, the development of therapeutic analgesic agents based primarily on targeted drug development has been largely ineffective. An alternative approach to analgesic development would be to develop low cost, high throughput, untargeted animal based behavioral screens that model complex nociceptive behaviors in which to screen for analgesic compounds. Here we describe the development of a behavioral based assay in zebrafish larvae that is effective in identifying small molecule compounds with analgesic properties. In a place aversion assay, which likely utilizes supraspinal neuronal circuitry, individually arrayed zebrafish larvae show temperature-dependent aversion to increasing and decreasing temperatures deviating from rearing temperature. Modeling thermal hyperalgesia, the addition of the noxious inflammatory compound and TRPA1 agonist allyl isothiocyanate sensitized heat aversion and reversed cool aversion leading larvae to avoid rearing temperature in favor of otherwise acutely aversive cooler temperatures. We show that small molecules with known analgesic properties are able to inhibit acute and/or sensitized temperature aversion."

https://openalex.org/W2014637503,"The pink stem borer, Sesamia inferens, which is endemic in China and other parts of Asia, is a major pest of rice and causes significant yield loss in this host plant. Very few studies have addressed gene expression in S. inferens. Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) is currently the most accurate and sensitive method for gene expression analysis. In qRT-PCR, data are normalized using reference genes, which help control for internal differences and reduce error between samples. In this study, seven candidate reference genes, 18S ribosomal RNA (18S rRNA), elongation factor 1 (EF1), glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), ribosomal protein S13 (RPS13), ribosomal protein S20 (RPS20), tubulin (TUB), and β-actin (ACTB) were evaluated for their suitability in normalizing gene expression under different experimental conditions. The results indicated that three genes (RPS13, RPS20, and EF1) were optimal for normalizing gene expression in different insect tissues (head, epidermis, fat body, foregut, midgut, hindgut, Malpighian tubules, haemocytes, and salivary glands). 18S rRNA, EF1, and GAPDH were best for normalizing expression with respect to developmental stages and sex (egg masses; first, second, third, fourth, fifth, and sixth instar larvae; male and female pupae; and one-day-old male and female adults). 18S rRNA, RPS20, and TUB were optimal for fifth instars exposed to different temperatures (−8, −6, −4, −2, 0, and 27°C). To validate this recommendation, the expression profile of a target gene heat shock protein 83 gene (hsp83) was investigated, and results showed the selection was necessary and effective. In conclusion, this study describes reference gene sets that can be used to accurately measure gene expression in S. inferens."
https://openalex.org/W2086173562,"In this study we isolated novel bacteriophages, infecting the zoonotic bacterium Campylobacter jejuni. These phages may be used in phage therapy of C. jejuni colonized poultry to prevent spreading of the bacteria to meat products causing disease in humans. Many C. jejuni phages have been isolated using NCTC12662 as the indicator strain, which may have biased the selection of phages. A large group of C. jejuni phages rely on the highly diverse capsular polysaccharide (CPS) for infection and recent work identified the O-methyl phosphoramidate modification (MeOPN) of CPS as a phage receptor. We therefore chose seven C. jejuni strains each expressing different CPS structures as indicator strains in a large screening for phages in samples collected from free-range poultry farms. Forty-three phages were isolated using C. jejuni NCTC12658, NCTC12662 and RM1221 as host strains and 20 distinct phages were identified based on host range analysis and genome restriction profiles. Most phages were isolated using C. jejuni strains NCTC12662 and RM1221 and interestingly phage genome size (140 kb vs. 190 kb), host range and morphological appearance correlated with the isolation strain. Thus, according to C. jejuni phage grouping, NCTC12662 and NCTC12658 selected for CP81-type phages, while RM1221 selected for CP220-type phages. Furthermore, using acapsular ∆kpsM mutants we demonstrated that phages isolated on NCTC12658 and NCTC12662 were dependent on the capsule for infection. In contrast, CP220-type phages isolated on RM1221 were unable to infect non-motile ∆motA mutants, hence requiring motility for successful infection. Hence, the primary phage isolation strain determines both phage type (CP81 or CP220) as well as receptors (CPS or flagella) recognised by the isolated phages."

Pulldown assays from Arabidopsis thaliana tissue culture extracts with the mitochondrial MORF1 and the plastid MORF2 proteins, respectively, both identify the dual-targeted MORF8 protein, showing that these complexes can assemble in the organelles. We have now determined the scope of potential interactions between the various MORF proteins by yeast two-hybrid, in vitro pulldown, and bimolecular fluorescence complementation assays.

In addition, another protein group with at least one degenerated central MORF sequence seems involved in RNA editing (20.Sun T. Germain A. Giloteaux L. Hammani K. Barkan A. Hanson M.R. Bentolila S. An RNA recognition motif-containing protein is required for plastid RNA editing in Arabidopsis and maize.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Plant. 2014; 7: 582-585Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). MORF proteins are required for all RNA editing events in plastids and for many, possibly also all, sites in mitochondria of A. thaliana. In plastids, the two MORFs targeted exclusively to this organelle, MORF2 and MORF9, are both required for editing at several sites (18.Takenaka M. Zehrmann A. Verbitskiy D. Kugelmann M. Härtel B. Brennicke A. MORF family proteins are required for RNA editing in mitochondria and plastids of plants.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Other plastid sites depend on both proteins for efficient editing, either of the two MORFs providing only a low level of nucleotide conversion. In addition, the presence or absence of MORF8 (RIP1) influences editing at sites targeted by MORF2 and/or MORF9 (18.Takenaka M. Zehrmann A. Verbitskiy D. Kugelmann M. Härtel B. Brennicke A.

Similarly in mitochondria, MORF1 and MORF3 are required at some editing sites, whereas at other sites, only MORF8 and MORF1 together sustain full editing levels (18.Takenaka M. Zehrmann A.

These observations suggest that different MORFs act in concert at some RNA editing events and that therefore MORFs are likely to contact each other. To investigate potential physical contacts between MORF proteins, we have now analyzed all possible MORF to MORF connections and report the homomer and heteromer MORF-MORF interactome. Identification of proteins interacting in vivo with MORF1 and MORF2, respectively, by affinity purification-mass spectrometry analysis was done with PSB-D A. thaliana cell suspension cultures essentially as described by Van Leene et al. (24.Van Leene J. Eeckhout D. Persiau G. Van De Slijke E. Geerinck J. Van Isterdael G. Witters E. De Jaeger G. Isolation of transcription factor complexes from Arabidopsis cell suspension cultures by tandem affinity purification.Methods Mol. Biol. 2011; 754: 195-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Open reading frames of MORF1 and MORF2 were cloned into pENTR1A (Life Technologies) and transferred into the pKCTAP vector with 35S promoter sequences in pEN-L4-2-R1 by the multisite Gateway LR reaction (Life Technologies) for constitutive expression of fusion proteins with a C-terminal tag combining the immunoglobulin G (IgG)-binding domains of protein G followed by the streptavidin-binding peptide (GS-tag). Transformation of PSB-D suspension culture cells was achieved as described (24.Van Leene J. Eeckhout D. Persiau G. Van De Slijke E. Geerinck J. Van Isterdael G. Witters E. De Jaeger G. Isolation of transcription factor complexes from Arabidopsis cell suspension cultures by tandem affinity purification.Methods Mol. Biol. 2011; 754: 195-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Protein complexes of MORF1 and MORF2 were tandem affinity-purified by IgG Sepharose and streptavidin Sepharose (GE Healthcare, Little Chalfont, UK) from 15 g of cells. Total protein in the purified fraction was concentrated by trichloroacetic acid precipitation and subjected to SDS-PAGE on 10 or 12% gels. Gels were stained by colloidal Coomassie Blue staining (25.Candiano G. Bruschi M. Musante L. Santucci L. Ghiggeri G.M. Carnemolla B. Orecchia P. Zardi L. Righetti P.G. Blue silver: a very sensitive colloidal Coomassie G-250 staining for proteome analysis.Electrophoresis. 2004; 25: 1327-1333Crossref PubMed Scopus (1590) Google Scholar), and gel pieces containing proteins with various molecular masses were excised. In-gel tryptic digestion and LC-MS/MS protein identification were performed as described by Obata et al. (26.Obata T. Matthes A. Koszior S. Lehmann M. Araújo W.L. Bock R. Sweetlove L.J. Fernie A.R. Alteration of mitochondrial protein complexes in relation to metabolic regulation under short-term oxidative stress in Arabidopsis seedlings.Phytochemistry. 2011; 72: 1081-1091Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Database search was with Mascot 2.2 (Matrix Science Ltd., London, UK) setting criteria as described (26.Obata T. Matthes A. Koszior S. Lehmann M. Araújo W.L. Bock R. Sweetlove L.J. Fernie A.R.

The hits with probability-based Mowse scores above 50 were considered. Heat shock proteins were omitted from the analysis because they are supposed to interact with misfolded proteins caused by overexpression under the control of 35S promoter. Growth of the A. thaliana plants and preparation of chloroplasts and DNA or RNA from leaves were as described (27.Takenaka M. Brennicke A.

Leaves were harvested after 5–6 weeks of growth. Specific cDNA fragments were generated by RT-PCR amplification following established protocols with respectively designed primers (27.Takenaka M.

Humana Press, Springer, Heidelberg2011: 163-169Crossref Scopus (3) Google Scholar). The cDNA sequences were compared for C to T differences resulting from RNA editing. RNA editing levels were estimated by the relative area under the respective nucleotide peaks in the sequence analyses. The MORF genes were cloned in the pCF203 vector fused at their C terminus to the YFP open reading frame under expression control by the 35S promoter. The mitochondrial marker RFP was cloned as an in-frame fusion to the AOX1 target signal sequence (mtRFP1). Constructs were infiltrated into N. benthamiana leaf cells as described (29.Walter M.

Fluorescent protein tagging as a tool to define the subcellular distribution of proteins in plants.Front. Plant Sci. 2013; 4: 214Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Plants were grown on soil for 2 days, and epidermal cell layers were analyzed. Chloroplasts of the transiently transfected N. benthamiana leaf cells were identified by chlorophyll autofluorescence. Mitochondria were identified by the signal from the RFP marker. The fluorescent signals and the bright field images were obtained with the respective wavelength filters with a Leica TCS SP5 confocal microscope (Leica Microsystems, Heidelberg, Germany). YFP open reading frame N- and C-terminal fragments (amino acids 1–155 and 156–238, respectively) were fused to the individual MORF protein reading frames in the vector pMDC123 (33.Curtis M.D. Grossniklaus U. A gateway cloning vector set for high-throughput functional analysis of genes in planta.Plant Physiol. 2003; 133: 462-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (1958) Google Scholar), containing the multiple cloning site from pET41 (Merck Millipore, Novagen), and in the YFP/YFP-N/YFP-C cassettes, respectively. Transformation into N. benthamiana leaves and expression analysis was as detailed above. Images were adjusted for brightness and contrast to improve quality and clarity. The coding sequences of MORFs with their native termination codons and the vectors were amplified with respective primers to add 15-nucleotide adaptors for cloning via the In-Fusion HD cloning system (Clontech Laboratories). Open reading frames were integrated into the bait (pGBKT7) and prey (pGADT7) vectors of the Matchmaker GAL4 Two-Hybrid System 3 (Clontech Laboratories) for expression in yeast cells (PJ69-4A) according to the protocol and other publications (34.Braun P.

Genomic libraries and a host strain designed for highly efficient two-hybrid selection in yeast.Genetics. 1996; 144: 1425-1436Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Yeast cells were generally grown on medium lacking leucine and tryptophan for selective pressure to maintain the respective plasmids. To obtain clear signals and to lower the rate of false positives, biosynthesis of histidine and biosynthesis of adenine were measured together as reporters on the respective selective medium. Drop assays were done as described in the next paragraph. The coding sequence of MORF1 in the pGBKT7 vector was successively shortened by PCR, and the respective fragments were cloned in pGBKT7 via In-Fusion. Growth was assayed on synthetic dropout medium lacking adenine, histidine, leucine, and tryptophan and for rigorous probing also containing 2.5 mm 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole. In each assay, 5 μl of an overnight liquid culture adjusted to A600 nm of 0.3 was dropped to the agar medium plate. MORF proteins were expressed as fusion proteins with maltose-binding protein (MBP) label at their N termini on the one hand and N-terminal GST and His tags and GFP labels at the C termini on the other hand. GST-His-GFP-tagged proteins were purified from Escherichia coli via nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (Qiagen) followed by a purification step with glutathione agarose (Sigma). MBP-tagged MORFs were bound to an amylose resin (New England Biolabs). To test for interactions between different MORF proteins, 10 μl of amylose resin saturated with one of the MORF proteins was incubated for 1 h at 4 °C with 10 μg of the respective other GFP-tagged MORF protein. Resins were boiled for 5 min in SDS-loading dye after five washing steps, and proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE on two gels in parallel. After blotting, proteins bound to the resin were detected by an anti-MBP antibody (New England Biolabs), and the respective pulled down GFP-labeled MORF proteins were identified with an anti-GFP antibody (Roche Applied Science). Our previous in vitro co-immunoprecipitation and yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) analyses suggested the possible formation of homo- and heteromers of MORF proteins (18.Takenaka M. Zehrmann A. Verbitskiy D. Kugelmann M. Härtel B. Brennicke A. MORF family proteins are required for RNA editing in mitochondria and plastids of plants.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2012; 109: 5104-5109Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). To analyze whether MORF-MORF interactions indeed occur in vivo, we initiated tandem affinity purification studies in A. thaliana tissue culture cells. The MORF1 and MORF2 proteins, respectively, were introduced as GS-tagged constructs into the genomes of tissue culture cells (24.Van Leene J. Eeckhout D. Persiau G. Van De Slijke E. Geerinck J.

These bait proteins were immobilized on beads, and the attached proteins were analyzed by tandem mass spectrometry. Both the mitochondrially located MORF1 and the plastid MORF2 proteins pulled down the dual-targeted MORF8 protein among the prominent co-purifying proteins (Table 1). This finding suggests that MORF proteins can interact with each other in both plant organelles, mitochondria and plastids. To fathom the scale and specificity of MORF-MORF protein interactions, we now investigated all possible combinations, including the formation of homomers by yeast-2-hybrid assays, by pulldown assays, and by bimolecular fluorescence complementation in plant cells.TABLE 1Identification of MORF8 co-purified with MORF1 and MORF2BaitCo-purified proteinsDescriptionFoundaTimes of detection in two experimental repetitions.Best scorebThe highest probability-based Mowse score calculated by MASCOT in the two experimental repeats.Protein massPeptide matchesDescriptionAccession numberMORF1AT3G15000.1MORF82174430147MORF2AT3G15000.1MORF8189430142a Times of detection in two experimental repetitions.b The highest probability-based Mowse score calculated by MASCOT in the two experimental repeats. Open table in a new tab To be able to interpret the functional relevance of MORF protein interactions in the plant cell, we first analyzed their intracellular location with YFP fused to the respective MORF open reading frame in transiently transfected tobacco cells.

https://openalex.org/W2030784617,"Niche complementarity in resource use has been proposed as a key mechanism to explain the positive effects of increasing plant species richness on ecosystem processes, in particular on primary productivity. Since hardly any information is available for niche complementarity in water use, we tested the effects of plant diversity on spatial and temporal complementarity in water uptake in experimental grasslands by using stable water isotopes. We hypothesized that water uptake from deeper soil depths increases in more diverse compared to low diverse plant species mixtures. We labeled soil water in 8 cm (with 18O) and 28 cm depth (with ²H) three times during the 2011 growing season in 40 temperate grassland communities of varying species richness (2, 4, 8 and 16 species) and functional group number and composition (legumes, grasses, tall herbs, small herbs). Stable isotope analyses of xylem and soil water allowed identifying the preferential depth of water uptake. Higher enrichment in 18O of xylem water than in ²H suggested that the main water uptake was in the upper soil layer. Furthermore, our results revealed no differences in root water uptake among communities with different species richness, different number of functional groups or with time. Thus, our results do not support the hypothesis of increased complementarity in water use in more diverse than in less diverse communities of temperate grassland species."
https://openalex.org/W1977038143,"The interaction of influenza A viruses with the cell surface is controlled by the surface glycoproteins hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA). These two glycoproteins have opposing activities: HA is responsible for binding the host receptor (sialic acid) to allow infection, and NA is responsible for cleaving the receptor to facilitate virus release. Several studies have demonstrated that compatible levels of HA and NA activity are required for a virus to replicate efficiently. This is consequently of great interest for determining virus transmissibility. The concurrent role of these two proteins in receptor binding has never been directly measured. We demonstrate a novel biophysical approach based on bio-layer interferometry to measure the balance of the activities of these two proteins in real time.

Bio-layer interferometry measurements were also carried out to determine the effect of altering HA receptor affinity and NA stalk length on receptor binding. Understanding the transmissibility of influenza A viruses (IAVs) 2The abbreviations used are: IAVsinfluenza A virusesHAhemagglutininNAneuraminidaseBLIbio-layer interferometry6SLNα2,6-sialyl-N-acetyllactosamine3SLNα2,3-sialyl-N-acetyllactosamineRSLrelative sugar loadingMUNANA2′-(4-methylumbelliferyl)-α-d-N-acetylneuraminic acid. is vital to monitoring new and emerging viral variants and understanding previous pandemics and their emergence. A major factor underlying IAV transmissibility is the interaction of the virus with the cell surface, which is mediated by two virus surface glycoproteins: hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA). HA acts as the receptor-binding protein, binding to the cell-surface receptor (sialic acid), and is a major factor in determining the host restriction of IAVs. The receptor specificity of HA is attuned to the sialic acid linkage present at the primary site of infection. Avian viruses typically bind to α2,3-linked sialic acid, and human viruses bind primarily to α2,6-linked sialic acid (1.Skehel J.J. Wiley D.C. Receptor binding and membrane fusion in virus entry: the influenza hemagglutinin.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 531-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (2221) Google Scholar). NA is a sialidase and therefore acts as a receptor-destroying enzyme. NA is responsible for cleaving sialic acid, to which the virus may be bound, at various points in the infection cycle. This cleavage can result in release of the virus from the cell surface after infection, prevention of aggregation by virus binding to the glycoproteins of nearby viruses (2.Palese P. Compans R.W. Inhibition of influenza virus replication in tissue culture by 2-deoxy-2,3-dehydro-N-trifluoroacetylneuraminic acid (FANA): mechanism of action.J. Gen.

It has long been hypothesized that there is a balance between the functions of HA and NA. Both the receptor-binding avidity of HA and the receptor-destroying activity must be in the correct proportions for the virus to efficiently infect and transmit (6.Wagner R. Matrosovich M. Klenk H.-D. Functional balance between haemagglutinin and neuraminidase in influenza virus infections.Rev. Med. Virol. 2002; 12: 159-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar). These HA- and NA-mediated receptor interactions are controlled by a number of physical characteristics of the virus and associated proteins: 1) HA receptor-binding affinity (Kd); 2) NA kinetic characteristics (Km and kcat); 3) the relative proportions and distribution of HA and NA on the virus surface; 4) virus morphology, which could alter protein distribution; and 5) the accessibility of NA to the substrate, which can be modulated by altering the length of the stalk between the catalytic region of the protein and the viral membrane. Extensive studies in the past have shown an interdependence of HA and NA activities. These studies are generally related to altering the activity of HA or NA and observing the relative infectivity or compensatory mutations that occur after passage. Studies involving the inhibition of NA with inhibitors have shown that escape mutants can be generated with substitutions in HA alone (7.McKimm-Breschkin J.L. Blick T.J. Sahasrabudhe A. Tiong T.

Genetic analysis reveals that both haemagglutinin and neuraminidase determine the sensitivity of naturally occurring avian influenza viruses to zanamivir in vitro.Virology. 1999; 263: 323-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). These substitutions are hypothesized to reduce HA binding, allowing efficient release of virus with reduced NA activity. Previous studies have also demonstrated that when HA affinity is altered by glycosylation, there is a requirement for a complementary amount of activity from NA for efficient replication in tissue culture (10.Kaverin N.V.

Postreassortment changes in influenza A virus hemagglutinin restoring HA-NA functional match.Virology. 1998; 244: 315-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). We have developed a method for measuring HA/NA balance by using a biophysical technique, bio-layer interferometry (BLI), to measure the binding and release of virus from immobilized receptor analogs on a biosensor surface in real time, allowing measurements of the kinetics of these interactions. This technique was implemented to measure the binding of viruses to receptor analogs, allowing the dissection of the role of HA and NA in controlling receptor binding. The HA/NA balance measurements were compared, measuring binding to α2,6- and α2,3-linked sialic acid receptor analogs and examining the changes in binding patterns seen when altering previously studied virus characteristics. Virus stocks of X-31 (a high-growth reassortant containing the HA and NA genes of strain A/Aichi/2/68 and the remaining genes of strain A/Puerto Rico/8/34) and X-31 HAM (horse adsorption mutant, X-31 with an L226Q substitution in HA) were obtained from the World Health Organization Collaborating Centre for Reference and Research on Influenza, MRC National Institute for Medical Research (London, United Kingdom). Viruses were propagated in the allantoic cavities of 11–12-day-old hen eggs. Allantoic fluid was harvested after 48–72 h. X-31 NAΔ10 was generated by cloning X-31 HA and NA from generated cDNAs into the pHW2000 vector based on a previously described system (11.Hoffmann E. Neumann G. Kawaoka Y. Hobom G. Webster R.G. A DNA transfection system for generation of influenza A virus from eight plasmids.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2000; 97: 6108-6113Crossref PubMed Scopus (1212) Google Scholar). Residues 60–69 of NA were deleted using a Q5 site-directed mutagenesis kit (New England Biolabs) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Recombinant viruses were generated by transfecting 293T cells with plasmids containing X-31 HA and NA and the remaining six gene segments from A/Puerto Rico/8/34. Eggs were directly infected with the transfection supernatant. Allantoic fluid was clarified by low-speed centrifugation. The virus was pelleted and then purified through a continuous 15–40% (w/v) sucrose gradient. Virus-containing bands were pelleted and stored in PBS and 0.01% (w/v) sodium azide at 4 °C. Virus concentration was determined by solid-phase nucleoprotein ELISA (12.Lin Y.P. Xiong X. Wharton S.A. Martin S.R. Coombs P.J. Vachieri S.G. Christodoulou E. Walker P.A. Liu J. Skehel J.J. Gamblin S.J. Hay A.J. Daniels R.S. McCauley J.W. Evolution of the receptor binding properties of the influenza A(H3N2) hemagglutinin.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2012; 109: 21474-21479Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Virus binding was measured using an Octet RED system (Pall ForteBio Corp., Menlo Park, CA). The receptor analogs used were sialoglycopolymers consisting of a polyacrylamide backbone conjugated to 20 mol % sugar (α2,6-sialyl-N-acetyllactosamine (6SLN) or α2,3-sialyl-N-acetyllactosamine (3SLN)) and 5 mol % biotin (Lectinity Holdings, Moscow, Russia). Sugars were loaded onto streptavidin biosensors (Pall ForteBio Corp.) at 0.5 μg/ml for 600 s to saturate the sensors to a maximum response of ∼0.6 nm. Binding of 100 pm virus was measured for 1 h. All experiments were carried out in 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 0.005% (v/v) Tween 20, and 4 mm CaCl2 at 25 °C. In some experiments, all solutions also contained both of the NA inhibitors at 100 μm (oseltamivir carboxylate (Roche Products Ltd., Welwyn Garden City, United Kingdom) and zanamivir (GlaxoSmithKline, Stevenage, United Kingdom)) to prevent cleavage of the receptor analogs by viral NA. Virus binding data obtained in the presence of NA inhibitors underlie the calculations used here and are shown in Fig. 1C. These data show fractional saturation of the sensor (f) as a function of the relative sugar loading (RSL) and were fitted to a modified version of the Hill equation (Equation 1), f=RSLnRSL0.5n+RSLn(Eq. 1) where RSL0.5 is the RSL when f = 0.5, and n is the Hill coefficient. The fractional saturation values at different sugar loadings can be converted to an apparent equilibrium dissociation constant (Kd) for virus binding using Equation 2. Kd=[virus](1−f)f(Eq. 2) The association rate constant for virus binding (kon) in the presence of NA inhibitors was determined by measuring the observed rate for binding (kobs) as a function of virus concentration. The kon value for X-31 and X-31 HAM was found to be ∼4 × 107 m−1 s−1 for both 6SLN and 3SLN and, to a first approximation, was found to be independent of RSL. An approximate dissociation rate constant for the virus at any particular sugar loading can then be calculated (koff = kon × Kd), and this gives the mean residence time of the virus on the sensor calculated as 1/koff. Virus binding measurements performed in the absence of NA inhibitors were designed to assess how rapidly NA could cleave sugars on the sensor surface. These sugar depletion experiments were carried out by allowing the virus to bind in the absence of NA inhibitors for different preset times (ranging from 30 to 3600 s), after which NA inhibitors (100 μm) were added, and the association was allowed to proceed to completion. Dividing the amplitude of the final response by the maximum response observed in experiments performed in the presence of NA inhibitors gave the fractional saturation value (f). These f values for the different preset times were then converted to RSL values using Equation 1 rearranged as follows (Equation 3). RSL=f⋅RSL0.5n1−fn(Eq. 3) These RSL values were then converted to a percentage of initial saturated loading (0.6 nm) and plotted as a function of time. NA was purified from bromelain-treated purified virus as described previously (13.van der Vries E. Collins P.J. Vachieri S.G. Xiong X. Liu J. Walker P.A. Haire L.F. Hay A.J. Schutten M.

Enzymatic parameters for the NA substrate 2′-(4-methylumbelliferyl)-α-d-N-acetylneuraminic acid (MUNANA; Sigma) were measured in a continuous assay in a Jasco FP-6300 spectrofluorometer as described previously (14.Collins P.J. Haire L.F. Lin Y.P. Liu J. Russell R.J. Walker P.A. Skehel J.J. Martin S.R. Hay A.J. Gamblin S.J. Crystal structures of oseltamivir-resistant influenza virus neuraminidase mutants.Nature. 2008; 453: 1258-1261Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar). MUNANA concentrations ranging from 5 to 75 μm were used. Measurements were made in 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 0.005% (v/v) Tween 20, and 4 mm CaCl2 at 37 °C. NA kinetic parameters for the natural substrates 6SLN and 3SLN (Dextra Laboratories) were determined using an assay previously used to measure IAV NA kinetics (15.Cabezas J.A. Calvo P. Eid P. Martin J. Perez E. Reglero A. Hannoun C. Neuraminidase from influenza virus A (H3N2). Specificity towards several substrates and procedure of activity determination.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1980; 616: 228-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). This assay uses β-galactosidase (Sigma) and β-galactose dehydrogenase (Roche Products Ltd.) as reporter enzymes. Each 100-μl reaction contained 25 units of β-galactosidase, 0.25 units of β-galactose dehydrogenase, and 5 mm NAD+ (Sigma) in 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 0.005% (v/v) Tween 20, 4 mm CaCl2, and 1 mm MgCl2 at 37 °C. Reactions were monitored by measuring absorbance at 340 nm in a 10-mm path length cuvette using a Jasco V-550 spectrometer, and initial reaction rates were measured. This change in absorbance was converted to change in concentration using the extinction coefficient of NADH (ϵ = 6220 m−1 cm−1). The results of kinetic assays were fitted to the Michaelis-Menten equation using GraphPad Prism 6 (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA). To study HA/NA balance, we used a modified version of a previously published virus binding assay using BLI (12.Lin Y.P. Xiong X. Wharton S.A. Martin S.R. Coombs P.J. Vachieri S.G. Christodoulou E. Walker P.A. Liu J. Skehel J.J. Gamblin S.J. Hay A.J. Daniels R.S. McCauley J.W. Evolution of the receptor binding properties of the influenza A(H3N2) hemagglutinin.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2012; 109: 21474-21479Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). This modified assay measures virus binding to receptor analogs in the presence and absence of NA inhibitors. Fig. 1A shows the results from this assay measuring the interaction of a 1968 pandemic high-growth reassortant H3N2 virus (X-31) on sensors saturated with human α2,6-linked and avian α2,3-linked sialic acid receptor analogs (6SLN and 3SLN). The two curves with inhibited NA are very similar in shape. Initially, the virus binding with uninhibited NA parallels the virus binding with inhibited NA, but after a short time, the curves for the virus with uninhibited NA reverse direction, exhibiting an inflection point, and eventually decay to very low virus binding levels. Curves for X-31 binding to 6SLN and 3SLN in the absence of NA inhibitors are similar in shape, but the overall binding level is much lower with 3SLN. Similar curve shapes are found when inhibiting viral NA and complementing the solution with soluble bacterial NA (data not shown). The striking observation that the curves for the virus with uninhibited NA reverse direction at the point where the control curves (virus with inhibited NA) indicate that the sensor surface is only partially saturated with virus suggests that uninhibited NA is able to rapidly remove substantial amounts of sugar from the sensor surface. The difference between the two curves (inhibited and uninhibited) must of course be due to the action of NA. To determine the effect of NA on surface-immobilized sugars, we estimated the extent to which sugar became depleted as a function of time by measuring the remaining capacity of the sensor to bind the virus at various set time points (see “Experimental Procedures”). These data for X-31 are shown in Fig. 1B. For both receptor analogs, there was an initial rapid depletion of sialic acid, followed by a much slower depletion. Fig. 1B also shows the sugar loading value that corresponds to a fractional saturation value of 0.95 (determined from data shown in Fig. 1C). This sugar loading value was then converted to the percentage of sialic acid remaining using an initial sugar loading response of 0.6 nm. This value is the depletion value at which the sialic acid will have been removed to such an extent that the virus is no longer able to completely saturate the surface. For both receptor analogs, the point at which the depletion curve crosses this line corresponds to the time where there is significant deviation between the inhibited and uninhibited binding curves. The initial rapid depletion took place surprisingly quickly for both receptors, with >50% of 3SLN cleaved by 30 s and >50% of 6SLN by 320 s. The initial sugar depletion was much faster for 3SLN; however, the amount of sugar remaining on the surface after long times was higher compared with 6SLN. This is likely due to the lower binding of X-31 to 3SLN at lower sugar loadings, thus preventing NA from acting on any remaining receptor (Fig. 1C). The virus binding signals measure directly how the virus interacts with and alters the sensor surface. The affinity of X-31 HA for monomeric sugars is extremely low (16.Sauter N.K. Bednarski M.D. Wurzburg B.A. Hanson J.E. Whitesides G.M. Skehel J.J. Wiley D.C. Hemagglutinins from two influenza virus variants bind to sialic acid derivatives with millimolar dissociation constants: a 500-MHz proton nuclear magnetic resonance study.Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 8388-8396Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar): Kd = 2.1 ± 0.3 mm for 6SLN and 3.2 ± 0.6 mm for 3SLN (17.Xiong X. Coombs P.J. Martin S.R. Liu J. Xiao H. McCauley J.W. Locher K. Walker P.A. Collins P.J. Kawaoka Y. Skehel J.J. Gamblin S.J. Receptor binding by a ferret-transmissible H5 avian influenza virus.Nature. 2013; 497: 392-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). The interaction of a virus with a sugar-containing surface is multivalent, and the avidity effect means that virus affinity is high, and consequently, the Kd is very low. Virus binding affinities can be estimated by measuring the fractional saturation of a sensor surface at a fixed concentration of virus as a function of the sugar loading (Fig. 1C). These fractional saturation data can then be converted to apparent Kd values. For example, we estimated the Kd values of X-31 for 6SLN (3SLN) to be 1 nm at a sugar loading of 0.038 (0.076) nm, 100 pm at 0.08 (0.165) nm, and 10 pm at 0.155 (0.28) nm. These apparent Kd values can be converted to estimate the mean virus residence time on the sensor by calculating 1/koff at different sugar loadings, shown in Fig. 1D (see “Experimental Procedures”). Kinetic parameters for X-31 NA were measured to determine the ability of NA to cleave different substrates: the fluorogenic substrate MUNANA and the natural substrates 6SLN and 3SLN (Table 1). X-31 NA showed a much higher efficiency for cleaving 3SLN, with an ∼15-fold lower Km and ∼5-fold higher turnover rate (kcat). This preference of NA for α2,3-linked sialic acid is likely due to the inherent property of the ketosidic bond between the sialic acid and the galactose, which is inherently more cleavable in the α2,3-linked form.TABLE 1Steady-state kinetic parameters determined for purified X-31 NASubstrateKm (mean ± S.E.)kcat(mean ± S.E.)kcat/Kmμms−1μm−1 s−1MUNANA27.6 ± 1.056.6 ± 0.92.056SLN8070 ± 61518.5 ± 0.90.002293SLN562.3 ± 2097.5 ± 1.50.173 Open table in a new tab To investigate the effect of altering HA properties, measurements were made on the previously characterized X-31 mutant X-31 HAM. This virus, selected by passage of X-31 in the presence of horse serum (18.Rogers G.N. Paulson J.C. Daniels R.S. Skehel J.J. Wilson I.A. Wiley D.C. Single amino acid substitutions in influenza haemagglutinin change receptor binding specificity.Nature. 1983; 304: 76-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (544) Google Scholar), contains the L226Q substitution in HA. This mutation reduces the affinity of HA for monomeric 6SLN (Kd = 5.9 ± 0.7 mm) but has little effect on the affinity of HA for 3SLN (Kd = 2.9 ± 0.3 mm) (17.Xiong X. Coombs P.J. Martin S.R. Liu J. Xiao H. McCauley J.W. Locher K. Walker P.A. Collins P.J. Kawaoka Y. Skehel J.J. Gamblin S.J. Receptor binding by a ferret-transmissible H5 avian influenza virus.Nature. 2013; 497: 392-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). These changes are reflected, as expected, in the affinity of the virus for sugar-coated surfaces. Virus affinity for 6SLN-coated surfaces was significantly lower compared with X-31, whereas the affinity for 3SLN-coated surfaces was slightly higher (Fig. 1C). Compared with X-31, this virus has an apparent Kd of 100 pm at a sugar loading of 0.144 nm for 3SLN (0.165 nm for X-31) and 0.23 nm for 6SLN (0.08 nm for X-31). The HA/NA balance of X-31 HAM was compared with that of X-31 (Fig. 2, A and B). The changes in receptor binding affinity resulted in significant changes in the shape of the binding curve measured with uninhibited NA. The overall binding to 6SLN was reduced dramatically, with the inhibited and uninhibited curves diverging much earlier. The small increase in 3SLN receptor binding appears to result in a slight increase in overall virus binding with uninhibited NA. NA stalk length has previously been shown to change upon adaption of viruses to new hosts, altering virus growth characteristics (19.Li J. Zu Dohna H. Cardona C.J. Miller J. Carpenter T.E. Emergence and genetic variation of neuraminidase stalk deletions in avian influenza viruses.PLoS ONE. 2011; 6: e14722Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). An X-31 virus with residues 60–69 deleted in the NA stalk (X-31 NAΔ10) was generated by reverse genetics. Receptor binding was measured and compared with that observed with X-31 (Fig. 2, C and D). The NA activity cleaving the small substrate MUNANA remained unchanged for both the wild-type and shortened stalks (data not shown), indicating that the sialidase activity of NA is unchanged. The deletion of 10 residues from the NA stalk caused major changes in the binding curves (with uninhibited NA) for both 6SLN and 3SLN. The point of inflection occurred at later times, and the overall binding levels were increased. This is presumably due to a reduction in the ability of NA to cleave the immobilized substrate, as the reduction in stalk length will move the catalytic region of NA closer to the viral membrane, reducing the ability of NA to form an enzyme-substrate complex, without any changes in the catalytic properties of the enzyme. It is clear from the different curves shown in Figs. 1 (A and B) and 2 that the observed behavior of virus binding and release from a surface depends critically on the balance between the affinity of viral HA for the receptor and the ability of viral NA to cleave sugars from the surface. Three features of the curves for virus binding with uninhibited NA need to be explained: the rapid curve inflection, the slow subsequent release of bound virus, and the fact that some virus remains bound to the surface even after very long times. The data for binding of X-31 to 3SLN with uninhibited NA show a very fast curve inflection, reaching a maximum saturation of only ∼10% of that seen in experiments with inhibited NA. This indicates that viruses must be making short interactions with the surface during which large amounts of sugar are cleaved. Because the interaction of HA with individual sialic acids is very weak (Kd in the mm range), the virus must form several HA-sialic acid interactions to create a stable long-lived interaction. There is consequently likely to be a number of short-lived transient interactions of the virus with the sensor before a strong interaction is eventually formed. When an individual virus makes contact with the sensor surface, there will be a number of factors that will determine the strength (and therefore, the duration) of the interaction, including the number and distribution of HAs and sugar ligands in the interaction area. Without knowing the exact nature of these transient interactions, it is difficult to know what the mean residence time might be. One can speculate that the interaction could be similar in strength to that seen (with inhibited NA) at low sugar loadings. For example, we estimated that a sugar loading of 0.02 nm would correspond to residence times of ∼30–50 ms for 3SLN and ∼2–5 s for 6SLN (Fig. 1D). The question then is how much sugar NA can cleave in these times. This will depend on the positions and distribution of NAs on the virion, the positioning and distribution of the substrate, and, most importantly, on the catalytic efficiency (kcat/Km) of the enzyme for the two substrates. These values indicate that NA cleaves α2,3-linked sugars much more efficiently than α2,6-linked sugars. This large difference in catalytic efficiency explains how X-31 can deplete 3SLN much faster even though the residence time of the virus is less than for 6SLN. In comparing X-31 HAM with X-31, the much faster inflection point (and reduced overall binding) observed for X-31 HAM interacting with the 6SLN-coated surface is attributable to the reduced virus avidity and correspondingly shorter residence time. In comparing the stalk deletion mutant with X-31, the much longer turnaround time (and increased overall binding) observed for the mutant interacting with both the 6SLN- and 3SLN-coated surfaces is attributable to the reduced ability of NA to cleave sugars despite a fully active sialidase. The second binding phase (following the point where the binding curves turn downwards) presumably reflects the rate of dissociation of those viruses that had become strongly attached during the initial binding phase. Because strongly attached viruses would normally have very long residence times (Fig. 1D), the different behavior observed for the two receptor analogs must be due solely to the properties of NA. The observation that the second binding phase observed for X-31 is faster with the 3SLN-coated surface (Fig. 1A) is consistent with the greater catalytic efficiency of the enzyme for this substrate. The fact that the second phase is much slower for the stalk mutant with both sugars is also consistent with the idea that this phase depends strongly on the properties of NA (Fig. 2, C and D). The slow phase observed for X-31 binding to 6SLN with uninhibited NA (Fig. 1A) does not reach zero (no virus bound) even at very long times, indicating that some virus is still interacting with the sensor surface. There are two possible explanations for this: 1) a population of essentially irreversibly attached virus or 2) the viruses interacting with the surface are attaching in a very transient manner that does not allow NA to efficiently meet substrate. The measurements of sugar depletion for both 6SLN and 3SLN tend toward a value of ∼10% remaining sugar (Fig. 1B), which equates to a sugar loading of ∼0.06 nm. At this value, the difference in mean virus residence times is ∼100 s for 6SLN and ∼1.7 s for 3SLN. This residence time appears not to allow for the hypothesis of irreversibly attached virus, rather that the interaction with the surface is more transient. There is also limited ability for NA to cleave 6SLN, with its lower catalytic efficiency. An interesting finding from the data presented is the large difference in uninhibited X-31 binding to α2,6- and α2,3-linked sialic acids. These data show that the substrate specificity of NA can have a large impact on virus receptor binding. A number of reports in the past indicate that IAV NAs have a preference for cleaving α2,3-linked sialic acid (3.Baigent S.J. Bethell R.C. McCauley J.W.

Whether this is an evolved enzymatic property or an inherent property of the chemical bond is unclear. The implications for this linkage preference are interesting when comparing avian and human viruses. The primary site for human virus infection is in the upper respiratory tract, with the virus infecting cells mainly expressing α2,6-linked sialic acid (23.Shinya K. Ebina M. Yamada S. Ono M. Kasai N. Kawaoka Y. Avian flu: influenza virus receptors in the human airway.Nature. 2006; 440: 435-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (1093) Google Scholar). Mucus, which is reported to be rich in α2,3-linked sialic acid, is present in the upper respiratory tract (24.Breg J. Van Halbeek H. Vliegenthart J.F. Lamblin G. Houvenaghel M.C. Roussel P. Structure of sialyl-oligosaccharides isolated from bronchial mucus glycoproteins of patients (blood group O) suffering from cystic fibrosis.Eur. J. Biochem. 1987; 168: 57-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). For a human virus to replicate efficiently, it needs to have a combination of HA and NA activities that allow it to efficiently escape nonspecific inhibition by mucins to efficiently infect the target cells. To avoid the inhibition of the mucus, the virus can either have HA with low avidity for α2,3-linked sialic acid, NA with greater activity against α2,3-linked sialic acid, or a combination of the two. For efficient cell attachment and viral entry, there is a requirement for a human virus to have a strong avidity for α2,6-linked sugars, and for virus release and prevention of aggregation following virus egress from the cell, there will be a requirement for efficient cleavage of 2,6-linked sugars. The system for measuring HA/NA balance described here involves measuring the solid-phase binding of a relatively high virus concentration (100 pm ≈ 6 × 1010 particles/ml). This quantity of virus is much higher than that in natural infections, which are thought to be initiated by a relatively small number of virus particles. Nevertheless, these experiments can be used to infer characteristics of cell attachment and virus release. This method is useful to assess new and emerging viral strains and to understand their relative HA/NA balance characteristics and compare these with previously measured pandemic strains. This provides much more information when studying virus characteristics over and above simply measuring HA or NA kinetic parameters in isolation, allowing opportunities to study the complex relationship between HA and NA, which involves many aspects of cooperativity and multivalency."
https://openalex.org/W2058287327,"In Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) the disease burden of chronic non-communicable diseases (CNCDs) is rising considerably. Given weaknesses in existing financial arrangements across SSA, expenditure on CNCDs is often borne directly by patients through out-of-pocket (OOP) payments. This study explored patterns and determinants of OOP expenditure on CNCDs in Malawi. We used data from the first round of a longitudinal household health survey conducted in 2012 on a sample of 1199 households in three rural districts in Malawi. We used a two-part model to analyze determinants of OOP expenditure on CNCDs. 475 respondents reported at least one CNCD. More than 60% of the 298 individuals who reported seeking care incurred OOP expenditure. The amount of OOP expenditure on CNCDs comprised 22% of their monthly per capita household expenditure. The poorer the household, the higher proportion of their monthly per capita household expenditure was spent on CNCDs. Higher severity of disease was significantly associated with an increased likelihood of incurring OOP expenditure. Use of formal care was negatively associated with the possibility of incurring OOP expenditure. The following factors were positively associated with the amount of OOP expenditure: being female, Alomwe and household head, longer duration of disease, CNCDs targeted through active screening programs, higher socio-economic status, household head being literate, using formal care, and fewer household members living with a CNCD within a household. Our study showed that, in spite of a context where care for CNCDs should in principle be available free of charge at point of use, OOP payments impose a considerable financial burden on rural households, especially among the poorest. This suggests the existence of important gaps in financial protection in the current coverage policy."
https://openalex.org/W1991717581,"Connexins (C×s) are a family of transmembrane proteins that form hemichannels and gap junctions (GJs) on the cell membranes, and transfer small signaling molecules between the cytoplasm and extracellular space and between connecting cells, respectively. Among C×s, suppressing C×43 expression or function promotes skin wound closure and granulation tissue formation, and may alleviate scarring, but the mechanisms are not well understood. Oral mucosal gingiva is characterized by faster wound closure and scarless wound healing outcome as compared to skin wounds. Therefore, we hypothesized that C×43 function is down regulated during human gingival wound healing, which in fibroblasts promotes expression of genes conducive for fast and scarless wound healing. Cultured gingival fibroblasts expressed C×43 as their major connexin. Immunostaining of unwounded human gingiva showed that C×43 was abundantly present in the epithelium, and in connective tissue formed large C×43 plaques in fibroblasts. At the early stages of wound healing, C×43 was strongly down regulated in wound epithelial cells and fibroblasts, returning to the level of normal tissue by day 60 post-wounding. Blocking of C×43 function by C×43 mimetic peptide Gap27 suppressed GJ-mediated dye transfer, promoted migration, and caused significant changes in the expression of wound healing-associated genes in gingival fibroblasts. In particular, out of 54 genes analyzed, several MMPs and TGF-β1, involved in regulation of inflammation and extracellular matrix (ECM) turnover, and VEGF-A, involved in angiogenesis, were significantly upregulated while pro-fibrotic ECM molecules, including Collagen type I, and cell contractility-related molecules were significantly down regulated. These responses involved MAPK, GSK3α/β and TGF-β signaling pathways, and AP1 and SP1 transcription factors. Thus, suppressed function of C×43 in fibroblasts promotes their migration, and regulates expression of wound healing-associated genes via AP1, SP1, MAPK, GSK3α/β and TGF-β signaling pathways, and may promote fast and scarless wound healing in human gingiva."
https://openalex.org/W2022211158,"Infectious bursal disease (IBD) is an acute, highly contagious, and immunosuppressive avian disease caused by IBD virus (IBDV). Our previous report indicates that IBDV VP5 induces apoptosis via interaction with voltage-dependent anion channel 2 (VDAC2). However, the underlying molecular mechanism is still unclear. We report here that receptor of activated protein kinase C 1 (RACK1) interacts with both VDAC2 and VP5 and that they could form a complex. We found that overexpression of RACK1 inhibited IBDV-induced apoptosis in DF-1 cells and that knockdown of RACK1 by small interfering RNA induced apoptosis associated with activation of caspases 9 and 3 and suppressed IBDV growth. These results indicate that RACK1 plays an antiapoptotic role during IBDV infection via interaction with VDAC2 and VP5, suggesting that VP5 sequesters RACK1 and VDAC2 in the apoptosis-inducing process. Infectious bursal disease (IBD) is an acute, highly contagious, and immunosuppressive avian disease caused by IBD virus (IBDV). Our previous report indicates that IBDV VP5 induces apoptosis via interaction with voltage-dependent anion channel 2 (VDAC2). However, the underlying molecular mechanism is still unclear. We report here that receptor of activated protein kinase C 1 (RACK1) interacts with both VDAC2 and VP5 and that they could form a complex. We found that overexpression of RACK1 inhibited IBDV-induced apoptosis in DF-1 cells and that knockdown of RACK1 by small interfering RNA induced apoptosis associated with activation of caspases 9 and 3 and suppressed IBDV growth. These results indicate that RACK1 plays an antiapoptotic role during IBDV infection via interaction with VDAC2 and VP5, suggesting that VP5 sequesters RACK1 and VDAC2 in the apoptosis-inducing process.

VP5 of infectious bursal disease virus is not essential for viral replication in cell culture.J. Virol. 1997; 71: 5647-5651Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In a previous study, we found that VP5 induces apoptosis in DF-1 cells via interaction with voltage-dependent anion channel 2 (VDAC2) (25.Li Z. Wang Y. Xue Y. Li X. Cao H. Zheng S.J. Critical role for voltage-dependent anion channel 2 in infectious bursal disease virus-induced apoptosis in host cells via interaction with VP5.J. Virol. 2012; 86: 1328-1338Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). However, the molecular mechanism underlying such an induction remains elusive. In this study, we expanded our investigation to search for the interacting proteins for VDAC2 by yeast two-hybrid screening, immunoprecipitation, and confocal microscopy assays. We found that receptor of activated protein kinase C 1 (RACK1) interacts with both VDAC2 and VP5 and that they can form a complex. Importantly, overexpression of RACK1 suppressed IBDV-induced apoptosis. Furthermore, knockdown of RACK1 by siRNA markedly induced the activation of caspases 9 and 3 and suppressed IBDV growth. Both HEK293T and DF-1 (immortal chicken embryo fibroblast) cells were obtained from the ATCC. All cells were cultured in DMEM (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% FBS in a 5% CO2 incubator. Primary chicken embryo fibroblast (CEF) cells were prepared from 10-day-old specific pathogen-free chicken embryos. Lx, a cell culture-adapted IBDV strain, was provided by Dr. Jue Liu (Beijing Academy of Agriculture and Forestry, Beijing, China). All restriction enzymes were purchased from New England Biolabs. The pRK5-FLAG, pDsRed-monomer-N1, pCMV-Myc, pEGFP-C1, and pEGFP-N1 vectors were obtained from Clontech. Anti-c-Myc (catalog no. sc-40), anti-GFP (catalog no. sc-9996), anti-RACK1 (catalog no. sc-17754), and anti-β-actin (catalog no. sc-1616-R) monoclonal antibodies were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Rabbit anti-VDAC2 polyclonal antibodies (catalog no. ab47104) were purchased from Abcam. Anti-VP5 monoclonal antibody (catalog no. EU0208) was purchased from CAEU Biological Co. (Beijing, China). Rabbit anti-GFP antibodies (catalog no. 2956S) were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology. Anti-FLAG (catalog no. F1804) antibody, propidium iodide, Annexin V-phycoerythrin (Annexin V-PE) and 7-amino-actinomycin D were purchased from Sigma. Opti-MEM I, RNAiMAX, and Lipofectamine LTX were purchased from Invitrogen. Gallus RACK1 was cloned from DF-1 cells using the specific primers 5′-ATGACGGAGCAGATGACC-3′ (sense) and 5′-TCATCTGGTTCCAATGGT-3′ (antisense) according to the published sequence in GenBank (accession No. AY393848.1). pRK5-FLAG-rack1, pCMV-Myc-rack1, pDsRed-rack1, and pEGFP-rack1 were constructed by standard molecular biology techniques. All primers were obtained from a commercial source (Sangon, Shanghai, China). pRK5-FLAG-vdac2, pEGFP-vdac2, pRK5-FLAG-vp5, pEGFP-vp5, and truncated VP5 expression plasmids were kept in our laboratory. Yeast two-hybrid screening was performed according to the protocol of the manufacturer (Matchmaker Two-Hybrid System 3). Briefly, the pGBKT7-vdac2 plasmid expressing the fusion protein GAL4-BD-vdac2 was used as bait, and the bursa of Fabricius cDNA expression library fusion to the GAL4-activation domain in the pGADT7 plasmid was used as prey. Positive clones were selected on S.D./Ade/His/Leu/Trp medium and tested for β-galactosidase activity. The coimmunoprecipitation approach used to analyze protein interaction has been described previously (25.Li Z. Wang Y. Xue Y. Li X. Cao H. Zheng S.J. Critical role for voltage-dependent anion channel 2 in infectious bursal disease virus-induced apoptosis in host cells via interaction with VP5.J. Virol. 2012; 86: 1328-1338Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Briefly, HEK293T cells or DF-1 cells were cotransfected with the indicated plasmids or empty vectors as controls. Twenty-four hours after transfection, cell lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-Myc (or anti-FLAG) antibody at 4 °C for 3 h and then mixed with 20 μl of a 50% slurry of protein A/G plus agarose and incubated for another 3 h. Beads were washed three times with lysis buffer and boiled with 2× SDS loading buffer for 10 min. The samples were fractionated by SDS-PAGE and transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. After blocking with 5% skimmed milk, the membranes were incubated with the indicated antibodies. Blots were developed using an ECL kit. For the endogenous pulldown assay, DF-1 cells were transfected with pEGFP-VP5 or infected with IBDV. Twenty-four hours after transfection or 36 h after infection, the cell lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-RACK1 antibody and immunoblotted with anti-VDAC2, anti-RACK1, anti-VP5, or anti-GFP antibodies. HEK293T cells transfected with pDsRed-rack1 and pEGFP-vdac2 (or pEGFP-vp5) were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, and the nuclei were stained with DAPI. For endogenous protein staining, mock- or IBDV-infected DF-1 cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, permeabilized with Triton X-100, blocked with bovine serum albumin, and then probed with the indicated antibodies. The cells were stained for nuclei with DAPI. The samples were analyzed with a laser confocal scanning microscope (Nikon C1 standard detector). DF-1 or CEF cells were transfected with pEGFP-rack1 or pEGFP-N1 plasmids by Lipofectamine LTX before infection with IBDV at an m.o.i. of 1. Twenty-four hours after infection, cells were harvested and stained with propidium iodide (1 μg/ml) or PE-conjugated Annexin V in a binding buffer for 15 min. GFP-positive cells were gated for apoptosis analysis. Fluorescence-activated cell sorter data were analyzed with CellQuest software (BD Biosciences). DF-1 cells receiving RACK1-specific siRNA or control siRNA were harvested and washed twice with PBS, resuspended in a binding buffer, and incubated with PE-conjugated Annexin V and 7-amino-actinomycin D for 15 min at room temperature. Samples were subjected to flow cytometry analysis as described above. siRNAs designed by Genechem Co. (Shanghai, China) were used to knock down RACK1 in DF-1 cells. The sequences of siRNA for targeting RACK1 in DF-1 cells included RNAi#1 (sense, 5′-CCAUCAUCAUGUGAAGCUtt-3′; antisense, 5′-AGCUUCACAUGAUGAUGGtt-3′), RNAi#2 (sense, 5′-CCCGAGAUGAGACCAACUAtt-3′; antisense, 5′-UAGUUGGUCUCAUCUCGGGtt-3′), RNAi#3 (sense, 5′-UCAAACUCUGGAACACUUU tt-3′; antisense, 5′-AAAGUGUUCCAGAGUUUGA tt-3′), and a negative siRNA control (sense, 5′-UUCUCCGAACGUGUCACGUtt-3′; antisense, 5′-ACGUGACACGUUCGGAGAAtt-3′). DF-1 cells were transfected with siRNA using RNAiMAX reagent according to the instructions of the manufacturer (Invitrogen). Triple transfections were performed at a 24-h interval. Twenty-four hours after the third transfection, cells were harvested for further analysis. DF-1 cells receiving RACK1-specific siRNA or control siRNA were lysed in chilled cell lysis buffer, the cell lysates were centrifuged, and the supernatants were collected to measure caspase 3 and 9 activities according to the instructions of the manufacturer (BioVision). The results of all experiments are reported as mean ± S.D. DF-1 cells receiving RACK1-specific siRNA or control siRNA or transfected with pEGFP-rack1 or pEGFP-N1 as a control were infected with IBDV at an m.o.i. of 10, and cell cultures were collected at different time points (12, 24, 48, and 72 h) after infection. The viral titers in the supernatants or cell cultures were titrated using 50% tissue culture infective doses (TCID50) as described previously (27.Reed L M.H. A simple method of estimating fifty percent endpoints.Am. J. Epidemiol. 1938; 27: 493-497Crossref Scopus (16192) Google Scholar). Briefly, the viral solution was serially diluted 10-fold in DMEM. A 100-μl aliquot of each diluted sample was added to the wells of 96-well plates, followed by addition of 100 μl of DF-1 cells at a density of 5 × 105 cells/ml. Cells were cultured for 5 days at 37 °C in 5% CO2. Tissue culture wells with a cytopathic effect were considered to be positive. The significance of the differences between RACK1 RNAi cells and controls in caspase 9 and 3 activation, between RACK1 RNAi cells and controls in viral growth or apoptosis, and between pEGFP-rack1-transfected cells and controls in viral growth or apoptosis was determined by Mann-Whitney test or analysis of variance, respectively. Our previous report indicated that VP5 induced apoptosis in DF-1 cells via interaction with VDAC2, which affected the viral release (25.Li Z. Wang Y. Xue Y. Li X. Cao H. Zheng S.J. Critical role for voltage-dependent anion channel 2 in infectious bursal disease virus-induced apoptosis in host cells via interaction with VP5.J. Virol. 2012; 86: 1328-1338Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). To elucidate the mechanism of such an induction, we set out to search for the cellular targets of VDAC2. We used VDAC2 as bait in a yeast two-hybrid system to screen a cDNA library generated from the chicken bursa of Fabricius. Among the proteins that potentially interacted with VDAC2, RACK1 proteins were identified twice. The interaction between VDAC2 and RACK1 was further verified with a colony lift filter assay (Fig. 1). Because RACK1 is related to apoptosis (28.Wu Y. Wang Y. Sun Y. Zhang L. Wang D. Ren F. Chang D. Chang Z. Jia B. RACK1 promotes Bax oligomerization and dissociates the interaction of Bax and Bcl-XL.Cell Signal. 2010; 22: 1495-1501Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 29.Mamidipudi V. Cartwright C.A.

McMahon T. Wang D. Messing R.O. The mouse RACK1 gene is regulated by nuclear factor-κ B and contributes to cell survival.Mol. Pharmacol. 2003; 64: 1541-1548Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), we proposed that RACK1 might be involved in VDAC2-mediated apoptosis. Therefore, we constructed a plasmid that allowed the expression of Myc-RACK1 for analyzing its interaction with VDAC2 in HEK293T cells. When lysates of cells expressing both Myc-RACK1 and GFP-VDAC2 were immunoprecipitated with Myc antibody, GFP-VDAC2 was detected in the precipitate, indicating that RACK1 interacted with exogenous VDAC2 in HEK293T cells (Fig. 2A). Similar results were obtained in an experiment using DF-1 cells (Fig. 2B), indicating that the interaction observed between these two proteins is not cell type-specific. Considering the binding capacity of RACK1 as a signaling hub (31.Ron D. Adams D.R. Baillie G.S. Long A. O'Connor R. Kiely P.A. RACK1 to the future: a historical perspective.Cell Commun. Signal. 2013; 11: 53Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), we expanded our investigation to study whether RACK1 could interact with IBDV VP5. Lysates of cells expressing Myc-RACK1 and FLAG-VP5 were immunoprecipitated with FLAG antibody, and Myc-RACK1 was detected in the precipitate, indicating that RACK1 interacted with ectopically expressed VP5 in HEK293T cells (Fig. 2C). Similar results were obtained in an experiment using DF-1 cells (Fig. 2D). To further substantiate the binding of RACK1 to VDAC2 or IBDV VP5, we expressed RACK1 or VDAC2 in DF-1 cells and examined their interaction with endogenous partners using a pulldown assay. The binding of FLAG-RACK1 with endogenous VDAC2 was readily detectable in cells expressing RACK1 protein (Fig. 3A), and the binding of FLAG-VDAC2 with endogenous RACK1 was also detectable (Fig. 3B). These results demonstrate that VDAC2 interacts with RACK1 in host cells. When lysates of DF-1 cells expressing GFP-VP5 were immunoprecipitated with RACK1 antibody, GFP-VP5 was detected in the precipitate, indicating that VP5 interacted with endogenous RACK1 in host cells (Fig. 3C). These data suggest that RACK1 interacts with both VDAC2 and VP5 proteins. Because RACK1 interacted with both VDAC2 and VP5 and was considered to play a role in complex assembly, we expanded our investigation to study whether RACK1, VDAC2, and IBDV VP5 form a complex. Lysates of HEK293T cells expressing FLAG-RACK1, GFP-VP5, and GFP-VDAC2 were immunoprecipitated with FLAG antibody, and both GFP-VP5 and GFP-VDAC2 were detected in the precipitate (Fig. 4A), indicating that ectopically expressed VP5, RACK1, and VDAC2 formed a complex. To further examine the complex of VDAC2 and RACK1 to VP5, we expressed VP5 in DF-1 cells and examined the complex using a pulldown assay. Lysates of DF-1 cells expressing GFP-VP5 were immunoprecipitated with RACK1 antibody, and both VP5 and VDAC2 were detected in the precipitate (Fig. 4B), indicating that VP5, endogenous RACK1, and VDAC2 formed a complex in host cells. To determine whether the IBDV VP5, VDAC2, and RACK1 could form a complex under physiological conditions, we infected DF-1 cells and performed a pulldown assay using anti-RACK1 antibodies. As a result, both VP5 and VDAC2 could be detected in the precipitate of the lysates from IBDV-infected cells but not from mock-infected controls (Fig. 4C). These data clearly show that VDAC2, RACK1, and IBDV VP5 formed a complex in host cells. To determine the region of VP5 responsible for interacting with RACK1, we constructed a series of VP5 truncated mutants fused to the GFP tag (Fig. 5A). These VP5 derivatives were coexpressed individually with FLAG-RACK1 in HEK293T cells, and lysates of cells were immunoprecipitated with FLAG antibody. These VP5 derivatives were detected with anti-GFP antibody. Our results indicated that, with the exception of mutants (Δ3 and Δ4) lacking residues 100–145, the VP5 mutant with residues 100–145 only (Δ2 mutant) retained the ability to interact with RACK1 (Fig. 5B), suggesting that the region with 100–145 of VP5 is important for its interaction with RACK1. Because we have established previously that a domain that spans residues 1–50 of VP5 interacts with VDAC2 (25.Li Z. Wang Y. Xue Y. Li X. Cao H. Zheng S.J. Critical role for voltage-dependent anion channel 2 in infectious bursal disease virus-induced apoptosis in host cells via interaction with VP5.J. Virol. 2012; 86: 1328-1338Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), and because our data from this study show that a domain with residues 100∼145 of VP5 interacts with RACK1 and that VDAC2 binds to RACK1, it is very likely that VP5, RACK1, and VDAC2 form a complex in cells (Fig. 5C). To determine the subcellular localization of VDAC2 and RACK1, we performed confocal microscopy assays with HEK293T cells transfected to express DsRed-RACK1 and GFP-VDAC2. As shown in Fig. 6, A and B, both RACK1 and VDAC2 were located in the cytoplasm of HEK293T cells transfected with pEGFP-vdac2 or pDsRed-rack1. When cells were transfected with both plasmids, we found that the fluorescence of exogenous VDAC2 and RACK1 merged in the cytoplasm (Fig. 6, C–E), suggesting that VDAC2 and RACK1 were colocalized in cells. To consolidate these findings, we examined the colocalization of endogenous VDAC2 with RACK1 in IBDV-infected DF-1 cells. We infected DF-1 cells with IBDV at an m.o.i. of 10 and performed an immunofluorescent antibody assay using anti-VDAC2 and anti-RACK1 antibodies. In mock-infected cells, both VDAC2 and RACK1 were diffused cytoplasmically (Fig. 6, F–H). However, when cells were infected with IBDV, endogenous VDAC2 and RACK1 changed their localization patterns from diffused to granular structures where both of them were colocalized (Fig. 6, I–K), indicating the interaction of VDAC2 with RACK1 in IBDV-infected cells. Because we have shown previously that VP5 colocalized with VDAC2 in the mitochondrion of host cells (25.Li Z. Wang Y. Xue Y. Li X. Cao H. Zheng S.J. Critical role for voltage-dependent anion channel 2 in infectious bursal disease virus-induced apoptosis in host cells via interaction with VP5.J. Virol. 2012; 86: 1328-1338Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) and because VP5-VDAC2-RACK1 formed a complex, as demonstrated by immunoprecipitation assays, we performed a confocal microscopy assay to examine the colocalization of VP5 with RACK1 in cells. As shown in Fig. 6, L–N, the colocalization of VP5 with exogenous RACK1 was found primarily in the cytoplasm of cells transfected with both pDsRed-RACK1 and pEGFP-VP5. When cells were transfected with pEGFP-VP5 only, endogenous RACK1 colocalized with VP5 (Fig. 6, O–Q). In addition, transfection of DF-1 cells with pDsRed-RACK1 indicated that RACK1 was also located in the mitochondria of DF-1 cells (Fig. 6, R–T). All these data strongly suggested that VP5, VADC2, and RACK1 formed a complex in the cytoplasm of cells and that they were all located in the mitochondria. Because IBDV VP5 protein was mainly responsible for IBDV-induced apoptosis via interaction with VDAC2 (25.Li Z. Wang Y. Xue Y. Li X. Cao H. Zheng S.J.

Virol. 2012; 86: 1328-1338Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) and because RACK1 was associated physically with both VP5 and VDAC2, RACK1 was assumed to affect IBDV-induced apoptosis. To test this hypothesis, DF-1 cells were transfected with pEGFP-rack1 or pEGFP-N1 as a control, followed by mock infection or infection with IBDV. As shown in Fig. 7A, exogenous RACK1 was expressed very well in both mock- and IBDV-infected cells. Interestingly, we found that overexpression of RACK1 markedly suppressed IBDV-induced apoptosis in DF-1 cells (Fig. 7, B and C). Similar results were obtained using primary cell culture (CEFs) (Fig. 7, D and E). These data suggest that RACK1 may play an antiapoptotic role in IBDV-induced apoptosis in host cells. Because IBDV-induced apoptosis is associated with viral growth (25.Li Z. Wang Y. Xue Y. Li X. Cao H. Zheng S.J.

However, the underlying mechanisms are not well understood. At the cellular level, a disruption of lysosome fusion with endosomes or autophagosomes may contribute to the potentiation of low-grade inflammation. In this study, we identified that subclinical super-low-dose endotoxin LPS can potently inhibit the process of endosome acidification and lysosome fusion with endosomes or autophagosomes in primary macrophages. Super-low-dose LPS induced the inhibitory phosphorylation of VPS34, thus leading to the disruption of endosome-lysosome fusion. This effect may depend upon the clearance and relocation of Tollip in macrophages by super-low-dose LPS. Consistent with this notion, Tollip-deficient macrophages had constitutively elevated levels of VPS34 inhibitory phosphorylation and constitutive disruption of endosome-lysosome fusion. By employing a skin excision wound-healing model, we observed that Tollip-deficient mice had significantly elevated levels of cell stress and reduced wound repair. This study reveals a novel mechanism responsible for the modulation of endosome-lysosome fusion and low-grade inflammation in innate macrophages.

https://openalex.org/W2101123699,"The bacterial CRISPR-Cas9 system has been adapted for use as a genome editing tool. While several recent reports have indicated that successful genome editing of mice can be achieved, detailed phenotypic and molecular analyses of the mutant animals are limited. Following pronuclear micro-injection of fertilized eggs with either wild-type Cas9 or the nickase mutant (D10A) and single or paired guide RNA (sgRNA) for targeting of the tyrosinase (Tyr) gene, we assessed genome editing in mice using rapid phenotypic readouts (eye and coat color). Mutant mice with insertions or deletions (indels) in Tyr were efficiently generated without detectable off-target cleavage events. Gene correction of a single nucleotide by homologous recombination (HR) could only occur when the sgRNA recognition sites in the donor DNA were modified. Gene repair did not occur if the donor DNA was not modified because Cas9 catalytic activity was completely inhibited. Our results indicate that allelic mosaicism can occur following -Cas9-mediated editing in mice and appears to correlate with sgRNA cleavage efficiency at the single-cell stage. We also show that larger than expected deletions may be overlooked based on the screening strategy employed. An unbiased analysis of all the deleted nucleotides in our experiments revealed that the highest frequencies of nucleotide deletions were clustered around the predicted Cas9 cleavage sites, with slightly broader distributions than expected. Finally, additional analysis of founder mice and their offspring indicate that their general health, fertility, and the transmission of genetic changes were not compromised. These results provide the foundation to interpret and predict the diverse outcomes following CRISPR-Cas9-mediated genome editing experiments in mice."
https://openalex.org/W2061207513,"Surfactants are extremely important agents to clean and sanitize various environments. Their biocidal activity is a key factor determined by the interactions between amphiphile structure and the target microbial cells. The object of this study was to analyze the interactions between four structural variants of N-alkyltropinium bromide surfactants with the Gram negative Escherichia coli and the Gram positive Listeria innocua bacteria. Microbiological and conductometric methods with a previously described FTIR bioassay were used to assess the metabolomic damage exerted by these compounds. All surfactants tested showed more biocidal activity in L. innocua than in E. coli. N-tetradecyltropinium bromide was the most effective compound against both species, while all the other variants had a reduced efficacy as biocides, mainly against E. coli cells. In general, the most prominent metabolomic response was observed for the constituents of the cell envelope in the fatty acids (W1) and amides (W2) regions and at the wavenumbers referred to peptidoglycan (W2 and W3 regions). This response was particularly strong and negative in L. innocua, when cells were challenged by N-tetradecyltropinium bromide, and by the variant with a smaller head and a 12C tail (N-dodecylquinuclidinium bromide). Tail length was critical for microbial inhibition especially when acting against E. coli, maybe due the complex nature of Gram negative cell envelope. Statistical analysis allowed us to correlate the induced mortality with the metabolomic cell response, highlighting two different modes of action. In general, gaining insights in the interactions between fine structural properties of surfactants and the microbial diversity can allow tailoring these compounds for the various operative conditions."

Participants also returned a questionnaire for analysis of risk factors. Screening for pAmpC was performed with selective enrichment broth and a selective screening agar. Confirmation of AmpC-production was performed with two double disc combination tests: cefotaxime and ceftazidime with either boronic acid or cloxacillin as inhibitor. Multiplex PCR was used as gold standard for detection of pAmpC. 16S rRNA PCR and AFLP were performed as required, plasmids were identified by PCR-based replicon typing. Questionnaire results were analyzed with SPSS, version 20.0.Fecal samples were obtained from 550 volunteers; mean age 51 years (range: 18-91), 61% were females. pAmpC was present in seven E. coli isolates (7/550, 1.3%, 0.6-2.7 95% CI): six CMY-2-like pAmpC and one DHA. ESBL-encoding genes were found in 52/550 (9.5%, 7.3-12.2 95% CI) isolates; these were predominantly blaCTX-M genes. Two isolates had both ESBL and pAmpC. Admission to a hospital in the previous year was the only risk factor we identified.Our data indicate that the prevalence of pAmpC in the community seems still low. However, since pAmpC-producing isolates were not identified as ESBL producers by routine algorithms, there is consistent risk that further increase of their prevalence might go undetected."

Dual oxidases (Duoxes) also produce an O2⨪ intermediate, although the final species secreted by mature Duoxes is H2O2, suggesting that intramolecular O2⨪ dismutation or other mechanisms contribute to H2O2 release. We explored the structural determinants affecting reactive oxygen species formation by Duox enzymes. Duox2 showed O2⨪ leakage when mismatched with Duox activator 1 (DuoxA1). Duox2 released O2⨪ even in correctly matched combinations, including Duox2 + DuoxA2 and Duox2 + N-terminally tagged DuoxA2 regardless of the type or number of tags. Conversely, Duox1 did not release O2⨪ in any combination. Chimeric Duox2 possessing the A-loop of Duox1 showed no O2⨪ leakage; chimeric Duox1 possessing the A-loop of Duox2 released O2⨪. Moreover, Duox2 proteins possessing the A-loops of Nox1 or Nox5 co-expressed with DuoxA2 showed enhanced O2⨪ release, and Duox1 proteins possessing the A-loops of Nox1 or Nox5 co-expressed with DuoxA1 acquired O2⨪ leakage. Although we identified Duox1 A-loop residues (His1071, His1072, and Gly1074) important for reducing O2⨪ release, mutations of these residues to those of Duox2 failed to convert Duox1 to an O2⨪-releasing enzyme. Using immunoprecipitation and endoglycosidase H sensitivity assays, we found that the A-loop of Duoxes binds to DuoxA N termini, creating more stable, mature Duox-DuoxA complexes.

In tissues with high Duox expression, the enzymes accumulate on the apical plasma membrane, facilitating H2O2 release from epithelial cell surfaces to support the activities of extracellular hemoperoxidases (22.De Deken X.

Signal. 2014; 20: 2776-2793Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). In contrast to Nox1–5, Duoxes have an extended N-terminal extracellular domain called the peroxidase homology (PoxH) domain, followed by an additional transmembrane (TM) segment and an intracellular loop containing two calcium-binding EF-hand motifs (4.De Deken X.

Thus, Duoxes possess four extracellular regions: the PoxH domain (1–595 amino acids (aa) in human Duox2) and three loops (the A-loop, 1064–1078 aa; C-loop, 1146–1184 aa; E-loop, 1242–1251 aa in human Duox2) (Fig. 1A). The PoxH domain is a candidate for intramolecular O2⨪ dismutation, although the isolated PoxH domains of both Duoxes demonstrate no O2⨪ dismutation activity in vitro (24.Meitzler J.L. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. Caenorhabditis elegans and human dual oxidase 1 (DUOX1) “peroxidase” domains: insights into heme binding and catalytic activity.J. Biol.

Thus, the mechanism underlying H2O2 production by Duoxes remains poorly understood. A switch in ROS generation from H2O2 to O2⨪ occurs when Duox2 is mismatched with DuoxA1 (26.Zamproni I. Grasberger H. Cortinovis F. Vigone M.C. Chiumello G. Mora S. Onigata K. Fugazzola L. Refetoff S. Persani L. Weber G.

Metab. 2008; 93: 605-610Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). We reported that the mismatched combination of Duox2 + DuoxA1, but not that of Duox1 + DuoxA2, releases O2⨪ in addition to H2O2; we called this phenomenon O2⨪ leakage (7.Morand S. Ueyama T. Tsujibe S. Saito N. Korzeniowska A. Leto T.L. Duox maturation factors form cell surface complexes with Duox affecting the specificity of reactive oxygen species generation.FASEB J. 2009; 23: 1205-1218Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). In this study we examined why Duox2, but not Duox1, leaks O2⨪, in addition to exploring the structural features of Duox and DuoxA proteins involved in H2O2 release. We found that the A-loops of Duoxes, particularly Duox1, function in controlling O2⨪ release by contributing to the stabilization and maturation of Duox-DuoxA complexes. A polyclonal antibody (pAb) against Duoxes, which preferentially detects Duox2 via the first intracellular loop (639–1039 aa of human Duox2) but also detects Duox1, was previously described (15.El Hassani R.A.

A pAb against DuoxA1, which recognizes the extracellular N terminus of DuoxA1, was obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.

We used human Duox2, DuoxA1(α),and DuoxA2 in pcDNA3.1 (Invitrogen), which were previously described (7.Morand S. Ueyama T. Tsujibe S. Saito N. Korzeniowska A. Leto T.L.

Duox1 and Duox2 with a 2×HA tag between Asn-23 and Pro-24 and between Asp-27 and Ala-28, respectively, in the first extracellular region were created in pcDNA3.1 by site-directed mutagenesis using a QuikChange Lightening Site-Directed Mutagenesis kit (Agilent Technologies). The chimeric construct Duox(1PoxH-2), possessing the PoxH domain of Duox1 (1–592 aa) and the Nox-like portion of Duox2 (596–1548 aa), and the chimeric construct Duox(2PoxH-1), possessing the PoxH domain of Duox2 (1–594 aa) and the Nox-like portion of Duox1 (592–1551 aa), were created in pcDNA3.1 by PCR and restriction enzyme-based recombination.

This probably explains why they have not previously been considered as substrates exploited by phytopathogenic bacteria during plant infection. Xanthomonas campestris pv. campestris, the causal agent of black rot disease of Brassica plants, possesses a specific system for GlcNAc utilization expressed during host plant infection. This system encompasses a cluster of eight genes (nixE to nixL) encoding glycoside hydrolases (GHs). In this paper, we have characterized the enzymatic activities of these GHs and demonstrated their involvement in sequential degradation of a plant N-glycan using a N-glycopeptide containing two GlcNAcs, three mannoses, one fucose, and one xylose (N2M3FX) as a substrate. The removal of the α-1,3-mannose by the α-mannosidase NixK (GH92) is a prerequisite for the subsequent action of the β-xylosidase NixI (GH3), which is involved in the cleavage of the β-1,2-xylose, followed by the α-mannosidase NixJ (GH125), which removes the α-1,6-mannose. These data, combined to the subcellular localization of the enzymes, allowed us to propose a model of N-glycopeptide processing by X. campestris pv. campestris. This study constitutes the first evidence suggesting N-glycan degradation by a plant pathogen, a feature shared with human pathogenic bacteria. Plant N-glycans should therefore be included in the repertoire of molecules putatively metabolized by phytopathogenic bacteria during their life cycle.

https://openalex.org/W2010860523,"Although Lycium chinense (goji berry) is an important traditional Chinese medicinal plant, little genome information is available for this plant, particularly at the small-RNA level. Recent findings indicate that the evolutionary role of miRNAs is very important for a better understanding of gene regulation in different plant species. To elucidate small RNAs and their potential target genes in fruit and shoot tissues, high-throughput RNA sequencing technology was used followed by qRT-PCR and RLM 5’-RACE experiments. A total of 60 conserved miRNAs belonging to 31 families and 30 putative novel miRNAs were identified. A total of 62 significantly differentially expressed miRNAs were identified, of which 15 (14 known and 1 novel) were shoot-specific, and 12 (7 known and 5 novel) were fruit-specific. Additionally, 28 differentially expressed miRNAs were recorded as up-regulated in fruit tissues. The predicted potential targets were involved in a wide range of metabolic and regulatory pathways. GO (Gene Ontology) enrichment analysis and the KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes) database revealed that “metabolic pathways” is the most significant pathway with respect to the rich factor and gene numbers. Moreover, five miRNAs were related to fruit maturation, lycopene biosynthesis and signaling pathways, which might be important for the further study of fruit molecular biology. This study is the first, to detect known and novel miRNAs, and their potential targets, of L. chinense. The data and findings that are presented here might be a good source for the functional genomic study of medicinal plants and for understanding the links among diversified biological pathways."
https://openalex.org/W1980331452,"The increasing incidence of acyclovir (ACV) and multidrug-resistant strains in patients with corneal HSV-1 infections leading to Herpetic Stromal Keratitis (HSK) is a major health problem in industrialized countries and often results in blindness. To overcome this obstacle, we have previously developed an HSV-gB-specific monoclonal antibody (mAb 2c) that proved to be highly protective in immunodeficient NOD/SCID-mice towards genital infections. In the present study, we examined the effectivity of mAb 2c in preventing the immunopathological disease HSK in the HSK BALB/c mouse model. Therefore, mice were inoculated with HSV-1 strain KOS on the scarified cornea to induce HSK and subsequently either systemically or topically treated with mAb 2c. Systemic treatment was performed by intravenous administration of mAb 2c 24 h prior to infection (pre-exposure prophylaxis) or 24, 40, and 56 hours after infection (post-exposure immunotherapy). Topical treatment was performed by periodical inoculations (5 times per day) of antibody-containing eye drops as control, starting at 24 h post infection. Systemic antibody treatment markedly reduced viral loads at the site of infection and completely protected mice from developing HSK. The administration of the antiviral antibody prior or post infection was equally effective. Topical treatment had no improving effect on the severity of HSK. In conclusion, our data demonstrate that mAb 2c proved to be an excellent drug for the treatment of corneal HSV-infections and for prevention of HSK and blindness. Moreover, the humanized counterpart (mAb hu2c) was equally effective in protecting mice from HSV-induced HSK when compared to the parental mouse antibody. These results warrant the future development of this antibody as a novel approach for the treatment of corneal HSV-infections in humans."
https://openalex.org/W1998591412,"Proteases play a well recognized role in the emergence of highly aggregation-prone protein fragments in vivo, whereas in vitro limited proteolysis is often employed to probe different phases of amyloidogenic pathways. Here, we show that addition of moderate amounts of pepsin to acidified bovine insulin at close to physiological temperature results in an abrupt self-assembly of amyloid-like fibrils from partially digested insulin fragments. Biochemical analysis of the pepsin-induced fibrils implicates peptide fragments (named H) consisting of the 13 or 15 N-terminal residues of the A-chain and 11 or 13 N-terminal residues of the B-chain linked by the disulfide bond between Cys-7A–Cys-7B as the main constituents. There are up to eight pepsin-cleavage sites remaining within the double chain peptide, which become protected upon fast fibrillation unless concentration of the enzyme is increased resulting in complete digestion of insulin. Controlled re-association of H-peptides leads to “explosive” fibrillation only under nonreducing conditions implying the key role of the disulfide bond in their amyloidogenicity. Such re-assembled amyloid is similar in terms of morphology and infrared features to typical bovine insulin fibrils, although it lacks the ability to seed the intact protein."

Elmo1/Dock180 regulates Rac1 activity in a specific spatiotemporal manner in endothelial cells (ECs) during zebrafish development and acts downstream of the Netrin-1/Unc5-homolog B (Unc5B) signaling cascade. However, mechanistic details on the pathways by which Elmo1/Dock180 regulates endothelial function and vascular development remained elusive. In this study, we aimed to analyze the vascular function of Elmo1 and Dock180 in human ECs and during vascular development in zebrafish embryos. In vitro overexpression of Elmo1 and Dock180 in ECs reduced caspase-3/7 activity and annexin V-positive cell number upon induction of apoptosis. This protective effect of Elmo1 and Dock180 is mediated by activation of Rac1, p21-activated kinase (PAK) and AKT/protein kinase B (AKT) signaling. In zebrafish, Elmo1 and Dock180 overexpression reduced the total apoptotic cell and apoptotic EC number and promoted the formation of blood vessels during embryogenesis. In conclusion, Elmo1 and Dock180 protect ECs from apoptosis by the activation of the Rac1/PAK/AKT signaling cascade in vitro and in vivo.

Angiogenesis is a pivotal process, e.g. during embryonic development, and includes various tightly regulated steps.

The monomeric GTPase Rac1 is a member of the Ras homologue (Rho)-family of small G proteins and regulates critical actions during angiogenesis (16.Kather J.N. Kroll J.

Furthermore, Rac1 regulates cell cycle progression, EC morphology, capillary survival, and pruning by cell retraction (3.Chen Q. Jiang L. Li C. Hu D. Bu J.W. Cai D. Du J.L.

Endothelial loss of Rac1 in mice is embryonic lethal at embryonic day (E) 9.5 due to malformation of major vessels, such as branchial arch arteries and cardiac defects (19.Tan W. Palmby T.R.

An essential role for Rac1 in endothelial cell function and vascular development.FASEB J. 2008; 22: 1829-1838Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). This highlights the important function of this monomeric GTPase in angiogenesis. Rac1, like other small G proteins, is regulated by guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs). These GEFs mediate the exchange from GDP to GTP and hence activate the monomeric GTPases (20.Rossman K.L. Der C.J. Sondek J. GEF means go: turning on RHO GTPases with guanine nucleotide-exchange factors.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 6: 167-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (1313) Google Scholar). Usually a multitude of GEFs is available for one small G protein and facilitate cell and context specific actions of the protein (16.Kather J.N. Kroll J. Rho guanine exchange factors in blood vessels: fine-tuners of angiogenesis and vascular function.Exp. Cell Res. 2013; 319: 1289-1297Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). An unusual GEF for Rac1 is the protein complex Elmo1/Dock180. Whereas canonical GEFs interact with GTPases of the Rho family via their Dbl homology-pleckstrin homology (DH-PH) domains, Dock180 does not possess such a domain. It interacts with Rac1 by its Docker domain (20.Rossman K.L. Der C.J. Sondek J. GEF means go: turning on RHO GTPases with guanine nucleotide-exchange factors.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 6: 167-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (1313) Google Scholar). The binding of Dock180 to Elmo1 stabilizes the interaction with nucleotide-free Rac1 and additionally localizes the active protein complex at the plasma membrane (21.Lu M. Kinchen J.M. Rossman K.L.

Res. 2010; 107: 1102-1105Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Recent morpholino-based data identified Elmo1 as an important GEF in zebrafish blood vessels acting downstream of the Netrin-1/Unc5B signaling cascade (35.Epting D. Wendik B. Bennewitz K. Dietz C.T. Driever W. Kroll J. The Rac1 regulator ELMO1 controls vascular morphogenesis in zebrafish.Circ. Res. 2010; 107: 45-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Biochemical data and experiments in zebrafish further identified the activation of the Elmo1/Dock180/Rac1 signaling cascade by Netrin-1; yet, functional experiments in cultured ECs failed to show an activation of EC sprouting in response to Netrin-1 (35.Epting D. Wendik B. Bennewitz K. Dietz C.T. Driever W. Kroll J. The Rac1 regulator ELMO1 controls vascular morphogenesis in zebrafish.Circ. Res. 2010; 107: 45-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). This raised the question about the precise role of Elmo1 and Dock180 in the endothelium. In this study, we have identified a novel, cell intrinsic survival function of Elmo1/Dock180 in ECs. Overexpression of Elmo1/Dock180 reduces EC apoptosis in vitro and activates the pro-survival signaling cascade phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT. Furthermore, Elmo1 and Dock180 overexpression in zebrafish embryos reduces EC apoptosis and thereby inducing angiogenesis. Thus, our findings highlight the importance of Elmo1/Dock180 in angiogenesis by maintaining cell survival during embryonic blood vessel development. Zebrafish embryos of the tg(fli1:EGFP) line (36.Lawson N.D. Weinstein B.M. In vivo imaging of embryonic vascular development using transgenic zebrafish.Dev. Biol. 2002; 248: 307-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (1575) Google Scholar) were raised and staged as described before (37.Kimmel C.B. Ballard W.W. Kimmel S.R. Ullmann B. Schilling T.F. Stages of embryonic development of the zebrafish.Dev. Dyn. 1995; 203: 253-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (8703) Google Scholar). Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were isolated as described previously (38.Stoll S.J. Bartsch S. Kroll J. HOXC9 regulates formation of parachordal lymphangioplasts and the thoracic duct in zebrafish via stabilin 2.PloS one. 2013; 8: e58311Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). HUVECs and bovine aortic endothelial cells (BAECs) (39.Nacak T.G. Alajati A. Leptien K. Fulda C. Weber H. Miki T. Czepluch F.S. Waltenberger J. Wieland T. Augustin H.G. Kroll J. The BTB-Kelch protein KLEIP controls endothelial migration and sprouting angiogenesis.Circ. Res. 2007; 100: 1155-1163Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) were cultivated in endothelial cell growth medium (ECGM, PromoCell) containing supplements, 10% FCS (Biochrom), and antibiotics. The following antibodies were used: goat anti-actin (I-19) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), rabbit anti-Akt (Cell Signaling), mouse anti-pAkt (S473) (587F11) (Cell Signaling), rabbit anti-Dock180 (H-70) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), goat anti-Elmo1 (Everest Biotech), mouse anti-Rac1 (Transduction Laboratories), mouse anti-pERK (E-4) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), rabbit anti-ERK1 (K-23) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), mouse anti human [pSer139]Histone H2AX (9F3) (Enzo Life Science), Cy3-conjugated secondary antibodies (Dianova), and HRP-conjugated antibodies (DAKO). In this study the following inhibitors were used: PI3K inhibitor LY 294002 (Biotrend), PAK inhibitor IPA3 (Tocris Bioscience). VEGF was purchased from R&D Systems, staurosporine from Sigma-Aldrich and Netrin-1 from Enzo Life Sciences. Transfection of HUVECs with siRNAs targeting Elmo1 or Dock180 was performed as described before (35.Epting D. Wendik B. Bennewitz K. Dietz C.T. Driever W. Kroll J. The Rac1 regulator ELMO1 controls vascular morphogenesis in zebrafish.Circ. Res. 2010; 107: 45-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). For adenoviral transduction of HUVECs, full-length cDNA of human Elmo1 or Dock180 was cloned into the adenoviral shuttle vector according to the Vira Power Adenovirus Expression Systems protocol (Invitrogen). Adenovirus particles of dominant-negative (RacN17) and constitutive-active (RacV12) Rac1 were kindly provided by Dr. Mauro Cozzolino (Santa Lucia Foundation, Rome, Italy). Efficient transduction was confirmed by Western blot analysis or immunofluorescence staining of HUVECs. HUVECs were transfected or adenovirally infected 48 h before the assay. The assay was performed as previously described (39.Nacak T.G. Alajati A. Leptien K. Fulda C. Weber H. Miki T. Czepluch F.S. Waltenberger J. Wieland T. Augustin H.G. Kroll J. The BTB-Kelch protein KLEIP controls endothelial migration and sprouting angiogenesis.Circ. Res. 2007; 100: 1155-1163Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The spheroids were stimulated upon embedding in collagen with 25 ng/ml VEGF for 24 h. The cumulative sprouting length was set in relation to control and is displayed in percent. To measure caspase 3 and 7 activity in HUVECs the Caspase-Glo® 3/7 Assay System (Promega) was used according to the manufacturer's protocol. For activity measurement upon staurosporine stimulation, HUVECs were seeded 48 h after transduction in a 96-well plate (1 × 104 cells/well) and cultivated in ECGM for 22 h, followed by stimulation with 2.5 μm staurosporine in ECGM for 2 h. For activity measurement upon serum starvation, HUVECs were seeded in a 96-well plate (5 × 103 cells/well) ∼32 h after transduction and cultivated in ECGM overnight. Then cells were starved in endothelial basal medium (ECBM, PromoCell, 0% FCS) for 24 h. For the inhibition of PI3K using LY 294002, medium was changed after 8 h of serum starvation and replaced by fresh ECBM complemented with 10 μm LY (or DMSO in an appropriate concentration in control wells), followed by further 16 h of incubation. For graphical presentation, the caspase-3/7 activity was set in relation to control and is displayed in percent. Detection of [pSer139]Histone H2AX activity was performed after Dock180 siRNA transfection, followed by 4 h of serum starvation in ECBM and subsequent Western blot analysis. To analyze HUVECs undergoing apoptosis by FACS, cells were stained with APC-conjugated annexin V (BD Pharmingen). To this end, HUVECs were seeded 48 h after adenoviral transduction in 6-well plates (3 × 105 cells/well) and cultivated in ECGM for 20 h, followed by stimulation with 2.5 μm staurosporine in ECGM for 4 h. For starvation experiments, 1.5 × 105 HUVECs were seeded per 6 well and cultivated in ECGM for 24 h. Subsequently, medium was changed to ECBM (0% FCS), and cells were starved for 24 h. At the end of the incubation time, cells were harvested, washed twice with PBS, and resuspended in 1× Binding Buffer (Bender MedSystems). Cell number was adjusted to 1 × 106 cells/ml and incubated with annexin V-APC and 7-AAD (Beckman-Coulter). FACS analysis was performed by the Mannheim Cell Sorting Core Facility of the Medical Faculty Mannheim using a BD FACSCanto II. For quantification, the annexin V-positive and 7-AAD-negative cell fraction was considered as the apoptotic cell fraction. The apoptotic cell fraction was set in relation to control (apoptotic cell fraction of pAd-GFP cells) and is displayed in percent. Western blot analysis was performed as previously described (40.Stoll S.J. Bartsch S. Augustin H.G. Kroll J. The transcription factor HOXC9 regulates endothelial cell quiescence and vascular morphogenesis in zebrafish via inhibition of interleukin 8.Circ. Res. 2011; 108: 1367-1377Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) using serum-starved HUVECs (overnight, ECBM, 0%FCS). HUVECs were adenovirally infected 48 h prior to the assay. For inhibition of PI3K by LY 294002 or PAK1 by IPA3, ECBM was changed 30 min (LY 294002) or 1 h (IPA3) before lysis and replaced by ECBM complemented with inhibitor (1 μm LY 294002 or 20 μm IPA3, respectively). Control cells were incubated with ECBM complemented with solvent in appropriate concentrations. For analysis of AKT activity upon Netrin-1 stimulation, BAECs were seeded in a 6-well plate (2.5 × 105 cells/well). Approximately 32 h later, cells were starved (ECBM, 2.5% FCS) for 16 h. Cells were treated with 100 ng/ml Netrin-1 for 5 min. Three independent experiments were performed, and a representative Western blot for each experiment is shown. Analysis of Rac1 activity was performed using the Rac1 binding domain of PAK1 fused to GST (GST-PBD) as described before (41.Del Galdo S. Vettel C. Heringdorf D.M. Wieland T. The activation of RhoC in vascular endothelial cells is required for the S1P receptor type 2-induced inhibition of angiogenesis.Cell. Signal. 2013; 25: 2478-2484Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Briefly, HUVECs were seeded in a 10-cm dish (2 × 106 cells/dish) and adenovirally transduced. 32 h after transduction, cells were starved overnight (ECBM, 0% FCS) followed by lysis, Rac1 pull-down, and Western blot analysis. Incubation of control lysate with 100 μm GTPγS (30 min, 37 °C) served as a positive control for Rac1 activation. Three independent experiments were performed, and a representative Western blot is shown. Synthesis and injection of zebrafish Elmo1 and Dock180 mRNA were performed using the SP6 mMessage mMachine Kit (Ambion) as previously described (35.Epting D. Wendik B. Bennewitz K. Dietz C.T. Driever W. Kroll J. The Rac1 regulator ELMO1 controls vascular morphogenesis in zebrafish.Circ. Res. 2010; 107: 45-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). For injections, 300 pg of mOrange, Elmo1, or Dock180 mRNA was used. For staurosporine treatment, dechorinated zebrafish embryos were incubated in eggwater containing 0.2% 1-phenyl-2-thiourea (PTU) (Sigma-Aldrich) and 3 μm staurosporine starting at 24 h postfertilization (hpf) (42.Kim M.J. Kang K.H. Kim C.H. Choi S.Y. Real-time imaging of mitochondria in transgenic zebrafish expressing mitochondrially targeted GFP.BioTechniques. 2008; 45: 331-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Embryos were fixed for TUNEL staining at 30 hpf. For whole-mount TUNEL staining of zebrafish embryos the ApopTag® Red In Situ Apoptosis Detection Kit (Chemicon) was used. For this purpose, 30 hpf zebrafish embryos were fixed for 1 h in 4% PFA/PBS, washed in PBST (1× PBS/0.1% Tween-20), followed by dehydration in increasing concentrations of methanol, and stored in 100% methanol overnight at −20 °C. Embryos were rehydrated in increasing concentrations of PBST and treated with Proteinase K (10 μg/ml, Roche) for 10 min. Embryos were washed in PBST and postfixed in 4% PFA/PBS for 20 min. After further washing with PBST, embryos were incubated in equilibration buffer for 1 h, followed by overnight incubation with working strength TdT enzyme at 37 °C. The reaction was stopped by incubation in working strength stop/wash buffer for 3 h at 37 °C. After washing in PBST, embryos were incubated in rhodamine antibody solution overnight at 4 °C followed by washing with PBST overnight at 4 °C. The embryos were further fixed in 4% PFA/PBS for 30 min, followed by washing in PBS. For quantification of apoptotic cells, embryos were embedded in 1% low melting agarose (Promega) and analyzed by confocal microscopy. For confocal microscopy, the fixed embryos were embedded in 1% low melting point agarose (Promega) and analyzed using a DM6000 B confocal microscope with Leica TCS SP5 DS scanner (Leica Microsystems). For quantification of apoptotic cells in zebrafish embryos, confocal images were further processed using ImageJ/Fiji. To exclude counting of nonspecific stained cells in the yolk sac, trunk tissue was selected using the polygon selection tool, and the selected area was measured. Note: the selected area for counting of total apoptotic cell number and apoptotic ECs remained the same in the respective embryo. Total apoptotic cell number was determined by the analyze particles tool of ImageJ/Fiji. Apoptotic ECs were counted manually. Counted apoptotic ECs were marked with the point tool to prevent double counting. The number of total apoptotic or apoptotic ECs per μm2 was calculated. For a clearer graphical presentation, values are set in relation to control group (mOrange RNA) and displayed as total apoptotic cells or apoptotic ECs in percent (n = 15–17 at 30 hpf of at least three independent experiments). For quantification of mean intersomitic vessel (ISV) length in 30 hpf zebrafish embryos, length of ISVs was measured using the segmented line tool of ImageJ/Fiji, and the mean number of ISV length per fish was calculated. Results are displayed as mean ISV length/fish in μm (n = 12–14 of three independent experiments). Quantification of Western blot signals was performed using Gel-Pro Analyzer 6.0 software (Media Cybernetics). Sample signals were set in relation to their respective loading controls and are displayed in percent. All results in this publication are expressed as means ± S.E. Comparisons between groups were analyzed by Student's t-test for in vitro assay"
https://openalex.org/W2039189377,"Background It is difficult to experimentally infect volunteers with RV strains to which the subject demonstrates serological immunity. However, in RV challenges, viral clearance begins before de novo adaptive immune responses would develop. We speculated that adaptive immunity to RV reflects heterologous immunity by effector memory cells. Methods DCs were generated from monocytes using GM-CSF and IL-4 and RV39 loading accomplished with a dose of ∼350 TCID50/105 cells. RV-induced maturation was established as modulation of MHC class II, CD80, CD83, and CD86. Circulating RV targeting CD4 and CD8 T cells were investigated as induction of RV-specific proliferation (CFSE-dilution). Results Maturation of DC by RV was confirmed as upregulation of MHC Class II (83.3±5.0% to 87.8±4.1%), CD80 (39.4±7.2% to 47.6±7.7%) and CD86 (78.4±4.7% to 84.1±3.4%). Both CD4 and CD8 memory T cells were recognized in the circulation of healthy subjects. Conclusions RV drives DC maturation and results in their ability to present RV antigens to both T helper and cytotoxic lymphocytes. Both CD4 and CD8 cells capable of recognizing RV-associated antigens are present in the circulation of healthy subjects where they are presumably involved in immune surveillance and explain the rapid recruitment of an adaptive immune response during RV infection."

https://openalex.org/W1979358286,"Insulin receptor substrates (IRSs) have been shown to be major mediators of insulin signaling. Recently, we found that IRSs form high-molecular weight complexes, and here, we identify by yeast two-hybrid screening a novel IRS-1-associated protein: a 42-kDa cGMP-dependent protein kinase-anchoring protein (GKAP42). GKAP42 knockdown in 3T3-L1 adipocytes suppressed insulin-dependent IRS-1 tyrosine phosphorylation and downstream signaling, resulting in suppression of GLUT4 translocation to plasma membrane induced by insulin. In addition, GLUT4 translocation was also suppressed in cells overexpressing GKAP42-N (the IRS-1 binding region of GKAP42), which competed with GKAP42 for IRS-1, indicating that GKAP42 binding to IRS-1 is required for insulin-induced GLUT4 translocation. Long term treatment of 3T3-L1 adipocytes with TNF-α, which induced insulin resistance, significantly decreased the GKAP42 protein level. We then investigated the roles of cGMP-dependent kinase (cGK)-Iα, which bound to GKAP42, in these changes. cGK-Iα knockdown partially rescued TNF-α-induced decrease in GKAP42 and impairment of insulin signals.

TNF-α treatment suppressed the GKAP42 protein level.ConclusionTNF-α-induced insulin resistance is at least partially caused by GKAP42 protein level suppression.SignificanceWe identified a novel TNF-α-induced pathway involved in insulin resistance. Insulin receptor substrates (IRSs) have been shown to be major mediators of insulin signaling. Recently, we found that IRSs form high-molecular weight complexes, and here, we identify by yeast two-hybrid screening a novel IRS-1-associated protein: a 42-kDa cGMP-dependent protein kinase-anchoring protein (GKAP42). GKAP42 knockdown in 3T3-L1 adipocytes suppressed insulin-dependent IRS-1 tyrosine phosphorylation and downstream signaling, resulting in suppression of GLUT4 translocation to plasma membrane induced by insulin. In addition, GLUT4 translocation was also suppressed in cells overexpressing GKAP42-N (the IRS-1 binding region of GKAP42), which competed with GKAP42 for IRS-1, indicating that GKAP42 binding to IRS-1 is required for insulin-induced GLUT4 translocation. Long term treatment of 3T3-L1 adipocytes with TNF-α, which induced insulin resistance, significantly decreased the GKAP42 protein level.

In this study, we provide evidence suggesting that the SH2B1 level is increased during in vitro culture of hippocampal neurons, and the β isoform (SH2B1β) is the predominant isoform. The fact that formation of filopodia is prerequisite for neurite initiation suggests that SH2B1 may regulate filopodium formation and thus neurite initiation. To investigate whether SH2B1 may regulate filopodium formation, the effect of SH2B1 and a membrane and actin regulator, IRSp53 (insulin receptor tyrosine kinase substrate p53), is investigated. Overexpressing both SH2B1β and IRSp53 significantly enhances filopodium formation, neurite outgrowth, and branching. Both in vivo and in vitro data show that SH2B1 interacts with IRSp53 in hippocampal neurons. This interaction depends on the N-terminal proline-rich domains of SH2B1. In addition, SH2B1 and IRSp53 co-localize at the plasma membrane, and their levels increase in the Triton X-100-insoluble fraction of developing neurons.

https://openalex.org/W2052919205,"Blood vessels in the central nervous system supply a considerable amount of oxygen via intricate vascular networks. We studied how the initial vasculature of the spinal cord is formed in avian (chicken and quail) embryos. Vascular formation in the spinal cord starts by the ingression of intra-neural vascular plexus (INVP) from the peri-neural vascular plexus (PNVP) that envelops the neural tube. At the ventral region of the PNVP, the INVP grows dorsally in the neural tube, and we observed that these vessels followed the defined path at the interface between the medially positioned and undifferentiated neural progenitor zone and the laterally positioned differentiated zone. When the interface between these two zones was experimentally displaced, INVP faithfully followed a newly formed interface, suggesting that the growth path of the INVP is determined by surrounding neural cells. The progenitor zone expressed mRNA of vascular endothelial growth factor-A whereas its receptor VEGFR2 and FLT-1 (VEGFR1), a decoy for VEGF, were expressed in INVP. By manipulating the neural tube with either VEGF or the soluble form of FLT-1, we found that INVP grew in a VEGF-dependent manner, where VEGF signals appear to be fine-tuned by counteractions with anti-angiogenic activities including FLT-1 and possibly semaphorins. These results suggest that the stereotypic patterning of early INVP is achieved by interactions between these vessels and their surrounding neural cells, where VEGF and its antagonists play important roles."
https://openalex.org/W2054992103,"Calnexin is a type I integral endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane protein, molecular chaperone, and a component of the translocon. We discovered a novel interaction between the calnexin cytoplasmic domain and UBC9, a SUMOylation E2 ligase, which modified the calnexin cytoplasmic domain by the addition of SUMO. We demonstrated that calnexin interaction with the SUMOylation machinery modulates an interaction with protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B (PTP1B), an ER-associated protein tyrosine phosphatase involved in the negative regulation of insulin and leptin signaling. We showed that calnexin and PTP1B form UBC9-dependent complexes, revealing a previously unrecognized contribution of calnexin to the retention of PTP1B at the ER membrane. This work shows that the SUMOylation machinery links two ER proteins from divergent pathways to potentially affect cellular protein quality control and energy metabolism."

In this study, adenoviral expression of cMyBP-CC10mut in cultured adult rat cardiomyocytes was used to investigate protein localization and evaluate contractile function and Ca2+ transients, compared with wild-type cMyBP-C expression (cMyBP-CWT) and controls. Forty-eight hours after infection, 44% of cMyBP-CWT and 36% of cMyBP-CC10mut protein levels were determined in total lysates, confirming equal expression. Immunofluorescence experiments showed little or no localization of cMyBP-CC10mut to the C-zone, whereas cMyBP-CWT mostly showed C-zone staining, suggesting that cMyBP-CC10mut could not properly integrate in the C-zone of the sarcomere. Subcellular fractionation confirmed that most cMyBP-CC10mut resided in the soluble fraction, with reduced presence in the myofilament fraction. Also, cMyBP-CC10mut displayed significantly reduced fractional shortening, sarcomere shortening, and relaxation velocities, apparently caused by defects in sarcomere function, because Ca2+ transients were unaffected.

Interestingly, this serogroup has previously been associated with an acute epidemic polyarthritis-like illness in humans; however, there has been no ensuing genetic characterisation. Here we report the complete genome sequences of Mapputta and Maprik viruses, and a new Mapputta group candidate, Buffalo Creek virus, previously isolated from mosquitoes and detected by serology in a hospitalised patient. Phylogenetic analyses indicate that the group is one of the earliest diverged groups within the genus Orthobunyavirus of the family Bunyaviridae. Analyses show that these three viruses are related to the recently sequenced Australian bunyaviruses from mosquitoes, Salt Ash and Murrumbidgee. A notable feature of the Mapputta group viruses is the absence of the NSs (non-structural) ORF commonly found on the S segment of other orthobunyaviruses. Viruses of the Mapputta group have been isolated from geographically diverse regions ranging from tropical Papua New Guinea to the semi-arid climate of south-eastern Australia. The relevance of this group to human health in the region merits further investigation."

To understand the stability of depressive symptoms during middle adulthood, we investigated the nature of the distribution of depressive symptoms. Methods We analyzed 24,890 subjects aged 15 to 84 years who participated in the Active Survey of Health and Welfare, Japan. Depressive symptoms were assessed using the Japanese version of the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D). The descriptive statistics and frequency curves of the distributions were then compared according to age group. Results The distribution of depressive symptoms was stable through middle adulthood. The right tail which covers clinical depression was more stable than the left tail or peak of the distributions. The right tail of the distribution during middle adulthood exhibited a linear pattern with a log-normal scale. Conclusions The right tail of the distribution of depressive symptoms is stable and exhibits an exponential pattern during middle adulthood."
https://openalex.org/W2017214037,"Background Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified dozens of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with type 2 diabetes risk. We have previously confirmed the associations of genetic variants in HHEX, CDKAL1, VEGFA and FTO with type 2 diabetes in Han Chinese. However, the cumulative effect and predictive value of these GWAS identified SNPs on the risk of type 2 diabetes in Han Chinese are largely unknown. Methodology/Principal Findings We conducted a two-stage case-control study consisting of 2,925 cases and 3,281controls to examine the association of 30 SNPs identified by GWAS with type 2 diabetes in Han Chinese. Significant associations were found for proxy SNPs at KCNQ1 [odds ratio (OR) = 1.41, P = 9.91 × 10–16 for rs2237897], CDKN2A/CDKN2B (OR = 1.30, P = 1.34 × 10–10 for rs10811661), CENTD2 (OR = 1.28, P = 9.88 × 10-4 for rs1552224) and SLC30A8 (OR = 1.19, P = 1.43 × 10-5 for rs13266634). We further evaluated the cumulative effect on type 2 diabetes of these 4 SNPs, in combination with 5 SNPs at HHEX, CDKAL1, VEGFA and FTO reported previously. Individuals carrying 12 or more risk alleles had a nearly 4-fold increased risk for developing type 2 diabetes compared with those carrying less than 6 risk alleles [adjusted OR = 3.68, 95% confidence interval (CI): 2.76–4.91]. Adding the genetic factors to clinical factors slightly improved the prediction of type 2 diabetes, with the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve increasing from 0.76 to 0.78. However, the difference was statistically significant (P < 0.0001). Conclusions/Significance We confirmed associations of SNPs in KCNQ1, CDKN2A/CDKN2B, CENTD2 and SLC30A8 with type 2 diabetes in Han Chinese. The utilization of genetic information may improve the accuracy of risk prediction in combination with clinical characteristics for type 2 diabetes."

The engagement of CD40 with its cognate ligand, CD154, leads to a sequence of cellular events in B lymphocytes, including CD40 cytoplasmic translocation, a temporal and spatial organization of effector molecules, and a cascade of CD40-induced signal transduction. The JLP scaffold protein was expressed in murine B lymphocytes. Using B lymphocytes from jlp-deficient mice, we observed that JLP deficiency resulted in defective CD40 internalization upon CD154/CD40 engagement.

Here we isolate phage B8b from the Mediterranean Sea using Pseudoalteromonas sp. QC-44 as a host and characterize it using myriad techniques. Morphologically, phage B8b was classified as a member of the Siphoviridae family. One-step growth analyses showed that this siphovirus had a latent period of 70 min and released 172 new viral particles per cell. Host range analysis against 89 bacterial host strains revealed that phage B8b infected 3 Pseudoalteromonas strains (52 tested, >99.9% 16S rRNA gene nucleotide identity) and 1 non-Pseudoaltermonas strain belonging to Alteromonas sp. (37 strains from 6 genera tested), which helps bound the phylogenetic distance possible in a phage-mediated horizontal gene transfer event. The Pseudoalteromonas phage B8b genome size was 42.7 kb, with clear structural and replication modules where the former were delineated leveraging identification of 16 structural genes by virion structural proteomics, only 4 of which had any similarity to known structural proteins. In nature, this phage was common in coastal marine environments in both photic and aphotic layers (found in 26.5% of available viral metagenomes), but not abundant in any sample (average per sample abundance was 0.65% of the reads). Together these data improve our understanding of siphoviruses in nature, and provide foundational information for a new ‘rare virosphere’ phage–host model system."

To explore abnormalities associated with cloning or nuclear transfer (NT) as the most invasive of these methods, we used a bovine model to characterize abnormalities. Detailed necropsy examinations were done on 13 calves that died soon after birth; in addition, we included data from embryos and fetuses (produced by NT) that terminated prematurely. Bovine clones that survived until the neonatal period differed quantitatively and qualitatively from in-vivo-derived cattle. Although alterations affected a variety of organs (e.g. heart, lung and liver), there was a clear association with abberant vascular developmental during the early intrauterine phase. Therefore, we concluded that vascular problems were key alterations induced by cloning (presumably via epigenetic modifications)."
https://openalex.org/W2139536473,"Despite the widespread use of aerial baiting to manage epizootics among free-ranging populations, particularly in rabies management, bait acceptance and seroconversion rates often are lower than required to eliminate spread of disease. Our objectives in this study, therefore, were to evaluate the performance of stratified bait distribution models derived from resource selection functions (RSF) on uptake of placebo rabies baits by raccoons (Procyon lotor) and Virginia opossums (Didelphis virginiana), as well as the probability of bait uptake as a function of proximity to bait distribution areas in fragmented agricultural ecosystems. Among 478 raccoons and 108 opossums evaluated for presence of Rhodamine B (RB) across 8 sites, only 26% of raccoons and 20% of opossums exhibited marking consistent with bait consumption 14–24 days post-baiting. The effective area treated, based on 90% kernel density estimators of marked individuals, ranged from 99–240 ha larger than bait distribution zones, with RB marked individuals captured up to 753m beyond the bait zone. Despite incorporation of RSF data into bait distribution models, no differences in uptake rates were observed between treatment and control sites. These data likely reflect the underlying constraints imposed by the loss and fragmentation of habitat on animal movement in heterogeneous landscapes, forcing individuals to optimize movements at coarse (i.e., patch-level) rather than fine spatial scales in highly fragmented environments. Our data also confirm that the probability of bait acceptance decreases with increasing distance from bait zone interiors, even within the zone itself. Thus, although bait acceptance was confirmed beyond bait zone boundaries, the proportion of vaccinated individuals may comprise a small minority of the population at increasing distances from baiting interiors. These data suggest focal baiting creates a buffered area of treated individuals around bait zones or bait stations, but repeated treatments may be needed to achieve sufficient uptake to eradicate disease."

However, S. macedonicus is closely related to commensal opportunistic pathogens of the Streptococcus bovis/Streptococcus equinus complex. Methodology/Principal Findings We analyzed the pSMA198 plasmid isolated from the dairy strain Streptococcus macedonicus ACA-DC 198 in order to provide novel clues about the main ecological niche of this bacterium. pSMA198 belongs to the narrow host range pCI305/pWV02 family found primarily in lactococci and to the best of our knowledge it is the first such plasmid to be reported in streptococci. Comparative analysis of the pSMA198 sequence revealed a high degree of similarity with plasmids isolated from Lactococcus lactis strains deriving from milk or its products. Phylogenetic analysis of the pSMA198 Rep showed that the vast majority of closely related proteins derive from lactococcal dairy isolates. Additionally, cloning of the pSMA198 ori in L. lactis revealed a 100% stability of replication over 100 generations. Both pSMA198 and the chromosome of S. macedonicus exhibit a high percentage of potential pseudogenes, indicating that they have co-evolved under the same gene decay processes. We identified chromosomal regions in S. macedonicus that may have originated from pSMA198, also supporting a long co-existence of the two replicons. pSMA198 was also found in divergent biotypes of S. macedonicus and in strains isolated from dispersed geographic locations (e.g. Greece and Switzerland) showing that pSMA198’s acquisition is not a recent event. Conclusions/Significance Here we propose that S. macedonicus acquired plasmid pSMA198 from L. lactis via an ancestral genetic exchange event that took place most probably in milk or dairy products. We provide important evidence that point towards the dairy origin of this species."

The effect of dietary fatty acids on the expression levels and activities of hepatic drug metabolizing enzymes.J. Health Sci. 2003; 49: 105-114Crossref Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Upon entering the cell, fatty acids are bound by fatty acid-binding protein and then either esterified and stored as triglycerides or coenzyme A-conjugated and used for energy production (28.Abumrad N.A. Davidson N.O. Role of the gut in lipid homeostasis.Physiol. Rev. 2012; 92: 1061-1085Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). The effect of acyl-CoAs on UGT activity in vitro depends on concentration and microsomal pretreatment with de-latency agents (e.g. detergents or alamethicin). High acyl-CoA concentrations inhibited whereas lower concentrations enhanced UGT activity. In intact microsomes, acyl-CoAs and free unsaturated fatty acids resulted in activity enhancement, but in detergent-treated microsomes activity was reduced (29.Okamura K. Ishii Y. Ikushiro S. Mackenzie P.I. Yamada H. Fatty acyl-CoA as an endogenous activator of UDP-glucuronosyltransferases.Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2006; 345: 1649-1656Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Unsaturated fatty acids could inhibit glucuronidation of 4-methylumbelliferone by human kidney cortical microsomes and recombinant UGT1A9 and UGT2B7 enzymes. The greater the degree of fatty acid unsaturation, the more pronounced the inhibition (30.Tsoutsikos P. Miners J.O. Stapleton A. Thomas A. Sallustio B.C. Knights K.M. Evidence that unsaturated fatty acids are potent inhibitors of renal UDP-glucuronosyltransferases (UGT): kinetic studies using human kidney cortical microsomes and recombinant UGT1A9 and UGT2B7.Biochem. Pharmacol. 2004; 67: 191-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Studies using recombinant enzyme found that PUFAs inhibited UGT1A1 glucuronidation of estradiol in vitro with docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) having the greatest effect. DHA also inhibited enzyme activity in vivo, increasing bilirubin levels 48 h after oral administration of low concentrations of DHA, but high DHA concentrations had the opposite effect (31.Shibuya A. Itoh T. Tukey R.H. Fujiwara R. Impact of fatty acids on human UDP-glucuronosyltransferase 1A1 activity and its expression in neonatal hyperbilirubinemia.Sci. Reports. 2013Crossref Scopus (22) Google Scholar). In addition, this and other studies have reported an increase in UGT expression with unsaturated fatty acid feeding. This could be explained by in vitro results that show that PUFA metabolites of the lipoxygenase or cyclooxygenase pathways and some free fatty acids activate peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors α and γ (PPARα and PPARγ), which then stimulate UGT gene transcription (32.Barbier O. Villeneuve L. Bocher V. Fontaine C. Torra I.P. Duhem C. Kosykh V. Fruchart J.C. Guillemette C. Staels B.

The examples given above indicate that fatty acids can have a different impact on UGT activity and expression depending on the model and conditions employed. In this study, different tissue culture models were employed to investigate the effect of dietary fatty acids on glucuronidation of epicatechin. This compound was chosen as there are increasing numbers of reports on the effects of this class of compounds on NO metabolism, and glucuronidation of epicatechin is low in vitro (35.Vaidyanathan J.B.

Caco-2 and HT29-MTX cells were routinely cultured in low glucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 15% fetal bovine serum (FBS) for Caco-2 and 10% FBS for HT29-MTX, 100 units/ml penicillin, 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin, and 0.25 μg/ml amphotericin B (full medium) at 37 °C with 5% CO2 in a humidified atmosphere. Cells were subcultured when reaching ∼90% confluency and seeded into flasks at 1 × 104 cm−2. For metabolism experiments and surface biotinylation, cells were seeded onto Corning transwell plates of 4.67 cm2 growth area (Lowell) at a ratio of 24:76 HT29-MTX/Caco-2 and a seeding density of 6 × 104 cm−2, unless stated otherwise. Both cell lines were maintained in full medium containing 10% FBS and 50 μm fatty acid dissolved in ethanol (final concentration 0.5%) or the corresponding amount of solvent for controls during their entire differentiation time of 21 days. Cells supplemented with DHA or eicosapentaenoic acid and their controls were also incubated with 100 μm of the antioxidant α-tocopherol. The medium was replaced every other day. For gene expression studies and protein quantification, cells were seeded onto 6-well plastic plates. HepG2 cells were grown in minimum essential medium (MEM) supplemented with 10% FBS, nonessential amino acids, 100 μm sodium pyruvate, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin. Cells were seeded on 6-well plastic plates at a seeding density of 1 × 105 cm−2. On day 22 or day 5 after seeding (Caco-2/HT29-MTX or HepG2, respectively), cells were washed twice with HBSS, and if grown on permeable supports, transepithelial electrical resistance was measured using a Millicell ERS Ohm meter in HBSS + 1.8 mm Ca2+. The average transepithelial electrical resistance of co-cultures grown in 6-well transwell plates was 300 ohms. Cell layers were incubated with 200 μm epicatechin, and 100 μm ascorbic acid was dissolved in HBSS + 1.8 mm Ca2+ either for 120 min (HepG2) or for 90 min from the apical or basolateral side (co-cultures and HT29-MTX cells). After incubation of cells with epicatechin, 1.5 ml of the transport buffer was removed, acidified with 100 mm acetic acid, mixed with 50 μm of the internal standard 3,4-dimethoxycinnamic acid and 100 μm ascorbic acid. Cell layers were then washed three times with HBSS and lysed with 80% methanol containing 100 μm ascorbic acid and 5 μm internal standard. Cells were then scraped, collected with the lysate, and vortexed vigorously. The lysate was then centrifuged, and the supernatant was dried under vacuum and reconstituted in 100 μl of solvent A. For LC-MS/MS analysis of epicatechin metabolites, separation was achieved with an Agilent 1200 series HPLC on a Phenomenex Kinetex C18 column (2.6 μm, 150 × 2.1 mm) and a 10-μl sample injection. Solvent A consisted of 94.5% MilliQ water, 5% acetonitrile, and 0.5% formic acid. Solvent B consisted of 94.5% acetonitrile, 5% MilliQ water, and 0.5% formic acid. The flow rate was 0.4 ml/min. The solvent gradient started at 0% B for 3 min, a linear increase to 50% solvent B from 3 to 16 min, 100% solvent B for 4 min, and return to 0% solvent B at 23 min (39.Clarke K.A. Dew T.P.

Epicatechin aglycone and conjugates were detected with an Agilent 6410 triple quadrupole LC-MS/MS in negative MRM mode for the following transitions: epicatechin (m/z = 289 → 245), methyl-epicatechin (m/z = 303 → 165), epicatechin-sulfate (m/z = 369 → 289), epicatechin-glucuronide (m/z = 465 → 289), methyl-epicatechin-sulfate (m/z = 383 → 303), methyl-epicatechin-glucuronide (m/z = 479 → 303). Identification of metabolite stereoisomers was achieved by comparison with previous publications where authentic standards were available. Actis-Goretta et al. (40.Actis-Goretta L. Lévèques A.

Med. 2012; 53: 787-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar) employed very similar chromatography conditions as described here, and therefore peaks in the this study were identified accordingly. For estimation of relative concentration, the volume of the HT29-MTX cell monolayer was calculated using immunofluorescence (IF) staining of the cell membrane as detailed below. The distance between the apical and basolateral membrane was measured by confocal microscopy and was an average of 15 μm estimated from 24 independent experiments. With a growth area of 4.67 cm2 for transwell plates and 9.5 cm2 for solid 6-well plates, the volume of a cell monolayer was calculated as 7 and 14 μl, respectively. For UGT1A protein detection, HT29-MTX cells grown on solid supports were washed with ice-cold PBS, scraped, and lysed in RIPA buffer containing 0.5% protease inhibitor mixture by gently rocking the samples on ice for 30 min. The lysate was centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 10 min, and the total protein concentration of the supernatant was determined by BCA microplate assay according to the manufacturer's instructions. For the biotinylation and pulldown experiments, UGT1A protein abundance was determined using the ProteinSimple system “SIMON” according to the manufacturer's instructions with the following modifications: loading time of the stacking matrix was increased to 17.0 s, loading time of the sample was increased to 12.0 s, and separation time was increased to 47.0 min. Samples were denatured by incubation with sample buffer at room temperature for 30 min. All primary antibodies were used at a dilution of 1:100. For analysis of UGT1A protein level after DHA treatment, the ProteinSimple system “WES” was used according to standard protocol, and the primary antibody incubation was extended to 1 h. α-Actinin (1:200) was used as a loading control in the same capillary with UGT1A (1:100). A standard curve was constructed with different amounts of cell lysate to test linearity of both antibodies and loading sample concentration; 0.08 mg/ml was found optimal for signals of both antibodies. Quantification of peak areas and gel image reconstruction was carried out using ProteinSimple Compass software. Three molecular weight fluorescent standards, incorporated with every sample, were run in every capillary and used to assign the molecular weights to the corresponding peaks. HT29-MTX cells grown on permeable supports were washed twice with ice-cold PBS and incubated with 0.25 mg/ml EZ-Link Sulfo-NHS-LC-biotin dissolved in HBSS + 1.8 mm CaCl2 from either the apical or basolateral side. After 4 h of incubation on ice, the reaction was stopped by the addition of 40 mm Tris to quench the remaining Sulfo-NHS-LC-biotin. Cells were washed twice with Tris-buffered saline (TBS) and lysed with RIPA buffer containing 0.5% protease inhibitor mixture. After rocking on ice for 20 min, lysates were centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 10 min, and the supernatant was incubated with 25 μl of high capacity streptavidin-agarose resin overnight at 8 °C with constant gentle shaking. The supernatant was removed; the resin washed three times with TBS, and samples were eluted in 20 μl of 4× ProteinSimple sample buffer containing 0.2 m DTT. 10 μl of sample was used for analysis by capillary electrophoresis as described above. HT29-MTX cells were seeded onto Millicell cell culture inserts (12-well, PET 0.4 μm pore size, Millipore) at a density of 6 × 104 cm−2 and maintained for 21 days. For staining, cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS, permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100, and incubated with UGT1A (sc-25847) and MRP1 (sc-18835) antibody at a dilution of 1:50 for 1 h. After washing with PBS, cells were further incubated with Alexa488-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG and CyTM3-conjugated donkey anti-mouse IgG obtained from Jackson ImmunoResearch (West Grove, PA) at a 1:300 dilution. Alternatively, to visualize endoplasmic reticulum, calnexin primary antibody (sc-6465) was used at a 1:20 dilution followed by Alexa488-conjugated donkey anti-goat secondary antibody. In these experiments, UGT1A was simultaneously detected using the sc-23847 primary antibody and CyTM3-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG. After that, cell layers were stained with 0.2 μg/ml DAPI and mounted on microscope slides with ProLong Gold antifade reagent mounting medium (Molecular Probes, Carlsbad, CA). Cells were imaged using Zeiss LSM510 or LSM700 confocal microscopes. Widefield images of Caco-2/HT29-MTX co-cultures were acquired using the Leica EL6000 microscope. Percentage of each cell line in the monolayer at day 21 was calculated from widefield images using the ImageJ software (National Institutes of Health). Cells were seeded onto solid supports at 6 × 104 cm−2 and maintained in full medium supplemented with DHA or vehicle for 22 days (Caco-2 and HT29-MTX) or 5 days (HepG2). Cells were washed with HBSS and scraped, and mRNA was extracted using the Ambion RNAqueous kit from Invitrogen, according to the manufacturer's protocol. RNA (1 μg) was transcribed to cDNA using the Applied Biosystems high capacity RNA to cDNA kit. 100 ng of cDNA were used to analyze gene expression by TaqMan real time PCR using Applied Biosystems TaqMan gene expression assays and TaqMan gene expression master mix according to the manufacturer's protocol on a StepOnePlus real time PCR system. GAPDH was used as reference (NM_002046.3, VIC/MGB_PL, 4326317E). The QX100 Droplet digital PCR system (Bio-Rad) was used to quantify expression of different UGT1A isoforms in HT29-MTX cells from three biological replicates in three seeding experiments (total n = 9), with three technical replicates (total n = 27). mRNA was extracted as above, and following DNase treatment (TURBO DNA-free kit, Ambion, Invitrogen), to exclude genomic DNA contamination, 1 μg was transcribed to cDNA as above. 65 ng of transcribed DNA diluted with Milli-Q water to 9 μl was introduced in every 20-μl assay/well, including 1 μl of UGT FAMTM-labeled TaqMan primer (Invitrogen) and 10 μl of digital droplet PCR Supermix for Probes (Bio-Rad). Droplets were generated according to the manufacturer's guidelines with the QX100 Droplet generator (Bio-Rad) before cycling in a C1000 Touch thermal cycler (Bio-Rad) at optimal temperature for every primer for 30 min followed by 95 °C (10 min), 40 cycles of 94 °C (0.5 min) followed by 60 °C (60 min), and 98 °C (10 min).

The polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism strategy was used to detect osteocalcin gene rs1800247 and rs1543297 polymorphisms.Compared with healthy controls, the rs1800247 HH and Hh genotypes were associated with a significantly increased susceptibility to HCC (HH versus hh: OR = 6.828, 95% CI 2.620-17.795, P < 0.001; Hh versus hh: OR = 6.306, 95% CI 3.480-11.423, P < 0.001, respectively). Similarly, the subjects bearing the H allele of rs1800247 had more than a 2.4-fold increased risk for development of HCC (OR = 2.484, 95% CI 1.747-3.532, P < 0.001) compared with those bearing the h allele. In addition, we found significant decreased serum osteocalcin levels in HBV-related HCC patients (11.73 ± 8.18 ng/mL) compared with healthy controls (15.3 ± 6.06 ng/mL). Furthermore, the serum osteocalcin levels were significantly lower in HCC patients than healthy controls among the individuals with heterozygous Hh genotype (P = 0.003) and CT genotype (P < 0.001). In contrast, there were no significant differences in the genotype and allele of rs1543297 polymorphisms between the groups of patients and healthy controls.These findings for the first time suggest that genetic variant in osteocalcin gene rs1800247 polymorphisms may be a risk factor for HBV-related HCC. We also find an inverse association of serum osteocalcin levels with HCC."
https://openalex.org/W2060177749,"Objectives To examine the association of individual income and end of life (EOL) care in older cancer decedents in Taiwan. Design Retrospective cohort study. Setting National Health Insurance Research Database (NHIRD) in Taiwan. Participants 28,978 decedents >65 years were diagnosed with cancer and died during 2009-2011 in Taiwan. Of these decedents, 10941, 16535, and 1502 were categorized by individual income as having low, moderate, and high SES, respectively. Main outcome measures Indicators of aggressiveness of EOL care: chemotherapy use before EOL, more than one emergency department (ER) visit, more than one hospital admission, hospital length of stay >14 days, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, and dying in a hospital. Results Low individual income was associated with more aggressive EOL treatment (estimate -0.30 for moderate income, -0.27 for high income, both p<0.01). The major source of aggressiveness was the tendency for older decedents with low income to die in the acute care hospital. The indicators had an increasing trend from 2009 to 2011, except for hospital stay >14 days. Conclusions Low individual income is associated with more aggressive EOL treatment in older cancer decedents. Public health providers should make available appropriate education and hospice resources to these decedents and their families, to reduce the amount of aggressive terminal care such decedents receive."
https://openalex.org/W2078332839,"In our previous study of 3-year-old children in a dioxin contamination hot spot in Vietnam, the high total dioxin toxic equivalent (TEQ-PCDDs/Fs)-exposed group during the perinatal period displayed lower Bayley III neurodevelopmental scores, whereas the high 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD)-exposed group displayed increased autistic traits. In autistic children, urinary amino acid profiles have revealed metabolic alterations in the amino acids that serve as neurotransmitters in the developing brain. Therefore, our present study aimed to investigate the use of alterations in urinary amino acid excretion as biomarkers of dioxin exposure-induced neurodevelopmental deficits in highly exposed 3-year-old children in Vietnam. A nested case-control study of urinary analyses was performed for 26 children who were selected from 111 3-year-old children whose perinatal dioxin exposure levels and neurodevelopmental status were examined in follow-up surveys conducted in a dioxin contaminated hot spot. We compared urinary amino acid levels between the following 4 groups: (1) a high TEQ-PCDDs/Fs and high TCDD-exposed group; (2) a high TEQ-PCDDs/Fs but low TCDD-exposed group; (3) a low TEQ-PCDDs/Fs exposed and poorly developed group; and (4) a low TEQ-PCDDs/Fs exposed and well-developed group. Urinary levels of histidine and tryptophan were significantly decreased in the high TEQ-PCDDs/Fs and high TCDD group, as well as in the high TEQ-PCDDs/Fs but low TCDD group, compared with the low TEQ-PCDDs/Fs and well-developed group. However, the ratio of histidine to glycine was significantly lower only in the high TEQ-PCDDs/Fs and high TCDD group. Furthermore, urinary histidine levels and the ratio of histidine to glycine were significantly correlated with neurodevelopmental scores, particularly for language and fine motor skills. These results indicate that urinary histidine is specifically associated with dioxin exposure-induced neurodevelopmental deficits, suggesting that urinary histidine may be a useful marker of dioxin-induced neurodevelopmental deficits and that histaminergic neurotransmission may be an important pathological contributor to dioxin-mediated neurotoxicity."
https://openalex.org/W2143536707,"The objective of this study was to explore the effect of a forward sloping seat on posture and muscular activity of the trunk and lower limbs. To this aim, twelve asymptomatic participants were tested in six conditions varying seat slope (0°, 15° forward) and height (high, medium, low). Angular position of head, trunk and pelvis was assessed with an inertial orientation system, and muscular activity of 11 superficial postural muscles located in the trunk and lower limbs was estimated using normalized EMG. Results showed that a forward sloping seat, compared to a flat seat, induced a greater activity of the soleus (p<0.01), vastus lateralis (p<0.05) and vastus medialis (p<0.05), as well a lower hip flexion (p<0.01). In contrast, no significant variation of head, trunk and pelvis angular position was observed according to seat slope. It was concluded that forward sloping seats increase the load sustained by the lower limbs, without a systematic improvement of body posture."
https://openalex.org/W2122381855,"Patients with epilepsy have a high prevalence of comorbid mood disorders. This study aims to evaluate whether negative affect in epilepsy is associated with dysfunction of emotion regulation. Event-related potentials (ERPs) are used in order to unravel the exact electrophysiological time course and investigate whether a possible dysfunction arises during early (attention) and/or late (regulation) stages of emotion control. Fifty epileptic patients with (n = 25) versus without (n = 25) comorbid negative affect plus twenty-five matched controls were recruited. ERPs were recorded while subjects performed a face- or house-matching task in which fearful, sad or neutral faces were presented either at attended or unattended spatial locations. Two ERP components were analyzed: the early vertex positive potential (VPP) which is normally enhanced for faces, and the late positive potential (LPP) that is typically larger for emotional stimuli. All participants had larger amplitude of the early face-sensitive VPP for attended faces compared to houses, regardless of their emotional content. By contrast, in patients with negative affect only, the amplitude of the LPP was significantly increased for unattended negative emotional expressions. These VPP results indicate that epilepsy with or without negative affect does not interfere with the early structural encoding and attention selection of faces. However, the LPP results suggest abnormal regulation processes during the processing of unattended emotional faces in patients with epilepsy and comorbid negative affect. In conclusion, this ERP study reveals that early object-based attention processes are not compromised by epilepsy, but instead, when combined with negative affect, this neurological disease is associated with dysfunction during the later stages of emotion regulation. As such, these new neurophysiological findings shed light on the complex interplay of epilepsy with negative affect during the processing of emotional visual stimuli and in turn might help to better understand the etiology and maintenance of mood disorders in epilepsy."
