https://openalex.org/W1972313386,"The V(D)J recombination process insures the somatic diversification of immunoglobulin and antigen T cell receptor encoding genes. This reaction is initiated by a DNA double-strand break (dsb), which is resolved by the ubiquitously expressed DNA repair machinery. Human T-B-severe combined immunodeficiency associated with increased cellular radiosensitivity (RS-SCID) is characterized by a defect in the V(D)J recombination leading to an early arrest of both B and T cell maturation. We previously mapped the disease-related locus to the short arm of chromosome 10. We herein describe the cloning of the gene encoding a novel protein involved in V(D)J recombination/DNA repair, Artemis, whose mutations cause human RS-SCID. Protein sequence analysis strongly suggests that Artemis belongs to the metallo-beta-lactamase superfamily."

It destroys most air pollutants and many gases involved in ozone depletion and the greenhouse effect. Global measurements of 1,1,1-trichloroethane (CH 3 CCl 3 , methyl chloroform) provide an accurate method for determining the global and hemispheric behavior of OH. Measurements show that CH 3 CCl 3 levels rose steadily from 1978 to reach a maximum in 1992 and then decreased rapidly to levels in 2000 that were lower than the levels when measurements began in 1978. Analysis of these observations shows that global OH levels were growing between 1978 and 1988, but the growth rate was decreasing at a rate of 0.23 ± 0.18% year −2 , so that OH levels began declining after 1988. Overall, the global average OH trend between 1978 and 2000 was −0.64 ± 0.60% year −1 . These variations imply important and unexpected gaps in current understanding of the capability of the atmosphere to cleanse itself."

We report the cloning and characterization of ephexin, a novel Eph receptor-interacting protein that is a member of the Dbl family of guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) for Rho GTPases. Ephrin-A stimulation of EphA receptors modulates the activity of ephexin leading to RhoA activation, Cdc42 and Rac1 inhibition, and cell morphology changes. In addition, expression of a mutant form of ephexin in primary neurons interferes with ephrin-A-induced growth cone collapse. The association of ephexin with Eph receptors constitutes a molecular link between Eph receptors and the actin cytoskeleton and provides a novel mechanism for achieving highly localized regulation of growth cone motility."
https://openalex.org/W2053763318,"The COP9 signalosome is an evolutionary conserved multiprotein complex of unknown function that acts as a negative regulator of photomorphogenic seedling development in Arabidopsis. Here, we show that plants with reduced COP9 signalosome levels had decreased auxin response similar to loss-of-function mutants of the E3 ubiquitin ligase SCFTIR1. Furthermore, we found that the COP9 signalosome and SCFTIR1 interacted in vivo and that the COP9 signalosome was required for efficient degradation of PSIAA6, a candidate substrate of SCFTIR1. Thus, the COP9 signalosome may play an important role in mediating E3 ubiquitin ligase-mediated responses."
https://openalex.org/W1990425248,"Serotonin N-acetyltransferase (AANAT) controls the daily rhythm in melatonin synthesis. When isolated from tissue, AANAT copurifies with isoforms epsilon and zeta of 14-3-3. We have determined the structure of AANAT bound to 14-3-3zeta, an association that is phosphorylation dependent. AANAT is bound in the central channel of the 14-3-3zeta dimer, and is held in place by extensive interactions both with the amphipathic phosphopeptide binding groove of 14-3-3zeta and with other parts of the central channel. Thermodynamic and activity measurements, together with crystallographic analysis, indicate that binding of AANAT by 14-3-3zeta modulates AANAT's activity and affinity for its substrates by stabilizing a region of AANAT involved in substrate binding."
https://openalex.org/W2019042091,"Deposition of β-amyloid (Aβ) peptides in the brain is an early and invariant feature of all forms of Alzheimer's disease. As with any secreted protein, the extracellular concentration of Aβ is determined not only by its production but also by its catabolism. A major focus of Alzheimer's research has been the elucidation of the mechanisms responsible for the generation of Aβ. Much less, however, is known about the mechanisms responsible for Aβ removal in the brain. In this report, we describe the identification of endothelin-converting enzyme-1 (ECE-1) as a novel Aβ-degrading enzyme. We show that treatment of endogenous ECE-expressing cell lines with the metalloprotease inhibitor phosphoramidon causes a 2–3-fold elevation in extracellular Aβ concentration that appears to be due to inhibition of intracellular Aβ degradation. Furthermore, we show that overexpression of ECE-1 in Chinese hamster ovary cells, which lack endogenous ECE activity, reduces extracellular Aβ concentration by up to 90% and that this effect is completely reversed by treatment of the cells with phosphoramidon. Finally, we show that recombinant soluble ECE-1 is capable of hydrolyzing synthetic Aβ40 and Aβ42 in vitro at multiple sites.

Aβ is normally produced from the β-amyloid precursor protein (βAPP) through the combined proteolytic actions of β- and γ-secretase and is then secreted into the extracellular milieu (1Checler F. J. Neurochem. 1995; 65: 1431-1444Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar, 2Golde T.E. Eckman C.B. Younkin S.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1502: 172-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). The degree of Aβ accumulation is dependent not only on its production but also on the mechanisms responsible for its removal. While considerable effort has been directed at elucidating the enzymes and pathways contributing to the production of Aβ, much less is known regarding Aβ catabolism. Aβ catabolism is likely to involve proteases at multiple sites, both intracellular and extracellular. Proteases acting at the site of Aβ generation and/or within the secretory pathway may degrade the peptide intracellularly, thus limiting the amount of the peptide available for secretion. The concentration of secreted Aβ may be further regulated by direct degradation by extracellular proteases and by receptor-mediated endocytosis or phagocytosis followed by lysosomal degradation. Catabolism of Aβ peptides at each of these steps would limit the accumulation of extracellular Aβ, and disruption of this catabolism may be a risk factor for AD. Additionally, the identification of enzymes that degrade Aβ intracellularly and extracellularly may lead to development of novel therapeutics aimed at reducing Aβ concentration by enhancing its removal. Recent reports suggest a role for both insulin-degrading enzyme and neprilysin (NEP) in the degradation of extracellular Aβ (3Kurochkin I.V. Goto S.

In this report, we describe the identification of endothelin-converting enzyme-1 (ECE-1) as a novel Aβ-degrading enzyme. The endothelin converting enzymes are a class of type II integral membrane zinc metalloproteases (active site luminal) named for their ability to hydrolyze a family of biologically inactive intermediates, big endothelins (big ETs), exclusively at a Trp21–Val/Ile22 bond to form the potent vasoconstrictors endothelins (14Turner A.J. Murphy L.J. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1996; 51: 91-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). In addition to this specific cleavage event, ECE-1 has been reported to hydrolyze several biologically active peptides in vitro, including bradykinin, neurotensin, substance P, and oxidized insulin B chain by cleaving on the amino side of hydrophobic residues (15Hoang M.V. Turner A.J. Biochem. J. 1997; 327: 23-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 16Johnson G.D. Stevenson T. Ahn K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4053-4058Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Two different endothelin-converting enzymes have been cloned. The first identified, ECE-1, is abundantly expressed in the vascular endothelial cells of all organs and is also widely expressed in nonvascular cells of tissues including lung, pancreas, testis, ovary, and adrenal gland (17Xu D.

Cytochem. 1999; 47: 447-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). A comprehensive analysis examining both ECE activity and expression in human brain has not been reported. Studies have, however, detected human ECE-1 immunoreactivity in fibers within the glial limitans and neuronal processes and cell bodies of the cerebral cortex (18Davenport A.P. Kuc R.E. Plumpton C. Mockridge J.W. Barker P.J. Huskisson N.S. Histochem. J. 1998; 30: 359-374Crossref Scopus (31) Google Scholar). In rats, ECE-1 immunoreactivity has been detected in pyramidal cells of the hippocampus and in cultured primary astrocytes (20Barnes K. Walkden B.J. Wilkinson T.C. Turner A.J. J. Neurochem. 1997; 68: 570-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Four isoforms of human ECE-1 differing only in the cytoplasmic tail are produced by a single gene located on chromosome 1 (1p36) through the use of alternate promoters (17Xu D. Emoto N. Giaid A.

Biochem. 1999; 264: 341-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). The four isoforms cleave big ETs with equal efficiency but differ primarily in their subcellular localization and tissue distribution (24Schweizer A. Valdenaire O. Nelbock P. Deuschle U. Dumas Milne Edwards J.B. Stumpf J.G. Loffler B.M. Biochem. J. 1997; 328: 871-877Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar, 25Valdenaire O. Lepailleur-Enouf D. Egidy G. Thouard A. Barret A. Vranckx R. Tougard C. Michel J.B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 264: 341-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Human ECE-1a is localized predominantly to the plasma membrane (24Schweizer A. Valdenaire O. Nelbock P. Deuschle U. Dumas Milne Edwards J.B. Stumpf J.G. Loffler B.M. Biochem. J. 1997; 328: 871-877Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar, 25Valdenaire O. Lepailleur-Enouf D. Egidy G. Thouard A. Barret A. Vranckx R. Tougard C. Michel J.B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 264: 341-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Human ECE-1c and ECE-1d have also been reported to be localized predominantly to the plasma membrane with additional intracellular expression detected (24Schweizer A. Valdenaire O. Nelbock P. Deuschle U. Dumas Milne Edwards J.B. Stumpf J.G. Loffler B.M. Biochem. J. 1997; 328: 871-877Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar,25Valdenaire O. Lepailleur-Enouf D. Egidy G. Thouard A.

In contrast, human ECE-1b appears to be localized exclusively intracellularly. Co-immunolocalization studies performed by Schweizeret al. (24Schweizer A. Valdenaire O. Nelbock P. Deuschle U. Dumas Milne Edwards J.B. Stumpf J.G. Loffler B.M. Biochem. J. 1997; 328: 871-877Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar) on human ECE-1b-transfected CHO cells indicate the presence of this isoform in the trans-Golgi network (TGN). Azaraniet al. similarly demonstrated that human ECE-1b was located in an intracellular compartment when expressed in Madin-Darby canine kidney cells (26Azarani A. Boileau G. Crine P. Biochem. J. 1998; 333: 439-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), and Cailler et al. (27Cailler F. Zappulla J.P. Boileau G. Crine P. Biochem. J. 1999; 341: 119-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) demonstrated that a dileucine motif in the cytosolic tail of ECE-1b was probably responsible for its intracellular localization. In an endogenous ECE-1b- and ECE-1c-expressing cell line, ECV304, ECE-1 immunoreactivity was detected in intracellular Golgi-like structures as well as at the cell surface (24Schweizer A. Valdenaire O. Nelbock P. Deuschle U. Dumas Milne Edwards J.B. Stumpf J.G. Loffler B.M. Biochem. J. 1997; 328: 871-877Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Bovine ECE-1b, which corresponds to human ECE-1c, is also localized predominantly on the plasma membrane (28Emoto N. Nurhantari Y. Alimsardjono H. Xie J. Yamada T. Yanagisawa M. Matsuo M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1509-1518Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). However, in contrast to human ECE-1a, bovine ECE-1a has convincingly been shown to be constitutively targeted to the lysosome (28Emoto N. Nurhantari Y. Alimsardjono H. Xie J. Yamada T. Yanagisawa M. Matsuo M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1509-1518Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). This difference between the localization of human and bovine ECE-1a may be due to the fact that the isoform-specific N-terminal region of ECE-1a is poorly conserved between the species. In fact, Emoto et al. (28Emoto N. Nurhantari Y. Alimsardjono H. Xie J. Yamada T. Yanagisawa M. Matsuo M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1509-1518Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) identified lysosome-targeting signals in the N-terminal tail of bovine ECE-1a that are not conserved in human ECE-1a. ECE-2 is a homologous enzyme with catalytic activity similar to that of ECE-1. Bovine ECE-2 has been cloned and is encoded by a separate gene from ECE-1 (29Emoto N. Yanagisawa M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15262-15268Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar). The sequence and chromosomal location of the human ECE-2 gene have not been reported. However, Nagase et al. (30Nagase T. Ishikawa K. Miyajima N. Tanaka A. Kotani H. Nomura N. Ohara O. DNA Res. 1998; 5: 31-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar) recently reported the cloning of an unidentified human brain cDNA, KIAA0604, that shares 93% identity with the bovine ECE-2 gene and is located on human chromosome 3. Given the similarity to bovine ECE-2, this cDNA probably represents human ECE-2. ECE-2 is localized intracellularly and has an acidic pH optimum (29Emoto N. Yanagisawa M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15262-15268Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar). Immunocytochemical analysis of endogenous ECE-2 in HUVECs revealed a punctate pattern of staining consistent with expression of ECE-2 in acidic intracellular vesicles of the constitutive secretory pathway (31Russell F.D. Davenport A.P. Circ. Res. 1999; 84: 891-896Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Northern blot analysis of bovine tissues revealed that ECE-2 is most abundantly expressed in neural tissues including cerebral cortex, cerebellum, and adrenal medulla, with low level expression detected in many other tissues (29Emoto N. Yanagisawa M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15262-15268Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar). In mouse brain, ECE-2 is expressed in heterogeneous populations of neurons in the thalamus, hypothalamus, amygdala, dentate gyrus, and CA3 (32Yanagisawa H. Hammer R.E. Richardson J.A. Emoto N. Williams S.C. Takeda S. Clouthier D.E. Yanagisawa M. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 105: 1373-1382Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Like ECE-1, ECE-2 cleaves big ET-1 most efficiently among the three big ETs (24Schweizer A. Valdenaire O. Nelbock P. Deuschle U. Dumas Milne Edwards J.B. Stumpf J.G. Loffler B.M. Biochem. J. 1997; 328: 871-877Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar, 29Emoto N. Yanagisawa M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15262-15268Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar). Another member of the ECE family, ECE-3, has recently been purified from bovine iris microsomes and is highly specific for the conversion of big ET-3 (33Hasegawa H. Hiki K. Sawamura T. Aoyama T. Okamoto Y. Miwa S. Shimohama S. Kimura J. Masaki T. FEBS Lett. 1998; 428: 304-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The enzyme responsible for this activity has not yet been cloned. The role that ECE may play in Alzheimer's disease has not been previously explored. Here we present both pharmacological and biochemical evidence that ECE-1 can hydrolyze Aβ both in vitro and in vivo. These data indicate a potential role for this enzyme family in Aβ catabolism. Human Aβ was measured by sandwich ELISA as previously described (34Suzuki N. Cheung T.T. Cai X.D. Odaka A. Otvos Jr., L. Eckman C. Golde T.E. Younkin S.G. Science. 1994; 264: 1336-1340Crossref PubMed Scopus (1354) Google Scholar), using the BAN50/BA27 and BAN50/BC05 antibody systems (Takeda) to detect Aβ40 and Aβ42, respectively. Hamster Aβ derived from CHO cells was measured using the BNT77/BA27 and BNT77/BC05 antibody systems. The BNT77 antibody (Takeda) was raised against amino acids 11–28 and thus may recognize amino-terminally modified or truncated peptides (35Asami-Odaka A. Ishibashi Y. Kikuchi T. Kitada C. Suzuki N. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 10272-10278Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Aβ concentration was determined by comparing values obtained for samples with those obtained for synthetic Aβ40 and Aβ42 standards (Bachem). ECE-1a and ECE-1b were cloned by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction in two fragments (joined by a unique PvuII site) from human umbilical vein endothelial cell (HUVEC, ATCC) RNA using the following primers (restriction sites underlined): 1) ECE-1a forward, 5′-CAGGAATTCGCCACCATGCCTCTCCAGGGCCTGGGCCTGC-3′; 2) ECE-1b forward, 5′-CAGGAATTCGCCACCATGCGGGGCGTGTGGCCGCCC-3′; 3) ECE-1 PvuII reverse, 5′-CAGCAGCTTCCCCAGCTGGACC-3′; 4) ECE-1 PvuII forward, 5′-GGTCCAGCTGGGGAAGCTGCTG-3′; and 5) ECE-1 reverse, 5′-GCTCTAGATTACCAGACTTCGCACTTGTGAGGCGGG-3′. RNA was prepared from HUVEC cells using the Qiagen RNeasy miniprep kit and was reverse transcribed using Superscript II reverse transcriptase and an oligo(dT) primer (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The 5′ fragment of ECE-1a was amplified using primers 1 and 3. The 5′ fragment of ECE-1b was amplified using primers 2 and 3. The 3′ fragment of ECE-1, which is common to both isoforms, was amplified using primers 4 and 5.Pfu polymerase (Stratagene) was used for all amplifications. The 5′ and 3′ fragments were ligated together at the PvuII site and subcloned into pcDNA3 (Invitrogen) using primer-encodedEcoRI and XbaI sites. The sequences of the constructs were confirmed by dideoxy sequencing by the Mayo Molecular Biology Core Facility. Unless otherwise noted, cell culture reagents were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc., and cell lines were purchased from ATCC. HUVECs were cultured in Kaighn's F12K medium (ATCC) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 0.1 mg/ml heparin, 0.03 mg/ml endothelial cell growth supplement (Sigma), 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. CHO cells were cultured in Ham's F-12 medium (BioWhittaker) supplemented with 10% newborn calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. H4 cells (human neuroglioma origin) were cultured in Opti-MEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. For passaging of cells prior to experiments in which ECE activity was to be measured, a highly purified trypsin (Sigma T-7418) solution was used (17Xu D. Emoto N. Giaid A. Slaughter C. Kaw S. deWit D. Yanagisawa M. Cell. 1994; 78: 473-485Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (862) Google Scholar). CHO cells were transfected with FuGENE 6 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) according to the directions of the manufacturer. Stable lines were generated by selecting pcDNA3-transfected cells (ECE-1a and ECE-1b) with 1 mg/ml Geneticin and pSecTag-transfected cells (solECE-1) with 0.8 mg/ml Zeocin (Invitrogen). Cell membrane fractions were prepared as described by Xu et al. (17Xu D. Emoto N. Giaid A. Slaughter C. Kaw S. deWit D. Yanagisawa M. Cell. 1994; 78: 473-485Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (862) Google Scholar). Protein concentration was determined by BCA assay (Pierce) in membranes resuspended in buffer B (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, containing 250 mm sucrose) or in membranes solubilized in buffer B containing 2.5% C12E10(polyoxyethylene-10-lauryl ether, Sigma). For measurement of ECE activity, membrane fractions (10–50 μg of protein) were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C with 0.1 μm big ET-1 (1–38) (American Peptide Co.) in 0.1 m sodium phosphate buffer (pH 6.8) containing 0.5 m NaCl, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), 100 μm leupeptin, and 20 μm pepstatin. Duplicate reactions were carried out in the presence of phosphoramidon (100 μm). Reactions were stopped by the addition of EDTA (5 mm), and mature ET-1-(1–21) peptide was quantitated by sandwich ELISA (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Cells were passaged into six-well plates 1 day prior to treatment and were utilized at confluence. Triplicate wells were washed twice with Hanks' balanced salt solution and then incubated for 17–24 h with 1 ml of growth medium containing phosphoramidon (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), thiorphan (Sigma), or captopril (Sigma) at the indicated concentrations. Control cells were incubated in growth medium containing an equal concentration of vehicle (phosphate-buffered saline). After treatment, the culture medium was harvested and spun at 14,000 × g, and the supernatant was analyzed for Aβ40 and Aβ42 by sandwich ELISA as described and for secreted APP by Western blot. To assess cellular toxicity of the compounds, MTS assays (CellTiter 96®, Promega), which measure the conversion of MTS to formazan by metabolically active cells, were performed on the cells after the indicated time points. Culture medium was subjected to electrophoresis on 10–20% Tricine gels (Novex) and was subsequently transferred to Immobilon P (Millipore Corp.). Western blots on CHO cells were performed using 22C11 antibody (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) to detect secreted APP. Bound antibody was detected by incubation with the appropriate horseradish peroxidase-linked secondary antibody (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) followed by ECL Western blotting reagents (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and exposure to x-ray film. A construct encoding a soluble form of ECE-1 similar to that described by Ahnet al. (36Ahn K. Herman S.B. Fahnoe D.C. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1998; 359: 258-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) and Korth et al. (37Korth P. Egidy G. Parnot C. LeMoullec J.M. Corvol P. Pinet F. FEBS Lett. 1997; 417: 365-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) was generated by amplifying the extracellular domain of ECE-1a using the following primers: SolECE-1 forward, 5′-GAGAGAATTCTCAGTACCAGACAAGATCCCC-3′; SolECE-1 reverse, 5′-CGTTTTCCTTTTGCGGCCGCCCAGACTTCGCACTTGTGAGG-3′. The solECE-1 construct was subcloned using primer-encodedEcoRI and NotI sites into pSecTag2B (Invitrogen), which incorporates a leader sequence onto the N terminus of the protein for secretion by mammalian cells and sequential c-Myc and His6 tags at the C terminus to facilitate detection and purification. The sequence of the construct was confirmed by dideoxy sequencing by the Mayo Molecular Biology Core Facility. A stable solECE-1 secreting cell line was generated by transfecting the construct into CHO cells and selecting with Zeocin (0.8 mg/ml). At confluence, the cells were washed twice with Hanks' balanced salt solution and then cultured for 48 h in serum-free medium (CHO-S-SFM II) containing 1 mm sodium butyrate. Conditioned medium was filtered through a 0.2-μm filter and dialyzed against binding buffer, 0.05 m sodium phosphate, pH 8.0, 0.3m NaCl, prior to purification via the C-terminal His6 tag using Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (Qiagen). Bound protein was eluted from the Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose with binding buffer containing 100 mm imidazole. The solECE-1 was initially estimated to be ≤25% pure, as assessed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Coomassie staining (data not shown). The concentration of active solECE-1 was further estimated by determining the second order rate of big ET-1 hydrolysis and dividing this rate by the publishedk cat/K m . Specifically, big ET-1 (0.1 μm) was reacted at 37 °C with solECE-1 in 50 mm MES, pH 6.5, containing 100 mm NaCl, 0.05% bovine serum albumin, 1 mm PMSF, 100 μmleupeptin, and 20 μm pepstatin. The reactions were stopped by the addition of EDTA (5 mm), and mature ET-1 peptide was measured by sandwich ELISA (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The second order rate was determined as the apparent rate constantk from Equation 1, y=1−e−ktwhere y is the fraction of substrate hydrolyzed andt is the time. Since k =k cat/K m × [E], the calculated k was then divided by the reportedk cat/K m for big ET-1 hydrolysis by solECE-1 (2.52 × 104m−1 s−1at pH 6.5) (16Johnson G.D. Stevenson T. Ahn K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4053-4058Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar) to determine the active enzyme concentration. The active enzyme concentration was estimated by this method throughout this report and was ∼30-fold lower than that originally estimated from the protein concentration and Coomassie-stained gel, suggesting either that our estimation of purity by Coomassie staining was incorrect or that a majority of the solECE-1 was in an inactive form. To control for the presence of co-purifying native CHO proteins, conditioned serum-free medium from nontransfected CHO cells was purified as above, and the eluted proteins were used in control experiments. SolECE-1 was preincubated for 15 min at room temperature with the ECE inhibitor PD069185 (synthesized according to published methods (38Ahn K. Sisneros A.M. Herman S.B. Pan S.M. Hupe D. Lee C.

The amount of solECE used in this reaction was estimated to be ∼6 nm. As a control, Aβ was incubated with Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid-purified proteins from nontransfected CHO cells or in reaction buffer alone. Following incubation at 37 °C for the indicated time points, the reactions were stopped by the addition of 5 mm EDTA. Aβ concentration was then analyzed using a highly specific sandwich ELISA, which captures Aβ via binding of antibody BAN50 to the N terminus and detects full-length peptides ending at position 40 (BA27) or 42 (BC05). Thus, Aβ that has been cleaved will not be detected in this assay. To further analyze the degradation of Aβ by solECE-1, the enzyme was incubated as above with3H-radiomethylated Aβ40 (0.56 μm, 2 × 104 dpm), a gift from Dr. T. L. Rosenberry. Aβ peptide and fragments were resolved by reversed-phase HPLC on a Vydac C4 column using a linear gradient of 0–100% B in 60 min (A buffer = 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in water; B buffer = 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in acetonitrile). Fractions were collected and counted in a Beckman LS 6500 scintillation counter. solECE-1 (∼20 nm) was incubated as above with synthetic Aβ40 (100 μm) for 17 h at 37 °C. The digest samples were run on an Applied Biosystems 130A Separation System (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) using a C4 reversed-phase column (Brownlee Aquapore BU-300; 2.1 × 220 mm). The peptides were eluted with a gradient of 5–80% B over a period of 69 min (A buffer = 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid; B buffer = 80% acetonitrile, 20% water, 0.09% trifluoroacetic acid). The flow rate was 200 μl/min, and absorbance was monitored at 215 nm. Half-minute fractions were collected, and peaks were analyzed by mass spectrometry and Edman sequencing. The masses of the collected peptides were determined with a PerSeptive Biosystems MALDI-TOF Voyager DE-RP Mass Spectrometer (Framingham, MA) operated in the delayed extraction and reflector mode using α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid. The first two amino acids of each peptide were determined using an Applied Biosystems Procise 492 sequencer. In an attempt to determine the K m of Aβ40 hydrolysis by solECE-1, we incubated the enzyme (∼17 nm) with synthetic Aβ40 (3, 10, and 20 μm) for 0 or 6 h at 37 °C in 50 mm MES buffer, pH 6.5, containing 0.05% bovine serum albumin, 1 mm PMSF, 100 μm leupeptin, and 20 μm pepstatin. Control reactions were carried out in the absence of enzyme or in the presence of solECE-1 inhibited by phosphoramidon (100 μm). The reactions were stopped by the addition of EDTA (5 mm), and Aβ40 concentration was determined by sandwich ELISA using the BAN50/BA27 system. The rate of Aβ hydrolysis in these assays was linear with respect to substrate concentration, precluding a determination of K m andV max. We next determined the second order rate constant,k cat/K m , for Aβ40 hydrolysis relative to that for big ET-1 hydrolysis by solECE-1. The second order rate for hydrolysis of each substrate was determined at substrate concentrations well below K m . Specifically, Aβ40 (2.5 μm) and big ET-1 (0.1 μm) were incubated in triplicate al"

Two crystal structures of a SIR2 homolog from Archaeoglobus fulgidus complexed with NAD have been determined at 2.1 A and 2.4 A resolutions. The structures reveal that the protein consists of a large domain having a Rossmann fold and a small domain containing a three-stranded zinc ribbon motif. NAD is bound in a pocket between the two domains. A distinct mode of NAD binding and an unusual configuration of the zinc ribbon motif are observed. The structures also provide important insights into the catalytic mechanism of NAD-dependent protein deacetylation by this family of enzymes."

We have elucidated the mechanism of apical localization of wingless and pair-rule transcripts in the Drosophila blastoderm embryo by directly visualizing intermediates along the entire path of transcript movement. After release from their site of transcription, mRNAs diffuse within the nucleus and are exported to all parts of the cytoplasm, regardless of their cytoplasmic destinations. Endogenous and injected apical RNAs assemble selectively into cytoplasmic particles that are transported apically along microtubules. Cytoplasmic dynein is required for correct localization of endogenous transcripts and apical movement of injected RNA particles. We propose that dynein-dependent movement of RNA particles is a widely deployed mechanism for mRNA localization."

The inhibitory activity of p85 is relieved by occupancy of the NH2-terminal SH2 domain of p85 by phosphorylated tyrosine. Src family kinases phosphorylate tyrosine 688 in p85, a process that we have shown to be reversed by the activity of the p85-associated SH2 domain-containing phosphatase SHP1. We demonstrate that phosphorylation of the downstream PI3K target Akt is increased in cells lacking SHP1, implicating phosphorylation of p85 in the regulation of PI3K activity. Furthermore, the in vitrospecific activity of PI3K associated with tyrosine- phosphorylated p85 is higher than that associated with nonphosphorylated p85. Expression of wild-type p85 inhibits PI3K enzyme activity as indicated by PI3K- dependent Akt phosphorylation. The inhibitory activity of p85 is accentuated by mutation of tyrosine 688 to alanine and reversed by mutation of tyrosine 688 to aspartic acid, changes that block and mimic tyrosine phosphorylation, respectively Strikingly, mutation of tyrosine 688 to aspartic acid completely reverses the inhibitory activity of p85 on cell viability and activation of the downstream targets Akt and NFκB, indicative of the physiological relevance of p85 phosphorylation. Tyrosine phosphorylation of Tyr688 or mutation of tyrosine 688 to aspartic acid is sufficient to allow binding to the NH2-terminal SH2 domain of p85. Thus an intramolecular interaction between phosphorylated Tyr688 and the NH2-terminal SH2 domain of p85 can relieve the inhibitory activity of p85 on p110.

Growth factor-responsive Class IA PI3Ks consist of heterodimers of a 110-kDa catalytic subunit associated with an 85-kDa noncatalytic regulatory subunit designated p85. The p85 adapter subunits are encoded by at least three different genes with splice variation generating multiple proteins potentially serving many different functions (1Fruman D.A. Snapper S.B. Yballe C.M. Davidson L., Yu, J.Y. Alt F.W. Cantley L.C. Science. 1999; 283: 393-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (572) Google Scholar). Of the known p85 adapter subunits and splice variants, nearly all contain two Src-homology 2 (SH2) domains, which enable p85 to bind phosphotyrosine in an appropriate amino acid context. The p85 SH2 domains most frequently, but not exclusively, recognize phosphotyrosine embedded in a YXXM motif (2Songyang Z. Shoelson S.E. McGlade J. Olivier P. Pawson T. Bustelo X.R. Barbacid M. Sabe H. Hanafusa H. Yi T. Ren R. Baltimore D. Ratnofsky S. Feldman R.A. Cantley L.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2777-2785Crossref PubMed Scopus (834) Google Scholar). Most p85 gene products also include a Src homology 3 (SH3) domain, as well as other domains involved in protein-protein interactions (3Wymann M.P. Pirola L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1436: 127-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (579) Google Scholar). All p85 family members contain a p110-binding motif located between the two SH2 domains. The diversity of protein interaction domains found among p85 family members likely contributes to the ability of multiple signaling proteins and pathways to activate PI3K. Under resting conditions, p85 serves to both stabilize p110 protein and inhibit PI3K lipid kinase activity, thereby increasing the amount of inert p110 available for activation (4Yu J. Zhang Y. McIlroy J. Rordorf-Nikolic T. Orr G.A. Backer J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1379-1387Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This inhibitory effect is alleviated by binding of the SH2 domains of p85, and in particular the NH2-terminal SH2 domain, to tyrosine-phosphorylated peptides, as well as tyrosine-phosphorylated receptors or linker molecules containing the YXXM motif (4Yu J. Zhang Y. McIlroy J. Rordorf-Nikolic T. Orr G.A. Backer J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1379-1387Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Tyrosine phosphorylation of p85 binding sites within growth factor receptor cytoplasmic domains and linker molecules thus results in the recruitment of p85 to the cell membrane with consequent release of p85-mediated inhibition of PI3K (4Yu J.

Previous data from our group have revealed that coexpression of a constitutively active form of Lck with PI3K in COS cells results in an increase in PI3K activity (9Cuevas B. Lu Y. Watt S. Kumar R.

In this system, coincident expression of SHP-1 is associated with a decrease in PI3K activity, while expression of a phosphatase-inactive form of SHP-1 increases PI3K activity. These data suggest that phosphorylation/dephosphorylation of Tyr688, a residue that maps within the p85 carboxyl SH2 domain, provides a mechanism for regulating PI3K activity. The data described herein directly address this latter possibility and demonstrate that tyrosine phosphorylation of p85 and, more specifically of Tyr688, regulates PI3K activity, NFκB activation, and growth factor deprivation-induced cell death. The data also link these effects of Tyr688 phosphorylation to the formation of an intramolecular complex with the p85 NH2-terminal domain relieving the inhibitory effect of p85 on p110. The anti-phosphotyrosine monoclonal antibody (4G10, IgG2B) and the rabbit polyclonal antibody against the p85 subunit of PI3K were purchased from Upstate Biotechnology (Lake Placid, NY). The rabbit polyclonal antibodies against Akt and phospho-Akt were purchased from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA). A monoclonal antibody against hemagglutinin (12CA5, IgG1) was purified from cell culture supernatants of the hybridoma provided by Dr. Bing Su (University of Texas M. D.

COS7 cells were purchased from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). Baf/3 was a kind gift of Dr. Tada Taniguchi (University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan). Baf/3, MDA MB 468, and COS7 cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) containing penicillin/streptomycin (1%, Life Technologies, Inc.),l-glutamine (2 mm, Life Technologies, Inc.), and 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum (Sigma) at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere. IL-3-producing cells were purchased from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). Human epidermal growth factor was purchased from Sigma. After stimulation, the cells were pelleted, resuspended in 0.5 ml of lysis buffer (150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 50 mm ZnCl2, 50 mm NaF, 50 mm sodium orthophosphate, 2 mm EDTA, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1% Nonidet P-40) and incubated at 4 °C for 20 min. After centrifugation at 14,000 ×g for 5 min at 4 °C, postnuclear detergent cell lysates were collected. Plasmid cDNA was mutated using the QuikChange Mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) as per the manufacturer's guidelines. All mutations were confirmed by sequencing. Adherent cells were transfected by lipofection. Briefly, 4 × 105 cells were seeded on 100-mm cell culture plates and incubated in complete medium overnight. cDNA expression constructs were incubated in serum-free medium with LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.) at room temperature for 30 min, then diluted with serum-free medium and incubated with cells at 37 °C for 2 h, after which time the LipofectAMINE mixture was replaced with complete medium, and the cells were returned to 37 °C for 24 h. Complete medium was then removed, the cells rinsed, and incubation continued with serum-free medium for an additional 24 h. Baf/3 cells were transfected by electroporation at 250 V and 950 microfarads. Detergent cell lysates were incubated with the appropriate antibody as indicated (anti-HA, anti-p85) at 4 °C for 2 h followed by another 2-h incubation with protein A-Sepharose beads. The immunoprecipitates were washed with immunoprecipitation wash buffer (0.5% Triton X-100, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 1 mmEDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 0.2 mm sodium vanadate, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.5% Nonidet P-40). Proteins were eluted from the beads by boiling in 2× Laemmli buffer and separated by SDS-PAGE. Proteins were transferred to Immobilon (Millipore, Bedford, MA). Membranes were blocked in 3% bovine serum albumin and incubated with anti-p85 PI3K (1:1000), or anti-phosphotyrosine (1:3000), at room temperature for 2 h. Horseradish peroxidase-protein A or horseradish peroxidase-goat anti-mouse IgG was used as a secondary reagent. After extensive washing, the targeted proteins were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL). Where indicated, blots were stripped by treatment with 2% SDS and 100 mm β-mercaptoethanol in Tris-buffered saline and then reprobed with desired antibodies and detected by ECL. Cells were lysed in 1% Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer. Cell lysates normalized for protein levels were immunoprecipitated using anti-HA or anti-p85 and protein A-Sepharose. Nontransfected COS7 lysate immunoprecipitates were included as a negative control. PI3K activity was determined as described previously (9Cuevas B. Lu Y. Watt S. Kumar R. Zhang J. Siminovitch K.A.

To evaluate Akt phosphorylation, single cell suspensions of thymocytes were prepared from 2–3-week-old C3HeBFeJ motheaten (me) and wild-type control littermates derived from C3HeBFeJ me/+ breeding pairs maintained at the Samuel Lunenfeld Research Institute, Mount Sinai Hospital (Toronto, Ontario, Canada). For analysis of Akt phosphorylation, 5 × 107 thymocytes were resuspended in 100 µl of RPMI 1640 medium and incubated for 30 min at 4 °C with biotinylated anti-T cell antigen receptor antibody (1 µg/ml) or anti-CD3 (5 µg/ml) plus anti-CD28 (5 µg/ml) antibody. After removal of unbound antibody, cells were resuspended at a concentration of 2 × 108 cell/ml and incubated at 37 °C for 2 min with streptavidin (10 µg/ml) or anti-hamster IgG (10 µg/ml). After antibody stimulation, cells were pelleted by 0.5-min centrifugation and then lysed and analyzed as described above. Baf/3 cells were washed and reconstituted in complete medium at 11.25 × 106 cells/ml, mixed with the desired DNA, and electroporated. Samples were cultured in IL-3-free conditions for 48 h, then IL-3 was added to the sample, and the culture was continued for an additional 48 h. Triplicate 100-µl samples of each culture were transferred to a 96-well plate, mixed with 25 µl of MTT (5 mg/ml), and incubated at 37°C for 2 h. The samples were lysed with 100 µl of MTT lysis buffer (20% SDS in 50% N,N-dimethylformamide, pH 4.7) and absorbance at 570 nm determined. The luciferase assay kit was purchased from Promega (Madison, WI), and assays were carried out according to manufacturer's recommendations. We have previously demonstrated that SHP1 associates with PI3K and dephosphorylates the kinase at tyrosine 688 (9Cuevas B. Lu Y. Watt S. Kumar R. Zhang J. Siminovitch K.A. Mills G.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27583-27589Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar), a residue that maps within the p85 subunit and that has been shown to be phosphorylated by Src family kinases (8von Willebrand M.

These data indicate that SHP-1 modulates p85 tyrosine phosphorylation and raise the possibility that signal transduction through the PI3K pathway can be modulated by the SHP-1 tyrosine phosphatase. To investigate this possibility, resting and T cell antigen receptor-stimulated thymocytes from SHP-1-deficient motheaten mice were evaluated for PI3K activation using an assay of Akt Ser473 phosphorylation as a surrogate indicator of PI3K activity. As indicated in Fig.1, results of immunoblotting analysis revealed the level of Akt Ser473 phosphorylation induced in T cell antigen receptor-stimulated thymocytes to be markedly higher in motheaten compared with wild-type cells. These data indicate a role for SHP-1 in regulating not only p85 phosphorylation but also the activation of PI3K. By extension, these findings imply that the tyrosine phosphorylation status of p85 is relevant to the regulation of PI3K activity. To determine whether tyrosine phosphorylation of p85 alters the specific activity of PI3K, p85 activity was evaluated in either COS7 cells or COS7 cells transiently transfected with Lck Y505F, a constitutively active form of Lck that phosphorylates p85 at Tyr688 (8von Willebrand M.

To evaluate PI3K activity in relation to phosphorylation status, anti-p85 immunoprecipitates were prepared from either cell lysates subjected to preclearing with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (i.e. lysates immunodepleted of tyrosine-phosphorylated species) or alternatively from anti-phosphotyrosine immunoprecipitates (so as to isolate tyrosine phosphorylated p85 species). The amount of p85 present in each sample was determined by Western blotting, and equal amounts of p85 were then assessed for lipid kinase activity using phosphatidylinositol as a substrate. As indicated in Fig. 2, this analysis revealed the enzymatic activity of p110 associated with tyrosine phosphorylated p85 (i.e. the p85 present in anti-Tyr(P) immunoprecipitates) to be much greater than that associated with p85 immunoprecipitated from cell lysates precleared with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody. These results suggest that PI3K lipid kinase activity is increased in association with p85 tyrosine phosphorylation and therefore provide additional evidence that PI3K activity is regulated by tyrosine phosphorylation. The tyrosine residue at position 688 has previously been identified as the primary site of Lck-induced p85 phosphorylation (8von Willebrand M. Williams S. Saxena M. Gilman J. Tailor P. Jascur T. Amarante-Mendes G.P. Green D.R. Mustelin T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3994-4000Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). To evaluate the impact of phosphorylation at this site on PI3K activity, p85 expression constructs were derived in which Tyr688 was replaced by either an aspartate or an alanine residue. Due to the charged nature of aspartate, p85 Y688D protein would be predicted to mimic phosphorylated p85 protein; by contrast, Y688A cannot be phosphorylated and should therefore behave like nonphosphorylated p85 (13Wu Y. Spencer S.D. Lasky L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5765-5770Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 14Huang W. Erikson R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8960-8963Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). As indicated in Fig.3 A, expression of these proteins in COS7 cells or MDA MB 468 cells revealed that the p85 Y688D and the Y688A mutant proteins were not tyrosine-phosphorylated either as a consequence of Lck coexpression or activation of cells with epidermal growth factor (EGF). These data thus confirm that Tyr688 is the primary site of tyrosine phosphorylation in p85. To further address the relevance of Tyr688phosphorylation to PI3K activation, the effects of these mutant proteins on Akt Ser473 phosphorylation was also assessed. As illustrated in Fig. 3 B, overexpression of wild-type p85 was associated with a decrease in Akt phosphorylation, a result consistent with the putative inhibitory effects of native (i.e. nonphosphorylated p85) on p110 kinase activity (4Yu J. Zhang Y. McIlroy J. Rordorf-Nikolic T. Orr G.A. Backer J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1379-1387Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This effect was further accentuated in cells expressing the tyrosine nonphosphorylatable Y688A mutant protein (Fig. 3 B). By contrast, expression of the Y688D protein did not alter Akt phosphorylation, a result which implies that this protein facilitates p110 activation most likely by releasing the enzyme from p85-mediated inhibition. Conversion of Tyr688 to Ala or Asp did not alter association of p85 with p110 in the presence or absence of Lck (Fig. 3, B and C). Furthermore, Y688A and Y688D both associated equally with Cbl in the presence or absence of Lck (not presented), indicating that association with Cbl does not explain the differential effects of Y688A and Y688D on Akt phosphorylation. The effects of PI3K on cell survival are mediated at least in part by activation of Akt and the consequent phosphorylation and inactivation of pro-apoptotic proteins such as BAD (15del Peso L. Gonzalez-Garcia M. Page C. Herrera R. Nunez G. Science. 1997; 278: 687-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (1987) Google Scholar), GSK3 (16Pap M. Cooper G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19929-19932Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (955) Google Scholar), forkhead (17Brunet A. Bonni A. Zigmond M.J. Lin M.Z. Juo P. Hu L.S. Anderson M.J. Arden K.C.

Stanbridge E. Frisch S. Reed J.C. Science. 1998; 282: 1318-1321Crossref PubMed Scopus (2735) Google Scholar). To assess the relevance of p85 Tyr688 phosphorylation to these cellular events, the effects of wild-type and mutant p85 expression on cytokine deprivation-induced cell death were investigated using Baf/3, a cell line that undergoes apoptosis when cultured in the absence of IL-3 (19Leverrier Y. Thomas J. Perkins G.R. Mangeney M. Collins M.K. Marvel J. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 425-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). For these studies, the IL-3-dependent Baf/3 cells were transfected with the various mutant cDNAs and then were cultured in IL-3-free medium for 48 h to induce cytokine deprivation-induced apoptosis and for an additional 48 h with exogenous IL-3 to allow surviving cells to proliferate. This provides a more sensitive assay than assessing cell number following growth factor deprivation. As shown in Fig. 4, expression of wild-type and Y688A p85 in these cells was associated with their decreased survival as compared with cells expressing vector control. Although both wild-type and Y688A induced a decrease in cell survival, the wild-type protein inhibited survival more consistently than did Y688A (Fig. 3 B). In contrast, survival of cells expressing the Y688D mutant protein was not significantly different from that of vector control cells. Thus the expression of wild-type or Y688A p85 protein appears to inhibit PI3K activity and induce a decrease in cellular proliferation/survival, while expression of the Y688D protein has a negligible effect on cell survival. These data are therefore consistent with the contention that p85 phosphorylation modulates PI3K function and also with the capacity for aspartic acid substitution at position Tyr688 to disrupt p85 inhibitory effects on p110 activity. To further address the functional significance of p85 phosphorylation, the effects of the various p85 mutant proteins on NFκB-directed transcription events were next evaluated. This approach was based on data revealing that activated Akt phosphorylates the IKKβ complex, resulting in the phosphorylation and consequent ubiquitination and degradation of the NFκB inhibitor IκB (20Karin, M., and Ben-Neriah, Y. Annu. Rev. Immunol., 18, 621–663.Google Scholar). Dissociation from IκB allows NFκB to translocate to the nucleus and participate in the formation of functional transcription complexes (20Karin, M., and Ben-Neriah, Y. Annu. Rev. Immunol., 18, 621–663.Google Scholar). Accordingly, the ability of the p85 mutant proteins to alter transcription of an NFκB-driven luciferase reporter construct was used as another measure of their effects on PI3K activation. As illustrated in Fig. 5, an assessment of COS7 cells transfectants expressing Akt and either p85 wild-type, Y688A, or Y688D proteins revealed that both wild-type and Y688A p85 significantly inhibited transcription of the NFκB consensus promoter (p < 0.05). In contrast, the Y688D mutant p85 did not inhibit NFκB-driven luciferase production. These data, which imply that Tyr688 phosphorylation status modulates transcription through NFκB, are again consistent with the notion that p85 phosphorylation regulates p110 enzymatic activity. Interaction of phosphotyrosine with the NH2-terminal SH2 domain of p85 has been shown to relieve the inhibitory activity of p85 on p110 (4Yu J. Zhang Y. McIlroy J. Rordorf-Nikolic T. Orr G.A. Backer J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1379-1387Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As phosphorylation of p85 Y688 appears to have this same effect on p110, it is possible that phosphorylated Tyr688 interacts with the NH2-terminal p85 SH2 domain so as to generate a structural arrangement that counteracts the inhibitory effects of this domain. Although Tyr688 does not map within the consensus binding motif for the p85 NH2-terminal SH2 domain (YXXM), previous data have identified the capacity of nonconsensus sequences to bind to the p85 subunit (21Ponzetto C. Bardelli A. Maina F. Longati P. Panayotou G. Dhand R. Waterfield M.D. Comoglio P.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 4600-4608Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 22He T.C. Zhuang H. Jiang N. Waterfield M.D. Wojchowski D.M. Blood. 1993; 82: 3530-3538Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, this type of intramolecular interaction might be facilitated by a p85 structural conformation that positions the carboxyl terminus including Tyr688 in close proximity to the NH2-terminal SH2 domain of p85, a possibility predicted by previous molecular modeling data (3Wymann M.P. Pirola L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1436: 127-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (579) Google Scholar). Such an arrangement might evoke interaction of the NH2-terminal SH2 domain with the tyrosine-phosphorylated Tyr688 residue within the COOH-terminal SH2 domain. To begin addressing this possibility, the potential for p85 tyrosine phosphorylation to promote an interaction between Tyr688and the p85 NH2-terminal SH2 domain was studied using transfected COS7 cells coexpressing Lck Y505F and an epitope-tagged p85 carboxyl-terminal fragment (HACT) encompassing the Tyr688residue. The results of this analysis confirmed that Lck induces tyrosine phosphorylation of the HACT construct and revealed the capacity of endogenous p85 to coimmunoprecipitate with the tyrosine-phosphorylated p85 HACT domain but not the nonphosphorylated construct (Fig. 6 A). The data shown in Fig. 6 also demonstrate the capacity of a glutathioneS-transferase (GST)-linked amino-terminal SH2 domain fusion protein (NSH2-GST) to precipitate phosphorylated HACT (Fig.6 A) and HACT Y688D proteins but not a nonphosphorylated HACT construct. Together, these findings suggest that the amino-terminal SH2 domain of p85 associates with tyrosine-phosphorylated Tyr688. As shown in Fig. 6 B, mutation of tyrosine 688 to aspartate (to mimic tyrosine phosphorylation) allows the association between HACT and NSH2-GST protein to ensue in the absence of Lck Y505F, an observation that confirms the involvement of phosphorylated Tyr688 in this association and rules out the possibility that Lck Y505F acts as a linker in coupling these domains together. The biochemical events governing protein tyrosine phosphorylation are central to the regulation of cellular signaling in all eukaryotic cells. However, while a myriad of intracellular proteins undergo tyrosine phosphorylation following cell stimulation, for many proteins, the effects of phosphorylation on function are not well defined. This latter group of proteins includes PI3K, an enzyme that is inducibly tyrosine-phosphorylated in many biological contexts. It has been suggested that PI3K is negatively regulated by serine autophosphorylation of the p85 regulatory subunit (23Dhand R. Hiles I. Panayotou G. Roche S. Fry M.J. Gout I. Totty N.F. Truong O. Vicendo P. Yonezawa K. Kasuga M. Courtneidge S.A. Waterfield M.D. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 522-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar). However, interaction of the p85 SH2 domains with tyrosine-phosphorylated peptides appears to alleviate this inhibition, a finding that implies a role for tyrosine phosphorylation in regulating PI3K activity (4Yu J. Zhang Y. McIlroy J. Rordorf-Nikolic T. Orr G.A. Backer J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1379-1387Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This possibility is strongly supported by the current data showing that SHP-1, an enzyme that dephosphorylates the major tyrosine phosphorylation site on p85, Tyr688, down-regulates the PI3K/Akt activation pathway. Moreover, the current data, revealing lipid kinase activity to be higher in the p85 protein present in anti-phosphotyrosine immunoprecipitates than in the p85 protein immunoprecipitated from cell lysates immunodepleted for tyrosine phosphorylated species, also indicate a direct relationship between p85 phosphorylation status and PI3K activity. Enhanced PI3K activity in this latter experiment implies that the inhibitory effect of the p85 SH2 domains on enzymatic activity has been released, a phenomenon that might relate to the tyrosine phosphorylation of p85 per seor, alternatively, to interactions of the p85 SH2 domains with tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins captured by anti-phosphotyrosine immunoprecipitation. To distinguish between these possibilities, p85 proteins mutated at the major tyrosine phosphorylation site (Tyr688) were investigated with respect to their effects on PI3K activity. The results of this analysis revealed p85 Y688A protein, which cannot be phosphorylated at Tyr688, to be associated with impaired PI3K activity as manifested by decreases in Akt phosphorylation, BAF/3 cell survival, and NFκB promoter activation. By contrast, these latter activities were all enhanced in cells expressing a mutant p85 protein, Y688D, which is predicted to mimic tyrosine-phosphorylated p85. Taken together, these data provide compelling evidence that PI3K activity is regulated by phosphorylation of p85 at position Tyr688. While the crystal structure of full-length p85 bound to phosphopeptide is not currently available, the predicted protein sequence of the intervening iSH2 domain (p110 binding site between the two SH2 domains) indicates a pair of antiparallel helices and thus predicts that the two SH2 domains are closely aligned (3Wymann M.P. Pirola L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1436: 127-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (579) Google Scholar). These data raise the possibility of an intramolecular association involving binding of the phosphorylated Tyr688 residue within the p85 carboxyl-terminal tail to the p85 amino-terminal SH2 domain. This model, which is illustrated in Fig. 7, is supported by the current data, which reveal the ability of full-length p85 to associate with the phosphorylated, but not nonphosphorylated, Tyr688-containing carboxyl-terminal fragment of p85 and which also suggest that this association is mediated via the p85 amino-terminal SH2 domain (Fig. 6). The data also exclude the possibility that this association depends upon Lck functioning as an intermediary “linker” protein, as the association occurs in the absence of Lck when p85 Y688D is used in the analysis. Together, these data suggest the existence of an intramolecular interaction, between phosphorylated Tyr688 and the amino-terminal SH2 domain of p85 (Fig. 7). Although the amino acid sequence surrounding Tyr688 does not conform to the expected p85 SH2 target sequence (YXXM), this SH2 domain has already been shown to exhibit flexibility in terms of the target motif (21Ponzetto C. Bardelli A. Maina F. Longati P. Panayotou G. Dhand R. Waterfield M.D. Comoglio P.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 4600-4608Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 22He T.C. Zhuang H. Jiang N. Waterfield M.D. Wojchowski D.M. Blood. 1993; 82: 3530-3538Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, an intramolecular association of the nature proposed here may provide a mechanism to prevent binding of the p85 SH2 domains to low affinity substrates. This possibility is supported by previous data revealing p85 association with several phosphorylated proteins to be disrupted upon Tyr688 phosphorylation (8von Willebrand M. Williams S. Saxena M. Gilman J. Tailor P. Jascur T. Amarante-Mendes G.P. Green D.R. Mustelin T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3994-4000Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The current data suggest that this latter observation may reflect competitive inhibition consequent to the formation of an intramolecular association. As with SH2 occupation by other phosphopeptides, this association would serve to “relax” the p85-mediated inhibition of p110 PI3K activity. In addition to this model, the current data might also be explained by another model wherein phosphorylation of Tyr688 triggers an intermolecular interaction between individual p85 proteins, again inducing disruption of the inhibitory activity of p85 (Fig. 7). In this alternative “PI3K concatamer” model, the recruitment of multiple PI3K molecules could represent a mechanism whereby the PI3K signaling cascade is amplified. It is possible that p85 intramolecular interactions also promote PI3K signal amplification by facilitating the removal of phosphorylated PI3K and thus freeing the receptor for subsequent association with a new PI3K. The newly detached, phosphorylated PI3K could then be dephosphorylated by SHP-1 and returned to a basal state, once again available for recruitment to a phosphorylated receptor. Alternatively, an induced intramolecular interaction may represent a mechanism by which PI3K is removed from activated growth factor receptors. Recent studies have shown that an intermolecular interaction also occurs between the p85 SH3 and proline-rich domains (24Harpur A.G. Layton M.J. Das P. Bottomley M.J. Panayotou G. Driscoll P.C. Waterfield M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12323-12332Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), a result which suggests that concatamers of p85 may play a role in forming multimeric interaction complexes. Whichever model proves valid, the capacity of Y688D to mimic the effect of Tyr688 phosphorylation implies that the minimal requirement for this association is phosphorylation at p85 Tyr688. Taken together, the data indicate that phosphorylation of 688 relieves the inhibitory activity of p85 on p110 and suggest that this effect is mediated by the association of phosphorylated tyrosine 688 with the NH2-terminal SH2 domain of p85. Thus intramolecular interactions with phosphorylation sites in p85 have the potential to contribute to the outcome of ligand activation of cells.

We report here a crystal structure of the critical region of Pumilio, the Puf domain, that organizes a multivalent repression complex on the 3' untranslated region of hunchback mRNA. The structure reveals an extended, rainbow shaped molecule, with tandem helical repeats that bear unexpected resemblance to the armadillo repeats in beta-catenin and the HEAT repeats in protein phosphatase 2A.

It is associated with a multistep cascade of events that results in the local recruitment of leukocytes to sites of inflammatory challenge. Selectins and members of the immunoglobulin superfamily of adhesion molecules are up-regulated by proinflammatory factors and sequentially mediate rolling, adhesion, and transmigration of leukocytes from the blood stream to underlying tissues (for review see Refs. 1Springer T.A. Cell. 1994; 76: 301-314Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6414) Google Scholar and 2Ebnet K. Vestweber D. Histochem. Cell Biol. 1999; 112: 1-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). In addition, chemoattractant cytokines (chemokines) produced by and presented on endothelial cells deliver signals that further trigger firm adhesion of rolling blood cells and transmigration, e.g. by modulation of leukocyte integrin activity (3Gerszten R.E. Garcia-Zepeda E.A. Lim Y.C. Yoshida M. Ding H.A. Gimbrone M.A. Luster A.D. Luscinskas F.W. Rosenzweig A. Nature. 1999; 398: 718-723Crossref PubMed Scopus (1070) Google Scholar). The process of endothelial activation underlies tight regulatory control mechanisms. Proinflammatory stimuli targeting the endothelium such as tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α),1 interleukin-1, or bacterial lipopolysaccharides elicit activation of intracellular signal transduction cascades. One of the most important pathways results in the activation of members of the nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB)/Rel family of transcription factors. NF-κB was suggested to be the major transcriptional regulator of endothelial adhesion molecules such as E-selectin, intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), and vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1) as well as of chemokines such as monocyte-chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) or interleukin 8 (IL-8) (4Collins T. Read M.A. Neish A.S. Whitley M.Z. Thanos D. Maniatis T. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 899-909Crossref PubMed Scopus (1577) Google Scholar). Rel family members (p65/RelA, RelB, c-Rel, p50, and p52) form homo- or heterodimeric complexes with each other that constitute the NF-κB complex (5Denk A. Wirth T. Baumann B. Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 2000; 11: 303-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 6Karin M. Ben-Neriah Y. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2000; 18: 621-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (4103) Google Scholar). In resting cells, NF-κB is inactive because of association with inhibitor κB (IκB) proteins that mask the nuclear localization sequence of NF-κB, thereby retaining it in the cytoplasm and preventing DNA binding. Several IκB proteins are involved in the control of NF-κB activity, three of which, IκBα, IκBβ, and IκBε, act in a stimulus-dependent manner. Upon inflammatory activation, IκB is phosphorylated in its N-terminal domain; subsequently it becomes ubiquitinylated and finally degraded by the proteasome. This allows nuclear translocation of NF-κB and binding to cognate DNA motifs in the promoter region of target genes, which subsequently initiates transcription. The critical step in NF-κB activation is the phosphorylation of IκB by a large multisubunit kinase complex consisting of IκB kinases (IKK) 1/α and 2/β as well as an additional essential protein, NF-κB essential modulator (NEMO)/IKKγ (reviewed in Ref. 6Karin M. Ben-Neriah Y. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2000; 18: 621-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (4103) Google Scholar). NEMO represents the regulatory component of the IKK complex, whereas IKK1 and IKK2 act as catalytic subunits. Both IKKs can phosphorylate all three IκB proteins (α, β, and ε) to a similar extent. In endothelial cells all three IκBs are degraded upon stimulation with TNF-α but with slightly different kinetics (7Johnson D.R. Douglas I. Jahnke A. Ghosh S. Pober J.S. J. Biol.

However, the relative contribution of the different IκB isoforms to cytokine-induced endothelial gene expression has not been studied in detail. Furthermore, although several studies reported a role for IKK2 in TNF-α-induced endothelial NF-κB activation (8Heilker R. Freuler F. Vanek M. Pulfer R. Kobel T. Peter J. Zerwes H.G. Hofstetter H.

We then studied TNF-α-induced expression of adhesion molecules (ICAM-1, VCAM-1, E-selectin) and chemokines (MCP-1, IL-8) in the infected cells. Whereas dominant negative IKK2 and transdominant IκBα, -β, and -ε mutants completely inhibited expression of these molecules, dominant negative IKK1 blocked induction to a variable extent. Importantly, a constitutively active version of IKK2 was sufficient to yield maximal induction of the various target genes, demonstrating that NF-κB is not only essential but also sufficient for expression of activation markers on endothelial cells. Our data thus show that the IKK/IκB/NF-κB signal transduction cascade is the dominant control mechanism for inflammatory activation of endothelial cells. Primary human endothelial cells derived from umbilical veins were obtained from Clonetics (via Cell Systems, St. Katharinen, Germany). They were cultured in endothelial basal medium (Clonetics) supplemented with 2% fetal bovine serum, 1.0 µg/ml hydrocortisone, 10 ng/ml human epidermal growth factor, 12 µg/ml bovine brain extract, 50 µg/ml gentamicin, and 50 ng/ml amphotericin B, which together constituted EGM. Experiments were performed with cells of passage 3. The φNX amphotropic retrovirus producer cells (a gift from G. Nolan, Stanford, CA) (15Nolan G.P. Shatzman A.R. Curr. Opin. Biotechnol. 1998; 9: 447-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) containing 10% fetal calf serum (PAN Systems, Aidenbach, Germany), 100 units/ml penicillin (Life Technologies, Inc.), and 100 µg/ml streptomycin (Life Technologies, Inc.). Cells were stimulated with human recombinant TNF-α (R&D Systems, Wiesbaden, Germany) or human recombinant IFN-γ (Peprotech, London, UK) as indicated. The pCFG5-IEGZ retroviral vector used for infection has been described earlier (16Kuss A.W. Knodel M. Berberich-Siebelt F. Lindemann D. Schimpl A. Berberich I. Eur. J. Immunol. 1999; 29: 3077-3088Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). All cDNAs were inserted into bluntedEcoRI/BamHI sites. Mutant IκBα was provided by Patrick Baeuerle (Micromed, Munich, Germany), and the mutant IκBβ and IκBε as well as the mutant IKK1 and IKK2 cDNAs were provided by Alain Israel (Institut Pasteur, Paris, France). Sequences of retroviral vectors were confirmed by DNA sequencing. φNX producer cells plated at a density of 1 × 106per 10-cm plate were transfected using the calcium phosphate precipitation method with 10 µg of plasmid DNA as described (17Grignani F. Kinsella T. Mencarelli A. Valtieri M. Riganelli D. Lanfrancone L. Peschle C. Nolan G.P. Pelicci P.G. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 14-19PubMed Google Scholar). Twenty-four h later, transfection efficiencies were determined by monitoring GFP expression by fluorescence microscopy (Improvision, Heidelberg, Germany) or flow cytometry with a FACScalibur (Becton Dickinson, Heidelberg, Germany). Transfection efficiencies usually ranged between 70 and 80%. Twenty-four h after transfection, 1 mg/ml zeocin (Invitrogen, Groningen, The Netherlands) was added to the cells, which were then grown in the presence of this agent for another 2 weeks until all the cells were positive for GFP. Four days before infection, endothelial cells were seeded in 6-well plates at a density of 5 × 104 cells/well in EGM medium. Twenty-four h before infection, the culture medium of the producer cells was changed from Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium to EGM. At the day of infection, φNX cell supernatant was obtained, filtered through a 0.45-µm filter, and 5 µg/ml polybrene (Sigma) was added to the filtrate. Thereafter, EGM was removed from endothelial cell cultures and replaced by the φNX cell supernatant containing the retrovirus. Culture plates were centrifuged at 1000 × g for 3 h, and the supernatants were then removed and replaced by conventional EGM. The infection procedure was repeated 1 day later to increase the efficiency of infection, which was finally monitored by fluorescence microscopy or flow cytometry as described above. Infection efficiencies of endothelial cells ranged between 10 and 70%, depending on the retrovirus used. Preparation of whole cell extracts was performed as described earlier (18Lernbecher T. Muller U. Wirth T. Nature. 1993; 365: 767-770Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). For Western blot analysis, 50 µg of protein extracts per lane were separated on 12.5% polyacrylamide gels and transferred onto polyvinyldifluoride membranes (Millipore, Bedford, MA). Membranes were blocked with 7.5% dry milk in PBS containing 0.2% Tween 20. For subsequent washes, 0.2% Tween 20 in PBS was used. Membranes were labeled with affinity-purified rabbit antisera against IκBα or JNK (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) or phospho-JNK (New England Biolabs). Thereafter, membranes were stained with horseradish peroxidase-coupled secondary donkey anti-rabbit IgG antibody (Dianova, Hamburg, Germany), which was visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). EMSAs were performed essentially as described before (18Lernbecher T. Muller U. Wirth T. Nature. 1993; 365: 767-770Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). The chemokines MCP-1 and IL-8 were detected by an intracellular flow cytometry staining procedure as described before (13Goebeler M. Gillitzer R. Kilian K. Utzel K. Brocker E.B. Rapp U.R. Ludwig S. Blood. 2001; 97: 46-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Endothelial cells were stimulated with cytokine (or medium as control) for the time intervals indicated in the presence of 2 µm monensin to avoid secretion via the Golgi pathway. Cells were subsequently harvested, washed, and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde at 4 °C for 20 min. Endothelial cells were subsequently incubated with mouse monoclonal antibodies against MCP-1, IL-8, or isotype control antibodies (all obtained from Becton Dickinson), which had been diluted in permeabilization buffer (0.1% saponin/1% fetal calf serum/PBS). Thereafter, cells were successively stained with biotin-Sp-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Dianova) and streptavidin-Cy-chrome (Becton Dickinson), and fluorescence of induced proteins was determined in the FL3 channel using a FACScalibur (Becton Dickinson). For the analysis of adhesion molecule expression on the cell surface, endothelial cells were stimulated with cytokines as indicated, incubated with 1% bovine serum albumin in PBS to block nonspecific binding, and immunostained with mouse monoclonal antibodies against E-selectin, VCAM-1 (both obtained from Dianova), or ICAM-1 (Immunotech, Marseille, France) diluted in 1% bovine serum albumin/2% normal goat serum/PBS. Thereafter, cells were successively stained with biotin-SP-conjugated goat-anti-mouse IgG (Dianova) and streptavidin-Cy-chrome (Becton Dickinson). Adhesion molecule expression of the GFP+ population as detected in the FL3 channel was determined with a FACScalibur. Nonviable cells were excluded from analysis by means of forward scatter and side scatter light parameters. Quantification of expression levels determined in the fluorescence-activated cell sorting was done by determining the geo mean in the CellQuest Software, which represents the mean value of the area covered by the curve. All flow cytometry experiments were repeated at least twice and revealed essentially similar results. To study the contribution of the IKK/NF-κB signaling module to endothelial gene expression after inflammatory activation, we used retroviral gene transfer to express dominant interfering mutants of this pathway. Negative modulation of NF-κB signaling was achieved by using transdominant mutants of different IκB proteins as well as kinase-inactive mutants of IKK1 and IKK2. For selective activation of the IKK/NF-κB module, we used an active mutant of IKK2 to investigate whether constitutive NF-κB activity is sufficient to drive expression of the examined target genes. Genes for the interfering mutants were transduced by a retroviral infection approach (Fig.1a), which results in DNA integration and stable chromatin-embedded expression of the mutant proteins. The long terminal repeat-mediated expression of the inserted gene is coupled to the expression of a GFP-zeocin resistance fusion gene through an internal ribosome entry site (16Kuss A.W. Knodel M. Berberich-Siebelt F. Lindemann D. Schimpl A. Berberich I. Eur. J. Immunol. 1999; 29: 3077-3088Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). This allowed us to distinguish between infected and noninfected cells by flow cytometric analysis of GFP expression. The percentage of GFP-expressing cells was used as an indicator for transduction efficiencies. Furthermore, this method permitted us to compare equally treated uninfected and infected cells in the same dish regarding the effects of mutant proteins on expression of endothelial adhesion molecules and chemokines. To analyze whether the transdominant IκB mutants are functional in inhibiting NF-κB activation, human umbilical vein endothelial cells were infected with different retroviruses and stimulated with TNF-α for various time intervals. Subsequently, the expression of endogenous (wild-type) and mutant IκB proteins was studied by Western blot analysis. Endogenous IκBα was degraded within 5 min of TNF-α exposure, and the protein completely disappeared after 30 min (Fig. 1 b). In contrast, the mutant protein remained stable over the whole observation period (Fig.1 c). Endothelial cells transduced with the empty vector showed maximal NF-κB DNA-binding activity after 5 min and remained at this level over the period investigated (Fig. 1 b). Supershift analysis revealed that these DNA-binding complexes predominantly consisted of p50/RelA heterodimers (data not shown). Endothelial cells expressing transdominant IκBα displayed almost no NF-κB DNA-binding activity in response to TNF-α (Fig.1 c). The weak residual activity is most likely contributed by the uninfected cells. The same results were obtained when transdominant IκBβ and IκBε mutants were studied (data not shown). Thus, the expression of transdominant IκB proteins results in an efficient inhibition of induced NF-κB activation in human primary endothelial cells. To examine the effect of mutant IκB protein expression on proinflammatory induction of endothelial proteins, endothelial cells were infected with retroviruses expressing transdominant IκBα or the parental vector as a control. Cells were then exposed to TNF-α, and expression of chemokines and adhesion molecules were analyzed by flow cytometry using specific antibodies. In the representative experiment depicted in Fig.2, about 70% of the cells expressed GFP, indicating successful transduction of the transgenes. GFP+and GFP− populations of the same sample were analyzed for TNF-α-induced adhesion molecule (Fig. 2, VCAM-1) and chemokine expression (see below). Cells transduced with the empty vector showed a strong up-regulation of VCAM-1 in both the GFP+ and GFP− populations. A comparable induction of VCAM-1 was detected in the GFP− population of endothelial cells that had been treated with the transdominant IκBα virus (Fig. 2). However, there is also a population that does not efficiently up-regulate VCAM-1 in response to TNF-α. These are most likely cells that had been infected with the virus but show only low GFP levels and therefore fall in the lower gate. In contrast, VCAM-1 was not inducible in GFP+ cells, i.e. in the successfully infected subpopulations expressing the transdominant IκBα protein. Isotype controls have been performed for this and all the following experiments and showed that the observed effects were specific for the mutants used. For the sake of clarity, these isotype controls have been omitted from the figures. Similar experiments were performed regarding TNF-α-induced up-regulation of the adhesion molecules ICAM-1 and E-selectin and chemokines MCP-1 and IL-8. Expression of transdominant IκBα virtually completely abolished inducibility of these molecules by TNF-α (Fig. 3a). Furthermore, transdominant mutants of IκBβ and IκBε were capable of inhibiting induction of these adhesion molecules and chemokines as well (Fig. 3 a). Our data indicate that activation of NF-κB is essential for the expression of all these proteins investigated. Moreover, all three IκB mutant proteins act as equally competent inhibitors of adhesion molecule and chemokine expression in endothelial cells (Fig. 3 a), indicating that each of the IκBs may critically contribute to the regulation of NF-κB-mediated proinflammatory activation of endothelium.Figure 3Transdominant IκB proteins block expression of TNF-α- but not of IFN-γ-inducible target genes in the endothelium. Endothelial cells were infected with retroviruses carrying transdominant mutants of IκBα, IκBβ, or IκBε or an empty control vector as indicated. Twenty-four h after infection, cells were stimulated with 2 ng/ml TNF-α for 6 h (E-selectin) or 16 h (MCP-1, IL-8, ICAM-1, and VCAM-1) (a), or 25 ng/ml IFN-γ for 24 h (b). Endothelial cells were then processed for flow cytometry, and the intracellular expression of chemokines and surface expression of adhesion molecules were determined as described under “Experimental Procedures.” For the sake of clarity, only profiles of the GFP+ populations are depicted. The expression of chemokines or adhesion molecules is shown after stimulation with (a) TNF-α or (b) IFN-γ (green lines) or medium as control (black lines) as indicated.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To prove specificity of transdominant IκB-mediated inhibition of endothelial gene expression for the NF-κB pathway, infected endothelial cells were also stimulated with IFN-γ, a known inducer of ICAM-1 expression in endothelial cells. IFN-γ employs the Janus kinase/signal transducer and activator of transcription rather than the NF-κB signalosome. None of the mutant IκBs was capable of inhibiting IFN-γ-induced expression of ICAM-1 (Fig. 3 b). In addition, IFN-γ-induced up-regulation of endothelial HLA-DR was not blocked by transdominant IκB mutants either (data not shown). These observations clearly demonstrate that there is no general signaling defect in the stably transduced cells. Retrovirally infected endothelial cells expressing mutant IκB proteins rather show a selective blockade of the NF-κB signaling cascade. Promoter regions of many proinflammatory cytokine-inducible genes carry binding motifs not only for NF-κB but also for transcription factors of the activator protein-1 (AP-1) family. The activity of several AP-1 factors such as c-Jun, ATF-2, and JunD is regulated via phosphorylation by JNKs. Similar to NF-κB, JNK is activated by TNF-α/TNF receptor signaling, which activates the upstream kinase SEK, which then in turn phosphorylates JNK. To investigate the extent of SEK/JNK/AP-1 involvement in the regulation of endothelial adhesion molecules and chemokines, endothelial cells were retrovirally transduced with a kinase-deficient mutant of SEK. To prove the functionality of the mutant, we first monitored the phosphorylation of JNK in response to TNF-α treatment in the stably transfected producer cell line. In cells stably transfected with the parental vector, JNK was phosphorylated after 10 min of TNF-α treatment. In contrast, cells expressing the SEK mutant did not show measurable JNK phosphorylation in response to TNF-α (Fig.4a). Endothelial cells expressing the kinase-deficient SEK mutant were exposed to TNF-α, and the expression of MCP-1, IL-8, ICAM-1, VCAM-1, and E-selectin was analyzed. In all cases we could still see significant up-regulation of the activation markers (Fig. 4 b). However, we consistently saw a weak attenuation of the up-regulation of E-selectin and VCAM-1. For the other target molecules we could not reproducibly see such a down-regulation. However, in no instance could we observe a complete inhibition of chemokine/adhesion molecule expression as we saw for the NF-κB inhibitors. These data indicate that JNK and AP-1 only play a minor role with respect to the control of endothelial chemokine and adhesion molecule expression. IKK1 and IKK2, kinases present in the IκB kinase complex, are both capable of phosphorylating IκB proteins in response to extracellular stimulation. Thus far, the relative contribution of these to TNF-α-induced endothelial gene expression remained elusive. To address this aspect, endothelial cells were retrovirally transduced with kinase-inactive mutants of IKK1 or IKK2 and subsequently analyzed for TNF-α-mediated chemokine and adhesion molecule expression as described above. Kinase-inactive IKK2 virtually completely inhibited TNF-α-induced expression of all these endothelial molecules (Fig.5a). In contrast, kinase-inactive IKK1 showed a more selective effect; although the induction of IL-8 and VCAM-1 was blocked by both mutant kinases to an almost similar extent, dominant negative IKK1 only partially inhibited the synthesis of MCP-1, ICAM-1, and E-selectin (see “Discussion”). Paralleling the results obtained with the transdominant IκB proteins, kinase-deficient IKK1 and IKK2 mutants did not interfere with IFN-γ-induced ICAM-1 expression (data not shown). These data indicate that the kinase activity of IKK2 is absolutely required for induction of all the proteins investigated, whereas IKK1 seems essential for only a subset of endothelial NF-κB target genes. Because IKK2 obviously plays an important role in regulating endothelial gene expression, we next addressed the question of whether constitutively active IKK2 by itself is sufficient to induce the expression of target genes. Expression of an active IKK2 mutant, which is characterized by the replacement of two serines of the activation loop by glutamic acid (19Mercurio F. Zhu H. Murray B.W. Shevchenko A. Bennett B.L. Li J. Young D.B. Barbosa M. Mann M. Manning A. Rao A. Science. 1997; 278: 860-866Crossref PubMed Scopus (1855) Google Scholar, 20Delhase M. Hayakawa M. Chen Y. Karin M. Science. 1999; 284: 309-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (754) Google Scholar), in the producer cell line φNX resulted in a strong constitutive DNA binding of NF-κB (Fig.6a). Although infection efficiencies of endothelial cells infected with a retrovirus containing active IKK2 only reached ∼10%, the transduced subset within the pool of cells analyzed by EMSA still gave rise to a measurable increase in NF-κB DNA-binding activity in the absence of TNF-α (Fig.6 a). Endothelial cells expressing constitutively active IKK2 showed a pronounced up-regulation of ICAM-1, VCAM-1, E-selectin, MCP-1, and IL-8 already in the absence of a proinflammatory stimulus (Fig.6 b). The protein levels induced were even higher than those observed upon exposure to TNF-α. The active IKK mutant acts specifically on NF-κB, because endothelial HLA-DR expression, which does not depend on NF-κB activity, was not affected (data not shown). These observations indicate that the IKK mutant is not a general activator of endothelial cells but selectively targets genes that are NF-κB-dependent. Interestingly, when cells expressing the active IKK mutant were additionally exposed to TNF-α, protein synthesis of the above-mentioned read-out molecules was not further enhanced but down-regulated to the level of TNF-α-stimulated empty vector-infected control cells. Taken together, our data indicate that expression of a constitutively active IKK2 mutant widely mimics the proinflammatory activation of endothelial cells, because it is sufficient to drive full expression of endothelial chemokines and adhesion molecules. The activation of endothelium is a critical step in the onset of inflammatory responses and is associated with the up-regulation of a variety of chemokines and adhesion molecules. Here we have analyzed the contribution of the IKK/IκB/NF-κB signaling pathway to endothelial protein expression upon inflammatory stimulation. We used a retroviral transduction approach that allowed the expression of dominant interfering mutants of components of the NF-κB signaling pathway. The consequences of this modulation of NF-κB activity on the expression of endogenous genes in endothelial cells was analyzed. With this approach we were able to demonstrate that the inhibition of NF-κB signaling by expression of transdominant mutants of IκBα, -β, and -ε or a kinase-deficient form of IKK2 results in a complete blockade of TNF-α-induced expression of the chemokines MCP-1 and IL-8 and adhesion molecules ICAM-1, VCAM-1, and E-selectin. In contrast, a constitutively active version of IKK2 by itself was sufficient to induce maximal expression of these genes. A dominant-negative SEK mutant that interfered with the activation of the AP-1 transcription factor had only marginal effects on some of the investigated molecules. Each isoform of the IκB proteins inhibited the expression of endothelial activation markers to a similar extent. The main dimer induced upon TNF-α treatment of endothelial cells is the p50/RelA heterodimer (Refs. 21Hooft van Huijsduijnen R. Pescini R. DeLamarter J.F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 3711-3717Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 22Lakshminarayanan V. Drab-Weiss E.A. Roebuck K.A. J. Biol.

Physiol. 2000; 279: L302-L311Crossref PubMed Google Scholar and data not shown), for which it was reported before that it can be efficiently inhibited by IκBα and IκBβ (24Duckett C.S. Perkins N.D.

Cell. 1995; 80: 573-582Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (694) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the publications describing the inhibition profile of IκBε were somehow contradictory with respect to the inhibition of p50/RelA-containing complexes, and it has been suggested that IκBε may play a special role in regulating c-Rel-containing complexes (9Spiecker M. Darius H. Liao J.K. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 3316-3322Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 26Simeonidis S. Liang S. Chen G. Thanos D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 14372-14377Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 27Li Z. Nabel G.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6184-6190Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 28Whiteside S.T. Epinat J.C. Rice N.R. Israel A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1413-1426Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). On the basis of inhibition of c-Rel-containing complexes, a selective role for IκBε in ICAM-1 regulation was proposed (9Spiecker M. Darius H. Liao J.K. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 3316-3322Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Here we could show that IκBε was able to inhibit TNF-α-induced gene expression as effectively as IκBα and IκBβ, and in other experiments we could demonstrate that IκBε indeed inhibits p50/RelA-activated transcription (data not shown). From our results we conclude that the expression of ICAM-1 is not exclusively regulated by NF-κB complexes bound to IκBε but also by complexes controlled by IκBα and IκBβ. Our results demonstrate that the activation of NF-κB is essential for the expression of various target genes in endothelial cells. Furthermore, they show that the signal transduction cascade critically involves the IκB-kinase complex, most notably the IKK2 kinase. During the preparation of this paper, Oitzinger et al.(14) described the effect of a dominant negative IKK2 mutant on inflammatory marker genes. Consistent with our results, they found that adenoviral expression of dominant negative IKK2 completely inhibits the activation of endothelial cells in response to proinflammatory cytokines. Although IKK2 seems to play a very prominent role in NF-κB activation and gene expression in endothelial cells, the contribution of IKK1 is less pronounced and differs for the target molecules analyzed. Nevertheless, this observation is intriguing because it had been suggested earlier from gene disruption studies and transient transfections that IKK1 is not required for cytokine-induced NF-κB activation at all (20Delhase M. Hayakawa M. Chen Y. Karin M. Science. 1999; 284: 309-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (754) Google Scholar, 29Hu Y. Baud V. Delhase M. Zhang P. Deerinck T. Ellisman M. Johnson R. Karin M. Science. 1999; 284: 316-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (713) Google Scholar, 30Takeda K. Takeuchi O. Tsujimura T. Itami S. Adachi O. Kawai T. Sanjo H. Yoshikawa K. Terada N. Akira S. Science. 1999; 284: 313-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar). Our data show that at least in endothelial cells IKK1 contributes to the TNF-α-induced expression of some NF-κB target genes. This might be because of the fact that IKK1 is able to phosphorylate and thereby activate IKK2 both in unstimulated and in TNF-α-stimulated cells (31O'Mahony A. Lin X. Geleziunas R. Greene W.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1170-1178Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 32Yamamoto Y. Yin M.J. Gaynor R.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 3655-3666Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). A strong overexpression of kinase-deficient IKK1 might therefore titrate the endogenous wild-type IKK1 away from the IκB-kinase complex and thereby inhibit this phosphorylation. The difference among the various NF-κB target genes might be caused by different dependencies of these molecules on IKK1 kinase activity. An important outcome of our experiments was the finding that the activation of NF-κB alone (by means of the constitutively active IKK2) was sufficient for full induction of endothelial effector proteins in the absence of additional proinflammatory stimuli. Thus, the activation of NF-κB via IKK2 is both essential and sufficient for endothelial chemokine and adhesion molecule expression. Interestingly, expression of the various target genes was even higher in cells expressing the constitutively active IKK2 protein as compared with TNF-α-induced cells. When cells expressing constitutively active IKK2 were further stimulated with TNF-α, the expression of chemokines and adhesion molecules was attenuated. A potential explanation for this observation is that TNF-α induces some modulators of the transcriptional activity of NF-κB in addition to stimulating NF-κB activity. One candidate for such a modulator is A20, an antiapoptotic protein that is induced by TNF-α, the expression of which depends on NF-κB (33Krikos A. Laherty C.D. Dixit V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17971-17976Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 34Laherty C.D. Perkins N.D. Dixit V.M. J. Biol.

Furthermore, it was shown that A20 can inhibit NF-κB and thereby also endothelial activation (36Cooper J.T. Stroka D.M. Brostjan C. Palmetshofer A. Bach F.H. Ferran C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18068-18073Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar, 37Ferran C. Stroka D.M. Badrichani A.Z. Cooper J.T. Wrighton C.J. Soares M. Grey S.T. Bach F.H. Blood. 1998; 91: 2249-2258Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The exact mechanism of A20 function is not clear yet. Recently it was shown that A20 interacts with the IKK complex upon TNF receptor stimulation (38Zhang S.Q. Kovalenko A. Cantarella G. Wallach D. Immunity. 2000; 12: 301-311Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). Thereby it could act directly on the IκB kinases. In addition to A20, other antiapoptotic proteins like A1, Bcl-2, and Bcl-XLhave been described as inhibitors of NF-κB and endothelial activation (39Stroka D.M. Badrichani A.Z. Bach F.H. Ferran C. Blood. 1999; 93: 3803-3810Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 40Badrichani A.Z. Stroka D.M. Bilbao G. Curiel D.T. Bach F.H. Ferran C. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 103: 543-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). TNF-α, by stimulating pathways in addition to NF-κB, may increase the expression level of these proteins and thereby attenuate the NF-κB response. Such a desensitizing signal may help to protect the cell from a signaling overflow and may be part of a switch-off mechanism once the positive signal has fulfilled its task. Another possibility for down-regulation of target gene expression by TNF-α could be that TNF-α induces other transcription factors in addition to NF-κB that titrate away cofactors that are necessary for NF-κB transcriptional activation. Such a competitive interaction was shown recently for NF-κB and Smad proteins activated by transforming growth factor-β. When endothelial cells were treated with transforming growth factor-β or transfected with Smad expression vectors in addition to interleukin-1β stimulation, E-selectin gene expression was inhibited, because the coactivator CREB-binding protein was titrated away from the NF-κB dimers (41DiChiara M.R. Kiely J.M. Gimbrone M.A. Lee M.E. Perrella M.A. Topper J.N. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 192: 695-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). A similar mechanism could also be initiated by TNF-α in a situation where NF-κB activation is already maximal. It was reported earlier that signal transduction cascades apart from the NF-κB pathway such as the JNK/stress-activated protein kinase mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway initiated by TNF-α are important for the induction of endothelial genes, e.g. for the expression of E-selectin (42Min W. Pober J.S. J. Immunol. 1997; 159: 3508-3518PubMed Google Scholar, 43Read M.A. Whitley M.Z. Gupta S. Pierce J.W. Best J. Davis R.J. Collins T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2753-2761Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). By expressing a dominant negative mutant of SEK, the upstream activator of JNK, we observed only marginal changes in induced expression of E-selectin and VCAM-1 and no reproducible effects on ICAM-1, MCP-1, or IL-8, although the kinase-deficient mutant efficiently blocked TNF-α-induced JNK activation. Thus, the JNK pathway seems to play a modulating rather than an essential role in regulating endothelial gene expression upon inflammatory activation."

A null allele of the PGS1 gene from Saccharomyces cerevisiae, which encodes the enzyme responsible for the synthesis of the CL precursor PG phosphate, was created in a yeast strain in which PGS1 expression is exogenously regulated by doxycycline. The addition of increasing concentrations of doxycycline to the growth medium causes a proportional decrease to undetectable levels of PGS1 transcript, PG phosphate synthase activity, and PG plus CL. The doubling time of this strain with increasing doxycycline increases to senescence in non-fermentable carbon sources or at high temperatures, conditions that do not support growth of thepgs1Δ strain. Doxycycline addition also causes mitochondrial abnormalities as observed by fluorescence microscopy. Products of four mitochondrial encoded genes (COX1,COX2, COX3, and COB) and one nuclear encoded gene (COX4) associated with the mitochondrial inner membrane are not present when PGS1expression is fully repressed. No translation of these proteins can be detected in cells lacking the PGS1 gene product, although transcription and splicing appear unaffected. Protein import of other nuclear encoded proteins remains unaffected. The remaining proteins encoded by mitochondrial DNA are expressed and translated normally. Thus, the molecular basis for the lack of mitochondrial function inpgs1Δ cells is the failure to translate gene products essential to the electron transport chain.

Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 315-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). Due to their intracellular distribution, these anionic phospholipids have been postulated to be an essential component in many mitochondrial processes such as electron transport, ion permeability, membrane integrity, protein import, and solute transport (2Bobyleva V. Bellei M. Pazienza T.L. Muscatello U. Biochem. Mol. Biol. Int. 1997; 41: 469-480PubMed Google Scholar, 3Hoch F.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1113: 71-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (539) Google Scholar). Mitochondria house the primary oxygen utilization centers of cells and are therefore the major source of oxidative damage to tissue. Reduction of CL levels is correlated with a compromise in terminal oxidation and an increase in oxidative damage to tissue through the accumulation of highly reactive intermediates generated by the electron transport chain (ETC) (4Paradies G. Petrosillo G. Pistolese M. Ruggiero F.M. FEBS Lett. 2000; 466: 323-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar, 5Schapira A.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1410: 159-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). Oxidative damage to CL appears to be a major factor in aging (6Paradies G. Petrosillo G. Gadaleta M.N. Ruggiero F.M. FEBS Lett. 1999; 454: 207-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 7Shigenaga M.K. Hagen T.M. Ames B.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 10771-10778Crossref PubMed Scopus (1807) Google Scholar). Because of the high level of unsaturation of its fatty acyl groups, CL is the primary and specific target of lipid peroxidation during ischemia and reperfusion (8Ma B.J. Taylor W.A. Dolinsky V.W. Hatch G.M. J. Lipid Res. 1999; 40: 1837-1845Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Paradies G. Petrosillo G. Pistolese M. Di Venosa N. Serena D. Ruggiero F.M. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1999; 27: 42-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Alterations in mitochondrial functions reliant on CL also are associated with Alzheimer's and several other neurodegenerative diseases (7Shigenaga M.K. Hagen T.M. Ames B.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 10771-10778Crossref PubMed Scopus (1807) Google Scholar, 10Bonilla E. Tanji K. Hirano M. Vu T.H. DiMauro S. Schon E.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1410: 171-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). One of the most important mitochondrial processes with which anionic phospholipids are thought to participate is protein import (11Ou W.J. Ito A. Umeda M. Inoue K. Omura T. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1988; 103: 589-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). This function is inhibited by adriamycin, an antibiotic that specifically binds anionic phospholipids (12Eilers M. Endo T. Schatz G. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 2945-2950Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The 25 amino acid presequence of cytochrome c oxidase (Cox) subunit IV (Cox4p), widely utilized as a model peptide for mitochondrial targeting sequences, is both stabilized and properly oriented by CL (13Chupin V. Leenhouts J.M. de Kroon A.I. de Kruijff B. FEBS Lett. 1995; 373: 239-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Another unique property of CL is its ability to adopt non-bilayer structures in the presence of divalent cations such as calcium (14van Klompenburg W. Nilsson I. von Heijne G. de Kruijff B. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4261-4266Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 15Rand R.P. Sengupta S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1972; 255: 484-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar) which is a known regulator of mitochondrial function. These structures are believed necessary for protein import (16Ortiz A. Killian J.A. Verkleij A.J. Wilschut J. Biophys. J. 1999; 77: 2003-2014Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 17Leenhouts J.M. de Gier J. de Kruijff B. FEBS Lett. 1993; 327: 172-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Anionic phospholipids have also been shown to provide the membrane organization sites inEscherichia coli for complexes composed of both integral and peripheral membrane proteins that are responsible for initiation of DNA replication (18Xia W. Dowhan W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 783-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar) and protein translocation across membranes (19Lill R. Dowhan W. Wickner W. Cell. 1990; 60: 271-280Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar). A widely studied phospholipid/protein interaction is that of CL with Cox (20Sedlak E. Robinson N.C. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 14966-14972Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Many studies have demonstrated the necessity of CL for thein vitro function of this enzyme complex (21Abramovitch D.A. Marsh D. Powell G.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1020: 34-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Adriamycin inhibits its function (22Goormaghtigh E. Brasseur R. Ruysschaert J.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1982; 104: 314-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar), and decreased CL levels are associated with a decline in the function of this enzyme in aged cells (23Paradies G. Ruggiero F.M. Petrosillo G. Quagliariello E. FEBS Lett. 1998; 424: 155-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). In yeast, CL synthase activity is proportional to Cox activity at different stages of the cell cycle (24Greksak M. Nejedly K. Zborowski J. Folia Microbiol. 1977; 22: 30-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar), and Cox activity has been shown to be diminished in mutants (crd1Δ) lacking CL synthase (25Jiang F. Ryan M.T. Schlame M. Zhao M. Gu Z. Klingenberg M. Pfanner N. Greenberg M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 22387-22394Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). Only a few reports appear to demonstrate a requirement for CL in vivo at the molecular level for any of the above processes. The most direct evidence for the essential role of PG and CL in mammalian cells comes from Chinese hamster ovary cells with a mutation (26Kawasaki K. Kuge O. Chang S.C. Heacock P.N. Rho M. Suzuki K. Nishijima M. Dowhan W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1828-1834Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) in the gene encoding the PG phosphate synthase (PGPS). The enzyme catalyzes the committed step of CL biosynthesis, and the strain, therefore, has reduced levels of both PG and CL (27Ohtsuka T. Nishijima M. Suzuki K. Akamatsu Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22914-22919Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28Ohtsuka T. Nishijima M. Akamatsu Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22908-22913Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These mutants have defects in electron transport and ATP production, show reduced oxygen utilization, possess gross alterations in mitochondrial morphology, are temperature-sensitive at 37 °C, and eventually lose viability even when grown with glucose. A yeast model system based on a null mutant of CL synthase has also been studied (25Jiang F. Ryan M.T. Schlame M. Zhao M. Gu Z. Klingenberg M. Pfanner N. Greenberg M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 22387-22394Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). However, the phenotypic changes brought about by this mutation are not dramatic (29Jiang F. Rizavi H.S. Greenberg M.L. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 26: 481-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 30Koshkin V. Greenberg M.L. Biochem. J. 2000; 347: 687-691Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 31Chang S.C. Heacock P.N. Mileykovskaya E. Voelker D.R. Dowhan W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14933-14941Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar) suggesting the major roles of CL are substituted by an increase in PG. More severe mitochondrial dysfunction occurs when PG levels are also reduced by growth of this mutant on glucose rather than a non-fermentable carbon source. However, any conclusions drawn from these experiments are compromised by the extreme effects changes in carbon source have on growth characteristics of cells in general and mitochondrial development and function in particular. In the present study, all mitochondrial PG and CL were depleted by disruption of PGS1, which encodes PGPS (32Chang S.C. Heacock P.N. Clancey C.J. Dowhan W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9829-9836Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Null mutants inPGS1 are temperature-sensitive, cannot grow on non-fermentable carbon sources, and are petite lethal (32Chang S.C. Heacock P.N. Clancey C.J. Dowhan W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9829-9836Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 33Dzugasova V. Obernauerova M. Horvathova K. Vachova M. Zakova M. Subik J. Curr.

A regulatable PGS1 gene was introduced on a plasmid into thepgs1Δ strain in order to study the effects of attenuating anionic phospholipids without the need to alter growth conditions or compare different strains. The resulting strain was used to determine the molecular basis for dysfunction of mitochondria lacking these phospholipids. The wild type yeast strain utilized in this study is YPH499 (ade2-101,his3Δ200, leu2Δ1,lys2-801, trp1Δ63, ura3-52, MAT a) (35Sikorski R.S. Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Disruption ofPGS1 was accomplished by homologous recombination with a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) product of TRP1 carried on plasmid pRS304 (35Sikorski R.S. Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) by amplification with primers 5′-GCAGCCCACACAAGAAAGTAGATATAATGTAGGACACCCAGCTTGTCCATAATTGCTAATAGCATACTCAGGATAggtattttctccttacgcatctgtg-3′ and 5′-GCTCTTCATCTCTTGTAATAATGAGAGCATTCGATTCAAATCTAATGAATACGCCCTTCTCGTATAGTTTGAAGagagtgcaccaaacgacattactat-3′. (Capital letters refer to regions of PGS1 homology (promoter for the first primer and terminator for the second), and lowercase letters refer to regions of TRP1 homology.) The resulting PCR product contained the TRP1 gene flanked by DNA homologous to regions 5′ and 3′ to PGS1. PGS1 null strains were selected on tryptophan dropout minimal media glucose plates (36Sherman F. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 3-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (2526) Google Scholar);pgs1Δ strains were identified by PCR analysis of isolated genomic DNA as described below. Many of the experiments were duplicated in strain YCD4 (his3-11, 15, leu2-3, 112, pgs1Δ::HIS3, ura3-251, 328, 372, MAT a), another pgs1Δstrain, (32Chang S.C. Heacock P.N. Clancey C.J. Dowhan W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9829-9836Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar) together with its PGS1 wild type parent, DL1, completely unrelated to YPH499, as described under “Results.” Because of problems associated with the recovery of pgs1Δcells from stationary phase and the high mortality resulting from freezing, only mid-log phase cells were used for frozen stocks, and fresh culture plates were prepared every 2–3 weeks. Because fluorescence microscopy is difficult in an ade2strain due to the build up of a red pigment, ADE2 revertants were created in both the wild type parental and pgs1Δstrains. The gene was amplified from plasmid pRS402 (35Sikorski R.S. Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) with primers 5′-TTTTCTTAAAAGAATCAAAGACAGATAAAA-3′ and 5′-CACACCGCATAGATCTTATGTATGAAATTC-3′, and this product was used to transform the strains to white colonies on adenine dropout media. The ADE2 derivatives of YPH499 and its pgs1Δderivative were named SDO224 (referred to as the “wild type” strain) and SDO225 (referred to as the “psg1Δ ” strain), respectively. These were the strains used in this study. ρ0 derivatives of the wild type strain were created with ethidium bromide as described previously (37Ostrander D.B. Gorman J.A. Carman G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27045-27050Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) as a control of the inability to create ρ0 derivatives of thepsg1Δ strain. The doxycycline-regulated plasmid, pDO292 (CEN4,ARS1, URA3, CMVp/TetR DNA Binding Domain/VP16 Activation Domain, TetO/CYC1p/PGS1/CYC1t), was constructed as follows. Cloning of PGS1 was accomplished by PCR amplification from genomic DNA isolated (38Hoffman C.S. Winston F. Gene (Amst.). 1987; 57: 72-267Crossref Scopus (2021) Google Scholar) from strain DL1 (39Van Loon A.P. Van Eijk E. Grivell L.A. EMBO J. 1983; 2: 1765-1770Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) with primers 5′-ataggatccATGACGACTCGTTTGCTCCAACTCACTCGTCCTC-3′ and 5′-atagcggccgcCTAAAGTTTTTTACCCAAAATGGAGGTAGC-3′. (Capital letters refer to regions of PGS1 homology with the start and stop codons underlined, respectively, and lowercase letters refer to restriction sites and filler DNA.) In order to insert the gene 3′ of the tetracycline-regulated promoter, the 1.59-kilobase pair amplicon was cut with BamHI and NotI and ligated into plasmid pCM189 (40Gari E. Piedrafita L. Aldea M. Herrero E. Yeast. 1997; 13: 837-848Crossref PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar) cut with the same restriction enzymes. Because of problems associated with the stability of PGS1plasmids in E. coli, ligations were transformed into and plasmids stored in yeast. Yeast spheroplast transformations ofpgs1Δ strains were accomplished as described (41Ostrander D.B. Gorman J.A. Yeast. 1997; 13: 871-880Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). Transformants were selected on yeast nitrogen base uracil dropout medium containing ethanol and glycerol (36Sherman F. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 3-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (2526) Google Scholar). The construct was verified by sequencing PCR products obtained by amplification of DNA isolated from the strain. The psg1Δ strain carrying this plasmid is referred to throughout the text as the “psg1-regulatable” strain and was maintained at 10 μg/ml doxycycline (fully repressed) on YEP (1% yeast extract, 2% peptone) medium with 2% sucrose. Derepression was accomplished by growth for at least 24 h in lower doxycycline concentrations. Strain YCD4 (also a psg1Δ strain) was also transformed with the plasmid and tested in several experiments as described under “Results.” Yeast strains were grown in YEP medium with 2% sucrose to the mid-exponential phase of growth. Total RNA was isolated using Trizol (Life Technologies, Inc.) with 0.5-mm zirconia/silica beads and a Mini BeadBeater (BioSpec Products). RNA was quantified by spectroscopy. Primers (see Table I for a list used) were selected to amplify transcribed regions from 500 to 800 base pairs in length by Oligo Primer Analysis Software. RT-PCR was accomplished using the Access System (Promega). Primers used forCOX1 and 21 S RNA were designed to detect only properly spliced messages. Quantification was accomplished by varying either the number of cycles or RNA concentrations. Care was taken to ensure that the amplification had not plateaued and that the reactions produced bands of similar intensities upon replication (no variability in starting exponential PCR amplification). Each preparation of RNA was standardized using primers for either COX4, COB,or ACT1. Standard reactions used 25 cycles, 50 pmol of each primer, and 100 ng/μl RNA in 50 μl. Amplicons were separated by agarose electrophoresis (Seakem, FMC), visualized with Sybr Green (Molecular Probes), and quantified using a Fluor-S MultiImager (Bio-Rad).Table IDNA primers (5′ to 3′) used to amplify RNA in RT-PCR experimentsATP6TACATCACCATTAGATCAATTTGAGATTAGACTAAATTAAATAGTAAA CCAGCTAAAATAACCATTAACBS1GTGAAGTCCTTGAAGTTAATCCTGACGGATATAATTTTGTTATCGTTTT TAATTTCGAGTAATTTCAGCBS2AGTTTATGGCATCTTGTGTCCCGCCCATTCTAAGTATCTTGTGCTCCGGG GATTTTCAAAAGTTCCTTCOBTGGCTAAAGGTTTATATTATGGTTCATATAGATCACCAAGAGTACCAGGTA CAATAGATGCTGGTGTTACTAAAGGATTACCAGGAATATCOX1TCAACTTTAGTAGAATCAGGTGCTGGTACAGGGTGAACTGTCTATAATTGC AATAATCATTAGTGCAGATAGGAAATATGCTCTAAGATCCOX2CATGTTATTTTCAGGATTCAGCAACACCAAATCAAGAAGGTATTTAAAAAT TTAGGTAATGATACTGCTTCGATCTTAATTGGCATATTTCOX3TCATTTGCATTATTATCATTAGCATTATCACTAGCATTAACAATGTGTACC AGCATAGAATACTGAACCATAAACACCATCAGAGATAGTMSS51CCCTTCCCGGAGTTTGATTTTCCCCAACAGCAAGAACCGTGAGATTCTGGA GATGCGTAGCCTGGATGPET54AGCAGTTGCAGGAAAAGAAACCTTCTGTCCTACATGAAGCTAGACCTTATG TTGTAAAACCAAAAATAPET111TGAGTTGATTGAATTTTGTCATTCTCTGTATTGCTTTAGAGTCACAAGTAG GTCATTTGTAATTTCTTPET122GCGTCAGCAGCAGCAGACCAGCGTGGATGTGGAGGCCAAAGGACACCAGCC AGTAGTAGCGGTAGTGAPET309ATACCGACATACGCTGTTTTACAATCTTTACTATCTATGATGCTCAATGCCG TTTCGCAATCTTCGTTPET494CTTAGTCGAGGAGCAGAACGCAAAGTTAGACACCCGTAGATATTATGGGGGA AAAGGAAGGAATGGTCPGS1ATATGGGTTTGATAACGAGGTCATTCTTTCGGGAGCCAACCTTTCTGCAGTG AACGTCCAAGAAATGGCATTGCTTGTTATAGTGGAAAG21 s rRNAGATCGAAAGATTGATCCAGTTACTTATTAGGATGAAACTTTGCAGCACGAAC TAAAGACAACAATGTA Open table in a new tab Yeast strains were grown to the mid-exponential phase of growth in YEP medium with 2% sucrose. Crude mitochondrial preparations were isolated (42Belendiuk G. Mangnall D. Tung B. Westley J. Getz G.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 4555-4565Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using a Mini BeadBeater (BioSpec Products) and differential centrifugation. PGPS assays were performed essentially as described previously (32Chang S.C. Heacock P.N. Clancey C.J. Dowhan W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9829-9836Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar) by conversion of [14C]glycerol 3-phosphate (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) to [14C]PG phosphate dependent on CDP-diacylglycerol (Avanti, dioleoyl). The resulting mixture of [14C]PG phosphate and [14C]PG was isolated and quantified in a liquid scintillation counter (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). One unit is equivalent to the formation of 1 nmol of PG phosphate plus PG per min per mg of protein. Phospholipid quantification was performed essentially as described previously (32Chang S.C. Heacock P.N. Clancey C.J. Dowhan W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9829-9836Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Cells were labeled for 12 h with 50 μCi of [32P]Pi (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in synthetic defined media (36Sherman F. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 3-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (2526) Google Scholar) with 2% sucrose to the mid-exponential phase of growth. Cells were homogenized with a solution of 10:5:4 CH3OH, CHCl3, 0.1 n HCl in a Mini BeadBeater (BioSpec Products). Lipids were isolated by acid organic extraction (half volumes each of CHCl3 and 0.1n HCl, 0.5 m NaCl), dried, and resuspended in an appropriate volume of CHCl3. Phospholipids were separated by thin layer chromatography using silica gel plates (Whatman) (43Fine J.B. Sprecher H. J. Lipid Res. 1982; 23: 660-663Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and individual species were identified by co-migration of standards (Sigma). Phospholipid quantification was accomplished using both one- and two-dimensional thin layer chromatography. The spots were quantified by phosphorimaging using either an Instant Imager (Packard Instrument Co.) or a Molecular Imager FX (Bio-Rad) and normalized to the total amount of organic soluble32P. The wild type andpsg1-regulatable strains were grown with no or 10 μg/ml doxycycline in YEP medium with 2% sucrose to the mid-exponential phase of growth. Cells were stained for 30 min with 50 nm10-N-nonyl acridine orange (NAO) (44Gallet P.F. Maftah A. Petit J.M. Denis-Gay M. Julien R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 228: 113-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) or 20 μm2-(4-dimethylaminostyryl)-1-methylpyridinium iodide (DASPMI) (45Bereiter-Hahn J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1976; 423: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar) and visualized with a 100× objective using a FITC filter. 50 μm carbonyl cyanidep-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone (FCCP) was added to DASPMI-stained cells grown without doxycycline to demonstrate complete dissipation of mitochondrial membrane potential. The isolation of mitochondria was accomplished essentially by the method of Glick and Pon (46Glick B.S. Pon L.A. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 260: 213-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). Cells were grown for 3 days in increasing volumes of YEP media with 2% sucrose to the mid-exponential phase of growth. Cells were harvested and spheroplasts prepared with zymolyase (ICN). Spheroplasted cells were lysed in hypotonic media by Dounce homogenization or with an Omnimixer (Omni). A crude mitochondrial preparation (pellet) was separated from the endoplasmic reticulum fraction (supernatant) by differential centrifugation. Highly purified mitochondria were obtained by sedimentation through a sucrose step gradient (47Gaigg B. Simbeni R. Hrastnik C. Paltauf F. Daum G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1234: 214-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). A 70% sucrose cushion was employed when isolating mitochondria from thepsg1-regulatable strain grown under repressing conditions. The mitochondrial associated microsomal membranes (MAM) fraction was isolated from the upper quarter of the gradient (48Achleitner G. Gaigg B. Krasser A. Kainersdorfer E. Kohlwein S.D. Perktold A. Zellnig G. Daum G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 264: 545-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Proteins from each fraction were concentrated using a TL100 ultracentrifuge (Beckman Instruments). Proteolipid isolation of ATPase subunits was accomplished as described (49Stephens A.N. Roucou X. Artika I.M. Devenish R.J. Nagley P. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 6443-6451Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) by organic extraction of sonicated highly purified mitochondria. ATP6p, ATP8p, and ATP9p were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) and visualized by silver staining. COX4 and COX6 were cloned into plasmid pCITE (CAP-independent translation enhancer, Novagen) by amplification of genomic DNA from strain DL1 using primer pairs 5′-ataccATGgTTTCACTACGTCAATCTATAA-3′ plus 5′-atagcatgcAGAAGGTAAAAAGTAAAAGAGAAAC-3′ and 5′-ataccATGgTATCAAGGGCCATATTCAGAA-3′ plus 5′-atagcatgcTTGTGTGGTAGCTTTTTCCTTATTA-3′, respectively. The amplicons and parent vector were cut with NcoI and SphI and ligated producing plasmids pDO290 (COX4) and pDO291 (COX6) in which the genes were expressed from the plasmid T7 promoter. Constructs were verified by sequencing. In vitrotranscription/translation was accomplished using the STP3 kit (Novagen) with 500 ng of plasmid DNA in each 100-μl transcription/translation reaction. Ribosomes were removed by centrifugation, and the biotinylated protein products were denatured with 5 m urea. The proteins were then prepared for import assays by 10-fold dilution. Mitochondrial protein import assays were accomplished as described (50Law R.H. Nagley P. Methods Mol. Biol. 1995; 37: 293-315PubMed Google Scholar). Highly purified mitochondria were thawed on ice and potentiated with ATP. The assays were performed with 50 μg of mitochondrial protein and 20 μl of the diluted biotinylation reaction.

PKR contains two dsRNA binding motifs (DRBMs I and II) required for activation by dsRNA. There is strong evidence that PKR activation requires dimerization, but the role of dsRNA in dimer formation is controversial. By making alanine substitutions predicted to remove increasing numbers of side chain contacts between the DRBMs and dsRNA, we found that dimerization of full-length PKR in yeast was impaired by the minimal combinations of mutations required to impair dsRNA bindingin vitro. Mutation of Ala-67 to Glu in DRBM-I, reported to abolish dimerization without affecting dsRNA binding, destroyed both activities in our assays. By contrast, deletion of a second dimerization region that overlaps the kinase domain had no effect on PKR dimerization in yeast. Human PKR contains at least 15 autophosphorylation sites, but only Thr-446 and Thr-451 in the activation loop were found here to be critical for kinase activity in yeast. Using an antibody specific for phosphorylated Thr-451, we showed that Thr-451 phosphorylation is stimulated by dsRNA binding. Our results provide strong evidence that dsRNA binding is required for dimerization of full-length PKR molecules in vivo, leading to autophosphorylation in the activation loop and stimulation of the eIF2α kinase function of PKR.

PKR interferes with virus replication by phosphorylating the α subunit of translation initiation factor 2 (eIF2α), converting eIF2 from a substrate to an inhibitor of its guanine nucleotide exchange factor, eIF2B. This reduction in recycling of eIF2 by eIF2B leads to a general inhibition of translation that limits viral protein synthesis (1Mathews M.B. Semin. Virol. 1993; 4: 247-257Crossref Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiaeharbors an eIF2α kinase known as GCN2 which is activated by uncharged tRNA when cells are starved for amino acids. Limited phosphorylation of eIF2α by GCN2 under starvation conditions leads to increased translation of GCN4 mRNA, encoding a transcriptional activator of amino acid biosynthetic genes (for review, see Ref. 2Hinnebusch A.G. Hershey J.W.B. Mathews M.B. Sonenberg N. Translational Control. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1996: 199-244Google Scholar). Low level expression of PKR in yeast produces a moderate level of eIF2α phosphorylation that is sufficient to induce GCN4expression without inhibiting general protein synthesis (3Dever T.E. Chen J.J. Barber G.N. Cigan A.M. Feng L. Donahue T.F. London I.M. Katze M.G. Hinnebusch A.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 4616-4620Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). When PKR is expressed at higher levels, eIF2α phosphorylation increases to the point where general translation and yeast cell growth are strongly inhibited (3Dever T.E. Chen J.J. Barber G.N. Cigan A.M. Feng L. Donahue T.F. London I.M. Katze M.G. Hinnebusch A.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 4616-4620Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar, 4Chong K.L. Feng L. Schappert K.

PKR kinase activity is stimulated in vitro by dsRNA, and the N-terminal 168 amino acids of the protein contain two copies of a dsRNA-binding motif (DRBMs I and II; Fig.1 A) that is also present in other dsRNA-binding proteins (5Fierro-Monti I. Mathews M.B. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 241-246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Point mutations in the DRBMs which impair dsRNA binding by PKRin vitro reduce the ability of PKR to phosphorylate eIF2α in yeast cells, supporting the idea that the DRBMs mediate the stimulatory effect of dsRNA on PKR kinase activity (4Chong K.L.

Alanine substitution of the autophosphorylation site at Thr-258 (T258A), located between the DRBMs and kinase domain, produced a modest reduction in PKR function in yeast and mammalian cells (10Taylor D.R. Lee S.B. Romano P.R. Marshak D.R. Hinnebusch A.G. Esteban M. Mathews M.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6295-6302Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). In contrast, substitution of the autophosphorylation site at Thr-446 (T446A) in the activation loop of the kinase domain substantially reduced kinase activity. The T451A mutation in the activation loop completely destroyed kinase function, but the evidence that this site is autophosphorylated was inconclusive (11Romano S.-S.P.R. Garcia-Barrio M.T. Zhang X. Wang Q. Taylor D.R. Zhang F. Herring C. Mathews M.B. Qin J. Hinnebusch A.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2282-2297Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It has been proposed that dsRNA binding overcomes a negative effect of the DRBMs on PKR catalytic function, based on the finding that extensive deletions in the N-terminal region of the protein that removed both DRBMs did not abolish (14Wu S. Kaufman R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1756-1763Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), and even enhanced (15Zhu S. Romano P.R. Wek R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14434-14441Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) kinase activity. The N-terminal and C-terminal halves of PKR physically interacted in the two-hybrid assay (16Sharp T.V. Romashko A. Moonan F. Joshi B. Barber G.N. Jagus R. Virology. 1998; 250: 302-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), and NMR data indicate that DRBM-II, but not DRBM-I, binds to the kinase domain (17Nanduri S. Rahman F. Williams B.R. Qin J. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5567-5574Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Additionally, dsRNA binding induces a conformational change in PKR (18Manche L. Green S.R. Schmedt C. Mathews M.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 5238-5248Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar, 19Carpick B.W. Graziano V. Schneider D. Maitra R.K. Lee X. Williams B.R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9510-9516Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). These results have led to models in which the DRBMs (or just DRBM-II) bind to the kinase domain and interfere with its enzymatic function, and this inhibitory interaction is eliminated by a conformational change in PKR elicited by dsRNA binding to the DRBMs (17Nanduri S. Rahman F. Williams B.R. Qin J. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5567-5574Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 20Wu S. Kaufman R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1291-1296Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). There is also evidence that dsRNA activates PKR by promoting dimerization of the enzyme and intermolecular autophosphorylation. The fact that PKR activation exhibits second-order kinetics with respect to protein concentration suggests that the active form of PKR is a dimer (9Kostura M. Mathews M.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 1576-1586Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar), and the enzyme was purified as a phosphorylated dimer (21Langland J.O. Jacobs B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 10729-10736Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The observation that two inactive PKR alleles containing deletions of DRBM-I or DRBM-II functionally complemented was most readily explained by formation of active heterodimers (6Romano P.R. Green S.R. Barber G.N. Mathews M.B. Hinnebusch A.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 365-378Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It was also shown that an N-terminal segment of PKR containing the DRBMs could be coimmunoprecipitated with full-length PKR from transfected COS cells (14Wu S. Kaufman R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1756-1763Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), and N-terminal segments were found to interact with themselves and with full-length PKR in various interaction assays (22Cosentino G.P.

Biol. 1998; 18: 2431-2443Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). PKR activation is inhibited by high concentrations of dsRNA, leading to a bell-shaped dsRNA activation curve (26Hunter T. Hunt T. Jackson R.J. Robertson H.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 409-417Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This behavior has been explained by proposing that dimerization requires binding of two PKR molecules to the same dsRNA, as high dsRNA concentrations would favor dissociation of dimers into inactive monomers bound to different dsRNA molecules (9Kostura M. Mathews M.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 1576-1586Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Consistently, high level activation of PKR requires a minimum length of dsRNA (∼40 base pairs) which is considerably larger than the binding site for two DRBMs in a single PKR molecule (11–16 base pairs) (18Manche L. Green S.R. Schmedt C. Mathews M.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 5238-5248Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar, 27Schmedt C. Green S.R. Manche L. Taylor D.R. Ma Y. Mathews M.B. J. Mol.

These data, combined with the observation that PKR can autophosphorylate in trans (29Thomis D.C. Samuel C.E. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 5195-5198Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,30Ortega L.G. McCotter M.D. Henry G.L. McCormack S.J. Thomis D.C. Samuel C.E. Virology. 1996; 215: 31-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), have led to the idea that binding of two PKR molecules to the same dsRNA promotes dimerization and intermolecular autophosphorylation events required for substrate phosphorylation. Although there is some evidence that PKR dimerization is strongly dependent on dsRNA binding (19Carpick B.W. Graziano V. Schneider D. Maitra R.K. Lee X. Williams B.R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9510-9516Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 22Cosentino G.P. Venkatesan S. Serluca F.C. Green S.R. Mathews M.B. Sonenberg N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9445-9449Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar), many studies suggest that dimerization is relatively unaffected by point mutations in the DRBMs that impair dsRNA binding in vitro (14Wu S. Kaufman R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1756-1763Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 22Cosentino G.P. Venkatesan S. Serluca F.C. Green S.R. Mathews M.B. Sonenberg N.

Virology. 1996; 215: 31-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The results of the latter studies suggest that protein-protein interactions can mediate PKR dimerization in the absence of dsRNA binding. Wu and Kaufman (20Wu S. Kaufman R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1291-1296Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar) found that dimerization by isolated DRBMs could occur independently of dsRNA binding but that dimerization of full-length PKR with the isolated DRBM was dsRNA-dependent. To account for these findings, they proposed that dsRNA binding to full-length PKR was required primarily to dissociate the DRBMs from the kinase domain and unmask a dimerization surface in the DRBMs. However, recent evidence that only DRBM-II interacts with the kinase domain implies that DRBM-I is exposed and available for dimerization constitutively (17Nanduri S. Rahman F. Williams B.R. Qin J. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5567-5574Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). A second dimerization domain in PKR was localized to the 244–296 interval, overlapping the N-terminal portion of the kinase domain (25Tan S.L. Gale M.J. Katze M.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2431-2443Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Nanduriet al. (17Nanduri S. Rahman F. Williams B.R. Qin J. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5567-5574Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar) proposed that this region becomes available for dimerization after dissociation of DRBM-II from the kinase domain upon dsRNA binding and provides the critical dimerization surface in the enzyme. However, the importance of the 244–296 interval for dimerization by full-length PKR has not been addressed experimentally. An alternative model for PKR activation was proposed by Patel and Sen (31Patel R.C. Sen G.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 7009-7019Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) in which dimerization occurs independently of dsRNA binding, and dsRNA (or alternative stimulatory ligands) activate a preformed PKR dimer by producing a conformational change in the protein. It was found that mutating residue Ala-67 to Glu in DRBM-I abolished dimerization of the N-terminal domain of PKR without affecting dsRNA binding. This suggested that Ala-67 is required for a critical protein-protein contact between the dimerized DRBMs. The fact that A67E had a much greater effect on kinase function than did a mutation (K60A) that abolished dsRNA binding without impairing dimerization led these workers to propose that dimerization precedes dsRNA binding and that PKR dimers can be activated in yeast independently of dsRNA. The solution structure of the N-terminal domain of PKR showed that DRBMs I and II have topologies highly similar to that of other DRBMs (32Bycroft M. Grunert S. Murzin A.G. Proctor M. St. Johnston D. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3563-3571Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar, 33Kharrat A. Macias M.J. Gibson T.J. Nilges M. Pastore A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3572-3584Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar), separated by a flexible linker of about 20 residues (34Nanduri S. Carpick B.W. Yang Y. Williams B.R. Qin J. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5458-5465Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). The crystal structure of a complex between dsRNA and a single DRBM from theXenopus laevis RNA-binding protein A (Xlrbpa-2) revealed three different contact regions in the DRBM which interact with two successive minor grooves and the intervening major groove on one face of the dsRNA molecule (35Ryter J.M. Schultz S.C. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 7505-7513Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). The same three RNA contact regions were identified in the NMR structure of the DRBM-3 of DrosophilaStaufen bound to an RNA stem-loop (36Ramos A. Grunert S. Adams J. Micklem D.R. Proctor M.R. Freund S. Bycroft M. St. Johnston D. Varani G. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 997-1009Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). In view of these findings, we considered the possibility that certain PKRmutations studied previously which altered only one of three RNA contact regions in DRBM-I (e.g. K60A) might not completely impair dsRNA binding. In this event, conclusions about the dependence of dimerization and kinase activation on dsRNA binding based on such mutations would be questionable. In addition, the conclusion that dimerization by full-length PKR is dsRNA-dependent derived from analysis of a single mutation (K64E) in DRBM-I (20Wu S. Kaufman R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1291-1296Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). With the finding that only DRBM-II interacts with the kinase domain (17Nanduri S. Rahman F. Williams B.R. Qin J. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5567-5574Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar), we wished to determine whether dsRNA binding by DRBM-II is required for dimerization. Accordingly, we constructed point mutations designed to destroy side chain interactions in one, two, or all three predicted dsRNA contact regions in DRBMs I and II and examined their effects on dimerization by full-length PKR molecules expressed in yeast cells. Our results provide strong support for the idea that dimerization by full-length PKR is dependent on dsRNA binding, but they show that it occurs independently of the dimerization domain between residues 244 and 296. We also employed the DRBM point mutants to investigate whether dsRNA binding and dimerization stimulate autophosphorylation in the PKR activation loop. Using an antibody specific for phosphothreonine 451, we provide evidence that phosphorylation of this residue is stimulated by dsRNA binding. Finally, we show that Ser-33 and multiple autophosphorylation sites in the flexible linker between the DRBMs, and within kinase subdomain V, are largely dispensable for PKR function in yeast. Our data provide strong support for a model in which dsRNA binding enables dimer formation, enhancing autophosphorylation of Thr-451 in the activation loop with attendant activation of the eIF2α kinase function of PKR.

Whole cell extracts (WCEs) were prepared by breaking cells with glass beads in lysis buffer (20 mmTris, pH 8.0, 50 mm KCl, 400 mm NaCl, 20% glycerol, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.1% Triton X-100) supplemented with 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 mm2-aminopurine, 10 mm NaF, 50 mmβ-glycerolphosphate, 125 μm sodium orthovanadate, and complete protease inhibitor (CPI) mixture (Roche). For analysis of phosphatase-treated proteins, samples of WCE containing 25 μg of protein, prepared as above except that 10 mm NaF, 50 mm β-glycerolphosphate, and 125 μm sodium orthovanadate were omitted from the lysis buffer, were treated with 2 units of calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase (CIP) (New England BioLabs) for 30 min at 37 °C. A phosphatase inhibitor mixture containing 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 5 mmEDTA, 5 mm EGTA, and 125 μm sodium orthovanadate was added to selected samples prior to CIP treatment. Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Membranes probed with pT451 antibodies were blocked in TBS-T (20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20) containing 3% bovine serum albumin, whereas all other membranes where blocked in a solution of TBS-T containing 5% non-fat dry milk. Immunodetection of FLAG-tagged PKR (FL-PKR), triple HA-tagged PKR (HA3-PKR), and untagged PKR was conducted as indicated in the figure legends using a monoclonal antibody against the FLAG epitope (Sigma), polyclonal antibodies against the HA-epitope (BabCo), and polyclonal antibodies specific for the N terminus (N-18) or C terminus (K-17) of PKR (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Immunodetection of PKR phosphorylated at Thr-451 was conducted using phosphospecific polyclonal antibodies (BIOSOURCE International) in blocking solution containing 3% bovine serum albumin. Immunoblot analysis of eIF2α phosphorylation was conducted using polyclonal antibodies specific for pS51 (Research Genetics) and polyclonal antibodies against total eIF2α (CM-217) (40Cigan A.M.

Immune complexes were visualized with the enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) detection system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) according to the vendor's instructions and quantified by video image densitometry of the resulting autoradiograms using NIH Image 1.61 software. Yeast WCEs were prepared by breaking cells with glass beads in the yeast lysis buffer described above supplemented with CPI and phosphatase inhibitor mixtures. Samples of WCEs containing 200 μg of protein were incubated with poly(I-C)-agarose beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in 200 μl of binding buffer (150 mm KCl, 20 mm Hepes, 10% glycerol, 5 mm magnesium acetate) plus CPI mixture and phosphatase inhibitors for 1 h at 4 °C. The beads were collected by centrifugation, washed three times with lysis buffer, resuspended in 30 μl of 2 × Laemmli sample buffer (41Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207233) Google Scholar), and boiled for 5 min. Proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and subjected to immunoblot analysis as described above. Yeast WCEs were prepared by breaking yeast cells with glass beads in immunoprecipitation lysis buffer (IP buffer) (20 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.0, 500 mmNaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100) supplemented with CPI and phosphatase inhibitor mixtures. Aliquots containing 500 μg of protein were diluted to 100 μl in IP buffer and incubated with anti-FLAG M2-agarose (Sigma) at 4 °C overnight with rocking. The beads were collected by centrifugation, washed three times with IP buffer, resuspended in 30 μl of 2 × Laemmli sample buffer, and boiled for 5 min. The proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and subjected to immunoblot analysis as described above. HeLa cells grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum were treated with interferons (IFN) α/β and poly(I-C) as described in Fig. 6 A. Cells were washed twice with cold phosphate-buffered saline containing CPI and phosphatase inhibitor mixtures described above and lysed in extraction buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mmNaCl, 1% Triton X-100) containing CPI mixture and phosphatase inhibitors. For immunopurification of PKR, an aliquot of WCE containing 500 μg of protein was incubated with PKR monoclonal antibody 71/10 (Ribogene/Questcor) for 2"

We have previously shown that IFN-β suppresses growth of human ovarian carcinoma xenografts in vivo and induces apoptosis of ovarian carcinoma cells in vitro. To investigate mechanisms of IFN-β-induced apoptosis we employed an antisense technical knockout approach to identify gene products that mediate cell death and have isolated several regulators of interferon-induced death (RIDs). In this investigation, we have characterized one of the RIDs, RID-2. Sequence analysis revealed that RID-2 was identical to human inositol hexakisphosphate kinase 2 (IP6K2). IP6K2 is post-transcriptionally induced by IFN-β in ovarian carcinoma cells. A mutant IP6K2 with substitutions in the putative inositol phosphate binding domain abrogates IFN-β-induced apoptosis.

Upon binding to receptors, IFNs activate a signaling cascade wherein Janus tyrosine kinases induce tyrosine phosphorylation of signal-transducing activators of transcription proteins (4Stark G.R. Kerr I.M. Williams B.R. Silverman R.H. Schreiber R.D. Ann. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 227-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (3343) Google Scholar, 5Darnell J.E.J. Science. 1997; 277: 1630-1635Crossref PubMed Scopus (3330) Google Scholar). These transcription factors induce expression of hundreds of genes that possess a wide range of activities (6Der S.D. Zhou A. Williams B.R. Silverman R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 15623-15628Crossref PubMed Scopus (1509) Google Scholar). Although a great deal is known about antiviral actions of IFNs, mechanisms responsible for their antitumor actions are unclear.In vivo, they up-regulate expression of tumor-specific antigens, natural killer, and T cell function (7Ortaldo J.R.

Academic Press, New York1997: 515-551Crossref Google Scholar), also play a role in growth suppression (16Barber G.N. Wamback M. Thompson S. Jagus R. Katze M.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3138-3146Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 17Hassel B.A. Zhou A. Sotomayor C. Maran A. Silverman R.H. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3297-3304Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). The family of transcription factors known as IFN gene regulatory factors (IRFs) also mediates the effects of IFNs (18Harada H. Kitagawa M. Tanaka N. Yamamoto H. Harada K. Ishihara M. Taniguchi T. Science. 1993; 259: 971-974Crossref PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar). Two members of this family, IRF-1 and interferon consensus sequence-binding protein (IRF-8) are up-regulated by IFN-γ. Deletion of these genes results in myelodysplasias or chronic myelogenous leukemia-like disease (19Willman C.L. Sever C.E. Pallavicini M.G. Harada H. Tanaka N. Slovak M.L. Yamamoto H. Harada K.

Because IRFs are transcription factors, and their biological activity depends on genes they induce; characterization of downstream gene products should allow identification of critical regulators of growth suppression. We have previously shown that IFN-β suppresses the growth of ovarian tumor xenografts in nude mice (21Lindner D.J. Borden E.C. J. Interferon Cytokine Res. 1997; 17: 681-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) and that IFN-β induces apoptosis in these cells. To identify death genes we used an antisense technical knockout approach (22Deiss L.P. Kimchi A. Science. 1991; 252: 117-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). In this approach, death regulatory genes are identified by their ability, when expressed in antisense orientation, to confer resistance to death inducers. Using this technique we have identified several genes, regulators of interferon-induced death (RIDs), that enhance IFN-β-activated death. In this study we have characterized one of these genes, RID-2, and identified it as human inositol hexakisphosphate kinase 2 (IP6K2) (23Saiardi A. Erdjument-Bromage H. Snowman A.M. Tempst P. Snyder S.H. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 1323-1326Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). IP6K2 catalyzes the synthesis of diphosphoinositol pentakisphosphate (PP-IP5) using inositol hexaphosphate (IP6) as a substrate in the presence of ATP. Hence, PP-IP5 may cause growth suppression. We show that cellular IP6K2 levels are post-transcriptionally enhanced by IFN-β. Overexpression of IP6K2 enhances both growth suppressive and apoptotic activities of IFN-β. A dominant negative inositol phosphate binding domain (IPBD) mutant is highly resistant to both the antiproliferative and apoptotic functions of IFN-β. Thus, our studies ascribe a novel function for IP6K2 in cell growth control via apoptosis. Human IFN-β (Serono), specific activity 2.7 × 108 units/mg; IFN-α2b (Schering Plough), specific activity 3 × 108 units/mg; IFN-γ (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), specific activity 2 × 107units/mg; [3H]inositol and [3H]IP6 (PerkinElmer Life Sciences); anti-PARP antibody (Biomol); anti-caspase 3 antibody (Pharmingen); anti-myc antibody (Oncogene Research Products); and horseradish peroxidase goat antirabbit IgG (Pierce) were used in these studies. Cells were treated with IFNs during growth in RPMI 1640 and 5% fetal bovine serum. Growth was monitored using a calorimetric assay (24Skehan P. Storeng R. Scudiero D. Monks A. McMahon J. Vistica D. Warren J.T. Bokesch H. Kenney S. Boyd M.R. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1990; 82: 1107-1112Crossref PubMed Scopus (8663) Google Scholar). Each treatment group contained eight replicates. Cells were fixed and stained with sulforhodamine B after 7 days. Bound dye was eluted from cells, and absorbance (A exp) was measured at 570 nm. One plate was fixed 8 h after plating to determine the absorbance representing starting cell number (A ini). Absorbance with this plate and that obtained with untreated cells at the end of the growth period (A fin) were taken as 0 and 100% growth, respectively. Thus, percent control growth = 100% × (A exp −A ini)/(A fin −A ini) expressed as a percent of untreated controls; a decrease in cell number (death) falls on the negative scale. To determine cell cycle distribution, cells were stained with propidium iodide and analyzed by flow cytometry (Beckton Dickinson) using MultiPass software. Total RNA from NIH-OVCAR-3 cells, treated with IFN-β (500 units/ml) for 0, 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 24, 48, and 72 h, was prepared using RNAZol B (Tel-Test). RNAs were pooled, and total poly(A)+ RNA was isolated (polyAttract; Promega). cDNA libraries were constructed with a commercially available kit (Stratagene). 10 μg of mRNA was used for preparing the cDNA library, using an oligo(dT) primer and a dNTP mixture containing 5-methyl dCTP. After second-strand synthesis,Pfu thermal DNA polymerase was used to create blunt-ended cDNA. cDNAs were ligated to a bifunctional linker, 5′-GCTTGGATCCAAGC-3′. Ligated to the 3′ and 5′ ends of the cDNA, this linker generates HindIII and BamHI sites, respectively (25Meissner P.S. Sisk W.P. Berman M.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 4171-4175Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). The library was digested with HindIII andBamHI, purified on a Sepharose 6B column, and ligated into an episomal vector pTKO1 (from Adi Kimchi, Weizmann Institute, Rehovot, Israel), which carried markers for selection in eukaryotic and bacterial cells (22Deiss L.P. Kimchi A. Science. 1991; 252: 117-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). When cloned into pTKO1 the cDNA is expressed in antisense orientation. The library was transformed into Escherichia coli DH10B, and plasmid DNA was extracted and purified on CsCl gradients. Electroporation of the library (40 μg) into NIH-OVCAR-3 cells (107) was followed by selection with hygromycin B (200 μg/ml) and IFN-β (2000 units/ml) for 4 weeks. All pTKO1-transfected cells (selected similarly) died after 14 days. After 4 weeks selection-surviving colonies were pooled and expanded, and Hirt DNA extracts were prepared. DNA was digested with DpnI and electroporated into E. coli DH10B. Resultant colonies were screened by PCR using pTKO1-specific primers to detect inserts. Episomes (20 μg) were tested for protection against IFN-β-induced death by electroporation into NIH-OVCAR-3 cells. Selection with IFN-β and hygromycin was initiated after 24 h. RID-2 cDNA was digested from pTKO1 and cloned into the pCXN2myc mammalian expression vector (26Kinoshita S. Suzuki H. Ito K. Kume K. Shimizu T. Sugiyama Y. Pharm. Res. 1998; 15: 1851-1856Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) in which the chicken actin promoter regulates expression of the Myc-His-tagged insert. A substitution mutant (SUB) of the putative IPBD was created using PCR-based site-directed mutagenesis (Stratagene) with full-length RID-2 as template, replacing the highly conserved (bold) core consensus IPBD (PCVLDLKMG) with point mutations at 7 of 9 residues (to yield amino acid residuesACTANLAAA) using primers 5′-pAACCTCGCGGCAGCAACACGACAACATGGTGAT-3′ and 5′-pAGCGGTACAAGCCACCTCATAGCGGGAAGT-3′ (p indicates phosphorylated 5′ nucleotide). PCR products were digested with DpnI, ligated, and then transformed into JM109 E. coli, and plasmids were isolated. An antisense mutant (ANTI) was created by ligating RID-2 open reading frame into pCXN2myc in antisense orientation. Mutations were confirmed by sequencing. Constructs were electroporated into NIH-OVCAR-3 cells, and stable transfectants were selected with G418. After 3 weeks of selection, surviving clones were pooled for further studies. Expression of mutants was monitored by Western blotting. Total RNA (20 μg) was separated on 1% formaldehyde-agarose gels, transferred to nylon membrane, and probed with the 32P-labeled PCR product of RID-2 cDNA. Total cell protein (20 μg) was separated on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. Membranes were incubated with rabbit polyclonal antibody, made in our laboratory, raised against full-length bacterially expressed RID-2. After washing, membranes were incubated with anti-rabbit IgG antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase and developed using ECL reagents (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Apoptotic cells were detected using a commercially available kit (Pharmingen) and staining with annexin V-FITC and propidium iodide (PI). Cells were analyzed by flow cytometry. DNA fragmentation was detected using the APO-BRDUTM kit (Pharmingen). Cells were labeled with bromo-dUTP using terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase, stained with FITC-conjugated anti-bromodeoxyuridine monoclonal antibody followed by RNase-PI. The percentage of FITC-positive cells was determined by flow cytometry. IP6K activity (27Voglmaier S.M. Bembenek M.E. Kaplin A.I. Dorman G. Olszewski J.D. Prestwich G.D. Snyder S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad.

Using 0.15-ml extracts, kinase assays were run in 0.5 ml of 100 mm KCl, 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, 5 mm Na2ATP, 6 mm MgSO4, 10 mm phosphocreatine, 20 U creatine phosphokinase, 0.1 mg of saponin using [3H]IP6 (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) as substrate. Reactions were incubated at 37 °C for 20 min. Reactions were terminated on ice and then quenched with 0.25 ml of 6% v/v perchloric acid and 0.5 mg/ml IP6 (Calbiochem) followed by extraction with 1:1 freon/octylamine and concentration by Speedvac. Products were separated using polyethyleneimine cellulose thin-layer chromatography (PEI-TLC; Merck). The reaction was spotted onto PEI-TLC plates and developed in 1.1 m KH2PO4, 0.8 mK2HPO4, and 2.3 m HCl. Lanes were divided into 1-cm fractions, and the PEI cellulose matrix was scraped from the TLC plates, shaken with 0.5 ml of 16 m HCl, mixed with 0.5 ml of H2O, 3 ml of scintillant, and counted. ∼80% of applied 3H was recovered by this method. IP6 and PP-IP5 migrated with an Rf migration ratio of ∼0.75 and ∼0.45, respectively, and comigrated with standard preparations. [3H]PP-IP5 standard was prepared by incubation of 20 ng of recombinant IP6K2 and [3H]IP6 in a kinase reaction as above (60-min incubation), followed by high pressure liquid chromatography purification on a 4.6 × 125-mm Partisphere strong anion exchange column (Whatman). Gradient elution utilized Buffer A (1 mm Na2EDTA) and Buffer B (Buffer A and 1.3 m(NH4)2HPO4). On PEI-TLC plates, area under the curve (AUC) was used to determine total radioactivity of each species. We have previously shown that human IFN-β induces regression of NIH-OVCAR-3 human ovarian carcinoma in athymic nude mice (21Lindner D.J. Borden E.C. J. Interferon Cytokine Res. 1997; 17: 681-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). To directly demonstrate that IFN-β was cytotoxic in vitro, we treated tumor cell lines with various IFNs. After 1 week, cell growth was measured using a colorimetric assay based on binding of the chromophore sulforhodamine B (24Skehan P. Storeng R. Scudiero D. Monks A. McMahon J. Vistica D. Warren J.T. Bokesch H. Kenney S. Boyd M.R. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1990; 82: 1107-1112Crossref PubMed Scopus (8663) Google Scholar). Increasing doses of IFN-β caused significant growth inhibition in NIH-OVCAR-3 cells in vitro, with complete cytostasis occurring at ∼300 units/ml (Fig.1 A) and death occurring at 500–1000 units/ml. IFN-β was significantly more potent than IFN-α at growth inhibition. IFN-α resulted in only 39% inhibition at the highest dose, whereas IFN-β was cytocidal. IFN-γ had negligible effect on cell growth even at 1000 units/ml (Fig. 1 A). Hence IFN-β was most effective of the type I IFNs at induction of death. Microscopic examination of NIH-OVCAR-3 cells treated with IFN-β revealed a dose-dependent cytotoxicity, with condensed nuclei detected by intense DAPI staining (Fig.2 A, arrows). Untreated cells had a diffuse pattern of DAPI staining. To identify apoptotic cells annexin V binding assays were performed. IFN-β was much more efficient than IFN-α at causing phosphatidyl serine translocation in the plasma membrane, but IFN-γ did not cause increased annexin V binding (TableI). IFN-β at low concentrations (200 units/ml) caused 61% apoptosis after 3 days of exposure, whereas high concentrations of IFN-α (1000 units/ml) induced only 16% apoptosis. Maximum apoptosis induced by IFN-γ (2000 units/ml) was 8%, no different from untreated cells. TUNEL assays confirmed that chromosomal fragmentation occurred as early as 48 h after treatment with 200 units/ml IFN-β (Fig. 2 B). The degree of chromosomal fragmentation detected by TUNEL assay mirrored the extent of annexin V staining (Table I). IFN-β induced highest levels of TUNEL staining, IFN-α generated intermediate levels, and IFN-γ did not cause an increase over baseline.Table IEffect of IFNs on induction of apoptosis in NIH-OVCAR-3 cellsTreatmentUnits/mlHoursAnnexin VTUNELNone6.85.4IFN-β2004844.631.62007261.558.8IFN-α500487.16.510007216.312.7IFN-γ1000487.36.12000728.07.4Numbers indicate % of positive cells determined by flow cytometry, mean of three separate experiments. Open table in a new tab Numbers indicate % of positive cells determined by flow cytometry, mean of three separate experiments. To determine whether cell cycle arrest preceded death, cells were treated with IFN-β for 1–3 days, stained with PI, and analyzed by flow cytometry. Interestingly, neither IFN-β nor IFN-α caused cell cycle arrest (Fig. 1 B). The proportion of cells in G0/G1, S, and G2/M phases was unchanged after IFN-β or IFN-α treatment (200 units/ml). Thus, death occurred independently of cell cycle arrest. Unlike IFN-α or IFN-γ, only IFN-β caused death in NIH-OVCAR-3 cells at low doses (200 units/ml). Similarly, in WM9 melanoma and KU2 renal carcinoma IFN-β strongly induced apoptosis compared with IFN-α (not shown). IFN-γ (2000 units/ml) did not inhibit growth or induce apoptosis in any cell line tested (NIH-OVCAR-3, MCF-7, WM-9, KU2, MDA-MB-231, HT-29, and A375). To confirm that caspases were activated by IFN-β, Western blotting for caspase 3 and PARP was performed. After 8 h of IFN-β treatment, cleavage of caspase 3 was evident, followed by PARP cleavage at 16 h (Fig. 3,arrows). Hence, at least one effector caspase and its downstream substrate necessary for cell viability were proteolytically cleaved following IFN-β treatment. Because NIH-OVCAR-3 cells contain non-functional p53 (28Yaginuma Y. Westphal H. Cancer Res. 1992; 52: 4196-4199PubMed Google Scholar, 29Ramet M. Castren K. Jarvinen K. Pekkala K. Turpeenniemi-Hujanen T. Soini Y. Paakko P. Vahakangas K. Carcinogenesis. 1995; 16: 2117-2124Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), apoptosis appears to occur via p53-independent mechanisms. We hypothesized that hitherto unidentified molecules may transmit the death signal to the core apoptotic machinery resulting in activation of caspases. Therefore we sought to identify gene products using an antisense knockout approach (22Deiss L.P. Kimchi A. Science. 1991; 252: 117-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). In this technique, a death-regulatory gene can be isolated by antisense inactivation. Cells are transfected with an antisense cDNA library derived from tumor cells. Antisense RNA inhibits expression of the endogenous death gene. Consequently, only those cell clones that express the death-related antisense mRNA will survive in the presence of death inducer. Rescued episomes are retransfected individually into ovarian carcinoma cells to express the antisense mRNA and eliminate false positives isolated in the first round of transfection. To isolate death-regulatory genes we prepared antisense cDNA libraries cloned in the episomal vector, pTKO1. An IFN-stimulated gene promoter drives expression of antisense RNAs in this vector. This library was electroporated into NIH-OVCAR-3 cells (∼50% transfection efficiency) and selected for resistance to hygromycin B and human IFN-β. Cell clones surviving 4 weeks of double selection were pooled, and Hirt extracts were prepared. DNA was digested with DpnI (to inactivate unreplicated input DNA) and electroporated into E. coli DH10B. 18 episomes were rescued in the first round. Each episome was individually transfected into NIH-OVCAR-3 cells and examined for cell protection against IFN-β-induced death. After two rounds of screening, seven episomes consistently conferred resistance to IFN-β-induced death. We named them RIDs. We chose RID-2 for further characterization. Transfection of the RID-2 antisense episome clearly conferred protection against IFN-β-induced death (Fig.4). No surviving colonies were seen in cells transfected with pTKO1 vector alone. The RID-2 insert was completely sequenced on both strands. The predicted open reading frame codes for a 49.2-kDa protein. Sequence analysis (Fig.5) revealed that this cDNA was identical to human IP6K2, GenBankTM accession number AAF15057 (23Saiardi A. Erdjument-Bromage H. Snowman A.M. Tempst P. Snyder S.H. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 1323-1326Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). A putative (Fig. 5, underlined) is located between amino acids 201 and 232 of this protein. The IPBD motif consensus sequence is (LV)(LA)(DE)X(3,8)P X(VAI)(ML)D X K(ML)G, where X can be any amino acid. The most highly conserved residues are shown in bold. This sequence is required for the catalytic activity of inositol 1,4,5 triphosphate kinase (30Togashi S. Takazawa K. Endo T. Erneux C. Onaya T. Biochem. J. 1997; 326: 221-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Among the notable features are the presence of a large number of methionine residues and the high concentration of acidic residues in the C terminus. Henceforth, RID-2 will be referred to as IP6K2. To study the effect of IFN-β on IP6K2, we first examined whether its mRNA levels were inducible. IFN-β did not induce IP6K2 mRNA in NIH-OVCAR-3 cells even after prolonged exposure (Fig.6 A). Reprobing blots with glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase cDNA demonstrated the presence of comparable amounts of RNA in each lane. Similarly, IP6K2 mRNA was not induced in CaOv-3 or Hey ovarian carcinoma cells (not shown). To examine whether IFN-β enhanced expression of IP6K2 protein, Western blot analysis was performed on whole cell lysates. IFN-β induced IP6K2 protein in a time-dependent manner. There was no detectable induction until 4 h post-treatment. Between 4 and 24 h, IP6K2 protein levels remained elevated (Fig.6 B). Densitometric quantitation of this blot revealed that maximal elevation of IP6K2 protein levels occurred at 16 h of IFN-β treatment (∼5-fold induction) and declined thereafter (Fig.6 C). Because the rescued episome clearly conferred protection from death (Fig. 4), it was important to confirm that this effect was because of expression of antisense IP6K2 mRNA and subsequent down-regulation of IP6K2 protein. Northern blot analysis (Fig. 7) of cells transfected either with vector alone (V) or antisense IP6K2 (ANTI) was performed. In vector cells only one band, representing endogenous (E) IP6K2 mRNA was seen. ANTI cells also express endogenous mRNA and, in addition, express another mRNA species that migrated more slowly (arrow). This second band, absent in vector cells, corresponds to antisense IP6K2 mRNA transcribed from the trans gene. We then determined whether anti-mRNA expression resulted in down-regulation of protein. Western blot analysis showed that ANTI cells contained lower levels of IP6K2 protein compared with vector cells (Fig. 7). We next determined whether the rise in IP6K2 protein levels following IFN-β correlated with an increase in IP6K enzymatic activity. In vitro kinase assays utilizing [3H]IP6 as substrate were performed to measure IP6K activity in whole cell homogenates of untreated and IFN-β-treated cells, using equal amounts of total cell protein. In the reaction, PP-IP5 was synthesized by IP6K, using ATP and [3H]IP6 as substrates. Indeed, enzymatic activity of IP6K was increased after 4 h of IFN-β exposure, reaching a peak at 8 h and beginning to decrease from maximum by 24 h (Fig.8). Enzymatic activity was consistent with IP6K2 protein concentration as determined by Western blotting (Fig. 6 C). When normalized for immunoreactive IP6K2, enzyme-specific activity was unchanged by IFN-β treatment. Untreated cells displayed an activity of 8 ± 2 pmol/mg protein/min. IFN-α2b or IFN-γ did not enhance IP6K activity at concentrations up to 1000 units/ml (not shown). ANTI cells expressing antisense IP6K2 mRNA assayed at the 8-h time point displayed reduced enzymatic activity compared with untransfected cells, indicated by reduced (∼2-fold) levels of the PP-IP5 product. As described above (Fig. 5) IP6K2 possesses a putative IPBD. Therefore, we examined the functional relevance of this domain by generating an SUB. In this mutant, 7 of 9 conserved residues in the IPBD were mutated at positions 216, 218–220, and 222–224. Expression of this mutant open reading frame in the pCXN2myc vector allowed detection of the SUB protein with anti-Myc antibody. This vector was transfected into NIH-OVCAR-3 cells, and stable cell lines were established. Full-length (FL) IP6K2 was cloned into the same vector. During generation of FL stable transfectants, 70% fewer clones were isolated, and they exhibited growth rates of 50% compared with empty vector transfectants (not shown). Expression of the SUB mutant was confirmed by Western blot (Fig. 9). Comparable amounts of each protein were present in both cell lines. No Myc-tagged proteins were detected in cells expressing empty vector. Growth assays were performed in NIH-OVCAR-3 cells that expressed various constructs. In each case, pools of clones (∼100 clones) were used, so changes in growth characteristics could not be attributed to clonal effects. As expected, the FL IP6K2-expressing cell line displayed enhanced suppression of growth in response to IFN-β (Fig.10). The SUB mutant was resistant to antiproliferative effects of IFN-β. SUB cells were inhibited only 45% by 100 units/ml IFN-β compared with empty vector cells, which were inhibited 78%. At doses of IFN-β that killed vector cells (500–1000 units/ml) SUB cells still grew, albeit slowly. As expected, cells that expressed IP6K2 mRNA in antisense orientation (ANTI) were most resistant to IFN-β, displaying only 34% growth inhibition at 1000 units/ml, the highest dose tested (Fig. 10). Despite the near total suppression of IP6K enzymatic activity in ANTI cells (Fig. 8), their growth was still partially suppressed by IFN-β (Fig. 10), suggesting that additional factors may mediate the antiproliferative effects of IFN-β in these cells. Induction of apoptosis by IFN-β was measured using annexin V assays (Fig. 11 A). Cells overexpressing FL IP6K2 demonstrated the highest percentage of apoptosis following treatment with IFN-β (200 units/ml). Annexin V staining was ∼2-fold higher in FL cells (86.4%) compared with untransfected cells (41.3%) or vector-transfected cells (40.9%). Expression of FL IP6K2 did not induce apoptosis in the absence of IFN-β but rather sensitized cells to death induction by IFN-β. Importantly, SUB cells displayed decreased IFN-β-induced apoptosis (18%) when compared with vector cells, a reduction of 55%. Therefore, an intact IPBD is critical for induction of apoptosis. Finally, we examined whether ablation of IFN-β-induced apoptosis by the IPBD mutant was because of a decrease in enzymatic activity of IP6K. In vitro IP6 kinase assays were performed to detect these differences (Fig. 11 B). Total radioactivity incorporated into the PP-IP5 product was expressed as AUC. Cells that expressed FL IP6K2 had the highest enzymatic activity (235). Compared with FL cells, SUB cells had an ∼8-fold lower level of activity (30Togashi S. Takazawa K. Endo T. Erneux C. Onaya T. Biochem. J. 1997; 326: 221-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Thus, the SUB construct functioned as a dominant negative mutant. Antisense ANTI cells had the lowest level of activity (27Voglmaier S.M. Bembenek M.E. Kaplin A.I. Dorman G. Olszewski J.D. Prestwich G.D. Snyder S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 4305-4310Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar), which was 3-fold less than activity of vector cells (83). Thus, ablation of IP6K enzymatic activity correlated well with loss of growth suppression and blunted induction of apoptosis by IFN-β. These data confirm the role of IP6K2 as a mediator of growth inhibition and apoptosis in response to IFN-β treatment. IFN-β was the most potent inducer of cell death of the type I IFNs. IFN-γ did not cause death at comparable doses. These observations suggest that type I and type II IFNs employ distinct pathways to exert anti-tumor actions. The fact that IFN-β induced death independently of cell cycle arrest suggests that different gene products regulate growth arrest and apoptosis. Because NIH-OVCAR-3 cells lack functional p53 (28Yaginuma Y. Westphal H. Cancer Res. 1992; 52: 4196-4199PubMed Google Scholar, 29Ramet M. Castren K. Jarvinen K. Pekkala K. Turpeenniemi-Hujanen T. Soini Y. Paakko P. Vahakangas K. Carcinogenesis. 1995; 16: 2117-2124Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), it appears that IFN-β-induced apoptosis occurs via p53-independent mechanisms. Furthermore, because caspases are activated by a variety of death stimuli (fas, tumor necrosis factor, perforins, and many others) it is unclear what molecules modulate the core apoptosis machinery in response to IFN-β. To this end, we employed an antisense technical knockout strategy (22Deiss L.P. Kimchi A. Science. 1991; 252: 117-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar) and identified the RIDs. The library used was generated using mRNA isolated from untreated cells, as well as those treated with IFN-β. Thus, genes expressed in all stages of apoptosis were included in the library. Inactivation of Janus tyrosine kinases or signal-transducing activators of transcription cannot account for the observed protection, because expression of antisense inserts is driven by an IFN-stimulated promoter (22Deiss L.P. Kimchi A. Science. 1991; 252: 117-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Indeed, cDNAs corresponding to these signaling components have not been rescued in our studies (not shown). The RID-2 cDNA characterized in this study is identical to IP6K2. Because IFN-β enhances protein levels but not mRNA levels, it appears that a post-transcriptional regulatory mechanism controls IP6K2 expression. The protective effect of antisense IP6K2 was because of a down-regulation of IP6K2 protein and enzymatic activity. Similarly, expression of SUB also conferred resistance to IFN-β-induced apoptosis. Inositol PP include PP-IP5 (7 phosphates/inositol),bis-PP-IP4 (8 phosphates/inositol) (31Stephens L. Radenberg T. Thiel U. Vogel G. Khoo K.H. Dell A. Jackson T.R. Hawkins P.T. Mayr G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4009-4015Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), PP-IP4 (6 phosphates/inositol), and bis-PP-IP3 (7 phosphates/inositol) (32Saiardi A. Caffrey J.J. Snyder S.H. Shears S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24686-24692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). The specific functional roles of PP-IP5, bis-PP-IP4, and their precursor, IP6, are not clearly understood. IP6 was previously believed to be an inactive metabolite. Several laboratories have demonstrated that IP6 functions as a substrate in mammalian cells, yeast, and protozoa (23Saiardi A. Erdjument-Bromage H. Snowman A.M. Tempst P. Snyder S.H. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 1323-1326Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar, 31Stephens L. Radenberg T. Thiel U. Vogel G. Khoo K.H. Dell A. Jackson T.R. Hawkins P.T. Mayr G.W. J.

Chem. 1993; 268: 3850-3856Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) to generate a family of high energy pyrophosphates. IP6 is phosphorylated to yield PP-IP5, which in mammalian cells is subsequently phosphorylated by a second kinase to yield bis-PP-IP4 (34Huang C.F. Voglmaier S.M. Bembenek M.E. Saiardi A. Snyder S.H. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 14998-15004Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The fact that basal IP6 concentration in cells is relatively high and that IP6 functions as a substrate in synthesis of small pools of high energy pyrophosphates of short half-life (35Shears S.B. Ali N. Craxton A. Bembenek M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10489-10497Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) suggests that these pyrophosphates play an important regulatory role. IP6 is not the only substrate for IP6K1 and IP6K2. Both IP6Ks can also phosphorylate IP5 to yield PP-IP4 (32Saiardi A. Caffrey J.J. Snyder S.H. Shears S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24686-24692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Because PEI-TLC could not clearly resolve PP-IP5 and PP-IP4, it is possible the latter compound may also contribute to growth inhibition and apoptosis. The inositol pyrophosphates do not appear to play a role in the metabolism of membrane-associated inositol phospholipids (phosphoinositides), responsible for Ca2+ release and protein kinase C activation. Links between phospholipid metabolism and cell growth regulation have recently been identified. The type 3 inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor actively participates in apoptosis during differentiation (36Blackshaw S. Sawa A. Sharp A.H. Ross C.A. Snyder S.H. Khan A.A. FASEB J. 2000; 14: 1375-1379Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In these studies, reduction of type 3 inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor expression by antisense oligonucleotides selectively blocked apoptosis. Inositol polyphosphate 4-phosphatase mediates hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol 3,4-bisphosphate. Overexpression of this enzyme markedly reduces growth of NIH3T3 fibroblasts (37Vyas P. Norris F.A. Joseph R. Majerus P.W. Orkin S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 13696-13701Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Our studies implicate inositol pyrophosphates as regulators of IFN-β-induced apoptosis. IP6K1 and IP6K2 have recently been cloned (23Saiardi A. Erdjument-Bromage H. Snowman A.M. Tempst P. Snyder S.H. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 1323-1326Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). Although biochemically and genetically distinct from IP6K2, IP6K1 may also play a role in growth regulation. Expression of the IP6K2 dominant negative SUB mutant abrogated only ∼50% of growth inhibition and apoptosis induced by IFN-β. ANTI cells and SUB cells both demonstrated an ∼70% inhibition of IP6K enzymatic activity. Yet ANTI cells were more resistant than SUB cells to IFN-β-mediated growth inhibition, suggesting that additional, IP6K2-independent pathways may be inhibited in the ANTI cells. It remains to be determined whether blockade of both IP6K1 and IP6K2 function further increases the IFN-β resistance of these cells."

Recombinant forms of these tryptases were generated for the first time to evaluate their substrate specificities at the biochemical level and then to address their physiologic roles in pulmonary inflammation. Analysis of a tryptase-specific, phage display peptide library revealed that tryptase βI prefers to cleave peptides with 1 or more Pro residues flanked by 2 positively charged residues. Although recombinant tryptase βI was unable to activate cultured cells that express different types of protease-activated receptors, the numbers of neutrophils increased >100-fold when enzymatically active tryptase βI was instilled into the lungs of mice. In contrast, the numbers of lymphocytes and eosinophils in the airspaces did not change significantly. More important, the tryptase βI-treated mice exhibited normal airway responsiveness.

Although the primary function(s) of each human tryptase remains to be determined, it is apparent that the individual mouse tryptases are metabolized differently during Fcε receptor I-mediated inflammatory reactions (24Ghildyal N.

In 1996, two groups (1Echtenacher B. Männel D.N. Hültner L. Nature. 1996; 381: 75-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (802) Google Scholar, 2Malaviya R. Ikeda T. Ross E. Abraham S.N.

The cytokine tumor necrosis factor-α was reported to be the primary MC-derived factor in this innate immunologic response. Nevertheless, it quickly became apparent that other undefined factors that are more restricted to MCs had to be involved because many cell types produce tumor necrosis factor-α, because immunologically activated MCs produce substantial amounts of tumor necrosis factor-α for only a brief period of time (28Burd P.R. Rogers H.W. Gordon J.R. Martin C.A. Jayaraman S. Wilson S.D. Dvorak A.M. Galli S.J. Dorf M.E. J. Exp. Med. 1989; 170: 245-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar, 29Plaut M. Pierce J.H.

The MCs in the peritoneal cavity store substantial amounts of the tryptase mMCP-6 in their secretory granules (13Reynolds D.S. Stevens R.L. Lane W.S. Carr M.H. Austen K.F. Serafin W.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 3230-3234Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). In 1998, we reported that large numbers of neutrophils are preferentially recruited into the peritoneal cavities of mice given a single dose of ∼0.2 nmol of insect cell-derived, recombinant mMCP-6 (26Huang C. Friend D.S. Qiu W.T. Wong G.W. Morales G. Hunt J. Stevens R.L. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 1910-1919PubMed Google Scholar). Hallgren et al. (32Hallgren J. Karlson U. Poorafshar M. Hellman L. Pejler G. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 13068-13077Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) reported similar findings recently with recombinant mMCP-6 generated in the human kidney cell line 293-EBNA. No factor has been found to be as selective, potent, and long lasting as mMCP-6 in terms of its ability to induce neutrophil influx into the peritoneal cavities of mice. The primary function of neutrophils is to kill bacteria. Although not proven experimentally, the finding that mMCP-6 regulates neutrophil recruitment in vivo implies that this tryptase participates in the early stages of the body's global defense against bacteria. Using the mouse as an experimental model and using recombinant material, we now demonstrate that human tryptase βI also selectively recruits neutrophils into the lung. The ability of human tryptase βI to rescue the pulmonary antibacterial deficiency of MC-deficient mice in a manner that does not compromise airway reactivity documents for the first time the functional significance of the tryptase βI-mediated neutrophil extravasation. The human tryptases α and βI cDNAs were isolated by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction treatment of a commercial source of whole lung RNA derived from a single individual. Expression constructs were then prepared that encode pseudo-zymogen forms of these two tryptases that both have a 5-residue enterokinase-susceptible peptide between the natural propeptide and the mature portion of the enzyme and an 8-residue FLAG peptide attached to the C terminus. The resulting cDNAs were subcloned into the expression vector pVL1393, and the recombinant pseudo-zymogens were expressed in baculovirus-infected High Five® insect cells as previously described for human tryptase α, mMCP-6, and mMCP-7 (25Huang C. Wong G.W. Ghildyal N. Gurish M.F. Šali A. Matsumoto R. Qiu W.T. Stevens R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31885-31893Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 26Huang C.

After their purification, the mature forms of the two human tryptases were obtained by proteolytic removal of the bioengineered propeptides. The enzymatic activities of the resulting recombinant tryptases were monitored in preliminary studies with the chromogenic substrate tosyl-Gly-Pro-Lys-p-nitroanilide and by measuring the incorporation of [3H]diisopropyl fluorophosphate (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) into each activated enzyme (33Huang C.

As noted below, tryptase βI functions in a manner similar to mMCP-6 in the lung, but not in the peritoneal cavity. Therefore, a phage display peptide library screening approach (25Huang C. Wong G.W.

Qiu W.T. Wong G.W. Morales G. Hunt J. Stevens R.L. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 1910-1919PubMed Google Scholar) was used to more precisely define the substrate specificity of recombinant human tryptase βI when it is bound to heparin glycosaminoglycan as a homotypic tetramer. A new library was created with the approach we previously described (25Huang C. Wong G.W. Ghildyal N. Gurish M.F. Šali A. Matsumoto R. Qiu W.T. Stevens R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31885-31893Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) to evaluate the substrate specificities of recombinant mMCP-6 and mMCP-7. Each phage in the library has a modified pIII protein on its surface that contains at its N terminus the FLAG peptide followed by an 8-residue hypervariable peptide. To make the library more tryptase-specific, the fifth residue in the bait peptide was fixed as either Lys or Arg. The FLAG peptide was again selected as the tether ligand so that those phage that contained the bioengineered pIII protein could be isolated readily with an immunoaffinity column containing anti-FLAG M1 antibody. After five rounds of screening,Escherichia coli bacteria were infected with the resulting tryptase βI-susceptible phage to generate phagemids. DNA were isolated from 22 arbitrarily selected clones. A polymerase chain reaction/sequencing approach was then used to determine the nucleotide sequence that encodes the 8-mer tryptase βI-susceptible peptide domain in each pIII fusion protein. Samples of conditioned medium from insect cells infected with the relevant baculovirus construct or the protein purified from the affinity column were diluted in SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis buffer (1% SDS, 5% β-mercaptoethanol, 0.1% bromphenol blue, and 500 mmTris-HCl, pH 6.8) and boiled for 5 min before being loaded onto a 12% polyacrylamide gel. After electrophoresis, the gels were stained with Coomassie Blue or were placed in a Bio-Rad immunoblotting apparatus. The resolved proteins were transferred to an Immobilon-P membrane, and the protein blots were probed with affinity-purified mouse anti-FLAG M2 antibody, as previously described for other recombinant tryptases (25Huang C. Wong G.W. Ghildyal N. Gurish M.F. Šali A. Matsumoto R. Qiu W.T. Stevens R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31885-31893Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). For N-terminal amino acid analysis, SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis protein blots were briefly stained with Ponceau S red (Sigma). The visualized protein bands were isolated and then subjected to automated Edman degradation. Samples (100 µl each) of purified recombinant mMCP-6, mMCP-7, human tryptase α, or human tryptase βI (∼2000 units, corresponding to ∼50 µg of protein or ∼1 nmol of active enzyme) or their inactive pseudo-zymogens (50 µg of protein) bound to heparin (∼10:1 (w/w) tryptase/heparin) were injected separately into the peritoneal cavities of BALB/c mice, C57BL/6 mice, or transgenic mice unable to express an interleukin (IL)-8 receptor homolog (34Cacalano G. Lee J. Kikly K. Ryan A.M. Pitts-Meek S. Hultgren B. Wood W.I. Moore M.W. Science. 1994; 265: 682-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar) (Jackson Laboratories, Bar Harbor, ME). The commercial heparin used in this study had been subjected to an additional CsCl density gradient centrifugation purification step (26Huang C. Friend D.S. Qiu W.T. Wong G.W. Morales G. Hunt J. Stevens R.L. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 1910-1919PubMed Google Scholar) to denature and remove any trace protein and lipid contaminants that might be present in Sigma's preparation of this glycosaminoglycan. 24–48 h after tryptase treatment, the mice were killed by CO2asphyxiation, and 10 ml of Tyrode's buffer containing 0.1% (w/v) gelatin was injected into the peritoneal cavity of each mouse. The injected fluid was aspirated; the cells in the peritoneal lavage fluid were counted with a hemocytometer; and 100-µl samples of the fluid were centrifuged for 5 min at 28 × g onto glass slides. The slides were stained with Diff-Quik® (Dade Behring, Newark, DE). For the instillation of a recombinant tryptase or vehicle control into the lungs, mice were anesthetized with an intramuscular injection of ketamine hydrochloride (40–60 mg/kg) and xylazine (5–10 mg/kg) (35De Sanctis G.T.

When an acceptable stage of anesthesia was achieved, the area was disinfected with an iodine-based antiseptic, and a midline incision of the neck was performed to expose the trachea. A 50-µl bolus of phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.2 nmol of either control (tryptase zymogen) or active mature tryptase was instilled into the trachea with a 100-µl Hamilton syringe. The margins of the incision were then closed with surgical clips. Mice used as negative controls received intratracheal instillations of buffer alone or buffer containing protryptase βI bound to heparin glycosaminoglycan. 24–48 h after administration of the relevant mouse or human tryptase, each mouse was anesthetized, and its trachea was cannulated. After the mouse was killed by exsanguination, its lungs were lavaged with 2 ml of phosphate-buffered saline. Each lung was fixed with paraformaldehyde, embedded in paraffin, and sectioned. The resulting sections and cytospins of the bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluids were evaluated histochemically for their granulocytes and lymphocytes. To ensure that the instilled liquid bolus would distribute itself relatively evenly throughout the lung, a control experiment was carried out in which 50 µl of a 0.4% solution of trypan blue was injected into the trachea of a mouse. Analysis of tissue sections revealed that the dye was distributed throughout the lungs. The airway responsiveness of tryptase-treated mice was measured as previously described (35De Sanctis G.T.

Methacholine dose-response curves were obtained by intravenous administration of sequentially increasing doses of methacholine (33–1000 µg/kg) in 20–35-µl volumes. Each dose-response curve was log-transformed and then subjected to regression analysis to interpolate the dose required for a 2-fold increase in lung resistance (R L) (log ED200 R L). This dose, referred to as the effective dose required to increase R Lto 200% of control values (ED200 R L), was used as an index of airway responsiveness. MC-deficient W/W v and MC-sufficient C57BL/6 mice (Jackson Laboratories) were also used to study the antimicrobial effects of human tryptase βI in the lungs. Mice were anesthetized by intramuscular injection of ketamine hydrochloride (100 mg/kg) and acepromazine maleate (5 mg/kg); the trachea was surgically exposed; a catheter was inserted through the trachea into the left bronchus; and a mixture containing 25 µl of a tryptase preparation (∼10 µg of either inactive proenzyme or active enzyme) and 25 µl of sterile saline was instilled. A second instillation, 24 h after the first, contained 25 µl of the same enzyme preparation and 25 µl of K. pneumoniae (strain KP1415) suspended in sterile saline at a density of 4.8 × 108 colony-forming units/ml. This bacterial strain was specifically chosen because it had been used in a previous study by others to evaluate the role of MCs in innate immunity (2Malaviya R. Ikeda T. Ross E. Abraham S.N. Nature. 1996; 381: 77-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (970) Google Scholar). Control studies demonstrated that none of the tryptase preparations, at the doses used in the in vivobacterial infection studies, directly affected the viability of KP1415 bacteria in vitro. 6 h after the bacteria were instilled, the mice were killed by a lethal overdose of halothane anesthesia. The lungs were excised, homogenized, serially diluted, and plated on 5% sheep blood agar. After an overnight incubation, colonies were counted, and the resulting viable bacteria were expressed as colony-forming units/lung. Cells that differ in their expression of the four known PARs were used to determine whether or not recombinant human tryptase βI can activate cells via one of these surface receptors. HEK-293 human kidney fibroblasts express the transcripts that encode PAR1, PAR2, and PAR3, but not PAR4 (37Kawabata A. Kuroda R. Minami T. Kataoka K. Taneda M. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1998; 125: 419-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). These cells also are responsive to PAR1 and PAR2 peptide agonists (38Hollenberg M.D. Saifeddine M. Al Ani B. Gui Y. Can. J. Physiol. Pharmacol. 1999; 77: 458-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). HEK-293T cells are derivatives of HEK-293 cells and have been induced to express the simian virus 40 large tumor antigen (39DuBridge R.B. Tang P. Hsia H.C. Leong P.M. Miller J.H. Calos M.P. Mol.

These cells were chosen for study because fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis revealed that HEK-293T cells express more PAR2 on their surface than do the parent cells. HEK-293T cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 µg/ml streptomycin.

For determination of the agonist-mediated changes in the cytosolic levels of Ca2+ in HEK-293T cells, nearly confluent cultures were loaded with 5 µm Fura-2/AM (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR) in complete medium for 1 h. The labeled cells were released from the culture dishes in a non-proteolytic manner with 1 mm EDTA in phosphate-buffered saline. The detached cells were washed, resuspended in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, incubated for 15 min, washed again, and resuspended at a density of 1 × 106 cells/ml in RPMI 1640 medium lacking phenol red. The level of cytosolic Ca2+ in Dami cells was quantitated as described for HEL cells (44Brass L.F. Manning D.R. Williams A.G. Woolkalis M.J. Poncz M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 958-965Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).

Reagents were added serially to the cuvette in those experiments in which cells were sequentially treated with multiple agonists and/or antagonists.

Calcium was measured with prewarmed reagents, and incubations were carried out at 37 °C. Recombinant pseudo-zymogen forms of human tryptases α and βI were expressed in insect cells and activated by enterokinase after their purification. Recombinant protryptase α (data not shown) and protryptase βI (Fig.1 a) were both secreted into the conditioned medium as properly folded monomers on the basis of their ability to bind to heparin-Sepharose in a conformation-dependent manner (46Matsumoto R.

The fact that both secreted proteins possess an N-terminal amino acid sequence of Ala-Pro-Gly-Gln-Ala-Leu-Gln indicated that the natural hydrophobic signal peptides of the two human tryptase pseudo-zymogens were properly removed by the insect cells.

Here we employed site-directed mutagenesis and biochemical methods to dissect the domain structure of the homotetrameric T4 Pnk protein and to localize essential constituents of the apparently separate active sites for the 5′-kinase and 3′-phosphatase activities. We characterized deletion mutants Pnk(42–301) and Pnk(1–181), which correspond to domains defined by proteolysis with chymotrypsin.

Four classes of missense mutational effects were observed. (i) Mutations K15A, S16A, and D35A inactivated the 5′-kinase but did not affect the 3′-phosphatase or the tetrameric quaternary structure of T4 Pnk. 5′-kinase activity was ablated by the conservative mutations K15R, K15Q, and D35N; however, kinase activity was restored by the S16T change. (ii) Mutation D167A inactivated the 3′-phosphatase without affecting the 5′-kinase or tetramerization. (iii) Mutation D85A caused a severe decrement in 5′-kinase activity and only a modest effect on the 3′-phosphatase; the nearby N87A mutation resulted in a significantly reduced 3′-phosphatase activity and slightly reduced 5′-kinase activity. D85A and N87A both affected the quaternary structure, resulting in a mixed population of tetramer and dimer species.

(i) Mutations K15A, S16A, and D35A inactivated the 5′-kinase but did not affect the 3′-phosphatase or the tetrameric quaternary structure of T4 Pnk. 5′-kinase activity was ablated by the conservative mutations K15R, K15Q, and D35N; however, kinase activity was restored by the S16T change. (ii) Mutation D167A inactivated the 3′-phosphatase without affecting the 5′-kinase or tetramerization. (iii) Mutation D85A caused a severe decrement in 5′-kinase activity and only a modest effect on the 3′-phosphatase; the nearby N87A mutation resulted in a significantly reduced 3′-phosphatase activity and slightly reduced 5′-kinase activity. D85A and N87A both affected the quaternary structure, resulting in a mixed population of tetramer and dimer species. (iv) Alanine mutations at 11 other conserved positions had no significant effect on either 5′-kinase or 3′-phosphatase activity. polynucleotide kinase polymerase chain reaction isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis bovine serum albumin Polynucleotide kinase (Pnk)1 was discovered 35 years ago in extracts of Escherichia coli infected with T-even bacteriophage (1Richardson C.C.

Pnk catalyzes the transfer of the γ phosphate from ATP or other nucleoside triphosphates to the 5′-OH terminus of DNA or RNA to form a 5′-monophosphate polynucleotide and a nucleoside diphosphate; the enzyme also phosphorylates the 5′-OH of nucleoside 3′-monophosphates (1Richardson C.C.

The use of T4 Pnk to label 5′-DNA or RNA ends with 32P was instrumental in the subsequent identification of DNA and RNA ligases and in the development of methods for the analysis of nucleic acid structure, molecular cloning, and nucleic acid sequencing. Early biochemical studies showed that the kinase reaction is reversible (4van de Sande J.H. Kleppe K. Khorana H.G. Biochemistry. 1973; 12: 5050-5055Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Although it was initially proposed that T4 Pnk acts via a ping-pong mechanism with a phosphoenzyme intermediate (4van de Sande J.H. Kleppe K. Khorana H.G. Biochemistry. 1973; 12: 5050-5055Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), kinetic analysis favors a sequential mechanism in which both ATP and the 5′-OH polynucleotide bind the enzyme prior to dissociation of either product (5Lillehaug J.R. Kleppe K. Biochemistry. 1975; 14: 1221-1225Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The stereochemical course of the reaction entails inversion of configuration of the transferred phosphate, indicative of an in-line mechanism in which the polynucleotide 5′-OH directly attacks the γ phosphorus of ATP (6Jarvest R.L. Lowe G. Biochem. J. 1981; 199: 273-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). T4 Pnk is a bifunctional enzyme with an intrinsic 3′-phosphomonoesterase activity that removes 3′-PO4 termini from DNA or RNA polynucleotides (7Becker A. Hurwitz J. J. Biol. Chem. 1967; 242: 936-950Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Cameron V. Uhlenbeck O.C. Biochemistry. 1977; 16: 5120-5126Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). The kinase and phosphatase active sites are apparently distinct insofar as: (i) the kinase and phosphatase functions have widely divergent pH optima; (ii) the activities are differentially sensitive to the protein-modifying agents diethyl pyrocarbonate, which inactivates the kinase, andN-ethylmaleimide, which inactivates the phosphatase; (iii) the activities are differentially sensitive to digestion of the enzyme with trypsin, which inactivates the kinase, and carboxypeptidase, which inactivates the phosphatase; and (iv) a mutant T4 allele (pseT-1) encodes an enzyme that has normal polynucleotide kinase activity but no 3′-phosphatase activity (8Cameron V. Uhlenbeck O.C. Biochemistry. 1977; 16: 5120-5126Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar, 9Soltis D.A. Uhlenbeck O.C. J. Biol.

Pnk purified from T4-infected bacteria is reported to be either a homotetramer (8Cameron V. Uhlenbeck O.C. Biochemistry. 1977; 16: 5120-5126Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar, 12Panet A. van de Sande J.H. Loewen P.C. Khorana H.G. Raae A.J. Lillehaug J.R. Kleppe K.

Chem. 1982; 257: 11332-11339Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) of a 33–35-kDa polypeptide. Gene cloning and sequencing revealed that the T4 kinase/phosphatase is a 301-amino acid polypeptide with a predicted size of 34 kDa (11Midgley C.A. Murray N.E. EMBO J. 1985; 4: 2695-2703Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The amino acid sequence of T4 Pnk is remarkable for the presence of a nucleotide-binding motif (a Walker A box) near the N terminus and N-terminal sequence similarity to adenylate kinase. There have been no reported efforts to finely map the active sites of this historically important enzyme or to elucidate its structure during the many years since its gene was cloned. As a bifunctional enzyme with a complex quaternary structure and a fascinating biological role in the repair of “broken” RNA molecules (13Amitsur M. Levitz R. Kaufman G. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 2499-2503Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar), T4 kinase is ripe for structure-function investigation. Here we present: (i) a mutational analysis that identifies individual amino acid side chains essential for the 5′-kinase and 3′-phosphatase activities; (ii) low-resolution dissection of structural domains by limited proteolysis and peptide sequencing; (iii) the identification of functional domains based on the proteolytic map; and (iv) the delineation of protein segments that contribute to a tetrameric quaternary structure. Oligodeoxynucleotide primers complementary to the 5′- and 3′-ends of the Pnk gene were used to PCR amplify the open reading frame from T4 genomic DNA (a gift of Dr. Ken Kreuzer, Duke University). The primers were designed to introduce NdeI and BamHI restriction sites at the 5′- and 3′-ends of the gene. The PCR product was digested with NdeI and BamHI and then cloned into the NdeI and BamHI sites of the bacterial expression plasmid pET16b (Novagen) to yield pET-PNK. Dideoxy sequencing of the entire insert of pET-PNK confirmed that no alterations of the genomic T4 DNA sequence were introduced during PCR amplification and cloning of the kinase gene. Missense mutations were introduced into the Pnk gene by using the two-stage PCR-based overlap extension method (14Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene. 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6833) Google Scholar). pET-PNKwas used as the template for the first stage PCR reaction.NdeI-BamHI restriction fragments of the mutated second-stage PCR products were inserted into pET16b. The inserts of the resulting plasmids were sequenced to confirm the presence of the desired mutations and the absence of any unwanted coding changes. An N-terminal deletion mutant, Pnk(42–301), was constructed by PCR amplification of the PNK gene with a sense-strand primer that introduced an NdeI restriction site at Met42. A C-terminal deletion mutant, Pnk(1–181), was constructed by PCR amplification with an antisense-strand primer that introduced a stop codon in lieu of the codon for Glu182 and aBamHI site immediately 3′ of the stop codon.NdeI-BamHI restriction fragments containing the truncated genes were inserted into pET16b. The resulting pET-PNKΔN and pET-PNKΔC plasmids were sequenced to exclude the introduction of any unwanted coding changes during amplification and cloning. The wild-type and mutant pET-PNK plasmids were transformed into E. coli BL21(DE3). Single ampicillin-resistant colonies were inoculated into LB medium containing 0.1 mg/ml ampicillin, and 50-ml cultures were grown at 37 °C until the A 600reached 0.5. The cultures were placed on ice for 30 min, then adjusted to 0.3 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG), and subsequently incubated at 17 °C for 15 h with continuous shaking. Cells were harvested by centrifugation, and the pellets were stored at −80 °C. All subsequent procedures were performed at 4 °C. Cell lysis was achieved by treatment of thawed, resuspended cells with 1 mg/ml lysozyme and 0.1% Triton X-100 in 5 ml of lysis buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 1.2m NaCl, 15 mm imidazole, 10% glycerol, 1 mm benzamidine, and 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The lysates were sonicated to reduce viscosity, and insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 40,000 × g for 20 min. The supernatants were applied to 1-ml columns of Ni-NTA-agarose (Qiagen). The columns were washed with 5 ml of lysis buffer and then with 2 ml of buffer A (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 200 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol) containing 0.1m imidazole. The columns were step-eluted with 0.3, 0.5, and 1.3 m imidazole in buffer A. The polypeptide compositions of the column fractions were monitored by SDS-PAGE. The peak fractions containing the Pnk polypeptide were pooled and stored at −80 °C. The protein concentrations were determined by using the Bio-Rad dye reagent with bovine serum albumin as the standard. Reaction mixtures (10 µl) containing 70 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 10 mm MgCl2, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 25 µm[γ-32P]ATP, ∼50 pmol of a synthetic 5′-OH DNA oligonucleotide d(ATTCCGATAGTGACTACA), and Pnk as specified were incubated for 20 min at 37 °C. The reactions were quenched by adding 6 µl of stop solution (95% formamide, 20 mm EDTA, 0.05% bromphenol blue, 0.05% xylene cyanol). The mixtures were analyzed by electrophoresis through a 15-cm 15% polyacrylamide gel containing 7m urea in TBE (90 mm Tris borate, 2.5 mm EDTA). The radiolabeled oligonucleotide products were visualized and quantitated by scanning the gel with a Fujix BAS2500 phosphorimaging device. 3′-Phosphatase activity was measured by the conversion of a 5′-32P-labeled, 3′-PO4 DNA oligonucleotide d(pATTCCGATAGTGACTACAp) to a 3′-OH derivative. The substrate was prepared by enzymatic phosphorylation of the 5′-OH, 3′-PO4 strand d(ATTCCGATAGTGACTACAp) in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP and the 3′-phosphatase-defective deletion mutant Pnk(1–181). The 5′-32P-labeled, 3′-PO4 oligonucleotide was purified by electrophoresis through a 20% native polyacrylamide gel and recovered by electroelution from an excised gel slice into 0.5 ml of 0.2× TBE. 3′-Phosphatase reaction mixtures (10 µl) containing 100 mm imidazole (pH 6.0), 10 mm MgCl2, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 0.1 mg/ml BSA, 1 pmol of 5′-32P-labeled 3′-PO4 oligonucleotide and Pnk as specified were incubated for 20 min at 37 °C. The reactions were quenched by adding 6 µl of stop solution, and the mixtures were analyzed by electrophoresis through a 40-cm 16% polyacrylamide gel containing 7 m urea in TBE. The radiolabeled 3′-OH-containing product, which migrated more slowly than the 3′-PO4-containing substrate oligonucleotide, was quantitated by scanning the gel with a phosphorimaging device. Aliquots (40 µg) of the wild-type and mutant Pnk preparations were mixed with catalase (30 µg), BSA (30 µg), and cytochrome c (30 µg), and the mixtures were applied to 4.8-ml 15–30% glycerol gradients containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 0.2 m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 2.5 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.1% Triton X-100. The gradients were centrifuged in a SW50 rotor at 50,000 rpm for 14 h at 4 °C. Finer sedimentation analysis of the Pnk deletion mutants was performed by mixing Pnk(42–301) or Pnk(1–181) (40 µg) with BSA (30 µg), ovalbumin (30 µg), and cytochromec (30 µg) and centrifuging the mixtures through 4.8-ml 15–30% glycerol gradients in a SW50 rotor at 50,000 rpm for 24 h at 4 °C. Fractions were collected from the bottoms of the tubes. Aliquots (20 µl) of odd-numbered gradient fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. A goal of the present study was to map the active site of the 5′-OH polynucleotide kinase by identifying individual amino acid functional groups required for the kinase reaction. To do this, we introduced single alanine changes at 17 amino acids in the Pnk polypeptide that are conserved in its closest homologue, a putative polynucleotide kinase/ligase encoded by theAutographa californica nuclear polyhedrosis virus (15Durantel D. Croizier L. Ayres M.D. Croizier G. Possee R.D. Lopez-Ferber M. J. Gen. Virol. 1998; 79: 629-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The mutated positions are highlighted by asterisks in Fig.1. We focused in particular on the A box motif GXXGXGKS near the N terminus of T4 Pnk, which is present in many NTP-dependent phosphohydrolases and phosphotransferases. The core A box, as well as multiple vicinal residues, are identical in the T4 and baculovirus proteins (Fig. 1). The genes encoding wild-type Pnk and the 17 Pnk-Ala mutants were cloned into a T7 RNA polymerase-based bacterial expression vector so as to fuse the 301-amino acid Pnk to an N-terminal leader peptide containing 10 tandem histidines. The expression plasmids were introduced intoE. coli BL21(DE3), a strain that contains the T7 RNA polymerase gene under the control of a lacUV5 promoter. A prominent ∼35-kDa polypeptide was detectable by SDS-PAGE in whole-cell extracts of IPTG-induced bacteria (not shown). (The calculated size of the His-Pnk polypeptide is 37 kDa.) This polypeptide was not present when bacteria containing the pET vector alone were induced with IPTG. After centrifugal separation of the crude lysate, the Pnk protein was recovered in the soluble supernatant fraction. The His tag facilitated rapid purification of recombinant Pnk by adsorption to an immobilized nickel resin and subsequent elution with buffer containing imidazole. SDS-PAGE analysis of the imidazole eluate fractions showed that the wild-type Pnk and the 17 Pnk-Ala mutants preparation were highly enriched with respect to the His-Pnk polypeptide (Fig. 2 A). The identity of the His-Pnk protein was confirmed by N-terminal sequence analysis (see below). 5′-Kinase activity was measured by label transfer from [γ-32P]ATP to a 5′-OH DNA oligonucleotide. All of the enzyme preparations were assayed in parallel; the kinase reaction mixtures contained 80 ng of input Pnk, an amount sufficient for saturating levels of DNA-labeling by the wild-type enzyme (see Fig.8 B). Conducting the screening assays in this fashion highlighted the most severe mutational effects on catalysis (Fig.2 B). Four mutants were grossly defective in catalysis: K15A, S16A, D35A, and D85A. Two of the essential residues, Lys15and Ser16, are constituents of the A box. One mutation, N87A, elicited a partial loss of function. The other twelve mutant proteins retained 5′-kinase activity: G12A, S13A, G14A, T17A, W18A, R20A, N33A, R34A, T86A, D167A, G168A, and T169A (Fig. 2 B). We surmise that none of these 12 side chains contributes significantly to catalysis of the kinase reaction. The native sizes of the wild-type Pnk and the catalytically defective mutants were investigated by sedimentation through 15–30% glycerol gradients. Marker proteins catalase, BSA, and cytochrome c were included as internal standards. After centrifugation, the polypeptide compositions of the odd-numbered gradient fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE (Fig.3). The 37-kDa wild-type Pnk polypeptide sedimented as a discrete peak between catalase (248 kDa) and BSA (66 kDa), consistent with a globular tetrameric quaternary structure for Pnk as reported previously (8Cameron V. Uhlenbeck O.C. Biochemistry. 1977; 16: 5120-5126Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar, 12Panet A. van de Sande J.H. Loewen P.C. Khorana H.G. Raae A.J. Lillehaug J.R. Kleppe K. Biochemistry. 1973; 12: 5045-5050Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). The catalytically defective K15A, S16A, and D35A proteins sedimented similarly, indicating that the 5′-kinase-inactivating mutations did not grossly affect the quaternary structure of Pnk. We infer that the Lys15, Ser16, and Asp35 side chains are essential constituents of the 5′-kinase active site. The D85A mutation, on the other hand, resulted in a subtle, reproducible alteration in the sedimentation profile, whereby the major component of the D85A protein sedimented less rapidly than wild-type Pnk, at a position closer to the BSA standard, and a minor component of D85A cosedimented with BSA (Fig.4 A). A simple interpretation of the sedimentation profile is that the leading D85A component is an asymmetric tetramer and the lagging component is a dimer. This result implicates Asp85 in subunit-subunit interactions (directly or indirectly) and suggests a more complex interpretation of the deleterious effects of D85A on 5′-kinase activity. Conservative substitutions were introduced at each of the four residues that were defined by alanine scanning as essential for 5′-kinase function in vitro. The seven recombinant proteins, K15R, K15Q, S16T, D35N, D35E, D85N, and D85E, were purified from soluble bacterial extracts by nickel-agarose chromatography (Fig.5 A). Replacement of the A box lysine (Lys15) by either glutamine or arginine did not restore 5′-kinase activity (Fig. 5 B). These data establish a clear requirement for a positively charged residue, and lysine specifically, at this critical position of T4 Pnk. 5′-kinase activity was restored fully when the A box serine (Ser16) was replaced by threonine. Hence, the hydroxyl moiety is critical for the function of this residue in Pnk. Replacement of Asp35 by asparagine was as deleterious to the 5′-kinase activity as the D35A mutation. A low level of activity was restored by the D35E mutation (Fig. 5 B). An acidic side chain at position 35 is evidently essential for catalysis, and there appears to be a steric constraint that precludes full function of the larger glutamate side chain. Strikingly different structure-function relationships were seen at Asp85 where introduction of asparagine restored 5′-kinase activity, whereas a glutamate did not (Fig. 5 B). We surmise that: (i) the acidic carboxylate at position 85 is not critical for 5′-kinase activity; (ii) sufficiency of the amide functional group implies an important hydrogen-bonding interaction; and (iii) there is a steric constraint that hinders the function of glutamate in lieu of aspartate. 3′-Phosphatase activity was measured by conversion of a 5′-32P-labeled oligonucleotide containing a 3′-PO4 into a 5′-32P-labeled 3′-OH-terminated product. The wild-type Pnk and all 17 Pnk-Ala mutants were assayed in parallel; the 3′-phosphatase reaction mixtures contained 2 ng of input Pnk, an amount sufficient for saturating levels of dephosphorylation by the wild-type enzyme (see Fig. 8 C). The D167A mutation elicited the most severe mutational effect on 3′-phosphatase function (Fig. 6). Glycerol gradient analysis showed that the D167A mutant sedimented as a tetramer (Fig. 3). Because the D167A mutation did not affect 5′-kinase function or protein quaternary structure, we construe that Asp167 is a specific constituent of the 3′-phosphatase active site. Fourteen of the alanine mutants retained 3′-phosphatase activity: G12A, S13A, G14A, K15A, S16A, T17A, W18A, R20A, N33A, R34A, D35A, T86A, G168A, and T169A (Fig. 6). It was especially instructive that K15A, S16A, and D35A, which were defective in 5′-kinase activity, were catalytically competent in 3′ dephosphorylation. These data provide strong evidence that the 5′-kinase and 3′-phosphatase active sites are distinct, and they show that the amino acid side chains in and around the A box play no significant role in the 3′-phosphatase reaction. The N87A mutation resulted in a significant reduction in 3′-phosphatase activity (Fig. 6); this mutation also caused a modest reduction in 5′-kinase activity (Fig. 2 B). The nearby D85A mutation, which caused a severe decrement in 5′-kinase activity, had only a modest effect on the 3′-phosphatase (Fig. 6). Glycerol gradient sedimentation of N87A showed two components: a heavier, presumptive tetrameric species sedimenting between catalase and BSA and a lighter species cosedimenting with BSA, which we presume is a dimer (Fig.4 B). The 5′-kinase activity profile of N87A across the glycerol gradient showed that catalytic activity was exclusive to the fraction corresponding to the tetrameric component (not shown). These results suggest several models to account for the effects of the D85A and N87A mutations: (i) the peptide segment85DXN87 may comprise a common component of the 5′-kinase and 3′-phosphatase active sites; (ii) Asp35 and Asn87 are not located at the active sites, and the mutational effects on 5′-kinase and 3′-phosphatase activity are manifestations of a key role for the85DXN87 peptide at the subunit-subunit interface. The N87A sedimentation results suggest that tetramer formation is important for the 5′-kinase activity (see below). The purified His-tagged Pnk was subjected to proteolysis with increasing amounts of chymotrypsin (Fig.7). N-terminal sequencing of the undigested Pnk polypeptide by automated Edman chemistry after transfer from an SDS-gel to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane confirmed that the N-terminal sequence started from the second residue of the His tag. Apparently, the Pnk suffered removal of the initiating methionine during expression in E. coli. Initial scission of the 37-kDa Pnk by chymotrypsin yielded four major products, C1, C2, C3, and C5 (Fig. 7 A, lane 10). N-terminal sequencing showed that the C1 species consisted of two polypeptides: one arising via chymotryptic cleavage between Tyr30 and Asn31and one generated by cleavage between Met42 and Ala43 (Fig. 7 B). The sites of proteolysis are demarcated by arrows above the Pnk sequence in Fig. 1. The C2 species was also composed of two polypeptides: one cleaved at Tyr50/Lys51 and one at Tyr52/Lys53 (Figs. 1 and 7 B). (The predicted N-terminal products of these cleavages were too small to detect in this gel-based assay.) The C3 species, which retained the His tag, and the C5 species, starting at Asp180, likely arose as the products of a single proteolytic cut at Tyr179/Asp180. High levels of chymotrypsin, in excess of the amount sufficient to cleave all the input Pnk, resulted in the decay of the C1, C2, and C3 species and the appearance of a major lower molecular weight cleavage product C4 (Fig.7 A). A scheme to account for the chymotryptic digestion pattern is shown in Fig. 7 B. The results suggest parallel pathways entailing alternative initial cleavages near the N terminus or else internally at Tyr179. The pathways converge after secondary cleavages of the major products C4 and C5. We surmise that the C4 and C5 fragments are themselves well folded insofar as they were resistant to digestion by concentrations of chymotrypsin sufficient to cleave all the input Pnk. In light of the proteolysis results, we engineered an N-terminal deletion mutant Pnk(42–301) and a C-terminal truncation Pnk(1–181), referred to henceforth as ΔN and ΔC, respectively. The ΔN protein, corresponding to proteolytic species C1, and ΔC protein, corresponding to proteolytic species C3, were produced in bacteria as N-terminal His10-fusions and purified from soluble lysates by nickel-agarose chromatography (Fig.8 A). The ΔN protein was inert with respect to 5′-kinase activity (Fig.8 B); this result was expected given that the A box essential for kinase function was encompassed within the deleted N-terminal peptide (Fig. 1). The ΔC protein retained 5′-kinase function; however, the specific activity was only 5% that of the full-length Pnk (Fig. 8 B). In addition, the dependence of 5′-kinase activity on ΔC concentration was conspicuously sigmoidal. The deletions elicited the converse effects on the 3′-phosphatase activity, i.e. ΔC was inert as a 3′-phosphatase, whereas ΔN retained 3′-phosphatase function, albeit with only 3% the specific activity of full-length Pnk (Fig. 8 C). These findings suggest that an essential constituent of the phosphatase active site is located within the C-terminal domain, Pnk(182–301). Analysis of ΔN and ΔC by glycerol gradient sedimentation under the conditions used for full-sized Pnk and the Pnk-Ala mutants indicated that both deletion variants sedimented as single components at positions between BSA and cytochrome c (not shown); the absence of a component sedimenting with or heavier than BSA suggested that neither ΔC nor ΔN retained the tetrameric quaternary structure characteristic of full-sized Pnk. To better gauge the native size of the truncated proteins, we sedimented them for a longer time in the presence of BSA (66 kDa), ovalbumin (45 kDa), and cytochromec (13 kDa) as internal standards (Fig.9). The ΔC polypeptide, with a calculated mass of 23 kDa, sedimented as a discrete peak between ovalbumin and cytochrome c, consistent with a monomeric native structure for the ΔC protein. In contrast, the ΔN polypeptide, with a calculated mass of 32 kDa, sedimented a discrete peak at a position between BSA and ovalbumin, which indicated that the ΔN protein is a homodimer (Fig. 9). We surmise that the C-terminal domain is essential for attaining any oligomeric structure of Pnk, whereas the N-terminal peptide is required specifically for the transition from dimer to tetramer. T4 Pnk is the founding member of a growing family of 5′-kinase/3′-phosphatase enzymes that heal broken termini in RNA or DNA by converting 3′-PO4/5′-OH ends into 3′-OH/5′-PO4 ends, which are then suitable for sealing by RNA or DNA ligases (13Amitsur M. Levitz R. Kaufman G. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 2499-2503Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar, 16Jilani A. Ramotar D. Slack C. Ong C. Yang X.M. Scherer S.W. Lasko D.D. J. Biol.

Here we have employed site-directed mutagenesis and biochemical methods to dissect the domain structure of T4 Pnk and to localize essential constituents of the apparently separate active sites for the 5′-kinase and 3′-phosphatase activities. Our results confirm and extend the early work of Soltis and Uhlenbeck (9Soltis D.A. Uhlenbeck O.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 11340-11345Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which implicated the N terminus of T4 Pnk in the 5′-kinase reaction and the C terminus in the 3′-phosphatase function. Our studies were performed using recombinant Pnk protein containing a short N-terminal polyhistidine tag. To determine whether the His tag affects the kinase activity or quaternary structure of T4 Pnk, we produced and purified recombinant Pnk protein containing an N-terminal His-Smt3 domain, then removed the His-Smt3 domain via digestion with Ulp1, a cysteine protease that hydrolyzes the polypeptide backbone exclusively at the junction of His-Smt3 with the downstream polypeptide (28Mossessova E. Lima C.D. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 865-876Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar). We then purified the untagged Pnk away from the His-Smt3 domain. Pnk lacking the tag sedimented in a glycerol gradient as a discrete tetrameric species and its 5′-kinase specific activity was equivalent to that of the wild-type His-Pnk enzyme used in the studies presented above (data not shown). Therefore, the His tag is unlikely to affect the structure-function relationships illuminated here. We find that the N terminus is required for the 5′-kinase activity of T4 Pnk because it contains the A box element that contributes two essential side chains (Lys15 and Ser16) to the kinase active site. Crystallographic studies of other A box proteins show that the invariant lysine makes direct contact with the β and γ phosphates of the bound nucleotide (18Pai E.F. Krengel U. Petsko G.A. Goody R.S. Kabsch W. Wittinghofer A. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 2351-2359Crossref PubMed Scopus (966) Google Scholar, 19Müller C.W. Schulz G.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 224: 159-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar). Our findings that the K15A, K15R, and K15Q mutations inactivate the 5′-kinase are in accord with mutational analyses of several other A box proteins in which the lysine cannot be functionally substituted by arginine (20Sung P. Higgins D. Prakash L. Prakash S. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 3263-3269Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar, 21Byeon L. Shi Z. Tsai M.D. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 3172-3182Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 22Martins A. Gross C.H. Shuman S. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 1302-1308Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The amino acid adjacent to the A box lysine is typically either threonine or serine (albeit not in adenylate kinase). In T4 Pnk, a threonine is fully active in lieu of Ser16, whereas the S16A mutant is catalytically defective. In p21Ha-rasbound to GMPPNP, the serine hydroxyl in the GKS element interacts with the β phosphate and with magnesium coordinated to the β and γ phosphates (18Pai E.F. Krengel U. Petsko G.A. Goody R.S. Kabsch W. Wittinghofer A. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 2351-2359Crossref PubMed Scopus (966) Google Scholar). Similar contacts are proposed for the GKT motif in the RecA-ADP cocrystal (23Story R.M. Steitz T.A. Nature. 1992; 355: 374-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (560) Google Scholar). The motif I threonine side chains of Rep and PcrA complexed with ADP are also poised near the β phosphate (24Korolev S. Hsieh J. Gauss G.H. Lohman T.M. Waksman G. Cell. 1997; 90: 635-647Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar,25Subramanya H.S. Bird L.E. Brannigan J.A. Wigley D.B. Nature. 1996; 384: 379-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar). We presume that Ser16 of Pnk engages in similar contacts with its NTP substrate. Asp35 of Pnk is located 20 amino acids downstream of the A box lysine and is critical for 5′-kinase activity. An aspartate is located at the equivalent position in adenylate kinase; this Asp coordinates a water that is in turn coordinated to the essential divalent cation cofactor (26Berry M.B. Phillips G.N. Proteins. 1998; 32: 276-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). The aspartate also forms a salt bridge to an essential arginine. Our mutational findings (Fig. 5) are consistent with similar roles for Asp35 in the 5′-kinase reaction of T4 Pnk, i.e.only a carboxylate can engage in both the hydrogen bond to water and the salt bridge. Although we did not explicitly target the C terminus and the 3′-phosphatase in the present round of alanine-scanning mutagenesis, we did identify Asp167 as an essential, and presumptively catalytic, constituent of the 3′-phosphatase domain. This aspartate is conserved in the baculovirus Pnk homolog (which has not been characterized biochemically) and in the human DNA 5′-kinase/3′-phosphatase and its homologs in Schizosaccharomyces pombe and Caenorhabditis elegans (16Jilani A.

Although it had been suggested based on sequence alignments that this aspartate resides within a putative phosphatase motif FDLDGTL (16Jilani A. Ramotar D. Slack C. Ong C. Yang X.M. Scherer S.W.

Chem. 1999; 274: 24187-24194Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar), the present study provides the first evidence that the aspartate is actually important for the polynucleotide 3′-phosphatase reaction. We also show that the vicinal residues Gly168 and Thr169 are not important for 3′-phosphatase activity of T4 Pnk even though they are conserved in other Pnk-like proteins. The mapping of protease-resistant Pnk fragments, presumably corresponding to folded structural domains of Pnk, led us to characterize recombinant Pnk truncations corresponding to the species generated during proteolysis. We thereby found that the carboxyl domain from 182–301 is essential for both Pnk oligomerization and 3′-phosphatase activity. The residual 5′-kinase activity of the Pnk(1–181) protein displayed a sigmoidal dependence on protein concentration, which would be in keeping with a model whereby the 5′-kinase reaction is performed by an active site composed of residues donated by more than one protomer of Pnk. It would appear that a tetrameric quaternary structure is also important for the 3′-phosphatase, insofar as the deletion of 41 amino acids from the N terminus converted the Pnk(42–301) domain from a tetramer into a homodimer and elicited a significant decrement in the 3′-phosphatase specific activity. Our initial efforts to determine whether the C-terminal domain Pnk(181–301) per se was capable of homodimerization were hampered by the insolubility of the Pnk(181–301) protein produced in bacteria. 2L. K. Wang, unpublished material. In summary, our findings suggest a complex functional organization of T4 Pnk in which the 5′-kinase and 3′-phosphatase sites are distinct, and full catalytic activity depends on a proper tetrameric quaternary structure. We anticipate that further rounds of mutational analysis of T4 Pnk, in tandem with efforts to crystallize the enzyme, will illuminate the phosphoryl transfer and phosphohydrolase reaction mechanisms."
https://openalex.org/W2172060363,Many developing and adult tissues are comprised of polarized epithelia. Proteins that are asymmetrically distributed in these cells are thought to be localized by protein trafficking. Here we show that the distribution and function of the signaling protein Wingless is predetermined by the subcellular localization of its mRNA. High-resolution in situ hybridization reveals apical transcript localization in the majority of tissues examined. This localization is mediated by two independently acting elements in the 3' UTR. Replacement of these elements with non- or basolaterally localizing elements yields proteins with altered intracellular and extracellular distributions and reduced signaling activities. This novel aspect of the wingless signaling pathway is conserved and may prove to be a mechanism used commonly for establishing epithelial cell polarity.
https://openalex.org/W1966677741,"Expression in dendritic cells (DCs) of DC-SIGN, a type II membrane protein with a C-type lectin ectodomain, is thought to play an important role in establishing the initial contact between DCs and resting T cells. DC-SIGN is also a unique type of human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) attachment factor and promotes efficient infection in trans of cells that express CD4 and chemokine receptors. We have identified another gene, designated here as DC-SIGN2, that exhibits high sequence homology with DC-SIGN. Here we demonstrate that alternative splicing of DC-SIGN1 (original version) and DC-SIGN2 pre-mRNA generates a large repertoire of DC-SIGN-like transcripts that are predicted to encode membrane-associated and soluble isoforms. The range of DC-SIGN1 mRNA expression was significantly broader than previously reported and included THP-1 monocytic cells, placenta, and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), and there was cell maturation/activation-induced differences in mRNA expression levels. Immunostaining of term placenta with a DC-SIGN1-specific antiserum showed that DC-SIGN1 is expressed on endothelial cells and CC chemokine receptor 5 (CCR5)-positive macrophage-like cells in the villi. DC-SIGN2 mRNA expression was high in the placenta and not detectable in PBMCs. In DCs, the expression of DC-SIGN2 transcripts was significantly lower than that of DC-SIGN1. Notably, there was significant inter-individual heterogeneity in the repertoire of DC-SIGN1 and DC-SIGN2 transcripts expressed. The genes forDC-SIGN1, DC-SIGN2, and CD23, another Type II lectin, colocalize to an ∼85 kilobase pair region on chromosome 19p13.3, forming a cluster of related genes that undergo highly complex alternative splicing events. The molecular diversity of DC-SIGN-1 and -2 is reminiscent of that observed for certain other adhesive cell surface proteins involved in cell-cell connectivity. The generation of this large collection of polymorphic cell surface and soluble variants that exhibit inter-individual variation in expression levels has important implications for the pathogenesis of HIV-1 infection, as well as for the molecular code required to establish complex interactions between antigen-presenting cells and T cells, i.e. the immunological synapse.

How this happens is not precisely known. However, there is growing support for the notion that dendritic cells (DCs) present within the mucosal sites may play a central role in this process (1–15). The normal function of DCs is to survey mucosal surfaces for antigens, capture the antigens, process captured proteins into immunogenic peptides, emigrate from tissues to the paracortex of draining lymph nodes, and present peptides in the context of MHC (major histocompatibility complex) molecules to T cells (1Banchereau J. Steinman R.M. Nature. 1998; 392: 245-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (12080) Google Scholar). It is now generally believed that HIV-1 may subvert this normal trafficking process to gain entry into lymph nodes and access to CD4+ T cells. There is also evidence demonstrating that productive infection of DCs and the ability of DCs to capture virus with subsequent transmission to T cells is mediated through two separate pathways (Refs. 5Granelli-Piperno A.

Thus, strategies designed to block mucosal transmission of HIV will require a clear understanding of the molecular determinants of not only virus infection but also of virus capture by DCs or other cell types that can subserve a similar function. Two recent reports by Geijtenbeek et al. (16Geijtenbeek T.B. Kwon D.S. Torensma R. van Vliet S.J. van Duijnhoven G.C. Middel J. Cornelissen I.L. Nottet H.S. KewalRamani V.N. Littman D.R.

First, by binding to ICAM-3 expressed on T cells, DC-SIGN is thought to facilitate the initial interaction between DCs and naive T cells (17Geijtenbeek T.B. Torensma R. van Vliet S.J. van Duijnhoven G.C. Adema G.J. van Kooyk Y. Figdor C.G. Cell. 2000; 100: 575-585Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1435) Google Scholar), setting the stage for subsequent critical events that lead to antigen recognition and the formation of a contact zone termed the immunological synapse (15Steinman R.M.

Immunol. 2000; 12: 5-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). Second, HIV-1 may exploit DC-SIGN for its transport via DCs from mucosal surfaces to secondary lymphoid organs rich in activated memory CD4+ T cells that express CC chemokine receptor 5 (CCR5). Unlike CCR5, the major coreceptor for HIV-1 cell entry (19Berger E.A. Murphy P.M. Farber J.M. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1999; 17: 657-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (1865) Google Scholar), DC-SIGN is not a coreceptor for viral entry. Geijtenbeek et al. (16Geijtenbeek T.B. Kwon D.S. Torensma R. van Vliet S.J. van Duijnhoven G.C. Middel J. Cornelissen I.L. Nottet H.S. KewalRamani V.N. Littman D.R. Figdor C.G. van Kooyk Y. Cell. 2000; 100: 587-597Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2014) Google Scholar) confirmed an earlier observation that DC-SIGN is an HIV-1 envelope (gp120)-binding lectin (20Curtis B.M. Scharnowske S. Watson A.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 8356-8360Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar) and extended significantly this finding by showing that it promotes efficient infection in trans of cells that express CD4 and CCR5. This delivery and subsequent transmission of HIV in a DC-SIGN-dependent manner to viral replication-permissive T cells may play a major role in viral replication, especially at low concentrations of HIV (16Geijtenbeek T.B. Kwon D.S. Torensma R. van Vliet S.J. van Duijnhoven G.C. Middel J. Cornelissen I.L. Nottet H.S. KewalRamani V.N. Littman D.R. Figdor C.G. van Kooyk Y. Cell. 2000; 100: 587-597Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2014) Google Scholar). Our interest in DC-SIGN stems from our studies that focus on understanding the host genetic determinants of HIV-1 pathogenesis. For example, we have demonstrated that polymorphisms in the gene for CCR5 influence the rate of disease progression in infected adults and children and in mother-to-child transmission (21Gonzalez E. Bamshad S. Sato N. Mummidi S. Dhanda R. Catano G. Cabrera S. McBride M. Cao X.-H. Merrill G. O'Connell P. Bowden D.W. Freedman B.I. Anderson S.A. Walter E.A. Evans J.S. Stephan K.T. Clark R.A.

Because of the apparent role of DC-SIGN in HIV-1 pathogenesis and DC-T cell interactions, we hypothesized that mutations influencing the gene expression of this molecule and/or its interactions with HIV-1 gp120 or ICAM-3 could have an impact on the pathogenesis of HIV-1 infection. As a first step in testing this hypothesis, we elucidated the gene and mRNA structure as well as the expression pattern of DC-SIGN. In this study, we identified another highly homologous gene designated here as DC-SIGN2 and made the surprising observation that plasticity of the DC-SIGN1 (original version) andDC-SIGN2 gene generates a wide repertoire of DC-SIGN-1 and -2 transcripts. Interestingly, in addition to DC-SIGN1(CD209) and DC-SIGN2 (CD209L), the low affinity immunoglobulin ε Fc receptor (CD23) also maps to chromosome 19p13.3 forming a cluster of highly related genes that all undergo complex alternative splicing events (23Delespesse G.

We also found that there was cell maturation and/or activation-induced differences in DC-SIGN1 mRNA expression levels. By using a DC-SIGN1-specific antiserum, we found that DC-SIGN1 was expressed on the endothelial cells of the placental vascular channels and also coexpressed with CCR5 in the placental macrophages. Abundant DC-SIGN2 mRNA expression was detected in the placenta, but significantly less in THP-1 monocytic cells and DCs, whereas mRNA expression in resting or activated PBMCs was not detected. Notably, there was inter-individual variation in the expression levels as well as the repertoires of DC-SIGN1 and DC-SIGN2 transcripts expressed. While this paper was being prepared for submission and was in review, Soilleux et al. (25Soilleux E.J. Barten R. Trowsdale J. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 2937-2942Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar) described a DC-SIGN homologue designated as DC-SIGNR that is identical to the prototypic membrane-associated DC-SIGN2 described herein, and Pohlmann et al. (26Pohlmann S. Soilleux E.J. Baribaud F. Leslie G.J. Morris L.S. Trowsdale J. Lee B. Coleman N. Doms R.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 2670-2675Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar) showed that DC-SIGNR binds to HIV/SIV and activates infection in trans. Thus, our discovery of an extensive repertoire of DC-SIGN-1 and -2 transcripts with variable expression levels may have important implications for the pathogenesis of HIV-1 infection and the generation of T cell immune responses. CD34+ peripheral hematopoietic progenitor cells (PBHP) and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated from healthy adult normal volunteers treated with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF, Amgen, CA) as described previously (27Ahuja S.S. Mummidi S. Malech H.L. Ahuja S.K. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 868-876PubMed Google Scholar). The CD34+ PBHP cells were cultured in medium supplemented with 20 ng/ml of stem cell factor and 50 ng/ml granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN). Tumor necrosis factor-α (10 ng/ml) was added on day 7, and on day 11 of culture IL-4 (10 ng/ml) was added to one-half of the cells. The cytokine-differentiated CD34+ PBHP cells were kept in culture for a total of 15 days. By day 14 of culture more than 99% of cells were CD33+ indicating that the predominant cell population was of the myeloid series (27Ahuja S.S. Mummidi S. Malech H.L. Ahuja S.K. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 868-876PubMed Google Scholar). The proportion of cells that stained for T/B lymphocyte markers (CD3/CD19) was less than 1–3%. PBMCs were also isolated from 20 ml of blood obtained from normal donors who did not receive granulocyte colony-stimulating factor. An aliquot of these PBMCs were stimulated with PHA (5 µg/ml, Sigma) for 4 days. In some experiments IL-2 (50 units/ml, Life Technologies) was added to the culture medium after day 4. CD3 and CD28 monoclonal antibodies (PharMingen) were coated on tosyl-activated Dynal beads (Dynal, Lake Success, NY) and used to stimulate PBMCs (1:1 concentration). The placenta samples were from anonymous normal donors. mRNA from highly purified leukocyte subsets, including CD14+ monocytes, was also obtained from a commercial source (CLONTECH). Cell lines were obtained from ATCC and the National Institutes of Health AIDS repository. Total RNA was extracted from cells using Trizol® reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) and first strand cDNA was generated using reverse transcriptase (RT) and random hexamers or oligo(dT) primers (Superscript™ Preamplification System, Life Technologies). The local institutional review board approved the studies conducted. The sequences of the oligonucleotides used in PCR and for hybridization experiments are shown in Table I. The cycling condition for PCR amplification of DC-SIGN1 cDNAs was 94 °C for 10 s, 52 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 60 s. The cycling condition for amplification of DC-SIGN2 cDNAs was 94 °C for 30 s, 65 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 90 s. A total of 35 cycles was used. The PCR products were cloned into TOPO vectors 2.1 or II (Invitrogen) and sequenced on both strands. To determine the genomic structure of DC-SIGN1, a series of sense and antisense orientation primers based on the cDNA sequence described by Curtiset al. (20Curtis B.M. Scharnowske S. Watson A.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 8356-8360Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar) were designed (sequences not shown). Two expressed sequence tags (ESTs) that had homology to DC-SIGN2 were purchased from Research Genetics (Huntsville, AL, Image Clones 146996 and 240697) and sequenced on both strands.Table IOligonucleotides used in this studyPCR primers used for DC-SIGN1 cDNA cloning (Fig. 1), Southern blot analysis (Figs. 8 and 9), and PAGE analysis (Fig. 11)1–1atgagtgactccaaggaa(S)1–2aagctacagttccttctctcc(AS)1–3gtgaggctgggttgggacgct(S)DC-SIGN1 oligonucleotides used for Southern blot analysis (Figs.8 and 9 and data not shown)1–4ggcctcagcctgcccaggctc(ExIb)1–5aggaacagctgagaggccttg(ExIc)1–6tcttggctgggctccttgtccaag(ExII)1–7gagcttagcagtgtccaaggtc(ExIc-ExIII)1–8cttcaagcagtattggaacagaggagagc(ExVI)PCR primers used in generating DC-SIGN2 cDNAs (Fig. 5)2–1ggtaccaacatctggggacagcgggaaaacatg(S)2–2gctctagactattcgtctctgaagc(AS)PCR primers used in generating DC-SIGN2 cDNA for Southern blot analysis (data not shown)2–3atctggggacagcgggaa(S)2–4tggagtgaagaagcgctg(AS)PCR primers used in generating DC-SIGN2 cDNA for PAGE analysis (Fig. 12)1–1atgagtgactccaaggaa(S)2–5ggaggctgaggctagcag(AS)DC-SIGN2 oligonucleotide used for Southern blot analysis (data not shown)2–6aagatccaacaaccagtggca(ExII)S, sense; AS, antisense; Ex, exon (location of the oligomer or orientation).

One µg of total RNA was used for synthesizing cDNA by random primers (Superscript Preamplification System, Life Technologies, Inc.). One-tenth of the cDNA product was used for PCR amplification. The PCR amplification profile consisted of 30 cycles of 94 °C for 10 s, 55 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 60 s. PCR amplification was performed in a 100-µl reaction volume in the presence of 20 mmTris-HCl, 50 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm of each dNTP, 0.2 µm of each primer, and 2.5 units of Taq DNA polymerase (Life Technologies, Inc.). The primers used for amplification were oligonucleotides 1-1 and 1-2 for DC-SIGN1 and oligonucleotides 2-3 and 2-4 for DC-SIGN2 (TableI). An oligonucleotide that is DC-SIGN1 exon Ib-specific (oligonucleotide 1–3, Table I) was used to amplify exon Ib-containing cDNAs. The amplified products were size-fractionated by electrophoresis on a 1.5% agarose gel. After denaturation in alkaline solution, the DNA was transferred to a nylon membrane (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) by capillary action. Hybridization was performed with the following end-labeled oligonucleotide probes: (i) oligonucleotides derived from DC-SIGN1 sequences in exon Ib, exon Ic, exon II, and exon VI (oligonucleotides 1-4, 1-5, 1-6, and 1-8, respectively in Table I); (ii) an oligonucleotide that had 11 nucleotides of the 3′-end of exon Ic and 11 nucleotides of the 5′-end of exon III of DC-SIGN1 (oligonucleotide 1-7, Table I); (iii) an oligonucleotide that had identity with DC-SIGN2-specific exon II sequences (oligonucleotide 2-6, Table I). The membranes were hybridized with the radiolabeled probes at 42 °C for 12 h and washed under the following conditions: 2× SSC, 0.1% SDS at 42 °C for 5 min (twice); 0.1× SSC, 0.l% SDS at 45 °C for 15 min (twice). The filters were exposed to Biomax (MR) film (Kodak) at −80 °C in a Quanta III cassette for 15 h. DC-SIGN1 and DC-SIGN2 cDNAs were amplified using the PCR conditions described above in a 50-µl reaction. The primers used for amplification were oligonucleotides 1-1 and 1-2 for DC-SIGN1 and oligonucleotides 1-1 and 2-5 for DC-SIGN2 (Table I). One of the primers used for amplification was end-labeled with 32P to facilitate detection of the PCR products by autoradiography. Five µl of the PCR product was mixed with 15 µl of formamide dye (95% formamide, 10 mm EDTA, 0.02% bromphenol blue, 0.02% xylene cyanol) and boiled for 5 min. The mixture was then chilled and loaded on a 3 or 4% polyacrylamide gel containing 8 m urea and electrophoresed for 12 h at 200 V in a Protean II xi cell (Bio-Rad). The polyacrylamide gels were dried, and autoradiography was performed as described above. The TNT®-coupled Reticulocyte Lysate System (Promega) was used to translate in vitro DC-SIGN1 cDNAs cloned into pcDNA4/HisMax TOPO vector (Invitrogen). The 35S-labeled translated products were fractionated in a 9% acrylamide gel and were exposed to XAR-2 film (Kodak) in a Quanta III cassette. A synthetic peptide (NH2-CSRDEEQFLSPAPATPNPPPA-COOH) derived from the C-terminal region of DC-SIGN1 was KLH-conjugated and used to immunize rabbits. The corresponding peptide sequence is absent in the DC-SIGN2. Rabbits were bled after 6 weeks to obtain polyclonal antiserum and were subsequently affinity-purified. Goat polyclonal antibodies (Ab) for CCR5 (sc-6128), PECAM-1 (sc-1505), and the corresponding blocking peptides were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). The DC-SIGN1 blocking peptide was synthesized by Zymed Laboratories Inc. (San Francisco, CA). OCT (Sakura Finetek USA, Inc., Torrance, CA)-embedded frozen term placental sections were air-dried for 30 min, washed in PBS (pH 7.4), and fixed in 4% cold paraformaldehyde for 10 min. The fixed sections were washed in Tris-buffered saline for 5 min, and were permeabilized with 0.05% PBS-Tween® (Sigma Chemical Co. St Louis, MO) for 5 min. All of the subsequent washes were in PBS-Tween®. The sections were blocked using an avidin-biotin blocking kit (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Subsequently the sections were blocked with 5% bovine serum albumin for 30 min, washed, and incubated with either DC-SIGN1 antiserum or DC-SIGN1 antiserum plus DC-SIGN1 blocking peptide for 1 h. The sections were washed for 5 min, incubated with a 1:100 dilution of biotinylated goat anti-rabbit antibody (Dako, Carpinteria, CA) for 30 min, washed, and then stained for 30 min with the avidin-biotin complex-glucose oxidase system (Vector Laboratories). Color development was achieved using the glucose oxidase substrate kit (Vector Laboratories). Distilled water was used to block additional color development. For double staining, the sections were incubated in PBS for 5 min, and endogenous peroxidases were inhibited using a peroxidase block (Santa Cruz) for 5 min. Slides were then washed in PBS-Tween for 5 min, blocked with 5% bovine serum albumin for 30 min, and then incubated with one of the following: (i) PECAM-1 Ab, (ii) PECAM-1 Ab and its blocking peptide, (iii) CCR5 Ab, or (iv) CCR5 Ab and its blocking peptide. Subsequent steps for detection of goat primary antibodies was performed using the goat Immunocruz staining system according to the manufacturer's directions (Santa Cruz). Sections were incubated with diaminobenzidine for 10 min, and the reaction was stopped with distilled water. The sections were then dehydrated with graded alcohols and two washes in xylene and were mounted with Vectamount™ (Vector Laboratories). In the course of identifying polymorphisms in DC-SIGN1, we identified several alternatively spliced DC-SIGN1 cDNAs (see below). To identify the genomic sequences homologous to these cDNAs, we determined the gene structure for human DC-SIGN1. Genomic DNA was subjected to PCR using primers corresponding to the known cDNA sequence (20Curtis B.M. Scharnowske S. Watson A.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 8356-8360Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar); GenBank™ accession no. M98457), and the PCR products were cloned and sequenced. In addition, while this work was in progress, as part of the Human Genome Sequence Project, a ∼143,619-bp contig of human chromosome 19p that contained DC-SIGN1 became available (GenBank™ accession no. AC008812). Other than a few polymorphisms, there was complete homology between the DC-SIGN1 genomic sequences that we had identified and those found in this contig (data not shown). Comparisons of the cDNA and genomic sequences revealed that the coding region of the previously described prototypic DC-SIGN1 cDNA (GenBank™ accession no. M98457) was encoded by six exons (Fig. 1a, top panel). The nomenclature for the exons was based on the alternatively spliced exons identified in the DC-SIGN1 cDNAs (see below). Exons Ia and Ic encoded the majority of the cytoplasmic domain of the prototypic DC-SIGN1 cDNA (20Curtis B.M. Scharnowske S. Watson A.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 8356-8360Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). Exon II encoded 5 amino acids of the cytoplasmic domain and the entire transmembrane (TM) domain. Exon III encoded the repeats as well as a short stretch of amino acids that preceded the seven full repeats and the one-half repeat. Exons IV, V, and VI together encoded the predicted extracellular lectin-binding domain of DC-SIGN1. RT-PCR was used to amplify DC-SIGN1 cDNAs from PHA-activated PBMCs derived from normal human donors, human CD34+ PBHP-derived mature DCs, and THP-1 monocytic cells. Sequence analyses of these PCR amplicons revealed several distinct cDNAs that shared homology to the previously reported prototypic DC-SIGN1 cDNA (Fig. 1,a and b; Ref. 20Curtis B.M. Scharnowske S. Watson A.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 8356-8360Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). These novel DC-SIGN1 transcripts differed from the originally reported cDNA sequence (GenBank™ accession no. M98457) by the presence or absence of stretches of sequences, indicating that they had arisen by a complex pattern of alternative splicing events in the exons encoding the intra- or extracellular domains and/or by splicing out of exon II, the exon that encodes the predicted TM domain (Fig. 1, a andb). The predicted translation products of these transcripts are illustrated in Fig. 2and shown in Supplementary Figs. 1 and 2. Based on the structures predicted from their amino acid sequences, the DC-SIGN1 isoforms could be categorized into one of five major groups (Figs. 1, a and b, and 2; Supplementary Figs. 1 and 2), namely mDC-SIGN1A, sDC-SIGN1A, mDC-SIGN1B, sDC-SIGN1B, and truncated DC-SIGN1B (tDC-SIGN1B). The first group of transcripts designated as membrane-associated or mDC-SIGN1A transcripts had a Met (ATG) translation initiation codon within exon Ia and retained the exon predicted to encode the TM domain (exon II; Figs. 1 a and 2,a and b). These transcripts included the prototypic DC-SIGN1, designated here as mDC-SIGN1A Type I, as well as additional transcripts that are predicted to encode variable portions of the extracellular domain (Figs. 1 a and 2, aand b). For example, in mDC-SIGN1A Type II, the first 6 amino acids encoded by exon V are spliced out, whereas in mDC-SIGN1A Type III, some of the repeats encoded by exon III are spliced out (Figs. 1 a and 2 b). The second group of transcripts was designated as sDC-SIGN1A. sDC-SIGN1A transcripts also had a Met (ATG) translation initiation codon within exon Ia, but the exon predicted to encode the TM domain (exon II) was spliced out, suggesting the synthesis of soluble forms of"

Rat serum MBP consists of oligomers containing up to four copies of a subunit that is composed of three identical polypeptide chains. Biophysical analysis of intact and truncated MASPs indicates that each MASP is a homodimer that is stabilized through interactions involving an N-terminal CUB domain. The binding sites for MBP are formed from the three N-terminal MASP domains, in which two CUB modules interact with MBP. Each MASP dimer contains binding sites for two MBP subunits. Both sites must be occupied by subunits from a single MBP oligomer to form a stable complex. Thus, the smallest functional unit for complement activation consists of MBP dimers bound to MASP-1 or MASP-2 homodimers. Trimers and tetramers of MBP form complexes containing up to two MASPs. The results reveal how MASP-1 and MASP-2 can function independently to activate the complement cascade.

It binds to sugars on the surfaces of pathogenic microorganisms and activates complement by an antibody-independent mechanism (1Weis W.I. Taylor M.E. Drickamer K. Immunol. Rev. 1998; 163: 19-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (902) Google Scholar, 2Turner M.W. Immunol. Today. 1996; 17: 532-540Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (685) Google Scholar). Complement fixation by MBP occurs through two associated serine proteases, MASP-1 and MASP-2, that are homologs of C1r and C1s of the classical pathway. Upon activation, MASPs cleave downstream complement components, triggering a cascade of reactions that leads to neutralization of invading cells. Foreign cells are cleared following formation of host-mediated lytic complexes assembled from terminal complement components or are removed by phagocytosis following opsonization (3Ikeda K. Sannoh T.

MBPs are members of the collectin family of animal lectins (6Drickamer K. Taylor M.E. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1993; 9: 237-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (714) Google Scholar). Each polypeptide comprises an N-terminal cysteine-rich domain, a collagenous domain, a neck region consisting of an α-helical coiled coil, and a C-terminal carbohydrate recognition domain. The MASP-binding site on MBP is located within the first part of the collagen-like domain (7Wallis R. Drickamer K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3580-3589Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). This region forms a central core that links individual MBP subunits, composed of three identical polypeptide chains, to form larger oligomers that resemble bouquet-like structures. Rat serum MBP (MBP-A) forms a heterogeneous mixture of oligomers ranging from monomers to tetramers of subunits (8Yokota Y. Arai T. Kawasaki T. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 1995; 117: 414-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The dimers, trimers, and tetramers all fix complement, although trimers and tetramers have higher specific activities than dimers (7Wallis R. Drickamer K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3580-3589Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). A second MBP, found in the liver, has been identified in rats and other mammals. This protein is designated MBP-C and consists of a single trimeric subunit that does not form larger oligomers. MBP-C has a low complement-fixing activity compared with MBP-A. MASP-1 and MASP-2 are ∼40% identical in sequence (9Thiel S. Vorup-Jensen T. Stover C.M. Schwaeble W. Laursen S.B. Poulsen K. Willis A.C. Eggleton P. Hansen S. Holmskov U. Reid K.B.M. Jensenius J.C.

Fujita T. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 4924-4930PubMed Google Scholar). Each protein consists of two N-terminal CUB domains (domains found in complement subcomponents C1r/C1s, Uegf, andbone morphogenetic protein-1) separated by an EGF-like domain and followed by two complement control protein modules and a C-terminal serine protease domain. MASPs bind Ca2+ through interactions that probably involve the EGF-like domains (13Wallis R. Dodd R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 30962-30969Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). They are synthesized as inactive proenzymes. Upon activation, each protein is cleaved, generating an active protease that remains covalently attached to the rest of the molecule by a disulfide bond. Studies using truncated proteins have shown that MASP-1 and MASP-2 bind to MBP in a Ca2+-dependent manner through interactions involving the CUB and EGF-like domains (13Wallis R. Dodd R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 30962-30969Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 14Thielens N.E. Cseh S. Thiel S. Vorup-Jensen T. Rossi V. Jensenius J.C. Arlaud G.J. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 5068-5077Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Fragments encompassing these regions are Ca2+-independent homodimers that are stabilized by interactions involving the two N-terminal domains. The composition of MBP·MASP complexes that activate the complement cascade is not known. In the experiments reported here, MBP·MASP complexes have been recreated from recombinant proteins using intact MASPs as well as truncated forms. Analysis of the stoichiometry of these complexes reveals that the three N-terminal domains of each MASP are necessary and sufficient to reproduce the MBP-binding properties of the full-length proteins. A complex between two MBP subunits and either a MASP-1 or MASP-2 dimer is sufficient to form a functional unit that is capable of becoming activated. Restriction enzymes and peptide:N-glycosidase F were purchased from New England Biolabs Inc. All tissue culture media were from Life Technologies, Inc. Promix cell labeling mixture (∼70% [35S]methionine and 30% [35S]cysteine) was from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech.Nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose, Sepharose 6B, and protein molecular mass markers were from Sigma. Affi-Gel 10 matrix was from Bio-Rad. Immulon 4 microtiter wells were from Dynex Technologies. Nitrocellulose membranes were from Schleicher & Schüll. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was performed by the method of Laemmli (15Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar). MALDI-MS was carried out on a Finnigan MAT Lasermat mass spectrometer using sinapinic acid as the sample matrix (16Wallis R. Drickamer K. Biochem. J. 1997; 325: 391-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Bovine serum albumin ([M + H]+ = 66,431 Da) and bovine serum albumin dimer ([M + H]+ = 132,860 Da) were used as the calibration standards. Recombinant MBP-A and MBP-C were purified by affinity chromatography on mannose-Sepharose columns (7Wallis R. Drickamer K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3580-3589Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 16Wallis R. Drickamer K. Biochem. J. 1997; 325: 391-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Oligomers of MBP-A were separated by anion-exchange chromatography on a MonoQ column (HR 5/5, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) as described (7Wallis R. Drickamer K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3580-3589Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Radiolabeled MBP-A was produced by incubating confluent cells in methionine-free α-minimum essential medium supplemented with 10% dialyzed fetal calf serum, 0.5 µmmethotrexate, and 0.1 mCi/ml [35S]methionine for 16 h. Radiolabeled protein was purified as described for unlabeled proteins. Catalytically inactive MASP-1 and MASP-2 were created by modification of the active-site serine residues (Ser627 in MASP-1 and Ser613 in MASP-2) (13Wallis R. Dodd R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 30962-30969Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The cDNAs were altered by substitution of double-stranded oligonucleotides for restriction fragments. The modified cDNAs were ligated into the polylinker of plasmid pED (17Kaufman R.J. Davies M.V. Wasley L.C. Michnick D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 4485-4490Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar), and the resulting plasmids were used to transfect adherent DXB11 Chinese hamster ovary cells (18Kaufman R.J. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 185: 537-566Crossref Scopus (148) Google Scholar). MASPs were produced in serum-free medium to ensure that preparations were not contaminated with other serum proteins using a protocol that has been described previously for truncated MASPs (13Wallis R. Dodd R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 30962-30969Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). MASPs were purified on MBP-A affinity columns prepared as described (7Wallis R. Drickamer K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3580-3589Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Culture medium (100–200 ml) diluted with an equal volume of loading buffer (50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, containing 150 mm NaCl and 25 mm CaCl2) was loaded onto the affinity column (3 ml) pre-equilibrated with loading buffer (50 ml). Following washing with a further 50 ml of loading buffer, protein was eluted in 1-ml fractions with 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, containing 1.25 m NaCl and 10 mm EDTA. Fractions containing MASPs were identified by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Each MASP* bound tightly to the MBP-A affinity columns in a Ca2+-dependent manner, indicating correct folding. Where necessary, MASPs were purified further by ion-exchange chromatography on a MonoQ column (HR 5/5). Protein was dialyzed with 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.8, containing 50 mm NaCl and 2.5 mm CaCl2 and loaded onto the column equilibrated in the same buffer. Following washing, bound MASPs were eluted with a 0.05–1 m NaCl gradient over 20 ml. Yields of 0.25–0.5 mg of each protein were obtained from 200 ml of medium. Molecular masses of 84.5 kDa for MASP-1* and 77.5 kDa for MASP-2* determined by MALDI-MS were greater than the calculated values of the unmodified polypeptides (77.0 and 73.5 kDa, respectively) due to glycosylation. Attachment of glycans at each of theN-glycosylation sites (see Fig. 1) would account for the observed masses. Truncated MASPs encompassing the EGF-like domain and the second CUB domain were generated by ligating fragments of the cDNAs to the cDNA for the dog preproinsulin signal sequence. The resulting constructs were inserted into the polylinker of plasmid pED, and the proteins were produced and harvested as described for full-length MASPs. Truncated proteins encompassing Ala118–Glu281 of MASP-1 and Ala117–Pro280 of MASP-2 (13Wallis R. Dodd R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 30962-30969Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) were constructed with six C-terminal histidine residues attached to enable purification by affinity chromatography on nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose columns (1 ml) primed with NiSO4. Proteins were purified from 200 ml of Chinese hamster ovary serum-free medium II as described previously for proteins comprising the two and three N-terminal domains (three-domain MASPs) (13Wallis R. Dodd R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 30962-30969Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Only the MASP-2 construct yielded enough protein for further analysis. Yields ranged from 0.05 to 0.1 mg of protein from 200 ml of medium. The MASP-2 fragment encompassing the EGF and CUB-2 domains migrated as several differentially glycosylated bands on SDS-polyacrylamide gels (see Fig. 1). N-terminal sequencing of the major bands confirmed that the signal sequence was processed correctly during biosynthesis, and digestion with peptide:N-glycosidase F reduced the mixture to a single band. Radiolabeled three-domain MASP-1 and MASP-2 were produced by incubating confluent cells in methionine-free α-minimum essential medium supplemented with 10% dialyzed fetal calf serum, 0.5 µmmethotrexate, and 0.1 mCi/ml [35S]methionine for 16 h. Proteins were purified as described for unlabeled three-domain proteins. Binding assays were performed essentially as described (13Wallis R. Dodd R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 30962-30969Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Polystyrene plates were loaded with 50 µl of MBP-A or three-domain MASP (0.1 mg/ml) and incubated at 4 °C for 16 h. Wells were blocked with 5% (w/v) bovine serum albumin in binding buffer (50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, containing 150 mm NaCl and 25 mm CaCl2). Following incubation at 4 °C for 4 h, wells were emptied and washed three times with binding buffer. Labeled MBP-A or three-domain MASP (∼50 ng at ∼1 × 105 cpm/µg) and 2-fold serial dilutions of the soluble ligand were mixed in binding buffer containing bovine serum albumin (1 mg/ml) and added to the wells in a total volume of 100 µl. After 2 h at 4 °C, wells were emptied and washed three times with ice-cold binding buffer. Bound protein was removed from the wells in two rinses (75 µl) of 0.1 m NaOH, neutralized with 0.5 m acetic acid (50 µl) containing 6 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, and blotted onto a nitrocellulose filter under vacuum using a Bio-dot filter apparatus (Bio-Rad). Levels of radioactivity were determined using a PhosphorImager SI (Molecular Dynamics, Inc.). Data were fitted to multiple ligand binding curves (19Eftink M.R. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 278: 221-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar) by nonlinear regression using MicroCal Origin. The amounts of35S-labeled MBP-A and 35S-labeled three-domain MASP were below the concentrations required for half-maximal binding in all binding assays. Equilibrium experiments were carried out as described previously (7Wallis R. Drickamer K. J. Biol.

Absorbance was monitored at wavelengths between 230 and 280 nm to give initial values of between 0.1 and 0.5. Data were analyzed using the software supplied by Beckman Coulter. The partial specific volumes of proteins were calculated from their amino acid and carbohydrate compositions (20Cohn E.J. Edsall J.T. Proteins, Amino Acids and Peptides as Ions and Dipolar Ions. Reinhold, New York1943: 370-381Google Scholar). Values for MBP-A, MBP-C, MASP-1*, MASP-2*, three-domain MASP-1, three-domain MASP-2, and MASP-2 (EGF + CUB-2) are 0.721, 0.718, 0.717, 0.724, 0.703, 0.714, and 0.705 ml/g, respectively. Data are presented as average molecular mass values ± S.E. from two independent experiments. For analysis of the interaction between MBP-C and three-domain MASPs, proteins were mixed at 1:1, 1:2, and 2:1 molar ratios to give an initial absorbance of ∼0.5 at 280 nm. Data were analyzed using the program 2C1SFIT, which implements conservation of mass constraints to model globally the equilibrium distributions (21Minton A.P. Prog. Colloid Polym. Sci. 1997; 107: 11-19Crossref Google Scholar). Data were fitted to progressively more complex binding models until a satisfactory fit was achieved. The apparent equilibrium association constants (with respect to weight/volume concentrations) and the fraction of competent components were allowed to vary as global fitting parameters. The molecular masses of MBP-C and truncated MASPs were determined from experiments run in parallel, by fitting equilibrium data globally to a single species model at three different loading concentrations. The apparent equilibrium association constants determined from the fitting procedure were converted to molar dissociation constants as described (22Rivas G. Stafford W. Minton A.P. Methods. 1999; 19: 194-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Values are means ± S.E. from two independent experiments. It was assumed that no changes in the partial specific volume occur upon complex formation and that the molecular mass of a complex is the sum of that of the components. Sedimentation velocity experiments were carried out at 40,000 rpm and 20 °C in Epon aluminum-filled centerpieces as described (16Wallis R. Drickamer K. Biochem. J. 1997; 325: 391-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Scans were collected at 2–4 min intervals at 230 nm. Data were analyzed using the program DCDT (23Stafford W.D. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 203: 295-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar). The apparent sedimentation coefficient distributions of three-domain MASPs and of the purified MBP oligomers fitted well to single gaussian peaks, indicating that they were monodisperse. Sedimentation coefficients of three-domain MASPs were determined by the second moment method and were corrected for the effects of buffer density and viscosity (24Laue T.M. Bhairavi D.S. Ridgeway T.M. Pelletier S.L. Harding S.E. Rowe A.J. Horton J.C. Analytical Ultracentrifugation in Biochemistry and Polymer Science. Royal Society of Chemistry, Cambridge1992: 90-125Google Scholar). Thes 20,w values for MBP-A dimers, trimers, and tetramers of subunits were 5.0, 6.0, and 7.1 S at ∼0.08 mg/ml, consistent with previous findings (7Wallis R. Drickamer K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3580-3589Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Frictional coefficients were calculated assuming a hydration factor of 0.28 g of H2O/g of protein (24Laue T.M. Bhairavi D.S. Ridgeway T.M. Pelletier S.L. Harding S.E. Rowe A.J. Horton J.C. Analytical Ultracentrifugation in Biochemistry and Polymer Science. Royal Society of Chemistry, Cambridge1992: 90-125Google Scholar). The first step toward dissecting the MBP/MASP interaction was to reconstitute the MBP·MASP complex from purified components. Initial studies were undertaken with full-length MASPs. Using the results as a basis, subfragments of MASPs with affinities for MBP equivalent to those of the full-length proteins were defined. In an initial attempt to isolate large amounts of MASP-1 and MASP-2 for biophysical analysis, the cDNAs were expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells. Cells transfected with the cDNAs grew very slowly compared with cells producing other serum proteins using the same expression system (7Wallis R. Drickamer K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3580-3589Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 16Wallis R. Drickamer K. Biochem. J. 1997; 325: 391-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), suggesting that production of wild-type proteins is cytotoxic. Out of 12 cell lines that were tested, only one line produced even trace amounts of MASP-1 that could be detected on immunoblots probed with antibody specific for the N terminus of MASP-1 (data not shown). The apparent molecular mass of ∼65 kDa was consistent with the calculated mass of the N-terminal fragment of processed MASP-1 polypeptide (13Wallis R. Dodd R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 30962-30969Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), indicating that the protein is probably activated during biosynthesis. No protein was isolated from the medium of any cell lines transfected with MASP-2 cDNA, implying that the encoded protease is even more cytotoxic than MASP-1. To avoid the cytotoxicity associated with protease activation during or after secretion, a catalytically inactive form of each MASP was created by replacing the serine residue that forms part of the catalytic triad in the protease domain with an alanine residue (Fig.1). This substitution was designed to inactivate the protease while retaining its MBP-binding properties. Inactive MASPs, designated MASP-1* and MASP-2*, were purified by affinity chromatography on MBP-A-agarose columns. This strategy enabled rapid purification without the use of extraneous tags. As expected, each MASP* migrated as a single band on SDS-polyacrylamide gels (Fig.1), demonstrating that neither protein is proteolytically processed during biosynthesis. Weight-averaged molecular masses for MASP-1* and MASP-2* determined by equilibrium ultracentrifugation were in agreement with the calculated values for homodimers of the glycosylated polypeptides (Fig. 2, A andB). Equilibrium analytical ultracentrifugation was also used to examine whether MASP-1 and MASP-2 interact with each other to form hetero-oligomers. Apparent molecular masses of mixtures of MASP-1* and MASP-2* present in equal molar amounts corresponded to the average molecular mass of the two components over a wide range of protein concentrations (Fig. 2 C). Thus, MASP-1 and MASP-2 behave independently and remain dimeric even at protein concentrations in excess of those present in serum. The interactions of MBP with MASP-1 and MASP-2 were compared using solid-phase competition assays in which increasing concentrations of MASPs* were incubated in wells coated with MBP-A. 35S-Labeled truncated MASPs encompassing the three N-terminal domains (Fig. 1) were used as the reporter ligands. The binding interaction was quantified by determining the concentration of MASP necessary to displace half of the reporter ligand from MBP-A (K I). Analysis revealed that MASP-1* and MASP-2* interacted independently with MBP-A with comparable binding affinities to form stable complexes (Fig.3 and TableI).Table IBinding of MBP to full-length and truncated MASPsImmobilized proteinSoluble ligandK IRelativeK I 1-aExpressed asK I(full-length MASP)/K I(truncated MASP).nmMASP-1 interactionsMBP-AMASP-1*34 ± 121.00MBP-A3-Domain MASP-115 ± 42.7 ± 1.5MASP-1*MBP-A23 ± 61.003-Domain MASP-1MBP-A46 ± 90.64 ± 0.37MBP-AMASP-1 (CUB-1 + EGF)1810 ± 2000.013 ± 0.005MBP-AMASP-1 (EGF + CUB-2)ND1-bNot determined.NDMASP-2 interactionsMBP-AMASP-2*48 ± 51.00MBP-A3-Domain MASP-222 ± 42.3 ± 0.6MASP-2*MBP-A44 ± 91.003-Domain MASP-2MBP-A28 ± 61.8 ± 0.8MBP-AMASP-2 (CUB-1 + EGF)454 ± 270.11 ± 0.2MBP-AMASP-2 (EGF + CUB-2)>44,000<0.001Inhibition constants (K I) correspond to the concentration of each protein giving 50% inhibition of35S-labeled MBP-A or 35S-labeled three-domain MASP binding to immobilized MASP or MBP-A.

Concentrations of MBP-A are expressed as moles of MBP subunits/liter. Values are means ± S.E. from at least two separate experiments performed in duplicate. Purified MASPs* were relatively unstable. Their tendency to aggregate upon storage prevented a more detailed characterization of the complexes formed with MBP. To identify a stable MASP fragment that could be used in further analysis, the interactions of truncated MASPs with MBP were examined. Initial studies were undertaken using fragments comprising the three N-terminal domains of MASP-1 and MASP-2 (13Wallis R. Dodd R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 30962-30969Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Competition assays revealed that three-domain MASPs bound to MBP with affinities similar to those of their full-length counterparts (Fig. 3 and Table I). ComparableK I values were also obtained when binding assays were performed using immobilized MASPs and soluble MBP-A with labeled MBP-A as the reporter ligand (Table I). Thus, three-domain MASPs are sufficient to reproduce the binding properties of the intact proteins. To establish whether all three of the N-terminal MASP domains are necessary for stable binding to MBP, the binding properties of smaller MASP fragments were analyzed. A fragment of MASP-1 comprising the CUB-1 and EGF modules (13Wallis R. Dodd R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 30962-30969Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) bound to MBP-A, demonstrating that either or both of these domains form part of the binding site. However, the affinity was reduced compared with intact MASP-1*, indicating that the CUB-2 module must also interact with MBP (Fig. 3and Table I). Comparable results were obtained with the corresponding MASP-2 fragment. To examine whether the CUB-1 domain is necessary for MBP binding by MASPs, fragments lacking this domain were produced, and their binding properties for MBP-A were analyzed. The MASP-2 fragment comprising the EGF and CUB-2 domains did not interact with MBP-A, so the CUB-1 domain must be essential for stable complex formation. Taken together, the results show that both CUB domains form part of the MBP-binding site on MASPs and that the three N-terminal MASP domains together are thus necessary as well as sufficient for stable binding to MBP. Because the MASP-2 fragment comprising the EGF and CUB-2 domains did not bind to MBP, it was of interest to determine its oligomeric structure. Characterization of three-domain MASPs and fragments consisting of the two N-terminal domains has shown that one or both of the CUB-1 and EGF modules interact to form homodimers. The molecular mass of the glycosylated MASP-2 fragment comprising the EGF and CUB-2 domains determined by equilibrium ultracentrifugation (21.0 ± 0.8 kDa) is the same as that determined by MALDI-MS (21.5 kDa), so it is monomeric. Because the EGF domains and CUB-2 modules of individual MASP protomers do not bind to each other, the CUB-1 domains must mediate dimerization. To define functional units for complement activation by MBP, it was necessary to characterize the interactions of individual MBP·MASP complexes. Because the different MBP-A oligomers activate complement with different specific activities (7Wallis R. Drickamer K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3580-3589Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), individual MBP-A oligomers were isolated, and their MASP-binding properties were analyzed separately. The solid-phase competition assay was used to demonstrate that each MBP oligomer interacts with the three-domain MASP-1 and MASP-2 proteins, but with different affinities (TableII). MBP-A oligomers bound to MASP-2 with affinities in the following order: tetramer > trimer > dimer > monomer. However, when the affinities of MBP-A dimers, trimers, and tetramers are rationalized to the number of MBP subunits, they are all equivalent (Table II), suggesting that the higher affinities of the larger oligomers are due to the presence of more MASP-binding sites on such oligomers. Similar treatment of the binding data showed that MASP-1 is different from MASP-2. The affinities of MBP-A trimers and tetramers for three-domain MASP-1 are greater than the affinities of dimers after they are rationalized to the number of subunits in each oligomer (Table II). Thus, MASP-1 binds to MBP-A tetramers and trimers with higher affinities than to MBP-A dimers, even after accounting for the presence of extra MASP-binding sites on the larger MBP oligomers.Table IIBinding properties of MBP oligomers with truncated MASPsMBP oligomerK I(oligomer)K I(MBP subunit)RelativeK I 2-aExpressed asK I(MBP subunit) for total MBP-A/K I(MBP subunit) for each purified MBP oligomer.Relative complement-fixing activity2-bData from Ref. 7.3-Domain MASP-13-Domain MASP-23-Domain MASP-13-Domain MASP-23-Domain MASP-13-Domain MASP-2nmnm(MBP-A)49 ± 19 ± 336 ± 436 ± 121.3 ± 0.31.0 ± 0.51.0 ± 0.1(MBP-A)320 ± 810 ± 360 ± 2430 ± 91.0 ± 0.51.1 ± 0.51.2 ± 0.2(MBP-A)2125 ± 2518 ± 1250 ± 5036 ± 20.20 ± 0.080.79 ± 0.210.24 ± 0.06MBP-A6500 ± 5001300 ± 3006500 ± 5001300 ± 3000.007 ± 0.0020.024 ± 0.010<0.01MBP-C5100 ± 20003000 ± 13005100 ± 20003000 ± 13000.011 ± 0.0060.013 ± 0.0070.06 ± 0.03Inhibition constants (K I(oligomer)) correspond to the concentration of each MBP oligomer giving 50% inhibition of 35S-labeled MBP-A binding to MASP.K I(MBP subunit) values were dete"
https://openalex.org/W2075491039,"Calnexin and calreticulin are molecular chaperones of the endoplasmic reticulum that bind to newly synthesized glycoproteins in part through a lectin site specific for monoglucosylated (Glc1Man7–9GlcNAc2) oligosaccharides. In addition to this lectin-oligosaccharide interaction, in vitro studies have demonstrated that calnexin and calreticulin can bind to polypeptide segments of both glycosylated and nonglycosylated proteins. However, the in vivo relevance of this latter interaction has been questioned. We examined whether polypeptide-based interactions occur between calnexin and its substrates in vivo using the glucosidase inhibitor castanospermine or glucosidase-deficient cells to prevent the formation of monoglucosylated oligosaccharides. We show that if care is taken to preserve weak interactions, the block in lectin-oligosaccharide binding leads to the loss of some calnexin-substrate complexes, but many others remain readily detectable. Furthermore, we demonstrate that calnexin is capable of associating in vivo with a substrate that completely lacks Asn-linked oligosaccharides. The binding of calnexin to proteins that lack monoglucosylated oligosaccharides could not be attributed to nonspecific adsorption nor to its inclusion in protein aggregates. We conclude that both lectin-oligosaccharide and polypeptide-based interactions occur between calnexin and diverse proteins in vivo and that the strength of the latter interaction varies substantially between protein substrates.

Biochem. J. 2000; 348: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). These proteins are unique among molecular chaperones in that they utilize a lectin site as a means to associate with unfolded glycoproteins (2Hammond C. Braakman I. Helenius A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 913-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (721) Google Scholar, 3Ware F.E. Vassilakos A. Peterson P.A. Jackson M.R. Lehrman M.A. Williams D.B. J. Biol.

The lectin site is specific for Glc1Man7–9GlcNAc2oligosaccharides, which exist transiently as intermediates during the processing of Asn-linked glycoproteins. It is a widely held view that the removal and re-addition of the terminal glucose residue of these oligosaccharides, catalyzed, respectively, by the ER enzymes glucosidase II and UDP-glucose:glycoprotein glucosyltransferase, regulate cycles of CNX and CRT binding to glycoproteins (5Cannon K.S. Helenius A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7537-7544Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 6Hebert D.N. Foellmer B. Helenius A. Cell. 1995; 81: 425-433Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar). In this model, CNX and CRT do not function as classical molecular chaperones that prevent aggregation by binding to hydrophobic polypeptide segments. Rather, they are thought to promote folding by recruiting other chaperones and folding enzymes, such as the thiol oxidoreductase ERp57 (7High S. Lecomte F.J. Russell S.J. Abell B.M. Oliver J.D. FEBS Lett. 2000; 476: 38-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 8Van der Wal F.J. Oliver J.D. High S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 256: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), to the glycoprotein substrate. The concept that CNX and CRT associate with glycoproteins solely through lectin-oligosaccharide interactions is based primarily on experiments wherein cultured cells were treated with tunicamycin to block Asn-linked oligosaccharide addition or with the glucosidase I and II inhibitors castanospermine or deoxynojirimycin to prevent the conversion of the Glc3Man9GlcNAc2precursor to the monoglucosylated Glc1Man9GlcNAc2 species. Subsequent immunoprecipitation with anti-CNX or anti-CRT antibodies frequently revealed a dramatic reduction in the amounts of various glycoproteins co-isolating as complexes with these chaperones (2Hammond C.

EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1495-1506Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Similar results were obtained with mutant cell lines that lack the glucosidases involved in producing the monoglucosylated oligosaccharide (15Balow J.P. Weissman J.D. Kearse K.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29025-29029Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 16Ora A. Helenius A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26060-26062Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). In addition, glucosidase inhibitors added after complexes with CNX or CRT were formed prevented or slowed glycoprotein dissociation, thus implicating glucosidase activity in the dissociation process (5Cannon K.S. Helenius A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7537-7544Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 6Hebert D.N. Foellmer B. Helenius A.

In contrast with the preceding results, many lines of evidence have suggested that CNX and CRT can also associate with non-native proteins via protein-protein interactions. First, several studies show that complexes between CNX and either membrane-bound or soluble glycoproteins cannot be dissociated by enzymatic removal of oligosaccharides (3Ware F.E. Vassilakos A.

Chem. 1995; 270: 2784-2790Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Second, there are several examples of CNX interacting with proteins that either lack Asn-linked oligosaccharides naturally (20Rajagopalan S. Xu Y. Brenner M.B. Science. 1994; 263: 387-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar) or have lost them through mutagenesis or under-glycosylation (21Carreno B.M. Schreiber K.L. McKean D.J. Stroynowski I. Hansen T.H. J. Immunol. 1995; 154: 5173-5180PubMed Google Scholar, 22Kim P.S. Arvan P. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 29-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 23Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21839-21844Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Third, after treatment of cells with castanospermine to block the formation of monoglucosylated oligosaccharides, CNX or CRT have been detected in association with specific glycoproteins such as invariant chain (24Zhang Q. Salter R.D. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 831-837PubMed Google Scholar), CD3δ subunit (25van Leeuwen J.E. Kearse K.P. J. Biol.

Chem. 1998; 273: 17064-17072Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Fourth, both CNX and CRT have been shown to bind specifically to nonglycosylated peptides both in vitro and in vivo (29Spee P. Subjeck J. Neefjes J. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 10559-10566Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 30Nair S. Wearsch P.A. Mitchell D.A. Wassenberg J.J. Gilboa E. Nicchitta C.V. J.

Hojrup P. Houen G. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 2945-2954Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Fifth, using purified components in vitro, it has been demonstrated that CNX and CRT are capable of functioning as molecular chaperones to suppress the aggregation and enhance the folding not only of glycoproteins bearing monoglucosylated oligosaccharides but of nonglycosylated proteins as well (33Ihara Y. Cohen-Doyle M.F. Saito Y. Williams D.B. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 331-341Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 34Saito Y. Ihara Y. Leach M.R. Cohen-Doyle M.F. Williams D.B. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6718-6729Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). Despite this accumulated information, the concept that CNX and CRT are capable of associating in vivo with unfolded proteins via polypeptide-based interactions in addition to lectin-oligosaccharide binding has been largely discounted. It has been speculated that the lack of dissociation of CNX-substrate complexes after complete deglycosylation may be due to the trapping of the two species within the same detergent micelle (1Parodi A.J. Biochem. J. 2000; 348: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar, 35Rodan A.R. Simons J.F. Trombetta E.S. Helenius A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6921-6930Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar) or that the substrate, being nonnative, might become insoluble upon dissociation (1Parodi A.J. Biochem. J. 2000; 348: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar, 35Rodan A.R. Simons J.F. Trombetta E.S. Helenius A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6921-6930Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 36Zapun A.

Similarly, it has been suggested that the association of CNX with nonglycosylated proteins in vivo may arise through nonspecific inclusion of CNX within misfolded protein aggregates (1Parodi A.J. Biochem. J. 2000; 348: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar,36Zapun A. Petrescu S.M. Rudd P.M. Dwek R.A. Thomas D.Y. Bergeron J.J.

Chem. 1996; 271: 14280-14284Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). However, apart from a single instance in which CNX was detected in association with aggregates of nonglycosylated vesicular stomatitis virus G protein (37Cannon K.S. Hebert D.N. Helenius A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14280-14284Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), there has been no direct evidence to support such speculations. Finally, the in vitro studies demonstrating direct binding of nonglycosylated peptides to CRT or the molecular chaperone functions of CNX and CRT with non-glycoproteins have been questioned in terms of their relevance to the in vivo situation (1Parodi A.J. Biochem. J. 2000; 348: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). In an effort to address the question of the existence of polypeptide-based interactions between CNX and its diverse substratesin vivo, we chose to utilize the same methodology used most commonly in previous studies to demonstrate the apparent exclusivity of lectin-oligosaccharide interactions, i.e. block the formation of monoglucosylated oligosaccharides and assess by co-immuno-isolation if complexes between diverse substrates and CNX can be detected. We reasoned that upon loss of the lectin-oligosaccharide interaction, any remaining polypeptide-based association might be too weak to survive rigorous immuno-isolation conditions. Consequently, care was taken to employ mild, yet highly specific isolation procedures. Using either pharmacologic or genetic methods to block the formation of the Glc1Man9GlcNAc2oligosaccharide in diverse cell types, we show that although many complexes were lost, a large number of CNX-substrate complexes remained readily detectable. Complementary results were also obtained using a substrate that lacked oligosaccharides through mutation of its Asn-X-(Ser/Thr) sequence. Interactions with CNX (and CRT) were maintained in the absence of any detectable aggregation. We conclude that in addition to the well established lectin-oligosaccharide interaction, polypeptide-based association does indeed exist in vivo between CNX or CRT and a diverse array of protein substrates.

Murine EL-4 thymoma cells and the human C1R cell line, that stably expresses the HLA-B27 molecule (39Anderson K.S. Cresswell P. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 675-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar) (provided by Dr. P. Cresswell, Yale University), were cultured in RPMI 1640. CHO-K1 and its glucosidase I-deficient variant CHO-Lec23 (40Ray M.K. Yang J. Sundaram S. Stanley P. J. Biol.

Stably transfectedDrosophila melanogaster Schneider cells that express CNX along with H-2Kb heavy (H) chains in the presence of mouse β2-microglobulin (41Danilczyk U.G. Cohen-Doyle M.F. Williams D.B.

All media were supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics. A rabbit antiserum (anti-8) directed against the C terminus of the H-2Kb H chain, which reacts with all conformational states of Kb, was provided by Dr. Brian Barber, University of Toronto. Antiserum UCSF#2 reacts with the cytoplasmic tail of class I HLA H chains and was provided by Dr. Frances Brodsky, Stanford University. mAb PIN1.1, which reacts with invariant chain, was obtained from Dr. Tania Watts, University of Toronto. Two rabbit antisera were used to isolate CNX. One was directed against the C-terminal 14 amino acids (anti-C-CNX), and the second was raised against the entire 462-residue ER luminal domain (anti-N-CNX). mAb 12CA5, which reacts with the influenza hemagglutinin (HA) epitope tag on CNX(HA) and the CNX 1–387(HA), mutant was provided by Dr. Paul Hamel, University of Toronto. The N-glycosylation mutants of the H-2Kb H chain were generated by mutating the consensus glycosylation sequence, Asn-X-(Ser/Thr), using the QuikChangeTM site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) and full-length H-2Kb cDNA in pcDNA3 (Invitrogen) as template. To remove the glycosylation site at residue 176, Asn-176 was changed to Lys using the mutagenic oligonucleotide (mutated base in lowercase) 5′-GC AGA TAT CTG AAG AAC GGG AAg GCG ACG CTG CTG CGC-3′. The glycosylation site at residue 86 was removed by substituting Asn-86 with Lys using 5′-C CTG CTC GGC TAC TAC AAg CAG AGC AAG GGC GGC-3′ as the mutagenic oligonucleotide. To add a glycosylation site at position 256, Tyr-256 was changed to Asn with the mutagenic oligonucleotide 5′-GGG AAG GAG CAG aAT TAC ACA TGC CAT GTG TAC C-3′. Recombinant plasmids were introduced into L cells using the SuperFectTM transfection reagent (Qiagen), and stably transfected cells were established by G418 selection. Transient expression of HA-tagged calnexin (CNX(HA) and a truncated ER luminal segment of calnexin (CNX-(1–387(HA))) in L cells was conducted as described previously (41Danilczyk U.G. Cohen-Doyle M.F. Williams D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 13089-13097Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). BW5147, PhaR2.7, CHO-K1, CHO-Lec23, or L cells at a density of 1 × 107 cells/100-mm dish were incubated in Met-free medium for 60 min at 23 °C to deplete intracellular Met pools. They were then radiolabeled at 23 °C for the times indicated in the various figure legends by the addition of 400 μCi/ml [35S]Met. Castanospermine (CAS), when added, was present throughout the prelabeling and labeling periods. Cells were lysed for 30 min at 4 °C in 1 ml of lysis buffer containing either 1% digitonin or 1% CHAPS in PBS, pH 7.4, 10 mm iodoacetamide, 60 μg/ml PefablocR (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), and 10 μg/ml each of leupeptin, antipain, and pepstatin. For isolation of CNX and associated molecules, lysates were incubated with preimmune or anti-CNX antibodies for 2 h. Immune complexes were collected for 1 h using protein A-agarose beads and analyzed by SDS-PAGE as described previously (41Danilczyk U.G. Cohen-Doyle M.F. Williams D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 13089-13097Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). For detection of calnexin-associated Kb, Db, HLA-B27, and invariant chain, digitonin lysates were subjected to sequential immunoprecipitation (42Suh W.K. Derby M.A. Cohen-Doyle M.F. Schoenhals G.J. Fruh K. Berzofsky J.A. Williams D.B. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 1530-1540PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, CNX-substrate complexes were recovered with anti-CNX antiserum, dissociated by heating at 42 °C for 1 h in 0.2% SDS, adjusted to 2% Nonidet P-40, 5% skim milk, and incubated with anti-class I H chain or anti-invariant chain antibodies. Immune complexes were collected and analyzed as above. Radiolabeling of transfected Drosophila cells with [35S]Met, lysis, and immuno-isolation was carried out as described previously (14Vassilakos A. Cohen-Doyle M.F. Peterson P.A. Jackson M.R. Williams D.B. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1495-1506Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Briefly, after induction of the metallothionein promoter with 1 mm CuSO4 for 16 h, Drosophila cells were incubated for 1 h in Met-free Schneider's medium in the presence or absence of 1 mm CAS. Cells were then radiolabeled with 0.5 mCi/ml [35S]Met for 5 min in the presence or absence of CAS and lysed in digitonin lysis buffer. Lysates were incubated with anti-class I H chain or anti-C-CNX antibodies, and immune complexes were collected on protein A-agarose followed by SDS-PAGE analysis using 10% gels (43Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar). Radioactive proteins were visualized by fluorography. L cells (1 × 107) expressing wild type or nonglycosylated H-2Kb were radiolabeled with [35S]Met for 30 min, lysed in 1 ml of 1% digitonin buffer, and centrifuged briefly at top speed in an Eppendorf microcentrifuge to remove insoluble material. A 0.5-ml aliquot of lysate was loaded onto a 12-ml, 10–40% (w/v) linear glycerol gradient prepared in digitonin buffer. The gradients were centrifuged at 4 °C for 15 h at 35,000 rpm using a Beckman SW 41 rotor. Fractions (0.75 ml) were collected from the top of the gradients, and Kb H chains were immuno-isolated from each fraction using anti-8 antiserum. As a control for the total amount of Kb molecules loaded onto the gradient, an additional 0.5-ml sample of lysate was also immuno-isolated with anti-8 antiserum. For detection of H-2Kb-CNX complexes by immunoblotting, 1 × 107 L cells expressing wild type Kb or various Kbglycosylation mutants were lysed in digitonin lysis buffer and immuno-isolated with anti-8 antiserum and protein A-agarose. After SDS-PAGE analysis, proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membrane (44Suh W.K. Cohen-Doyle M.F. Fruh K. Wang K. Peterson P.A. Williams D.B. Science. 1994; 264: 1322-1326Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar), and the membrane was incubated with rabbit anti-N-CNX antiserum at 1:5,000 dilution followed by donkey anti-rabbit IgG horseradish peroxidase conjugate at 1:10,000 dilution (Jackson Laboratories). Immune complexes were visualized using enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). To establish whether CNX associates with its substrates only via its lectin site or whether protein-protein interactions also contribute to this association, we examined the formation of CNX-substrate complexes in glucosidase I- or glucosidase II-deficient cell lines and in the presence of the glucosidase inhibitor, CAS. In an effort to minimize protein aggregation and to preserve potentially weak protein-protein interactions, metabolic radiolabeling of cells was conducted at 25 °C, and lysis was performed using the mild detergents digitonin and CHAPS. Furthermore, immune complexes were washed for the minimum number of times (typically three) required to preserve CNX-substrate interactions while minimizing recovery of nonspecifically associated proteins. Initially, the BW5147 mouse lymphoma cell line and its glucosidase II-deficient mutant, PhaR2.7, were radiolabeled with [35S]Met, and digitonin lysates were subjected to immuno-isolation with two separate anti-CNX antisera. The anti-C-CNX antibody recognizes the last 14 residues of the cytoplasmic tail of CNX, and the anti-N-CNX antibody is directed against the entire ER luminal domain (residues 1–462). As reported previously (15Balow J.P. Weissman J.D. Kearse K.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29025-29029Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 16Ora A. Helenius A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26060-26062Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), in addition to CNX, which appeared as a major band of 90 kDa, a large number of newly synthesized proteins co-isolated as complexes with CNX from the parental BW5147 cells (Fig.1A). A similar pattern of proteins was observed with the two independent anti-CNX antisera (Fig.1A, lanes 2 and 3). A substantial number of these proteins were lost or reduced in intensity in the glucosidase II-deficient PhaR2.7 cells, reflecting their apparent requirement for monoglucosylated oligosaccharides for stable association with CNX. However, it is noteworthy that many other proteins remained firmly associated with CNX (Fig. 1A,lanes 5 and 6). A similar result was obtained when parental BW5147 cells were treated with CAS to block glucosidase activity (Fig. 1A, compare lanes 2 and3 with lane 7). Indeed, the patterns of CNX-associated proteins were remarkably similar in the PhaR2.7 and CAS-treated BW5147 cells. It is conceivable that these proteins arise as a result of nonspecific interactions either with the precipitating immunoglobulins or with protein A-agarose beads. However, we consider this possibility unlikely since a similar spectrum of proteins was obtained with the two independently generated anti-CNX antibodies (containing different arrays of immune globulins), and they were absent from control isolations performed with preimmune serum and protein A-agarose beads (Fig. 1A, lanes 1 and 4). To confirm these findings, we also compared glucosidase I-deficient Lec23 cells to their parental CHO cell line (Fig. 1B). Lec23 cells have been shown to possess little or no glucosidase I activity, and no monoglucosylated oligosaccharides could be detected on glycoproteins (40Ray M.K. Yang J. Sundaram S. Stanley P. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 22818-22825Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Remarkably, despite the block in formation of monoglucosylated oligosaccharides, there was no obvious reduction in the number of CNX-associated proteins recovered with each antiserum, although some differences in the patterns of recovered proteins were apparent (Fig. 1B, compare lane 2with lane 5 and lane 3 with lane 6). Again, these proteins were absent in control isolations performed with preimmune antiserum. To further exclude the possibility that the proteins remaining associated with CNX in glucosidase-deficient cells or after CAS treatment were due to nonspecific associations with immune complexes, HA-epitope tagged CNX (CNX(HA)) and a soluble variant (CNX-(1–387(HA))) were prepared and transfected into mouse L cells. We showed previously that the CNX-(1–387(HA)) variant fails to form complexes with newly synthesized proteins (41Danilczyk U.G. Cohen-Doyle M.F. Williams D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 13089-13097Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The transfectants were radiolabeled with [35S]Met, lysed in 1% CHAPS, and subjected to immuno-isolation with anti-HA mAb. As shown in Fig.1C, lane 1, a large number of newly synthesized proteins were recovered with the anti-HA mAb from cells expressing full-length CNX(HA). Consistent with the experiments presented in Fig.1, panels A and B, many proteins were also recovered in association with CNX(HA) after treatment of cells with CAS (Fig. 1C, lane 3). In contrast, only trace levels of proteins were recovered in association with the binding-impaired CNX-(1–387(HA)) variant (Fig. 1C, lane 2). This was also the case when the CNX-(1–387(HA)) variant was isolated from CAS-treated cells (data not shown). That the CNX-(1–387(HA)) variant was recovered under identical conditions of immune isolation as the CNX(HA) construct establishes that the CNX-associated proteins remaining after CAS treatment are indeed bona fide complexes and not merely proteins nonspecifically adsorbed to anti-HA immune precipitates. Our finding that CNX remains capable of specific association with many proteins under conditions where the formation of monoglucosylated oligosaccharides is blocked contrasts with a number of previous studies. For example, Ora and Helenius (16Ora A. Helenius A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26060-26062Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) compared CNX-associated proteins in CHO versus glucosidase I-deficient Lec23 cells and showed that many fewer proteins associated with CNX in parental CHO cells than we observed and that none of these could be detected in the Lec23 mutant cells. To determine if the disparity in results arises from differences in the radiolabeling and immune isolation methods, we directly compared CNX-associated proteins in CHO and Lec23 cells using our mild conditions and those of Ora and Helenius (16Ora A. Helenius A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26060-26062Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The major differences in methodology included our radiolabeling of cells at 23 °C versus 37 °C, our use of digitoninversus CHAPS during cell lysis and washing of immune complexes, our elimination of a pre-clearance step with fixedStaphylococcus aureus cells, and our recovery of immune complexes over a 3-h period versus the overnight isolation employed by Ora and Helenius (16Ora A. Helenius A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26060-26062Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The results of this comparison are depicted in Fig. 1D. Consistent with the results presented in Fig. 1B, we observed few differences in the patterns of CNX-associated proteins recovered from CHO cells relative to glucosidase I-deficient Lec23 cells (compare lanes 2 and 4). In contrast, the procedure of Ora and Helenius (16Ora A. Helenius A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26060-26062Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed"

Rat HSCs activated in vitro express JunD, Fra2, and FosB as the predominant AP-1 DNA-binding proteins, and all three associate with an AP-1 sequence that is essential for activity of the tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases-1 (TIMP-1) promoter. In this study, we used expression vectors for wild-type, dominant-negative, and forced homodimeric (Jun/eb1 chimeric factors) forms of JunD and other Fos and Jun proteins to determine the requirement for JunD in the transcriptional regulation of the TIMP-1 and interleukin-6 (IL-6) genes. JunD activity was required for TIMP-1 gene promoter activity, whereas overexpression of Fra2 or FosB caused a repression of promoter activity. The ability of homodimeric JunD/eb1 to elevate TIMP-1 promoter activity supports a role for JunD homodimers as the major AP-1-dependent transactivators of the TIMP-1 gene. IL-6 promoter activity was induced upon activation of HSCs and also required JunD activity; however, expression of JunD/eb1 homodimers resulted in transcriptional repression. Mutagenesis of the IL-6 promoter showed that an AP-1 DNA-binding site previously reported to be an activator of transcription in fibroblasts functions as a suppressor of promoter activity in HSCs. We conclude that JunD activates IL-6 gene transcription as a heterodimer and operates at an alternative DNA-binding site in the promoter. The relevance of these findings to events occurring in the injured liver was addressed by showing that AP-1 DNA-binding complexes are induced during HSC activation and contain JunD as the predominant Jun family protein. JunD is therefore an important transcriptional regulator of genes responsive to Jun homo- and heterodimers in activated HSCs.

In response to liver injury of any etiology, the normally quiescent HSC undergoes a progressive process of trans-differentiation into a proliferating myofibroblast-like activated HSC (1Friedman S.L.

Through increased secretion of extracellular matrix proteins and the tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases (TIMP)-1 and TIMP-2, activated HSCs are responsible for deposition and accumulation of the majority of the excess extracellular matrix in the fibrotic liver (2Friedman S.L.

Furthermore, activated HSCs can contribute to the fibrogenic process through their ability to secrete and respond to a wide range of cytokines and growth factors (3Arthur M.J. Mann D.A. Iredale J.P.

These observations indicate that these inducible transcription factors are likely to play a key role in the activation and/or persistence of myofibroblast-like HSCs.

In this study, we have addressed the role of the AP-1 transcription factor JunD in the control of TIMP-1 and IL-6 gene transcription in activated HSCs. The jun family proto-oncogenes (c-jun,junB, and junD) are critical components of the AP-1 transcription factor (13Karin M. Liu Z. Zandi E. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 240-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (2324) Google Scholar, 14Ziff E.B. Genetics. 1990; 6: 69-72Scopus (189) Google Scholar). The Jun proteins are bZip transcription factors that can form either AP-1 homodimers (Jun/Jun) or AP-1 heterodimers. Jun heterodimers are created through interaction of Jun proteins with members of the related bZip protein family, notably those of the fos proto-oncogene family (c-fos,fosB, fra1, and fra2) or the ATF family (ATF2, ATF3, and ATF4) (13Karin M. Liu Z. Zandi E. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 240-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (2324) Google Scholar, 14Ziff E.B. Genetics. 1990; 6: 69-72Scopus (189) Google Scholar, 15Hai T. Curren T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 3720-3724Crossref PubMed Scopus (1119) Google Scholar). An evolutionarily conserved non-canonical AP-1 site (TGAGTAA) in the human TIMP-1 promoter is required for induction of transcription during culture activation of primary rat HSCs and binds Jun/Jun and Jun/Fos dimers (4Bahr M.J. Vincent K.J. Arthur M.J.P. Fowler A.V. Smart D.E. Wright M.C. Clark I.M. Benyon R.C. Iredale J.P. Mann D.A. Hepatology. 1999; 29: 839-848Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Western blot and electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) studies revealed that JunD is the predominant Jun family protein expressed in culture-activated rat HSCs, with little or no detectable expression of c-Jun and JunB after the first 48 h of culture. This observation indicated a role for JunD not only in the transcriptional activation of TIMP-1, but also in other AP-1-dependent regulatory processes of activated HSCs. In this study, we demonstrate that JunD is required for high level activity of both the TIMP-1 and IL-6 promoters in activated HSCs. We also show that expression of different combinations of AP-1 proteins leads to differential effects on transcription and that the repressive or stimulatory effects induced by Jun/Jun and Jun/Fos dimers are dependent on the target promoter. HSCs were isolated from the livers of normal male Sprague-Dawley rats (400 ± 50 g) by sequential perfusion with Pronase and collagenase as previously described (16Iredale J.P. Benyon R.C. Arthur M.J.P. Ferris W.F. Alcolado R. Winwood P.J. Clark N. Murphy G. Hepatology. 1996; 24: 176-184Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Induction of acute liver damage in rats was achieved by intraperitoneal injection of a 1:1 ratio of CCl4 (0.2 ml/100 g of body weight) and olive oil as previously described (16Iredale J.P. Benyon R.C. Arthur M.J.P. Ferris W.F. Alcolado R. Winwood P.J. Clark N. Murphy G. Hepatology. 1996; 24: 176-184Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Control rats were administered an intraperitoneal injection of olive oil alone. HSCs were separated from the cell suspension over an 11.5% Optiprep gradient (Nycomed Pharma AS, Oslo, Sweden), followed by elution. HSCs were seeded onto plastic, cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 16% fetal calf serum (Life Technologies, Inc.), and maintained at 37 °C in an atmosphere of 5% CO2. All plasmid DNA was prepared using a commercial DNA extraction and isolation kit (Maxiprep, QIAGEN). A chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) reporter plasmid (pTIMP1) containing a 162-bp minimal human TIMP-1 promoter cloned into theHindIII and PstI sites of pBLCAT3 was used to determine TIMP-1 promoter function (4Bahr M.J.

The controlRenilla luciferase vector pRL-TK was purchased from Promega(Southampton, United Kingdom). Expression vectors for mouse Jun (pCMV2-c-Jun, pCMV2-JunB, and pCMV2-JunD) and Fos (pCMV2-c-Fos, pCMV2-FosB, pCMV2-Fra1, and pCMV2-Fra2) were a kind gift of Dr. Paul Dobner and are as described by Harrison et al.

Nuclear extracts were prepared from HSCs by a protocol modified from that described by Dignamet al. (21Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9164) Google Scholar). Harvested cells were washed twice in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) prior to lysis in Buffer A (21Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G.

Lysates were centrifuged for 10 s at 13,000 rpm to collect crude nuclear pellets. Supernatants were discarded, and pellets were washed twice in lysis buffer prior to resuspension in Buffer C (21Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9164) Google Scholar) supplemented with 0.5 mm4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride, 0.2 mm EDTA, and 15 μg/ml aprotinin. After a 10-min incubation on ice with occasional vortexing, the extracts were cleared of insoluble nuclear material by centrifugation at 13,000 rpm for 30 s. Cleared nuclear extracts were transferred to fresh Eppendorf tubes, and their protein content was determined using the Bradford DC assay kit (Bio-Rad). EMSA reactions were assembled on ice and consisted of an initial 10-min incubation of 4 μl of Buffer C containing 5 μg of nuclear protein extract and 12 μl of water containing 2 μg of poly(dI·dC). 4 μl of water containing 0.4 ng of radiolabeled double-stranded AP-1 probe was then added to the reaction and, after mixing, was incubated for a further 20 min. For supershift assays, reactions were incubated for a further 16 h in the presence of 1 μg of anti-Jun antiserum (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.). EMSA and supershift reaction mixtures were then resolved by electrophoresis on an 8% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel (37:5:1). Whole cell protein extracts were prepared by lysis of PBS-washed cultures in 60 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 2% (w/v) SDS, 10% (v/v) glycerol, and 5% (v/v) 2-mercaptoethanol. Equal quantities (10 μg) of whole cell extract were then fractionated by electrophoresis through a 12.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Gels were run at a 20-mA constant current for 1.5 h prior to transfer onto nitrocellulose as previously described (4Bahr M.J. Vincent K.J. Arthur M.J.P. Fowler A.V. Smart D.E. Wright M.C. Clark I.M.

Following blockade of nonspecific protein binding, nitrocellulose blots were incubated for 2 h with primary antibodies (diluted in PBS/Tween 20 (0.05%)) containing 5% Marvel. Rabbit polyclonal antibody recognizing JunD (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) was used at a 1:100 dilution. Blots were then washed twice in PBS/Tween 20 prior to incubation for 1 h with sheep anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase antibody (1:2000) and after extensive washing in PBS/Tween 20 before being processed to distilled water for detection of antigen using the ECL system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Buckinghamshire, United Kingdom). 3.2 μg of RNA extracted from freshly isolated and 7-day culture-activated rat HSCs was used to generate first-strand cDNA using a random hexamer primer (oligo(dN)6). PCR amplification of rat IL-6 and β-actin cDNAs was carried out using specific oligonucleotide primers selected within the coding regions of the rat genes. IL-6 primers used were 5′-CCACCCACAACAGACCAGTAT-3′ (sense) and 5′-TCCAGAAGACCAGAGCAGATT-3′ (antisense) and were designed to amplify sequences located between nucleotides 180 and 421 of the rat IL-6 cDNA. Primers used for detection of β-actin were 5′-AGAGGGAAATCGTGCGTGACA-3′ (sense) and 5′-ACATCTGCTGGAAGGTGGACA-3′ (antisense) and were designed to produce a 350-bp product. PCRs were composed of 1 μl of cDNA template, 100 ng each of sense and antisense oligonucleotide primers, 2.5 μl of optimized TaqPCR buffer (Promega), 0.4 mm dNTP mixture, and 2 units ofTaq polymerase in a total reaction volume of 25 μl. Following an initial 5-min incubation at 94 °C, PCRs were performed using a 1-min annealing step (at 51.5 °C for IL-6 and 57.0 °C for β-actin), followed by a 2-min elongation step at 72.0 °C and a 30-s denaturation step at 94 °C. A total number of 28 and 30 PCR cycles were carried out for detection of β-actin and IL-6, respectively, followed by a final elongation reaction for 10 min at 72.0 °C. PCR products were separated by electrophoresis at 80 V for 60 min through a 1% agarose gel and were detected by ethidium bromide staining. Expected sizes of specific PCR products (241 bp for IL-6 and 350 bp for β-actin) were verified by reference to a 1-kilobase DNA ladder, and sequence identity of the IL-6 product was confirmed by DNA sequence analysis. HSCs were transfected by the non-liposomal Effectene protocol (QIAGEN) according to the manufacturer's instructions. CAT assays were performed as previously described (4Bahr M.J. Vincent K.J.

IL-6 promoter-driven expression of firefly luciferase was normalized by reference to the level of activity of a cotransfectedRenilla luciferase vector. TIMP-1 promoter function in activated HSCs is dependent on an intact AP-1 site that binds JunD (4Bahr M.J. Vincent K.J. Arthur M.J.P. Fowler A.V. Smart D.E. Wright M.C. Clark I.M. Benyon R.C. Iredale J.P. Mann D.A. Hepatology. 1999; 29: 839-848Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). To determine the influence of JunD on the activity of the TIMP-1 promoter, rat HSCs were culture-activated for a minimum of 7 days prior to cotransfection with a human TIMP-1-CAT reporter (pTIMP1) and expression vectors for c-Jun, JunB, and JunD. Overexpression of JunD in activated rat HSCs resulted in a 2.5-fold enhancement of TIMP-1 promoter activity that was reproducible in replicate experiments (Fig.1 A). In contrast, overexpression of c-Jun or JunB resulted in a 2-fold or greater inhibition of TIMP-1 promoter activity. Overexpression of JunD failed to enhance the activity of a TIMP-1 promoter lacking an AP-1 site and did not alter the low activity of the TIMP-1 promoter in freshly isolated HSCs (data not shown). We next determined if the endogenous JunD activity expressed in activated rat HSCs is required for TIMP-1 gene transcription. Activated HSCs were cotransfected with pTIMP1 and a vector (RSVβ-JunD) producing expression of a mutant JunD protein lacking a functional transactivation domain (20Reid S. Jager C. Jeffers M. Vande Woude G.F. Graeff H. Schmitt M. Lengyel E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16377-16386Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1 B, RSVβ-JunD expression resulted in a profound inhibition of TIMP-1 promoter activity, with levels of transcription that were only marginally higher than those observed with pBLCAT3, which lacks a promoter. We have previously reported that culture-activated HSCs express JunD together with Fra2 and FosB (4Bahr M.J. Vincent K.J. Arthur M.J.P. Fowler A.V. Smart D.E. Wright M.C. Clark I.M. Benyon R.C. Iredale J.P. Mann D.A. Hepatology. 1999; 29: 839-848Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). To assess the role of Fos family proteins in the transcriptional control of the TIMP-1 gene, we cotransfected activated HSCs with pTIMP1 and expression vectors for c-Fos, FosB, Fra1, and Fra2 (Fig.2). Overexpression c-Fos or Fra1 caused a moderate reduction of promoter activity that lacked statistical significance; by contrast, overexpression of FosB or Fra2 resulted in a significant 2-fold repression of transcription. As activation of rat HSCs is accompanied by induction of FosB and Fra2 expression (4Bahr M.J. Vincent K.J. Arthur M.J.P. Fowler A.V. Smart D.E. Wright M.C. Clark I.M. Benyon R.C. Iredale J.P. Mann D.A. Hepatology. 1999; 29: 839-848Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), it is possible that changes in the activity of these Fos proteins serve to fine-tune TIMP-1 transcription by forming AP-1 dimers that are less active than JunD homodimers. It was therefore of interest to establish if JunD homodimers are able to influence TIMP-1 promoter activity. Activated HSCs were cotransfected with pTIMP1 and a vector (JunD/eb1) that drives expression of a JunD protein in which the JunD dimerization domain is replaced with the dimerization domain from the Epstein-Barr virus EB1 transcription factor (19Vandel L. Montreau N. Vial E. Pfarr C.M. Binetruy B. Castellazzi M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1881-1888Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). This mutant JunD protein is able to form transcriptionally active homodimers, but cannot form dimers with endogenous wild-type JunD, Fra2, or FosB. Expression of JunD/eb1 substantially enhanced TIMP-1 promoter function, generating a 4-fold higher level of CAT activity relative to cells transfected with a control empty expression vector (Fig.3 A). Hence, JunD/eb1 is a powerful positive regulator of TIMP-1 promoter function, and the data suggest that JunD homodimers are stronger AP-1 transactivators than JunD/Fra2 or JunD/FosB heterodimers. As Fra2 can also negatively regulate c-Jun activity (22Suzuki T. Okuno H. Yoshida T. Endo T. Nishina H. Iba H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 5537-5542Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar, 23Sonobe M.H. Yoshida T. Murakami M. Kameda T. Iba H. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 689-696PubMed Google Scholar) and can form heterodimers with JunB that act as transcriptional repressors in keratinocytes (24Rutberg S.E. Saez E. Lo S. Jang S.-I. Markova N. Spiegelmann B.M. Yuspa S.H. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 1337-1346Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), it was conceivable that the negative influence of c-Jun and JunB on TIMP-1 promoter function in HSCs may arise from formation of repressive Jun/Fra2 heterodimers. We therefore determined the ability of c-Jun/eb1 and JunB/eb1 dimers to attenuate TIMP-1 promoter activity (Fig.3 B). In contrast to wild-type c-Jun, overexpression of the c-Jun/eb1 homodimer enhanced TIMP-1 promoter activity by 2-fold; however, overexpression of a JunB/eb1 dimer resulted in only a weak and statistically insignificant elevation of transcription.Figure 3Effects of expression of Jun/eb1 homodimers on TIMP-1 promoter activity in activated rat HSCs. 7-Day culture-activated rat HSCs were cotransfected with 1 μg of pTIMP1 and 3 μg of empty vector pDP7 (Control) or a pDP7-derived vector carrying a junD/eb1 fusion gene ( A) or 3 μg of empty vector pDP7 (Control) or a pDP7-derived vector carrying c-jun/eb1 or junB/eb1fusion genes (B).

Although the molecular details of the involvement of G-proteins in cell differentiation have yet to be elucidated, the associated change in G-protein concentration provides an excellent model for exploring the molecular regulation of the expression of the G-proteins themselves. Furthermore, the mechanism by which any cell differentiation inducing agent alters G-protein levels is not known. Sodium butyrate-induced differentiation of K562 cells is accompanied by a 3–4-fold increase in the mRNA levels for Gαi2 (7Davis M.G. Kawai Y. Arinze I.J. Biochem. J. 2000; 346: 455-461Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting transcriptional activation of this gene during differentiation. The gene for Gαi2, which contains no TATA box, was isolated several years ago (16Weinstein L.S. Spiegel A.M. Carter A.D. FEBS Lett. 1988; 232: 333-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 17Weinstein L.S. Kats I. Spiegel A.M. Carter A.D. Mol. Endocrinol. 1990; 4: 958-964Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). There are reports that elevation of cAMP has a stimulatory effect on the Gαi2 gene promoter (18Kinane T.B. Shang C. Finder J.D. Ercolani L. J. Biol.

Apart from these reports, there has been no other study addressing the molecular regulation of the transcription of this gene (24Morris A.J. Malbon C.C. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 1373-1430Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar). Here we have used K562 cells to explore the DNA sequence elements and/or transcription factor(s) involved in the sodium butyrate-induced expression of the gene for Gαi2. We found that sodium butyrate can strongly activate transcription from the Gαi2 promoter and that Sp1 sites at −50/−36 and −92/−85, relative to the putative transcription start site, are involved in this activation. GC-rich binding sites for Sp1 have previously been found in numerous promoters that drive the expression of genes involved in the regulation of a variety of cell functions, including differentiation, proliferation, apoptosis, metabolism, and secretion (25Liu C. Calogero A. Ragona G. Adamson E. Mercola D. Crit. Rev. Oncog. 1996; 7: 101-125Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Sp1 sites are ubiquitous in mammalian genes. Mice that are homozygous for deletion in the gene for Sp1 exhibit several embryonic malformations and often die during development (26Marin M. Karis A. Visser P. Grosveld F. Phillipsen S. Cell. 1997; 89: 619-628Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar). Our finding that Sp1 sites mediate the sodium butyrate-induced transcription from the Gαi2 promoter adds this promoter to a small but growing list of butyrate-regulated genes, including the galectin-1 gene (13Lu Y. Lotan R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1444: 85-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), the WAF1/Cip1 gene (12Nakano K. Mizuno T. Sowa Y. Orita T. Yoshino T. Okuyama Y. Fugita T.

Chem. 1999; 274: 7501-7507Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), for which Sp1 sites have been shown to be targets of the sodium butyrate effect. Inhibition of the MAPKs by specific inhibitors, depletion of the expression of endogenous ERK with an antisense oligonucleotide to ERK, and transfection with plasmids containing genes for constitutively activated ERKs demonstrated that the sodium butyrate effect requires the MEK-ERK signal transduction pathway and does not involve JNK or p38 MAPKs. Sodium butyrate, protease inhibitor mixture, hydroxyurea, and trichostatin A were purchased from the Sigma Chemical Company (St. Louis, MO). Restriction enzymes, T4 DNA ligase, DNA polymerase I (large fragment), and Klenow fragment were purchased from New England Biolabs Inc. (Beverly, MA). Plasmid pGL3-basic, Sp1 oligonucleotide, anti-ACTIVE MAPK antibody, anti-ACTIVE p38 antibody, cell culture lysis reagent, and the MAPK inhibitors, U0126 and SB 203580, were purchased from Promega (Madison, WI). PD 169316 was purchased from Calbiochem-Novabiochem Corp. (La Jolla, CA). Antisense oligonucleotide (5′-GCCGCCGCCGCCGCCAT-3′) to ERK and HC toxin were purchased from Biomol (Plymouth Meeting, PA). Anti-Sp1 antibody was a product of Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). A plasmid containing the full-length Gαi2 promoter sequence (−1214/+115), linked to chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene (16Weinstein L.S. Spiegel A.M. Carter A.D. FEBS Lett. 1988; 232: 333-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar,17Weinstein L.S. Kats I. Spiegel A.M. Carter A.D. Mol. Endocrinol. 1990; 4: 958-964Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar) was a gift from Dr. Lee Weinstein (National Institutes of Health). Plasmids harboring genes for constitutively activated ERKs (pCHA-ERK1 and pcDNA3-ERK2) as well as empty vectors (pCHA and pcDNA3) used to clone these genes were gifts from Dr. Michael J. Weber (University of Virginia, Charlottesville). Plasmid Mini and Qiafilter Midi Kits were products of Qiagen Inc. (Valencia, CA). Poly(dI-dC)·(dI-dC) was purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech(Piscataway, NJ). [α-32P]dCTP (3,000 Ci/mmol) was purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences (Boston, MA). QuickChange Mutagenesis kit was purchased from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA). Slide-A-Lyzer Dialysis Cassette was purchased from Pierce. FuGENE-6 transfection reagent was purchased from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. Oligonucleotide primers and oligonucleotides were purchased fromPromega (Madison, WI), and from Integrated DNA Technologies, Inc. (Coralville, IA). The sources of all other chemicals and reagents have been described previously (7Davis M.G. Kawai Y. Arinze I.J. Biochem. J. 2000; 346: 455-461Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A sequence (−1214/+115) containing Gαi2 full-length promoter was removed from a plasmid consisting of Gαi2 promoter linked to the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase structural gene (obtained as a gift from Dr. Lee Weinstein), by using appropriate restriction enzymes (KpnI and SmaI). The resulting fragment was sub-cloned into pGL3-basic containing the luciferase gene to generate pGαi2(−1214/+115)-luc. This plasmid was then used to generate the five truncations of the Gαi2 promoter shown in Fig. 1. The −1214/−784, −236/+115 and −1214/−784, −717/+115 truncations were made by digesting pGαi2(−1214/+115)-luc with SmaI and religating. The −667/+115 modification was made by deleting part (−1214/−668) of the full-length promoter with restriction enzymeXmnI; −184/+115 was generated by deleting thePstI fragment from the full-length promoter; and −79/+115 was made by sub-cloning the NcoI/Tsp45I fragment (251 base pairs) into pGL3-basic, usingNcoI/SmaI. After amplification in bacteria grown in LB medium, all plasmids were isolated with Plasmid Mini or Qiafilter Midi Kits (Qiagen, Inc.), checked for purity by the ratio of absorbance at 260/280 nm, and after separation of the DNA by electrophoresis on 0.8% agarose gels, followed by visualization under UV light. The truncations in the Gαi2 promoter were confirmed by restriction enzyme digestion. Specific nucleotides in the full-length Gαi2 gene promoter were mutated or deleted by using the QuickChange Mutagenesis kit purchased from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA). Briefly, a pair of primers (GGAGCGGAGTGGGTCTTTCGGGGCCGAGCC) was used to mutate the putative Sp1-binding site (+68/+75, GGGCGGGG), designated as site 1, to generate mutant pM1 (see M series in Fig. 2). To generate mutant pM2, a different pair of primers (CCCCACCCCCGAACCGCCCCGCCG) was used to mutate the putative Sp1-binding site (−50/−36, CCCCCGGCCCGCCCC), designated as site 2; this site contains an overlapping pair of consensus Sp1 sequence motifs. Another pair of primers (CCTGCAAGCACGAACCGGCCCAGTCACAGG) was used to mutate the putative Sp1-binding site (−92/−85, CCCGCCCC), designated as site 3. The underlined nucleotides were introduced into the mutant constructs, using the QuickChange Mutagenesis kit from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA). The double mutants designated as pM1,2 and pM1,3 were made by starting the mutation protocol with pM1; the double mutant designated as pM2,3 was made by starting the mutation protocol with pM2. The mutant designated pM1,2,3 was made from pM1,2. For deletions, the sequence CCCCCGGCCCGCCCCGC (−50/−34), which contains the putative Sp1-binding site 2 (−50/−36), was deleted from the construct pGαi2(−1214/+115)-luc, to generate pD2. The sequence GCCCCGCCTGCAAGCCCGCCCCG (−106/−84), which contains the putative Sp1-binding site 3 (−92/−85), was deleted from pGαi2(−1214/+115)-luc to generate pD3. Both sequences were absent in the double deletion mutant pD2,3; this mutant was derived from pD2. The plasmids resulting from the seven different substitution mutations and three deletions were isolated, and the substitutions/deletions were confirmed by restriction digestion and by DNA sequencing. DNA sequencing was performed by the Case Western Reserve University Molecular Biology Core Laboratory. K562 cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA) and maintained in culture as described previously (7Davis M.G. Kawai Y. Arinze I.J. Biochem. J. 2000; 346: 455-461Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, the cells (1 × 105 cells in 1 ml of medium/well) were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics (50 units of penicillin and 50 µg of streptomycin per ml) at 37 °C in 95% air, 5% CO2 atmosphere in 24-well plates for 24 h before transfection. The cells were then transfected with plasmid DNA (0.5 µg containing the Gαi2 promoter construct or mutant) and 1.5 µl of FuGENE-6 transfection reagent (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) for 1 h, followed by addition of sodium butyrate or other cell differentiation inducers. Co-transfections with antisense oligonucleotide to ERK or with plasmids containing genes for constitutively activated ERKs were similarly carried out by appropriately adjusting the amount of DNA/oligonucleotide and the FuGENE-6 transfection reagent. When used, inhibitors (i.e.U0126, PD 169316, or SB 203580) were added 30 min prior to the addition of cell differentiation inducers. After 24 h, the cells were harvested by centrifuging (12,000 × g, 45 s) in 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tubes and washed once with 1× PBS, pH 7.4. The cell pellets were lysed with 150 µl of 1× Cell Culture Lysis Reagent (Promega, Madison, WI). After centrifugation for 2 min to remove cell debris, the luciferase activity and protein content of the cell extracts were measured. For luciferase activity, 10 µl of the extracts were used to measure the integrated light units over 10 s, using the luciferase assay system (Promega, Madison, WI) and a luminometer (Tropix, Inc., Bedford, MA), as recommended by the manufacturers. The protein content of the extracts was determined by the Bradford protein assay method (Bio-Rad), using bovine serum albumin as a standard. The general procedure outlined by Dignam et al. (27Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9132) Google Scholar) was followed, with several modifications. Essentially, 1 × 107 cells were transferred to a 15-ml conical bottom tube and centrifuged (500 ×g) in a clinical centrifuge for 1.5 min. The resulting pellet was washed by resuspension in 5 ml of ice-cold 1× PBS and recentrifuged; the recovered pellet was resuspended in 1 ml of ice-cold 1× PBS, transferred to a 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tube, and centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 15 s to pellet the cells. The pelleted cells were resuspended in 100 µl of buffer A, containing 10 mm Hepes-KOH (pH 7.9), 1.5 mmMgCl2, 10 mm KCl, 0.5 mm DTT, 0.5 mm PMSF, and freshly added 10 µl of protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma), and gently mixed with a pipette. After 15 min of incubation on ice, the cells were lysed by adding a 2% solution of Nonidet P-40 to achieve a final detergent concentration of 0.05%, followed by pipetting up and down 5 times to mix the solution. The solution was centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 20 s to obtain nuclei (pellet). This pellet was then resuspended in 100 µl of ice-cold buffer B, containing 20 mm Hepes-KOH (pH 7.9), 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm KCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm DTT, 0.2 mm PMSF, 25% glycerol, and 5 µl of protease inhibitor mixture as in buffer A, and placed in ice for 5 min. DTT, PMSF, and protease inhibitors were added just before use. To lyse the nuclei, buffer C (0.9 mKCl) was then added dropwise (about 50 µl) to achieve a final concentration of 0.3 m KCl. The mixture was placed on ice for 30 min with occasional gentle shaking and then centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C to obtain the nuclear extract (supernatant). This extract was then dialyzed against 100 volumes of buffer D (dialysis buffer) for 2 h at 4 °C, using Slide-A-Lyzer Dialysis Cassette purchased from Pierce. Buffer D (modified from Khana-Gupta et al. (28Khana-Gupta A. Zibello T. Simkevich C. Rosmarin A.G. Berliner N. Blood. 2000; 95: 3734-3741Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)) contained 20 mm Hepes-KOH (pH 7.9), 100 mm KCl, 0.5 mm DTT, 0.2 mm PMSF, 20% glycerol, and 10 µl of protease inhibitor mixture per 100 ml. The dialyzed nuclear extract was recovered into a 1.5-ml tube and centrifuged at 12,000 ×g for 20 min to remove precipitations. The protein concentration of the supernatant solution (nuclear extract) was measured, using the Bradford protein assay method (Bio-Rad), and 40-µl aliquots containing 0.7 µg of protein/µl were stored at −70 °C until used for electrophoretic mobility shift assays. Annealed 5′-overhang oligonucleotides containing the sequence between −51/−34 and −45/−29 of the full-length Gαi2 gene promoter (ACCCCCGGCCCGCCCCGC and CGACGGCGGGGCGGGCC) were labeled with [α-32P]dCTP, using the Klenow fragment (3′ → 5′ exo−) (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA). The underlined nucleotides represent the overhangs. The reaction mixture (20 µl) contained 2 µl of 10× EcoPol Buffer (New England Biolabs), 3.5 pmol of oligonucleotide, 10 µCi of [α-32P]dCTP, 2 units of Klenow fragment, and 2 µl of 10× dNTP mix (dGTP, 500 µm; dCTP, 60 µm; dATP, 200 µm; dTTP, 250 µm). The reaction was allowed to proceed for 30 min at 25 °C and then stopped with 2 µl of 0.2m EDTA (pH 8.0). The labeled probe was purified by passing the reaction mixture through a Sephadex G-25 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The reaction mixture (25 µl) for the EMSA contained 5 µl of an EMSA 5× buffer from Promega (Madison, WI), 5 µg of nuclear extract protein, 0.2 µg of poly(dI-dC)·(dI-dC) (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and 20,000 cpm of the labeled oligonucleotide probe with or without competitors, as indicated in Fig. 3. The reaction was carried out at 25 °C for 20 min, and the product of the reaction was resolved by electrophoresis on a 4% non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel. After electrophoresis, the gel was dried and then exposed to a phosphorscreen for 24 h or less and visualized on a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics, Inc., Sunnyvale, CA). For measurement of Gαi2 levels, K562 cells (1 × 106) were preincubated with or without 20 µmU0126 for 30 min and then treated with 2.5 mm sodium butyrate for 24 h. The cells were washed twice with PBS and lysed for 20 min on ice, with a lysis buffer composed of 10 mmTris/HCl (pH 7.5), 1 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, 4 mm MgCl2, 10 mm NaF, 5 mm DTT, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 2 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 µm leupeptin, 3 mm benzamidine, 0.1 unit/ml aprotinin, and 0.1 mm PMSF. The lysed cells were centrifuged at 6,700 ×g in a microcentrifuge for 10 min, and the supernatant solution (whole-cell lysates) was used for analysis of Gαi2 by immunoblotting as described previously (7Davis M.G. Kawai Y. Arinze I.J. Biochem. J. 2000; 346: 455-461Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For MAPK activation, K562 cells (5 × 105) were preincubated with or without 20 µm U0126 for 30 min and then treated with 2.5 mm sodium butyrate for various times up to 120 min. The cells were washed twice with cold PBS containing 1 mm sodium orthovanadate and then lysed as described above. Whole-cell lysates were then subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and separated proteins were transferred to Immobilon-P membranes as described previously (7Davis M.G. Kawai Y. Arinze I.J. Biochem. J. 2000; 346: 455-461Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Phospho-ERKs and phospho-p38 MAPK were analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-ACTIVE ERK antibody (1:2,500 dilution) and anti-ACTIVE p38 antibody (1:2,000 dilution), respectively, using 40 µg of cell-lysate protein. About 2 µg of cell-lysate protein were used for blotting for total ERK (non-phosphorylated ERK). Bands were detected by chemiluminescence (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Sodium butyrate increases Gαi2 levels in differentiating K562 cells (7Davis M.G. Kawai Y. Arinze I.J. Biochem. J. 2000; 346: 455-461Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To understand further the molecular mechanism underlying the effect of sodium butyrate on Gαi2 gene expression, we used a reporter gene assay to monitor transcription. When a plasmid containing the full-length Gαi2 gene promoter linked to a luciferase reporter gene (pGαi2(−1214/+115)-luc) was transfected into K562 cells, the addition of sodium butyrate led to a 15.5-fold increase in transcription from this promoter compared with cells that were not treated with sodium butyrate (TableI). To decipher whether the increase in transcription from the Gαi2 gene promoter can be triggered by the differentiation process per se, the effects of various erythroid differentiation inducers (29McCaffrey P.G. Newsome D.A. Fibach E. Yoshida M. Su M.S.-S. Blood. 1997; 90: 2075-2083Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 30Adunyah S.E. Chander R. Barner V.K. Cooper R.S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1263: 123-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) were tested; erythroid differentiation was verified by measuring induction of hemoglobin (7Davis M.G. Kawai Y. Arinze I.J. Biochem. J. 2000; 346: 455-461Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) as a differentiation marker. As can be seen from Table I, HC toxin and trichostatin A (at low concentrations) caused a 4–5-fold increase in transcription from this promoter, whereas hydroxyurea, another potent erythroid differentiation inducer, had no effect on transcription. Interestingly, treatment with the phorbol ester, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (10 nm), which causes these cells to differentiate toward monocytic and megakaryocytic lineages (31Racke F.K.

These results indicate that although the increase in transcription from the Gαi2 gene promoter can be triggered by the differentiation process per se, the effect is inducer-specific.Table IEffect of inducers of erythroid and megakaryocytic differentiation on Gαi2 promoter activity in K562 cellsAdditionHemoglobin contentGαi2promoter activitypg/cell-Fold change-fold stimulationErythroid differentiation inducerNone0.41 ± 0.03 (9)1.01.0 (8)Sodium butyrate, 2.5 mm0.67 ± 0.04 (9)1.615.5 ± 1.3 (8)Hydroxyurea, 250 µm0.91 ± 0.07 (4)2.20.9 ± 0.1 (6)HC toxin, 10 nm0.67 ± 0.04 (5)1.64.7 ± 0.4 (7)HC toxin, 40 nm10.0 ± 1.0 (9)Trichostatin A, 66 nm0.72 ± 0.04 (5)1.84.4 ± 0.9 (4)Megakaryocyte differentiation inducerPMA, 10 nm43.7 ± 4.0 (6)K562 cells were seeded in 24-well plates (1 × 105 cells per well in 1 ml of medium) and cultured for 24 h as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Erythroid differentiation was determined 24 h after the addition of inducers, as the induction of hemoglobin expression (7Davis M.G.

The cells were harvested for luciferase assay 24 h later. Each condition was replicated four times for the number of separate cell cultures indicated in parentheses.

https://openalex.org/W2134428146,"Genetic alteration of one or more components of the p16INK4A-CDK4,6/cyclin D-retinoblastoma pathway is found in more than half of all human cancers. Therefore, CDK4 is an attractive target for the development of a novel anticancer agent. However, it is difficult to make CDK4-specific inhibitors that do not possess activity for other kinases, especially CDK2, because the CDK family has high structural homology. The three-dimensional structure of CDK2, particularly that bound with the inhibitor, has provided useful information for the synthesis of CDK2-specific inhibitors. The same approach used to make CDK4-specific inhibitors was hindered by the failure to obtain a crystal structure of CDK4. To overcome this problem, we synthesized a CDK4 mimic CDK2 protein in which the ATP binding pocket of CDK2 was replaced with that of CDK4. This CDK4 mimic CDK2 was crystallized both in the free and inhibitor-bound form. The structural information thus obtained was found to be useful for synthesis of a CDK4-specific inhibitor that does not have substantial CDK2 activity. Namely, the data suggest that CDK4 has additional space that will accommodate a large substituent such as the CDK4 selective inhibitor. Inhibitors designed to bind into this large cavity should be selective for CDK4 without having substantial CDK2 activity. This design principle was confirmed in the x-ray crystal structure of the CDK4 mimic CDK2 with a new CDK4 selective inhibitor bound.

Namely, the data suggest that CDK4 has additional space that will accommodate a large substituent such as the CDK4 selective inhibitor. Inhibitors designed to bind into this large cavity should be selective for CDK4 without having substantial CDK2 activity. This design principle was confirmed in the x-ray crystal structure of the CDK4 mimic CDK2 with a new CDK4 selective inhibitor bound. cyclin-dependent kinase N′-(pyrrolidino[2,1-b]isoindolin-4-on-8-yl)-N-(pyridin-2yl)urea N′-(pyrrolidino[2,1-b]isoindolin-4-on-8-yl)-N-(5-(pyrrolidin-2-yl)pyrazol-3-yl)urea root mean square The cyclin-dependent protein kinases (CDKs)1 are regulators of the timing and coordination of eukaryotic cell cycle events (1Norbury C.

Under normal conditions, phosphorylation of pRB by the CDK4 or CDK6 in complex with one of the D-type cyclins is required for G1-S transition. The INK4 family of proteins, such as p16INK4A, specifically inhibit CDK4,6-cyclin D complexes and thus play a key role in inhibiting the G1 to S cell cycle transition. Alterations in one or more components of the p16-CDK4,6/cyclin D-retinoblastoma pathway are found in more than half of all human cancers. For example, cyclin D1 overexpression, loss of function of p16INK4A, and Rb alterations have all been found in human tumors. The universal involvement of the Rb pathway in human tumors has motivated the development of compounds specific for CDK4,6.Small molecular CDK inhibitors have already been identified; the purine-based olomoucine (18Glab N. Labidi B. Qin L.X. Trehin C. Bergounioux C. Meijer L. FEBS Lett. 1994; 353: 207-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar) and its analogues, butyrolactone (19Kitagawa M. Okabe T. Ogino H.

Commun. 1994; 201: 589-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). Flavopiridol has been shown to have growth inhibitory activity against a number of tumor types in vitroand in vivo (21Carlson B.A. Dubay M.M. Sausville E.A. Brizuela L. Worland P.J. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 2973-2978PubMed Google Scholar). Flavopiridol is now in clinical trials as an anticancer drug (22Kelland L.R. Expert Opin. Invest. Drugs. 2000; 9: 2903-2911Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 23Senderowicz A.M. Invest. New Drugs. 1999; 17: 313-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). However, flavopiridol is not selective for CDK4; it also inhibits CDK2 to the same extent as CDK4. This low selectivity of flavopiridol may cause serious adverse effects. Thus it is desirable to have more potent and selective CDK4 inhibitors as second generation anticancer agents.Three-dimensional structural information on the protein-inhibitor complex would be useful for the development of a potent and selective inhibitor. The crystal structures of CDK2 bound with inhibitors have been reported (24De Azevedo Jr., W.F. Mueller-Dieckmann H.J. Schulze-Gahmen U. Worland P.J. Sausville E. Kim S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.

To obtain CDK4-specific inhibitors, we adopted a similar approach, starting from the lead generation, using the structure of the ATP binding pocket of CDK2 as a guide. Of the many compounds chemically synthesized, some turned out to be potent CDK4 inhibitors, as represented by compound I. However, these compounds showed almost the same inhibitory activity against CDK2, although they showed negligible activity against other protein kinases. Obviously structural information on CDK4 was needed. However, we could not obtain CDK4 crystals for x-ray crystallography despite tremendous efforts. To overcome this problem, we made a mutant of CDK2 that possesses the same amino acid sequence as CDK4 in the region of the ATP binding pocket but contains the same sequence as CDK2 in other regions. This mutant protein, called CDK4 mimic CDK2 gave good crystals for x-ray analysis. The structure of the ATP binding pocket of the CDK4 mimic CDK2 protein showed an important difference from that of wild-type CDK2, which turned out to be very useful for the development of a CDK4-specific inhibitor, compound II.DISCUSSIONCDK4 mimic CDK2:CDK2 substitution of the amino acid sequence in the ATP binding pocket with that of CDK4 has been quite useful for structural determination of the protein in order to elucidate its mechanism of kinase specificity. This mutant CDK2, called CDK4 mimic CDK2, was well expressed in Sf9 cells similar to wild-type CDK2, was subsequently purified to homogeneity, and gave good crystals for x-ray crystallographic analysis. Structural comparisons of CDK2 with that of CDK4 mimic CDK2 complexed with a non-selective CDK inhibitor suggested that CDK4 has additional space that will accommodate large substituents on the inhibitors. Based on these findings, we were able to synthesize CDK4 selective inhibitors represented by compound II. In fact, subsequent crystallographic analysis of the CDK4 mimic CDK2 complexed with compound II revealed that compound II fits well into the ATP binding pocket. The additional side chain, however, interferes with the interaction of compound II in the ATP binding pocket of CDK2. This very likely accounts for compound II-CDK4 inhibitory selectivity. In conclusion, comparison of the structures of CDK2 and CDK4 mimic CDK2 has proven to be effective for the development of a CDK4-specific inhibitor. This approach should be useful for the development of a next generation CDK4-specific inhibitor with much improved properties.For development of an anticancer agent, inhibitors should exhibit inhibitory effects both in vitro and in vivo. We tested the growth inhibitory activity of compound II against tumor-derived cell lines in vitro. Unfortunately, this compound did not inhibit cell growth at 25 µmconcentration (data not shown). It is likely that compound II did not penetrate into the cells. Therefore, further chemical modification of compound II is necessary to obtain CDK4 inhibitors that have activity in tissue culture cells as well as in animal models. For such an approach, structural information of CDK4 mimic CDK2 should be very useful, and a study along this line is now in progress.Finally, it should be mentioned that a similar approach, namely construction of a mutant protein, can be pursued for proteins that have not been crystallized for structural determination in order to elucidate the binding modes of ligands, agonists, and antagonists.

In this study, we investigated the effects of lithium on primary bovine aortic endothelial cells (BAEC). Lithium treatment of BAEC induced β-catenin stabilization but failed to activate the transcriptional activity of the β-catenin/T-cell factor complex. Lithium caused a sustained G2/M cell cycle arrest without affecting cell viability. Reversibility of this cell cycle arrest occurred up to 3 days after treatment but was reduced thereafter. Lithium-treated BAEC exhibited a senescent-like morphology with an increase in cells positive for the senescence-associated-β-galactosidase activity. Lithium also increased the expression of p21Cip, a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor, both at the protein and RNA levels. No change in p21Cip mRNA stability was observed, whereas the transcriptional activity of a p21Cippromoter-luciferase construct containing p53 binding sites was increased after lithium treatment. Furthermore, lithium caused increased transcription of a reporter gene under the control of a promoter containing the p53 consensus binding sites both in transiently transfected BAEC and in a stably transfected fibroblast cell line. Lithium caused accumulation of p53 protein in BAEC without affecting p53 mRNA levels. Finally, up-regulation of p21Cip in response to lithium did not occur in mouse embryonic fibroblasts that were null for p53 alleles, confirming the dependence on a p53 pathway for this lithium effect. These findings demonstrate for the first time that lithium induces also stabilization of the tumor suppressor p53 and reveal a new mechanism that may contribute to the neuroprotective effects of lithium.

T-cell factor endothelial cell(s) bovine aortic endothelial cell(s) mouse embryonic fibroblast glycogen synthase kinase-3β phosphate-buffered saline senescent-associated β-galactosidase 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid Lithium has profound effects on the embryonic development and patterning in various organisms including Dictyostelium andXenopus (1Kao K.R. Elinson R.P. Biol. Cell. 1998; 90: 585-589Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Inhibition of the development of the yolk sac vasculature by lithium has been observed in the chick embryo (2Giles J.J. Bannigan J.C. J. Anat. 1999; 194: 197-205Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Lithium is also the main therapeutic agent for the treatment of patient suffering from bipolar disorder (3Ikonomov O.C. Manji H.K. Am. J. Psychiatry. 1999; 156: 1506-1514Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). To date, the underlying mechanisms and the molecular targets of lithium action have not been established neither during development nor during therapy. The developmental phenotype that is induced by lithium inXenopus is similar to that caused by alteration in the expression of Wnt proteins (1Kao K.R. Elinson R.P. Biol.

Lithium has been shown to be a specific and noncompetitive inhibitor of glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK-3β) activity in vitro (8Klein P.S. Melton D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8455-8459Crossref PubMed Scopus (2098) Google Scholar, 9Lucas F.R. Goold R.G. Gordon-Weeks P.R. Salinas P.C. J.

GSK-3β is a serine/threonine kinase that controls cell survival and cell fate through its involvement in multiple signaling pathways (11Woodgett J.R. Semin. Cancer Biol. 1994; 5: 269-275PubMed Google Scholar). Based on these findings, lithium is commonly used both as a potent mimetic of Wnt signaling and as a specific inhibitor of GSK-3β (1Kao K.R. Elinson R.P. Biol. Cell. 1998; 90: 585-589Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 5Davies J.A. Garrod D.R. Dev. Biol. 1995; 167: 50-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 6Logan C.Y.

Cancer Biol. 1994; 5: 269-275PubMed Google Scholar). β-Catenin, both a scaffolding protein in cadherin-mediated cell adhesion and a signaling molecule in the Wnt signaling pathway, is a target of GSK-3β (12Eastman Q. Grosschedl R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 233-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar,13Barker N. Clevers H. Bioessays. 2000; 22: 961-965Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). In the absence of a stimulatory signal, low levels of β-catenin are tightly regulated via phosphorylation by GSK-3β. This represents a signal for β-catenin degradation via the ubiquitin-dependent pathway (12Eastman Q. Grosschedl R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 233-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar, 13Barker N. Clevers H. Bioessays. 2000; 22: 961-965Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). Inactivation of GSK-3β by Wnt signaling or by lithium leads to stabilization and nuclear translocation of β-catenin where it associates with TCF transcription factor members (14Korinek V. Barker N. Morin P.J. van Wichen D. de Weger R. Kinzler K.W. Volgestein B. Clevers H. Science. 1997; 275: 1784-1787Crossref PubMed Scopus (2950) Google Scholar) and activates transcription of genes involved in cell adhesion (15Gradl D. Kuhl M. Wedlich D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 5576-5587Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and cell proliferation (16Tetsu O. McCormik F. Nature. 1999; 398: 422-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (3265) Google Scholar, 17He T.C. Sparks A.B. Rago C. Hermeking H. Zawel L. da Costa L.T. Morin P.J. Volgestein B. Kinzler K.W. Science. 1998; 281: 1509-1512Crossref PubMed Scopus (4092) Google Scholar). Abnormalities in the regulation of β-catenin have been implicated in colorectal and melanoma tumorigenesis (12Eastman Q. Grosschedl R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 233-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar, 13Barker N. Clevers H. Bioessays. 2000; 22: 961-965Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). However, in vivo overexpression of an N-terminally truncated form of β-catenin in intestinal epithelium did not increase tumorigenesis but increased both proliferation and apoptosis of undifferentiated cells without inducing cell differentiation (18Wong M.H. Rubinfeld B. Gordon J.I. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 765-777Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). The proliferation of terminally differentiated cells within the same intestinal crypt was not affected (18Wong M.H. Rubinfeld B. Gordon J.I. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 765-777Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Similarly, only the proliferation of progenitor cells within the intestinal crypt was impaired in mice null for the transcription factor TCF4 alleles (19Korinek V. Barker N. Moerer P. van Donselaar E. Huls G. Peters P.J. Clevers H. Nat. Genet. 1998; 19: 379-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (1330) Google Scholar). Overexpression of β-catenin, either wild-type or an S37A mutant, in different cell backgrounds yielded various results. Proliferation of the epithelial Madin-Darby canine kidney cells has been observed (20Orford K. Orford C.C. Byers S.W. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 855-868Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar), whereas apoptosis appeared to be the major effect in Drosophila retinal neurons (21Ahmed Y. Hayashi S. Levine A. Wieschaw E. Cell. 1998; 93: 1171-1182Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar), in mouse neurons (22Zhang Z. Hartmann H. Do V.M. Abramowski D. Sturchler-Pierrat C. Staufenbiel M. Sommer B. van de Wetering M. Clevers H. Saftig P. De Strooper B. He X. Yankner B.A. Nature. 1998; 395: 698-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar), and in fibroblasts NIH3T3 (23Kim K Pang K.M. Evans M. Hay E.D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 3509-3523Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). In the last, the apoptotic effects of β-catenin appeared independent of its transactivation function and interaction with TCF (23Kim K Pang K.M. Evans M. Hay E.D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 3509-3523Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Endothelial cells of the adult vasculature are characterized by a quiescent state, which is controlled in part by the organization of cadherin and catenin complexes at cell-cell contacts (24Bazzoni G. Dejana E. Lampugnani M.G. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 573-581Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). However, in response to injury or cytokine stimulation, tyrosine phosphorylation of β-catenin and dissociation from the cadherin complex is associated with EC migration and proliferation (24Bazzoni G. Dejana E. Lampugnani M.G. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 573-581Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Conversely, sequestration of β-catenin by the endothelium-specific VE-cadherin in the junctional complex inhibits EC migration and proliferation (25Caveda L. Martin-Padura I. Navarro P. Breviario F. Corada M. Gulino D. Lampugnani M.G. Dejana E. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 886-893Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). β-Catenin cleavage by caspase-3 and dissociation from the complex is also an early event in the EC onset to apoptosis (26Herren B. Leykau B. Raines E.W. Ross R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 1589-1601Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). Truncation of the β-catenin binding domain of VE-cadherin induces EC apoptosis, indicating that β-catenin may have a survival role in EC (27Carmeliet P. Lampugnani M.G. Moons L. Breviario F. Compernolle V. Bono F. Balconi G. Spagnuolo R. Oostuyse B. Dewerchin M. Zanetti A. Angellilo A. Mattot V. Nuyens D. Lutgens E. Clotman F. de Ruiter M.C. Gittenberger-de Groot A. Poelman R. Lupu F. Herbert J.M. Collen D. Dejana E. Cell. 1999; 98: 147-157Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1061) Google Scholar). Increased cytoplasmic levels of β-catenin have been reported in EC during the neovascularization process occurring after myocardial infarction (28Blankesteijn W.M. van Gijn M.E. Essers-Jansen Y.P. Daemen M.J. Smits J.F. Am. J. Pathol. 2000; 157: 877-883Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The expression of different components of the Wnt signaling pathway in vascular cells is also altered in a rat model of restenosis (29Mao C. Malek O.T. Pueyo M.E. Steg P.G. Soubrier F. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2000; 20: 43-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) or in vitro in response to mitogens (29Mao C. Malek O.T. Pueyo M.E. Steg P.G. Soubrier F. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2000; 20: 43-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) or cell passage (30Duplaa C. Jaspard B. Moreau C. D'Amore P.A. Circ. Res. 1999; 84: 1433-1445Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). EC proliferation occurs during angiogenesis and various vascular diseases (31Shimokawa H. J. Mol. Cell Cardiol. 1999; 31: 23-37Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar). Cell cycle progression in EC is inhibited, as in other mammalian cells, by two key regulators: the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21Cip and the tumor suppressor p53 (32el-Deiry W.S. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1998; 227: 121-137Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Increased expression of p21Cip and p53 is observed in atherosclerotic lesions (31Shimokawa H. J. Mol. Cell Cardiol. 1999; 31: 23-37Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar). Stabilization of p53 and induction of p21Cip by a variety of injuries, stresses, or inhibitors of proliferation lead to cell cycle arrest either at the G1/S or G2/M transitions (32el-Deiry W.S. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1998; 227: 121-137Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Lithium has been shown to affect cell proliferation either positively (33Ohtekei T. Parsons M. Zakarian A. Jones R.G. Nguyen L.T. Woodgett J.R. Ohashi P.S. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 192: 99-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar) or negatively (34Smits V.A. Essers M.A. Loomans D.S. Klompmaker R. Rijksen G. Medema R.H. FEBS Lett. 1999; 457: 23-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), depending on the cell type. Lithium induces proliferation of erythroid progenitor cells (35Hammond W.P. Dale D.C. Blood. 1982; 59: 179-184Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and terminal differentiation of WEHI-3B myelomonocytic leukemia cells (36Finch R.A. Chou T.C. Sartorelli A.C. Blood. 2000; 96: 2262-2268Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Wnt5a and Wnt10b are also able to promote proliferation of hematopoietic progenitor cells (37Van Den Berg D.J. Sharma A.K. Bruno E. Hoffman R. Blood. 1998; 92: 3189-3202Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Lithium, similarly to Wnt7A, has been shown to extend neurite outgrowth and to induce differentiation of cerebellar granule neurons (38Hall A.C. Lucas F.R. Salinas P.C. Cell. 2000; 100: 525-535Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (594) Google Scholar). Several recent reports suggest that lithium may exert its therapeutic effects through neuroprotection against various stresses: ischemia, glutamate excitotoxicity, radiation, and heat shock (39Chalecka-Franaszek E. Chuang D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 8745-8750Crossref PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar, 40Wei H. Leeds P.R. Qian Y. Wei W. Chen R. Chuang D. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 2000; 392: 117-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 41Chen R.W. Chuang D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6039-6042Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar, 42Bijur G.N. Sarno P. Jope R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7583-7590Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). Such survival effects of lithium on neuronal cells seem to be mediated in part by the activation of the survival Akt/protein kinase B pathway (40Wei H. Leeds P.R. Qian Y. Wei W. Chen R. Chuang D. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 2000; 392: 117-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) as well as by the inactivation of GSK-3β activity (42Bijur G.N. Sarno P. Jope R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7583-7590Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). Taken together, it appears that lithium as well as Wnt and β-catenin signaling may have various effects on cells depending on their differentiated state and whether they are immortalized or transformed. In the current report, we have determined that in primary EC lithium induces stabilization of both β-catenin and the tumor suppressor p53. This precedes cell cycle arrest in G2/M phase. Thus, our results reveal a novel mechanism that may account for the developmental and neuroprotective effects of lithium. Bovine aortic EC (BAEC) were isolated as described previously (43DiCorleto P.E.,. de la Motte C.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1985; 75: 1153-1161Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) and grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 containing 5% fetal bovine serum and used at passages 3–8. At least four different isolates of BAEC were used in the present study. Mouse fibroblast (12)1/CA cells carrying a p53-responsive β-galactosidase reporter construct have been described (44Chernov M. Stark G.R. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 2503-2510Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The mouse embryonic fibroblasts MEFp53+/+, MEFp53+/−, and MEFp53−/− were derived from parental, heterozygous, and p53 knockout mice, respectively, and were kindly provided by Dr. Tyler Jacks (45Jacks T. Remington L. Williams B.O. Schmitt E.M. Halachmi S. Bronson R.T. Weinberg R.A. Curr. Biol. 1994; 4: 1-7Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1746) Google Scholar). All of the mouse fibroblast cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Life Technologies, Inc.). Cell irradiation with 25 J/m2 UV light for 10 s was used as positive control for p53 activation and was conducted as previously described (44Chernov M. Stark G.R. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 2503-2510Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Actinomycin D was from Sigma. Cells were grown in 24-well culture clusters for 24 h prior to treatment with LiCl, or NaCl as control, with the indicated doses and times. In the last 2 h of treatment, 1 µCi/ml [methyl-3H]thymidine (specific radioactivity 6.7 Ci/mmol; ICN) was added. Thereafter, the cells were washed rapidly with ice-cold 5% trichloroacetic acid and then incubated on ice for 20 min in 5% trichloroacetic acid. After two washes with ice-cold PBS, the cells were solubilized with 0.25 n NaOH and transferred to counting vials containing 5 ml of liquid scintillant (ICN). All results represent triplicate samples and three independent experiments. For the determination of [3H]leucine incorporation, 24 h after seeding, the cells were treated with various doses of NaCl or LiCl for 24 h prior to the addition of 0.5 µCi/ml of [3H]leucine (specific radioactivity 132 Ci/mmol; ICN) followed by a 24-h incubation at 37 °C. Thereafter, the cells were washed and solubilized as described above. The experiment was carried out with triplicate samples and was repeated twice. The cell cycle distribution was determined by flow cytometric analysis of propidium iodide-labeled cells. Briefly, BAEC were plated in six-well culture clusters 24 h prior to treatment with either NaCl or LiCl for the indicated doses and times. After trypsinization, cells were collected, washed twice with ice-cold PBS, and fixed in ice-cold 70% ethanol. Cells were then washed twice with ice-cold PBS, resuspended in PBS containing 100 units/ml RNase A, incubated at 37 °C for 30 min, stained with propidium iodide (20 µg/ml), and analyzed by FACScan (Becton Dickinson). BAEC were grown on glass coverslips in six-well culture clusters 24 h prior to cell treatment either with NaCl or LiCl. Four days post-treatment, BAEC were stained for senescence-associated β-galactosidase (SA-β-galactosidase) activity at pH 6 for 16 h, as previously described (46Dimri G.P. Lee X. Basile G. Acosta M. Scott G. Roskelley C. Medrano E.E. Linskens M. Rubeli I. Pereira-Smith O. Campisi J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9363-9367Crossref PubMed Scopus (5788) Google Scholar). Phase-contrast and color photomicrographs of stained cells were taken. Total RNA was isolated by the acid guanidine thiocyanate/phenol/chloroform method using Trizol (Life Technologies). RNA (10–20 µg) was size-fractionated in a 1% agarose gel containing 6% formaldehyde in MOPS buffer and then transferred to Nytran nylon membrane (Schleicher and Schuell) using 10× SSC (1.5m NaCl and 0.15 m sodium citrate). The filters were hybridized for 12–16 h at 65 °C with 32P-labeled DNA probes (106 µCi/ml) in Church and Guilbert buffer. DNA probes were labeled with [α-32P]dCTP (specific activity 3000 Ci/mmol; ICN) using the oligoprimer labeling kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). After hybridization, the membranes were washed under standard conditions and autoradiographed using X-Omat MR films (Eastman Kodak Co.). Radioactive mRNA signals were quantified by PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics, Inc.). Each experiment was repeated 2–3 times. The DNA probes used in this study were as follows: full-length human p21Cip cDNA (47el-Deiry W.S. Tokino T. Velculescu V.E. Levy D.B. Parsons R. Trent J.M. Lin D. Mercer W.E. Kinzler K.W. Volgestein B. Cell. 1993; 75: 817-825Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (7957) Google Scholar), full-length human p53 cDNA (48Zeng Y.X. Somasundaram K. el-Deiry W.S. Nat. Genet. 1997; 15: 78-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar), and full-length mouse cyclin D1 (49Matsushime H. Roussel M.F. Ashmun R.A. Sherr C.J. Cell. 1991; 65: 701-713Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (990) Google Scholar). The probes for p27Kipand rpL32 were generated by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction using the following primers: for human p27Kip, primer pair 5′-GAAAGATGTCAAACGTGCG-3′ and 5′-GAGCTGTTTACGTTTGAC-3′, generating a 600-base pair product; for human rpL32, primer set 5′-GCCAGATCTTGATGCCCAAC-3′ and 5′-CGTGCACATGAGCTGCCTAC-3′, generating a 280-base pair product. Whole cell extracts were prepared as follows. After incubation and treatments, cells were washed with PBS and lysed in 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.6, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 10 mm NaF, 2 mm NaVO3, 1 mm dithiothreitol supplemented with a mixture of protease inhibitors (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). For cell fractionation into cytosolic and membrane extracts, cells were washed in PBS, collected, and disrupted in 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.6, 1.5 mmMgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm NaF, 2 mm NaVO3, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and protease inhibitors by repeated passage through a 23-gauge needle. After removal of nuclei by centrifugation at 800 ×g for 5 min, the supernatant was centrifuged at high speed (100,000 × g for 30 min) to separate the membrane (pellet) and the cytosolic (supernatant) fractions. Nuclear extracts were prepared as previously described (50Schreiber E Matthias P. Muller M.M. Schaffner W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 6419Crossref PubMed Scopus (3918) Google Scholar). Protein (30 µg) was subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (10%) and then transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore Corp.). Loading of equal amounts of protein was verified by staining with Ponceau-S (Sigma). Filters were incubated for 2 h at room temperature in 5% nonfat milk blocking mix (Bio-Rad) in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 0.15m NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20, followed by 12–16 h at 4 °C with either mouse monoclonal anti-p53 antibody (PAb240) or rabbit polyclonal anti-p27Kip antibodies (Santa Cruz) or rabbit polyclonal anti-β-catenin (Sigma) in the same buffer. After 3 washes, blots were incubated with the appropriate secondary antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase Upstate Biotechnologies, Inc., Lake Placid, NY, developed using the enhanced chemiluminescence substrate (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and exposed to Kodak X-Omat-MR film. The polyclonal antibodies specific for p21Cip used in this study were directly conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.). BAEC were grown in 12-well culture clusters, and 24 h later at 60% confluency, cells were transfected for 2 h in serum-free medium with 5 µl of Exgen 500 (Euromedex) and with 0.5 µg of the following cesium chloride-purified luciferase constructs: the TOPflash and FOPflash constructs containing, respectively, wild-type or mutated TCF binding sites upstream of the thymidine kinase minimal promoter (14Korinek V. Barker N. Morin P.J. van Wichen D. de Weger R. Kinzler K.W. Volgestein B. Clevers H. Science. 1997; 275: 1784-1787Crossref PubMed Scopus (2950) Google Scholar); the p21 promoter luciferase constructs −2300-p21L, −210-p21L, and -94-p21L previously described (48Zeng Y.X. Somasundaram K. el-Deiry W.S. Nat. Genet. 1997; 15: 78-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar); the p53-CA-luciferase reporter construct containing p53 consensus A sites and HSP70 minimal promoter (51Funk W.D. Pak D.T. Karas R.H. Wright W.E. Shay J.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 2866-2871Crossref PubMed Scopus (679) Google Scholar); and the promoterless pGL3-basic (Promega). 5 ng of pRSV-β-galactosidase was co-transfected to monitor the efficiency of transfection. Normal medium was then added for 22 h prior to treatment with NaCl, LiCl, or UV light as positive control for the indicated times. Cells were lysed 30–48 h after transfection, and the luciferase activity assays and β-galactosidase activity assays were performed accordingly to the manufacturers' instructions (Promega and Tropix, respectively) and monitored using a Dynex luminometer. Data are presented as the mean ± S.D. of at least three independent experiments unless designated otherwise. Statistical analysis was performed using Student'st test, and a value of p < 0.05 was considered to be significant. We investigated the effect of lithium on the β-catenin-TCF pathway in primary BAEC by using two standard assays: stabilization and nuclear accumulation of β-catenin and transcriptional activation of a luciferase reporter driven by TCF-responsive elements. The epithelial HEK293 cells were used as positive control, since they are responsive to both lithium and Wnt signaling (52Chen R.H. Ding W.V. McCormick F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17894-17899Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig.1 A, lithium treatment for 12 h in BAEC increased the cytosolic pool of β-catenin, similar to the case in epithelial HEK293 cells, a known responsive cell line for Wnt signaling. A slight increase of β-catenin nuclear pool was also observed in both cell lines. To test whether this β-catenin stabilization was followed by an increase in the β-catenin-TCF complex activity, BAEC and HEK293 were transfected with either the TOPflash or FOPflash constructs (14Korinek V. Barker N. Morin P.J. van Wichen D. de Weger R. Kinzler K.W. Volgestein B. Clevers H. Science. 1997; 275: 1784-1787Crossref PubMed Scopus (2950) Google Scholar). 24 h post-transfection, the cells were treated for 12 h with either 5 mm NaCl as control or with 5 mm LiCl. A 4-fold increase in luciferase activity was observed in HEK293 cells transfected with TOPflash and treated with lithium but not with the FOPflash construct containing mutated TCF sites (Fig. 1 B). However, under the same conditions, lithium did not increase the activity of the TOPflash construct in BAEC. This lack of effect in BAEC was also observed with higher doses of LiCl (20 mm) (not shown). Therefore, in contrast to HEK293, lithium induced in BAEC stabilization of β-catenin without inducing an active β-catenin-TCF complex. The effect of lithium on BAEC proliferation was examined by measuring the incorporation of [3H]thymidine into DNA. Subconfluent and asynchronous BAEC were incubated with various concentrations of LiCl or with NaCl as a control for the indicated times. Cells were pulse-labeled with [3H]thymidine in the last 2 h of the incubation. As shown in Fig.2 A, the amount of [3H]thymidine incorporation in lithium-treated cells (5 mm) was only 49.7 ± 7.9% at 12 h and 19.5 ± 7.9% at 24 h as compared with sodium-treated cells (p < 0.05). This effect was also observed at lower concentration of lithium (3 mm) with an inhibition of 32 ± 5.8 and 43 ± 7.9% after, respectively, 24- and 48-h treatment (p < 0.05). Cell viability was monitored by measuring the rate of protein synthesis (incorporation of [3H]leucine into proteins) and the number of cells was determined in a parallel experiment. As shown in Fig. 2 B, the number of BAEC was decreased by 38 ± 2.5 and 55 ± 2.45% after 48-h treatment of a 70% confluent culture with 5 and 10 mm lithium, respectively. After correcting for cell number, the protein synthetic rate was found to be unchanged after 48 h of lithium treatment with doses up to 10 mm (Fig.2 C). These results indicated that lithium inhibits BAEC proliferation without affecting their viability. Inhibition of cell proliferation can occur through activation of sever"

To investigate the molecular basis of this effect, a MCF-7 breast cancer cell model was established where serum deprivation and concurrent treatment with the pure estrogen antagonist, ICI 182780, inhibited growth factor and estrogen action and arrested cells in G0/G1 phase. Subsequent stimulation with insulin or IGF-I alone failed to induce significant S-phase entry. However, these treatments increased cyclin D1, cyclin E, and p21 gene expression and induced the formation of active Cdk4 complexes but resulted in only minor increases in cyclin E-Cdk2 activity, likely due to recruitment of the cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitor p21WAF1/Cip1 into these complexes. Treatment with estradiol alone resulted in a greater increase in cyclin D1 gene expression but markedly decreased p21 expression, with a concurrent increase in Cdk4 and Cdk2 activity and subsequent synchronous entry of cells into S phase. Co-administration of insulin/IGF-I and estrogen induced synergistic stimulation of S-phase entry coincident with synergistic activation of high molecular mass (∼350 kDa) cyclin E-Cdk2 complexes lacking p21. To determine if the ability of estrogen to deplete p21 was central to these effects, cells stimulated with insulin and estradiol were infected with an adenovirus expressing p21. Induction of p21 to levels equivalent to those following treatment with insulin alone markedly inhibited the synergism between estradiol and insulin on S-phase entry. Thus the ability of estradiol to antagonize the insulin-induced increase in p21 gene expression, with consequent activation of cyclin E-Cdk2, is a central component of the synergistic stimulation of breast epithelial cell proliferation induced by simultaneous activation of the estrogen and insulin/IGF-I signaling pathways.

Bolan G. Monaco M.E. Lippman M.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1976; 73: 4536-4540Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar) and IGF-I (14van der Burg B. Isbrucker L. van Seim-Miltenburg A.J.P. de Laat S.W. van Zoelen E.J.J. Cancer Res. 1990; 50: 7770-7774PubMed Google Scholar) are potent mitogens and synergize with estrogen to stimulate cell proliferation (15van der Burg B. Rutteman G.R.

Chem. 1990; 265: 21172-21178Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Several potential mechanisms have been proposed to account for these effects. Estrogens alter the expression of IGF ligands, receptors, and binding proteins, suggesting potential autocrine and paracrine mechanisms for estrogen-stimulated mitogenesis (17Yee D. Lee A. J. Mamm. Gland Biol. Neoplasia. 2000; 5: 107-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). By up-regulating IGF-IR, estrogen can sensitize MCF-7 cells to the mitogenic effects of high concentrations of insulin (acting through the IGF-IR) and IGF-I (16Stewart A.J. Johnson M.D. May F.E. Westley B.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 21172-21178Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Daws M.R. Westley B.R. May F.E. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 1177-1186Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Other studies have shown that estrogens may impinge directly on IGF-I signal transduction downstream of the IGF-IR. Ligand stimulation of the IGF-IR activates its tyrosine kinase activity, leading to phosphorylation of key intracellular substrates including insulin receptor substrate proteins 1–4 (19White M. Yenush L. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1998; 228: 179-208Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Phosphorylated insulin receptor substrate-1 acts as a docking site for several SH2-containing proteins including the p85 subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and Grb2 (20Jackson J.G. White M.F. Yee D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9994-10003Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). These molecules in turn link IGF-IR to specific pathways controlling cellular proliferation,i.e. the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-Akt/protein kinase B and the Ras-Raf-mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways. In MCF-7 cells, proliferation in response to IGF-I appears to be mediated predominantly via the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase pathway (21Dufourny B. Alblas J. van Teeffelen H.A. van Schaik F.M. van der Burg B. Steenbergh P.H. Sussenbach J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31163-31171Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). Estrogen can activate insulin receptor substrate-1 by increasing gene expression and protein phosphorylation (12Molloy C.A. May F.E. Westley B.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 12565-12571Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 22Lee A.V. Jackson J.G. Gooch J.L. Hilsenbeck S.G. Coronado-Heinsohn E. Osborne C.K. Yee D. Mol.

Walker M.P. Sebastian J. DiAugustine R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11962-11969Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Ligand-bound ERα, but not ERβ, can activate IGF-I signal transduction via a rapid nongenomic effect mediated by direct interaction of ERα with the IGF-IR. This interaction appeared dependent on ERα phosphorylation by ERK1/2 and resulted in IGF-IR phosphorylation and activation of the Ras-Raf-mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade (11Kahlert S. Nuedling S. van Eickels M. Vetter H. Meyer R. Grohe C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18447-18453Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar). IGF-I and estradiol can also act synergistically to increase Akt protein expression and enzymatic activity (24Ahmad S. Singh N. Glazer R.I. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1999; 58: 425-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Finally, direct activation of p21ras-mitogen-activated protein kinase-signaling pathways by estrogen has also been proposed (25Migliaccio A. Di Domenico M. Castoria G. de Falco A. Bontempo P. Nola E. Auricchio F. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1292-1300Crossref PubMed Scopus (867) Google Scholar). In addition to estrogen regulation of components of insulin/IGF-I-signaling pathways there is also evidence that polypeptide growth factors acting via type I receptor tyrosine kinases modulate estrogen action. Ligands for both the epidermal growth factor receptor and IGF-IR can regulate ER gene expression (26Stoica A. Saceda M. Fakhro A. Joyner M. Martin M.B. J. Cell. Biochem. 2000; 76: 605-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 27Stoica A. Saceda M. Doraiswamy V.L. Coleman C. Martin M.B. J. Endocrinol. 2000; 165: 371-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) and ER-mediated transcription (28Lee A.V. Weng C.N. Jackson J.G. Yee D. J. Endocrinol. 1997; 152: 39-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar) in an estrogen-independent manner. Studies in which functional domains of ER were deleted revealed a requirement for the activation function-1 domain in ligand-independent activation of ER by epidermal growth factor (29Ignar-Trowbridge D.M. Teng C.T. Ross K.A. Parker M.G. Korach K.S. McLachlan J.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 1993; 7: 992-998Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). Furthermore, ER function can be modulated by mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphorylation of Ser-118 within the activation function-1 domain after epidermal growth factor (30Kato S. Endoh H. Masuhiro Y. Kitamoto T. Uchiyama S. Sasaki H. Masushige S. Gotoh Y. Nishida E. Kawashima H. Science. 1995; 270: 1491-1494Crossref PubMed Scopus (1716) Google Scholar) or insulin/IGF-I (31Ma Z.Q. Santagati S. Patrone C. Pollio G. Vegeto E. Maggi A. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 910-918Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar) stimulation. This specific phosphorylation event provides one potential mechanism for growth factor activation of ER signaling. The data outlined above provide evidence for mechanisms by which estrogen and insulin/IGF-I-signaling pathways are cross-modulated. However, their mitogenic effects are ultimately mediated at the level of regulation of kinases that govern transition from G0/G1 to S phase of the cell cycle,i.e. the G1 cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) cyclin D-Cdk4/6 and cyclin E-Cdk2 (32Nevins J.R. Cell Growth Differ. 1998; 9: 585-593PubMed Google Scholar, 33Sherr C. Roberts J. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1501-1512Crossref PubMed Scopus (5145) Google Scholar). Several of these cell cycle regulatory molecules have been identified previously as targets of insulin/IGF-I (34Musgrove E.A. Hamilton J.A. Lee C.S. Sweeney K.J. Watts C.K. Sutherland R.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 3577-3587Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar) or estrogen-induced mitogenesis in breast cancer cells (3Altucci L. Addeo R. Cicatiello L. Dauvois S. Parker M.G. Truss M.

Biol. 1997; 17: 4059-4069Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). These mitogenic signals are thought to converge on cyclin D-Cdk4/6 since activity of this kinase is required for either serum or estrogen-induced mitogenesis (35Lukas J. Bartkova J. Bartek J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6917-6925Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). Insulin or IGF-I stimulate cyclin D1, D3, and E gene expression (34Musgrove E.A. Hamilton J.A. Lee C.S. Sweeney K.J. Watts C.K. Sutherland R.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 3577-3587Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar), in common with other mitogens in a spectrum of cell types. In MCF-7 cells, increased cyclin D1 gene expression and stabilized cyclin D1 mRNA in response to IGF-I is mediated via the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase pathway (36Dufourny B. van Teeffelen H.A. Hamelers I.H. Sussenbach J.S. Steenbergh P.H. J. Endocrinol. 2000; 166: 329-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Estrogen also stimulates cyclin D1 gene expression and subsequent activation of cyclin D1-Cdk4 (3Altucci L. Addeo R. Cicatiello L. Dauvois S. Parker M.G. Truss M. Beato M. Sica V. Bresciani F. Weisz A. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 2315-2324PubMed Google Scholar, 5Prall O.W.J. Sarcevic B. Musgrove E.A. Watts C.K.W. Sutherland R.L. J. Biol.

However, unlike the situation observed after growth factor stimulation, this is not preceded by a major increase in cyclin E gene expression (5Prall O.W.J. Sarcevic B. Musgrove E.A. Watts C.K.W. Sutherland R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10882-10894Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar). Rather, estrogen-induced Cdk2 activation involves a novel mechanism wherein a small fraction of the total cyclin E-Cdk2 pool is present in a high molecular mass complex depleted of the CDK inhibitor, p21WAF1/Cip1 (5Prall O.W.J.

Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4059-4069Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). The known synergistic interactions between insulin/IGF-I and estrogen in stimulating breast cancer cell proliferation may, thus, converge at both cyclin D-Cdk4/6 and cyclin E-Cdk2, although this has not been investigated to date. In this study we investigated the cell cycle regulatory events accompanying synergistic interactions between estrogen and insulin/IGF-I in mediating cell cycle progression in MCF-7 cells. Cells were initially arrested in a quiescent state by serum withdrawal and treatment with the pure estrogen antagonist, ICI 182780 (37Carroll J.S. Prall O.W. Musgrove E.A. Sutherland R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38221-38229Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Subsequent treatment with insulin/IGF-I and estradiol resulted in synergistic stimulation of S-phase entry. Analysis of the expression and function of cyclin D1-Cdk4 and cyclin E-Cdk2 during the G0/G1-S-phase transition revealed cooperative regulation by insulin/IGF-I and estrogen of several molecules regulating these kinases. Of primary significance was the observation of synergy at the level of cyclin E-Cdk2 activation as a likely key mediator of the synergistic cell cycle progression. Stock solutions of 7α-[9-(4,4,5,5,5-pentafluropentylsulfinyl)nonyl]estra-1,3,5,(10)-triene-3,17β-diol (ICI 182780) and 17β-estradiol (estradiol) were prepared as follows. ICI 182780 (a gift of Dr. Alan Wakeling, Astra-Zeneca Pharmaceuticals, Alderley Park, Cheshire, UK) was dissolved in ethanol to 10−2m, and a working dilution of 10−5m in RPMI 1640 medium was prepared before each experiment. Estradiol (Sigma) was dissolved in ethanol at 2 × 10−4m. Aliquots of a stock solution of insulin (Novo Nordisc Pharmaceuticals Pty Ltd. North Rocks, New South Wales, Australia) at 4 mg/ml were added directly to the culture medium. Stock cultures of MCF-7 cells (Michigan Cancer Foundation, Detroit, Michigan) were cryo-preserved and maintained as previously described (38Sutherland R.L. Hall R.E. Taylor I.W. Cancer Res. 1983; 43: 3998-4006PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum, insulin (10 µg/ml), and gentamicin (10 µg/ml). For experiments investigating the effects of ICI 182780, estradiol, and insulin on cell cycle-phase distribution, 25-cm2 flasks were seeded with 1 × 105 cells. Experiments investigating the effects of estradiol and insulin on cell cycle protein levels, cyclin-Cdk complex formation, and kinase activity employed 150-cm2 tissue culture flasks seeded with 2 × 106 cells. The growth kinetics, including changes in cell cycle-phase distribution, were identical under both experimental conditions. To investigate the effects of insulin and estradiol on cell cycle progression, cells were allowed to proliferate for 2 days, after which the medium was removed, and cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline. Medium was replaced with a defined serum-free phenol red-free RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with transferrin (24 µg/ml) and gentamicin (10 µg/ml). This medium was changed once daily for 2 days. After 48 h of serum deprivation in this defined medium, ICI 182780 was added directly to the medium to a final concentration of 10 nm. After 24 h of ICI 182780 pretreatment, vehicle, estradiol (100 nm), insulin (10 µg/ml), or IGF-I (10 nm) was added directly to the medium, and after incubation for the desired time, cells were harvested by brief incubation with trypsin (0.05% w/v), EDTA (0.02% w/v). Cells were prepared for analytical DNA flow cytometry as previously described (39Musgrove E.A. Wakeling A.E. Sutherland R.L. Cancer Res. 1989; 49: 2398-2404PubMed Google Scholar). DNA flow cytometry was performed on a FACSCalibur laser-based flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson, Immunocytometry Systems, Mountview, CA), and cell cycle-phase distribution was analyzed with a software program Modfit (Becton Dickinson, Immunocytometry Systems, Mountview, CA). Cells were lysed as follows. Cell monolayers were washed twice in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline then scraped into ice-cold lysis buffer A (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 10 µg/ml aprotinin, 10 µg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 200 µm sodium orthovanadate, 10 mmpyrophosphate, 100 mm NaF, and 1 mm DTT). The lysates were incubated for 5 min on ice, and cellular debris was cleared by centrifugation (15,000 × g, 5 min, 4 °C). Equal amounts of total protein (20–40 µg) were separated by SDS-PAGE then transferred to nitrocellulose. Proteins were visualized using the ECL detection system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) after incubation (2 h at room temperature or overnight at 4 °C for primary and 1 h at room temperature for secondary antibodies) using the following primary antibodies: cyclin E (HE12), Cdk2 (M2), Cdk4 (C-22), p107 (C-18), and p130 (C-20) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc., Santa Cruz, CA); cyclin D1 (DCS-6) (Novacastra Laboratories Ltd, Newcastle-upon-Tyne, UK); p21WAF1/Cip1 (catalog numberC24420) and p27Kip1 (catalog number K25020) (Transduction Laboratories, Lexington, KY); and secondary antibodies anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase and anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase (Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc., Santa Cruz, CA). Protein abundance was quantitated by analysis of autoradiographs using densitometry (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). Quantitation of protein levels by this method was linear over the analyzed range of protein concentrations and exposure times. MCF-7 cell monolayers were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline then scraped into ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and pelleted by centrifugation (15,000 × g, 5 min). For Cdk4 activity assays, the pellets were frozen in liquid nitrogen for storage at −70 °C. Immediately before assaying, the pellets were thawed and resuspended in 1 ml of ice-cold lysis buffer B (50 mmHEPES, pH 7.5, 1 mm DTT, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 2.5 mm EGTA, 0.1% Tween 20, 10% glycerol, 10 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm NaF, 0.1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 10 µg/ml leupeptin, 10 µg/ml aprotinin, 1 mm DTT, and 0.1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). The lysate was placed on ice and vortexed vigorously at intervals for 60 min then centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. For cyclin E-Cdk2 activity assays, the pellet was resuspended in 1 ml of ice cold lysis buffer A and frozen in liquid nitrogen for storage at −70 °C. The lysate was placed on ice, vortexed vigorously at intervals for 10 min, and centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant was collected. Equivalent amounts of protein were precleared by incubation with protein A-Sepharose (Zymed Laboratories Inc., San Francisco, CA) for 45 min at 4 °C. Cdk4 or cyclin E complexes were immunoprecipitated with either rabbit polyclonal human Cdk4 (H-22) or anti-cyclin E polyclonal antibody (C-19), respectively (Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc), for 2 h at 4 °C. Similarly, control samples were immunoprecipitated with antibodies preincubated with the respective Cdk4 or cyclin E peptides (Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc.), also for 2 h at 4 °C. This was followed by a 30-min incubation at 4 °C with protein A-Sepharose for conjugation to the antibodies. Cdk4 immunoprecipitates were washed twice with ice-cold lysis buffer B, twice with ice-cold 50 mm HEPES pH 7.5, and 1 mm DTT, and the supernatant was aspirated. The immunoprecipitates were used for kinase assays with glutathioneS-transferase-pRb773–928 (generated from a plasmid kindly supplied by Dr. Ed Harlow, Massachusetts General Hospital Cancer Center, Charlestown, MA) as substrate. Cyclin E immunoprecipitates were washed twice with ice-cold lysis buffer A containing 1 m NaCl, once with ice-cold lysis buffer A, and then twice with ice-cold 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 1 mm DTT. Histone H1 (Sigma) was employed as the substrate for the kinase activity assays on cyclin E immunoprecipitates. Each kinase reaction was initiated by resuspending the beads in 30 µl of kinase buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 1 mmDTT, 2.5 mm EGTA, 10 mm MgCl2, 20 µm ATP, 10 µCi of [γ-32P]ATP, 0.1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm NaF, 10 mm β-glycerophosphate) and 10 µg of histone H1 (cyclin E immunoprecipitates) or 10 µg of pRb (Cdk4 immunoprecipitates) as substrate. After incubation for 15 min at 30 °C, the reactions were terminated by the addition of 15 µl of 3× SDS sample buffer (187 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 30% (v/v) glycerol, 6% SDS, 15% (v/v) β-mercaptoethanol). The samples were then heated at 95 °C for 2 min and separated using 12% SDS-PAGE, and the dried gel was exposed to x-ray film for autoradiography. Relative band intensities were quantitated by densitometric analysis as described above. Immunoprecipitation of Cdk4, cyclin E, and p130 was performed using the method described above (for immunoprecipitating cyclin E and Cdk4 for kinase activity assays), except that the cyclin E and p130 antibodies were chemically cross-linked to protein A-Sepharose to reduce background (40Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies : A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, NY1988: 526-527Google Scholar). The antibodies used were rabbit polyclonal antisera to human Cdk4 (H-22), human cyclin E (C-19), and human p130 (C-20) from Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc. The supernatants obtained after immunoprecipitation were Western-blotted to determine immunoprecipitation efficiency of each antibody, with a 90–95% efficiency consistently achieved. The immunoprecipitated proteins were resuspended in 1× SDS sample buffer, separated by SDS-PAGE, and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane, and the proteins were detected using the antibodies described for Western-blotting above. Cell lysates prepared in lysis buffer A were passed through a 0.22-mm MILLEX-GV4 filter (Millipore, Lane Cove, NSW, Australia) and fractionated on a HiLoad 16/60 Superdex 200 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) using a fast protein liquid chromatography system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Proteins were eluted at 1.2 ml/min at 4 °C in the following buffer: 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 250 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% (v/v) β-mercaptoethanol, and 0.01% (v/v) Tween 20. The column void volume was ∼45 ml and 16 3-ml fractions were collected between 45 and 93 ml (termed fractions 16–31). Column calibrations were performed under the same conditions using a high molecular mass gel filtration calibration kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) containing ferritin (440 kDa), catalase (232 kDa), and aldolase (158 kDa). The eluted proteins was concentrated before Western blotting, whereby 200 µl of each fraction was placed at −70 °C overnight with 1 ml of acetone and 10 µg of carrier bovine serum albumin. Protein pellets were collected by centrifugation (15,000 × g, 20 min, 4 °C) and then resuspended by boiling for 4 min in 30 µl of SDS sample buffer. For cyclin E-Cdk2 kinase assays, 300 µl of each fraction was used. For Western blotting of cyclin E immunoprecipitates, 700 µl of each fraction was used. The human p21 adenovirus (Ad-p21ΔC) was obtained from Dr. Joseph Nevins (Duke University Medical Center, Durham, NC) and amplified in HEK293 cells. Virus was purified by CsCl density gradient centrifugation, and titers were determined by a focus-forming assay using standard techniques (41Falck-Pedersen E. Spector D.L. Goldman R.D. Leinwand L.A. Cells: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, NY1998: 90.1-90.28Google Scholar). MCF-7 cells were rescued from growth arrest with insulin, estradiol, or both as described above and infected with Ad-p21 or control adenovirus at matched titers from 4–24 h. Cells were harvested 24 h after mitogenic rescue for protein analysis or analytical DNA flow cytometry. Previous studies have shown that treatment of exponentially growing MCF-7 cells with ICI 182780, a pure estrogen antagonist that inhibits estrogen-mediated gene transcription (42McDonnell D.P.

Cell cycle progression is re-initiated after the addition of estradiol to ICI 182780-treated cells in serum-supplemented medium (5Prall O.W.J. Sarcevic B. Musgrove E.A. Watts C.K.W. Sutherland R.L.

In the present study this model was modified to examine the interaction of insulin/IGF-I and estrogen in mediating cell cycle progression in a serum-free environment. Exponentially growing MCF-7 cells were growth-arrested by serum deprivation for 72 h to inhibit growth factor-signaling pathways with concomitant treatment for the final 24 h with ICI 182780 to inhibit estrogen action. This pretreatment reduced S phase from 40 to 3–5% and led to accumulation of quiescent cells (37Carroll J.S. Prall O.W. Musgrove E.A. Sutherland R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38221-38229Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). As is evident in Fig. 1 A, stimulation of arrested cells with insulin (10 µg/ml) or IGF-I (1 nm) alone resulted in a minor increase in S-phase cells to ∼10–12% at 26 h.

Genome analysis indicates that there are seven caspases in Drosophila, six of which have been previously characterized.

Ectopic expression of DAMM in cultured cells induces apoptosis, and similarly, transgenic overexpression of DAMM, but not of a catalytically inactive DAMM mutant, in Drosophila results in a rough eye phenotype.

A number of caspases have been described in both vertebrates and invertebrates. To date 14 caspases have been cloned in mammals (1Nicholson D.W. Cell Death Diff. 1999; 6: 1551-1570Crossref Scopus (1297) Google Scholar, 2Kumar S. Cell Death Diff. 1999; 6: 1060-1066Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar, 3Cryns V. Yuan J.

Gene targeting studies in the mouse suggest that some caspases play a signal specific and spatially restricted role in apoptosis, whereas others seem mainly involved in the processing and activation of proinflammatory cytokines (reviewed in Ref. 5Zheng T.S. Hunot S. Kuida K. Flavell R.A. Cell Death Diff. 1999; 6: 1043-1053Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). Four caspases exist in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, but only one, CED-3, is essential for all developmentally programmed cell death, and the functions of the remaining three are not known (6Shaham S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 35109-35117Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). InDrosophila melanogaster six caspases, named DCP-1, DREDD/DCP-2, DRICE, DRONC, DECAY, and STRICA have been cloned so far (7Song Z. McCall K. Steller H.

Cell Death Diff. 2001; 8: 387-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). In addition to the already described caspases, analysis of theDrosophila genomic database predicts one more caspase, which we have termed DAMM1(GenBankTM accession number AF240763; death-associated molecule related toMch2) (14Kumar S Doumanis J. Cell Death Diff. 2000; 7: 1039-1044Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Among the Drosophila caspases, DREDD and DRONC contain long prodomains carrying death effector domains (DEDs) and a caspase recruitment domain (CARD), respectively, suggesting that these two caspases may act as upstream initiator caspases (reviewed in Ref. 14Kumar S Doumanis J. Cell Death Diff. 2000; 7: 1039-1044Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). STRICA also has a long prodomain, but it lacks any CARD or DED structures (13Doumanis J. Quinn L.M. Richardson H. Kumar S. Cell Death Diff. 2001; 8: 387-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). On the other hand, DCP-1, DRICE, and DECAY lack long prodomains and are thus similar to downstream effector caspases in mammals. dcp-1 mutants are larval lethal and exhibit melanotic tumors (7Song Z. McCall K. Steller H. Science. 1997; 275: 536-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). Additionally, DCP-1 is required for Drosophila oogenesis, as dcp-1mutants show a defect in transfer of nurse cell cytoplasmic contents to developing oocytes (15McCall K. Steller H. Science. 1998; 279: 230-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). The transcript for dreddaccumulates in embryonic cells undergoing programmed cell death and in nurse cells in the ovary at a time that coincides with nurse cell death (8Chen P. Rodriguez A. Erskine R. Thach T. Abrams J.M. Dev. Biol. 1998; 201: 202-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Heterozygosity at the dredd locus suppresses cell death induced by the ectopic expression by rpr, hid,and grim in transgenic models, indicating that DREDD concentration may be a rate-limiting step in this pathway. In addition to its function in apoptosis, DREDD also plays a key role in the innate immune response (16Elrod-Erickson M. Misra S. Schneider D. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 781-784Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar, 17Leulier F. Rodriguez A. Khush R.S. Abrams J.M. Lemaitre B. EMBO Rep. 2000; 1: 353-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). dronc mRNA is widely expressed during development and is up-regulated several-fold by ecdysone in larval salivary glands and midgut prior to histolysis of these tissues (11Dorstyn L. Colussi P. Quinn L.M. Richardson H. Kumar S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4307-4312Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). Heterozygosity at thedronc locus or the expression of a catalytically inactive DRONC mutant suppress the eye phenotype caused by rpr,grim, and hid, consistent with the idea that DRONC functions in the RPR, GRIM, and HID pathway (18Meier P. Silke J. Leevers S.J. Evan G.I. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 598-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar, 19Hawkins C.J. Yoo S.J. Peterson E.P. Wang S.L. Vernooy S.Y. Hay B.A. J. Biol.

Chem. 2000; 275: 40416-40424Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). DRONC also interacts, both biochemically and genetically, with the CED-4/Apaf-1 fly homolog, Dark (20Quinn L.M. Dorstyn L. Mills K. Colussi P.A. Chen P. Coombe M. Abrams J. Kumar S Richardson H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40416-40424Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Furthermore, loss of DRONC function in earlyDrosophila embryos because of dronc RNA ablation results in a decrease in apoptosis, indicating that DRONC is required for programmed cell death during embryogenesis (20Quinn L.M. Dorstyn L. Mills K. Colussi P.A. Chen P. Coombe M. Abrams J. Kumar S Richardson H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40416-40424Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). These results suggest that DRONC is a key upstream caspase in mediating developmentally programmed cell death in Drosophila. The precise roles of DRICE, DECAY, and STRICA in programmed cell death in Drosophila have not been established. However, in vitro antibody depletion experiments suggest that DRICE is required for apoptotic activity in the S2 Drosophila cell line (21Fraser A.G. McCarthy N.J. Evan G.I. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6192-6199Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Similar to dronc, decay expression is high in larval midgut and salivary glands, but decayexpression is not regulated by ecdysone (12Dorstyn L. Read S.H. Quinn L.M. Richardson H. Kumar S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30778-30783Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Accumulation ofdronc and decay mRNA in salivary glands and midgut may be required to sensitize these tissues for deletion by apoptosis during metamorphosis. The presence of multiple caspases in Drosophila indicates that apoptotic pathways in insects are likely to be of similar complexity to those in mammals. To fully understand the role of various caspases in cell physiology, it is important to analyze all caspases in a given model organism. In this paper, we describe the initial characterization of DAMM, the last Drosophila caspase. damm was identified using a TBLASTN search of the Berkeley Drosophila Genome Project database, as a region of genomic DNA sequence displaying significant homology to mammalian caspases. From this region of homology, damm specific primers were designed and were used in conjunction with library-specific vector primers to amplify the full-length open-reading frame of damm from aDrosophila larval cDNA library. The 5′-end of thedamm open-reading frame was confirmed using 5′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) (Life Technologies). The cDNA sequence of damm has been deposited in the GenBankTM database under accession number AF240763. Multiple sequence alignments and construction of phylogenetic trees were carried out using Bionavigator software packages ClustalW and Protpars at the Australian National Genome Information Services server. damm product amplified from the Drosophila larval cDNA library was purified and cloned into pGEM®-T Easy (Promega). The 765-base pair coding region of damm was amplified from pGEM®-T Easy-damm using Pwopolymerase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and was cloned directionally into pcDNA3 (Invitrogen) using the following oligonucleotides: Primer A, 5′-ATGTATCTGCCCGAAAGAAC and Primer B, 5′-GCTCTAGATCACTTGTCATCGTCGTCCTTGTAGTCAGTGTTTTTAGCATAATTTCC. Primer B contained an XbaI site (italics) and sequence encoding a FLAG tag (underlined). The catalytic Cys156residue of DAMM was mutated to a Gly residue by QuikChange mutagenesis (Stratagene) using pcDNA3-dammFLAG as a template.dammFLAG and damm(C156G)FLAG were subcloned into pRmHa.3 (22Bunch T.A. Grinblat Y. Goldstein L.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 1043-1061Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar) and pGMR (23Hay B.A. Wolff T. Rubin G.M. Development. 1994; 120: 2121-2129Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Primer C, 5′-GGAATTCCATATGTATCTGCCCGAAAGAAC containing aNdeI site (denoted in italics) and primer D, 5′-CGCGGATCCCGAGTGTTTTTAGCATAATTTCC containing aBamHI site (denoted in italics) were used to amplify wild-type and catalytic Cys mutant damm for directional cloning into the pET32b vector (Novagen). Apoptosis inhibitor cDNAsdiap1, diap2, and p35 were amplified using Pwo polymerase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and the following primers: DIAP1A, 5′-CGGAATTCATGGCATCTGTTGTAGCTGATC; DIAP1B, 5′-CGCGGATCCGCGTCATGCGTAGTCTGGCACGTCGTATGGGTAAGAAAAATATACGCGCATC; DIAP2A, 5′-CGGAATTCATGACGGAGCTGGGCATG; DIAP2B, 5′-CGCGGATCCGCGTCATGCGTAGTCTGGCACGTCGTATGGGTAATCGATTTGCTTAACTGC; P35A, 5′-CGGAATTCATGTGTGTAATTTTTCCG; P35B, 5′-CGCGGATCCGCGTCATGCGTAGTCTGGCACGTCGTATGGGTATTTAATCATGTCTAATATTAC. In each case the forward primers contained an EcoRI site (in italics), whereas the reverse primers contained a BamHI site (in italics) and sequence encoding an HA tag (underlined).diap1HA, diap2HA, and p35HA were cloned into pRmHa.3 for expression in insect cells and into pcDNA3 for expression in mammalian cells. Recombinant DAMM protein was generated by transformation of E. coli BL21 (DE3) cells with DAMM-His6 constructs in pET32b. pET-damm and pET-dammC156G 6-h cultures were subcultured 1 in 25 and grown at 22 °C for 3 h. Cultures were induced with 1 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside and grown for a further 4 h. Cells were pelleted and lysed by sonication in assay buffer (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.0, 1 mm EDTA, 10% sucrose, 0.1% CHAPS, 5 mm dithiothreitol). ClearedE. coli lysates from cells expressing DAMM were assayed for protein concentration, and an equal amount of total protein from each lysate was incubated with 100 μm fluorogenic peptide substrates and assayed for caspase activity as described previously (24Harvey N.L.

Caspase substrates VEID-amino-methylcoumarin (-amc), DEVD-amino-trifluoromethylcoumarin (-afc), and YVAD-afc were from Bachem. VDVAD-amc was purchased from California Peptide Research Inc. LEHD-amc and IETD-amc were from Alexis Biochemicals. Expression of His6-tagged caspases inE. coli lysates was determined by immunoblotting using an α6×His antibody (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Full-lengthdamm in pcDNA3 was used as a template for the production of [35S]methionine-labeled protein using a coupled transcription/translation kit (Promega). 5 μl of translated product was incubated with recombinant enzyme lysates for 3 h at 37 °C, electrophoresed on 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, transferred to polyvinylidene membrane (Dupont) and exposed to x-ray film. NIH3T3 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal calf serum. For cell death assays, 2 × 105 cells were plated per 35-mm dish the day before transfection. 2 μg of plasmid DNA comprising either 2 μg of empty vector or 1 μg of pcDNA3-damm or pcDNA3-damm (C156G)together with 1 μg of empty vector, pcDNA3-diap1Myc, pcDNA3-p35HA, pRSV-bcl2, pcDNA3-crmA, or pcDNA3-mihA, was cotransfected with 0.5 μg of a β-galactosidase expression plasmid (pEF-βgal) (27Kumar S. Kinoshita M. Noda M. Copeland N.G. Jenkins N.A. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1613-1626Crossref PubMed Scopus (585) Google Scholar). All transfections in mammalian cells were carried out using Fugene6 transfection reagent (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) according to manufacturer's instructions. Cells were fixed and stained with X-gal at 24 or 48 h post-transfection, and β-galactosidase-positive cells were scored for apoptotic morphology as previously described (27Kumar S. Kinoshita M. Noda M. Copeland N.G. Jenkins N.A. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1613-1626Crossref PubMed Scopus (585) Google Scholar). Cell death assays in insect cells were carried out using Schneider L2 (SL2) cells as previously described (28Chen P. Lee P. Otto L Abrams J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25735-25737Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 29Colussi P.A. Quinn L.M. Huang D.C.S. Coombe M. Read S.H. Richardson H. Kumar S. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 703-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). SL2 cells were maintained and transfected using Cellfectin (Life Technology) as described (8Chen P. Rodriguez A. Erskine R. Thach T. Abrams J.M. Dev. Biol. 1998; 201: 202-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). For death assays, 1.5 × 106 SL2 cells were cotransfected with either 2 μg of vector or 1 μg of pRM-damm together with 1 μg of respective pRmHa.3 inhibitor constructs, pRM-diap1HA, pRM-diap2HA, or pRM-p35HA and 0.5 μg of pCASPERhs-βgalreporter. All death assays were performed in duplicate. 24 h post-transfection, cells were induced to express pCASPERhs-βgal by three cycles of heat shock at 37 °C for 30 min followed by 27 °C for 30 min. Following heat shock, one sample of each duplicate transfection was induced to express the respective pRmHa.3 constructs by the addition of CuSO4 at a final concentration of 0.7 mm. Cells were fixed and stained with X-gal 48 h post-CuSO4 induction as previously described (29Colussi P.A. Quinn L.M. Huang D.C.S. Coombe M. Read S.H. Richardson H. Kumar S. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 703-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Cell survival was calculated as the percent of transfected (β-galactosidase-positive) cells in the CuSO4-treated population relative to the percent of transfected cells in the untreated population. All calculations were normalized against the 100% survival value of vector transfected cells. The results, shown as average percentages ± S.E.M., were derived from three independent experiments. To check copper-induced protein expression after 48 h of CuSO4 treatment, cells were lysed in SDS-PAGE buffer, and lysates were subjected to immunoblotting using a rat monoclonal αHA antibody (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) or a mouse monoclonal αFLAG antibody (Sigma Chemical Co.). SL2 cells were transfected with pRM-dronc, pRM-dammFLAG, or pRM-decayFLAG as described above. 24 h following transfection, cells were induced to express respective constructs by the addition of CuSO4 at a final concentration of 0.7 mm. 24 h following copper induction, transfectants were treated with cycloheximide at a final concentration of 25 μg/ml for 8, 16, or 24 h. Expression and processing of DRONC, DAMM, and DECAY proteins was analyzed by SDS-PAGE electrophoresis of lysates from transfected cells and immunoblotting using either αDronc (20Quinn L.M. Dorstyn L.

As a positive control, pcDNA3-droncFLAG was cotransfected with pcDNA3-Mycdiap1 (20Quinn L.M. Dorstyn L. Mills K. Colussi P.A. Chen P. Coombe M. Abrams J. Kumar S Richardson H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40416-40424Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). 24 h post-transfection, cell lysates were prepared in lysis buffer (150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 50 mm Tris-HCl pH 7.5, supplemented with a 1× protease inhibitor mixture (Complete™, Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Lysates were immunoprecipitated with 2 μg of either an isotype-matched negative control antibody 3D3, or 2 μg of mouse monoclonal αFLAG antibody, the rat monoclonal αHA antibody, or a mouse monoclonal αMyc antibody (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Immunoprecipitated proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by immunoblotting using the above mentioned antibodies. Total RNA from various developmental stages of Drosophila or adult flies was prepared using RNAzol B according to the manufacturer's (Tel-Test Inc.) protocol. Approximately 20 μg of total RNA was electrophoresed on a 2.2 m formaldehyde gel and transferred to Biodyne A nylon membrane (Pall). The blot was hybridized to a32P-labeled damm cDNA coding region probe and exposed to Kodak XAR-5 film. For in situ RNA analysis, antisense and sense digoxigenin-labeled riboprobes were prepared using the appropriate RNA polymerase from a linearized dammcDNA clone. Digoxigenin labeling was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). In situ hybridization to Drosophila embryos and larval tissues were essentially as described (12Dorstyn L. Read S.H. Quinn L.M. Richardson H. Kumar S. J. Biol.

Wild-typedamm or dammC156G mutant cDNA, tagged with FLAG was cloned into the pGMR vector and transgenic flies were generated and maintained as previously described (31Richardson H. O'Keefe L.V. Marty T. Saint R. Development. 1995; 121: 3371-3379PubMed Google Scholar). For testing the interaction of GMR-dammC156G withGMR-hid or GMR-rpr, crosses were carried out at 18 °C. Progeny were scored by examining eye phenotypes using a light microscope, as previously described (31Richardson H. O'Keefe L.V. Marty T. Saint R. Development. 1995; 121: 3371-3379PubMed Google Scholar). While searching for new molecules with homology to various mammalian caspases using the TBLASTN program, we identified a genomic sequence contained in an entry (accession no.AC005466) in the Berkeley Drosophila Genome Project database that encoded a partial caspase-like molecule. We cloned the corresponding cDNA for this gene by a combination of PCR and 5′-RACE. The cDNA contained a predicted open-reading frame of 255 amino acid residues with a high degree of homology to mammalian caspases, particularly those related to the caspase-3 subfamily (Fig.1). We named this new molecule DAMM, fordeath-associated molecule related to Mch2. A comparison of the damm cDNA sequence and the annotated Drosophila genome sequence reveals that the coding region for DAMM is contained in 5 exons (Fig.1A). This differs from the predicted gene structure fordamm in the flybase. DAMM shares ∼29% amino acid sequence identity and 43% sequence similarity with caspase-6 (Mch-2) and 27% sequence identity and 46% sequence similarity with caspase-3. Of theDrosophila caspases, DAMM is most homologous to the newly identified caspase STRICA (Fig. 1C) (13Doumanis J. Quinn L.M. Richardson H. Kumar S. Cell Death Diff. 2001; 8: 387-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), sharing 44% sequence identity and 60% sequence similarity. The degree of homology between these two caspases is particularly striking given that DAMM does not possess the long prodomain of STRICA. Among otherDrosophila caspases, DAMM shares 28% sequence identity with DCP-1 and 26% identity with DECAY, DRICE, and DREDD. DAMM shares the least homology with DRONC among the Drosophila caspases with 23% sequence identity and 39% similarity. In RNA blots, damm was present as an ∼0.9-kilobase transcript in most developmental stages, larvae, pupae, and in the adult fly (Fig.2). Relatively high levels ofdamm transcript were detected in early 3rd instar larvae and in the adult fly (Fig. 2). We further analyzed the expression pattern of damm during Drosophila development by in situ hybridization to embryos and larval tissues using a digoxigenin-labeled antisense mRNA probe (Fig.3). damm is expressed at low levels throughout embryogenesis and shows no up-regulation at stage 11 (Fig. 3), when programmed cell death first becomes evident inDrosophila (32Abrams J.M. White K. Fessler L.I. Steller H. Development. 1993; 117: 29-43Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition to data shown for stage 5 and later embryos (Fig. 3, A–F) damm mRNA was also detected in stage 1–4 syncitial embryos (not shown), suggesting that it is maternally deposited into the embryo, because zygotic expression does not begin before stage 5 (33Edgar B.A. Schubiger G. Cell. 1986; 44: 871-877Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). In stage 5 cellularized embyros, damm mRNA is ubiquitously expressed (Fig.3A), but in later stages higher levels of dammtranscript were evident in specific cells and tissues (Fig. 3,C–F). For example, specific cells in developing salivary gland (Fig. 3D) and hindgut (Fig. 3E) showed staining for damm transcript. No staining was seen when adamm sense probe was hybridized to embryos at various stages of development (Fig. 3G and data not shown).Figure 3In situmRNA analysis ofdamm expression during Drosophiladevelopment.damm mRNA was detected byin situ hybridization with a digoxigenin-labeled antisense mRNA probe.

Low levels of dammexpression were observed in brain lobes (Fig. 3H), which contain apoptotic cells at this stage (34Wolff T. Ready D.F. Development. 1991; 113: 825-839PubMed Google Scholar). A relatively high level ofdamm expression was observed in midgut (Fig. 3I) and salivary glands (Fig. 3J) from late third instar larvae, preceding the onset of apoptosis in these tissues, which occurs after pupariation (35Jiang C. Baehrecke E.H. Thummel C.S. Development. 1997; 124: 4673-4683Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). During oogenesis damm mRNA is detected in egg chambers of all stages and in the nurse cells (Fig.3L and data not shown). No staining was seen when adamm sense probe was hybridized to salivary glands (Fig.3K), midgut (data not shown), or egg chambers at various stages of development (Fig. 3M and data not shown). Several other Drosophila caspases, including DCP-1 (15McCall K. Steller H. Science. 1998; 279: 230-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar), DRONC (11Dorstyn L. Colussi P. Quinn L.M.

Cell Death Diff. 2001; 8: 387-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) are also expressed in egg chambers; however, the function of these caspases, except for DCP-1, in oocyte and nurse cell death remains unclear. To investigate the caspase activity of DAMM, we expressed full-length wild-type and C156G mutant DAMM fused to His6 in E. coli. Lysates prepared from cultures induced with IPTG were tested for DAMM expression using an antibody against the 6xHis tag. Full-length DAMM was clearly detectable in E. coli lysates, however, processed fragments were not visible (Fig. 4A; data not shown). The E. coli lysates containing DAMM were incubated with a variety of fluorogenic tetrapeptide caspase substrates to analyze substrate preference. DAMM did not show any activity on DEVD-amc, but displ"
https://openalex.org/W2135387097,"The actions of prolactin (PRL) are mediated by its receptor, a member of the superfamily of single transmembrane cytokine receptors. High affinity binding proteins for the closely related growth hormone have been found in the sera of several species including humans and are generated by alternative splicing or proteolysis of the growth hormone receptor extracellular domain (ECD). In contrast, no conclusive evidence has been presented that an analogous prolactin-binding protein (PRLBP) is expressed in human serum. Using both monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies generated against hPRL and the ECD of the human prolactin receptor, co-immunoprecipitation analyses of human serum identified a 32-kDa hPRLBP capable of binding both hPRL and human growth hormone. A measurable fraction of circulating PRL (36%) was associated with the hPRLBP. Despite well documented sex differences in serum hPRL levels, there were no significant differences in the levels of hPRLBP found in the sera of normal adult males and females (15.3 ± 1.3 ng/mlversus 13.4 ± 0.8 ng/ml, respectively (mean ± S.E.)). Immunoprecipitation studies also detected the PRLBP in human milk albeit at lower concentrations than found in sera. Deglycosylation did not alter its electrophoretic mobility, indicating an absence of carbohydrate moieties and suggesting that the hPRLBP spans most of the PRLR ECD, a result confirmed by limited proteolysis and mass spectrometry. The potential function of this serum chaperone was assessed in vitro by the addition of recombinant hPRLBP to the culture medium of the PRL-dependent Nb2 T-cell line. These studies revealed that the hPRLBP antagonizes PRL action, inhibiting PRL-driven growth in a dose-dependent manner."
https://openalex.org/W1483753543,"Dbl is a guanine nucleotide exchange factor that activates the Rho family GTPases Cdc42, Rac, and Rho. Dbl and all three GTPases are strong activators of transcription factor NFκB, which has been shown to have an important role in Dbl-induced oncogenic transformation. Here we show that although Dbl activation of NFκB requires Cdc42, Rac, and Rho, the different GTPases activate NFκB by different mechanisms. Whereas Rac stimulates the activity of the IκB kinase IKKβ, Cdc42 and Rho activate NFκB without activating either IKKα or IKKβ. Like Dbl, Rac activation of IKKβ is mediated by the serine/threonine kinases NIK but not MEKK. This differs from Rac activation of the JNK pathway, which was previously shown to be mediated by MEKK. The pathway leading from Rho and Cdc42 to NFκB is more elusive, but our results suggest that it involves an IKKα/IKKβ-independent mechanism.

D'Souza-Schorey C. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2295-2322Crossref PubMed Scopus (2101) Google Scholar). Guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs)1 catalyze the activation of the GTPases by exchanging GDP for GTP. Dbl is a GEF that acts both in vivo and in vitro as an exchange factor for Cdc42, Rho, and Rac (2Cerione R.A. Zheng Y. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 216-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar, 3Whitehead I.P. Campbell S. Rossman K.L. Der C.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1332: F1-F23Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). Dbl contains a Dbl homology domain that is required for GEF activity (4Hart M.J. Eva A. Zangrilli D. Aaronson S.A. Evans T. Cerione R.A. Zheng Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 62-65Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) adjacent to a pleckstrin homology domain that is most likely responsible for proper localization at the membrane (5Zheng Y. Zangrilli D. Cerione R.A. Eva A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19017-19020Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Dbl is a representative prototype of a growing family of proto-oncogenes that contain Dbl homology/pleckstrin homology elements. Activated forms of the Dbl family members are associated with a variety of neoplastic pathologies (2Cerione R.A. Zheng Y. Curr. Opin.

It is generally thought that the activation of Rho family GTPases may be responsible for their potent transformation capabilities. Indeed, Cdc42, Rac, and Rho were each shown to contribute to distinct aspects of Dbl-induced transformation (7Lin R. Cerione R.A. Manor D. J. Biol.

Cytoskeletal organization and the regulation of gene expression are both likely to contribute to the cellular changes involved in cell growth and oncogenic transformation. Expression of constitutively active mutants of Rac and Cdc42 in many different cell types results in stimulation of the JNK (also known as stress-activated protein kinase) (19Hibi M. Lin A. Smeal T.

Cell. 1995; 81: 1159-1170Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1207) Google Scholar). The signaling pathway by which Rac and Cdc42 activate JNK has been well characterized. JNK activation by Rac and Cdc42 was shown to be mediated by the mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase MEKK, which phosphorylates the mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase JNKK (also known as SEK1 or MKK4 (25Lin A.

Besides MEKK, other mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinases such as the mixed lineage kinases have also been shown to mediate JNK activation in response to the GTPases (28Fanger G.R. Gerwins P. Widmann C. Jarpe M.B. Johnson G.L. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1997; 7: 67-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). More recently, the GTPases and some of their GEFs, including Dbl, have been shown to activate nuclear transcription factor-κB (NFκB) (29Perona R. Montaner S. Saniger L. Sanchez-Perez I. Bravo R.

In unstimulated cells, NFκB is usually found in the cytoplasm sequestered by a group of regulatory proteins known as IκBs (IκBα, -β, and -ε) (31Baldwin A.S. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1996; 14: 649-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (5592) Google Scholar). Exposure of cells to TNFα or interleukin 1 results in phosphorylation of IκBα on two critical serines. This targets IκB for ubiquitination-dependent degradation by the proteosome complex and leads to the release and subsequent translocation of NFκB to the nucleus where it can regulate the expression of target genes (31Baldwin A.S.

A large multiprotein complex containing two catalytic subunits, IKKα and IKKβ, is rapidly stimulated by interleukin 1 and TNFα (47DiDonato J.A. Hayakawa M. Rothwarf D.M. Zandi E. Karin M.

IKKα and IKKβ can form homodimers or heterodimersin vitro, and purified recombinant forms of each can directly phosphorylate IκBα and IκBβ at the proper sites (49Zandi E. Chen Y. Karin M. Science. 1998; 281: 1360-1363Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, the IKK complex contains a regulatory subunit, IKKγ, that appears to bind IKKα-IKKβ as a dimer (51Rothwarf D.M. Zandi E. Natoli G. Karin M. Nature. 1998; 395: 297-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (853) Google Scholar). The protein kinase NIK has been shown to phosphorylate and activate the IKKs and is thought to mediate IKK activation in response to stimuli such as TNFα (52Malinin N.L. Boldin M.P. Kovalenko A.V. Wallach D. Nature. 1997; 385: 540-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (1166) Google Scholar) and the expression of the Cot/Tpl-2 protein kinase (53Lin X. Cunningham Jr., E.T. Mu Y. Geleziunas R. Greene W.C.

Less is known about the signaling pathway by which Dbl and the Rho family GTPases activate NFκB. Here we show that the three GTPases, Cdc42, Rac, and Rho, activate NFκB by different pathways. Whereas Rac activates NFκB by a pathway that depends on IKKβ, Cdc42 and Rho activate NFκB in the absence of IKK stimulation. The Rac-dependent pathway requires NIK and the Rac effector PAK but does not require MEKK. Dbl requires both branches of the pathway for full activation of NFκB. pRK5-Myc-tagged Dbl (amino acids 495–826) was a gift from A. Hall and has been described previously (56Olson M.F. Pasteris N.G. Gorski J.L. Hall A. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 1628-1633Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). PAK1(T423E) and pEGFP-C1-hPAK1 (amino acids 83–149) (57Zhao Z.-S. Manser E.

Chernoff and has been described previously (59Martin G.A. Bollag G. McCormick F. Abo A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1970-1978Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). pCDNA3-NIK wild type and pCDNA3-NIK(KK-AA) were from R. Pestell. C3 transferase expression vector was a gift from R. Prywes. All cell lines were maintained at 37 °C in 5% CO2 and cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 50 units/ml penicillin, 50 µg/ml streptomycin, and 4 mm glutamine. HeLa and 293 cells were cultured in 10% fetal bovine serum; NIH3T3 cells were cultured in 10% bovine calf serum. Transient transfections into HeLa and NIH3T3 cells were carried out using the LipofectAMINE method (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Cells were seeded at a density of 3.7 × 105/3.5-cm-diameter dish and were starved 24 h after transfection in 0.2% serum. 293 cells were transfected using a standard calcium phosphate precipitation method. Luciferase assays were carried out in both HeLa and NIH3T3 cells with similar results. However, because the basal levels of luciferase activity were lower in HeLa cells, only these results are shown in the figures. In both cases, cells were transfected as described above and harvested 48 h after transfection. Luciferase assays were carried out using the dual luciferase kit (Promega). Firefly luciferase reporter constructs (200 ng of the pBIIX-Luc) were transfected together with 50 ng of theRenilla luciferase reporter plasmid pRL-TK as an internal control. Cells were lysed in 150 µl of passive lysis buffer (Promega), and 7.5 µl of lysate was assayed for firefly andRenilla luciferase activity according to the manufacturer's instructions. Transfection efficiencies were corrected through normalization of the firefly luciferase activity to the activity obtained from the Renilla Luciferase. All experiments were performed at least three times, and the results averaged. Statistical analyses were performed using the Student t test with significant differences established as p < 0.05. GST-IκBα-(1–54), GST-IκBα-(1–54;TT), in which Ser-32 and -36 were replaced by threonines, and GST-c-Jun-(1–79) were purified on glutathione-agarose beads as described elsewhere (55Nemoto S. DiDonato J.A. Lin A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 7336-7343Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For IKKβ assays, NIH3T3 cells were transfected with either HA-tagged IKKβ or GST-tagged IKKβ (pEBG-IKKβ) expression vectors. Both vectors gave identical results. For IKKα assays, 293 cells were used instead of NIH3T3 cells because IKKα was poorly expressed in NIH3T3 cells, and we could not get sufficient expression for immune complex kinase assays in these cells. In both cases, cells from each transfection were lysed in M2 buffer (60Minden A. Lin A. Smeal T. Derijard B. Cobb M. Davis R. Karin M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6683-6688Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar) 48 h after transfection. Approximately 100 µg of cell extracts was incubated with either anti-HA monoclonal antibody and protein A-Sepharose (for isolation of HA-IKK) or glutathione-agarose beads (Sigma) (for isolation of GST-IKK) and incubated 2 h to overnight at 4 °C. The immune complexes were washed twice in M2 buffer (58Minden A. Lin A. McMahon M. Lange-Carter C. Derijard B. Davis R.J. Johnson G.L. Karin M. Science. 1994; 266: 1719-1723Crossref PubMed Scopus (1012) Google Scholar) and twice in kinase buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2) and incubated at 30 °C in 30 µl of kinase buffer containing 20 mm β-glycerophosphate, 20 mm p-nitrophenyl phosphate, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 50 µmNa3V04, 20 µm ATP, and 5 µCi of [γ-32P]ATP. Approximately 2 µg of GST-IκBα wild type or S32T/S36T fusion protein was used as substrate in each reaction. Reactions were stopped after 30 min by denaturation in SDS loading buffer. Proteins were resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and substrate phosphorylation was visualized by autoradiography. For PAK1 autophosphorylation assays, Myc-tagged PAK was immunopurified from cell lysates using anti-Myc antibody. Immune complex kinase assays were carried out as described above for IKK in the absence of substrate, and the reaction was stopped after 20 min. PAK phosphorylation was then examined by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and autoradiography. JNK assays were performed as described previously (23Minden A. Lin A. Claret F.X. Abo A. Karin M. Cell. 1995; 81: 1147-1157Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1447) Google Scholar). Cells were harvested in M2 buffer (58Minden A. Lin A. McMahon M. Lange-Carter C. Derijard B. Davis R.J. Johnson G.L. Karin M. Science. 1994; 266: 1719-1723Crossref PubMed Scopus (1012) Google Scholar), and equal amounts of cellular proteins were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Immobilon P, Millipore Corp.). The membrane was immunoblotted with the appropriate antibody. The following antibodies were used: mouse monoclonal anti-HA 12CA5 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), anti-GST mouse monoclonal antibody (Sigma), mouse monoclonal anti-Myc 9E10 (Santa Cruz Biochemicals), mouse monoclonal anti-FLAG (Eastman Kodak Co.), rabbit polyclonal anti-IKKα antibody (Santa Cruz Biochemicals), and rabbit polyclonal anti-MEKK antibody (Santa Cruz Biochemicals). Immunocomplexes were visualized by the enhanced chemiluminescence detection method (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Focus formation assays in NIH3T3 cells were carried out as described previously (23Minden A. Lin A. Claret F.X. Abo A. Karin M. Cell. 1995; 81: 1147-1157Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1447) Google Scholar). To examine activation of NFκB, HeLa cells were transfected with the pBIIX-Luc reporter (which contains two NFκB sites and a fos minimal promoter upstream of the luciferase gene) together with either empty vector or vector containing oncogenic Dbl. Luciferase activity was measured 48 h after transfection. As seen in Fig.1 A, oncogenic Dbl activation of pBIIX-Luc was completely blocked by the super-repressor IκBα(S-A) (61Traenckner E.B. Pahl H.L. Henkel T. Schmidt K.N. Wilk S. Baeuerle P.A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2876-2883Crossref PubMed Scopus (934) Google Scholar), indicating that NFκB activation by Dbl is likely to be mediated by IκB phosphorylation (Fig. 1 A). To see whether Dbl activation of NFκB requires the Rho family GTPases, two inhibitors were used. The first was a PAKR expression vector. PAKR contains the regulatory domain of PAK2, which specifically binds to activated Rac and Cdc42 (59Martin G.A. Bollag G. McCormick F. Abo A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1970-1978Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). PAKR serves as an inhibitor of Cdc42 and Rac by titrating out the activated forms of the GTPases therefore blocking their ability to activate downstream effectors. The other inhibitor was a C3 transferase expression vector. C3 transferase specifically inhibits Rho activity (15Ridley A.J. Paterson H.F. Johnston C.L. Diekmann D. Hall A. Cell. 1992; 70: 401-410Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3084) Google Scholar, 17Ridley A.J. Hall A. Cell. 1992; 70: 389-399Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3843) Google Scholar). As seen in Fig.1 A, NFκB activity induced by Dbl is significantly blocked by expression of both PAKR and C3 transferase, suggesting that Cdc42 and/or Rac as well as Rho are necessary for its activation of NFκB. When both PAKR and C3 transferase were used together, the inhibition was even greater, suggesting that a pathway activated by Rac/Cdc42 cooperates with a Rho-activated pathway to activate NFκB. Although dominant negative Rac and Cdc42 also have an inhibitory effect on NFκB activation by Dbl (Fig. 1 A), PAKR is considered to be a more reliable inhibitor of endogenous Rac and Cdc42 in these assays because the N17 mutants are thought to function by binding to the GEFs and forming a rather stable complex that could titrate out the exchange factors (62Feig L.A. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: E25-E27Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). An inhibitory effect could therefore be attributed to titration of the Dbl protein. PAKR in contrast should specifically inhibit the activities of endogenous Rac and Cdc42 rather than Dbl. Dominant negative Cdc42 and Rac have different effects on NFκB activation by Dbl. This may reflect a different binding affinity of the different dominant negative mutants to Dbl, or it may reflect the fact that both of these mutants were expressed at different levels as shown in Fig. 1 A. Dominant negative mutants of IKKα and IKKβ were analyzed for their abilities to block Dbl activation of NFκB. These constructs were transfected together with oncogenic Dbl expression vector and the pBIIX-Luc reporter construct. Although dominant negative IKKβ significantly blocked Dbl activation of NFκB, dominant negative IKKα had very little effect (Fig. 1 B). Furthermore, when expressed together with suboptimal doses of IKKβ, Dbl could synergize with IKKβ to stimulate NFκB activity (Fig.1 C). Because the IKKs form a large complex that binds many proteins, a dominant negative IKKβ might therefore have a rather global effect in that it may titrate other important signaling molecules. To examine the role of the IKKs in more detail, we looked at the induction of the IKK enzymatic activity in response to oncogenic Dbl. To determine whether Dbl activates IKKβ, an in vitro kinase assay was carried out. In this assay pEGB-IKKβ (a eukaryotic expression vector containing GST-tagged IKKβ) was transfected with either empty vector or oncogenic Dbl. MEKKΔ, an activated form of MEKK that has previously been shown to be a strong activator of IKKβ (55Nemoto S. DiDonato J.A. Lin A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 7336-7343Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), was used as a positive control. After transient expression, GST-IKKβ expression levels were analyzed by Western blot and quantitated. Equal amounts of GST-IKKβ were then purified from cell lysates using glutathione-agarose-conjugated beads and assayed for the ability to phosphorylate bacterially expressed IκBα in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP. IκB phosphorylation was analyzed after SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and autoradiography. Dbl stimulated IKKβ activity to levels comparable with MEKKΔ (Fig.2 A). As expected, IKKβ that was activated by Dbl or MEKKΔ was not able to phosphorylate IκBα(S32T/S36T). The GST-IκBα(S32T/S36T) mutant is a very poor IKK substrate because the phospho-acceptor sites (serine 32 and serine 36) are replaced by threonine residues (63DiDonato J. Mercurio F. Rosette C. Wu-Li J. Suyang H. Ghosh S. Karin M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1295-1304Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 2 A,middle panel). Using a similar assay, we found that in contrast to IKKβ, Dbl could not activate IKKα (Fig. 2 B), whereas NIK, which was used as a positive control, activated IKKα, and MEKKΔ activated IKKα weakly. Because Dbl activation of NFκB appears to be mediated by IKKβ and the Rho family GTPases, we were interested in determining whether the Rho GTPases Cdc42, Rac, and Rho activate NFκB by an IKK-dependent pathway. All three GTPases activated the pBIIX-Luc promoter ∼6–10-fold (see Fig.3 A). Immune complex kinase assays were carried out to see whether the GTPases could also activate IKK. Surprisingly, we found that only activated Rac stimulated IKKβ activity, whereas activated RhoA only activated the kinase minimally, and activated Cdc42 did not activate the kinase at all (Fig.3 B). None of the GTPases activated IKKα (data not shown). This suggests that although Rac can activate NFκB via activation of IKK, Cdc42 and Rho may activate NFκB by an IKK-independent pathway. A well known target for Rac is the serine/threonine kinase PAK. PAK1 was recently shown to activate NFκB but not IKK (64Frost J.A. Swantek J.L. Stippec S. Yin M.J. Gaynor R. Cobb M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19693-19699Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). To determine whether PAK is required for Rac activation of IKK, IKKβ and activated Rac vectors were transfected along with either empty vector or the PAK1 autoinhibitory domain (PAK1-(83–149)), which is known to block endogenous PAK activity (57Zhao Z.-S.

Although a correlation exists between the tyrosine phosphorylation of the adherens junction protein β-catenin and loss of classical cadherin-mediated adhesion, the effects of tyrosine phosphorylation on the function of the adherens junction and desmosome-associated protein plakoglobin is unknown. In the present study, we investigated the effects of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase activation on the subcellular distribution of plakoglobin and its association with its junctional binding partners. Long term epidermal growth factor (EGF) treatment of A431 cells revealed a modest decrease in the cytoskeleton-associated pool of plakoglobin (Pg) and a corresponding increase in the cytosolic pool of Pg. After short term EGF treatment, plakoglobin was rapidly phosphorylated, and tyrosine-phosphorylated Pg was distributed predominantly in a membrane-associated Triton X-100-soluble pool, along with a co-precipitating high molecular weight tyrosine-phosphorylated protein identified as desmoglein 2. Analysis of deletion and point mutants defined the primary EGFR-dependent targets as one or more of three C-terminal tyrosine residues. Whereas phosphorylated Pg remained associated with the desmoglein tail after both short and long term EGFR activation, no phosphorylated Pg was found associated with the N-terminal Pg-binding domain (DPNTP) of the intermediate filament-associated protein, desmoplakin. Together these results are consistent with the possibility that EGF-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of Pg may modulate cell-cell adhesion by compromising the link between desmosomal cadherins and the intermediate filament cytoskeleton.

Moreover, the ability of cells to down-regulate or alter the adhesive capabilities of their cell-cell junctions is a contributing factor during tumor metastasis (4Ben-Ze'ev A. Curr. Opin.

Tyrosine phosphorylation of junctional components, and in particular phosphorylation of members of the armadillo family of proteins, has been proposed as a critical step in modulating cell-cell adhesion. Several lines of evidence suggest that tyrosine phosphorylation of the cadherin-catenin complex down-regulates cell adhesion and possibly the association of cadherin-catenin complexes with the cytoskeleton (5Behrens J.

These data suggest that these members of the armadillo family of proteins may function as modulatable components within complex adhesive structures allowing for rapid responses to intracellular or extracellular signals. In certain cell types, tyrosine phosphorylation of β-catenin has been correlated with decreased classical cadherin-mediated adhesion (7Hamaguchi M. Matsuyoshi N. Ohnishi Y. Gotoh B. Takeichi M.

Cell Biol. 1992; 118: 703-714Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar). In ras-transformed MCF-10A human breast epithelial cells, tyrosine phosphorylation of β-catenin correlated with an increased detergent solubility of both β-catenin and E-cadherin (8Kinch M.S. Clark G.J. Der C.J. Burridge K. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 461-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). The increased detergent solubility was interpreted as a decreased association with the cytoskeleton, as protein complexes associated with the cytoskeleton are generally thought to be Triton X-100-insoluble. Tyrosine phosphorylation of β-catenin in EGF-treated HSC-1 squamous carcinoma cells also correlated with an increased detergent solubility of E-cadherin (6Fujii K. Furukawa F. Matsuyoshi N. Exp. Cell Res. 1996; 223: 50-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). EGF treatment of MDA-MB-468 human breast cancer cells promoted dissociation of actin, α-actinin, and vinculin from the E-cadherin-catenin complex (10Hazan R.B. Norton L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9078-9084Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Treatment of K562 leukemia cells with pervanadate was shown to cause a significant amount of α-catenin to dissociate from the E-cadherin complex (16Ozawa M. Kemler R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6166-6170Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). In addition, both β-catenin and Pg were tyrosine-phosphorylated in response to pervanadate or EGF treatment, but their association with E-cadherin was not compromised (10Hazan R.B. Norton L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9078-9084Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar, 16Ozawa M. Kemler R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6166-6170Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). However, a recent in vitro study reported that Src-mediated phosphorylation of Tyr-654 of β-catenin regulates the interaction between E-cadherin and β-catenin (11Roura S. Miravet S. Piedra J. Herreros A.G.D. Dunach M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36734-36740Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (510) Google Scholar). Taken together, these reports suggest that tyrosine phosphorylation of β-catenin and Pg may lead to a decreased association of these proteins with the actin cytoskeleton. Through its ability to bind to either classic or desmosomal cadherin tails, Pg is a component of both desmosomes and adherens junctions and serves as a link between members of the cadherin family of proteins and cytoskeletal associated proteins (3Green K.J. Gaudry C.A. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 1: 208-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar, 17Cowin P. Kapprell H.-P. Franke W.W. Tamkun J. Hynes R.O.

Cytoskeletal-Membrane Interactions and Signal Transduction. Bioscience, Georgetown, Landes, TX1997: 12-30Google Scholar). Therefore, tyrosine phosphorylation of Pg may affect both classical and desmosomal cadherin-based adhesion. Although there is evidence suggesting that tyrosine phosphorylation of β-catenin may lead to a decreased association with the cytoskeleton, less is known about the effects of tyrosine phosphorylation on Pg and its association with cytoskeletal components. We sought to examine the effects of EGF treatment on Pg with the ultimate goal of understanding the possible contribution of Pg phosphorylation on the regulation of junctional interactions during EGF-triggered cell migration. We investigated the effect of long term and short term EGF treatment on the subcellular distribution of Pg and Pg truncation mutants using biochemical approaches in epithelial cells that assemble both desmosomes and adherens junctions. We detected modest shifts in the subcellular distribution of Pg during cell migration occurring after 24 h of EGF treatment. We confirmed that endogenous Pg in A431 cells was rapidly phosphorylated on one or more of three C-terminal tyrosine residues in response to EGF and was distributed exclusively in the membrane-soluble, non-junctional pool of proteins. Furthermore, while the interaction between Pg and the desmoglein tail was maintained, no interaction was detected between phosphorylated Pg and the N-terminal domain of desmoplakin (DP), which provides a link between the desmosomal plaque and the intermediate filament cytoskeleton (19Bornslaeger E.A.

Corcoran C.M. Denning M.F. Green K.J. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 773-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Collectively, these results are consistent with the idea that tyrosine phosphorylation of the Pg C terminus affects the ability of Pg to assemble into functional junctions by compromising anchorage of the intermediate filament cytoskeleton through DP, thus contributing to the remodeling of epithelia in response to growth factors during wound healing and invasion. Full-length human plakoglobin cDNA was isolated and subcloned into the mammalian expression vector LK 444 under the control of the human β-actin promoter (21Kowalczyk A.P. Palka H.L. Luu H.H.

The chimeric cadherin Ecad-Dsg1 comprising the extracellular domain of E-cadherin and the cytoplasmic domain of Dsg1 was constructed as described previously (20Kowalczyk A.P. Bornslaeger E.A.

Corcoran C.M. Stappenbeck T.S. Green K.J. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 985-1002Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). 11E4 was provided by Dr. M. Wheelock (University of Toledo), and the Pg C-terminal antibody was provided by Dr. J. Papkoff (Valentis Corporation, Burlingame, CA). The mouse monoclonal β-catenin antibody used for immunoprecipitations was purchased from Transduction Laboratories, Lexington, KY. The 5H10 mouse monoclonal β-catenin antibody and the desmoglein 2 monoclonal antibody 6D8 were kind gifts from Dr. M. Wheelock. The 795 rabbit polyclonal anti-E cadherin antibody was a kind gift from Dr. R. Marsh. The 1407 polyclonal antibody was raised in chickens using 400 μg of recombinant full-length Myc-tagged human Pg to immunize each animal (immunizations performed by Aves Labs, Tigard, OR). The anti-phosphotyrosine mouse monoclonal antibody 4G10 and the anti-Shc rabbit polyclonal antibody were purchased from Upstate Biotechnology Inc., Lake Placid, NY), and the anti-phosphotyrosine HRP-conjugated PY99 was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Rabbit and mouse IgG (clone MOPC 31C) were obtained from Sigma. The anti-FLAG epitope M2 monoclonal antibody coupled to agarose beads was purchased from Sigma. EGFR monoclonal antibodies Ab12 and Ab13 were purchased from Neomarkers (Fremont, CA). For immunoblotting, the following dilutions were used: concentrated 11E4 supernatant (1:2000), NW161 (1:2500), 1407 (1:5000), 9E10 (1:2), Ab12, Shc antibody and 6D8 ascites (1:1000), 5H10 hybridoma supernatant (1:100), 4G10 (1:1000), and PY99 (1:200). Primary antibodies were diluted in PBS, 5% milk. Secondary antibodies, goat anti-mouse peroxidase, goat anti-rabbit peroxidase, and goat anti-chicken peroxidase (Kirkegaard & Perry Laboratories, Gaithersburg, MD), were used at a dilution of 1:5000 in PBS, 5% milk. Antibodies were detected using enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). For immunoprecipitations, 2–5 μl of concentrated 11E4, 1 μl of the rabbit polyclonal antibody directed against the C terminus of plakoglobin, 3 μg of rabbit or mouse IgG, 2 μl of the E-cadherin 795 rabbit polyclonal antibody, 6 μl of 9E10 ascites, 3 μg of monoclonal β-catenin antibody, 5 μl of 6D8 ascites, 5 μl of EGFR Ab13 antibody, or 40 μl of M2 agarose were used per reaction. COS-7 cells, 24 h post-transient transfection, or A431 cell lines grown to 80% confluence in 60-mm culture dishes or on glass coverslips in 35-mm culture dishes were rinsed with complete PBS and incubated 12–24 h in serum-free DMEM containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin (w/v). Cells were treated with 10−8m EGF (Biomedical Technologies Inc., Stoughton, MA), prepared in serum-free DMEM containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin, for designated times and then rinsed with cold complete PBS. Cells were then processed for sequential detergent extraction or immunoprecipitation. Cells were grown to 80% confluence on 60-mm culture dishes, treated with EGF, rinsed in complete PBS, and subjected to sequential detergent extraction as described previously (22Palka H.L. Green K.J. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 2359-2371Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For subsequent immunoprecipitation, 1 ml of detergent buffer was used for extraction (22Palka H.L. Green K.J. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 2359-2371Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Triton X-100-insoluble proteins were solubilized in 100 μl of solubilization buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 1% SDS, 5 mm EDTA, 2 mm EGTA, 0.1 mmdithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), heated at 95 °C for 10 min to aid in solubilization, diluted with 900 μl of dilution buffer (15 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 5 mmEDTA, 2 mm EGTA, 1% Triton X-100, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 120 mm NaCl, 25 mm KCl, 0.1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), and centrifuged at ∼14,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C prior to immunoprecipitation. Immunoprecipitations were conducted using the appropriate antibody as described previously (22Palka H.L. Green K.J. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 2359-2371Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE on 7.5% gels and subsequent immunoblot analysis. Co-immunoprecipitations were carried out as described previously unless otherwise specified (20Kowalczyk A.P.

Immune complexes were released by incubation in reducing Laemmli sample buffer at 95 °C and were subjected to SDS-PAGE on 7.5% gels and subsequent immunoblot analysis. In response to treatment with the pro-migratory growth factors EGF or hepatocyte growth factor, epithelial cells such as HT29 or A431 scatter and lose their intercellular connections (27Shibamoto S. Hayakawa M. Takeuchi K. Hori T. Oku N. Miyazawa K. Kitamura N. Takeichi M. Ito F. Cell Adh. Commun. 1994; 1: 295-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar, 28Malliri F. Symons M. Henningan R.F. Hurlstone A.F.L. Lamb R.F. Wheeler T. Ozanne B.W. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1087-1099Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Phase contrast microscopy confirmed the effect of long term EGF treatment on A431 cells (Fig.1 A). In the absence of EGF, A431 cells remained in compact colonies (Fig. 1 A, a). After 24 h of EGF treatment the cells acquired a more motile, fibroblastic morphology (Fig. 1 A, b). In order to determine the subcellular distribution of the adherens junction and desmosome component Pg after prolonged EGF treatment, immunofluorescence using a monoclonal antibody against Pg was performed (Fig. 1 A, c andd). After 24 h of EGF treatment, the cell-cell border staining typical of Pg (Fig. 1 A, c) was shifted to a more cytoplasmic localization, although some staining at cell-cell borders could still be observed (Fig. 1 A, d). This observation was further confirmed by subjecting A431 cells to sequential detergent extraction to release cytosolic (saponin-soluble) proteins, membrane-bound (Triton-soluble) proteins, and (Triton-insoluble) presumably junction or cytoskeleton-associated proteins after 0, 12, or 24 h of EGF treatment. Western blot analysis of the different pools revealed a modest, reproducible increase in the cytosolic pool and a concomitant decrease in the detergent-insoluble pool of Pg (Fig.1, B and C). The Western blot shown in Fig.1 B is representative of five different experiments, and results of ECL detection were confirmed by reprobing with an125I-conjugated secondary antibody (data not shown). Data from three experiments were quantified using the Molecular Analyst software and plotted as percentage of total plakoglobin (Fig. 1 C, upper graph). Results were also expressed as the difference between the percentage of total plakoglobin present in the Triton-insoluble pool and the cytosolic pool. This difference in the percentage of total Pg significantly decreases (p < 0.05) over the time course of EGF treatment (Fig. 1 C, lower graph), thus illustrating the shift in Pg solubility upon long term EGF treatment. In addition to these alterations seen when normalizing to total Pg, a decrease in total Pg levels was frequently observed, possibly due to increased turnover of protein in the soluble non-junctional cell compartment (not shown). When this decrease is taken into account, alterations in each subcellular fraction are even more pronounced. Although Pg has been shown to be tyrosine-phosphorylated in response to growth factors such as EGF and hepatocyte growth factor/Scatter Factor (13Hoschuetzky H. Aberle H. Kemler R. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 1375-1380Crossref PubMed Scopus (673) Google Scholar, 27Shibamoto S. Hayakawa M. Takeuchi K. Hori T. Oku N. Miyazawa K. Kitamura N. Takeichi M. Ito F. Cell Adh. Commun. 1994; 1: 295-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar), the effect of tyrosine phosphorylation on Pg subcellular distribution and interaction with junctional binding partners is unknown. To begin to address this question, we analyzed Pg phosphorylation status and subcellular distribution following short term EGF treatment. Different Pg constructs represented in Fig. 2 were established for these studies. First, A431 cells were treated with EGF for 1, 2, and 5 min and subjected to a sequential detergent extraction. By using the Pg-specific antibody 11E4, endogenous Pg was immunoprecipitated from each cell fraction. The subcellular distribution of Pg in the absence of EGF was similar to its previously described (22Palka H.L. Green K.J. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 2359-2371Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) distribution under normal growth conditions, that is a small proportion of Pg was cytosolic but the majority of the protein was distributed between the Triton-soluble and Triton-insoluble pools (Fig.3 B, EGF 0 min). Treatment of A431 cells with EGF for 2 or 5 min did not detectably alter the subcellular distribution of total Pg (Fig. 3 B, EGF 2 and5 min). After EGF treatment, Pg was rapidly phosphorylated on tyrosine residues (Fig. 3 A), consistent with previous reports (13Hoschuetzky H. Aberle H. Kemler R. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 1375-1380Crossref PubMed Scopus (673) Google Scholar). Although Pg protein was detected in all three subcellular pools using the Pg-specific antibody, tyrosine-phosphorylated Pg was found predominantly in the membrane-associated Triton-soluble pool of proteins and not in the Triton-insoluble, junction-associated pool (Fig. 3 A). β-Catenin has been shown to be phosphorylated directly by the EGF receptor in vitro (13Hoschuetzky H. Aberle H. Kemler R. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 1375-1380Crossref PubMed Scopus (673) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the armadillo repeats of β-catenin were not phosphorylated, suggesting that tyrosine residues in the N and/or C termini of β-catenin were targets for EGF receptor phosphorylation. Plakoglobin, which has high structural identity to β-catenin (18Gelderloos J.A. Witcher L. Cowin P. Klymkowsky M.W. Cowin P. Klymkowsky M. Cytoskeletal-Membrane Interactions and Signal Transduction. Bioscience, Georgetown, Landes, TX1997: 12-30Google Scholar), has a total of 22 tyrosine residues, 5 in the N terminus, 11 in the armadillo repeats, and 6 in the C terminus. To determine whether the Pg end domains are required for EGF-dependent tyrosine phosphorylationin vivo, A-431.PgΔC and A431.PgΔN cells lines stably expressing C- or N-terminal Pg truncations were established and subjected to EGF stimulation and sequential detergent extraction as above for endogenous Pg. The PgΔN polypeptide lacks the 5 tyrosine residues in the N terminus, whereas the PgΔC polypeptide lacks the 6 tyrosine residues in the C terminus and 1 tyrosine residue from the 13th armadillo repeat (Fig. 2). By using a Pg antibody that recognizes both endogenous and ectopic Pg, endogenous Pg and PgΔC were immunoprecipitated from each subcellular fraction. PgΔC was detected in all three pools with the majority of PgΔC in the Triton-soluble and Triton-insoluble pools (Fig.3 D). Similar to Pg from control cells, EGF treatment did not detectably alter the subcellular distribution of the Triton-insoluble or -soluble pools; however, a small increase in the cytosolic pool of the PgΔC deletion was observed. After EGF treatment tyrosine-phosphorylated endogenous Pg was detected (Fig. 3 C, asterisk), but phosphorylation of PgΔC was not detectable (Fig.3 C, arrowhead), suggesting that the Pg C terminus is required for EGF-induced tyrosine phosphorylation (Fig. 3 Cand Fig. 5 A). A small amount of tyrosine-phosphorylated endogenous Pg was present in the cytosolic pool, consistent with its previously reported association with PgΔC (22Palka"

Although a great deal is known of the cytoplasmic signaling pathways activated by VEGF, much less is known of the mechanisms through which VEGF communicates with the nucleus and alters the activity of transcription factors. Binding of VEGF to the KDR/Flk1 receptor tyrosine kinase induces phosphorylation of the CRE-binding protein (CREB) transcription factor on serine 133 and increases CREB DNA binding and transactivation. p38 MAPK/MSK-1 and protein kinase C/p90RSK pathways mediate CREB phosphorylation. Confocal microscopy shows that VEGF-induced phosphorylation of nuclear CREB is blocked by pharmacological inhibition of protein kinase C and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling. Thus, KDR/Flk1 uses multiple pathways to transmit signals into the nucleus where CREB becomes activated.

Tojo A. Matushime H. Sato M. Oncogene. 1990; 5: 519-524PubMed Google Scholar). Flk1 and Flt1 are essential for fetal angiogenesis, and mouse embryos null for either receptor die in utero between days 8.5 and 9.5 (22Fong G.-H. Rossant J. Gertsenstein M. Breitman M.L.

Gertsenstein M. Wu X.-F. Breitman M.L. Schuh A.C.

Rossant J. Gertsenstein M. Breitman M.L. Nature. 1995; 376: 66-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (2224) Google Scholar). The phenotypes of Flk1- and Flt1-deficient embryos show that each plays a distinct role in angiogenesis and suggest that KDR/Flk1 and Flt1 utilize distinct signaling cascades to elicit responses. Flk1 is abundant on the proliferating endothelial cells of vascular sprouts of embryonic and early postnatal brain but is reduced in adult brains in which endothelial cell proliferation has ceased (17Millauer B.

Experiments with mutant forms of VEGF that selectively bind one or the other VEGF receptor show that Flk1/KDR promotes endothelial cell proliferation and survival (24Keyt B.A. Nguyen H.V.

The induction of chemotaxis and procoagulant activity by VEGF and placental growth factor (PlGF), a VEGF homolog that binds Flt1, suggests that these responses are mediated, at least in part, by Flt1 (25Clauss M.

Thus, the functions of VEGF are segregated between its two receptors. In previous studies we demonstrated that VEGF promotes the tyrosine phosphorylation of signaling molecules that contain SH2 domains, and this process is associated with endothelial cell proliferation (28Guo D. Jia Q. Song H.-Y. Warren R.S. Donner D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6729-6733Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar). By comparing signaling events induced by VEGF or PlGF, in the absence or presence of SU5416, a KDR/Flk1 antagonist (29Strawn L.M. McMahon G. App H. Schreck R. Kuchler W.R. Longhi M.P. Hui T.H. Tang C. Levitski A. Gaxrit A. Chen I. Keri G. Orfi L. Risau W. Flamme I. Ullrich A. Hirth K.P. Shawver L.K. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 3540-3545PubMed Google Scholar), we identified signaling molecules that interact with and promote or inhibit KDR/Flk1 action (30Wu L.W. Mayo L.D. Dunbar J.D. Kessler K.M.

The present study finally identifies pathways through which cytoplasmic signaling pathways downstream of KDR/Flk1 transmit signals into the nucleus. VEGF promotes phosphorylation and activation of the cyclic AMP-responsive element-binding protein by activation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase/MSK-1 and protein kinase C/p90RSK signaling pathways downstream of KDR. As CREB is a transcription factor that plays an important role in promoting proliferation and cellular adaptive responses (31Shaywitz A.J. Greenberg M.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 821-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (1797) Google Scholar), a mechanism has been defined through which VEGF/KDR may allow endothelial cells to respond to changes in their environment through alterations of gene expression. Human recombinant VEGF was a gift from Genentech (South San Francisco, CA). SU5416 was a gift from SUGEN, Inc. (South San Francisco, CA). Placenta growth factor and VEGF-D were from R & D Laboratories (Minneapolis, MN). Antibodies to phosphorylated CREB/ATF-1, phosphorylated MSK-1, phosphorylated and non-phosphorylated p38 MAPK, and MAPK were from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA). Anti-MAPKAP kinase 2 and recombinant ATF-1 were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Anti-MAPKAP kinase 3 was from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. (Lake Placid, NY). PGAL4-CREB was from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA), and the GAL4 luciferase reporter construct was a kind gift of Dr. Lawrence Quilliam (Indiana University School of Medicine). GF109203X was from LC Laboratories (Boston). All other inhibitors were from Calbiochem or Sigma. HUVEC were grown on 0.2% gelatin-coated tissue culture plates in endothelial cell growth medium (Clonetics, San Diego) under 5% CO2 at 37 °C. For VEGF stimulation, the cells were cultured in endothelial cell basal medium (Clonetics) that was supplemented with 1% bovine serum albumin. After 16 h, the cells were treated with various inhibitors as described in the figure legends and then stimulated with 1 nm VEGF for 10 min. Cells were harvested into lysis buffer (50 mmHepes, pH 7.0, 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1.2% Triton X-100, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 100 mm NaF, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate) that was supplemented with 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.15 units/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml pepstatin A and incubated on ice for 30 min, being vortexed every 10 min. Fifty micrograms from each sample was fractionated by SDS-PAGE and then transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. The membranes were blocked in 5% nonfat dried milk in PBST. Antibodies used to probe the Western blots were p-ERK, ERK, p38 MAPK, MAPK, pCREB, and CREB (Cell Signaling Technologies, Beverly, MA). Proteins on the Western blots were detected using the enhanced chemiluminescent detection system. Whole cell lysates were prepared from HUVEC treated with medium or VEGF for 10 min as described above. In independent experiments, MAPKAP kinase-2, MAPKAP kinase-2, or MSK-1 were immunoprecipitated from 500 μg of whole cell lysate (2-h incubations at 4 °C using 2 μg of an antibody specific to each kinase). Protein A/G-agarose was added and incubation continued for 1 h. After centrifugation, the pellets were washed with kinase assay buffer (20 mm MOPS, pH 7.2, 25 mm, β-glycerol phosphate, 5 mm EGTA, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 75 mm MgCl2, 1 mmdithiothreitol), and this procedure was repeated twice. The washed pellet was incubated for 10 min at 37 °C in 25 μl of kinase assay buffer modified to contain 50 μm ATP and 1 μg of recombinant ATF-1. Immunoprecipitated proteins were fractionated on 8% polyacrylamide gels, and Western blots were probed with antibodies to phosphorylated CREB/ATF-1 or p-MSK-1. Nuclear protein extracts were prepared using the NE-PER kit by cell lysis and centrifugation according to the directions of the manufacturer (Pierce). The CRE and mutant CRE double-stranded DNA oligonucleotides were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. The CRE oligonucleotide was end-labeled with γ-32P using the T4 polynucleotide kinase and purified by passage through G-25 spin column. To initiate formation of DNA-protein complexes 6 μg of each nuclear extract, binding buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mm KCl, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl, 1 mm EDTA, 5 mm dithiothreitol, and 5% glycerol), and 1 μg of poly(dI-dC) in a final volume of 20 μl were incubated on ice for 10 min, and then 5 ng of end-labeled oligonucleotide was added to the reaction which was continued for an additional 20 min. The reaction mixture was fractionated on a 5% native polyacrylamide gel (1.5 h, 180 V). The gel was dried and exposed to film. For gene reporter assays, cells were transiently cotransfected with β-galactosidase and CMV-Gal4-CREB (a plasmid consisting of the DNA binding domain of Gal4 and the transactivation domain of CREB) and pGal4-Tk-Luc (an expression vector for the luciferase reporter gene driven by the enhancerless thymidine kinase promoter linked to four copies of the Gal4 regulatory sequence). After 24 h, luciferase activity was assayed in cell lysates and normalized to β-galactosidase expression. HUVEC incubated with vehicle, SB202190, or GF109203X for 1 h and then with VEGF for 10 min were fixed, permeated with 0.1% Triton X-100, and blocked with 2% bovine serum albumin. Anti-phospho-CREB was added followed by a Texas Red-conjugated sheep anti-rabbit secondary antibody. The nucleus was detected by staining with nuclear dye Syto 16. Excitation of the stains was performed on a Bio-Rad MRC 1024 Krypton/Argon laser confocal imaging system. Experiments were conducted to determine whether VEGF induces CREB phosphorylation and transactivation and, if so, to identify the receptor through which this effect is mediated. HUVEC were stimulated with VEGF, and a Western blot prepared from cell lysates was probed with an antibody directed toward CREB phosphorylated on serine 133. VEGF induced CREB phosphorylation in a time-dependent manner (Fig. 1A). Due to the structural similarities between CREB and ATF-1 (31Shaywitz A.J. Greenberg M.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 821-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (1797) Google Scholar), the phospho-CREB antibody also recognizes phosphorylated serine 63 of ATF-1. The phosphorylation kinetics CREB and ATF-1 increased in parallel. To evaluate which VEGF receptor was responsible for inducing CREB and ATF-1 phosphorylation, HUVEC were stimulated with VEGF or PlGF, which only binds Flt1 (26Park J.E. Chen H.H. Winer J. Houck K.A. Ferrara N. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5646-25654Google Scholar, 27Sawano A. Takahashi T. Yamaguchi S. Aonuma M. Shibuya M. Cell Growth Differ. 1996; 7: 213-221PubMed Google Scholar). VEGF, but not PlGF, induced CREB phosphorylation, showing that KDR induced this event (Fig.1B). Additionally, SU5416, a low molecular weight KDR antagonist (29Strawn L.M. McMahon G. App H. Schreck R. Kuchler W.R. Longhi M.P. Hui T.H. Tang C. Levitski A. Gaxrit A. Chen I. Keri G. Orfi L. Risau W. Flamme I. Ullrich A. Hirth K.P. Shawver L.K. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 3540-3545PubMed Google Scholar), abrogated VEGF-induced CREB and ATF-1 phosphorylation. To exclude further the possibility that Flt1 contributes to activation of CREB, VEGF-D, another member of the VEGF family does not bind Flt1 (32Achen M.G. Jeltsch M. Kukk E. Makinen T. Vitali A. Wilks A.F. Alitalo K. Stacker S.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 548-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (1020) Google Scholar), was tested and found to induce phosphorylation of CREB and ATF-1 (Fig. 1C). Phosphorylation of serine 133 in CREB does not alter the DNA binding of CREB to CRE, but increases its association with adapter proteins such as the CREB-binding protein, leading to activation of transcription. Therefore, the demonstration that treatment of HUVEC with VEGF leads to phosphorylation of CREB downstream of KDR next led us to evaluate whether CREB transcriptional activity was increased by VEGF. A gene reporter assay in which HUVEC were transfected with pGal4-CREB and a Gal4 luciferase reporter construct demonstrated that VEGF induces a 2.5-fold stimulation of CREB transcriptional activation (Fig.1D). Experiments were next conducted to identify the signaling pathways that mediated CREB phosphorylation. By probing Western blots of HUVEC with antibodies to activated MAPK (ERK1 and -2) and p38 MAPK, we found that VEGF activates these each of these kinases, with maximal activation occurring after 10 min (Fig. 2,A and B). To test whether activation of MAPK family members was mediated by signaling through KDR, HUVEC were incubated in the absence or presence of SU5416 and then stimulated with VEGF or PlGF. The KDR antagonist abrogated VEGF activation of p38 MAPK (Fig. 3A) and ERK1 and ERK2 (Fig. 3B), indicating that the MAPKs are activated through KDR signaling. This result is consistent with the inability of PlGF to activate p38 MAPK or MAPK (Fig. 3, A and B).Figure 3p38 MAPK and MAPK are activated by signaling through KDR. HUVEC incubated in the absence or presence of 1 μm SU5416 were treated with VEGF. A, a Western blot was probed with anti-phospho-p38 MAPK (top) and then with anti-p38 MAPK (bottom). B, a Western blot was probed with anti-pMAPK (top) and then with anti-MAPK (bottom).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To determine whether MAPK, or p38 MAPK, plays a role in CREB phosphorylation, HUVEC were treated with PD98059, a MAPK kinase inhibitor that blocks MAPK activation (33Dudley D.T. Pang L. Decker S.J. Bridges A.J. Saltiel A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7686-7689Crossref PubMed Scopus (2595) Google Scholar), or SB202190, an inhibitor of p38 MAPK (34Cuenda A. Rouse J. Doza Y.N. Meier R. Cohen P. Gallagher T.F. Young P.R. Lee J.C. FEBS Lett. 1995; 364: 229-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (1981) Google Scholar), and then with VEGF. CREB phosphorylation induced by VEGF was unaffected by inhibition of MAPK by PD98059. However, p38 MAPK inhibition partly suppressed CREB phosphorylation (Fig.4A), showing that this member of the MAPK family plays a role in VEGF activation of CREB. We next examined whether other kinases contribute to CREB activation by VEGF. HUVEC were treated with wortmannin, an inhibitor of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, H89, an inhibitor of protein kinase A, K252A, an inhibitor of calmodulin kinase II, or GF109203X, an inhibitor of protein kinase C (PKC) (35Toullec D. Pianetti P. Coste H. Bellevergue P. Grand-Perret T. Ajakane M. Baudet V. Boissin P. Boursier E. Loriollle F. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 5771-15781Google Scholar). PD98059 and SB202190 were included in the experiment as positive and negative controls. LY294002, H89, and K252A did not impair CREB phosphorylation induced by VEGF, whereas GF109203X partly inhibited phosphorylation (Fig. 4B). Treatment of cells with GF109203X and SB202190 showed that inhibition of PKC and p38 MAPK had no effect on basal CREB phosphorylation but blocked VEGF-induced phosphorylation (Fig. 4C). To identify the downstream kinase that mediated CREB phosphorylation induced by PKC, HUVEC were incubated with GF102203X or SB202190 and then with VEGF (Fig. 4D). A Western blot prepared from cell lysates was probed with an antibody to phosphorylated (active) p90RSK, a CREB kinase downstream of PKC. VEGF promoted p90RSK phosphorylation and this was inhibited by GF102203X, but not SB202190, suggesting that a PKC/p90RSK pathway is a component of the mechanism through which VEGF induces CREB phosphorylation. MAPKAP kinase 2, MAPKAP kinase 3, and MSK-1 are CREB and ATF-1 kinases activated by p38 MAPK (36Deak M. Clifton A.D. Lucocq L.M. Alessi D.R. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4226-4241Crossref PubMed Scopus (846) Google Scholar, 37Price M.A. Cruzalegui F.H. Treisman R. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6552-6563Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar, 38Tan Y.

Biol. 1998; 18: 1946-1955Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As antibodies to phosphorylated forms of each of these CREB kinases are not available, their activation was determined by an in vitro kinase assay in which ATF-1 was the substrate. HUVEC were stimulated with vehicle or VEGF, and then MAPKAP kinase 2, MAPKAP kinase 3, or MSK-1 were immunoprecipitated from cell lysates and incubated with ATF-1. A Western blot was probed with an antibody to phosphorylated CREB/ATF-1 and, of the three kinases, VEGF activated only MSK1 (Fig. 4E). HUVEC were next incubated with GF102203X or SB202190, to inhibit PKC and p38 MAPK activation, respectively, and then stimulated with VEGF. MSK1 immunoprecipitated from cell lysates was incubated with ATF-1 and a Western blot probed with anti-phospho-CREB/ATF-1 and then with anti-phospho-MSK-1. VEGF induced phosphorylation of ATF-1 and MSK-1, and this was blocked by inhibition of p38 MAPK but not PKC (Fig.4F). This result suggests that activation of p38 MAPK/MSK1 is a component of a signaling cascade through which VEGF induces CREB phosphorylation. Confocal microscopy was conducted to establish a bridge between phosphorylation of CREB on serine 133 and subsequent DNA binding of the transcription factor. HUVEC were stimulated with VEGF or treated with inhibitors of PKC and p38 MAPK and then with VEGF. Confocal microscopy established that nuclear phosphorylation of CREB was induced by VEGF, and this was inhibited by pharmacological blockade of the p38 MAPK and PKC signaling cascades (Fig. 5). CREB binds to the specific sequence, 5′-TGFCGTCA-3′, known as CRE. An electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) showed that stimulation of HUVEC with VEGF induced the formation of a protein-DNA complex. The protein-DNA complex was lost upon addition of control but not mutant CRE. Furthermore, supershifting with antibodies directed against CREB, c-Fos, and ATF2 showed that only CREB was a component of the retarded DNA-protein complex induced by VEGF (Fig.6A). To establish that KDR was the receptor required for induction of CREB/DNA binding, HUVEC were treated with SU5416 before incubation with VEGF. CREB DNA binding was absent after exposure of HUVEC to SU5416, demonstrating that KDR is required for activation of CREB (Fig. 6B). Angiogenesis requires the coordinated expression of gene products that allow endothelial cells to alter their environment, proliferate, migrate, and intubate (2Risau W. Nature. 1997; 386: 671-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (4867) Google Scholar). Physiological processes, such as wound healing, or pathological processes, such as tumor growth, require that the cells involved switch from a quiescent to an angiogenic phenotype (2Risau W. Nature. 1997; 386: 671-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (4867) Google Scholar). This process, called the angiogenic switch, is characterized by increased production of angiogenic mediators, such as VEGF and its receptors, decreased production of inhibitors of angiogenesis, such as thrombospondin, or both types of events (8Breier G.

Focal adhesion kinase is associated with cell migration, whereas phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/AKT and MAPK signaling promote cell survival (47Parrizas M. Saltiel A.R. LeRoith D. J. Biol.

KDR/Flk1 binds a novel adaptor protein, VRAP, which may shuttle proteins that contain SH2 domains to the receptor (48Wu L.W. Mayo L.D. Dunbar J.D. Kessler K.M. Ozes O.N. Warren R.S. Donner D.B. J.

The level of SHP-1 associated with KDR/Flk1 is augmented by tumor necrosis factor, indicating that the activity of this receptor and its association with signaling proteins is regulated by cytokines (49Guo D.-Q.

Stimulation of porcine aortic endothelial cells overexpressing KDR/Flk1 or Flt1 with VEGF induces association of the former, but not the latter, receptor with Shc, Grb2, Nck, SHP-1, and SHP-2 (50Kroll J.

MAPK activation, changes of cell morphology, actin reorganization, membrane ruffling, chemotaxis, and cell proliferation are also induced by signaling through KDR/Flk1. These distinctions between KDR/Flk1 and Flt1 were not observed in studies with NIH 3T3 cells transfected with these receptors (52Seetharam L. Gotoh N. Maru Y. Neufeld G. Yamaguchi S. Shibuya M.

Wernstedt C. Engstrom U. Claesson-Welsh L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23410-23418Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). However, the weight of evidence from experiments indicates that KDR/Flk1 is a pleiotropic inducer of VEGF action in the endothelium, whereas the role of Flt1 needs to be resolved more clearly. Thus, considerable insight has been gained into cytoplasmic events initiated by VEGF in support of its activities. Far less is known of how VEGF induces changes of gene expression that underlie angiogenesis. CREB is a 43-kDa member of the CREB/CREM/ATF family of nuclear transcription factors that was first identified as a mediator of cyclic AMP-induced gene expression (55Montminy M.R. Bilezikjian L.M. Nature. 1987; 328: 175-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (968) Google Scholar). Activation of CREB is mediated by phosphorylation of serine 133 (56Gonzalez G.A. Montminy M.R. Cell. 1989; 59: 675-680Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2064) Google Scholar), which augments CREB-induced gene transcription (57Ginty D.D. Bonni A. Greenberg M.E. Cell. 1994; 77: 713-725Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (678) Google Scholar). Peptide hormones, growth factors, neuronal activity, UV irradiation, and cross-linking of surface IgG activate CREB (38Tan Y. Rouse J. Zhang A. Cariati C. Cohen P. Comb M.J.

This diversity of signal initiation, and the different signaling systems through which these cellular stressors act, indicates that serine 133 in CREB may be a substrate for a multiplicity of protein kinases. Mitogen-induced phosphorylation commences with stimulation of guanine nucleotide exchange factors, such as SOS, which activates Ras. Ras induces activation of the Raf serine-threonine kinase, an upstream activator of MAPK kinase. Downstream targets of the MAPK kinases are the MAPK ERK1 and ERK2, which in turn can play a role in activation of ribosomal S6 kinase pp90RSK, a CREB kinase (62De Cesare D. Jacquot S. Hanauer A. Sassone-Corsi P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 12202-12207Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). p38 MAPK and its downstream effectors MAPKAP-K2 and -3 are components of an alternative pathway leading to CREB activation (36Deak M.

Other kinases that activate CREB are MSK1, a relative of p90RSK, which is activated by ERKs, calcium calmodulin-dependent kinases, and protein kinase C (61Xie H. Rothstein T.L. J. Immunol. 1995; 154: 1717-1723PubMed Google Scholar,63Sun P. Enslen H. Myung P.S. Maurer R.A. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 2527-2539Crossref PubMed Scopus (649) Google Scholar, 64Sheng M.

Science. 1996; 273: 959-963Crossref PubMed Scopus (1086) Google Scholar). The present study has shown that VEGF increases phosphorylation of nuclear CREB on serine 133 and increases CREB DNA binding and transactivation. Thus, three independent lines of experimentation support the conclusion that VEGF activates CREB. The ability of VEGF and VEGF-D, but not PlGF, to induce CREB phosphorylation shows that it is by signaling through KDR that CREB activation is mediated. This conclusion is supported by the ability of SU5416 to block CREB activation by VEGF. Thus, only one of the two VEGF receptors plays a role in the induction of CREB activity. ERK1 and ERK2, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, protein kinase A, and calmodulin kinase II were excluded as mediators of VEGF-induced CREB phosphorylation based on the inability of PD98059, LY294002, H89, and K252A, respectively, to inhibit VEGF-induced CREB phosphorylation. Inhibition of p38 MAPK by SB202190 partly inhibited VEGF-induced activation of CREB, as did GF109203X, an inhibitor of PKC. Complete blockade of CREB activation was observed when p38 MAPK and PKC were inhibited. These results show that p38 MAPK and PKC mediate CREB phosphorylation downstream of KDR. CREB plays an important role in cell proliferation, differentiation, adaptive responses, and metabolism (31Shaywitz A.J. Greenberg M.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 821-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (1797) Google Scholar, 66Hanson R.W. Reshef L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 581-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (634) Google Scholar). In mice, CREB is required for the generation of a normal repertoire of T cell lineages during development, and the absence of CREB leads to dwarfism and cardiac myopathy in the adult (67Barton K. Muthusamy N. Chanyangam M. Fischer C. Clendenin C. Leiden J.M. Nature. 1996; 379: 81-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar, 68Fentzke R.C. Korcarz C.E. Lang R.M. Lin H. Leiden J.M. J. Clin.

Nature. 1991; 350: 622-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). CREB family members are important for learning and memory and contribute to the neuronal adaptation to drugs of abuse (70Silva A.J. Kogan J.H. Frankland P.W. Kida S. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1998; 21: 127-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (1220) Google Scholar, 71Blendy J.A. Maldonado R. J. Mol. Med. 1998; 76: 104-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Our observations now suggest that by mediating cellular responses to VEGF, CREB is likely to play an important role in endothelial cell function and blood vessel development."
https://openalex.org/W2063726851,"beta-Catenin is a mediator of the Wnt-signaling pathway. In many cancers, beta-catenin is stabilized and accumulates in the nucleus where it associates with lymphoid-enhancing factor 1/ T-cell transcription factors to activate genes involved in cell transformation. Previously, we showed that adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) protein can regulate beta-catenin localization by nuclear export. In this study, we used in vitro transport assays to test whether cellular beta-catenin can exit the nucleus independent of APC and the CRM1 export receptor. In digitonin-permeabilized SW480 (APC(mut/mut)) tumor cells, nuclear beta-catenin decreased >60% in export reactions in the absence of exogenous factors. Under similar conditions, nuclear c-ABL was only exported after the addition of cytosolic extract, and the export was blocked by the CRM1-specific inhibitor, leptomycin B. The nuclear export of beta-catenin was not blocked by leptomycin B treatment, revealing a CRM1- and APC-independent pathway. The export of beta-catenin was sensitive to lower temperatures and the removal of ATP, indicating an active process. Ectopically expressed yellow fluorescent protein-beta-catenin also displayed CRM1-independent export. Conversely, the overexpression of the CRM1 transporter moderately stimulated export of nuclear beta-catenin, confirming that beta-catenin exits the nucleus by at least two distinct pathways. The shuttling ability of tumor cell beta-catenin has implications for its regulation and its role in transferring signals between the nucleus and plasma membrane."
https://openalex.org/W2064616648,"Cross-communication between different signaling systems allows the integration of the great diversity of stimuli that a cell receives under varying physiological situations. In this paper we have explored the possibility that tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor signal cross-talks with epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor signal on the nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) activation pathway. We have demonstrated that overexpression of the EGF receptor (EGFR) in NIH3T3 cells significantly enhances TNF-induced NF-κB-dependent luciferase activity even without EGF, that EGF treatment has a synergistic effect on the induction of the reporter activity, and that this enhancement is suppressed by AG1478, EGFR-specific tyrosine kinase inhibitor. We also have shown that TNF induces tyrosine phosphorylation and internalization of the overexpressed EGFR in NIH3T3 cells and the endogenously expressed EGFR in A431 cells and that the transactivation by TNF is suppressed by N-acetyl-l-cysteine or overexpression of an endogenous reducing molecule, thioredoxin, but not by phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitors and protein kinase C inhibitor. Taken together, this evidence strongly suggests that EGFR transactivation by TNF, which is regulated in a redox-dependent manner, is playing a pivotal role in TNF-induced NF-κB activation.

Hence each receptor recognizes one or a few structurally related ligands, and each ligand stereochemically “fits” one or perhaps two structurally related receptors. The specificity of biological responses generated to extracellular signals depends on adherence to this rule. For some time, however, it has been clear that structurally unrelated receptors may communicate with each other in what is termed receptor transactivation or cross-talk. Although receptor cross-talk is no doubt real, its biological importance remains unclear. Understanding the mechanism(s) by which inter-receptor communication occurs may offer the experimental means to explore the underlying biology. The initial steps in the major pathway utilized by tumor necrosis factor (TNF)1 to activate the NF-κB are fairly well understood (1Vandenabeele P. Declercg W. Beyaert R. Fiers W. Trends Cell Biol. 1995; 5: 392-399Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (742) Google Scholar, 2Karin M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27339-27342Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (621) Google Scholar). The NF-κB activation is usually initiated by the interaction of TNF with TNFR1 (p55), one of two distinct surface receptors, the other is TNFR2 (p75). Ligand-induced clustering of TNFR1 leads to the recruitment of TRADD to the intracellular portion of the receptor (3Liu Z.-G. Hsu H. Goeddel D.V. Karin M. Cell. 1996; 87: 565-576Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1784) Google Scholar). Receptor-bound TRADD recruits both the protein kinase designated receptor-interacting protein (RIP) and the ring/zinc finger protein TNF receptor-associated factor 2 (TRAF2). These two adapter proteins lead to the activation of the NF-κB as well as the activation of the stress-activated protein kinases such as c-Jun N-terminal kinase and p38 MAPK (3Liu Z.-G. Hsu H. Goeddel D.V. Karin M. Cell. 1996; 87: 565-576Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1784) Google Scholar). IL-1 also activates NF-κB and stress-activated protein kinases using a similar pathway initiated by ligand binding to the type 1 IL-1 receptor and involving adapter proteins MyD88, IL-1 receptor-associated kinase, and TRAF6 (4Cao Z. Xiong J. Takeuchi M. Kurama T. Goeddel D.V. Nature. 1996; 383: 443-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (1123) Google Scholar). The precise connection between RIP-TRAF2 or IL-1 receptor-associated kinase-TRAF6 complexes and NF-κB are less well established but are thought to involve the MAPK kinase kinase family members MEKK-1 or NF-κB-inducing kinase (NIK) (5Malinin N.L. Boldin M.P. Kovalenko A.V. Wallach D. Nature. 1997; 385: 540-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (1166) Google Scholar). Both of these protein kinases can directly phosphorylate and activate IκB kinase (IKK) which is a multiprotein enzyme complex consisting of IKK-1, IKK-2, and NEMO (also known as IKKγ) subunits (2Karin M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27339-27342Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (621) Google Scholar, 6Zandi E. Rothwart D.M. Delhase M. Hayakawa M. Karin M.

Science. 1997; 278: 866-869Crossref PubMed Scopus (1068) Google Scholar). IKK-α and IKK-β phosphorylate members of the IκB family that share a common mechanism for regulation of NF-κB. In resting cells, IκB proteins bind to and mask the nuclear localization sequence of NF-κB resulting in the retention of the transcription factor in the cytosol. Phosphorylation of IκB by IKKs targets this protein for rapid ubiquitination and degradation by the proteasome (2Karin M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27339-27342Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (621) Google Scholar,10Lee F.S. Peters R.T. Dang L.C. Maniatis T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9319-9324Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). This process releases NF-κB which then translocates to the nucleus and induces transcription. MEKK-1, but not NIK, catalyzes the phosphorylation and activation of yet other MAPK kinases and is probably responsible for the parallel activation of stress-activated protein kinases (11Minden A. Lin A. Claret F.-X. Abo A. Karin M. Cell. 1995; 81: 1147-1157Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1447) Google Scholar, 12Ichijo H. Nishida E. Irie K. ten Dijke P. Saitoh M. Moriguchi T. Takagi M.

Recently, an alternative signaling pathway has been described in some cells in which Akt directly phosphorylates IKKs leading to the activation of NF-κB, independent of MEKK-1 and NIK (14Ozes O.N. Mayo L.D. Gustin J.A. Pfeffer S.R. Pfeffer L.M. Donner D.B. Nature. 1999; 401: 82-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (1904) Google Scholar). This pathway thus allows growth factors such as platelet-derived protein kinase to activate NF-κB (15Romashkova J.A. Makarov S.S. Nature. 1999; 401: 86-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (1670) Google Scholar). Moreover, TNF and IL-1 have been found to activate the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt pathway, potentially providing an alternative pathway for TNF and IL-1 to activate NF-κB that is independent of NIK or MEKK-1. The importance of this alternative NF-κB pathway compared with the previously described TRADD/RIP/TRAF2 or MyD88/IL-1 receptor-associated kinase/TRAF6 cytokine signaling pathways is unknown and may vary with the cell type. TNF and IL-1 also activate MAPK, but this pathway is even less well defined. The epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor is ubiquitously expressed in various tissues and is thus positioned to influence a wide range of responses, depending on the coordinate expression of the cognate ligand (16Carpenter G. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1987; 1987: 881-914Crossref Scopus (1055) Google Scholar, 17Carpenter G. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 697-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). A number of reports have demonstrated that various extracellular stimuli, unrelated to EGF-like ligands, can also activate the EGF receptor (18Zwick E. Hackel P.O. Prenzel N. Ullrich A. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1999; 20: 408-412Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). These diverse stimuli include numerous agonists such as carbachol, bombesin, thrombin, and lysophosphatidic acid for heptahelical G protein-coupled receptors, cytokine receptors such as prolactin, growth hormone adhesion receptors such as integrins, membrane-depolarizing agents such as KCl, and environmental stress factors such as ultraviolet irradiation, γ-irradiation, oxidants, heat shock, and hyperosmotic shock (19Daub H. Wallasch C. Lankenau A. Herrlich A. Ullrich A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7032-7044Crossref PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar, 20Daub H. Weiss F.U. Wallasch C. Ullrich A.

Activation of EGF receptors by such seemingly unrelated and indirect means is potentially biologically significant (18Zwick E. Hackel P.O. Prenzel N. Ullrich A. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1999; 20: 408-412Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar, 19Daub H. Wallasch C. Lankenau A. Herrlich A. Ullrich A.

Together, this evidence prompted us to investigate a possibility of cross-talk between TNFα-induced signals and EGFR-mediated signals on the NF-κB activation. In this paper, we have demonstrated that TNFα transactivates EGFR in a redox-sensitive manner, and this activation enhances the NF-κB activation. A murine embryonic fibroblast cell line NIH3T3 was obtained from Dr. H. Sabe (Osaka Bioscience Institute, Osaka, Japan). A human embryo kidney cell-derived cell line HEK293 and human carcinoma A431 cells were from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). Cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics (50 units/ml penicillin and 100 µg/ml streptomycin) at 37 °C under a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2. Recombinant human TNFα and recombinant human EGF were purchased fromRoche Molecular Biochemicals. Monoclonal antibodies raised against EGF receptor (E12020) and activated EGF receptor (E12120) were from BD Transduction Laboratory. Tyrphostin AG1478, wortmannin, LY294002, PD98059, and GF109203X were from Calbiochem.N-Acetyl-l-cysteine (NAC) was from Sigma. An expression vector of GFP-fused human EGF receptor (EGFR), in which the GFP moiety is fused to the C terminus of EGFR, pEGFR-EGFP, was kindly provided by Dr. Alexander Sorkins (University of Colorado Health Science Center). Point mutation of EGFR, K721A, was performed by a PCR-based technique (22Hirota K. Matsui M. Iwata S. Nishiyama A. Mori K. Yodoi J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Expression plasmids of TRAF2 and IKKα were kindly provided by Drs. Reiko Shinkura and Kazuhiro Kitada, Kyoto University (23Shinkura R. Kitada K. Matsuda F. Tashiro K. Ikuta K. Suzuki M. Kogishi K.

Cells were plated in 24-well plates at a density of 5 × 104 cells per well. The Fugene 6 reagent (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) was used for transfection. In each transfection, 250 ng of pNF-κB-Luc and 100 ng of pSV40-β-galactosidase as an internal control were pre-mixed and used. In the case of NIH3T3 cells, 250 ng of pEGFR-EGFP or pEGFP-N3 plasmids were used additionally. 12 h after transfection, cells were serum-starved (0.1%) or not. After a further 12 h of incubation, cells were treated with TNFα and/or EGF with or without kinase inhibitors. After 6 h, the cells were harvested, and the luciferase activity was determined using an assay system (Promega) with a luminometer, Lumat LB9507 (Berthold) (24Hirota K. Murata M. Sachi Y. Nakamura H.

The relative fold induction of luciferase activity was calculated after normalization dividing the luciferase activity by β-galactosidase activity. Each experiment was done at least two times in triplicate, and the data shown are representative of them. After treatments, cells were lysed with a buffer (5 mm Hepes, 250 mm NaCl, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 100 µmVa3VO4 supplemented by Complete protease inhibitor mixture, Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Whole cell lysates (50 µg) were separated on 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Western blotting analysis was performed following the protocol described previously (24Hirota K. Murata M. Sachi Y.

Briefly, after electroblotting, the polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore, Bedford, MA) were treated with 5% (w/v) skim milk in TBS-T (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 137 mm NaCl, 0.5% Tween 20) and incubated with antigen-specific antibodies against EGF receptor (1:2500) or activated form EGF receptor (1:1000), followed by incubation with peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (1:2000) (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The epitope was visualized with an ECL Western blot detection kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). NIH3T3 cells were plated onto chamber slides (LabTech) and transfected by pEGFP-N3 or pEGFR-EGFP. After 12 h, cells were serum-starved (0.1% serum) for 12 h and then stimulated for 15 min in the absence or presence of TNF or EGF. Cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and mounted in 90% glycerol with 1 mg/ml p-phenylenediamine and examined with a confocal microscope, MRC-1024 (Bio-Rad) (24Hirota K. Murata M. Sachi Y. Nakamura H. Takeuchi J. Mori K. Yodoi J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27891-27897Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar). Statistical significance between two groups was tested using the unpaired Student's t test. Differences were considered statistically significant at a value ofp < 0.05. Because NIH3T3 cells express EGFR only in low density, we can examined the effects of EGFR on the TNFα-induced NF-κB activation by overexpression of EGFR. In Fig. 1 A, pEGFR-EGFP enhanced the NF-κB-dependent luciferase activity compared with pEGFP-N3 (lane 2). The concentration of serum did not cause any significant differences (lanes 2 and 5). EGF has been shown to activate NF-κB in rat aortic smooth muscle cells (28Obata H. Biro S. Arima N. Kaieda H. Kihara T. Eto H. Miyata M. Tanaka H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 224: 27-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) and A431 carcinoma cells (29Sun L. Carpenter G.

Cell Res. 1994; 214: 654-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Therefore, we examined the effect of EGF on the NF-κB activation in NIH3T3 cell. Treatment with EGF by itself did not have any significant effects (lane 3) but made significant synergistic effect with TNF treatment (lane 4). This enhancing effect of EGFR was in a dose-dependent manner for the pEGFR-EGFP plasmid (Fig. 1 B). The EGFR is a transmembrane protein, and the ligation of EGF to the receptor results in an increase in the tyrosine kinase activity of the cytoplasmic domain and the autophosphorylation of tyrosine residues (31Van der Geer P. Hunter T. Lindberg R.A. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1994; 10: 251-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (1252) Google Scholar). Various protein kinases such as PKC, MAPK, and EGFR itself are considered to be involved in the tyrosine phosphorylation of EGFR indirectly or directly (16Carpenter G. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1987; 1987: 881-914Crossref Scopus (1055) Google Scholar). In order to explore the molecular mechanisms, we used a series of kinase inhibitors (Fig. 2 A). The effect of expression of pEGFR-EGFP was suppressed dose-dependently by treatment with tyrphostin AG1478 (right columns of lanes 2–4), which is a rather selective EGFR tyrosine kinases inhibitor. AG1478 treatment did not have significant effects on TNFα-induced NF-κB activation in pEGFP-N3-transfected NIH3T3 cells (left columns oflanes 2–4). In contrast, both PI3K inhibitors, LY294002 and wortmannin, and a PKC inhibitor, GF109203X, suppressed the NF-κB activation in both pEGFP-N3- and pEGFR-EGFP-transfected NIH3T3 cells (lanes 5–8, 11, and 12). Because a line of reports have demonstrated that reactive oxygen intermediates (ROIs) play a pivotal role in the TNF-induced NF-κB activation, we tried a potent antioxidant NAC in this assay. Interestingly, NAC almost completely abolished EGFR-mediated enhancement of the NF-κB activation induced by TNF (lane 13). In contrast, the MEK-1 inhibitor, PD98059, did not have any significant effects on the NF-κB activation (lanes 9 and 10). Treatment with AG1478 or NAC caused similar suppressive effects of the NF-κB activation in HEK293 cells (Fig. 2 B) as well as in pEGFR-EGFP-transfected NIH3T3 cells. We then examined the effect of overexpression of kinase-dead EGFR (K721A) on the TNF-induced NF-κB-dependent gene expression in HEK293 cells. As shown in Fig. 2 C, expression of the EGFR(K721A)-EGFP chimera blocked the NF-κB-dependent gene expression in a plasmid dose-dependent manner. Together with the results using A1478, the tyrosine phosphorylation of EGFR plays very critical roles in TNF-induced NF-κB activation process. Next we examined whether EGFR could be activated by TNFα or not by using an antibody that specifically recognizes the “activated” EGFR from which tyrosine residues were phosphorylated (32Barbier A.J. Poppleton H.M. Yigzaw Y. Mullenix J.B. Wiepz G.J. Bertics P.J. Patel T.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14067-14073Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). We detected significant signals of activated EGFR (upper row) in pEGFR-EGFP-transfected NIH3T3 cells treated by EGF (Fig.3 A, lane 4) or TNF (lane 5). Neither 100 µm LY294002 (lane 7) nor 10 µm GF109203X (lane 8) affected TNF-induced EGFR activation. In contrast, NAC dose-dependently suppressed the EGFR phosphorylation by TNF (lanes 9 and10). EGFR endogenously expressed in A431 cells were also phosphorylated by TNF treatment (Fig. 3 B, lane 3), and this phosphorylation was suppressed by AG1478 (lane 4) or NAC treatment (lane 5) as well as exogenously expressed EGFR in NIH3T3 cells. Moreover, expression of an endogenous protein with antioxidant property, TRX blocked phosphorylation of EGFR expressed in NIH3T3 cells (Fig. 3 C). If the observed tyrosine phosphorylation reflects EGFR activation, it should lead to multimerization and internalization of EGFR (17Carpenter G. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 697-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). To examine whether stimulation of TNFR leads to internalization of transactivated EGFR, we examined the intracellular localization of overexpressed EGFR-EGFP in NIH3T3 cells with confocal immunofluorescence microscopy. Fig. 4shows that in unstimulated cells transfected with pEGFR-EGFP, EGFR localizes primarily to the cell surface (Fig. 4 B). TNFα (500 ng/ml) treatment of these cells, however, leads to an increase in EGFR localized inside the cells (Fig. 4 C). EGF (500 ng/ml) treatment also leads to the internalization (Fig. 4 D). GFP was homogeneously expressed in cells and did not have any particular localization pattern (Fig. 4 A). To explore the AG1478-sensitive step in the NF-κB activation, we overexpressed signaling intermediate molecules, TRAF2 and IKKα, in HEK293 cells (Fig. 5). Overexpression of TRAF2 induced significantly NF-κB-dependent gene expression, and this was suppressed by treatment with AG1478 (250 nm) (Fig. 5 A). In contrast, AG1478 (250 nm) did not have any significant effect on the IKKα-induced NF-κB activation (Fig.5 B). We next examined the effect of TRAF2 on the EGFR phosphorylation. HEK293 cells were transfected by TRAF2 expression vector with or without NAC treatment. As shown in Fig.6, EGFR phosphorylation was significantly enhanced by TRAF2 overexpression (lane 3), and the enhancement was abolished by NAC treatment (lane 4). H2O2 by itself enhanced EGFR phosphorylation (lane 2). In this paper, we have described the EGFR transactivation by TNF and its involvement in TNF-induced NF-κB activation. We have demonstrated that the transactivation is redox-sensitive but dependent on activity of neither P13K nor PKC. In contrast, the NF-κB activation process is redox-sensitive and dependent on the activity of PI3K and PKC but not MAPK. The EGFR is a transmembrane glycoprotein, and the ligation of EGF to the receptor results in the dimer formation, an increase in the tyrosine kinase activity of the cytoplasmic domain, and the autophosphorylation of several tyrosine residues (33Carpenter G. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 7709-7712Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 34Carpenter G. BioEssays. 2000; 22: 697-707Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). Intracellular tyrosine kinases such as Src and focal adhesion kinase and EGFR itself are considered to be involved in the tyrosine phosphorylation (18Zwick E. Hackel P.O. Prenzel N. Ullrich A. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1999; 20: 408-412Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). Under certain circumstances, intracellular tyrosine kinase activity is dependent on other kinases such as PKC, PI3K, and MAPK. Our results of EGFR transactivation assay using anti-activated EGFR antibody demonstrate that treatment with a PI3K inhibitor, LY294002, and a PKC inhibitor, GF109203X, do not influence the EGFR transactivation by TNF (Fig. 3 A). Because the MEK inhibitor, PD98059, does not have any effect on TNF-induced NF-κB activity in NIH3T3 cells, MAPK may not be involved in this transactivation. Interestingly and very importantly, NAC, a very potent antioxidant, treatment almost completely abolished TNF-induced EGFR transactivation and suppressed NF-κB activation (Fig. 3 A,lanes 9 and 10). On the other hand, treatment with pharmacological inhibitors of PI3K and PKC significantly suppress TNF-induced EGFR-dependent NF-κB activation (Fig.2 A, lanes 5–8, 11, and 12). Taken together, it is highly suggested that steps sensitive to PI3K inhibitor and PKC inhibitor are located downstream of the EGFR in the TNF-induced NF-κB activation pathway. ROI plays an essential role in the TNF-induced signaling pathways to NF-κB and stress-activated protein kinases (35Li N. Karin M. FABEB J. 1999; 13: 1137-1143Crossref PubMed Scopus (787) Google Scholar). Intracellularly generated ROI has been shown to act as a second messenger of the signaling (36Finkel T. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 248-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (1013) Google Scholar, 37Finkel T. FEBS Lett. 2000; 476: 52-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar). It has been also shown that EGFR activation is modulated by redox principle (38Lee S.-R. Kwon K.-S. Kim S.-R. Rhee S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 273: 15366-15372Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (844) Google Scholar, 39Kamata H. Shibukawa Y. Oka S.-I. Hirata H. Eur. J.

Chem. 2000; 275: 14624-14631Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar). In fact, ROIs enhance the EGFR phosphorylation by a ligand-independent mechanism (38Lee S.-R. Kwon K.-S. Kim S.-R. Rhee S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 273: 15366-15372Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (844) Google Scholar, 40Wang X. McCullough K.D. Franke T.F. Holbrook N.J. J. Biol.

Although it is unclear how ROI is involved in this process, one plausible mechanism is the reversible inactivation of protein-tyrosine phosphatases (38Lee S.-R. Kwon K.-S. Kim S.-R. Rhee S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 273: 15366-15372Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (844) Google Scholar). Because all protein-tyrosine phosphatases have catalytic sites containing reactive cysteine residues, which form a thiol-phosphatase intermediate during catalysis, oxidation of these residues leads to their inactivation. Thiol-mediated redox systems such as glutathione and TRX systems have been demonstrated to be involved in these processes (22Hirota K. Matsui M. Iwata S. Nishiyama A. Mori K. Yodoi J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3633-3638Crossref PubMed Scopus (728) Google Scholar, 24Hirota K. Murata M. Sachi Y. Nakamura H. Takeuchi J. Mori K. Yodoi J. J. Biol.

Overexpression of TRX suppressed the TNF-induced EGFR phosphorylation (Fig. 3 C) as did the treatment with NAC. We have shown that redox-sensitive steps in the TNF-induced NF-κB signaling pathway are down from TRAF2 and up to IKK in HEK293 cells (27Takeuchi J. Hirota K. Itoh T. Shinkura R. Kitada K. Yodoi J. Namba T. Fukuda K. Antioxid. Redox Signal. 2000; 2: 83-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). In addition, in this study, we have shown that TRAF2 overexpression induces EGFR phosphorylation in a redox-dependent manner and TRAF2-induced NF-κB activation is AG1478-dependent (Figs. 5 and 6). Consistent with this observation, Liu et al. (44Liu H. Nishitoh H. Ichijo H. Kyriakis J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2198-2208Crossref PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar) recently showed that not only TNF but also just overexpression of TRAF2 fosters the production of ROI in transfected cells and that overexpression of TRX or treatment with antioxidants suppressed part of the downstream signaling cascades. Rac1 is an essential subunit of the NADPH oxidase system even in non-phagocytotic cells, and overexpression of the constitutively active mutant of Rac1 confers generation of ROI in certain cells, and overexpression of dominant negative mutant suppresses ROI generation by growth factor such as EGF and platelet-derived protein kinase as well as by TNF (45Sundaresan M., Yu, Z.-X.

Chem. 1998; 273: 6297-6302Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (621) Google Scholar). Together with our results (Figs. 4 and 5), the ROI of downstream TNFR and TRAF2 may play a role in the EGFR transactivation process. In this study we have clearly demonstrated that treatment with AG1478 significantly suppresses TRAF2-induced NF-κB-dependent gene expression but not IKKα-induced gene expression (Fig. 5). Moreover, TRAF2 induces EGFR phosphorylation in a redox-dependent manner (Fig. 6). In addition to signaling by protein-to-protein interaction, the diffusible second messenger, ROI, mainly H2O2 downstream of the TNFR-TRAF2 complex may certainly contribute to this signaling pathway. Considering the ubiquitous expression of EGFR in various types of cells, particularly in cancer cells, transactivation of EGFR by TNF may play very important roles in the activation of NF-κB in physiological and pathophysiological scenarios. Further studies on the molecular mechanism of this phenomenon may lead to a better understanding of the TNF signaling pathway. In particular, it may be very interesting to determine whether TNF-induced transactivation of EGFR involves proteolytic cleavage of membrane-bound EGFR ligands such as HB-EGF in the case of G protein-coupled receptor ligands including carbachol, bombesin, and thrombin (50Prenzel N. Zwick E. Daub H. Leserer M. Abraham R. Wallasch C. Ullrich A. Nature. 1999; 402: 884-888Crossref PubMed Scopus (1501) Google Scholar). Moreover, it also seems interesting and significant to determine whether the transactivation potentiates other signaling pathways downstream of TNFR such as MAPKs activation. We thank Drs.

https://openalex.org/W2073521360,"The close correspondence between the distribution of brain α-synuclein and that of muscarinic M1 and M3 receptors suggests a role for this protein in cholinergic transmission. We thus examined the effect of muscarinic stimulation on α-synuclein in SH-SY5Y, a human dopaminergic cell line that expresses this protein. Under basal conditions, α-synuclein was detected in all subcellular compartments isolated as follows: plasma membrane, cytoplasm, nucleus, and two vesicle fractions. The lipid fractions contained only a 45-kDa α-synuclein oligomer, whereas the cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions contained both the oligomer and the monomer. This finding suggests α-synuclein exists physiologically as a lipid-bound oligomer and a soluble monomer. Muscarinic stimulation by carbachol reduced the α-synuclein oligomer in plasma membrane over a 30-min period, with a concomitant increase of both the oligomer and the monomer in the cytoplasmic fraction. The oligomer was associated with a light vesicle fraction in cytoplasm that contains uncoated endocytotic vesicles. The carbachol-induced alteration of α-synuclein was blocked by atropine. Translocation of the α-synuclein oligomer in response to carbachol stimulation corresponds closely with the time course of ligand-stimulated muscarinic receptor endocytosis. The data suggest that the muscarine receptor stimulated release of the α-synuclein oligomer from plasma membrane, and its subsequent association with the endocytotic vesicle fraction may have a role in muscarine receptor endocytosis. We propose that its function may be a transient release of membrane-bound phospholipase D2 from α-synuclein inhibition, thus allowing this lipase to participate in muscarinic receptor endocytosis.

Scheller R.H. Brain Res. Mol. Brain Res. 1991; 11: 335-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). The proximity of α-synuclein to brain muscarinic receptors and related enzymes suggests that this protein could contribute to cholinergic function. To evaluate this possibility, we investigated the effect of muscarinic receptor stimulation by the cholinergic agonist carbachol on the subcellular distribution of endogenous α-synuclein in the human neuroblastoma cell line SH-SY5Y. This dopaminergic cell line shares many properties with dopamine neurons of substantia nigra pars compacta, the major locus of neurodegeneration in Parkinson's disease, including the expression of M1 and M3 receptors (5Biedler J.L. Roffler-Tarlov S. Schachner M. Freedman L.S. Cancer Res. 1978; 38: 3751-3757PubMed Google Scholar). We now report that carbachol induces a translocation of a 45-kDa α-synuclein oligomer from plasma membrane to a light vesicle fraction in cytoplasm, with a time course and subcellular localization matching that of muscarinic receptors during carbachol-stimulated endocytosis. Previously, synucleins have been demonstrated to be endogenous inhibitors of phospholipase D2(PLD2)1 (6Jenco J.M. Rawlingson A. Daniels B. Morris A.J. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 4901-4909Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar). Furthermore, activation of PLD isoforms, including PLD2, stimulates endocytosis (7Marshansky V. Bourgoin S. Londono I.

Thus, the present data are consistent with a model of muscarinic receptor endocytosis in which the release of α-synuclein from plasma membrane transiently disinhibits membrane-bound PLD2, freeing this lipase to function in ligand-stimulated muscarinic receptor endocytosis. Anti-synuclein-1 (Syn-1) monoclonal antibody, annexin II monoclonal antibody, and goat anti-mouse IgG polyclonal horseradish peroxidase conjugate were from BD Transduction Laboratories; ECL detection reagents were from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech; 10× SDS/Tris glycine electrophoresis running buffer and non-fat dry milk were from Bio-Rad; 4–20% Tris glycine gels, Xcell II Mini-Cell electrophoresis system and Blot Module, PVDF membrane/filter paper, MultiMark Multicolored and See-Blue standards were from NOVEX; 10× Tris glycine Transfer Buffer was from Quality Biological Inc.; phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium were from Cellgro-Mediatech; fetal bovine serum was from Life Technologies, Inc.; and protease inhibitor mixture was from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. The following buffers were used: cell wash buffer (0.25 m sucrose, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.5); sucrose homogenization buffer (0.25 m sucrose, 10 mmHEPES, 1 mm MgCl2, protease inhibitor mixture, pH 7.5); high density sucrose buffer (2.4 m sucrose, 10 mm HEPES, 1 mm MgCl2, protease inhibitor mixture, pH 7.5); freezing buffer (6 mm Tris-HCl, 4 mm EGTA, 1 mm MgCl2, 10% glycerol, pH 7.4); and 2× SDS sample buffer (126 mmTris-HCl, 4% SDS, 20% glycerol, 0.0025% bromphenol blue, pH 6.8). Human dopaminergic neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells (ATCC) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum and kept at 37 °C in humidified 5% CO2, 95% air. Cells grown on 100-mm plates to 80–90% confluence were rinsed with 1 ml of ice-cold wash buffer. Cells were fractionated according to a modification of the procedures of Fleischer and Kervina (10Fleischer S. Kervina M. Methods Enzymol. 1974; 31: 3-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) as follows. Cells from each plate were scraped with 0.5 ml of ice-cold sucrose homogenization buffer into a 5-ml glass homogenization vessel and lysed by 10 strokes of a glass pestle with a Dounce ball tip. Homogenates from each plate were centrifuged at 1450 ×g for 10 min (3500 rpm, Beckman J-21, JA-20 rotor). The post-nuclear supernatants were transferred to other tubes and kept ice-cold for later separation of vesicles and cytoplasm. Nuclei and plasma membranes were isolated from the resulting pellets. The pellet from the initial centrifugation was resuspended in 1 ml of ice-cold sucrose homogenization buffer. A volume of 1.62 ml of ice-cold high density sucrose buffer was added to the solution containing the resuspended pellet, producing a final concentration of 1.6m sucrose. A two-layer step gradient was set up by layering a sufficient volume of 0.25 m sucrose buffer over the 1.6m sucrose suspension to fill the tube and then centrifuged at 70,900 × g R av (24,000 rpm, SW 25.2 rotor) for 70 min. The band at the gradient interface (0.25 and 1.6 m sucrose) was enriched in plasma membrane. The plasma membrane-containing band was carefully transferred to other tubes after removal by aspiration of the top layer of 0.25 m sucrose buffer. The pellet produced after the gradient centrifugation contained the nuclear fraction. Two vesicle and cytoplasmic fractions were isolated by different centrifugation procedures used with matched samples of post-nuclear supernatant. A vesicle fraction termed V1 was isolated by ultracentrifugation of the post-nuclear supernatant at 100,000 ×g for 1 h. The pellet of this centrifugation contains vesicles in the density range of synaptic vesicles (11Jensen P.H. Nielsen M.S. Jakes R. Dotti C.G. Goedert M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26292-26294Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar). The resulting pellet was resuspended in freezing buffer, which stabilizes the sample for freezing at −80 °C or could be analyzed immediately. The supernatant of this centrifugation is the cytoplasmic fraction we termed S1. Matched culture plates were used to sediment a larger vesicle fraction, the V2, by ultracentrifugation of the post-nuclear supernatant at 200,000 × g for 90 min (12Slowiejko D.M. McEwen E.L. Ernst S.A. Fisher S.K. J. Neurochem. 1996; 66: 186-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The supernatant from this centrifugation is the cytoplasmic fraction we termed S2. Protein concentration was determined by the BCA Protein Assay kit using bovine serum albumin as a standard. Concentrations of total protein were determined from the absorption spectrum measured atA 562. Aliquots containing equal amounts of protein from each sample (20 µg each for cytoplasmic, nuclear, and vesicle fractions; 7 µg each for the plasma membrane fractions) were dissolved in an equal volume aliquot of 2× SDS sample buffer, loaded onto 4–20% linear gradient polyacrylamide mini gels, and then subjected to electrophoresis (applied constant voltage, 125 V). After protein separation, each gel was placed on a PVDF membrane in transfer buffer, and the proteins were transferred to the membrane by the application of 25 V for 2 h. After the transfer was completed, the PVDF membrane was soaked in blocking buffer for 1 h, incubated for 1 h with the primary antibody (1:500 dilution in 0.1% Tween 20/PBS), washed three times for 20 min each time in 0.1% Tween 20/PBS, incubated for 1 h in secondary antibody (1:2000 dilution in 0.1% Tween 20/PBS), and then washed again three times as before. The reactive bands were visualized by chemiluminescence. Aliquots of 500 mmcarbachol solution were added to cell cultures to a final concentration of 1 mm. Carbachol-stimulated cells were incubated for intervals of up to 30 min and compared with non-treated control cells. The specificity of the carbachol stimulation effect was assessed by preincubation of cells with 200 µm atropine 1 h prior to the addition of carbachol. All experiments were conducted in triplicate, and samples for each condition were run in duplicate. Annexin II is a membrane protein localized exclusively in plasma membrane and early endosomes (13van der Goot F.G. Electrophoresis. 1997; 18: 2689-2693Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Annexin II was assessed in subcellular fractions under both basal and carbachol-stimulated conditions. In order to estimate the relative purity of the subcellular fractions, fraction samples from unstimulated cells containing 5 µg of protein each were eluted by gel electrophoresis, detected by Western blot using the monoclonal antibody against annexin II, and visualized by chemiluminescence. Annexin II antigenicity was used also to examine the effect of carbachol stimulation on the early endosomes in the cytoplasmic (S1) fraction from samples containing 20 µg of protein each from unstimulated and carbachol-stimulated cells. The α-synuclein monoclonal antibody consistently detected two molecular species of this protein in the SH-SY5Y whole cell lysate. The α-synuclein monomer migrated in gel electrophoresis at its expected position corresponding to an apparent molecular mass of ∼19 kDa (14Ueda K. Fukushima H. Masliah E. Xia Y. Iwai A. Yoshimoto M. Otero D.A. Kondo J. Ihara Y. Saitoh T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 11282-11286Crossref PubMed Scopus (1227) Google Scholar) and a second α-synuclein signal was detected at ∼45 kDa. The 45-kDa band appears to be an oligomer containing at least one α-synuclein molecule, as it can be non-enzymatically cleaved under stringent reducing conditions, resulting in a quantitative increase in the monomer (15Bennett, M. C., Leng, Y., and Chase, T. N. (1999)Neuroscience 25, (abstr.) 48–48.Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). The vigorous reducing conditions required for cleavage of this oligomer suggest that the bond between molecules may be an azo bond (16Baumert H.G. Fasold F. Methods Enzymol. 1989; 172: 584-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). This linkage may be similar to the dityrosine bonds recently characterized as being formed after tyrosine nitration (17Souza J. Giasson B.I. Lee V.M. Ischiropoulos H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18344-18349Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar). The distribution of the two forms of α-synuclein in the various cellular compartments was determined by subcellular fractionation of whole cell lysate both under basal conditions and in response to carbachol stimulation for incubation intervals of up to 30 min. The post-nuclear supernatant was used to isolate two vesicle fractions V1 and V2 from matched sets of samples as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The α-synuclein in the vesicle fraction we termed V1 was shown in previous work to be associated exclusively with vesicles of densities 1.0995–1.259 g/ml and to distribute identically with synaptic vesicle-associated protein, SNAP-25 (11Jensen P.H. Nielsen M.S. Jakes R. Dotti C.G. Goedert M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26292-26294Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar), thus providing strong evidence that all of the α-synuclein in this fraction is bound to synaptic-like vesicles. The V2 fraction contains, in addition to the vesicles of the V1 fraction, a lighter vesicle fraction that includes endocytotic vesicles that have lost their clathrin coating (12Slowiejko D.M. McEwen E.L. Ernst S.A. Fisher S.K. J. Neurochem. 1996; 66: 186-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The supernatants from each centrifugation condition were the cytoplasmic fractions termed S1 and S2, respectively. The efficacy of the separation of the cellular fractions was demonstrated by the relative concentrations of annexin II, a marker of plasma membrane and early endosomes (13van der Goot F.G. Electrophoresis. 1997; 18: 2689-2693Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Annexin II was highly concentrated in plasma membrane compared with whole cell lysate and was weakly present in the cytosolic S1 fraction from unstimulated cells (Fig. 2). With a 4-fold increase in sample protein, however, the annexin II signal was clearly detected in the S1 fraction of unstimulated cells and increased with carbachol stimulation (Fig.3). This increase suggests that the annexin II antibody detected the increase in early endosomes containing muscarinic receptors, which have been demonstrated to increase in response to carbachol stimulation (12Slowiejko D.M. McEwen E.L. Ernst S.A. Fisher S.K. J. Neurochem. 1996; 66: 186-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Annexin II was absent in the V1 fraction, consistent with its localization in lipids of early endosomes but not synaptic vesicles (Fig. 2). Thus, the detection of annexin II exclusively in the plasma membrane and the S1cytoplasmic fractions validates the methods of subcellular fractionation used in this experiment.Figure 3Carbachol stimulation increases annexin II in the cytosolic S1 fraction. Annexin II was readily detected in samples of the cytoplasm S1 fraction of unstimulated SY5Y cells containing 20 µg of protein, in contrast with those containing only 5 µg of protein (Fig. 2). The increase in the annexin II signal in response to carbachol stimulation is consistent with an increase in early endosomes containing muscarinic receptors.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) All membrane fractions, i.e. the plasma membrane fraction and vesicle fractions, contained only the 45-kDa form of α-synuclein (Fig. 4, a andb). In contrast, the cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions often contained both the monomer and the heavier species (Fig. 4,c and d). The lack of the α-synuclein monomer in all of the membrane fractions suggests that the membrane-associated α-synuclein is exclusively oligomeric in SY5Y cells. The 45-kDa species was evident in the S1 supernatant but weak or absent in the S2 supernatant, indicating that a subcellular component containing this molecule is not sedimented by the conditions yielding the V1 fraction but can be sedimented by the higher gravitational force centrifugation that yields the V2 pellet (Fig. 5). Thus, by comparing the results of the different centrifugation conditions, we conclude that the soluble α-synuclein monomer is found in the aqueous cytosol, and the 45-kDa oligomer is associated with two distinct vesicle populations differentiated by density.Figure 5Comparison of the supernatant fractions S1 and S2 under basal conditions.Typically the 45-kDa α-synuclein oligomer that is present in the S1 fraction (a) is weak or absent in the S2 fraction (b), indicating a low density particulate component that remains in the S1 fraction is sedimented from the S2 into the V2 by the longer centrifugation duration under higher gravitation forces.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) A previous investigation (18Davidson W.S. Jonas A. Clayton D.F. George J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9443-9449Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1249) Google Scholar) identified an oligomer of purified recombinant α-synuclein with an apparent molecular mass of ∼45 kDa, similar to the membrane-associated oligomer of the present study. The α-synuclein oligomer found in this study was formed only when α-synuclein was incubated with artificial vesicles containing phosphatidylinositol (PI). The α-synuclein monomer bound only to small unilaminar vesicles containing at least 20% acidic phospholipids, whereas the polymerization of vesicle-bound α-synuclein occurred only if the phospholipid was PI. These results suggest that the oligomeric α-synuclein detected in the SY5Y cellular environment is likely to be a homo-oligomer that binds solely to membranes enriched in phosphatidylinositols. The oligomer of purified α-synuclein detected in vitro was described as a homodimer (18Davidson W.S. Jonas A. Clayton D.F. George J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9443-9449Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1249) Google Scholar); however, it seems more plausible that both the recombinant oligomer and the molecule presently detected in SY5Y cell lysate are homotrimers of α-synuclein. The molecular mass of endogenous α-synuclein monomer as determined by mass spectrometry is 14,681 (19Jakes R. Spillantini M.G. Goedert M. FEBS Lett. 1994; 345: 27-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (904) Google Scholar), but it migrates in gel electrophoresis with an apparent mass of ∼19 kDa, due to the highly acidic terminal sequence of this natively unfolded molecule (20Weinreb P.H. Zhen W. Poon A.W. Conway K.A. Lansbury P.T.J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 13709-13715Crossref PubMed Scopus (1319) Google Scholar). Upon vesicle binding, α-synuclein adopts a stable α-helical structure (18Davidson W.S. Jonas A. Clayton D.F. George J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9443-9449Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1249) Google Scholar). This conformational change from an elongated molecule to one with considerable secondary structure can be predicted to be accompanied by a change to more conventional electrophoretic migration characteristics. A molecule of ∼45 kDa would be more accurately 3 times the molecular weight of the α-synuclein monomer, thus being more consistent with a homotrimer. Alternatively, the higher molecular weight species may be a heteromer of α-synuclein bound to an unidentified binding partner. Nuclear binding of α-synuclein has been controversial (21Maroteaux L. Campanelli J.T. Scheller R.H. J. Neurosci. 1988; 8: 2804-2815Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22Iwai A. Masliah E. Yoshimoto M. Ge N. Flanagan L. de Silva H.A. Kittel A. Saitoh T. Neuron. 1995; 14: 467-475Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1127) Google Scholar). We detected both the α-synuclein monomer and the 45-kDa species in the nuclear fraction (Fig. 4 d). In addition to subcellular fractionation, we also visualized the distribution of α-synuclein by immunocytochemistry (Fig. 6). By this method also, α-synuclein was detected in the nucleus and cytoplasm of the SY5Y cells. Typically, the Western blot nuclear signal from the 45-kDa species was much stronger than that of the monomer. In the original characterization of α-synuclein in vivo, Maratoeax et al. (21Maroteaux L. Campanelli J.T. Scheller R.H. J. Neurosci. 1988; 8: 2804-2815Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) reported α-synuclein antigenicity over discrete portions of the nuclear envelope of neurons of theTorpedo electric organ, with the antigen signal diminishing over a 10-µm gradient toward the interior of the nucleus. The present findings are consistent with the 45-kDa α-synuclein oligomer being associated with the nuclear membrane and the soluble monomer existing in the nucleoplasm. Carbachol stimulation induced a consistent decrease in the 45-kDa signal detected in the plasma membrane fraction (Fig.7a) and a concomitant increase in both the oligomer and the monomer in the cytoplasmic fraction S1 (Fig. 7 b). There was little or no alteration in the amount of α-synuclein in the vesicle V1 fraction in response to carbachol stimulation (Fig. 7 c), although there was abundant α-synuclein in this fraction, which includes the synaptic-like vesicles. In contrast to the V1 fraction, a clear and marked increase in the α-synuclein signal was detected in the V2 vesicle fraction (Fig.8). A comparison of results from the two centrifugation conditions suggests that carbachol stimulation triggers a translocation of the α-synuclein oligomer from the plasma membrane to a light vesicle fraction in cytoplasm that is sedimented in the V2 but not the V1 fraction. Typically, however, the changes in the α-synuclein oligomer associated with the light vesicle fraction were more evident when this lipid fraction remained in the S1 cytoplasm (Fig.9). The overall protein concentrations were measured and found to be unaltered by carbachol stimulation, thus the compartmental alterations represent translocation of protein rather than carbachol-induced synthesis or degradation.Figure 8Effect of carbachol stimulation on the cytoplasmic S2 and vesicle V2compartments. a, as shown in 7b also, both oligomers and monomers increase in the S1 fraction in response to carbachol stimulation. c, in contrast, the α-synuclein oligomer signal from the cytoplasmic S2fraction is almost undetectable in the control lane (C) and increases only slightly with carbachol stimulation (probably reflecting the presence of unsedimented light vesicles). The monomer, however, increases as it does in the S1 fraction. The α-synuclein oligomer in the V2 fraction (d), in contrast with that in the V1 fraction (b), shows a clear increase in response to carbachol stimulation. The V2 fraction includes the light vesicle fraction that remains in the cytoplasmic S1 fraction.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Figure 9Carbachol-induced translocation of α-synuclein from plasma membrane to a light vesicle fraction in cytoplasm. The translocation of the α-synuclein oligomer from plasma membrane (a) to the light vesicle fraction was typically more distinct when this fraction remained in the supernatant S1 (b), where its appearance emerged in contrast to a typically low basal signal, than when it was sedimented into the V2 fraction (compare with Fig. 8 d) and the carbachol-induced increase appeared against a higher basal signal of the α-synuclein oligomer. The vesicle fraction V1 (c) remains unaltered.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Muscarinic receptors in many cell types, including SY5Y cells, undergo desensitization induced by carbachol stimulation that is mediated by ligand-stimulated, clathrin-dependent endocytosis (12Slowiejko D.M.

Cell Biol. 1998; 108: 389-400Crossref Scopus (773) Google Scholar). Endocytotic vesicles containing muscarinic receptors translocate from the plasma membrane to the cytoplasm and rapidly lose their clathrin coats (23Heuser J.E. Anderson R.G.W. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 108: 389-400Crossref Scopus (773) Google Scholar, 24Heuser J.E. Steer C. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 1457-1466Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 25Tsuga H. Kameyama K. Haga T. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1998; 124: 863-868Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The uncoated endocytotic vesicles are contained in the light membrane fraction that is included in the V2pellet (12Slowiejko D.M. McEwen E.L. Ernst S.A. Fisher S.K. J. Neurochem. 1996; 66: 186-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). We determined also that the α-synuclein signal increase in the cytoplasmic S1 fraction was matched by an increase in the annexin II signal, a marker for early endosomes (13van der Goot F.G. Electrophoresis. 1997; 18: 2689-2693Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3). The carbachol-induced α-synuclein translocation from plasma membrane to the light vesicle compartment matches the time course and subcellular translocation of muscarinic receptors during ligand-stimulated muscarinic receptor endocytosis (12Slowiejko D.M. McEwen E.L. Ernst S.A. Fisher S.K. J. Neurochem. 1996; 66: 186-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The internalization of α-synuclein was blocked completely by atropine (Fig. 10), indicating the specificity of this response to muscarinic receptor stimulation. Collectively, these results provide strong evidence that α-synuclein participates in ligand-stimulated muscarinic receptor endocytosis. A role for α-synuclein in muscarinic receptor endocytosis is consistent with its co-localization with muscarinic receptors and related enzymes in brain and fits well with the first reported physiological function of synucleins as potent endogenous inhibitors of phospholipase D2 (PLD2) (6Jenco J.M. Rawlingson A. Daniels B. Morris A.J. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 4901-4909Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar). Muscarinic stimulation is well documented to activate PLD in various cell types, including SY5Y cells, although distinctions have not been characterized between the PLD1 and PLD2 isoforms (26Klein J. Chalifa V. Liscovitch M. Loffelholz K. J. Neurochem. 1995; 65: 1445-1455Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 27Klein J. Lindmar R. Loffelholz K. Prog. Brain Res. 1996; 109: 201-208Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). PLD2 is a constitutively active isoform of PLD that is localized primarily along the plasma membrane (9Colley W.C. Sung T.C. Roll R. Jenco J. Hammond S.M. Altshuller Y. Bar-Sagi D. Morris A.J. Frohman M.A. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 191-201Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (635) Google Scholar). The potent inhibition of PLD2 by synucleins in vitro (6Jenco J.M. Rawlingson A. Daniels B. Morris A.J. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 4901-4909Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar) suggests that its low basal activity in vivo may be a result of tonic inhibition by synucleins. Overexpression of PLD2in cell culture induces endocytosis coincident with a redistribution of PLD2 from plasma membrane to submembrane vesicles and simultaneously induces actin polymerization, which is characteristic of the endocytotic phase of synaptic transmission (9Colley W.C. Sung T.C. Roll R. Jenco J. Hammond S.M. Altshuller Y. Bar-Sagi D. Morris A.J. Frohman M.A. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 191-201Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (635) Google Scholar). Transient disinhibition of post-synaptic PLD2 after cholinergic stimulation would accomplish several requirements of clathrin-mediated receptor endocytosis. Phospholipase D has been implicated in several steps of endocytosis, including recruitment of coat assembly proteins (28Ohno H. Stewart J. Fournier M.C. Bosshart H. Rhee I. Miyatake S. Saito T. Gallusser A. Kirchhausen T. Bonifacino J.S. Science. 1995; 269: 1872-1875Crossref PubMed Scopus (826) Google Scholar, 29Zhang J.Z. Davletov B.A. Sudhof T.C. Anderson R.G. Cell. 2000; 78: 751-760Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (433) Google Scholar). The observation that the recruitment of adaptin protein-2 to plasma membrane prior to endocytosis does not require the GTPase ADP-ribosylation factor, unlike the PLD1-controlled recruitment of adaptin protein-1 to the Golgi network, led to the speculation that adaptin protein-2 attachment to plasma membrane may be under the control of a “constitutively active phospholipase D” (30Melman I. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1996; 12: 575-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (1338) Google Scholar), despite the fact that one had not been discovered at the time. Membrane-bound disinhibited PLD2 is also well positioned to hydrolyze plasma membrane phosphatidylcholine (PC) at the endocytotic vesicle point of attachment to plasma membrane, thus releasing the vesicle into cytosol after it is closed at its base by the GTPase dynamin (31Trowbridge I.S. Curr. Biol. 1993; 3: 773-775Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Dynamin does not pinch off the vesicle, and at present, the mechanism for vesicle detachment is not known. Membrane lysis by PLD2- mediated PC hydrolysis could provide an additional advantage of liberating free choline, approximately half of which is lost during cholinergic neurotransmission. Cholinergic stimulation of membrane PC hydrolysis by PLD has been proposed by several groups (27Klein J. Lindmar R. Loffelholz K. Prog. Brain Res. 1996; 109: 201-208Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 32Hattori H. Kanfer J.N. J. Neurochem. 2000; 45: 1578-1584Crossref Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 33Lee H.C. Fellenz-Maloney M.P. Liscovitch M. Blusztajn J.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10086-10090Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) as a source of free choline for acetylcholine synthesis. The proposed modulation of cholinergic receptor endocytosis by the transient release of PLD2 from α-synuclein inhibition suggests a compact and parsimonious sequence of linked events for processes occurring during cholinergic neurotransmission. The present data do not resolve the issue of whether the α-synuclein oligomer remains associated with membrane throughout the entire process of endocytotic vesicle formation or is released from plasma membrane before reattaching to the endocytotic vesicle. Several lines of evidence from our laboratory and others favor a model in which muscarinic stimulation induces the release of α-synuclein from plasma membrane, with a concomitant conversion of the oligomer to soluble monomers prior to a reattachment and oligomerization of α-synuclein at the endocytotic vesicle. We observed a carbachol-induced increase in the soluble monomer in the cytoplasmic fraction that is consistent with a muscarinic receptor-stimulated cleavage of lipid-bound α-synuclein oligomer and release of the soluble monomer into cytosol (Figs. Figure 7, Figure 8, Figure 9). The recent findings that G-protein receptor kinases phosphorylate synucleins and reduce their binding affinity for phospholipid (34Pronin A.N. Morris A.J. Surguchov A. Benovic J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26515-26522Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar) also support the hypothesis that α-synuclein is first released from plasma membrane before rebinding to the endocytotic vesicle membrane in response to muscarinic stimulation. Furthermore, Marateaux and Scheller (4Maroteaux L. Scheller R.H. Brain Res. Mol. Brain Res. 1991; 11: 335-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar) noted that a 45-kDa form of α-synuclein was converted to the 19-kDa form by stimulation of phospholipase C, the lipase coupled to muscarinic receptors. Taken together these data suggest that the carbachol-stimulated increase in the cytoplasmic monomer may represent a transition state for α-synuclein in its translocation from plasma membrane to uncoated endocytotic vesicles. Carbachol stimulation induced changes in α-synuclein in the nucleus, as well as in the cytoplasmic and membrane fractions. The most consistent change was a decrease in the α-synuclein monomer over the 30 min of stimulation (Fig.11a). It is unclear whether this decrease contributes to the increase in the cytoplasmic monomer. Although there were no consistent changes in the 45-kDa species, two experiments showed a biphasic effect of carbachol stimulation, with a transient decrease at 10 min and a return to a level greater than the basal value by 30 min (Fig. 11 b). This effect, which was particularly pronounced in Fig. 11 b, was accompanied by the appearance of a strong signal between 30 and 36 kDa at the 10-min time point. A signal at this molecular weight was detected frequently in the nuclear and cytoplasmic (e.g. Fig. 4, c andd) fractions, although the intensity of the signal was typically weak compared with the other two α-synuclein signals. The apparent molecular weight of this novel species corresponds roughly to an α-synuclein dimer and gives support to the hypothesis that α-synuclein can be interconverted between polymeric and monomeric states in response to carbachol stimulation. Although the present data do not suggest what the function of α-synuclein in the nucleus is, there are numerous reports of nuclear phosphatidylinositol, phospholipases, and related proteins, including phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate, phosphatidylinositol triphosphate, PI 3-kinase, and phosphatidylinositol triphosphate-binding protein (35Tanaka K.

The presence of nuclear phospholipids and related proteins demonstrates that phosphatidylinositol-linked activities occur in nucleus. α-Synuclein may play a role in regulating processes in the PI-cycle in the nucleus as it appears to in cytoplasm and plasma membrane. In conclusion, we have determined that endogenous α-synuclein in the human SY5Y cell exists in at least two normal states, a soluble monomer and an oligomer of ∼45 kDa that is exclusively associated with lipid membranes. This distinctive subcellular distribution of α-synuclein suggests that it is the oligomer that mediates all membrane-linked functions of α-synuclein. The present data support a model in which the α-synuclein oligomer functions in vivo to inhibit PLD2 at the plasma membrane, consistent with the synuclein inhibition of this PLD isoform in vitro. In response to carbachol stimulation, the α-synuclein oligomer translocates from plasma membrane to a light vesicle fraction in cytoplasm with a time course and subcellular localization corresponding to that of muscarinic receptors during ligand-stimulated endocytosis. The data suggest that muscarinic stimulation triggers the release of the α-synuclein oligomer from plasma membrane and transiently disinhibits PLD2, freeing this lipase to mediate several processes of muscarinic receptor endocytosis."

Acta. 1986; 45: 1611-1618PubMed Google Scholar). PTP-PEST, however, appears to be quite stable (6Charest A. Wagner J. Muise E.S. Heng H.H. Tremblay M.L. Genomics. 1995; 28: 501-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Structurally, it is composed of an N-terminal catalytic domain and a C-terminal tail containing five proline-rich regions, several of which constitute consensus Src homology 3 binding sites. Indeed, PTP-PEST binds the adaptor protein Grb2 and the tyrosine kinase Csk in an Src homology 3-dependent manner (7Charest A. Wagner J. Kwan M. Tremblay M.L. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 1643-1651Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 8Davidson D. Cloutier J.F. Gregorieff A. Veillette A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23455-23462Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). PTP-PEST also binds the adaptor protein Shc via a phosphotyrosine binding domain-mediated interaction. However, this interaction occurs in a non-phosphotyrosine-dependent manner through an NPLH sequence in the C-terminal tail of PTP-PEST (9Charest A. Wagner J. Jacob S. McGlade C.J. Tremblay M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8424-8429Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Although PTP-PEST has been shown to associate with these signaling molecules, its role in regulation of these signaling pathways remains to be fully elucidated. Grb2 binding was reported to bring PTP-PEST into association with activated epidermal growth factor receptor; however, the epidermal growth factor receptor does not appear to be a substrate (7Charest A. Wagner J. Kwan M. Tremblay M.L. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 1643-1651Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). An alternative hypothesis is that PTP-PEST may instead regulate epidermal growth factor receptor signaling by dephosphorylating receptor substrates. Csk was recently shown to cooperate with the tyrosine phosphatase PEP, a structural homologue of PTP-PEST, in inhibiting T-cell antigen receptor signaling (10Cloutier J.F. Veillette A. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 189: 111-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar). PEP could dephosphorylate and inactivate PTKs responsible for T-cell activation but only when associated with Csk. A role for PTP-PEST in Csk signaling events has yet to be established. The Shc proteins are adaptor molecules most closely linked with activation of the Ras pathway (11Baldari C.T. Telford J.L. Biol. Chem. 1999; 380: 129-134Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Egan S.E. Giddings B.W. Brooks M.W. Buday L. Sizeland A.M. Weinberg R.A. Nature. 1993; 363: 45-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (1010) Google Scholar). Interestingly, Shc is phosphorylated on tyrosine itself (11Baldari C.T. Telford J.L. Biol. Chem. 1999; 380: 129-134Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). PTP-PEST, however, has not been implicated in regulation of the Ras signaling pathway, and Shc has not been identified as a substrate. In addition to binding these signaling molecules, the C-terminal domain of PTP-PEST has docking sites for two known substrates. p130CAS binds PTP-PEST in an Src homology 3-dependent manner (13Garton A.J. Burnham M.R. Bouton A.H. Tonks N.K. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 877-885Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar), and paxillin binds through its two C-terminal LIM domains to two nonoverlapping stretches of a 52-amino acid sequence in PTP-PEST (14Cote J.F.

Griffin J.D. Schaller M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1405-1413Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Both p130CAS and paxillin are substrates for PTP-PEST, and their association with the C-terminal domain of PTP-PEST is required for dephosphorylation of these substrates in vivo(13Garton A.J. Burnham M.R. Bouton A.H. Tonks N.K. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 877-885Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 15Shen Y. Lyons P. Cooley M. Davidson D. Veillette A. Salgia R. Griffin J.D.

Biol. 1996; 16: 6408-6418Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). Paxillin and p130CAS localize to focal adhesions and undergo rapid tyrosine phosphorylation upon cell adhesion (17Guan J.L. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1997; 29: 1085-1096Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). Paxillin and p130CAS also become tyrosine-phosphorylated in response to various physiological stimulants including bombesin, platelet-derived growth factor, nerve growth factor, and angiotensin II (18Casamassima A. Rozengurt E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9363-9370Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 19Turner C.E. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1998; 30: 955-959Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Both proteins act as adaptor molecules in integrin signaling. Paxillin binds to several focal adhesion-associated proteins including vinculin, FAK, and c-Src (19Turner C.E. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1998; 30: 955-959Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Integrin-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation of paxillin creates binding sites for the SH2 domains of Crk and Csk (20Schaller M.D. Parsons J.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2635-2645Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar, 19Turner C.E. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1998; 30: 955-959Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Tyrosine phosphorylation of paxillin has been implicated in the control of biological events such as cell spreading (21Richardson A. Malik R.K. Hildebrand J.D. Parsons J.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6906-6914Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar), cell adhesion (22Graham I.L. Anderson D.C. Holers V.M. Brown E.J. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 1139-1147Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), and cell motility (23Yano H. Uchida H. Iwasaki T. Mukai M. Akedo H. Nakamura K. Hashimoto S. Sabe H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 957-970Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). Tyrosine phosphorylation of p130CAS also creates docking sites for the SH2 domain of Crk (25Sakai R. Iwamatsu A. Hirano N. Ogawa S. Tanaka T. Nishida J. Yazaki Y. Hirai H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32740-32746Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The p130CAS-Crk complex has been proposed to regulate cell migration (26Klemke R.L. Leng J. Molander R. Brooks P.C. Vuori K. Cheresh D.A. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 961-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (591) Google Scholar), and p130CASis thought to act as a mediator for FAK-promoted cell migration (27Cary L.A. Han D.C. Polte T.R. Hanks S.K. Guan J.L. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 211-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar). PTP-PEST has been implicated in the regulation of cell motility (28Garton A.J. Tonks N.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3811-3818Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar,29Angers-Loustau A. Cote J.F. Charest A. Dowbenko D. Spencer S. Lasky L.A. Tremblay M.L. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 1019-1031Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar) and may do so by targeting paxillin and/or p130CAS for dephosphorylation. Paxillin and p130CAS are potential substrates for several candidate tyrosine kinases including FAK and CAKβ. Paxillin and p130CAS can directly bind to FAK and CAKβ and become tyrosine-phosphorylated in response to stimuli that activate these PTKs (17Guan J.L. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1997; 29: 1085-1096Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). FAK and CAKβ are structurally related cytoplasmic tyrosine kinases composed of a central catalytic domain flanked by N- and C-terminal noncatalytic domains (30Avraham H. Park S.Y. Schinkmann K. Avraham S. Cell. Signal. 2000; 12: 123-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar). Although structurally similar and able to associate with many of the same proteins, it is unclear whether these kinases share similar functions. While FAK has been most strongly implicated as a major component of integrin-mediated signaling pathways (17Guan J.L. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1997; 29: 1085-1096Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar), there have been conflicting reports as to whether CAKβ is regulated by integrin mediated cell adhesion (31Astier A. Avraham H. Manie S.N. Groopman J. Canty T. Avraham S. Freedman A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 228-232Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar, 32Li J. Avraham H.

Chem. 1995; 270: 21206-21219Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar). Unlike FAK, CAKβ is regulated by stimuli that induce changes in intracellular Ca2+ (30Avraham H. Park S.Y. Schinkmann K. Avraham S. Cell. Signal. 2000; 12: 123-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar). Like other PTKs, tyrosine phosphorylation of FAK and CAKβ plays an important role in regulating signaling. FAK and CAKβ share four conserved sites of tyrosine phosphorylation. They are the Src-family SH2 domain binding site at Tyr397 in FAK and Tyr402 in CAKβ, the Grb2-SH2 domain binding site at Tyr925 in FAK and Tyr881 in CAKβ, and two regulatory sites in the activation loop of the kinase domains: Tyr576/577 in FAK and Tyr579/580 in CAKβ (30Avraham H. Park S.Y. Schinkmann K. Avraham S. Cell. Signal. 2000; 12: 123-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar,34Li X. Dy R.C. Cance W.G. Graves L.M. Earp H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8917-8924Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). FAK and CAKβ are particularly good candidate PTP-PEST substrates, since these kinases both bind paxillin and p130CAS (35Schlaepfer D.D. Hunter T. Trends Cell Biol. 1998; 8: 151-157Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar), two previously identified substrates (15Shen Y. Lyons P. Cooley M. Davidson D. Veillette A. Salgia R. Griffin J.D. Schaller M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1405-1413Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 16Garton A.J. Flint A.J. Tonks N.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6408-6418Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). Two lines of evidence suggest that FAK may be a substrate. First, PTP-PEST activity was coimmunoprecipitated with FAK (36Shen Y. Schneider G. Cloutier J.F. Veillette A. Schaller M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6474-6481Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar), although this association is indirect and appears to be mediated by paxillin. Second, PTP-PEST−/− cells exhibited not only increased paxillin and p130CAS phosphotyrosine but also increased tyrosine phosphorylation of FAK (29Angers-Loustau A. Cote J.F. Charest A. Dowbenko D. Spencer S. Lasky L.A. Tremblay M.L. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 1019-1031Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). These results suggest that FAK may be a substrate of PTP-PEST and that PTP-PEST may regulate signaling both at the level of the kinase and the substrate. On the other hand, PTP-PEST may not play a major role in FAK dephosphorylation, since the two proteins fail to colocalize intracellularly. 2P. D. Lyons, J. M. Dunty, E. M. Schaefer, and M. D. Schaller, unpublished observations. Alternatively, PTP-PEST may regulate CAKβ signaling. In this report, we explore the hypothesis that FAK and CAKβ may be PTP-PEST substrates. We identify CAKβ as a specific substrate of PTP-PEST using a substrate-trapping approach and by demonstrating dephosphorylation of CAKβ by PTP-PEST in vivo. In contrast, PTP-PEST bound very weakly to FAK in a substrate-trapping assay and was a weaker substrate for dephosphorylation than CAKβ. We determined that PTP-PEST could target the major autophosphorylation site of CAKβ as well as one or both tyrosines in the activation loop of the catalytic domain. We demonstrate that PTP-PEST is able to inhibit CAKβ kinase activity both in vitro and in vivo. Finally, endogenous PTP-PEST and endogenous CAKβ were shown to reside in similar cellular compartments within GN4 and A7r5 cells. These results suggest that PTP-PEST can inhibit CAKβ signaling by impairing the activity of the kinase and by dephosphorylating downstream substrates. HEK 293 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/Ham's F-12 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and A7r5 vascular smooth muscle cells in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. GN4 cells were obtained from Dr. H. Shelton Earp and were maintained in Richter's minimal essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Cells were transfected using LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's recommended protocol. The epitope-tagged (KT3) wild type, dl367–400, dl297–493, and P337A PTP-PEST constructs have been described previously (15Shen Y. Lyons P. Cooley M. Davidson D. Veillette A. Salgia R. Griffin J.D.

Chem. 1998; 273: 6474-6481Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). To construct pcDNA 3.1-FAK, the FAK cDNA was excised from pBS-FAK (37Schaller M.D. Borgman C.A. Cobb B.S. Vines R.R. Reynolds A.B. Parsons J.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5192-5196Crossref PubMed Scopus (1293) Google Scholar) using XbaI andSalI, which cut in the multiple cloning site flanking the FAK insert. The FAK-containing fragment was inserted between theNheI and XhoI sites of pcDNA3.1. Wild type and CAKβ YF mutants were kindly provided by Drs. Xiong Li and H. Shelton Earp (University of North Carolina) and have been described previously (34Li X. Dy R.C. Cance W.G. Graves L.M. Earp H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8917-8924Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). For expression as a glutathioneS-transferase (GST) fusion protein, a fragment of the PTP-PEST cDNA encoding the catalytic domain (amino acids 1–301) was amplified by polymerase chain reaction and subcloned into pGEX2TK (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in frame with the GST coding sequence. The C231S PTP-PEST substrate-trapping mutant (GST/PTP-PESTC231S) was generously provided by Dr. André Veillette (McGill University). This mutant encodes amino acids 1–301 with cysteine 231 mutated to serine. GST-paxillinN-C3 was generated by amplifying a fragment of the paxillin cDNA (encoding amino acids 1–312) by polymerase chain reaction using primers that created a BamHI site at the 5′-end and an EcoRI site at the 3′-end. The fragment was subcloned into pGEX2TK in frame with the GST coding sequence. The fusion proteins were expressed by incubation with 0.3 mmisopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside for 5 h at 30 °C, the bacteria were lysed by sonication, and the fusion proteins were purified using glutathione-agarose beads (Sigma) (38Smith D.B. Johnson K.S. Gene ( Amst. ). 1988; 67: 31-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (5047) Google Scholar). Cells were lysed in modified radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (36Shen Y. Schneider G. Cloutier J.F. Veillette A. Schaller M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6474-6481Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar), and protein concentrations were determined using the BCA assay (Pierce). Immunoprecipitations were performed using ∼500 μg of cell lysate and 10 μl of polyclonal antisera or 2 μg of purified antibody. For CAKβ immunoprecipitations, a polyclonal antiserum was used (described below). Paxillin was immunoprecipitated using a polyclonal antiserum described previously (39Thomas J.W. Cooley M.A. Broome J.M. Salgia R. Griffin J.D. Lombardo C.R. Schaller M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36684-36692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), and FAK was immunoprecipitated using the BC4 polyclonal antiserum (37Schaller M.D. Borgman C.A. Cobb B.S. Vines R.R. Reynolds A.B. Parsons J.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5192-5196Crossref PubMed Scopus (1293) Google Scholar), a gift of Dr. Thomas Parsons (University of Virginia). The immune complexes were recovered by incubation with protein A-Sepharose beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for 1–2 h at 4 °C. Immune complexes were washed twice with lysis buffer and twice with Tris-buffered saline (10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl). The samples were boiled in Laemmli sample buffer (40Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207231) Google Scholar) and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting (41Kanner S.B. Reynolds A.B. Vines R.R. Parsons J.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 3328-3332Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar). For Western blotting, monoclonal antibodies recognizing CAKβ, paxillin, and the RC20 phosphotyrosine antibody were purchased from BD Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY). The FAK 2A7 monoclonal antibody was kindly provided by Dr. Thomas Parsons (University of Virginia). A rabbit polyclonal antiserum recognizing the noncatalytic domain of PTP-PEST has been described previously (15Shen Y. Lyons P. Cooley M. Davidson D. Veillette A. Salgia R. Griffin J.D. Schaller M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1405-1413Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). CAKβ phosphorylation site-specific antibodies (PY402, PY579, and PY579/580) were obtained from BIOSOURCE International (Camarillo, CA). These affinity-purified (using both negative and positive affinity purification methods) rabbit polyclonal antibodies have been shown to be highly selective for the targeted phosphorylation site by analyzing site-directed (YF) mutants at the phosphorylation site of interest (see Fig. 5). For RC20 phosphotyrosine immunoblots, membranes were blocked in Tris-buffered saline (10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl), supplemented with 0.1% Tween 20 (Sigma). For CAKβ phosphospecific antibodies, immunoblots were blocked in Tris-buffered saline, supplemented with 0.1% Tween 20 (Sigma) and 2% fish gelatin (Sigma). Immunoblots were incubated with 0.5 μg/ml phosphospecific antibody for 1 h at room temperature, washed, and incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated protein A (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was used for detection of proteins. The rat CAKβ cDNA was used to generate a GST fusion protein containing amino acids 226–306. These residues were amplified by polymerase chain reaction and subcloned into pGEX2TK in-frame with the GST coding sequence. This fusion protein was gel-purified and used as an antigen to prepare polyvalent rabbit antiserum as described previously (37Schaller M.D. Borgman C.A. Cobb B.S. Vines R.R. Reynolds A.B. Parsons J.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5192-5196Crossref PubMed Scopus (1293) Google Scholar). For primary immunizations, 1 mg of fusion protein in phosphate-buffered saline was emulsified with complete Freund's adjuvant and injected subcutaneously into female New Zealand White rabbits. For all boosts, 500 μg of antigen in phosphate-buffered saline was emulsified with Freund's incomplete adjuvant and injected subcutaneously. Serum was prepared by centrifugation of cellular and clotted material from whole blood. Cells were treated with pervanadate and lysed as described previously (16Garton A.J. Flint A.J. Tonks N.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6408-6418Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). Briefly, confluent cells were treated with 50 mm pervanadate for 30 min and lysed in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer supplemented with 5 mm iodoacetic acid for 30 min at 4 °C. After lysis, 10 mm dithiothreitol was added to inactivate any unreacted iodoacetic acid. Pervanadate-treated cell lysates (500 μg) were precleared with 10 μg of GST bound to glutathione-agarose beads at 4 °C for 1 h. The cleared supernatants were then incubated with 5 μg of either GST alone, GST/PTP-PESTWT, or GST/PTP-PESTC231S fusion protein immobilized on glutathione-agarose beads at 4 °C for 1 h. The beads were washed as described for immune complexes above, and bound protein was detected by Western blotting. CAKβ and FAK were immunoprecipitated using polyclonal antiserum as described above. Immune complexes were washed twice in lysis buffer and twice in kinase reaction buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 5 mmMnCl2, 5 mm MgCl2) and then resuspended in 20 μl of kinase reaction buffer supplemented with 20 μm cold ATP, 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (6000 Ci/mol; PerkinElmer Life Sciences), and 5 μg of GST-paxillinN-C3 as an exogenous substrate. The reaction was stopped by the addition of Laemmli sample buffer after incubation at room temperature for 10 min. Samples were resolved by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by autoradiography. In some experiments, pervanadate-treated lysates (500–1000 μg) were incubated with GST/PTP-PESTWT(1–4 μg) immobilized on glutathione beads for up to 20 min at room temperature or 1 h on ice. The phosphatase was removed by centrifugation, vanadate was added to the sample, and CAKβ or FAK was immunoprecipitated. The immune complexes were analyzed in the in vitro kinase assay or by Western blotting. Cells were fixed in 3.7% formaldehyde and permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100 as previously described (42Cooley M.A. Broome J.M. Ohngemach C. Romer L.H. Schaller M.D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 3247-3263Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Commercially available monoclonal antibodies directed against PTP-PEST (Exalpha Biologicals Inc., Boston MA) and CAKβ (BD Transduction Laboratories) were used. A secondary rabbit anti-mouse bridging antibody and tertiary donkey anti-rabbit antibody conjugated to fluorescein (Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories Inc., West Grove PA) were used to detect the primary antibody. The cells were visualized using a Leitz Orthoplan microscope, and images were collected with a Hamamatsu CCD camera and MetaMorph imaging software (Universal Imaging Corp., West Chester, PA). The hypothesis that FAK and CAKβ are PTP-PEST substrates was initially tested using an in vitro substrate-trapping assay. FAK and CAKβ were overexpressed in HEK 293 cells, and the cells were treated with pervanadate to increase the cellular pool of tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins. Cell lysates were prepared and incubated with GST fusion proteins containing the catalytic domains of either wild type PTP-PEST (GST/PTP-PESTWT) or the catalytically inactive, substrate-trapping mutant, GST/PTP-PESTC231S. As shown in Fig. 1 A, CAKβ bound to GST/PTP-PESTC231S (lane 3) but was unable to bind GST/PTP-PESTWT or GST alone (lanes 1 and 2). Upon overexposure of the blot, however, a very small amount of CAKβ was observed to bind to GST/PTP-PESTWT (data not shown), implying that there may be a weak interaction between CAKβ and an unidentified site in the PTP-PEST catalytic domain. CAKβ from lysates of cells not stimulated with pervanadate failed to bind to GST/PTP-PESTC231S (data not shown; see Fig. 4 A). These two results suggest that the observed phosphotyrosine dependent interaction of CAKβ with GST/PTP-PESTC231S was due to substrate binding to the active site of the phosphatase. Whereas CAKβ was readily detectable in complex with GST/PTP-PESTC231S (Fig. 1 A,lane 3), no detectable FAK was bound (Fig.1 B, lane 3). FAK could very weakly bind to the GST/PTP-PESTC231S fusion protein as seen upon overexposure of the Western blot (data not shown). Note that the signal intensities of the loading controls for the FAK blot (Fig.1 B, lane 4) and CAKβ blot (Fig.1 A, lane 4) are similar. These data suggest that CAKβ is a preferred substrate for PTP-PEST in comparison with FAK. In order to examine the ability of PTP-PEST to substrate trap endogenous CAKβ, the A7r5 vascular smooth muscle cell line was employed. Cells were treated with pervanadate, and lysates were prepared. CAKβ from these lysates bound to GST/PTP-PESTC231S but was unable to bind GST/PTP-PESTWT or GST alone (Fig. 1 C,lanes 1–3). CAKβ from cells not treated with pervanadate also failed to bind to any of the fusion proteins (data not shown). These results suggest that CAKβ was being trapped by the catalytically inactive mutant, GST/PTP-PESTC231S, and is likely a substrate for PTP-PEST.Figure 4PTP-PEST targets activation loop tyrosines.

In the button mushroom, Agaricus bisporus, it is synthesized from fructose by the enzyme mannitol 2-dehydrogenase (MtDH; EC 1.1.1.138) using NADPH as a cofactor. Mannitol serves as the main storage carbon (up to 50% of the fruit body dry weight) and plays a critical role in growth, fruit body development, osmoregulation, and salt tolerance. Furthermore, mannitol dehydrogenases are being evaluated for commercial mannitol production as alternatives to the less efficient chemical reduction of fructose. Given the importance of mannitol metabolism and mannitol dehydrogenases, MtDH was cloned into the pET28 expression system and overexpressed in Escherichia coli. Kinetic and physicochemical properties of the recombinant enzyme are indistinguishable from the natural enzyme. The crystal structure of its binary complex with NADP was solved at 1.5-Å resolution and refined to an R value of 19.3%. It shows MtDH to be a tetramer and a member of the short chain dehydrogenase/reductase family of enzymes.

Williamson J.D. Pharr D.M. Trends Plant Sci. 1996; 5: 139-144Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar, 2Jennings D.H. Adv. Microb. Physiol. 1984; 25: 149-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). InAgaricus bisporus, it is the main storage carbon and can contribute up to 20% of the mycelium dry weight and up to 50% of the fruit body dry weight (3Rast D. Planta. 1965; 64: 81-93Crossref Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Mannitol has been reported to accumulate in response to environmental stresses such as salt stress (2Jennings D.H. Adv. Microb. Physiol. 1984; 25: 149-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 4Stoop J.M. Mooibroek H. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1998; 64: 4689-4696Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 5Stoop J.M.H. Pharr D.M. Plant Physiol. 1994; 106: 503-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). In fungi, its function as an osmoregulatory compound might also be critical in providing an influx of water from the environment to support turgor and fruit body development (2Jennings D.H. Adv. Microb. Physiol. 1984; 25: 149-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 6Holtz R.B. J. Agric. Food Chem. 1971; 19: 172-173Crossref Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Other physiological roles of mannitol are also likely including service as the main and most efficient respiratory source during postharvest development and fruit body senescence (7Hammond J.B.W. Nichols R. J. Sci. Food Agric. 1975; 26: 835-842Crossref Scopus (140) Google Scholar). The advantage of mannitol catabolism over sucrose may be explained by the fact that NAD(P)H is produced during mannitol oxidation and can be converted to ATP, resulting in a more efficient system than in organisms that metabolize sugars. Furthermore, mannitol metabolism may be involved in the recycling of NADP and NADPH. NADP produced during the conversion of fructose to mannitol becomes available for the oxidative reactions of the pentose phosphate shunt, which in turn release NADPH. The interaction between these two biochemical pathways may result in a fine regulation of the cellular NADP/NADPH ratio and suggests a role for mannitol metabolism in growth regulation (8Dütsch G.A. Rast D. Phytochemistry. 1972; 11: 2677-2681Crossref Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The production of transgenic mushrooms with altered characteristics is possible, because transformation procedures have been established (9Mooibroek H. van de Rhee M. Soler-Rivas C. Mendes O.

Genet. 1996; 30: 166-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The lack of detailed information at the molecular level regarding genes and proteins involved in central metabolic processes (such as mannitol metabolism) has restricted the breeding of A. bisporus by genetic methods. Apart from its agrotechnological importance, mannitol dehydrogenases are being evaluated as an alternative way to synthesize mannitol from fructose. The ability to produce large quantities of pure and active enzyme using microbial expression systems together with the more efficient enzymatic mannitol production process (compared with the chemical reduction of fructose) may enable commercial production of pure mannitol for use in the food industry. Given the importance of mannitol metabolism in fungi, theMtDH 1 gene of A. bisporus has been cloned and characterized (4Stoop J.M. Mooibroek H. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1998; 64: 4689-4696Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, the knowledge of the three-dimensional structure reported in this work makes it easier and more rational to produce mutated variants of mannitol dehydrogenase. Expression of the A. bisporus MtDH gene within the Escherichia coli host BL21(DE3), purification of the resulting soluble protein, and production of monoclinic crystals (space group C2) have been reported previously (12Sassoon J. Hörer S. Stoop J. Mooibroek H. Baumann U. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2001; 57: 711-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). Crystals of the binary complex (MtDH and NADP+) were obtained under similar conditions using the sitting drop vapor diffusion method. NADP+ was added to the protein solution to a final concentration of 1 mm prior to crystallization. The drop was created by combining 5 µl of the protein solution (10–20 mg/ml and 1 mm NADP+) with 5 µl of well solution (90 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 18% PEG 4K, and 9% isopropanol at 20 °C). X-ray diffraction data were collected to 1.5-Å resolution at 120 K using a MAR345 image plate detector at beamline BM1A at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility in Grenoble (wavelength = 0.800 Å). The detector was placed 280 mm from the crystal. Each image was exposed in dose mode for ∼5 min and consisted of a 0.5° rotation of the crystal. The data from one crystal (1.5 × 0.2 × 0.1 mm) were processed using MOSFLM (13Leslie A.G.W. Jnt. CCP 4/ESF-EACBM Newslett. Protein Crystallogr. 1996; 32: 7-8Google Scholar) and SCALA (14Evans P.R. Jnt. CCP 4/ESF-EACBM Newslett. Protein Crystallogr. 1997; 33: 22-24Google Scholar, 15Collaborative Computational Project, Number 4 Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol.

Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16991) Google Scholar). Initial molecular replacement calculations proved to be difficult because of the low sequence identity (30% at most) to members of the short chain dehydrogenase/reductase (SDR) family with known three-dimensional structure and because of the large unit cell content in the crystals of MtDH. Parallel attempts to determine the structure by multiple isomorphous replacement were hampered by nonisomorphism where the cell axes varied by 5–8%. Hence, a more extensive molecular replacement approach was undertaken. The tetramer of mouse lung carbonyl reductase (Protein Data Bank entry 1cyd) was used as a search model. The probe had to be modified to give significant solutions in the rotation function calculation in the following way. A sequence alignment between MtDH and mouse lung carbonyl reductase was calculated, and all nonconserved residues were changed to alanine with the SEAMAN program (17Kleywegt G.J. Jnt. CCP4/ESF-EACBM Newslett. Protein Crystallogr. 1996; 32: 32-36Google Scholar). Data from 6 to 10 Å was used in the cross-rotation search, and three tetramers could be located in the asymmetric unit. This corresponds to a Matthews coefficient (18Matthews B.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1968; 33: 491-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (7935) Google Scholar)V M of 2.43 Å3/Da with ∼47.5% solvent volume. Subsequent to rigid body refinement, noncrystallographic symmetry restraints were applied, and torsion angle refinement was performed using data in the resolution range from 40 to 3.5 Å (R factor = 39%,R free = 40%). In a 2Fo −Fc electron density map, 243 (of 265) residues could be identified, and 222 side chains were build into the electron density map using the program O (19Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13016) Google Scholar). Attempts to employ noncrystallographic symmetry averaging using CNS and DM (20Cowtan K. Jnt. CCP4/ESF-EACBM Newslett. Protein Crystallogr. 1994; 31: 34-38Google Scholar) failed. The electron density correlation dropped during averaging, and the quality of the map became inferior. In hindsight this can be explained by the large differences among the three individual tetramers concerning their anisotropic movement in the crystal. At this stage automatic model building was carried out with the program ARP/wARP (21Perrakis A. Morris R. Lamzin V.S. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 458-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (2566) Google Scholar) in mode warpNtrace using data in the resolution range from 40 to 1.5 Å, which led to a dramatic improvement. After 10 cycles of automated model building, 260 residues (excluding the 5 N-terminal residues) and the NADP+ could be identified in the resulting 2Fo − Fcelectron density map. Two nickel ions per tetramer (coordinated each by the C termini of two monomers) were also added. Evidence showing that these metal ions were nickel arose from the purification by nickel-chelate affinity chromatography and the lack of chelating agents in all buffers and are therefore presumed to be purification artifacts. After the addition of about 3000 water molecules, torsion angle and individual B factor refinements, the R factor dropped to 22.3% (R free = 23.6%). Visual inspection of the electron density map and comparison of the three individual tetramers revealed a striking difference in quality, reflected also in the average individual B factors for each subunit (Table II). TLS refinement with the program REFMAC (22Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Lebedev A. Wilson K.S. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1999; 55: 247-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (1012) Google Scholar, 23Winn M.D. Isupov M.N. Murshudov G.N. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2001; 57: 122-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (1655) Google Scholar) was carried out to account for this behavior. In this procedure, every monomer was treated as a rigid body, for which the three tensors T, L, and S were refined. Because of the possibility that crystal packing restricts movement of whole molecules (24Hery S. Genest D. Smith J.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 279: 303-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), the largest movements as modeled by the TLS parameters are found in the tetramer showing the smallest number of crystal contacts. The removal of the subunit movement from the individual Bfactors resulted in comparable B factors for the individual subunits (Table II) and enabled the application of noncrystallographic symmetry restraints. The final model statistics after anisotropicB factor refinement for the nickel ions are listed in TableIII.Table IITLS refinementTetramerAverage BfactorsNumber of crystal contactsBefore TLS refinementAfter TLS refinement1 (ABCD)27.113.3382 (EFGH)18.013.3503 (IJKL)18.613.349Comparison of average B factors before and after TLS refinement. The difference between the individual subunits can be modeled by refining the three parameters (T, L, and S) for each subunit, which corresponds to a movement of the individual subunits as rigid bodies. After this treatment of the data, the remainingB factors consist solely of the individual movement of each atom, and the average B factors are identical.

The substrate mannitol was modeled into the active site cavity with the program AUTODOCK using the genetic algorithm of the program. The results from 100 docking calculations were clustered into groups containing structures with less than 1.5-Å root mean square deviation. The clusters were sorted by energy. The quaternary structure of MtDH was investigated by determining the molecular weight of MtDH in solution by size exclusion chromatography and dynamic light scattering. For the size exclusion chromatography, a prepacked Amersham Pharmacia Biotech Superdex 75 HR16/60 column was equilibrated in 100 mm NaCl and 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5. The flow rate was set to 0.5 ml/min and controlled by a fast protein liquid chromatography system fromAmersham Pharmacia Biotech. The column was calibrated with a set of standard proteins (1 mg each), and the molecular weight of MtDH was determined by graphical comparison of the measured elution volumes. Dynamic light scattering was performed on a single wavelength fixed angle DynaPro system (Protein Solutions). Protein samples were centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 10 min and measured in 12-µl quartz cuvettes. Size distribution analysis was performed with the program DYNALS. Kinetic measurements were done with a SPECTRAmax 250 microplate spectrophotometer (Molecular Devices). The assay buffer containing the substrate (mannitol or fructose) at different concentrations from 10 to 500 mm, and the cofactor (NADP+ or NADPH) in the range of 40–300 µm was incubated at 30 °C. After the addition of MtDH (4–10 nm), the absorption of NADPH at 340 nm was measured for 30 min, and the initial rate constants were calculated.K m values and V max for the substrates and the cofactor were calculated with the program LEONORA (25Cornish-Bowden A. Analysis of Enzyme Kinetic Data. Oxford University Press, 1995Google Scholar). MtDH is a member of the SDR family of enzymes, also known as the tyrosine-dependent oxidoreductase family (reviewed in Ref.26Jornvall H. Persson B. Krook M. Atrian S. Gonzalez-Duarte R. Jeffery J. Ghosh D. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 6003-6013Crossref PubMed Scopus (1167) Google Scholar). The characteristic of this family is the extension of the typical Rossmann fold consisting of two βαβαβ motifs βA-αB-βB-αC-βC and βD-αE-βE-αF-βF (27Rossmann M.G. Liljas A. Bränden C.-I. Banaszak L.J. Boyer P.D. Evolutionary and Structural Relationships Among Dehydrogenases. Academic Press, New York1975Crossref Scopus (714) Google Scholar) (reviewed in Ref. 28Lesk A.M. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1995; 5: 775-783Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar) by a seventh β-strand with a left-handed cross-over connection between strands F and G. Secondary structure elements were assigned according to the convention described by Ghosh et al. (29Ghosh D. Weeks C.M. Grochulski P. Duax W.L. Erman M. Rimsay R.L. Orr J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 10064-10068Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). The loop between βF and αG contains two small helices (αFG1, residues 204–209 and αFG2, residues 211–220) and one β-strand (βFG1, residues 227–229), which form one side of the active site cavity. Within the SDR family this loop is responsible for the substrate specificity among the different enzymes (30Tanaka N. Nonaka T. Tanabe T. Yoshimoto T. Tsuru D. Mitsui Y.

Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 7630-7637Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The other side of the active site is lined by the insertion loop between βE and αF, which in the case of MtDH contains a small antiparallel β-sheet, βEF1 (residues 157–159) and βEF2 (residues 162–164) (Fig. 1 A). Size exclusion chromatography and dynamic light scattering showed that MtDH is a tetramer in solution. Our kinetic data showed cooperativity in neither the oxidative nor the reductive reaction of MtDH. The crystal structure revealed that the asymmetric unit contains three tetramers. Each tetramer possesses internal 222 symmetry. The interaction surface is 1460 Å2 between monomers 1 (cyan) and 2 (red), 660 Å2 between monomers 1 and 3 (green), and 1740 Å2 between monomers 1 and 4 (magenta) (color coding according to Fig.1 B; calculations were done with the CNS software package (16Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol.

The total surface area buried in each monomer therefore is 3850 Å2 or ∼32%. The C termini of monomer 1s and 3 and the C termini of monomers 2 and 4 coordinate one metal ion each. The absence of anomalous scattering for this metal ion using Cu-Kα radiation (1.54 Å) combined with the presence of anomalous scattering peaks using synchrotron radiation (0.80 Å) give good evidence that this metal ion indeed is nickel, which is probably a purification artifact. Also, the trigonal prismatic coordination sphere of each metal ion (two C termini from two individual subunits of one tetramer and four water molecules) is not uncommon for nickel under conditions at which sterical hindrance prevents octahedral coordination. The NADP+ binding site is located at the C-terminal end of the β-sheet forming the Rossmann fold (Fig.1 A). The substrate binding crevice forms an oval-shaped cavity with dimensions of ∼20 × 12 × 7 Å with the cofactor at the bottom of the cavity. Both riboses of the NADP+ have 2E (C2′-endo) puckering, the nicotinamide ring is in the syn conformation, and the adenine in the anti conformation (nomenclature according to International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry-International Union of Biochemistry nomenclature for polynucleotides (37IUPAC-IUB Joint Commission on Biochemical Nomenclature (JCBN) Eur. J. Biochem. 1983; 131: 9-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar)). This conformation classifies MtDH as B-stereospecific and is typical for SDR enzymes (38Oppenheimer N.J. Handlon A.J. Sigman D.S. Mechansism of NAD-dependent Enzymes: The Enzymes, Mechanism of Catalysis. Academic Press, New York1992Google Scholar). The cofactor is bound to the enzyme by an extensive network of hydrogen bonds, which also involves seven water molecules (Fig. 2). The loops at the C-terminal end of β-strands A, B, and C are responsible for the binding of the adenosine moiety. In the first loop, Asn20 and Arg21 form hydrogen bonds to the phosphate group of the ribose and the O3′ of the ribose, respectively. The main-chain amide groups of Arg43, Ser44, and Ala45 also form hydrogen bonds to the phosphate group. In addition, the side chains of Arg43 and Ser44coordinate two water molecules together with the phosphate group. The Asn69 hydrogen bonds to the adenosyl amino group, whereas the main chain amide of Val70 interacts with the N1 ring nitrogen. Gln206 and Ile23 form direct hydrogen bonds to the pyrophosphate moiety, whereas Gly18, Arg21, Gly24, Asn96, Gly98, and Thr204 form hydrogen bonds mediated by water molecules. The nicotinamide moiety also shows several residues in hydrogen bonding distance. The active site Lys173 forms a bifurcate hydrogen bond to the O2′ and O3′ of the ribose; the active site tyrosine also forms a hydrogen bond to the O2′. The amide group of the nicotinamide is kept in place by a contact to Val202 and Thr204 and an additional water molecule. All attempts to obtain a structure of MtDH with various combinations of NADP, NADPH, mannitol, and fructose to date have failed. For that reason mannitol was modeled into the active site cavity with the program AUTODOCK. The cluster with the lowest energy contained 38 of 100 docked structures. This orientation was assumed to be the best orientation possible for mannitol. In our model, the substrate can form seven hydrogen bonds to the protein. The active site serine (Ser149) is in hydrogen-bonding distance to O1′ and O2; Ser151 also interacts with O2′. Further contacts are possible between O3′ and the amide group of the nicotinamide and between O5′ and Gln166. This orientation places the C2′ at a distance of 3.4 Å to the C4 of the nicotinamide, to which the hydrogen is transferred during catalysis (Fig.3). Structural analysis of other members of the SDR family has shown that three residues are crucial for catalysis, forming the so-called catalytic triad (30Tanaka N. Nonaka T. Tanabe T. Yoshimoto T.

The role of the lysine is to orient the nicotinamide moiety of the NADP by forming a bifurcate hydrogen bond to the O2′ and O3′ of the ribose (46Duax W.L. Griffin J.F. Ghosh D. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1996; 6: 813-823Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The proposed reaction mechanism suggests Tyr169 to be deprotonated. This is facilitated by the positively charged environment provided by Lys173 and the NADP+ itself. During catalysis, the tyrosine directly interacts with the substrate hydroxyl group. In the structure presented here, the putative position of the substrate is occupied by a water molecule, which is hydrogen-bonded to both of the active site residues participating in catalysis, Ser149 and Tyr169, and to Ser151. This water molecule lies within a distance of 0.88 Å to the proposed position of the O2′ of the mannitol obtained by modeling. A schematic drawing of the reaction mechanism is shown in Fig. 4.Figure 4Proposed catalytic mechanism of MtDH. The nicotinamide moiety of the NADP and two residues directly involved in catalysis, Ser149 and Tyr169, are shown. The hydrogen transfer is B-stereospecific (see “Results and Discussion”).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The enzymatic parameters of MtDH in steady-state kinetics have been determined for recombinant MtDH (Table IV). The results are comparable with the data determined for the native enzyme isolated from A. bisporus sporocarps (47Ruffner H.P. Rast D. Tobler H. Karesch H.

Phytochemistry. 1978; 17: 865-868Crossref Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Three steps proved to be crucial for fast structure determination and refinement in the case of MtDH. First, different members of the SDR family, for which the three-dimensional structure was available, were used as probes in the molecular replacement calculations. Of those, only one (mouse lung carbonyl reductase; Protein Data Bank entry 1cyd) gave interpretable solutions for the cross-rotation and translation function. In addition, the probe had to be modified. On the basis of a sequence alignment and modeling with the program SWISSMODEL (48Schwede T. Diemand A. Guex N. Peitsch M. Res. Microbiol. 2000; 151: 107-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar), all nonconserved residues were changed to alanine (except for the glycines, which were kept), and differing loops were deleted. Second, automatic model building with ARP/wARP made fast model building possible, keeping in mind that the asymmetric unit of the crystal consists of three tetramers that are not similar enough to apply real-space averaging. Third, describing the difference between the three tetramers as independent rigid body movements and the separate treatment of this behavior with the three parameters T, L, and S for each individual subunit led to remainingB factors that were very similar between the subunits and allowed for subsequent application of noncrystallographic symmetry restraints. This procedure dropped the R factor andR free by about 3%. The movement of the three tetramers can be described with a set of three nonintersecting screw axes for each subunit (Fig. 5). A comparison with Table II clearly shows that tetramer 1 (monomers A, B, C, and D), having the highest B factors, also undergoes the largest movements in the crystal. An analysis of the crystal contacts formed by the three tetramers is in accordance to the hypothesis of Hery et al. (24Hery S. Genest D. Smith J.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 279: 303-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), who theorized that crystal contacts can restrict the movement of whole molecules. The number of contacts is 38 for tetramer 1 compared with 50 and 49 for tetramers 2 and 3, respectively. The treatment of the data as rigid body movement of whole monomers significantly improved the quality of the electron density in tetramer 1, but it is still worse than for the two other tetramers. The kinetic constants of recombinant MtDH are comparable with those of the native enzyme. The very low affinity for the substrates has been reported for mannitol dehydrogenases from other organisms (47Ruffner H.P. Rast D. Tobler H. Karesch H. Phytochemistry. 1978; 17: 865-868Crossref Scopus (29) Google Scholar). MtDH can also to some extent use sorbitol or arabitol as a substrate. This is also demonstrated by our modeling studies. Mannitol can form seven hydrogen bonds to MtDH (see Table V and Fig. 3), whereas sorbitol and arabinol are only able to form six hydrogen bonds. The high K m values may explain why we have not succeeded until now to co-crystallize the binary complex of MtDH and NADP+ with either mannitol or fructose. The highK m value for fructose is probably because of the fact that it is actually the open and not the hemiketal form of the sugar that undergoes the reaction. The equilibrium between the open and ring forms leaves very little substrate in the open form. The ring opening is base-catalyzed, and Tyr169 may act as a catalytic base for both the ring opening and the reduction of the ketone. The pK a of Tyr169 is lowered by the positively charged environment formed by Lys173 and the oxidized NADP+ in the case of mannitol oxidation, leading to a pH optimum of about 9.0 in the case of MtDH. Therefore the distance between the catalytic tyrosine and the lysine can be correlated to the pH dependence of the different enzymes in the SDR family (49Yamamoto K. Kurisu G. Kusunoki M. Tabata S.

An interesting possibility is to change the preference for the cofactor NADP to the much cheaper NAD by site-specific mutagenesis. The ability to change the cofactor specificity of NAD(P) utilizing enzymes has been demonstrated previously in the case of glutathione reductase (50Scrutton N.S. Berry A. Perham R.N. Nature. 1990; 343: 38-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (647) Google Scholar). A structure alignment was produced with the programs DEJAVU and LSQMAN (51Kleywegt G.J. Jones T.A. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 277: 525-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). Structures with less than 1.9 Å root mean square deviation for the Cα-carbons were compared. An alignment based on this superimposition gives suggestions of mutations necessary to change the cofactor specificity from NADP to NAD (Fig. 6). Two amino acid stretches are responsible for the cofactor specificity, the loop between βA and αB, and the loop between βB and αC. The first loop includes the GXXXGXG motif, whereX can be any amino acid. In enzymes using NADP, the position in front of the second glycine (Arg21 in the case of MtDH) is occupied by a positively charged amino acid (arginine or lysine), whereas enzymes using NAD prefer small or even negatively charged amino acids (serine, threonine, or aspartate). A second, highly conserved arginine (Arg43 in MtDH) is found for all proteins using NADP. This arginine is located in the loop between βB and αC. For NAD utilizing enzymes, different modes of interaction with the cofactor can be seen in this position. In the case of Protein Data Bank entries 1eny and 1eno (enoyl-acyl carrier protein reductase fromMycobacterium tuberculosis and Brassica napus), aromatic residues are making stacking interactions with the adenine ring, whereas a glutamine can be found in enoyl-acyl carrier protein reductase of E. coli (Protein Data Bank entry 1qg6) and an isoleucine in 7-α-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase from E. coli (Protein Data Bank entry 1fmc). The first steps in changing the cofactor specificity are therefore mutations of Arg21to threonine, serine, or aspartic acid and of Arg43 to either an aromatic or apolar residue.

Con-G did not affect NMDA-evoked ionic currents in cells expressing NR1a/NR2A, but it showed inhibitory activity in cells expressing NR1a/NR2B receptors and the triheteromeric combination of NR1a/NR2A/NR2B. An Ala-rich con-G analog, con-G[Q6G/γ7K/N8A/γ10A/γ14A/K15A/S16A/N17A] (Ala/con-G, where γ is Gla), in which all nonessential amino acids were altered to Ala residues, manifested subunit specificity similar to that of con-G, suggesting that the replaced residues are not responsible for selectivity in the con-G framework. A sarcosine-containing con-T truncation analog, con-T[1–9/G1Src/Q6G], inhibited currents in NR1a/NR2A and NR1a/NR2B receptors, eliminating residues 10–21 as mediators of the broad subunit selectivity of con-T. In contrast to the null effects of con-G and Ala/con-G at a NR1a/NR2A-containing receptor, some inhibition (∼40%) of NMDA-evoked currents was effected by these peptides in cells expressing NR1b/NR2A. This finding suggests that the presence of exon 5 in NR1b plays a role in the activity of the conantokins. Analysis of various conantokin analogs demonstrated that Leu5 of con-G is an important determinant of conantokin selectivity. Taken as a whole, these results suggest that the important molecular determinants on conantokins responsible for NMDA receptor activity and specificity are discretely housed in specific residues of these peptides, thus allowing molecular manipulation of the NMDA receptor inhibitory properties of the conantokins.

N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor conantokin γ-carboxyglutamic acid (Gla) N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl The N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor (NMDAR)1 is a ligand-gated ion channel that participates in a number of neurophysiological processes including learning and memory, and it has been implicated in many neuropathological disorders, such as Alzheimer's disease, epilepsy, and ischemic cell death. The genes encoding the subunits that comprise the multimeric complex fall into two major families. The NR1 family consists of a single gene that yields eight different isoforms (NR1a–h) arising from alternative splicing (1Durand G.M. Gregor P. Zheng X. Bennett M.V. Uhl G.R. Zukin R.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 9359-9363Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar, 2Sugihara H. Moriyoshi K. Ishii T. Masu M. Nakanishi S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 185: 826-832Crossref PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar). The NR2 family consists of four separate genes, each encoding a separate protein (NR2A–D) (3Ishii T. Moriyoshi K. Sugihara H. Sakurada K. Kadotani H. Yokoi M. Akazawa C. Shigemoto R. Mizuno N. Masu M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2836-2843Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Further, a NR3 subunit, with at least two splice variants (NR3-l and NR3-s), has been identified (4Sun L.X. Margolis F.L. Shipley M.T. Lidow M.S. FEBS Lett. 1998; 441: 392-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). In mammalian systems, functional channels are formed upon the coassembly of NR1 and NR2 subunits (5Wafford K.A. Bain C.J. Le Bourdelles B. Whiting P.J. Kemp J.A. Neuroreport. 1993; 4: 1347-1349Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar) and require the coagonists glycine and glutamate for activation (6Jahr C.E. Stevens C.F. Nature. 1987; 325: 522-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar, 7Johnson J.W. Ascher P. Nature. 1987; 325: 529-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (2601) Google Scholar). NR1 and NR3-l expression is ubiquitous, whereas NR2 and NR3-s expression is developmentally and regionally specific (4Sun L.X. Margolis F.L. Shipley M.T. Lidow M.S. FEBS Lett. 1998; 441: 392-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 8Laurie D.J. Bartke I. Schoepfer R. Naujoks K. Seeburg P.H. Mol. Brain Res. 1997; 51: 23-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Hence, the particular subunit combinations that are present at certain times or locations govern a variety of pharmacological properties of the NMDAR (9Priestley T. Laughton P. Myers J. Le Bourdelles B. Kerby J. Whiting P.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 1995; 48: 841-848PubMed Google Scholar), such as the response to agonists, antagonists, and/or inhibitors. Conantokins are small (17–27 residues) neuroactive peptides derived from the venoms of marine snails of the genus Conus. The three major peptides in the conantokin family identified to date are conantokin (con)-G, con-T, and con-R. These peptides contain γ-carboxyglutamic acid (Gla) residues (10Haack J.A. Rivier J.

Recently, these peptides have gained therapeutic importance because of their ability to function as anticonvulsants (17White H.S. McCabe R.Y. Armstrong H. Donevan S.D. Cruz L.J. Abogadie F.C. Torres J. Rivier J.E. Paarmann I. Hollmann M. Olivera B.M. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2000; 292: 425-432PubMed Google Scholar) and as anti-Parkinsonian agents (18Adams A.C. Layer R.T. McCabe R.T. Keefe K.A. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 2000; 404: 303-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), and they have provided neuroprotection within therapeutically acceptable times in a rat model of transient focal brain ischemia (19Williams A.J. Dave J.R. Phillips J.B. Lin Y. McCabe R.T. Tortella F.C. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2000; 294: 378-386PubMed Google Scholar). Emerging evidence suggests that conantokins behave as subunit-selective NMDAR antagonists. A recent report demonstrated that when combined with NR1, con-R is selective for NR2A and NR2B, with minimal effects on NR2C and NR2D (17White H.S. McCabe R.Y. Armstrong H. Donevan S.D. Cruz L.J. Abogadie F.C. Torres J. Rivier J.E. Paarmann I. Hollmann M. Olivera B.M. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2000; 292: 425-432PubMed Google Scholar). Another study showed that con-G is selective for NR2B-containing receptors (20Donevan S.D. McCabe R.T. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 58: 614-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). No reports have been documented which reveal con-T subunit selectivity. Thus, despite the high degree of sequence and structural homology among the conantokins, diversity exists with respect to their action at the NMDAR, depending on receptor subunit composition. Because of this, we sought to explore further the ability of wild-type and variant conantokins to inhibit NDMA-evoked currents in cells transiently expressing various NMDAR subunit combinations. The results presented herein provide insights into the mechanism of conantokin-receptor interactions and the subunit specificity of these interactions. The amino acid sequences of the conantokins that were synthesized herein and used for the studies described in this report are provided below. Con-G: NH2-GEγγL5QγNQγ10LIRγK15SN-NH2.

Solid phase peptide synthesis was employed throughout using an Applied Biosystems (Foster City, CA) model 433A peptide synthesizer. All methods were as described previously (12Prorok M. Warder S.E. Blandl T. Castellino F.J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 16528-16534Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 14Blandl T. Warder S.E. Prorok M. Castellino F.J. FEBS Lett. 2000; 470: 139-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Fmoc strategy was used with the following side chain protecting groups:O-tBu for Asp, Gla, Glu, Ser, and Tyr; Trt for Asn, and Cys; Pmc for Arg; and Boc for Lys. Fmoc-derivatized Gla was synthesized as described previously (21Colpitts T.L. Castellino F.J. Int. J. Pept. Protein Res. 1993; 41: 567-575Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The peptides were synthesized as the peptide amides, using PAL resin (PerSeptive Biosystems, Framingham, MA). Peptides were deprotected and cleaved from the resin using trifluoroacetic acid/H2O/triisopropylsilane/dithiothreitol (44:2.5:1:2.5, v/v/v/w) for 3 h at room temperature. All peptides were purified further by FPLC anion exchange chromatography using Bioscale DEAE20 (Bio-Rad) resin. The materials were then desalted on a Sephadex G-15 column (1.5 × 100 cm), equilibrated, and eluted with 0.1% NH4OH. The peptides were characterized further by reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry as described (22Prorok M. Geng J.P. Warder S.E. Castellino F.J. Int. J. Pept. Protein Res. 1996; 48: 281-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). cDNAs encoding the rat NR1a, NR1b, NR2A, and NR2B receptors (subcloned into pRC/CMV or pRK5) were kindly provided by Dr. David R. Lynch (23Lynch D.R. Lawrence J.J. Lenz S. Anegawa N.J. Dichter M. Pritchett D.B. J. Neurochem. 1995; 64: 1462-1468Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Plasmid pEGFP-N1, encoding a red shifted variant of wild-type green fluorescent protein, was purchased from CLONTECH Laboratories, Inc (San Diego). HEK293 cells were transiently transfected using the calcium phosphate precipitation method (24Chen C. Okayama H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2745-2752Crossref PubMed Scopus (4799) Google Scholar). Briefly, the cells were grown to ∼50% confluence on 35-mm poly-d-lysine-coated dishes and transfected with combinations of NR1- and NR2-containing plasmids (5 µg of DNA/dish) along with pEGFP-N1 for identification of positive cells. Plasmid ratios for diheteromeric combinations were 1:1:3 for green fluorescent protein, NR1, and NR2, respectively, and 1:1.5:1.5 for cells coexpressing the NR1a, NR2A, and NR2B triheteromeric combination. Following transfection, the cells were maintained in fresh medium containing 500 µm ketamine to prevent NMDA-mediated cell death. Electrophysiological recordings were performed within 24–48 h post-transfection. Binding experiments were carried out using [3H]MK-801 (15–30 Ci/mmol) from NEN Life Science Products, with crude rat brain membranes (25Warder S.E. Prorok M. Chen Z.G. Li L.P. Zhu Y. Pedersen L.G. Ni F. Castellino F.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7512-7522Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Duplicate experiments consisting of triplicate determinations at each MK-801 concentration were conducted for each peptide. IC50 values for the inhibition of spermine-enhanced [3H]MK-801 binding were obtained from a logistic fit of the data. These values did not vary more than 15% between duplicate experiments. Electrophysiological patch clamp whole cell recordings were performed at room temperature (26Klein R.C. Galdzicki Z. Castellino F.J. Neuropharmacology. 1999; 38: 1819-1829Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Cells were bathed in extracellular solution consisting of 140 mm NaCl, 3 mm KCl, 2 mmCaCl2, 10 mm Na-Hepes, and 20 mmdextrose, pH 7.35. Glycine (10 µm) was also present to saturate the glycine site on the NMDAR. Recording pipettes, constructed from borosilicate glass (Drummond Scientific Co., Broomall, PA), with a resistance of 2–4 megohms, were back-filled with a solution containing 140 mm CsF, 1 mm CaCl2, 2 mm MgCl2, 10 mm EGTA, 10 mm Cs-Hepes, 2 mm tetraethylammonium chloride, and 4 mm Na2ATP, pH 7.35. Stock solutions of 100 mm NMDA and 100 mm glycine were prepared and kept frozen at −20 °C. The fresh working solutions were prepared daily. The application of agonist solutions was accomplished via a rapid solution changer equipped with a nine-barrel straight head (RSC-200, Biologic, Calix, France; Molecular Kinetics, Pullman, WA) positioned 200–300 µm from the cell under study. Data were obtained using an EPC-7 amplifier, filtered at 5 kHz (eight-pole Bessel filter, NPI; ALA Scientific Instruments, Inc., Westbury, NY), and acquired on a personal computer using pClamp software (Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA). Among individual transfected cells, current amplitudes ranging from 200 to 2,000 pA were observed. All responses in a particular cell were normalized to maximum current evoked in the absence of peptide. The determination of τon and τoff values for each peptide was accomplished by fitting the inhibition progress curve to both single and double exponentials. The appropriate model was selected on the basis of goodness of fit. Con-G, con-T, and con-R[1–17], the last a carboxyl-terminal truncated variant of con-R which retains wild-type activity (14Blandl T. Warder S.E. Prorok M. Castellino F.J. FEBS Lett. 2000; 470: 139-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), were assessed for their ability to inhibit NMDA-evoked currents in HEK293 cells expressing recombinant NMDAR subunits. Although IC50 values for conantokins determined in electrophysiological assays are in the range of 0.1–1 µm (17White H.S. McCabe R.Y. Armstrong H. Donevan S.D. Cruz L.J. Abogadie F.C. Torres J.

To achieve a more rapid inhibition, each of the various peptides (50 µm) was used to determine the rate of onset (τon), offset (τoff), and percentage of inhibition in cells expressing NR1a/NR2A or NR1a/NR2B. The values are summarized in Table I for results obtained at NR1a/NR2A receptors and in TableII for results obtained at NR1a/NR2B receptors. As illustrated in Fig. 1,A and B, con-T and con-R[1–17] inhibited NMDA-evoked currents (>95%) in receptors formed at both combinations of subunits. The con-T-based 9-mer, con-T[1–9/G1Src/Q6G], also inhibited at both subunit forms. On the other hand, con-G inhibited currents in cells expressing NR1a/NR2B but had little to no effect on cells expressing NR1a/NR2A. Similarly, the alanine-rich con-G analog, Ala/con-G, paralleled this subunit specificity. The time course for the onset of peptide inhibition (τon), of ∼5 s, as well as for offset of inhibition (τoff), of ∼2 min, was similar for all parent peptides at their active subunit combinations. These values correlate with results obtained using cultured neurons (26Klein R.C. Galdzicki Z. Castellino F.J. Neuropharmacology. 1999; 38: 1819-1829Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The Ala/con-G peptide manifested a τon similar to con-G. However, the con-T-based 9-mer inhibited 3-fold faster at both NR1a/2A and NR1a/2B combinations compared with con-T.Table IConantokin inhibition at recombinant NR1a/NR2A receptors expressed in HEK293 cellsPeptide1-aEach peptide was tested at a concentration of 50 µm in the presence of 100 µm NMDA and 10 µm glycine.

Open table in a new tab The three conantokins under investigation share a high degree of amino-terminal sequence homology, maintaining identity of the first four residues (GEγγ). The residue at position 5, which is essential for activity as determined by alanine replacement studies (27Blandl T. Prorok M. Castellino F.J. FEBS Lett. 1998; 435: 257-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 28Blandl T. Zajicek J. Prorok M. Castellino F.J. J. Biol.

Neurochem. 2001; 77: 812-822Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), is different in each species and is represented by a Tyr, Leu, and Val in con-T, con-G, and con-R, respectively. Variant conantokins containing conservative mutations at this position, in which a residue from one peptide was replaced by a residue native to another peptide, were tested to address the importance of this amino acid for activity and subunit specificity. The degree of inhibition as well as the τon and τoff values were determined using a single peptide concentration of 50 µm. The values for results obtained at NR1a/NR2A receptors and NR1a/NR2B receptors are summarized in Tables I and II, respectively. Con-T variants with Val, Phe, or Trp substitutions at sequence position 5 were reasonably well tolerated at receptors containing NR1a/NR2B subunits, whereas the Val and Trp derivatives were much less effective at NR1a/NR2A-containing receptors (Table I). Con-T[Y5L] was completely inactive at concentrations up to 100 µm in the [3H]MK-801 assay and, therefore, was not tested in this electrophysiological study. The most dramatic effects occurred in con-G by substituting Leu5 with a Tyr, the residue present at that location in con-T. This analog, in contrast to wild-type con-G, inhibited (70.6 ± 3.7%) currents in cells expressing NR1a/NR2A (Fig.2 A). Further, for this variant, it was observed that the data describing the rate of onset was best fit using a second order exponential. This resulted in fast (τfast = 0.48 ± 0.08 ms) and slow (τslow = 4.1 ± 0.9 s) components, where the slow component was comparable to wild-type con-T and con-R[1–17]. Con-G[L5Y] also inhibited at NR1a/NR2B-containing receptors (Fig.2 B); however, the degree of inhibition was lower than wild-type con-G (73.6 ± 6.6%), and the τoff was nearly 40-fold faster (∼3 s). Further replacement of Leu5in con-G with the closely related Ile or Val led to a retention of inhibitory activity in receptors composed of NR1a/NR2B (Fig. 2,lower) but had no inhibitory effect on NR1a/NR2A-containing receptors (Fig. 2 A). Replacement of Val in con-R[1–17] with a Tyr or Leu did not alter the extent of inhibition greatly (∼90%) at either subunit combination tested, whereas replacement with Ile slightly lowered (to ∼70%) this parameter. The τoff was significantly faster for con-R[1–17/V5I] (<10 s) than for the V5L (∼45 s) or V5Y (∼60 s) con-R variants. The extents of inhibition of these variants correlated with the potency determined in [3H]MK-801 assay, where V5Y ≥ wild-type > V5L > V5I. Exon 5 encodes a 21-amino acid insert in the extracellular N-terminal region of the NR1 subunit (residues 190–211). Alternative splicing of this exon (where NR1a denotes the absence of exon 5 and NR1b denotes the presence of exon 5) influences receptor sensitivity to modulators such as Zn2+, polyamines, and protons (30Traynelis S.F. Burgess M.F. Zheng F. Lyuboslavsky P. Powers J.L. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 6163-6175Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Because conantokins have been proposed to act allosterically at the polyamine site (15Skolnick P. Boje K. Miller R. Pennington M. Maccecchini M.-L. J. Neurochem. 1992; 59: 1516-1521Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), HEK293 cells were transfected with NR1b/NR2A and NR1b/NR2B to determine whether the inhibitory effects of the conantokins displayed any specificity for this splice variant. In contrast with their null effects at NR1a/NR2A recombinant receptors, con-G and Ala/con-G displayed some degree of inhibition (∼40%) at NR1b/NR2A-containing receptors (Fig.3) and completely inhibited NR1b/NR2B-containing receptors (TableIII). Insofar as the incomplete inhibition noted with con-G and Ala/con-G at the NR1b/NR2A receptor form may reflect either weak affinity or partial antagonism, the effect of 100 µm peptide was also examined. A higher degree of inhibition occurred (∼60%) for a 100 µm application of con-G and Ala/con-G (data not shown). This concentration response indicates weak affinity, not partial antagonism, at the NR1b/NR2A combination. Con-G[L5Y] also inhibited NMDA-evoked currents at NR1b/NR2A (∼73%) with properties similar to those observed at NR1a/NR2A; however, the L5V and L5I variants of con-G were inactive in this regard (Fig. 3). Con-T and con-R[1–17] completely inhibited NMDA-evoked currents in both of these subunit combinations (Table II). The τon of inhibition was faster by at least 2-fold for all wild-type peptides at NR1b- versus NR1a-containing receptor combinations. The τoff of inhibition was somewhat slower for all peptides at NR1b/NR2B receptors than NR1a/NR2B. All peptides tested at NR1b/NR2B receptors displayed apparentK d values of less than 1 µm. Although these values must be considered only a first approximation of the true binding constants, they demonstrate that conantokins have a 5–10-fold increase in affinity at receptors containing NR1b compared with those containing NR1a.Table IIIConantokin inhibition at recombinant NR1b containing receptors and NR1a/NR2A/NR2B expressed in HEK293 cellsPeptide3-aEach peptide was tested at a concentration of 50 µm in the presence of 100 µm NMDA and 10 µm glycine.

Invest. 1995; 96: 1943-1947Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), which encodes the liver-specific α1 subunit. In contrast to MAT α subunits, which are highly conserved throughout evolution, the β subunit of MAT II seems to be only present in the mammalian species (15Kotb M. Kredich N.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3923-3930Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Mitsui K. Teraoka H. Tsukada K. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 11211-11216Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, we cloned and characterized the human MAT II β subunit (26Halim A.-B. LeGros H.L. Geller A. Kotb M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29720-29725Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 31LeGros H.L. Halim A.-B. Geller A. Kotb M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2359-2366Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), found that it has no catalytic activity, and confirmed that it acts as a regulatory subunit for the enzyme. When β associates with the α subunit it alters its kinetic properties and renders MAT II more susceptible to product inhibition by AdoMet (26Halim A.-B. LeGros H.L. Geller A. Kotb M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29720-29725Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 31LeGros H.L. Halim A.-B. Geller A. Kotb M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2359-2366Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the human β subunit can also interact with the α1 subunit of MAT I/III and the Escherichia coliα MAT subunit and alter their kinetic properties as well (26Halim A.-B. LeGros H.L. Geller A. Kotb M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29720-29725Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar,31LeGros H.L. Halim A.-B. Geller A. Kotb M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2359-2366Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The expression of the MAT II α2, α2′, and β subunits varies considerably in different tissues. The α2, α2′, and β subunits are constitutively expressed at high levels in leukemic cells and at low levels in normal resting T cells. Stimulation of normal human lymphocytes results in marked changes in the level of expression of these subunits. Nonphysiological polyclonal mitogenic stimulation of human T cells induces an increased expression of the α2/α2′ subunits but not the β subunits (22De La Rosa J. LeGros Jr., H.L. Geller A.M. Kotb M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 10699-10704Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25LeGros Jr., H.L. Geller A.M. Kotb M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16040-16047Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). By contrast, physiological stimulation of T cells by bacterial superantigens induces an up-regulation of the α2/α2′ subunits and a down-regulation of the β subunit (25LeGros Jr., H.L. Geller A.M. Kotb M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16040-16047Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). This results in the formation of α2 and α2′ homo- and/or hetero-oligomers (no β) with a 3-fold higherK m for l-Met. The form of MAT II without β is resistant to product inhibition by AdoMet when compared with the form of MAT II found in resting or leukemic T cells (includes β) (25LeGros Jr., H.L. Geller A.M. Kotb M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16040-16047Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Importantly, the down-regulation of the β subunit in physiologically stimulated T cells was accompanied by a 6–10-fold increase in intracellular AdoMet levels, presumably caused by the loss of product inhibition of the enzyme (25LeGros Jr., H.L. Geller A.M. Kotb M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16040-16047Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). An increase in AdoMet levels is likely to stimulate certain transmethylation reactions catalyzed by methyltransferases with a relatively high K m value for AdoMet. Based on our previous results, we hypothesized that the down-regulation of the MAT II β subunit may be an important event in the physiological stimulation of T cells, and we sought to characterize the regulation of expression of the MAT2B gene. Here we report the chromosomal localization and organization of the MAT2Bgene and provide a detailed characterization of the structure and function of its promoter. Based on the sequence of the previously reported MAT II β subunit cDNA (31LeGros H.L. Halim A.-B. Geller A. Kotb M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2359-2366Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), forward and reverse primers spanning the entire open reading frame were designed and used to amplify genomic DNA isolated from normal human lymphocytes. Reactions yielding larger than expected products suggested the presence of introns, and these PCR products were cloned and sequenced to verify the authenticity of introns. Sequences at the intron-exon boundaries of the MAT2B gene were determined by aligning the cDNA sequence of MAT2BcDNA with the genomic sequence. A set of primers, GSF (5′-GATTCCTGAGTCCTGTCTTAG) and GSR (5′-GCACTTTTGGCTTTCACTCAG), that amplified a 79-bp product that included the 3′ end of intron 4 and the 5′ end of exon 5 were used to screen a human P1 genomic library (Genome Systems, Inc., St. Louis, MO). Positive clones were partially sequenced to ascertain the presence of the MAT2B gene. Clone 22646 was selected for further characterization and used to determine the chromosomal location of the MAT2B gene, determine gene organization, verify intron positions, and characterizeMAT2B promoter function. Highly purified DNA was obtained from the MAT2BP1 genomic clone 22646 using the Wizard PureFection DNA purification system (Promega, Madison, WI). The DNA was labeled with digoxigenin dUTP by nick translation combined with sheared human DNA and hybridized to normal metaphase chromosomes derived from phytohemagglutinin-stimulated peripheral blood lymphocytes in a solution containing 50% formamide, 10% dextran sulfate, and 2× SSC. Specific hybridization signals were detected by using fluorescein-conjugated antidigoxigenin antibodies. The chromosomes were counterstained with propidium iodide and analyzed. Identification of the transcription start site was done by primer extension analysis using poly(A)+ RNA prepared from normal human lymphocytes. The primer extension reaction was conducted using the avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase primer extension system (Promega). Poly(A)+ RNA was isolated from 500 ml of human blood by the Poly(A)Tract mRNA isolation system (Promega). Two primers, Bra1 5′-GTTCTTTCTCCCTCCCCACCAT-3′ (complementary to positions +22–+1 of the open reading frame) and Bra2 5′-CAGTTCTTTCTCCCTCCCCACC-3′ (complementary to positions +24–+3 of the open reading frame), were synthesized and end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase. Free [γ-32P]ATP was removed by the QIAquick nucleotide removal kit (Qiagen). Reverse primer extension was carried out using 3 μg of mRNA and 5 × 105 cpm of the labeled primer. The M13mp18 sequencing ladder was prepared byfmol sequencing (Promega) and run alongside the samples on 8% urea/polyacrylamide gels as a size marker. We cloned and sequenced 3.5 kbp of the 5′-flanking DNA of the human MAT2Bgene. The promoter was contained within 1.1 kbp. The primers 5′-WP (5′-GCTCGAGTAAGATGATCTTGGC) and 3′-WP (5′-GAAGCTTGCCCGCCGTCTTCAC) were designed to amplify the region −998/+204 with respect to the transcription start site. The primers introduced an XhoI site at the 5′ end and aHindIII site at the 3′ end of the cloned promoter. ThePfu-amplified fragment was cloned into the pGEM-TEasy vector (Promega), and the cloned MAT2B promoter was sequenced in both directions with overlapping segments to verify the sequence and confirm the integrity of the cloned promoter. The cloned promoter DNA was excised from the pGEM-TEasy vector by digestion withXhoI and HindIII (Promega), purified, and processed as described below. A 1.1-kbp XhoI/HindIII-digested fragment of the MAT2B gene containing the 5′-flanking region starting at position +204 from the transcription start site was cloned upstream of the firefly luciferase reporter gene in the pGL3-Enhancer vector (Promega). Directional insertion was verified by restriction digestion and by sequencing the clone from both directions. Subsequent deletion constructs were generated by PCR using sequence-specific primers (Table I) containing the restriction sites XhoI/HindIII as described above. The purified PCR products were cloned into the pGEM-TEasy vector (Promega) and sequenced for verification. The cloned deletion constructs were excised from the pGEM-TEasy vector usingXhoI/HindIII and then cloned upstream from the firefly luciferase gene into the pGL3-Enhancer vector (Promega). All constructs were verified by sequence analysis.Table ISequence of primers used for MAT2B promoter constructsNamePrimer (5′-3′)Position5′WPACTCGAGCTGCTTAGTCTTTAGTTT−9983′WPGAAGCTTGCCCGCCGTCTTCAC+2045′BP1ACTCGAGTGCCAGGGTTTACTTTCT−8265′BP2GCTCGAGTGGGCTTGATTCTGGTTA−5965′BP3TCTCGAGTTCATCTTCCTTCCCCTAC−4845′BP4ACTCGAGACGCCAACCCTTTTAT−3635′BP5TCTCGAGCTTTTTATTCCACTTTTTAT−2375′BP6ACTCGAGAAACTCAAGGCGATCCACTT−1743′BP6TCTGCCCCCAGCCCAG−25′BP7ACTCGAGAATAAAAAGCACTCAAATAAAATCTCC−1155′BP8CCTCGAGACCGCGCGTACC−43′BP8GTTGATTGGCCACGCTCC+515′BP9ACTCGAGGGCGCGGCTATGGCAG+525′BP10TCTCGAGTCGTTCTGGGCCTAGGG+935′BP11ACTCGAGGGTTGGAGGAGGTGGCG+154 Open table in a new tab The functional expression of the pGL3-MAT2B promoter deletion constructs was analyzed in Cos-1 and Jurkat T cells as detailed elsewhere (27Halim A.-B. LeGros L. Geller A. Kotb M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 9784-9791Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Double-stranded oligonucleotide probes were generated by PCR amplification with 32P end-labeled primers. The amplified DNA representing specific regions of the proximal promoter of the MAT2B gene was generated using the primers listed in Table I. Jurkat cell nuclear extracts were prepared as described previously (27Halim A.-B. LeGros L. Geller A. Kotb M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 9784-9791Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The binding reactions were performed in a 20-μl final volume by incubating 60 fmol (∼50,000 cpm) of32P-labeled probe with 5 μg of crude nuclear extracts from Jurkat cells in the presence of 2 μg of poly(dI-dC), 1 μg of salmon sperm DNA in 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 50 mmKCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, and 6 μg of bovine serum albumin for 40 min on ice. The reactions were conducted in the absence or presence of specific or nonspecific competitors, both added at a 100-fold molar excess. Specific competitors were cold probes; nonspecific competitors were unlabeled PCR amplification products of an unrelated DNA sequence, free of sites of interest, and similar in size to specific competitor. An Sp1-specific competitor was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (catalog no. SC 2502). The DNA·protein complexes formed were analyzed by electrophoresis on nondenaturing 4% polyacrylamide gels. The gels were pre-run for 1 h at 100 V, and electrophoresis was conducted at a 30-mAmp constant current. Supershift assays were performed using antibodies (Abs) to specific factors that have corresponding recognition elements within theMAT2B promoter region analyzed. Binding reactions were carried out as described above in the absence or presence of 2 μg of an Ab specific to one of the transcription factors of interest. The Ab was premixed with the nuclear extract, incubated for 30 min at room temperature prior to the addition of radiolabeled probe, or added after the binding reaction was completed and incubated for 30 min on ice. The following Abs (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) were used in supershift analyses: rabbit polyclonal anti-Sp1 (catalog no. SC-59X), anti-Sp2 (catalog no. SC-643X), anti-Sp3 (catalog no. SC-644X), anti-Sp4 (catalog no. SC-645X), and anti-NF1 monoclonal Ab (catalog no. SC-870X). Cross-linking between transcription factors and chromatin was achieved in Jurkat cells by following the method described by Yang et al. (32Yang Y. Hwang C.K. Junn E. Lee G. Mouradian M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38863-38869Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Briefly, formaldehyde was added to cells at a final concentration of 1% for 10 min, and 0.125 m glycine was used to stop the reaction. The cells were washed three times with cold PBS and once with PBS containing 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and then lysed in 2 ml of cell lysis buffer (5 mm Pipes-KOH, pH 8.0, 85 mm KCl, and 0.5% (v/v) Nonidet P-40) in the presence of protease inhibitors (100 ng/ml leupeptin, 100 ng/ml aprotinin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). The lysates were homogenized, and the nuclei were recovered by centrifugation at 250 × g for 10 min and resuspended in 0.2 ml of nuclear lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 10 mmEDTA, 1% (w/v) SDS plus the protease inhibitors. The lysate was sonicated to shear the chromatin to an average length of <2 kb. The samples were diluted 10-fold with the immunoprecipitation dilution buffer (1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 16.7 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 1.2 mm EDTA, and 167 mm NaCl plus the protease inhibitors). A 240-μl slurry of salmon sperm DNA/protein A-agarose (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., Lake Placid, NY) was added to reduce nonspecific binding, and the mixture was rotated for 1 h at 4 °C then centrifuged at 500 × g for 1 min. Precleared chromatin solutions were incubated with antibody to Sp1 (10 μg), Sp3 (10 μg) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) or no antibody (negative control) and rotated at 4 °C for 12 h. Immune complexes were collected by adding 80 μl of salmon sperm DNA/protein A-agarose slurry for 4 h with rotation. Samples were washed four times with 1 ml of wash buffer (0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, and 2 mm EDTA), and the immunoprecipitated material was eluted by three successive 5-min incubations with 150 μl of elution buffer (1% (w/v) SDS and 50 mm NaHCO3). To reverse the formaldehyde-induced cross-linking, the eluates were pooled, NaCl was added at a final concentration of 0.3 m, and the samples were incubated at 65 °C for 4 h. This step was followed by digestion in 10 μl of 2 m Tris, pH 6.8, 10 μl of 0.5m EDTA, and 2 μl of proteinase K (20 mg/ml). The samples were incubated for 2 h at 45 °C, and then the DNA was extracted with phenol/CHCl3 followed by ethanol precipitation and resuspension in 50 μl of sterile H2O. Five μl of DNA solution were used as a template in PCR analysis. Primers were designed to amplify the regions from −174 or −4 to + 52. The primer 5′-BP8 (5′-ACTCGAGAAACTCAAGGCGATCCACTT) or 5′-BP9 (5′-CCTCGAGACCGCGCGTACC) was paired with primer 3′-BP8 (5′-TCTGCCCCCAGCCCACG). The PCR products were separated on 1.5% agarose gel and visualized by ethidium bromide staining. Several mutations were introduced into the clones pGL3-MAT2B(−174)-LUC, pGL3-MAT2B(−115)-LUC, and pGL3-MAT2B(−4)-LUC according to a modification of the method of Wang and Wilkinson (33Wang J. Wilkinson M.F. BioTechniques. 2000; 29: 976-978Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) that targets putative factor recognition sites. Mutation of the TBF site at −111/−105 was generated using the primers 5′-MU1 (5′-GCTCGAGAATAACAAGCACTCAAATAAAATCTCC) and 3′-MU1 (5′-GAGATTTTATTTGAGTGCTTGTTATTCTCGAGCC). Another possible TBF site at −95/−91 was mutated using the primers 5′-MU2 (5′-GCACTCAAATACCATCTCCGAAACAAAACCTG) and 3′-MU2 (5′-CAGGTTTTGTTTCGGAGATGGTATTTGAGTGC). The TATA box at −32/−28 was mutated with oligos 5′-MU3 (5′-CTTTTGTGTGTCGCTTTTTGCATCGGCGCGTG) and 3′-MU3 (5′-CACGCGCCGATGCAAAAAGCGACACACAAAAG). Mutation of the Sp1 site at position +9/+15 was generated with the primers 5′-MU2 (5′-CAGACCGCGCGTACCTTACCTCTTTCTGG) and 3′-MU2 (5′-CCAGAAAGAGGTAAGGTACGCGCGGTCTG). The second Sp1 site at +23/+28 was mutated using the primers 5′-MU5 (5′-CCTCTTTCTGGGTTTTCGGCGGAGCGTGGC) and 3′-MU5 (5′-GCCACGCTCCGCCGAAAACCCAGAAAGAGG). Site-directed mutagenesis was performed on pGL3-MAT2Bpromoter constructs by PCR using Pfu turbo DNA polymerase (Stratagene) and the oligos listed above following the method of Wang and Wilkinson (33Wang J. Wilkinson M.F. BioTechniques. 2000; 29: 976-978Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Briefly, after the PCR reaction the product was incubated at 37 °C with DpnI (Promega) to remove the methylated template DNA. A portion of the digested reaction mix was analyzed on a 1% agarose gel to verify the PCR product size. E. coli strain JM109 was transformed using 5 μl of the PCR-amplified vector, and six clones of each transformation were sequenced to confirm the presence of the desired mutations. The mutated DNA products were excised from the pGL3 vector using XhoI and HindIII and individually recloned into an unamplified pGL3-Enhancer vector (Promega) to ensure that the vector itself was not modified during the mutagenesis reaction. The in vitro andin vivo activity of each mutant construct was determined as described above. EMSA probes −115/−4 and −4/+52 were generated by using the mutated pGL3-MAT2B (115)-LUC clones as templates and external primers 3′-BP8 (5′-TCTGCCCCCAGCCCACG) and 3′-BP9 (5′-GTTGATTGGCCACGCTCC). Results from only those mutations that affected promoter activity are described below. Human genomic clone 22646 was determined to harbor the MAT2B gene and a significant portion of its 5′-flanking sequence. A series of primers were designed, based on the known MAT2B cDNA sequence, to determine the structure of the MAT2B gene. The gene consisted of seven exons interrupted by six introns spanning ∼6.8 kbp of genomic DNA (Fig. 1). The sizes and locations of the various exons and introns as well as the donor and acceptor sequence are summarized in the inset table. All boundaries were found to conform to the GT-AG rule (34Breathnach R. Chambon P. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1981; 50: 349-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (3297) Google Scholar). Exon 1 contained 203 bp of 5′-noncoding region and 63 bp of coding sequence. Exon 7 contained 171 bp of coding sequence and 802 bp of 3′-untranslated sequence. A total of 80 metaphase cells was analyzed as detailed under “Materials and Methods”; 69 of those exhibited specific labeling with DNA from clone 22646 on chromosome 5. An anonymous genomic probe, previously mapped to 5q22 and confirmed by cohybridization with a probe from the cri du chat locus, hybridized to the same chromosome as clone 22646, confirming the location as the long arm of chromosome 5. Ten individual measurements of specifically labeled chromosome 5 demonstrated that the 22646 clone hybridized to a position 89% of the distance from the centromere to the telomere of 5q, an area that corresponded to the interface between bands 5q34 and 5q35.1 (data not shown). The transcription start site was identified by primer extension analysis. Two primers, Bra1 and Bra2, corresponding to +22 and +24 of theMAT2B open reading frame were annealed to mRNA prepared from normal human lymphocytes and extended in the presence of avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase as described under “Materials and Methods.” The primer Bra2 yielded a 227-bp product, and Bra1 yielded a 225-bp product (Fig.2). Therefore, transcription was shown to start 203 bp upstream of the MAT2B translation start site. The sequence of ∼1.1 kbp of the 5′-flanking region of theMAT2B gene is shown in Fig. 3.

The amino acid sequence of GCS was reported to be dissimilar from other proteins, with no identifiable functional domains. We previously identified His-193 of rat GCS as an important residue in UDP-Glc and GCS inhibitor binding; however, little else is known about the GCS active site. Here, we identify key residues of the GCS active site by performing biochemical and site-directed mutagenesis studies of rat GCS expressed in bacteria. First, we found that Cys-207 was the primary residue involved in GCS N-ethylmaleimide sensitivity. Next, we showed by multiple alignment that the region of GCS flanking His-193 and Cys-207 (amino acids 89–278) contains a D1,D2,D3,(Q/R)XXRW motif found in the putative active site of processive β-glycosyltransferases (e.g.cellulose, chitin, and hyaluronan synthases). Site-directed mutagenesis studies demonstrated that most of the highly conserved residues were essential for GCS activity. We also note that GCS and processive β-glycosyltransferases are topologically similar, possessing cytosolic active sites, with putative transmembrane domains immediately N-terminal to the conserved domain. These results provide the first extensive information on the GCS active site and show that GCS and processive β-glycosyltransferases possess a conserved substrate-binding/catalytic domain.

Another GCS inhibitor,N-butyldeoxynojirimycin, is orally effective and has been shown to decrease glycosphingolipid accumulation in Tay-Sachs and Sandhoff disease mice and in a clinical trial of humans with Gaucher's disease (10Jeyakumar M. Butters R.D. Cortina-Borja M. Hunnam V. Proia R.L. Perry V.H. Dwek R.A. Platt F.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 6388-6393Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar, 11Platt F. Neises G.

However, this inhibitor is not fully specific (it inhibits α-glycosidase I and II as well as GCS) and is a much less effective inhibitor of GCS in vitro than the PDMP class of compounds (4Tifft C.

New analogs of both classes of GCS inhibitor have been prepared and are being evaluated as to their effectiveness and pharmaceutical properties (14Lee L. Abe A. Shayman J.A. J. Biol.

The development of further GCS inhibitors with desirable pharmaceutical properties may have great potential therapeutic usefulness. However, the design of new inhibitors is hampered by a lack of knowledge concerning the GCS active site and catalytic mechanism. The predicted amino acid sequences of cloned human, rat, and mouse GCSs were reported to have no significant homology with other proteins, including other glycosyltransferases (17Ichikawa S. Hirabayashi Y. Trends Cell Biol. 1998; 8: 198-202Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar, 18Ichikawa S. Sakiyama H. Suzuki G. Hidari K.I.-P.J. Hirabayashi Y. Proc. Natl.

J. 1999; 341: 395-400Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A recent classification of glycosyltransferases into different families based on sequence homology places mammalian GCS (>95% identical between rats, mice, and humans) in its own glycosyltransferasefamily (GTF21) along with putative homologs (51% identity with an open reading frame from Drosophila, ∼40% identity with three sequences from Caenorhabditis elegans, and 28% identity with a protein from the blue green bacteriaSynechocystis) from the GenBankTM Data Bank (20Campbell J. Davies G. Bulone V. Henrissat B. Biochem. J. 1998; 329: 929-939Crossref Scopus (52) Google Scholar). 2D. L. Marks, M. Dominguez, K. Wu, and R. E. Pagano, unpublished data. No recognizable domains or protein motifs have been identified within the GCS sequence, with the exception of a predicted single membrane-spanning region near its N terminus (17Ichikawa S. Hirabayashi Y. Trends Cell Biol. 1998; 8: 198-202Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar, 18Ichikawa S. Sakiyama H. Suzuki G. Hidari K.I.-P.J. Hirabayashi Y. Proc. Natl.

J. 1999; 341: 395-400Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Using antibodies directed against specific regions of GCS, we recently showed that the carboxyl tail and a hydrophilic loop near the putative membrane-spanning domain of GCS are accessible to the cytosol (21Marks D.L. Wu K. Paul P. Kamisaka Y. Watanabe R. Pagano R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 451-456Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), consistent with earlier reports by us and others that GCS possesses a cytosolically oriented active site on the Golgi membrane (22Coste H. Martel M.-B. Got R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 858: 6-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 23Jeckel D. Karrenbauer A. Burger K.N.J. van Meer G. Wieland F. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 117: 259-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar, 24Futerman A.H. Pagano R.E. Biochem. J. 1991; 280: 295-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). We also demonstrated that His-193 of rat GCS resides within or near the UDP-Glc-binding region of the protein and that rat GCS H193A and H193N mutant proteins were resistant to PDMP, suggesting that this region is involved in binding to GCS inhibitors (19Wu K. Marks D. Watanabe R. Paul P. Rajan N. Pagano R. Biochem. J. 1999; 341: 395-400Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Other than these few features, nothing is known about the domain structure or active site of GCS. Here, we conducted a series of biochemical and site-directed mutagenesis studies on rat GCS expressed in bacteria. We identified a sequence motif that is highly conserved in GCS and numerous processive β-glycosyltransferases (e.g. cellulose and chitin synthases), classified in glycosyltransferase family 2 (GTF2) (20Campbell J. Davies G. Bulone V. Henrissat B. Biochem. J. 1998; 329: 929-939Crossref Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Mutagenesis of conserved residues within this motif showed that most of these amino acids are critical for GCS activity and suggest that GCS and processive β-glycosyltransferases share a common catalytic mechanism. The coding sequence for rat GCS was inserted in the pET-3d vector as described previously (19Wu K. Marks D. Watanabe R. Paul P. Rajan N. Pagano R. Biochem. J. 1999; 341: 395-400Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Mutagenesis of GCS to alter individual residues to other amino acids was performed by polymerase chain reaction of GCS in the pET-3d vector using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The polymerase chain reaction products were transformed into Epicurian Coli XL1-Blue supercompetent cells (Stratagene) and then sequenced utilizing ABI Prism BigDye Terminator chemistry and an ABI Prism 377 sequencer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) to verify that they contained the expected mutations BL21-DE3 bacteria were transformed with wild type and mutant GCS inserts in the pET-3d vector. Transformed cells were incubated with shaking at 37 °C in 2 ml of Luria broth (LB) medium containing carbenicillin (50 µg/ml) until anA 600 of 0.6 was reached and then stored at 4 °C overnight. The bacteria were then pelleted, resuspended in 40 ml of LB medium with carbenicillin (50 µg/ml), and incubated with shaking at 37 °C until an A 600 of ∼0.5 was reached. GCS protein expression was then induced with 1 mmisopropyl-β-thiogalactopyranoside. After further incubation for 1 h at 30 °C, bacterial cell pellets were harvested by centrifugation. Bacterial pellets were then resuspended in GCS stabilizing buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 100 mmKCl, 20% glycerol, plus protease inhibitors (10 µg/ml each tosylarginylmethyl ester and leupeptin, 1 µg/ml each antipain and pepstatin, 25 µm 4-amidophenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride; all from Sigma)), aliquoted, flash-frozen in liquid N2, and stored at −70 °C until use. Aliquots of bacterial pellets (from 10 ml of bacterial culture) in which wild type and mutant GCS were expressed were thawed, diluted to 0.5 ml in GCS stabilizing buffer, and lysed by probe sonication (three times for 8 s each) on ice. The GCS activity of bacterial lysates (10–100 µl) was measured using 10 µm N-[7-(4-nitrobenzo-2-oxa-1,3-diazole)]-6-aminocaproyl-d-erythro-sphingosine (C6-NBD-labeled ceramide) (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) and 2.5 mm UDP-Glc (Sigma) in GCS assay buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 25 mm KCl, 5 mmMnCl2) for 30 min at 37 °C, followed by lipid extraction and thin layer chromatography as previously described (25Paul P. Kamisaka Y. Marks D.L. Pagano R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2287-2293Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Quantities of C6-NBD-glucosylceramide formed were measured by image analysis of TLC plates using NIH Image. The specific activity of wild type GCS activity was estimated using standard curves with known concentrations of C6-NBD-glucosylceramide (Molecular Probes) on TLC plates. For comparison of mutant and wild type proteins, GCS activity was expressed as a percent of wild type activity and normalized for protein expression (relative enzyme mass) assessed by Western blotting of wild type and mutant GCS proteins. For Western blotting, aliquots of GCS proteins in bacterial lysates were solubilized in SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis sample buffer without reducing agents or urea, run on 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis gels, and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes overnight in transfer buffer with 20% methanol (21Marks D.L. Wu K. Paul P. Kamisaka Y. Watanabe R. Pagano R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 451-456Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 26Marks D.L. Paul P. Kamisaka Y. Pagano R.E. Methods Enzymol. 1999; 311: 50-59Crossref Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Blots were probed with polyclonal anti-peptide antibodies (GCS-5, which recognizes a region near the GCS N terminus (amino acids 57–78) and GCS-1, which recognizes the GCS C terminus (amino acids 372–394)) followed by a goat anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase secondary antibody (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and visualized using Renaissance chemiluminescence reagent plus (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). For quantitation of relative enzyme mass, the levels of intact GCS (as detected by the GCS-1 antibody) were measured by densitometry of films using NIH image. Enzyme mass levels of mutant GCS proteins were expressed as a percent of wild type GCS protein mass measured on the same blot. Recombinant rat GCS lacking even 10 amino acids at the N terminus or 8 at the C terminus possessed less than 4% of wild type activity. 3K. Wu, D. L. Marks, and R. E. Pagano, unpublished results. Thus, it was reasonable to quantify only intact GCS for enzyme activity studies. Only one mutant protein (C384A) was altered within the region recognized by one of our antibodies (GCS-1). However, this mutation apparently did not affect the ability of the antibody to interact with this protein, because blotting results were the same when either the GCS-1 or the GCS-5 antibody was used. For studies of N-ethyl maleimide (NEM) inhibition of GCS activity, samples were preincubated with or without 4 mmUDP-Glc in a final volume of 98 µl of GCS stabilizing buffer for 20 min at room temperature. NEM (Sigma) was prepared fresh as a stock solution (1 m) in 100% ethanol. Dilutions of NEM in distilled water were prepared, and 2-µl aliquots were then added to GCS samples to acheive the desired range of final NEM concentrations. Samples were vortexed and then incubated for an additional 10 min at room temperature. Finally, 400 µl of GCS assay buffer containing 4 mm dithiothreitol, 4 mm UDP-Glc, and 5 nmol of C6-NBD-ceramide was added, and then samples were incubated for 20 min at 37 °C. GCS activity was measured as described above. Initial pairwise comparison of GCS with other proteins in the GenBankTM Data Bank were performed using the NCI BLAST program (27Altschul S. Madden T. Schäffer A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (60216) Google Scholar). Further multiple alignments between GCS and other sequences were performed using the CLUSTALW, Blockmaker, and PIMA Multiple Sequence Alignment programs on the BCM Search Launcher, followed by manual adjustments. Confirmation of the significance of multiple alignments was performed by Smith-Waterman analysis (28Smith T.F. Waterman M.S. J. Mol. Biol. 1981; 147: 195-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (7198) Google Scholar, 29Pearson W. Lipman D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 2444-2448Crossref PubMed Scopus (9393) Google Scholar). Kyte/Doolittle and Argos algorithms for prediction of protein hydrophobicity and transmembrane domains were performed using McVectorTMv6.5 (Pharmacopeia, Princeton, NJ). Additional transmembrane predictions were performed using the TMpred program on the Swiss Institute for Experimental Cancer Research server (Epalinges, Switzerland). Preliminary experiments had shown that NEM and other cysteine-specific reagents inhibit GCS in human skin fibroblasts and rat liver Golgi fractions. 4D. L. Marks and R. E. Pagano, unpublished results.Thus, we investigated the NEM sensitivity of GCS expressed in bacteria as a possible probe for the identification of important cysteine residues within this protein. The enzymatic activity of rat GCS expressed in bacteria was inhibited ∼80% by exposure to 0.4 mm NEM for 10 min at room temperature (Fig.1). Inhibition of GCS by NEM was dose- (Fig. 1) and time-dependent (data not shown). Preincubation of GCS with 4 mm UDP-Glc only partially protected against NEM inhibition, with protection of ∼20% (relative to control activity) against 0.25 mm NEM and less protection at higher doses (data not shown). We next prepared GCS mutant proteins in which the 11 cysteines in GCS were individually mutated to alanine (a double mutant, C321A,C323A, was also prepared) to determine which cysteines were the targets of NEM. Each mutant was expressed at significant levels in bacteria, as assessed by Western blotting (Table I). We tested the GCS activity of each mutant with or without 0.5 mm NEM. Each Cys → Ala mutant possessed a significant level of GCS activity, ranging from 25 to 150% of wild type activity (Table I). All mutant proteins were inhibited ≥80% by treatment with 0.5 mm NEM, similar to wild type GCS, except for the C207A mutant, which was inhibited only 15% (Table I). These results suggest that Cys-207 is the primary residue involved in inactivation of GCS by NEM. Of possible significance is the proximity of Cys-207 to His-193, which we previously demonstrated to be within or near the UDP-Glc-binding region of GCS (19Wu K. Marks D. Watanabe R. Paul P. Rajan N. Pagano R. Biochem. J. 1999; 341: 395-400Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). At higher concentrations of NEM, the C207A mutant showed significant dose-dependent inhibition, although much less than the wild type protein (Fig. 1). These data suggest that at high concentrations of NEM, other cysteines within GCS besides Cys-207 are alkylated by NEM.Table IGCS activity of Cys → Ala mutant proteinsGCS protein expressedRelative protein mass1-aRelative protein mass was measured by quantitation of Western blots with anti-GCS antibodies.

We next began to look critically at the region around Cys-207 and His-193 of GCS for further clues to the substrate binding sites and catalytic mechanism of this enzyme. BLAST searches with rat GCS identified a number of proteins with very limited homology with GCS in this region (data not shown). Of greatest interest, several of these proteins were known glycosyltransferases (e.g. cellulose, chitin, and hyaluronan synthases). These proteins were all found to be classified as processive β-glycosyltransferases in GTF2 according to the amino acid sequence-based classification of Campbell et al. (20Campbell J. Davies G. Bulone V. Henrissat B. Biochem. J. 1998; 329: 929-939Crossref Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Further computer-generated and visual multiple alignment of GCS (rat and Drosophila) with representative GTF2 proteins demonstrated the presence of a highly conserved set of residues between GCS and these enzymes within an ∼200-amino acid region of each protein (referred to as the GTF2 domain, Fig.2 A and TableII). Pair-wise global alignment demonstrated only 18–25% identity between rat GCS and the GTF2 proteins within the regions shown in Fig. 2 A; however, 12 residues were entirely conserved (identical or strongly similar residues; shown in yellow) in all eight proteins, and certain other amino acids were also ≥50% conserved between GCS and GTF2 proteins (shown in gray). The significance (p < 0.05) of the alignments of the fragments shown in Fig. 2 A with the rat GCS fragment was further confirmed by Smith-Waterman analysis (28Smith T.F. Waterman M.S. J. Mol. Biol. 1981; 147: 195-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (7198) Google Scholar, 29Pearson W. Lipman D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 2444-2448Crossref PubMed Scopus (9393) Google Scholar). In addition to the proteins shown, the same motif of conserved residues was found in all known GCS homologs, other cellulose, chitin, and hyaluron synthases, rhizobial NODC proteins, and numerous uncharacterized bacterial andArabidopsis sequences in the GenBankTM Data Bank (data not shown).Table IICharacteristics of representative proteins that contain the glycosyltransferase family 2 (GTF2) domainSpecies and protein acronym (accession no.)Protein/functionNucleotide donorProtein size (amino acids)Region of GTF2 domain (amino acids)2-aNumbers indicate the amino acid regions of each protein that are aligned in Figure 2 and that contain the GTF2 domain.Rat GCS (AFO47707)glucosylceramide synthaseUDP-Glc39489–278Drosophila melanogastor GCS (AAF46795)putative glucosylceramide synthase2-bThis open reading frame is characterized as a glucosylceramide synthase that utilizes UDP-Glc based on 50% identity with mammalian GCS, but its activity has not been tested.UDP-Glc2-bThis open reading frame is characterized as a glucosylceramide synthase that utilizes UDP-Glc based on 50% identity with mammalian GCS, but its activity has not been tested.44091–283Bradyrhizobium japonicum NdvB (AF047687)β-(1–3) glucosyltransferaseUDP-Glc920456–645Streptococcus pneumoniae tts (CAB51329)polysaccharide synthase β-(1–2), β-(1–3)UDP-Glc509130–319Dictyostelium discoideum csA (AAF00200)cellulose synthase β-(1–4)UDP-Glc1059561–760Arabidopsis thaliana pGT (AAD15482)putative glucosyltransferase?699277–475Glomus versiforme chs IV (CAA08762) AJ009630class IV chitin synthase β-(1–4)UDP-GlcNAc1194824–1038Mouse HAS 3 (NP 032243)hyaluronan synthase β-(1–3), β-(1–4)UDP-GlcUA428158–360UDP-GlcNAcAll protein information is from the GenBank™ Data Bank entries and related publications (31Blanton R.L.

https://openalex.org/W2155628721,"FKBP12 is a ubiquitous and a highly conserved prolyl isomerase that binds the immunosuppressive drugs FK506 and rapamycin. Members of the FKBP12 family have been implicated in many processes that include intracellular protein folding, transport, and assembly. In the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae and in human T cells, rapamycin forms a complex with FKBP12 that inhibits cell cycle progression by inhibition of the TOR kinases. We reported previously that rapamycin does not inhibit the vegetative growth of the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe; however, it specifically inhibits its sexual development. Here we show that disruption of the S. pombe FKBP12 homolog,fkh1 +, at its chromosomal locus results in a mating-deficient phenotype that is highly similar to that obtained by treatment of wild type cells with rapamycin. A screen forfkh1 mutants that can confer rapamycin resistance identified five amino acids in Fkh1 that are critical for the effect of rapamycin in S. pombe. All five amino acids are located in the putative rapamycin binding pocket. Together, our findings indicate that Fkh1 has an important role in sexual development and serves as the target for rapamycin action in S. pombe. FKBP12 is a ubiquitous and a highly conserved prolyl isomerase that binds the immunosuppressive drugs FK506 and rapamycin. Members of the FKBP12 family have been implicated in many processes that include intracellular protein folding, transport, and assembly. In the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae and in human T cells, rapamycin forms a complex with FKBP12 that inhibits cell cycle progression by inhibition of the TOR kinases. We reported previously that rapamycin does not inhibit the vegetative growth of the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe; however, it specifically inhibits its sexual development.

Sanfridson A. Cutler N.S. Heitman J. Trends Biotechnol. 1998; 16: 427-433Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). These three compounds bind with high affinity to cytoplasmic proteins termed immunophilins (2Galat A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 216: 689-707Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar, 3Ivery M.T. Med. Res. Rev. 2000; 20: 452-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). CsA binds an immunophilin called cyclophilin-18, whereas FK506 and rapamycin, which are structurally related, bind a different immunophilin called FKBP12. The immunosuppressive drugs form a drug-immunophilin complex, which binds and inhibits a third component. The complexes CsA-cyclophilin-18 and FK506-FKBP12 bind and inhibit the activity of the Ca2+-dependent protein phosphatase, calcineurin (4Clipstone N.A. Crabtree G.R. Ann. N. Y. Acad.

In addition to their immunosuppressive activity, CsA, FK506, and rapamycin have side effects that may stem, at least in part, from inhibition of the physiological function of the immunophilins. For example, in mammals, FKBP12 functions as a subunit of ryanodine calcium release channels and is thought to modulate intracellular Ca2+ levels in the heart (11Jayaraman T. Brillantes A.M.

Mice deficient in FKBP12 show severe heart defects associated with loss of function of cardiac ryanodine receptors (14Shou W. Aghdasi B. Armstrong D.L. Guo Q. Bao S. Charng M.J. Mathews L.M. Schneider M.D. Hamilton S.L. Matzuk M.M. Nature. 1998; 391: 489-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). Similarly, treatment with high doses of FK506 can lead to severe heart failure (15Atkison P. Joubert G. Barron A. Grant D. Paradis K. Seidman E. Wall W. Rosenberg H. Howard J. Williams S. Lancet. 1995; 345: 894-896Abstract PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Although FKBP12 and cyclophilin-18 are unrelated in primary sequence, both classes of immunophilins exhibit a peptidyl prolyl-cis/trans-isomerization (PPIase) activity that accelerates a rate-limiting step in the folding of peptide and protein substrates in vitro (3Ivery M.T. Med. Res. Rev. 2000; 20: 452-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 16Lang K. Schmid F.X. Fischer G. Nature. 1987; 329: 268-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar, 17Tropschug M.

J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 3630-3635Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The PPIase activity of the immunophilins is inhibited upon binding to their specific immunosuppressive drugs, suggesting an overlap between the PPIase-active site and the drug-binding site. According to atomic structure analyses of human cyclophilin-18 and FKBP12, both proteins contain a deep hydrophobic binding pocket (19Ke H.M. Zydowsky L.D. Liu J. Walsh C.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 9483-9487Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 20Ke H. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 228: 539-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 21Van Duyne G.D. Standaert R.F. Karplus P.A.

These pocket structures accommodate the specific immunosuppressive-acting ligands and model tetrapeptides used as pseudosubstrates. The cellular functions of the immunophilins, as well as the relevance of the PPIase activity within the cellular environment, is not well understood. However, some of the important natural substrates of the immunophilins are now known (reviewed in Ref. 22Gothel S.F. Marahiel M.A. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 1999; 55: 423-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar). For example, the human cyclophilin-18, CyPA, binds the Gag polyprotein of the human immunodeficiency virus, type 1, virion (23Thali M. Bukovsky A. Kondo E. Rosenwirth B. Walsh C.T. Sodroski J.

Chem. 1995; 270: 15187-15193Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Genetic studies in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae have played a critical role in elucidating the mode of action of the immunosuppressive drugs in higher eukaryotes (reviewed in Refs. 32Hall M.N. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1996; 24: 234-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar and 33Cardenas M.E. Cruz M.C. Del Poeta M. Chung N. Perfect J.R. Heitman J. Clin. Microbiol. Rev. 1999; 12: 583-611Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Similar to the effect of rapamycin in T cells and certain non-lymphoid cells, rapamycin treatment of S. cerevisiae cells results in a G1 cell cycle arrest (34Heitman J. Movva N.R. Hall M.N. Science. 1991; 253: 905-909Crossref PubMed Scopus (1503) Google Scholar). S. cerevisiae cells contain one FKBP12 homolog, namedFPR1 (34Heitman J. Movva N.R. Hall M.N. Science. 1991; 253: 905-909Crossref PubMed Scopus (1503) Google Scholar), also known as RBP1 (35Koltin Y. Faucette L. Bergsma D.J. Levy M.A. Cafferkey R. Koser P.L. Johnson R.K. Livi G.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 1718-1723Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Disruption ofFPR1 results in slightly slowly growing but viable cells that are completely resistant to rapamycin. This phenotype indicated that FPR1 is a nonessential gene and is the main mediator of the effect of rapamycin (34Heitman J. Movva N.R. Hall M.N. Science. 1991; 253: 905-909Crossref PubMed Scopus (1503) Google Scholar, 35Koltin Y. Faucette L. Bergsma D.J. Levy M.A. Cafferkey R. Koser P.L. Johnson R.K. Livi G.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 1718-1723Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Later it was shown that Fpr1p forms a complex with rapamycin that binds and inhibits the functions of theTOR1 and TOR2 gene products in cell cycle progression (34Heitman J. Movva N.R. Hall M.N.

Cell. 1996; 7: 25-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (590) Google Scholar). Several proteins that interact physically with Fpr1p in the absence of rapamycin have been identified, and it has been suggested that their activity may be regulated by the interaction with Fpr1p. These include calcineurin (40Cardenas M.E. Hemenway C. Muir R.S. Ye R. Fiorentino D. Heitman J. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5944-5957Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar), the biosynthetic enzyme aspartokinase (41Alarcon C.M. Heitman J. Mol. Cell.

Genetics. 1999; 151: 935-944PubMed Google Scholar), and the transcription factor homolog FAP1 (43Kunz J. Loeschmann A. Deuter-Reinhard M. Hall M.N. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 37: 1480-1493Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). We reported previously (44Weisman R. Choder M. Koltin Y. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 6325-6334Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) that rapamycin does not affect vegetative growth in the fission yeast, Schizosaccharomyces pombe, but severely inhibits its sexual development pathway. S. pombecells are induced to enter the sexual development pathway under starvation conditions (45Davey J. Yeast. 1998; 14: 1529-1566Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). If the sexual development pathway is chosen, cells of opposite mating type conjugate to form diploid zygotes that immediately undergo meiosis and sporulation (45Davey J. Yeast. 1998; 14: 1529-1566Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Rapamycin strongly inhibited sexual development at an early stage, before mating had occurred, but did not affect entrance into stationary phase (44Weisman R. Choder M. Koltin Y. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 6325-6334Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). More recently, we reported that S. pombe contains two TOR homologs, tor1 + and tor2 +(46Weisman R. Choder M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 267: 7027-7032Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (158) Google Scholar). tor2 + is an essential gene of as yet unknown function. tor1 + is required under starvation and a variety of other stress conditions that include osmotic and oxidative stresses. Interestingly, none of the studied functions of the S. pombe TOR homologs appear to be inhibited by rapamycin (46Weisman R. Choder M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 267: 7027-7032Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (158) Google Scholar). To understand further the response of S. pombe to rapamycin, we isolated and characterized the S. pombe FKBP12 homolog. We found one FKBP12 homolog and named it fkh1 +. Disruption of fkh1 + results in a mating deficient phenotype that is highly similar to that of rapamycin-treated cells. We identified, using a genetic screen, amino acid substitutions in Fkh1 that confer rapamycin resistance. These substitutions occur in conserved residues of FKBP12 and are potentially involved in rapamycin binding. Our analyses of the fkh1 null and rapamycin-resistant mutants suggest that rapamycin exerts its effect on sexual development in S. pombe by inhibiting the function of Fkh1. Yeast strains used in this paper are described in TableI. Media used are based on those described (47Moreno S. Klar A. Nurse P. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 795-823Crossref PubMed Scopus (3102) Google Scholar). EMM-N contains no nitrogen; EMM lowG contains 0.1% glucose. Transformation of S. pombe cells was performed by electroporation (48Prentice H.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 621Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). Rapamycin was added to a final concentration of 0.2 μg/ml in liquid or agar-containing media, unless otherwise indicated. An equal volume of the drug vehicle solution (1:1 Me2SO:methanol) was used as a control in all experiments. Assays for mating or sporulation efficiency were carried out as follows. Cells were grown at 30 °C in EMM medium to the density of ∼5 × 106–1 × 107cell/ml. The cultures were then washed three times with double distilled water and 5 μl containing 5 × 106 cells were spotted on EMM, EMM-N, EMM-lowG, or ME medium (see Ref. 44Weisman R. Choder M. Koltin Y. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 6325-6334Crossref PubMed Google Scholar for detailed description of medium composition). After 3 days of incubation at 30 °C, a toothpick was used to pick some of the cells from the center of each patch, and the cells were briefly sonicated and examined microscopically. The percentage of mating was calculated by dividing the number of zygotes, asci, and free spores by the number of total cells. The percentage of sporulation was calculated by dividing the number of asci and free spores by the number of total cells. One zygote or one ascus was counted as two cells and one spore was counted as half-cell. In each experiment 500–1000 cells were counted. Cell viability after entry into stationary phase was determined as follows. Cells were grown in minimal medium (EMM) or rich medium (YE) at 30 °C to confluence, and aliquots were sampled every 24 h. Cell viability was determined by the capacity of cells to form colonies.Table IS. pombe strains used in this studyStrainGenotypeSourceTA07leu1–32/leu1–32 ura4-D18/ura4-D18 ade6-M216/ade6-M210 h+/h−Lab stockTA06leu1–32 h−Lab stockTA16leu1–32 ura4-D18 ade6-M216 h90Lab stockTA58leu1–32 ura4-D18 h90Lab stockTA59leu1–32 ura4-D18 ade6-M216 fkh1∷ura4+ h90This studyTA77leu1–32 ura4-D18 fkh1∷ura4+ h90This studyTA94fkh1∷ura4+/fkh1∷ura4+leu1–32/leu1–32 ura4-D18/ura4-D18 ade6M-210/ade6M216 h+/h−This studyTA96fkh1∷ura4+leu1–32 h−This study Open table in a new tab Cells were stained with the DNA fluorochrome propidium iodide and analyzed by a Becton Dickinson FACSort as described (49Snaith H.A. Forsburg S.L. Genetics. 1999; 152: 839-851PubMed Google Scholar). Data were analyzed by Cell Quest software for Macintosh. A 1.7-kilobase pair fragment containing the entire fkh1 + gene was amplified by PCR using a genomic S. pombe DNA preparation as a template and primers 101 (5′-GCTCAGAATGATCGACATATACAAC) and 102 (5′- CAAACCAGCTACATAGCACAG). The resulting PCR fragment was cloned into a pGEM-T vector (Promega) to give pGEMT-fkh1. This plasmid was cut withHindIII, within the fourth exon offkh1 +. The HindIII restriction site lies within the predicted active site and rapamycin binding pocket. TheHindIII cut plasmid was ligated with a HindIII fragment containing ura4 +, resulting in the plasmid pfkh1::ura4 +.NotI and SacI were used to release the 3.5-kilobase pairfkh1::ura4 + disruption fragments that were gel-purified and transformed into the homothallic strain TA16. Stable Ura4+ haploids were selected and subjected to PCR analysis with primer 135 (5′-GTTATAAACATTGGTGTTGGAACAG) that is complementary to sequences within the ura4 + gene and primer 136 (5′-GTTCGAATATAT TCGGTGCGCC) that is complementary to sequences of thefkh1 + locus that are 100 bp downstream of the 3′ end of the disruption construct. The resultant PCR fragment of 1200 bp confirmed that the disruption cassette integrated into thefkh1 + locus. In addition, we used primer 136 in combination with primer 103 that is complementary to sequences that are 100 bp upstream of the 5′ end of the disruption construct. The amplification of a single PCR product of the size of 3700 bp is consistent with a single site insertion of the disruption cassette. We analyzed the phenotype of two independently isolated Δfkh1clones and demonstrated that re-introduction of the wild typefkh1 + gene rescued the defects observed in these clones. The cDNA offkh1 + was isolated by PCR amplification from anS. pombe cDNA library (50Maundrell K. Gene ( Amst. ). 1993; 123: 127-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (922) Google Scholar) with the primers 92 (5′-GGAATTCCATATGGGTGTCGAAAAGCAAGTTATTTC; underlined is the NdeI restriction site) and 81 (5′-TGACCAATGGCGAAGAAGTCC). The PCR product of 486 bp was cloned under the control of the thiamine-repressible nmt1 promoter in pREP1 (50Maundrell K. Gene ( Amst. ). 1993; 123: 127-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (922) Google Scholar). In all experiments cells were grown under derepression conditions (in the absence of thiamine) for full activity of thenmt1 promoter. The cDNA of fkh1 +was also cloned into the S. cerevisiae expression vector pCM189 (51Gari E. Piedrafita L. Aldea M. Herrero E. Yeast. 1997; 13: 837-848Crossref PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar) using primers 92 and 81. In addition, the S. cerevisiae FKBP12 homolog, FPR1, was cloned into the pCM189 vector and pCM189′ (a vector that differs from pCM189 only in that it contains LEU2 as a selective marker and notURA3) using primers 106 (5′-ATAAGAATGCGGCCGCCGGATCCCGCTCGAGGTCG) and 110 (5′-ATAAGAATGCGGCCGCCAATTAAGGCTCAGATACTTACC). TheNotI sites in both primers are underlined. pCM189-fkh1 + and pCM189-FPR1 were transformed into the S. cerevisiae strains JK9-3d (MATα leu2-3,2-112 trp1-1 ura3-52 his4 rme1 HMLa) and JK9-3dα ade2 fpr1::ADE2 (52Heitman J.

Heitman, Duke University Medical Center. fkh1 + cDNA was also isolated during a screen for S. pombe genes that could suppress the rapamycin-sensitive phenotype in S. cerevisiae. The S. cerevisiae strain, RS188N (MAT a leu2-3,2-112 trp1-1 ura3-1 ade2-1 his3-11, 15 can1-100), was transformed with a S. pombe cDNA library constructed using a S. cerevisiae high copy number expression vector in which expression of inserts is regulated by the strong ADH1promoter (53Fikes J.D. Becker D.M. Winston F. Guarente L. Nature. 1990; 346: 291-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Transformants were plated onto minimal medium plates containing 0.1 μg/ml rapamycin at 30 °C. 25 rapamycin-resistant colonies were isolated from over 105 transformants. Of these, 8 exhibited rapamycin resistance upon re-streak on rapamycin-containing plates, and in 4 the rapamycin resistance phenotype was dependent on the presence of the plasmid. 2R. Weisman, S. Finkelstein, and M. Choder, manuscript in preparation. Sequence analysis revealed that one of these, pR22, encodes forfkh1 +. This clone contained the entire open reading frame of fkh1 + flanked by 22 and 150 bp at 5′ and 3′ ends of the open reading frame, respectively. Total protein extracts were prepared from mid-log wild type (TA16), Δfkh1 (TA59), and wild type (TA16) cells transformed with pREP1-fkh1 +, following the method described (47Moreno S. Klar A. Nurse P. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 795-823Crossref PubMed Scopus (3102) Google Scholar). Aliquots of whole cell extracts containing 40 μg of protein were fractionated by SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred to membrane filters. The immobilized proteins were detected using the PerkinElmer Life Sciences ECL system. The Fkh1 proteins were detected with polyclonal antibodies raised against S. cerevisiaeFKBP12, the kind gift of J. Heitman, Duke University Medical Center. fkh1 mutants were obtained by PCR-based mutagenesis. Conditions for PCR-based random mutagenesis offkh1 + were essentially as described (54Fromant M. Blanquet S. Plateau P. Anal. Biochem. 1995; 224: 347-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). Briefly, 5 ng of plasmid pR22 were taken for PCR amplification offkh1 + cDNA with 0.2 μg of primers 92 (5′-GGAATTCCATATGGGTGTCGAAAA GCAAGTTATTTC, NdeI site is underlined) and 81 (5′-TGACCAATGGCGAAGAAGTCC). The PCR buffer contained 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.7), 50 mm KCl, 5 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 0.5 mm MnCl2, 4.2 mm MgCl2, 5 units of Taq polymerase, 250 μm each of dNTP, and an excess of 1.5 mmof one dNTP nucleotide concentration over the others. Four separate PCRs were performed, and in each reaction a different dNTP was present in excess. 25 cycles of PCR were performed with the following temperature profile: 94 °C, 30 s; 55 °C, 30 s; 72 °C, 30 s. The four PCRs were pooled and fractionated in a 1.5% agarose gel and eluted. The resultant 550-bp DNA fragments were digested with NdeI and ligated with aNdeI-SmaI digested pREP1 S. pombevector. The ligation product was used for PCR amplification with primers 189 (5′-GAATAAGTCATCAGCGGTTGTTTC) and 190 (5′-TCATCCATGCGGCCAATCTTGTCG). These DNA fragments containing the mutated fkh1 + cDNA flanked by pREP1 sequences were co-transformed with pREP1 into the S. pombe strain TA77 (leu1-32 ura4-D18 fkh1::ura4 + h90). Transformants were plated on minimal medium and after 4 days of incubation at 30 °C replica-plated to minimal medium with or without 0.2 μg/ml rapamycin. After an additional 5 days of incubation at 30 °C, the plates were exposed to iodine vapor. Iodine vapor is routinely used to detect sporulating colonies. Spores are darkly stained by iodine vapor, whereas vegetative cells remain unstained. In the presence of rapamycin (44Weisman R. Choder M. Koltin Y. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 6325-6334Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) or in Δfkh1 colonies (this study), no dark staining is observed since the sexual development pathway is blocked prior to conjugation. Plasmid DNA was isolated from Δfkh1 transformants that stained dark in the presence of rapamycin and used for re-transformation of TA77 and transformation of bacterial cells for plasmid amplification. Plasmids that conferred rapamycin resistance phenotype upon re-transformation were further subjected to DNA sequence analysis. Most of the S. pombe genome has been sequenced through the coordination of the Sanger Center, UK. Based on sequence comparisons, we identified one S. pombe FKBP12 homolog on chromosome II and named it fkh1 + (forFKBP12 homolog). The open reading frame offkh1 + is interrupted by 4 introns of 182, 128, 105, and 48 base pairs. fkh1 + encodes a putative 112-amino acid protein with a predicted mass of 12 kDa. We cloned thefkh1 + cDNA by PCR amplification using a fission yeast cDNA library as a template (see “Experimental Procedures”). Sequence analysis confirmed that the 4 introns predicted in the genomic sequence are spliced out in the cDNA clone. Analysis of the predicted amino acid sequence encoded byfkh1 + reveals that this gene is very similar to its S. cerevisiae homolog, FPR1 (72% overall identity). The similarity between fkh1 + and the human FKBP12 homolog is comparable to the similarity betweenFPR1 and the human FKBP12 (55% overall identity).fkh1 + encodes all the amino acids required for rapamycin binding as predicted by the high resolution structure of the human FKBP12-rapamycin complex (Ref. 21Van Duyne G.D. Standaert R.F. Karplus P.A. Schreiber S.L. Clardy J. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 229: 105-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (1073) Google Scholar and see Fig. 5). The S. cerevisiae FKBP12 protein, Fpr1p, binds to rapamycin. FKBP12-rapamycin complexes bind the TOR proteins and thus inhibit some of their functions (see Introduction). Since the S. pombe fkh1 + gene shows a significant level of homology with FPR1, we examined whether fkh1 +can replace FPR1 in mediating the effect of rapamycin inS. cerevisiae. To this goal, we expressedfkh1 + cDNA in S. cerevisiae usingADH1 promoter-driven vector, pCM189 (51Gari E. Piedrafita L. Aldea M. Herrero E. Yeast. 1997; 13: 837-848Crossref PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar). Wild type and Δfpr1 S. cerevisiae cells were transformed with pCM189-fkh1 +, and the transformants were streaked onto plates containing 0.08 μg/ml rapamycin (Fig.1). As described previously, the wild type S. cerevisiae cells did not form colonies in the presence of rapamycin, whereas Δfpr1 cells were completely resistant to the lethal effect of the drug (34Heitman J. Movva N.R. Hall M.N. Science. 1991; 253: 905-909Crossref PubMed Scopus (1503) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). Expression offkh1 + in Δfpr1 cells restored rapamycin sensitivity (Fig. 1, plate 2), indicating thatfkh1 +, like FPR1, is capable of mediating the effect of rapamycin in S. cerevisiae cells. It is therefore most likely that the gene product offkh1 + forms a toxic complex with rapamycin that binds and inhibits the S. cerevisiae TOR proteins. Unexpectedly, following a prolonged incubation, cells expressing pCM189-fkh1 + exhibited slow growth in the presence of rapamycin, either in the genetic background of wild type or Δfpr1 cells (Fig. 1, plates 3 and4). Thus, the expression of fkh1 +under the strong ADH1 promoter can slightly increase rapamycin resistance in S. cerevisiae cells. Overexpression of FPR1 from the same expression vector did not exhibit such an effect (see Fig. 2 A), consistent with previous findings (55Lorenz M.C. Heitman J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27531-27537Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). We also screened an S. pombe cDNA library for genes that can confer rapamycin resistance in S. cerevisiae cells (see “Experimental Procedures”). Wild type S. cerevisiae was transformed with the S. pombe cDNA library, and the transformants were plated on rapamycin-containing plates. Sequence analysis of one of the isolated cDNA clones revealed that it encoded fkh1 +. The"

DNA methyltransferase 1 untranslated region AU-rich element adenine and uridine granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor polymerase chain reaction green fluorescent protein base pair(s) fluorescence-activated cell sorter DNA methylation is a covalent modification of DNA that can modulate gene expression and is now recognized as a major component of the epigenome (1Razin A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4905-4908Crossref PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar, 2Razin A. Riggs A.D. Science. 1980; 210: 604-610Crossref PubMed Scopus (1503) Google Scholar). The methylation of cytosines in vertebrates occurs when they are found 5′ to deoxyguanosine in the sequence CpG. 80% of CpGs are methylated (3Szyf M. Avraham-Haetzni K. Reifman A. Shlomai J. Kaplan F. Oppenheim A. Razin A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 3278-3282Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), and they are distributed in a pattern that is unique in each tissue and is inversely correlated with gene expression (3Szyf M.

The pattern of methylation is faithfully maintained during cell division by the enzyme DNMT1,1 the maintenance DNA methyltransferase, (4Li E. Bestor T.H. Jaenisch R. Cell. 1992; 69: 915-926Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3201) Google Scholar) which catalyzes the transfer of a methyl group from S-adenosyl-methionine to the 5-position of the cytosine ring (5Wu J.C.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar). DNMT1 has a bilateral relationship with DNA replication and cell growth (7Szyf M. Detich N. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol. Biol. 2001; 69: 47-79Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). DNA methylation occurs concurrently with DNA replication (8Araujo F.D. Knox J.D. Szyf M. Price G.B. Zannis-Hadjopoulos M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3475-3482Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), and the expression of dnmt1 is tightly coordinated with the cell cycle (9Szyf M. Bozovic V. Tanigawa G. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 10027-10230Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), whereas inhibition of DNMT1 inhibits DNA replication (10Knox J.D. Araujo F.D. Bigey P. Slack A.D. Price G.B. Zannis-Hadjopoulos M. Szyf M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17986-17990Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), leading to senescence and inhibition of cell growth (11Jackson-Grusby L. Beard C. Possemato R.

Chem. 2001; 276: 0000Google Scholar). Deregulated expression of dnmt1 was previously suggested to play a causal role in cellular transformation (13el-Deiry W.S. Nelkin B.D. Celano P. Yen R.W. Falco J.P. Hamilton S.R. Baylin S.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 3470-3474Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar, 14Szyf M. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1994; 15: 233-238Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Several lines of evidence are in accordance with this hypothesis. First, elevated levels of dnmt1 mRNA and activity were reported in tumors and cancer cell lines (15Kautiainen T.L. Jones P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 1594-1598Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Issa J.P. Vertino P.M. Wu J. Sazawal S. Celano P. Nelkin B.D. Hamilton S.R. Baylin S.B. J. Natl.

A. 1996; 93: 4045-4050Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). Second, ectopic expression of dnmt1 results in cellular transformation (18Wu J. Issa J.P. Herman J. Bassett Jr., D.E. Nelkin B.D.

Biol. 1996; 16: 4555-4565Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). Third, dnmt1 expression is regulated by nodal proto-oncogenic signaling pathways (20Rouleau J. MacLeod A.R. Szyf M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1595-1601Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 21MacLeod A.R. Rouleau J. Szyf M. J. Biol.

And fourth, inhibition of DNMT 1 by 5-azacytidine (a pharmacological inhibitor of DNMT1) or a reduction in DNMT1 levels by either antisense mRNA or antisense oligonucleotides reverses tumorigenesis (23Laird P.W.

A. 1997; 94: 684-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). The mechanism by which DNMT1 influences cellular transformation is unclear. It has been proposed that high levels of DNMT1 can lead to ectopic methylation and silencing of tumor suppressor genes (26Baylin S.B. Herman J.G. Graff J.R. Vertino P.M. Issa J.P. Adv. Cancer Res. 1998; 72: 141-196Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, a clear correlation between general dnmt1overexpression and tumor suppressor hypermethylation has not been established (27Jurgens B. Schmitz-Drager B.J. Schulz W.A. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 5698-5703PubMed Google Scholar, 28Eads C.A. Danenberg K.D. Kawakami K. Saltz L.B. Danenberg P.V. Laird P.W. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 2302-2306PubMed Google Scholar). It has recently been suggested that deregulated expression of dnmt1 during the cell cycle might be critical for the effects of DNMT1 on cell growth (29Robertson K.D. Keyomarsi K. Gonzales F.A. Velicescu M. Jones P.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 2108-2113Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar, 30Szyf M. Knox D.J. Milutinovic S. Slack A.D. Araujo F.D. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 2000; 910 (; Discussion, 175–177): 156-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Previous nuclear run-on experiments have demonstrated that although both growth-arrested and cycling cells transcribe dnmt1 mRNA at a similar rate, the mRNA is only detected in cycling cells (9Szyf M. Bozovic V. Tanigawa G. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 10027-10230Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This suggests that the cell cycle regulation of dnmt1 occurs at the posttranscriptional level. It stands to reason that the mechanisms involved are linked to basic control points of the cell cycle, and potentially linked to cellular transformation. To test this hypothesis, the factors responsible for regulation of dnmt1 expression with the cell cycle must be identified. One potential element is the AU-rich 3′-untranslated region (3′-UTR) of the dnmt1mRNA, because it is well documented that this type of element can regulate mRNA levels (31Wilson G.M. Brewer G. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 1999; 62: 257-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Regulation of mRNA stability by AU-rich elements (AREs) is an important mechanism involved in orchestrating the expression of critical genes in development (32Surdej P. Riedl A. Jacobs-Lorena M. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1994; 28: 263-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 33Zhou Q. Guo Y. Liu Y. Mol. Cell.

Cell. 1985; 42: 889-902Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar), and cytokines such as granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) (38Shaw G. Kamen R. Cell. 1986; 46: 659-667Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3115) Google Scholar) and interleukin 3 (39Ming X.F. Kaiser M. Moroni C. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6039-6048Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). These regions often modulate mRNA levels in response to a change in cell environment by growth factors (40Scheper W. Holthuizen P.E. Sussenbach J.S. Biochem. J. 1996; 318: 195-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 41Jang B.C. Sanchez T. Schaefers H.J. Trifan O.C. Liu C.H. Creminon C. Huang C.K. Hla T. J.

Endocrinol. 2000; 25: 17-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Although the mechanism by which AREs act has not been fully elucidated, it appears to involve the binding of various protein factors, several of which have been well characterized, such as AUF1 (44Zhang W. Wagner B.J. Ehrenman K. Schaefer A.W. DeMaria C.T. Crater D. DeHaven K. Long L. Brewer G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 7652-7665Crossref PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar, 45DeMaria C.T. Brewer G. J.

In this study, we test the hypothesis that the 3′-UTR of thednmt1 mRNA plays a role in regulating its levels with the cell cycle and that deregulation at this level has an effect on cellular transformation by DNMT1. We show that a 54-nucleotide highly conserved element within the 3′-UTR can confer a growth-dependent regulation on both homologous and heterologous mRNAs in living cells and that this region can destabilize mRNA in vitro. This element interacts with a 40-kDa protein, the binding of which is inversely correlated withdnmt1 mRNA levels throughout the cell cycle. Finally, we demonstrate that the 3′-UTR influences the cellular changes observed upon overexpression of DNMT1 in NIH-3T3 cells, thus providing a link between dnmt1 regulation, cell cycle, and oncogenesis. Balb/c-3T3 cells (ATCC) were maintained as a monolayer in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) containing 10% calf serum (Colorado Serum Co). To arrest cells at G0/G1, confluent Balb/c 3T3 cells were cultured in a medium containing 0.5% calf serum for 48 h. The cells were induced to enter the cell cycle by replacing the growth medium with medium containing 10% calf serum. Cells at various stages of the cell cycle were obtained by harvesting them at varying lengths of time after serum induction. To determine the percentage of cells at different stages of the cell cycle, cells were stained with propidium iodide and the DNA content was measured by flow cytometry (48Melamed M.R. Mullaney P.F. Mendelsohn M.L. Flow Cytometry and Sorting. Wiley-Liss, New York1990Google Scholar). For the construction of pCRII-DNMT1 3′-UTR, human DNMT1 3′-UTR (5090–5408) was amplified by reverse transcription-PCR from 1 μg of total RNA prepared from human lung cancer H446 cell line (ATCC). Reverse transcription was performed using random primers (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and Superscript reverse transcriptase as recommended by the manufacturer (Life Technologies, Inc.). For PCR amplification withTaq polymerase (CLONTECH), 50 ng of the sense primer (5′-TCTGCCCTCCCGTCACCC-3′) and antisense primer 5′-GGTTTATAGGAGAGATTT-3′) was used to amplify the 3′-UTR from 5 μl of reverse-transcribed cDNA in the presence of 1 mm dNTPs, and the manufacturer's amplification buffer was supplemented to 2 mm MgCl2. Cycling conditions were as follows: 95 °C for 1 min, 50 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 1.5 min for 30 cycles. The amplified fragment was subcloned into pCR II using the TA cloning kit (Invitrogen) as recommended by the manufacturer. To generate pRBG-DNMT1 3′-UTR, the human DNMT1 3′-UTR was excised from PCRII-DNMT1 3′-UTR with BamHI and XbaI and ligated into a XbaI-SalI digested pRBG-GC (38Shaw G. Kamen R. Cell. 1986; 46: 659-667Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3115) Google Scholar). The incompatible ends were then filled using Klenow DNA polymerase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and the blunt ends were joined using T4 DNA ligase (MBI Fermentas). For the construction of pRBG-DNMT1Δ 5′259 and pSK-Δ5′259, sense and antisense oligonucleotides coding for bases 5349–5405 bearing 5′ XbaI and 3′ SalI overhangs were annealed and ligated into the XbaI and SalI sites of both pRBG-GC and pBluescript SK. pSK-Δ3′56 and pSK-Δ3′158 were generated by PCR amplification using 10 ng of pCRII-DNMT1 3′-UTR as a template, the 3′-UTR sense primer as above, and antisense primers 5′-GTCGACTTAATTTCCACTCATACAGTGGTAG-3′ for pSKΔ3′56 and 5′-GTCGACTTAGTTGATAAGCGAACCTCACACA-3′ for pSKΔ 3′158. The amplified sequences were cloned into PCRII and then removed from the vector by SalI digestion and ligated into pBluescript-SK cut with SalI and SmaI. For the construction of pUD-hDNMT1 and pUD-hDNMT1ΔUTR, the pUD1 vector (a gift from Dr. L. Chasin) was digested with EcoRI and HindIII (to remove the DHFR gene) and either blunt-ended or modified with the following linkers: 5′-AATTCTAG-3′ and 5′-AGCTCTAG-3′ to generate an XbaI site. HumanDNMT1 cDNA (360–5085) was inserted into the blunt pUD1 to give pUD-hDNMT1ΔUTR, whereas hDNMT1 cDNA (360–5408) was inserted into the modified pUD1 to give pUD-hDNMT1. For the construction of pAd-DNMT1, pAd-DNMT1Δ3′56, pAdDNMT1Δ3′-UTR, hDNMT1 cDNA was cloned into the AdEasy shuttle vector pAdTrack cytomegalovirus in the XbaI site. Adenoviral recombination and preparation of the infectious particles in Hek293 cells was performed as described previously (49He T.C. Zhou S. da Costa L.T., Yu, J. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2509-2514Crossref PubMed Scopus (3236) Google Scholar). The followingDNMT1 regions were used: 1–5408 (pAd-DNMT1), 1–5350 (pAd-DNMT1Δ3′56), and 1–5085 (pAd-DNMT1Δ3′-UTR). Total RNA was prepared by the guanidinium isothiocyanate method (50Chirgwin J.M. Przybyla A.E. MacDonald R.J. Rutter W.J. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 5294-5299Crossref PubMed Scopus (16648) Google Scholar), and mRNA levels were determined by Northern blot analysis. Approximately 10 μg of RNA was electrophoresed on a 1.2% denaturing agarose gel and then transferred to Hybond-N+ membrane (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Blots were probed with the indicated 32P-labeled cDNA probes synthesized using a random priming labeling kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The membranes were hybridized at 68 °C for 4–6 h in a buffer containing 0.5 m sodium phosphate, pH 6.8, 1 mm EDTA, 7% SDS, and 0.2 mg·ml herring sperm DNA. Following hybridization the membranes were washed twice for 10 min in a 5% SDS, 0.04 msodium phosphate, pH 6.8, 1 mm EDTA solution and then four times for 10 min in the same solution containing 1% SDS. The following probes were used: rabbit β-globin (a 500-bp Xho-Bam fragment from pRBG-GC), hDNMT1 (a 1.5-kilobase pair fragment from nucleotides 601–2191 of the full-length human DNMT1 cDNA), mDNMT1 (a 1.7-kilobase pair fragment from nucleotides 844–2544 of the full-length mouse dnmt1 cDNA), green fluorescent protein (GFP) (a 765-bp NheI-HindIII fragment from pEGFP-C1 (CLONTECH)). The level of expression of the different mRNAs was quantified by densitometric scanning of the relevant autoradiogram. Each experiment was normalized for the amount of total RNA by hybridization with a32P-labeled 18-s ribosomal RNA oligonucleotide probe (51Szyf M. Milstone D.S. Schimmer B.P. Parker K.L. Seidman J.G. Mol. Endocrinol. 1990; 4: 1144-1152Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), with the exception of the adenoviral experiments, which were normalized to GFP, which is expressed by the adenoviral vector. To create the pRBG stable lines, 5 μg of the following plasmids were introduced into Balb/c 3T3 cells by DNA-mediated gene transfer using the calcium phosphate protocol (52Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Smith J.A. Seidman J.G. Stairwell K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley and Sons, New York1988Google Scholar): pRBG-AT (bearing the 3′-UTR of human GM-CSF and a neomycin resistance gene as a selectable marker), pRBG-GC (control) (both plasmids were a kind gift of Dr. G Shaw) (38Shaw G. Kamen R. Cell. 1986; 46: 659-667Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3115) Google Scholar), pRBG-DNMT1 3′-UTR, and pRBG-DNMT1Δ 5′259. G418-resistant colonies were cloned and propagated in selective medium containing 0.25 mg/ml Geneticin (Life Technologies, Inc.). Stable lines expressing pUD-hDNMT1 and pUD-hDNMT1Δ3′-UTR (the pUD vector bears a tetracycline-repressible promoter) were obtained by transfecting 6 μg of each construct together with 6 μg of a puromycin resistance expression vector pBABEpuro (53Morgenstern J.P. Land H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 3587-3596Crossref PubMed Scopus (1895) Google Scholar) into TetOff NIH3T3 cells (CLONTECH) using SuperFect reagent (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Resistant colonies were selected in medium containing 3 μg/ml puromycin (Sigma) and were then further cultured in the presence of 1 μg/ml doxycycline (Sigma) to repress transcription of the transfected DNMT1. Northern blot analyses were used to verify expression of the ectopic hDNMT1 for both sets of transfectants. Growth arrest was accomplished by culturing in 0.5% serum for 48 h; to induce growth, arrested cells were cultured in 10% serum-containing medium for 20 h. Doxycycline was removed 48 h before serum starvation to induce ectopic hDNMT1 transcription. Growth rates were determined following plating the cells in six-well culture dishes at a density of 25,000 cells/well. Cells were then counted on six subsequent occasions throughout the span of 11 days, and phase contrast photography was performed on the last day. An average of four counts was performed for each time point. Balb/c cells were grown to confluence in six-well plates and were then transferred to 0.5% serum medium for 48 h to arrest cell growth. Cells were then infected for 4 h in serum-free medium with pAd-DNMT1, pAd-DNMT1Δ3′56, and pAd-DNMT1Δ3′-UTR at multiplicities of infection of 25, 50, and 150 respectively. 100% of cells were infected as determined by visualization of the green fluorescent protein, which is expressed by the adenoviral vector. Cells were then maintained in 0.5% medium for an additional 24 h before the medium was replaced with a medium containing either 10 or 0.5% serum. RNA was harvested after 20 h and was analyzed by a Northern blot analysis as described above. To generate RNA transcripts for the gel mobility shift, UV cross-linking, and in vitrodegradation assays, the following plasmids were linearized at the indicated restriction sites: pCRII-DNMT1 3′-UTR (BamHI), pSK-Δ5′259 (SalI), pSK-Δ3′56 (SalI), and pSK-Δ3′158 (SalI). In vitro transcription was then carried out in the presence of 50 μCi of [α32P]-UTP (3000Ci/mmol, PerkinElmer Life Sciences) using either T7 polymerase (for DNMT1 3′-UTR) or T3 polymerase (for Δ5′259, Δ3′56, and Δ3′158). The Ambion in vitro transcription kit was used as recommended by the manufacturer. Cold competitor RNA transcripts were synthesized using the Promega RiboMax system according to the protocol supplied by the manufacturer. Balb/c 3T3 cells were harvested and resuspended in extraction buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.4 m KCl, 20% (v/v) glycerol, 2 mm dithiothreitol, and 1× CompleteTM protease inhibitor (Roche Molecular Biochemicals)). The suspension was frozen immediately at −80 °C for 1 h, and the whole cell extract was isolated by centrifugation at 10000 × g for 15 min. The supernatant was recovered and used for RNA binding assays. Protease K treatment was carried out for 1 h at 37 °C at a final concentration of 1 μg/μl. Reaction mixtures were incubated on ice for 1 h in a 20-μl mixture containing 50 μg of whole cell extract, 1,000,000 cpm of probe), 10 μg of tRNA (as a nonspecific RNA competitor), and the following buffer: 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.6, 3 mmMgCl2, 40 mm KCl, 5% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol. Following incubation, free unbound32P-labeled RNA was removed by treating the reaction mixture with 1.5 μl of RNase T1 (1 unit/ml) and 1.5 μl of RNase A (10 mg/ml) for 10 min at room temperature. Heparin 5 μg/ml was added, and the reaction was incubated for an additional 10 min at room temperature. The resulting complexes were resolved on a 10% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel. For UV cross-linking assays, the same reaction mixture was subjected to incubation on ice for 1.5 h under UV light (254 nm). Cold RNA competitors were used at a concentration of 1000×. RNases were added as above, and the reaction mixture was incubated for an additional 30 min at 37 °C. 5 μl of 5× loading buffer (1.05 m Tris-Cl, pH 6.8, 36% glycerol, 100 mg/ml SDS, 0.2% β-mercaptoethanol, 0.12 mg/ml bromphenol blue) were added, and the mixture was boiled for 10 min. Protein-RNA complexes were resolved on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis gel. RNA decay rates were assessed using the protocol described in Ref. 42Buzby J.S. Brewer G. Nugent D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33973-33978Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar with the following modifications. 10 μg of whole cell extract and 2.5 × 105 cpm of in vitro synthesized RNA transcript were used, and the reactions were carried out for 0.25–4 h at 37 °C. The concentration of RNA at each time point was quantified by densitometry of the autoradiogram and is presented in the figures as the percentage of RNA remaining at each time point relative to the concentration of RNA at time 0. The half-life of the different RNAs was calculated from the logarithmic decay plots. Total RNA (1 μg) from TetOff NIH 3T3 stable lines was reverse-transcribed with M-MuL-V reverse transcriptase and a random primer (MBI) using the manufacturer's protocol in the presence of 25 μCi of 35S-labeled dATP (1250 Ci/mmol) to quantify the efficiency of reverse transcription. Equal amounts of cDNA (30000 cpm as determined by [35S]dATP incorporation) were subjected toDNMT1 PCR amplification using Taq polymerase (MBI) in the presence of decreasing concentrations (10−12–10−16nm) of a competitor DNA fragment. Primers 5′-ACCGCTTCTACTTCCTCGAGGCCTA-3′ (sense, starting at 3479) and 5′-GTTGCAGTCCTCTGTGAACACTGTGG-3′ (antisense, starting at 3813) were used to amplify the target sequence, and 5′-CCTCGAGGCCTAGAAACAAAGGGAAGGGCAAG-3′ (ending at 3576) was used to create the competitor, as previously described (54Tao L. Nielsen T. Friedlander P. Zannis-Hadjopoulos M. Price G. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 273: 509-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) PCR conditions were as follows: 96 °C for 1 min, 65 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 1 min (33 cycles). To differentiate between the endogenousmdnmt1 and transfected hDNMT1 mRNA, the PCR was transferred to Hybond-N+ membrane and hybridized with an oligonucleotide corresponding to bases 3595–3617 of the full-length human DNMT1 mRNA (GenBankTM accession number NM001379.1). The oligo was labeled at the 5′ end using 20 μCi of [γ-32P]-ATP (3000 Ci/mmol, PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and T4 polynucleotide kinase (MBI Fermantas) according to the manufacturers' protocols. The membranes were incubated for 16 h at 42 °C in the following hybridization buffer: 1% SDS, 5× SSC, 5× Denhardt's solution (0.5 mg/ml Ficoll, 0.5 mg/ml polyvinylpyrrolidone, 0.5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin), 0.1 mg/ml herring sperm DNA, and then washed twice with 6× SSC + 0.1% SDS for 10 min at room temperature, twice for 10 min at 37 °C, and twice for 10 min at 42 °C. To further confirm that equal amounts reverse-transcribed cDNA were being used, we amplified β-actin using the following primers: 5′-GTTGCTATCCAGGCTGTGCTA-3′ (sense, starting at 473) and 5′-GCGGATGTCCACGTCACACTT-3′ (antisense, starting at 943) (GenBankTM accession number XM_004814). Touchdown PCR was used by decreasing the annealing temperature from 66 to 60 °C over four cycles, and then continuing with 96 °C for 30 s, 60 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 30 s (21 cycles). Previous studies have demonstrated that DNMT1 is regulated with cell growth (9Szyf M. Bozovic V. Tanigawa G. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 10027-10230Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29Robertson K.D. Keyomarsi K. Gonzales F.A. Velicescu M. Jones P.A.

Oncogene. 1999; 18: 7453-7461Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). To correlate the levels of dnmt1 mRNA with different stages of the cell cycle in our system, Balb/c-3T3 cells were stimulated with serum for varying times following growth arrest, and concurrent FACS and Northern blot analyses were performed. As seen in Fig.1, A and C, the majority of cells were arrested at G0/G1(70%) after serum deprivation for 48 h (t = 0). Addition of serum-containing medium induced entry of the cells into the S phase of the cell cycle, which peaked 24 h poststimulation (S = 51%). dnmt1 mRNA was barely detectable in arrested cells and was induced late in G1 (8–12 h), reaching its maximum levels at the G1-S boundary (20 h) (Fig. 1, B and C). dnmt1 mRNA remained elevated throughout S, and then began to decrease as cells continued into G2-M. Because nuclear run-on transcription experiments have previously shown that dnmt1 is transcribed at a constant rate throughout the cell cycle (9Szyf M. Bozovic V. Tanigawa G. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 10027-10230Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the variation in mRNA levels must occur at the posttranscriptional level. This mode of regulation has already been reported for dnmt1 in several cases, such as in myoblast differentiation (57Liu Y. Sun L. Jost J.P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 2718-2722Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), F9 cell differentiation (58Teubner B. Schulz W.A. J. Cell.

Although a yeast gene whose product is required for GS activity in vitro, GNS1, was isolated and characterized, its role in GS function has remained unknown. In the current study we show that Δgns1 cells accumulate a non-competitive and non-proteinous inhibitor(s) in the membrane fraction. Investigations of inhibitory activity on GS revealed that the inhibitor(s) is mainly present in the sphingolipid fraction. It is shown that Δgns1 cells contain phytosphingosine (PHS), an intermediate in the sphingolipid biosynthesis, 30-fold more than wild-type cells do. The membrane fraction isolated from Δsur2 cells contains an increased amount of dihydrosphingosine (DHS) and also exhibits reduced GS activity. Among constituents of the sphingolipid fraction, PHS and DHS show striking inhibition in a non-competitive manner. The intracellular level of DHS is much lower than that of PHS in wild-type cells, suggesting that PHS is the primary inhibitor of GS in vivo. The localization of PHS to the endoplasmic reticulum in wild-type cells coincides with that of the inhibitor(s) in Δgns1 cells. Taken together, our results indicate that PHS is a potent inhibitor of yeast GS in vivo. 1,3-β-d-Glucan, a major filamentous component of the cell wall in the budding yeastSaccharomyces cerevisiae, is synthesized by 1,3-β-glucan synthase (GS).

Among cell wall components in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, 1,3-β-d-glucan (glucan) is the main structural component responsible for the rigidity of the cell wall (1Cid V.J. Duran A. Rey F. Snyder M.P. Nombela C. Sanchez M. Microbiol. Rev. 1995; 59: 345-386Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Glucan is synthesized by a specific biosynthetic enzyme, 1,3-β-glucan synthase (GS)1 (EC 2.4.1.34) localized to the plasma membrane. Yeast GS has been extensively studied both genetically and biochemically, revealing spatial and temporal regulation of cell wall synthesis (1Cid V.J. Duran A. Rey F. Snyder M.P. Nombela C. Sanchez M. Microbiol. Rev. 1995; 59: 345-386Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Smits G.J. Kapteyn J.C. van den Ende H. Klis F.M. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 1999; 2: 348-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Recent studies of yeast GS revealed that it is composed of at least two subunits: a putative catalytic subunit encoded by two related genes, FKS1 andFKS2, and predicted to be an intrinsic membrane protein with 16-membrane spanning domains (3Inoue S.B.

Chem. 1996; 271: 14604-14609Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Since GTP-bound Rho1p is required not only for cell wall synthesis but also for intracellular actin organization (9Helliwell S.B. Schmidt A. Ohya Y. Hall M.N. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 1211-1214Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), signal transduction leading to Rho1p plays a key role in cell morphogenesis. Another gene,GNS1, was originally isolated as a positive component required for GS activity in vitro (10El-Sherbeini M. Clemas J.A. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 3227-3234Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). GS activity is severely reduced in the membrane fraction of a Δgns1mutant (10El-Sherbeini M. Clemas J.A. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 3227-3234Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). GNS1 interacts genetically withFKS1: a Δgns1 Δfks1 double mutant grows more slowly and exhibits more reduced GS activity in the membrane fraction than single mutants (10El-Sherbeini M. Clemas J.A. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 3227-3234Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although these results suggest thatGNS1 is somehow involved in GS activity, the physiological function of GNS1 remained unsolved since the Δgns1 mutant has a normal glucan content (10El-Sherbeini M. Clemas J.A. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 3227-3234Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Other lines of evidence revealed that GNS1 is allelic toELO2, which is involved in fatty acid elongation and sphingolipid synthesis (11Oh C.S. Toke D.A. Mandala S. Martin C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17376-17384Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar, 12David D. Sundarababu S. Gerst J.E. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1167-1182Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). A Δelo2(Δgns1) mutant is defective primarily in elongation of very long chain fatty acids. Since yeast sphingolipids are structural components of very long chain fatty acids, inability of Δelo2 cells to synthesize very long chain fatty acids results in alteration in the amounts of intermediates in sphingolipid metabolism (11Oh C.S. Toke D.A. Mandala S. Martin C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17376-17384Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). In this study, we further investigated the reduced GS activity in the membrane fraction of the Δgns1 mutant. Our results indicate that a PHS accumulation in the Δgns1 mutant causes non-competitive inhibition of GS activity. Media for growth of S. cerevisiae and Escherichia coli are as described previously (13Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Genetic manipulations and yeast transformations were carried out as described (14Sikorski R.S. Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The E. coli strain SCS1 (Stratagene, San Diego, CA) was used for propagation of plasmids used in this study. The yeast strains used in this work were derivatives of YPH500 (MATα ade2 his3 leu2 lys2 trp1 ura3) (14Sikorski R.S. Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). YOC798 (MATα ade2 his3 leu2 lys2 trp1 ura3 Δgns1::HIS3) was made by transformation of YPH500 with the SphI-SacI fragment of pYO1929. Transformation of YOC798 with pYO1738 resulted in YOC799. YOC2587 (MATα ade2 his3 leu2 lys2 trp1 ura3 Δsur2::cgHIS3) and YOC2588 (MATα ade2 his3 leu2 lys2 trp1 ura3Δipt1::cgHIS3) were made by the PCR method described by Sakumoto et al. (15Sakumoto N., Y. Mukai K. Uchida T. Kouchi J. Kuwajima Nakagawa Y. Sugioka S. Yamamoto E. Furuyama T. Mizubuchi H. Ohsugi N. Sakuno T. Kikuchi K. Matsuoka I. Ogawa N. Kaneko Y. Harashima S.

Restriction and modifying enzymes were purchased from TaKaRa (Kyoto, Japan). PHS, erythro-DHS, trypsin, Sephacryl S-1000, protease inhibitors, and reagents for enzyme assays were obtained from Sigma. Reagents for sphingolipids extraction came from Wako (Osaka, Japan). Standard molecular biological techniques were used for the construction of plasmids and PCR (13Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). pUC119-GNS1 containing the full-length of GNS1was constructed by inserting the 3.0-kilobaseSphI-SalI fragment containing GNS1into pUC119. pYO1929, generated for GNS1 disruption, was made by inserting the BamHI-BamHI fragment ofHIS3 from pJJ215 into the NruI-EcoRV gap of pUC119-GNS1. YEpU-DPL1 was constructed by inserting the 2.6-kilobase XhoI-XhoI fragment amplified by PCR with 5′-CCGCTCGAGCCGACAGTACGACTTAAAAAA-3′ and 5′-CCGCTCGAGTTATTTGTAGAAGGATTGTTT-3′ containing the full-length ofDPL1 into pRS326 (14Sikorski R.S. Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In order to insert the 3HA epitope at the C terminus of Gns1p, anNheI site was introduced just before the stop codon ofGNS1 as follows. First, pRS314-NcoI was constructed by inserting the NcoI linker at the uniqueBamHI site of pRS314 (14Sikorski R.S. Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Second, pYO1932 was constructed by inserting the SpeI-NcoI fragment containingGNS1 from the DNA clone bank (16Sato K. Nishikawa S. Nakano A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 1459-1477Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), theNcoI-NheI fragment amplified by PCR with 5′-TTTGCATACTTATCACCATGG-3′ and 5′-CTAGCTAGCCCTTTTTCTTCTGTGTTG-3′, and the NheI-SalI fragment amplified by PCR with 5′-CTAGCTAGCTAAGTGTAAAATCTTTGA-3′ and 5′-GATTTTCAAATCACAGTCGAC-3′, into pRS314-NcoI. Finally, pYO1738 (GNS1:3HA) was generated by inserting the NheI-NheI fragment containing 3HA from pYT11 (17Takita Y. Ohya Y. Anraku Y. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1995; 246: 269-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) into pYO1932 at the NheI site. Cells were grown at 25 °C in 1 liter of medium in a 2-liter flask rotating in air incubator (Innova 4330) at 150 rpm until theA 600 of the culture reached one. All the following procedures were carried out at 4 °C, unless otherwise stated. The cells were harvested, washed with 1 mm EDTA, and disrupted by vortexing 4 times for 2 min each with 5 ml of glass beads in 20 ml the breaking solution containing 0.5 m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA with 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. After centrifugation at 1,500 × g for 5 min, the supernatant was collected and transferred to 33 PC tubes (Hitachi). The membrane fraction was collected by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 30 min in an RP70T rotor (Hitachi) with Himac CP 65β (Hitachi). The resultant pellet was suspended with a membrane buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mmEDTA, 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 33% glycerol, homogenized with a Dounce homogenizer, and stored at −80 °C. Purification of GS was carried out by product entrapment as described previously (6Qadota H. Python C.P. Inoue S.B. Arisawa M. Anraku Y. Zheng Y. Watanabe T. Levin D.E. Ohya Y. Science. 1996; 272: 279-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar) with some modifications. GS was solubilized from the membrane fraction by adding 0.2 m NaCl, 20 µm GTPγS, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5% CHAPS, and 0.1% cholesteryl hemisuccinate. This suspension was left on ice for 20 min and centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 30 min. The supernatant was collected (“the detergent fraction”), to which 2.5 mm UDP-Glc and 20 mm potassium fluoride were added, and was subsequently incubated for 45 min at 30 °C. The white polymer of 1,3-β-glucan was collected by a 5-min centrifugation at 1,500 × g at 4 °C. The pellet was washed 3 times with extraction buffer (4 µm GTPγS, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 0.5% CHAPS, and 0.1% cholesteryl hemisuccinate in membrane buffer) containing 5 mm UDP-Glc and was centrifuged at 4,750 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. The resultant pellet was centrifuged again at 421,000 × gfor 10 min at 4 °C. The tight pellet was homogenized in the extraction buffer and the purified GS fraction was recovered in the supernatant after re-centrifugation at 421,000 × g for 10 min. GS activity was measured as formerly reported (4Douglas C.M. Foor F. Marrinan J.A. Morin N. Nielsen J.B. Dahl A.M. Mazur P. Baginsky W. Li W. El-Sherbeini M. Clemas J.A. Mandala S.M. Frommer B.R.

To the detergent fraction that was solubilized with CHAPS and cholesteryl hemisuccinate, 0.1 mg/ml trypsin was added. After a 1-h incubation on ice, trypsin digestion was stopped by addition of 0.2 mg/ml trypsin inhibitor. The samples were then heated to 100 °C for 20 min. Plasma membranes (18Panaretou B. Piper P.

Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 163-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar) were assayed in gradient fractions as described previously. Sphingolipids were extracted from [3H]serine-labeled cells as described (11Oh C.S. Toke D.A. Mandala S. Martin C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17376-17384Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). Radioactive bands were quantified and visualized with FLA-2000 (Fuji Photo Film) using a tritium screen. Sphingolipids were extracted from non-labeled cells as follows. Cultures of 1 liter each were grown at 25 °C until the A 600 of each culture reached one. Cells were washed with 1 mm EDTA, suspended in 15 ml of breaking solution as described above and disrupted with 5 ml of glass beads by vortexing 4 times for 2 min. After addition of 30 ml of methanol and 15 ml of CHCl3, lipids were extracted according to the method of Bligh and Dyer (33Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (42352) Google Scholar). After removal of cell debris and glass beads by centrifugation at 1,500 × g for 20 min, 12 ml of H2O, and 15 ml of CHCl3 were added to the supernatant. Protein was removed by centrifuging at 1,500 ×g for 20 min. The lower layer was washed 3 times with 90 ml of CHCl3, methanol, 0.1 m EDTA, 0.1m EGTA, pH 7.0 (2:2:5, v/v), and was dried with a vacuum evaporator. Half of the lipid extract was subjected to mild alkaline methanolysis by incubating with 3 ml of the monomethylamine reagent as prepared by Clarke and Dawson (34Clarke N.G. Dawson R.M. Biochem. J. 1981; 195: 301-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar) for 1 h at 52 °C. The resultant alkali-stable lipids were dried under a N2stream, resuspended in 0.1 ml of chloroform/methanol (2:1 by volume), and applied to Whatman Linear K6D silica gel TLC plates. The plates were developed with CHCl3, methanol, 30% NH4OH (9:7:2, v/v) or CHCl3, methanol, 4.2 nNH4OH (9:7:2, v/v). We preferred the 30% NH4OH solvent system since mass spectrometric analysis revealed that the PHS fraction obtained using the 4.2 n NH4OH solvent system contained degraded products of PHS or DHS. The mass spectrometric analysis was performed with Ion Trap LC/MS esquire 3000 (Nippon Bruker Daltonics). The fluorescent intensities of sphingolipids were quantified and visualized with LAS-1000plus (Fuji Photo Film) after spraying with primuline (Pfaltz & Bauer Inc.). Procedures for immunofluorescence microscopy were as described previously (35Pringle J. Adams A. Drubin D. Haarer B. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 565-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (600) Google Scholar). Anti-HA (16B12, BAbCO), and anti-Kar2p antibodies were used as primary antibodies. Cells were observed under the Olympus BX-FLA microscope (Olympus, Tokyo). To characterize the reduced GS activity in the membrane fraction ofΔgns1 cells, we determined theK m and V max values of GS activity. A kinetic analysis of GS activity revealed that theΔgns1 mutant has a decreasedV max value, one-fifth that of wild-type cells, while the K m value was not significantly changed (Table I). These results indicate that the reduced GS activity in the Δgns1 mutant is due to the reduced maximum velocity. At least three possibilities are raised based on this observation: (i) the amount of GS diminishes, (ii) an activator of GS decreases, or (iii) an inhibitor of GS accumulates in the membrane fraction of the Δgns1mutant.Table IKm and Vmax values of GS activityStrainK mV maxmmnmol/min/mg proteinWild-type0.37 ± 0.122.92 ± 0.44Δgns10.33 ± 0.060.54 ± 0.01K m and V max values were determined by s/v∼v plot. Average ± S.D. of four independent experiments. Open table in a new tab K m and V max values were determined by s/v∼v plot. Average ± S.D. of four independent experiments. To test the first possibility, we measured the total amounts of Fks1p and Rho1p in Δgns1 cells. Immunoblotting analyses demonstrated that the Fks1p and Rho1p levels in the membrane fraction of Δgns1 cells were indistinguishable from those of wild-type cells (data not shown). InΔgns1 cells, Fks1p and Rho1p exhibited a normal localization pattern (6Qadota H. Python C.P. Inoue S.B. Arisawa M. Anraku Y. Zheng Y. Watanabe T. Levin D.E. Ohya Y. Science. 1996; 272: 279-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar): both are placed at the growing tip of the bud (data not shown). These results suggested that the amount of GS localized to the plasma membrane was not altered inΔgns1 cells. We also examined whether or not Gns1p is a component of the GS complex using a strain expressing Gns1p tagged at its C terminus with 3 repeats of the influenza hemagglutinin (3HA) epitope (Gns1:3HAp). A low-copy plasmid expressing Gns1:3HAp was introduced to theΔgns1 strain. The membrane fraction ofΔgns1 cells expressing Gns1:3HAp exhibited a normal level of GS activity (data not shown), showing that Gns1:3HAp is fully functional. GS was purified by extraction from the membrane fraction followed by product entrapment (see “Experimental Procedures”). In the purified GS fraction with more than 300-fold increase in specific activity (Fig.1 A), the regulatory subunit, Rho1p, was greatly enriched while Gns1:3HAp was apparently lost (Fig.1 B). Examinations of the subcellular localization of Gns1:3HAp by immunofluorescent microscopy revealed that Gns1:3HAp was mainly localized to the ER (Fig. 1 C), exhibiting a localization pattern different from those of Fks1p and Rho1p (6Qadota H. Python C.P. Inoue S.B. Arisawa M. Anraku Y. Zheng Y. Watanabe T. Levin D.E. Ohya Y. Science. 1996; 272: 279-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar). These results strongly suggested that Gns1p is not a tightly bound component of the GS complex. Although we did not rule out the possibility that Gns1p activates GS, we obtained strong evidence suggesting that theΔgns1 mutant contains a GS inhibitor(s). We solubilized the membrane fractions of wild-type andΔgns1 mutant cells with detergents and treated with trypsin and heat to digest proteinous components. It was found that the resultant trypsin digest prepared fromΔgns1 cells had an inhibitory activity to GS, while that from the wild-type cells had little inhibitory effect (Fig.2 A). Dixson plots on GS activity showed linearity at 0.2 and 0.3 mm UDP-glucose and that the two lines intersected on the x axis (Fig.2 B). Taken together, the membrane fraction ofΔgns1 cells likely contains a non-proteinous and non-competitive inhibitor(s) of GS. We analyzed the subcellular distribution of the inhibitor(s) in Δgns1 cells. Because inhibitory activity was mainly recovered from the membrane fraction (data not shown), the membrane fraction of Δgns1 cells was further fractionated on a 20–60% linear sucrose gradient by centrifugation. We first determined the distributions of marker enzymes to check organelle distributions along the gradient. ER membranes were distributed in lower density fractions, while the plasma membrane was found in higher density fractions both in wild-type andΔgns1 fractions (Fig.3 A). Each fraction was solubilized with detergents, followed by treatment with trypsin and heat, and was subjected to the inhibition assay. Fractions around the peak of the plasma membrane exhibited little difference in the inhibitory activity between the wild-type andΔgns1 strains. In contrast, lighter fractions of Δgns1 prominently inhibited GS activity (Fig. 3 C). These results suggested that the inhibitor(s) of the Δgns1 mutant is concentrated not in the plasma membrane, but in lighter fractions containing the peak of ER. The Δgns1mutant is defective in elongation of very long chain fatty acids and synthesis of sphingolipids with very long chain fatty acids (11Oh C.S. Toke D.A. Mandala S. Martin C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17376-17384Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). Since the inhibitor(s) accumulated in Δgns1 cells is non-proteinous and mainly localized to the membrane fraction, we hypothesized that the inhibitor(s) is a lipid. To test this idea, we examined whether the total lipid extracted fromΔgns1 cells has an inhibitory activity. It was found that the total lipid extracted from theΔgns1 mutant strikingly inhibited GS activity (Fig. 4), while that extracted from wild-type cells had less inhibitory activity. Furthermore, Fig. 4 shows that the sphingolipid prepared from the total lipid of theΔgns1 mutant by mild alkaline had the same inhibitory activity. These results suggested that the inhibitor(s) accumulated in the Δgns1 cells is mainly present in the sphingolipid fraction. In order to identify which sphingolipid(s) inhibits GS activity, we resolved the sphingolipid fraction from [3H]serine-labeled cells by TLC (11Oh C.S. Toke D.A. Mandala S. Martin C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17376-17384Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). As previously reported (11Oh C.S. Toke D.A. Mandala S. Martin C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17376-17384Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar), the amounts of ceramide, inositol phosphoceramide (IPC), mannosylinositol phosphoceramide (MIPC), and mannosyl diinositolphosphorylceramide (M(IP)2C) decreased in theΔgns1 mutant (Fig.5 A), while both PHS and DHS contents increased 30-fold as compared with those in wild-type cells. Measurements of GS activity in the presence of each sphingolipid demonstrated that the PHS fraction from Δgns1cells strikingly inhibited GS activity (Fig. 5 B). The DHS fraction prepared from Δgns1 cells also inhibited GS activity to some extent. Mutations defective in sphingolipid biosynthesis have been widely studied in S. cerevisiae (Ref. 36Dickson R.C. Lester R.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1438: 305-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar; Fig.6 A). We constructedΔsur2 and Δipt1mutants, both of which affect sphingolipid biosynthesis (37Grilley M.M. Stock S.D. Dickson R.C. Lester R.L. Takemoto J.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11062-11068Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 38Haak D. Gable K. Beeler T. Dunn T. J. Biol.

Chem. 1997; 272: 29620-29625Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar), and measured their sphingolipid compositions and GS activities.Δsur2 cells contained an increased amount of DHS, while Δipt1 cells contained normal levels of PHS and DHS (Fig. 6 B). GS activity was specifically reduced in the membrane fraction isolated fromΔsur2 cells (Fig. 6 C). These results also suggested that DHS has GS inhibitory activity. Since DPL1 encodes a possible long-chain base-phosphate lyase that catabolizes sphingolipids (Ref. 40Saba J.D. Nara F. Bielawska A. Garrett S. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26087-26090Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar and Fig. 6 A), it is likely that overexpression of DPL1 results in reduced intracellular levels of PHS and DHS (41Grote E. Vlacich G. Pypaert M. Novick P.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 4051-4065Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). In order to test this possibility, we introduced multiple copies of DPL1 to theΔgns1 strain. We found that DPL1overexpression in Δgns1 cells caused a 50% decrease in the amounts of PHS and DHS (Fig.7 A) as well as a reduction in GS inhibition (Fig. 7 B). This result further supported the idea that an accumulation of PHS or DHS or both causes reduced GS activity in the membrane fraction. To examine whether PHS and/or DHS inhibit GS activity, we isolated sphingolipids from wild-type cells, and directly measured their effects on the activity of purified GS. Ceramide, IPC, MIPC, and M(IP)2C did not affect GS activity in the concentration ranges examined. In contrast, PHS and DHS highly inhibited GS activity. The IC50 of PHS was about 0.5 mg/ml (Fig.8 A), which is approximately in the same range as the physiological concentration in theΔgns1 mutant but notably higher than that in wild-type strain (data not shown). Fig. 8 B shows that PHS inhibited GS activity in a non-competitive fashion. DHS also inhibited GS activity non-competitively (Fig. 8 A and data not shown), but the intracellular level of DHS was much lower than that of PHS in wild-type cells (Figs. 5 A and 7 A), suggesting that in vivo PHS is the primary GS inhibitor. Taken together, PHS, the intermediate of sphingolipids that accumulated in the Δgns1 mutant, was judged to be a potent intrinsic inhibitor to GS. In order to investigate the localization of PHS, we measured the PHS contents in purified organelle membranes. The quality of the organelle preparation was monitored by marker enzyme distributions (see “Experimental Procedures”). It was found that each organelle preparation contained only small amounts of other organelles (Table II). 250 µg of sphingolipids extracted from each organelle membrane was subjected to TLC (Fig. 9 A). As previously reported (24Hechtberger P. Zinser E. Saf R. Hummel K. Paltauf F. Daum G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 225: 641-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 42Patton J.L. Lester R. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 3101-3108Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), IPC was mainly localized to the Golgi membrane, while MIPC and M(IP)2C were concentrated in the plasma membrane. Lipid particles contained neither MIPC nor M(IP)2C. Measurements of the fluorescent intensity of the PHS fraction demonstrated that this sphingolipid was largely localized to the microsomal membrane fraction (Fig. 9 B). The localization pattern of PHS in wild-type cells is the same as that of Gns1p (Ref. 12David D. Sundarababu S. Gerst J.E. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1167-1182Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar and Fig. 1 C) and was consistent with the distribution of the inhibitor accumulated inΔgns1 mutant cells.Table IICharacterization of yeast subcellular fractions by specific activities of marker enzymesMarker enzymeOrganelle fractionsNucMSGolgiMitVacLPSVPMNADPH:cytochrome creductase1.14.41.01.71.41.50.61.4GDPase14135151862712Kynurenine hydroxylase0.010.010.000.170.010.000.000.00α-d-Mannosidase6556352151Invertase0.00.00.10.00.00.23.20.0PM ATPase0.10.80.10.20.60.62.55.0NADPH: cytochrome c reductase, GDPase, kynurenine hydroxylase, α-d-mannosidase, invertase, and PM ATPase were used as marker enzymes of the ER, the Golgi, mitochondria, vacuoles, secretory vesicles, and the plasma membrane, respectively.The following abbreviations are used in the table: Nuc, nucleus; MS, microsomes; Mit, mitochondria; Vac, vacuoles; LP, lipid particles; SV, secretory vesicles; PM, plasma membrane.

The following abbreviations are used in the table: Nuc, nucleus; MS, microsomes; Mit, mitochondria; Vac, vacuoles; LP, lipid particles; SV, secretory vesicles; PM, plasma membrane. It was previously found that the membrane fraction ofΔgns1 cells exhibits reduced GS activity (10El-Sherbeini M. Clemas J.A. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 3227-3234Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In this study, several lines of evidence indicated that an accumulation of PHS in the Δgns1 mutant causes non-competitive inhibition of GS activity. First,Δgns1 cells accumulated a non-competitive and non-proteinous inhibitor(s) in the membrane fraction. Second, theΔgns1 mutant accumulated PHS, which was discovered to inhibit GS non-competitively. Among the six sphingolipids examined, PHS was clearly the most potent GS inhibitor. Third, the localization of PHS to the ER was identical to that of the inhibitor accumulated in Δgns1 cells. Fourth,DPL1 overexpression partially lowered the level of PHS accumulated in the Δgns1 cells, resulting in reduced inhibition of GS. Thus, our results are consistent with the idea that PHS negatively regulates GS activity. PHS inhibits GS activity non-competitively in several possible ways. First, PHS may repress the interaction between Fks1p and Rho1p. For instance, PHS may form a microdomain around Fks1p to inhibit the interaction with the prenylated form of Rho1p required for GS activity (43Inoue S.B. Qadota H. Arisawa M. Watanabe T. Ohya Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 38119-38124Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). It has been reported that the particular lipid fraction isolated from mammalian cells contains glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored proteins (44Schroeder R.J. Ahmed S.N. Zhu Y. London E. Brown D.A.

Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 997-1008Crossref PubMed Scopus (841) Google Scholar), but does not include prenylated proteins (47Melkonian K.A. Ostermeyer A.G. Chen J.Z. Roth M.G. Brown D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3910-3917Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar). Likewise, a particular lipid microdomain containing PHS possibly excludes prenylated Rho1p, preventing its interaction with Fks1p. Alternatively, PHS may alter the environment of lipid bilayer, causing inactivation of GS. The physicochemical state of lipid bilayer plays an important role in the activities of a number of enzymes (48Gennis R.B. Biomembranes: Molecular Structure and Function. Springer-Verlag, New York1989: 199-234Crossref Google Scholar). Since wild-type cells contain PHS on the ER membrane, it is likely that PHS inhibits GS activity on the ER. Many membrane-bound proteins localized to the plasma membrane are synthesized on the ER and transported through the secretory pathway (49Govindan B. Novick P. J. Exp. Zool. 1995; 273: 401-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Fks1p, a putative catalytic subunit of GS, accumulated in intracellular organelles when vesicular transport was blocked by secmutations, 2M. Abe, H. Oadota, and Y. Ohya, unpublished results. suggesting that Fks1p is transported along this pathway to the plasma membrane after its synthesis on the ER. Furthermore, the GS activity was reduced in the membrane fraction of sec12-1, sec16-2, andsec21-1 cells,2 all of which are defective in transport from the ER to the Golgi at the restrictive temperature (50Novick P. Ferro S. Schekman R. Cell. 1981; 25: 461-469Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar,51Kaiser C.A. Schekman R. Cell. 1990; 61: 723-733Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (539) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the reduction in GS activity in the secmutants is diminished by overexpression ofDPL1.2 These results raise a possibility that a basal level of PHS residing in the ER functions to prevent nascent GS from being activated in the ER. If this is the case, it is the first example suggesting that a sphingolipid is involved in the inactivation of an enzyme at a specific organelle. In the case of many yeast enzymes that remain inactive until transported to their specific organelles, activation of enzymes is brought about by a modification or cleavage of their precursors. N-Glycosylation is required for activation of invertase (52Chu F.K. Watorek W. Maley F. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1983; 233: 543-555Crossref Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 53Esmon P, C. Esmon B.E.

Biochem. J. 1994; 304: 917-922Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar), both of which are then transported to the plasma membrane. The N-linked oligosaccharide has been shown to affect the activities of these enzymes by stabilizing protein-protein interactions or by altering the affinity to their substrates. Peptide cleavage is required for activation of vacuolar enzymes such as proteinase A (55Wolff A.M. Din N. Petersen J.G. Yeast. 1996; 12: 823-832Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) and carboxypeptidase Y (56Stevens T. Esmon B. Schekman R.

GPI-anchored proteins are recruited to glycosphingolipid/cholesterol-rich membrane microdomains (4Friedrichson T. Kurzchalia T.V.

Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 997-1008Crossref PubMed Scopus (845) Google Scholar), where they may interact functionally with molecules involved in intracellular signal transduction; this is, for example, the case of the APP protein, the precursor of the β-amyloid peptide that forms amyloid deposits in Alzheimer's disease (7Mouillet-Richard S. Ermonval M. Chebassier C. Laplanche J.L. Lehmann S. Launay J.M. Kellermann O. Science. 2000; 289: 1925-1928Crossref PubMed Scopus (678) Google Scholar). GPI anchoring also seems to be directly related with the pathological misfolding of the PrP prion protein (8Lehmann S. Harris D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24589-24597Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Glypiation, the process of GPI addition, implies the cleavage of a C-terminal peptide and the concerted linkage of a preassembled GPI anchor, forming an amide bond between an ethanolamine moiety and the carboxylic group of the ω residue, at the C terminus of the mature protein. The structural requirements of the C-terminal signal peptides that induce GPI addition have been investigated extensively by the groups of Caras and Udenfriend, by mutagenesis of the “decay-accelerating factor” (9Caras I.W. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 113: 77-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 10Moran P. Caras I.W. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 1595-1600Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 11Moran P. Caras I.W. J.

They showed that glypiation requires a C-terminal hydrophobic sequence and an upstream cleavage/addition site (2Ferguson M.A.J. Williams A.F. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1988; 57: 285-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (952) Google Scholar, 13Micanovic R. Gerber L.D. Berger J. Kodukula K. Udenfriend S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 157-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The two groups found that positions ω and ω + 1 (according to the group of Caras) or ω and ω + 2 (according to the group of Udenfriend) must be occupied by residues with small side chains. In addition, Caras and colleagues found that, for optimal processing, the ω site should be located between 10 and 12 residues upstream of the C-terminal hydrophobic sequence (10Moran P. Caras I.W. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 1595-1600Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). A systematic analysis of all reported GPI-anchored proteins and of the effects of mutations in their C-terminal region has led Eisenhaber et al. (18Eisenhaber B. Bork P. Eisenhaber F. Protein Eng. 1998; 11: 1155-1161Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19Eisenhaber B. Bork P. Eisenhaber F. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 292: 741-758Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar) to formulate a prediction algorithm, which confirmed that the volumes of the side chains located near the cleavage site exert a major influence, probably because they must be accommodated within the catalytic pocket of a transamidase (15Maxwell S.E. Ramalingam S. Gerber L.D. Udenfriend S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1550-1554Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Several components of the transamidase complex have recently been cloned (20Riezman H. Conzelmann A. Barrett A.J. Rawlings N.D. Woessner J.F. Handbook of Proteolytic Enzymes.

In mammals, acetylcholinesterase (AChE; EC 3.1.1.7) subunits containing the alternative C-terminal peptide H (AChEH) produce GPI-anchored dimers (22Massoulié J. Pezzementi L. Bon S. Krejci E.

Commun. 1985; 129: 312-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar); this peptide is sufficient to induce the addition of a GPI anchor when added to a foreign protein (26Duval N. Krejci E. Grassi J. Coussen F. Massoulié J. Bon S. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3255-3261Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The sequences encoded by the alternative H exons of Torpedo and rat AChEs contain one or two cysteines, which form intersubunit disulfide bonds in AChE dimers, and hydrophobic C-terminal regions of 15 or 19 residues. Otherwise, the sequences ofTorpedo and mammalian H peptides do not appear homologous and may have arisen independently in the AChE genes (23Massoulié J. Anselmet A. Bon S. Krejci E. Legay C. Mayat E. Morel N. Simon S. Doctor B.P. Quinn D.M. Rotundo R.L. Taylor P. Structure and Function of Cholinesterases and Related Proteins. Plenum Press, New York1998: 3-24Crossref Google Scholar). By introducing threonines at different positions in TorpedoAChE, Bucht and Hjalmarsson found that the last two of a group of three consecutive serines (Ser7–Ser9) could function as ω sites (27Bucht G. Hjalmarsson K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1292: 223-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). In the case of mammalian AChE, biochemical analyses of C-terminal peptides from the human erythrocyte enzyme showed that the GPI anchor is linked to glycine 14 in the H peptide (28Roberts W.L. Rosenberry T.L. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 3091-3098Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 29Haas R. Brandt P.T. Knight J. Rosenberry T.L.

J. 1996; 314: 817-825Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). In the present work, the H peptide of rat AChE was mutated or replaced by Torpedo or composite C-terminal regions, and we report the effects of these modifications on the production of GPI-anchored AChE, on the level of active AChE in cells, and on its secretion in the culture medium. The cDNA encoding the rat AChE subunit was inserted in the pEF-BOS vector, under the control of the human EF-10c promotor (31Mizushima S. Nagata S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 5322Crossref PubMed Scopus (1502) Google Scholar). Site directed mutagenesis was performed as described previously (32Bon S. Massoulié J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3007-3015Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). In the case of rat AChE with chimericTorpedo/rat C-terminal peptides, we removed the noncoding regions, so that all constructs were identical, except for the 3′ sequence, encoding the C-terminal peptides. For transfections, DNA was purified on Nucleobond AX columns (Macherey-Nagel). COS-7 cells were transfected by the diethylaminoethyl-dextran method, as described previously (33Selden R.F. Howie K.B. Rowe M.E. Goodman H.M. Moore D.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1986; 6: 3173-3179Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar). For cultures of transfected cells, the fetal calf serum and the Nu-serum were treated with soman (10−6m) to block irreversibly any cholinesterase activity; this treatment was performed at least 1 week before use, so that excess soman was hydrolyzed during storage at 4 °C. The cells were usually extracted 2 or 3 days after transfection. The cells were extracted with TMg buffer (1% Triton X-100, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mmMgCl2) at 20 °C, because the sphingolipid/cholesterol microdomains are partially insoluble in Triton X-100 in the cold. For PI-PLC digestion, detergent extracts were incubated in TMg buffer for 1 h at 30 °C with 3 units/ml of PI-PLC from Bacillus thuringiensis (Glyko Europe, Upper Heyford, United Kingdom). To ensure that digestion was complete, some samples were incubated a second time, after the addition of the same quantity of fresh PI-PLC. Control extracts were incubated in the same conditions without PI-PLC. Solubilization of cell surface GPI-anchored AChE was performed by treating intact cells with the same concentration of PI-PLC for 20 min at 37 °C; the released activity was assayed in the medium after centrifugation at 17,000 × g for 15 min to remove cell debris. The AChE activity was assayed by the colorimetric method of Ellmanet al. (34Ellman G.L. Courtney K.D. Andres V. Featherstone R.M. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1961; 7: 88-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (21500) Google Scholar). Enzyme samples (10 µl) were added to 0.2 ml of Ellman assay medium, and the reaction kinetics was monitored at 414 nm, at 15-s intervals for 3 min, using a Multiskan RC microplate reader (Labsystems, Helsinki, Finland). All mutants were expressed at least five times and most were expressed more than 10 times in independent transfections that included different sets of mutants used for various comparisons; experimental variations in the relative levels of activity and the fraction of PI-PLC-sensitive AChE did not exceed 15%. The indicated values were obtained from a representative experiment that included all mutants shown in a given table or figure. Aliquots of extracts were equilibrated with 1% Brij-96, loaded on 5–20% sucrose gradients in 1% Brij-96, 10 mm MgCl2, 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.Escherichia coli β-galactosidase (16 S) and alkaline phosphatase (6.1 S) were included as internal sedimentation standards. The gradients were centrifuged for 18 h at 36,000 rpm in a SW-41 rotor, at 5 °C. Fractions of 300 µl were collected and assayed for AChE, β-galactosidase and alkaline phosphatase activities. Electrophoresis of active AChE was performed in nondenaturing conditions, in 7.5% horizontal polyacrylamide gels, in the presence of detergent, as described by Bonet al. (35Bon S. Toutant J.P. Méflah K. Massoulié J. J. Neurochem. 1988; 51: 786-794Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). AChE activity was revealed after electrophoresis by the method of Karnovsky and Roots (36Karnovsky M.J. Roots L. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1964; 12: 219-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (2996) Google Scholar). The gels were scanned and quantified with the TINA software (version 2.07d, Raytest Isotopenmessgeräte GmbH) to determine the relative intensities of each band. The percentage of lytic nonamphiphilic component preexisting before PI-PLC treatment (L) and of PI-PLC-resistant amphiphilic component (R) were determined from the profiles obtained for control and PI-PLC-treated samples, respectively; the fraction of GPI-anchored AChE was obtained as 100% − (L + R). Two days after transfection, COS cells were preincubated for 45 min in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium without cysteine and methionine and labeled for the indicated time with 150 mCi/100-mm dish of [35S]methionine/cysteine (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). After labeling, the cells were rinsed with PBS and chased in medium containing Nu-serum. AChE from cell extracts or medium was immunoadsorbed on protein G immobilized on Sepharose 4B Fast Flow beads (Sigma). The beads were first washed and saturated with 5% bovine serum albumin in a buffer containing 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.05% Nonidet P-40. Samples (90 µl) of cell extracts or media were incubated with 40 µl of a 10% suspension of beads for 3 h to eliminate nonspecific adsorption and the beads were discarded. The samples were then incubated with 1:500 A63 anti-AChE antiserum (37Marsh D. Grassi J. Vigny M. Massoulié J. J. Neurochem. 1984; 43: 204-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) or with 1:250 anti-FLAG M2 monoclonal antibodies (Eastman Kodak Co.), overnight at 8 °C, with gentle agitation on a rotating wheel; 80 µl of a 10% suspension of bovine serum albumin-saturated washed beads was then added and incubated for 1 h. After immunoadsorption, the beads were washed three times with 1 ml of buffer containing 1% Triton X-100, with centrifugations at 17,000 × g for 5 min. All incubations were performed at 8 °C under mild rotatory agitation. For polyacrylamide electrophoresis under denaturing conditions, samples of the washed beads were resuspended in 30 µl of 0.125 mTris-HCl buffer, pH 6.8, containing 1% SDS, 0.002% bromphenol blue, 5% mercaptoethanol, heated at 98 °C for 5 min, and centrifuged at 17,000 × g for 5 min at room temperature. Aliquots (10 µl) of the supernatant were submitted to electrophoresis in SDS-polyacrylamide gels, and the resulting bands were analyzed in a Fuji image analyzer (BAS 1000) or by autoradiography. The predictor is accessible on the World Wide Web (19Eisenhaber B. Bork P. Eisenhaber F. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 292: 741-758Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). The H peptides correspond to amino acids 536–577 of rat AChE and 536–566 of TorpedoAChE (numbering of Torpedo AChE), but for simplicity we use numbering from their first residue (TablesIandII). The rat H peptide contains two cysteines (Cys6 and Cys8), each of which is sufficient for the formation of disulfide-linked GPI-anchored dimers. 2S. Bon, unpublished result. The structure of the mutants is shown in Tables I, II, andIII. Mutations that were restricted to the C-terminal peptide did not modify the catalytic activity of rat AChE. Mutants containing a GPI signal derived from the rat H peptide are designated rm2 to rm44 (for “rat mutant,” rm1 being the wild type). Mutants rm2–rm40 contain mutations around the ω site and sometimes minor insertions or deletions. Mutants rm41–rm43 were deleted to place the ω site at the position of Cys6. The rm44 mutant contains an internal FLAG peptidic epitope. The FLAG peptide was also added at the C terminus of some mutants (rm1-f, rm5-f, rm13-f, and rm18-f). The Torpedo H peptide is totally different from that of rat; mutagenesis showed that each of its first three consecutive serines (residues 542–544) can serve as an ω site. The catalytic domain of rat AChE was associated with Torpedoand with chimeric rat/Torpedo GPI addition signals (rr, rt, tr, and tt), which were made in long (L) and short (S) versions, by insertion or deletion of five residues (Table II, top). Composite constructs (cc) contained modified TorpedoGPI-addition signals (Table II, bottom). Finally, we analyzed mutants in which a few residues of the catalytic domain were deleted, to reduce the distance between the α10 helix and the ω site (Table III). Throughout, we indicate the immediate peptidic environment of the putative ω site (ω − 1/ω + 3), underlining the ω site itself or underlining its position when it is inactivated.Table IStructure of the modified rat GPI addition signalsNameω − 1/ω + 3MutationsCommentsCell. act.Glyp.Secr. act.Score%%%rm1HGEAAWild typeProline at 40, as in mouse100751006.7rm1′HGEAAC8SWild type with only the first cysteine100751006.2rm1“HGEAAS25PSuppression of a potential ω site at Ser25100751005.2rm2HPEAAG14PSuppression of the natural ω site Gly14312111−3rm3HPEAAG14S/S25PSuppression of the two preceding sites242211−4.7rm4HGEPAA16PProline at ω + 219327−3.9rm5HGEAAA12TThreonine at ω − 29661536.7rm6HPEAAT7P/G14P/S25PProlines at 7, 14, and 2520911−4.3rm7HPEPAG14P/A16P/S25PProlines at 14, 16, and 251527−5.2rm8HGNASE15N/A17SPotentialN-glycosylation site at ω + 1917011311.6rm9HGNAAE15NNon glycosylable control of rm81096511114rm10HGEASA17SNon glycosylable control of rm886621277.3rm11HNEAAG14NReplacement of Gly by Asn at the ω site112681046.7rm12HNESGNESGT at 14–18, S25PPotentialN-glycosylation at ω site127661736.8Nameω − 1/ω + 3CommentsCell. act.Glyp.Secr. act.Scorerm13PSPTRMutant showing essentially no glypiation250.411−3.4rm14ESGSRSGS at ω/ω + 1/ω + 27565226.5rm15ESGTRSGT at ω/ω + 1/ω + 25654206.9rm16ESEGRSEG at ω/ω + 1/ω + 2 (breaks the ω + 1 rule)3021164.6rm17ESGERSGE at ω/ω + 1/ω + 2 (breaks the ω + 2 rule)302916−4.2rm18EGGTRGGT at ω/ω + 1/ω + 23125164.1rm19EGEARGEA at ω/ω + 1/ω + 2 (as in the wild type)197.591.6rm20ECEARCEA at ω/ω + 1/ω + 2250.992.4rm21PSGTRLike rm15, but with proline at ω − 15354183.6rm22ESGTPEffect of a proline at ω + 2 (compare with rm15)115752227.3rm23HNGGREffect of an histidine at ω − 1 (compare with rm28)137671025.8rm24HCGGREffect of a cysteine at ω (compare with rm41)2512166.0rm25ESGSSSGS at ω/ω + 1/ω + 2 (nonglycosylable control of rm26)12375228.1rm26ENGSRPotentialN-glycosylation at the engineered ω site8762224.9rm27EGGSRNonglycosylable control of rm263030184.4rm28ENGGRNonglycosylable control of rm268762227.0rm29ETGGRSuppression of the preceding ω site by a threonine111691.2rm30HGGSREffect of an histidine at ω − 1 (compare with rm27)7656424.4rm31HSGTREffect of an histidine at ω − 1 (compare with rm15)142721165.0rm32HGEAREffect of an histidine at ω − 1 (compare with rm19)404036−0.4rm33CGEAREffect of a cysteine at ω − 1 (compare with rm19)363418−2.0rm34KGEAREffect of a lysine at ω − 1 (compare with rm19)8856491.3Nameω − 1/ω + 3Sequence of ω regionCommentsCell. act.Glyp.Secr. act.Scorerm35HNGGRPCTCPSPAH––NGGRPGPALPResidues preceding ω as in wild type112801076.7rm36HGEAAPCTCPSPAHGEAAPRPGPA––Reduced spacer after ω84661110.5rm37HGSSPPCTCPSPAH–––GSSPGPALPω and upstream as in wild type5666716.2rm38HGNAPPCTCPSPAH–––GNAPGPALPω and upstream as in wild type93651133.4rm39ENGGRPCTCPSPAHGPENGGRPGPALPWild type sequence upstream of ω6766367.2rm40ETGGRPCTCPSPAHGPETGGRPGPALPSuppression of preceding ω site3732181.4rm41HCGGR––––––––––HCGGRPGPALPDisulfide bond by ω site cysteine?2575406.5rm42HNGGR––––––––––HNGGRPGPALPControl of preceding: no cysteine97901116.3rm43HTGGR––––––––––HTGGRPGPALPControl of rm41, suppression of ω3165430.6rm44HGEAAPCTCPSPAHGEAAPRPGPInsertion of FLAG peptide upstream of the346028−19.5DYKDDDDKALShydrophobic regionThe C-terminal peptides of mutants rm1 to rm44 are derived from the rat H peptide, except that the third residue before the C terminus is a proline rather than an arginine, as in mice (48Li Y.

The GPI addition signal is composed of intervening regions (located between the cysteine and the hydrophobic region) and hydrophobic regions from rat (r) orTorpedo (t).

These chimeric peptides were added downstream of Cys6 from the rat H peptide, so that the formation of an intersubunit disulfide bond should be identical in all cases.

To identify additional regulators of the pheromone signaling apparatus in yeast, we evaluated an array of 120 likely protein kinases encoded by the yeast genome. Each kinase was fused to glutathione S-transferase, overexpressed, and tested for changes in pheromone responsiveness in vivo. As expected, several known components of the pathway (YCK1,STE7, STE11, FUS3, andKSS1) impaired the growth arrest response. Seven other kinases also interfered with pheromone-induced growth arrest; in rank order they are as follows: YKL116c (renamed PRR1) = YDL214c (renamed PRR2) > YJL141c (YAK1,SRA1) > YNR047w = YCR091w (KIN82) = YIL095w (PRK1) > YCL024w (KCC4). Inhibition of pheromone signaling byPRR1, but not PRR2, required the glutathioneS-transferase moiety. Both kinases inhibited gene transcription after stimulation with pheromone, a constitutively active kinase mutant STE11-4, or overexpression of the transcription factor STE12. Neither protein altered the ability of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) Fus3 to feedback phosphorylate a known substrate, the MAPK kinase Ste7.

In humans, G protein-coupled receptors respond to hormones, neurotransmitters, odors, taste, and light. In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, G protein-linked pheromone receptors trigger events required for mating and cell fusion. Upon activation of the receptor (Ste2 or Ste3 in yeast), GTP binds to the G protein α subunit (Gpa1), which triggers its dissociation from the G protein βγ subunits (Ste4/Ste18). Gβγ in turn activates a protein kinase cascade comprised of Ste20, Ste11, Ste7, and Fus3 (1Gustin M.C. Albertyn J. Alexander M. Davenport K. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1998; 62: 1264-1300Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Ste5 promotes signaling, through the assembly and recruitment of Ste11, Ste7, and Fus3, to the activating G protein, as well as to effector targets within the nucleus (2Elion E.A. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 2000; 3: 573-581Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). Sst2 promotes signal inactivation by accelerating Gpa1 GTPase activity and promoting subunit reassembly (3Dohlman H.G. Song J.

The casein kinase I isoforms (Yck1, Yck2) promote signal inactivation by phosphorylating receptors, triggering their uptake and degradation (4Hicke L. Zanolari B. Riezman H. J.

A central player in the kinase cascade is Fus3, a member of the MAPK1 family. In mammals, MAPKs can respond to a variety of signaling molecules and chemical or physical stresses (temperature, salt, etc.) (16Chang L. Karin M. Nature. 2001; 410: 37-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (4420) Google Scholar). MAPKs in turn regulate almost all aspects of cell growth and homeostasis. In yeast, the MAPK Fus3 phosphorylates and regulates proteins required for pheromone detection (Ste3), kinase scaffolding and activation (Ste5) (17Kranz J.E. Satterberg B. Elion E.A.

Chem. 1999; 274: 36387-36391Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). In most cases, phosphorylation by Fus3 leads to enhanced signal transduction, but in a few instances phosphorylation promotes signal attenuation or desensitization. For instance, phosphorylation of the receptor Ste3 leads to its endocytosis and degradation (28Feng Y. Davis N.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 563-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of Sst2 leads to its stabilization and to further inactivation of the G protein (27Garrison T.R. Zhang Y. Pausch M. Apanovitch D. Aebersold R. Dohlman H.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36387-36391Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Thus Fus3 allows a coordinated response to pheromone in preparation for cell fusion, with both positive and negative outcomes for signaling. The completion of the yeast genome sequence has yielded a complete inventory of 6144 open reading frames. Of these, 123 are likely to encode protein kinases, many of which have not been characterized. Given the prominent role that kinases have in G protein signaling and desensitization, we undertook a comprehensive screen of these proteins for those affecting the pheromone response in yeast. Here we describe two novel regulators of the G protein/MAPK cascade, which we have designated Prr1 and Prr2. Standard methods for the growth, maintenance, and transformation of yeast and bacteria, and for the manipulation of DNA, were used throughout (29Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1987Google Scholar). The yeastS. cerevisiae strains used in this study were EJ 758 (MATa his3-200, leu2-3, 112,ura3-52, pep4::URA3) (30Martzen M.R. McCraith S.M. Spinelli S.L. Torres F.M. Fields S. Grayhack E.J. Phizicky E.M.

The following steps were used for construction by gene replacement of strain C699–32 from strain C699 (identical to strain W303–1A) (from K. Nasmyth). The BAR1 locus was replaced with thebar1Δ::HisG::URA3::HisG allele from the plasmid C1329 (from K. Nasmyth). Loss of theURA3 marker was carried out by selection on 5-fluororotic acid-containing medium (31Boeke J.D. Trueheart J. Natsoulis G. Fink G.R. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 154: 164-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (1083) Google Scholar, 32Alani E. Cao L. Kleckner N. Genetics. 1987; 116: 541-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (752) Google Scholar). EcoRI-linearized pNC276 2B. Errede, unpublished data. was used for integration of the FUS1-lacZ reporter gene at theleu2 locus. Finally, the STE7 locus was replaced with the ste7Δ::ADE2 allele from pSL2270 (33Printen J.A. Sprague Jr., G.F. Genetics. 1994; 138: 609-619Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For expression of kinase-GST fusions, plasmid pYEX 4T-2 (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA) (2 µ, CUP1promoter, URA3 and leu2-d, ampR, GST) was modified by the addition of a 140-nucleotide recombination domain, 3′ of its EcoRI site, linearized within the recombination domain by restriction digestion, and cotransformed with polymerase chain reaction-amplified open reading frames that had the same ends as the linearized plasmid, as described previously (34Hudson Jr., J.R. Dawson E.P. Rushing K.L. Jackson C.H. Lockshon D. Conover D. Lanciault C. Harris J.R. Simmons S.J. Rothstein R. Fields S. Genome Res. 1997; 7: 1169-1173Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). For overexpression without GST, each open reading frame was polymerase chain reaction-amplified using Genepair primers (Research Genetics, Huntsville, AL), which include start and stop codons and a universal flanking sequence, and subcloned into the yeast expression vector pYES2.1/V5-His-TOPO (2 µ, URA3, GAL1 promoter,CYC1 terminator) (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). STE7was expressed as a Myc epitope-tagged protein (Ste7M) using pNC318 (CEN3-ARS1, CYC1 promoter,TRP1, ampR), as described previously (35Zhou Z. Gartner A. Cade R. Ammerer G. Errede B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 2069-2080Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar).STE11-4 was overexpressed using YCp50-STE11-4 (2 µ, URA3, ampR) (from George Sprague, University of Oregon). STE12 was overexpressed using PFILZ-112.1 (TRP1, 2 µ, ampR, GAL1promoter) (from Joseph Dolan, Medical University of South Carolina). The Lys to Arg mutations were constructed using the QuikChange mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The mutagenic oligonucleotides (plus complementary strands; not shown) are 5′-CAT CGT GAT TTA AAG CCC TCC AAC-3′ (FUS3), 5′-GGT CAC CGG CAA TTT GCT GCT GAG TTT ATA GGG-3′ (PRR1), and 5′-CAA AAA CGT AAT TTC CTT ATG TCC AGT TTC-3′ (PRR2). For the pheromone-dependent growth inhibition assay (halo assay), overnight cultures were grown in selective media, and 100 µl was diluted with 2 ml of sterile water, followed by the addition of an equal volume of 1% (w/v) dissolved agar (55 °C), and poured onto an agar plate containing the same medium. Sterile filter discs were spotted with synthetic α-factor pheromone and placed onto the nascent lawn to induce growth arrest. The resulting zone of growth-arrested cells was documented after 2 days. For pheromone-dependent reporter transcription assays (36Trueheart J. Boeke J.D. Fink G.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2316-2328Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar), strains were grown for 36 h in dextrose selective medium and then diluted in galactose selective medium to induce expression of the kinases. Mid-log phase cells were then aliquoted (90 µl) to a 96-well plate and mixed with 10 µl of α-factor for 90 min, in triplicate. β-Galactosidase activity was measured by adding 20 µl of a freshly prepared solution of 83 µm fluorescein di-β-d-galactopyranoside (10 mm stock in Me2SO; Molecular Probes), 137.5 mm PIPES, pH 7.2, 2.5% Triton X-100, and incubating for 90 min at 37 °C. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 20 µl of 1 m Na2CO3, and the resulting fluorescence activity was measured at 485-nm excitation, 530-nm emission. Ste7 phosphorylation was monitored by immunoblotting. Cells were grown in galactose selective medium to induce PRR1,PRR1-KR, PRR2, PRR2-KR,FUS3, and FUS3-KR to a density of 1 × 107 cells per ml. Protein extracts (150 µg) were prepared as described previously (37Pfeifer K. Prezant T. Guarente L. Cell. 1987; 49: 19-27Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 38Pfeifer K. Arcangioli B. Guarente L. Cell. 1987; 49: 9-18Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar), fractionated by SDS-polyacrylamide (10%) gel electrophoresis, and transferred to nitrocellulose using a mini trans-blot electrophoretic transfer cell (Bio-Rad) for 1 h at 110 V. 9E10 monoclonal antibodies (1.4 µg/ml) (39Evan G.I. Lewis G.K. Ramsay G. Bishop J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1985; 5: 3610-3616Crossref PubMed Scopus (2166) Google Scholar) were used to detect the Myc epitope-tagged form of Ste7 (Ste7M). The PromegaProtoblot immunoblot system with anti-mouse IgG alkaline phosphatase conjugate (0.13 µg/ml) was used to detect the primary antibody by calorimetric methods. Protein concentrations were determined using the Bio-Rad protein assay kit. Prr2 homologues were identified with the advanced BLAST algorithm using the Prr2 protein kinase domain as the query (40Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (71456) Google Scholar). Multiple alignments of the Prr2 homologues were performed using CLUSTAL W (41Jeanmougin F. Thompson J.D. Gouy M. Higgins D.G. Gibson T.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 403-405Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2397) Google Scholar) with Phylip set as output. For the visualization of the degree of relatedness among the Prr2 homologues in S. cerevisiae, the CLUSTAL W alignment was imported into TREEVIEW (42Page R.D. Comput. Appl. Biosci. 1996; 12: 357-358PubMed Google Scholar). Nuclear localization signals (NLS) were identified using the Internet version of PSORT II (43Nakai K. Kanehisa M. Genomics. 1992; 14: 897-911Crossref PubMed Scopus (1368) Google Scholar). For the detection of classical NLS patterns, PSORT uses the following two rules: four-residue pattern (pat4) composed of four basic amino acids (Lys or Arg) or composed of three basic amino acids (Lys or Arg) and either His or Pro; the other (pat7) is a pattern starting with Pro and followed within three residues by a basic segment containing Lys/Arg at three of four positions. Another type of NLS pattern (bipartite) is two basic residues, a ten-residue spacer, and another basic region consisting of at least three positions of five basic residues. To identify novel proteins that regulate the mating pathway, we screened an expression array of 120 (of 123 total) protein kinases encoded by the yeast genome. Each open reading frame was fused to GST and overexpressed in a high copy plasmid, using the copper-inducible promoter from CUP1. Most of the 6144 open reading frames are available in this format and are typically tested in arrayed pools containing a defined set of gene products (30Martzen M.R. McCraith S.M. Spinelli S.L. Torres F.M. Fields S. Grayhack E.J. Phizicky E.M. Science. 1999; 286: 1153-1155Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). Because we were primarily interested in finding novel kinase regulators of the pathway, we elected to test this subset of genes individually. Our approach has significant advantages over conventional genetic screening strategies. First, it is quite rapid; each round of screening can be conducted in about 2 weeks. Second, it is highly systematic, allowing us to test nearly all of the likely kinases encoded by the yeast genome, and provides immediate identification of the gene responsible for a particular activity. Third, it is sensitive, because each kinase is strongly overexpressed. Fourth, each open reading frame is fused to GST, which will facilitate eventual purification and biochemical analysis of the encoded kinase. The following strategy was used to identify kinases that promote or inhibit pheromone signaling. Transformed cells were grown to saturation and plated on solid medium containing copper sulfate to induce kinase expression. α-Factor pheromone was spotted onto the nascent lawn, and the resulting zone of growth inhibition was documented after 2–3 days (halo assay). After screening all 120 clones in duplicate, the vast majority yielded no difference in growth. None caused an increase in halo size, whereas a few produced halos that were smaller and/or more turbid than normal. Of these, 12 were selected for further analysis and validation. The following five of the 12 clones encode known kinases of the pathway: YCK1, STE7, STE11,FUS3, and KSS1 (a MAPK that can partially complement FUS3). The only other known kinase in the pathway, STE20, was not included in the screen, because it is one of three genes that could not be cloned into the expression vector. Our ability to identify essentially all of the known kinase components in the pathway indicates that our screening strategy produced few false negatives. Further, recovery of all the expected kinases reinforces the idea that this set is functionally relevant and that the seven other clones identified in the screen are likely to have some role in pheromone signaling. These are as follows, in rank order of inhibitory potency: YKL116c = YDL214c > YJL141c (YAK1, SRA1) > YNR047w = YCR091w (KIN82) = YIL095w (PRK1) > YCL024w (KCC4). Notably, the screen does not reveal whether the other clones recovered here might have a positive or negative role in pheromone signaling. For instance, Ste11 and Ste7 are primarily needed to transmit the pheromone signal, yet each inhibits the response in this overexpression method (see below). Pheromone-induced growth inhibition experiments with representative kinases from the above set are shown in Fig.1. In this and all subsequent figures,FUS3 is used as a positive control, whereas an irrelevant kinase or empty vector is used as a negative control. The two most potent inhibitors were renamed PRR1 (YKL116c) andPRR2 (YDL214c), for pheromoneresponse regulators 1 and 2. Because they had not previously been implicated in the pheromone-response pathway, we focused our attention on their further characterization. The halo assay is a convenient but fairly qualitative measure of pheromone sensitivity. A more quantitative measure of pheromone response can be obtained from analysis of transcriptional induction, using a reporter comprised of the FUS1 promoter andlacZ (β-galactosidase) gene. As shown in Fig.2, overexpression of eitherPRR1 or PRR2 results in a marked inhibition of pheromone-dependent transcription. Compared with the vector control, overexpression of Prr1 or Prr2 reduced the maximum response at 30 µm α-factor by 1.24- and 2.77-fold, respectively, with no change in EC50. Overexpression of our positive control kinase Fus3 yielded an even larger (11.7-fold) decrease in activity, as shown previously (44Bardwell L. Cook J.G. Inouye C.J. Thorner J. Dev. Biol. 1994; 166: 363-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). As noted above, the overexpression assays employed here do not distinguish whether a given kinase has a positive or negative role in pheromone-induced signaling. It was shown previously through systematic gene disruption analysis that neither PRR1 norPRR2 is essential for cell viability (45Winzeler E.A. Shoemaker D.D. Astromoff A. Liang H. Anderson K. Andre B. Bangham R. Benito R. Boeke J.D. Bussey H. Chu A.M. Connelly C. Davis K. Dietrich F. Dow S.W. El Bakkoury M. Foury F. Friend S.H. Gentalen E. Giaever G. Hegemann J.H. Jones T. Laub M. Liao H.

Therefore, the transcription response of deletion mutant strains could be evaluated over a range of α-factor concentrations. As shown in Fig.3, the pheromone response in either theprr1Δ or prr2Δ single mutant is identical to that of the wild-type strain. By contrast, the pheromone response is diminished with the control fus3Δ mutant. Although there is substantial precedent and several reasons for single deletion mutants failing to give a phenotype, this outcome meant that different strategies would be needed to establish whether PRR1 andPRR2 act as positive or negative regulators (see below). To determine where in the pathway Prr1 and Prr2 operate, we examined their ability to inhibit signaling at different points downstream of the pheromone receptor. For this analysis, the pathway was activated in two alternative ways. In the first case, we used an allele of the MAPK kinase kinase STE11 (STE11-4), containing a single amino acid substitution (T596I) within the catalytic domain. Cells expressing STE11-4 exhibit a significant increase in basal signal pathway activity (46Stevenson B.J. Rhodes N. Errede B. Sprague Jr., G.F. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 1293-1304Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). Constitutive activation bySTE11-4 is unaffected by mutations in the receptor (Ste2) or Gβ (Ste4) but is blocked by mutations in the downstream MAPK kinase (Ste7), MAPK (Fus3, Kss1), or transcription factor (Ste12) (46Stevenson B.J. Rhodes N. Errede B. Sprague Jr., G.F. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 1293-1304Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). ThusSTE11-4 activates signaling at a well defined step in the pathway, between Ste20 and Ste7. In the second case, we activated the pathway through expression of STE12 under the control of the inducible GAL1 promoter. STE12 overexpression leads to transcriptional induction in the absence of any upstream components or added pheromone (47Dolan J.W. Fields S. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 492-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 4, Prr1 and Prr2 are both potent inhibitors of transcriptional induction, in response to either STE11-4 (top panel) or STE12overexpression (bottom panel). In agreement with previous reports, our positive control Fus3 is also a potent inhibitor of transcriptional induction (48Farley F.W. Satterberg B. Goldsmith E.J. Elion E.A. Genetics. 1999; 151: 1425-1444PubMed Google Scholar, 49Bardwell L. Cook J.G. Voora D. Baggott D.M. Martinez A.R. Thorner J. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2887-2898Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 50Madhani H.D. Styles C.A. Fink G.R. Cell. 1997; 91: 673-684Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). When overexpressed, a portion of Fus3 is presumably in the unphosphorylated and catalytically inactive state. This pool may interfere with the ability of any activate Fus3 to transmit a signal to Ste12 (48Farley F.W. Satterberg B. Goldsmith E.J. Elion E.A. Genetics. 1999; 151: 1425-1444PubMed Google Scholar). These data show that Prr1 and Prr2 (like Fus3) regulate signaling downstream of Ste11, most likely at the level of Ste12. To determine whether signal inhibition requires the GST moiety, each open reading frame was polymerase chain reaction-amplified and cloned into another vector lacking any fusion protein. As shown in Fig.5, overexpression of Prr2 or Fus3 reduced the maximum response at 30 µm α-factor by 3.1- and 29.7-fold, respectively, compared with the vector control. This level of inhibition is comparable with that observed for the GST fusions (Fig. 2). In contrast, overexpression of Prr1 provided almost no reduction, considerably less than the 1.24-fold reduction observed with Prr1-GST (Fig. 5 versus Fig. 2). Because inhibition by Prr1 is largely dependent on the presence of GST, we cannot rule out the possibility that Prr1 is only active as a GST fusion protein. In contrast, the inhibition by Prr2, like that of Fus3, is independent of the GST moiety. Overexpression of Prr1 or Prr2 could inhibit signaling by at least two different mechanisms. First, overexpression could lead to an enhanced (perhaps unregulated) phosphorylation and inhibition of a pathway component. Second, overexpression of the kinase could lead to reduced phosphorylation of a substrate protein, through competitive binding and inhibition of a needed regulatory subunit or of a substrate protein (see below). To distinguish between these possibilities, we prepared a mutant version of Prr1 and Prr2 that lacks a conserved Lys essential for kinase activity. If the competitive inhibition mechanism applies, wild-type and kinase-dead versions should be equally inhibitory. For example, a kinase-dead form of Fus3 (Fus3K42R) has been reported to inhibit signaling when overexpressed, evidently through its ability to bind and inhibit its substrates in competition with wild-type Fus3 (48Farley F.W. Satterberg B. Goldsmith E.J. Elion E.A. Genetics. 1999; 151: 1425-1444PubMed Google Scholar, 49Bardwell L. Cook J.G. Voora D. Baggott D.M. Martinez A.R. Thorner J. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2887-2898Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 50Madhani H.D. Styles C.A. Fink G.R. Cell. 1997; 91: 673-684Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). Alternatively, if the enhanced phosphorylation mechanism applies, the kinase-dead enzyme should fail to inhibit. As shown in Fig. 6, Fus3K42Rinhibits in this assay. However, the kinase-dead version is slightly less potent than the wild-type counterpart. This outcome suggests that inhibition by Fus3 overexpression involves both competitive and enhanced phosphorylation mechanisms. Likewise, the kinase-dead version of Prr2 is a less potent inhibitor than its wild-type counterpart. This suggests that Prr2, like Fus3, acts through competitive binding, as well as enhanced phosphorylation. By contrast, inhibition by Prr1K225R was equal to that of wild-type Prr1. This result supports the view that Prr1 inhibits the pheromone response primarily through a competitive binding mechanism. The ability to suppress both STE11-4 andGAL1-STE12 indicates that Prr2 operates at the level of the transcription factor Ste12. Ste12 activity depends in part on Fus3 binding and phosphorylation. We therefore examined whether Prr2 inhibits Ste12 indirectly, through inhibition of Fus3. It has been shown previously that pheromone activation results in feedback phosphorylation of Ste7. This reaction provides a particularly convenient indicator of Fus3 activity in vivo, because the resulting hyperphosphorylated species of Ste7 exhibits a markedly reduced mobility (∼10 kDa) on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (35Zhou Z. Gartner A. Cade R. Ammerer G. Errede B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 2069-2080Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Thus we used the Ste7 mobility shift assay to determine whether Prr2 or Prr2K390R can inhibit Fus3 activity. As shown in Fig. 7, pheromone induction caused a typical shift in Ste7 mobility (Fig. 7, lane 1 versus lane 6). As expected, overexpression of either Fus3 or Fus3K42R completely inhibited pheromone-induced Ste7 phosphorylation. In contrast, overexpression of Prr2 or the catalytically inactive derivative Prr2K390R had no effect on Ste7 phosphorylation (Fig. 7, lanes 9 and 10). Overexpression of Prr1 or Prr1K225R similarly had no effect on pheromone-induced feedback phosphorylation of Ste7 (data not shown). These results confirm that inhibition of the pheromone-response pathway by Prr2 (and Prr1) occurs downstream of the MAPK. In recent years a number of eukaryotic genomes have been sequenced, including that of humans, Drosophila melanogaster, Caenorhabditis elegans, and the yeastS. cerevisiae.

We recently isolated TAF145 (one of TFIID subunits) temperature-sensitive mutants in yeast, in which transcription of the TUB2 gene is impaired at restrictive temperatures due to a defect in core promoter recognition. Here, we show in these mutants that the transcription of theRPS5 gene is impaired, mostly due to a defect in transcriptional activation rather than to a defect in core promoter recognition, although the latter is slightly affected as well. Surprisingly, the RPS5 core promoter can be activated by various activation domains fused to a GAL4 DNA binding domain, but not by the original upstream activating sequence (UAS) of theRPS5 gene. In addition, a heterologous CYC1core promoter can be activated by RPS5-UAS at normal levels even in these mutants. These observations indicate that a distinct combination of core promoters and activators may exploit alternative activation pathways that vary in their requirement for TAF145 function. In addition, a particular function of TAF145 that is deleted in our mutants appears to be involved in both core promoter recognition and transcriptional activation.

TATA-binding protein TBP-associated factor upstream activating sequence DNA binding domain polymerase chain reaction base pair(s) In eukaryotes, transcriptional initiation by RNA polymerase II requires a set of general transcriptional factors (reviewed in Refs. 1Roeder R.G.

These factors are assembled in a stepwise manner to form a preinitiation complex on the core promoter (1Roeder R.G. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 327-335Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (718) Google Scholar) or are recruited as a few preassembled units (4Koleske A.J. Young R.A. Trends Biochem.

Hahn S. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 49-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). In either case, the first step in preinitiation complex assembly is the binding of a protein complex called TFIID to the core promoter, which in turn provides a structural platform for the remainder of the general transcriptional factors to be incorporated (6Ranish J.A. Yudkovsky N. Hahn S. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 49-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Previous studies have shown that TFIID-promoter interactions are a major rate-limiting step during transcriptional initiation and therefore are one of the most important molecular targets for transcriptional activators (7Lieberman P.M. Berk A.J. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 995-1006Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar, 8Chi T. Carey M. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2540-2550Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 9Burley S.K. Roeder R.G. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 769-799Crossref PubMed Scopus (628) Google Scholar). TFIID is a multiprotein complex composed of the TATA-binding protein (TBP)1 and ∼10–12 phylogenetically conserved TBP-associated factors (TAFs) (reviewed in Refs. 9Burley S.K. Roeder R.G. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 769-799Crossref PubMed Scopus (628) Google Scholar and 10Albright S.R. Tjian R. Gene. 2000; 242: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). A number of biochemical studies have revealed coactivator and core promoter recognition activities to be two important functions for TAFs (reviewed in Refs. 9Burley S.K. Roeder R.G. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 769-799Crossref PubMed Scopus (628) Google Scholar, 10Albright S.R. Tjian R. Gene. 2000; 242: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar, 11Green M.R. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 59-63Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Earlier experiments using in vitro transcription systems demonstrated that TBP can mediate basal transcription but is unable to support activated transcription by itself. In contrast, TFIID, even when reconstituted with recombinant TBP and TAFs (12Chen J.L. Attardi L.D. Verrijzer C.P. Yokomori K. Tjian R. Cell. 1994; 79: 93-105Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar), mediates both basal and activated transcription, supporting the idea that TAFs are essential cofactors for transcriptional activation (reviewed in Refs. 9Burley S.K. Roeder R.G. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 769-799Crossref PubMed Scopus (628) Google Scholarand 10Albright S.R. Tjian R. Gene. 2000; 242: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). More recent studies have begun to address how core promoters of eukaryotic genes are recognized by TFIID (reviewed in Refs. 13Chalkley G.E. Verrijzer C.P. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4835-4845Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar and14Kutach A.K. Kadonaga J.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 4754-4764Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). The three classes of core promoter elements that are currently known are the TATA element, the initiator, and the downstream promoter element, each of which may serve as a recognition site for distinct TFIID subunits (reviewed in Refs. 13Chalkley G.E. Verrijzer C.P. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4835-4845Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar and 14Kutach A.K. Kadonaga J.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 4754-4764Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). In addition to the extensively characterized TBP-TATA element interactions (15Patikoglou G.A. Kim J.L. Sun L. Yang S.H. Kodadek T. Burley S.K. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 3217-3230Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar), the initiator and downstream promoter element have been shown to be recognized by TAF250-TAF150 and TAF60-TAF40 heterodimers, respectively (13Chalkley G.E. Verrijzer C.P. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4835-4845Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 16Burke T.W. Kadonaga J.T. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 3020-3031Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar). These TAF-DNA and TBP-DNA interactions are important for the ability of TFIID to bind to the core promoter specifically and to mediate transcription efficiently (reviewed in Refs. 13Chalkley G.E. Verrijzer C.P. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4835-4845Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar and 14Kutach A.K. Kadonaga J.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 4754-4764Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). In addition, other cofactors such as TFIIA (17Martinez E. Ge H. Tao Y. Yuan C.X. Palhan V. Roeder R.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6571-6583Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), TAFII- and initiator-dependent cofactors (17Martinez E. Ge H. Tao Y. Yuan C.X. Palhan V. Roeder R.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6571-6583Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), and NC2 (18Willy P.J. Kobayashi R. Kadonaga J.T. Science. 2000; 290: 982-985Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar), appear to modulate the recognition by TFIID of a wide range of core promoter structures. These principal functions of TAFs have also been evaluated in living cells (reviewed in Refs. 10Albright S.R. Tjian R. Gene. 2000; 242: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar and 11Green M.R. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 59-63Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Genetic depletion or inactivation analysis of yeast TAF145, a subunit that is orthologous to human TAF250, revealed that it was not required for transcription generally but was essential for a subset of genes in vivo (reviewed in Ref. 11Green M.R. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 59-63Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Promoter swapping experiments demonstrated that TAF145 function is demanded by the core promoter region rather than by upstream activating sequences (UASs) as examined for theCLN2, RPS5, and TUB2 genes (19Shen W.-C. Green M.R. Cell. 1997; 90: 615-624Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 20Tsukihashi Y. Miyake T. Kawaichi M. Kokubo T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2385-2399Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Thus, it appears that TAF145 function is tightly connected to core promoter recognition, in accordance with human TAF250, which directly recognizes an initiator element as described above (13Chalkley G.E. Verrijzer C.P. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4835-4845Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). On the other hand, TAF145 has been shown to be required for other transcriptional activities, such as activation of the ADH2 gene by Adr1 (21Komarnitsky P.B. Klebanow E.R. Weil P.A. Denis C.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5861-5867Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) and derepression of RNR genes by DNA damage, that are normally repressed by the Crt1 and Tup1-Ssn6 corepressor complex (22Li B. Reese J.C. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4091-4100Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Consistent with such apparently broad roles in transcription, yeast TAF145 and/or human TAF250 possess multiple activities (e.g.TAF N-terminal domain activity, which inhibits TBP function (23Kotani T.

How broadly TAF functions are required for gene expression has been extensively studied in yeast (reviewed in Refs. 11Green M.R. Trends Biochem.

Green M.R. Young R.A. Nature. 2000; 405: 701-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). Genome-wide expression analysis suggests that any TAFs thus far examined are not universally required for transcription, in contrast to other general transcriptional factors, such as Srb4, Kin28, and the largest subunit of RNA polymerase II, which are required for almost all genes (reviewed in Refs. 11Green M.R.

Winston F. Green M.R. Young R.A. Nature. 2000; 405: 701-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). More puzzlingly, mutations in different TAFs affect different sets of genes, ranging from 3% (tsm1) to 67% (taf17) of the whole genome (33Lee T.I. Causton H.C. Holstege F.C. Shen W.C. Hannett N. Jennings E.G. Winston F. Green M.R. Young R.A. Nature. 2000; 405: 701-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). It has been proposed that TAFs shared by TFIID and SAGA, another crucial histone acetyl transferase complex regulating a subset of genes distinct from TFIID (34Grant P.A. Schieltz D. Pray-Grant M.G. Steger D.J. Reese J.C. Yates J.r. Workman J.L. Cell. 1998; 94: 45-53Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar), tend to affect a broader range of genes. This is probably because mutations in the TAFs that they have in common should decrease the activities of TFIID and SAGA simultaneously (reviewed in Ref. 35Hahn S. Cell. 1998; 95: 579-582Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). However, this supposition has not yet been firmly established, because TFIID-specific TAFs such as TAF40 (36Komarnitsky P.B. Michel B. Buratowski S. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2484-2489Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) and TAF48/TSG2 (37Reese J.C. Zhang Z. Kurpad H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17391-17398Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 38Sanders S.L. Weil P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 13895-13900Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) have been shown to be generally required for transcription. The wide range of affected genes (3–67% of the genome) may be partly explained by the allele specificities because, for example, the tighter allele of TAF17 caused much more dramatic loss of transcription than the milder one (39Michel B. Komarnitsky P. Buratowski S. Mol Cell. 1998; 2: 663-673Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). The recent finding that chick TAF31 can be deleted genetically without affecting the expression of most genes, although it is an ortholog of the TAF (TAF17) that has the most universal function among yeast TAFs, indicates that the requirement for TAFs is evolutionarily divergent (40Chen Z. Manley J.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 5064-5076Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). To further clarify how TAF function is involved in gene expressionin vivo, we believe it is important to isolate a wide range of conditional taf alleles and to inspect the transcriptional defect at the molecular level in each tafmutant. We recently isolated two novel temperature-sensitivetaf145 mutants in which the expression profiles of some genes were not identical to those in previously reportedtaf145 mutants (20Tsukihashi Y. Miyake T. Kawaichi M. Kokubo T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2385-2399Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). In our mutants, the core promoter of theTUB2 gene failed to mediate basal transcription, but the function was restored by inserting a consensus TATA element (20Tsukihashi Y. Miyake T. Kawaichi M. Kokubo T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2385-2399Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Consistent with this, we show here that the TATA element is important for transcription from the CLN2 and CYC1promoters. Interestingly, however, the creation of a consensus TATA element cannot restore transcription from the RPS5 promoter. We demonstrate that the RPS5 promoter is mostly impaired in activated transcription and only slightly impaired in basal transcription and that the creation of a consensus TATA element was able to rescue the latter defect. Most importantly, we find that the requirement for TAF145 function in activated transcription of theRPS5 promoter depends on both core promoter structure and UASs. These results imply that a specific function of TAF145 is involved in both core promoter recognition and core promoter and UAS-specific activated transcription. Standard techniques were used for yeast growth and transformation (41Lundblack V. Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K.

They carry a deletion of the chromosomal TAF145 coding region and the wild type or mutantTAF145 gene on a TRP1-based low copy number vector (20Tsukihashi Y. Miyake T. Kawaichi M. Kokubo T. Mol. Cell.

Miyake T. Kawaichi M. Kokubo T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2385-2399Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). pM1452 and pM1591 were subjected to site-specific mutagenesis (43Kunkel T.A. Roberts J.D. Zakour R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 154: 367-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (4560) Google Scholar) to create pM3226 (shown asΔCLN2 GAGA in Fig. 1) and pM3227 (shown as UAS GAL+CYC1 GAGA/–174 in Fig.1) using oligonucleotides TK1289 and TK1290, respectively. The oligonucleotides used in this study are listed in TableI. pM3228 (shown as RPS5/–593 TAAAAT in Fig. 1) was constructed by replacing the 765-bpSphI/XhoI fragment of pM1452 (encompassing theCLN2 promoter) with a 732-bp DNA fragment containing theRPS5 promoter, which was amplified by PCR using the primer pair TK1291 (+SphI)-TK1292 (+XhoI) and genomic DNA as a template. pM3228 was subsequently subjected to site-specific mutagenesis to create pM3229 (TATAAA), pM3230 (TATAAAAA), pM3231 (TATATAAA), and pM3232 (TATATAAAAA), using the oligonucleotides TK1293, TK1466, TK1467, and TK1468, respectively.Figure 5TAF145 dependence was observed only when theRPS5 UAS was combined with the RPS5core promoter in taf145 mutants. A, schematic representation of the reporter plasmids used in this experiment. The regions derived from the CLN2,RPS5, and CYC1 genes are shown by open, shaded, and striped boxes, respectively.RPS5-UAS was fused with the RPS5 andCYC1 core promoters in its two forms, i.e.UAS90bp (–450∼–361 bp) or UAS150bp(–450∼–300 bp), to generate UAS90bp+RPS5/–87, UAS150bp+RPS5/–200, UAS150bp+RPS5/–87, and UAS150bp+CYC1/–174. Synthetic binding sites for GAL4 fusion activators were linked upstream of the CYC1 andRPS5 core promoters to generate UASGAL+CYC1/–174 and UASGAL+RPS5/ –87C, respectively. B andC, Northern blot analysis of mRNA with aCLN2-specific probe. Wild type or mutant strains carrying the indicated reporter plasmids were cultured at 25 or 37 °C. Total RNA isolated from these cultures was analyzed as described in Fig. 1. In C, activator expression plasmids (GAL4DBD-RAP1, -VP16C, -EBNA2, and -GCN4, or GAL4DBD alone as a negative control) were introduced into yeast cells with the reporter plasmid as indicated to measure the activation efficiencies.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Table IOligonucleotides used in this studyNo.SequenceTK11365′-CAC ACT AGT CAG ATC CGC CAG GCG TGT-3′TK11375′-CAC CTC GAG CCT TAT GTG GGC CAC CCT-3′TK12895′-GAT TGC TAT TTT TTT CTC TAT GAA AGA GAT AGT-3′TK12905′-GAA AAC AAG AGT TTT CTC TAC ATA CAG AGC ACA-3′TK12915′-CAC GCA TGC GAT TTC ACG AAA ACA CCT-3′TK12925′-CAC CTC GAG GGA CTT CTT CTG GAA TTG-3′TK12935′-TAA AAA GTA CAA AAT TTT ATA GAA CTA ATG GGC A-3′TK13215′-CAC ACT AGT ACT TTT TAT CAA TAC TTA-3′TK13225′-AAT AGT TAC CAG AGT ACT AGT CTA TTT TTT TAT ATA-3′TK14355′-CAC GCA TGC ACT ATC TCT TTC ATA TAT-3′TK14365′-CAC GCA TGC GCA CGC AGC CTC TGG CTA-3′TK14665′-GA TAA AAA GTA CAA ATT TTT ATA GAA CTA ATG GGC A-3′TK14675′-TAA AAA GTA CAA AAT TTT ATA TA GAA CTA ATG GGC ACA-3′TK14685′-GA TAA AAA GTA CAA ATT TTT ATA TA GAA CTA ATG GGC ACA-3′TK15005′-CAC GCA TGC TCT CTT TCA TAT ATA AAA-3′TK15015′-CAC GCA TGC TTT CAT ATA TAA AAA AAT-3′TK15025′-CAC GCA TGC TCA TAT ATA AAA AAA TAG-3′TK15035′-CAC GCA TGC ATA TAT AAA AAA ATA GAC-3′TK15045′-CAC GCA TGC ATA TAA AAA AAT AGA CTA-3′TK15055′-CAC GCA TGC ATA AAA AAA TAG ACT AGT-3′TK15415′-CCT AAA ATA TTT TGT A-3′TK15425′-CTA GTA CAA AAT ATT TTA GGC ATG-3′TK15435′-CAT AAA ATA TTT TGT A-3′TK15445′-CTA GTA CAA AAT ATT TTA TGC ATG-3′TK15455′-CCT ATA AAA TTT TGT A-3′TK15465′-CTA GTA CAA AAT TTT ATA GGC ATG-3′TK15475′-CAT ATA AAA TTT TGT A-3′TK15485′-CTA GTA CAA AAT TTT ATA TGC ATG-3′TK15495′-CAC GCA TGC CTA AAA TAT TTT GTA CTT-3′TK15505′-CAC GCA TGC CTA TAA AAT TTT GTA CTT-3′TK15515′-CAC GCA TGC ATA AAA TAT TTT GTA CTT-3′TK15525′-CAC GCA TGC ATA TAA AAT TTT GTA CTT-3′TK16245′-CAC GCA TGC TTA TAC AAC AAC ACC CAT-3′TK16255′-CAC GCA TGC AGA ATT CTT TTT CTC CCG-3′TK16265′-CAC GCA TGC CTC CCC TAC CTT CGC CGC-3′TK16275′-CAC GCA TGC GCA GCC CGG GGG ATC CAC TAG T-3′TK16285′-CAC GCA TGC ACC GCG GTG GCG GCC GCT-3′TK16945′-CAC GAA TTC TCT TAC GCT ATA CCA GAA-3′TK16955′-CAC CTG CAG CTA GCT TAT GGT ATC AGG ATC-3′TK16965′-TAA ACT TGA GAC AAA AGA ATA ATT ATG GGT-3′TK16975′-CAC GCA TGC GAT GCA GGG CCA TTC TCA-3′TK17335′-CAC GCA TGC CCT TCC CCG TAG CAG GGC-3′TK17345′-CAC ACT AGT TTA TAC AAC AAC ACC CAT-3′TK17355′-CAC ACT AGT CCT TCC CCG TAG CAG GGC-3′ Open table in a new tab To enable the construction of CLN2-RPS5 hybrid promoters, aSpeI site was created at the –68 bp position of pM1452 by site-specific mutagenesis, using the TK1322 oligonucleotide. The 506-bpSpeI/XhoI fragment containing the CLN2initiator of the resulting plasmid pM3233 was subsequently replaced with the 212-bp DNA fragment containing the RPS5 initiator, which was amplified by PCR using the primer pair TK1321 (+SpeI)-TK1292 (+XhoI) and pM3228 (RPS5/–593) as a template, to create pM3234 (shown as CLN2(–332)-RPS5 in Fig. 2). For deletion analysis of the CLN2-RPS5 hybrid promoter, pM3235 (CLN2(–126)-RPS5 in Fig.2), pM3236 (CLN2(–96)-RPS5in Fig. 2), pM3237 (CLN2(–92)-RPS5 in Fig. 2), pM3238 (CLN2(–88)-RPS5 in Fig. 2), pM3239 (CLN2(–86)-RPS5 in Fig. 2), pM3240 (CLN2(–84)-RPS5 in Fig. 2), pM3241 (CLN2(–82)-RPS5 in Fig. 2), and pM3242 (CLN2(–80)-RPS5in Fig. 2) were constructed by replacing the 476-bpSphI/XhoI fragment of pM3234 with DNA fragments encoding the –126 (CLN2)∼+139 (RPS5), –96 (CLN2)∼+139 (RPS5), –92 (CLN2)∼+139 (RPS5), –88 (CLN2)∼+139 (RPS5), –86 (CLN2)∼+139 (RPS5), –84 (CLN2)∼+139 (RPS5), –82 (CLN2)∼+139 (RPS5), and –80 (CLN2)∼+139 (RPS5) fragments of theCLN2-RPS5 hybrid promoter, respectively; these fragments were amplified by PCR using pM3234 (CLN2(–332)-RPS5) as a template and the following primer pairs: TK1436-TK1292, TK1435-TK1292, TK1500-TK1292, TK1501-TK1292, TK1502-TK1292, TK1503-TK1292, TK1504-TK1292, and TK1505- TK1292. pM3244 (shown as RPS5/–87C in Fig. 3), pM3245 (RPS5 TATAAA /–87C in Fig. 3), pM3248 (RPS5/–87A in Fig. 3), and pM3249 (RPS5 TATAAA /–87A in Fig. 3) were constructed by replacing the 765-bp SphI/XhoI fragment of pM1452 with the DNA fragments containing theRPS5 core promoter or its derivatives that were amplified by PCR using the primer pairs TK1549-TK1292, TK1550-TK1292, TK1551-TK1292, and TK1552-TK1292 and pM3228 (RPS5/–593) as a template. pM3246 (RPS5/–87C+SpeI in Fig. 3), pM3247 (RPS5TATAAA/–87C+SpeI in Fig. 3), pM3250 (RPS5/–87A+SpeI), and pM3251 (RPS5TATAAA/–87A+SpeI in Fig. 3) were constructed by replacing the 264-bp SphI/SpeI fragment of pM3234 (CLN2(–332)-RPS5in Fig. 2) with the short DNA fragments generated by annealing two oligonucleotide pairs, TK1541-TK1542, TK1545-TK1546, TK1543-TK1544, and TK1547-TK1548, respectively. For deletion analysis of the RPS5 promoter (Fig. 4), pM3252 (RPS5/–450 in Fig. 4), pM3253 (RPS5/–300 in Fig. 4), and pM3254 (RPS5/–200 in Fig. 4) were constructed by replacing the 765-bp SphI/XhoI fragment of pM1452 with DNA fragments encoding the –450∼+139-, –300∼+139-, and –200∼+139-bp regions of the RPS5 promoter, respectively; these fragments were amplified by PCR using the primer pairs TK1624-TK1292, TK1625-TK1292, and TK1626-TK1292, respectively, and pM3228 (RPS5/–593) as a template. pM3255 (RPS5/–593/ΔUASRAP1 in Fig. 4) was generated by removing the presumptive RAP1 binding site (–403∼–415 bp) (44Lascaris R.F. Mager W.H. Planta R.J. Bioinformatics. 1999; 15: 267-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) of pM3228 (RPS5/–593) by site-specific mutagenesis using the oligonucleotide TK1696. pM3256 (shown as UAS 90bp +RPS5/–87 in Fig. 5) was created by ligating the 90-bp DNA fragment encoding –450∼–361-bp of RPS5-UAS, which was amplified by PCR using the primer pair TK1624-TK1697 and pM3228 (RPS5/–593) as a template, into the SphI site of pM3244 (RPS5/–87C). Similarly, pM3257 (UAS 150bp +RPS5/–200 in Fig. 5) and pM3258 (UAS 150bp +RPS5/–87 in Fig. 5) were created by ligating the 150-bp (–450∼–300 bp of RPS5-UAS) DNA fragment amplified by the primer pair TK1624-TK1733 into theSphI sites of pM3254 (RPS5/–200) and pM3244 (RPS5/–87C), respectively. To construct pM3259 (UAS150bp+CYC1/–174 in Fig. 5), pM1588 was created first by replacing the 260-bpSpeI/XhoI fragment of pM1585 (20Tsukihashi Y. Miyake T. Kawaichi M. Kokubo T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2385-2399Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) with the 344-bp PCR fragment containing the CYC1 promoter amplified by the primer pair TK1136-TK1137. pM3259 was subsequently created by ligating the 150-bp (–450∼–300 bp of RPS5-UAS) DNA fragment amplified by the primer pair TK1734-TK1735 into the SpeI site of pM1588. pM3260 was created by ligating the DNA fragment containing four repeats of the GAL4 binding site, which was amplified by PCR using the primer pair TK1627-TK1628 and pM2190 as a template, into the SphI site of pM3244 (RPS5/–87C). The PvuII fragment of pM3266 containing the entire reporter gene was moved into pRS316 (45Sikorski R.S. Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) to change the auxotrophic marker from LEU2 to URA3. The resulting plasmid pM3279 is shown asUAS GAL +RPS5/–87C in Fig. 5. The plasmids expressing activators in yeast cells, pM524 (GAL4DBD-VP16C (amino acids 457–490)), pM1570 (GAL4DBD-EBNA2 (amino acids 426–462)), pM967 (GAL4DBD-GCN4 (amino acids 107–144)), and pM471 (GAL4DBD) have been described previously (20Tsukihashi Y. Miyake T. Kawaichi M. Kokubo T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2385-2399Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). pM3261 (GAL4DBD-RAP1 (amino acids 630–690)) was similarly constructed by ligating the DNA fragment encoding the RAP1 activation domain (amino acids 630–690) (46Graham I.R. Haw R.A. Spink K.G. Halden K.A. Chambers A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7481-7490Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) that was amplified using the primer pair TK1694-TK1695 into the EcoRI/PstI sites of pM471. Northern blot analyses were performed as described previously (20Tsukihashi Y. Miyake T. Kawaichi M. Kokubo T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2385-2399Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). All mRNAs derived from mini-CLN2 hybrid gene reporter constructs were detected by the 32P-labeled 411-bp XhoI/HindIII fragment isolated from pM1452. We previously demonstrated that transcription of a subset of genes at 37 °C is drastically impaired in the taf145-N568Δ and –T657K mutants but only slightly impaired in the taf145-Y570N mutant, despite the much slower growth phenotypes of all of these mutants at 37 °C (20Tsukihashi Y. Miyake T. Kawaichi M. Kokubo T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2385-2399Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the impaired transcription from theTUB2 promoter in the former two mutants can be rescued by creating a consensus TATA element, indicating that the TATA element compensates for the loss of TAF145 function (20Tsukihashi Y. Miyake T. Kawaichi M. Kokubo T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000"

Nuclear run-on assays demonstrated that this was due to increased transcription. We cloned 542 base pairs upstream of the transcriptional start site of the murine TGH gene. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays demonstrated enhanced binding of hepatic nuclear proteins from 27-day-old mice to the murine TGH promoter, yielding three differentially migrating complexes. DNase I footprint analysis localized these complexes to two distinct regions: site A contains a putative Sp binding site, and site B contains a degenerate E box. We transfected primary murine hepatocytes with a series of 5′-deletion constructs upstream of the reporter luciferase cDNA. Positive control elements were identified in a segment containing site A. Competitive electrophoretic mobility shift assays and supershift assays demonstrated that site A binds Sp1 and Sp3. Transcriptional activation assays in Schneider SL-2 insect cells demonstrated that Sp1 is a potent activator of the TGH promoter.

Multiple forms of carboxylesterase have been identified in mammalian tissues, and some have been shown to differ in biochemical, immunological, and genetic properties (for a review, see Ref. 1Satoh T. Hosakawa M. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1998; 38: 256-288Crossref Scopus (665) Google Scholar and references therein). Carboxylesterase activity is widely distributed in mammalian tissues, with the highest levels being present in liver microsomes (2Peters J. Nash H.R. Biochem. Genet. 1978; 16: 553-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The ability of carboxylesterases to hydrolyze various xenobiotoics and endogenous substrates, such as esters, thioesters, or amide bonds, indicates that the known functions of these enzymes are mainly for drug metabolism and detoxification of harmful chemicals (1Satoh T. Hosakawa M. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1998; 38: 256-288Crossref Scopus (665) Google Scholar). Some carboxylesterases have been found to preferentially hydrolyze lipids, such as long chain acyl-CoA (3Alexson S.E. Finlay T.H. Hellman U. Svensson L.T. Diczfalusy U. Eggertsen G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17118-17124Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), cholesteryl ester (4Ghosh S. Mallonee D.H. Hylemon P.B. Grogan W.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1259: 305-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), and triacylglycerol (TG)1 (5Lehner R. Verger R. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 1861-1868Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Some carboxylesterases are thought to participate in transport of fatty acids across the endoplasmic reticulum membrane or in maintenance of membrane structure. In the liver, mobilization of stored TG to supply fatty acids for metabolic energy occurs via an initial hydrolysis of stored TG and subsequent resynthesis of TG as a component of very low density lipoproteins (VLDLs) (for a review, see Ref. 6Gibbons G.F. Islam K. Pease R.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1483: 35-37Google Scholar). Although the enzymes catalyzing de novo synthesis of TG are associated with endoplasmic reticulum membranes, ∼70% of the TG that is secreted by hepatocytes in VLDLs has been calculated to arise from a cytosolic storage pool, whereas only 30% is derived from de novo TG synthesis (7Wiggins D. Gibbons G.F. Biochem. J. 1992; 284: 457-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar, 8Yang L.-Y. Kuksis A. Myher J.J. Steiner G. J. Lipid Res. 1995; 36: 125-136Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Hormone-sensitive lipase, although fundamental in adipose tissue lipid metabolism and overall energy homeostasis, is not expressed in liver in sufficient quantities to account for the rate of lipolysis of stored TG and subsequent VLDL secretion (7Wiggins D. Gibbons G.F. Biochem. J. 1992; 284: 457-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Lehner and Verger (5Lehner R. Verger R. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 1861-1868Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) reported the purification of a member of the carboxylesterase family from porcine liver, microsomal triacylglycerol hydrolase (TGH), capable of hydrolyzing long, medium, and short chain TGs in vitro (5Lehner R. Verger R. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 1861-1868Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Further detailed characterization of TGH with respect to its intracellular location, developmental expression, and tissue and species specificity strongly supported a role for TGH in the lipolysis of cytoplasmic TG, some of which is used for assembly into VLDLs (9Lehner R. Cui Z. Vance D.E. Biochem. J. 1999; 338: 761-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Stable expression of rat TGH cDNA in McArdle RH7777 cells, a rat hepatoma cell line that lacks TGH and is defective in VLDL secretion, demonstrated unambiguously that TGH does indeed hydrolyze stored TG (10Lehner R. Vance D.E. Biochem. J. 1999; 343: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). In our previous studies, we observed increased expression of rat TGH mRNA and protein in liver at the time of weaning, coincident with an enhanced ability to secrete VLDLs (9Lehner R. Cui Z. Vance D.E. Biochem. J. 1999; 338: 761-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The aim of the present study was to determine whether the increased expression of TGH seen at the time of weaning is linked to transcriptional regulation and to identify potential transcription factors and cis-acting DNA elements that might mediate the observed developmental expression of TGH in liver. Livers samples from mice of various ages were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and homogenized using a Polytron homogenizer (Brinkman Instruments) for 30 s at low speed in 250 mm sucrose, 25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), and 5 mm EDTA to yield 20% (w/v) crude extract. Unbroken cells and cellular debris were removed by 10 min of centrifugation at 500 × g. Protein concentrations of total liver homogenates (supernatants) were determined by the micro BCA method (Pierce) using bovine serum albumin as a standard. For RNA isolation, livers were immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen prior to extraction of total RNA using Trizol reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Homogenate protein (50 μg) or nuclear protein (10 μg) from murine liver was heated for 3 min at 90 °C in 62.5 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.4), 10% (v/v) glycerol, 5% (v/v) 2-mercaptoethanol, 1.05% SDS, and 0.004% bromphenol blue. The protein samples were electrophoresed on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel in 25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.3), 192 mm glycine, and 0.1% SDS buffer. The proteins were then transferred to nitrocellulose by electroblotting in transfer buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.3), 192 mm glycine, 20% (v/v) methanol). Following transfer, membranes were incubated for 1 h at room temperature or overnight at 4 °C with 5% skim milk in 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20 (T-TBS) and then incubated for 1 h with antibody raised against the specified protein. Depending on the primary antibodies, the secondary antibodies used were goat anti-rabbit IgG, rabbit anti-goat IgG, or goat anti-mouse IgG (Pierce) and were detected using the enhanced chemiluminescence system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Where indicated, primary and secondary antibodies were stripped from the membrane by incubation with 100 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 2% SDS, 62.5 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.7) for 30 min at 50 °C and the blot was reprobed with another antibody. The primary antibodies used were affinity purified anti-TGH polyclonal antibody (5Lehner R. Verger R. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 1861-1868Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), anti-actin monoclonal antibody (Sigma, clone AC74, catalog number A 5316), and from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, polyclonal anti-Sp1 (sc-59-G), anti-Sp2 (sc643,), anti-Sp3 (sc-644), anti-E47 (sc-763x), and anti-YY1 (sc-1703x). In some cases, primary incubations with anti-Sp antibodies also contained competitive antigenic peptides to identify antigenically related proteins. These peptides were SP1(PEP2)P (sc-59P), SP2(K-20)P (sc-643P), and SP3(D-20)P (sc-644P) from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Equivalent amounts of total RNA (2.5 μg) were electrophoresed in a 1.2% agarose/formaldehyde gel and transferred to HyBond-N+ membrane. TGH mRNA was detected by incubation of the membrane with a 32P-labeled, single-stranded antisense oligo designated pTGHII (5′-GAGCAAAGTTGGCCCAGTATTTCATCACCATTTTGCTGA-3′). This oligonucleotide was derived from the rat TGH cDNA sequence that is 90% identical to the corresponding murine cDNA and does not align with other carboxylesterases from the same gene family. Probes for glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (G3PDH) were prepared by RT-PCR with murine liver total RNA with Superscript II (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The primers used were G3PDH1A (5′-GAGCCAAACGGGTCATCATC-3′) and G3PDH2B (5′-CATCACGCCACAGCTTTCCA-3′), which were designed to amplify a 232-base pair fragment. The PCR product was used as a template for Random Primers DNA Labeling System (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Northern hybridizations were visualized by autoradiography. This assay was performed essentially as described (11Rolfe F.G. Sewell W.A. J. Immunol. Met. 1997; 202: 143-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Briefly, highly purified and transcriptionally active nuclei were prepared from murine liver according to the methods of Marzluff and Huang (12Marzluff W.F. Huang R.C.C. Hames B.D. Higgins S.J. Transcription and Translation: A Practical Approach. IRL Press, Oxford1985: 89-129Google Scholar). Freshly prepared or frozen/thawed nuclei (200 μl) were split into two aliquots and incubated for 30 min at 30 °C in 20% glycerol, 30 mmTris-HCl (pH 8.0), 2.5 mm MgCl2, 150 mm KCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 40 units of RNasin (Promega) with or without 0.5 mm (each) ribonucleoside triphosphates (+/– rNTPs). After 30 min, nuclei were lysed by the addition of 200 μl of 4 m guanidinium thiocyanate, 25 mm sodium citrate (pH 4.0), 0.5% sarcosyl, 0.1 m 2-mercaptoethanol. Yeast tRNA (20 μg) was added, and RNA was extracted by the acid-guanidinium-thiocyanate method and then resuspended in water treated with diethylpyrocarbonate. RT-PCR was performed as described above. The primers used for TGH were EX6F (5-CACTGCTGCTCTGATTACAACAG-3′) and EX10R (5′-GCGACCACTGGAATCATATTC-3′). The primers used for G3PDH were G3PDH1A and G3PDH2B. Because the run-on products are not labeled, newly transcribed mRNA in isolated nuclei was detected following nuclear transcription initiated by the addition of exogenous rNTPs. Nuclear transcription reactions lacking exogenous rNTPs were included to control for mRNAs synthesized by endogenous rNTPs in isolated nuclei. Genomic sequences containing the putative proximal murine TGH promoter were identified by Southern blot analysis of bacterial artificial chromosome clone 313P24 that contains the complete murine TGH gene (13Dolinsky, V. W., Sipione, S., Lehner, R., and Vance, D. E. (2001) Biochim. Biophys. Acta, in press.Google Scholar). Briefly, bacterial artificial chromosome DNA was digested with EcoRI, and a single 6-kilobase pair DNA fragment that contained exon 1 was identified by Southern blotting using a murine TGH exon 1-specific probe, ATGCGCCTCTACCCTCTGATATG. This fragment was subcloned and sequenced by gene walking using overlapping primers to determine sequences upstream of the transcriptional start site. The sequence of the murine TGH promoter was confirmed by sequencing both strands of the DNA. A genomic fragment encoding the murine TGH promoter region spanning –542 and +112 was cloned into the T/A cloning site of pCR2.1 TOPO (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions to create pCR (–542/+112). The promoter region was excised from pCR 2.1 TOPO by restriction digestion with KpnI and XbaI. The insert was purified from an agarose gel (Qiagen gel elution kit) and directionally ligated into pCI (Promega) that had been subjected to the same restriction digestion and gel purification. The cloned fragment was released from pCI by restriction digestion with KpnI andSmaI, gel purified, and then directionally inserted into the luciferase reporter vector, pGL3Basic (Promega) that had also been digested by KpnI and SmaI and gel purified to generate –542Luc. Luciferase reporter plasmids containing serial deletions at the 5′-end of the cloned promoter fragment were generated by standard PCR methods using –542Luc as template and GLprimer2 (Promega) as the reverse primer with each of the following forward primers: TGGCTGCTGCTGTCTGCTCTT (–313Luc), CTGAATTGAGGTGAGAG (–276Luc), TGAGTACTGGGCACTG (–198Luc), TAGTGGGCGTGGCTTG (–154Luc), GAGCTCTTTGGAAGGAAGGAG (–116Luc), CTGAGCTGGTTGAGCAAGAC (–48Luc), and TGGTCCACAACAGA (–10Luc). In each case, the sequence of the forward primer started with CGCGGTACC (KpnI site in boldface). Each of the PCR products was directionally cloned into pGL3Basic following restriction digestion of each with KpnI andSmaI. Vectors enabling expression of recombinant Sp proteins were obtained from Dr. R. Tjian (pPacSp1 and pPac0) (14Courey A.J. Tjian R. Cell. 1988; 55: 887-898Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1079) Google Scholar) and Dr. J. Noti (pPacSp3) (15Noti J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24038-24045Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The plasmid enabling expression of green fluorescent protein (GFP) in insect cells (copia (XhoI)-eGFP) was kindly provided by Dr. John F. Elliott (University of Alberta). The cDNA for full-length Th1 (16Hollenberg S.M. Sternglanz R. Cheng P.F. Weintraub H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3813-3822Crossref PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar) was obtained by RT-PCR. Briefly, total RNA was obtained from hearts isolated from 1-day-old mice (as described below for liver) and reverse-transcribed with Superscipt II reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies, Inc.) and oligo(dT)15 antisense primer. Primers used in subsequent PCR were 5′-ATGAACCTCGTGGGCAGCTAC-3′ and 5′-TCACTGGTTTAGCTCCAGCGCCCA-3′. The PCR (650 base pairs) product was cloned into the T/A cloning site of pCR2.1 TOPO. Th1 and GFP were excised from PCR2.1 TOPO and copia (XhoI)-eGFP respectively using XhoI and BamHI and the ThI cDNA fragment was directionally ligated downstream of the copia promoter in place of GFP to generate a Th1 expression plasmid, copia-Th1. Copia(XhoI) was generated by blunt-end self-ligation after excision of GFP with XhoI and BamHI. Cloned inserts of all transfection constructs were confirmed by DNA sequencing (University of Alberta DNA Core Facility). Murine hepatic cells were isolated by collagenase perfusion and transiently transfected with TGH promoter luciferase reporter constructs (2 μg) using a cationic liposome technique (17Bratke J. Kietzmann T. Jungermann K. Biochem. J. 1999; 339: 563-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Reporter assays were performed as recommended (Promega), and luciferase activity was normalized to protein. SL2 cells (American Type Culture Collection) were plated at a density of 2–3 × 106 cells/35-mm dish in Schneider'sDrosophila medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) containing 10% (v/v) heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum and transfected by a standard calcium phosphate co-precipitation method (18DiNocera P.P. Dawid I.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 7095-7098Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). Each plate received 5 μg of 154Luc or reporter plasmid, pGL3Basic, with or without 5 μg of Sp expression plasmid (pPacSp1, pPacSp3, or pPacO as a control) and 5 μg of Th1 expression plasmid (copia(XhoI) as a control). All plates received 5 μg of copia(XhoI)-eGFP as a control for transfection efficiency. Total plasmid DNA was conserved (20 μg) for each transfection.In vivo fluorescence measurements were carried out on a FACScan flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson, San Jose, CA) equipped with an argon laser. The sample temperature was maintained at 25 °C. SL2 cells expressing GFP were excited at 488 nm. Fluorescence emission was detected at 525 nm. For quantification of GFP fluorescence, SL2 cells were grown using the same conditions as for the luciferase assays. Background fluorescence of SL2 cells was determined at excitation wavelength of 488 nm using the vector copia(XhoI), which does not contain the GFP coding region. Cell pellets were resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline (58 mmNa2HPO4, 17 mmNaH2PO4, 68 mm NaCl, pH 7.4). Data analysis was performed using CELLQuest 3.1 (Becton Dickinson, San Jose, CA), and the ratio of fluorescence intensity to cell density was taken as a measure for GFP expression levels. Luciferase activities were normalized to transfection efficiency as determined by GFP expression. Statistical analysis was performed using a one-way analysis of variance test followed by a post hoc Student-Newman-Keuls test. Values of p less than 0.05 were taken to be significant. Nuclear extracts from murine liver were prepared as described (19Deryckere F. Gannon F. BioTechniques. 1994; 3: 405Google Scholar). Dephosphorylation of extracts was performed in 25 mm Hepes (pH 7.5), 37 mm KCl, 50 mmMgCl2 at 30 °C for 5 min and then 15 min on ice with calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase (1 unit/50 μg of nuclear extract). Dephosphorylation reactions were terminated by the addition of a mixture of inhibitors to final concentrations of 10 mmNaF, 10 mm sodium vanadate, 10 mm potassium pyrophosphate, and 5 mm sodium phosphate. For mock dephosphorylation reactions, inhibitors were added to the extract before the 30 °C incubation. Distal (–542/–371), medial (–370/–68), and proximal (–67/+112) promoter fragments were released from pCR (–542/+112) by restriction digestion withBlpI/NotI, HindIII/BlpI, and HindIII, respectively. Promoter fragments were purified from 2% agarose gels using the Qiaex II gel extraction kit (Qiagen Inc., Mississauga, Ontario, Canada) according to the manufacturer's instructions and labeled by filling in ends using Klenow fragment in the presence of [α-32P]dCTP. Promoter-derived oligonucleotides were synthesized by the University of Alberta DNA Core Facility. Complimentary oligonucleotides (10 nmol of each) were heated at 70 °C in 100 μl of annealing buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) containing 100 mm NaCl and 1 mm EDTA). After 10 min, annealing reactions were slowly cooled to room temperature, and 5 pmol of double-stranded oligonucleotide was 5′-end labeled using T4 kinase (Roche Diagnostics) and [γ-32P]ATP (PerkinElmer). The sequences of oligonucleotides used in EMSAs are as follows (coding strand):−1565′-CCTAGTGGGCGTGGCTTGG-3′−138(site A),−1255′-ACACCCAGAGAGCTCTTT-3′−108(site B), and 5′-ATTCGATCGGGCGGGGCGAGC-3′ (Sp consensus oligonucleotide). For each binding reaction (40 μl), 4 μg of poly(dI-dC)-poly(dI-dC), 8 μl of a 5× binding buffer (100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 10 mm MgCl2, 250 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 50% glycerol, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 5 mm dithiothreitol), 2.5 μg of nuclear extract and labeled probe (20,000 cpm) were incubated at room temperature for 30 min. Competitive EMSAs were carried out under identical conditions except that a 50 m excess of nonlabeled double-stranded oligonucleotides or 2 μg of commercially available antibody was added to the binding reactions 15 min prior to the addition of labeled probe. Binding reactions were terminated by the addition of 4 μl of gel loading buffer (30% (v/v) glycerol, 0.1% (w/v) bromphenol blue, 0.1% (w/v) xylene cyanol). Protein-DNA complexes were resolved on 3.5% (for labeled promoter fragments) or 6% (for labeled double-stranded oligos) nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis with Tris borate-EDTA buffer system (45 mm Tris, 44.5 mm borate, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0) at 4 °C and were detected by autoradiography. Specific antibody-protein interactions were observed as supershifted or immunodepleted complexes. The sense strand of the TGH medial promoter fragment was labeled by filling in theHindIII site using Klenow fragment in the presence of [α-32P]dCTP. Labeled DNA (20,000 cpm) was incubated for 30 min at room temperature with 10 μg of poly(dI-dC)-poly(dI-dC) and 10, 25, and 50 μg of nuclear protein extract from 37-day-old murine liver in a final volume of 100 μl (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 2.2 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mmCaCl2, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm dithiothreitol). To determine the optimal conditions, a titration was performed for each probe using increasing concentrations of DNase I for the same amount of nuclear extract. DNase I (5–10 milliunits) in DNase I buffer (1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 20 mm KCl) was added for 5 min at room temperature. DNase I digestions were terminated by the addition of 200 μl of DNase I stop buffer (200 mm NaCl, 30 mm EDTA, 1% SDS, 100 μg/ml tRNA) and 2 μl of proteinase K (25 μg/μl). After a 15-min incubation at 37 °C, reaction mixtures were extracted twice with phenol/chloroform/isoamylalcohol and were then ethanol-precipitated before analysis on a 5% polyacrylamide, 7 m urea sequencing gel. Immunoblot analysis of proteins from livers of mice of various ages demonstrates that TGH protein levels increase dramatically between 20 and 27 days after birth (Fig. 1A). TGH mRNA expression in these livers was evaluated by Northern blot hybridization of total RNA with a murine TGH-specific oligonucleotide as probe (Fig. 1B). TGH mRNA was detected as early as 1 day after birth with maximum expression at 27 days. TGH transcription was detected with a modified nuclear run-on assay based on RT-PCR (Fig. 1C). Amplicons for both TGH and G3PDH were generated by RT-PCR of RNA obtained from isolated nuclei in which nuclear transcription proceeded in the absence of exogenously supplied rNTPs. It is unlikely that either amplicon represents cytoplasmic RNA contamination. As our method involved lysing the cells in an iso-osmotic solution followed by purification of nuclei by sedimentation through a dense solution of sucrose (2 m). It is also unlikely that amplification occurred from genomic DNA contamination or immature, unprocessed heteronuclear RNA because the PCR primers were designed so that they spanned four introns of the murine TGH gene (13Dolinsky, V. W., Sipione, S., Lehner, R., and Vance, D. E. (2001) Biochim. Biophys. Acta, in press.Google Scholar). The only amplicons detected were those of the expected sizes based on completely spliced cDNA. Indeed, intact splicing machinery can be recovered from nuclei prepared with techniques similar to those employed here (20Eperon I.P. Krainer A.R. Higgins S.J. Hames B.D. RNA Processing: A Practical Approach. 1. IRL Press, Oxford1994: 57-101Google Scholar). Therefore, mature transcripts for both TGH and G3PDH are present in the nucleus in low abundance and are available to act as functional templates for RT-PCR. In livers from 7-day-old mice, no TGH transcription was observed (Fig.1C, + rNTPs) above that for transcripts formed in the nuclei prior to nuclear isolation or with endogenous NTPs (Fig. 1C, – rNTPs). In liver from 27-day-old mice, TGH transcripts were much more readily detected when isolated nuclei were supplied exogenous rNTPs. All PCRs were terminated while products in the +rNTPreactions were still accumulating. These data suggest that the lower levels of cytosolic TGH mRNA (Fig. 1B) seen in livers of 7-day-old mice might be due to a lower level of transcriptional activity from the TGH gene. Whereas TGH protein and mRNA expression appear to be temporally spaced, indicating regulation at a posttranscriptional level, the nuclear run-on assay presented here indicates that in the liver, postnatal expression of TGH mRNA is regulated at the level of transcription. To investigate the transcriptional regulation of the murine TGH gene, a 6-kilobase pair DNA fragment derived from a bacterial artificial chromosome clone, previously demonstrated to contain the entire murine TGH gene (13Dolinsky, V. W., Sipione, S., Lehner, R., and Vance, D. E. (2001) Biochim. Biophys. Acta, in press.Google Scholar), was sequenced. This DNA fragment contains exon 1 and most of intron 1, extends 3 kilobase pairs upstream of the transcription start site, and presumably contains the promoter. Fig. 2 shows 542 base pairs of the 5′ sequence flanking exon 1. This sequence is 59% identical to the rat (4Ghosh S. Mallonee D.H. Hylemon P.B. Grogan W.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1259: 305-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) and 46% identical to the previously cloned human (22Langmann T. Becker A. Aslanidis C. Notka F. Ullrich H. Schwer H. Schmitz G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1350: 65-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) promoter. No TATA box was found to precede the transcriptional start site. Potential binding sites for transcription factors were identified by searching the TRANSFAC data base with the murine sequence using the Matinspector program (23Quandt K. Frech K. Karas H. Wingender E. Werner T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 4878-4884Crossref PubMed Scopus (2428) Google Scholar). These sites include three Sp1 binding sites, a nuclear factor 1, and two sterol response element-like sequences. Interestingly, several of these binding sites are also present in the human and rat promoter sequences, suggesting that we have cloned a functional promoter with evolutionarily conserved transcriptional regulatory patterns. Previous evidence for sterol regulation of TGH transcription in the rat has been reported (24Natarajan R. Ghosh S. Grogan W.M. J. Lipid Res. 1999; 40: 2091-2098Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25Ghosh S. Natarajan R. Pandak W.M. Hylemon P.B. Grogan W.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: G662-G668PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that the sterol response element-like elements are functional. We tested whether or not the cloned sequence had promoter activity by designing fusion constructs of the 5′-flanking sequence linked to the luciferase gene. In addition, several constructs were made in which 5′-segments of the murine TGH gene were cloned upstream of the luciferase gene, and their promoter activities were tested in transient transfection assays in primary hepatocytes obtained from adult mice. A schematic illustration of the deletion constructs is shown in Fig. 3A.Figure 3Promoter activity of TGH-luciferase gene chimeras transiently transfected into murine primary hepatocytes.A, localization of promoter fragments is shown, and putative transcription factor consensus sites are indicated. Numbersindicate the relative positions with respect to the start of transcription. B, nested 5′-deletion promoter fragments were cloned upstream of the luciferase coding region in pGL3Basic and transiently transfected into murine primary hepatocytes. Luciferase activity was normalized to equal amounts of protein. Data represent the mean ± S.D. of three separate experiments, each performed in triplicate.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The construct with the largest 5′-extension was –542Luc followed by –313Luc. Transient transfection into primary murine hepatocytes revealed a reproducible reduction of luciferase activity (∼50%) upon deletion of the sequence spanning –154 to –117 (Fig. 3B), suggesting that positive control elements reside in this segment. Others have observed that reporter constructs containing this conserved Sp consensus sequence from orthologous rat and human TGH promoters activate transcription, whereas their elimination reduces promoter activity (21Nataranjan R.

Important steps for further understanding the mechanism of ion pumps will be the atomic structural characterization of different key conformational intermediates of the transport cycle, including phosphorylated intermediates. Following our previous report (Champeil, P., Henao, F., Lacapère, J.-J. & McIntosh, D. B. (2000)J. Biol.

We show that this phosphorylated fluorescein isothiocyanate-ATPase can form two-dimensional arrays in membranes, similar to those that were used previously to reconstruct from cryoelectron microscopy images the three-dimensional structure of Ca2+-free unphosphorylated ATPase.

However, the catalytic cycle of this Ca2+ pump, like for all P-type membrane ATPases, comprises several intrinsically transient autophosphorylated forms, the processing of which is tightly coupled to the binding or dissociation of calcium and hydrogen ions at distant transport sites. Thus, the next important step for understanding the mechanism of the pump will be obtaining the atomic structures of several of the key conformational intermediates within the transport cycle. Up to now, however, the instability of most intermediate forms has prevented their use for biophysical purposes, especially in the presence of solubilizing concentrations of detergent. We recently found that after covalent modification of Ca2+-ATPase with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC),1 and under conditions that were in fact already mentioned 20 years ago (4Pick U. FEBS Lett. 1981; 123: 131-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), it is possible to form a phosphorylated species of FITC-ATPase with very unusual characteristics (5Champeil P. Henao F. Lacapère J.-J. McIntosh D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 276: 5795-5803Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), among which is a very low fluorescence of the bound FITC. We now report that this phosphorylated species has an amazing stability, even in the presence of detergent, as well as the ability to form two-dimensional crystalline arrays in the membrane. This form of the Ca2+ pump might be appropriate for obtaining three-dimensional crystals and elucidating the atomic structure of a different intermediate of the catalytic cycle of the pump. A phosphorylated form of FITC-labeled ATPase in sarcoplasmic reticulum vesicles can be formed by acetyl phosphate-induced Ca2+ loading of the vesicles followed by calcium chelation (4Pick U. FEBS Lett. 1981; 123: 131-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 5Champeil P. Henao F. Lacapère J.-J. McIntosh D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 276: 5795-5803Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). This FITC-ATPase species has a low fluorescence (4Pick U. FEBS Lett. 1981; 123: 131-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 5Champeil P. Henao F. Lacapère J.-J. McIntosh D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 276: 5795-5803Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). We found that the low fluorescence of this species remained stable in the presence of thapsigargin and decavanadate (Fig.1 a). The decavanadate-induced fast drop in FITC fluorescence (followed by a slower rise, because the added decavanadate also contained trace amounts of orthovanadate) is essentially due to true fluorescence quenching, as also described for non-phosphorylated FITC-labeled ATPase (6Highsmith S. Barker D. Scales D.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1985; 817: 123-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Because the same phosphorylated form can be formed from Piand passively loaded vesicles, at low enough free Ca2+ (4Pick U. FEBS Lett. 1981; 123: 131-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar,5Champeil P. Henao F. Lacapère J.-J. McIntosh D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 276: 5795-5803Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), this made it possible to evaluate the stability of the above low fluorescence phosphorylated form on a much longer time scale. We found that the stability of this phosphoenzyme at 20 °C was increased from a few tens of minutes to more than 1 week in the presence of thapsigargin (TG), and the increased stability provided by TG was not impaired by the additional presence of decavanadate (Fig.1 b). This was also the case, remarkably, in the presence of a solubilizing concentration of dodecylmaltoside. In the latter case, the increased stability was associated with a slow loss of the sensitivity to Ca2+, because after a few hours the solubilized phosphoenzyme no longer experienced rapid dephosphorylation after addition of Ca2+ (data not shown). We then found that in its membranous state, this special type of phosphorylated FITC-ATPase easily formed two-dimensional arrays in the presence of decavanadate (Fig. 1 c), with crystalline networks being formed on most vesicles (more than 90%). These arrays accounted for such a large proportion of the ATPases that their formation by the few residual non-phosphorylated ATPases (7Dux L. Martonosi A. J. Biol.

Nature. 1998; 392: 835-839Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar) is excluded. Nevertheless, in contrast with the two-dimensional crystals formed from phosphorylated scallop ATPase (11Hardwicke P.M.D. Bozzola J.J. J. Muscle Res. Cell Motil. 1989; 10: 245-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar), which exhibited a p1 symmetry, our crystals of phosphorylated rabbit ATPase exhibited a p2 symmetry (12Lacapère J.-J. Delavoie F. Henao F. McIntosh D.B. Champeil P. Biophys. J. 2001; 80 (.a): 35Google Scholar), presumably because of the presence of decavanadate-dependent intermolecular links. We are currently defining conditions that allow fusion of vesicles to larger structures reproducibly and have already obtained micrometer-long tubes appropriate for two-dimensional crystallographic analysis. 2F. Delavoie, et al., manuscript in preparation. As discussed elsewhere, the phosphorylated FITC-ATPase in these arrays should probably be classified as an E1P-like form (or perhaps a transition state-like form) (5Champeil P. Henao F. Lacapère J.-J. McIntosh D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 276: 5795-5803Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), and the remarkable resistance of the aspartyl phosphate to hydrolysis by water confirms this classification. Structural analysis of these arrays by electron microscopy (by projection and three-dimensional reconstruction methods) should be of considerable interest. The fact that the phosphorylated FITC-ATPase remained stable after more than 1 week in the presence of a solubilizing concentration of detergent (Fig. 1 b) might also open the way toward the future three-dimensional crystallization of a phosphorylated form of ATPase and its analysis by x-ray diffraction. This would provide insight into the detailed structure of at least one of the various phosphorylated intermediates of the Ca2+pump and into the conformational flexibility of the pump."
https://openalex.org/W2065474525,"The quaternary structures of monomeric and dimeric Drosophila non-claret disjunctional (ncd) constructs were investigated using synchrotron x-ray and neutron solution scattering, and their low resolution shapes were restoredab initio from the scattering data. The experimental curves were further compared with those computed from crystallographic models of one monomeric and three available dimeric ncd structures in the microtubule-independent ADP-bound state. These comparisons indicate that accounting for the missing parts in the crystal structures for all these constructs is indispensable to obtain reasonable fits to the scattering patterns. A ncd construct (MC6) lacking the coiled-coil region is monomeric in solution, but the calculated scattering from the crystallographic monomer yields a poor fit to the data. A tentative configuration of the missing C-terminal residues in the form of an antiparallel β-sheet was found that significantly improves the fit. The atomic model of a short dimeric ncd construct (MC5) without 2-fold symmetry is found to fit the data better than the symmetric models. Addition of the C-terminal residues to both head domains gives an excellent fit to the x-ray and neutron experimental data, although the orientation of the β-sheet differs from that of the monomer. The solution structure of the long ncd construct (MC1) including complete N-terminal coiled-coil and motor domains is modeled by adding a straight coiled-coil section to the model of MC5. The quaternary structures of monomeric and dimeric Drosophila non-claret disjunctional (ncd) constructs were investigated using synchrotron x-ray and neutron solution scattering, and their low resolution shapes were restoredab initio from the scattering data. The experimental curves were further compared with those computed from crystallographic models of one monomeric and three available dimeric ncd structures in the microtubule-independent ADP-bound state. These comparisons indicate that accounting for the missing parts in the crystal structures for all these constructs is indispensable to obtain reasonable fits to the scattering patterns. A ncd construct (MC6) lacking the coiled-coil region is monomeric in solution, but the calculated scattering from the crystallographic monomer yields a poor fit to the data.

The two kinesin motors that have been investigated in the most detail are conventional kinesin, a member of the kinesin heavy chain subfamily, and Drosophilancd1 (Fig.1), which belongs to the C-terminal subfamily, which is the largest and most divergent subfamily (1Kim A.J. Endow S.A. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 3861-3862PubMed Google Scholar). Both proteins are dimers and have a three-domain structure. Their motor domains, which are some 340 residues long, contain the ATP- and microtubule-binding sites. Dimerization is mediated by a stalk domain predicted to form an α-helical coiled-coil. In conventional kinesin, the coiled-coil domain is predicted to be interrupted by hinge regions (2Bloom G.S. Endow S.A. Protein Profile. 1995; 2: 1105-1171PubMed Google Scholar), which increase the flexibility of the entire molecule. In contrast, ncd has a continuous, uninterrupted coiled-coil. The third domain is a small globular tail responsible for cargo binding. Conventional kinesin has its motor domain at the N terminus of its polypeptide chain and moves processively to the plus end of microtubules, making several hundred steps before detaching (3Howard J. Hudspeth A.J. Vale R.D. Nature. 1989; 342: 154-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (749) Google Scholar, 4Block S.M. Goldstein L.S.B. Schnapp B.J.

In contrast, ncd has its motor domain at the C terminus of the polypeptide chain (6Chandra R. Salmon E.D. Erickson H.P. Lockhart A. Endow S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9005-9013Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and moves to the minus end of microtubules (7Walker R.A. Salmon E.D. Endow S.A. Nature. 1990; 347: 780-782Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). There is growing evidence that ncd is not processive (8deCastro M.J. Ho C.H. Stewart R.J. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 5076-5081Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 9Foster K.A. Gilbert S.P. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 1784-1791Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Although conventional kinesins and C-terminal motors move to opposite ends of microtubules, the three-dimensional structures of their motor domains are remarkably similar (10Kull F.J. Sablin E.P. Lau R. Fletterick R.J. Vale R. Nature. 1996; 380: 550-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (581) Google Scholar, 11Sablin E.P. Kull J.F. Cooke R. Vale R.D. Fletterick R.J.

Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 1769-1776Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Therefore, the opposite directionality cannot be explained on the basis of the crystal structures of their motor domains. Studies of the three-dimensional structure of dimeric kinesin and ncd motor domains on microtubules in the presence of 5′-adenylylimidodiphosphate provided a valuable hint (14Arnal I. Metoz F. DeBonis S. Wade R.H. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 1265-1270Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 15Hirose K. Lockhart A. Cross R. Amos L.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 9539-9544Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). In both studies, it was clearly shown that the motor-microtubule complexes have one attached and one unattached head per tubulin dimer. The unattached heads of kinesin and ncd have distinctly different conformations and tilt toward the microtubule plus end for kinesin and toward the microtubule minus end for ncd. This suggested at once that directionality could be determined by differences in the dimer conformations. The crystal structures of dimeric kinesin (16Kozielski F. Sack S. Marx A. Thormählen M.

Structure Fold. Des. 1999; 7: 1407-1416Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (48) Google Scholar), all in the microtubule-independent ADP form, do indeed have different overall conformations. Only one crystal structure is currently available for dimeric kinesin, and this displays an asymmetric conformation, with the two heads being related to each other by a rotation of about 120°. For ncd, three different dimeric crystal structures from two independent studies are available. The first dimeric ncd structure has a perfect 2-fold symmetry, with two identical heads (17Sablin E.P. Case R.B. Dai S.C. Hart C.L. Ruby A. Vale R.D. Fletterick R.J. Nature. 1998; 395: 813-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). The two ncd dimers in the asymmetric unit of the crystal form of the second study are different (18Kozielski F. De Bonis S. Burmeister W.P. Cohen-Addad C. Wade R.H. Structure Fold. Des. 1999; 7: 1407-1416Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (48) Google Scholar). In one dimer, the two heads are related by a 179° rotation about an axis defined by the coiled-coil, whereas in the other one, the second head is rotated about 10° away from the 2-fold symmetry position. Comparison between experimental solution scattering curves and those evaluated from crystallographic structures is an established method to verify the structural similarity between macromolecules in crystals and in solution (19Svergun D.I. Barberato C. Koch M.H.J. Fetler L. Vachette P. Proteins. 1997; 27: 110-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 20Trewhella J. Curr. Opin. Struct.

Chem. 2000; 275: 297-303Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The present x-ray and neutron scattering study aims to check the three available dimeric ncd crystal structures against the solution scattering data. The structures of several monomeric and dimeric ncd constructs are analyzed, and an attempt is made to model the conformation of the C-terminal region, which has not been resolved in any of the known ncd crystal structures thus far. The plasmids pET/MC1, pET/MC5, and pET/MC6 were a kind gift of Sharon Endow (Duke Medical Center, Durham, NC). All protein purification steps were performed at 4 °C. The purification of monomeric MC6 (corresponding to residues Met333-Lys700 of ncd and 14 additional amino acids), dimeric MC5 (corresponding to residues Ala295-Lys700 and 14 additional amino acids), and dimeric MC1 (corresponding to residues Leu209-Lys700 of ncd and 13 additional amino acids) was performed as described previously (6Chandra R. Salmon E.D. Erickson H.P. Lockhart A. Endow S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9005-9013Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), with some modifications. Cells were grown overnight at 37 °C in 2 liters of Luria-Bertani medium supplemented with 150 mg/ml ampicillin and induced with 0.05 mm/ml isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside. The temperature was lowered to 20 °C, and the cells were further induced for 12 h. The cells were centrifuged and passed twice through a French press and centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 1 h. Further purification steps were performed as described previously (6Chandra R. Salmon E.D. Erickson H.P. Lockhart A. Endow S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9005-9013Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As an additional step, the proteins were concentrated using a CENTRICON YM-30 (Amicon) and loaded onto a self-packed gel filtration column (Sephacryl S-300; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) previously equilibrated in buffer A (20 mm PIPES, pH 7.4, 200 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 1 mm EGTA). The eluted peak fractions were concentrated, and fractions of 150 μl/tube in the concentration range of 1–20 mg/ml were frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C until use. Albumin (67 kDa), ovalbumin (43 kDa), chymotrypsinogen (25 kDa), and ribonuclease A (13.7 kDa) were used as standards. For data collection, the freshly thawed proteins were either measured directly in 100-μl quartz cuvettes, centrifuged at 15,000 ×g for 30 min at 4 °C, or subjected to an additional gel filtration to obtain the protein solutions under the best possible monodisperse conditions. Equilibrium binding studies performed at 24.7 °C showed that in the presence of different nucleotides, MC1 has a tendency to aggregate (22Foster K.A. Correia J.J. Gilbert S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 35307-35318Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Additional experiments indicated that the protein is more stable at lower temperatures. Therefore, the x-ray scattering measurements were performed at 12 °C, and the neutron scattering experiments were performed at 6 °C. The synchrotron radiation x-ray scattering data were collected on the X33 camera (23Koch M.H.J. Bordas J. Nucl. Instrum. Methods. 1983; 208: 461-469Crossref Scopus (287) Google Scholar, 24Boulin C.

Dauvergne F. Nucl. Instrum. Methods. 1982; 201: 223-224Crossref Scopus (139) Google Scholar). The scattering patterns were recorded at a sample-detector distance of 2.0 m to cover the range of momentum transfer 0.23 nm−1 < s < 3.5 nm−1 (s = 4πsinθ/λ, 2θ is the scattering angle, and λ = 0.15 nm is the wavelength). The data were normalized to the intensity of the incident beam and corrected for the detector response, the scattering of the buffer was subtracted, and the difference curves were scaled for protein concentration. All procedures involved statistical error propagation using the SAPOKO program. 2D. I. Svergun and M. Koch, unpublished observations. The data obtained on samples with protein concentrations between 1 and 20 mg/ml were extrapolated to zero concentration following standard procedures (27Feigin L.A. Svergun D.I. Structure Analysis by X-ray and Neutron Scattering. Plenum Press, New York1987: 70Google Scholar). For MC5 and MC1, the data were also collected at a sample-detector distance of 3.5 m covering the range 0.13 nm−1 < s < 2.0 nm−1 and merged with the higher angle data to yield the final composite scattering curves. The molar masses of the solutes were calculated by comparison with the forward scattering from reference solutions of bovine serum albumin (molar mass = 66 kDa). The maximum dimensions of the particles in solution (D max) were estimated using the orthogonal expansion program ORTOGNOM (28Svergun D.I. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 258-267Crossref Scopus (106) Google Scholar). The forward scattering I(0) and the radii of gyration (R g) were evaluated using the Guinier approximation (27Feigin L.A. Svergun D.I. Structure Analysis by X-ray and Neutron Scattering. Plenum Press, New York1987: 70Google Scholar) and the indirect transform package GNOM (29Svergun D.I. Semenyuk A.V. Feigin L.A. Acta Crystallogr. 1988; A44: 244-250Crossref Scopus (277) Google Scholar,30Svergun D.I. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1992; 25: 495-503Crossref Scopus (2987) Google Scholar), the latter of which also provided the distance distribution function p(r) of the particles. Neutron scattering experiments on MC5 were performed on the D22 small-angle scattering instrument at the Institut Laue-Langevin in Grenoble, France (31Büttner H.G. Lelièvre-Berna E. Pinet F. The Yellow Book, Guide to Neutron Research Facilities at the ILL. Institut Laue-Langevin, Grenoble, France1996: 76-77Google Scholar). Samples with protein concentrations between 1 and 10 mg/ml were contained in quartz cells (Helma) of 1.0- and 2.0-mm optical path length for H2O and D2O solutions, respectively. The data were collected using neutrons with a wavelength of λ = 0.6 nm and a spectral width (Δλ/λ) of 8% with a sample detector distance of 4.0 m, to cover the range of momentum transfer 0.1 nm−1 < s < 2.3 nm−1. Data were corrected for buffer scattering and normalized to the scattering of 1.0 mm of H2O, in the standard manner. The molar mass of the solute was computed from the normalized data extrapolated to infinite dilution and to zero scattering angle (32Zaccai G. Jacrot B. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Bioeng. 1983; 12: 139-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 33Jacrot B. Zaccai G. Biopolymers. 1981; 20: 2414-2426Crossref Scopus (290) Google Scholar). The atomic model of the monomeric ncd was taken from the kinesin home page, and the models of dimeric ncd were taken from the Protein Data Bank (34Bernstein F.C. Koetzle T.F. Williams G.J.B.

The scattering curves from the atomic models were calculated using the CRYDAM program, 3M. Malfois and D. I. Svergun, manuscript in preparation. an enhanced version of the CRYSOL (35Svergun D.I. Barberato C. Koch M.H.J. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1995; 28: 768-773Crossref Scopus (2790) Google Scholar) and CRYSON programs (36Svergun D.I. Richards S. Koch M.H.J. Sayers Z. Kuprin S. Zaccai G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2267-2272Crossref PubMed Scopus (805) Google Scholar) that takes the scattering from the solvation shell into account. The macromolecule is surrounded by a 0.3-nm-thick hydration layer with an adjustable density (ρ b ) that may differ from that of the bulk solvent (ρ s ). The scattering from the particle in solution is I(s)=‖Aa(s)−ρsAs(s)+δρbAb(s)‖2ΩEquation 1 where A a (s) is the scattering amplitude from the particle in vacuo,A s (s) andA b (s) are, respectively, the scattering amplitudes from the excluded volume and the hydration layer, both with unitary density δρ b =ρ b − ρ s , and < > stands for the average over all particle orientations (Ω is the solid angle in reciprocal space, s =(s, Ω)). The program uses the multipole expansion of the scattering amplitudes to facilitate the spherical average in Eq. 1. Given the atomic coordinates, the program fits the experimental scattering curve by adjusting the excluded volume of the particle V and the contrast of the hydration layerδρ b to minimize the discrepancy χ2=1N−1∑j=1NI(sj)−Iexp(sj)ς(sj)2Equation 2 where N is the number of experimental points, andI(s),I exp(s), andς(s) denote the calculated intensity, the experimental intensity, and its standard deviation, respectively. The low resolution shapes of the ncd constructs were determinedab initio from the x-ray scattering curves. To remove the scattering contribution due to the internal structure of the particles, appropriate constants were subtracted from the experimental data to ensure that the intensity decays as s−4, following Porod's law (37Porod G. Glatter O. Kratky O. Small-angle X-ray Scattering. Academic Press, London1982: 17-51Google Scholar) for homogeneous particles. This procedure yields an approximation of the shape scattering curve (i.e.scattering due to the excluded volume of the particle filled by constant density), and these data were used in the ab initioanalysis (38Svergun D.I. Biophys. J. 1999; 76: 2879-2886Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1756) Google Scholar). A sphere of diameter D max is filled by densely packed small spheres (dummy atoms) of radiusr 0 ≪ D max. The structure of this dummy atoms model is defined by configuration vector X, assigning an index to each atom corresponding to solvent (0) or solute particle (1Kim A.J. Endow S.A. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 3861-3862PubMed Google Scholar). The scattering intensity from the dummy atoms model is computed as I(s)=2π2∑l=0∞∑m=−ll‖Alm(s)‖2Equation 3 where the partial amplitudes are (38Svergun D.I. Biophys. J. 1999; 76: 2879-2886Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1756) Google Scholar, 39Stuhrmann H.B. Acta Crystallogr. 1970; A26: 297-306Crossref Scopus (153) Google Scholar) as shown below. Alm(s)=il2/πva∑jjl(srj)Ylm*(ωj)Equation 4 Here, v a = (4πr 03/3)/0.74 is the displaced volume per dummy atom, the sum runs over the atoms withX j = 1 (particle atoms),r j and ω j are their polar coordinates, and j l (x) denotes the spherical Bessel function. In keeping with the low resolution of the solution scattering data, the method searches for a configurationX minimizing f(X) = χ2+αP(X), where α > 0 is a positive parameter, and the penalty termP(X) ensures that the dummy atoms model has low resolution with respect to the packing radiusr0. The minimization is performed starting from a random configuration using the simulated annealing method (40Kirkpatrick S. Gelatt Jr., C.D. Vecci M.P. Science. 1983; 220: 671-680Crossref PubMed Scopus (31663) Google Scholar); the details of the shape determination procedure are presented elsewhere (38Svergun D.I. Biophys. J. 1999; 76: 2879-2886Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1756) Google Scholar, 41Svergun D.I. Malfois M. Koch M.H.J. Wigneshweraraj S.R. Buck M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4210-4214Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). This construct includes residues Met333-Lys700 of ncd (6Chandra R. Salmon E.D. Erickson H.P. Lockhart A. Endow S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9005-9013Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and corresponds to the complete motor domain and part of α7 forming the core-linker interface. This well-characterized ncd motor fragment is known to be monomeric in solution at low concentrations. At concentrations of up to 10 μm, there is no indication that MC6 forms aggregates (22Foster K.A. Correia J.J. Gilbert S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 35307-35318Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). A very similar construct (Arg335-Lys700) has been crystallized, and its structure has been solved in the ADP form to 2.5 Å resolution (11Sablin E.P. Kull J.F. Cooke R. Vale R.D. Fletterick R.J. Nature. 1996; 380: 555-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). Compared with MC6, the crystallographic model includes 321 amino acids, lacking the first 14 N-terminal and the last 33 C-terminal residues. The coordinates of a head domain from the dimeric ncd structure (18Kozielski F. De Bonis S. Burmeister W.P. Cohen-Addad C. Wade R.H. Structure Fold. Des. 1999; 7: 1407-1416Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (48) Google Scholar) that includes the N-terminal α7 allowed us to complement the model at the N terminus of the protein starting from residue Met333. Additionally, loop L11, which is present in the monomeric structure (11Sablin E.P. Kull J.F. Cooke R. Vale R.D. Fletterick R.J. Nature. 1996; 380: 555-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar) but absent in the two dimeric crystal structures (17Sablin E.P. Case R.B. Dai S.C. Hart C.L. Ruby A. Vale R.D. Fletterick R.J. Nature. 1998; 395: 813-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar, 18Kozielski F. De Bonis S. Burmeister W.P. Cohen-Addad C. Wade R.H. Structure Fold. Des. 1999; 7: 1407-1416Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (48) Google Scholar), was added. The completeness of the crystallographic model was thus increased from 87% to 91%, and the modified atomic model of monomeric MC6 is presented in Fig. 2, top row. The processed scattering curve from MC6 in Fig.3 yields a molecular mass of 41 ± 3 kDa, in good agreement with the value estimated from the primary sequence of the monomeric protein (44 kDa). In contrast, the scattering curve computed by the CRYDAM program from the model in Fig. 2(top row) gives a poor fit to the experimental data (Fig. 3, ■; χ = 2.1). The maximum dimension and the radius of gyration calculated from the crystallographic model (7.5 and 2.29 nm, respectively) are significantly smaller than their experimental counterparts (9.0 ± 0.5 and 2.58 ± 0.04 nm, respectively). An attempt to improve the fit by assuming partial dimerization of MC6 in solution yielded an only marginally lower discrepancy (χ = 1.9 at 4% of dimers). It can thus be concluded that MC6 is monomeric in solution, even at relatively high (up to 20 mg/ml) concentrations, but it has a significantly more extended conformation than the modified crystallographic model in Fig. 2 (top row). To obtain independent information about the overall structure of MC6 in solution, its shape was restored ab initio from the experimental data as described under “Materials and Methods.” Several independent restorations starting from different random approximations yielded reproducible results, and a typical solution is presented in Fig. 2 (middle row) in the orientation that best matches the crystallographic model. The calculated scattering curve from the ab initio model (Fig. 2, ○) deviates significantly from the raw experimental data at higher angles, as it should, but neatly fits the shape scattering curve with χ = 0.73. The ab initio restoration thus confirms that the solution structure of MC6 is more anisometric than the crystallographic model. This discrepancy is not surprising given that about 30 C-terminal residues are still missing in the model in Fig. 2 (top row). These residues are disordered in all ncd crystal structures solved thus far (11Sablin E.P. Kull J.F. Cooke R. Vale R.D. Fletterick R.J. Nature. 1996; 380: 555-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar, 17Sablin E.P. Case R.B. Dai S.C. Hart C.L. Ruby A. Vale R.D. Fletterick R.J.

Des. 1999; 7: 1407-1416Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The missing region represents about 9% of the molar mass of the protein and should make a significant contribution to the solution scattering pattern. To find a plausible configuration of this region in solution, the C-terminal residues were added to the atomic model of MC6 in several possible conformations (a two- or three-stranded antiparallel β-sheet or a helix-turn-helix motif) and in different orientations with respect to the atomic model. A dozen models were generated, and for each model, the agreement with the experimental data was computed using the CRYDAM program. The solution scattering patterns were rather sensitive to the configuration and orientation of this region, and the discrepancy computed for these models ranged from χ = 0.96 to χ = 2.7. The models in which the last C-terminal residues form an antiparallel two-stranded β-sheet yielded systematically better fits than those forming a three-stranded antiparallel β-sheet or a helix-turn-helix motif. The best model in Fig. 2 (shown in the bottom row) provides an excellent fit (Fig. 3, ▵) to the experimental data with χ = 0.96 and represents a probable configuration of the missing C-terminal region in solution. The ncd construct MC5 (6Chandra R. Salmon E.D. Erickson H.P. Lockhart A. Endow S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9005-9013Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) contains residues Ala295 -Lys700 of ncd and 14 additional residues at the N terminus of the protein. The protein contains part of the N-terminal coiled-coil region, linker, and the complete motor domain. MC5 has previously been shown to be a dimer in solution (6Chandra R. Salmon E.D. Erickson H.P. Lockhart A. Endow S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9005-9013Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The molecular mass computed from the composite x-ray scattering curve of MC5 in Fig. 4 was 75 ± 8 kDa, confirming that the protein forms dimers in solution (the value estimated from the primary sequence of the dimer is 80 kDa). The D max and R g values are 13 ± 1 and 4.05 ± 0.04 nm, respectively. Three available crystallographic models were tested against the scattering data. The first published crystal structure (17Sablin E.P. Case R.B. Dai S.C. Hart C.L. Ruby A. Vale R.D. Fletterick R.J. Nature. 1998; 395: 813-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar) has been solved using a similar ncd construct encoding residues Glu281-Lys700. The final model contains residues Leu303-Met672, thus missing the N-terminal residues 281–302, the loop L11 region (residues Lys588-Thr596), and the C-terminal residues Thr673-Lys700. The crystal structure contains one head domain per asymmetric unit. This dimeric ncd structure (dimer 1) has a perfect 2-fold symmetry about the coiled-coil axis. The second study (18Kozielski F. De Bonis S. Burmeister W.P. Cohen-Addad C. Wade R.H. Structure Fold. Des. 1999; 7: 1407-1416Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (48) Google Scholar) is based on a different crystal form containing two ncd dimers per asymmetric unit. The overall conformation of the two heads in one of the dimers (dimer 2) is similar to that of dimer 1. In the second dimer (dimer 3), the head domains are not related by crystallographic symmetry. The second head domain is rotated about 10° away from the 2-fold symmetry position. The scattering curves computed from dimers 1 and 2 yielded the fits to the experimental data with χ = 1.53 (the models and the fits are not shown). Dimer 3 (Fig. 5, top row) provided the fit to the experimental data (Fig. 4, ■) with χ = 1.28 atV = 107 nm3 and δρb = 46 electrons/nm3. Because this model, like that of MC6 in the previous section, lacked the L11 loop and C-terminal region, an attempt was made to improve the fit by adding these regions to each of the monomers. Using the same orientation of the C-terminal loop as in Fig. 3, however, worsened the fit (χ = 1.41; curve not shown). To further understand this discrepancy, a low resolution model of the particle shape was restored ab initio, assuming P2 symmetry (this assumption is justified at low resolution). The ab initio model is presented in Fig. 5 (middle row), and the fit is presented in Fig. 4 (○). This model suggests that the orientation of the C-terminal loop makes the particle more anisometric in the plane of the 2-fold axis. Assuming that the orientation of the loop may change upon dimerization, several models differing with regard to orientation of the β-sheet were constructed and validated against the scattering data. The best model presented in Fig. 5,bottom row, yielded a fit to the experimental data with χ = 0.98 at V = 111 nm3 and δρb = 44 electrons/nm3 (Fig. 4, ▵).Figure 5Models of the MC5 dimer.

The maximum dimension of the particle was found to be 12 ± 1 nm in both H2O and D2O. The radii of gyration were 3.96 ± 0.12 and 3.88 ± 0.05 nm in H2O and D2O, respectively. The difference between the x-ray and neutron scattering curves should be attributed to the influence of the hydration shell. As demonstrated previously (34Bernstein F.C. Koetzle T.F. Williams G.J.B. Meyer Jr., E.F. Brice M.D. Rodgers J.R. Kennard O. Shimanouchi T. Tasumi M. J. Mol. Biol. 1977; 112: 535-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (8183) Google Scholar), bound water around the protein surface is denser than bulk water, and this makes the particles appear larger for x-rays, smaller for neutrons in D2O, and nearly unchanged for neutrons in H2O (the scattering length density of the solvent is close to zero in the last case). A direct comparison of the three scattering patterns in Fig. 6 displays the same trend as observed earlier for other proteins and clearly illustrates the influence of the hydration shell (36Svergun D.I. Richards S. Koch M.H.J. Sayers Z. Kuprin S. Zaccai G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2267-2272Crossref PubMed Scopus (805) Google Scholar). The neutron scattering patterns in H2O and D2O computed from the atomic model of MC5 in Fig. 5, top row, fitted the experimental data with χ = 1.40 and 2.47, respectively (Fig.7). Addition of the missing C-terminal residues in the conformation determined from the x-ray data (Fig. 5,bottom row) improves the agreement for both neutron data sets, yielding χ = 1.06 and χ = 1.78 for the curves recorded in H2O and D2O, respectively. This improvement of the fit to the neutron data lends further credit to the model in Fig. 5, bottom row, deduced solely from x-ray measurements.Figure 7Neutron scattering curves from MC5 in H2O and in D2O (●) and calculated scattering patterns from the atomic model of the MC5 dimer without the missing C-terminal region (■) and with the modeled region added as shown in Fig. 5, bottom row (▵).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) MC1 contains residues Leu209-Lys700 (including the complete predicted coiled-coil region and motor domain) of full-length ncd and 13 additional residues at the N terminus of the protein (6Chandra R. Salmon E.D. Erickson H.P. Lockhart A. Endow S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9005-9013Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This construct has been shown to be dimeric in solution. The composite x-ray scattering curve from MC1 in Fig. 8yields a molecular mass of 123 ± 12 kDa, which agrees well with the expected value of 114 kDa. The maximum dimension of the construct (25 ± 3 nm) and its radius of gyration (6.7 ± 0.3 nm) suggest that the particle is extremely elongated. Compared with MC5 (D max = 13 ± 1 nm), MC1 has 86 additional residues in the N-terminal region predicted to form an α-helical coiled-coil. Because the pitch of the helix is 0.54 nm, the expected length of the additional 86 residues would be 12.9 nm, yieldingD max = 25.9 nm for the complete MC1 protein, in good agreement with the experimental value. An ab initio low resolution model of MC1 in Fig. 9(middle row) also suggests a linearly extended form of the additional coil-coil region. A tentative model of the MC1 was therefore built by extending the coiled-coil portion of the MC5 construct in Fig.5 by 86 residues, as illustrated in Fig. 9, top row. The scattering pattern computed from this model yields a reasonable fit to the experimental data (Fig. 8, ■) with χ = 1.47 atV = 125 nm3 and δρb = 42 electrons/nm3. To establish the configuration of the missing C-terminal region, several plausible models were tested as described above for the MC5 construct. Addition of the C-terminal region in the conformation found for the monomeric MC6 (Fig. 3) worsened the fit to the experimental data, but the configuration identical to that for MC5 (Fig. 5, right panel) yielded the best fit (Fig. 8, ▵) with χ = 0.95 at V= 135 nm3 and δρb = 36 electrons/nm3. The final model of MC1 shown in Fig.9, bottom row, suggests that the relative orientation of the two heads is independent of the length of the coiled-coil.Figure 9Models of the MC1 dimer.

The right views are rotated as described in the Fig. 2 legend.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The present analysis of monomeric and dimeric constructs of the microtubule-dependent molecular motor ncd indicates that parts missing in the crystal structures must be taken into account for successful fitting of the solution scattering data. The modeling of the missing C-terminal region up to Lys700, which has not been resolved in any of the ncd crystal structures thus far, was crucial in this respect. It was found that the most probable configuration of this region is an antiparallel β-sheet. Of course, the orientations of this region presented in Figs. 2, 5, and 9 should be considered as tentative models because they were based on fitting solution scattering data and not on crystallographic information. With this caveat in mind, it is interesting to note that the probable orientation of the C-terminal fragment changes upon dimerization (i.e. from MC6 to MC5) but remains stable in the dimeric protein independent of the coiled-coil lengths in the ncd constructions (MC5 to MC1). One of the most important findings of the present study is that the published crystallographic structures of the dimeric ncd in the ADP-bound form (17Sablin E.P. Case R.B. Dai S.C. Hart C.L. Ruby A. Vale R.D. Fletterick R.J. Nature. 1998; 395: 813-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar, 18Kozielski F. De Bonis S. Burmeister W.P. Cohen-Addad C. Wade R.H. Structure Fold. Des. 1999; 7: 1407-1416Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (48) Google Scholar) are compatible with the solution scattering data from the MC5 construct. This agrees with the results of Stoneet al. (42Stone D.B. Hjelm Jr., R.P. Mendelson R.A. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 4938-4947Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) obtained on three other dimericDrosophila ncd constructs. Although the differences between the three available crystal structures are rather small, the structure lacking the 2-fold symmetry axis along the coiled-coil domain yields a somewhat better fit. It is interesting that a nonsymmetric crystallographic model of dimeric rat kinesin has recently been found to provide better agreement with the solution scattering data ofDrosophila kinesin (43Kozielski F. Svergun D. Zaccai J. Wade D. Koch M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1267-1275Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The longest dimeric ncd construct analyzed in the present study, MC1, covers the entire N-terminal coiled-coil domain and catalytic motor core. The model obtained by addition of a straight coiled-coil region to the above-mentioned model of MC5 yields a remarkably good fit to the solution scattering data. This suggests that MC1 has a straight coiled-coil domain, whereas the relative orientation of the two heads is independent of the length of the coiled-coil domain. This creates some confidence that working with truncated motor protein fragments instead of full-length proteins does not alter the overall shape of these molecules. It has been demonstrated in the present study that the overall conformation of the dimeric ncd in solution agrees with the crystallographic models (17Sablin E.P. Case R.B. Dai S.C. Hart C.L. Ruby A.

Des. 1999; 7: 1407-1416Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (48) Google Scholar). A tentative configuration of the C-terminal loop in monomeric and dimeric ncd is proposed, based on the scattering data. Future x-ray and neutron scattering experiments will include the investigation of nucleotide-dependent conformational changes of dimeric ncd in solution. In addition, different members of the highly divergent C-terminal subfamily should be compared to determine whether they have the same overall conformation.
