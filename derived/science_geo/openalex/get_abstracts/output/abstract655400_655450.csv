https://openalex.org/W3038656035,"Amongst the most robust consensus related to the COVID-19 disease is that the elderly are by far the most vulnerable population group. Hence, public authorities target older people in order to convince them to comply with preventive measures. However, we still know little about older people’s attitudes and compliance toward these measures. In this research, I aim to improve our understanding of elderly people’s responses to the pandemic using data from 27 countries. Results are surprising and quite troubling. Elderly people’s response is substantially similar to their fellow citizens in their 50’s and 60’s. This research (i) provides the first thorough description of the most vulnerable population’s attitudes and compliance in a comparative perspective (ii) suggest that governments’ strategies toward elderly people are far from successful and (iii) shows that methodologically, we should be more cautious in treating age as having a linear effect on COVID-19 related outcomes."
https://openalex.org/W3039678254,"In this study, a facile, ecological and economical green method is described for the fabrication of iron (Fe), copper (Cu) and silver (Ag) nanoparticles (NPs) from the extract of Syzygium cumini leaves. The obtained metal NPs were categorized using UV/Vis, SEM, TEM, FTIR and EDX-ray spectroscopy techniques. The Fe-, Cu- and Ag-NPs were crystalline, spherical and size ranged from 40−52, 28−35 and 11−19 nm, respectively. The Ag-NPs showed excellent antimicrobial activities against methicillin- and vancomycin-resistance Staphylococcus aureus bacterial strains and Aspergillus flavus and A. parasiticus fungal species. Furthermore, the aflatoxins (AFs) production was also significantly inhibited when compared with the Fe- and Cu-NPs. In contrast, the adsorption results of NPs with aflatoxin B1 (AFB1) were observed as following order Fe->Cu->Ag-NPs. The Langmuir isotherm model well described the equilibrium data by the sorption capacity of Fe-NPs (105.3 ng mg-1), Cu-NPs (88.5 ng mg-1) and Ag-NPs (81.7 ng mg-1). The adsorption was found feasible, endothermic and follow the pseudo-second order kinetic model as revealed by the thermodynamic and kinetic studies. The present findings suggests that the green synthesis of metal NPs is a simple, sustainable, non-toxic, economical and energy-effective as compared to the others conventional approaches. In addition, synthesized metal NPs might be a promising AFs adsorbent for the detoxification of AFB1 in human and animal food/feed."
https://openalex.org/W3039555161,"Distracted driving has been considered one of the main reasons for traffic crashes in recent times, especially among young drivers. The objectives of this study were to identify the distracting activities in which young drivers engage, assess the most distracting ones based on their experiences, and investigate the factors that might increase crash risk. The data were collected through a self-report questionnaire. Most participants reported frequent cell phone use while driving. Other reported activities include adjusting audio devices, chatting with passengers, smoking, eating, and drinking. A structural equation model was constructed to identify the latent variables that have a significant influence on crash risk. The analysis showed that in-vehicle distractions had a high effect on the crash likelihood. The results also indicated that dangerous driving behavior had a direct effect on the crash risk probability, as well as on the rash driving latent variables. The results provide insight into distracted driving behavior among young drivers and can be useful in developing enforcement and educational strategies to reduce this type of behavior."
https://openalex.org/W3040573042,"The objectives were to determine the effects of feeding different fiber types to healthy cats and cats with chronic kidney disease (CKD) on plasma metabolites and the fecal microbiome. Methods A cross-over study within a split-plot design was performed using healthy (n = 10) and CKD cats [IRIS Stage 1 and 2; n = 10]. Cats were fed dry Prescription Diet® k/d® Feline with chicken, during a pre-trial period and then randomly assigned to two fiber treatments for 4 weeks each. Treatment foods were formulated similar to pre-trial food, with the exception that they contained 0.500% betaine, 0.586% oat beta glucan, and either 0.407% short chain fructooligosaccharides (scFOS) fiber or 3.44% apple pomace. Both foods had similar crude fiber percent (2.0 and 2.1% for scFOS and apple pomace, respectively) whereas soluble fiber was 0.8 and 1.6%, respectively. Results Plasma metabolites separated cats based on health status. At baseline, cats with CKD had significantly higher circulating concentrations of creatinine, urea, and some microbial and host tryptophan metabolites including several indole sulfates and kynurenate. Healthy cats had higher concentrations of the antioxidant α-tocopherol after consuming apple pomace; alternatively, they had higher concentrations of inflammatory sphingolipid metabolites after consuming scFOS, but not after consuming apple pomace. The CKD cats had higher concentrations of the more oxidized glutathione metabolites after consuming apple pomace compared with scFOS, as well as higher concentrations of inflammatory sphingolipid metabolites after consuming apple pomace, but not scFOS. After consuming scFOS, CKD cats had lower concentrations of the phenolic uremic toxins guaiacol sulfate and 4-vinylphenol sulfate compared with after consuming apple pomace. At baseline, there were five significant microbiota OTU differences in CKD cats compared with healthy cats. Overall, the OTUs in CKD cats were more resistant to change after feeding either fiber source. Counts of an unclassified genus in the family S24-7 in the order Bacteroidales (OTU 100296), were lower in CKD cats compared with healthy cats at baseline (P = 0.001), but increased after consumption of food containing scFOS (P = 0.006). Linear regression analysis showed that this genus had significant negative correlations with several microbial uremic toxins. None of the baseline differences in OTUs between healthy and CKD cats changed after CKD cats consumed food containing apple pomace. Conclusions Health status impacts the influence of dietary fermentable fibers on the feline plasma metabolome and fecal microbiome. A more readily fermented fiber such as scFOS is preferable to apple pomace as a fiber source for cats with CKD."
https://openalex.org/W3039438556,"Plectranthus amboinicus (Lour.) Spreng is an aromatic medicinal herb known for its therapeutic and nutritional properties attributed by the presence of monoterpene and sesquiterpene compounds. Up until now, research on terpenoid biosynthesis has focused on a few mint species with economic importance such as thyme and oregano, yet the terpene synthases responsible for monoterpene production in P. amboinicus have not been described. Here we report the isolation, heterologous expression and functional characterization of a terpene synthase involved in P. amboinicus terpenoid biosynthesis. A putative monoterpene synthase gene (PamTps1) from P. amboinicus was isolated with an open reading frame of 1797 bp encoding a predicted protein of 598 amino acids with molecular weight of 69.6 kDa. PamTps1 shares 60–70% amino acid sequence similarity with other known terpene synthases of Lamiaceae. The in vitro enzymatic activity of PamTps1 demonstrated the conversion of geranyl pyrophosphate and farnesyl pyrophosphate exclusively into linalool and nerolidol, respectively, and thus PamTps1 was classified as a linalool/nerolidol synthase. In vivo activity of PamTps1 in a recombinant Escherichia coli strain revealed production of linalool and nerolidol which correlated with its in vitro activity. This outcome validated the multi-substrate usage of this enzyme in producing linalool and nerolidol both in in vivo and in vitro systems. The transcript level of PamTps1 was prominent in the leaf during daytime as compared to the stem. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and quantitative real-time PCR analyses showed that maximal linalool level was released during the daytime and lower at night following a diurnal circadian pattern which correlated with the PamTps1 expression pattern. The PamTps1 cloned herein provides a molecular basis for the terpenoid biosynthesis in this local herb that could be exploited for valuable production using metabolic engineering in both microbial and plant systems."
https://openalex.org/W3040346260,"Placenta-derived extracellular vesicles (EVs) are involved in communication between the placenta and maternal immune cells possibly leading to a modulation of maternal T-cell signaling components. The ability to identify EVs in maternal blood may lead to the development of diagnostic and treatment tools for pregnancy complications. The objective of this work was to differentiate EVs from bovine placenta (trophoblast) and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) by a label-free, non-invasive Raman spectroscopy technique. Extracellular vesicles were isolated by ultracentrifugation. Dynamic light scattering (DLS) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) were applied to verify the presence and the size distribution of EVs. Raman peaks at 728 cm-1 (collagen) and 1573 cm-1 (protein) were observed only in PBMC-derived EVs, while the peaks 702 cm-1 (cholesterol) and 1553 cm-1 (amide) appeared only in trophoblast-derived EVs. The discrimination of the Raman spectral fingerprints for both types of EVs from different animals was performed by principal component analysis (PCA) and linear discriminant analysis (LDA). The PCA and LDA results clearly segregated the spectral clusters between the two types of EVs. Moreover, the PBMC-derived EVs from different animals were indistinguishable, while the trophoblast-derived EVs from three placental samples of different gestational ages showed separate clusters. This study reports for the first time the Raman characteristic peaks for identification of PBMC and trophoblast-derived EVs. The development of this method also provides a potential tool for further studies investigating the causes and potential treatments for pregnancy complications."
https://openalex.org/W3038393560,"The maternal mortality rate in Indonesia is still high, at 305 per 100,000 live births. Several studies indicated maternal financial burden as one of the dimensions of access that influence a pregnant woman’s ability to receive adequate, high-quality medical care. This study aims to identify the association between the use of Indonesia’s national health insurance (JKN) and out-of-pocket (OOP) expenditures in accessing delivery services, using data from the Indonesian Family Life Survey 5. In addition, this study also investigated the relationship of JKN and the potential reduction of catastrophic delivery expenditures (CDEs) for delivery services. The results show that JKN was associated with reduced OOP expenditures for delivery as well as reduced risk of incurring CDE. However, some OOP expenditure for cost of delivery services still exists among mothers who used JKN during delivery, potentially due to factors such as medicine stock availability and inpatient care shortages."
https://openalex.org/W3040065177,"Rice paddy irrigation ponds can sustain surprisingly high taxonomic richness and make significant contributions to regional biodiversity. We evaluated the impacts of pesticides and other environmental stressors (including eutrophication, decreased macrophyte coverage, physical habitat destruction, and invasive alien species) on the taxonomic richness of freshwater animals in 21 irrigation ponds in Japan. We sampled a wide range of freshwater animals (reptiles, amphibians, fishes, mollusks, crustaceans, insects, annelids, bryozoans, and sponges) and surveyed environmental variables related to pesticide contamination and other stressors listed above. Statistical analyses comprised contraction of highly correlated environmental variables, best-subset model selection, stepwise model selection, and permutation tests. Results showed that: (i) probenazole (fungicide) was a significant stressor on fish (i.e., contamination with this compound had a significantly negative correlation with fish taxonomic richness), (ii) the interaction of BPMC (insecticide; also known as fenobucarb) and bluegill (invasive alien fish) was a significant stressor on a “large insect” category (Coleoptera, Ephemeroptera, Hemiptera, Lepidoptera, Odonata, and Trichoptera), (iii) the interaction of BPMC and concrete bank protection was a significant stressor on an “invertebrate” category, (iv) the combined impacts of BPMC and the other stressors on the invertebrate and large insect categories resulted in an estimated mean loss of taxonomic richness by 15% and 77%, respectively, in comparison with a hypothetical pond with preferable conditions."
https://openalex.org/W3038405775,"Objective To explore the application of deep neural networks (DNNs) and deep reinforcement learning (DRL) in wireless communication and accelerate the development of the wireless communication industry. Method This study proposes a simple cognitive radio scenario consisting of only one primary user and one secondary user. The secondary user attempts to share spectrum resources with the primary user. An intelligent power algorithm model based on DNNs and DRL is constructed. Then, the MATLAB platform is utilized to simulate the model. Results In the performance analysis of the algorithm model under different strategies, it is found that the second power control strategy is more conservative than the first. In the loss function, the second power control strategy has experienced more iterations than the first. In terms of success rate, the second power control strategy has more iterations than the first. In the average number of transmissions, they show the same changing trend, but the success rate can reach 1. In comparison with the traditional distributed clustering and power control (DCPC) algorithm, it is obvious that the convergence rate of the algorithm in this research is higher. The proposed DQN algorithm based on DRL only needs several steps to achieve convergence, which verifies its effectiveness. Conclusion By applying DNNs and DRL to model algorithms constructed in wireless scenarios, the success rate is higher and the convergence rate is faster, which can provide experimental basis for the improvement of later wireless communication networks."
https://openalex.org/W3039908516,"The logistics industry is a derivative industry of manufacturing services extraposition. A variety of strategies to develop the manufacturing industry are important programs of action for China's manufacturing strategic power, and it is of great significance to promote the high-quality development of the logistics industry. This paper takes strong manufacturing provinces with the development of the logistics industry as the research object and applies network DEA measuring the production efficiency and service efficiency of the logistics industry from 2004 to 2017. This paper adopts the “Made in China 2025” strategy as a natural experiment and uses double difference to study the impact of manufacturing policies on the high-quality development of the logistics industry. The empirical results show that compared with the Reference group, the impact of the “Made in China 2025” strategy led to a significant increase in the production efficiency and service efficiency of the experimental group. The group-based test based on innovation type shows that independent innovation has a significant positive effect on the high-quality development of the logistics industry, which shows that from the perspective of technological innovation, independent innovation is the main path of the “Made in China 2025” strategy to promote the high-quality development of the logistics industry. This paper not only identifies the causal relationship between the “Made in China 2025” strategy and the high-quality development of the logistics industry but also helps clarify the mechanism of how manufacturing policies improve the high-quality development of the logistics industry, which has important implications for further promoting the combined development between manufacturing and logistics."
https://openalex.org/W3039534849,"Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) are used to support professional learning at scale in many countries. The present study examined a MOOC named Flipped Classrooms that was specially designed for in-service teachers in China. This MOOC was offered for seven consecutive iterations across three years and allowed teachers to re-take this course in connection with their teaching practice. Overall, 16% of all 105,370 learners enrolled in at least two iterations of the MOOC. To understand their learning motivations, their learning engagement within the MOOC, and the connections they forged between the MOOC and their teaching, we conducted a mixed-methods study using multiple data sources including course registration records, course entry surveys, learning performance data, click logs, and semi-structured interviews. Results indicated that teacher-learners re-took the MOOC for various reasons such as refreshing domain understanding, improving grades, and addressing practical problems. Click log analysis found MOOC re-takers with different performance trajectories demonstrated distinct learning patterns across iterations. Qualitative analysis of the interview data revealed additional insights into learning within the MOOC and connections forged by the re-takers between the MOOC and their teaching practice. This study contributes fresh insights into the MOOC literature by investigating MOOC re-takers and sheds light on the promise of using MOOC to support networked professional learning. Implications for future MOOCs and teacher learning opportunities are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W3040161881,"This paper proposes an intersection management strategy for autonomous vehicles under the vehicle-to-infrastructure circumstance. All vehicles are supposed to be fully autonomous and can communicate with the intersection management unit to check the traffic situation. Priority of passing the intersection is decided by a static conflict matrix which represents the potential conflict between lanes of different directions and a dynamic information list which could capture the real-time occupation of each lane in the intersection. Compared with the existing approaches in the literature, the intersection management unit in our strategy is more like a database rather than a computational center, and therefore, requires less computational resource and more likely satisfies the real-time requirement in heavy traffic situations. Simulations are conducted using SUMO (Simulation of Urban MObility), in which the proposed strategy is compared with both fixed and adaptive traffic light methods. The results indicate that the proposed strategy could significantly reduce the average time delay caused by the intersection and the corresponding variance, which shows the efficiency and fairness of the proposed strategy in intersection management."
https://openalex.org/W3040276873,"Clinical trials often suffer from significant recruitment barriers, poor adherence, and dropouts, which increase costs and negatively affect trial outcomes. The aim of this study was to examine whether making it virtual and reward-based would enable nationwide recruitment, identify patients with variable disease severity, achieve high adherence, and reduce dropouts.In a siteless, virtual feasibility study, individuals with atopic dermatitis (AD) were recruited online. During the 8-week study, subjects used their smartphones weekly to photograph target AD lesions, and completed patient-oriented eczema measure (POEM) and treatment use questionnaires. In return, subjects were rewarded every week with personalized lifestyle reports based on their DNA.Over the course of the 11 day recruitment period, 164 (82% women and 18% men) filled in the form to participate, of which 65 fulfilled the inclusion criteria and signed the informed consent. Ten were excluded as they did not complete the mandatory study task of returning the DNA sample. 55 (91% women, 9% men) subjects returned the DNA sample and were enrolled throughout Denmark, the majority outside the Copenhagen capital region in rural areas with relatively low physician coverage. The mean age was 28.5 (SD ±9.5 years, range 18-52 years). The baseline POEM score was 14.5±5.6 (range 6-28). Based on the POEM, 7 individuals had mild, 28 had moderate, 17 had severe, and 3 had very severe eczema. The retention rate was 96% as 53 out of 55 enrolled completed the study. The adherence was very high, and more than 90% of all study tasks were completed. Follow up of 41 subjects showed that 90% would take part again or continue if the study had been longer.A virtual trial design enables recruitment with broad geographic reach and throughout the full spectrum of disease severity. Providing personalized genetic reports as a reward seems to contribute to high adherence and retention."
https://openalex.org/W3039559264,"We sequenced 25 isolates of phenotypically multidrug-resistant Salmonella Indiana (n = 11), Typhimurium (n = 8), and Enteritidis (n = 6) using both MinION long-read [SQK-LSK109 and flow cell (R9.4.1)] and MiSeq short-read (Nextera XT and MiSeq Reagent Kit v2) sequencing technologies to determine the advantages of each approach in terms of the characteristics of genome structure, antimicrobial resistance (AMR), virulence potential, whole-genome phylogeny, and pan-genome. The MinION reads were base-called in real-time using MinKnow 3.4.8 integrated with Guppy 3.0.7. The long-read-only assembly, Illumina-only assembly, and hybrid assembly pipelines of Unicycler 0.4.8 were used to generate the MinION, MiSeq, and hybrid assemblies, respectively. The MinION assemblies were highly contiguous compared to the MiSeq assemblies but lacked accuracy, a deficiency that was mitigated by adding the MiSeq short reads through the Unicycler hybrid assembly which corrected erroneous single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). The MinION assemblies provided similar predictions of AMR and virulence potential compared to the MiSeq and hybrid assemblies, although they produced more total false negatives of AMR genotypes, primarily due to failure in identifying tetracycline resistance genes in 11 of the 19 MinION assemblies of tetracycline-resistant isolates. The MinION assemblies displayed a large genetic distance from their corresponding MiSeq and hybrid assemblies on the whole-genome phylogenetic tree, indicating that the lower read accuracy of MinION sequencing caused incorrect clustering. The pan-genome of the MinION assemblies contained significantly more accessory genes and less core genes compared to the MiSeq and hybrid assemblies, suggesting that although these assemblies were more contiguous, their sequencing errors reduced accurate genome annotations. Our research demonstrates that MinION sequencing by itself provides an efficient assessment of the genome structure, antimicrobial resistance, and virulence potential of Salmonella; however, it is not sufficient for whole-genome phylogenetic and pan-genome analyses. MinION in combination with MiSeq facilitated the most accurate genomic analyses."
https://openalex.org/W3039689527,"Background The naïve neonatal gut is sensitive to early life experiences. Events during this critical developmental window may have life-long impacts on the gut microbiota. Two experiences that have been associated with variation in the gut microbiome in infancy are mode of delivery and feeding practices (eg, breastfeeding). It remains unclear whether these early experiences are responsible for microbial differences beyond toddlerhood. Aims Our study examined whether mode of delivery and infant feeding practices are associated with differences in the child and adolescent microbiome. Design, subjects, measures We used an adoption-sibling design to compare genetically related siblings who were reared together or apart. Gut microbiome samples were collected from 73 children (M = 11 years, SD = 3 years, range = 3–18 years). Parents reported on child breastfeeding history, age, sex, height, and weight. Mode of delivery was collected through medical records and phone interviews. Results Negative binomial mixed effects models were used to identify whether mode of delivery and feeding practices were related to differences in phylum and genus-level abundance of bacteria found in the gut of child participants. Covariates included age, sex, and body mass index. Genetic relatedness and rearing environment were accounted for as random effects. We observed a significant association between lack of breastfeeding during infancy and a greater number of the genus Bacteroides in stool in childhood and adolescence. Conclusion The absence of breastfeeding may impart lasting effects on the gut microbiome well into childhood."
https://openalex.org/W3039777865,"Introduction Stakeholder engagement can play an important role in increasing public trust and the understanding of scientific research and its impact. Frameworks for stakeholder identification exist, but these frameworks may not apply well to basic science and early stage translational research. Methods Four Clinical and Translational Science Award (CTSA) hubs led six focus groups and two semi-structured interviews using a semi-structured discussion guide to learn from basic science researchers about stakeholder engagement in their work. The 24 participants represented fourteen clinical and academic disciplines. Results Early stage translational researchers reported engagement with a broad array of stakeholders. Those whose research has a clinical focus reported working with a more diverse range of stakeholders than those whose work did not. Common barriers to stakeholder engagement were grouped into three major themes: a poor definition of concepts, absence of guidance, and limited resources. Discussion The National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS), the consortium of CTSAs, and the individual CTSA “hubs” are three actors that can help early stage translational researchers develop shared terms of reference, build the necessary skills, and assemble the appropriate resources for engaging stakeholders in Clinical and Translational Research. Getting this right will involve a coordinated push by all three entities."
https://openalex.org/W3040617692,"While access to support for individuals with disabilities has attracted international attention, children with disabilities and their families continue to face a range of barriers that limit their timely access to the needed support, including health service. This is even worse for children with disabilities living in resource poor settings like Bangladesh. The objective of this study was to determine the extent to which families of children with disabilities have knowledge about and access to government support for their children with disabilities in Bangladesh. We employed a cross-sectional study among 393 families of children with disabilities who sought services from the Centre for the Rehabilitation of the Paralysed for their children with disabilities in Bangladesh. We used chi-square test to measure the association between categorical variables and, Mann-Whitney U-test to compare mean across different sub-groups. Overall, family members of children with disabilities have limited knowledge about and access to government support. We found a significant association between knowledge and access to government support (p<0.001). Family members with children with disabilities aged younger than six years had less access to government support (p<0.001). We thus concluded with an urgent call on government agencies and service providers to provide relevant and timely information to families of children with disabilities to enable them to access the needed support."
https://openalex.org/W2915031084,"In this study, we deal with the problem of biological network alignment (NA), which aims to find a node mapping between species’ molecular networks that uncovers similar network regions, thus allowing for the transfer of functional knowledge between the aligned nodes. We provide evidence that current NA methods, which assume that topologically similar nodes (i.e., nodes whose network neighborhoods are isomorphic-like) have high functional relatedness, do not actually end up aligning functionally related nodes. That is, we show that the current topological similarity assumption does not hold well. Consequently, we argue that a paradigm shift is needed with how the NA problem is approached. So, we redefine NA as a data-driven framework, called TARA (data-driven NA), which attempts to learn the relationship between topological relatedness and functional relatedness without assuming that topological relatedness corresponds to topological similarity. TARA makes no assumptions about what nodes should be aligned, distinguishing it from existing NA methods. Specifically, TARA trains a classifier to predict whether two nodes from different networks are functionally related based on their network topological patterns (features). We find that TARA is able to make accurate predictions. TARA then takes each pair of nodes that are predicted as related to be part of an alignment. Like traditional NA methods, TARA uses this alignment for the across-species transfer of functional knowledge. TARA as currently implemented uses topological but not protein sequence information for functional knowledge transfer. In this context, we find that TARA outperforms existing state-of-the-art NA methods that also use topological information, WAVE and SANA, and even outperforms or complements a state-of-the-art NA method that uses both topological and sequence information, PrimAlign. Hence, adding sequence information to TARA, which is our future work, is likely to further improve its performance. The software and data are available at http://www.nd.edu/~cone/TARA/."
https://openalex.org/W3040393791,"Although seagrasses are economically and ecologically critical species, little is known about their blade surface microbial communities and how these communities relate to the plant host. To determine microbial community composition and diversity on seagrass blade surfaces and in the surrounding seawater,16S rRNA gene sequencing (iTag) was used for samples collected at five sites along a gradient of freshwater input in the northern Gulf of Mexico on three separate sampling dates. Additionally, seagrass surveys were performed and environmental parameters were measured to characterize host characteristics and the abiotic conditions at each site. Results showed that Thalassia testudinum (turtle grass) blades hosted unique microbial communities that were distinct in composition and diversity from the water column. Environmental conditions, including water depth, salinity, and temperature, influenced community structure as blade surface microbial communities varied among sites and sampling dates in correlation with changes in environmental parameters. Microbial community composition also correlated with seagrass host characteristics, including growth rates and blade nutrient composition. There is some evidence for a core community for T. testudinum as 21 microorganisms from five phyla (Cyanobacteria, Proteobacteria, Planctomycetes, Chloroflexi, and Bacteroidetes) were present in all blade surface samples. This study provides new insights and understanding of the processes that influence the structure of marine phyllosphere communities, how these microbial communities relate to their host, and their role as a part of the seagrass holobiont, which is an important contribution given the current decline of seagrass coverage worldwide."

Cognitive levels were evaluated by the Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE); oral conditions were reflected by the number of missing index teeth, bleeding on probing, and probing pocket depth (PD). In rats: a ligature-induced (Lig) periodontitis model and Aβ25-35-induced model of Alzheimer's disease (AD) were established; tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin 1 (IL-1), interleukin 6 (IL-6), and C-reactive protein levels in the hippocampus and cerebral cortex were detected.MMSE scores for the number of missing index teeth ≥ 7 group were significantly lower than those in the ≤ 6 group. A negative relationship (correlation coefficient ρ = -0.310, P = 0.002) was observed between MMSE scores and number of missing index teeth. More missing index teeth and lower education levels were independent risk factors for cognitive decline. A negative relationship (correlation coefficient ρ = -0.214, P = 0.031) was observed between MMSE scores and average PD. TNF-α and IL-6 levels in the hippocampus of the Lig+AD group were significantly higher than those of the AD group. IL-1 and IL-6 levels in the cerebral cortex of the Lig+AD group were significantly higher than those of the AD group.Poor oral health conditions including more missing index teeth and higher average PD may be risk factors for cognitive decline. Periodontitis may increase inflammatory cytokines in rat models of AD."
https://openalex.org/W3039335334,"Objective Decades of research have established how to measure metacognition (i.e., awareness of one’s cognitive abilities), whereas relatively little is known about how to assess the integrity of financial awareness (FA; awareness of one’s financial abilities), a related construct with practical implications for vulnerable older adults. The current study’s goal was to apply established metacognitive frameworks to identify an objective measure of FA. Methods Metacognitive ratings were integrated into two financial decision making (FDM) assessments in order to derive two types of FA metrics: absolute accuracy (calibration) and relative accuracy (resolution) in each FDM task. Associations between each FA metric, demographic variables, FDM performances, and metamemory were examined. Design & setting Cross-sectional, community-based, prospective study. Participants 93 individuals with mean age = 59 years (SD = 15.12); mean education = 15.70 (SD = 2.39); 60% females. Measures FA was calculated using the Financial Competency Assessment Inventory (FCAI) and Decision Making Competence Assessment Tool, Finance Module (DMC-F), and memory awareness was calculated using an objective metamemory test. Results None of the FA metrics was associated with age, education or gender. FCAI calibration was inversely associated with FDM, and positively correlated with DMC-F calibration and metamemory calibration. None of the FA metrics for DMC-F was associated with metamemory. Conclusions Mirroring findings from metamemory studies, overconfidence in FDM was associated with lower FDM accuracy in healthy adults. Moreover, calibration scores on the FCAI and metamemory were related, suggesting that FA taps into metacognitive abilities. Our findings provide preliminary evidence for how to measure FA in both clinical and research contexts."

Antibiotic consumption is an important parameter in the study of antibiotic use. However, no published data on consumption rates exist for these two hospitals, thus the aim of the study is to measure and compare a five year antibiotic consumption trends of the two hospitals' medical wards using Defined Daily Dose per 100 bed-days (DDD/100-BD). Antibiotics dispensed from January 2014 to December 2018 were considered. Non-parametric Pearson's correlation coefficient was used for comparison of consumption, while non-parametric Friedman's test measured annual rates. The total antibiotic consumption in the HZRH was almost double that of ONRTH. The analysis showed that antibiotic consumption in ONRTH was significantly decreased from 2014 to 2018 while there was no significant difference in consumption in HZRH. Benzyl penicillin was the most consumed antibiotic in HZRH and ONRTH throughout the study period at 87.8DDD/100-BD and 35.4 DDD/100-BD respectively. Ceftriaxone and ciprofloxacin were among the most commonly consumed antibiotics in both hospitals. Establishment of Antibiotic stewardship program would benefit both hospitals greatly, and further studies need to be done to establish the national antibiotic consumption baseline."

Proportions of persons retained and lost at each step in the HIV cascade of care under this intervention were calculated. Poisson regression with robust variance estimates were used, and clustering by facility was accounted for in all analyses.Results of the screening campaign found previously undiagnosed HIV among 13.0% of those consenting to screening, with a total estimated HIV prevalence of 17.7% (n = 3,184, 95% CI: 17.2-18.3%) in the sample. When examining the overall cascade of care, 48.3% of those with HIV initiated care, and overall 45.6% of persons who entered care qualified for ART initiated treatment. A Poisson regression accounting for clustering by facility found HIV high risk groups within the population such as women (aRR = 1.72, 95% CI: 1.57, 1.89), those over 35 years of age (aRR = 2.43, 95% CI: 1.53, 3.85), and people incarcerated less than one year (aRR = 1.41, 95% CI: 1.19, 1.67).In this setting, routine screening is recommended, and measures are needed to ensure that persons diagnosed are adequately linked to and retained in care."

To not attend an organized cervical cancer screening program increases the risk for cervical dysplasia and cervical cancer. The aim was to investigate the participation rate in three different intervention groups for non- attendees in the Swedish national program for cervical screening. The participation in the recommended follow up, and the histology found were also examined. Method Population-based randomized control trial. It included10,614 women that had not participated in the cervical cancer screening programme during the last six years (ages 30–49) and the last eight years (ages 50–64) were randomised 1:1:1(telephone call from a midwife (offering the choice between a visit for a pap smear or an HPV self-sampling test); an HPV self-sampling test only; or the routine procedure with a yearly invitation). Results In the intention to treat analysis the participation rates were 25.5% (N = 803/3146) vs 34.1% (N = 1047/3068) and 7.0% (N = 250/3538) (p<0.001) for telephone, HPV self-test and control groups respectively. In the by protocol analysis including women that answered the phone call the participation rates were 31.7% (N = 565/1784) vs 26.1% (N = 788/3002) and 7.0% (N = 250/3538) (p<0.001) for telephone, HPV self-test and control groups. The corresponding results in the by protocol analysis including women that did not answer the phone call was 19.7% (N = 565/2870) vs 26.1% (N = 788/3002) and 7.0% (N = 250/3538) (p< 0.001). The majority of the women 63,4% (1131/1784) who answered the telephone wanted to participate either by booking a visit for pap smear (38,5%) or to be sent a HPV self- sampling test (24,9%) (p<0.001). Women who chose an HPV self-test were older and gave anxiety/ fear as a reason to decline participation, and they were also less likely to participate in the follow-up if found to be HPV-positive compared to the women who chose a Pap smear. The attendance to the recommended follow-up after abnormality was in total 87%. The non-attendees had a three or eight times higher risk of having a cytology result of HSIL or suspected SCC respectively, in the index sample compared to women screened as recommended (OR 3.3 CI 95% 1.9–5.2, OR 8.6 CI 1.6–30). A total of ten SCC and one adenocarcinoma were found in the histopathology results from the non-attendee group with a study intervention, while there was only one SCC in the non-attendee group without any study intervention (p = 0.02, OR 8.1 CI 95% 1.2–350). Conclusions Our study suggests, according to intention to treat analysis, that the best intervention to get as many non-attendees as possible to participate is to send an HPV self-sampling test together with an invitation letter. Almost 90% of women in the study with an abnormal index sample attended follow-up. This is high enough to indicate that interventions to increase the participation among non-attendees are meaningful.

However, only a few studies investigated those associations in the older population.To evaluate the psychological/neuropsychological profile of older CHF patients, to explore the interrelation with clinical/functional variables and to identify potential independent predictors of patients' functional status.This study was conducted with a multi-center observational design. The following assessments were performed: anxiety (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, HADS), depression (Geriatric Depression Scale, GDS), cognitive impairment (Addenbrooke's Cognitive Examination Revised, ACE-R), executive functions (Frontal Assessment Battery, FAB), constructive abilities (Clock Drawing Test, CDT), psychomotor speed and alternated attention (Trail Making Test, TMT-A/B), functional status (6-minute walking test, 6MWT) and clinical variables (New York Heart Association, NYHA; Brain Natriuretic Peptide, BNP; left ventricular ejection fraction, LVEF; left ventricular end diastolic diameter, LVEDD; left ventricular end diastolic volume, LVEDV; tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion, TAPSE).100 CHF patients (mean age: 74.9±7.1 years; mean LVEF: 36.1±13.4) were included in the study. Anxious and depressive symptoms were observed in 16% and 24,5% of patients, respectively. Age was related to TMT-A and CDT (r = 0.49, p<0.001 and r = -0.32, p = 0.001, respectively), Log-BNP was related to ACE-R-Fluency subtest, (r = -0.22, p = 0.034), and 6MWT was related to ACE-R-Memory subtest and TMT-A (r = 0.24, p = 0.031 and r = -0.32, p = 0.005, respectively). Both anxiety and depression symptoms were related to ACE-R-Total score (r = -0.25, p = 0.013 and r = -0.32, p = 0.002, respectively) and depressive symptoms were related to CDT (r = -0.23, p = 0.024). At multiple regression analysis, Log-BNP and TMT-A were significant and independent predictors of functional status: worse findings on Log-BNP and TMT-A were associated with shorter distance walked at the 6MWT.Psychological and neuropsychological screening, along with the assessment of psychomotor speed (TMT-A), may provide useful information for older CHF patients undergoing cardiac rehabilitation."
https://openalex.org/W3040217928,"In sarcomeres, α-actinin crosslinks thin filaments and anchors them at the Z-disc. Drosophila melanogaster Zasp52 also localizes at Z-discs and interacts with α-actinin via its extended PDZ domain, thereby contributing to myofibril assembly and maintenance, yet the detailed mechanism of Zasp52 function is unknown. Here we show a strong genetic interaction between actin and Zasp52 during indirect flight muscle assembly, indicating that this interaction plays a critical role during myofibril assembly. Our results suggest that Zasp52 contains an actin-binding site, which includes the extended PDZ domain and the ZM region. Zasp52 binds with micromolar affinity to monomeric actin. A co-sedimentation assay indicates that Zasp52 can also bind to F-actin. Finally, we use in vivo rescue assays of myofibril assembly to show that the α-actinin-binding domain of Zasp52 is not sufficient for a full rescue of Zasp52 mutants suggesting additional contributions of Zasp52 actin-binding to myofibril assembly."
https://openalex.org/W3040505939,"There is increasing emphasis on psychological and social approaches to managing and treating mental illness, including a growing evidence base on the effectiveness of community-based social interventions including arts and heritage activities, library programmes, volunteering schemes, nature-based activities and community groups. However, there is a gap in understanding of what the barriers to, and enablers of, working with individuals with mental illness might be for the community and voluntary sector. A qualitative approach was used involving focus groups with non-profit organisations delivering social activities within communities across the United Kingdom. Behaviour Change Theory, the COM-B model and the Theoretical Domains Framework, were employed as the theoretical framework, to develop interventions to address the barriers raised. Representatives of the organisations reported being motivated by the mental health needs of others, and by seeing the benefits of participation. Further motivations included expanding inclusion, and economic motivation to ensure sustainability. Strengths identified included offering innovative, responsive services that were distinct from conventional mental health services. Running these services demanded new and potentially challenging skills, such as understanding statutory responsibilities, and being able to train and support staff. Further challenges included maintaining boundaries between their roles as community organisations and clients' mental health needs and avoiding burn-out. Ability to deliver this work was enhanced by support of peer organisations and opportunities to share practice. However, funding was often short term, and complex to obtain, which could destabilise organisations' sustainability. Lack of transparency around the process, differences in language between the community and health sectors, and confusion around commissioning pathways undermined the potential opportunity offered by social prescribing policy. Interventions to address these barriers were identified, including long term funding to support core costs, training on engaging with the commissioning process, around mental health support and safeguarding, and developing mentoring schemes and local co-operatives of organisations for developing partnerships with the health sector."
https://openalex.org/W3040007575,"Cystic echinococcosis is a chronic, complex and neglected zoonotic disease with considerable socio-economic impact on the affected population. Even though Mongolia is included in the list of high cystic echinococcosis risk countries, there has been very limited research and evidence on the prevalence or prevention of cystic echinococcosis. This field-based cross-sectional study to investigate the prevalence of cystic echinococcosis and its potential risk factors in Mongolia was conducted from April 2016 to March 2018. A total of 1,993 people were examined by ultrasound in five provinces of Mongolia. All cystic echinococcosis positive cases were classified according to the WHO-IWGE expert recommendations. The logistic regression model was used to detect the association between the presence of echinococcus infection and each potential risk factor. This was the first community survey based on ultrasound screening in Mongolia. We found 98 cystic echinococcosis cases (prevalence = 4.9%), including 85 abdominal ultrasound cystic echinococcosis positive cases and 13 abdominal ultrasound cystic echinococcosis negative cases (surgically treated cystic echinococcosis cases 11, and 2 confirmed cases of lung cystic echinococcosis by chestcomputed tomography in hospital of Ulaanbaatar). The prevalence of cystic echinococcosis varied greatly among different provinces, ranging from 2.0% to 13.1%. Children, elderly people and those with lower education had higher chances of getting cystic echinococcosis. Rather than dog ownership itself, daily practice for cleaning dog feces was associated with increased odds of cystic echinococcosis. The results of the present study show very high endemicity of cystic echinococcosis in Umnugovi province. Evaluation of potential risk factors associated with cystic echinococcosisshow high significance for following factors: demographics (age), social condition (education level) and hygiene practices (cleaning dog feces and use of gloves). Children under 18 and elderly people are considered as the most risk age groups in Mongolia."
https://openalex.org/W3038327736,"Relational mobility is a socio-ecological construct quantifying how much freedom and opportunity a society affords individuals to choose and dispose of interpersonal relationships. Past research has confirmed that relational mobility varies across nations, but no large-scale study has examined the degree to which relational mobility may vary within a single nation. We report two studies (Study 1, N = 647; Study 2, N = 7343) exploring within-country similarity or variability in relational mobility across all 27 states and five geo-socio-political regions in the continent-size country of Brazil. Results confirmed the measurement equivalence of the Relational Mobility Scale across respondents from all Brazilian states. Notably, relational mobility scores were uniform across Brazilian regions and states, indicating a common national culture regarding the amount of opportunities Brazilians have in selecting new relationship partners within their social context. Replicating existing findings, relational mobility was positively associated with pro-active tendencies that help people retain relationships—levels of intimacy and self-disclosure toward a close friend—indicating that friends tend to feel closer intimacy to their close friends, and reveal serious personal information to a larger degree in social contexts where opportunities to find and retain relationships with like-minded others are greater."
https://openalex.org/W3040365149,"In general, beef cattle long-distance transportation from cow-calf operations to feedlots or from feedlots to abattoirs is a common situation in the beef industry. The aim of this study was to determine the effect of rumen-protected methionine (RPM) supplementation on a proposed gene network for muscle fatigue, creatine synthesis (CKM), and reactive oxygen species (ROS) metabolism after a transportation simulation in a test track. Angus × Simmental heifers (n = 18) were stratified by body weight (408 ± 64 kg; BW) and randomly assigned to dietary treatments: 1) control diet (CTRL) or 2) control diet + 8 gr/hd/day of top-dressed rumen-protected methionine (RPM). After an adaptation period to Calan gates, animals received the mentioned dietary treatment consisting of Bermuda hay ad libitum and a soy hulls and corn gluten feed based supplement. After 45 days of supplementation, animals were loaded onto a trailer and transported for 22 hours (long-term transportation). Longissimus muscle biopsies, BW and blood samples were obtained on day 0 (Baseline), 43 (Pre-transport; PRET), and 46 (Post-transport; POST). Heifers’ average daily gain did not differ between baseline and PRET. Control heifer’s shrink was 10% of BW while RPM heifers shrink was 8%. Serum cortisol decreased, and glucose and creatine kinase levels increased after transportation, but no differences were observed between treatments. Messenger RNA was extracted from skeletal muscle tissue and gene expression analysis was performed by RT-qPCR. Results showed that AHCY and DNMT3A (DNA methylation), SSPN (Sarcoglycan complex), and SOD2 (Oxidative Stress-ROS) were upregulated in CTRL between baseline and PRET and, decreased between pre and POST while they remained constant for RPM. Furthermore, CKM was not affected by treatments. In conclusion, RPM supplementation may affect ROS production and enhance DNA hypermethylation, after a long-term transportation."
https://openalex.org/W3038133858,"Tuberculosis (TB) is the leading cause of death among people living with HIV (PLWH), and current evidence suggests that heavy alcohol users have an increased risk of developing TB disease compared to non-drinkers. Not known is whether the increased risk for TB disease among alcohol users may reflect higher rates of latent TB infection (LTBI) among this population. We assessed the latent TB infection prevalence based on tuberculin skin testing (TST) and examined association with current alcohol use among HIV-infected persons on antiretroviral therapy (ART) in south-western Uganda.We included PLWH at the Mbarara Regional Hospital HIV clinic, who were either current alcohol consumers (prior 3 months) or past year abstainers (2:1 enrolment ratio). Participants were recruited for a study of isoniazid preventive therapy for LTBI. TST was performed using 5 tuberculin units of purified protein derivative. The primary outcome was a positive TST reading (≥5mm induration), reflecting LTBI. We used logistic regression analyses to assess the cross-sectional association between self-reported current alcohol use and a positive TST.Of the 295 of 312 (95%) who returned for TST reading, 63% were females and 63% were current alcohol drinkers. The TST positive prevalence was 27.5% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 22.6% - 32.9%). The odds of a positive TST for current alcohol users compared to abstainers was 0.76 (95% CI: 0.41, 1.41), controlling for gender, age, body mass index, history of smoking, and prior unhealthy alcohol use.The prevalence of LTBI among PLWH on ART in south-western Uganda was moderate and LTBI poses a risk for future infectious TB. Although alcohol use is common, we did not detect an association between current drinking or prior unhealthy alcohol use and LTBI. Further studies to evaluate the association between LTBI and different levels of current drinking (heavy versus not) are needed."
https://openalex.org/W3038227672,"Background Urine-based diagnostics indicated involvement of oncoprotein 18 (OP18) in bladder cancer. In cell culture models we investigated the role of OP18 for malignant cell growth. Methods We analyzed 113 urine samples and investigated two human BCa cell lines as a dual model: RT-4 and ECV-304, which represented differentiated (G1) and poorly differentiated (G3) BCa. We designed specific siRNA for down-regulation of OP18 in both cell lines. Phenotypes were characterized by cell viability, proliferation, and expression of apoptosis-related genes. Besides, sensitivity to cisplatin treatment was evaluated. Results Analysis of urine samples from patients with urothelial BCa revealed a significant correlation of the RNA-ratio OP18:uroplakin 1A with bladder cancer. High urinary ratios were mainly found in moderately to poorly differentiated tumors (grade G2-3) that were muscle invasive (stage T2-3), whereas samples from patients with more differentiated non-invasive BCa (G1) showed low OP18:UPK1A RNA ratios. Down-regulation of OP18 expression in ECV-304 shifted its phenotype towards G1 state. Further, OP18-directed siRNA induced apoptosis and increased chemo-sensitivity to cisplatin. Conclusions This study provides conclusive experimental evidence for the link between OP18-derived RNA as a diagnostic marker for molecular staging of BCa in non-invasive urine-based diagnostics and the patho-mechanistic role of OP18 suggesting this gene as a therapeutic target."
https://openalex.org/W3038527206,"Hemorrhagic shock is one of the leading causes of mortality and morbidity in pediatric trauma. Current treatment based on volume resuscitation is associated to adverse effects, and it has been proposed that vasopressors may be used in the pharmacological management of trauma. Terlipressin has demonstrated its usefulness in other pediatric critical care scenarios and its long half-life allows its use as a bolus in an outpatient critical settings. The aim of this study was to analyze whether the addition of a dose of terlipressin to the initial volume expansion produces an improvement in hemodynamic and cerebral perfusion at early stages of hemorrhagic shock in an infant animal model. We conducted an experimental randomized animal study with 1-month old pigs. After 30 minutes of hypotension (mean arterial blood pressure [MAP]<45 mmHg) induced by the withdrawal of blood over 30 min, animals were randomized to receive either normal saline (NS) 30 mL/kg (n = 8) or a bolus of 20 mcg/kg of terlipressin plus 30 mL/kg of normal saline (TP) (n = 8). Global hemodynamic and cerebral monitoring parameters, brain damage markers and histology samples were compared. After controlled bleeding, significant decreases were observed in MAP, cardiac index (CI), central venous pressure, global end-diastolic volume index (GEDI), left cardiac output index, SvO2, intracranial pressure, carotid blood flow, bispectral index (BIS), cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP) and increases in systemic vascular resistance index, heart rate and lactate. After treatment, MAP, GEDI, CI, CPP and BIS remained significantly higher in the TP group. The addition of a dose of terlipressin to initial fluid resuscitation was associated with hemodynamic improvement, intracranial pressure maintenance and better cerebral perfusion, which would mean protection from ischemic injury. Brain monitoring through BIS was able to detect changes caused by hemorrhagic shock and treatment."

Here, we sought to evaluate the gap between predicted damage in a foreseeable major earthquake versus existing municipality-level resources in Tokyo, Japan. Methods Our study focused on the 53 municipalities in Tokyo to evaluate the relationships between the predicted number of severe casualties per 1,000 population from a future earthquake, community characteristics, and inpatient bed supply in local hospitals. Correlation analysis and supply–demand balance estimations were carried out at the municipality level, and the results were geographically visualized using choropleth maps. Results The correlation analysis showed that higher casualties were correlated with municipalities with faster population increase, higher taxable incomes, lower unemployment rates, and higher bed volumes in disaster base hospitals. Under a maximal damage scenario in a future earthquake, we predict a shortage of 2,780 beds for the treatment of severe casualties across Tokyo. Even under a scenario of cooperation among neighboring municipalities, a shortage of 7,107 beds would remain. Conclusions Tokyo is located in a zone where major earthquake damage is anticipated. Cooperation between neighboring municipalities may not suffice to address the undersupply of beds during the acute phase of a disaster. Hence, existing disaster preparedness plans require further reinforcement with a focus on local vulnerabilities."

Focusing on a specific health policy in an aid-independent country, this qualitative study explores the role of external actors in shaping Thailand’s migrant health insurance. Primary data were collected through in-depth interviews with eighteen key informants from September 2018 to January 2019. The data were analysed using thematic analysis, focusing on three channels of influence, financial resources, technical expertise and inter-sectoral leverage, and their effect on the different stages of the policy process. Given Thailand’s export orientation and the importance of reputational effects, inter-sectoral leverage, mainly through the US TIP Reports and the EU carding decision, emerged as a very powerful channel of influence on priority setting, as it indirectly affected the migrant health insurance through efforts aimed at dealing with problems of human trafficking in the context of labour migration, especially after the 2014 coup d'état. This study helps understand the changed role external actors can play in filling health system gaps in aid-independent countries."
https://openalex.org/W3040099026,"Good Agricultural Practices (GAPs) training programs were developed to provide guidance to fruit and vegetable growers on how to reduce food safety risks on the farm. These programs have been enhanced over the years due, in part, to increasing buyer and regulatory requirements. However, the costs of implementing additional food safety practices has been identified as a primary barrier to long-term farm financial feasibility, particularly for smaller scale producers. A survey of past participants in New York State revealed that increasing food safety improvements facilitated by GAPs have not significantly impacted the size of farm operations or the types of crops grown. In terms of farm size, we show that both the financial costs and financial benefits of food safety improvements increase with farm size, but at decreasing rates. In so doing, relatively higher market sales gains per acre by smaller farms from additional food safety investments offset the relatively higher costs to them of their implementation. We also demonstrate that benefits of food safety improvements were significantly higher for farms that had third-party food safety audits and for those that market primarily through wholesale channels. The results should prove welcome by educators as they encourage participation by all scales of producers in GAPs trainings and for growers in understanding that food safety investments can support both reduced microbial risks and sales growth."
https://openalex.org/W3040462246,"Powdery mildew is an important foliar disease of barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) caused by the biotrophic fungus Blumeria graminis f. sp. hordei (Bgh). The understanding of the resistance mechanism is essential for future resistance breeding. In particular, the identification of race-nonspecific resistance genes is important because of their regarded durability and broad-spectrum activity. We assessed the severity of powdery mildew infection on detached seedling leaves of 267 barley accessions using two poly-virulent isolates and performed a genome-wide association study exploiting 201 of these accessions. Two-hundred and fourteen markers, located on six barley chromosomes are associated with potential race-nonspecific Bgh resistance or susceptibility. Initial steps for the functional validation of four promising candidates were performed based on phenotype and transcription data. Specific candidate alleles were analyzed via transient gene silencing as well as transient overexpression. Microarray data of the four selected candidates indicate differential regulation of the transcription in response to Bgh infection. Based on our results, all four candidate genes seem to be involved in the responses to powdery mildew attack. In particular, the transient overexpression of specific alleles of two candidate genes, a potential arabinogalactan protein and the barley homolog of Arabidopsis thaliana’s Light-Response Bric-a-Brac/-Tramtrack/-Broad Complex/-POxvirus and Zinc finger (AtLRB1) or AtLRB2, were top candidates of novel powdery mildew susceptibility genes."

Yet to date, it is not clear what specific abilities are needed to adequately accomplish this task, thereby hindering both its assessment and the development and evaluation of related interventions. By systematically building on past research, this study aimed to operationally define the concept of health information appraisal competence.We systematically searched five scholarly databases to identify the conceptualizations and operational definitions of information appraisal in different disciplines. The resulting operationalization was subsequently validated through an online consultation exercise among 85 Swiss stakeholders.Ninety-four publications were included in the review to the point of saturation. We extracted 646 skills, attitudes, and knowledge for health information appraisal. We then collated overlapping or duplicate statements, which produced a list of 43 unique statements belonging to six emergent themes or core competences: (1) basic competence, (2) predisposition, (3) identification competence, (4) critical evaluation competence, (5) selection competence, and (6) application competence. The consultation exercise enriched the operationalization of some of the core competences and confirmed the importance of all competences. Most skills, attitudes, and knowledge, however, were assigned low feasibility by the stakeholders.This study was the first attempt to systematically operationalize health information appraisal competence. From a theoretical perspective, it sheds light on an understudied, health literacy domain, thus contributing to clarity around the concept. From a practical perspective, it provides a strong theoretical basis for the development of a tool to measure health information appraisal competence. This could be used routinely as a screening tool, as an outcome measure for public health interventions, or to identify citizens who are most at risk. Furthermore, it will provide support for the development of future interventions to build health information appraisal competence in the population."
https://openalex.org/W3039172224,"Commercial storage of potatoes often relies on the use of sprout inhibitors to prolong storage and reduce spoilage. The compound 1,4-dimethylnaphthalene (DMN) has seen increase application as a sprout inhibitor in the potato industry as older chemistries are being phased out. The mode of action of DMN is poorly understood as is the sensitivity of potato tissues to this new class of inhibitor. During storage potato tubers transition from a state of endo-dormant to eco-dormant and it is not known if the DMN response is consistent across this developmental transition. RNA-seq gene expression profiling was used to establish if stored potato tubers (Solanum tuberosum cv La Chipper) have differential sensitivity to DMN as tubers age. DMN was applied at three different times during storage; just after harvest when tubers are in endo-dormancy, midwinter at early eco-dormancy, and in spring during late eco-dormancy when sprouting was prevented via exposure to cold storage temperatures. Changes in gene expression were lowest during endo-dormancy while midwinter and spring treatments exhibited a greater and more diverse expression response. Functional analysis of differential gene expression demonstrated gene sets associated with DNA replication, cell division, and DNA methylation are suppressed after DMN treatment. However, gene sets associated with salicylic acid, jasmonic acid, abiotic and biotic stress responses are elevated by DMN only after endodormancy terminates. Gene clusters associated with pathogenesis related proteins PR-4 and PR-5 are also upregulated in response to DMN. These results indicate that DMN sensitivity changes as potato tubers age and transition from endo-dormant to eco-dormant in storage and the overall response is a shift in gene classes that regulate growth and response to stress."
https://openalex.org/W3040629946,"Background Normothermic ex vivo liver perfusion (NEVLP) is a promising strategy to increase the donor pool in liver transplantation. Small animal models are essential to further investigate questions regarding organ preservation and reconditioning by NEVLP. A dual vessel small animal NEVLP (dNEVLP) model was developed using metamizole as a vasodilator and compared to conventional portovenous single vessel NEVLP (sNEVLP). Methods Livers of male Wistar rats were perfused with erythrocyte-supplemented culture medium for six hours by either dNEVLP via hepatic artery and portal vein or portovenous sNEVLP. dNEVLP was performed either with or without metamizole treatment. Perfusion pressure and flow rates were constantly monitored. Transaminase levels were determined in the perfusate at the start and after three and six hours of perfusion. Bile secretion was monitored and bile LDH and GGT levels were measured hourly. Histopathological analysis was performed using liver and bile duct tissue samples after perfusion. Results Hepatic artery pressure was significantly lower in dNEVLP with metamizole administration. Compared to sNEVLP, dNEVLP with metamizole treatment showed higher bile production, lower levels of transaminases during and after perfusion as well as significantly lower necrosis in liver and bile duct tissue. Biochemical markers of bile duct injury showed the same trend. Conclusion Our miniaturized dNEVLP system enables normothermic dual vessel rat liver perfusion. The administration of metamizole effectively ameliorates arterial vasospasm allowing for six hours of dNEVLP, with superior outcome compared to sNEVLP."
https://openalex.org/W3038240671,"Responses to affect include cognitive processes (i.e., perseverative vs. non-perseverative) and valence (i.e., modulation of positive vs. negative affect). However, little research has examined how the factor structure of responses to affect is defined along one or both of these dimensions. The present study conducted an exploratory factor analysis (EFA) of items from assessments of repetitive negative thinking, rumination on positive affect (PA), and dampening. We also examined the associations between emergent factors and measures of depressive symptoms, social anxiety symptoms, and non-social state anxiety. EFA results suggested a three-factor model of repetitive negative thinking, dampening, and rumination on PA. There was a significant association between repetitive negative thinking and dampening factors, but not between other factors. Repetitive negative thinking and dampening were associated with greater internalizing symptoms, whereas rumination on PA was associated with fewer internalizing symptoms. These findings clarify the structure of these responses to affect and their differential associations with symptoms, which may be used to tailor cognitive interventions for anxiety and/or depression."

Numerous research contributions to spatiotemporal modeling approaches exhibit their strengths differently with increasing complexity. However, contributions that combine spatiotemporal approaches to modeling of multiple diseases simultaneously are not so common. We present a full Bayesian hierarchical spatio-temporal approach to the joint modeling of Human Immunodeficiency Virus and Tuberculosis incidences in Kenya. Using case notification data for the period 2012–2017, we estimated the model parameters and determined the joint spatial patterns and temporal variations. Our model included specific and shared spatial and temporal effects. The specific random effects allowed for departures from the shared patterns for the different diseases. The space-time interaction term characterized the underlying spatial patterns with every temporal fluctuation. We assumed the shared random effects to be the structured effects and the disease-specific random effects to be unstructured effects. We detected the spatial similarity in the distribution of Tuberculosis and Human Immunodeficiency Virus in approximately 29 counties around the western, central and southern regions of Kenya. The distribution of the shared relative risks had minimal difference with the Human Immunodeficiency Virus disease-specific relative risk whereas that of Tuberculosis presented many more counties as high-risk areas. The flexibility and informative outputs of Bayesian Hierarchical Models enabled us to identify the similarities and differences in the distribution of the relative risks associated with each disease. Estimating the Human Immunodeficiency Virus and Tuberculosis shared relative risks provide additional insights towards collaborative monitoring of the diseases and control efforts."

However, this scheme is not the Pareto optimal and loses association with weights. For these reasons, this paper proposes to apply the social choice theory and Stochastic Multicriteria Acceptability Analysis for group decision making (SMAA-2) to measure the value of health systems, by means of re-constructing the Value Measure. Specifically, we begin with considering all possible individual preferences among Access, Satisfaction and Efficiency, which is mathematically represented by ranked weights of them; the pessimistic and optimistic outcomes under certain individual preference are derived in a closed-form manner, according to which an interval decision matrix is then formulated; the SMAA-2 is then lastly applied to compute the holistic acceptability index, which is considered as a revised Value Measure. An empirical study using the data of 16 health systems is conducted to show the effectiveness and superiority of our method. It is demonstrated that our method always outperforms the Value Measure, by means of comparing the Spearman's rank correlation coefficients."
https://openalex.org/W3040285959,"To determine the magnitude and factors associated with psychotropic drug-induced parkinsonism and akathisia among mentally ill patients.A hospital-based cross-sectional study was conducted with a total of 410 participants attending a follow-up treatment service at Jimma Medical Center, a psychiatry clinic from April to June 2019. Participants were recruited using a systematic random sampling method. Drug-induced parkinsonism and akathisia were assessed using the Extra-pyramidal Symptom Rating Scale. Substance use was assessed using the World Health Organization Alcohol, Smoking, and Substance Involvement Screening Test. Data entry was done using EpiData version 3.1, and analysis done by the Statistical Package for Social Sciences version 22. Statistically, the significant association was declared by adjusted odds ratio, 95% confidence interval, and p-value less than or equal to 0.05.The mean age of the respondents was 33.3 years (SD ± 8.55). Most of the participants 223 (54.4%) had a diagnosis of schizophrenia. The prevalence of drug-induced parkinsonism was 14.4% (95% CI: 11.0 to 18.0) and it was 12.4% (95% CI: 9.3 to 15.4) for drug-induced akathisia. The result of the final model found out drug-induced parkinsonism was significantly associated with female sex, age, type of antipsychotics, physical illness, and anti-cholinergic medication use. Similarly, female sex, chlorpromazine equivalent doses of 200 to 600 mg, combined treatment of sodium valproate with antipsychotic, and severe khat/Catha edulis use risk level was significantly associated with akathisia.One of seven patients developed drug-induced parkinsonism and akathisia. Careful patient assessment for drug-induced movement disorders, selection of drugs with minimal side effects, screening patients for physical illness, and psycho-education on substance use should be given top priority."
https://openalex.org/W3040446467,"In times of water shortage, it becomes increasingly relevant for policymakers to understand the existing relationships between different types of water use, so as to encourage efficient water management. This article makes use of yearly data on agricultural, industrial, and household water use in the Balkan countries of Bulgaria, Romania, and Serbia. It does so to identify the potential interactions among these three categories of water use. Using a deterministic model based on differential equations, we provide an analysis of the interactions among these different sectors of water use for the period between 2008 and 2017. Results show that interactions among these different categories do not remain constant over periods of time, either across or within the countries analysed. We find that, for most countries, industrial and household water uses are more likely to be characterised by mutualism and competition, instead of a predator-prey relationship. Agricultural water use, on the other hand, takes on the role of predator against the other two."
https://openalex.org/W3040501972,"Background This study aimed to evaluate the feasibility of a new biplanar low-dose X-ray device for facial skeletal imaging. Methods We evaluated 48 biplanar radiographs from 12 patients (posteroanterior/lateral), originally taken for a scoliosis examination with a biplanar low-dose X-ray device. For this study, the images were further evaluated for the perceptibility of 38 facial skeleton landmarks. To determine the reliability and reproducibility of perceptibility, two independent observers determined the landmarks twice, during a time interval of at least two weeks. Results Both interoperator and intraoperator reliability were excellent for all landmarks [intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) > 0.92]. Conclusions The biplanar low-dose X-ray device demonstrated good feasibility for precisely assessing the anatomical landmarks of the facial skeleton. Given its excellent precision, the biplanar low-dose X-ray device data sets should be forwarded from the treating orthopedic surgeon or neurosurgeon to the orthodontist or dentist for further assessment in their field."
https://openalex.org/W3038451229,"Objective The use of epidural analgesia after major surgery is a well-established analgesia method. Epidural analgesia for postoperative pain relief needs to be monitored regularly in order to evaluate patient satisfaction and avoid side effects. However, due to the new available regional techniques, the role of epidural analgesia is being questioned and data about patient satisfaction is lacking. The current study was designed to evaluate patient satisfaction with epidural analgesia, its efficacy and reasons for premature termination of epidural analgesia. Materials and methods We conducted a retrospective survey of all patients who undergone surgery at Uppsala University hospital between October 2012 and January 2014 requiring continuous epidural analgesia for postoperative pain relief. Patients’ satisfaction with epidural analgesia and its effectiveness were evaluated by using paper questionnaire. Results During the study period 579 epidurals were inserted in patients scheduled for vascular, hepatobiliary, esophageal and other major abdominal surgery. The average treatment time was 3.8±1.8 days. Epidural analgesia consisted either of bupivacaine 0.1%+sufentanil 1 μg/ml solution or ropivacaine 0.2% solution. If patient needed opiates during treatment with epidural analgesia, only ropivacaine 0,2% solution was used. 494 (87.9%) patients were satisfied with their analgesia with no difference in satisfaction between sexes being observed. In 62 cases (11.2%) patient controlled analgesia was used on top of epidural analgesia with ropivacaine 0.2% solution, and 50.8% of patients were satisfied in this group. 514 (91.4%) patients were reported as having a good effect, 24 (4.3%) patients reported or were tested to show some effect, and 24 (4.3%) had no effect. No major neurological complications (epidural hematoma or abscess) were observed. Conclusions Our retrospective survey indicates that patients are satisfied with continuous epidural analgesia used in major surgery."
https://openalex.org/W3038464765,"Understanding complex mechanisms of human transcriptional regulation remains a major challenge. Classical reporter studies already enabled the discovery of cis-regulatory elements within the non-coding DNA; however, the influence of genomic context and potential interactions are still largely unknown. Using a modified Cas9 activation complex we explore the complexity of renin transcription in its native genomic context.With the help of genomic editing, we stably tagged the native renin on chromosome 1 with the firefly luciferase and stably integrated a programmable modified Cas9 based trans-activation complex (SAM-complex) by lentiviral transduction into human cells. By delivering five specific guide-RNA homologous to specific promoter regions of renin we were able to guide this SAM-complex to these regions of interest. We measured gene expression and generated and compared computational models.SAM complexes induced activation of renin in our cells after renin specific guide-RNA had been provided. All possible combinations of the five guides were subjected to model analysis in linear models. Quantifying the prediction error and the calculation of an estimator of the relative quality of the statistical models for our given set of data revealed that a model incorporating interactions in the proximal promoter is the superior model for explanation of the data.By applying our combined experimental and modelling approach we can show that interactions occur within the selected sequences of the proximal renin promoter region. This combined approach might potentially be useful to investigate other genomic regions. Our findings may help to better understand the transcriptional regulation of human renin."
https://openalex.org/W3039959269,"Recent researches revealed that the EEG component caused by the flickering visual stimulus, which is called steady-state visually evoked potential (SSVEP), might be a potential index for object recognition. This study examined whether SSVEP reflects different states during object recognition. In one trial, a binary image (BI), which is difficult to recognize, was followed by a grayscale image (GI) of the same object as the answer. Both BI and GI were presented in a flickering manner at a frequency of 7.5 Hz. Participants were first asked to answer whether they could recognize BI. Then, after GI was shown, participants were requested to answer whether they recognized it. We analyzed the evoked and induced component of SSVEPs from the two recognition conditions. As a result, the SSVEPs to BI were significantly larger than that to GI. In addition, induced component to GI after the BI was unrecognized was smaller than after the BI was recognized. The present data provide evidence that SSVEPs reflect a transition of cognitive state to ambiguous figures is reflected."
