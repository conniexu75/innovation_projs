https://openalex.org/W2054089548,The perceived shade of gray depends primarily on the luminance relationship between surfaces percieved to lie in the same plane and not between surfaces that are merely adjacent in the retinal image. This result implies that depth perception must precede lightness perception and that lateral inhibition cannot explain lightness constancy.
https://openalex.org/W2090627913,The permeability of the cell-to-cell membrane channels in salivary gland cell junction (Chironomus thummi) was probed with fluorescent-labeled amino acids and synthetic or natural peptides. Molecules up to 1200 daltons pass through the channels with velocities depending on molecular size. Molecules of 1900 daltons or greater do not pass. This passage failure seems to reflect the normal size limit for junctional channel permeation; the channels continue to be permeated by the molecules up to 1200 daltons when these are mixed with the nonpermeant molecules. From this size limit a channel diameter of 10 to 14 angstroms is estimated.
https://openalex.org/W2048932273,Lines of chickens selected from a common ancestral population for either resistance or susceptibility to Marek's disease developed contrasting frequencies of particular B alloalleles. Comparison of inoculated sibs in backcross-families revealed that the B alloalleles characterizing the two lines accounted for an eightfold difference in tumor incidence. This genetic difference in tumorigenesis associated with the alloalleles of the major histocompatibility complex is probably expressed through the cell-mediated immune system.

https://openalex.org/W2087363568,"Developmental dyslexia may be associated with (i) bi-hemisphere representation of spatial functions, in contrast to the right-hemisphere specialization observed in normal children, and (ii) typical left-hemisphere representation of linguistic functions, as is observed in normal children. The bilateral neural involvement in spatial processing may interfere with the left hemisphere's processing of its own specialized functions and result in deficient linguistic, sequential cognitive processing and in overuse of the spatial, holistic cognitive mode. This pattern of cognitive deficits and biases may lead dyslexics to read predominantly with a spatial-holistic cognitive strategy and neglect the phonetic-sequential strategy. Such an approach in learning to read phonetically coded languages, such as English, may be inefficient and limited."
https://openalex.org/W2031632138,"Exogenous prostaglandin (PGE2) contracts bovine and human coronary arteries but its precursor, arachidonic acid, relaxes them. The endoperoxides PGH2 and PGH3 relax bovine coronary strips, but PGH1 produces contraction. The primary prostaglandins exert opposite effects to their own endoperoxide precursors, thus, PGE2 and PGE3 contract, and PGE1 relaxes the bovine coronary arteries. The paradoxical coronary dilation produced by the arachidonate or the PGH2 suggest that little if any coronary isomerase which converts endoperoxide into PGE2 exists, or that a novel, potent, PG-like substance is produced by the isolated coronary arteries. Although the coronaries do not possess thromboxane A2 synthetase activity, the vessels are profoundly contracted by exogenous thromboxane A2. Thromboxane A2 can be synthesized and released by circulating platelets when they are aggregated by endothelial injury or thrombin. Thus, coronary tone, and possible spasm, in ischemic myocardial zones may be influenced markedly by interplay between prostaglandins, endoperoxides, and thromboxane formed by platelets on the one hand, and endoperoxide products synthesized endogenously in the coronary arteries on the other."

https://openalex.org/W1535863494,"Hepatocytes isolated from adult rat liver by enzymatic dispersion were used to investigate amino acid transport. Steady state and influx experiments were carried out with alpha-amino[1-14C]isobutyric acid and [1-14C]cycloleucine in the presence and absence of sodium under various experimental conditions. Hepatocytes concentrated alpha-aminoisobutyric acid to a 3-fold higher degree than cycloleucine. At low external alpha-aminoisobutyric acid levels (2 to 5 mM), about 25% and 75% of entry were accounted for by nonsaturable and saturable processes, respectively. The nonsaturable component was sodium-independent, and had the properties of passive diffusion. The saturable transport was dependent on external sodium; the rate of transport reached its maximal value with sodium greater than or equal to 75 mM. Sodium increased the apparent Vmax of transport without changing the apparent Km. This component was largely dependent on energy supplies and was strongly reduced at pH less than or equal to 6.5. The value for activation energy (Ea approximately equal to 15 kcal/mol, calculated from the Arrhenius plot) favors a mediated active transport. The Na+-dependent influx of alpha-aminoisobutyric acid was competitively inhibited by N-methyl-alpha-aminoisobutyric acid (Ki approximately equal to 9.3 mM) and alanine (Ki approximately equal to 2 mM) to the extent of 70% and 100%, respectively. The N-methyl-alpha-aminoisobutyric acid-sensitive part of alpha-aminoisobutyric acid influx represents transport through the system, whereas the N-methyl-alpha-aminoisobutyric acid-insensitive part of transport is believed to occur through the system. No evidence was obtained to suggest that alpha-aminoisobutyric acid is transported by the system. Cycloleucine transport was a composite phenomenon involving at least two saturable processes, one of which was sodium-dependent and inhibited by alpha-aminoisobutyric acid, and probably represents entry through the A and ASC systems. The sodium-independent component was completely and competitively inhibited by 2-aminobicyclo(2,2,1)heptane-2-carboxylic acid (Ki approximately equal to 2 mM). This component exhibited accelerative exchange-diffusion and was pH-insensitive, properties which suggest a facilitated diffusion process. However, the weak inhibition exerted by oligomycin and cyanide along with the concentrative effect observed indicated that uphill transport was also operative. These data are in good agreement with those reported for the L system. We conclude that, as in Ehrlich ascites tumor cells and in embryonic heart cells, the A, ASC, and L systems are operative in isolated hepatocytes for the transport of amino acids."

https://openalex.org/W2050966826,"We report the isolation and some properties of the mitochondrial ribosomal RNA (mt-rRNA) of Drosophila melanogaster, and a restriction map of the mtDNA of this organism which shows the position of the rRNA genes and of the A + T-rich region in the DNA. The mt-rRNAs are about 860 and 1500 nucleotides long and have the unusual composition of about 20% G+C. Some 25% of the mtDNA is very rich in A+T and is visualized as a contiguous early melting region in denaturation mapping. We mapped the three cleavage sites of the restriction endonuclease Hae III and the four sites of Hind III on mtDNA relative to each other and relative to the early melting region. The rRNA genes have been positioned on this map. The two rRNA genes are next to each other, separated by a gap of about 160 bases. We determined the polarity of the rRNA molecules: transcription proceeds in the direction small-to-large rRNA. Despite great divergence in nucleotide composition and sequence, the properties of mt-rRNA and the arrangement of mt-rRNA genes are very similar in Drosophila and vertebrate animals."

Both in the nature of its modified nucleotides and in its sequence (although the sequence of all known tRNAPhes is quite similar), chloroplastic tRNAPhe more closely resembles procaryotic tRNAPhes than it resembles those from the cytoplasm of eucaryotes. There are eight positions in the tRNAPhe molecule where nucleotides are invariant in procaryotes but differ from invariant nucleotides in eucaryotes; at five of these positions, chloroplastic tRNAPhe is similar to procaryotes. The possible evolutionary significance of this intermediate type of structure is discussed."

https://openalex.org/W1486626517,"When contact-inhibited human diploid fibroblasts that have been maintained on medium containing 0.5% serum are stimulated by 10% serum they leave the G0 state and enter the cell cycle at G1. The onset of DNA synthesis occurs at 12 to 13 h. DNA was isolated from cultures that had been stimulated for 0, 2, 4, 6, 12, 16, 20, 24, and 30 h. These DNA preparations were characterized by sensitivity to a single strand specific nuclease, CsSO4/AgClO4 buoyant density, sedimentation in neutral and alkaline sucrose gradients, and sedimentation in neutral sucrose gradients after digestion with S1-nuclease. The DNA from 4-h stimulated cultures has an increased amount of single strandedness as indicated by sensitivity to S1-nuclease and buoyant density. The amount of single strandedness increases as the cells enter S-phase and decreases as they enter the G2 period. The DNA isolated from G0 cells behaves as native, duplex DNA with virtually no breaks. The DNA from 2-h and 4-h stimulated cultures contained a significant number of breaks. The number of breaks increases to a maximum in S-phase and declines as the cells enter the G2 period. There are no nuclease-sensitive sites (gaps) in G0 or 2-h cultures. The number of sites increases 4 h after stimulation, reaches a maximum during S-phase, and decreases as the cells enter G2. These results lead us to suggest a chromosomal cycle at the level of DNA itself, whereby structural changes are occurring throughout the entire G1 period, aimed toward the initiation of DNA synthesis. These changes reach a maximum degree during replication and decline as replication is terminated."

The human histone messenger RNA (mRNA) species associated with various polyadenylated [poly(A(+))] and nonpolyadenylated [poly(A(-))] components of 4 to 18 S RNA were determined by translation of these RNA fractions in vitro using a Krebs II ascites cell-free system followed by resolution of histones synthesized in vitro on polyacrylamide gels containing Triton X-100. The results of these studies indicate that poly(A(-)) 4 to 18 S RNA from S phase HeLa polyribosomes contains: (a) large quantities of discrete 7.4 and 8 S RNA species which are not functional histone mRNA; (b) a discrete 8.6 S RNA fraction which contains the templates of human histone H4; (c) 9.2 to 10.7 S RNA which contains mixtures of incompletely resolved histone H2B, H2A, and H3 mRNA (These mRNA species do not closely correspond to discrete RNA subfractions resolvable by our techniques.); (d) discrete 12 and 13 S RNA fractions which contain templates of human histone H1 polypeptides. The present studies also indicate that the mRNA templates of histone variants H3.2 and H3.3 have a slightly lower electrophoretic mobility than H3.1 mRNA and that H2A.2 mRNA has a slightly lower electrophoretic mobility than H2A.1 mRNA. In addition, appreciable quantities of H3.2, H3.3, and H2A.2 mRNA are bound to oligo(dT)-cellulose in 0.5 M KCl.

https://openalex.org/W1534408800,"The photoreactive glucose derivative, N-(4-azido-2-nitrophenyl)-2-amino-2-deoxy-D-glucose, has been synthesized and used as a site-directed probe to label adipocyte plasma membranes. In the absence of photoactivation, the glucose derivative was shown to inhibit D-glucose and 3-O-methyl-glucose uptake in the isolated adipocyte system. Glucose was also shown to partially inhibit the uptake of the photoreactive probe. Photolysis of this reagent with light of wavelength greater than 300 nm in the presence of intact adipose cells resulted in the covalent incorporation of radioactivity into the plasma membrane fraction. Analysis of this material by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis indicated that four membrane components were significantly labeled and that two of these components corresponded in electrophoretic mobility to the major glycoproteins with apparent molecular weights of 100,000 and 81,000. Photolysis of the glucose analog in the presence of the particulate pellet derived from homogenized adipocytes resulted in the incorporation of the radioactive label into most of the membrane proteins. Although the cells appear to be permeable to the photoreactive probe, only a few membrane components are labeled when the cells are intact, suggesting that the probe has a high affinity for these membrane components which may be functionally involved in the glucose transport system."
https://openalex.org/W1583522937,"Quantitative complementation of two overlapping fragments of staphylococcal nuclease, Nuclease-(1-126) (residues 1 to 126) and Nuclease-T-(50-149) (residues 50 to 149), simultaneously forms in 1 min, two alternative, enzymically active ordered structures (types I and II) resembling nuclease (149 residues) (Taniuchi, H., and Anfinsen, C.B. (1971) J. Biol. Chem. 246, 2291-2301). We determined the ratio of type I to type II complex formed from the two fragments as a function of time, temperature, and the presence or absence of the ligands thymidine 3',5'-diphosphate and calcium ion. The ratio of type I to type II complex was determined on the basis of the quantities of their derived complexes obtained after each experiment by removing the redundant amino acid sequences by limited digestion with trypsin in the presence of ligands. The quantity of the derived complexes was estimated by quantitative determination of the component fragments separated by gel filtration. The ratio of type I to type II complex formed in 2 min after mixing the two fragments was approximately 0.3 and appears to be independent of temperature and the presence or absence of ligands. The equilibrium of the system of type I and II complexes is attained through unfolding and folding. The ratios of type I to type II complex at the apparent equilibrium state of the system at 6 and 23 degrees were approximately 1.1 and 2.4, respectively. The observations indicate that the rate of unfolding of type II complex is greater than that of type I complex at 6 degrees and increases more than that of type I complex with increasing temperature. Thus, the change of the complementing structure from type I complex with increasing temperature. Thus, the change of the complementing structure from type I to type II causes a decrease in the activation free energy, an increase in the activation enthalpy, and thereby an increase in the activation entropy of unfolding. Since the unfolded states with which type I and II complexes are in equilibrium are the same, the distribution of the population of type I and II complexes at the equilibrium state will be determined on the basis of the respective decreases in Gibbs standard free energy from the unfolded state to type I and II complexes. On this basis type I complex has a lower energy by deltaG0 = -0.05 and -0.51 kcal mol-1 at 6 and 23 degrees, respectively, than type II complex. Nevertheless, at the initial complementation the population of type I complex formed is approximately one-third that of type II complex at both 6 and 23 degrees. That is, the probability (rate) of folding is not related to the decrease in energy from the unfolded to the folded state. Using van't Hoff's equation deltaH = 7.5 kcal mol-1 and then deltaS degrees = 27 cal deg-1 mol-1 from type II to type I complex."

Solubilized enzyme activities from whole cells were partially purified and characterized by ion exchange and ion filtration chromatography and velocity sedimenttation analysis. Three nucleotide polymerase types were investigated: (a) DNA-dependent RNA polymerases; (b) RNA-dependent terminal ribonucleotidyltransferases, and (c) DNA-dependent DNA polymerases. The two characteristic forms of eucaryotic DNA-dependent RNA polymerases, polymerase I (nucleolar) and polymerase II (nucleoplasmic), were identified. Polymerase III was only marginally detectable even in the earliest developmental populations. At least two species of RNA-dependent terminal ribosyltransferases were present. One apparently was the poly(A) polymerase observed in other systems. The other terminal transferase was present in two chromatographic forms, required an RNA primer, and used UTP and/or CTP as particularly efficient substrates. Three DNA polymerase activities were resolved, two of which were characteristic of the alpha and beta DNA polymerases described in other eucaryotic systems. The third polymerase was not the gamma polymerase but a separate entity. Poly(dC)-dependent RNA polymerase activity, associated with the alpha polymerase, was relatively enriched in the third DNA polymerase species. The activity levels of the nucleotide polymerases were monitored as a function of red cell maturation. Characteristic declining patterns of activity were obtained for each enzyme which correlate well with the synthetic rates of their in vivo products where these are known. These results correlate well with the synthetic rates of their in vivo products where these are known. These results are consistent with the postulate that the general transcriptive and replicative control processes operating during development may involve changes in the level of the requisite polymerases."

It has a molecular weight of 53,000 +/- 2,500 as determined by sucrose gradient sedimentation. Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate indicates the protein is composed of four subunits, each polypeptide possessing a molecular weight of 13,000. Its isoelectric point is 10.3 +/- 0.2. The endonuclease has a pH optimum at 6.6, requires Mg2+ or Mn2+ for activity, and does not attack RNA. The enzyme appears to be present in tissues other than calf thymus. The enzyme catalyzes the endonucleolytic cleavage of both denatured and native eukaryotic DNA.

Injection of cholera enterotoxin into brain nuclei may be a useful procedure for pharmacologically activating selected neuronal systems of brain and for studying the pharmacology of drugs that are suspected of interacting with these systems."
https://openalex.org/W1531657181,"Corticosteroid-21-aldehydes were reduced only at C-20 by 20 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.53) of Streptomyces hydrogenans, and the reduction occurred by transfer of hydrogen from the B-side of NADH. A kinetic investigation of cortisol, cortisone, cortexolone, and the 21-aldehydes of each indicated: (a) the magnitude of the Michaelis constant for any substrate was independent of the second substrate concentration; (b) the 21-aldehydes had larger Michaelis constants (5- to 8-fold) and larger maximum velocities (16- to 40-fold) than the steroids from which they were synthesized; (c) the Michaelis constant for NADH, 29 muM, was independent of the steroid substrate. With cortisol and cortisol-21-aldehyde, product inhibition patterns showed only slope effects with steroid product and NAD+, suggesting a random mechanism. Inhibition studies with the poor substrate cortisol indicated that cortisol and cortisol-21-aldehyde were reduced at the same site. The inhibition constant (180 muM) agreed with the Michaelis constant of cortisol (140 muM). The steroid product, 20beta-hydroxyprogesterone, gives noncompetitive inhibition patterns with respect to NADH and cortisol-21-aldehyde, indicating a separate binding site exists on the enzyme for this inhibitor. The intrinsic protein fluorescence of 20beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase was quenched by NADH (56%) with a dissociation constant of 16 muM. NAD quenched the protein fluorescence somewhat less (31%) with a dissociation constant of 104 muM. The fluorescence of 2-p-toluidine-6-naphthalene sulfonate is enhanced in the presence of enzyme, and there is a blue shift in the emission wavelength maximum. The enzyme-enhanced 2-p-toluidine-6-naphthalene sulfonate fluorescence is quenched by NAD+ (32%) with a dissociation constant of 128 muM. Corticosteroids and their corresponding 21-aldehydes completely quench the enhanced 2-p-toluidine-6-naphthalene sulfonate fluorescence and this feature can be used to determine enzyme-steroid dissociation constants. Corticosteroid-21-aldehydes and NAD+ dissociation constants determined in this manner agree with values obtained in kinetic measurements. The dissociation constants determined for cortisol, cortisone, cortexolone, progesterone, and 20beta-hydroxyprogesterone were at least 1 order of magnitude greater than the corresponding kinetic constants, and these findings suggest the presence of a kinetically insignificant binding site."
https://openalex.org/W1979892998,"The chemistry of the oak leaf roller sex pheromone is shown by means of microozonolysis and computerized gas chromatography-mass spectrometry to be dominated by an approximate 70 to 30 ratio of E- and Z-11-tetradecenyl acetates. Tetradecenyl acetates are undetectable in highly purified oak leaf, apple leaf, and corn extracts analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. These results reflect negatively on previous reports and on the hypothesis that plant components might govern insect chemical communication systems."

https://openalex.org/W2066851125,A model which equates oxygen transport to hemoglobin concentration and molecular weight is used to demonstrate that high concentrations of hemoglobin will augment oxygen transport only if the molecular weight of the hemoglobin is low. The evolution of corpuscles is a necessary counterpart to having high concentrations of the low molecular weight hemoglobins. corpuscles prevent loss of the small molecules by way of excretory filters and prevent the development of exceedingly high plasma osmotic pressures.
