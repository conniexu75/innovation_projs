https://openalex.org/W3010985052,"Caspase-dependent apoptosis accounts for approximately 90% of homeostatic cell turnover in the body1, and regulates inflammation, cell proliferation, and tissue regeneration2-4. How apoptotic cells mediate such diverse effects is not fully understood. Here we profiled the apoptotic metabolite secretome and determined its effects on the tissue neighbourhood. We show that apoptotic lymphocytes and macrophages release specific metabolites, while retaining their membrane integrity. A subset of these metabolites is also shared across different primary cells and cell lines after the induction of apoptosis by different stimuli. Mechanistically, the apoptotic metabolite secretome is not simply due to passive emptying of cellular contents and instead is a regulated process. Caspase-mediated opening of pannexin 1 channels at the plasma membrane facilitated the release of a select subset of metabolites. In addition, certain metabolic pathways continued to remain active during apoptosis, with the release of only select metabolites from a given pathway. Functionally, the apoptotic metabolite secretome induced specific gene programs in healthy neighbouring cells, including suppression of inflammation, cell proliferation, and wound healing. Furthermore, a cocktail of apoptotic metabolites reduced disease severity in mouse models of inflammatory arthritis and lung-graft rejection. These data advance the concept that apoptotic cells are not inert cells waiting for removal, but instead release metabolites as 'good-bye' signals to actively modulate outcomes in tissues."
https://openalex.org/W3014742353,"Photoinduced electron transfer (PET) is a phenomenon whereby the absorption of light by a chemical species provides an energetic driving force for an electron-transfer reaction1-4. This mechanism is relevant in many areas of chemistry, including the study of natural and artificial photosynthesis, photovoltaics and photosensitive materials. In recent years, research in the area of photoredox catalysis has enabled the use of PET for the catalytic generation of both neutral and charged organic free-radical species. These technologies have enabled previously inaccessible chemical transformations and have been widely used in both academic and industrial settings. Such reactions are often catalysed by visible-light-absorbing organic molecules or transition-metal complexes of ruthenium, iridium, chromium or copper5,6. Although various closed-shell organic molecules have been shown to behave as competent electron-transfer catalysts in photoredox reactions, there are only limited reports of PET reactions involving neutral organic radicals as excited-state donors or acceptors. This is unsurprising because the lifetimes of doublet excited states of neutral organic radicals are typically several orders of magnitude shorter than the singlet lifetimes of known transition-metal photoredox catalysts7-11. Here we document the discovery, characterization and reactivity of a neutral acridine radical with a maximum excited-state oxidation potential of -3.36 volts versus a saturated calomel electrode, which is similarly reducing to elemental lithium, making this radical one of the most potent chemical reductants reported12. Spectroscopic, computational and chemical studies indicate that the formation of a twisted intramolecular charge-transfer species enables the population of higher-energy doublet excited states, leading to the observed potent photoreducing behaviour. We demonstrate that this catalytically generated PET catalyst facilitates several chemical reactions that typically require alkali metal reductants and can be used in other organic transformations that require dissolving metal reductants."
https://openalex.org/W3011410517,"Cancer genomics studies have identified thousands of putative cancer driver genes1. Development of high-throughput and accurate models to define the functions of these genes is a major challenge. Here we devised a scalable cancer-spheroid model and performed genome-wide CRISPR screens in 2D monolayers and 3D lung-cancer spheroids. CRISPR phenotypes in 3D more accurately recapitulated those of in vivo tumours, and genes with differential sensitivities between 2D and 3D conditions were highly enriched for genes that are mutated in lung cancers. These analyses also revealed drivers that are essential for cancer growth in 3D and in vivo, but not in 2D. Notably, we found that carboxypeptidase D is responsible for removal of a C-terminal RKRR motif2 from the α-chain of the insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor that is critical for receptor activity. Carboxypeptidase D expression correlates with patient outcomes in patients with lung cancer, and loss of carboxypeptidase D reduced tumour growth. Our results reveal key differences between 2D and 3D cancer models, and establish a generalizable strategy for performing CRISPR screens in spheroids to reveal cancer vulnerabilities."

https://openalex.org/W3011709397,"Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) and promoter- or enhancer-associated unstable transcripts locate preferentially to chromatin, where some regulate chromatin structure, transcription and RNA processing1-13. Although several RNA sequences responsible for nuclear localization have been identified-such as repeats in the lncRNA Xist and Alu-like elements in long RNAs14-16-how lncRNAs as a class are enriched at chromatin remains unknown. Here we describe a random, mutagenesis-coupled, high-throughput method that we name 'RNA elements for subcellular localization by sequencing' (mutREL-seq). Using this method, we discovered an RNA motif that recognizes the U1 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (snRNP) and is essential for the localization of reporter RNAs to chromatin. Across the genome, chromatin-bound lncRNAs are enriched with 5' splice sites and depleted of 3' splice sites, and exhibit high levels of U1 snRNA binding compared with cytoplasm-localized messenger RNAs. Acute depletion of U1 snRNA or of the U1 snRNP protein component SNRNP70 markedly reduces the chromatin association of hundreds of lncRNAs and unstable transcripts, without altering the overall transcription rate in cells. In addition, rapid degradation of SNRNP70 reduces the localization of both nascent and polyadenylated lncRNA transcripts to chromatin, and disrupts the nuclear and genome-wide localization of the lncRNA Malat1. Moreover, U1 snRNP interacts with transcriptionally engaged RNA polymerase II. These results show that U1 snRNP acts widely to tether and mobilize lncRNAs to chromatin in a transcription-dependent manner. Our findings have uncovered a previously unknown role of U1 snRNP beyond the processing of precursor mRNA, and provide molecular insight into how lncRNAs are recruited to regulatory sites to carry out chromatin-associated functions."
https://openalex.org/W3012547664,"Southern Ocean ecosystems are under pressure from resource exploitation and climate change1,2. Mitigation requires the identification and protection of Areas of Ecological Significance (AESs), which have so far not been determined at the ocean-basin scale. Here, using assemblage-level tracking of marine predators, we identify AESs for this globally important region and assess current threats and protection levels. Integration of more than 4,000 tracks from 17 bird and mammal species reveals AESs around sub-Antarctic islands in the Atlantic and Indian Oceans and over the Antarctic continental shelf. Fishing pressure is disproportionately concentrated inside AESs, and climate change over the next century is predicted to impose pressure on these areas, particularly around the Antarctic continent. At present, 7.1% of the ocean south of 40°S is under formal protection, including 29% of the total AESs. The establishment and regular revision of networks of protection that encompass AESs are needed to provide long-term mitigation of growing pressures on Southern Ocean ecosystems. Tracking data from 17 marine predator species in the Southern Ocean are used to identify Areas of Ecological Significance, the protection of which could help to mitigate increasing pressures on Southern Ocean ecosystems."

https://openalex.org/W3015092648,"Pluripotent stem cells are increasingly used to model different aspects of embryogenesis and organ formation1. Despite recent advances in in vitro induction of major mesodermal lineages and cell types2,3, experimental model systems that can recapitulate more complex features of human mesoderm development and patterning are largely missing. Here we used induced pluripotent stem cells for the stepwise in vitro induction of presomitic mesoderm and its derivatives to model distinct aspects of human somitogenesis. We focused initially on modelling the human segmentation clock, a major biological concept believed to underlie the rhythmic and controlled emergence of somites, which give rise to the segmental pattern of the vertebrate axial skeleton. We observed oscillatory expression of core segmentation clock genes, including HES7 and DKK1, determined the period of the human segmentation clock to be around five hours, and demonstrated the presence of dynamic travelling-wave-like gene expression in in vitro-induced human presomitic mesoderm. Furthermore, we identified and compared oscillatory genes in human and mouse presomitic mesoderm derived from pluripotent stem cells, which revealed species-specific and shared molecular components and pathways associated with the putative mouse and human segmentation clocks. Using CRISPR–Cas9-based genome editing technology, we then targeted genes for which mutations in patients with segmentation defects of the vertebrae, such as spondylocostal dysostosis, have been reported (HES7, LFNG, DLL3 and MESP2). Subsequent analysis of patient-like and patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cells revealed gene-specific alterations in oscillation, synchronization or differentiation properties. Our findings provide insights into the human segmentation clock as well as diseases associated with human axial skeletogenesis. A system involving in vitro induction of presomitic mesoderm recapitulates oscillatory expression of core segmentation clock genes and travelling-wave-like gene expression, suggesting that this system can be used to study the human segmentation clock and provide insights into diseases associated with human axial skeletogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W3012994109,"Paternal and maternal epigenomes undergo marked changes after fertilization1. Recent epigenomic studies have revealed the unusual chromatin landscapes that are present in oocytes, sperm and early preimplantation embryos, including atypical patterns of histone modifications2–4 and differences in chromosome organization and accessibility, both in gametes5–8 and after fertilization5,8–10. However, these studies have led to very different conclusions: the global absence of local topological-associated domains (TADs) in gametes and their appearance in the embryo8,9 versus the pre-existence of TADs and loops in the zygote5,11. The questions of whether parental structures can be inherited in the newly formed embryo and how these structures might relate to allele-specific gene regulation remain open. Here we map genomic interactions for each parental genome (including the X chromosome), using an optimized single-cell high-throughput chromosome conformation capture (HiC) protocol12,13, during preimplantation in the mouse. We integrate chromosome organization with allelic expression states and chromatin marks, and reveal that higher-order chromatin structure after fertilization coincides with an allele-specific enrichment of methylation of histone H3 at lysine 27. These early parental-specific domains correlate with gene repression and participate in parentally biased gene expression—including in recently described, transiently imprinted loci14. We also find TADs that arise in a non-parental-specific manner during a second wave of genome assembly. These de novo domains are associated with active chromatin. Finally, we obtain insights into the relationship between TADs and gene expression by investigating structural changes to the paternal X chromosome before and during X chromosome inactivation in preimplantation female embryos15. We find that TADs are lost as genes become silenced on the paternal X chromosome but linger in regions that escape X chromosome inactivation. These findings demonstrate the complex dynamics of three-dimensional genome organization and gene expression during early development. Single-cell allelic HiC analysis, combined with allelic gene expression and chromatin states, reveals parent-of-origin-specific dynamics of chromosome organization and gene expression during mouse preimplantation development."

https://openalex.org/W3013159655,"Radial glial progenitor cells (RGPs) are the major neural progenitor cells that generate neurons and glia in the developing mammalian cerebral cortex1–4. In RGPs, the centrosome is positioned away from the nucleus at the apical surface of the ventricular zone of the cerebral cortex5–8. However, the molecular basis and precise function of this distinctive subcellular organization of the centrosome are largely unknown. Here we show in mice that anchoring of the centrosome to the apical membrane controls the mechanical properties of cortical RGPs, and consequently their mitotic behaviour and the size and formation of the cortex. The mother centriole in RGPs develops distal appendages that anchor it to the apical membrane. Selective removal of centrosomal protein 83 (CEP83) eliminates these distal appendages and disrupts the anchorage of the centrosome to the apical membrane, resulting in the disorganization of microtubules and stretching and stiffening of the apical membrane. The elimination of CEP83 also activates the mechanically sensitive yes-associated protein (YAP) and promotes the excessive proliferation of RGPs, together with a subsequent overproduction of intermediate progenitor cells, which leads to the formation of an enlarged cortex with abnormal folding. Simultaneous elimination of YAP suppresses the cortical enlargement and folding that is induced by the removal of CEP83. Together, these results indicate a previously unknown role of the centrosome in regulating the mechanical features of neural progenitor cells and the size and configuration of the mammalian cerebral cortex. CEP83-mediated anchoring of the centrosome to the apical membrane in radial glial progenitor cells regulates their mechanical properties and thereby influences the size and configuration of the mammalian cortex."
https://openalex.org/W3014540271,"When Cooper pairs are formed with finite center-of-mass momentum, the defining characteristic is a spatially modulating superconducting energy gap $\Delta(r)$. Recently, this concept has been generalized to the pair density wave (PDW) state predicted to exist in a variety of strongly correlated electronic materials such as the cuprates. Although the signature of a cuprate PDW has been detected in Cooper-pair tunnelling, the distinctive signature in single-electron tunneling of a periodic $\Delta(r)$ modulation has never been observed. Here, using a new approach, we discover strong $\Delta(r)$ modulations in Bi$_2$Sr$_2$CaCu$_2$O$_8$+$\delta$ that have eight-unit-cell periodicity or wavevectors $Q=2{\pi}/a_0(1/8,0)$; $2{\pi}/a_0(0,1/8)$. This constitutes the first energy-resolved spectroscopic evidence for the cuprate PDW state. An analysis of spatial arrangements of $\Delta(r)$ modulations then reveals that this PDW is predominantly unidirectional, but with an arrangement of nanoscale domains indicative of a vestigial PDW. Simultaneous imaging of the local-density-of-states $N(r,E)$ reveals electronic modulations with wavevectors $Q$ and $2Q$, as anticipated when the PDW coexists with superconductivity. Finally, by visualizing the topological defects in these $N(r,E)$ density waves at $2Q$, we discover them to be concentrated in areas where the PDW spatial phase changes by $\pi$, as predicted by the theory of half-vortices in a PDW state. Overall, this is a compelling demonstration, from multiple single-electron signatures, of a PDW state coexisting with superconductivity at zero magnetic field, in the canonical cuprate Bi$_2$Sr$_2$CaCu$_2$O$_8$+$\delta$."
https://openalex.org/W3015035352,"Enteroids are cultured primary intestinal epithelial cells that recapitulate epithelial lineage development allowing for a more complex and physiologically relevant model for scientific study. The large presence of intestinal stem cells (ISC) in these enteroids allows for the study of metabolite effects on cellular processes and resulting progeny cells. Short-chain fatty acids (SCFA) such as butyrate (BUT) are bacterial metabolites produced in the gastrointestinal tract that are considered to be beneficial to host cells. Therefore, the objective was to study the effects of SCFAs on biomarkers of ISC activity, differentiation, barrier function and epithelial defense in the intestine using mouse and human enteroid models. Enteroids were treated with two concentrations of acetate (ACET), propionate (PROP), or BUT for 24 h. Enteroids treated with BUT or PROP showed a decrease in proliferation via EdU uptake relative to the controls in both mouse and human models. Gene expression of Lgr5 was shown to decrease with BUT and PROP treatments, but increased with ACET. As a result of BUT and PROP treatments, there was an increase in differentiation markers for enterocyte, Paneth, goblet, and enteroendocrine cells. Gene expression of antimicrobial proteins Reg3β, Reg3γ, and Defb1 were stimulated by BUT and PROP, but not by ACET which had a greater effect on expression of tight junction genes Cldn3 and Ocln in 3D enteroids. Similar results were obtained with human enteroids treated with 10 mM SCFAs and grown in either 3D or Transwell™ model cultures, although tight junctions were influenced by BUT and PROP, but not ACET in monolayer format. Furthermore, BUT and PROP treatments increased transepithelial electrical resistance after 24 h compared to ACET or control. Overall, individual SCFAs are potent stimulators of cellular gene expression, however, PROP and especially BUT show great efficacy for driving cell differentiation and gene expression."
https://openalex.org/W3014468167,"Microtubule-associated protein (MAP) 2 has been perceived as a static cytoskeletal protein enriched in neuronal dendritic shafts. Emerging evidence indicates dynamic functions for various MAPs in activity-dependent synaptic plasticity. However, it is unclear how MAP2 is associated with synaptic plasticity mechanisms. Here, we demonstrate that specific silencing of high-molecular-weight MAP2 in vivo abolished induction of long-term potentiation (LTP) in the Schaffer collateral pathway of CA1 pyramidal neurons and in vitro blocked LTP-induced surface delivery of AMPA receptors and spine enlargement. In mature hippocampal neurons, we observed rapid translocation of a subpopulation of MAP2, present in dendritic shafts, to spines following LTP stimulation. Time-lapse confocal imaging showed that spine translocation of MAP2 was coupled with LTP-induced spine enlargement. Consistently, immunogold electron microscopy revealed that LTP stimulation of the Schaffer collateral pathway promoted MAP2 labeling in spine heads of CA1 neurons. This translocation depended on NMDA receptor activation and Ras-MAPK signaling. Furthermore, LTP stimulation led to an increase in surface-expressed AMPA receptors specifically in the neurons with MAP2 spine translocation. Altogether, this study indicates a novel role for MAP2 in LTP mechanisms and suggests that MAP2 participates in activity-dependent synaptic plasticity in mature hippocampal networks."
https://openalex.org/W3015005291,"The eicosanoid lipoxin A4 and aspirin-triggered 15-epi-lipoxin A4 (ATL) are potent anti-inflammatory agents. How their anti-inflammatory effects are mediated by receptors such as the formyl peptide receptor 2 (FPR2/ALX) remains incompletely understood. In the present study, fluorescent biosensors of FPR2/ALX were prepared and ATL-induced conformational changes were recorded. A biphasic dose curve consisting of a descending phase and an ascending phase was observed, with the descending phase corresponding to diminished FPR2 response such as Ca2+ mobilization induced by the potent synthetic agonist WKYMVm. Preincubation of FPR2-expressing cells with 100 pM of ATL also lowered the threshold for WKYMVm to induce β-arrestin-2 membrane translocation, and inhibited WKYMVm-induced interleukin 8 secretion, suggesting signaling bias favoring anti-inflammatory activities. At 100 pM and above, ATL-induced receptor conformational changes resembling that of the WKYMVm along with a weak but measurable inhibition of forskolin-induced cAMP accumulation. However, no Ca2+ mobilization was induced by ATL until its concentration reached 1 µM. Taken together, these results suggest a dual regulatory mechanism by which ATL exerts anti-inflammatory effects through FPR2/ALX."
https://openalex.org/W3014676550,"We developed an integrated R library called BWGS to enable easy computation of Genomic Estimates of Breeding values (GEBV) for genomic selection. BWGS, for BreedWheat Genomic selection, was developed in the framework of a cooperative private-public partnership project called Breedwheat (https://breedwheat.fr) and relies on existing R-libraries, all freely available from CRAN servers. The two main functions enable to run 1) replicated random cross validations within a training set of genotyped and phenotyped lines and 2) GEBV prediction, for a set of genotyped-only lines. Options are available for 1) missing data imputation, 2) markers and training set selection and 3) genomic prediction with 15 different methods, either parametric or semi-parametric. The usefulness and efficiency of BWGS are illustrated using a population of wheat lines from a real breeding programme. Adjusted yield data from historical trials (highly unbalanced design) were used for testing the options of BWGS. On the whole, 760 candidate lines with adjusted phenotypes and genotypes for 47 839 robust SNP were used. With a simple desktop computer, we obtained results which compared with previously published results on wheat genomic selection. As predicted by the theory, factors that are most influencing predictive ability, for a given trait of moderate heritability, are the size of the training population and a minimum number of markers for capturing every QTL information. Missing data up to 40%, if randomly distributed, do not degrade predictive ability once imputed, and up to 80% randomly distributed missing data are still acceptable once imputed with Expectation-Maximization method of package rrBLUP. It is worth noticing that selecting markers that are most associated to the trait do improve predictive ability, compared with the whole set of markers, but only when marker selection is made on the whole population. When marker selection is made only on the sampled training set, this advantage nearly disappeared, since it was clearly due to overfitting. Few differences are observed between the 15 prediction models with this dataset. Although non-parametric methods that are supposed to capture non-additive effects have slightly better predictive accuracy, differences remain small. Finally, the GEBV from the 15 prediction models are all highly correlated to each other. These results are encouraging for an efficient use of genomic selection in applied breeding programmes and BWGS is a simple and powerful toolbox to apply in breeding programmes or training activities."
https://openalex.org/W3014320105,"Branched-chain α-keto acid dehydrogenase kinase (BCKDK), the key enzyme of branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) metabolism, has been reported to promote colorectal cancer (CRC) tumorigenesis by upregulating the MEK-ERK signaling pathway. However, the profile of BCKDK in metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) remains unknown. Here, we report a novel role of BCKDK in mCRC. BCKDK is upregulated in CRC tissues. Increased BCKDK expression was associated with metastasis and poor clinical prognosis in CRC patients. Knockdown of BCKDK decreased CRC cell migration and invasion ex vivo, and lung metastasis in vivo. BCKDK promoted the epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT) program, by decreasing the expression of E-cadherin, epithelial marker, and increasing the expression of N-cadherin and Vimentin, which are mesenchymal markers. Moreover, BCKDK-knockdown experiments in combination with phosphoproteomics analysis revealed the potent role of BCKDK in modulating multiple signal transduction pathways, including EMT and metastasis. Src phosphorylated BCKDK at the tyrosine 246 (Y246) site in vitro and ex vivo. Knockdown and knockout of Src downregulated the phosphorylation of BCKDK. Importantly, phosphorylation of BCKDK by Src enhanced the activity and stability of BCKDK, thereby promoting the migration, invasion, and EMT of CRC cells. In summary, the identification of BCKDK as a novel prometastatic factor in human CRC will be beneficial for further diagnostic biomarker studies and suggests novel targeting opportunities."
https://openalex.org/W3014464286,"Esophageal cancer represents the eighth most frequently occurring cancer, as well as the sixth most widespread cause of cancer-related deaths. In recent years, accumulating evidence has implicated long non-coding RNAs in the progression of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC). The aim of the present study was to investigate the potential involvement and underlying mechanisms of LINC00337 in ESCC. Expression patterns of LINC00337 and targeting protein for Xenopus kinesin-like protein 2 (TPX2) in ESCC tissues and cells were detected using RT-qPCR and immunohistochemical staining. Next, the interactions among LINC00337, E2F4, and TPX2 were identified using chromatin immunoprecipitation, dual-luciferase reporter, and RNA-binding protein immunoprecipitation assays, suggesting that LINC00337 could recruit E2F4 to enhance the transcription of TPX2. Thereafter, the regulatory roles of LINC00337 and TPX2 in ESCC were analyzed by altering the expression of LINC00337 or TPX2 in ESCC cells following treatment with cisplatin (DDP). The levels of autophagy-related proteins Beclin1 and LC3II/LC3I, viability, autophagy, apoptosis, and chemoresistance of ESCC cells to DDP were measured following transfection treatment with different plasmids. Additionally, the role of the LINC00337/E2F4/TPX2 axis was assessed in vivo by measuring tumor formation in nude mice. The results demonstrated that LINC00337 upregulated TPX2, consequently leading to elevated levels of Beclin1 and LC3II/LC3I, promoted cell viability and autophagy, while inhibiting apoptosis and chemosensitivity to DDP in ESCC. In sum, the current study evidenced that the overexpression of LINC00337 could potentially enhance ESCC cell autophagy and chemoresistance to DDP via the upregulation of TPX2 by recruiting E2F4. Thus, LINC00337 may serve as a potential candidate for the treatment of ESCC."
https://openalex.org/W3014284520,"Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is a common monogenic disorder, characterized by bilateral renal cyst formation. Multiple pathways are de-regulated in cystic epithelia offering good opportunities for therapy. Others and we have previously reported that metabolic reprogramming, including alterations of the TCA cycle, are prominent features of ADPKD. Several lines of evidence suggest that mitochondrial impairment might be responsible for the metabolic alterations. Here, we performed morphologic and morphometric evaluation of mitochondria by TEM in an orthologous mouse model of PKD caused by mutations in the Pkd1 gene (Ksp-Cre;Pkd1flox/−). Furthermore, we measured mitochondrial respiration by COX and SDH enzymatic activity in situ. We found several alterations including reduced mitochondrial mass, altered structure and fragmentation of the mitochondrial network in cystic epithelia of Ksp-Cre;Pkd1flox/− mice. At the molecular level, we found reduced expression of the pro-fusion proteins OPA1 and MFN1 and up-regulation of the pro-fission protein DRP1. Importantly, administration of Mdivi-1, which interferes with DRP1 rescuing mitochondrial fragmentation, significantly reduced kidney/body weight, cyst formation, and improved renal function in Ksp-Cre;Pkd1flox/− mice. Our data indicate that impaired mitochondrial structure and function play a role in disease progression, and that their improvement can significantly modify the course of the disease."
https://openalex.org/W3014233600,"Exploration in reward-based motor learning is observable in experimental data as increased variability. In order to quantify exploration, we compare three methods for estimating other sources of variability: sensorimotor noise. We use a task in which participants could receive stochastic binary reward feedback following a target-directed weight shift. Participants first performed six baseline blocks without feedback, and next twenty blocks alternating with and without feedback. Variability was assessed based on trial-to-trial changes in movement endpoint. We estimated sensorimotor noise by the median squared trial-to-trial change in movement endpoint for trials in which no exploration is expected. We identified three types of such trials: trials in baseline blocks, trials in the blocks without feedback, and rewarded trials in the blocks with feedback. We estimated exploration by the median squared trial-to-trial change following non-rewarded trials minus sensorimotor noise. As expected, variability was larger following non-rewarded trials than following rewarded trials. This indicates that our reward-based weight-shifting task successfully induced exploration. Most importantly, our three estimates of sensorimotor noise differed: the estimate based on rewarded trials was significantly lower than the estimates based on the two types of trials without feedback. Consequently, the estimates of exploration also differed. We conclude that the quantification of exploration depends critically on the type of trials used to estimate sensorimotor noise. We recommend the use of variability following rewarded trials."
https://openalex.org/W3014644428,"Conservation laws are deeply related to any symmetry present in a physical system1,2. Analogously to electrons in atoms exhibiting spin symmetries3, it is possible to consider neutrons and protons in the atomic nucleus as projections of a single fermion with an isobaric spin (isospin) of t = 1/2 (ref. 4). Every nuclear state is thus characterized by a total isobaric spin T and a projection Tz—two quantities that are largely conserved in nuclear reactions and decays5,6. A mirror symmetry emerges from this isobaric-spin formalism: nuclei with exchanged numbers of neutrons and protons, known as mirror nuclei, should have an identical set of states7, including their ground state, labelled by their total angular momentum J and parity π. Here we report evidence of mirror-symmetry violation in bound nuclear ground states within the mirror partners strontium-73 and bromine-73. We find that a J π = 5/2− spin assignment is needed to explain the proton-emission pattern observed from the T = 3/2 isobaric-analogue state in rubidium-73, which is identical to the ground state of strontium-73. Therefore the ground state of strontium-73 must differ from its J π = 1/2− mirror bromine-73. This observation offers insights into charge-symmetry-breaking forces acting in atomic nuclei. Observations of the decay of 73Sr, when compared to its mirror nucleus 73Br, indicate that the spin assignment of their ground states differ, demonstrating mirror-symmetry violation."
https://openalex.org/W3014774660,"The triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (TREM2) is a multifunctional surface protein that affects survival, migration, and phagocytic capacity of myeloid cells. Soluble TREM2 levels were found to be increased in early stages of sporadic and familial Alzheimer's disease (AD) probably reflecting a defensive microglial response to some initial brain damage. The disintegrin and metalloproteases (ADAM) 10 and 17 were identified as TREM2 sheddases. We demonstrate that meprin β is a direct TREM2 cleaving enzyme using ADAM10/17 deficient HEK293 cells. LC-MS/MS analysis of recombinant TREM2 incubated with meprin β revealed predominant cleavage between Arg136 and Asp137, distant to the site identified for ADAM10/17. We further demonstrate that the metalloprotease meprin β cleaves TREM2 on macrophages concomitant with decreased levels of soluble TREM2 in the serum of Mep1b−/− mice compared to WT controls. Isolated BMDMs from Mep1b−/− mice showed significantly increased full-length TREM2 levels and enhanced phagocytosis efficiency compared to WT cells. The diminished constitutive shedding of TREM2 on meprin β deficient macrophages could be rescued by ADAM stimulation through LPS treatment. Our data provide evidence that meprin β is a TREM2 sheddase on macrophages and suggest that multiple proteases may be involved in the generation of soluble TREM2."
https://openalex.org/W3014103560,"Abstract Despite advances in the systemic treatment of patients with metastatic melanoma using immune checkpoint and tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI), the majority of stage IV melanoma patients eventually succumb to the disease. We have previously identified the transcription factor Sox10 as a crucial player in melanoma, yet the underlying molecular mechanisms mediating Sox10-dependent tumorigenesis remain largely uncharacterized. Here, we show that MEK and RAF inhibitors do not suppress levels of SOX10 protein in patient-derived cells in vitro, as well as in melanoma patients in vivo. In a search for pharmacological inhibitors of SOX10, we performed a mass spectrometry-based screen in human melanoma cells. Subsequent analysis revealed that SOX10 directly interacts with β-catenin, which is a key mediator of canonical Wnt/β-catenin signaling. We demonstrate that inhibitors of glycogen synthase kinase 3 alpha/beta (GSK3α/β) efficiently abrogate SOX10 protein in human melanoma cells in vitro and in melanoma mouse models in vivo. The mechanism of action of GSK3-mediated SOX10 suppression is transcription-independent and relies on the presence of a proteasome degradable form of β-catenin. Taken together, we provide evidence that activation of canonical Wnt signaling has a profound effect on melanoma growth and is able to counteract Sox10-dependent melanoma maintenance both in vitro and in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W3014487511,"CD47 is an immune checkpoint protein that downregulates both the innate and adaptive anti-tumor immune response via its counter receptor SIRPα. Biologics, including humanized CD47 monoclonal antibodies and decoy SIRPα receptors, that block the SIRPα-CD47 interaction, are currently being developed as cancer immunotherapy agents. However, adverse side effects and limited penetration of tumor tissue associated with their structure and large size may impede their clinical application. We recently developed a quantitative high throughput screening assay platform to identify small molecules that disrupt the binding of SIRPα and CD47 as an alternative approach to these protein-based therapeutics. Here, we report on the development and optimization of a cell-based binding assay to validate active small molecules from our biochemical screening effort. This assay has a low volume, high capacity homogenous format that relies on laser scanning cytometry (LSC) and associated techniques to enhance signal to noise measurement of cell surface binding. The LSC assay is specific, concentration dependent, and validated for the two major human SIRPα variants (V1 and V2), with results that parallel those of our biochemical data as well as published studies. We also utilized the LSC assay to confirm published studies showing that the inhibition of amino-terminal pyroglutamate formation on CD47 using the glutaminyl cyclase inhibitor SEN177 disrupts SIRPα binding. The SIRPα-CD47 interaction could be quantitatively measured in live and fixed tumor cells. Use of fixed cells reduces the burden of cell maintenance and provides stable cell standards to control for inter- and intra-assay variations. We also demonstrate the utility of the assay to characterize the activity of the first reported small molecule antagonists of the SIRPα-CD47 interaction. This assay will support the screening of thousands of compounds to identify or validate active small molecules as hits, develop structure activity relationships and assist in the optimization of hits to leads by a typical iterative medicinal chemistry campaign."

However, the processes enabling cone vision in bright light (i.e. photopic vision) are not adequately understood.

In the RPE, isomerization of all-trans-retinyl esters to 11-cis-retinol is mediated by the retinoid isomerohydrolase Rpe65. A putative alternative retinoid isomerase, dihydroceramide desaturase-1 (DES1), is expressed in RPE and Müller cells. The retinol-isomerase activities of Rpe65 and Des1 are inhibited by emixustat and fenretinide, respectively. Here, we tested the effects of these visual cycle inhibitors on immediate, early, and late phases of cone photopic vision. In zebrafish larvae raised under cyclic light conditions, fenretinide impaired late cone photopic vision, while the emixustat-treated zebrafish unexpectedly had normal vision. In contrast, emixustat-treated larvae raised under extensive dark-adaptation displayed significantly attenuated immediate photopic vision concomitant with significantly reduced 11-cis-retinaldehyde (11cRAL). Following 30 min of light, early photopic vision was recovered, despite 11cRAL levels remaining significantly reduced. Defects in immediate cone photopic vision were rescued in emixustat- or fenretinide-treated larvae following exogenous 9-cis-retinaldehyde supplementation. Genetic knockout of Des1 (degs1) or retinaldehyde-binding protein 1b (rlbp1b) did not eliminate photopic vision in zebrafish. Our findings define molecular and temporal requirements of the nonphotopic or photopic visual cycles for mediating vision in bright light.

While radiation and immunotherapies are routinely studied in the murine Gl261 glioma model, little is known about its inherent immune response. This study quantifies the temporal and spatial localization of immune cell populations and mediators during glioma development. Eight-week old male C57Bl/6 mice were orthotopically inoculated with 1x106 Gl261 cells and tumor morphology, local and systemic immune cell populations, and plasma cytokines/chemokines assessed at day 0, 1, 3, 7, 14, and 21 post-inoculation by magnetic resonance imaging, chromogenic immunohistochemistry, multiplex immunofluorescent immunohistochemistry, flow cytometry and multiplex immunoassay respectively. From day 3 tumors were distinguishable with >30% Ki67 and increased tissue vascularization (p<0.05). Increasing tumor proliferation/malignancy and vascularization were associated with significant temporal changes in immune cell populations within the tumor (p<0.05) and systemic compartments (p = 0.02 to p<0.0001). Of note, at day 14 16/24 plasma cytokine/chemokines levels decreased coinciding with an increase in tumor cytotoxic T cells, natural killer and natural killer/T cells. Data derived provide baseline characterization of the local and systemic immune response during glioma development. They reveal that type II macrophages and myeloid-derived suppressor cells are more prevalent in tumors than regulatory T cells, highlighting these cell types for further therapeutic exploration."
https://openalex.org/W3014829057,"Macrophage cells form part of our first line defense against pathogens. Macrophages become activated by microbial products such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS) to produce inflammatory mediators, such as TNFα and other cytokines, which orchestrate the host defense against the pathogen. Once the pathogen has been eradicated, the activated macrophage must be appropriately deactivated or inflammatory diseases result. Interleukin-10 (IL10) is a key anti-inflammatory cytokine which deactivates the activated macrophage. The IL10 receptor (IL10R) signals through the Jak1/Tyk2 tyrosine kinases, STAT3 transcription factor and the SHIP1 inositol phosphatase. However, IL10 has also been described to induce the activation of the cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) regulated protein kinase A (PKA). We now report that IL10R signalling leads to STAT3/SHIP1 dependent expression of the EP4 receptor for prostaglandin E2 (PGE2). In macrophages, EP4 is a Gαs-protein coupled receptor that stimulates adenylate cyclase (AC) production of cAMP, leading to downstream activation of protein kinase A (PKA) and phosphorylation of the CREB transcription factor. IL10 induction of phospho-CREB and inhibition of LPS-induced phosphorylation of p85 PI3K and p70 S6 kinase required the presence of EP4. These data suggest that IL10R activation of STAT3/SHIP1 enhances EP4 expression, and that it is EP4 which activates cAMP-dependent signalling. The coordination between IL10R and EP4 signalling also provides an explanation for why cAMP elevating agents synergize with IL10 to elicit anti-inflammatory responses."
https://openalex.org/W3014874854,"Neutrophil infiltration and phenotypic transformation are believed to contribute to neuronal damage in ischemic stroke. Emerging evidence suggests that histone deacetylase 2 (HDAC2) is an epigenetic regulator of inflammatory cells. Here, we aimed to investigate whether microRNA-494 (miR-494) affects HDAC2-mediated neutrophil infiltration and phenotypic shift. MiR-494 levels in neutrophils from acute ischemic stroke (AIS) patients were detected by real-time PCR. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP)-Seq was performed to clarify which genes are the binding targets of HDAC2. Endothelial cells and cortical neurons were subjected to oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD), transwell assay was conducted to examine neutrophil migration through endothelial cells, and neuronal injury was examined after stimulating with supernatant from antagomiR-494-treated neutrophils. C57BL/6J mice were subjected to transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) and antagomiR-494 was injected through tail vein immediately after reperfusion, and neutrophil infiltration and phenotypic shift was examined. We found that the expression of miR-494 in neutrophils was significantly increased in AIS patients. HDAC2 targeted multiple matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and Fc-gamma receptor III (CD16) genes in neutrophils of AIS patients. Furthermore, antagomiR-494 repressed expression of multiple MMPs genes, including MMP7, MMP10, MMP13, and MMP16, which reduced the number of brain-infiltrating neutrophils by regulating HDAC2. AntagomiR-494 could also exert its neuroprotective role through inhibiting the shift of neutrophils toward pro-inflammatory N1 phenotype in vivo and in vitro. Taken together, miR-494 may serve as an alternative predictive biomarker of the outcome of AIS patients, and antagomiR-494 treatment decreases the expression of multiple MMPs and the infiltration of neutrophils and inhibits the shift of neutrophils into N1 phenotype partly by targeting HDAC2."
https://openalex.org/W3015015884,"Is it possible to tell how interdisciplinary and out-of-the-box scientific papers are, or which papers are mainstream? Here we use the bibliographic coupling network, derived from all physics papers that were published in the Physical Review journals in the past century, to try to identify them as mainstream, out-of-the-box, or interdisciplinary. We show that the network clusters into scientific fields. The position of individual papers with respect to these clusters allows us to estimate their degree of mainstreamness or interdisciplinarity. We show that over the past decades the fraction of mainstream papers increases, the fraction of out-of-the-box decreases, and the fraction of interdisciplinary papers remains constant. Studying the rewards of papers, we find that in terms of absolute citations, both, mainstream and interdisciplinary papers are rewarded. In the long run, mainstream papers perform less than interdisciplinary ones in terms of citation rates. We conclude that to avoid a unilateral trend towards mainstreamness a new incentive scheme is necessary."
https://openalex.org/W3014174554,"Background Choosing where to give birth can be a matter of life and death for both mother and child. Migrants, registered or unregistered, may face different choices and challenges than non-migrants. Despite this, previous research on the factors migrant women consider when deciding where to give birth is very limited. This paper addresses this gap by examining women’s decision making in a respective border and urban locale in Thailand. Methods We held focus group discussions [13] with 72 non-Thai pregnant migrant women at non-government clinics in a rural border area and at two hospitals in Chiang Mai, a large city in Northern Thailand in 2018. We asked women where they will go to give birth and to explain the factors that influenced their decision. Results Women identified getting the relevant documentation necessary to register their child’s birth, safe birth and medical advice/quality care, as the top three factors that influenced their care seeking decision making. Language of service, free or low cost care, language of services, proximity to home, and limited alternate options for care were also identified as important considerations. Conclusion Understanding factors that migrant women value when choosing where to deliver can help health care providers to create services that are responsive to migrants’ preferences and encourage provision of relevant information which may influence patient decision making. The desire to obtain birth documentation for their child appears to be important for migrants who understand the importance of personal documentation for the lives of their children. Healthcare institutions may wish to introduce processes to facilitate obtaining documentation for pregnant migrant women and their newborns."
https://openalex.org/W3014429811,"Rwanda has about 4.5 million of indigenous chicken (IC) that are very low in productivity. To initiate any genetic improvement programme, IC needs to be accurately characterized. The key purpose of this study was to ascertain the genetic diversity of IC in Rwanda using microsatellite markers. Blood samples of IC sampled from 5 agro-ecological zones were collected from which DNA was extracted, amplified by PCR and genotyped using 28 microsatellite markers. A total of 325 (313 indigenous and 12 exotic) chickens were genotyped and revealed a total number of 305 alleles varying between 2 and 22 with a mean of 10.89 per locus. One hundred eighty-six (186) distinct alleles and 60 private alleles were also observed. The frequency of private alleles was highest in samples from the Eastern region, whereas those from the North West had the lowest. The influx of genes was lower in the Eastern agro-ecological zone than the North West. The mean observed heterozygosity was 0.6155, whereas the average expected heterozygosity was 0.688. The overall inbreeding coefficient among the population was 0.040. Divergence from the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium was significant (p<0.05) in 90% of loci in all the populations. The analysis of molecular variance revealed that about 92% of the total variation originated from variation within populations. Additionally, the study demonstrated that IC in Rwanda could be clustered into four gene groups. In conclusion, there was considerable genetic diversity in IC in Rwanda, which represents a crucial genetic resource that can be conserved or optimized through genetic improvement."
https://openalex.org/W3014917221,"This study describes predictors of pneumococcal nasopharyngeal carriage and density in Fiji. We used data from four annual (2012-2015) cross-sectional surveys, pre- and post-introduction of ten-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV10) in October 2012. Infants (5-8 weeks), toddlers (12-23 months), children (2-6 years), and their caregivers participated. Pneumococci were detected and quantified using lytA qPCR, with molecular serotyping by microarray. Logistic and quantile regression were used to determine predictors of pneumococcal carriage and density, respectively. There were 8,109 participants. Pneumococcal carriage was negatively associated with years post-PCV10 introduction (global P<0.001), and positively associated with indigenous iTaukei ethnicity (aOR 2.74 [95% CI 2.17-3.45] P<0.001); young age (infant, toddler, and child compared with caregiver participant groups) (global P<0.001); urban residence (aOR 1.45 [95% CI 1.30-2.57] P<0.001); living with ≥2 children <5 years of age (aOR 1.42 [95% CI 1.27-1.59] P<0.001); low family income (aOR 1.44 [95% CI 1.28-1.62] P<0.001); and upper respiratory tract infection (URTI) symptoms (aOR 1.77 [95% CI 1.57-2.01] P<0.001). Predictors were similar for PCV10 and non-PCV10 carriage, except PCV10 carriage was negatively associated with PCV10 vaccination (0.58 [95% CI 0.41-0.82] P = 0.002) and positively associated with exposure to household cigarette smoke (aOR 1.21 [95% CI 1.02-1.43] P = 0.031), while there was no association between years post-PCV10 introduction and non-PCV10 carriage. Pneumococcal density was positively associated with URTI symptoms (adjusted median difference 0.28 [95% CI 0.16, 0.40] P<0.001) and toddler and child, compared with caregiver, participant groups (global P = 0.008). Predictors were similar for PCV10 and non-PCV10 density, except infant, toddler, and child participant groups were not associated with PCV10 density. PCV10 introduction was associated with reduced the odds of overall and PCV10 pneumococcal carriage in Fiji. However, after adjustment iTaukei ethnicity was positively associated with pneumococcal carriage compared with Fijians of Indian Descent, despite similar PCV10 coverage rates."

This survey was conducted among outpatients who were treated at the Gynecology Department of Peking University People’s Hospital between September 2016 and November 2016. All participants filled up the questionnaires and scales through WeChat: general information questionnaire, Pictorial Blood Loss Assessment Chart (PBAC), Menorrhagia Multi-Attribute Quality-of-Life Scale (MMAS), and HMB knowledge questionnaire. Menstrual blood volume was assessed by the PBAC and self-assessment. Among the 1152 patients who filled out the survey, 77.4% (892/1152) had normal menstrual cycle (assessed by the patients), 15.6% (180/1152) patients described themselves as HMB, whereas the results from PBAC showed that 58.0% (668/1152) had HMB (PBAC ≥100). Among patients with PBAC ≥100, only 26.8% (179/668) patients reported HMB through self-assessment. Regarding its impact on daily life, the MMAS scores of HMB patients (PBAC ≥100) were significantly lower compared to those with normal blood loss (P<0.001). Regarding the awareness to HMB, 63.2% (728/1152) of the patients were not familiar with HMB. HMB is a common abnormal uterine bleeding and is frequently found among Chinese gynecology outpatients. HMB has major impacts on a woman’s quality of life, affecting both physical and emotional health domains. Since women generally have low levels of awareness and understanding of HMB, they could assess their blood loss using the PBAC, which they can forward to their health care provider using a mobile phone or tablet and the WeChat platform. This tool may be effortlessly used by the health care providers and patients to easily share HMB-related data."

In this light, deciphering those factors able to hamper or facilitate an active lifestyle is crucial in order to increase patients' adherence to physical activity. The purpose of this study was to explore barriers and motivations in a sample of female oncological patients, practising running using the ecological model and compare them with healthy controls. Focus group interviews were conducted at Verona University. Participants were 12 female cancer survivors and 7 matched healthy controls who had participated at ""Run for Science"" project. The interviews were transcribed verbatim and analyzed using content analysis. Transcripts were categorized according to the ecological model, identifying barriers and motivations as themes. About motivations, three sub-themes were included: personal, interpersonal and environmental/organizational factors. Regarding barriers, another sub-theme was recognized: community/policy factors. Compared to healthy controls, survivors expressed motivations and barriers specifically related to their oncological disease. Running was a challenge with their cancer and a hope to give to other patients. Main barriers were represented by treatment-related side effects, inexperienced trainers and external factors, e.g. delivery of incorrect information. Running programs dedicated to oncological patients should consider intrinsic obstacles, related to cancer and its treatment. The interventions should offer a personalized program performed by qualified trainers, together with a motivational approach able to improve participants' adherence to an active lifestyle."

ATX and LPA signaling have been incriminated in the pathogenesis of different chronic inflammatory diseases and various types of cancer. In this report, deregulated ATX and LPA levels were detected in the spinal cord and plasma of mice during the development of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). Among the different sources of ATX expression in the inflamed spinal cord, F4/80+ CD11b+ cells, mostly activated macrophages and microglia, were found to express ATX, further suggesting an autocrine role for ATX/LPA in their activation, an EAE hallmark. Accordingly, ATX genetic deletion from CD11b+ cells attenuated the severity of EAE, thus proposing a pathogenic role for the ATX/LPA axis in neuroinflammatory disorders."
https://openalex.org/W3015079117,"Conserving forests to provide ecosystem services and biodiversity will be a key environmental challenge as society strives to adapt to climate change. The ecosystem services and biodiversity that forests provide will be influenced by the behaviors of numerous individual private landowners as they alter their use of forests in response to climate change and any future carbon pricing policies that emerge. We evaluated the impact of forest landowners’ likely adaptation behaviors on potential habitat for 35 terrestrial, forest-dependent vertebrates across three U.S. Pacific states. In particular, we couple a previously estimated empirical-economic model of forest management with spatially explicit species’ range and habitat associations to quantify the effects of adaptation to climate change and carbon pricing on potential habitat for our focal species (amphibians, birds and mammals) drawn from state agency lists of species of conservation concern. We show that both climate change and carbon pricing policies would likely encourage adaptation away from currently prevalent coniferous forest types, such as Douglas-fir, largely through harvest and planting decisions. This would reduce potential habitat for a majority of the focal species we studied across all three vertebrate taxa. The total anticipated habitat loss for amphibians, birds and mammals considered species of state concern would exceed total habitat gained, and the net loss in habitat per decade would accelerate over time. Carbon payments to forest landowners likely would lead to unintended localized habitat losses especially in Douglas-fir dominant forest types, and encourage more hardwoods on private forest lands. Our study highlights potential tradeoffs that could arise from pricing one ecosystem service (e.g., carbon) while leaving others (e.g., wildlife habitat) unpriced. Our study demonstrates the importance of anticipating potential changes in ecosystem services and biodiversity resulting from forest landowners’ climate adaptation behavior and accounting for a broader set of environmental benefits and costs when designing policies to address climate change."
https://openalex.org/W3014471902,"Expanded CAG nucleotide repeats are the underlying genetic cause of at least 14 incurable diseases, including Huntington’s disease (HD). The toxicity associated with many CAG repeat expansions is thought to be due to the translation of the CAG repeat to create a polyQ protein, which forms toxic oligomers and aggregates. However, recent studies show that HD CAG repeats undergo a non-canonical form of translation called Repeat-associated non-AUG dependent (RAN) translation. RAN translation of the CAG sense and CUG anti-sense RNAs produces six distinct repeat peptides: polyalanine (polyAla, from both CAG and CUG repeats), polyserine (polySer), polyleucine (polyLeu), polycysteine (polyCys), and polyglutamine (polyGln). The toxic potential of individual CAG-derived RAN polypeptides is not well understood. We developed pure C. elegans protein models for each CAG RAN polypeptide using codon-varied expression constructs that preserve RAN protein sequence but eliminate repetitive CAG/CUG RNA. While all RAN polypeptides formed aggregates, only polyLeu was consistently toxic across multiple cell types. In GABAergic neurons, which exhibit significant neurodegeneration in HD patients, codon-varied (Leu)38, but not (Gln)38, caused substantial neurodegeneration and motility defects. Our studies provide the first in vivo evaluation of CAG-derived RAN polypeptides in a multicellular model organism and suggest that polyQ-independent mechanisms, such as RAN-translated polyLeu peptides, may have a significant pathological role in CAG repeat expansion disorders."

In this study, we investigated the role of systemic ADMA overburden in cerebromicrovascular pathology associated with cognitive dysfunction using APPSwDI transgenic mice expressing human β-amyloid precursor protein Swedish (Tg-SwDI), a model of cerebrovascular β-amyloidosis. To induce systemic overburden of ADMA, Tg-SwDI mice were treated with a daily dose of exogenous ADMA. ADMA treatment resulted in elevated ADMA levels in the blood and brain of Tg-SwDI mice. ADMA treatment induced the brain nitrosative stress and inflammation as well as enhanced the brain Aβ deposition and cognitive impairment in Tg-SwDI mice. However, ADMA treatment had no such effects on wild type mice. ADMA treatment also exacerbated brain microvascular pathology in Tg-SwDI mice as observed by increased blood-brain barrier dysfunction, loss of tight junction proteins, increased endothelial stress fibers, and decreased microvessel density in the brain. In addition, similar observations were made in cultured human brain microvessel endothelial cells, where ADMA in the presence of VEGF-induced endothelial cell signaling for F-actin stress fiber inducing endothelial barrier dysfunction. Overall, these data document the potential role of ADMA in the cognitive pathology under conditions of cerebrovascular β-amyloidosis."
https://openalex.org/W3014149625,"The poultry sector contributes four percent to the national GDP of Nepal. However, this sector is under threat with periodic outbreaks of Avian Influenza (AI) subtypes H5 and H9 since 2009. This has been both a public health threat and an economic issue. Since the past few years, outbreaks of AI subtype H9 have caused huge economic losses in major poultry producing areas of Nepal. However, the risk factors associated with these outbreaks have not been assessed. A retrospective case-control study was conducted from April 2018 to May 2019 to understand the risk factors associated with AI subtype H9 outbreaks in Kathmandu valley. Out of 100 farms selected, 50 were ""case"" farms, confirmed positive to H9 at Central Veterinary Laboratory, Kathmandu, and another 50 farms were ""control"" farms, matched for farm size and locality within a radius of three km from the case farm. Each farm was visited to collect information using a semi-structured questionnaire. Twelve potential risk factors were included in the questionnaire under the broad categories: birds and farm characteristics, and management and biosecurity status of the farms. Univariable and multivariable logistic regression analysis was conducted and corresponding odds ratios were calculated. Risk factors, associated with AI subtype H9 outbreaks in Kathmandu valley, identified in the final multivariable model were: ""farms that have flock size greater than median flock size of study farms (>1500)"" (OR = 4.41, 95% CI: 1.53-12.71, p = 0.006), ""farms that did not apply rules to wear boots for visitors inside the farms"" (OR = 4.32, 95% CI: 1.52-12.29, p = 0.006) and ""other commercial farms located within one km periphery"" (OR = 10, 95% CI: 1.8-50, p = 0.007). This study showed that outbreaks of AI subtype H9 in Kathmandu valley were associated with a higher population of birds in the farm, poor management practices, and weak biosecurity measures in poultry farms. We suggest improving management practices and increase biosecurity in the farms to reduce incidences of AI subtype H9 outbreaks in Kathmandu valley."
https://openalex.org/W3014854596,"For rodents, olfaction is essential for locating food, recognizing mates and competitors, avoiding predators, and navigating their environment. It is thought that rodents may have expanded olfactory receptor repertoires in order to specialize in olfactory behavior. Despite being the largest clade of mammals and depending on olfaction relatively little work has documented olfactory repertoires outside of conventional laboratory species. Here we report the olfactory receptor repertoire of the African giant pouched rat (Cricetomys ansorgei), a Muroid rodent distantly related to mice and rats. The African giant pouched rat is notable for its large cortex and olfactory bulbs relative to its body size compared to other sympatric rodents, which suggests anatomical elaboration of olfactory capabilities. We hypothesized that in addition to anatomical elaboration for olfaction, these pouched rats might also have an expanded olfactory receptor repertoire to enable their olfactory behavior. We examined the composition of the olfactory receptor repertoire to better understand how their sensory capabilities have evolved. We identified 1145 intact olfactory genes, and 260 additional pseudogenes within 301 subfamilies from the African giant pouched rat genome. This repertoire is similar to mice and rats in terms of size, pseudogene percentage and number of subfamilies. Analyses of olfactory receptor gene trees revealed that the pouched rat has 6 expansions in different subfamilies compared to mice, rats and squirrels. We identified 81 orthologous genes conserved among 4 rodent species and an additional 147 conserved genes within the Muroid rodents. The orthologous genes shared within Muroidea suggests that there may be a conserved Muroid-specific olfactory receptor repertoire. We also note that the description of this repertoire can serve as a complement to other studies of rodent olfaction, as the pouched rat is an outgroup within Muroidea. Thus, our data suggest that African giant pouched rats are capable of both natural and trained olfactory behaviors with a typical Muriod olfactory receptor repertoire."
https://openalex.org/W3014957730,"We previously have reported that neonatal Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) vaccination improves neurogenesis and behavior in early life through affecting the neuroimmune milieu in the brain, but it is uncertain whether activation phenotypes and functional changes in T lymphocytes shape brain development. Here, we studied the effects of BCG vaccination via the adoptive transfer of T lymphocytes from the BALB/c wild-type mice into naive mice. Our results show that mice adoptive BCG-induced lymphocytes (BCG->naive mice) showed anxiolytic and antidepressant-like performance when completing an elevated plus maze (EPM) test. Meanwhile, BCG->naive mice possess more cell proliferation and newborn neurons than PBS->naive and nude mice in the hippocampus. IFN-γ and IL-4 levels in the serum of BCG->naive mice also increased, while TNF-α and IL-1β levels were reduced relative to those of PBS->naive and nude mice. We further found that BCG->naive mice showed different repartition of CD4+ and CD8+ T cell to naive (CD62L+CD44low), effector memory (CD62L−CD44hi), central memory (CD62L+CD44hi) and acute/activated effector (CD62L−CD44low) cells in the spleen. Importantly, the adoptive transfer of BCG-induced T lymphocytes infiltrated into the dura mater and brain parenchyma of the nude mice. Activation phenotypes and functional changes in T lymphocytes are very likely to affect the neuroimmune milieu in the brain, and alterations in ratios of splenic CD4+ and CD8+ memory T cells may affect the expression of correlative cytokines in the serum, accounting for our behavioral results. We conclude thus that the adoptive transfer of BCG-induced T lymphocytes contributes to hippocampal cell proliferation and tempers anxiety-like behavior in immune deficient mice. Our work shows that BCG vaccination improves hippocampal cell proliferation outcomes and behaviors, likely as a result of splenic effector/memory T lymphocytes regulating the neuroimmune niche in the brain."
https://openalex.org/W3014781067,"Background This study aimed to characterize trends in absolute and relative socioeconomic inequalities in adult premature mortality between 1992 and 2017, in the context of declining population-wide mortality rates. We conducted a population-based cohort study of all adult premature deaths in Ontario, Canada using provincial vital statistics data linked to census-based, area-level deprivation indices for socioeconomic status. Methods The cohort included all individuals eligible for Ontario’s single-payer health insurance system at any time between January 1, 1992 and December 31, 2017 with a recorded Ontario place of residence and valid socioeconomic status information (N = 820,370). Deaths between ages 18 and 74 were used to calculate adult premature mortality rates per 1000, stratified by provincial quintile of material deprivation. Relative inequalities were measured using Relative Index of Inequality (RII) measures. Absolute inequalities were estimated using Slope Index of Inequality (SII) measures. All outcome measures were calculated as sex-specific, annual measures for each year from 1992 to 2017. Results Premature mortality rates declined in all socioeconomic groups between 1992 and 2017. Relative inequalities in premature mortality increased over the same period. Absolute inequalities were mostly stable between 1992 and 2007, but increased dramatically between 2008 and 2017, with larger increases to absolute inequalities seen in females than in males. Conclusions As in other developed countries, long-term downward trends in all-cause premature mortality in Ontario, Canada have shifted to a plateau pattern in recent years, especially in lower- socioeconomic status subpopulations. Determinants of this may differ by setting. Regular monitoring of mortality by socioeconomic status is the only way that this phenomenon can be detected sensitively and early, for public health attention and possible corrective action."
https://openalex.org/W3014342461,"Sexually dimorphic bone structure emerges largely during puberty. Sex steroids are critical for peak bone mass acquisition in both genders. In particular, the biphasic effects of estrogens mediate the skeletal sexual dimorphism. However, so far the stimulatory vs inhibitory actions of estrogens on bone mass are not fully explained by direct effects on bone cells. Recently, it has become evident that there is possible neuroendocrine action of estrogen receptor alpha (ERα) on the skeleton. Based on these considerations, we hypothesized that neuronal ERα-signaling may contribute to the skeletal growth during puberty. Here, we generated mice with tamoxifen-inducible Thy1-Cre mediated ERα inactivation during late puberty specifically in extrahypothalamic neurons (N-ERαKO). Inactivation of neuronal ERα did not alter the body weight in males, whereas N-ERαKO females exhibited a higher body weight and increased body and bone length compared to their control littermates at 16 weeks of age. Ex vivo microCT analysis showed increased radial bone expansion of the midshaft femur in female N-ERαKO along with higher serum levels of insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-1 as well as IGF-binding protein (IGFBP)-3. Furthermore, the 3-point bending test revealed increased bone strength in female N-ERαKO. In contrast, inactivation of neuronal ERα had no major effect on bone growth in males. In conclusion, we demonstrate that central ERα-signaling limits longitudinal bone growth and radial bone expansion specifically in females potentially by interacting with the GH/IGF-1 axis."

Arrestin-1 is also well-known to interact with additional protein partners and to affect other signaling cascades beyond phototransduction. In this study, we investigated one of these alternative arrestin-1 binding partners, the glycolysis enzyme enolase-1, to map the molecular contact sites between these two proteins and investigate how the binding of arrestin-1 affects the catalytic activity of enolase-1. Using fluorescence quench protection of strategically placed fluorophores on the arrestin-1 surface, we observed that arrestin-1 primarily engages enolase-1 along a surface that is opposite of the side of arrestin-1 that binds photoactivated rhodopsin. Using this information, we developed a molecular model of the arrestin-1–enolase-1 complex, which was validated by targeted substitutions of charge-pair interactions. Finally, we identified the likely source of arrestin's modulation of enolase-1 catalysis, showing that selective substitution of two amino acids in arrestin-1 can completely remove its effect on enolase-1 activity while still remaining bound to enolase-1. These findings open up opportunities for examining the functional effects of arrestin-1 on enolase-1 activity in photoreceptors and their surrounding cells."
https://openalex.org/W3014583316,"The temporal and spectral characteristics of tonic-clonic seizures are investigated using a neural field model of the corticothalamic system in the presence of a temporally varying connection strength between the cerebral cortex and thalamus. Increasing connection strength drives the system into ∼ 10 Hz seizure oscillations once a threshold is passed and a subcritical Hopf bifurcation occurs. In this study, the spectral and temporal characteristics of tonic-clonic seizures are explored as functions of the relevant properties of physiological connection strengths, such as maximum strength, time above threshold, and the ramp rate at which the strength increases or decreases. Analysis shows that the seizure onset time decreases with the maximum connection strength and time above threshold, but increases with the ramp rate. Seizure duration and offset time increase with maximum connection strength, time above threshold, and rate of change. Spectral analysis reveals that the power of nonlinear harmonics and the duration of the oscillations increase as the maximum connection strength and the time above threshold increase. A secondary limit cycle at ∼ 18 Hz, termed a saddle-cycle, is also seen during seizure onset and becomes more prominent and robust with increasing ramp rate. If the time above the threshold is too small, the system does not reach the 10 Hz limit cycle, and only exhibits 18 Hz saddle-cycle oscillations. It is also seen that the time to reach the saturated large amplitude limit-cycle seizure oscillation from both the instability threshold and from the end of the saddle-cycle oscillations is inversely proportional to the square root of the ramp rate."

On the other hand, due to the difference between real GDP growth rate and nominal lending rate, a cost push inflation is created. We compare the performance of our model to the Fisherian one by using Toda and Yamamoto approach of testing Granger Causality in the context of non-stationary data. We then use ARDL Bounds Testing approach to cross-check the results obtained from T-Y approach."
