Wnt and bone morphogenic protein (BMP) gradients drive this polarity, and colorectal cancer fundamentally reflects disruption of this homeostatic signaling. However, sub-epithelial sources of crucial agonists and antagonists that organize this BMP gradient remain obscure. Here, we couple whole-mount high-resolution microscopy with ensemble and single-cell RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) to identify three distinct PDGFRA+ mesenchymal cell types. PDGFRA(hi) telocytes are especially abundant at the villus base and provide a BMP reservoir, and we identified a CD81+ PDGFRA(lo) population present just below crypts that secretes the BMP antagonist Gremlin1. These cells, referred to as trophocytes, are sufficient to expand ISCs in vitro without additional trophic support and contribute to ISC maintenance in vivo. This study reveals intestinal mesenchymal structure at fine anatomic, molecular, and functional detail and the cellular basis for a signaling gradient necessary for tissue self-renewal.

This study reveals intestinal mesenchymal structure at fine anatomic, molecular, and functional detail and the cellular basis for a signaling gradient necessary for tissue self-renewal. Self-renewing tissues maintain a precise balance between stem and progenitor proliferation on the one hand and terminal differentiation on the other. Much attention now centers on tissue microenvironments that underlie this balance. The small intestine lends itself well to study niche structure and function, because Lgr5+ intestinal stem cells (ISCs) and transit-amplifying progenitors reside and replicate exclusively within crypts of Lieberkühn, while their post-mitotic progeny lie along contiguous villus structures (Clevers, 2013Clevers H.

At the crypt-villus junction, the transition between replicating and differentiated cells is abrupt, likely reflecting local signaling centers. ISC function and crypt cell proliferation depends on canonical Wnt ligands and their Rspondin (RSPO) co-factors (Kim et al., 2005Kim K.A. Kakitani M. Zhao J. Oshima T. Tang T. Binnerts M. Liu Y.

Forced BMP inhibitor (BMPi) expression in mouse intestines induces ectopic ISCs and crypts along villi (Batts et al., 2006Batts L.E. Polk D.B. Dubois R.N. Kulessa H.

Furthermore, mutations that activate Wnt signaling are obligate events in colorectal cancer (CRC) and inactivating SMAD4 and SMAD2 mutations, which override BMP differentiation activity, are also common somatic defects (Fearon and Vogelstein, 1990Fearon E.R.

Mutations that increase expression of the BMPi gene GREM1 underlie a familial polyposis syndrome with elevated CRC risk (Davis et al., 2015Davis H. Irshad S. Bansal M. Rafferty H. Boitsova T. Bardella C. Jaeger E. Lewis A. Freeman-Mills L. Giner F.C. et al.Aberrant epithelial GREM1 expression initiates colonic tumorigenesis from cells outside the stem cell niche.Nat.

Genet. 2012; 44: 699-703Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Thus, early intestinal tumorigenesis reflects liberation from physiologic constraints on Wnt and BMP signaling. In line with these physiologic signals, expansion of crypt epithelium or isolated ISCs into intestinal organoids requires recombinant (r) factors that activate Wnt and inhibit BMP signaling (Sato et al., 2009Sato T. Vries R.G. Snippert H.J. van de Wetering M. Barker N. Stange D.E. van Es J.H. Abo A. Kujala P. Peters P.J. Clevers H. Single Lgr5 stem cells build crypt-villus structures in vitro without a mesenchymal niche.Nature. 2009; 459: 262-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (4123) Google Scholar). Thus, homeostatic Wnt and BMP signals are accurately mirrored in intestinal tumors and organoid cultures. Cells at the crypt-villus junction must therefore encounter signals that inhibit mitosis and trigger terminal differentiation. Sub-epithelial mesenchyme is a principal source of deterministic signals (Farin et al., 2012Farin H.F. Van Es J.H. Clevers H.

The microenvironment is therefore classically depicted in terms of opposing gradients (Clevers, 2013Clevers H.

Myofibroblasts (MFs) are commonly regarded as a source of trophic factors (Powell et al., 2011Powell D.W. Pinchuk I.V. Saada J.I. Chen X. Mifflin R.C.

Recent studies implicate various mesenchymal cells as potential sources, including populations that express CD34, Foxl1, PDGFRA, or Gli1 (Aoki et al., 2016Aoki R. Shoshkes-Carmel M. Gao N. Shin S.

However, the overlap and heterogeneity among these cells and functions, their roles in generating physiologic gradients, and the cellular basis of crucial BMP signal polarity remain unknown. Using confocal microscopy of whole-mount intestinal tissue from wild-type and PdgfraH2BeGFP transgenic mice (Hamilton et al., 2003Hamilton T.G. Klinghoffer R.A. Corrin P.D. Soriano P.

Liver Physiol. 2013; 304: G823-G834Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), we examined the mesenchyme at high resolution. Coupled with ensemble and single-cell (sc) RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) of defined cell populations and unfractionated mesenchyme, this investigation identified likely sources of the physiologic BMP gradient: PDGFRAhi telocytes embedded in the basement membrane provide a reservoir of BMP ligands at the villus base, while a distinct pool of PDGFRAlo mesenchymal cells found exclusively beneath crypts expresses the surface protein CD81 and high RNA levels of the BMP inhibitor (BMPi) Grem1. Because the latter cells help sustain ISC in vivo and alone support ISC expansion into enteroid structures in vitro, in the absence of exogenous trophic Wnt/RSPO and BMPi factors, we call them trophocytes. Our findings thus reveal the functional architecture of an epithelial stem-cell niche, with two distinct and spatially polarized cell populations providing BMP ligands and antagonists at villus and crypt bases, respectively. Mesenchymal signals responsible for intestinal epithelial self-renewal were once thought to originate largely in smooth muscle actin (SMA or ACTA2)-expressing MFs (Powell et al., 2011Powell D.W.

We used whole-mount confocal microscopy (Bernier-Latmani et al., 2015Bernier-Latmani J. Cisarovsky C. Demir C.S. Bruand M. Jaquet M. Davanture S. Ragusa S. Siegert S. Dormond O.

Invest. 2015; 125: 4572-4586Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) to resolve cell populations in the mouse small intestine. CD31+ capillaries abutting the basement membrane provided landmarks in each villus lamina propria, feeding into large blood vessels in the muscularis (Figure S1A). Every capillary plexus had adjacent TUJ1+ neuronal processes and enveloped classical SMA+ MFs and LYVE1+ lacteal vessels (Figures S1A–S1D). PdgfraH2BeGFP knockin mice (Hamilton et al., 2003Hamilton T.G. Klinghoffer R.A. Corrin P.D. Soriano P.

All nuclei between the capillary plexus and intestinal epithelium gave high GFP signals and were embedded in the basal lamina (Figures S1F and S1G). These cells were distinct from GFPhi Purkinje-like neural cells in the muscularis (Kurahashi et al., 2012Kurahashi M. Nakano Y. Hennig G.W. Ward S.M. Sanders K.M.

Shoshkes-Carmel M. Gao N. Shin S. May C.L. Golson M.L. Zahm A.M. Ray M. Wiser C.L. Wright C.V. Kaestner K.H. Foxl1-expressing mesenchymal cells constitute the intestinal stem cell niche.Cell. Mol.

Notably, telocyte distribution along the crypt-villus long axis is non-uniform. We did not detect enrichment in crypts, but found substantially higher cell density at the villus base and a second, lesser concentration at villus tips (Figures 1A, 1B, and S1J; Videos S1 and S2). This axial asymmetry was evident throughout the small intestine, implying that along the crypt-villus axis, secreted telocyte products concentrate at these levels. eyJraWQiOiI4ZjUxYWNhY2IzYjhiNjNlNzFlYmIzYWFmYTU5NmZmYyIsImFsZyI6IlJTMjU2In0.eyJzdWIiOiIyNjI0Y2NlNTJhMDYyY2YzMzg2YTI4MDBkNzgxNTE2OSIsImtpZCI6IjhmNTFhY2FjYjNiOGI2M2U3MWViYjNhYWZhNTk2ZmZjIiwiZXhwIjoxNjc3NjIxNzcyfQ.Me6FrhYqsjCDDHxtJ46_up83KddJbhfPLOja033awvZMHITgFVO8xMAX89Ksqv_Z3N0LgRyufgVdjFPXDJOwdfnZnAyxoAl20tK2Fgd0rykIrHl1m85ixWaIqHXbZ1WaopdYhnadSCqxus4YV7kQKYk-NMvTyPKMgybwgxbfYQSIf5uDouqZ1CdtNTsnRHapD0qSknmv8UMKYoVAcDgd460VkpFfTKACavlILhqXUHC--ozoDn-AjuFnrNDD0eR1B4LjC81QDt57OS2oGV7R8rN2UUOSLppxoSZxDk-Re49ScDuXSzT0VhkI-MTfGQuLfcUvSN9e5x-6lQ5MDq_jng Download .mp4 (3.04 MB) Help with .mp4 files Video 1.

Telocytes Concentrate at the Crypt-Villus Junction, Related to Figures 1and S1 Stacked whole-mount confocal images from a PdgfraH2BeGFP mouse intestine stained for CD31 (red), LYVE1 (yellow), and DAPI (blue). The direction is from image planes in the abluminal serosa toward the luminal surface. PdgfraH2BeGFP mice revealed a second population of cells with lower GFP signals. GFPlo cells in the lamina propria lie deep to the vascular plexus (Figure 1C-D), distinct from GFPhi telocytes. Even around crypts, GFPlo cells lie farther from the epithelium than telocytes (Figure 1E) and are plentiful between crypt bases and external muscle layers (Figure 1F). By immunostaining and flow cytometry, GFPlo cells express less PDGFRA than telocytes, outnumber the latter cells several-fold, and have an expansive cytoplasm (Figures 1E and 1G). GFPlo nuclei were not associated with SMA+ cytoplasm or peri-endothelial NG2+ cells (Figures S1K–S1O), indicating that PDGFRAlo cells are not MFs or pericytes. Together, these findings reveal stereotypical organization of intestinal mesenchyme, with telocytes, blood endothelium, pericytes, MFs, and lymphatic channels present at increasing distance from the mucosa. Judging by both microscopy and flow cytometry, distinctive PDGFRAlo cells represent approximately a quarter of the stroma and intersperse among MFs from villus tips into the deep sub-mucosa. Previous studies refer to PDGFRA+ sub-mucosal cells collectively as “myofibroblasts” and implicate telocytes and unfractionated PDGFRA+ cells as Wnt and RSPO sources, respectively (Aoki et al., 2016Aoki R.

To resolve cellular identities and function, first we stripped away the external muscle to eliminate GFPhi Purkinje-like cells (Figure S2A). Flow cytometry with PDGFRA antibody (Ab) detected a fraction of PDGFRA+ cells, especially PDGFRAhi (GFPhi) but discriminated the two populations less well than GFP (Figures 1G and S2B), which we used instead to purify these populations. Because endothelium supports other tissues (Ding et al., 2012Ding L. Saunders T.L. Enikolopov G. Morrison S.J.

Notably, PDGFRAlo cells and telocytes differ in expression of >2,400 genes (Figure 2B, q < 0.05, log2 fold-difference >1.5), verifying that they are distinct from one another.

In particular, PDGFRAlo cells express the canonical ligand Wnt2b and three Wnt-potentiating Rspo factors, while telocytes mainly express non-canonical Wnt4, Wnt5a, and Wnt5b ligands and less Rspo mRNA than PDGFRAlo cells; both cell types express Wnt inhibitors. Intestinal Wnt gradients are therefore not readily attributed to any cell type. In contrast, transcripts for BMP signaling were polarized, with multiple agonists present largely in telocytes. In other tissues, BMP2/7 and BMP4/7 heterodimers signal more potently than BMP2 or BMP4 homodimers (Aono et al., 1995Aono A. Hazama M. Notoya K. Taketomi S. Yamasaki H. Tsukuda R. Sasaki S.

https://openalex.org/W3007531339,"The mystery of general anesthesia is that it specifically suppresses consciousness by disrupting feedback signaling in the brain, even when feedforward signaling and basic neuronal function are left relatively unchanged. The mechanism for such selectiveness is unknown. Here we show that three different anesthetics have the same disruptive influence on signaling along apical dendrites in cortical layer 5 pyramidal neurons in mice. We found that optogenetic depolarization of the distal apical dendrites caused robust spiking at the cell body under awake conditions that was blocked by anesthesia. Moreover, we found that blocking metabotropic glutamate and cholinergic receptors had the same effect on apical dendrite decoupling as anesthesia or inactivation of the higher-order thalamus. If feedback signaling occurs predominantly through apical dendrites, the cellular mechanism we found would explain not only how anesthesia selectively blocks this signaling but also why conscious perception depends on both cortico-cortical and thalamo-cortical connectivity."
https://openalex.org/W3008445071,"Ablation of LGR5+ intestinal stem cells (ISCs) is associated with rapid restoration of the ISC compartment. Different intestinal crypt populations dedifferentiate to provide new ISCs, but the transcriptional and signaling trajectories that guide this process are unclear, and a large body of work suggests that quiescent ""reserve"" ISCs contribute to regeneration. By timing the interval between LGR5+ lineage tracing and lethal injury, we show that ISC regeneration is explained nearly completely by dedifferentiation, with contributions from absorptive and secretory progenitors. The ISC-restricted transcription factor ASCL2 confers measurable competitive advantage to resting ISCs and is essential to restore the ISC compartment. Regenerating cells re-express Ascl2 days before Lgr5, and single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) analyses reveal transcriptional paths underlying dedifferentiation. ASCL2 target genes include the interleukin-11 (IL-11) receptor Il11ra1, and recombinant IL-11 enhances crypt cell regenerative potential. These findings reveal cell dedifferentiation as the principal means for ISC restoration and highlight an ASCL2-regulated signal that enables this adaptive response."

ABE holds promise for clinical application, as it does not depend on the introduction of double-strand breaks, contrary to conventional CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genome engineering. Here, we describe a cystic fibrosis (CF) intestinal organoid biobank, representing 664 patients, of which ~20% can theoretically be repaired by ABE. We apply SpCas9-ABE (PAM recognition sequence: NGG) and xCas9-ABE (PAM recognition sequence: NGN) on four selected CF organoid samples. Genetic and functional repair was obtained in all four cases, while whole-genome sequencing (WGS) of corrected lines of two patients did not detect off-target mutations. These observations exemplify the value of large, patient-derived organoid biobanks representing hereditary disease and indicate that ABE may be safely applied in human cells."
https://openalex.org/W3007960376,"Summary Consumption of glucosinolates, pro-drug-like metabolites abundant in Brassica vegetables, has been associated with decreased risk of certain cancers. Gut microbiota have the ability to metabolize glucosinolates, generating chemopreventive isothiocyanates. Here, we identify a genetic and biochemical basis for activation of glucosinolates to isothiocyanates by Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, a prominent gut commensal species. Using a genome-wide transposon insertion screen, we identified an operon required for glucosinolate metabolism in B. thetaiotaomicron. Expression of BT2159-BT2156 in a non-metabolizing relative, Bacteroides fragilis, resulted in gain of glucosinolate metabolism. We show that isothiocyanate formation requires the action of BT2158 and either BT2156 or BT2157 in vitro. Monocolonization of mice with mutant BtΔ2157 showed reduced isothiocyanate production in the gastrointestinal tract. These data provide insight into the mechanisms by which a common gut bacterium processes an important dietary nutrient."
https://openalex.org/W3008097087,"Introduction To address the know-do gap in the integration of mental health care into primary care in resource-limited settings, a multi-faceted implementation program initially designed to integrate HIV/AIDS care into primary care was adapted for severe mental disorders and epilepsy in Burera District, Rwanda. The Mentoring and Enhanced Supervision at Health Centers (MESH MH) program supported primary care-delivered mental health service delivery scale-up from 6 to 19 government-run health centers over two years. This quasi-experimental study assessed implementation reach, fidelity, and clinical outcomes at health centers supported by MESH MH during the scale up period. Methods MESH MH consisted of four strategies to ensure the delivery of the priority care packages at health centers: training; supervision and mentorship; audit and feedback; and systems-based quality improvement (QI). Implementation reach (service use) across the 19 health centers supported by MESH MH during the two year scale-up period was described using routine service data. Implementation fidelity was measured at four select health centers by comparing total clinical supervisory visits and checklists to target goals, and by tracking clinical observation checklist item completion rates over a nine month period. A prospective before and after evaluation measured clinical outcomes in consecutive adults presenting to four select health centers over a nine month period. Primary outcome assessments at baseline, 2 and 6 months included symptoms and functioning, measured by the General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12) and the World Health Organization Disability Assessment Scale (WHO-DAS Brief), respectively. Secondary outcome assessments included engagement in income generating work and caregiver burden using a quantitative scale adapted to context. Results A total of 2239 mental health service users completed 15,744 visits during the scale up period. MESH MH facilitated 70% and 76% of supervisory visit and clinical checklist utilization target goals, respectively. Checklist item completion rates significantly improved overall, and for three of five checklist item subgroups examined. 121 of 146 consecutive service users completed outcome measurements six months after entry into care. Scores improved significantly over six months on both the GHQ-12, with median score improving from 26 to 10 (mean within-person change 12.5 [95% CI: 10.9–14.0] p< 0.0001), and the WHO-DAS Brief, with median score improving from 26.5 to 7 (mean within-person change 16.9 [95% CI: 14.9–18.8] p< 0.0001). Over the same period, the percentage of surveyed service users reporting an inability to work decreased significantly (51% to 6% (p < 0.001)), and the proportion of households reporting that a caregiver had left income-generating work decreased significantly (41% to 4% (p < 0.001)). Conclusion MESH MH was associated with high service use, improvements in mental health care delivery by primary care nurses, and significant improvements in clinical symptoms and functional disability of service users receiving care at health centers supported by the program. Multifaceted implementation programs such as MESH MH can reduce the evidence to practice gap for mental health care delivery by nonspecialists in resource-limited settings. The primary limitation of this study is the lack of a control condition, consistent with the implementation science approach of the study. Study registration ISRCTN #37231."

This study is aimed to investigate the crosstalk between MDSCs and oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) cells and their role in the malignant progression of OSCC.Immunochemistry (IHC) was used to investigate the expression of CD33 in 200 OSCC, 36 premalignant. CD33+ MDSCs were sorted and enriched via magnetic-activated cell sorting (MACS) from OSCC patients or health donor, and their phenotypes were identified by flow cytometry. With a co-culture system of MDSCs and OSCC, the effects of MDSCs on OSCC proliferation, apoptosis, migration invasion, epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), and vasculogenic mimicry formation (VM) formation were assessed, respectively. Besides, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from health donor were cultured with OSCC supernatant, the level of MDSCs and expressions of Arginase (Arg-1) and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) were measured.The number of MDSCs was increased in tumor tissues of OSCC patients, and was positively related to the T stage, pathological grade, lymph node metastasis and poor prognosis. Tumor-related MDSCs of the co-culture system promoted OSCC progression by contributing to cell proliferation, migration and invasion as well as inducing EMT and VM. In turn, OSCC cells had potential to induce MDSCs differentiation from PBMCs and increase the expression of Arg-1 and iNOS.These indicated that the crosstalk between MDSCs and tumor cells facilitated the malignant progression of OSCC cells and the immune suppressive properties of MDSCs, which may provide new insights into tumor treatment on targeting tumor-associated immunosuppressive cells."
https://openalex.org/W3006794603,"The integration of metallic or ceramic nanoparticles in polymer matrices has improved the antimicrobial and antifungal behavior, resulting in the search for composites with increased bactericidal and antimycotic properties. A polycaprolactone fibers with copper oxide nanoparticles was prepared. Polycaprolactone-copper fibers (PCL- CuONPs) were prepared into two major steps in situ method: (a) Synthesis of CuO particles, then (b) incorporation of polycaprolactone to electrospun process. The first step is the reduction of Cu+2 ions by gallic acid in N,N-dimethylformamide and tetrahydrofuran solution with the simple addition of polycaprolactone in the solution for the second electrospun step. Raman spectra provide information about the nature of the copper oxide synthesized. There are three Raman peaks in the sample, at 294 and 581 cm-1 and a very broad band from 400 to 600 cm-1 which are characteristics bands for CuO. Scanning electron microscopy (TEM) revealed copper oxide nanoparticles with semispherical shapes with diameter 35 ±11 nm. Dynamic light scattering (DLS) analysis showed uniform CuONPs in a range of 88±11 nm. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) of PCL-CuONps reveled fibers with diameters ranging from 925 to 1080 nm were successfully obtained by electrospinning technique. Orientation, morphology and diameter were influenced by the increment on CuONPs concentration, with the smaller diameter present in samples prepared from low concentrated solutions. The antimycotic applicability of the composite was evaluated to determine the antifungal activity in three species of the genus Candida (Candida albicans, Candida glabrata and Candida tropicalis). PCL-CuONPs exhibit a considerable antifungal effect on all species tested. The preparation of PCL-CuONPs was simple, fast and low-cost for practical application as an antifungal dressing."

C57BL/6J mice were fed with HFD or standard diet (SD) for 1, 2, or 8 weeks. Colonic interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6, and malondialdehyde (MDA) levels were measured. Expression of occludin in colonic tissues was examined by western blot. Substance P (SP), S100β, GFAP, and phosphorylated mitogen-activated protein kinase 1 (pERK) were assessed in whole mount specimens of colonic plexus by immunohistochemistry. Colonic tachykininergic contractions, elicited by electrical stimulation or exogenous SP, were recorded in the presence or absence of fluorocitrate (FC). To mimic exposure to HFD, cultured EGCs were incubated with palmitate (PA) and/or lipopolysaccharide (LPS). SP and IL-1β levels were assayed in the culture medium by ELISA. HFD mice displayed an increase in colonic IL-1β and MDA, and a reduction of occludin at week 2. These changes occurred to a greater extent at week 8. In vitro electrically evoked tachykininergic contractions were enhanced in HFD mice after 2 or 8 weeks, and they were blunted by FC. Colonic IL-6 levels as well as substance P and S100β density in myenteric ganglia of HFD mice were increased at week 8, but not at week 1 or 2. In cultured EGCs, co-incubation with palmitate plus LPS led to a significant increase in both SP and IL-1β release. HFD-induced obesity is characterized by a hyperactivation of EGCs and is involved in the development of enteric motor disorders through an increase in tachykininergic activity and release of pro-inflammatory mediators."
https://openalex.org/W3007337192,"We tested the hypothesis that the P2X4 purinergic receptor (P2X4) exacerbates ischemic acute kidney injury (AKI) by promoting renal tubular inflammation after ischemia and reperfusion (IR). Supporting this, P2X4-deficient (KO) mice were protected against ischemic AKI with significantly attenuated renal tubular necrosis, inflammation, and apoptosis when compared to P2X4 wild-type (WT) mice subjected to renal IR. Furthermore, WT mice treated with P2X4 allosteric agonist ivermectin had exacerbated renal IR injury whereas P2X4 WT mice treated with a selective P2X4 antagonist (5-BDBD) were protected against ischemic AKI. Mechanistically, induction of kidney NLRP3 inflammasome signaling after renal IR was significantly attenuated in P2X4 KO mice. A P2 agonist ATPγS increased NLRP3 inflammasome signaling (NLRP3 and caspase 1 induction and IL-1β processing) in isolated renal proximal tubule cells from WT mice whereas these increases were absent in renal proximal tubules isolated from P2X4 KO mice. Moreover, 5-BDBD attenuated ATPγS induced NLRP3 inflammasome induction in renal proximal tubules from WT mice. Finally, P2X4 agonist ivermectin induced NLRP3 inflammasome and pro-inflammatory cytokines in cultured human proximal tubule cells. Taken together, our studies suggest that renal proximal tubular P2X4 activation exacerbates ischemic AKI and promotes NLRP3 inflammasome signaling."
https://openalex.org/W3007727422,"Yield gaps of maize (Zea mays L.) in the smallholder farms of eastern India are outcomes of a complex interplay of climatic variations, soil fertility gradients, socio-economic factors, and differential management intensities. Several machine learning approaches were used in this study to investigate the relative influences of multiple biophysical, socio-economic, and crop management features in determining maize yield variability using several machine learning approaches. Soil fertility status was assessed in 180 farms and paired with the surveyed data on maize yield, socio-economic conditions, and agronomic management. The C&RT relative variable importance plot identified farm size, total labor, soil factors, seed rate, fertilizer, and organic manure as influential factors. Among the three approaches compared for classifying maize yield, the artificial neural network (ANN) yielded the least (25%) misclassification on validation samples. The random forest partial dependence plots revealed a positive association between farm size and maize productivity. Nonlinear support vector machine boundary analysis for the eight top important variables revealed complex interactions underpinning maize yield response. Notably, farm size and total labor synergistically increased maize yield. Future research integrating these algorithms with empirical crop growth models and crop simulation models for ex-ante yield estimations could result in further improvement."

Signaling via the secreted protein norrin through the frizzled class receptor 4 (FZD4)/LDL receptor–related protein 5–6 (LRP5–6)/tetraspanin 12 (TSPAN12) receptor complex is required for developmental vascularization and BRB formation. Here, we tested the hypothesis that norrin restores BRB properties after VEGF-induced vascular permeability in diabetic rats or in animals intravitreally injected with cytokines. Intravitreal co-injection of norrin with VEGF completely ablated VEGF-induced BRB permeability to Evans Blue-albumin. Likewise, 5-month diabetic rats exhibited increased permeability of FITC-albumin, and a single norrin injection restored BRB properties. These results were corroborated in vitro, where co-stimulation of norrin with VEGF or stimulation of norrin after VEGF exposure restored barrier properties, indicated by electrical resistance or 70-kDa RITC-dextran permeability in primary endothelial cell culture. Interestingly, VEGF promoted norrin signaling by increasing the FZD4 co-receptor TSPAN12 at cell membranes in an MAPK/ERK kinase (MEK)/ERK-dependent manner. Norrin signaling through β-catenin was required for BRB restoration, but glycogen synthase kinase 3 α/β (GSK-3α/β) inhibition did not restore BRB properties. Moreover, levels of the tight junction protein claudin-5 were increased with norrin and VEGF or with VEGF alone, but both norrin and VEGF were required for enriched claudin-5 localization at the tight junction.

Importantly, these retinas show high retinal vascular permeability that correlates with reduced border immunostaining of the tight junction protein claudin-5 and increased expression of the transcytosis marker PLVAP, a phenotype that can be reversed by the expression of stabilized β-catenin (5Zhou Y.

Together, these data indicate a requirement of norrin signaling through β-catenin in deep capillary angiogenesis, BRB formation and maintenance. Loss of norrin or TSPAN12 in mouse retina reveals a phenotype that resembles some of the pathological features of diabetic retinopathy. Retinas from mice with norrin gene deletion showed formation of cystoid edema, neovascularization, and inflammation (37Beck S.C. Karlstetter M. Garcia Garrido M. Feng Y. Dannhausen K. Mühlfriedel R.

Nevertheless, the role of norrin signaling during diabetic retinopathy is not completely understood. The release of cytokines, including vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), contributes to the pathophysiology of diabetic retinopathy through the disruption of the BRB (40Frey T. Antonetti D.A. Alterations to the blood-retinal barrier in diabetes: cytokines and reactive oxygen species.Antioxid. Redox. Signal. 2011; 15 (21294655): 1271-128410.1089/ars.2011.3906Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). At a molecular level, it is known that VEGF signaling through protein kinase Cβ promotes occludin phosphorylation, which results in disorganization of the retinal endothelial tight junction complex and vascular dysfunction (41Murakami T. Felinski E.A. Antonetti D.A. Occludin phosphorylation and ubiquitination regulate tight junction trafficking and vascular endothelial growth factor-induced permeability.J. Biol.

However, limited studies have investigated restoration of the retinal endothelial barrier after VEGF-targeted disruption. The role of norrin signaling in BRB formation suggests that it may have the potential to restore BRB properties after induced retinal vascular permeability. Here, we demonstrate that VEGF and norrin interact in regulating barrier properties. VEGF induces permeability but simultaneously primes norrin signaling by promoting TSPAN12 co-receptor localization at the cell membrane. Subsequent norrin signaling promotes claudin-5 organization at the cell border and BRB restoration. This response is demonstrated in two in vivo models of BRB loss and in a cell culture model, thus supporting the potential of norrin as a therapeutic option to restore the BRB in diseases such as diabetic retinopathy. To determine the ability of norrin to counteract VEGF-induced BRB dysfunction, retinal permeability to Evans Blue dye was determined in rat retinas, 24 h after their intravitreal (IVT) injection with 40 ng of norrin or 50 ng of VEGF or with the co-injection of the two cytokines, VEGF/norrin. Control rats (vehicle-injected) showed an average of 2.5 μl/g/h of accumulated dye, and all conditions were normalized to this value. We have found that permeability in response to norrin injection was not different from control values, whereas, as expected, retinas injected with VEGF showed a significant increase in the accumulation of Evans Blue dye. Strikingly, the simultaneous injection of VEGF/norrin completely ablated the VEGF effect (Fig. 1A), thus indicating that norrin can inhibit VEGF-induced leakiness in the retina. To determine whether norrin is able to restore BRB properties, we also performed permeability assays in diabetic rats. After 5 months of STZ-induced diabetes, rats were treated with an IVT injection of vehicle in right eyes (OD) or 40 ng of norrin in left eyes (OS), and permeability was measured 24 h later by determining the retinal accumulation of intravenously injected FITC-BSA. Nondiabetic rats (control) injected with vehicle showed a 15.5-μl/g/h average of dye accumulation, and this was used for data normalization. Similar permeability to FITC-BSA was found in control rat eyes injected with norrin (Fig. 1B). Notably, diabetic rats had higher permeability of FITC-BSA, and this was completely restored to the control levels by norrin injection. Together, these results demonstrate the ability of norrin to restore BRB properties in two rat models of vascular dysfunction. We further corroborated norrin effect in a primary culture of BREC. Cells were grown until confluence for 24 h and BRB formation was induced for the next 48 h with medium supplemented with 1% serum and 100 mm hydrocortisone (Fig. 2A). Subsequently, BREC monolayers were stimulated with vehicle, 40 ng/ml norrin (N), 50 ng/ml VEGF (V), or norrin together with VEGF (VEGF/norrin), and real-time measurements of trans-endothelial electrical resistance (TEER) (Fig. 2B) or diffusive permeability of 70-kDa RITC-dextran (Fig. 2C) were determined. All monolayers reached TEER values above 3,500 ohms (Fig. 2A) before stimulation, and data were normalized to time 0 baseline for each sample. In dextran flux assays, control monolayers had an average diffusive permeability (Po) of 1.5 × 10−6, and all conditions were normalized to this control value. Our results show that VEGF induced a reduction of TEER of ˜40% of the control value from 24 to 72 h and a 2-fold increase in the permeability of 70-kDa RITC-dextran by 72 h, whereas basal levels were not affected by norrin stimulation. The addition of both VEGF/norrin simultaneously led to an initial loss of TEER over the first 24 h, followed by complete barrier restoration by 72 h and complete restoration of dextran flux to control values at 72 h. These results indicate that norrin restores BRB properties after 24 h of VEGF stimulation. To better understand the requirement of VEGF activation in norrin-induced BRB restoration, BREC monolayers were prestimulated with norrin and then with VEGF 24 h later (N + V) or prestimulated with VEGF and then norrin 24 h later (V + N). As shown in Fig. 2 (D and E), prestimulation with norrin failed to prevent the VEGF-induced permeability to dextran, although the effect on TEER appeared attenuated by 48–72 h with a reduction of only 15% of control. However, when norrin was added 24 h after the addition of VEGF, norrin promoted barrier restoration measured both by TEER and dextran permeability. This effect of norrin restoration after VEGF addition was demonstrated to be dose-responsive (Fig. 2F). Because 40 ng/ml was enough to recover BRB properties in vivo and in vitro, we choose 40 ng/ml norrin as a working concentration for all other experiments. Together, these results indicate that norrin is able to restore the endothelial barrier properties after VEGF-induced permeability. TEER results and dextran flux experiments indicate that norrin increases barrier properties only after VEGF stimulation, suggesting a requirement for VEGF signaling for norrin action in the endothelial cells. To evaluate this possibility, we determined whether VEGF regulates the expression of norrin receptor FZD4 or the LRP5 and TSPAN12 co-receptors. BREC monolayers were stimulated as indicated and qRT-PCR was performed to assess mRNA content. As shown in Fig. 3A, VEGF alone or norrin stimulation 24 h after VEGF (V + N), significantly increased TSPAN12 mRNA at 48 and 72 h, whereas FZD4 or LRP5 mRNA content was not significantly affected"

A population-based case-control study (242 CHD cases, 966 controls) was conducted using an iPad questionnaire for mother with linkage to maternity and first trimester prescription records. Risk of CHD was associated with low maternal education (OR adjusted for confounders 1.59; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.02–2.49), pregestational diabetes (OR 4.04; 95% CI 1.00–16.28), self-reported maternal clotting disorders (adjOR 8.55, 95%CI 1.51–48.44), prescriptions for the anticlotting medication enoxaparin (adjOR 3.22, 95%CI 1.01–10.22) and self-reported vaginal infections (adjOR 1.69, 95%CI 1.01–2.80). There was no strong support for the hypothesis that periconceptional folic acid supplements have a protective effect, but there was a protective effect of frequent consumption of folate rich fruits (adjOR 0.64, 95%CI 0.47–0.89). Compared to the most common pre-pregnancy dietary pattern, CHD risk was associated with a poor diet low in fruit and vegetables (adjOR 1.56, 95%CI 1.05–2.34). Mothers of cases reported more pregnancy related stress (adjOR 1.69; 95% CI 1.22–2.34) and multiple stressors (adjOR 1.94, 95%CI 0.83–4.53). We found no supportive evidence for CHD risk being associated with obesity, smoking, depression or antidepressant use in this population. Our findings add to the previous evidence base to show potential for public health approaches to help prevent CHD in future by modifying environmental factors. Independent confirmation should be sought regarding elevated CHD risk associated with maternal blood clotting disorders and their treatment, since we are the first to report this."

Wheat breeders would therefore benefit greatly from the identification and application of genetic markers associated with nitrogen use efficiency (NUE). To investigate the genetics underlying N response, two bi-parental mapping populations were developed and grown in four site-seasons under low and high N rates. The populations were derived from a cross between previously identified high NUE parents (VA05W-151 and VA09W-52) and a shared common low NUE parent, ‘Yorktown.’ The Yorktown × VA05W-151 population was comprised of 136 recombinant inbred lines while the Yorktown × VA09W-52 population was comprised of 138 doubled haploids. Phenotypic data was collected on parental lines and their progeny for 11 N-related traits and genotypes were sequenced using a genotyping-by-sequencing platform to detect more than 3,100 high quality single nucleotide polymorphisms in each population. A total of 130 quantitative trait loci (QTL) were detected on 20 chromosomes, six of which were associated with NUE and N-related traits in multiple testing environments. Two of the six QTL for NUE were associated with known photoperiod (Ppd-D1 on chromosome 2D) and disease resistance (FHB-4A) genes, two were reported in previous investigations, and one QTL, QNue.151-1D, was novel. The NUE QTL on 1D, 6A, 7A, and 7D had LOD scores ranging from 2.63 to 8.33 and explained up to 18.1% of the phenotypic variation. The QTL identified in this study have potential for marker-assisted breeding for NUE traits in soft red winter wheat."

The role of PDGFRα+ cells in sympathetic neural regulation of murine colonic motility was investigated. Norepinephrine (NE), via α1A ARs, activated a small conductance Ca2+ -activated K+ (SK) conductance, evoked outward currents and hyperpolarized PDGFRα+ cells (the α1A AR-SK channel signal pathway). α1 AR agonists increased intracellular Ca2+ transients in PDGFRα+ cells and inhibited spontaneous phasic contractions (SPCs) of colonic muscle through activation of a SK conductance. Sympathetic nerve stimulation inhibited both contractions of distal colon and propulsive contractions represented by the colonic migrating motor complexes (CMMCs) via the α1A AR-SK channel signal pathway. Postsynaptic signaling through α1A ARs in PDGFRα+ cells is a novel mechanism that conveys part of stress responses in the colon. PDGFRα+ cells appear to be a primary effector of sympathetic neural regulation of murine colonic motility."
https://openalex.org/W3007018195,"Heart muscle contractility and performance are controlled by posttranslational modifications of sarcomeric proteins. Although myosin regulatory light chain (RLC) phosphorylation has been studied extensively in vitro and in vivo, the precise role of cardiac myosin light chain kinase (cMLCK), the primary kinase acting upon RLC, in the regulation of cardiomyocyte contractility remains poorly understood. In this study, using recombinantly expressed and purified proteins, various analytical methods, in vitro and in situ kinase assays, and mechanical measurements in isolated ventricular trabeculae, we demonstrate that human cMLCK is not a dedicated kinase for RLC but can phosphorylate other sarcomeric proteins with well-characterized regulatory functions. We show that cMLCK specifically monophosphorylates Ser23 of human cardiac troponin I (cTnI) in isolation and in the trimeric troponin complex in vitro and in situ in the native environment of the muscle myofilament lattice. Moreover, we observed that human cMLCK phosphorylates rodent cTnI to a much smaller extent in vitro and in situ, suggesting species-specific adaptation of cMLCK. Although cMLCK treatment of ventricular trabeculae exchanged with rat or human troponin increased their cross-bridge kinetics, the increase in sensitivity of myofilaments to calcium was significantly blunted by human TnI, suggesting that human cTnI phosphorylation by cMLCK modifies the functional consequences of RLC phosphorylation. We propose that cMLCK-mediated phosphorylation of TnI is functionally significant and represents a critical signaling pathway that coordinates the regulatory states of thick and thin filaments in both physiological and potentially pathophysiological conditions of the heart. Heart muscle contractility and performance are controlled by posttranslational modifications of sarcomeric proteins. Although myosin regulatory light chain (RLC) phosphorylation has been studied extensively in vitro and in vivo, the precise role of cardiac myosin light chain kinase (cMLCK), the primary kinase acting upon RLC, in the regulation of cardiomyocyte contractility remains poorly understood. In this study, using recombinantly expressed and purified proteins, various analytical methods, in vitro and in situ kinase assays, and mechanical measurements in isolated ventricular trabeculae, we demonstrate that human cMLCK is not a dedicated kinase for RLC but can phosphorylate other sarcomeric proteins with well-characterized regulatory functions. We show that cMLCK specifically monophosphorylates Ser23 of human cardiac troponin I (cTnI) in isolation and in the trimeric troponin complex in vitro and in situ in the native environment of the muscle myofilament lattice. Moreover, we observed that human cMLCK phosphorylates rodent cTnI to a much smaller extent in vitro and in situ, suggesting species-specific adaptation of cMLCK. Although cMLCK treatment of ventricular trabeculae exchanged with rat or human troponin increased their cross-bridge kinetics, the increase in sensitivity of myofilaments to calcium was significantly blunted by human TnI, suggesting that human cTnI phosphorylation by cMLCK modifies the functional consequences of RLC phosphorylation. We propose that cMLCK-mediated phosphorylation of TnI is functionally significant and represents a critical signaling pathway that coordinates the regulatory states of thick and thin filaments in both physiological and potentially pathophysiological conditions of the heart. Cardiac muscle contraction is driven by the cyclic interactions of myosin and actin coupled to ATP hydrolysis. Calcium binding to troponin triggers activation of the actin-containing thin filament mediated by the azimuthal movement of tropomyosin on its surface, which allows myosin head domains from the neighboring myosin-containing thick filaments to strongly attach to available actin-binding sites. Subsequently, small conformational changes in the catalytic part of the myosin head domain, associated with the release of Pi, are amplified by the myosin light chain–containing “lever arm” or light chain domain, which results in nanometer-scale displacement of the thin filaments toward the center of the sarcomere or generation of piconewton-scale forces (1Gordon A.M. Homsher E. Regnier M. Regulation of contraction in striated muscle.Physiol. Rev. 2000; 80 (10747208): 853-92410.1152/physrev.2000.80.2.853Crossref PubMed Scopus (1239) Google Scholar). Heart muscle contractility and performance are also controlled by posttranslational modifications of sarcomeric proteins, including phosphorylation of the myosin regulatory light chain (RLC) 2The abbreviations used are: RLCregulatory light chaincMLCKcardiac myosin light chain kinasecTnIcardiac isoform of troponin INTEN-terminal extensionhcTnIhuman cTnIrcTnIrat cTnIcRLCcardiac isoform of myosin regulatory light chainESIelectron spray ionizationCMFcardiac myofibrilλPPλ protein phosphatasecMyBP-Ccardiac isoform of myosin-binding protein CCaMcalmodulinPKDprotein kinase DSECsize-exclusion chromatographyMALSmulti-angle light scatteringKPrpotassium propionateCrPNa2 creatine phosphateACNacetonitrile. by the cardiac isoform of myosin light chain kinase (cMLCK). RLC phosphorylation has been shown to be an important regulator of cardiac muscle function, with ablation of cMLCK or phosphorylation of RLC per se leading to cardiac muscle dysfunction and pathological hypertrophy in animal models (2Scruggs S.B.

However, cMLCK exhibits a unique N-terminal region with so far unknown structure and function, although sequence analysis revealed the presence of several putative phosphorylation sites for kinases known to regulate myofilament function, such as PKA and PKC (12Scruggs S.B. Solaro R.J. The significance of regulatory light chain phosphorylation in cardiac physiology.Arch. Biochem.

In the vertebrate heart, cMLCK is the principal kinase acting on RLC, and no other substrates have been identified to date, which led to the suggestion that cMLCK is a dedicated kinase with specific cellular functions (13Kamm K.E. Stull J.T. Dedicated myosin light chain kinases with diverse cellular functions.J. Biol.

Moreover, overexpression of cMLCK in isolated cardiomyocytes increases sarcomere organization, whereas its knockdown results in sarcomere disassembly via so far uncharacterized mechanisms (11Seguchi O.

The clinical significance of cMLCK is highlighted by the fact that mutations in the gene encoding for cMLCK (MLYK3) have been associated with development of dilated cardiomyopathy in humans (15Tobita T.

Briggs L.E. Zeng H. Chuang J. Chang E.I. Terada R. Li M. Swanson M.S. Lecker S.H. Willis M.S. Spinale F.G. Maupin-Furlowe J. McMullen J.R. Moss R.L. Kasahara H. Myosin light chain phosphorylation is critical for adaptation to cardiac stress.Circulation. 2012; 126 (23095280): 2575-258810.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.112.116202Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). In contrast, increasing RLC phosphorylation prevents development of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy-associated heart failure (18Yuan C.C. Muthu P. Kazmierczak K. Liang J. Huang W. Irving T.C.

However, the exact role of cMLCK in cardiomyocyte contractile regulation and sarcomere organization remains to be established. In this study, we show that cMLCK is not a dedicated kinase and, in fact, phosphorylates human cardiac troponin I, an important regulator of myofilament calcium sensitivity and relaxation kinetics. We show that cMLCK specifically monophosphorylates human cTnI on serine 23 in vitro in isolated protein preparations and in situ in the native environment of the muscle lattice. Moreover, cTnI phosphorylation by cMLCK is species-specific, and cMLCK does not phosphorylate cTnI in rodent muscle because of sequence variations around the phosphorylatable serine residue. We also show that the functional consequences of cMLCK activation differ significantly in the presence of either human or rodent troponin, which, in the case of the former, modifies the functional effects of RLC phosphorylation observed previously in isolated cardiac fibers from rodent hearts (7Kampourakis T. Sun Y.B. Irving M. Myosin light chain phosphorylation enhances contraction of heart muscle via structural changes in both thick and thin filaments.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2016; 113 (27162358): E3039-E304710.1073/pnas.1602776113Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Our results provide new mechanistic insights into the regulation of cardiac muscle contractility by cMLCK and its species-specific differences. We compared the primary sequence of known myofilament phosphoproteins from different species with the cMLCK consensus sequence in RLC and identified serines 22/23 in the cardiac specific N-terminal extension (NTE) of human cardiac troponin I (hcTnI) as potential substrates (Fig. 1A, red). In contrast, rodent cardiac troponin I differs considerably in its primary sequence surrounding the phosphorylatable serines 22/23 in its NTE, suggesting that rodent (including rat and mouse) cTnI might not be a substrate for cMLCK. The phosphorylatable serines 22/23 are followed by an asparagine residue (P+1 position) in human cTnI (Fig. 1A), which is similar to the consensus sequence found in rodent and human cardiac RLC. In contrast, in rodent cTnI, the phosphorylatable serines are followed by an alanine in the P+1 and an asparagine in the P+2 position (Fig. 1A), which might interfere with substrate recognition by cMLCK. To test this hypothesis, we used recombinant human or rat cardiac troponin complex as substrates in cMLCK in vitro kinase assays and analyzed their phosphorylation profiles by Phos-tagTM SDS-PAGE. As shown in Fig. 1B, cMLCK specifically phosphorylated hcTnI to ˜0.6 mol Pi/mol cTnI within 30 min of incubation. No phosphorylation of cardiac troponin T or C was observed under the same conditions, suggesting that cMLCK has a high specificity toward hcTnI in vitro. In contrast, rat cardiac troponin I (rcTnI) was phosphorylated to less than 0.02 mol Pi/mol cTnI under the same conditions, suggesting that it is a poor substrate for cMLCK in vitro. Note that unphosphorylated rat cTnT and cTnI migrate faster and slower in SDS-PAGE, respectively, than the corresponding human proteins. Prolonged incubation of both troponin complexes for more than 60 min resulted in almost complete monophosphorylation of hcTnI (>0.9 mol Pi/mol cTnI) but less than 0.15 mol Pi/mol cTnI phosphate incorporation for the rat troponin complex (Fig. 1C). In contrast to cTnI, cMLCK monophosphorylates isolated human and rat cRLC under the same conditions, with a similar time course to ˜1 mol Pi/mol cRLC within 60 min (10Kampourakis T. Irving M. Phosphorylation of myosin regulatory light chain controls myosin head conformation in cardiac muscle.J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 2015; 85 (26057075): 199-20610.1016/j.yjmcc.2015.06.002Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Next we tested the specificity of cMLCK for hcTnI by incubating human cardiac troponin complex with increasing concentrations of cMLCK (i.e. from 1:100 to 1:5 enzyme:substrate ratio) for 1 h and analyzed the phosphorylation profiles of cardiac troponin T, C, and I by Phos-tagTM SDS-PAGE and electron spray ionization (ESI) MS (Fig. 1, D and E, and Table S1). Only hcTnI was specifically monophosphorylated to ˜1 mol Pi/mol cTnI under all conditions tested, supporting the hypothesis that cMLCK specifically phosphorylates a single residue in cTnI, i.e. either serine 22 or 23. We confirmed this result by phosphorylating isolated hcTnI with cMLCK (Fig. 1F), followed by Phos-tagTM SDS-PAGE and Western blotting using a cTnI pSer22/pSer23-specific antibody (Fig. 1G). The phosphospecific antibody clearly recognized the monophosphorylated species, supporting the above conclusion that Ser22, Ser23, or both are substrates for cMLCK in vitro. To identify the phosphorylated serine residue, we incubated isolated WT hcTnI or hcTnI with Ser22 or Ser23 substituted by alanine with Ca2+/calmodulin-activated cMLCK (Fig. 1H). Only WT and S22A-substituted cTnI were phosphorylated by cMLCK, localizing the phosphorylation site to Ser23, in good agreement with the sequence similarity to RLC (Fig. 1A). A minor bis-phosphorylated human cardiac troponin I species was observed when the protein was used in isolation in kinase assays (Fig. 1, F and H), suggesting that cMLCK phosphorylated a secondary unspecific site that is, however, not accessible in the trimeric troponin complex. A sequence alignment of the N-terminal extension of cTnI from different species revealed that the P+1 position is an asparagine in all Old and New World primate species and humans (Fig. S2) and an alanine in other vertebrates, suggesting that cTnI phosphorylation by cMLCK might be a specific evolutionary adaptation. Next we confirmed the results for the isolated proteins described above in experiments with isolated cardiac myofibrils (CMFs), in which intact thin and thick filaments are organized into the native myofilament lattice. CMFs isolated from rat ventricular tissue were pretreated with λ protein phosphatase (λPP) to homogenously reduce protein phosphorylation levels. λPP treatment resulted in efficient dephosphorylation of cRLC, cTnI, cardiac troponin T, desmin, and cMyBP-C, as assessed by SDS-PAGE and Pro-Q Diamond phospho-protein staining (Fig. S3). Myofibrillar proteins after λPP treatment or sequential treatment with λPP followed by incubation with Ca2+/CaM/cMLCK for 1 h were separated by SDS-PAGE, and phosphorylated proteins were identified by phospho-protein staining with Pro-Q Diamond and total protein staining with Coomassie or SYPRO Ruby. As described previously (7Kampourakis T. Sun Y.B. Irving M. Myosin light chain phosphorylation enhances contraction of heart muscle via structural changes in both thick and thin filaments.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2016; 113 (27162358): E3039-E304710.1073/pnas.1602776113Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), cMLCK specifically phosphorylated an abundant rat myofilament protein with an apparent molecular mass of ˜18 kDa (Fig. 2A, gray arrowhead), in good agreement with the calculated mass of cRLC. An additional band in the Pro-Q staining with an apparent molecular mass of ˜37 kDa (Fig. 2A, black arrowhead) corresponds to cMLCK, which is endogenously phosphorylated (10Kampourakis T. Irving M. Phosphorylation of myosin regulatory light chain controls myosin head conformation in cardiac muscle.J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 2015; 85 (26057075): 199-20610.1016/j.yjmcc.2015.06.002Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). We confirmed cRLC phosphorylation in treated rat CMFs by Phos-tagTM SDS-PAGE and Western blot against cRLC (Fig. 2A, right). As expected, cRLC was highly phosphorylated after cMLCK treatment (˜0.7 mol Pi/mol cRLC). In contrast, Phos-tagTM Western blotting against cTnI with the same samples showed that, although λPP treatment resulted in efficient dephosphorylation of cTnI, the rat variant was not phosphorylated by cMLCK in situ. We repeated the in situ phosphorylation experiments in CMFs prepared from marmosets (Callithrix jacchus) and human left ventricles, which exhibit a significantly higher cTnI primary sequence identity (˜92% rat versus human cTnI and ˜96% marmoset versus human cTnI; Fig. S2), including an asparagine in the P+1 position following serine 23 in the NTE. Pro-Q phosphoprotein staining of λPP/cMLCK-treated marmoset and human CMFs showed three bands with apparent molecular masses of ˜18, ˜24. and ˜37 kDa (Fig. 2, B and C, gray, white, and black arrowheads, respectively), consistent with the expected molecular masses of cRLC, cTnI, and cMLCK, respectively. As before, we used Phos-tagTM SDS-PAGE and Western blotting to confirm that cRLCs in both sets of CMFs were phosphorylated after cMLCK treatment (˜0.8 mol Pi/mol cRLC). However, in contrast to rat CMF, cTnI was phosphorylated in the same samples to about 0.3–0.6 mol Pi/mol cTnI (Fig. 2B, right), confirming that cMLCK phosphorylates native marmoset and human cTnI in the myofilament lattice in situ. Specific phosphorylation of marmoset and human cTnI at serine 23 in situ was further confirmed by Western blotting using a pSer22/pSer23-specific antibody (Fig. S4A). Incubation of human CMFs with smooth muscle MLCK did not result in phosphorylation of cTnI, suggesting that phosphorylation of cTnI is specific to the cardiac isoform of MLCK (Fig. 2D). To assess the functional consequences of hcTnI phosphorylation by cMLCK, we exchanged unphosphorylated rat or human cardiac troponin complex into demembranated rat right ventricular trabeculae with a roughly 70% exchange efficiency (Fig. 3A). Endogenous cTnI in demembranated ventricular trabeculae is highly phosphorylated because of residual kinase activity in the quiescent preparations (Fig. 3B), and overnight exchange with the unphosphorylated recombinant troponins reduced cTnI phosphorylation from ˜1.8 mol Pi/mol cTnI to ˜0.9 mol Pi/mol cTnI in both groups (Fig. 3, C and D). As described previously, the level of RLC phosphorylation was low in demembranated trabeculae (<0.05 mol Pi/mol RLC) (10Kampourakis T. Irving M. Phosphorylation of myosin regulatory light chain controls myosin head conformation in cardiac muscle.J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 2015; 85 (26057075): 199-20610.1016/j.yjmcc.2015.06.002Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), and recombinant troponin exchange had no further effect (Fig. 3, C and D, bottom). Incubation in activating solution (pCa 4.5) containing 25 μmol/liter blebbistatin and 1 μmol/liter cMLCK/CaM had no effect on the cTnI phosphorylation level of rat troponin-exchanged trabeculae but significantly increased cTnI phosphorylation in the presence of human cardiac troponin to ˜1.3 mol Pi/mol cTnI (Fig. 3, D and E, top). In contrast, RLC was highly phosphorylated in both groups of trabeculae after cMLCK treatment (Fig. 3, D and E, bottom). In summary, these results show that cMLCK phosphorylates hcTnI in situ in the native environment of the myofilament lattice. The functional consequences of hcTnI phosphorylation by cMLCK were assessed by measuring the calcium sensitivity and cross-bridge kinetics of troponin-exchanged ventricular trabeculae before and after incubation with cMLCK/Ca2+/CaM. However, exchange of ˜70% endogenous with recombinant troponin had only a moderate effect on the cTnI phosphorylation level observed after exchange, with about 30% still present as the monophosphorylated and 30% as the bis-phosphorylated form (Fig. 3, C and D), suggesting that recombinant unphosphorylated cTnI was partially phosphorylated during the protein exchange by kinases still present in the freshly prepared ventricular trabeculae (Fig. 3B). Because of the high basal level of phosphorylation, the effects of kinase treatment on cTnI phosphorylation and myofilament function could not be unambiguously interpreted. We therefore employed an additional dephosphorylation step, using λPP as described previously for mouse ventricular trabeculae (19Martin-Garrido A. Biesiadecki B.J. Salhi H.E. Shaifta Y. Dos Remedios C.G. Ayaz-Guner S. Cai W. Ge Y. Avkiran M. Kentish J.C. Monophosphorylation of cardiac troponin-I at Ser-23/24 is sufficient to regulate cardiac myofibrillar Ca2+ sensitivity and calpain-induced proteolysis.J. Biol.

First we tested the effects of λPP treatment on cardiac muscle mechanics. Incubation of rat ventricular trabeculae with λPP increased the calcium sensitivity of force, as indexed by an increase in pCa50 from 5.81 ± 0.01 to 5.94 ± 0.01 (means ± S.E., n = 4), but decreased the steepness of the force–calcium relation (nH of 7.47 ± 0.56 versus 4.56 ± 0.37, mean ± S.E., n = 4) (Fig. 4A). Moreover, λPP treatment decreased the rate of force redevelopment at intermediate and high levels of activation (Fig. 4, B and C) but had little or no effect on passive or maximal calcium-activated isometric force. After the experiments, trabeculae were dismounted and dissolved in SDS-PAGE loading buffer, and cTnI phosphorylation levels were determined by Phos-tagTM SDS-PAGE followed by Western blotting against cTnI (Fig. 4D). Trabeculae from the same hearts that did not undergo λPP treatment were used as negative controls. As before, endogenous cTnI phosphorylation levels in untreated control trabeculae were high (˜1.8 mol Pi/mol cTnI), and incubation with λPP efficiently reduced cTnI phosphorylation to less than 0.1 mol Pi/mol cTnI, in good agreement with the CMF experiments described above. λPP treatment also resulted in efficient dephosphorylation of cMyBP-C, which was confirmed by Western blotting using a phospho-specific antibody (Fig. S4B). Comparison of the protein phosphorylation levels with the functional effects suggests that λPP treatment increases calcium sensitivity and decreases cross-bridge kinetics of ventricular trabeculae via dephosphorylation of cTnI and cMyBP-C, respectively. Therefore, to achieve a homogeneously low cTnI phosphorylation level, we first exchanged trabeculae overnight with unphosphorylated human or rat cardiac troponin, followed by λPP treatment directly before the mechanical experiments and subsequent incubation with Ca2+/CaM/cMLCK. Incubation of rat cTn-exchanged and λPP-dephosphorylated trabeculae with Ca2+/CaM-activated cMLCK increased the calcium sensitivity of force by 0.07 ± 0.01 pCa (mean ± S.E., n = 5) (Fig. 5A, Tables S1 and S2) but had no effect on the steepness of the force calcium relation (nH of 4.76 ± 0.46 versus 4.44 ± 0.42, mean ± S.E.), in good agreement with results obtained previously from native rat ventricular trabeculae (7Kampourakis T.

This result suggests that cTn exchange and dephosphorylation with λPP did not affect the physiological response of trabeculae to RLC phosphorylation by cMLCK. In contrast, the increase in calcium sensitivity after cMLCK treatment was strongly reduced in trabeculae exchanged with human cardiac troponin to 0.02 ± 0.01 pCa (mean ± S.E., n = 5) (Fig. 5, B and C, and Table S1), suggesting that hcTnI phosphorylation by cMLCK in the same preparations mitigated the increase in calcium sensitivity associated with phosphorylation of cRLC. Moreover, cMLCK treatment reduced the steepness of the force calcium relation from nH 5.51 ± 0.19 to 4.11 ± 0.25 (means ± S.E., n = 5) in the presence of human cTn. cMLCK treatment slightly increased passive and active force of human and rat cTn-exchanged trabeculae.

Several mutations in the genes encoding members of this protein family are associated with cancer and result in aberrant activation of signaling processes caused by a deregulated recruitment of downstream effector proteins. In this study, we engineered variants of the Ras-binding domain (RBD) of the C-Raf proto-oncogene, Ser/Thr kinase (CRAF). These variants bound with high affinity with the effector-binding site of Ras in an active conformation. Structural characterization disclosed how the newly identified RBD mutations cooperate and thereby enhance affinity with the effector-binding site in Ras compared with WT RBD. The engineered RBD variants closely mimicked the interaction mode of naturally occurring Ras effectors and acted as dominant-negative affinity reagents that block Ras signal transduction. Experiments with cancer cells showed that expression of these RBD variants inhibits Ras signaling, reducing cell growth and inducing apoptosis. Using these optimized RBD variants, we stratified patient-derived colorectal cancer organoids with known Ras mutational status according to their response to Ras inhibition. These results revealed that the presence of Ras mutations was insufficient to predict sensitivity to Ras inhibition, suggesting that not all of these tumors required Ras signaling for proliferation.

In summary, by engineering the Ras/Raf interface of the CRAF-RBD, we identified potent and selective inhibitors of Ras in its active conformation that outcompete binding of Ras-signaling effectors. The small GTPases HRAS, KRAS, and NRAS are molecular switches that relay signals from growth factor receptor tyrosine kinases to transcription factors and other intracellular mediators to affect the growth, proliferation, and survival of cells. To achieve this function, the conformation of Ras GTPases cycles between an inactive, GDP-bound state and an active, GTP-bound state that interacts with downstream effector proteins. Along this reaction cycle, the weak hydrolysis activity of Ras is enhanced by GTPase-activating proteins, and guanine exchange factors facilitate the discharge of GDP and the reloading with GTP. In cancer, mutations in members of the Ras family shift the fine-tuned equilibrium of this reaction cycle toward the active, GTP-bound state, leading to a constitutive activation of downstream kinases. The resulting uncoupling of the regulatory link between proliferation and upstream receptor signaling leads to uncontrolled growth and proliferation. Thus, mutated Ras GTPases are oncogenic drivers in various malignancies, making them, and their downstream effector kinases, a major focus for the development of antiproliferative drugs. When in active conformation, Ras GTPases propagate signals by the recruitment of kinases of the Raf family, thereby stimulating growth factor–signaling pathways (1Weber C.K. Slupsky J.R. Kalmes H.A.

Members of this family of kinases interact with several different GTPases of the Ras subfamily. For example, BRAF is activated by oncogenic Ras and by the GTPase Rap1 (2Vossler M.R. Yao H. York R.D.

Developing inhibitors of Ras has been challenging because of the high affinity of GDP/GTP for the GTP-binding pocket of the Ras family of GTPases and due to the flat topology of the conserved effector-binding site (8John J.

Consequently, to date, only a few small-molecule inhibitors exist that directly interfere with Ras function (10Cox A.D. Fesik S.W. Kimmelman A.C. Luo J. Der C.J.

To overcome the paucity of small molecules that directly interfere with Ras activity, several affinity reagents based on protein scaffolds have been developed to address different facets of Ras biology. For example, fibronectin-derived monobodies inhibit signaling by disrupting the dimerization of HRAS and KRAS at the plasma membrane (11Spencer-Smith R. Koide A. Zhou Y. Eguchi R.R. Sha F. Gajwani P.

Interfering with Ras dimerization limits the growth of xenografts that inducibly express the monobody (12Khan I. Spencer-Smith R. O'Bryan J.P.

An alternative strategy for inhibiting Ras signaling with engineered proteins is to prevent the recruitment of downstream effectors or block the activation of Ras by guanine exchange factors. To this end, affinity reagents have been generated that compete with Ras effectors by selectively binding to the active or inactive state of oncogenic Ras (13Guillard S. Kolasinska-Zwierz P.

The limited effectiveness may be related to the interaction of Raf-family kinases with various Ras GTPases. Thus, a rationale for affinity reagents with improved efficacy could be those that block interactions with multiple Ras family members simultaneously. An ideal affinity reagent that inhibits Ras function should precisely replicate the spatial constraints of effector binding to activated, GTP-bound Ras. Additionally, these affinity reagents should have a high affinity with the effector-binding site and the ability to outcompete downstream effectors. Consequently, such an affinity reagent would act as an inhibitor of Ras signaling, which could be used to probe the biology of Ras inhibition in cellular and patient-derived model systems. To derive an affinity reagent that fulfills these criteria, we adapted our strategy of optimizing pre-existing intermolecular contacts (21Ernst A. Avvakumov G. Tong J. Fan Y. Zhao Y. Alberts P.

We constructed a phage-displayed RBD library encoding mutations of interface residues and selected for improved binding to active, GTP-bound Ras. Crystal structures of complexes with activated HRAS G12V showed that the RBD variants (RBDvs) precisely mimic effector binding, and the engineered mutations subtly improve intermolecular contacts. Importantly, intracellular expression of individual RBDvs resulted in impaired growth of various cancer cell lines due to a robust inhibition of Ras signaling and the MAPK signaling cascade. Finally, in patient-derived colorectal cancer organoids with mutant or WT Ras status, we observed differential effects of the RBDvs on cellular growth and metabolic activity. These results indicate that not all tumors are equally dependent on Ras signaling to sustain a proliferative phenotype and that genetic data alone are insufficient to predict responsiveness to Ras inhibition. The ability of the RBDvs to inhibit growth of cells lacking activating mutations in Ras family members may relate to their multispecificity in interacting with active conformations of Ras GTPases with a conserved switch-1 region. Previous studies demonstrated that the CRAF-RBD is highly tolerant to mutations and can be computationally engineered to preferentially bind inactive states of Ras (18Filchtinski D. Sharabi O.

In total, we identified 14 residues that make side-chain contacts to the switch-1 region of the Ras effector-binding site. These residues are located on the β1-β2 hairpin and α1 helix and span two distinct regions of the CRAF-RBD. To achieve a moderate to low mutation rate that does not alter the binding mode or impair the structure of the RBD, we used a randomization strategy that allowed 70% of the WT nucleotides and 10% of the non-WT nucleotides to occur at any codon position encoding the targeted residues (Fig. 1A). Such a randomization approach results in a high probability of WT residues at the targeted positions and is commonly referred to as soft randomization. Additionally, we replaced three unpaired cysteines at positions 81, 95, and 96 of the RBD with serine residues to prevent dimerization of phage-displayed proteins and improve overall presentation of the RBDvs. Our final library contained more than 2 × 109 unique RBDvs presented on the surface of filamentous phage, and subsequent selection by phage display yielded five variants with improved binding to surface-immobilized GTPγS-loaded HRAS (Fig. 1B). The selected variants show a conserved mutational pattern, indicating a shared binding mode to activated Ras. Strikingly, the mutation of Gln66 to Glu is highly enriched in all five variants, indicating that this mutation has a crucial role in mediating the increased affinity. Coincidentally, the mutation from Val88 to Arg, previously shown to increase the affinity of RBD to HRAS (27Fridman M. Maruta H. Gonez J. Walker F. Treutlein H. Zeng J. Burgess A. Point mutants of c-raf-1 RBD with elevated binding to v-Ha-Ras.J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275 (10887184): 30363-3037110.1074/jbc.M003193200Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), was also present in all five variants. An Arg89 to His mutation occurred in four of the five RBDvs. After purification as His-tagged proteins, we tested whether the engineered RBDvs outcompeted CRAF-RBDwt binding to GTPγS-loaded KRAS in vitro (Fig. 1C). Relative to RBDwt, all engineered variants showed an enhanced ability to compete off GTPγS KRAS in solution. A similarly enhanced competitive ability of the RBDvs was observed using the Ras association domain (RA) of Ral guanine nucleotide dissociation stimulator (RalGDS) instead of the CRAF-RBDwt (Fig. S1A). Because RBDv1 and RBDv12 performed best in these experiments, we focused our further analysis on these two variants. Affinity measurements confirmed that RBDv1 and RBDv12 have an up to 20-fold improved binding to activated, GTPγS-loaded HRAS relative to RBDwt with negligible binding to the GDP-bound form (Fig. 1D). In control experiments, we verified that His-tagged HRAS GTPγS does not bind to GST-loaded sensors or empty sensors alone (Fig. S1B), indicating that the slow off rate is not due to nonspecific binding of HRAS to GST or the sensor material. To understand the structural basis for improved binding, we crystallized GMP-PNP–bound HRAS G12V in complex with RBDv1 at 2.9 Å and RBDv12 at 3.15 Å resolution in an active conformation (Fig. 2A and Table S1). Representative electron density of both structures at the binding interface is shown in Fig. S2A. Structural analysis revealed that the RBDvs engaged the effector-binding site of HRAS through a canonical binding mode (5Fetics S.K. Guterres H. Kearney B.M. Buhrman G. Ma B. Nussinov R. Mattos C. Allosteric effects of the oncogenic RasQ61L mutant on Raf-RBD.Structure. 2015; 23 (25684575): 505-51610.1016/j.str.2014.12.017Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar) with only minor shifts to the center of mass positions and rotation angle (1.8 Å/15° and 2.0 Å/16° for RBDv1 and RBDv12, respectively). Similar to the canonical binding mode of RBDwt, β2 of the RBDvs forms an extended intermolecular β-sheet with β2 of HRAS (Fig. S2B). In addition, helices α1 of both RBDwt and RBDvs form direct contacts with switch-1 residues in Ras (Fig. 2A). Binding of RBDwt to HRAS is mediated by a mixture of 24 hydrogen-bond and salt-bridge interactions, whereas binding of RBDv1 and RBDv12 with HRAS is mediated by a mixture of 14 hydrogen-bond and salt-bridge interactions (Table S2). Only two interactions, namely those between RBD Thr68 and Val89 and HRAS Asp38 and Glu37, respectively, are common in the three structures. Inspection of the direct contact interface reveals that the conserved RBDv mutations of Gln66 to Glu, Val88 to Arg, and Arg89 to His result in the rewiring of the hydrogen-bonding and salt-bridge pattern to the Asp38 and Tyr40 side chains in HRAS (Fig. 2B and Table S2). This change in hydrogen-bonding pattern together with steric effects involving Ile21 in HRAS and Val88 to Arg in RBDvs appears responsible for a shift of the α1-helix of the RBDvs relative to that observed in RBDwt (Fig. 2C). Although unlikely, we cannot rule out that the different binding mode observed between the RBDvs compared with the RBDwt with HRAS is due to different crystal packing. To test our hypothesis that the mutations at positions 66, 88, and 89 work together to improve binding, we performed a mutation analysis based on RBDv12 by replacing the engineered residues one by one with alanine. These alanine mutants of RBDv12 were displayed on phage and probed for binding to active HRAS (Fig. 2D). This experiment provides evidence that replacement of Glu66, Arg88, or His89 in RBDv12 with alanine abolished binding to activated HRAS, indicating that all three residues are required to mediate binding. This loss of binding is most likely due to a perturbation of the hydrogen bond pattern at the interface caused by the aliphatic side chain of alanine in one of the positions. In summary, our combinatorial approach to RBD-interface engineering identified three key mutations that work together to improve contacts to residues in the switch-1 region of Ras in an active conformation. Because the binding mode of RBDvs to HRAS overlaps completely with RBDwt, the RBDvs are expected to outcompete binding of Ras effectors that engage this common binding site. We tested the intracellular specificity of the RBD variants using mass spectrometry (MS). We immunoprecipitated hemagglutinin (HA)-tagged RBDvs and HA-RBDwt that were inducibly expressed in stably transduced colon carcinoma HCT 116 cells (Fig. S3, A and B). HCT 116 cells are heterozygous for the activating mutant KRAS G13D. Strikingly, relative to RBDwt, RBDv1 and RBDv12 displayed up to 5500-fold enrichment of peptides from endogenous KRAS4B G13D isoform (Fig. 3A and Table S3). The prevalence of peptides originating from the constitutively active KRAS4B G13D isoform suggests that the RBDvs preferentially interact with Ras GTPases, which are in an active conformation. We also detected peptides from other Ras-family GTPases, although these were ˜10-fold less abundant than KRAS4B G13D peptides. Analysis of the primary sequences of the other Ras family members that interacted with the RBDvs showed that these Ras family members share a common effector-binding site (Fig. 3B). In particular, the detected peptides were from Ras family members containing Asp38 and Tyr40 residues in their respective switch-1 region, which we identified as key interaction residues for the RBDvs (Fig. 2B). Thus, the immunoprecipitation data showed that RBDvs bind to their intended targets, Ras proteins, in cells and exhibit the highest affinity for active Ras. Consequently, these results suggested that the RBDvs are dominant-negative affinity reagents that will impair not only signaling through constitutive active Ras mutants but also other Ras GTPases in the active conformation. Thus, the RBDvs have the potential to inhibit multiple Ras-mediated pathways to Raf activation. Furthermore, the simultaneous inhibition of multiple Ras GTPases is potentially an efficient way to control the proliferation of cells with heterozygous KRAS genotypes, which confer resistance to MEK inhibitors (28Burgess M.R. Hwang E. Mroue R. Bielski C.M. Wandler A.M. Huang B.J. Firestone A.J. Young A. Lacap J.A. Crocker L. Asthana S. Davis E.M. Xu J. Akagi K.

To test whether the RBDvs act as inhibitors of Ras-dependent signaling processes, we probed whole-cell lysates from cell lines expressing HA-tagged RBDvs or RBDwt with antibodies detecting the phosphorylation state of kinases downstream of Ras proteins. We examined the effect of inhibition of Ras/Raf interaction on cell lines with different cancer origins and different Ras mutations at positions Gly12, Gly13, and Gln61 (Table S4). Specifically, cell lines with less frequent Ras mutations were chosen, because the crystal structures of the RBDvs in complex with HRas G12V already implied that the effector-binding site of Ras G12V would be inhibited by the RBDvs. Indeed, immunoblot analysis showed that the RBDvs reduced the phosphorylation of the growth signal–activated ERK1/2 in HCT 116, Mia PaCa-2, A549, and H1299 cells (Fig. 4A). The corresponding control experiments with RBDwt, despite its higher expression, did not reduce ERK1/2 phosphorylation, indicating that the improved affinity of the RBDvs for active Ras isoforms is required to suppress activation of these downstream kinases. Reduced activity of the MAPK pathway often results in reduced cell viability. Therefore, we measured ATP content, as an indicator of metabolic activity and viability, and monitored growth curves, as an indicator of proliferation. In all four cell lines, inhibition of effector binding to active Ras by the RBDvs reduced cell viability (ATP content) (Fig. 4B), indicating that the RBDvs disrupt Ras signaling in cells from different cancer backgrounds. Importantly, RBDwt control had only minimal effects on the viability of all four cell lines. Five-day growth curves measured with HCT 116 cells confirmed that the RBDvs, but not RBDwt, inhibited proliferation (Fig. 4C). Not only does Ras signaling mediate proliferative responses, but these GTPases also promote cell survival. In the presence of the RBDvs, HCT 116 cells exhibited reduced phosphorylation of Ser473 in the serine/threonine kinase AKT, indicating that the PI3K pathway is inhibited (Fig. 4D). Together, the reduced MAPK and PI3K pathway activity could not only reduce cellular metabolic activity and proliferation but could also increase apoptosis. We monitored HCT 116 cells expressing either RDBvs or RBDwt for annexin V staining as an indicator of apoptotic cells (Fig. 4E and Fig. S4). Quantification of annexin V staining by flow cytometry revealed that HCT 116 cells expressing the RBDvs had a significantly increased number of apoptotic cells compared with noninduced controls and compared with induced cel"

To shedding light on the underlying molecular mechanisms, transcriptome meta-analysis was integrated with weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA), connectivity analysis, functional enrichment, and hubs identification. Meta-analysis and Functional enrichment analysis demonstrated that most of the biological processes are up-regulated at heterotrophic growth condition, which leads to change of genetic architectures and phenotypic outcomes. WGNCA analysis of meta-genes also resulted four significant functional modules across logarithmic (LG), transition (TR), and production peak (PR) phases. The expression pattern and connectivity characteristics of the brown module as a non-preserved module vary across LG, TR, and PR phases. Functional analysis identified Carotenoid biosynthesis, Fatty acid metabolism and Methane metabolism as enriched pathways in the non-preserved module. Our integrated approach was applied here, identified some hubs, such as a serine hydroxymethyltransferase (SHMT1), which is the best candidate for development of metabolites accumulating strains in microalgae. Current study provided a new insight into underlying metabolite accumulation mechanisms and opens new avenue for the future applied studies in the microalgae field."
https://openalex.org/W3008252224,"Progression of blinding diseases, such as age-related macular degeneration, is accelerated by light exposure. However, no particular intervention is applied to the photostress. Here, we report neuroprotective effects of the adenosine monophosphate (AMP)-activated protein kinase (AMPK) activator, 5-Aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide ribonucleotide (AICAR), on light-induced visual function impairment, photoreceptor disorders and death in mice. Increase in retinal ATP levels in response to photostress was transient, because oxygen consumption rate (OCR) and cytochrome c oxidase (CcO) activity were reduced under photostress. However, AICAR treatment preserved OCR, CcO activity, and high levels of retinal ATP after light exposure. AMPK knockdown in the photoreceptor-derived cell line revealed that AMPK targeted CcO activity. Further, our data indicated that photostress reduced mitochondrial respiratory function and ATP levels, while AICAR treatment promoted neuronal survival and retained visual function, stabilizing ATP levels through preserved CcO activity. The current study has provided proof of concept for providing cells with sufficient energy to promote cell survival in the presence of cellular stress. This is in contrast to the previous reports which primarily investigated therapeutic approaches to suppress stress signals. Hence, stabilization of the ATP supply may serve as a novel therapeutic approach to support tissue survival under stress and prevent neurodegeneration."

https://openalex.org/W3008124566,"In France, many maternity hospitals have been closed as a result of hospital restructuring in an effort to reduce costs through economies of scale. These closures have naturally increased the distance between home and the closest maternity ward for women throughout the country. However, studies have shown a positive correlation between this increase in distance and the incidence of unplanned out-of-maternity deliveries (OMD). This study was conducted to estimate the frequency of OMD in France, to identify the main risk factors and to assess their impact on maternal mortality and neonatal morbidity and mortality.We conducted a population-based observational retrospective study using data from 2012 to 2014 obtained from the French hospital discharge database. We included 2,256,797 deliveries and 1,999,453 singleton newborns in mainland France, among which, 6,733 (3.0‰) were OMD. The adverse outcomes were maternal mortality in hospital or during transport, stillbirth, neonatal mortality, neonatal hospitalizations, and newborn hypothermia and polycythemia. The socio-residential environment was also included in the regression analysis. Maternal and newborn adverse outcomes associated with OMD were analyzed with Generalized Estimating Equations regressions.The distance to the nearest maternity unit was the main factor for OMD. OMD were associated with maternal death (aRR 6.5 [1.6-26.3]) and all of the neonatal adverse outcomes: stillbirth (3.3 [2.8-3.8]), neonatal death (1.9 [1.2-3.1]), neonatal hospitalization (1.2 [1.1-1.3]), newborn hypothermia (5.9 [5.2-6.6]) and newborn polycythemia (4.8 [3.5-6.4]).In France, OMD increased over the study period. OMD were associated with all the adverse outcomes studied for mothers and newborns. Caregivers, including emergency teams, need to be better prepared for the management these at-risk cases. Furthermore, the increase in adverse outcomes, and the additional generated costs, should be considered carefully by the relevant authorities before any decisions are made to close or merge existing maternity units."

Here, we report on the characterization of acyl-activating enzymes (AAEs) that catalyze the formation of CoA esters of different organic acids relevant for the N-substitution of the 3-phenylisoserine side chain of taxoids. On the basis of similarities to AAE genes of known function from other organisms, we identified candidate genes in publicly available transcriptome data sets obtained with Taxus × media.

At the garden scale, attitudes and preferences govern design and maintenance choices including the decision to encourage or discourage specific faunal presence. At the global scale, charismatic taxa that are well-liked attract more conservation funding and volunteer stewardship. Amphibians are a class of animals that are both loved and loathed making them a suitable subject for comparing and unpacking the drivers of preference and attitudes towards animals. We conducted a mixed methods survey of 192 participants in three adjacent neighbourhoods in Cape Town, South Africa. The survey included both quantitative and qualitative questions which were analysed thematically and used to explain the quantitative results. The results revealed that attitudes formed during childhood tended to be retained into adulthood, were shaped by cultural norms, childhood experiences and the attitudes of primary care-givers. The findings are significant for environmental education programmes aimed at building connectedness to nature and biophilic values."
https://openalex.org/W3007552756,"Given the problematic depictions of Native Americans and the pervasive cultural biases that exist, we sought to understand how contemporary educational practices in museums might encourage viewers to consider the context of their preconceptions rather than passively absorb conventional representations. In this two-part study, we tested whether and how viewers (mis)perceptions and interpretations of Native peoples might be influenced by encouraging empathy—specifically by taking the perspective of a Native individual depicted in a photograph they are visually analyzing. We randomly assigned participants in a lab setting (N = 120) and in a museum setting (N = 75) to one of three conditions (perspective-taking, stereotype-suppression, or control), and examined eye movements, self-reports, and verbal and written responses while participants viewed portrait photographs of American Indians. Notably, perspective-taking led viewers to interpret American Indians in a more emotional, empathetic, and human-centered manner than in control and suppression conditions. This was reflected in eye movements such that control and suppression participants attended to decorative features (e.g. jewelry) more than to the eyes of the depicted individual, whereas perspective-takers’ attention was more balanced. Similarly, perspective-takers used more empathetic and emotion-related language, whereas participants in control and suppression groups used more “objective” visually-descriptive language. Crucially, regardless of condition, cultural biases were stubbornly resistant to change and, in some cases, appeared even more frequently for participants adopting others’ perspectives. We argue that despite the positive outcomes associated with perspective-taking, the continued presence of cultural biases across conditions demonstrates that cultural competency-based interventions must be more complex and culturally-specific."

The data demonstrated an increase of acute-phase cytokines (IL-6 and TNF) in the first hours after inoculation, with a subsequent increase in IL-10 and IL-4, suggesting immune response modulation for the Th2 profile. The histopathological analysis showed significant morphological alterations, compatible with acute pulmonary lesions, with polymorphonuclear leukocyte (PMN) infiltration, intra-alveolar edema, congestion, hemorrhage and atelectasis.

The objective of this study was to identify the degree of consistency between the anticholinergic scales used for patients diagnosed with fractures. Methods This was an analytical agreement study conducted in patients diagnosed with vertebral and nonvertebral fractures in Colombia. The quadratic-weighted kappa coefficient was used to identify the consistency between the Anticholinergic Drug Scale-ADS, Anticholinergic Cognitive Burden Scale-ACB and Anticholinergic Risk Scale-ARS in assessing the prescriptions of fracture patients during the month prior to the fracture, during their stay as an inpatient and at discharge, according to Landis criteria. Results 220 patients with fractures were included, with a mean age of 75.3±10.3 years, and 68.2% were women. The ACB scale identified the highest anticholinergic burden (26.8%) in prescriptions made the month before the fracture, and the highest agreement was between ACB and ADS (0.717); during hospitalization and at discharge, the cholinergic antagonists were best identified with ADS (77.7% and 72.1%, respectively), with the best agreement between ACB and ARS (0.613 and 0.568, respectively). The prescription of tramadol was found in 64.1% of hospitalized patients and in 61.4% of patients at the time of discharge. Conclusions The scales evaluated show marked discrepancies between them, with highly variable frequencies of anticholinergic drugs identified at the different prescription times, and with low agreement among them, which is why the scales are not interchangeable in patients with bone fractures."

Preventive measures aiming to reduce the risk of exposure to these fungi require a better knowledge on their ecology and on the sources of contamination of the patients. In this context, 99 soil samples from the Rabat-Sale-Kenitra and Fez-Meknes regions in Morocco were analyzed. Samples were inoculated on the highly selective Scedo-Select III culture medium, and seven chemical parameters of the soils were measured. Scedosporium species were detected in 48 of the samples, with the highest density in soils from wastewater treatment plants and landfills, followed by those from roadsides and polluted riverbanks, thus confirming the impact of human activities on their ecology. Scedosporium apiospermum was the most common species, followed by S. boydii and S. aurantiacum. Analysis of the chemical parameters of the soils revealed the presence of Scedosporium species was mainly associated with a moderate electrical conductivity, a pH range of 7.0 to 7.6, a nutrient-rich content and a moderate phosphorus amount. Thereby, these results demonstrated the relatively high occurrence of Scedosporium in Morocco and highlighted the impact of phosphorus content on their ecology."

Here, we demonstrate that EVs from different human osteolineage sources do not have the same HSPC expansion promoting potential. Comparison of stimulatory and non-stimulatory osteolineage EVs by next-generation sequencing and mass spectrometry analyses revealed distinct microRNA and protein signatures identifying EV-derived candidate regulators of ex vivo HSPC expansion. Accordingly, the treatment of umbilical cord blood-derived CD34+ HSPCs with stimulatory EVs-altered HSPC transcriptome, including genes with known roles in cell proliferation.

African American men possess short polyQ tracts significantly more frequently than Caucasian American men. The length of polyQ tracts is inversely correlated with the risk of prostate cancer, age of onset, and aggressiveness at diagnosis. Aberrant activation of Wnt signaling also reveals frequently in advanced prostate cancer, and an enrichment of androgen and Wnt signaling activation has been observed in African American patients. Here, we assessed aberrant expression of AR bearing different polyQ tracts and stabilized β-catenin in prostate tumorigenesis using newly generated mouse models. We observed an early onset oncogenic transformation, accelerated tumor cell growth, and aggressive tumor phenotypes in the compound mice bearing short polyQ tract AR and stabilized β-catenin. RNA sequencing analysis showed a robust enrichment of Myc-regulated downstream genes in tumor samples bearing short polyQ AR versus those with longer polyQ tract AR. Upstream regulator analysis further identified Myc as the top candidate of transcriptional regulators in tumor cells from the above mouse samples with short polyQ tract AR and β-catenin. Chromatin immunoprecipitation analyses revealed increased recruitment of β-catenin and AR on the c-Myc gene regulatory locus in the tumor tissues expressing stabilized β-catenin and shorter polyQ tract AR. These data demonstrate a promotional role of aberrant activation of Wnt/β-catenin in combination with short polyQ AR expression in prostate tumorigenesis and suggest a potential mechanism underlying aggressive prostatic tumor development, which has been frequently observed in African American patients."

The presence of different isoforms in the Allium being discovered for the first time. In bulbs tissue, the highest allicin concentration was in Allium sativum, A. umbilicatum, and A. fistolosum (1.185%, 0.367%, and 0.34%, respectively), followed by A. spititatum (0.072%), A. lenkoranicum (0.055%), A. atroviolaseum (0.36%), A. rubellum (0.041%), and A. stamineum (0.007%). The highest allicin content in the leaves and roots were in A. sativum (0.13%), and A. stamineum (0.195%), respectively. The ORFs length ranged from 1416 in A. sativum (iso-alliinase2; ISA2) to 1523 bp in A. sativum (alliinase); the identity with A. sativum (alliinase) varies from 95% to 68% for A. ampeloprasum, and A. sativum (iso-alliinase1, ISA1) respectively. These data suggested that both ISA1 and ISA2 had a high expression in the roots and bulbs compared to A. sativum as the control in all species. Note that ISA1 and ISA2 were not expressed in the leaves. The results showed that isoforms expression patterns among different tissues in Allium species were variable.

Interdigitating secondary foot processes form a highly selective filter for proteins in the kidney, the slit membrane. Knockdown of slit membrane components such as Nephrin or Neph1 and cytoskeletal adaptor proteins such as CD2AP in mice leads to breakdown of the filtration barrier with foot process effacement, proteinuria, and early death of the mice. Less is known about the crosstalk between the slit membrane-associated proteins and cytoskeletal components inside the podocyte foot processes. Our study shows that LASP-1, an actin-binding protein, is highly expressed in podocytes. Electron microscopy studies demonstrate that LASP-1 is found at the slit membrane suggesting a role in anchoring slit membrane components to the actin cytoskeleton. Live cell imaging experiments with transfected podocytes reveal that LASP-1 is either part of a highly dynamic granular complex or a static, actin cytoskeleton-bound protein. We identify CD2AP as a novel LASP-1 binding partner that regulates its association with the actin cytoskeleton. Activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, which is crucial for podocyte function, leads to phosphorylation and altered localization of LASP-1. In vivo studies using the Drosophila nephrocyte model indicate that Lasp is necessary for the slit membrane integrity and functional filtration."
https://openalex.org/W3008274687,"The ecology and distribution of many bacteria is strongly associated with specific eukaryotic hosts. However, the impact of such host association on bacterial ecology and evolution is not well understood. Bacteria from the genus Methylobacterium consume plant-derived methanol, and are some of the most abundant and widespread plant-associated bacteria. In addition, many of these species impact plant fitness. To determine the ecology and distribution of Methylobacterium in nature, we sampled bacteria from 36 distinct rice landraces, traditionally grown in geographically isolated locations in North-East (NE) India. These landraces have been selected for diverse phenotypic traits by local communities, and we expected that the divergent selection on hosts may have also generated divergence in associated Methylobacterium strains. We determined the ability of 91 distinct rice-associated Methylobacterium isolates to use a panel of carbon sources, finding substantial variability in carbon use profiles. Consistent with our expectation, across spatial scales this phenotypic variation was largely explained by host landrace identity rather than geographical factors or bacterial taxonomy. However, variation in carbon utilisation was not correlated with sugar exudates on leaf surfaces, suggesting that bacterial carbon use profiles do not directly determine bacterial colonization across landraces. Finally, experiments showed that at least some rice landraces gain an early growth advantage from their specific phyllosphere-colonizing Methylobacterium strains. Together, our results suggest that landrace-specific host-microbial relationships may contribute to spatial structure in rice-associated Methylobacterium in a natural ecosystem. In turn, association with specific bacteria may provide new ways to preserve and understand diversity in one of the most important food crops of the world."

However, the mechanisms that govern this process are incompletely understood. Here, using several human cell lines, immunofluorescence and structured illumination microscopy methods, and ubiquitination assays, we show that the E3 ubiquitin ligase F-box and WD repeat domain–containing 7 (FBXW7), a subunit of the SCF ubiquitin ligase, down-regulates spindle assembly 6 homolog (HsSAS-6), a key protein required for procentriole cartwheel assembly, and thereby regulates centriole duplication. We found that FBXW7 abrogation stabilizes HsSAS-6 and increases its recruitment to the mother centriole at multiple sites, leading to supernumerary centrioles. Ultrastructural analyses revealed that FBXW7 is broadly localized on the mother centriole and that its presence is reduced at the site where the HsSAS-6–containing procentriole is formed. This observation suggested that FBXW7 restricts procentriole assembly to a specific site to generate a single new centriole. In contrast, during HsSAS-6 overexpression, FBXW7 strongly associated with HsSAS-6 at the centriole. We also found that SCFFBXW7 interacts with HsSAS-6 and targets it for ubiquitin-mediated degradation. Further, we identified putative phosphodegron sites in HsSAS-6, whose substitutions rendered it insensitive to FBXW7-mediated degradation and control of centriole number. In summary, SCFFBXW7 targets HsSAS-6 for degradation and thereby controls centriole biogenesis by restraining HsSAS-6 recruitment to the mother centriole, a molecular mechanism that controls supernumerary centrioles/centrosomes and the maintenance of bipolar spindles.

https://openalex.org/W3007065437,"Cardiac functions can be altered by changes in the microstructure of the heart, i.e., remodeling of the cardiac tissue, which may activate pathologies such as hypertrophy, dilation, or cardiac fibrosis. Cardiac fibrosis can develop due to an excessive deposition of extracellular matrix proteins, which are products of the activation of fibroblasts. In this context, the anatomical–histological change may interfere with the functioning of the cardiac tissue, which requires specialized cells for its operation. The purpose of the present study was to determine the cellular interactions and morphological changes in cocultures of 3T3 fibroblasts and RL-14 cardiomyocytes via the generation of a platform an in vitro model. For this purpose, a platform emulating the biological characteristics of endomyocardial fibrosis was generated using a cell patterning technique to study morphological cellular changes in compact and irregular patterns of fibrosis. It was found that cellular patterns emulating the geometrical distributions of endomyocardial fibrosis generated morphological changes after interaction of the RL-14 cardiomyocytes with the 3T3 fibroblasts. Through this study, it was possible to evaluate biological characteristics such as cell proliferation, adhesion, and spatial distribution, which are directly related to the type of emulated endomyocardial fibrosis. This research concluded that fibroblasts inhibited the proliferation of cardiomyocytes via their interaction with specific microarchitectures. This behavior is consistent with the histopathological distribution of cardiac fibrosis; therefore, the platform developed in this research could be useful for the in vitro assessment of cellular microdomains. This would allow for the experimental determination of interactions with drugs, substrates, or biomaterials within the engineering of cardiac tissues."

In one experiment on a convenience sample and a direct replication on a more representative sample, we find that a single Op-Ed article about political probity increased trust in government by an amount larger than the partisan gap between Democrats and Republicans. These results complement prior observational studies on trust in government by demonstrating that political probity plays an important causal role in shaping Americans’ judgments about the trustworthiness of their government and politicians."

https://openalex.org/W3007497104,"The presence of intact menisci is imperative for the proper function of the knee joint. Meniscus injuries are often treated by the surgical removal of the damaged tissue, which increases the likelihood of post-traumatic osteoarthritis. Tissue engineering holds great promise in producing viable engineered meniscal tissue for implantation using the patient's own cells; however, the cell source for producing the engineered tissue is unclear. Nasal chondrocytes (NC) possess many attractive features for engineering meniscus. However, in order to validate the use of NC for engineering meniscus fibrocartilage, a thorough comparison of NC and meniscus fibrochondrocytes (MFC) must be considered. Our study presents an analysis of the relative features of NC and MFC and their respective chondrogenic potential in a pellet culture model. We showed considerable differences in the cartilage tissue formed by the two different cell types. Our data showed that NC were more proliferative in culture, deposited more extracellular matrix, and showed higher expression of chondrogenic genes than MFC. Overall, our data suggest that NC produce superior cartilage tissue to MFC in a pellet culture model. In addition, NCs produce higher quality cartilage tissue at higher cell seeding densities during cell expansion."
https://openalex.org/W3008184731,"Human adults are faster to respond to small/large numerals with their left/right hand when they judge the parity of numerals, which is known as the SNARC (spatial-numerical association of response codes) effect. It has been proposed that the size of the SNARC effect depends on response latencies. The current study introduced a perceptual orientation task, where participants were asked to judge the orientation of a digit or a frame surrounding the digit. The present study first confirmed the SNARC effect with native Chinese speakers (Experiment 1) using a parity task, and then examined whether the emergence and size of the SNARC effect depended on the response latencies (Experiments 2, 3, and 4) using a perceptual orientation judgment task. Our results suggested that (a) the automatic processing of response-related numerical-spatial information occurred with Chinese-speaking participants in the parity task; (b) the SNARC effect was also found when the task did not require semantic access; and (c) the size of the effect depended on the processing speed of the task-relevant dimension. Finally, we proposed an underlying mechanism to explain the SNARC effect in the perceptual orientation judgment task."
https://openalex.org/W3007128469,"The protein Nogo-A has been widely studied for its role in inhibiting axonal regeneration following injury to the central nervous system, but the mechanism by which the membrane-bound Nogo-A is presented intercellularly is not fully understood. New research suggests that a highly inhibitory fragment of Nogo-A is generated by the amyloid precursor protein protease BACE1 and presented on the membranes of exosomes following spinal cord injury. This finding represents a new mode through which Nogo-A may exert its effects in the central nervous system."
https://openalex.org/W3006684044,We propose a novel method to quantify brain growth in 3 arbitrary orthogonal directions of the brain or its sub-regions through linear registration. This is achieved by introducing a 9 degrees of freedom (dof) transformation called anisotropic similarity which is an affine transformation with constrained scaling directions along arbitrarily chosen orthogonal vectors. This gives the opportunity to extract scaling factors describing brain growth along those directions by registering a database of subjects onto a common reference. This information about directional growth brings insights that are not usually available in longitudinal volumetric analysis. The interest of this method is illustrated by studying the anisotropic regional and global brain development of 308 healthy subjects betwen 0 and 19 years old. A gender comparison of those scaling factors is also performed for four age-intervals. We demonstrate through these applications the stability of the method to the chosen reference and its ability to highlight growth differences accros regions and gender.
https://openalex.org/W3007710155,"The purpose of this study was to assess the relationship between an embodied sensory experience and the ability to translate the perception of this experience visually using modifiable motion graphics.A custom-designed software was developed to enable users to modify a motion graphic in real-time. The motion graphics were designed to depict realistic visualizations of pain quality descriptors, such as tingling and burning. Participants (N = 34) received an electrical stimulation protocol known to elicit sensations of tingling. The protocol consisted of eight stimulation intensities ranging from 2-6mA delivered, in a randomized fashion and repeated three times, to the index finger. Immediately after each stimulus, participants drew the area of the evoked sensation on a digital body chart of the hand. Participants then modified the motion graphic of tingling by adjusting two parameters, namely the speed (rate of dots disappearing and re-appearing) and density of these dots in the drawn area. Then, participants rated the perceived intensity and selected the most appropriate pain quality descriptor.There was an increase in the area, density, and perceived intensity ratings as the electrical stimulation intensity increased (P<0.001). The density of the motion graphic, but not speed, correlated with perceived intensity ratings (0.69, P<0.001) and electrical stimulation intensities (0.63, P<0.01). The descriptor 'tingling' was predominantly selected in the range of 3-4.5mA and was often followed by 'stabbing' as the electrical intensity increased.The motion graphic tested was perceived to reflect a tingling sensation, the stimulation protocol elicited a tingling sensation, and participants adjusted one of the two motion graphic features systematically. In conclusion, an embodied sensation, such as tingling, maybe visually represented similarly between individuals. These findings create research, clinical, and commercial opportunities that utilize psychophysics to explore, visualize, and quantify changes in embodied sensory experiences in response to known stimuli."
https://openalex.org/W3008142190,The effects of environmental changes on the somato-sensory system during long-distance air ambulance flights need to be further investigated. Changes in nociceptive capacity are conceivable in light of previous studies performed under related environmental settings. We used standardized somato-sensory testing to investigate nociception in healthy volunteers during air-ambulance flights.Twenty-five healthy individuals were submitted to a test compilation analogous to the quantitative sensory testing battery-performed during actual air-ambulance flights. Measurements were paired around the major changes of external factors during take-off/climb and descent/landing. Bland-Altman-Plots were calculated to identify possible systemic effects.Bland-Altman-analyses suggest that the thresholds of stimulus detection and pain as well as above-threshold pain along critical waypoints of travel are not subject to systemic effects but instead demonstrate random variations.We provide a novel description of a real-life experimental setup and demonstrate the general feasibility of performing somato-sensory testing during ambulance flights. No systematic effects on the nociception of healthy individuals were apparent from our data. Our findings open up the possibility of future investigations into potential effects of ambulance flights on patients suffering acute or chronic pain.
https://openalex.org/W3008574776,"Emulsified volatile anesthetic can be directly injected into the circulation and eliminated from blood through lungs. Taking advantage of the unique pharmacokinetics of the emulsified volatile anesthetics, we aimed to develop a less traumatic method to differentially deliver them to the spinal cord of rabbit. Sixteen New Zealand White rabbits were randomly assigned to the isoflurane or sevoflurane group. A catheter was placed into the descending aorta, and emulsified isoflurane (8mg/kg/h) or sevoflurane (12mg/kg/h) was given respectively. The concentration and partial pressure of the anesthetics in the jugular and femoral vein were measured. Our results showed that the partial pressure for isoflurane was 3.91±1.11 mmHg and 12.61±1.60 mmHg (1.0MAC), and for sevoflurane was 3.89±1.00 mmHg and 19.92±1.84mmHg (1.0MAC), in the jugular vein and femoral vein, respectively. There was significant difference between jugular and femoral vein partial pressure for both isoflurane and sevoflurane groups (both P < 0.001). In conclusion, a simple and minimally invasive method has been successfully developed to selectively deliver isoflurane and sevoflurane to the spinal cord in the rabbit. Before the anesthetics taking action on the brain, 69% of isoflurane and 81% of sevoflurane were removed through lungs. This method can be used to investigate sites and mechanisms of volatile anesthetic action."
