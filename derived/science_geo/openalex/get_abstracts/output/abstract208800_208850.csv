https://openalex.org/W1980867815,"Normal mouse blood-forming tissue contains a class of cells which, on being transplanted into heavily irradiated mice, can proliferate and form macroscopic colonies in the spleen. Often, within a given colony, the cells which are observed indicate that differentiation is occurring along three lines, into cells of the erythrocytic, granulocytic and megakaryocytic series, respectively. Unique radiation-induced marker chromosomes were used to obtain direct cytological evidence that the spleen colonies are clones. Thus, the advantages inherent in the clonal approach to studies of the genetic and physiological properties of cells are available for investigations on h歡topoiesis.

The major correlate of this tolerance is taxonomic, rather than ecological."

One hundred reaction times obtained from each of 56 men and women between the ages of 20 and 30 years were analyzed."

Then, while dark adapted, they ""tracked"" their thresholds to stimuli spaced across the visible wavelength spectrum. Spectral sensitivity functions were determined for each animal from these threshold records. The functions agreed well with results obtained from a human subject in the same apparatus, and with the standard human scotopic function defined by the International Commission on Illumination. However, the monkeys' relative sensitivity was slightly higher in the long-wavelength portion of the spectrum."

https://openalex.org/W1972650114,"THE photochemical reduction of triphosphopyridine nucleotide (TPN) by extracts of photosynthetic organisms has been shown to be catalysed by a protein factor, photosynthetic pyridine nucleotide reductase (PPNR)1. PPNR has been detected in a variety of higher plants, algae and photosynthetic bacteria1,2. It has been shown2 to be similar to, but not identical with, the electron transport factor ferredoxin which has been isolated from several non-photosynthetic bacteria3. Thus far, however, PPNR has not been demonstrated in blue-green algae. Indeed, it has not proved possible to obtain cell-free TPN reduction by these organisms4 although spectroscopic studies on whole cells5 have shown that endogenous pyridine nucleotides undergo oxidation-reduction changes under illumination. In this communication, we report the isolation and purification of PPNR from a blue-green alga and also a method of obtaining photochemical TPN reduction in a cell-free system."

The geniculate potentials can be triggered by low-rate stimulation of the pontine reticular formation, but the reverse effect has never been obtained."

https://openalex.org/W2086753678,"A HUNGRY animal is considered to be in a state of high nervous irritability leading to a heightened level of sensory and motor excitation. As glycogen stores are depleted, blood glucose-levels decrease, circulating epinephrine rises and stimulates the reticular formation of the brain, which in turn produces cortical arousal and facilitation of motor and sensory activity, lowering the threshold for all external sensory stimuli1. A satiated animal, by contrast, is relaxed, disinterested in the outside world, sleepy, and consequently should have a high sensory threshold."

https://openalex.org/W1981480058,THE identification of non-volatile organic acids on paper chromatograms is usually dependent on the use of a suitable pH indicator which is applied to the developed and dried paper by spraying1. This procedure is inconvenient and an even distribution of indicator on the paper is difficult to obtain.

https://openalex.org/W2018765263,"HAPTOGLOBIN type distribution has been determined on 682 Thais. All were normal, healthy male adults in the Royal Thai Army. Almost without exception their place of birth was confined to the provinces of north central and north eastern Thailand. This area of the kingdom was chosen for the survey as the one in which the population would be the most representative of the Thai people. It was felt that in this region there would be a minimum of disturbance of the Thai haptoglobin gene frequencies by recent (that is, past several centuries) admixture with non-Thai groups such as Burmese, Chinese, or Malayans. The blood samples were heparinized and centrifuged and the plasmas transferred to merthiolated vials immediately after collection and afterwards transported to our laboratory for electrophoretic analysis. Haptoglobin type identification was accomplished by the Smithies vertical starch-gel electrophoresis procedure1 with minor modifications."

His findings on the distribution of such injected materials have since been repeatedly confirmed, and the technique offers a ready means of subjecting the right half of the brain-stem and the right fore-limb in this species simultaneously to the action of possible vasoactive substances."
