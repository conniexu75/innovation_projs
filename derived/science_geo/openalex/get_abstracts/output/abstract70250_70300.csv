https://openalex.org/W1501282895,"The particulate hexokinase activity of rat brain is interconvertible among soluble, particulate, and latent (also particulate) forms. Changes in the distribution of the enzyme among these forms may be effected by changes in levels of certain common metabolites in the incubation medium. Glucose-6-P, ATP, ADP, AMP, various chelating agents, and high salt concentrations cause solubilization, and ATP, ADP, and glucose-6-P also cause a partial exposure of the latent activity. Solubilization by glucose-6-P and ATP is relatively specific for hexokinase compared to solubilization by high salt concentrations. The solubilization by glucose-6-P is reversed by divalent cations and inhibited by Pi, while solubilization by ATP is not affected by these agents. Solubilization by ATP and glucose-6-P also differ in their sensitivity to temperature changes. Results are presented which are interpreted as indicating the existence of four pools of particulate hexokinase activity in rat brain, defined by their susceptibility to exposure and solubilization (or both) by ATP, glucose-6-P, and Triton X-100. It is suggested that these pools result primarily from differences in the intracellular location of the enzyme. It is proposed that hexokinase activity in vivo may be controlled by the relative distribution between soluble and particulate forms, the latter being more active. This distribution is considered to be governed by the intracellular ATP, glucose-6-P, and Pi (and possibly other metabolite) levels. The proposed increased activity of the particulate enzyme may be due, at least in part, to increased affinity for ATP, as measured by the Km value for this substrate, and decreased susceptibility to inhibition by glucose-6-P."

https://openalex.org/W2077338854,"Blood-engorged Culex nigripalpus (Theob.) collected throughout the year in two Florida localities were serologically tested to determine the host range of this mosquito in nature. A proportional increase in feeding on mammals occurred in early summer, reached a maximum between July and October, and was followed by a shift back to avian hosts which dominated the feeding pattern during winter and spring. This finding strengthens the hypothesis that a biphasic pattern of feeding is a basic characteristic of an enzootic vector that, in epidemic years, also serves as the primary vector of avian arbovirus to man."
https://openalex.org/W1987562666,"The abundance of N(15) relative to N(14) is significantly altered during experiments in vitro in which nitrate and nitrite are microbiologically reduced to nitrogen gas. In all studies to date, N(14)O(3)-and N(14)O(2)-species have been preferentially reduced. This selectivity has a complex dependence on conditions in the medium. The results are not only relevant to natural variations in N(15) relative to N(14) but should be seriously considered during N(15) tracer studies in soils."
https://openalex.org/W1579110958,"The turnover rates of six protein fractions of rat liver mitochondria were estimated from the incorporation of 14C-carbonate given continuously. The rates were similar and little heterogeneity was evident. When expressed as half-lives, the values ranged from 4 to 6 days. However, the turnover rates of two inducible mitochondrial enzymes, alanine and ornithine aminotransferase, were much faster. The half-lives ranged from 0.73 to 1.03 days. Zonal gradient centrifugation of mitochondria from treated animals indicated that the changes in enzyme activity were occurring in all of the mitochondria at the same rapid rate. The evidence from these experiments suggests that all mitochondria are in a dynamic state and that alteration of the enzyme complement is independent of mitochondrial genesis."
https://openalex.org/W1600179333,"Abstract The levels of ribonucleotide reductase activity (measured as the conversion of 3H-cytosine monophosphate to 3H-dCMP) in cell-free extracts of partially synchronized cultures of L cells were measured as the cells moved through the division cycle. A strict parallelism was found between the measured enzyme levels and the fractions of the population that were forming DNA. This relationship between enzyme level and ability to replicate DNA indicated that the reductase activity fell rapidly when cells emerged from the DNA synthetic period, suggesting a lability of the enzyme in vivo. The lability in vivo was confirmed by measuring enzyme levels in cultures where further protein synthesis had been blocked with cycloheximide. Under these conditions, an apparent half-life of less than 2 hours was observed for ribonucleotide reductase in the L cell."
https://openalex.org/W2049036227,Average evoked responses and accompanying free associations elicited by subthreshold visual stimuli were studied to determine if a differential discrimination between two stimuli would be reflected in either or both of these responses. The results indicate that the effects of subliminal perception are encoded in the average evoked response and also influence the content of free associations.
https://openalex.org/W1489421011,"A new method is presented for the purification of testicular hyaluronidase involving ion exchange chromatography followed by gel filtration on Sephadex G-75. A highly purified hyaluronidase preparation has been obtained which contains 45,000 National Formulary activity units per mg, dry weight, and which migrates as a single component on polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis at pH 4.3. The enzyme has been shown to be a glycoprotein containing 5.00% mannose and 2.17% glucosamine (expressed as N-acetylglucosamine). The molecular weight of the purified hyaluronidase has been determined to be 61,000 by gel filtration methods. This value is in contrast to a molecular weight of 126,000 for the crude enzyme, as determined by similar techniques. This difference between the crude and purified enzyme could be due to association with a carrier protein in the crude testicular extract or to the existence of hyaluronidase as a dimer in the crude state. Only 76% of the weight of the purified hyaluronidase could be accounted for by its amino acid and carbohydrate composition."

https://openalex.org/W1582395028,"Abstract The conformations of two peroxidase isoenzymes (A1 and C) and their apoenzymes were investigated by means of circular dichroism. In the visible region the circular dichroism of the two isoenzymes is essentially identical in five of the seven optically active heme absorption bands. These results suggest that the active sites are similar in both isoenzymes, but that small differences do exist. In the ultraviolet region both isoenzymes have the same circular dichroism (CD) with a positive band at 191 mµ and with negative bands at 208 and 221 mµ, suggesting that the isoenzymes have an appreciable helical content. When the heme is removed from either isoenzyme, the intensities of these bands are reduced by 14 to 28%. In the 250 to 290 mµ range, both isoenzymes have a negative CD band at 286 mµ and fine structure CD bands at 262 and 268 mµ. In addition, C peroxidase has a band at 280 mµ, and A1 peroxidase has a shoulder at 291 mµ. After removal of the heme from the isoenzymes, the 286 mµ CD band is lost, and the differences between the CD spectra of the two apoperoxidases are clearly evident. The C apoperoxidase has a negative CD band at 278 mµ. The A1 peroxidase has its main band at 283 mµ and a shoulder at 291 mµ. Both apoperoxidases retain the fine structure bands at 262 and 268 mµ. From a comparison of the peroxidase absorption spectra and the positions of CD bands in model compounds, the chromophores of the peroxidase CD bands are tentatively identified as: 286 mµ, heme; 278 mµ, tyrosyl; 283 and 291 mµ, tryptophanyl; 262 and 268 mµ, phenylalanyl."

The active tension is manifested as a main twitch contraction followed by a maintained low level of residual tension (aftercontraction) which persists until the terminal phase of rapid repolarization. The Strength of the aftercontraction is augmented when the extracellular concentration of calcium is increased."

https://openalex.org/W60016150,"Abstract Partial amino acid sequences of the α chains of goat hemoglobins A and B have been determined by fragmentation of the polypeptide chains and their insoluble cores with trypsin and chymotrypsin. The α chain of hemoglobin A was found to consist of two distinct polypeptides, which differ in at least 4 amino acid residues, located in positions 19 and 26 and between positions 113 and 115. One chain was designated as α-A or α-(Gly-19, Ala-26, Leu-113, Asx-115) and the second as α'-A or α-(Ser-19, Thr-26, His-113, Ser-115). The α chain of hemoglobin B was found to be a variant of the α-A chain by a substitution of an aspartyl residue in position 75 for a tyrosyl residue. The α-B chain was therefore designated as α-(Gly-19, Ala-26, Tyr-75, Leu-113, Asx-115), and hemoglobin B as α275 tyrβ2. The data indicate the presence of two nonallelic, closely linked α chain structural genes in the goat, while the α-B chain is considered to be the product of an allele of one of these two structural genes."
https://openalex.org/W1578143100,"Abstract Ribonuclease activity was shown in rat parotid gland homogenates and in the rat parotid saliva. An inhibitor to ribonuclease was found to be present in the gland homogenates but not in the secretion. When the ribonuclease inhibitor was inactivated by sulfhydryl reactants or heat, the ribonuclease activity in the homogenates was increased significantly over a pH range of 5.6 to 8.0. The shape of the curve of ribonuclease activity plotted against pH in the gland homogenates, when the inhibitor was inactivated, was virtually identical with that of the parotid saliva, and showed peaks of activity at pH values of 6.6 and 7.8. The ribonuclease activity of parotid saliva was shown to be separable from salivary deoxyribonuclease by electrophoresis on acrylamide gels. Upon stimulation of the rats with a sialogogue, the ribonuclease activity of the parotid glands decreased as the enzyme appeared in the saliva. It was concluded that ribonuclease is a secretory enzyme of the rat parotid gland."

https://openalex.org/W1499907727,"Abstract A steady state kinetic analysis has been made of the trypsin-catalyzed hydrolysis of Nα-benzyol-l-arginamide, Nα-benzoyl-l-lysinamide, and Nα-benzoyl-S-2-aminoethyl-l-cysteinamide at pH values from 8 to 10.7 at 30°. The Km (app) of the arginine derivative changes from 2.5 to 4.5 x 10-3 m while that of the lysine derivative increases from 4.6 to 17.2 x 10-3 m in going from pH 8 to 10.7. Over the same range the kcat for the arginine derivative decreases from 2.8 to 1.5 sec-1 while the value for the lysine derivative decreases from 1.9 to 1.3 sec-1. At pH 8.0, the Km (app) for the aminoethylcysteine derivative (4.3 x 10-3 m) was about the same as that for lysine derivative whereas the value of kcat of 0.33 sec-1 was considerably lower. At pH 9, 30° and under, the conditions in which the reaction was first order with respect to substrate concentration, the relative rate of cleavage of the arginyl, lysyl, and aminoethylcysteinyl bonds was 100:40:7. From the effect of pH on Km (app) and kcat of the arginine derivative, it was deduced that the enzyme possessed an ionizable group with a pKa of 10.4 which must be protonated in order to have a fully active enzyme. After correcting for the ionization of the enzyme, the effect of pH on the kinetic parameters of lysine and aminoethylcysteine derivatives could be correlated with the dissociation of their distal amino groups. The ionization constants of these groups as determined by the kinetic method agreed within 0.3 pH unit of their values as determined by titration in distilled water. More importantly, it was found by titration that the pKa of the α-amino group of the aminoethylcysteine derivative was 9.4 while the pKa for the e-amino group of the lysine derivative was 10.3. The same difference in the ionization constant was determined by the kinetic method. As a result of the difference in pK values between the basic groups of arginyl, lysyl, and aminoethylcysteinyl residues, it should be possible at high pH (10.7) to catalyze the hydrolysis of arginyl bonds in an aminoethylated protein with no cleavage of aminoethylcysteinyl bonds and with only slight cleavage of lysyl bonds. At pH 7.9, there was no indication of substrate activation by the above mentioned amides or by Nα-tosyl-l-arginamide or Nα-tosyl-l-lysinamide over the substrate range of 5 x 10-5 to 5 x 10-2 m. Under the same conditions the phenomenon attributed to substrate activation was observed for Nα-tosyl-l-arginine methyl ester and Nα-tosyl-l-lysine methyl ester. These studies were performed with trypsin that had been treated with the chymotrypsin inhibitor, l-(1-tosylamido-2-phenyl)ethyl chloromethyl ketone, and subjected to chromatography on carboxymethyl cellulose. The chromatography revealed two active components which were apparently interconvertible on rechromatography."

Hemoglobin-G Hsin-Chu, found in Taiwan in a Chinese from the northern Chinese province of Liaoning, is now shown to have the same structural anomaly."

https://openalex.org/W2009422278,"Eye movements were used as a criterion of observing responses in a vigilance task. Time on watch and signal rates similarly affected both eye-movement rates and percentage of detections. Observing rate may account for detection data, and may be a more stable measure of vigilance than detection rate is, especially when very few signals occur."
https://openalex.org/W1533868116,"Abstract The hydrolysis of a series of substituted anilides of N-acetyl-l-tyrosine by α-chymotrypsin has been investigated. Values of the kinetic parameters have been obtained in water and deuterium oxide solvent systems. It has been shown that the isotope effect decreases as the basicity of the substrate is increased. pH dependence studies have shown that the rate of hydrolysis, k2, is independent of pH above pH 7. The Michaelis-Menten constant, Km increases at both low and high pH values. The relative basicities of the substrates have been measured by titration of a series of model compounds, substituted acetanilides, in protonated and deuterated glacial acetic acid. In this way, it has been possible to examine quantitatively the relationship between the basicity of the substrate and the corresponding rate of α-chymotrypsin-catalyzed hydrolysis of the substrates. It has been shown that k2 increases with the basicity of the substrate in both water and deuterium oxide systems. This, together with the observation that the hydrogen isotope effect decreases with increasing basicity, suggests that the substrate is protonated before the transition state. The experimental data are consistent with a mechanism involving a pretransition state protonation equilibrium. The limitations of the present approximate treatment are discussed. It appears to be valid for the anilides studied and for peptides, but not for esters or substituted nitroanilides."
https://openalex.org/W1538208078,Abstract Tobacco mosaic virus has been partially stripped of its protein coat by sodium dodecyl sulfate. The nucleic acid exposed was digested with T1 ribonuclease and the products were examined for the presence of three oligonucleotides of unique sequence. The results indicate the location of two of the unique oligomers to be near the 5'-OH-linked end and the third to be near the middle of tobacco mosaic virus RNA. They also provide evidence that the cistron for tobacco mosaic virus coat protein is not situated at the 5'-OH-linked terminus.
https://openalex.org/W2004317859,"Hydrogen ion uptake by chymotrypsin during reversible binding of specific substrate is shown to be due to an ionizing group of the enzyme with a pK(apparent) approximately 9 in the free enzyme.

Previous results indicating an equilibrium, controlled by this ionizing group, between active and inactive conformational forms of chymotrypsin are confirmed."
https://openalex.org/W1507782220,Abstract An investigation of the requirement of the pH 6 acetolactate-forming enzyme for FAD has been performed with a recrystallized preparation of the enzyme. The following criteria indicate that the pH 6 acetolactate-forming enzyme is not a flavoprotein. 1. The addition of FAD to the enzyme assay did not stimulate the formation of acetolactate. 2. No FAD was released from the enzyme after trichloracetic acid treatment. 3. The absorption of the enzyme at 375 mµ and at 450 mµ did not indicate the presence of FAD bound to the enzyme.
https://openalex.org/W1595128668,"Abstract The interaction of lysozyme with di- and with tri-N-acetylglucosamine has been studied by the temperature jump relaxation method at pH 6.0, approximately 28.7°, ionic strength = 0.1 m. A single relaxation process is observed in the time range of 10 µsec to 100 msec, in both di- and trisaccharide-lysozyme solutions. No relaxation process is observed in the same time range in lysozyme solutions not containing saccharides. The bimolecular rate constants (k1) and dissociation rate constants (k-1) have been obtained for the lysozyme-saccharide interactions from the concentration dependence of the relaxation times. The rate constants (k1) are virtually identical (4.5 x 106 m-1 sec-1) for both the di- and the trisaccharide-lysozyme interaction, but the dissociation rate constant (k-1) for the disaccharide is over 30 times larger than that for the trisaccharide. The ratio of rate constants k1/k-1 is in good agreement with apparent binding constants obtained independently by other methods. A molecular explanation of these results is given in terms of the recent crystallographic data on lysozyme-saccharide complexes."

https://openalex.org/W2044282255,"The pressure in an osmometer, filled with nitrous oxide-saturated water separated from water by a polyurethane polyether membrane 2.5 microns in thickness, rose slowly by 8 to 20 millimeters (of water) in 10 minutes before gradually returning to close to zero within 2 hours. The permeation coefficient of the membrane was approximately 1000 times greater for water than for gases. The osmotic pressure of water saturated with nitrous oxide at 1 atmosphere, derived from the freezing point of the gas solution, was 1.5 atmospheres. It is concluded that dissolved gases exert osmotic pressure. Partial-pressure gradients of dissolved gases in the tissues of animals and man should cause flows of water along osmotic gradients, which may partially account for some of the symptoms and signs of dysbarism."
https://openalex.org/W2061628960,"During water diuresis in anesthetized rats, 4-leucine-oxytocin increased the urine output and the rates of sodium and chloride excretion. The potassium excretion rate was only slightly increased. During vasopressin-suppressed water diuresis, 4-leucine-oxytocin produced similar effects on urine and electrolyte excretions. In addition, it inhibited the vasopressin-induced free-water reabsorption, and it could reverse reabsorption to freewater clearance."
https://openalex.org/W1499128299,"Abstract The amino acid compositions of the tryptic and chymotryptic peptides of the α chain from sheep hemoglobin A and of the chymotryptic peptides of its insoluble tryptic core have been determined. The α-A chain of the sheep was found to be closely similar to the α-A chain of the goat; the only difference observed was the amino acid residue in position 104 (seryl in goat α-A and threonyl in sheep α-A). No indications were obtained for the presence of a second, structurally different, α chain. The limited structural studies of the α chain of sheep hemoglobin C support the previous observations that this α chain is identical with that of sheep hemoglobin A."

https://openalex.org/W1593583581,"Abstract An enzyme, β-hydroxybutyryl acyl carrier protein (ACP) dehydrase, which catalyzes the reversible dehydration of short chain β-hydroxyacyl-ACP to the corresponding α, β-unsaturated acyl-ACP derivatives has been isolated from extracts of Escherichia coli. Dehydrase preparations of specific activity of 5000 mµmoles per min per mg of protein were homogeneous as assessed by ultracentrifugal analysis and by polyacrylamide disc gel electrophoresis. The enzyme has an estimated molecular weight of 26,000. It is relatively heat-stable and is active over a broad pH range with maximal activity between pH 7.5 and 8.5. The dehydrase has a functional —SH group and can be readily inhibited by —SH-binding reagents such as N-ethylmaleimide and iodoacetamide. The dehydrase reaction is readily reversible and the equilibrium constant for the dehydration of β-hydroxybutyryl-ACP is estimated to be 19 m. The β-hydroxybutyryl-ACP dehydrase is active on ACP thioesters but inactive on the coenzyme A derivatives. The enzyme is specific for short chain length β-hydroxyacyl-ACP derivatives (C4 to C8). The estimated maximal rates of hydration of crotonyl-ACP, 2-hexenoyl-ACP, and 2-octenoyl-ACP are 4100, 2300, and 200 mµmoles per min per mg, respectively. The enzyme is inactive on 2-decenoyl-ACP. This limited chain length specificity of the β-hydroxybutyryl-ACP dehydrase is responsible for the accumulation of β-hydroxydecanoyl-ACP in a reconstituted fatty acid-synthesizing system comprised of highly purified preparations of malonyl-CoA-ACP transacylase, acyl-malonyl-ACP condensing enzyme, β-ketoacyl-ACP reductase, β-hydroxybutyryl-ACP dehydrase, and enoyl-ACP reductase. The β-hydroxy-decanoyl-ACP thus synthesized is readily converted to either saturated or unsaturated fatty acids by the action of protein fractions which contain at least two long chain βhydroxyacyl-ACP dehydrases."
