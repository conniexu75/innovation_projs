https://openalex.org/W2944941530,"There have been decades of research on the usability and educational value of augmented reality. However, less is known about how augmented reality affects social interactions. The current paper presents three studies that test the social psychological effects of augmented reality. Study 1 examined participants' task performance in the presence of embodied agents and replicated the typical pattern of social facilitation and inhibition. Participants performed a simple task better, but a hard task worse, in the presence of an agent compared to when participants complete the tasks alone. Study 2 examined nonverbal behavior. Participants met an agent sitting in one of two chairs and were asked to choose one of the chairs to sit on. Participants wearing the headset never sat directly on the agent when given the choice of two seats, and while approaching, most of the participants chose the rotation direction to avoid turning their heads away from the agent. A separate group of participants chose a seat after removing the augmented reality headset, and the majority still avoided the seat previously occupied by the agent. Study 3 examined the social costs of using an augmented reality headset with others who are not using a headset. Participants talked in dyads, and augmented reality users reported less social connection to their partner compared to those not using augmented reality. Overall, these studies provide evidence suggesting that task performance, nonverbal behavior, and social connectedness are significantly affected by the presence or absence of virtual content."
https://openalex.org/W2945251690,"Background Blocking the PD-1 pathway induces immune-related adverse events (irAEs) which often involve the thyroid gland (thyroid irAEs). Clinical features of a thyroid irAE including its predictability and relationship to prognosis remain to be elucidated. Methods Two hundred consecutive patients treated with nivolumab at Kyoto University Hospital between September 1, 2014 and August 31, 2017 were included in a retrospective cohort study. We systematically determined and classified subclinical and overt thyroid irAEs based on data collected of serum free T4 and TSH levels. Baseline characteristics and detailed clinical data were analyzed, and analyses of overall survival (OS) excluded patients censored within 1 month from the first administration of nivolumab. Results Sixty-seven patients (33.5%) developed thyroid irAEs and these were divided into a subclinical thyroid irAE group (n = 40, 20.0%) and an overt thyroid irAE group (n = 27, 13.5%). Patients with thyroid uptake of FDG-PET before treatment showed high incidences of overt thyroid irAE (adjusted odds ratio 14.48; 95% confidence interval [CI] 3.12–67.19), while the same relationship was not seen with subclinical thyroid irAE. Regarding the total cohort, the thyroid irAE (+) group had a significantly longer median OS than the thyroid irAE (−) group (16.1 versus 13.6 months, hazard ratio [HR] 0.61; 95% CI 0.39–0.93). In 112 non-excluded patients with lung cancer, the thyroid irAE (+) group similarly had a longer median OS than the thyroid irAE (−) group (not reached versus 14.2 months, HR 0.51; 95% CI 0.27–0.92). However, this observation was not seen in 41 non-excluded patients with malignant melanoma (12.0 versus 18.3 months, HR 1.54; 95% CI 0.67–3.43). Conclusions By thyroid uptake of FDG-PET, overt thyroid irAEs could be predicted before nivolumab therapy. Thyroid irAEs related to good prognosis in lung cancer but might be inconclusive in malignant melanoma."
https://openalex.org/W2945375121,"This study evaluated the effectiveness of a commercially available Ascophyllum nodosum alkaline extract as a plant growth stimulant and defense elicitor against foliar diseases of tomato and sweet pepper caused by Xanthomonas campestris pv. vesicatoria and Alternaria solani in a tropical environment. Foliar applications of 0.5% A. nodosum extract (AN) at 10-day intervals resulted in significant (P < 0.05) increase in plant growth parameters, including plant height (40%), leaf number (50%), plant dry biomass (52%), root length (59%) and chlorophyll content (20%) compared to control. Treated plants also had a significantly higher number of flower clusters, flower numbers, fruits per cluster and total harvested fruit yield. The Ascophyllum extract significantly (P < 0.05) reduced disease incidence by the pathogens in both crops under greenhouse and field conditions. The combinatory treatment of seaweed extract and a minimum dose of contact fungicide in field trials, recorded the overall lowest disease levels (60% reduction) and highest yield (57% increase). Investigations into the mechanisms of disease suppression revealed the effects of the extract in inducing the activities of defense-related enzymes including phenylalanine ammonia lyase, peroxidase, polyphenol oxidase, chitinase and β-1,3-glucanase, as well as the levels of total phenolic compounds. The effect on SA, JA and ET-mediated signalling defense pathways was examined by quantifying expression levels of marker genes including PR1-a, PinII and ETR-1, for the above pathways respectively. Both crop plants treated with A. nodosum extract had significantly higher expression levels of the PinII and ETR-1 marker genes than controls. This was coupled with a marked increase in gene transcripts involved in auxin (IAA), gibberellin (Ga2Ox) and cytokinin (IPT) biosynthesis, which provides possible evidence for induced growth in plants treated with AN extract. Cross-talks between growth and defense responses as a result of seaweed extract application could evidently implicate the benefits of seaweed extract usage in sustainable crop production."
https://openalex.org/W2945809189,"An impedance based microfluidic biosensor for simultaneous and rapid detection of Salmonella serotypes B and D in ready-to-eat (RTE) Turkey matrix has been presented. Detection of Salmonella at a concentration as low as 300 cells/ml with a total detection time of 1 hour has been achieved. The sensor has two sensing regions, with each formed from one interdigitated electrode array (IDE array) consisting of 50 finger pairs. First, Salmonella antibody type B and D were prepared and delivered to the sensor to functionalize each sensing region without causing any cross contamination. Then the RTE Turkey samples spiked with Salmonella types B and D were introduced into the biosensor via the antigen inlet. The response signal resulted from the binding between Salmonella and its specific antibody demonstrated the sensor’s ability to detect a single type of pathogen, and multiple pathogens simultaneously. In addition, the biosensor’s selectivity was tested using non-specific binding of E. coli O157 and E. coli DH5 Alpha while the IDE array was coated with the Salmonella antibody. The results also showed the sensor is capable to differentiate low concentration of live Salmonella cells from high concentration of dead Salmonella cells, and high concentration of E. coli cells. A detailed study on antibody immobilization that includes antibody concentration, antibody coating time (0.5–3 hours) and use of cross-linker has been performed. The study showed that Salmonella antibody to Salmonella antigen is not a factor of antibody concentration after electrodes were saturated with antibody, while the optimal coating time was found to be 1.5 hours, and the use of cross-linker has improved the signal response by 45–60%."
https://openalex.org/W2944872864,"The purpose of this study was to examine the selective influences of the maximum acceleration capability on change of direction (COD) speed, COD deficit, linear sprint speed, sprint momentum, and loaded and unloaded vertical jump performances in forty-nine male professional soccer players (24.3 ± 4.2 years; 75.4 ± 5.4 kg; 177.9 ± 6.4 cm). Soccer players performed the assessments in the following order: 1) squat and countermovement jumps; 2) 20-m sprinting speed test; 3) Zigzag COD ability test; and 4) bar-power outputs in the jump squat exercise. Athletes were divided, using a median split analysis, into two different groups according to their maximum acceleration rates from zero to 5-m (e.g., higher and lower ACC 0-5-m). Magnitude-based inference was used to compare the differences in the physical test results between ""higher"" and ""lower"" acceleration groups. A selective influence of the maximum acceleration ability on speed-power tests was observed, as the higher acceleration group demonstrated likely to almost certain higher performances than the lower acceleration group in all measurements (effect sizes varying from 0.66 [for sprint momentum in 20-m] to 2.39 [for sprint velocity in 5-m]). Conversely, the higher acceleration group demonstrated a higher COD deficit when compared to the lower acceleration group (ES = 0.55). This indicates compromised efficiency to perform COD maneuvers in this group of players. In summary, it was observed that soccer players with higher maximum acceleration rates are equally able to jump higher, sprint faster (over short distances), and achieve higher COD velocities than their slower counterparts. However, they appear to be less efficient at changing direction, which may be related to their reduced ability to deal with greater entry and exit velocities, or counterbalance the associated mechanical consequences (i.e., greater inertia) of being faster and more powerful."
https://openalex.org/W2945796099,"The intentional use of drugs to have sex-chemsex-among men who have sex with men (MSM) might contribute to the high sexually transmitted infections (STI) prevalence in this group. Limited data is available on chemsex outside major cities. The current study investigated the use of a wide variety of drugs during sex among MSM living outside major cities in the Netherlands and their associations with STI.In 2018, 350 MSM were recruited at STI clinics and 250 MSM completed an online questionnaire. Questionnaire data were linked to clients' most recent STI laboratory test results. Chemsex was defined as using cocaine, crystal meth, designer drugs, GHB/GBL, ketamine, speed, or XTC/MDMA during sex in the preceding six months. The use of other drugs was also assessed. Determinants (chemsex, specific drugs, number of drugs, combining, and frequency) potentially associated with STI were assessed using multivariable logistic regression analyses adjusting for sociodemographic characteristics and sexual history.Chemsex was reported by 35% (95%CI: 29-41) of the 250 participants. XTC/MDMA (27%; 68/250) and GHB/GBL (26%; 64/250) were the most used drugs. STI positivity was 33% (29/87) in MSM engaging in chemsex and 12% (12/163) in MSM not engaging in chemsex (p<0.001). Half of MSM engaging in chemsex (45/87) used three of more different chemsex drugs; STI positivity in this group was 44% (20/45). The only factor independently associated with STI was the use of three or more chemsex drugs (aOR: 4.13, 95%CI: 1.77-9.62).This study shows that chemsex is prevalent among MSM visiting the STI clinic outside major cities in the Netherlands, suggesting that health services in both urban and non-urban areas should be aware of and informed on chemsex. MSM who used multiple drugs are at particular risk for STI, indicating a special need for STI prevention and care in this group."
https://openalex.org/W2946505126,"Involving patients in research broadens a researcher’s field of influence and may generate novel ideas. Preclinical research is integral to the progression of innovative healthcare. These are not patient-facing disciplines and implementing meaningful public and patient involvement (PPI) can be a challenge. A discussion forum and thematic analysis identified key challenges of implementing public and patient involvement for preclinical researchers. In response we developed a “PPI Ready” planning canvas. For contemporaneous evaluation of public and patient involvement, a psychometric questionnaire and an open source tool for its evaluation were developed. The questionnaire measures information, procedural and quality assessment. Combined with the open source evaluation tool, researchers are notified if public and patient involvement is unsatisfactory in any of these areas. The tool is easy to use and adapts a psychometric test into a format familiar to preclinical scientists. Designed to be used iteratively across a research project, it provides a simple reporting grade to document satisfaction trend over the research lifecycle."
https://openalex.org/W2945987049,"The Toll signaling pathway in Drosophila melanogaster regulates several immune-related functions, including the expression of antimicrobial peptide (AMP) genes. The canonical Toll receptor (Toll-1) is activated by the cytokine Spatzle (Spz-1), but Drosophila encodes eight other Toll genes and five other Spz genes whose interactions with one another and associated functions are less well-understood. Here, we conducted in vitro assays in the Drosophila S2 cell line with the Toll/interleukin-1 receptor (TIR) homology domains of each Toll family member to determine whether they can activate a known target of Toll-1, the promoter of the antifungal peptide gene drosomycin. All TIR family members activated the drosomycin promoter, with Toll-1 and Toll-7 TIRs producing the highest activation. We found that the Toll-1 and Toll-7 ectodomains bind Spz-1, -2, and -5, and also vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) virions, and that Spz-1, -2, -5, and VSV all activated the promoters of drosomycin and several other AMP genes in S2 cells expressing full-length Toll-1 or Toll-7. In vivo experiments indicated that Toll-1 and Toll-7 mutants could be systemically infected with two bacterial species (Enterococcus faecalis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa), the opportunistic fungal pathogen Candida albicans, and VSV with different survival times in adult females and males compared with WT fly survival. Our results suggest that all Toll family members can activate several AMP genes. Our results further indicate that Toll-1 and Toll-7 bind multiple Spz proteins and also VSV, but they differentially affect adult survival after systemic infection, potentially because of sex-specific differences in Toll-1 and Toll-7 expression."
https://openalex.org/W2945831193,"Uterine leiomyomas or fibroids (UFs) are benign tumors characterized by hyperplastic smooth muscle cells and excessive deposition of extracellular matrix (ECM). Afflicting ~80% of women, and symptomatic in 25%, UFs bring tremendous suffering and are an economic burden worldwide; they cause severe pain and bleeding, and are the leading cause of hysterectomy. Yet, UFs are severely understudied with few effective treatment options available; those that are available frequently have significant side effects such as menopausal symptoms. Recently, integrated genome-scale studies have revealed mutations and fibroid subtype-specific expression changes in key driver genes, with MED12 and HMGA2 together contributing to nearly 90% of all UFs, but their regulation of expression is poorly characterized. Here we report that the expression of H19 long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) is aberrantly increased in UFs. Using cell culture and genome-wide transcriptome and methylation profiling analyses, we demonstrate that H19 promotes expression of MED12, HMGA2, and key ECM-remodeling genes via multiple mechanisms including a new class of epigenetic modification by TET3. Our results mark the first example of an evolutionarily conserved lncRNA in pathogenesis of UFs and regulation of TET expression. Given the link between a H19 single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) and increased risk and tumor size of UFs, and the existence of multiple fibroid subtypes driven by key pathway genes regulated by H19, we propose a unifying mechanism for pathogenesis of uterine fibroids mediated by H19 and identify a pathway for future exploration of novel target therapies for uterine leiomyomas."
https://openalex.org/W2946040134,"Little is known about the mechanisms through which neighborhood-level factors (e.g., social support, economic opportunity) relate to suboptimal availability of healthy foods in low-income urban communities. We engaged a diverse group of chain and local food outlet owners, residents, neighborhood organizations, and city agencies based in Baltimore, MD. Eighteen participants completed a series of exercises based on a set of pre-defined scripts through an interactive, iterative group model building process over a two-day community-based workshop. This process culminated in the development of causal loop diagrams, based on participants’ perspectives, illustrating the dynamic factors in an urban neighborhood food system. Synthesis of diagrams yielded 21 factors and their embedded feedback loops. Crime played a prominent role in several feedback loops within the neighborhood food system: contributing to healthy food being “risky food,” supporting unhealthy food stores, and severing social ties important for learning about healthy food. Findings shed light on a new framework for thinking about barriers related to healthy food access and pointed to potential new avenues for intervention, such as reducing neighborhood crime."
https://openalex.org/W2945026738,"Nanotechnology-based antioxidants and therapeutic agents are believed to be the next generation tools to face the ever-increasing cancer mortality rates. Graphene stands as a preferred nano-therapeutic template, due to the advanced properties and cellular interaction mechanisms. Nevertheless, majority of graphene-based composites suffer from hindered development as efficient cancer therapeutics. Recent nano-toxicology reviews and recommendations emphasize on the preliminary synthetic stages as a crucial element in driving successful applications results. In this study, we present an integrated, green, one-pot hybridization of target-suited raw materials into curcumin-capped gold nanoparticle-conjugated reduced graphene oxide (CAG) nanocomposite, as a prominent anti-oxidant and anti-cancer agent. Distinct from previous studies, the beneficial attributes of curcumin are employed to their fullest extent, such that they perform dual roles of being a natural reducing agent and possessing antioxidant anti-cancer functional moiety. The proposed novel green synthesis approach secured an enhanced structure with dispersed homogenous AuNPs (15.62 ± 4.04 nm) anchored on reduced graphene oxide (rGO) sheets, as evidenced by transmission electron microscopy, surpassing other traditional chemical reductants. On the other hand, safe, non-toxic CAG elevates biological activity and supports biocompatibility. Free radical DPPH inhibition assay revealed CAG antioxidant potential with IC50 (324.1 ± 1.8%) value reduced by half compared to that of traditional citrate-rGO-AuNP nanocomposite (612.1 ± 10.1%), which confirms the amplified multi-potent antioxidant activity. Human colon cancer cell lines (HT-29 and SW-948) showed concentration- and time-dependent cytotoxicity for CAG, as determined by optical microscopy images and WST-8 assay, with relatively low IC50 values (~100 μg/ml), while preserving biocompatibility towards normal human colon (CCD-841) and liver cells (WRL-68), with high selectivity indices (≥ 2.0) at all tested time points. Collectively, our results demonstrate effective green synthesis of CAG nanocomposite, free of additional stabilizing agents, and its bioactivity as an antioxidant and selective anti-colon cancer agent."
https://openalex.org/W2946343990,"Objective The endothelial glycocalyx constitutes part of the endothelial barrier but its degradation leaves endothelial cells exposed to transmigrating cells and circulating mediators that can damage the barrier or promote intercellular gaps. Syndecan proteins are key components of the endothelial glycocalyx and are shed during disease states where expression and activity of proteases such as thrombin are elevated. We tested the ability of thrombin to cleave the ectodomains of syndecans and whether the products could act directly on endothelial cells to alter barrier function. Approach and results Using transmission electron microscopy, we illustrated the presence of glycocalyx in human lung microvasculature. We confirmed expression of all syndecan subtypes on the endothelial surface of agarose-inflated human lungs. ELISA and western blot analysis suggested that thrombin can cleave syndecan-3/-4 ectodomains to produce fragments. In vivo, syndecan-3 ectodomain fragments increased extravasation of albumin-bound Evans blue in mouse lung, indicative of plasma protein leakage into the surrounding tissue. Syndecan-3/-4 ectodomain fragments decreased transendothelial electrical resistance, a measure of cell-cell adhesive barrier integrity, in a manner sensitive to a Rho kinase inhibitor. These effects were independent of glycosylation and thrombin receptor PAR1. Moreover, these cleavage products caused rapid VE-cadherin-based adherens junction disorganization and increased F-actin stress fibers, supporting their direct effect on endothelial paracellular permeability. Conclusions We suggest that thrombin can cleave syndecan-3/4 ectodomain into fragments which interact with endothelial cells causing paracellular hyperpermeability. This may have important implications in the pathogenesis of vascular dysfunction during sepsis or thrombotic disease states where thrombin is activated."

Numerous GTPases are implicated in oncogenesis, particularly the three RAS isoforms HRAS, KRAS, and NRAS and the RHO family GTPase RAC1. Signaling networks comprising small GTPases are highly connected, and there is some evidence of direct biochemical cross-talk between their functional G-domains. The activation potential of a given GTPase is contingent on a codependent interaction with the nucleotide and a Mg2+ ion, which bind to individual variants with distinct affinities coordinated by residues in the GTPase nucleotide-binding pocket. Here, we utilized a selective-labeling strategy coupled with real-time NMR spectroscopy to monitor nucleotide exchange, GTP hydrolysis, and effector interactions of multiple small GTPases in a single complex system. We provide insight into nucleotide preference and the role of Mg2+ in activating both WT and oncogenic mutant enzymes. Multiplexing revealed guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF), GTPase-activating protein (GAP), and effector-binding specificities in mixtures of GTPases and resolved that the three related RAS isoforms are biochemically equivalent. This work establishes that direct quantitation of the nucleotide-bound conformation is required to accurately determine an activation potential for any given GTPase, as small GTPases such as RAS-like proto-oncogene A (RALA) or the G12C mutant of KRAS display fast exchange kinetics but have a high affinity for GDP.

Whether genuine biochemical variations in the core G-domains of these proteins contribute to these observed biological differences remains an open question. Existing approaches to measure small GTPase kinetics include time-course HPLC, release of 32Pi from [32Pi]GTP, and, most commonly, release or uptake of fluorescent nucleotide analogs. These are crucial assays used to decipher how much activated GTPase might subsist in vivo. Unfortunately, several important drawbacks exist with these methods, foremost that fluorescently tagged analogs can impact reaction kinetics (15Mazhab-Jafari M.T. Marshall C.B. Smith M.

To accurately quantify the activation state of GTPases requires consideration of relative nucleotide affinity (i.e. preference of a given GTPase to bind GDP or GTP), the availability of Mg2+ cofactor, and the potential impact of multimer formation or membrane interactions. This would take into consideration the growing evidence that RAS GTPases dimerize (18Galeas J. Pitt C. Lin L.-J. Gray J.W. Nan X. Tamgüney T.M. Collisson E.A. Chu S. Lewis S. McCormick F.

Recently, real-time NMR (RT-NMR) experiments have been adapted to quantitate small GTPase activity (20Marshall C.B. Meiri D. Smith M.J. Mazhab-Jafari M.T. Gasmi-Seabrook G.M. Rottapel R. Stambolic V.

As GTPases undergo major conformational change upon binding to GDP or GTP, successive collection of 1H-15N heteronuclear single quantum coherence (HSQC) spectra allows for kinetic analyses of exchange or hydrolysis. Importantly, these assays do not require fluorescent nucleotide analogs or any chemical modification of the GTPase. Furthermore, as NMR assays are functional over a wide range of protein concentrations and even on membrane-tethered GTPase (22Mazhab-Jafari M.T. Marshall C.B. Stathopulos P.B. Kobashigawa Y. Stambolic V. Kay L.E. Inagaki F. Ikura M. Membrane-dependent modulation of the mTOR activator Rheb: NMR observations of a GTPase tethered to a lipid-bilayer nanodisc.J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2013; 135 (23409921): 3367-337010.1021/ja312508wCrossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), they can be used to probe the functional impact of proposed RAS GTPase oligomerization. To strengthen the RT-NMR approach, it is now possible to multiplex these assays (23Gebregiworgis T. Marshall C.B. Nishikawa T. Radulovich N. Sandí M.-J. Fang Z. Rottapel R. Tsao M.-S. Ikura M. Multiplexed real-time NMR GTPase assay for simultaneous monitoring of multiple guanine nucleotide exchange factor activities from human cancer cells and organoids.J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2018; 140 (29543440): 4473-447610.1021/jacs.7b13703Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar), allowing quantification of activation states for several GTPases monitored simultaneously in real time. This approach could therefore resolve whether GTPases behave autonomously in mixtures or whether they are highly interactive with each other or at concentrations that promote oligomerization and whether this impacts nucleotide exchange or GTP hydrolysis kinetics and/or effector binding. We employed here a multiplexed RT-NMR approach to study the full GTPase nucleotide exchange and hydrolysis cycle as well as specificity of effector binding. Using a selective-labeling strategy, we employed RT-NMR to concurrently measure kinetics and effector binding specificity of the three related RAS isoforms, across RAS and RHO subfamily members, and between cancer-associated mutations of RAS and RAC1 and WT counterparts. The data improve our understanding of the complexity and interconnectedness of small GTPases in the context of cell signaling, particularly the impact of relative nucleotide affinity, Mg2+ availability, and cross-talk mechanisms. To juxtapose structure–function data for multiple small GTPases in parallel, we selected seven enzymes from the RAS and RHO subfamilies (Fig. 1A). Structures of these proteins demonstrate the exceptional similarity of their tertiary folds (Fig. 1B) (24Nicely N.I. Kosak J. de Serrano V. Mattos C.

Identical sizes, shapes, and enzymatic functions makes in vitro profiling of numerous GTPase activities together a massive challenge. For NMR-based analyses, uniformly labeled samples of multiple GTPases result in excessive crowding of resonance peaks, as demonstrated in Fig. 1C using HRAS, KRAS, and NRAS. To observe multiple GTPases concurrently required a selective isotopic labeling approach with single 15N-amino acids. Fig. 1, D and E, show isotopically labeled RAS isoforms ([15N]Ile HRAS, [15N]Thr KRAS, and [15N]Leu NRAS) in both the GDP-bound and GTP-bound conformations (using nonhydrolyzable GMPPNP). The reduction in spectral complexity allowed us to monitor nucleotide exchange, GTP hydrolysis, or effector binding in mixtures of even the most highly related GTPases. We performed exchange and hydrolysis assays on individual selectively labeled GTPases to profile their kinetic activity in isolation. NMR spectra and nucleotide exchange plots for [15N]Tyr HRAS, [15N]Thr KRAS, [15N]Leu NRAS, [15N]Leu RALA, [15N]Val RHEB, [15N]Val RHOG, and [15N]Leu RAC1 are displayed in Figs. S1 and S2, A–G. Kinetics for these reactions are detailed in Table S1 (as for all individually measured GTPase kinetics). Exchange was initiated by the addition of a 10:1 molar ratio of the GTP analog GTPγS, used to reflect the cellular GTP:GDP ratio. Measured exchange rates for HRAS match what has been calculated by RT-NMR using uniformly labeled samples (21Smith M.J. Neel B.G. Ikura M. NMR-based functional profiling of RASopathies and oncogenic RAS mutations.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2013; 110 (23487764): 4574-457910.1073/pnas.1218173110Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). As individual GTPases reach an activation plateau (i.e. nucleotide exchange no longer proceeds), they exhibit differential GTPγS loading that reflects their activation state at equilibrium. We report these data in Table S1 as “% Activated.” Furthermore, as we control the GTPγS:GDP ratio at 10:1, we can also calculate the preference of these GTPases to each nucleotide, reported as “GDP Preference.” We observed that the three RAS isoforms and RHEB exhibited a much higher ratio of GTPγS-bound (∼65–75%) in these conditions compared with RALA (38%) or RHOG (49%), a direct reflection of differential nucleotide affinities. We next measured intrinsic GTP hydrolysis for each RAS isoform ([15N]Tyr HRAS, [15N]Thr KRAS, and [15N]Leu NRAS) (Fig. S2, H–J). The measured rate for HRAS matches what was previously determined on uniformly labeled protein (21Smith M.J. Neel B.G. Ikura M. NMR-based functional profiling of RASopathies and oncogenic RAS mutations.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2013; 110 (23487764): 4574-457910.1073/pnas.1218173110Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar), and NRAS and KRAS exhibited near identical rates. Overall, the selective-labeling approach provides an opportunity to precisely measure GTPase activity while reducing spectral complexity. To begin assaying multiplexed GTPases, we first focused on the three highly related RAS isoforms. There has been little attempt to study differences in nucleotide exchange and/or GTP hydrolysis rates for the RAS isoforms in their individual contexts; however, one study found that the intrinsic rates of GTP catalysis differed across isoforms using [32Pi]GTP single turnover (29Johnson C.W. Reid D. Parker J.A. Salter S. Knihtila R. Kuzmic P. Mattos C. The small GTPases K-Ras, N-Ras, and H-Ras have distinct biochemical properties determined by allosteric effects.J. Biol.

Due to the inefficiency of selective labeling, monitoring HSQC chemical shifts of the three GTPases required each at a concentration of 300 μm. Interestingly, this meant we could assay GTPase activity at concentrations that should drive RAS dimerization. The existence of KRAS homodimers remains contentious, with proposed dissociation binding constants ranging from low μm (30Muratcioglu S. Chavan T.S. Freed B.C. Jang H. Khavrutskii L. Freed R.N.

Performing these assays at total GTPase concentrations approaching 1 mm would resolve whether G-domain oligomers can influence RAS activation in solution. Initial multiplexed nucleotide exchange assays (GDP-to-GTPγS) at a 10:1 molar excess of GTPγS showed exchange rates substantially faster than those measured for GTPases individually at comparatively lower concentrations. To resolve this, we considered that exchange assays with each RAS isoform alone at various concentrations (150, 250, or 350 μm) showed that rates increase with protein concentration (Fig. 2, A–C). Mg2+ cofactor is absolutely required for nucleotide binding to RAS GTPases, and both RAS (34Schweins T. Scheffzek K. Assheuer R. Wittinghofer A. The role of the metal ion in the p21ras catalysed GTP-hydrolysis: Mn2+ versus Mg2+.J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 266 (9102473): 847-85610.1006/jmbi.1996.0814Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) and RHO (35Zhang B. Zhang Y. Wang Z. Zheng Y. The role of Mg2+cofactor in the guanine nucleotide exchange and GTP hydrolysis reactions of Rho family GTP-binding proteins.J. Biol.

The majority of GTPase kinetic studies use MgCl2 at a steady concentration of 5 mm, and we postulated that increasing protein concentrations lower the [Mg2+]:[GTPase] ratio, leading to Mg2+ scarcity and faster exchange rates. To test this, we measured nucleotide exchange of NRAS at 200 or 350 μm in 5 mm MgCl2, again showing that the rate increases at a higher concentration (Fig. 2D). When the assay was repeated at 15 mm MgCl2, exchange rates were identical. Thus, Mg2+ availability is a key determinant of GTPase exchange, which otherwise proceeds independently of protein concentration even approaching 1 mm. When we performed a “reverse exchange assay (GTPγS-to-GDP) at two different concentrations of HRAS (150 and 300 μm) and a MgCl2 concentration of 5 mm, we saw no effect on the rate (Fig. S2K). GDP disassociation is therefore more influenced by [Mg2+] than GTP. Interestingly, there are several recurrent oncogenic mutants of RAS that have been determined to function by rapid intrinsic exchange (21Smith M.J. Neel B.G. Ikura M. NMR-based functional profiling of RASopathies and oncogenic RAS mutations.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2013; 110 (23487764): 4574-457910.1073/pnas.1218173110Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). As these mutations lie proximal to the nucleotide/Mg2+-binding pocket, we were curious whether increasing [Mg2+] may slow their intrinsic exchange rate. We purified isotopically labeled KRAS proteins of two fast-exchange mutants, G13D (found within the P-loop) and Q61L (in the switch II region) (21Smith M.J. Neel B.G. Ikura M. NMR-based functional profiling of RASopathies and oncogenic RAS mutations.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

We performed nucleotide exchange assays at either 5 or 50 mm MgCl2 (Fig. 2F). There was no Mg2+ dependence on the exchange rate of either mutant, indicating that these amino acid mutations alter nucleotide affinity rather than disrupt coordination of the Mg2+ ion. Finally, we tested whether increasing concentrations of RAS with a steady concentration of Mg2+ would lead to differences in GTP hydrolysis. Neither KRAS, HRAS, nor NRAS exhibited altered GTP hydrolysis rates with increasing protein concentration at a constant [Mg2+] of 5 mm (Fig. 2, G–I). This is consistent with the absence of competing nucleotide in these assays and with data suggesting that GDP binding is more dependent on Mg2+ than is GTP binding (37Reinstein J. Schlichting I. Frech M. Goody R.S. Wittinghofer A. p21 with a phenylalanine 28 → leucine mutation reacts normally with the GTPase activating protein GAP but nevertheless has transforming properties.J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266 (1894650): 17700-17706Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). With a strategy for selective amino acid labeling and conditions optimized for simultaneously monitoring multiple GTPase activities, we performed a series of multiplexed nucleotide exchange assays. Fig. 3, A–C, show HSQC spectra depicting the amino acid labeling strategy and consequent GDP/GTPγS-bound peaks used to concurrently measure exchange rates for HRAS, KRAS, and NRAS. Temporal resolution of chemical shifts and plots for intrinsic nucleotide exchange of these RAS isoforms are in Fig. 3, D and E. For this experiment, we utilized a [GTPγS]:[GTPase] ratio of 8:1 and 15 mm MgCl2. Each isoform was at a concentration of 300 μm. Mixing multiple GTPases at these concentrations did not lead to obvious binding or higher-order complexes, as no significant chemical shift perturbations or peak broadening was observed. Intrinsic exchange rates for each of the three isoforms were not changed from those measured for HRAS, KRAS, and NRAS alone at lower concentrations. Kinetic analyses and parameters for all multiplexed assays are detailed in Table S2. All three GTPases were 80–90% activated at equilibrium and demonstrated a minor preference for GDP over GTPγS. We can conclude that neither the presence of alternative RAS isoforms nor high concentrations of these GTPases significantly impact their activation state. We next examined the NRAS GTPase in parallel with a related GTPase, RALA, and a RHO subfamily GTPase, RHOG. Fig. 3, F–J, depict the labeling strategy and multiplexed exchange. RALA and RHOG exhibited slightly faster exchange rates than NRAS (1.4- and 1.3-fold, respectively), but their percent activation at equilibrium is significantly lower than that of NRAS (84% GTPγS-bound for NRAS, 46% for RALA, and 49% for RHOG). This reveals that RALA and RHOG have a greater preference for GDP over GTPγS compared with NRAS. These data highlight the need to directly monitor the nucleotide-bound state when quantifying GTPase activation, as kinetic rates alone can significantly misrepresent the total activated GTPase in a given system. Our multiplexed NMR strategy presents an opportunity to observe the effects and specificity of exchange-promoting GEFs and hydrolysis-activating GAPs on mixtures of small GTPases (Fig. 4A). We performed a GEF assay in a mixture of the three isoforms of RAS using a catalytic domain from the major RAS regulator SOS1 (SOScat (21Smith M.J. Neel B.G. Ikura M.

Oxidative stress is one of the key factors in the onset and progression of AMD. In this study, metabolites associated with AMD pathology more so at the systemic level namely, oxidized LDL (oxLDL), homocysteine (Hcy), homocysteine thiolactone (HCTL), advanced glycation end product (AGE) were evaluated for their pro-oxidant nature in a localized ocular environment based on in vitro studies in human retinal pigment epithelial cells (ARPE-19 cells). Human ARPE-19 cells were treated with pro-oxidants 50 μg/mL oxLDL, 500 μM Hcy, 500 nM HCTL, 100 μg/mL AGE, 200 μM H2O2 and 200 μM H2O2 with and without pre-treatment of 5 mM N-acetyl cysteine (NAC). The cytokines IL-6, IL-8 and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) secreted from ARPE-19 cells exposed to pro-oxidants were estimated by ELISA. In vitro angiogenesis assay was performed with conditioned media of the pro-oxidant treated ARPE-19 cells in Geltrex-Matrigel coated 96-well plate. The human acute monocytic leukemia cell line (THP-1) was differentiated into macrophages and its migration in response to conditioned media of ARPE-19 cells insulted with the pro-oxidants was studied by transwell migration assay. Western blot was performed to detect the protein expression of Bax, Bcl-2 and NF-κB to assess apoptotic changes. The compounds involved in the study showed a significant increase in reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation in ARPE-19 cells (oxLDL; Hcy; AGE: p < 0.001 and HCTL: p < 0.05). NAC pre-treatment significantly lowered the oxidative stress brought about by pro-oxidants as seen by lowered ROS and MDA levels in the cells. Treatment with pro-oxidants significantly increased the secretion of IL-6 (oxLDL: p < 0.05; Hcy, HCTL and AGE: p < 0.01) and IL-8 cytokines (oxLDL: p < 0.05; HCTL: p <. 001 and AGE: p < 0.01) in ARPE-19 cells. Serum samples of AMD patients (n = 23) revealed significantly higher IL-6 and IL-8 levels compared to control subjects (n = 23) (IL6: p < 0.01 and IL8: p < 0.05). The pro-oxidants also promoted VEGF secretion by ARPE-19 cells compared to untreated control (oxLDL: p < 0.001; Hcy: p < 0.01; HCTL and AGE: p < 0.05). In vitro angiogenesis assay showed that the conditioned media significantly increased the tube formation in RF/6A endothelial cells. Transwell migration assay revealed significant infiltration of macrophages in response to pro-oxidants. We further demonstrated that the pro-oxidants increased the Bax/Bcl-2 ratio and increased the NF-κB activation resulting in pro-apoptotic changes in ARPE-19 cells. Thus, oxLDL, Hcy, HCTL and AGE act as pro-oxidant metabolites in RPE that promote AMD through oxidative stress, inflammation, chemotaxis and neovascularization."
https://openalex.org/W2945508173,"Opisthorchiasis caused by food-borne trematode Opisthorchis felineus is a substantial public health problem, with 17 million persons infected worldwide. This chronic disease is associated with hepatobiliary inflammation, cholangiocyte dysplasia, cholangiofibrosis, intraepithelial neoplasia, and even cholangiocarcinoma among chronically infected individuals. To provide first insights into the mechanism by which O. felineus infection causes precancerous liver lesions, we investigated the level of oxidative stress (lipid peroxidation byproducts and 8-hydroxy-2′-deoxyguanosine) as well as the time course profiles of chronic inflammation and fibrogenesis markers in the dynamics of opisthorchiasis from 1 month to 1.5 years postinfection in an experimental model based on golden hamsters Mesocricetus auratus. For the first time, we showed that O. felineus infection provokes time-dependent accumulation of oxidative hepatobiliary lesions in the injured liver of hamsters. In particular, over the course of infection, lipid peroxidation byproducts 4-hydroxynonenal and malondialdehyde were upregulated; these changes in general correlate with the dynamics of hepatic histopathological changes. We detected macrophages with various immunophenotypes and elevated levels of CD68, COX2, and CD163 in the O. felineus–infected animals. Meanwhile, there was direct time-dependent elevation of TNF-α (R = 0.79; p < 0.001) and CD163 protein levels (R = 0.58; p = 0.022). We also provide quantitative data about epithelial hyperplasia marker CK7 and a marker of myofibroblast activation (α smooth muscle actin). Our present data provide first insights into the histopathological mechanism by which O. felineus infection causes liver injuries. These findings support the inclusion of O. felineus in Group 1 of biological carcinogens."

The aim of this study was to assess the associations between physical activity (PA), sedentary time (SED), body mass index and Ciclovía participation among children aged 9 to 13 years. Methods All students in the 4th and 5th grades from the selected schools were invited to participate in the study. The study included 923 children. PA and SED were measured using waist-worn accelerometers, and height and weight were measured using standardized procedures. Ciclovía participation was self-reported. The analyses included multilevel linear, generalized mixed and generalized additive models. Results The mean age of the sample was 10.1±0.7 years, and 49.5% were boys. In the last year, 46% of the children participated in the Ciclovía, and 34% reported participating frequently (at least once per month). No differences were found in the mean minutes of moderate-to-vigorous PA on weekdays between frequent Ciclovía users and sporadic and non-Ciclovía users (72 vs 69; p = 0.09). In contrast, frequent Ciclovía users had higher moderate-to-vigorous PA on Sundays than sporadic and non-Ciclovía users (65.6 vs 59.2; p = 0.01), specifically between the hours of 12:00 and 16:00. In addition, frequent Ciclovía users did not differ from the sporadic and non-Ciclovía users in SED (515.3 vs 521.3; p = 0.19). Frequent Ciclovía users had lower SED on Sundays than the sporadic and non-Ciclovía users (437.7 vs 456.5; p = 0.005). Additionally, frequent Ciclovía users were more likely to be overweight (28.3% vs 20.4% p = 0.01). We did not find differences in participation by sex, and low-to-middle income children were more likely to participate. Conclusions The Ciclovías offer an innovative, inclusive recreational space and consequently provide opportunities to increase moderate-to-vigorous PA and reduce SED among children."

Social contact interventions have been shown to reduce prejudice and stereotyping, but optimal contact conditions between groups are often out of reach in day to day life. Therefore, we investigated the effects of a synchronous walking intervention, a non-verbal embodied approach to intergroup contact that may reduce the need for optimal contact conditions. We studied attitude change towards the Roma group in Hungary following actual and imagined walking, both in a coordinated and uncoordinated manner. Results showed that coordinated walking, both imagined and in vivo, led to explicit and implicit reductions in prejudice and stereotyping towards both the Roma individual and the wider Roma social group. This suggests that coordinated movement could be a valuable addition to current approaches towards prejudice reduction."
https://openalex.org/W2946669262,"Physical fatigue and pronated feet constitute two risk factors for running-related lower limb injuries. Accordingly, different running shoe companies designed anti-pronation shoes with medial support to limit over pronation in runners. However, there is little evidence on the effectiveness and clinical relevance of anti-pronation shoes. This study examined lower limb kinematics and kinetics in young female runners with pronated feet during running with anti-pronation versus regular (neutral) running shoes in unfatigued and fatigued condition. Twenty-six female runners aged 24.1±5.6 years with pronated feet volunteered to participate in this study. Kinetic (3D Kistler force plate) and kinematic analyses (Vicon motion analysis system) were conducted to record participants’ ground reaction forces and joint kinematics when running with anti-pronation compared with neutral running shoes. Physical fatigue was induced through an individualized submaximal running protocol on a motorized treadmill using rate of perceived exertion and heart rate monitoring. The statistical analyses indicated significant main effects of “footwear” for peak ankle inversion, peak ankle eversion, and peak hip internal rotation angles (p<0.03; d = 0.46–0.95). Pair-wise comparisons revealed a significantly greater peak ankle inversion angle (p<0.03; d = 0.95; 2.70°) and smaller peak eversion angle (p<0.03; d = 0.46; 2.53°) when running with anti-pronation shoes compared with neutral shoes. For kinetic data, significant main effects of “footwear” were found for peak ankle dorsiflexor moment, peak knee extensor moment, peak hip flexor moment, peak hip extensor moment, peak hip abductor moment, and peak hip internal rotator moment (p<0.02; d = 1.00–1.79). For peak positive hip power in sagittal and frontal planes and peak negative hip power in horizontal plane, we observed significant main effects of “footwear” (p<0.03; d = 0.92–1.06). Pairwise comparisons revealed that peak positive hip power in sagittal plane (p<0.03; d = 0.98; 2.39 w/kg), peak positive hip power in frontal plane (p = 0.014; d = 1.06; 0.54 w/kg), and peak negative hip power in horizontal plane (p<0.03; d = 0.92; 0.43 w/kg) were greater with anti-pronation shoes. Furthermore, the statistical analyses indicated significant main effects of “Fatigue” for peak ankle inversion, peak ankle eversion, and peak knee external rotation angles. Pair-wise comparisons revealed a fatigue-induced decrease in peak ankle inversion angle (p<0.01; d = 1.23; 2.69°) and a fatigue-induced increase in peak knee external rotation angle (p<0.05; d = 0.83; 5.40°). In addition, a fatigue-related increase was found for peak ankle eversion (p<0.01; d = 1.24; 2.67°). For kinetic data, we observed a significant main effect of “Fatigue” for knee flexor moment, knee internal rotator moment, and hip extensor moment (p<0.05; d = 0.83–1.01). The statistical analyses indicated significant a main effect of “Fatigue” for peak negative ankle power in sagittal plane (p<0.01; d = 1.25). Finally, we could not detect any significant footwear by fatigue interaction effects for all measures of joint kinetics and kinematics. Running in anti-pronation compared with neutral running shoes produced lower peak moments and powers in lower limb joints and better control in rear foot eversion. Physical fatigue increased peak moments and powers in lower limb joints irrespective of the type of footwear."
https://openalex.org/W2950194063,"The sterile insect technique (SIT) requires mass-rearing of the target species, irradiation to induce sexual sterility and transportation from the mass-rearing facility to the target site. Those treatments require several steps that may affect the biological quality of sterile males. This study has been carried out to evaluate the relative impact of chilling, irradiation and transport on emergence rate, flight ability and survival of sterile male Glossina palpalis gambiensis.Chilling, irradiation and transport all affected the quality control parameters studied. The emergence rate was significantly reduced by long chilling periods and transport, i.e. from 92% at the source insectary in Burkina Faso to 78% upon arrival in Senegal. Flight ability was affected by all three parameters with 31% operational flies lost between the production facility and the destination site. Only survival under stress was not affected by any of the treatments.The chilling period and transport were the main factors that impacted significantly the quality of sterile male pupae. Therefore, in the operational programme, the delivery of sterile male pupae was divided over two shipments per week to reduce the chilling time and improve the quality of the sterile males. Quality of the male pupae may further be improved by reducing the transport time and vibrations during transport."
https://openalex.org/W2946337651,"Reduced expression of 2′-3′-cyclic nucleotide 3′-phosphodiesterase (Cnp) in humans and mice causes white matter inflammation and catatonic signs. These consequences are experimentally alleviated by microglia ablation via colony-stimulating factor 1 receptor (CSF1R) inhibition using PLX5622. Here we address for the first time preclinical topics crucial for translation, most importantly 1) the comparison of 2 long-term PLX5622 applications (prevention and treatment) vs. 1 treatment alone, 2) the correlation of catatonic signs and executive dysfunction, 3) the phenotype of leftover microglia evading depletion, and 4) the role of intercellular interactions for efficient CSF1R inhibition. Based on our Cnp–/– mouse model and in vitro time-lapse imaging, we report the unexpected discovery that microglia surviving under PLX5622 display a highly inflammatory phenotype including aggressive premortal phagocytosis of oligodendrocyte precursor cells. Interestingly, ablating microglia in vitro requires mixed glial cultures, whereas cultured pure microglia withstand PLX5622 application. Importantly, 2 extended rounds of CSF1R inhibition are not superior to 1 treatment regarding any readout investigated (magnetic resonance imaging and magnetic resonance spectroscopy, behavior, immunohistochemistry). Catatonia-related executive dysfunction and brain atrophy of Cnp–/– mice fail to improve under PLX5622. To conclude, even though microglia depletion is temporarily beneficial and worth pursuing, complementary treatment strategies are needed for full and lasting recovery.—Fernandez Garcia-Agudo, L., Janova, H., Sendler, L.

Evidence for how best to implement PPI in research programmes, such as National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Collaborations for Applied Health Research and Care (CLAHRCs), remains limited. This paper reports findings from an action research (AR) project called IMPRESS, which aims to strengthen PPI within CLAHRC East of England (EoE). IMPRESS combines AR with Normalisation Process Theory (NPT) to explore PPI within diverse case study projects, identifying actions to implement, test and refine to further embed PPI.We purposively selected CLAHRC EoE case study projects for in-depth analysis of PPI using NPT. Data were generated from project PPI documentation, semi-structured qualitative interviews with researchers and PPI contributors and focus groups. Transcripts and documents were subjected to abductive thematic analysis and triangulation within case. Systematic across case comparison of themes was undertaken with findings and implications refined through stakeholder consultation.We interviewed 24 researchers and 13 PPI contributors and analysed 28 documents from 10 case studies. Three focus groups were held: two with researchers (n = 4 and n = 6) and one with PPI contributors (n = 5). Findings detail to what extent projects made sense of PPI, bought in to PPI, operationalised PPI and appraised it, thus identifying barriers and enablers to fully embedded PPI.Combining NPT with AR allows us to assess the embeddedness of PPI within projects and programme, to inform specific local action and report broader conceptual lessons for PPI knowledge and practice informing the development of an action framework for embedding PPI in research programmes. To embed PPI within similar programmes teams, professionals, disciplines and institutions should be recognised as variably networked into existing PPI support. Further focus and research is needed on sharing PPI learning and supporting innovation in PPI."
https://openalex.org/W2946670230,"We propose that the anthropomorphic application of gender stereotypes to animals influences human-animal interactions and human expectations, often with negative consequences for female animals. An online survey was conducted to explore riders’ perceptions of horse temperament and suitability for ridden work, based on horse sex. The questionnaire asked respondents to allocate three hypothetical horses (a mare, gelding and stallion) to four riders compromising a woman, man, girl and boy. Riders were described as equally capable of riding each horse and each horse was described as suitable for all riders. Participants were also asked which horses (mares, geldings or stallions) were most suitable for the three equestrian disciplines of show-jumping, dressage and trail-riding. Logistic regression analyses were conducted to investigate people’s perceptions about suitability of horse types for particular riders, to evaluate if age, strength or gender were important in rider choice and to investigate riders’ allocation of various descriptors to a gelding, stallion or mare. There were 1,233 survey respondents, 94% of whom were female and 75% of whom were riders with at least eight years of experience. Binomial logistic regression revealed the girl had 2.5 times the odds of being allocated the gelding compared to the boy (p < 0.001). Respondents were significantly more likely to allocate the stallion to the man and nearly 50% of respondents did not allocate a horse to the boy, even though they ranked rider gender as least important to their choice (p < 0.001). In a forced choice selection of a positive or negative descriptor from a series of nine paired terms to describe horse temperament, a greater proportion of respondents assigned geldings positive ratings on terms such as calm, trainable, reliable and predictable. In terms of suitability for the three equestrian disciplines of show-jumping, dressage and trail-riding, participants overwhelmingly chose geldings for trail-riding, with mares being least preferred for both dressage and show-jumping disciplines. The results suggest that female riders are entering the horse-human dyad with gendered ideas about horse temperament and view horse-riding as an activity primarily for women and girls. This could have far-reaching implications for equine training and welfare."
https://openalex.org/W2946539914,"Polytrauma (PT) is a life-threatening disease and a major global burden of injury. Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC) might be a therapeutic option for PT patients due to their anti-inflammatory and regenerative potential. We hypothesised that the inflammatory response of MSC is similar after exposure to selected trauma-relevant factors to sera from PT patients (PTS). Therefore, we investigated the effects of a mixture of defined factors, supposed to play a role on MSC in the early phase of PT. Additionally, in a translational approach we investigated the effect of serum from PT patients on MSC in vitro. MSC were incubated with a PT cocktail in physiological (PTCL) and supra-physiological (PTCH) concentrations or PTS. The effect on gene expression and protein secretion of MSC was analysed by RNA sequencing, ELISA and Multiplex assays of cell culture supernatant. Stimulation of MSC with PTCH, PTCL or IL1B led to significant up- or downregulation of 470, 183 and 469 genes compared to unstimulated MSC at 6 h. The intersection of differentially expressed genes in these groups was very high (92% overlap with regard to the PTCL group; treated for 6 h). Cytokine secretion profile of MSC revealed that IL1B mimics the effect of a more complex PT cocktail as well. However, there was only a minor proportion of overlapping differentially expressed genes between the MSC group stimulated with early times of PTS and the MSC group stimulated with PTCH, PTCL and IL1B. In conclusion, the effect of sera from PT patients on MSC activation cannot be simulated by the chosen trauma-relevant factors. Furthermore, we conclude that while IL1B might be useful to prime MSC prior to therapeutic application, it might not be as useful for the in vitro study of functional properties of MSC in the context of PT."

Patients were asked to tell of their experiences of living with advanced lung cancer. The emphasis of this study was the period of palliative tumour therapy.The main phenomenon of living with advanced lung cancer is the feeling of having to redefine one's own existence, such as social roles within and outside the family. The diagnosis trigger powerlessness, which can lead to information passivity, followed by acceptance of aggressive tumour treatment. Patients perceive a high degree of psychological and social stress, without being able to express this. There is a lack of regular appropriate psychosocial care accompanying chemotherapy. Patients ascribe their physical suffering to the side effects of tumour treatment, which may trigger a desire to die. Finally, patients tend to hide their individual needs, even when asked.Regarding the patients' needs, greater emphasis must be placed on psychosocial care as part of the biopsychosocial model to adequately consider the patients' concerns.

https://openalex.org/W2944866325,"Bradykinin (BK) and thromboxane-A2 (TX-A2) are two vasoactive mediators that modulate vascular tone and inflammation via binding to their cognate ""class A"" G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), BK-B2 receptors (B2R) and TX-prostanoid receptors (TP), respectively. Both BK and TX-A2 lead to ERK1/2-mediated vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) proliferation and/or hypertrophy. While each of B2R and TP could form functional dimers with various GPCRs, the likelihood that B2R-TP heteromerization could contribute to their co-regulation has never been investigated. The main objective of this study was to investigate the mode of B2R and TP interaction in VSMC, and its possible impact on downstream signaling. Our findings revealed synergistically activated ERK1/2 following co-stimulation of rat VSMC with a subthreshold dose of BK and effective doses of the TP stable agonist, IBOP, possibly involving biased agonist signaling. Single detection of each of B2R and TP in VSMC, using in-situ proximity ligation assay (PLA), provided evidence of the constitutive expression of nuclear and extranuclear B2R and TP. Moreover, inspection of B2R-TP PLA signals in VSMC revealed agonist-modulated nuclear and extranuclear proximity between B2R and TP, whose quantification varied substantially following single versus dual agonist stimulations. B2R-TP interaction was further verified by the findings of co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP) analysis of VSMC lysates. To our knowledge, this is the first study that provides evidence supporting the existence of B2R-TP heteromerization fingerprints in primary cultured VSMC."

It is observed that climate change is likely to increase the intensity and the frequency of floods and river basins have become more vulnerable to fluvial flooding. In this study, the impact of climate change on fluvial flooding was analyzed over the Adyar sub-basin. This study applied statistically downscaled Global Climate Model (GCM) data in a CMIP5 dataset of IPCC Assessment Report 5 (AR5). Based on the performance to simulate the observed climate, four GCMs, namely, cesm1-cam5, mpi-esm-mr, ncar-ccsm4, and bnu-esm, for RCP 4.5 were selected for projections of the future scenario. The Intensity-Duration-Frequency (IDF) curves for the past and future scenarios were derived from the IMD-observed and GCM-projected rainfall data. Integrated flood modeling was performed with hydrologic (HEC-HMS) and hydraulic (HEC-RAS) models. Finally, in order to visualize the inundation areas according to the future climate projection, flood inundation maps were prepared geospatially using the ArcGIS software. For the 100-year return period, the results predict that the peak discharge for the future climate scenario would increase by 34.3%–91.9% as compared to the present climate scenario. Similarly, the future projections show an increase in the flooded area ranging from 12.6% to 26.4% based on GCMs. This simulation helps in understanding the flood risk over the Adyar sub-basin under the changing climate and the requirement for the regulation of developmental activities over the flood-prone areas."
https://openalex.org/W2944817403,"Background Headache is one of the most common complaints among pediatric patients and can be due to many causes, some benign but others potentially seriously. Increased intracranial pressure, which is known to cause papilledema, is a serious cause of headache, and immediate diagnosis is critical, although difficult. The current study evaluates the diagnostic value of optic nerve sheath diameter (ONSD) and eyeball transverse diameter (ETD) ratio in pediatric patients presenting with headache and papilledema. Methods A retrospective analysis of all pediatric patients undergoing head computed tomography scans between January 2013 and December 2015. Patients with normal brain scans were included in the study. Patients presenting with headache underwent funduscopic evaluation and grouped as either headache with papilledema or headache without papilledema. A control group of patients without headache was also included. Studies were reviewed blindly by a neuroradiologist and ONSD and ETD for both eyes were measured. Results ONSD/ETD index was found to have significantly higher values (p<0.001) in patients with papilledema (median 0.24, interquartile range (IQR) = 0.22–0.25) compared to patients without papilledema (median 0.18, IQR = 0.16–0.19) and the control group (median 0.17, IQR = 0.15–0.18). The ONSD/ETD index showed excellent discrimination ability for patients with headache and papilledema (AUC = 0.96, 95% CI, 0.94–0.99). The ONSD/ETD index of 0.21 was found to have a sensitivity and specificity of 82% and 93%, respectively, for identifying pediatric patients with headache and papilledema. Conclusion Our study shows that ONSD/ETD index of 0.21 can be used as an easy-to-use reference tool for diagnosing papilledema and elevated intracranial pressure in pediatric patients."
https://openalex.org/W2945837192,"Understanding changes in wave attenuation by emergent vegetation as wetlands degrade or accrete over time is crucial for incorporation of wetlands into holistic coastal risk management. Linked SLAMM and XBeach models were used to investigate potential future changes in wave attenuation over a 50-year period in a degrading, subtropical wetland and a prograding, temperate wetland. These contrasting systems also have differing management contexts and were contrasted to demonstrate how the linked models can provide management-relevant insights. Morphological development of wetlands for different scenarios of sea-level rise and accretion was simulated with SLAMM and then coupled with different vegetation characteristics to predict the influence on future wave attenuation using XBeach. The geomorphological context, subsidence, and accretion resulted in large predicted reductions in the extent of vegetated land (e.g., wetland) and changes in wave height reduction potential across the wetland. These were exacerbated by increases in sea-level from +0.217 m to +0.386 m over a 50-year period, especially at the lowest accretion rates in the degrading wetland. Mangrove vegetation increased wave attenuation within the degrading, subtropical, saline wetland, while grazing reduced wave attenuation in the temperate, prograding wetland. Coastal management decisions and actions, related to coastal vegetation type and structure, have the potential to change future wave attenuation at a spatial scale relevant to coastal protection planning. Therefore, a coastal management approach that includes disaster risk reduction, biodiversity, and climate change, can be informed by coastal modeling tools, such as those demonstrated here for two contrasting case studies."
https://openalex.org/W2946709916,"Introduction Low back pain (LBP) is highly prevalent in Nigeria and is more devastating in rural Nigeria due to adverse living and working conditions, reinforced by maladaptive illness beliefs. There is a need to develop measures for assessing such beliefs in this population. This study aimed to cross-culturally adapt the Fear Avoidance Beliefs Questionnaire (FABQ) and test its psychometric properties in mixed rural and urban Nigerian populations with chronic LBP. Methods Translation, cultural adaptation, test–retest, and cross-sectional psychometric testing. FABQ was forward and back translated by clinical/non-clinical translators. A review committee evaluated the translations. Twelve people with chronic LBP in a rural Nigerian community pre-tested the questionnaire. Cronbach’s alpha assessing internal consistency; intra-class correlation coefficient and Bland–Altman plots assessing test–retest reliability; and minimal detectable change were investigated in a convenient sample of 50 chronic low back pain sufferers in rural and urban Nigeria. Construct validity was examined using Pearson’s correlation analyses with the eleven-point box scale and Igbo Roland Morris Disability Questionnaire (Igbo-RMDQ), and exploratory factor analysis in a random sample of 200 adults with chronic low back pain in rural Nigeria. Ceiling and floor effects were investigated in all samples. Results Amendments allowed interviewer-administration. Item 8 was modified to ‘I have a compensation or gains I get from having my pain’ as there is no benefit system in Nigeria. Igbo phrase for ‘physical activity’ could also mean ‘being active’, ‘moving the body’ or ‘moving about’ and was used in the items with ‘physical activity’. The Igbo-FABQ had good internal consistency (α = 0.80–0.86); intra class correlation coefficients (ICC = 0.71–0.72); standard error of measurements (3.21–7.40) and minimal detectable change (8.90–20.51). It correlated moderately with pain intensity and disability, with a two-factor structure and no floor and ceiling effects. Conclusions Igbo-FABQ is valid, reliable, and can be used clinically and for research."
https://openalex.org/W2946639897,"Outbred rats display variable preferences for bittersweet solutions, expressed as preference or avoidance of high concentrations of artificial sweeteners over water. This may reflect individual differences in appetitive/aversive conflict processing that may have predictive validity for disorders of motivation. Here we use a homecage two-bottle choice procedure to examine the test/retest stability and between-tastant consistency in sucralose preference to determine the reliability of bittersweet taste preference. Sucralose is a non-caloric artificial sweetener that is preferred by some rats and avoided by others. We sought to determine whether sucralose preference is consistent with preference of sucrose/quinine solutions that have known sweet and bitter taste qualities, respectively. We give fluid restricted rats 45-minutes homecage access to water and ascending concentrations of sucralose (SUCRA; 0.0025-10mM) or a compound solution of sucrose (116mM) + quinine (0.002-2mM) (SQ). We use a within-subject counterbalanced design (SUCRA or SQ testing) to determine preference of each bittersweet solution relative to water. We observed individual variability in preference for SUCRA and SQ, such that some rats preferred bittersweet solutions over water (preferring) while other rats preferred water over bittersweet solutions (avoiding). Within tastant, this preference remained stable across repeated testing. Between solutions, SUCRA preference scores correlated with SQ scores, suggesting consistent taste conflict processing for both bittersweet solutions. Population level analyses confirmed that preference generalizes across bittersweet solutions, and that rats’ preferences for bittersweet solutions relative to water are stable over time. The test/retest and between-tastant reliability of this taste conflict screening procedure support the potential utility of this model for exploring individual variability in appetitive/aversive conflict processes mediating motivated behavior."

Electrocardiogram, non-invasive photoplethysmographic arterial pressure (AP) and respiratory signals were recorded at rest at left lateral decubitus (REST) and during active standing (STAND) for 10 minutes. The heart period (HP) variability and systolic AP (SAP) variability were assessed in the frequency domain. High frequency (HF) and low frequency (LF) spectral indexes were computed. Nonlinear indexes such as symbolic markers (0V%, 1V%, 2LV% and 2UV% indexes), Shannon entropy (SE) and normalized complexity index (NCI) were calculated as well. Baroreflex control was assessed by cross-spectral HP-SAP analysis. We computed baroreflex sensitivity (BRS), HP-SAP squared coherence (K2) and phase in LF and HF bands.At REST, the PG had lower mean, variance and HF power of HP series and lower K2(LF), BRS(LF) and BRS(HF) than the CG. During STAND, CG and PG decreased the mean, CI, NCI and 2UV% and increased 0V% of the HP series and augmented the SAP variance. LFabs of SAP series increased during STAND solely in CG. BRS(HF) was reduced during in both PG and CG, while HFabs of HP series did not diminish during STAND either in PG or CG. Complexity of the autonomic control was similar in PG and CG regardless of the experimental condition.We conclude that the second trimester of pregnancy was characterized by a lower parasympathetic modulation and reduced BRS at REST, preserved complexity of cardiac and vascular controls, limited sympathetic response to STAND and general conservation of the baroreflex responses to posture changes.Begistro Brasileiro de Ensaios clínicos, Number: RBR-9s8t88."

During this same period, ambulatory relapse treatment increased by 5.8% while hospitalizations decreased by 2.6%. Patients with a moderate EDSS score (3.5–6) had the highest average cost (p<0.0001) compared to mild and severe EDSS scores. Conclusions Multiple sclerosis has been a significant economic burden on the Kuwait healthcare system. DMTs are the main driver of cost."
https://openalex.org/W2945154539,"Silicone is used widely for tissue augmentation in humans. However, late complications, such as delayed inflammation and capsular contracture, remain uncharacterized, despite their importance. In the present study, we aimed to determine whether mechanical and thermal damage induce capsular inflammation around a foreign body, and elucidate the biological mechanism underlying this phenomenon. We injected silicone into the subcutaneous layer of the skin of New Zealand white rabbits. The rabbits were divided into two groups: the control group received no treatment; in the experimental group, external force was applied near the injection silicone using high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU). Tissues near the injected silicone were harvested from both groups on Days 4, 7, and 30 after HIFU treatment for comparative analysis. Visual and histological examinations showed clearly increased inflammation in the experimental group compared with that in the control group. Furthermore, capsular tissue from the experimental group displayed markedly increased collagen production. Immunofluorescence revealed marked activation of macrophages in the early stages of inflammation (Days 4 and 7 after HIFU treatment), which decreased on Day 30. Assessment of cytokine activation showed significantly increased expression of heat shock protein (HSP)27, HSP60, HSP70, toll-like receptor (TLR)2, TLR4, and interleukin-8 in the experimental group. The expression of transforming growth factor-β1 did not increase significantly in the experimental group. In conclusion, damage to tissues around the injected silicone induced capsular inflammation. Macrophages and damage-associated molecular pattern molecules were involved in the early stages of inflammation. HSP release activated TLRs, which subsequently activated innate immunity and induced the inflammatory response."
https://openalex.org/W2945572523,"In recent years, communities and institutions have sought new interventions intended to reduce sugar sweetened beverage (SSB) consumption among children. Among these interventions are “SSB-free zones,” where such beverages are not permitted to be consumed on the premises. Insufficient knowledge still exists, however, about the readiness for such restrictive SSB policies within health care institutions. Understanding attitudes toward SSB consumption among adults is necessary to guide an institution-wide policy, where staff and patients serve as role models for parents and their children. We conducted focus groups with health center patients and staff to determine perceptions surrounding health and SSB consumption and to better understand the support and readiness (or lack thereof) for an SSB-free zone intervention prior to its implementation. We found that contextual practices present challenges to breaking personal consumption habits, even if beverages are banned from the worksite. Nevertheless, participants expressed support for SSB-free zones, and recommended more education about the harmful effects of soda and energy drink consumption to help improve acceptability for the policy. We conclude that policies restricting onsite SSB consumption may be more effective when combined with educational information and expressions of understanding that this specific behavior change can be difficult."
https://openalex.org/W2945605443,"Fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM) can assess cell's metabolism through the fluorescence of the co-enzymes NADH and FAD, which exhibit a double-exponential decay, with components related to free and protein-bound conditions. In vivo real time clinical imaging applications demand fast acquisition. As photodamage limits excitation power, this is best achieved using wide-field techniques, like time-gated FLIM, and algorithms that require few images to calculate the decay parameters. The rapid lifetime determination (RLD) algorithm requires only four images to analyze a double-exponential decay. Using computational simulations, we evaluated the accuracy and precision of RLD when measuring endogenous fluorescence lifetimes and metabolic free to protein-bound ratios, for total counts per pixel (TC) lower than 104. The simulations were based on a time-gated FLIM instrument, accounting for its instrument response function, gain and noise. While the optimal acquisition setting depends on the values being measured, the accuracy of the free to protein-bound ratio α2/α1 is stable for low gains and gate separations larger than 1000 ps, while its precision is almost constant for gate separations between 1500 and 2500 ps. For the gate separations and free to protein-bound ratios considered, the accuracy error can be as high as 30% and the precision error can reach 60%. Precision errors lower than 10% cannot be obtained. The best performance occurs for low camera gains and gate separations near 1800 ps. When considering the narrow physiological ranges for the free to protein-bound ratio, the precision errors can be confined to an interval between 10% and 20%. RLD is a valid option when for real time FLIM. The simulations and methodology presented here can be applied to any time-gated FLIM instrument and are useful to obtain the accuracy and precision limits for RLD in the demanding conditions of TC lower than 104."
https://openalex.org/W2945218535,"Introduction Only a few, large population-based studies, have reported on whiplash-associated disorder (WAD). However, none of them have investigated the influence of crash severity on WAD outcome. In the present study, we aimed to determine whether crash severity predicts outcomes among patients with no-fault government insurance for acute WAD. Methods We utilized data from a compulsory, no-fault government automobile liability insurance agency in Japan. Individuals involved in a car accident between April 2001 and June 2015 with residual disabilities reported at the end of the treatment between October 2014 and September 2015 were included. Crash severity was assessed based on property damage costs, size of the other vehicle (large car, medium car, small car, or two-wheeled vehicles), and collision types (rear-end collision, contact with vehicle moving in the same direction, or in the opposite direction). Outcomes included the time to claim closure and the number of treatment visits. Results We analyzed data for a total of 52,251 individuals (28,571 male and 23,680 female) with a median age of 44 years (range: 2–95 years). The median time to claim closure was 220 days (range: 1–4,938 days), and the median number of treatment visits was 102 (range: 1–2,492). There was no significant association between outcomes and property damage costs or size of the other vehicle. Collision types exhibited no consistent association with outcomes. However, older age and affected body parts, in addition to the neck, were independent risk factors for delayed claim closure and a large number of visits, although, all odds ratios were low (often less than 2.0). Conclusions There was no obvious association of outcomes with property damage costs, size of the other vehicle, or collision types in acute WAD patients. Further studies should investigate the influence of psychological factors, compensation systems, and cultural conditions."
https://openalex.org/W2945398934,"Background Alternans have been associated with the development of ventricular fibrillation and its control has been proposed as antiarrhythmic strategy. However, cardiac arrhythmias are a spatiotemporal phenomenon in which multiple factors are involved (e.g. calcium and voltage spatial alternans or heterogeneous conduction velocity) and how an antiarrhythmic drug modifies these factors is poorly understood. Objective The objective of the present study is to evaluate the relation between spatial electrophysiological properties (i.e. spatial discordant alternans and conduction velocity) and the induction of ventricular fibrillation (VF) when a calcium blocker is applied. Methods The mechanisms of initiation of VF were studied by simultaneous epicardial voltage and calcium optical mapping in isolated rabbit hearts using an incremental fast pacing protocol. The additional value of analyzing spatial phenomena in the generation of unidirectional blocks and reentries as precursors of VF was depicted. Specifically, the role of action potential duration (APD), calcium transients (CaT), spatial alternans and conduction velocity in the initiation of VF was evaluated during basal conditions and after the administration of verapamil. Results Our results enhance the relation between (1) calcium spatial alternans and (2) slow conduction velocities with the dynamic creation of unidirectional blocks that allowed the induction of VF. In fact, the administration of verapamil demonstrated that calcium and not voltage spatial alternans were the main responsible for VF induction. Conclusions VF induction at high activation rates was linked with the concurrence of a low conduction velocity and high magnitude of calcium alternans, but not necessarily related with increases of APD. Verapamil can postpone the development of cardiac alternans and the apparition of ventricular arrhythmias."
https://openalex.org/W2946290816,"A robust and stratified pre-clinical natural knee model, which has the capability to more appropriately simulate the biomechanical environment in vivo, will deliver more efficient and reliable assessment of soft tissue interventions before clinical studies. In order to simulate the biomechanical function of the natural knee without the natural ligaments in place, there is a requirement to develop appropriate spring constraints for the natural knee model. Therefore, this study was to investigate the effect of spring constraints on the function and output of the natural porcine knee model, and determine the spring constraint which most closely replicated the function of the natural ligaments. Two linear compression springs with stiffnesses of 9 N/mm (spring-9) and 20 N/mm (spring-20) were set at different free lengths in the anterior-posterior (A/P) axis in a natural knee simulator. The kinematic (A/P displacement) and tribological properties (shear force) output of the simulator were compared at different spring settings. The most appropriate spring setting was determined by comparing the A/P displacement and shear force output at different spring settings with those of the all ligaments model. Spring-9 with a free length of 4 mm showed the minimal difference (-0.03±0.68 mm) in A/P displacement output and spring-20 with a free length of 5 mm showed the minimal difference (-0.10±0.73 mm) in A/P displacement output compared to the all ligament control. There was no statistical difference between the two minimal differences either in A/P displacement or in shear force (paired t-test, p = 0.58, and p = 0.68 respectively) when both spring settings matched most closely to the A/P kinematics of the intact knee. This indicated that both conditions were appropriate spring constraints settings in the A/P direction for the natural porcine knee model."
https://openalex.org/W2946368850,"Children attending kindergarten are at high risk for contracting infections, for which hand hygiene (HH) has been recognized as the most cost-effective prevention measure globally. Kindergarten teachers’ HH behavior plays a vital role in encouraging favorable hygiene techniques and environment. This study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of a multimodal intervention at changing kindergarten teachers’ HH behavior and social cognitive factors that influences HH behavior in China. The intervention named “Clean Hands, Happy Life” includes HH products with refills, reminders and cues for action, a kick-off event with awards, and training programs. We evaluated the intervention using a self-administrative questionnaire with a stratified random sample of 12 kindergartens. Two surveys was completed by 176 teachers at baseline and 185 after the 6-month intervention. Compared with the baseline scores, there was a significant improvement in the overall self-reported HH compliance of teachers (9.38 vs. 9.68 out of 10, p = 0.006), as well as teachers’ perceived disease susceptibility, disease severity and behavioral control after the intervention (p<0.05). We found that teachers’ HH compliance was likely to be higher among those who have better HH guideline awareness (β = 0.48, p<0.01) and perceived behavioral control (β = 0.26, p = 0.01), which explained 24.2% of the variance of self-reported compliance of teachers at baseline. The assessed intervention may provide Chinese kindergarten teachers with behavioral skills and cognitions that associated with the compliance of HH behavior. We thus recommend future intervention studies consider our HH behavior change techniques, address multiple social cognitive determinants of HH behavior and include the change of targeted influences in the impact evaluation."
https://openalex.org/W2944841863,"Introduction Lahe Township belongs to Myanmar`s Naga Self-administered Zone, which is one of the most remote and mountainous areas in Myanmar. However, the limited health data available for the region suggests that there could be neglected health needs that require attention. The purpose of this study was to assess the health status of the population of Lahe Township. Methods A cross-sectional study design incorporating a two-stage cluster sampling methodology recommended by the WHO was used to conduct a household level survey. In the first stage, 30 village clusters were selected from all villages situated in the Lahe Township through systematic sampling with probability of selection proportional to the population size of each village based on the 2014 Myanmar census. In the second stage, a GPS-based sampling method was used to select 30 households within a village cluster. The head of the household completed the survey for all members of the household. Questionnaires inquired about maternal health, mortality, morbidities, childhood nutritional status, access to health care, and water & sanitation. The resulting data was stratified by urban/rural status. Results Data was collected on 5,929 individuals living in 879 households, of which 993 individuals (16.7%) were children 5 years old or younger. The median age was 18.0 (IQR 8.0–35.0). Children 15 years old or younger represented 44.7% of the population. 19.8% of households reported at least 1 household member sick during the previous 30 days. The crude mortality rate per 10,000 people per day was 0.58 (95% CI: 0.48–0.69). The under 5 mortality per 10,000 people per day was 0.74 (95% CI: 0.50–1.06). Only 46.7% of households could access a hospital if there was a need. Conclusion Our results demonstrate a high rate of mortality and the inability to access healthcare in Lahe Township, which should be addressed to prevent further deterioration of health."
https://openalex.org/W2945221309,"The reliance of the aquafeed industry on marine resources has to be reduced by innovative approaches in fish nutrition. Thus, a three-factorial approach (fish oil reduced diet, phytochemical genistein, and temperature reduction) was chosen to investigate the interaction of effects on growth performance and tissue omega-3 long chain polyunsaturated fatty acid (LC-PUFA) levels in juvenile sea bream (Sparus aurata, 12.5 ± 2.2 g). Genistein is a phytoestrogen with estrogen-like activity and thus LC-PUFA increasing potential. A decrease in the rearing temperature was chosen based on the positive effects of low temperature on fish lipid quality. The experimental diets were reduced in marine ingredients and had a fish oil content of either 6% dry matter (DM; F6: positive control) or 2% DM (F2: negative control) and were administered in the plain variant or with inclusion of 0.15% DM genistein (F6 + G and F2 + G). The feeding trial was performed simultaneously at 23°C and 19°C. The results indicated that solely temperature had a significant effect on growth performance and whole body nutrient composition of sea bream. Nevertheless, the interaction of all three factors significantly affected the fatty acid compositions of liver and fillet tissue. Most importantly, they led to a significant increase by 4.3% of fillet LC-PUFA content in sea bream fed with the diet F6 + G in comparison to control fish fed diet F6, when both groups were held at 19°C. It is hypothesized that genistein can act via estrogen-like as well as other mechanisms and that the dietary LC-PUFA content may impact its mode of action. Temperature most likely exhibited its effects indirectly via altered growth rates and metabolism. Although effects of all three factors and of genistein in particular were only marginal, they highlight a possibility to utilize the genetic capacity of sea bream to improve tissue lipid quality."
https://openalex.org/W2946727167,"Substrate tolerance of bacterial cyclases has been demonstrated in various contexts, but little is known about that of plant cyclases. Here, we tested two plant ε-cyclases to convert C50-lycopene, which we previously established by rounds of directed evolution. Unlike bacterial β-cyclases, two-end cyclase from lettuce exhibited complete specificity against this molecule, indicating that this enzyme has some mechanism that exerts size-specificity. Arabidopsis one-end cyclase At-y2 showed detectable activity to C50-lycopene. Interestingly, we found that it functions as a two-end cyclase in a C50 context. Based on this observation, a possible model for substrate discrimination of this enzyme is proposed."
https://openalex.org/W2945775110,"How the brain makes sense of a complicated environment is an important question, and a first step is to be able to reconstruct the stimulus that give rise to an observed brain response. Neural coding relates neurobiological observations to external stimuli using computational methods. Encoding refers to how a stimulus affects the neuronal output, and entails constructing a neural model and parameter estimation. Decoding refers to reconstruction of the stimulus that led to a given neuronal output. Existing decoding methods rarely explain neuronal responses to complicated stimuli in a principled way. Here we perform neural decoding for a mixture of multiple stimuli using the leaky integrate-and-fire model describing neural spike trains, under the visual attention hypothesis of probability mixing in which the neuron only attends to a single stimulus at any given time. We assume either a parallel or serial processing visual search mechanism when decoding multiple simultaneous neurons. We consider one or multiple stochastic stimuli following Ornstein-Uhlenbeck processes, and dynamic neuronal attention that switches following discrete Markov processes. To decode stimuli in such situations, we develop various sequential Monte Carlo particle methods in different settings. The likelihood of the observed spike trains is obtained through the first-passage time probabilities obtained by solving the Fokker-Planck equations. We show that the stochastic stimuli can be successfully decoded by sequential Monte Carlo, and different particle methods perform differently considering the number of observed spike trains, the number of stimuli, model complexity, etc. The proposed novel decoding methods, which analyze the neural data through psychological visual attention theories, provide new perspectives to understand the brain."
https://openalex.org/W2946203281,"Evidence has indicated that viral infection increases the risk of developing asthma. Although the association of human parvovirus B19 (B19V) or human bocavirus (HBoV) with respiratory diseases has been reported, little is known about the influence of the B19V-VP1u and HBoV-VP1u proteins on the symptoms of asthma. Herein, we investigated the systemic influence of subcutaneously injected B19V-VP1u and HBoV-VP1u recombinant proteins in an OVA-sensitized asthmatic mouse model. A significantly higher Penh ratio and IgE level were detected in the serum, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) and the supernatant of a lymphocyte culture from mice treated with HBoV-VP1u or B19V-VP1u than in a lymphocyte culture from OVA-sensitized mice. Significantly higher levels of serum and BALF IgE, total IgG, IgG1, OVA-specific IgE and OVA-specific IgG1 were detected in mice treated with HBoV-VP1u or B19V-VP1u than in OVA-sensitized mice. Conversely, a significantly lower IgG2a level was detected in mice from the HBoV-VP1u or B19V-VP1u groups than in mice from the OVA group. The mice treated with HBoV-VP1u or B19V-VP1u exhibited more significant lung inflammatory indices, including elevated serum and BALF IL-4, IL-5, IL-10 and IL-13 levels; BALF lymphocyte, neutrophil and eosinophil counts, MMP-9 and MMP-2 activity; and the amount of lymphocyte infiltration, relative to those in the control mice or in those sensitized with OVA. These findings demonstrate that the subcutaneous injection of HBoV-VP1u or B19V-VP1u proteins in OVA-sensitized mice result in elevated asthmatic indices and suggest that human parvoviruses may increase the risk of developing airway inflammation in a mouse model of asthma."
https://openalex.org/W2945993398,"Our aim was to develop a risk stratification model to predict the presence of a potentially more sinister injury in patients exposed to a whiplash trauma.The study base comprised of 3,115 residents who first sought healthcare contact within one week after being exposed to a whiplash trauma between 1999-2008, from within a defined geographical area, Skaraborg County in south-western Sweden. Information about gender, age, time elapsed prior to seeking care, type of health care contact, and hospitalisation was retrieved. Seventeen potential risk factors were identified and evaluated using multivariable logistic regression.Of 3,115 patients, 215 (6.9%) required hospital admission so theoretically 93% could have been initially assessed by primary health care. However, only 46% had their first contact in primary health care. All patients had symptoms resulting in a diagnosis of whiplash injury. Four risk factors were found to be associated with hospital admission: commotio cerebri (OR 31, 19-51), fracture / luxation (OR 11, 5.1-22), serious injury (OR 41, 8.0-210), and the patient sought care during the same day as the trauma (OR 5.9, 3.7-9.5). These four risk factors explained 27% of the variation for hospital admission and the area under curve (AUC) was 0.77 (0.74-0.80). Ninety-six percent of patients (2,985) had only a whiplash injury with no other injury. These could be split into those attending health care the same day as the trauma, 1,737 (56%) with a 7.1% risk for hospital admission, and those attending health care later, 1,248 (40%) with a 1.3% risk for hospital admission.Patients with no signs of commotio cerebri, no fracture/luxation injury, no serious injury, comprising 96% of all patients exposed to a whiplash trauma can initially be referred to primary health care for initial assessment. However, those contacting the health care the same day as the trauma should be referred to a hospital for evaluation if they can't get an appointment with a general practitioner the same day."
