https://openalex.org/W1568303348,"PATTLE1 first noted the stability of bubbles formed in the foam expressed from lungs of mature animals and the lack of stability in material from fœtal lungs. Clements2 emphasized the importance of a bubblestabilizing factor, that is, a surfactant, in the prevention of atelectasis. Lungs from human fœtuses of less than 1,000 gm. usually lack the surfactant characteristic of older fœtuses3; occasionally, lessmature fœtuses possess lung stability4."

The historical development of this area of research is described. The kinds of tracer experiments using Carbon-14 which were used in developing initial understandings of the pathways which make up the photosynthesis process are described. The biochemical pathways which make up the photosynthetic process are diagrammed. The organisms used in these experiments (Chlorella) and the rationale for their use are described. 24 references, 23 figures."

https://openalex.org/W2042162617,"Newborn albino rats were trained according to classical conditioning procedure wih one of four intervals between conditioned and unconditioned stimuli. A vibrotactile stimulus (conditioned stimulus) paired with an electric shock (unconditioned stimulus) was presented to the forelimb 80 times. The results demonstrate that conditioning takes place in newborn rats. However, levels of performance as a function of time intervals between stimuli did not resemble the levels traditionally reported for older animals."

https://openalex.org/W2030108065,"The amount of ecdysone extracted from Bombyx mori rose precipitously immediately before, and fell immediately after, transition from the larval to the pupal stage, and thereafter a secondary rise in titer was observed. These observations correlate very well with physiologic sequences of metamorphosis, critical period, and oxygen uptake."

https://openalex.org/W2038015757,"In investigating the possibility of producing food by large-scale culture of plant tissue, several plant tissues were used. The yield for carrot tissue, which is especially capable of rapid growth, was an average of 4.6 grams per liter per day in 6 liters of medium. The results suggest that with improved techniques food could be produced by this method."

https://openalex.org/W2081762168,"PROSIMIAN Primates are a group of animals which share characteristics of behaviour, anatomy, biochemistry, cytogenetics, and physiology with the monkeys on one hand and the more primitive Insectivora on the other1. We have been examining the hæmoglobins of a number of these animals. One of our most interesting discoveries is the relatively high level of alkali-resistant hæmoglobin found in these animals."
https://openalex.org/W2029814457,"THE sudden onset of clinical hypomagnesæmia in the lactating cow most commonly occurs soon after the change from stall feeding to grazing fresh spring grass, and in the absence of any marked reduction in intake of magnesium. This condition is probably brought about by reduced absorption of magnesium; but the reasons for this are not fully understood. Marked reductions in output of urinary magnesium on changing the diet from hay or grass nuts to fresh grass have been described for sheep1 in spite of increased intakes of magnesium; this probably indicates reduced absorption. Care2 recently calculated that a 50 per cent reduction in absorption could lead to the development of hypomagnesæmia within 7 days in sheep."

https://openalex.org/W1981442954,A substance that significantly depresses liver catalase values when injected into mice has been isolated from biochemical mutants of yeasts and staphylococci with impaired respiration. This is considered as an important argument in support of the Warburg hypothesis on the origin of cancer cells.
https://openalex.org/W2034389256,"Neither pain threshold nor the capacity to discriminate intensity of mild pain was significantly altered during simultaneous stimulation by intense ""white"" noise. These observations indicate that the reported clinical usefulness of such auditory stimulation during painful therapeutic procedures does not result from an alteration in the capacity to perceive pain."
https://openalex.org/W2029540513,"ANIMALS acclimatized to cold have been shown to maintain their deep body temperature at normal levels under conditions cold enough to induce hypothermia in unacclimatized animals1,2. Similar studies on men presumed to be acclimatized have given conflicting results. Some investigations3,4 have suggested that there is an improved ability to maintain rectal temperature, others5,6 have shown no change, while yet another7 has shown a diminished ability to maintain rectal temperature. Such conflicting findings have led some workers to the conclusion that man does not acclimatize to cold, possibly for the reason that he is rarely exposed to sufficient cold stress to induce acclimatization. It was therefore thought desirable to investigate the effect of residence in the seasonally varying but always cold climate of Antarctica on men's responses to a test cold exposure."

https://openalex.org/W2037506027,"THE geographical distribution of erythrocyte glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency is now-known to be widespread. Thus, this genetically determined enzyme defect has been shown to be present in parts of Africa, Asia and Europe, and in some Indian groups in South America1. Marked variations in the incidence of the defect have been observed between different populations and in some instances between different groups in the same population. In south-east Asia recent work has shown the trait to be present in Thais2, Malays2a, Indonesians (Lie-Injo, L. E., personal communication), Filipinos3 and Melanesians4."

https://openalex.org/W1967859467,"WE reported recently that the proportions of aneuploid cells in cultures of human blood cells increased approximately in proportion to the age of the subject1. Some of the cells observed to have chromosome numbers less than normal are likely to have been artefacts. There was, however, evidence that others were genuinely abnormal, and it was concluded that the increase of abnormal cells with age indicates either a real increase in the number of aneuploid cells in the body or an increased liability to abnormal cell division. In either case it was possible that the finding was related to the increase in incidence that occurs with age in most types of cancer."

https://openalex.org/W2035465439,"The fading of in vivo luminescence which is characteristically displayed by resting cell suspensions of the luminous bacteria Photobacterium fischeri is partly accounted for by a gradual loss of active luciferase. This luminescence is further diminished by exposure of such suspensions to gamma radiation, but the irradiated cells yield more, rather than less, active luciferase than do cells of the non-irradiated suspension. These and similar results with menadione-treated cells indicate that, while luciferase is gradually inactivated by its catalysis of light production, it can resist inactivation by radiation better than can some component of its supporting metabolism."
https://openalex.org/W2045974545,"IT has been found that, in the laboratory, old female Glossina morsitans Westw. show a considerably greater tolerance to some chlorinated hydrocarbon insecticides than do the young flies of both sexes, and in particular that pregnant flies show an exceptional degree of tolerance. Complete log-dosage/probit-mortality regression lines have been determined for dieldrin (Table 1)."
https://openalex.org/W1966935636,A NUMBER of human tumours have been found to grow in cortisone or hydrocortisone-treated weanling rats and in hamsters. Growth cannot be obtained without the use of cortisone or adrenocorticotrophic hormone. It is well known that these animals develop an immunity against the implanted tumour.

https://openalex.org/W2048466579,The reactions for the diagnosis of pregnancy by the use of urine from patients who are receiving tranquilizing drugs of the phenothiazine group have given false positive results when performed in the North American frog Rana pipiens. Such false positive reactions are not obtained when the South American toad Bufo arenarum is used.

https://openalex.org/W1974444268,"A rapid and highly efficient ultrafiltration apparatus has been devised from readily available laboratory materials costing less than $5. Employing a fritted glass tube to support an evacuated dialysis bag, it accommodates as little as 1 milliliter and is ideally suited to dialysis of small volumes and concentration of macromolecules for chromatography and electrophoresis."

https://openalex.org/W2048646621,"HISTOCHEMICAL investigations, using the ferric hydroxyquinoline method of Fishman and Baker1, indicate that the β-glucuronidase of the fully established rat placenta is predominantly fœtal. As early as the 9-day stage there is moderate activity in the embryonic structures. At 11 days an intense reaction is obtained in the endoderm of the visceral yolk sac, in the trophoblast and giant cells of the central zone and ectoplacental cone and in the endovascular plasmodium growing into the decidual arteries. The activity of the visceral yolk sac remains high, with a terminal drop in the last two or three days of pregnancy. The giant cells, the junctional zone trophoblast and the endovascular plasmodium, with the exception of the glycogen cells, retain a high activity until about the 19th day, but the labyrinthine activity begins to fall off at about 15 days. By the 22-day stage the reaction in all the trophoblastic structures is greatly reduced."
