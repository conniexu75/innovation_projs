https://openalex.org/W2415710521,"Quantum computers can solve certain problems more efficiently than any possible conventional computer. Small quantum algorithms have been demonstrated on multiple quantum computing platforms, many specifically tailored in hardware to implement a particular algorithm or execute a limited number of computational paths. Here, we demonstrate a five-qubit trapped-ion quantum computer that can be programmed in software to implement arbitrary quantum algorithms by executing any sequence of universal quantum logic gates. We compile algorithms into a fully-connected set of gate operations that are native to the hardware and have a mean fidelity of 98 %. Reconfiguring these gate sequences provides the flexibility to implement a variety of algorithms without altering the hardware. As examples, we implement the Deutsch-Jozsa (DJ) and Bernstein-Vazirani (BV) algorithms with average success rates of 95 % and 90 %, respectively. We also perform a coherent quantum Fourier transform (QFT) on five trappedion qubits for phase estimation and period finding with average fidelities of 62 % and 84 %, respectively. This small quantum computer can be scaled to larger numbers of qubits within a single register, and can be further expanded by connecting several such modules through ion shuttling or photonic quantum channels."

https://openalex.org/W2501174056,"NADPH oxidases (NOXs) are involved in inflammation, angiogenesis, tumor growth, and osteoclast differentiation. However, the role of NOX1 and NOX2 in macrophage differentiation and tumor progression is still elusive. Here we report that NOX1 and NOX2 are critical for the differentiation of monocytes to macrophages, the polarization of M2-type but not M1-type macrophages, and the occurrence of tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs). We found that deletion of both NOX1 and NOX2 led to a dramatic decrease in ROS production in macrophages and resulted in impaired efficiency in monocyte-to-macrophage differentiation and M2-type macrophage polarization. We further showed that NOX1 and NOX2 were critical for the activation of the MAPKs JNK and ERK during macrophage differentiation and that the deficiency of JNK and ERK activation was responsible for the failure of monocyte-to-macrophage differentiation, in turn affecting M2 macrophage polarization. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the decrease in M2 macrophages and TAMs, concomitant with the reduction of cytokine and chemokine secretion, contributed to the delay in wound healing and the inhibition of tumor growth and metastasis in NOX1/2 double knockout mice compared with WT mice. Collectively, these data provide direct evidence that NOX1 and NOX2 deficiency impairs macrophage differentiation and the occurrence of M2-type TAMs during tumor development."
https://openalex.org/W2503584987,"Emerging evidence suggests that n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) promote brown adipose tissue thermogenesis. However, the underlying mechanisms remain elusive. Here, we hypothesize that n-3 PUFA promotes brown adipogenesis by modulating miRNAs. To test this hypothesis, murine brown preadipocytes were induced to differentiate the fatty acids of palmitic, oleate, or eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA). The increases of brown-specific signature genes and oxygen consumption rate by EPA were concurrent with up-regulation of miR-30b and 378 but not by oleate or palmitic acid. Next, we hypothesize that free fatty acid receptor 4 (Ffar4), a functional receptor for n-3 PUFA, modulates miR-30b and 378. Treatment of Ffar4 agonist (GW9508) recapitulated the thermogenic activation of EPA by increasing oxygen consumption rate, brown-specific marker genes, and miR-30b and 378, which were abrogated in Ffar4-silenced cells. Intriguingly, addition of the miR-30b mimic was unable to restore EPA-induced Ucp1 expression in Ffar4-depleted cells, implicating that Ffar4 signaling activity is required for up-regulating the brown adipogenic program. Moreover, blockage of miR-30b or 378 by locked nucleic acid inhibitors significantly attenuated Ffar4 as well as brown-specific signature gene expression, suggesting the signaling interplay between Ffar4 and miR-30b/378. The association between miR-30b/378 and brown thermogenesis was also confirmed in fish oil-fed C57/BL6 mice. Interestingly, the Ffar4 agonism-mediated signaling axis of Ffar4-miR-30b/378-Ucp1 was linked with an elevation of cAMP in brown adipocytes, similar to cold-exposed or fish oil-fed brown fat. Taken together, our work identifies a novel function of Ffar4 in modulating brown adipogenesis partly through a mechanism involving cAMP activation and up-regulation of miR-30b and miR-378."
https://openalex.org/W2505321358,"Empathy is a multidimensional process that incorporates both mentalizing and emotional sharing dimensions. Empathic competencies are important for creating interpersonal relationships with other people and developing adequate social behaviour. The lack of these social components also leads to isolation and exclusion in healthy populations. However, few studies have investigated how to improve these social skills. In a recent study, Kidd and Castano (2013) found that reading literary fiction increases mentalizing ability and may change how people think about other people's emotions and mental states. The aim of our study was to evaluate the effects of reading literary fiction, compared to nonfiction and science fiction, on empathic abilities. Compared to previous studies, we used a larger variety of empathy measures and utilized a pre and post-test design. In all, 214 healthy participants were randomly assigned to read a book representative of one of three literary genres (literary fiction, nonfiction, science fiction). Participants were assessed before and after the reading phase using mentalizing and emotional sharing tests, according to Zaki and Ochsner' s (2012) model. Comparisons of sociodemographic, mentalizing, and emotional sharing variables across conditions were conducted using ANOVA. Our results showed that after the reading phase, the literary fiction group showed improvement in mentalizing abilities, but there was no discernible effect on emotional sharing abilities. Our study showed that the reading processes can promote mentalizing abilities. These results may set important goals for future low-cost rehabilitation protocols for several disorders in which the mentalizing deficit is considered central to the disease, such as Autism Spectrum Disorders and Schizophrenia."
https://openalex.org/W2499045837,"A new model called “PHITS-based Analytical Radiation Model in the Atmosphere (PARMA) version 4.0” was developed to facilitate instantaneous estimation of not only omnidirectional but also angular differential energy spectra of cosmic ray fluxes anywhere in Earth’s atmosphere at nearly any given time. It consists of its previous version, PARMA3.0, for calculating the omnidirectional fluxes and several mathematical functions proposed in this study for expressing their zenith-angle dependences. The numerical values of the parameters used in these functions were fitted to reproduce the results of the extensive air shower simulation performed by Particle and Heavy Ion Transport code System (PHITS). The angular distributions of ground-level muons at large zenith angles were specially determined by introducing an optional function developed on the basis of experimental data. The accuracy of PARMA4.0 was closely verified using multiple sets of experimental data obtained under various global conditions. This extension enlarges the model’s applicability to more areas of research, including design of cosmic-ray detectors, muon radiography, soil moisture monitoring, and cosmic-ray shielding calculation. PARMA4.0 is available freely and is easy to use, as implemented in the open-access EXcel-based Program for Calculating Atmospheric Cosmic-ray Spectrum (EXPACS)."
https://openalex.org/W2498175983,"A number of concepts exist regarding how urbanization can be described as a process. Understanding this process that affects billions of people and its future development in a spatial manner is imperative to address related issues such as human quality of life. In the focus of spatially explicit studies on urbanization is typically a city, a particular urban region, an agglomeration. However, gaps remain in spatially explicit global models. This paper addresses that issue by examining the spatial dynamics of urban areas over time, for a full coverage of the world. The presented model identifies past, present and potential future hotspots of urbanization as a function of an urban area's spatial variation and age, whose relation could be depicted both as a proxy and as a path of urban development."
https://openalex.org/W2480707776,"There is strong diurnal variation in the symptoms and severity of chronic inflammatory diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis. In addition, disruption of the circadian clock is an aggravating factor associated with a range of human inflammatory diseases. To investigate mechanistic links between the biological clock and pathways underlying inflammatory arthritis, mice were administered collagen (or saline as a control) to induce arthritis. The treatment provoked an inflammatory response within the limbs, which showed robust daily variation in paw swelling and inflammatory cytokine expression. Inflammatory markers were significantly repressed during the dark phase. Further work demonstrated an active molecular clock within the inflamed limbs and highlighted the resident inflammatory cells, fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLSs), as a potential source of the rhythmic inflammatory signal. Exposure of mice to constant light disrupted the clock in peripheral tissues, causing loss of the nighttime repression of local inflammation. Finally, the results show that the core clock proteins cryptochrome (CRY) 1 and 2 repressed inflammation within the FLSs, and provide novel evidence that a CRY activator has anti-inflammatory properties in human cells. We conclude that under chronic inflammatory conditions, the clock actively represses inflammatory pathways during the dark phase. This interaction has exciting potential as a therapeutic avenue for treatment of inflammatory disease.-Hand, L. E., Hopwood, T. W., Dickson, S. H., Walker, A. L., Loudon, A. S. I., Ray, D.

https://openalex.org/W2485170089,"An amplicon metagenomic approach based on the ITS2 region of fungal rDNA was used to identify the composition of fungal communities associated with different strawberry organs (leaves, flowers, immature and mature fruits), grown on a farm using management practices that entailed the routine use of various chemical pesticides. ITS2 sequences clustered into 316 OTUs and Ascomycota was the dominant phyla (95.6%) followed by Basidiomycota (3.9%). Strawberry plants supported a high diversity of microbial organisms, but two genera, Botrytis and Cladosporium, were the most abundant, representing 70-99% of the relative abundance (RA) of all detected sequences. According to alpha and beta diversity analyses, strawberry organs displayed significantly different fungal communities with leaves having the most diverse fungal community, followed by flowers, and fruit. The interruption of chemical treatments for one month resulted in a significant modification in the structure of the fungal community of leaves and flowers while immature and mature fruit were not significantly affected. Several plant pathogens of other plant species, that would not be intuitively expected to be present on strawberry plants such as Erysiphe, were detected, while some common strawberry pathogens, such as Rhizoctonia, were less evident or absent."
https://openalex.org/W2478687517,"The role of salicylic acid in Cd tolerance has attracted more attention recently but no information is available on the efficiency of different forms of salicylic acid. The aim was thus to investigate whether both the acid and salt forms of salicylic acid provide protection against Cd stress and to compare their mode of action. Young maize plants were grown under controlled environmental conditions. One group of 10-day-old seedlings were treated with 0.5 mM SA or NaSA for 1 day then half of the pants were treated with 0.5 mM Cd for 1 day. Another group of seedlings was treated with 0.5 mM CdSO4 for 1 day without pre-treatment with SA or NaSA, while a third group was treated simultaneously with Cd and either SA or NaSA. Both salicylic acid forms reduced the Cd accumulation in the roots. Treatment with the acidic form meliorated the Cd accumulation in the leaves, while Na-salicylate increased the phytochelatin level in the roots and the amount of salicylic acid in the leaves. Furthermore, increased antioxidant enzyme activity was mainly induced by the acid form, while glutathione-related redox changes were influenced mostly by the salt form. The acidic and salt forms of salicylic acid affected the two antioxidant systems in different ways, and the influence of these two forms on the distribution and detoxification of Cd also differed. The present results also draw attention to the fact that generalisations about the stress protective mechanisms induced by salicylic acid are misleading since different forms of SA may exert different effects on the plants via separate mechanisms."
https://openalex.org/W2496491988,"Mode of action of farnesene, a volatile sesquiterpene commonly found in the essential oils of several plants, was deeply studied on the model species Arabidopsis thaliana. The effects of farnesene on the Arabidopsis root morphology were evaluated by different microscopic techniques. As well, microtubules immunolabeling, phytohormone measurements and ROS staining helped us to elucidate the single or multi-modes of action of this sesquiterpene on plant metabolism. Farnesene-treated roots showed a strong growth inhibition and marked modifications on morphology, important tissue alterations, cellular damages and anisotropic growth. Left-handed growth of farnesene-treated roots, reverted by taxol (a known microtubule stabilizer), was related to microtubule condensation and disorganization. As well, the inhibition of primary root growth, lateral root number, lateral root length, and both root hairs length and density could be explained by the strong increment in ethylene production and auxin content detected in farnesene-treated seedlings. Microtubule alteration and hormonal unbalance appear as important components in the mode of action of farnesene and confirm the strong phytotoxic potential of this sesquiterpene."
https://openalex.org/W2476959327,"A device consisting of a metallic island connected to electrodes via tunable semiconductor-based conduction channels is used to explore the evolution of charge quantization in the presence of quantum fluctuations; the measurements reveal a robust scaling of charge quantization as the square root of the residual electron reflection probability across a quantum channel, consistent with theoretical predictions. The charge of a single electron or proton defines the fundamental unit of electric charge. But in nanoelectronic devices, where quantum fluctuations are in play, the discreteness of this elementary charge is eroded with increasing connection strengths between conducting elements. Fundamental predictions have been difficult to verify, but now Frédéric Pierre and colleagues have constructed a device, consisting of a micrometre-scale metallic island connected to electrodes via fully controllable semiconducting channels, where the complete evolution of charge quantization can be measured. The work confirms long-standing theory and opens up a platform for testing charge quantization in challenging scenarios involving correlated electrons and topological quasiparticles. In 1909, Millikan showed that the charge of electrically isolated systems is quantized in units of the elementary electron charge e. Today, the persistence of charge quantization in small, weakly connected conductors allows for circuits in which single electrons are manipulated, with applications in, for example, metrology, detectors and thermometry1,2,3,4,5. However, as the connection strength is increased, the discreteness of charge is progressively reduced by quantum fluctuations. Here we report the full quantum control and characterization of charge quantization. By using semiconductor-based tunable elemental conduction channels to connect a micrometre-scale metallic island to a circuit, we explore the complete evolution of charge quantization while scanning the entire range of connection strengths, from a very weak (tunnel) to a perfect (ballistic) contact. We observe, when approaching the ballistic limit, that charge quantization is destroyed by quantum fluctuations, and scales as the square root of the residual probability for an electron to be reflected across the quantum channel; this scaling also applies beyond the different regimes of connection strength currently accessible to theory6,7,8. At increased temperatures, the thermal fluctuations result in an exponential suppression of charge quantization and in a universal square-root scaling, valid for all connection strengths, in agreement with expectations8. Besides being pertinent for the improvement of single-electron circuits and their applications, and for the metal–semiconductor hybrids relevant to topological quantum computing9, knowledge of the quantum laws of electricity will be essential for the quantum engineering of future nanoelectronic devices."
https://openalex.org/W2503322498,"Background Immunoglobulin therapy has become a major treatment option in several autoimmune neuromuscular disorders. For patients with Myasthenia Gravis (MG), intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) has been used for both crisis and chronic management. Subcutaneous Immunoglobulins (SCIg), which offer the advantage of home administration, may be a practical and effective option in chronic management of MG. We analyzed clinical outcomes and patient satisfaction in nine cases of chronic disabling MG who were either transitioned to, or started de novo on SCIg. Methods and Findings This was a retrospective cohort study for the period of 2015–2016, with a mean follow-up period of 6.8 months after initiation of SCIg. All patients with MG treated with SCIg at the Ottawa Hospital, a large Canadian tertiary hospital with subspecialty expertise in neuromuscular disorders were included, regardless of MG severity, clinical subtype and antibody status. The primary outcome was MG disease activity after SCIg initiation. This outcome was measured by 1) the Myasthenia Gravis Foundation of America (MGFA) clinical classification, and 2) subjective scales of disease activity including the Myasthenia Gravis activities of daily living profile (MG-ADL), Myasthenia Gravis Quality-of-life (MG-QOL 15), Visual Analog (VA) satisfaction scale. We also assessed any requirement for emergency department visits or hospitalizations. Safety outcomes included any SCIg related complication. All patients were stable or improved for MGFA class after SCIg initiation. Statistically significant improvements were documented in the MG-ADL, MG-QOL and VAS scales. There were no exacerbations after switching therapy and no severe SCIg related complications. Conclusions SCIg may be a beneficial therapy in the chronic management of MG, with favorable clinical outcome and patient satisfaction results."

Both soy isoflavones and vitamin D can modulate estrogen receptors in the colonic smooth muscles. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of soy isoflavones, vitamin D and their probable interactions in women with IBS. Methods In a factorial blinded randomized clinical trial, 100 women with IBS (age:18-75yr, were randomly assigned in 4 arms to receive either placebo of vitamin D and placebo of soy isoflavones (P+P), or placebo of vitamin D and soy isoflavones (P+S), or vitamin D and placebo of soy isoflavones (D+P), or vitamin D and soy isoflavones (D+S) for 6 weeks. Dosage of soy isoflavone was 2 capsules of 20 mg soy isoflavones per day, and dosage of vitamin D was one pearl of 50’000 IU biweekly. The clinical outcomes were IBS symptoms severity scores (IBS-SSS), disease- specific quality of life (IBS-QOL) and total score (IBS-TS) that evaluated at weeks 0, 6, and 10, and compared to each other. Results IBS-TS improved significantly in both S+P and D+P groups (p- value = 0.004, 0.015). The interaction effect of soy isoflavones and vitamin D on IBS-TS was significant (p<0.05). The interaction effect of soy isoflavones with vitamin D and the main effect of vitamin D on IBS-SSS were not statistically significant, whereas IBS-SSS decreased significantly in S+P and D+P groups (p-value = 0.001, 0.047 respectively). Conclusion Our results indicate that co-administration of soy isoflavones with vitamin D did not improve the IBS- SSS and IBS- QOL; however, it improved the IBS-TS.

https://openalex.org/W2480063636,"CaVβ subunits interact with the voltage-gated calcium channel CaV2.2 on a site in the intracellular loop between domains I and II (the I-II loop). This interaction influences the biophysical properties of the channel and leads to an increase in its trafficking to the plasma membrane. We have shown previously that a mutant CaV2.2 channel that is unable to bind CaVβ subunits (CaV2.2 W391A) was rapidly degraded (Waithe, D., Ferron, L., Page, K. M., Chaggar, K., and Dolphin, A. C. (2011) J. Biol. Chem. 286, 9598-9611). Here we show that, in the absence of CaVβ subunits, a construct consisting of the I-II loop of CaV2.2 was directly ubiquitinated and degraded by the proteasome system. Ubiquitination could be prevented by mutation of all 12 lysine residues in the I-II loop to arginines. Including a palmitoylation motif at the N terminus of CaV2.2 I-II loop was insufficient to target it to the plasma membrane in the absence of CaVβ subunits even when proteasomal degradation was inhibited with MG132 or ubiquitination was prevented by the lysine-to-arginine mutations. In the presence of CaVβ subunit, the palmitoylated CaV2.2 I-II loop was protected from degradation, although oligoubiquitination could still occur, and was efficiently trafficked to the plasma membrane. We propose that targeting to the plasma membrane requires a conformational change in the I-II loop that is induced by binding of the CaVβ subunit."

Collectively, these studies have led to the proposal that UHRF1 is not only a tumor biomarker but also a potential target for cancer therapy. However, currently there is no reported small molecule that either inhibits UHRF1 activity or induces its degradation. HSP90 (90-kDa heat-shock protein) is one of the most abundant and conserved molecular chaperone essential in eukaryotic cells (19Whitesell L. Lindquist S.L. HSP90 and the chaperoning of cancer.Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2005; 5: 761-772Crossref PubMed Scopus (1963) Google Scholar). Unlike HSP70, HSP90 is not required for de novo folding of most proteins but promotes the final maturation of a selected group of proteins termed HSP90 client proteins (20Saibil H. Chaperone machines for protein folding, unfolding and disaggregation.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2013; 14: 630-642Crossref PubMed Scopus (657) Google Scholar). The HSP90 client proteins are enriched in protein kinases, transcription factors, nuclear steroid receptors, and regulatory proteins (21Pearl L.H. Prodromou C. Workman P. The Hsp90 molecular chaperone: an open and shut case for treatment.Biochem. J. 2008; 410: 439-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar, 22Taipale M. Jarosz D.F. Lindquist S. HSP90 at the hub of protein homeostasis: emerging mechanistic insights.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2010; 11: 515-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (1285) Google Scholar). Most commonly, HSP90 facilitates their stabilization, and activation and inactivation of HSP90 by small molecule inhibitors, such as the 17-allylamino-17-desmethoxygeldanamycin (17-AAG), often leads to their degradation through the ubiquitin-proteasome system (20Saibil H. Chaperone machines for protein folding, unfolding and disaggregation.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2013; 14: 630-642Crossref PubMed Scopus (657) Google Scholar, 21Pearl L.H. Prodromou C. Workman P.

HSP90 at the hub of protein homeostasis: emerging mechanistic insights.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2010; 11: 515-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (1285) Google Scholar). Given that numerous oncoproteins have been shown to be HSP90 client proteins and that HSP90 is highly expressed in tumors compared with normal tissues, the development of HSP90 inhibitors has become a new strategy in cancer therapy (23Butler L.M. Ferraldeschi R. Armstrong H.K. Centenera M.M. Workman P. Maximizing the therapeutic potential of HSP90 inhibitors.Mol. Cancer Res. 2015; 13: 1445-1451Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). In an effort to screen for small molecules that affect UHRF1 stability, we identified the HSP90 inhibitor 17-AAG as a potent inducer of UHRF1 degradation. We present evidence that UHRF1 specifically interacts with HSP90 and is a novel HSP90 client protein. Because UHRF1 is aberrantly highly expressed in multiple types of cancers and UHRF1 knockdown causes cell cycle arrest, activation of DNA damage response, and apoptosis in different types of cancer cells (16Arima Y. Hirota T. Bronner C. Mousli M. Fujiwara T. Niwa S. Ishikawa H. Saya H.

The UHRF family: oncogenes that are drugable targets for cancer therapy in the near future?.Pharmacol. Ther. 2007; 115: 419-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). We thus wished to screen for small molecules that could induce UHRF1 degradation in cancer cells. To this end, we generated a stable HeLa cell line that constitutively expresses a GFP-tagged UHRF1 under the control of the CMV promoter. The cells were cultured in 384-well plates and treated with various compounds for 24 h. In this study, a library of 2240 chemicals in total (244 protein kinase inhibitors (Merck), 84 cancer regulators, 480 known bioactivators (ICCB), 43 epigenetic regulators, 303 regulators in stem cells, 446 therapeutic molecules from the National Institutes of Health clinical collection, and 640 agents from a Food and Drug Administration-approved drug library) was used. Using an automated fluorescence microscopy system, we screened for compounds that significantly diminished the intensity of GFP fluorescence (Fig. 1A). In primary screening, 39 compounds were positive for decreasing GFPmean to <400 nm, compared with a GFPmean of ∼600 nm in DMSO (1%) and mock controls. Among them, 17 compounds were able to reduce GFP intensities in GFP-UHRF1-HeLa cells but not the control GFP-HeLa cells, suggesting that these compounds were probably targeting at UHRF1 rather than GFP. The HSP90 inhibitor 17-AAG was identified as the top hit in this screen, and for this study we focused on this molecule. To validate the result of this screen, we treated the parental HeLa cells with 17-AAG and its analogue 17-dimethylaminoethylamino-17-demethoxygeldanamycin (17-DMAG) for 24 h, and subsequent immunofluorescence staining for endogenous UHRF1 revealed that treatment with either 17-AAG or 17-DMAG led to a marked reduction of endogenous UHRF1 (Fig. 1B). Furthermore, we tested the ability for both HSP90 inhibitors to down-regulate the levels of FLAG-UHRF1 stably expressed in NIH3T3 cells. As shown in Fig. 1C, both inhibitors down-regulated the levels of FLAG-UHRF1 in these NIH3T3 cells. These data thus demonstrate that HSP90 inhibitors are able to down-regulate both endogenous and ectopically expressed UHRF1. To test whether 17-AAG could down-regulate UHRF1 in various types of cancer cells, we treated HeLa (cervical cancer), HCT116 (colon cancer), A549 (lung cancer), and 22RV1 (prostate cancer) cells with 17-AAG for 12, 24, and 36 h, respectively. The cells were then collected and subjected to Western blotting analysis. As shown in Fig. 1D, 17-AAG treatment induced a time-dependent decrease of UHRF1 proteins in all of the cell lines tested. Note that 17-AAG treatment for 12 h was sufficient to induce the UHRF1 down-regulation (Fig. 1D). This effect on UHRF1 is specific, because 17-AAG treatment did not significantly affect the levels of DNMT1 and DNMT3A in HeLa and A549 cells (Fig. 1D) and HCT116 and 22RV1 (data not shown). As a positive control, we confirmed by Western blotting analysis that 17-AAG treatment led to a marked increase of HSP70 proteins, in agreement with the notion that inhibition of HSP90 induces HSP70 expression. Consistent with the immunostaining results in Fig. 1B, the down-regulation of UHRF1 was also observed by Western blotting analysis when another HSP90 inhibitor, 17-DMAG, was used (Fig. 1E). As expected, down-regulation of UHRF1 by both HSP90 inhibitors is dependent on the concentration of the inhibitors (Fig. 1F). Furthermore, we found that treatment with 17-AAG or 17-DMAG had little effect on the levels of UHRF1 mRNA, although it drastically increased the levels of HSP70 mRNAs (Fig. 1G). Together these data demonstrate that both HSP90 inhibitors induce down-regulation of UHRF1 proteins via a post-transcriptional mechanism. Previous studies indicated that HSP90 inhibitors can induce HSP90 client degradation via the ubiquitin-proteasomal degradation pathway (20Saibil H. Chaperone machines for protein folding, unfolding and disaggregation.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2013; 14: 630-642Crossref PubMed Scopus (657) Google Scholar, 21Pearl L.H. Prodromou C. Workman P.

HSP90 at the hub of protein homeostasis: emerging mechanistic insights.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2010; 11: 515-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (1285) Google Scholar). We thus tested whether the HSP90 inhibitors induce UHRF1 down-regulation via proteasome degradation. We added, with or without MG132, a proteasome inhibitor together with the HSP90 inhibitors and examined the levels of UHRF1 by Western blotting analysis. As shown in Fig. 2A, the addition of MG132 blocked the 17-AAG- and 17-DMAG-induced UHRF1 decrease in HeLa, A549, and LNCaP cell lines, indicating that the reduced protein levels of UHRF1 upon HSP90 inhibitor treatment are indeed mediated through the proteasome pathway. To ascertain that HSP90 inhibitor treatment could induce UHRF1 degradation, we determined the effects of 17-DMAG on the stability of the UHRF1. To this end, HeLa and stable FLAG-UHRF1 NIH3T3 cells were treated with cycloheximide to block new protein synthesis and with or without 17-DMAG for 0–9 h as indicated. The cells were collected and subjected to Western blotting analysis using either anti-UHRF1 or anti-FLAG antibody. The representative results in Fig. 2B and quantitative results in Fig. 2C showed that 17-DMAG treatment shortened the half-life of both endogenous and exogenous expressed UHRF1 in HeLa and NIH3T3 cells, respectively. To assess whether UHRF1 underwent ubiquitination upon treatment with HSP90 inhibitors, HeLa cells were cotransfected with FLAG-tagged UHRF1 and HA-Ub and treated without or with 17-AAG or 17-DMAG for 24 h. The cells were lysed under denaturing conditions, and FLAG-tagged UHRF1 protein was immunoprecipitated by anti-FLAG M2-agarose beads and then probed with anti-HA antibody to evaluate the levels of ubiquitination. As shown in Fig. 2D, the levels of UHRF1 polyubiquitination were significantly enhanced upon treatment with either 17-AAG or 17-DMAG. Collectively, these experiments indicate that HSP90 inhibitors induce UHRF1 ubiquitination and subsequently a ubiquitin-dependent proteasome degradation. HSP70 is a central player in protein folding and proteostasis control (26Hartl F.U. Bracher A. Hayer-Hartl M. Molecular chaperones in protein folding and proteostasis.Nature. 2011; 475: 324-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (2190) Google Scholar). Earlier studies have shown that the correct folding and maturation of HSP90 client proteins is a stepwise process in which the client proteins form “early complex” with HSP70/HSP40 first and then are transferred to HSP90 (27Pratt W.B. Toft D.O. Regulation of signaling protein function and trafficking by the hsp90/hsp70-based chaperone machinery.Exp. Biol. Med. 2003; 228: 111-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (1260) Google Scholar, 28Li J. Soroka J. Buchner J. The Hsp90 chaperone machinery: conformational dynamics and regulation by co-chaperones.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2012; 1823: 624-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar). Once HSP90 is inhibited, HSP70 is likely to target the immature client proteins for ubiquitin-dependent degradation (28Li J. Soroka J. Buchner J. The Hsp90 chaperone machinery: conformational dynamics and regulation by co-chaperones.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2012; 1823: 624-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar, 29Pratt W.B. Morishima Y. Peng H.-M. Osawa Y. Proposal for a role of the Hsp90/Hsp70-based chaperone machinery in making triage decisions when proteins undergo oxidative and toxic damage.Exp. Biol. Med. 2010; 235: 278-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Thus, to test further whether UHRF1 is a bona fide HSP90 client protein, we asked whether UHRF1 interacts with HSP70 and HSP90 and whether 17-AAG-induced UHRF1 degradation is dependent on HSP70. In this regard, both HSP70 and HSP90 were found to associate with endogenous UHRF1 in our previous proteomic study (data not shown). To confirm these proteomic data, we performed a co-immunoprecipitation assay. HEK293T cells were co-transfected with FLAG-tagged UHRF1 and HA-tagged HSP70 or HSP90 expression vectors. The whole cell extracts were then prepared and subjected to a co-immunoprecipitation assay. Subsequent Western blotting analysis showed that FLAG-UHRF1 was detected in anti-HA immunoprecipitates only when HA-HSP70 or HA-HSP90 was expressed (Fig. 3A, top). Reciprocally, HA-HSP70 and HA-HSP90 was specifically detected in anti-FLAG immunoprecipitates, indicating that HSP70 and HSP90 indeed interact with UHRF1 (Fig. 3A, bottom). We next attempted to examine the interaction between endogenous UHRF1 and HSP70 and HSP90 and also test how HSP90 inhibitor treatment affects their interaction by a co-immunoprecipitation assay. However, this attempt was unsuccessful due to high background of immunoglobulin heavy chain resulting from immunoprecipitation with anti-UHRF1 antibody. We thus resorted to a HeLa cell line stably expressing FLAG-UHRF1 that allowed us to immunoprecipitate UHRF1 with anti-FLAG M2 beads. As shown in Fig. 3B, treatment with HSP90 inhibitors for 24 h induced UHRF1 degradation and up-regulation of HSP70 and HSP90. However, IP-Western blotting analysis indicated that, despite reduced levels of UHRF1 proteins, HSP90 inhibitor treatment resulted in increased interaction between UHRF1 and HSP70 and HSP90 (Fig. 3C), suggesting that inactivation of HSP90 by 17-AAG increased the levels of immature UHRF1 proteins. This observation was further confirmed by a time course experiment in which a marked increase of interaction with HSP70 and HSP90 was observed for UHRF1 after a 12-h 17-AAG treatment (Fig. 3D). To address whether 17-AAG-induced UHRF1 degradation is dependent on HSP70, we constructed a HeLa cell line stably expressing an shHSP70. The efficient knockdown of HSP70 in this cell line was confirmed by Western blotting analysis. We found that HSP70 knockdown significantly mitigated 17-AAG-induced degradation of UHRF1 (Fig. 3E). Taken together, these data confirm that UHRF1 is a bona fide HSP90 client protein and provide evidence that HSP70 mediates HSP90 inhibitor-induced UHRF1 degradation. The C terminus of Hsc70-interacting protein (CHIP; also known as STUB1) is a co-chaperone that has an intrinsic E3 ubiquitin ligase activity. CHIP interacts with both HSP70 and HSP90 and has been shown to mediate the ubiquitination and degradation of HSP70-bound HSP90 client proteins, including glucocorticoid receptor (30Murata S.

Invest. 2007; 117: 648-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar). We thus asked whether CHIP also serves as an E3 ligase mediating UHRF1 degradation upon HSP90 inhibitor treatment. We first established conditions to efficiently knock down CHIP in HeLa cells by transfection of different siRNAs against CHIP (Fig. 4A). We then tested whether knockdown of CHIP by two different siRNAs (CHIP-1 and CHIP-3) could impair 17-AAG-induced UHRF1 degradation. As shown in Fig. 4B, we observed that CHIP knockdown did not affect 17-AAG-induced UHRF1 degradation, suggesting that 17-AAG-induced UHRF1 degradation is independent of the E3 ligase CHIP (Fig. 4B). Besides CHIP, the E3 ligase Cullin 5 (CUL5) has been shown to mediate ubiquitin-dependent degradation of HSP90 client proteins (37Ehrlich E.S. Wang T. Luo K. Xiao Z. Niewiadomska A.M. Martinez T. Xu W. Neckers L. Yu X.-F. Regulation of Hsp90 client proteins by a Cullin5-RING E3 ubiquitin ligase.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

U.S.A. 2014; 111: 6834-6839Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). To determine the role of CUL5 in HSP90 inhibitor-induced UHRF1 degradation, we used two different lentiviral shRNAs against CUL5 to establish stable CUL5 knockdown A549 and HCT116 cell lines (Fig. 4C). We confirmed by Western blotting analysis that CUL5 was efficiently knocked down in these stable shCUL5 cell lines (Fig. 4C). However, as shown in Fig. 4C, we found that CUL5 knockdown did not significantly affect 17-AAG or 17-DMAG-induced UHRF1 degradation. Thus, these results indicate that the E3 ligase CUL5 is also not required for HSP90 inhibitor-induced UHRF1 degradation. UHRF1 possesses an intrinsic E3 ligase activity due to the presence of a RING domain within its C terminus. This E3 ligase activity has been shown to catalyze UHRF1 autoubiquitination as well as ubiquitination of histones and non-histone substrates, and UHRF1 autoubiquitination has been implicated in regulation of UHRF1 stability (6Karagianni P.

https://openalex.org/W2497018028,"Listeria monocytogenes is a ubiquitous food-borne pathogen, and its presence in food or production facilities highlights the importance of surveillance. Increased understanding of the surface exposed antigens on Listeria would provide potential diagnostic and therapeutic targets. In the present work, using mass spectrometry and genetic cloning, we show that fructose-1,6-bisphosphate aldolase (FBA) class II in Listeria species is the antigen target of the previously described mAb-3F8. Western and dot blot assays confirmed that the mAb-3F8 could distinguish all tested Listeria species from close-related bacteria. Localization studies indicated that FBA is present in every fraction of Listeria cells, including supernatant and the cell wall, setting Listeria spp. as one of the few bacteria described to have this protein on their cell surface. Epitope mapping using ORFeome display and a peptide membrane revealed a 14-amino acid peptide as the potential mAb-3F8 epitope. The target epitope in FBA allowed distinguishing Listeria spp. from closely-related bacteria, and was identified as part of the active site in the dimeric enzyme. However, its function in cell surface seems not to be host cell adhesion-related. Western and dot blot assays further demonstrated that mAb-3F8 together with anti-InlA mAb-2D12 could differentiate pathogenic from non-pathogenic Listeria isolated from artificially contaminated cheese. In summary, we report FBA as a novel immunogenic surface target useful for the detection of Listeria genus."
https://openalex.org/W2503320959,"Bananas and plantains are considered an important crop around the world. Banana production is affected by several constraints, of which Black Sigatoka Disease, caused by the fungus Mycosphaerella fijiensis, is considered one of the most important diseases in banana plantations. The banana accession 'Calcutta-4' has a natural resistance to Black Sigatoka; however, the fruit is not valuable for commercialization. Gene identification and expression studies in 'Calcutta-4' might reveal possible gene candidates for resistant to the disease and elucidate mechanisms for resistance. A subtracted cDNA library was generated from leaves after 6, 9 and 12 days inoculated with M. fijiensis conidia on greenhouse banana plants of the accession 'Calcutta-4'. Bioinformatic analysis revealed 99 good quality sequences. Blast2go analysis revealed that 31% of the sequences could not be categorized and, according to the Biological Process Category, 32 and 28 ESTs are related to general metabolic and cellular processes, respectively; while 10 ESTs response to stimulus. Seven sequences were redundant and one was similar to genes that may be involved in pathogen resistance including the putative disease resistance protein RGA1. Genes encoding zinc finger domains were identified and may play an important role in pathogen resistance by inducing the expression of downstream genes. Expression analysis of four selected genes was performed using RT-qPCR during the early stage of the disease development at 6, 9, 12 and 15 days post inoculation showing a peak of up regulation at 9 or 12 days post inoculation. Three of the four genes showed an up-regulation of expression in 'Calcutta-4' when compared to 'Williams' after inoculation with M. fijiensis, suggesting a fine regulation of specific gene candidates that may lead to a resistance response. The genes identified in early responses in a plant-pathogen interaction may be relevant for the resistance response of 'Calcutta-4' to Black Sigatoka. Genes with different functions may play a role in plant response to the disease. The present study suggests a fine up regulation of these genes that might be needed to perform an incompatible interaction. Further gene functional studies need to be performed to validate their use as candidate resistance genes in susceptible banana cultivars."
https://openalex.org/W2506664189,"The epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) is a member of the ENaC/degenerin ion channel family, which also includes the bile acid-sensitive ion channel (BASIC). So far little is known about the effects of bile acids on ENaC function. ENaC is probably a heterotrimer consisting of three well characterized subunits (αβγ). In humans, but not in mice and rats, an additional δ-subunit exists. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of chenodeoxycholic, cholic, and deoxycholic acid in unconjugated (CDCA, CA, and DCA) and tauro-conjugated (t-CDCA, t-CA, t-DCA) form on human ENaC in its αβγ- and δβγ-configuration. We demonstrated that tauro-conjugated bile acids significantly stimulate ENaC in the αβγ- and in the δβγ-configuration. In contrast, non-conjugated bile acids have a robust stimulatory effect only on δβγENaC. Bile acids stimulate ENaC-mediated currents by increasing the open probability of active channels without recruiting additional near-silent channels known to be activated by proteases. Stimulation of ENaC activity by bile acids is accompanied by a significant reduction of the single-channel current amplitude, indicating an interaction of bile acids with a region close to the channel pore. Analysis of the known ASIC1 (acid-sensing ion channel) crystal structure suggested that bile acids may bind to the pore region at the degenerin site of ENaC. Substitution of a single amino acid residue within the degenerin region of βENaC (N521C or N521A) significantly reduced the stimulatory effect of bile acids on ENaC, suggesting that this site is critical for the functional interaction of bile acids with the channel. The epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) is a member of the ENaC/degenerin ion channel family, which also includes the bile acid-sensitive ion channel (BASIC). So far little is known about the effects of bile acids on ENaC function. ENaC is probably a heterotrimer consisting of three well characterized subunits (αβγ). In humans, but not in mice and rats, an additional δ-subunit exists. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of chenodeoxycholic, cholic, and deoxycholic acid in unconjugated (CDCA, CA, and DCA) and tauro-conjugated (t-CDCA, t-CA, t-DCA) form on human ENaC in its αβγ- and δβγ-configuration. We demonstrated that tauro-conjugated bile acids significantly stimulate ENaC in the αβγ- and in the δβγ-configuration. In contrast, non-conjugated bile acids have a robust stimulatory effect only on δβγENaC. Bile acids stimulate ENaC-mediated currents by increasing the open probability of active channels without recruiting additional near-silent channels known to be activated by proteases.

However, the functional role of the δ-subunit remains unclear. The regulation of ENaC is highly complex and involves several hormones, signaling pathways, and local mediators (28Loffing J.

Moreover, important species differences appear to exist in ENaC regulation and need to be considered when studying the underlying regulatory mechanisms (31Haerteis S. Krappitz M. Diakov A.

Interestingly, rat αβγENaC has recently been reported to be activated by bile acids (34Wiemuth D. Lefèvre C.M. Heidtmann H. Gründer S. Bile acids increase the activity of the epithelial Na+ channel.Pflügers Arch. 2014; 466: 1725-1733Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Bile acids have previously been shown to activate another member of the ENaC/degenerin ion channel family, the bile acid-sensitive ion channel (BASIC) (35Lefèvre C.M. Diakov A. Haerteis S.

Lingueglia E. Champigny G. Mattei M.G. Lazdunski M. Cloning and functional expression of a novel degenerin-like Na+ channel gene in mammals.J. Physiol. 1999; 519: 323-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The physiological role and mechanism of ENaC activation by bile acids remain to be elucidated. In particular, it has not yet been shown whether bile acids also affect the function of human ENaC, which can occur in at least two configurations (αβγ or δβγ) in different tissues. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate whether major human bile acids (chenodeoxycholic, cholic, and deoxycholic acid) modulate human ENaC in its αβγ- and δβγ-configuration. We demonstrate that bile acids can activate human ENaC, probably by specifically interacting with the degenerin region. To test the effect of bile acids on ENaC function, human αβγ- or δβγENaC was heterologously expressed in Xenopus laevis oocytes. Amiloride-sensitive whole-cell currents (Iami) were measured using the two-electrode voltage clamp technique. Representative current traces for αβγ- or δβγENaC-expressing oocytes are shown in Fig. 1, A and C and Fig. 1, B and D, respectively. Whole-cell current recordings were started in the presence of amiloride in a concentration of 2 or 100 μm to inhibit αβγENaC or δβγENaC, respectively (22Haerteis S. Krueger B. Korbmacher C. Rauh R. The δ-subunit of the epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) enhances channel activity and alters proteolytic ENaC activation.J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 29024-29040Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Wash-out of amiloride revealed an ENaC-mediated sodium inward current. Interestingly, the current response to superfusion with chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA) was different in αβγENaC-expressing oocytes when compared with that in δβγENaC-expressing oocytes. CDCA reduced αβγENaC currents by about 10% but resulted in 2.7-fold increase of δβγENaC currents (Fig. 1, A and B). In contrast, tauro-deoxycholic acid (t-DCA) stimulated ENaC in both subunit configurations (Fig. 1, C, D, and E). The effects of bile acids were reversible within about 2 min after wash-out. Re-addition of amiloride returned the whole-cell current toward the initial baseline level. The rapid onset and reversibility of the bile acid effect suggest that it is not caused by a permanent chemical modification of the channel or by a gradual accumulation of bile acids in the lipid bilayer of the plasma membrane. Control experiments demonstrated that bile acids had no effect on whole-cell currents in non-injected oocytes and that in ENaC-expressing oocytes the current stimulated by t-DCA was fully blocked by amiloride (data not shown). These control experiments confirm that the observed current responses are mediated by the effects of bile acids on ENaC activity. In addition to CDCA and t-DCA, we also tested the effect of cholic (CA), tauro-cholic (t-CA), deoxycholic (DCA), and tauro-chenodeoxycholic (t-CDCA) acid in similar experiments. Normalized data from these experiments are summarized in Fig. 1E. Interestingly, δβγENaC currents were stimulated more than 2-fold by non-conjugated as well as tauro-conjugated bile acids. In contrast, only the tauro-conjugated forms of bile acids (t-CA, t-DCA, and t-CDCA) markedly stimulated αβγENaC currents with t-DCA producing the largest effect (about 2-fold). The non-conjugated bile acids CA and DCA had a stimulatory effect of about 20% on αβγENaC currents, whereas CDCA even inhibited αβγENaC currents on average by more than 20%. Thus, a robust stimulatory effect on αβγENaC was only observed with tauro-conjugated bile acids (Fig. 1E). The marked difference between the effects of DCA and t-DCA on αβγENaC may result from a lower binding affinity of DCA to the channel or from DCA binding without major effect on channel function. To address this question, we performed experiments in which we first applied DCA and subsequently applied t-DCA in the presence of DCA (Fig. 2A) or first applied t-DCA and subsequently applied DCA in the presence of t-DCA (Fig. 2C). As summarized in Fig. 2B, DCA stimulated ENaC-mediated currents by about 30%, whereas subsequent application of t-DCA in the presence of DCA resulted in a stimulation of ENaC activity by more than 2-fold. In contrast, when ENaC was first activated by t-DCA, subsequent DCA application did not further activate the channel (Fig. 2D). Importantly, the combined stimulatory effects of DCA and t-DCA on αβγENaC were similar in both cases (DCA followed by t-DCA: 2.18 ± 0.08-fold, n = 20, N = 2; t-DCA followed by DCA: 2.15 ± 0.09-fold, n = 20, N = 2) and were not significantly different from that of t-DCA applied alone (2.11 ± 0.08-fold, n = 20, N = 2; Fig. 2, B and D). Thus, the effects of DCA and t-DCA were not additive. These data suggest that DCA and t-DCA modify channel activity by the same mechanism. The finding that an initial application of DCA does not reduce the stimulatory effect of t-DCA applied in the presence of DCA suggests that DCA does not prevent t-DCA binding to the channel. Thus, t-DCA is likely to have a higher binding affinity to the channel than DCA and binding of DCA may have a smaller stimulatory effect on αβγENaC than binding of t-DCA. Taken together, these findings demonstrate that tauro-conjugated bile acids stimulate ENaC in the δβγ- and in the αβγ-configuration, whereas non-conjugated bile acids have a robust stimulatory effect only on δβγENaC. Our whole-cell current measurements demonstrated that the effects of bile acids on human ENaC in both αβγ-subunit and δβγ-subunit configurations were rapid and reversible. This makes it unlikely that insertion of new channels in the plasma membrane contributes to the stimulatory effect of bile acids on ENaC. Instead, bile acids probably stimulate ENaC by increasing the Po of channels that are already present in the plasma membrane. Two functionally distinct ENaC populations are thought to be present in the plasma membrane: active channels with an average Po of about 0.5 and so-called near-silent channels with an extremely low Po (31Haerteis S.

Physiol. 2008; 586: 4587-4608Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Thus, bile acids may further increase the Po of the active channel population or may recruit additional near-silent channels by converting them into active channels. To investigate the biophysical mechanisms of ENaC activation by bile acids, we performed single-channel recordings in outside-out patches of ENaC-expressing oocytes and tested the effect of bile acids on ENaC. Fig. 3A shows a representative recording from an outside-out patch excised from an oocyte expressing αβγENaC. The initial wash-out of amiloride revealed single-channel activity with up to three apparent channel levels (Fig. 3A). After t-DCA application, the same number of active channels in the patch was observed. However, NPo was moderately increased from 1.04 to 1.64 (where N is the number of channels and Po is single-channel open probability), and the single-channel current amplitude (i) was reduced from 0.39 to 0.37 pA (Fig. 3A, insets 1 and 2). The observed increase in NPo is consistent with the stimulatory effect of t-DCA on ENaC whole-cell currents in oocytes expressing αβγENaC (Fig. 1E). Upon wash-out of t-DCA, NPo and i returned approximately to their initial values (0.88 and 0.39 pA, respectively; Fig. 3A, inset 3). It is well established that proteolytic activation of ENaC is associated with the recruitment of near-silent channels (31Haerteis S. Krappitz M. Diakov A. Krappitz A. Rauh R. Korbmacher C.

Indeed, subsequent application of the serine protease chymotrypsin led to the recruitment of additional channel levels and a strong increase of NPo from 0.88 to 5.28 (Fig. 3A, inset 4). The single-channel amplitude remained unchanged at 0.39 pA. On average, t-DCA reduced the single-channel current amplitude from 0.380 ± 0.003 to 0.35 ± 0.01 pA (p < 0.001; N = 4; n = 7), increased NPo by about 1.6-fold from 0.82 ± 0.17 to 1.36 ± 0.25 (p < 0.05; N = 4; n = 7), and did not significantly change the number of apparent channel levels 2.4 ± 0.5 versus 2.7 ± 0.6 (n.s.; N = 4; n = 7) (Fig. 3B). In contrast, chymotrypsin did not significantly change the single-channel current amplitude and increased both NPo (by about 4-fold from 0.86 ± 0.18 to 3.72 ± 0.87 (p < 0.01; N = 4; n = 7)) and the number of apparent channel levels from 2.1 ± 0.5 to 5.4 ± 1.2 (p < 0.01; N = 4; n = 7). In some experiments with very low initial αβγENaC activity, the difference in the effects of t-DCA and chymotrypsin was particularly impressive (Fig. 3C). In this experiment, only a few, extremely brief single-channel openings were observed prior to the application of t-DCA (NPo < 0.01), which indicates that in this outside-out patch, only near-silent channels with a very low Po are present. Interestingly, application of t-DCA had no significant effect on channel activity in this patch, which suggests that near-silent channels are not markedly affected by t-DCA. In contrast, application of chymotrypsin resulted in the expected conversion of near-silent channels into active channels as evidenced by the appearance of up to four channel levels with long channel openings (NPo = 2.52). In summary, our single-channel data indicate that t-DCA stimulates αβγENaC activity by increasing the Po of active channels without recruiting additional near-silent channels, which distinguishes the effect of t-DCA from that of channel-activating proteases. Moreover, the small but significant reduction of single-channel current amplitude in the presence of t-DCA indicates a possible interaction of bile acids with a region close to the channel pore. In outside-out patches from oocytes expressing δβγENaC, we confirmed our previously reported finding that for unknown reasons δβγENaC shows a high basal Po close to 1 (Fig. 4, A and B) (22Haerteis S. Krueger B. Korbmacher C. Rauh R. The δ-subunit of the epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) enhances channel activity and alters proteolytic ENaC activation.J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 29024-29040Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Indeed, in outside-out patches, the channel resides almost all the time in its open state with only brief closing events (Fig. 4, inset 1 demonstrating part of the trace on an expanded time scale). Under these conditions, it is not surprising that application of CDCA had no additional stimulatory effect on Po despite the large stimulatory effect of CDCA observed on ENaC whole-cell currents (Fig. 1B). However, the single-channel current amplitude of δβγENaC was slightly reduced from 0.95 to 0.84 pA (Fig. 4A, inset 2). The single-channel current amplitude of δβγENaC returned to its initial value upon wash-out of CDCA (Fig. 4A, inset 3). In outside-out patches, chymotrypsin also had no detectable effect on Po and single-channel current amplitude of δβγENaC (Fig. 4A, inset 4), which is consistent with our previously reported data (22Haerteis S. Krueger B. Korbmacher C. Rauh R. The δ-subunit of the epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) enhances channel activity and alters proteolytic ENaC activation.J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 29024-29040Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Importantly, the small but significant and reversible reduction of the single-channel current amplitude of δβγENaC by CDCA (Fig. 4C) suggests that CDCA interacts with δβγENaC in a similar way as t-DCA interacts with αβγENaC (Fig. 3B). This further supports the hypothesis that bile acids interact with a region in ENaC close to the channel pore. To identify a putative bile acid binding site, we analyzed the crystal structure of ASIC1 transmembrane domains. Analysis revealed the presence of hydrophobic crevices in the membrane-spanning region of the channel occupied by three maltose groups of the detergent n-dodecyl-β-d-maltoside used for channel isolation from the plasma membrane before crystallization (Protein Data Bank (PDB) ID 2QTS (3Jasti J. Furukawa H. Gonzales E.B. Gouaux E. Structure of acid-sensing ion channel 1 at 1.9 Å resolution and low pH.Nature. 2007; 449: 316-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (857) Google Scholar)) (Fig. 5A). Two of the putative detergent binding sites are located on the outer side of the transmembrane domains and are probably occupied by membrane lipids. Interestingly, the third site is located within the pore region formed by the second transmembrane domains (TM2) of all three subunits and is accessible from the extracellular solution. Bile acids are amphiphilic substances and can behave as detergents (43Helenius A. Simons K. Solubilization of membranes by detergents.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1975"
https://openalex.org/W2476796768,"The IUCN Red List has assessed the global distributions of the majority of the world's amphibians, birds and mammals. Yet these assessments lack explicit reference to widely available, remotely-sensed data that can sensibly inform a species' risk of extinction. Our first goal is to add additional quantitative data to the existing standardised process that IUCN employs. Secondly, we ask: do our results suggest species of concern-those at considerably greater risk than hitherto appreciated? Thirdly, these assessments are not only important on a species-by-species basis. By combining distributions of species of concern, we map conservation priorities. We ask to what degree these areas are currently protected and how might knowledge from remote sensing modify the priorities? Finally, we develop a quick and simple method to identify and modify the priority setting in a landscape where natural habitats are disappearing rapidly and so where conventional species' assessments might be too slow to respond. Tropical, mainland Southeast Asia is under exceptional threat, yet relatively poorly known. Here, additional quantitative measures may be particularly helpful. This region contains over 122, 183, and 214 endemic mammals, birds, and amphibians, respectively, of which the IUCN considers 37, 21, and 37 threatened. When corrected for the amount of remaining natural habitats within the known elevation preferences of species, the average sizes of species ranges shrink to <40% of their published ranges. Some 79 mammal, 49 bird, and 184 amphibian ranges are <20,000km2-an area at which IUCN considers most other species to be threatened. Moreover, these species are not better protected by the existing network of protected areas than are species that IUCN accepts as threatened. Simply, there appear to be considerably more species at risk than hitherto appreciated. Furthermore, incorporating remote sensing data showing where habitat loss is prevalent changes the locations of conservation priorities."
https://openalex.org/W2479359481,"Accumulating evidence supports a role for prolactin (PRL) in the development and progression of human breast cancer. Although PRL is an established chemoattractant for breast cancer cells, the precise molecular mechanisms of how PRL regulates breast cancer cell motility and invasion are not fully understood. PRL activates the serine/threonine kinase NEK3, which was reported to enhance breast cancer cell migration, invasion, and the actin cytoskeletal reorganization necessary for these processes. However, the specific mechanisms of NEK3 activation in response to PRL signaling have not been defined. In this report, a novel PRL-inducible regulatory phosphorylation site within the activation segment of NEK3, threonine 165 (Thr-165), was identified. Phosphorylation at NEK3 Thr-165 was found to be dependent on activation of the extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) signaling pathway using both pharmacological inhibition and siRNA-mediated knockdown approaches. Strikingly, inhibition of phosphorylation at NEK3 Thr-165 by expression of a phospho-deficient mutant (NEK3-T165V) resulted in increased focal adhesion size, formation of zyxin-positive focal adhesions, and reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton into stress fibers. Concordantly, NEK3-T165V cells exhibited migratory defects. Together, these data support a modulatory role for phosphorylation at NEK3 Thr-165 in focal adhesion maturation and/or turnover to promote breast cancer cell migration."
https://openalex.org/W2476648719,"Quantitative image analysis in previous research in obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) has focused on the upper airway or several objects in its immediate vicinity and measures of object size. In this paper, we take a more general approach of considering all major objects in the upper airway region and measures pertaining to their individual morphological properties, their tissue characteristics revealed by image intensities, and the 3D architecture of the object assembly. We propose a novel methodology to select a small set of salient features from this large collection of measures and demonstrate the ability of these features to discriminate with very high prediction accuracy between obese OSAS and obese non-OSAS groups.Thirty children were involved in this study with 15 in the obese OSAS group with an apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) = 14.4 ± 10.7) and 15 in the obese non-OSAS group with an AHI = 1.0 ± 1.0 (p<0.001). Subjects were between 8-17 years and underwent T1- and T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the upper airway during wakefulness. Fourteen objects in the vicinity of the upper airways were segmented in these images and a total of 159 measurements were derived from each subject image which included object size, surface area, volume, sphericity, standardized T2-weighted image intensity value, and inter-object distances. A small set of discriminating features was identified from this set in several steps. First, a subset of measures that have a low level of correlation among the measures was determined. A heat map visualization technique that allows grouping of parameters based on correlations among them was used for this purpose. Then, through T-tests, another subset of measures which are capable of separating the two groups was identified. The intersection of these subsets yielded the final feature set. The accuracy of these features to perform classification of unseen images into the two patient groups was tested by using logistic regression and multi-fold cross validation.A set of 16 features identified with low inter-feature correlation (< 0.36) yielded a high classification accuracy of 96% with sensitivity and specificity of 97.8% and 94.4%, respectively. In addition to the previously observed increase in linear size, surface area, and volume of adenoid, tonsils, and fat pad in OSAS, the following new markers have been found. Standardized T2-weighted image intensities differed between the two groups for the entire neck body region, pharynx, and nasopharynx, possibly indicating changes in object tissue characteristics. Fat pad and oropharynx become less round or more complex in shape in OSAS. Fat pad and tongue move closer in OSAS, and so also oropharynx and tonsils and fat pad and tonsils. In contrast, fat pad and oropharynx move farther apart from the skin object.The study has found several new anatomic bio-markers of OSAS. Changes in standardized T2-weighted image intensities in objects may imply that intrinsic tissue composition undergoes changes in OSAS. The results on inter-object distances imply that treatment methods should respect the relationships that exist among objects and not just their size. The proposed method of analysis may lead to an improved understanding of the mechanisms underlying OSAS."
https://openalex.org/W2483210319,"Effects of tree species diversity on decomposition can operate via a multitude of mechanism, including alterations of microclimate by the forest canopy. Studying such effects in natural settings is complicated by the fact that topography also affects microclimate and thus decomposition, so that effects of diversity are more difficult to isolate. Here, we quantified decomposition rates of standard litter in young subtropical forest stands, separating effects of canopy tree species richness and topography, and quantifying their direct and micro-climate-mediated components. Our litterbag study was carried out at two experimental sites of a biodiversity-ecosystem functioning field experiment in south-east China (BEF-China). The field sites display strong topographical heterogeneity and were planted with tree communities ranging from monocultures to mixtures of 24 native subtropical tree species. Litter bags filled with senescent leaves of three native tree species were placed from Nov. 2011 to Oct. 2012 on 134 plots along the tree species diversity gradient. Topographic features were measured for all and microclimate in a subset of plots. Stand species richness, topography and microclimate explained important fractions of the variations in litter decomposition rates, with diversity and topographic effects in part mediated by microclimatic changes. Tree stands were 2-3 years old, but nevertheless tree species diversity explained more variation (54.3%) in decomposition than topography (7.7%). Tree species richness slowed litter decomposition, an effect that slightly depended on litter species identity. A large part of the variance in decomposition was explained by tree species composition, with the presence of three tree species playing a significant role. Microclimate explained 31.4% of the variance in decomposition, and was related to lower soil moisture. Within this microclimate effect, species diversity (without composition) explained 8.9% and topography 34.4% of variance. Topography mainly affected diurnal temperature amplitudes by varying incident solar radiation."
https://openalex.org/W2495137258,"Aging and the coincident loss of circulating estrogens at menopause lead to increased risks for neurological and cardiovascular pathologies. Clinical studies show that estrogen therapy (ET) can be beneficial in mitigating these negative effects, in both the brain and heart, when it is initiated shortly after the perimenopausal transition. However, this same therapy is detrimental when initiated >10 years postmenopause. Importantly, the molecular mechanisms underlying this age-related switch in ET efficacy are unknown. Estrogen receptors (ERs) mediate the neuroprotective and cardioprotective functions of estrogens by modulating gene transcription or, non-genomically, by activating second messenger signaling pathways, such as mitogen activated protein kinases (MAPK). These kinases are critical regulators of cell signaling pathways and have widespread downstream effects. Our hypothesis is that age and estrogen deprivation following menopause alters the expression and activation of the MAPK family members p38 and ERK in the brain and heart. To test this hypothesis, we used a surgically induced model of menopause in 18 month old rats through bilateral ovariectomy (OVX) followed by an acute dose of 17β-estradiol (E2) administered at varying time points post-OVX (1 week, 4 weeks, 8 weeks, or 12 weeks). Age and E2 treatment differentially regulated kinase activity in both the brain and heart, and the effects were also brain region specific. MAPK signaling plays an integral role in aging, and the aberrant regulation of those signaling pathways might be involved in age-related disorders. Clinical studies show benefits of ET during early menopause but detrimental effects later, which might be reflective of changes in kinase expression and activation status."
https://openalex.org/W2477477590,"Floristic Quality Assessment (FQA) is increasingly influential for making land management decisions, for directing conservation policy, and for research. But, the basic ecological properties and limitations of its metrics are ill defined and not well understood-especially those related to sample methods and scale. Nested plot data from a remnant tallgrass prairie sampled annually over a 12-year period, were used to investigate FQA properties associated with species detection rates, species misidentification rates, sample year, and sample grain/area. Plot size had no apparent effect on Mean C (an area's average Floristic Quality level), nor did species detection levels above 65% detection. Simulated species misidentifications only affected Mean C values at greater than 10% in large plots, when the replaced species were randomly drawn from the broader county-wide species pool. Finally, FQA values were stable over the 12-year study, meaning that there was no evidence that the metrics exhibit year effects. The FQA metric Mean C is demonstrated to be robust to varied sample methodologies related to sample intensity (plot size, species detection rate), as well as sample year. These results will make FQA measures even more appealing for informing land-use decisions, policy, and research for two reasons: 1) The sampling effort needed to generate accurate and consistent site assessments with FQA measures is shown to be far lower than what has previously been assumed, and 2) the stable properties and consistent performance of metrics with respect to sample methods will allow for a remarkable level of comparability of FQA values from different sites and datasets compared to other commonly used ecological metrics."
https://openalex.org/W2481951477,"The seven transmembrane protein Smoothened is required for Hedgehog signaling during embryonic development and adult tissue homeostasis. Inappropriate activation of the Hedgehog signalling pathway leads to cancers such as basal cell carcinoma and medulloblastoma, and Smoothened inhibitors are now available clinically to treat these diseases. However, resistance to these inhibitors rapidly develops thereby limiting their efficacy. The determination of Smoothened crystal structures enables structure-based discovery of new ligands with new chemotypes that will be critical to combat resistance. In this study, we docked 3.2 million available, lead-like molecules against Smoothened, looking for those with high physical complementarity to its structure; this represents the first such campaign against the class Frizzled G-protein coupled receptor family. Twenty-one high-ranking compounds were selected for experimental testing, and four, representing three different chemotypes, were identified to antagonize Smoothened with IC50 values better than 50 μM. A screen for analogs revealed another six molecules, with IC50 values in the low micromolar range. Importantly, one of the most active of the new antagonists continued to be efficacious at the D473H mutant of Smoothened, which confers clinical resistance to the antagonist vismodegib in cancer treatment."
https://openalex.org/W4239963947,"During short-term hypoxia, Hypoxia Inducible Factors (particular their subunits HIF-1α and HIF-2α) regulate the expression of many genes including the potent angiogenesis stimulator VEGF. However, in some pathological conditions chronic hypoxia occurs and is accompanied by reduced angiogenesis.We investigated the effect of prolonged hypoxia on the proliferation and sprouting ability of human microvascular endothelial cells and the involvement of the HIFs and Dll4/Notch signaling.Human microvascular endothelial cells (hMVECs), cultured at 20% oxygen for 14 days and seeded on top of 3D fibrin matrices, formed sprouts when stimulated with VEGF-A/TNFα. In contrast, hMVECs precultured at 1% oxygen for 14 days were viable and proliferative, but did not form sprouts into fibrin upon VEGF-A/TNFα stimulation at 1% oxygen. Silencing of HIF-2α with si-RNA partially restored the inhibition of endothelial sprouting, whereas HIF-1α or HIF-3α by si-RNA had no effect. No involvement of Dll4/Notch pathway in the inhibitory effect on endothelial sprouting by prolonged hypoxia was found. In addition, hypoxia decreased the production of urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA), needed for migration and invasion, without a significant effect on its inhibitor PAI-1. This was independent of HIF-2α, as si-HIF-2α did not counteract uPA reduction.Prolonged culturing of hMVECs at 1% oxygen inhibited endothelial sprouting into fibrin. Two independent mechanisms contribute. Silencing of HIF-2α with si-RNA partially restored the inhibition of endothelial sprouting pointing to a HIF-2α-dependent mechanism. In addition, reduction of uPA contributed to reduced endothelial tube formation in a fibrin matrix during prolonged hypoxia."
https://openalex.org/W2482548809,"Socioeconomic disadvantage (SED) has been consistently associated with early life mental health problems. SED has been shown to impact multiple biological systems, including the regulation of neurotrophic proteins, immune-inflammatory and oxidative stress markers, which, conversely, have been reported to be relevant to physiological and pathological neurodevelopment This study investigated the relationship between SED, different domains of psychopathology, serum levels of interleukin-6 (IL6), thiobarbituric acid-reactive substance (TBARS) and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). We hypothesized that a composite of socioeconomic risk would be associated with psychopathology and altered levels of peripheral biomarkers. In addition, we hypothesized that SED would moderate the associations between mental health problems, IL6, TBARS and BDNF.Using a cross-sectional design, we measured the serum levels of IL6, TBARS and BDNF in 495 children aged 6 to 12. We also investigated socio-demographic characteristics and mental health problems using the Child Behaviour Checklist (CBCL) DSM-oriented scales. SED was evaluated using a cumulative risk model. Generalized linear models were used to assess associations between SED, biomarkers levels and psychopathology. SED was significantly associated with serum levels of IL6 (RR = 1.026, 95% CI 1.004; 1.049, p = 0.020) and TBARS (RR = 1.077, 95% CI 1.028; 1.127, p = 0.002). The association between SED and BDNF was not statistically significant (RR = 1.031, 95% CI 0.997; 1.066, p = 0.077). SED was also significantly associated with all CBCL DSM-oriented scales (all p < 0.05), whereas serum biomarkers (i.e. IL6, TBARS, BDNF) were associated with specific subscales. Moreover, the associations between serum biomarkers and domains of psychopathology were moderated by SED, with stronger correlations between mental health problems, IL6, TBARS, and BDNF being observed in children with high SED.In children, SED is highly associated with mental health problems. Our findings suggest that this association may be moderated via effects on multiple interacting neurobiological systems."
https://openalex.org/W2480985544,"African trypanosomes and related kinetoplastid parasites selectively traffic specific membrane proteins to the flagellar membrane, but the mechanisms for this trafficking are poorly understood. We show here that KHARON, a protein originally identified in Leishmania parasites, interacts with a putative trypanosome calcium channel and is required for its targeting to the flagellar membrane. KHARON is located at the base of the flagellar axoneme, where it likely mediates targeting of flagellar membrane proteins, but is also on the subpellicular microtubules and the mitotic spindle. Hence, KHARON is probably a multifunctional protein that associates with several components of the trypanosome cytoskeleton. RNA interference-mediated knockdown of KHARON mRNA results in failure of the calcium channel to enter the flagellar membrane, detachment of the flagellum from the cell body, and disruption of mitotic spindles. Furthermore, knockdown of KHARON mRNA induces a lethal failure of cytokinesis in both bloodstream (mammalian host) and procyclic (insect vector) life cycle stages, and KHARON is thus critical for parasite viability.

African trypanosomes such as Trypanosoma brucei and related subspecies are parasitic protists that cause sleeping sickness in humans and the wasting disease nagana in cattle. Between 2010 and 2013 there were ∼7,000 new cases reported per year (1Franco J.R. Simarro P.P. Diarra A. Jannin J.G. Epidemiology of human African trypanosomiasis.Clin.

Independent analysis of the flagellum surface and matrix proteomes provides insight into flagellum signaling in mammalian-infectious Trypanosoma brucei.Mol. Cell. Proteomics. 2011; 10Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Notably, RNAi-mediated knockdown of KH mRNA not only prevented flagellar trafficking of TbCaCh but was also lethal to both BF and insect stage PF parasites, resulting in detachment of flagella from the cell body via the flagellar attachment zone and failure of the parasites to undergo cytokinesis. Subcellular localization of KH demonstrated that this protein is located at the base of the flagellar axoneme, where it is likely to mediate import of integral membrane proteins into the flagellar membrane, but also on the subpellicular microtubule cytoskeleton and unexpectedly on the mitotic spindle. Hence KH is a central component of flagellar membrane transport machinery and also associates with multiple components of the trypanosome cytoskeleton, where it is likely to serve diverse functions in parasite cell biology. The results reported here establish T. brucei as an ideal experimental system in which to study the multiple functions of KH and in particular to dissect the mechanism whereby it mediates trafficking of integral membrane proteins to the flagellar membrane. Recent studies by our laboratory identified the KHARON protein of L. mexicana, LmxKH, as a cytoskeleton-associated protein that mediates the translocation of the LmxGT1 glucose transporter to the flagellar surface membrane (21Tran K.D. Rodriguez-Contreras D. Vieira D.P. Yates P.A. David L. Beatty W. Elferich J. Landfear S.M.

Because a BLAST search employing GenBankTM and TriTrypDB revealed the presence of KH orthologs in kinetoplastid parasites but not in other organisms, we hypothesized that KH might play a fundamental biological role in this entire family of protists. Protein sequence alignment of LmxKH (gene ID in TriTrypDB: LmxM.36.5850) and TbKH (gene ID: Tb927.10.8940) revealed 27% (112/411) identity and an additional 11% similarity, and several segments of sequence that are present in LmxKH (520 amino acids) are absent from TbKH (411 amino acids). Hence, whereas KH exists in trypanosomes, it is relatively divergent in sequence between these two related parasites, thus underscoring the need to test the biological functions in both organisms. A conserved sequence signature encompassing amino acids 227–235 of TbKH (NESVDVLNL) is the largest block of contiguous sequence present in both KH orthologs. To determine the subcellular localization of TbKH in BF parasites, transgenic parasites were generated in which the TbKH open reading frame was endogenously tagged with the Ty1 epitope on the N terminus or with the HA3 epitope on the C terminus. To facilitate isolation of separated flagella for some experiments, these transgenic lines were also prepared in a parasite genetic background, the TbFLA1RNAi line, allowing inducible RNAi (22Sunter J.

Inducing degradation of TbFLA1 mRNA results in separation of flagellar attachment to the cell body by disrupting the flagellar attachment zone, the interface that encompasses parts of both the flagellar and cell body membranes and associated structures where the two membranes adhere (25Sunter J.D.

This disruption allows the non-adherent flagella to be sheared off the cell body and purified by differential centrifugation (26Subota I. Julkowska D. Vincensini L. Reeg N. Buisson J. Blisnick T.

Immunofluorescence of the transgenic BFs demonstrated that epitope-tagged TbKH was located in three discrete compartments: 1) In purified flagella, Ty1::TbKH localizes at the base of the flagella (Fig. 1A). 2) In whole cell images, Ty1::TbKH localizes in the subpellicular microtubule cytoskeleton (Fig. 1B) as indicated by the overlap of the TbKH signal with α-tubulin signal; in addition, these two fluorescence signals also overlap in detergent-extracted cytoskeletons from BF parasites (Fig. 1C), consistent with TbKH being a cytoskeleton-associated protein. 3) Unexpectedly, Ty1::TbKH also localizes in the mitotic spindle in dividing BF parasites (Fig. 1D), where it exhibits intense fluorescence on a tubule that connects two replicated nuclei. To confirm that this localization represents the mitotic spindle, parasites were co-stained with the KMX-1 antibody (Fig. 1E) that preferentially recognizes β-tubulin associated with the spindle (27Sasse R. Gull K. Tubulin post-translational modifications and the construction of microtubular organelles in Trypanosoma brucei.J. Cell Sci. 1988; 90: 577-589Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These images show strong overlap of the Ty1::TbKH- and KMX-1-associated signals at the tubule that connects separating nuclei. In addition, spindle morphology has been shown to change during the cell cycle (28Sun S.Y. Wang C. Yuan Y.A. He C.Y. An intracellular membrane junction consisting of flagellum adhesion glycoproteins links flagellum biogenesis to cell morphogenesis in Trypanosoma brucei.J. Cell Sci. 2013; 126: 520-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), with the rhomboid shaped spindle (Fig. 1E) observed early in mitosis developing into a dense central spindle (Fig. 1D) later in the nuclear replication process, similar to the morphologies observed for Ty1::TbKH fluorescence. To confirm that the localizations observed above did not represent epitope tag-mediated mistargeting, similar images were also obtained from parasite lines expressing TbKH1 with a complementary epitope tag, the trimeric hemagglutinin epitope HA3, fused to the alternate C terminus of KH. These images confirmed localization at the base of the flagellum (Fig. 2A), where the tagged protein is immediately adjacent to DAPI fluorescence signal that is associated with kinetoplast DNA, the highly catenated mitochondrial DNA that is physically attached to the basal body (29Gluenz E. Povelones M.L. Englund P.T. Gull K. The kinetoplast duplication cycle in Trypanosoma brucei is orchestrated by cytoskeleton-mediated cell morphogenesis.Mol. Cell Biol. 2011; 31: 1012-1021Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), the subpellicular microtubules (Fig. 2B), and the mitotic spindle (Fig. 2C) for both Ty1::TbKH and TbKH::HA3 (compare FIGURE 1., FIGURE 2.). Whole parasites that are expressing TbKH::HA3 do, however, also exhibit punctate staining in the interior of the cell in addition to staining on the subpellicular microtubules (Fig. 2B) or the spindle (Fig. 2C). The absence of cross-reacting bands on Western blots of lysates from wild type BF parasites (see Fig. 6G, lane 1) developed with anti-HA monoclonal antibody or immunofluorescence signal from wild type BF parasites stained with the same antibody (not shown) suggests that this punctate staining does not represent endogenous cross-reacting material. The additional puncta could represent a proportion of TbKH::HA3 that is mistargeted, indicating that addition of HA3 to the C terminus may represent a less optimal tag than addition of Ty1 to the N terminus.FIGURE 6.TbCaCh depends on TbKH for translocation to the flagellar membrane in BF parasites. TbCaCh::HA3/TbKHRNAi or TbCaCh::HA3/TbFLA1RNAi cell lines were induced with 1 μg ml−1 doxycycline (dox).

Hydroxyurea synchronization was employed to increase the percentage of parasites captured in mitosis and thus facilitate the detection of mitotic spindles that are associated with LmxKH, but similar images were also observed with lower frequency using non-synchronized parasites (data not shown). L. mexicana promastigotes assumed an oval morphology following exposure to hydroxyurea rather than the elongated shape of untreated promastigotes, but LmxKH was nonetheless apparent on the mitotic spindle that separates dividing nuclei. To determine whether TbKH is essential for BF parasites, we inhibited the expression of TbKH by RNAi. The transgenic BF/pHD1313 line (30Sanchez M.

Induction of expression of this hairpin loop RNA with doxycycline for 24 h reduced the level of TbKH mRNA by at least 6-fold (Fig. 4A, upper panel), as determined by densitometry, whereas T. brucei hexose transporter 1 (TbHT1) mRNA remained unchanged (Fig. 4A, bottom panel). A time course for expression of TbKH::HA3 following induction of RNAi against TbKH mRNA (Fig. 4B) showed that the protein was almost completely eliminated by 48 h after induction. Upon induction of RNAi, parasite growth was severely compromised (Fig. 4C, open circles), resulting in death of BFs by 72 h. Whereas uninduced parasites exhibited normal morphology upon staining with anti-α-tubulin antibody and DAPI (Fig. 4E), parasites where RNAi had been induced for 12 h (Fig. 4F), 24 h (Fig. 4G), or 48 h (Fig. 4H) continued to replicate nuclear and kinetoplast DNA, as determined by the multiple DAPI staining foci, but failed to undergo cell division, resulting in cells with multiple nuclei, kinetoplasts, and flagella. These parasites are similar to the “monster” cell phenotype originally described for RNAi directed against mRNAs encoding various flagellar axoneme proteins (31Broadhead R. Dawe H.R. Farr H.

Microscopic quantification of parasites with a normal complement of kinetoplasts and nuclei (1K1N) or with altered numbers of both genomes (e.g. 2K1N, 2K2N, etc.) revealed that 1N1K parasites are reduced rapidly following induction of RNAi and that monster cells like those in Fig. 4G began to dominate the population increasingly from 0 to 48 h (Fig. 4D). Additionally, the flagella became detached from the cell body along their length as early as 12 h. Microscopic observation of live cells revealed that detached flagella remained motile even after 48 h of RNAi induction, similar to the phenotype reported upon RNAi of TbFLA1 (24LaCount D.J.

Images show a number of abnormalities, including multiple flagellar pockets, multiple axonemes within single flagellar membranes (Fig. 5, A and B), axonemes without flagellar membranes (Fig. 5C), enlarged flagellar pockets (Fig. 5D), multiple nuclei in close apposition (Fig. 5E), and nuclei with apparent membranous inclusions, which represent invaginations of the nuclear envelope (Fig. 5, F–H).

https://openalex.org/W2493860774,"Motivation First identified as an issue in 1996, duplication in biological databases introduces redundancy and even leads to inconsistency when contradictory information appears. The amount of data makes purely manual de-duplication impractical, and existing automatic systems cannot detect duplicates as precisely as can experts. Supervised learning has the potential to address such problems by building automatic systems that learn from expert curation to detect duplicates precisely and efficiently. While machine learning is a mature approach in other duplicate detection contexts, it has seen only preliminary application in genomic sequence databases. Results We developed and evaluated a supervised duplicate detection method based on an expert curated dataset of duplicates, containing over one million pairs across five organisms derived from genomic sequence databases. We selected 22 features to represent distinct attributes of the database records, and developed a binary model and a multi-class model. Both models achieve promising performance; under cross-validation, the binary model had over 90% accuracy in each of the five organisms, while the multi-class model maintains high accuracy and is more robust in generalisation. We performed an ablation study to quantify the impact of different sequence record features, finding that features derived from meta-data, sequence identity, and alignment quality impact performance most strongly. The study demonstrates machine learning can be an effective additional tool for de-duplication of genomic sequence databases. All Data are available as described in the supplementary material."

Lcn2 activation requires formation of a complex containing IκBζ and NF-κB p50, a transcription factor that harbors the DNA-binding Rel homology region but lacks a trans-activation domain, on the promoter with the canonical NF-κB-binding site (κB site) and its downstream cytosine-rich element.

https://openalex.org/W2487228218,"Mutations in the erm(41) gene of M.abscessus group organisms are associated with differences in inducible macrolide resistance, with current recommendations being to hold rapidly growing isolates for up to 14 days in order to ensure that resistance which develops more slowly can be detected. This study aimed to determine the ideal incubation time for accurate identification of inducible macrolide resistance as well as to determine if there was an association between the time taken to detect inducible resistance in M.abscessus group organisms and their erm(41) sequevar. We amplified and sequenced the erm(41) genes of a total of 104 M.abscessus group isolates and determined their sequevars. The isolates were tested for phenotypic clarithromycin resistance at days 7, 10, 14 and 21, using Trek Diagnostics Sensititre RAPMYCO microbroth dilution plates. Associations between erm(41) gene sequevars and time to detection of resistance were evaluated using Fisher's exact test in R. The samples included in this study fell into 14 sequevars, with the majority of samples falling into Sequevar02 (16), Sequevar06 (15), Sequevar08 (7) and Sequvar 15 (31), and several isolates that were in small clusters, or unique. The majority (82.7%) of samples exhibiting inducible macrolide resistance were interpreted as resistant by day 7. Two isolates in Sequevar02, which has a T28C mutation that is associated with sensitivity, showed intermediate resistance at day 14, though the majority (13) were sensitive at day 14. The majority of isolates with inducible macrolide resistance fell into Sequevars 06,08 and 15, none of which contain the T28C mutation. These sequevars were analyzed to determine if there was any correlation between sequevar and time to detection of resistance. None was found. Based on these findings, we recommend the addition of a day 7 read to the CLSI guidelines to improve turn-around-times for these isolates. It is also recommended that erm(41) gene sequencing be added to routine phenotypic testing for the resolution of cases with difficult-to-interpret phenotypic results."
https://openalex.org/W2487440923,"Background Obesity reflects a chronic inflammatory environment that may contribute to prostate cancer progression and poor treatment outcomes. However, it is not clear which mechanisms drive this association within the tumor microenvironment. The aim of this pilot study was to examine prostatic inflammation via tumor infiltrating lymphocytes and macrophages characterized by obesity and cancer severity. Methods We studied paraffin-embedded prostatectomy tissue from 99 participants (63 non-obese and 36 obese) from the Study of Clinical Outcomes, Risk and Ethnicity (University of Pennsylvania). Pathologists analyzed the tissue for type and count of lymphocytes and macrophages, including CD3, CD8, FOXP3, and CD68. Pathology data were linked to clinical and demographic variables. Statistical analyses included frequency tables, Kruskal-Wallis tests, Spearman correlations, and multivariable models. Results We observed positive univariate associations between the number of CD68 cells and tumor grade (p = 0.019). In multivariable analysis, CD8 counts were associated with time to biochemical failure (HR = 1.09, 95% CI = 1.004–1.192, p-value = 0.041.) There were no differences in lymphocytes or macrophages by obesity status or BMI. Conclusions The number of lymphocytes and macrophages in the tumor microenvironment did not differ by obesity status. However, these inflammation markers were associated with poor prostate cancer outcomes. Further examination of underlying mechanisms that influence obesity-related effects on prostate cancer outcomes is warranted. Such research will guide immunotherapy protocols and weight management as they apply to diverse patient populations and phenotypes."
https://openalex.org/W2504005424,"Identifying the motives underpinning punishment is crucial for understanding its evolved function. In principle, punishment of distributional inequality could be motivated by the desire to reciprocate losses ('revenge') or by the desire to reduce payoff asymmetries between the punisher and the target ('inequality aversion'). By separating these two possible motivations, recent work suggests that punishment is more likely to be motivated by disadvantageous inequality aversion than by a desire for revenge. Nevertheless, these findings have not consistently replicated across different studies. Here, we suggest that considering country of origin—previously overlooked as a possible source of variation in responses—is important for understanding when and why individuals punish one another. We conducted a two-player stealing game with punishment, using data from 2,400 subjects recruited from the USA and India. US-based subjects punished in response to losses and disadvantageous inequality, but seldom invested in antisocial punishment (defined here as punishment of non-stealing partners). India-based subjects, on the other hand, punished at higher levels than US-based subjects and, so long as they did not experience disadvantageous inequality, punished stealing and non-stealing partners indiscriminately. Nevertheless, as in the USA, when stealing resulted in disadvantageous inequality, India-based subjects punished stealing partners more than non-stealing partners. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that variation in punitive behavior varies across societies, and support the idea that punishment might sometimes function to improve relative status, rather than to enforce cooperation."

https://openalex.org/W2497524764,"Principal neurons in the medial nucleus of the trapezoid body (MNTB) receive strong and temporally precise excitatory input from globular bushy cells in the cochlear nucleus through the calyx of Held. The extremely large synaptic currents produced by the calyx have sometimes led to the view of the MNTB as a simple relay synapse which converts incoming excitation to outgoing inhibition. However, electrophysiological and anatomical studies have shown the additional presence of inhibitory glycinergic currents that are large enough to suppress action potentials in MNTB neurons at least in some cases. The source(s) of glycinergic inhibition to MNTB are not fully understood. One major extrinsic source of glycinergic inhibitory input to MNTB is the ventral nucleus of the trapezoid body. However, it has been suggested that MNTB neurons receive additional inhibitory inputs via intrinsic connections (collaterals of glycinergic projections of MNTB neurons). While several authors have postulated their presence, these collaterals have never been examined in detail. Here we test the hypothesis that collaterals of MNTB principal cells provide glycinergic inhibition to the MNTB. We injected dye into single principal neurons in the MNTB, traced their projections, and immunohistochemically identified their synapses. We found that collaterals terminate within the MNTB and provide an additional source of inhibition to other principal cells, creating an inhibitory microcircuit within the MNTB. Only about a quarter to a third of MNTB neurons receive such collateral inputs. This microcircuit could produce side band inhibition and enhance frequency tuning of MNTB neurons, consistent with physiological observations."

The γδ T cells represent a minor population of human peripheral blood T lymphocytes and are involved in tumor immunosurveillance and immune defense against pathogenic infection (1Vantourout P.

A clear understanding of the roles of γδ T cells in autoimmune diseases remains unknown and even contradictory (9Su D. Shen M. Li X. Sun L. Roles of γδ T cells in the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases.Clin. Dev. Immunol. 2013; 2013: 985753Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar).

In contrast, we and another group have shown that γδ T cells have regulatory roles in preventing an autoimmune response and relieving autoimmune disease symptoms (12Li X. Kang N. Zhang X. Dong X.

Understanding how human γδ T cells recognize autoimmune disease-related antigens could clarify the role of γδ T cells in autoimmune diseases. We previously established a novel technical strategy to identify human TCRγδ-recognized proteins based on the binding specificity of complementarity-determining region 3 in TCRδ chain (CDR3δ) (8Chen H. He X. Wang Z. Wu D. Zhang H. Xu C. He H. Cui L. Ba D. He W. Identification of human T cell receptor γδ-recognized epitopes/proteins via CDR3δ peptide-based immunobiochemical strategy.J. Biol.

We identified a DNA mismatch repair protein, hMSH2, as a stress-induced antigen, ectopically expressed on the cytomembrane of tumor cells and recognized by γδ T cells (14Dai Y. Chen H. Mo C. Cui L.

In this study, we investigated CDR3δ characteristics in peripheral blood γδ T cells from systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) patients, a common autoimmune disease that causes severe immune system dysregulation. We observed several distinct oligoclonal characteristics in the length of Vδ2 CDR3 of patients when compared with healthy controls. We found that γδ T cells infiltrated lupus nephritis tissues. Our results demonstrate that CDR3δ peptide SL2, synthesized according to the dominant CDR3δ sequences in SLE patients, specifically bound to a human renal proximal tubular epithelial cell line HK-2, and blocked the cytotoxicity of γδ T cells to target cells. In addition, we show that the chaperonin-containing T-complex protein 1 subunit ζ (CCT6A) is a target for peptide SL2 via SL2-mediated affinity chromatography and liquid chromatography-electrospray ionizationtandem mass spectrometry (LC ESI-MS/MS) analysis. Immunoprecipitation assay was performed to validate the binding of SL2 peptide to CCT6A in 293T Tet-Off cells. Furthermore, we found that CCT6A expressed on the surface of HK-2 cells. Cytotoxicity of Vδ2 γδ T cells to HK-2 cells was blocked by anti-CCT6A antibody, suggesting that CCT6A is a novel ligand for Vδ2 TCRγδ. Finally, we observed a significant increase in CCT6A concentration in the plasma from SLE and rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients. In summary, we discovered a novel ligand related to autoimmune diseases for human γδ T cells. These findings highlight a γδ T cell-mediated mechanism in autoimmune diseases. Thirty-seven Chinese patients with SLE (30 females and 7 males, age 19–61 with an average age of 38 ± 12 years) and 36 patients with RA (31 females and 5 males, age 25–77 with an average age of 51 ± 11 years) were enrolled in this study. All patients were inpatients under the treatment as shown in Table 4. (SLE: 92% glucocorticosteroids; 76% immunosuppressor; 27% antimalarials; 16% recombinant antibody; 57% others. RA: 67% immunosuppressor; 53% glucocorticosteroids; 33% non-steroid anti-inflammatory drug; 53% antimalarials; 11% recombinant antibody; 75% others.) Forty-two healthy volunteers were enrolled as controls (29 females and 13 males, age 25–75 with an average age of 47 ± 11 years). Peking Union Medical College Hospital ethical committee approved the study.TABLE 4The plasma CCT6A concentration of SLE/RA patients under different treatmentsSLE (n = 37)RA (n = 36)TreatmentCaseCCT6A (ng/ml)TreatmentCaseCCT6A (ng/ml)Glucocorticosteroids3455.7 ± 11.5Glucocorticosteroids1998.1 ± 34.2Immunosuppressor2854.2 ± 11.4Immunosuppressor24101.9 ± 32.9Antimalarials1060.8 ± 8.7Antimalarials1984.1 ± 31.2Recombinant antibody658.3 ± 5.3Recombinant antibody485.8 ± 15.4Others2156.8 ± 9.7Non-steroid anti-inflammatory drug1280.4 ± 31.7Others2791.8 ± 32.8 Open table in a new tab Total RNA from 1 × 107 peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) was isolated from SLE patients and healthy controls with TRIzol reagent (Promega). cDNA was synthesized using oligo(dT) (Promega) and Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Promega). For gene scan analysis, the CDR3 regions of δ2 chain were amplified by PCR using FAM-marked primers as follows: forward, 5′-GCACCATCAGAGAGAGATGAAGGG-3′; reverse, 5′-FAM-AAACGGATGGTTTGGTATGAGGC-3′. Amplified DNA was subjected to agarose gel electrophoresis, fluorescence intensity was scanned by ABI sequencer Model 3700 and analyzed by GeneScan software. For CDR3 sequencing, the entire V region of δ2 chain was amplified by the following primers: forward, 5′-GCCATTGAGTTGGTGCCTGAACAC-3′; reverse, 5′-AAACGGATGGTTTGGTATGAGGC-3′. Amplified DNA was cloned into the pGEM-T easy vector (Promega) and sequenced with the ABI automatic sequencer 377. Four CDR3δ peptides were synthesized. SL1 and SL2 (SL1, ACDSVTLGDTGTDKLIFGKG; SL2, ACDTLVSTDKLIFGRG) corresponded to the dominant sequences derived from SLE patients. Two structurally similar peptides, SL1-Vm and SL2-Vm, were synthesized with mutations in the v gene segment (QEHSVTLGDTGTDKLIFGKG and TQEHLVSTDKLIFGRG, respectively); amino acids in CDR3 for each CDR3δ peptide were used as controls. All peptides were biotinylated using a EZ-LinkTM Sulfo-NHS-LC-Biotinylation Kit for detection. Peptides were synthesized by the Academy of Military Medical Sciences, Beijing, China. The purity of each peptide was 85% in HPLC analysis. The human renal proximal tubule epithelial cell line HK-2 was maintained in DMEM/F-12 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Invitrogen). Fresh PBMCs, separated from peripheral blood of healthy donors by density gradient centrifugation on a Ficoll-Hypaque (Dakewe, Beijing, China), were grown in RPMI1640 (Gibco BRL) medium with 10% FCS, IL-2 (200 units/ml) in 24-well culture plates. Fresh isolated PBMCs from healthy donors were cultured in RPMI1640 (Gibco BRL) medium with 10% FCS, IL-2 (200 units/ml) in 24-well culture plates with immobilized recombinant CCT6A protein (CUSABIO,10 μg/ml). Plates with immobilized BSA (Sigma,10 μg/ml) were used as a control. After 2 weeks of culture, the purity of γδ T cells was analyzed by flow cytometry with TCRγδ staining. CD69 staining was applied to detect the activation of γδ T cells at the same time. CDR3δ peptide-mediated binding activity to target cells (HK-2 cells/PBMCs) and CCT6A expression on HK-2 cells/PBMCs were measured with immunofluorescence assays. For flow cytometry assay, cells were incubated with biotinylated SL2 (20 μg) goat anti-human CCT6A polyclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). FITC-conjugated streptavidin (Pierce) or FITC-conjugated donkey anti-goat IgG antibody (Pierce) was then added and incubated for 30 min at 4 °C; SL2-Vm and goat IgG (Zhongshan, Beijing, China) were used as controls, respectively. The cells were analyzed on a FACSAria flow cytometer (BD Biosciences). For confocal microscopy, cells were fixed on slides in 2% cold paraformaldehyde and incubated with goat anti-human CCT6A polyclonal antibody and FITC-conjugated donkey anti-goat IgG antibody. Cells incubated with goat IgG served as controls. Slides were examined with a confocal laser microscope (LSM 510; Carl Zeiss). The 96-well plates were coated with HK-2 cells (4 × 105) or the total cell lysis of HK-2 cells (10 μg) or the plasma (10 μl) of SLE patients and healthy controls. After blocking with 3% BSA solution, plates were incubated with biotinylated CDR3δ peptides (10 μg/well) and HRP-conjugated streptavidin (0.01 μg/well) and then read on a microplate reader (LabSystems) at 450/630 nm. Vδ2 γδ T cells (purity over 90%), amplified from PBMCs by anti-pan-TCRγδ-monoclonal antibody (Immunotech), were rested in the medium without IL-2 for 24 h before stimulation with CCT6A protein (CUSABIO, 5 μg/ml) or BSA (Sigma,5 μg/ml) for 24 h. Human IL-2 and IFN-γ ELISA kits (Beijing 4A Biotech) were used to measure the concentration of IL-2 and IFN-γ in the supernatant. Human CCT6A ELISA kit (CUSABIO) was used for detection of CCT6A concentration in human plasma. Antibody-coated wells were incubated with 100 μl of plasma from SLE patients, RA patients, and healthy donors (100× dilution) and then detected according to the user manual. CCT6A standards were used for quantification. HK-2 target cells were added to 96-well plates at a density of 3 × 104 cells/well, incubated with SL2 peptide (40 μg) for 2 h at 37 °C. γδ T cells, amplified from PBMCs by immobilized anti-pan-TCRγδ-monoclonal antibody, were added to the plate as effector cells at effector/target ratios (E:T) of 1:1, 10:1, and 20:1, respectively, and each condition was plated in triplicate. In addition, αβT cells, Vδ1 T cells, and Vδ2 T cells were sorted and subjected as effector cells in antibody blocking assay to determine the cytotoxicities to tumor cells of which effector cells are mediated by CCT6A (E:T = 5:1, anti-CCT6A antibody: 0.8 μg, mock: equivalent amount of irrelevant isotype antibody). The four control groups used were: maximal cpm release group, volume-corrected group, background group, and spontaneous cpm release group. The cytotoxicity assay was conducted according to manufacturer's instructions (Cyto Tox 96 nonradioactive cytotoxicity assay reagent kit (Promega)). SL2 peptide (5 mg) was coupled to a 1-ml HiTrap NHS-activated HP column (Amersham Biosciences) through its C terminus hydroxyl group in coupling buffer. The excess active groups uncoupled to SL2 peptide were deactivated according to manufacturer's instructions. SL2-coupled column was then equilibrated with binding buffer (20 mm PBS, pH 7.0). After HK-2 cell total proteins were added to the column, the OD value of the outflow was detected at 280 nm and elution buffer (1% formic acid) was changed until the A280 returned to the baseline. The fractions containing eluted proteins were collected and neutralized quickly with 1 m Tris-HCl (pH 9.1). Throughout the process, the flow rate was kept under 0.2 ml/min. The enriched proteins from affinity chromatography were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. The biotinylated SL2 or SL2-Vm peptide (10 μg/ml) was used as the primary antibody, and HRP-streptavidin was used as the secondary antibody. Chemiluminescent HRP substrate (Pierce) was added, and the blot was exposed to x-ray film. The in-gel trypsin digestion and MS analysis of specific SDS-PAGE protein bands were conducted at the Beijing Proteome Research Center, China. LC ESI-MS/MS analyses were performed using a LTQ system (Thermo Finnigan). Tryptic peptide mixtures were loaded onto a capillary column (15-cm length, 75-μm inner diameter). The elution from the reverse phase liquid chromatography (RPLC) column was analyzed by MS. MS/MS spectra were searched using the SEQUEST algorithm-based BioWorks version 3.2 (Thermo Finnigan) against the International Protein Index (IPI) human database 3.19, which had 60,397 entries. Proteins with at least two unique “identity” score peptides were considered unambiguously identified, and the single peptide-matched proteins were rejected. The Gateway cloning system was used to produce overexpression of CCT6A in 293T Tet-Off cells. CCT6A cDNA fragment was transferred from an entry clone into a destination vector generating the expression clone through the LR Clonase reaction. The entry clone (which included a CCT6A cDNA fragment) destination vector (75 ng), LR Clonase mix (Invitrogen, 2 μl), and TE buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, 1 mm EDTA, pH = 8.0) were added to a 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tube and mixed. Reactions were incubated for 3 h at 25 °C. 1 μl of the proteinase K solution (Invitrogen)was added to the reactions to terminate the reaction. Sample was incubated at 37 °C for 10 min. The product was transformed to trans5-α, and positive clones were confirmed by restriction enzyme digestion. After transfection to 293T Tet-Off cells, the whole cell lysis solution was analyzed by Western blotting using anti-GFP (Abmart) primary antibody to identify the overexpression of CCT6A in 293T Tet-Off cells. Biotinylated ST2 (50 μg) and ST2-Vm (50 μg) peptides were incubated with 293T Tet-Off whole cell lysate (200 μg) overnight at 4 °C with rotation. 20 μl of streptavidin-conjugated Sepharose beads were added to the system and incubated for 3 h at 4 °C with rotation. Pellets were washed five times with cell lysis buffer. The pellet was resuspended with 20 μl of 1× SDS sample buffer and vortexed, and the sample was heated to 95–100 °C for 2–5 min. The sample was loaded on a 8% gel for SDS-PAGE. The sample was analyzed by Western blotting using anti-GFP primary antibody. All data were analyzed using SPSS version 13.0 software. One-way analyses of variance were used to compare data with normal distribution and homogeneity of variance. Independent sample t tests were used to compare means between two groups. p values < 0.05 were considered significant. All tests were two-tailed. Our previous study described a critical role for CDR3δ in antigen recognition specificity of human γδ T cells (8Chen H. He X. Wang Z. Wu D. Zhang H. Xu C. He H. Cui L. Ba D. He W.

To further describe γδ T cells in autoimmune diseases, we PCR-amplified the TCR Vδ2 CDR3 region (∼170 bp) and the entire V region of δ2 chain (∼300 bp) in SLE patients and healthy controls (Fig. 1A). We used gene scan analysis to determine length distribution of CDR3δ and used sequencing to define amino acid sequences of CDR3δ regions. We show that CDR3δ length in healthy controls was in a normal distribution composed of multiple peaks. However, CDR3δ in SLE patients was focused at a certain length, showing a single peak or several peaks in spectra typing profiles (Fig. 1B). This suggests disease-related oligoclonal expansion of γδ T cells in SLE patients. However, we note that due to the huge individual differences in the specific length among SLE patients, we found no significant difference in CDR3δ length distribution when comparing all patients and controls (Table 1).TABLE 1Distribution of TCRδ2-CDR3 length in nucleotides derived from SLE patients and healthy controlsSubjectsTranscript length (bp)Healthy controls (n = 9)SLE (n = 5)p value<1300 ± 0%0.13 ± 0.4%NS130–14033.83 ± 8.02%37.76 ± 14.12%NS141–15035.54 ± 16.6%37.53 ± 21.68%NS151–16030.16 ± 11.97%22.17 ± 13.02%NS161–1700.48 ± 0.96%2.41 ± 5.11%NS Open table in a new tab A total of 221 clones in 10 SLE patients and 137 clones in 7 healthy controls were randomly selected and sequenced to identify the dominant SLE-related Vδ2 CDR3 sequences. We found no significant difference between patients and controls in the four J gene segments (J1 to J4) used (Table 2). We identified five dominant SLE-related Vδ2 CDR3 sequences (SL1, SL2, SL3, SL4, and SL5) (Table 3). Two CDR3δ peptides, SL1 and SL2, were synthesized according to their sequences. We also synthesized two peptides, SL1-Vm and SL2-Vm, with mutant V segment sequences for controls in the following tests.TABLE 2The usage of TCR Vδ2 CDR3 J segments derived from SLE patients and healthy controlsSubjectsJ segment usage (%)Healthy controls (n = 7)SLE (n = 5)p valueVδ2J193.10 ± 5.54%91.90 ± 8.87%NSJ21.63 ± 2.14%0.48 ± 1.51%NSJ34.89 ± 5.73%6.70 ± 7.51%NSJ40.39 ± 1.02%0.33 ± 1.05%NS Open table in a new tab TABLE 3Dominant CDR3 sequences of TCRδ2 chain in SLE patientsNameVNJJδ segmentPeptide synthesizedSL1ACDSVTLGDTGTDKLIFGKGJ1YSL1-VmaThe sequences of synthesized control CDR3δ peptides with a mutant V segment.

Open table in a new tab To investigate CDR3δ peptide binding specificities, we analyzed the binding of SL1 and SL2 peptides to the plasmas and PBMCs of SLE patients. We found that SL1 and SL2 peptides both bound to the plasmas of SLE patients, whereas control peptides SL1-Vm and SL2-Vm did not (Fig. 2A). However, binding was not SLE-specific; both SL1 and SL2 peptides bound to the plasmas of healthy controls as well. Flow cytometry shows nonspecific binding of SL2 peptide to PBMCs of SLE patients (Fig. 2B). Taken together, our data suggest that the synthesized CDR3δ peptides bind to certain targets in the plasma of both SLE patients and healthy controls. We analyzed the infiltration of γδ T cells in frozen renal biopsy tissues of SLE patients. Results confirm the infiltration of γδ T cells in the kidney (data not shown), suggesting that γδ T cells recognize certain antigens in renal epithelial cells. Given the infiltration of γδ T cells in the kidney of lupus nephritis patients, we used the human renal proximal tubule epithelial cell line HK-2 to validate SL2 binding specificity. We measured the binding of SL2 peptides to the human renal proximal tubule epithelial cell line HK-2 by flow cytometry, with PBMC as control cells. We found that SL2 bound HK-2 cells, but SL2-Vm did not (Fig. 3A). Binding was in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 3B). Consistent with flow cytometry results, we found that SL2 specifically bound to HK-2 cells and HK-2 cell total protein extracts in SL2-mediated ELISA, whereas SL2-Vm did not (Fig. 3C). These data indicate that the SL2 peptide, derived from dominant SLE patients, specifically binds HK-2 cells. γδ T cells lyse target cells via a TCR-mediated pathway. We determined whether binding of synthesized SL2 to HK-2 cells affects the cytotoxicity of γδ T cells to HK-2 cells using a peptide-blocking cytotoxicity assay. The purity of γδ T cells was above 80% after a 2-week culture with anti-pan-TCRγδ antibody (Fig. 3D). Our data show that cytotoxicity of γδ T cells to HK-2 cells was blocked when cells were preincubated with SL2. We found a significant difference in E:T concentration of 10:1 when compared with 20:1 (Fig. 3E). Collectively, these data show that SL2, derived from the dominant CDR3 sequence in SLE patients, specifically binds to HK-2 cells and partially blocks the cytotoxic activity of γδ T cells to HK-2 cells. This suggests that SL2 peptide and TCRγδ bind the same antigens on HK-2 cells. We screened the total cell lysate of HK-2 cells by SL2-mediated affinity chromatography. The 1-ml HiTrap NHS-activated HP column was coupled with 4.5 mg of SL2 with a coupling ratio of 90% (data not shown). The elution peak was collected after washing with elution buffer (Fig. 4A). The protein fractions were pooled and concentrated. Western blotting analysis indicated two specific protein bands, with the 35–40-kDa protein band being SL2-specific (Fig. 4B). We analyzed the specific band by LC ESI-MS/MS and found a total of 20 proteins with at least two unique peptides using a SEQUEST search. T-complex protein 1 subunit ζ had a highly similar unique peptide count and a higher cover percentage. We obtained the CCT6A cDNA by the gateway system, and successfully overexpressed the CCT6A protein in 293T Tet-Off cells (Fig. 4C). Immunoprecipitation experiments were carried out using the CCT6A overexpression cell model. The results show that CCT6A protein can be specifically precipitated by SL2 peptide (Fig. 4D), showing a direct interaction between SL2 and intracellular CCT6A protein. T-complex protein 1, also named CCT, is the most unique and complex eukaryotic cytosolic chaperonin. It is involved in the folding of only a small set of proteins. CCT is composed of two superimposed rings, each with eight different subunits (CCTα, -β, -γ, -δ, -ϵ, -ζ, -η, and -θ; CCT1–CCT8). CCT6A is the ζ subunit of CCT (16Valpuesta J.M. Martín-Benito J.

Structure and function of a protein folding machine: the eukaryotic cytosolic chaperonin CCT.FEBS Lett. 2002; 529: 11-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). To further validate the expression and function of CCT6A, we measured CCT6A expression on the cell surface of HK-2 cells by immunofluorescence assays. Our confocal images show that CCT6A antibody stained HK-2 cells on the surface and in the cytoplasm, whereas the isotype antibody did not. We did not observe this in PBMC samples (Fig. 5A). Flow cytometry results show that 14% of HK-2 cells were positive for surface staining for CCT6A, when compared with less than 2% in normal PBMC"
https://openalex.org/W2491955272,"Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, a known pathogen causing periodontal disease and infective endocarditis, is a survivor in the periodontal pocket and blood stream; both environments contain serum as a nutrient source. To screen for unknown virulence factors associated with this microorganism, A. actinomycetemcomitans was grown in serum-based media to simulate its in vivo environment. Different strains of A. actinomycetemcomitans showed distinct growth phenotypes only in the presence of human serum, and they were grouped into high- and low-responder groups. High-responders comprised mainly serotype c strains, and showed an unusual growth phenomenon, featuring a second, rapid increase in turbidity after 9-h incubation that reached a final optical density 2- to 7-fold higher than low-responders. Upon further investigation, the second increase in turbidity was not caused by cell multiplication, but by cell death. Whole transcriptomic analysis via RNA-seq identified 35 genes that were up-regulated by human serum, but not horse serum, in high-responders but not in low-responders, including prominently an alternative sigma factor rpoE (σE). A lacZ reporter construct driven by the 132-bp rpoE promoter sequence of A. actinomycetemcomitans responded dramatically to human serum within 90 min of incubation only when the construct was carried by a high responder strain. The rpoE promoter is 100% identical among high- and low-responder strains. Proteomic investigation showed potential interactions between human serum protein, e.g. apolipoprotein A1 (ApoA1) and A. actinomycetemcomitans. The data clearly indicated a different activation process for rpoE in high- versus low-responder strains. This differential human serum-specific activation of rpoE, a putative extra-cytoplasmic stress responder and global regulator, suggests distinct in vivo adaptations among different strains of A. actinomycetemcomitans."
https://openalex.org/W2502747278,"Heparan sulphate (HS), a ubiquitously expressed glycosaminoglycan (GAG), regulates multiple cellular functions by mediating interactions between numerous growth factors and their cell surface cognate receptors. However, the structural specificity of HS in these interactions remains largely undefined. Here, we used completely synthetic, structurally defined, alternating N-sulfated glucosamine (NS) and 2-O-sulfated iduronate (IS) residues to generate dodecasaccharides ([NSIS]6) that contained no, one or six glucosamine 6-O-sulfates (6S). The aim was to address how 6S contributes to the potential of defined HS dodecasaccharides to inhibit the angiogenic growth factors FGF2 and VEGF165, in vitro and in vivo. We show that the addition of a single 6S at the non-reducing end of [NSIS]6, i.e. [NSIS6S]-[NSIS]5, significantly augments the inhibition of FGF2-dependent endothelial cell proliferation, migration and sprouting in vitro when compared to the non-6S variant. In contrast, the fully 6-O-sulfated dodecasaccharide, [NSIS6S]6, is not a potent inhibitor of FGF2. Addition of a single 6S did not significantly improve inhibitory properties of [NSIS]6 when tested against VEGF165-dependent endothelial cell functions.In vivo, [NSIS6S]-[NSIS]5 blocked FGF2-dependent blood vessel formation without affecting tumor growth. Reduction of non-FGF2-dependent ovarian tumor growth occurred when [NSIS6S]-[NSIS]5 was combined with cisplatin. The degree of inhibition by [NSIS6S]-[NSIS]5 in combination with cisplatin in vivo equated with that induced by bevacizumab and sunitinib when administered with cisplatin. Evaluation of post-treatment vasculature revealed that [NSIS6S]-[NSIS]5 treatment had the greatest impact on tumor blood vessel size and lumen formation. Our data for the first time demonstrate that synthetic, structurally defined oligosaccharides have potential to be developed as active anti-angiogenic agents that sensitize tumors to chemotherapeutic agents."

https://openalex.org/W2501807839,"Mutations in genes that code for components of the Norrin-FZD4 ligand-receptor complex cause the inherited childhood blinding disorder familial exudative vitreoretinopathy (FEVR). Statistical evidence from studies of patients at risk for the acquired disease retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) suggest that rare polymorphisms in these same genes increase the risk of developing severe ROP, implying that decreased Norrin-FZD4 activity predisposes patients to more severe ROP. To test this hypothesis, we measured the development and recovery of retinopathy in wild type and Fzd4 heterozygous mice in the absence or presence of ocular ischemic retinopathy (OIR) treatment. Avascular and total retinal vascular areas and patterning were determined, and vessel number and caliber were quantified. In room air, there was a small delay in retinal vascularization in Fzd4 heterozygous mice that resolved as mice reached maturity suggestive of a slight defect in retinal vascular development. Subsequent to OIR treatment there was no difference between wild type and Fzd4 heterozygous mice in the vaso-obliterated area following exposure to high oxygen. Importantly, after return of Fzd4 heterozygous mice to room air subsequent to OIR treatment, there was a substantial delay in retinal revascularization of the avascular area surrounding the optic nerve, as well as delayed vascularization toward the periphery of the retina. Our study demonstrates that a small decrease in Norrin-Fzd4 dependent retinal vascular development lengthens the period during which complications from OIR could occur."
https://openalex.org/W2479148481,"A set of conserved binding sites recognized by a transcription factor is called a motif, which can be found by many applications of comparative genomics for identifying over-represented segments. Moreover, when numerous putative motifs are predicted from a collection of genome-wide data, their similarity data can be represented as a large graph, where these motifs are connected to one another. However, an efficient clustering algorithm is desired for clustering the motifs that belong to the same groups and separating the motifs that belong to different groups, or even deleting an amount of spurious ones. In this work, a new motif clustering algorithm, CLIMP, is proposed by using maximal cliques and sped up by parallelizing its program. When a synthetic motif dataset from the database JASPAR, a set of putative motifs from a phylogenetic foot-printing dataset, and a set of putative motifs from a ChIP dataset are used to compare the performances of CLIMP and two other high-performance algorithms, the results demonstrate that CLIMP mostly outperforms the two algorithms on the three datasets for motif clustering, so that it can be a useful complement of the clustering procedures in some genome-wide motif prediction pipelines. CLIMP is available at http://sqzhang.cn/climp.html."
https://openalex.org/W2483421051,"Little is known about the prevalence, functionality and ecological roles of temperate phages for members of the mycolic acid producing bacteria, the Mycolata. While many lytic phages infective for these organisms have been isolated, and assessed for their suitability for use as biological control agents of activated sludge foaming, no studies have investigated how temperate phages might be induced for this purpose. Bioinformatic analysis using the PHAge Search Tool (PHAST) on Mycolata whole genome sequence data in GenBank for members of the genera Gordonia, Mycobacterium, Nocardia, Rhodococcus, and Tsukamurella revealed 83% contained putative prophage DNA sequences. Subsequent prophage inductions using mitomycin C were conducted on 17 Mycolata strains. This led to the isolation and genome characterization of three novel Caudovirales temperate phages, namely GAL1, GMA1, and TPA4, induced from Gordonia alkanivorans, Gordonia malaquae, and Tsukamurella paurometabola, respectively. All possessed highly distinctive dsDNA genome sequences."
https://openalex.org/W2490748749,"Essentialist beliefs about social groups can contribute to prejudice and intergroup distancing. To date, little data have been gathered regarding minority group members' essentialistic thinking about the White majority in the U.S. Do essentialist beliefs show a similar structure when minority group members are thinking about the majority as when the majority group is thinking about the minority group? Do minority group essentialist beliefs predict affective prejudice and diminished desire for intergroup contact as they do among White respondents? We sought answers to these questions in a study that included 248 African American participants. We found clear evidence that the structure of Blacks' essentialist thinking about Whites matches the structure of Whites' essentialist thinking about Blacks. Specifically, Black respondents made a distinction between bio-somatic and bio-behavioral essentialism, and reported stronger endorsement of the former as compared to the latter. Also replicating prior studies of Whites' essentialist thinking, only bio-behavioral essentialist beliefs were predictive of negative attitudes. This suggests that essentialism can be linked to prejudice even in contexts that do not involve a dominant group rationalizing its social advantages. Discussion centers on implications of this work for prejudice reduction."
https://openalex.org/W2501503183,"For the purposes of information retrieval, users must find highly relevant documents from within a system (and often a quite large one comprised of many individual documents) based on input query. Ranking the documents according to their relevance within the system to meet user needs is a challenging endeavor, and a hot research topic-there already exist several rank-learning methods based on machine learning techniques which can generate ranking functions automatically. This paper proposes a parallel B cell algorithm, RankBCA, for rank learning which utilizes a clonal selection mechanism based on biological immunity. The novel algorithm is compared with traditional rank-learning algorithms through experimentation and shown to outperform the others in respect to accuracy, learning time, and convergence rate; taken together, the experimental results show that the proposed algorithm indeed effectively and rapidly identifies optimal ranking functions."

https://openalex.org/W2502203446,"Recent development in 3D printing technology has opened an exciting possibility for manufacturing 3D devices on one's desktop. We used 3D modeling programs to design 3D models of a tissue-handling system and these models were ""printed"" in a stereolithography (SLA) 3D printer to create precision histology devices that are particularly useful to handle multiple samples with small dimensions in parallel. Our system has been successfully tested for in situ hybridization of zebrafish embryos. Some of the notable features include: (1) A conveniently transferrable chamber with 6 mesh-bottomed wells, each of which can hold dozens of zebrafish embryos. This design allows up to 6 different samples to be treated per chamber. (2) Each chamber sits in a well of a standard 6-well tissue culture plate. Thus, up to 36 different samples can be processed in tandem using a single 6 well plate. (3) Precisely fitting lids prevent solution evaporation and condensation, even at high temperatures for an extended period of time: i.e., overnight riboprobe hybridization. (4) Flat bottom mesh maximizes the consistent treatment of individual tissue samples. (5) A magnet-based lifter was created to handle up to 6 chambers (= 36 samples) in unison. (6) The largely transparent resin aids in convenient visual inspection both with eyes and using a stereomicroscope. (7) Surface engraved labeling enables an accurate tracking of different samples. (8) The dimension of wells and chambers minimizes the required amount of precious reagents. (9) Flexible parametric modeling enables an easy redesign of the 3D models to handle larger or more numerous samples. Precise dimensions of 3D models and demonstration of how we use our devices in whole mount in situ hybridization are presented. We also provide detailed information on the modeling software, 3D printing tips, as well as 3D files that can be used with any 3D printer."
