https://openalex.org/W584481888,"The cattle rumen has a diverse microbial ecosystem that is essential for the host to digest plant material. Extremes in body weight (BW) gain in mice and humans have been associated with different intestinal microbial populations. The objective of this study was to characterize the microbiome of the cattle rumen among steers differing in feed efficiency. Two contemporary groups of steers (n=148 and n=197) were fed a ration (dry matter basis) of 57.35% dry-rolled corn, 30% wet distillers grain with solubles, 8% alfalfa hay, 4.25% supplement, and 0.4% urea for 63 days. Individual feed intake (FI) and BW gain were determined. Within contemporary group, the four steers within each Cartesian quadrant were sampled (n=16/group) from the bivariate distribution of average daily BW gain and average daily FI. Bacterial 16S rRNA gene amplicons were sequenced from the harvested bovine rumen fluid samples using next-generation sequencing technology. No significant changes in diversity or richness were indicated, and UniFrac principal coordinate analysis did not show any separation of microbial communities within the rumen. However, the abundances of relative microbial populations and operational taxonomic units did reveal significant differences with reference to feed efficiency groups. Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes were the dominant phyla in all ruminal groups, with significant population shifts in relevant ruminal taxa, including phyla Firmicutes and Lentisphaerae, as well as genera Succiniclasticum, Lactobacillus, Ruminococcus, and Prevotella. This study suggests the involvement of the rumen microbiome as a component influencing the efficiency of weight gain at the 16S level, which can be utilized to better understand variations in microbial ecology as well as host factors that will improve feed efficiency."
https://openalex.org/W900693193,"The goal of the current study was to gain insight into the prevalence and concentrations of antimicrobial resistant (AMR) Escherichia coli in Dutch surface water, and to explore the role of wastewater as AMR contamination source.The prevalence of AMR E. coli was determined in 113 surface water samples obtained from 30 different water bodies, and in 33 wastewater samples obtained at five health care institutions (HCIs), seven municipal wastewater treatment plants (mWWTPs), and an airport WWTP. Overall, 846 surface water and 313 wastewater E. coli isolates were analysed with respect to susceptibility to eight antimicrobials (representing seven different classes): ampicillin, cefotaxime, tetracycline, ciprofloxacin, streptomycin, sulfamethoxazole, trimethoprim, and chloramphenicol.Among surface water isolates, 26% were resistant to at least one class of antimicrobials, and 11% were multidrug-resistant (MDR). In wastewater, the proportions of AMR/MDR E. coli were 76%/62% at HCIs, 69%/19% at the airport WWTP, and 37%/27% and 31%/20% in mWWTP influents and effluents, respectively. Median concentrations of MDR E. coli were 2.2×10(2), 4.0×10(4), 1.8×10(7), and 4.1×10(7) cfu/l in surface water, WWTP effluents, WWTP influents and HCI wastewater, respectively. The different resistance types occurred with similar frequencies among E. coli from surface water and E. coli from municipal wastewater. By contrast, among E. coli from HCI wastewater, resistance to cefotaxime and resistance to ciprofloxacin were significantly overrepresented compared to E. coli from municipal wastewater and surface water. Most cefotaxime-resistant E. coliisolates produced ESBL. In two of the mWWTP, ESBL-producing variants were detected that were identical with respect to phylogenetic group, sequence type, AMR-profile, and ESBL-genotype to variants from HCI wastewater discharged onto the same sewer and sampled on the same day (A1/ST23/CTX-M-1, B23/ST131/CTX-M-15, D2/ST405/CTX-M-15).In conclusion, our data show that MDR E. coli are omnipresent in Dutch surface water, and indicate that municipal wastewater significantly contributes to this occurrence."
https://openalex.org/W587542338,"Background The Chinese sturgeon (Acipenser sinensis) is endangered through anthropogenic activities including over-fishing, damming, shipping, and pollution. Controlled reproduction has been adopted and successfully conducted for conservation. However, little information is available on the reproductive regulation of the species. In this study, we conducted de novo transcriptome assembly of the gonad tissue to create a comprehensive dataset for A. sinensis. Results The Illumina sequencing platform was adopted to obtain 47,333,701 and 47,229,705 high quality reads from testis and ovary cDNA libraries generated from three-year-old A. sinensis. We identified 86,027 unigenes of which 30,268 were annotated in the NCBI non-redundant protein database and 28,281 were annotated in the Swiss-prot database. Among the annotated unigenes, 26,152 and 7,734 unigenes, respectively, were assigned to gene ontology categories and clusters of orthologous groups. In addition, 12,557 unigenes were mapped to 231 pathways in the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes Pathway database. A total of 1,896 unigenes, potentially differentially expressed between the two gonad types, were found, with 1,894 predicted to be up-regulated in ovary and only two in testis. Fifty-five potential gametogenesis-related genes were screened in the transcriptome and 34 genes with significant matches were found. Besides, more paralogs of 11 genes in three gene families (sox, apolipoprotein and cyclin) were found in A. sinensis compared to their orthologs in the diploid Danio rerio. In addition, 12,151 putative simple sequence repeats (SSRs) were detected. Conclusions This study provides the first de novo transcriptome analysis currently available for A. sinensis. The transcriptomic data represents the fundamental resource for future research on the mechanism of early gametogenesis in sturgeons. The SSRs identified in this work will be valuable for assessment of genetic diversity of wild fish and genealogy management of cultured fish."
https://openalex.org/W2114021387,"Decellularisation of skeletal muscle provides a system to study the interactions of myoblasts with muscle extracellular matrix (ECM). This study describes the efficient decellularisation of quadriceps muscle with the retention of matrix components and the use of this matrix for myoblast proliferation and differentiation under serum free culture conditions. Three decellularisation approaches were examined; the most effective was phospholipase A2 treatment, which removed cellular material while maximizing the retention of ECM components. Decellularised muscle matrices were then solubilized and used as substrates for C2C12 mouse myoblast serum free cultures. The muscle matrix supported myoblast proliferation and differentiation equally as well as collagen and fibronectin. Immunofluorescence analyses revealed that myoblasts seeded on muscle matrix and fibronectin differentiated to form long, well-aligned myotubes, while myoblasts seeded on collagen were less organized. qPCR analyses showed a time dependent increase in genes involved in skeletal muscle differentiation and suggested that muscle-derived matrix may stimulate an increased rate of differentiation compared to collagen and fibronectin. Decellularized whole muscle three-dimensional scaffolds also supported cell adhesion and spreading, with myoblasts aligning along specific tracts of matrix proteins within the scaffolds. Thus, under serum free conditions, intact acellular muscle matrices provided cues to direct myoblast adhesion and migration. In addition, myoblasts were shown to rapidly secrete and organise their own matrix glycoproteins to create a localized ECM microenvironment. This serum free culture system has revealed that the correct muscle ECM facilitates more rapid cell organisation and differentiation than single matrix glycoprotein substrates."
https://openalex.org/W2110973227,"Increasing sand temperatures resulting from climate change may negatively impact sea turtle nests by altering sex ratios and decreasing reproductive output. We analyzed the effect of nest shading and watering on sand temperatures as climate mitigation strategies in a beach hatchery at Playa Grande, Costa Rica. We set up plots and placed thermocouples at depths of 45 cm and 75 cm. Half of the plots were shaded and half were exposed to the sun. Within these exposure treatments, we applied three watering treatments over one month, replicating local climatic conditions experienced in this area. We also examined gravimetric water content of sand by collecting sand samples the day before watering began, the day after watering was complete, and one month after completion. Shading had the largest impact on sand temperature, followed by watering and depth. All watering treatments lowered sand temperature, but the effect varied with depth. Temperatures in plots that received water returned to control levels within 10 days after watering stopped. Water content increased at both depths in the two highest water treatments, and 30 days after the end of water application remained higher than plots with low water. While the impacts of watering on sand temperature dissipate rapidly after the end of application, the impacts on water content are much more lasting. Although less effective at lowering sand temperatures than shading, watering may benefit sea turtle clutches by offsetting negative impacts of low levels of rain in particularly dry areas. Prior to implementing such strategies, the natural conditions at the location of interest (e.g. clutch depth, environmental conditions, and beach characteristics) and natural hatchling sex ratios should be taken into consideration. These results provide insight into the effectiveness of nest shading and watering as climate mitigation techniques and illustrate important points of consideration in the crafting of such strategies."
https://openalex.org/W568321271,"Understanding the three-dimensional (3-D) micro-architecture of lung tissue can provide insights into the pathology of lung disease. Micro computed tomography (µCT) has previously been used to elucidate lung 3D histology and morphometry in fixed samples that have been stained with contrast agents or air inflated and dried. However, non-destructive microstructural 3D imaging of formalin-fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) tissues would facilitate retrospective analysis of extensive tissue archives of lung FFPE lung samples with linked clinical data.FFPE human lung tissue samples (n = 4) were scanned using a Nikon metrology µCT scanner. Semi-automatic techniques were used to segment the 3D structure of airways and blood vessels. Airspace size (mean linear intercept, Lm) was measured on µCT images and on matched histological sections from the same FFPE samples imaged by light microscopy to validate µCT imaging.The µCT imaging protocol provided contrast between tissue and paraffin in FFPE samples (15 mm x 7 mm). Resolution (voxel size 6.7 µm) in the reconstructed images was sufficient for semi-automatic image segmentation of airways and blood vessels as well as quantitative airspace analysis. The scans were also used to scout for regions of interest, enabling time-efficient preparation of conventional histological sections. The Lm measurements from µCT images were not significantly different to those from matched histological sections.We demonstrated how non-destructive imaging of routinely prepared FFPE samples by laboratory µCT can be used to visualize and assess the 3D morphology of the lung including by morphometric analysis."
https://openalex.org/W802573479,"Nutritional and medicinal benefits have been attributed to the consumption of tissues from the black-boned chickens in oriental countries. Lueyang black-boned chicken is one of the native chicken breeds. However, some birds may instead have white or lighter skin, which directly causes economic losses every year. Previous studies of pigmentation have focused on a number of genes that may play important roles in coat color regulation. Illumina2000 sequencing technology was used to catalog the global gene expression profiles in the skin of the Lueyang chicken with white versus black skin. A total of 18,608 unigenes were assembled from the reads obtained from the skin of the white and black chickens. A total of 649 known genes were differentially expressed in the black versus white chickens, with 314 genes that were up regulated and 335 genes that were down-regulated, and a total of 162 novel genes were differentially expressed in the black versus white chickens, consisting of 73 genes that were up-regulated (including 4 highly expressed genes that were expressed exclusively in the skin of the black chickens) and 89 genes that were down-regulated. There were also a total of 8 known coat-color genes expressed in previous studies (ASIP, TYR, KIT, TYRP1, OCA2, KITLG, MITF and MC1R). In this study, 4 of which showed greater expression in the black chickens, and several were up-regulated, such as KIT, ASIP, TYR and OCA2. To our surprise, KITLG, MITF and MC1R showed no significant difference in expression between the black- and white-skinned chickens, and the expression of TYRP1 was not detected in either skin color. The expression of ASIP, TYR, KIT, TYRP1, OCA2, KITLG, MITF and MC1R was validated by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR), and the results of the qPCR were consistent with the RNA-seq. This study provides several candidate genes that may be associated with the development of black versus white skin. More importantly, the fact that the MC1R gene showed no significant difference in expression between the black and white chickens is of particular interest for future studies that aim to elucidate its functional role in the regulation of skin color."
https://openalex.org/W1586123488,"Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 Vpr is an accessory protein that induces G2/M cell cycle arrest. It is well documented that interaction of Vpr with the Cul4-DDB1[VprBP] E3 ubiquitin ligase is essential for the induction of G2/M arrest. In this study, we show that HIV-1 Vpr indirectly binds MCM10, a eukaryotic DNA replication factor, in a Vpr-binding protein (VprBP) (VprBP)-dependent manner. Binding of Vpr to MCM10 enhanced ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of MCM10. G2/M-defective mutants of Vpr were not able to deplete MCM10, and we show that Vpr-induced depletion of MCM10 is related to the ability of Vpr to induce G2/M arrest. Our study demonstrates that MCM10 is the natural substrate of the Cul4-DDB1[VprBP] E3 ubiquitin ligase whose degradation is regulated by VprBP, but Vpr enhances the proteasomal degradation of MCM10 by interacting with VprBP."
https://openalex.org/W624208882,"Background The conversion of astrocytes to neuroblasts holds great promise for treatment of neurodegenerative and traumatic brain diseases. Methodology and Principal Findings Here we have shown that adult human astrocytes could be reprogrammed to neuroblasts by miR-302/367, both in vivo and in vitro. However, the reprogramming of adult mouse astrocytes to neuroblasts required valproic acid (VPA), a histone deacetylase inhibitor. Following induction of astrocytes toward neurons the expression of pluripotency markers were not detected, which suggested direct cell conversion. We did not observed tumor formation during two months follow up. Conclusions and Significance These results show that neuroblasts can be generated directly from adult human and mouse astrocytes by miR-302/367-driven induction. This approach seems promising for converting glial scar cells into neuroblasts in a wide range of neurological diseases."
https://openalex.org/W1754416593,"G protein-coupled receptor kinases (GRKs) regulate cell signaling by initiating the desensitization of active G protein-coupled receptors. The two most widely expressed GRKs (GRK2 and GRK5) play a role in cardiovascular disease and thus represent important targets for the development of novel therapeutic drugs. In the course of a GRK2 structure-based drug design campaign, one inhibitor (CCG215022) exhibited nanomolar IC50 values against both GRK2 and GRK5 and good selectivity against other closely related kinases such as GRK1 and PKA. Treatment of murine cardiomyocytes with CCG215022 resulted in significantly increased contractility at 20-fold lower concentrations than paroxetine, an inhibitor with more modest selectivity for GRK2. A 2.4 Å crystal structure of the GRK5·CCG215022 complex was determined and revealed that the inhibitor binds in the active site similarly to its parent compound GSK180736A. As designed, its 2-pyridylmethyl amide side chain occupies the hydrophobic subsite of the active site where it forms three additional hydrogen bonds, including one with the catalytic lysine. The overall conformation of the GRK5 kinase domain is similar to that of a previously determined structure of GRK6 in what is proposed to be its active state, but the C-terminal region of the enzyme adopts a distinct conformation. The kinetic properties of site-directed mutants in this region are consistent with the hypothesis that this novel C-terminal structure is representative of the membrane-bound conformation of the enzyme.

https://openalex.org/W587138941,"Objectives Positive affect (PA) plays a crucial role in the development, course, and recovery of depression. Recently, we showed that a therapeutic application of the experience sampling method (ESM), consisting of feedback focusing on PA in daily life, was associated with a decrease in depressive symptoms. The present study investigated whether the experience of PA increased during the course of this intervention. Design Multicentre parallel randomized controlled trial. An electronic random sequence generator was used to allocate treatments. Settings University, two local mental health care institutions, one local hospital. Participants 102 pharmacologically treated outpatients with a DSM-IV diagnosis of major depressive disorder, randomized over three treatment arms. Intervention Six weeks of ESM self-monitoring combined with weekly PA-focused feedback sessions (experimental group); six weeks of ESM self-monitoring combined with six weekly sessions without feedback (pseudo-experimental group); or treatment as usual (control group). Main outcome The interaction between treatment allocation and time in predicting positive and negative affect (NA) was investigated in multilevel regression models. Results 102 patients were randomized (mean age 48.0, SD 10.2) of which 81 finished the entire study protocol. All 102 patients were included in the analyses. The experimental group did not show a significant larger increase in momentary PA during or shortly after the intervention compared to the pseudo-experimental or control groups (χ2 (2) =0.33, p=.846). The pseudo-experimental group showed a larger decrease in NA compared to the control group (χ2 (1) =6.29, p=.012). Conclusion PA-focused feedback did not significantly impact daily life PA during or shortly after the intervention. As the previously reported reduction in depressive symptoms associated with the feedback unveiled itself only after weeks, it is conceivable that the effects on daily life PA also evolve slowly and therefore were not captured by the experience sampling procedure immediately after treatment.

https://openalex.org/W1585727595,"The majority of cholesterol-dependent cytolysins (CDCs) utilize cholesterol as a membrane receptor, whereas a small number are restricted to the GPI-anchored protein CD59 for initial membrane recognition. Two cholesterol-binding CDCs, perfringolysin O (PFO) and streptolysin O (SLO), were found to exhibit strikingly different binding properties to cholesterol-rich natural and synthetic membranes. The structural basis for this difference was mapped to one of the loops (L3) in the membrane binding interface that help anchor the toxin monomers to the membrane after receptor (cholesterol) binding by the membrane insertion of its amino acid side chains. A single point mutation in this loop conferred the binding properties of SLO to PFO and vice versa. Our studies strongly suggest that changing the side chain structure of this loop alters its equilibrium between membrane-inserted and uninserted states, thereby affecting the overall binding affinity and total bound toxin. Previous studies have shown that the lipid environment of cholesterol has a dramatic effect on binding and activity. Combining this data with the results of our current studies on L3 suggests that the structure of this loop has evolved in the different CDCs to preferentially direct binding to cholesterol in different lipid environments. Finally, the efficiency of β-barrel pore formation was inversely correlated with the increased binding and affinity of the PFO L3 mutant, suggesting that selection of a compatible lipid environment impacts the efficiency of membrane insertion of the β-barrel pore."
https://openalex.org/W1533955529,"Approximately 500,000 people are hospitalized with severe dengue illness annually. Antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) of dengue virus (DENV) infection is believed to contribute to the pathogenic cytokine storm described in severe dengue patients, but the precise signaling pathways contributing to elevated cytokine production are not elucidated. IL-1β is a potent inflammatory cytokine that is frequently elevated during severe dengue, and the unique dual regulation of IL-1β provides an informative model to study ADE-induced cytokines. This work utilizes patient-derived anti-DENV mAbs and primary human monocytes to study ADE-induced IL-1β and other cytokines. ADE of DENV serotype 2 (DENV-2) elevates mature IL-1β secretion by monocytes independent of DENV replication by 4 h postinoculation (hpi). Prior to this, DENV immune complexes activate spleen tyrosine kinase (Syk) within 1 hpi. Syk induces elevated IL1B, TNF, and IL6 mRNA by 2 hpi. Syk mediates elevated IL-1β secretion by activating ERK1/2, and both Syk and ERK1/2 inhibitors ablated ADE-induced IL-1β secretion. Maturation of pro-IL-1β during ADE requires caspase-1 and NLRP3, but caspase-1 is suboptimally increased by ADE and can be significantly enhanced by a typical inflammasome agonist, ATP. Importantly, this inflammatory Syk-ERK signaling axis requires DENV immune complexes, because DENV-2 in the presence of serotype-matched anti-DENV-2 mAb, but not anti-DENV-1 mAb, activates Syk, ERK, and IL-1β secretion. This study provides evidence that DENV-2 immune complexes activate Syk to mediate elevated expression of inflammatory cytokines. Syk and ERK may serve as new therapeutic targets for interfering with ADE-induced cytokine expression during severe dengue."
https://openalex.org/W1552762641,"Estimating the energy expenditure of farm animals at pasture is important for efficient animal management. In recent years, an alternative technique for estimating energy expenditure by measuring body acceleration has been widely performed in wildlife and human studies, but the availability of the technique in farm animals has not yet been examined. In the present study, we tested the potential use of an acceleration index, overall dynamic body acceleration (ODBA), as a new proxy for estimating the energy expenditure of grazing farm animals (cattle, goats and sheep) at pasture with the simultaneous evaluation of a conventional proxy, heart rate. Body accelerations in three axes and heart rate for cows (n = 8, two breeds), goats (n = 6) and sheep (n = 5) were recorded, and the effect of ODBA calculated from the body accelerations on heart rate was analyzed. In addition, the effects of the two other activity indices, the number of steps and vectorial dynamic body acceleration (VeDBA), on heart rate were also investigated. The results of the comparison among three activity indices indicated that ODBA was the best predictor for heart rate. Although the relationship between ODBA and heart rate was different between the groups of species and breeds and between individuals (P<0.01), the difference could be explained by different body weights; a common equation could be established by correcting the body weights (M: kg): heart rate (beats/min) = 147.263∙M-0.141 + 889.640∙M-0.179∙ODBA (g). Combining this equation with the previously reported energy expenditure per heartbeat, we estimated the energy expenditure of the tested animals, and the results indicated that ODBA is a good proxy for estimating the energy expenditure of grazing farm animals across species and breeds. The utility and simplicity of the procedure with acceleration loggers could make the accelerometry technique a worthwhile option in field research and commercial farm use."

Aberrant signaling can have devastating consequences and lead to disease states, including cancer. The transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) signaling pathway is a prominent signaling pathway that has been tightly regulated in normal cells, whereas its deregulation strongly correlates with the progression of human cancers. The regulation of the TGF-β signaling pathway involves a variety of physiological regulators. Many of these molecules act to alter the activity of Smad proteins. In contrast, the number of molecules known to affect the TGF-β signaling pathway at the receptor level is relatively low, and there are no known direct modulators for the TGF-β type II receptor (TβRII). Here we identify SPSB1 (a Spry domain-containing Socs box protein) as a novel regulator of the TGF-β signaling pathway. SPSB1 negatively regulates the TGF-β signaling pathway through its interaction with both endogenous and overexpressed TβRII (and not TβRI) via its Spry domain. As such, TβRII and SPSB1 co-localize on the cell membrane. SPSB1 maintains TβRII at a low level by enhancing the ubiquitination levels and degradation rates of TβRII through its Socs box.

GRKs also phosphorylate many other proteins and can mediate kinase-independent regulation of receptor and effector function (2Gurevich E.V. Tesmer J.J. Mushegian A. Gurevich V.V.

Although most GRKs are localized in the cytoplasm or at the plasma membrane, GRK5 and GRK6 are also found in the nucleus with GRK5 localization being regulated by Gq signaling (4Martini J.S. Raake P.

This has been best studied in cardiovascular disease where increased GRK expression is associated with congestive heart failure, hypertension, and myocardial ischemia. GRK2 appears to play a particularly important role in this process and is overexpressed in human heart failure and hypertension as well as in experimentally induced heart failure models (7Ungerer M.

Moreover, a Q41L polymorphism within the regulator of G protein signaling homology (RH) domain in GRK5 is prevalent in African Americans and has an enhanced ability to desensitize the β2-adrenergic receptor (β2AR) (12Wang W.C.

Taken together, these studies reveal that GRK5 is implicated in many different human diseases and may provide an important therapeutic target in the treatment of cardiovascular disease, neurological and metabolic disorders, and cancer. Although it is important to understand the in vivo function of GRKs, it is also important to understand the mechanisms that mediate GRK function. Significant insight into GRK function has come from detailed biochemical and biophysical analysis. This has included defining important functional domains, including detailed mapping of interfaces such as GRK2 interaction with Gαq (21Sterne-Marr R. Tesmer J.J. Day P.W. Stracquatanio R.P.

These structures reveal that the RH, catalytic, and C-terminal domains are in extensive contact and help to hold the kinase domain in an inactive open conformation. Several studies suggest that an N-terminal α-helical domain plays an important role in regulating catalytic domain closure via a process that is likely regulated by receptor binding (29Pao C.S.

Molecular basis for activation of G protein-coupled receptor kinases.EMBO J. 2010; 29: 3249-3259Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) and appears to stabilize catalytic domain closure. Although crystallography has provided significant insight on GRK1, -2, and -6, there have been no studies to date on the structural analysis of GRK5. Here, we use x-ray crystallography to better understand the structure and function of GRK5. We find that human GRK5 shares significant structural similarity to other GRKs, albeit with some unique aspects. In contrast to crystal structures of GRK1 and GRK6, GRK5 is a monomer in the crystal and contains a well ordered kinase domain C-tail that includes interactions between the active-site tether and bound nucleotide. Such studies have high significance for understanding GRKs and how structure/function changes might mediate pathological consequences. Moreover, these studies should set the stage for developing strategies to specifically regulate GRK5 function in the treatment of disease. Sangivamycin, ADP, AMP-PNP, and phosphatidylcholine (soybean type II-S) were purchased from Sigma, and [γ-32P]ATP was from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Crystallization screening reagents were purchased from Hampton Research (Aliso Viejo, CA). The site-specific mutants GRK5-K215R and GRK5-R470A were generated using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Agilent) and verified by DNA sequencing. The Bac-to-Bac Baculovirus Expression System (Invitrogen) was used to generate baculoviruses to express human full-length wild-type GRK5, GRK5-R470A, and kinase-dead GRK5-K215R in Sf9 insect cells. The recombinant proteins were purified as described previously with some modifications (32Pronin A.N. Loudon R.P. Benovic J.L. Characterization of G protein-coupled receptor kinases.Methods Enzymol. 2002; 343: 547-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were harvested by low speed centrifugation 48 h after infection, and the cell pellet was resuspended in lysis buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.2, 250 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μm leupeptin, 3 mm benzamidine, and 0.02% Triton X-100). Cells were lysed using a Brinkman Polytron (two times for 30 s at 25,000 rpm) followed by high speed centrifugation to remove cell debris. The supernatant was diluted 4-fold with buffer A (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.2, 2 mm EDTA, 0.02% Triton X-100, 1 mm dithiothreitol (DTT)) and applied to an SP-Sepharose cation-exchange column. The column was washed and eluted with a 50–750 mm linear NaCl gradient in buffer A. GRK5 peak fractions were pooled, diluted with buffer A, loaded onto a heparin-Sepharose 6 FF affinity column, and eluted with a 200–800 mm linear NaCl gradient in buffer A. GRK5-containing fractions were pooled, diluted with buffer B (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.2, 1 mm DTT), and injected onto a 1-ml Mono S cation-exchange FPLC column. Proteins were eluted with a 200–700 mm NaCl linear gradient in buffer B, and fractions containing GRK5 were combined, diluted to 200 mm NaCl with buffer B, concentrated in a 50-kDa molecular mass cutoff filter (Millipore Corp.) to ∼20 mg/ml, aliquoted, and stored at −80 °C. The yield of pure GRK5 was 2–5 mg/liter of Sf9 cells with protein purity >95% as analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Prior to crystallization, 8 mg/ml GRK5 (∼120 μm) was incubated for 2 h with 4 mm AMP-PNP and 2 mm MgCl2 (GRK5·AMP-PNP complex) or 0.4 mm sangivamycin and 0.2 mm MgCl2 (GRK5·sangivamycin complex). Initial robotic screening for crystallization conditions was performed in a 96-well format using crystallization kits from Hampton Research. Protein droplets were prepared by mixing 0.4 μl of protein sample with 0.4 μl of reservoir solution and equilibrating against 60 μl of reservoir solution as a sitting drop at 4 °C. Several conditions under which crystals appeared were further optimized using the hanging-drop vapor-diffusion method and increasing the droplet size and reservoir volume by 5–8-fold, varying the concentration of precipitants and salts at different pH values. The complexes crystallized under similar conditions (AMP-PNP: 0.2 m NaCl, 0.1 m BisTris, pH 6.5, 20% w/v PEG 3350; sangivamycin: 0.15 m NaCl, 0.1 m BisTris, pH 5.5, 21% w/v PEG 3350). The best single diffracting crystals were obtained by micro-seeding. GRK5 crystals appeared within 3 days and grew over the course of 2–3 weeks with tetragonal bipyramidal morphology. SDS-PAGE analysis of a dissolved crystal revealed full-length GRK5. Crystals were cryoprotected using the reservoir solution supplemented to 35% PEG 3350 and flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen. Diffraction data for crystals were collected at beamline X6A at the Brookhaven National Synchrotron Light Source (NSLS) on an Area Detector System Corp. Quantum-270 detector using an x-ray wavelength of ∼1.0 Å and 0.2° oscillations under a constant stream of liquid nitrogen maintained at 100 K. The best crystals for GRK5·AMP-PNP and GRK5·sangivamycin complexes diffracted to 1.8 and 2.1 Å, respectively. Diffraction data for both datasets were processed and scaled to primitive tetragonal space group P43212 using HKL2000 suite (Table 1) (33Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Processing of x-ray diffraction data collected in oscillation mode.Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38555) Google Scholar). The ligand-bound structures of GRK5 were solved by molecular replacement with Phaser (34McCoy A.J. Solving structures of protein complexes by molecular replacement with Phaser.Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2007; 63: 32-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (1245) Google Scholar) using two fragments of the GRK6 crystal structure (PDB code 2ACX) as the search model, corresponding to residues 30–179 and 180–507 (kinase domain). One copy of the GRK5 molecule was located in the asymmetric unit, which results in an estimated solvent content of ∼43%. The model was subjected to iterative cycles of positional refinement and isotropic B-factor refinement using five TLS groups in Phenix.refine (35Afonine P.V. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Echols N.

Coot: model-building tools for molecular graphics.Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 2126-2132Crossref PubMed Scopus (23311) Google Scholar). To ascertain N-terminal residues 15–23 and a few loop regions of the model, omit-maps and feature-enhanced maps were calculated using PHENIX. Mg2+ ion, AMP-PNP, and sangivamycin were refined into their corresponding electron density as identified by difference maps. The final refined models for GRK5·AMP-PNP and GRK5·sangivamycin have Rwork/Rfree of 17.2/20.4 and 16.8/23.1%, respectively (Table 1). The Rfree set was calculated using randomly selected reflections over 14 thin resolution shells. MolProbity (37Chen V.B. Arendall 3rd, W.B. Headd J.J. Keedy D.A. Immormino R.M. Kapral G.J.

The validity of refined structure models to the unmerged diffraction data was assessed using the correlation coefficient of half-datasets, CC*, using PHENIX. Also, CC*, CCwork, and CCfree were calculated for the final deposited structures in PHENIX and suggest that the structures were not over-fitted (Table 1) (38Karplus P.A. Diederichs K.

https://openalex.org/W569679461,"Existing research on the role of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) in bivalve reproduction is inadequate, even though a few bivalve GnRH orthologs have been cloned. The objective of this paper was to elucidate the in vivo effect of GnRH administration in Yesso scallop reproduction. We performed in vivo administration of scallop GnRH (py-GnRH) synthetic peptide into the developing gonad, and analyzed its effect on gonad development for 6 weeks during the reproductive season. The resulting sex ratio in the GnRH administered (GnRH(+)) group might be male biased, whereas the control (GnRH(-)) group had an equal sex ratio throughout the experiment. The gonad index (GI) of males in the GnRH(+) group increased from week 2 to 24.8% at week 6. By contrast the GI of the GnRH(-) group peaked in week 4 at 16.6%. No significant difference was seen in female GI between the GnRH(+) and GnRH(-) groups at any sampling point. Oocyte diameter in the GnRH(+) group remained constant (about 42-45 μm) throughout the experiment, while in the GnRH(-) group it increased from 45 to 68 μm i.e. normal oocyte growth. The number of spermatogonia in the germinal acini of males in the GnRH(+) group increased from week 4 to 6. Hermaphrodites appeared in the GnRH(+) group in weeks 2 and 4. Their gonads contained many apoptotic cells including oocytes. In conclusion, this study suggests that py-GnRH administration could have a potential to accelerate spermatogenesis and cause an inhibitory effect on oocyte growth in scallops."
https://openalex.org/W571791063,"Melanogenesis is the physiological process by which melanin is synthesized to protect the skin from UV damage. While paracrine interactions between keratinocytes and melanocytes are crucial for regulating epidermal pigmentation, the endothelin (EDN)-endothelin B-receptor (EDNRB) interaction is one of the key linkages. In this study, we found that a single exposure of normal human melanocytes (NHMs) with UVB stimulates the expression of EDNRB and its upstream transcription factor microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (MITF) at the transcriptional and translational levels. That stimulation can be abrogated by post-irradiation treatment with a French maritime pine bark extract (PBE). UVB stimulated the phosphorylation of p38 and c-jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), but not ERK, followed by the increased phosphorylation of MSK1 and CREB. The post-irradiation treatment with PBE did not affect the increased phosphorylation of p38 and JNK, but distinctly abrogated the phosphorylation of MSK1 and CREB. Post-irradiation treatment with the MSK1 inhibitor H89 significantly down-regulated the increased gene expression of MITF and EDNRB in UVB-exposed NHMs. Our findings indicate for the first time that the increased expression of MITF that leads to the up-regulation of melanocyte-specific proteins in UVB-exposed NHMs is mediated via activation of the p38/MSK1/CREB pathway but not the ERK/RSK/CREB pathway. The mode of action by PBE demonstrates that interrupting MSK1 activation is a new target for antioxidants including PBE which can serve as anti-pigmenting agents in a reactive oxygen species-depletion-independent manner."
https://openalex.org/W1565356234,"Kallikrein-related peptidases (KLKs) are a group of serine proteases widely expressed in various tissues and involved in a wide range of physiological and pathological processes. Although our understanding of the pathophysiological roles of most KLKs has blossomed in recent years, identification of the direct endogenous substrates of human KLKs remains an unmet objective. In this study we employed a degradomics approach to systemically investigate the endogenous substrates of KLK7 in an effort to understand the molecular pathways underlying KLK7 action in skin. We identified several previously known as well as novel protein substrates. Our most promising candidates were further validated with the use of targeted quantitative proteomics (selected reaction monitoring methods) and in vitro recombinant protein digestion assays. Our study revealed midkine, CYR61, and tenascin-C as endogenous substrates for KLK7. Interestingly, some of these substrates (e.g. midkine) were prone to proteolytic cleavage only by KLK7 (and not by other skin-associated KLKs), whereas others (e.g. CYR61 and tenascin-C) could be digested by several KLKs. Furthermore, using melanoma cell line, we show that KLK7-mediated cleavage of midkine results in an overall reduction in the pro-proliferative and pro-migratory effect of midkine. An inverse relation between KLK7 and midkine is also observed in human melanoma tissues. In summary, our degradomics approach revealed three novel endogenous substrates for KLK7, which may shed more light on the pathobiological roles of KLK7 in human skin. Similar substrate screening approaches could be applied for the discovery of biological substrates of other protease."
https://openalex.org/W2259922552,"Historical ecologists have demonstrated legacy effects in apparently wild landscapes in Europe, North America, Mesoamerica, Amazonia, Africa and Oceania. People live and farm in archaeological sites today in many parts of the world, but nobody has looked for the legacies of past human occupations in the most dynamic areas in these sites: homegardens. Here we show that the useful flora of modern homegardens is partially a legacy of pre-Columbian occupations in Central Amazonia: the more complex the archaeological context, the more variable the floristic composition of useful native plants in homegardens cultivated there today. Species diversity was 10% higher in homegardens situated in multi-occupational archaeological contexts compared with homegardens situated in single-occupational ones. Species heterogeneity (β-diversity) among archaeological contexts was similar for the whole set of species, but markedly different when only native Amazonian species were included, suggesting the influence of pre-conquest indigenous occupations on current homegarden species composition. Our findings show that the legacy of pre-Columbian occupations is visible in the most dynamic of all agroecosystems, adding another dimension to the human footprint in the Amazonian landscape."
https://openalex.org/W1526723187,"Rab GTPases recruit effector proteins, via their GTP-dependent switch regions, to distinct subcellular compartments. Rab11 and Rab25 are closely related small GTPases that bind to common effectors termed the Rab11 family of interacting proteins (FIPs). The FIPs are organized into two subclasses (class I and class II) based on sequence and domain organization, and both subclasses contain a highly conserved Rab-binding domain at their C termini. Yeast two-hybrid and biochemical studies have revealed that the more distantly related Rab14 also interacts with class I FIPs. Here, we perform detailed structural, thermodynamic, and cellular analyses of the interactions between Rab14 and one of the class I FIPs, the Rab-coupling protein (RCP), to clarify the molecular aspects of the interaction. We find that Rab14 indeed binds to RCP, albeit with reduced affinity relative to conventional Rab11-FIP and Rab25-FIP complexes. However, in vivo, Rab11 recruits RCP onto biological membranes. Furthermore, biophysical analyses reveal a noncanonical 1:2 stoichiometry between Rab14-RCP in dilute solutions, in contrast to Rab11/25 complexes.

Finally, we show that both the Rab coupling protein and Rab14 function in neuritogenesis. Rab GTPases are molecular switches that belong to the Ras superfamily of small GTPases and regulate vesicle trafficking in eukaryotic cells (1Zerial M. McBride H. Rab proteins as membrane organizers.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 107-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (2707) Google Scholar). In their active GTP-bound state, membrane-localized Rabs exert their biological effects by recruiting cytosolic effector proteins to distinct subcellular compartments. Membrane attachment of active Rabs is facilitated by prenylation of one or two C-terminally situated cysteine residues by the enzyme geranylgeranyltransferase (2Andres D.A. Seabra M.C. Brown M.S. Armstrong S.A. Smeland T.E. Cremers F.P. Goldstein J.L. cDNA cloning of component A of Rab geranylgeranyl transferase and demonstration of its role as a Rab escort protein.Cell. 1993; 73: 1091-1099Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar), thus adding a hydrophobic tail to the G-protein. This tail inserts into the lipid bilayer, and the globular domain projects into the cytosol. Upon hydrolysis of GTP, which is stimulated by GTPase-activating proteins (3Bernards A. GAPs galore! A survey of putative Ras superfamily GTPase activating proteins in man and Drosophila.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2003; 1603: 47-82PubMed Google Scholar), intact Rabs, together with their hydrophobic tails, are extracted from membranes by the GTP/GDP dissociation inhibitor into the cytosolic fraction (4Goody R.S. Rak A. Alexandrov K. The structural and mechanistic basis for recycling of Rab proteins between membrane compartments.Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2005; 62: 1657-1670Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). The switch is turned “on” by GTP/GDP exchange factors that catalyze the exchange of GDP for GTP. The functional cycle is completed by re-insertion of Rab tails into membranes. Mammalian Rabs compose the largest family of Ras-like GTPases, with over 60 members in humans. Rabs regulate intracellular trafficking in their active GTP-bound state by recruiting one or more members of a diverse set of effector proteins. Rab structures consist of a six-stranded mixed β-sheet flanked by five α-helices. The 5′-phosphate arm of the nucleotide is bordered on one side by the P-loop (Walker A motif), which is conserved throughout the Ras superfamily, as well as in many ATPases (5Saraste M. Sibbald P.R. Wittinghofer A. The P-loop–a common motif in ATP- and GTP-binding proteins.Trends Biochem. Sci. 1990; 15: 430-434Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1748) Google Scholar, 6Walker J.E. Saraste M. Runswick M.J. Gay N.J.

The conformations of a pair of adjacent regions termed switch I and switch II are sensitive to the presence of GTP versus GDP (7Vetter I.R. Wittinghofer A. The guanine nucleotide-binding switch in three dimensions.Science. 2001; 294: 1299-1304Crossref PubMed Scopus (1380) Google Scholar), and thus convey the nucleotide specificity for effector recruitment. Additionally, a loop and strand situated between the switch motifs, termed the interswitch, also plays a role in effector recruitment. In particular, an invariant tryptophan residue that is located within an otherwise variable interswitch sequence provides a hydrophobic surface for effector binding. The overall sequence identities between mammalian Rabs range from 30 to 80% (8Pereira-Leal J.B. Seabra M.C. The mammalian Rab family of small GTPases: definition of family and subfamily sequence motifs suggests a mechanism for functional specificity in the Ras superfamily.J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 301: 1077-1087Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar), with the nucleotide-proximal motifs (switch I/II, P-loop) bearing the most highly conserved (60–80%) segments. The complexity of Rab-regulated intracellular trafficking is increased by the promiscuity of Rab/effector interactions in eukaryotic cells. Typically, a single Rab binds to multiple, often unrelated, effectors, and a single effector protein can sometimes be recognized by multiple Rab proteins. For example, Rab6 regulates Golgi traffic and interacts with effectors such as the golgin GCC185 and Rab6-interacting protein 1 (R6IP1), which are unrelated proteins (9Burguete A.S. Fenn T.D. Brunger A.T. Pfeffer S.R.

Waharte F. Boulet A. Cuif M.H. Tenza D. El Marjou A. Raposo G. Salamero J. Héliot L. Goud B. Monier S. Rab6-interacting protein 1 links Rab6 and Rab11 function.Traffic. 2007; 8: 1385-1403Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The structures of complexes of Rab6-GCC185 and Rab6-R6IP1 have revealed that GCC185 is a dimeric coiled coil that binds two Rabs, whereas R6IP1 is a monomeric bundle of seven α-helices with a single interface for Rab6. However, the Rab6 epitope is formed along two parallel α-helices in both complexes, which have similar hydrophobic and hydrophilic features at their respective interfaces. Conversely, a single effector protein can sometimes be recognized by multiple Rabs. An example of effector promiscuity is Rabenosyn-5, which is recruited by Rab4 and Rab22 via distinct segments of coiled-coil motifs (11Eathiraj S. Pan X. Ritacco C. Lambright D.G. Structural basis of family-wide Rab GTPase recognition by rabenosyn-5.Nature. 2005; 436: 415-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). In all known complexes, binding is at least partly facilitated by switch I and switch II. Comparative analyses of the known structures of Rab-effector complexes have revealed that specificity is a complex phenotype that is influenced by subtle differences in sequence and conformational diversity in switch I, switch II, and the interswitch region. In vitro thermodynamic and kinetic studies of Rab-effector complexes reveal a variety of affinities in vitro ranging from relatively high (Rab27-Slp2a, dissociation constant Kd = 13 nm (12Fukuda M. Distinct Rab27A binding affinities of Slp2-a and Slac2-a/melanophilin: hierarchy of Rab27A effectors.Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2006; 343: 666-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar)) to low/weak (Rab8-OCRL, Kd = 5 μm (13Hagemann N. Hou X. Goody R.S. Itzen A. Erdmann K.S. Crystal structure of the Rab binding domain of OCRL1 in complex with Rab8 and functional implications of the OCRL1/Rab8 module for Lowe syndrome.Small GTPases. 2012; 3: 107-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar)). Despite numerous structural and thermodynamic studies, it is generally difficult to discern why some complexes have higher affinity than others, or whether the differences in affinity are meaningful. A closely related issue is the question of the molecular determinants of Rab-effector specificity. Relating the structural, thermodynamic, and biological properties of Rab-effector complexes is essential for a comprehensive understanding of how Rabs cooperate to regulate vesicle trafficking. The Rab11 subfamily comprises Rab11A, Rab11B, and Rab25 (also known as Rab11C). Rab11A and Rab11B are ubiquitously expressed, whereas Rab25 expression is restricted to epithelial tissues (14Goldenring J.R. Shen K.R. Vaughan H.D. Modlin I.M. Identification of a small GTP-binding protein, Rab25, expressed in the gastrointestinal mucosa, kidney, and lung.J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 18419-18422Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Rab25 activity has been linked to a variety of cancers (15Chia W.J. Tang B.L. Emerging roles for Rab family GTPases in human cancer.Biochim. Biophys.

Rab14 is more distantly related to the Rab11 subfamily, although it also appears to regulate overlapping endocytic pathways via interactions with class I FIPs 4The abbreviations used are: FIPfamily of interacting proteinsRBDRab-binding domainRCPRab coupling proteinMBPmaltose-binding proteinrTEVrecombinant tobacco etch virusPDBProtein Data BankGpp(NH)pguanosine 5′-(β,γ-imido)triphosphateGTPγSguanosine 5′-3-O-(thio)triphosphate.

Rab14 also binds to RUFY1/Rabip4, which is a dual Rab4/Rab14 effector that regulates endosomal trafficking (20Yamamoto H. Koga H. Katoh Y. Takahashi S. Nakayama K. Shin H.W.

Proteomics. 2008; 7: 1031-1042Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). We subsequently analyzed the ability of all five FIPs to interact with Rab14 and reported that the class I FIPs (RCP, FIP2, and Rip11), but not the class II FIPs (FIP3 and FIP4), interact with Rab14. We identified the region of RCP, FIP2, and Rip11 that binds to Rab14 as their C terminus, and in the case of RCP we mapped it between residues 579 and 645 (17Kelly E.E. Horgan C.P. Adams C. Patzer T.M. Ní Shúilleabháin D.M. Norman J.C. McCaffrey M.W. Class I Rab11-family interacting proteins are binding targets for the Rab14 GTPase.Biol. Cell. 2010; 102: 51-62Crossref Scopus (62) Google Scholar). This region contains the classical Rab11-binding domain (RBD), an ∼20 amino acid highly conserved motif located at the C terminus of all the Rab11-FIPs. A single amino acid mutation (I621E) in the RBD abolished the ability of RCP to interact with both Rab14 and Rab11. In contrast to our findings, Jing et al. (22Jing J. Junutula J.R. Wu C. Burden J. Matern H. Peden A.A. Prekeris R. FIP1/RCP binding to Golgin-97 regulates retrograde transport from recycling endosomes to the trans-Golgi network.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2010; 21: 3041-3053Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) subsequently reported that Rab14 does not bind to any of the FIPs. However, more recently, a study by Goldenring, Spearman, and co-workers (23Qi M. Williams J.A. Chu H. Chen X. Wang J.J. Ding L. Akhirome E. Wen X. Lapierre L.A. Goldenring J.R. Spearman P. Rab11-FIP1C and Rab14 direct plasma membrane sorting and particle incorporation of the HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein complex.PLoS Pathog. 2013; 9e1003278Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) reported that Rab14 does indeed bind to RCP, but via a region upstream of the RBD. Furthermore, in this paper Qi et al. (23Qi M. Williams J.A. Chu H. Chen X. Wang J.J. Ding L. Akhirome E. Wen X. Lapierre L.A. Goldenring J.R. Spearman P. Rab11-FIP1C and Rab14 direct plasma membrane sorting and particle incorporation of the HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein complex.PLoS Pathog. 2013; 9e1003278Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) did not observe any interaction between Rab14 and the other class I FIPs. They identified two serines (Ser-580 and Ser-582), which are not present in FIP2 and Rip11, that when mutated to asparagine and leucine, respectively, abolished the interaction with Rab14 without affecting the interaction with Rab11. To resolve these conflicting reports, we have followed two approaches. First, we have recently reported a detailed comparison of the antibodies used by Qi et al. (23Qi M. Williams J.A. Chu H. Chen X. Wang J.J. Ding L. Akhirome E. Wen X. Lapierre L.A. Goldenring J.R. Spearman P. Rab11-FIP1C and Rab14 direct plasma membrane sorting and particle incorporation of the HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein complex.PLoS Pathog. 2013; 9e1003278Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) and ourselves (24Lindsay A.J. McCaffrey M.W. Rab antibody characterization: comparison of rab14 antibodies.Methods Mol. Biol. 2015; 1298: 161-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). Second, we report here the detailed structural, biophysical, and cellular analyses of Rab14 binding to the class I FIPs. We observe structurally that Rab14 does indeed bind to the conserved RBD of the Rab coupling protein (RCP), albeit as a noncanonical Rab/FIP (1:2) assembly in dilute concentrations. Our crystallographic studies provide insight into the molecular basis for Rab14-RCP binding and clarify several discrepancies involving Rab11/25 and Rab14 interactions with the FIPs. Our cell biology studies suggest that Rab11 is the major Rab that recruits RCP onto biological membranes, whereas Rab14 and RCP function in the process of neurite formation in a neuronal cell line. Rab14 was expressed by subcloning of the globular region (2–175) into pTrcHisA. PCR primers were 5′-AACTCGAGGCAACTGCACCATACAACTAC (forward) and 5′-AAGAATTCGTAGTTCTGATAGATTTTCTTGGCAG (reverse). The template pEGFP-C1/Rab14 harbored the mutation Q70L; the cDNA fragment was cloned into the XhoI/EcoRI sites of pTrcHisA. A further truncation of Rab14(7–175) was generated by inserting the corresponding cDNA into pNIC28-Bsa4 (Kan+, N-terminal His tag) using a ligation-independent cloning protocol. The template for this latter construct was pTrcHisA-Rab14, and this shorter variant was used for crystallization studies. The primers were 5′-TACTTCCAATCCATGaacta-ctcttacatc (forward) and 5′-TATCCACCTTTACTGTTAgttcagatagattttc, which generated the region corresponding to Asn-7–Asn-175 of Rab14. Following rTEV cleavage, the cloning vector introduced non-native Gly-Met residues at the N terminus. Similarly, RCPs (residues 581–649) were inserted into vector pNIC28-Bsa4 using primers 5′-TACTTCCAATCCATGccctcggaccctgca (forward) and 5′-TATCCACCTTTACTGTTAcatctttcctgcttttttg (reverse). pTrcHisC/RCP(385–649) was generated by PCR using the following primers: 5′-CCCGGATCCAAAGGCAGCTCTCCGAATCTTCC-3′ (forward) and 5′-CCCGAATTCTTACATCTTTCCTGCTTTTTTGCC-3′ (reverse) with pEGFP-C3/RCPWT as template. The PCR product was purified and cloned into the BamHI/EcoRI sites of pTrcHisC (Invitrogen). The NF (S580N/S582F), NL (S580N/S582L), and ΔRBD (L591/Stop) mutants were generated by QuikChange (Agilent Technologies) site-directed mutagenesis. The following sense/antisense primers were used: NF, 5′-ATGAGGTCATGATGAAGAAATACAACCCCTTCGACCCTGCATTTGCAT-3′/5′-ATGCAAATGCAGGGTCGAAGGGGTTGTATTTCTTCATCATGACCTCAT-3′; NL, 5′-TGAGGTCATGATGAAGAAATACAACCCCTTGGACCCTGCATT-3′/5′-AATGCAGGGTCCAAGGGGTTGTATTTCTTCATCATGACCTCA-3′; and ΔRBD 5′-CCCTGCATTTGCATATGCGCAGTAGTAGCACGATGAGCTGATTCAGCTGG-3′/5′-CCAGCTGAATCAGCTCATCGTGCTACTACTGCGCATATGCAAATGCAGGG-3′. pTrcHisC/RCP(385–649) and pEGFP-C3 RCPWT were used as templates. A series of constructs comprising the region 559–649 of RCP were generated by PCR amplification using the following oligonucleotides: 5′-TACTTCCAATCCATGAGCTTGGGAACTGCC (forward primer) and 5′-TATCCACCTTTACTGTTACATCTTTCCTGCTTTTTTGC (reverse primer). The underlined codons indicate the start and end of translated products. The template for these reactions were RCP constructs (residues 385–649) in pTrcHis vector that already contained the corresponding background (WT, S580N/S582F, and S580N/S582L). These WT and mutant proteins were highly soluble and also encompassed the region around Ser-580/Ser-582, which has recently been implicated in binding to Rab14. The PCR-amplified cDNA corresponding to region 559–649 of RCP was subcloned into pNIC28-Bsa4. The RCP products contained an N-terminal hexahistidine tag and an rTEV cleavage site. Table 1 is a list of the various constructs and their applications, as well as corresponding acronyms used in this study. The construct MBP-FIP2 is a fusion of maltose-binding protein (MBP) with the indicated C terminus of FIP2(410–512), and it has been described previously (25Jagoe W.N. Jackson S.R. Lindsay A.J.

Expression was carried out in 2× YT broth supplemented with 34 μg/ml kanamycin (FORMEDIUMTM) at 37 °C. At an A600 of 0.7, the culture was induced with 0.5 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (FORMEDIUMTM), after which cells were grown for a further 3 h at 37 °C. Cells were harvested by centrifugation, and the pellets were resuspended in His tag extraction buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, 300 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 20 mm imidazole, and 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, pH 8.0) along with 0.5 mm PMSF protease inhibitor (Sigma). Cells were lysed by sonication, and the cell lysate was centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 25 min at 4 °C to remove cellular debris. The supernatants were filtered and loaded onto a nickel-agarose resin (Qiagen). The resin was washed with a 10-fold excess of extraction buffer prior to elution of the bound proteins using extraction buffer supplemented with 200 mm imidazole. Overnight incubation at 4 °C with rTEV protease was used to remove the N-terminal hexahistidine tag from each protein, and the proteins were run through a second Ni2+-agarose column. The “flow-through” fractions were collected, and the uncut proteins and rTEV (which has an uncleavable His tag) remained bound to the resin. Soluble aggregates were removed by running the eluted protein through a Superdex 200 (16/60) gel filtration column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated in column buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT, pH 7.5). Expression and purification of MBP-FIP2 and Rab25 have been described previously (25Jagoe W.N. Jackson S.R. Lindsay A.J. McCaffrey M.W. Khan A.R.

For crystallization experiments, Rab14(7–175)-wtRCP(581–649) complexes were prepared by first combining the individually purified proteins. The combined samples were dialyzed against low salt buffer (10 mm Tris-Cl, 10 mm NaCl, 1 mm DTT, pH 7.5), followed by ion-exchange affinity chromatography on a Mono QTM 5/50 GL column (GE Healthcare). A salt gradient of 10–500 mm NaCl was used over 20 ml, and fractions containing the complex were further purified on a Superdex 200 (16/60) column. The final peaks were collected and concentrated between 7 and 15 mg/ml for use in crystal trials, using 10-kDa cutoff concentrators (Millipore). Prior to crystallization, Gpp(NH)p (Jena Bioscience) was added to a final concentration of 1 mm, because it appeared to improve the reproducibility of crystals. Measurements of polydispersity were performed using a DynaPro NanoStar dynamic light scattering instrument (Wyatt Corp.). Initial screening of Rab14(7–175)-wtRCP(581–649) with commercial sparse-matrix screens was performed using a MosquitoR robot (TTP Labtech). Subsequent optimization of crystal growth was done manually by the hanging drop method using Linbro plates. The complex was crystallized at a concentration of 8.2 mg/ml in a 1:1 ratio with reservoir containing 14% PEG 8000 and 0.1 m HEPES, pH 6.75. Diffraction images were integrated with HKL2000 (27Otwinoski Z. Minor W. Processing of x-ray diffraction data collected in oscillation mode.Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref Scopus (38565) Google Scholar) and scaled using SCALEPACK. The structure was refined by first performing molecular replacement using the structure of Rab14(GDP) as a search model (PDB code 4drz). Electron density corresponding to RCP was clearly visible and was built manually using COOT (28Emsley P. Cowtan K. Coot: model-building tools for molecular graphics.Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 2126-2132Crossref PubMed Scopus (23344) Google Scholar). Alternating cycles of model building and refinement using Refmac5 (29Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J. Refinement of macromolecular structures by the maximum-likelihood method.Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1997; 53: 240-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (13865) Google Scholar) enabled completion of nearly the entire model of Rab14 (residues 7–175) and RCP (595–640), with R/Rf values of 0.24/0.31. At this stage, the model and data were submitted to the PDB_REDO server to optimize the refinement strategy. Further cycles of model building and refinement were performed using Refmac5 and COOT. Although the backbone density is continuous in the complex, several loops and the N/C termini are poorly ordered. The side chains of the following residues were modeled as alanine: Tyr-8–Tyr-10, Glu-33, Lys-35, Met-37, Lys-140, Leu-166, Glu-167, Lys-171, and Gln-174 in Rab14 and Leu-601, Lys-604, Gln-605, Arg-615, and Thr-640 in RCP. In addition, there is poor stereochemistry at Met-37–Ala-38, adjacent to the disulfide bridge (Cys-20–Cys-40). Phe-36 packs against an intramolecular disulfide bond, which likely affects the backbone conformations in this region. Data collection and refinement statistics are shown in Table 2.

https://openalex.org/W1601056619,"Prostate stem cells (P-SCs) are capable of giving rise to all three lineages of prostate epithelial cells, which include basal, luminal, and neuroendocrine cells. Two types of P-SCs have been identified in both human and mouse adult prostates based on prostasphere or organoid cultures, cell lineage tracing, renal capsule implantation, and expression of luminal- and basal-specific proteins. The sphere-forming P-SCs are from the basal cell compartment that express P63, and are therefore designated as basal P-SCs (P-bSCs). Luminal P-SCs (P-lSCs) express luminal cytokeratins and Nkx3.1. Herein, we report that the type 2 FGF receptor (FGFR2) signaling axis is crucial for preserving stemness and preventing differentiation of P-bSCs. FGFR2 signaling mediated by FGFR substrate 2α (FRS2α) is indispensable for formation and maintenance of prostaspheres derived from P63+ P-bSCs. Ablation of Fgfr2 in P63+ cells in vitro causes the disintegration of prostaspheres. Ablation of Fgfr2 in vivo reduces the number of P63-expressing basal cells and enriches luminal cells. This suggests a basal stem cell-to-luminal cell differentiation. In addition, ablation of Fgfr2 in P63+ cells causes defective postnatal development of the prostate. Therefore, the data indicate that FGFR2 signaling is critical for preserving stemness and preventing differentiation of P-bSCs."

Here, we have identified a highly sophisticated allosteric response that allows complex control of the pathway for aromatic amino acid biosynthesis in the pathogen Mycobacterium tuberculosis. This response is mediated by an enzyme complex formed by two pathway enzymes: chorismate mutase (CM) and 3-deoxy-d-arabino-heptulosonate 7-phosphate synthase (DAH7PS). Whereas both enzymes are active in isolation, the catalytic activity of both enzymes is enhanced, and in particular that of the much smaller CM is greatly enhanced (by 120-fold), by formation of a hetero-octameric complex between CM and DAH7PS. Moreover, on complex formation M. tuberculosis CM, which has no allosteric response on its own, acquires allosteric behavior to facilitate its own regulatory needs by directly appropriating and partly reconfiguring the allosteric machinery that provides a synergistic allosteric response in DAH7PS. Kinetic and analytical ultracentrifugation experiments demonstrate that allosteric binding of phenylalanine specifically promotes hetero-octameric complex dissociation, with concomitant reduction of CM activity. Together, DAH7PS and CM from M. tuberculosis provide exquisite control of aromatic amino acid biosynthesis, not only controlling flux into the start of the pathway, but also directing the pathway intermediate chorismate into either Phe/Tyr or Trp biosynthesis.

Interactions between proteins play a central role in biological processes. Oligomerization to form homomeric and heteromeric assemblies confers protein stability and extends protein functionality, including enhancing enzyme catalytic rates and bestowing allosteric properties to the assemblies (1Nussinov R.

Multifunctional enzymes and complex allosteric machinery have previously been described for the enzymes of the shikimate pathway, which is ultimately responsible for the biosynthesis of the aromatic compounds in plants, microorganisms, and apicomplexans (Fig. 1) (5McConkey G.A. Pinney J.W. Westhead D.R. Plueckhahn K. Fitzpatrick T.B. Macheroux P. Kappes B.

In these studies, we explore the role of hetero-oligomeric complex formation between two key enzymes in the shikimate pathway from Mycobacterium tuberculosis in providing a sophisticated allosteric response. The shikimate pathway, which commits metabolites from central metabolism to the biosynthesis of aromatic compounds, leads initially to the formation of chorismate (Fig. 1). Chorismate is the precursor for a range of aromatic metabolites, including the aromatic amino acids Trp, Phe, and Tyr. The first step of the shikimate pathway is catalyzed by 3-deoxy-d-arabino-heptulosonate 7-phosphate synthase (DAH7PS). 3The abbreviations used are: used: DAH7PS3-deoxy-d-arabino-heptulosonate 7-phosphate synthaseCMchorismate mutaseE4Pd-erythrose 4-phosphateMtuM. tuberculosisPEPphosphoenolpyruvate. Six further enzyme-catalyzed steps lead to chorismate. Chorismate mutase (CM) catalyzes the Claisen rearrangement of chorismate to prephenate, a step located at the branch point of aromatic metabolite biosynthesis that commits chorismate to Phe or Tyr biosynthesis. The enzymes for the production of the aromatic amino acids are absent in mammals yet are required for the viability of a number of organisms including M. tuberculosis, the pathogen responsible for tuberculosis, making these enzymes potential targets for novel anti-mycobacterial drugs (7Parish T. Stoker N.G. The common aromatic amino acid biosynthesis pathway is essential in Mycobacterium tuberculosis.Microbiology. 2002; 148: 3069-3077Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). 3-deoxy-d-arabino-heptulosonate 7-phosphate synthase chorismate mutase d-erythrose 4-phosphate M. tuberculosis phosphoenolpyruvate. Because of its critical location at the start of the pathway, DAH7PS activity is usually tightly controlled by feedback regulation by pathway end products (8Light S.H. Anderson W.F. The diversity of allosteric controls at the gateway to aromatic amino acid biosynthesis.Protein Sci. 2013; 22: 395-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). M. tuberculosis DAH7PS (MtuDAH7PS) is distinct from DAH7PS enzymes from other sources in that it possesses a highly sophisticated allosteric response, demonstrating inhibition by binary and ternary combinations of all three aromatic amino acids (9Blackmore N.J.

Biol. 2005; 354: 927-939Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The homotetrameric protein has three distinct inhibitor binding sites per protein chain, each responsible for binding preferentially one of the aromatic amino acids (Fig. 2). The individual amino acids Phe, Trp, and Tyr alone are not inhibitory, yet combinations that include Trp, especially the ternary combination, significantly inhibit DAH7PS activity. Because no significant conformational change of the protein is observed on inhibitor binding, except in the near vicinity of the Phe binding site, inhibition of MtuDAH7PS is consistent with a change in protein dynamics, causing altered substrate binding (12Jiao W. Hutton R.D. Cross P.J. Jameson G.B. Parker E.J. Dynamic cross-talk among remote binding sites: the molecular basis for unusual synergistic allostery.J. Mol.

One is highly active and secreted into the periplasmic compartment, and its biological role is yet to be determined (14Kim S.K. Reddy S.K. Nelson B.C. Vasquez G.B. Davis A. Howard A.J. Patterson S.

The cytosolic homodimeric CM is a poor catalyst on its own; however, on complexation with the tetrameric MtuDAH7PS, to generate a hetero-octameric complex, the catalytic efficiency of this protein is dramatically enhanced (15Sasso S. Okvist M. Roderer K. Gamper M. Codoni G. Krengel U. Kast P. Structure and function of a complex between chorismate mutase and DAHP synthase: efficiency boost for the junior partner.EMBO J. 2009; 28: 2128-2142Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). In contrast to the large tetrameric MtuDAH7PS (over 200 kDa), the MtuCM homodimer is small, and complex formation is achieved by the MtuCM homodimers capping the MtuDAH7PS tetramer interfaces (Fig. 2). More recently the C-terminal region of the MtuCM has been demonstrated to be important for the interaction with and activation by MtuDAH7PS (16Roderer K. Neuenschwander M. Codoni G. Sasso S. Gamper M. Kast P. Functional mapping of protein-protein interactions in an enzyme complex by directed evolution.PLoS One. 2014; 9e116234Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). The three binding sites on MtuDAH7PS for aromatic amino acids are formed by discrete extensions to the core catalytic barrel of the protein and comprise the allosteric machinery of the enzyme (Fig. 2) (9Blackmore N.J. Reichau S. Jiao W. Hutton R.D. Baker E.N. Jameson G.B. Parker E.J. Three sites and you are out: ternary synergistic allostery controls aromatic amino acid biosynthesis in Mycobacterium tuberculosis.J. Mol. Biol. 2013; 425: 1582-1592Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Key Arg residues, Arg-171 and Arg-256, are responsible for forming interactions with Phe and Tyr, respectively. Substitution of these Arg residues by Ala impairs the allosteric response of MtuDAH7PS activity to Phe and Tyr without compromising catalytic activity (9Blackmore N.J. Reichau S. Jiao W. Hutton R.D. Baker E.N. Jameson G.B. Parker E.J. Three sites and you are out: ternary synergistic allostery controls aromatic amino acid biosynthesis in Mycobacterium tuberculosis.J. Mol. Biol. 2013; 425: 1582-1592Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). We now demonstrate that hetero-octameric complex formation between MtuDAH7PS and MtuCM not only provides an activity boost for MtuCM, but, very significantly, also allows this enzyme to share the allosteric machinery of its much larger complex partner. Our results illuminate an allosteric relay in which Phe binding is linked directly to complex formation and MtuCM activation. Together, the complex formation delivers another level of sophistication to the control of aromatic amino acid biosynthesis and significantly extends the function of the DAH7PS allosteric machinery. MtuDAH7PS and MtuDAH7PS variants were prepared and purified as described previously (9Blackmore N.J. Reichau S. Jiao W. Hutton R.D. Baker E.N. Jameson G.B. Parker E.J.

An MtuCM synthetic gene (Geneart), optimized for Escherichia coli codon usage, was transferred into pDEST 15 using Gateway cloning technology (Invitrogen). This plasmid was then transformed into Escherichia coli BL21 (Star) cells. Transformants containing the recombinant plasmids were grown in Luria-Bertani medium at 37 °C in the presence of ampicillin (100 μg ml−1) until the A600 reached ∼0.6. Protein expression was induced by addition of isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (Roche) (0.5 mm) and incubated overnight at 23 °C. Cells were lysed in buffer A (10 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.5) by sonication. Clarified supernatant was applied to a GSTrap HP (GE Healthcare) and eluted with an increasing gradient of reduced-glutathione (Sigma). Fractions containing GST-tagged MtuCM were pooled and treated with TEV protease and reapplied to the GSTrap HP to remove the cleaved GST tag. Buffer A was supplemented with 1% glycerol to aid tag removal. The protein was further purified by size exclusion chromatography (Superdex 75 16/60) in size exclusion chromatography buffer (10 mm 1,3-bis[tris(hydroxymethyl)methylamino]propane (Sigma), 150 mm NaCl, 200 μm each of tris-(2-carboxyethyl) phosphine hydrochloride (Sigma), MnSO4 (Sigma), and PEP (Research Chemicals). MtuCM protein concentration was determined via Bradford assay using bovine serum albumin as a standard. MtuDAH7PS and MtuDAH7PS variant concentrations were determined using the A280 absorbance via a NanoDrop ND1000 spectrophotometer. The kinetic parameters were derived from measurements of MtuDAH7PS activity obtained by monitoring the loss of PEP at 232 nm (ϵ = 2.8 × 103 m−1·cm−1 at 303 K) in the presence of E4P using a Varian Cary 1 UV-visible spectrophotometer using 1-cm quartz cuvettes and standard assay conditions (9Blackmore N.J.

The assay solutions contained PEP (fixed at 300 μm or varied to determine apparent PEP Km) (Research Chemicals), E4P (fixed at 300 μm or varied to determine apparent E4P Km) (Sigma), and MnSO4 (100 μm) (Sigma) in assay buffer (50 mm 1,3-bis[tris(hydroxymethyl)methylamino]propane (Sigma), pH 7.5, and 1 mm tris-(2-carboxyethyl) phosphine hydrochloride). Kinetic parameters of MtuCM activity were determined by monitoring the loss of chorismate (added as chorismic acid; Sigma) at 274 nm (ϵ = 2.630 m−1·cm−1 at 303 K) in the same assay buffer as MtuDAH7PS, MnSO4 (100 μm), PEP (150 μm), and chorismate varied to determine chorismate Km. Chorismate, PEP, and E4P solutions were made up in assay buffer, and the MnSO4 solution was made up in ultrapure water. Initial reaction rates were determined by a least squares fit of the initial rate data. Apparent Km, Km, and kcat values were determined by fitting the data to the Michaelis-Menten equation by nonlinear regression using software GraFit (Erithacus software). For DAH7PS activity, kcat is taken from both sets of data with either PEP or E4P as the variable substrate. These measured values were within experimental error. For the complexes, CM activity was determined with a 1:10 ratio for CM to DAH7PS, and DAH7PS activity was determined with a 10:1 ratio of CM to DAH7PS. All assay components (except initiating substrate, chorismate, or E4P respectively) were incubated at 303 K for 5 min. Solutions of l-Phe (Sigma), l-Tyr (Sigma), and l-Trp (Sigma) in ultrapure water were added to standard assay reaction mixtures to give a concentration of 200 μm in inhibitor studies. The concentrations of Trp, Phe, and Tyr were varied between 20 μm and 4 mm to determine the effect of increasing aromatic amino acid concentration on MtuCM activity. Steady-state kinetic assays were conducted in the presence of none, one, two, or all three aromatic amino acids. The assay solutions contained PEP (150 μm), E4P (150 μm), and MnSO4 (100 μm) in assay buffer for measurements of DAH7PS activity and chorismate (25 or 150 μm as stated), PEP (150 μm), and MnSO4 (100 μm) in assay buffer for CM activity. Reactions were initiated by the addition of E4P or chorismic acid, respectively. Measurements for CM alone required 3 μm CM, those involving the complex CM activity were determined with a 1:10 ratio of CM to DAH7PS, and the CM concentration was held at 60 nm. The concentration of MtuDAH7PS was held at 40 nm in the presence or absence of MtuCM to measure DAH7PS activity. DAH7PS activity of the complex was determined with a 10:1 ratio of CM to DAH7PS. The half-maximal effective inhibitor concentration values (EC50) were determined by fitting triplicate data to the log[inhibitor] versus response using a nonlinear regression curve and globally fitting in GraphPad Prism6®. Solutions of l-Phe, l-Trp, or l-Tyr were added to the standard assay conditions used to determine the chorismate Km to give a final concentration of either 100 or 200 μm. All assay components were left to incubate (except initiating substrate) for 5 min. Because of high absorbance readings at 274 nm of Tyr, 1-mm-path length cuvettes were used for the measurements in the presence of 200 μm Tyr and 200 μm Tyr and Phe. The smaller cuvettes required an increase in MtuCM concentration to 120 nm to detect CM activity. The ratio of CM to DAH7PS was kept at 1:10. The kinetic parameters were determined by measuring CM activity at various concentrations of MtuDAH7PS under the standard assay conditions described above, in the absence of ligand or presence of 200 μm Phe, Trp or Tyr. The MtuCM concentration was held at 10 nm (90 nm in the absence of MtuDAH7PS). For each MtuDAH7PS concentration, at least seven points were used to determine the Michaelis-Menten kinetic parameters and to find the catalytic efficiency (kcat/Km) of MtuCM activity. Each set of Michaelis-Menten kinetics was conducted in duplicate. The Kd,app was derived using the equations adapted from Taira and Benkovic (18Taira K. Benkovic S.J.

Kd,app is the apparent dissociation constant of the complex. Analytical ultracentrifugation samples of MtuDAH7PS, MtuCM, and combinations of these proteins were dialyzed for 2–3 h against a 50 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, and 150 μm MnSO4 buffer at pH 7.5 prior to each experiment. The dialysis buffer was used as the buffer blank. Sedimentation velocity experiments were performed in a Beckman Coulter model XL-I analytical ultracentrifuge equipped with UV-visible scanning optics. Reference buffer solution and sample solutions were loaded into 12-mm double-sector cells with quartz windows, and the cells were then mounted in an An-60 Ti 4-hole rotor. Samples at different protein concentrations 0.2 mg·ml−1, 0.4 mg·ml−1, and 0.6 mg·ml−1 (380 μl) and reference (400 μl) were centrifuged at 50,000 rpm at 20 °C, and absorbance data were collected in continuous mode at 278 or 279 nm without averaging. The data were fitted to a continuous size distribution model (19Schuck P.

The partial specific volume (v̄) of the proteins, buffer density (1.005 g·ml−1) and buffer viscosity (1.021 cp) were calculated using the program SEDNTERP (20Lebowitz J. Lewis M.S. Schuck P. Modern analytical ultracentrifugation in protein science: a tutorial review.Protein Sci. 2002; 11: 2067-2079Crossref PubMed Scopus (618) Google Scholar). The partial specific volume of the complex was calculated using Equation 2, v¯=v¯1⋅Mw1+v¯2⋅Mw2Mw1+Mw2(Eq. 2) where, respectively, v̄1 and Mw1 are the partial specific volume and molecular weight of MtuDAH7PS, and v̄2 and Mw2 are the partial specific volume and molecular weight of MtuCM. For the sedimentation equilibrium experiments, MtuDAH7PSWT concentrations of 0.2, 0.4, and 0.6 mg·ml−1 (3.9, 7.9, and 11.9 μm, respectively, based on the molecular weight of monomer) were used. Protein solutions (110 μl) and the reference buffer solutions (120 μl) were loaded into the cells and centrifuged at 6,000, 8,000, 10,000, and 12,000 rpm until sedimentation equilibrium was attained, as determined by matching the root mean square differences between the last scans. At sedimentation equilibrium, the final absorbance versus radial position profile was collected at 20 °C at 279 and 288 nm for MtuDAH7PSWT and 4:1 mixtures of MtuCM and MtuDAH7PSWT, respectively. Different wavelengths were chosen to optimally collect data at different concentrations. A global fit to the multispeed data were performed using a species analysis model in SEDPHAT (21Vistica J.

The inclusion of MtuDAH7PS in the assays, however, significantly enhances the catalytic activity of the enzyme, increasing the specific activity by over 120-fold in accordance with previous studies (15Sasso S. Okvist M. Roderer K. Gamper M. Codoni G. Krengel U. Kast P.

The enhancement arises from both a decrease in the Michaelis constant and an increase in the turnover number. MtuDAH7PS activity was also enhanced in the presence of MtuCM, although the level of activation, as expressed by the increase in kcat/Km ratio on association with MtuCM, was far more modest.TABLE 1Enhancement of MtuCM and MtuDAH7PS activities by complex formationProteinCM activityDAH7PS activitykcatKmkcat/KmActivation factoraActivation factors are calculated from the ratios of kcat/Km with and without the complex partner present.

Open table in a new tab Formation of a hetero-octameric complex between CM and DAH7PS was observed by analytical ultracentrifugation (Fig. 3). Sedimentation velocity experiments for MtuDAH7PSWT and 4:1 mixtures of MtuCM and MtuDAH7PSWT were performed at three protein concentrations. For MtuDAH7PSWT, data fitting to a continuous size distribution model indicates the presence of a major species with a standardized sedimentation coefficient of 9.0 S (Fig. 3). The calculated mass of this species is 164 kDa, smaller than the expected mass of a homotetrameric species (predicted molecular mass, 204 kDa). When MtuCM was added to the MtuDAH7PS, a species with a larger sedimentation coefficient (10.2S) was observed at all three concentrations corresponding to a larger species of ∼220 kDa, consistent with the predicted molecular mass of the hetero-octameric species (245 kDa). A smaller species (3S) was also observed, corresponding to a molecular mass of ∼30 kDa. This observation of this species is consistent with the presence of homodimeric MtuCM (predicted mass of 20.7 kDa), which is present in excess but has a significantly reduced molar absorptivity in comparison to MtuDAH7PSWT. To confirm the oligomeric states of MtuDAH7PSWT and MtuCM-MtuDAH7PSWT, sedimentation equilibrium experiments were performed (Fig. 4, A–C). Global species analysis of the MtuDAH7PSWT data yields a major species with calculated molecular mass of 202 kDa, consistent with the expected tetrameric species (predicted mass of 204 kDa). In comparison, the experiments performed on the MtuCM-MtuDAH7PSWT combination establish the presence of two species of ∼21 and 236 kDa, consistent with the presence of excess homodimeric MtuCM and the hetero-octameric MtuDAH7PS-MtuCM complex (expected"

Several nations now aim to monitor and improve mental wellbeing. Whilst many studies document associations between adverse childhood experiences and mental disorders in adulthood, possible links between childhood experiences and adult mental wellbeing have so far received less attention.Using data from 1976 men and women in the MRC National Survey for Health and Development, we investigated prospective associations between childhood socioeconomic and psychosocial environments and the Warwick Edinburgh Mental Wellbeing Scale, designed to capture both hedonic and eudaimonic facets of wellbeing, at age 60-64.Whilst there was no evidence that childhood socioeconomic circumstances were related to later wellbeing independently of other childhood experiences, elements of childrearing and parenting, parental health and adjustment, and childhood illness were related. More advantaged socioeconomic position was associated with greater wellbeing but this did not explain the links between these childhood exposures and adult wellbeing, suggesting alternative explanatory pathways should be considered.Childhood illness and family psychosocial environment are associated with mental wellbeing in early older age, with effects sizes that are larger or comparable to socioeconomic circumstances in adulthood. Initiatives to improve the nation's mental wellbeing that include programmes targeted to supporting families and children may additionally have benefits that continue into older age."
https://openalex.org/W1962911110,"Mutations of the forkhead transcription factor FOXP2 gene have been implicated in inherited speech-and-language disorders, and specific Foxp2 expression patterns in neuronal populations and neuronal phenotypes arising from Foxp2 disruption have been described. However, molecular functions of FOXP2 are not completely understood. Here we report a requirement for FOXP2 in growth arrest of the osteosarcoma cell line 143B. We observed endogenous expression of this transcription factor both transiently in normally developing murine osteoblasts and constitutively in human SAOS-2 osteosarcoma cells blocked in early osteoblast development. Critically, we demonstrate that in 143B osteosarcoma cells with minimal endogenous expression, FOXP2 induced by growth arrest is required for up-regulation of p21WAF1/CIP1. Upon growth factor withdrawal, FOXP2 induction occurs rapidly and precedes p21WAF1/CIP1 activation. Additionally, FOXP2 expression could be induced by MAPK pathway inhibition in growth-arrested 143B cells, but not in traditional cell line models of osteoblast differentiation (MG-63, C2C12, MC3T3-E1). Our data are consistent with a model in which transient upregulation of Foxp2 in pre-osteoblast mesenchymal cells regulates a p21-dependent growth arrest checkpoint, which may have implications for normal mesenchymal and osteosarcoma biology."
https://openalex.org/W589563988,"The efficiency of hybrid seed production can be improved by increasing the percentage of exserted stigma, which is closely related to the stigma length in rice. In the chromosome segment substitute line (CSSL) population derived from Nipponbare (recipient) and Kasalath (donor), a single CSSL (SSSL14) was found to show a longer stigma length than that of Nipponbare. The difference in stigma length between Nipponbare and SSSL14 was controlled by one locus (qSTL3). Using 7,917 individuals from the SSSL14/Nipponbare F2 population, the qSTL3 locus was delimited to a 19.8-kb region in the middle of the short arm of chromosome 3. Within the 19.8-kb chromosome region, three annotated genes (LOC_Os03g14850, LOC_Os03g14860 and LOC_Os03g14880) were found in the rice genome annotation database. According to gene sequence alignments in LOC_Os03g14850, a transition of G (Nipponbare) to A (Kasalath) was detected at the 474-bp site in CDS. The transition created a stop codon, leading to a deletion of 28 amino acids in the deduced peptide sequence in Kasalath. A T-DNA insertion mutant (05Z11CN28) of LOC_Os03g14850 showed a longer stigma length than that of wild type (Zhonghua 11), validating that LOC_Os03g14850 is the gene controlling stigma length. However, the Kasalath allele of LOC_Os03g14850 is unique because all of the alleles were the same as that of Nipponbare at the 474-bp site in the CDS of LOC_Os03g14850 among the investigated accessions with different stigma lengths. A gene-specific InDel marker LQ30 was developed for improving stigma length during rice hybrid breeding by marker-assisted selection."

Mechanistically, the decreased concentration of MLCK, phospho-MLC20 and phospho-MYPT1 and increased concentration of MLCP and PKC were observed after TBI, and these events mediated by TBI were efficiently prevented by Lactobacillus acidophilus application.

https://openalex.org/W650087274,"In our previous study, we found that pretreatment with lipoamide (LM) more effectively than alpha-lipoic acid (LA) protected retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells from the acrolein-induced damage. However, the reasons and mechanisms for the greater effect of LM than LA are unclear. We hypothesize that LM, rather than the more direct antioxidant LA, may act more as an indirect antioxidant. In the present study, we treated ARPE-19 cells with LA and LM and compared their effects on activation of mitochondrial biogenesis and induction of phase II enzyme systems. It is found that LM is more effective than LA on increasing mitochondrial biogenesis and inducing the expression of nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) and its translocation to the nucleus, leading to an increase in expression or activity of phase II antioxidant enzymes (NQO-1, GST, GCL, catalase and Cu/Zn SOD). Further study demonstrated that mitochondrial biogenesis and phase II enzyme induction are closely coupled via energy requirements. These results suggest that LM, compared with the direct antioxidant LA, plays its protective effect on oxidative damage more as an indirect antioxidant to simultaneously stimulate mitochondrial biogenesis and induction of phase II antioxidant enzymes."

https://openalex.org/W631070754,"Single-cell RNA and protein concentrations dynamically fluctuate because of stochastic (""noisy"") regulation. Consequently, biological signaling and genetic networks not only translate stimuli with functional response but also random fluctuations. Intuitively, this feature manifests as the accumulation of fluctuations from the network source to the target. Taking advantage of the fact that noise propagates directionally, we developed a method for causation prediction that does not require time-lagged observations and therefore can be applied to data generated by destructive assays such as immunohistochemistry. Our method for causation prediction, ""Inference of Network Directionality Using Covariance Elements (INDUCE),"" exploits the theoretical relationship between a change in the strength of a causal interaction and the associated changes in the single cell measured entries of the covariance matrix of protein concentrations. We validated our method for causation prediction in two experimental systems where causation is well established: in an E. coli synthetic gene network, and in MEK to ERK signaling in mammalian cells. We report the first analysis of covariance elements documenting noise propagation from a kinase to a phosphorylated substrate in an endogenous mammalian signaling network."
https://openalex.org/W1777162252,"Purpose The present study aims to examine the association between religious involvement and mental disorder (anxiety disorder, mood disorder, alcohol use disorder) in a general Chinese population, and explore connections between religious belief and mental disorders in the Hui and Han ethnic groups. Method Data were examined from a representative sample of 2,770 community-dwelling adults in the province of Ningxia located in western China. Self-reported religious attendance and the importance of religious in daily life were measured. The WHO Composite International Diagnostic Interview was used to diagnose mental disorders. Results In the overall sample, the importance of religious affiliation was positively associated with mental disorders (especially anxiety) (p<0.01). No association was found between any religious characteristic and mood disorders or alcohol use disorders. With regard to analyses within different ethnic groups, religious affiliation was positively associated with mental disorder in Han ethnicity (p<0.01), but not in Hui ethnicity. When stratified by age and ethnic group, religious affiliation was associated positively with mental disorder in younger Han (p<0.01); whereas high religiosity was associated positively with mental disorder in older Hui (p<0.05). Among older Hui, however, religious affiliation was inversely associated with mood disorder (p<0.05). Conclusions In contrast to most previous studies in Western populations, religious involvement is less likely to be inversely related to mental disorder in Mainland China, although this association varies by age and ethnic group."
https://openalex.org/W1562375685,"Viruses can trigger apoptosis of infected host cells if not counteracted by cellular or viral anti-apoptotic proteins. These protective proteins either inhibit the activation of caspases or they act as Bcl-2 homologs to prevent Bax/Bak-mediated outer mitochondrial membrane permeabilization (MOMP). The exact mechanism by which viruses trigger MOMP has however remained enigmatic. Here we use two distinct types of viruses, a double stranded DNA virus, herpes simplex virus-1 (HSV-1) and a positive sense, single stranded RNA virus, Semliki Forest virus (SFV) to show that the BH3-only protein Puma is the major mediator of virus-induced Bax/Bak activation and MOMP induction. Indeed, when Puma was genetically deleted or downregulated by shRNA, mouse embryonic fibroblasts and IL-3-dependent monocytes as well as human colon carcinoma cells were as resistant to virus-induced apoptosis as their Bax/Bak double deficient counterparts (Bax/Bak-/-). Puma protein expression started to augment after 2 h postinfection with both viruses. Puma mRNA levels increased as well, but this occurred after apoptosis initiation (MOMP) because it was blocked in cells lacking Bax/Bak or overexpressing Bcl-xL. Moreover, none of the classical Puma transcription factors such as p53, p73 or p65 NFκB were involved in HSV-1-induced apoptosis. Our data suggest that viruses use a Puma protein-dependent mechanism to trigger MOMP and apoptosis in host cells."
https://openalex.org/W1669930722,"Muscle force is potentiated by countermovement; this phenomenon is called stretch-shortening cycle (SSC) effect. In this study, we examined the factors strongly related to SSC effect in vivo, focusing on tendon elongation, preactivation, and residual force enhancement. Twelve healthy men participated in this study. Ankle joint angle was passively moved by a dynamometer, with a range of motion from 15° dorsiflexion (DF) to 15° plantarflexion (PF). Muscle contraction was evoked by electrical stimulation, with stimulation timing adjusted to elicit three types of contraction: (1) concentric contraction without preliminary contraction (CON), (2) concentric contraction after preliminary eccentric contraction (ECC), and (3) concentric contraction after preliminary isometric contraction (ISO). Joint torque was recorded at DF5°, PF0°, and PF5°, respectively. SSC effect was calculated as the ratio of joint torque obtained in ECC or ISO with respect to that obtained in CON at the aforementioned three joint angles. SSC effect was prominent in the first half of movement in both ECC (DF5°, 329.3 ± 101.2%; PF0°, 159.2 ± 29.4%; PF5°, 125.5 ± 20.8%) and ISO (DF5°, 276.4 ± 87.0%; PF0°, 134.5 ± 24.5%; PF5°, 106.8 ± 18.0%) conditions. SSC effect was significantly larger in ECC than in ISO at all joint angles (P < 0.001). Even without preliminary eccentric contraction (i.e., ISO condition), SSC effect was clearly large, indicating that a significant part of SSC effect is derived from preactivation. However, the active lengthening-induced force potentiation mechanism (residual force enhancement) also contributes to SSC effect."
https://openalex.org/W646893053,"Most societies prohibit some market transactions based on moral concerns, even when the exchanges would benefit the parties involved and would not create negative externalities. A prominent example is given by payments for human organs for transplantation, banned virtually everywhere despite long waiting lists and many deaths of patients who cannot find a donor. Recent research, however, has shown that individuals significantly increase their stated support for a regulated market for human organs when provided with information about the organ shortage and the potential beneficial effects a price mechanism. In this study we focused on payments for human organs and on another ""repugnant"" transaction, indoor prostitution, to address two questions: (A) Does providing general information on the welfare properties of prices and markets modify attitudes toward repugnant trades? (B) Does additional knowledge on the benefits of a price mechanism in a specific context affect attitudes toward price-based transactions in another context? By answering these questions, we can assess whether eliciting a market-oriented approach may lead to a relaxation of moral opposition to markets, and whether there is a cross-effect of information, in particular for morally controversial activities that, although different, share a reference to the ""commercialization"" of the human body. Relying on an online survey experiment with 5,324 U.S. residents, we found no effect of general information about market efficiency, consistent with morally controversial markets being accepted only when they are seen as a solution to a specific problem. We also found some cross-effects of information about a transaction on the acceptance of the other; however, the responses were mediated by the gender and (to a lesser extent) religiosity of the respondent--in particular, women exposed to information about legalizing prostitution reduced their stated support for regulated organ payments. We relate these findings to prior research and discuss implications for public policy."

Inhibition of the CCR5 axis by passive or active immunisation offers one very selective strategy for intervention. In this study we define a new linear epitope within the extracellular domain of CCR5 recognised by two independently produced monoclonal antibodies. A short peptide encoding the linear epitope can induce antibodies which recognise the intact receptor when administered colinear with a tetanus toxoid helper T cell epitope. The monoclonal antibody RoAb 13 is shown to bind to both cells and peptide with moderate to high affinity (6x10^8 and 1.2x107 M-1 respectively), and binding to the peptide is enhanced by sulfation of tyrosines at positions 10 and 14. RoAb13, which has previously been shown to block HIV infection, also blocks migration of monocytes in response to CCR5 binding chemokines and to inflammatory macrophage conditioned medium. A Fab fragment of RoAb13 has been crystallised and a structure of the antibody is reported to 2.1 angstrom resolution."
https://openalex.org/W590459544,"Purpose Socioeconomic inequality in return to work after cancer treatment and rehabilitation have been documented, but less is known about its causes. This paper investigates the role played by breast cancer stage at diagnosis and comorbidity. Methods We used the comprehensive Danish Cancer Registry to follow 7372 women aged 30-60, who were in the labour force when diagnosed with breast cancer in 2000-06 and survived at least three years. Controls were 213,276 women without breast cancer. Inequalities in employment outlook were estimated as interaction effects in linear regression between educational attainment and disease on employment. Results There is significant interaction between education and breast cancer, but it is only marginally affected by including stage and comorbidity in the regression models. Education, breast cancer stage, and comorbidity all have strong effects on later employment, and a considerable amount of the educational effect is mediated by comorbidity and pre-cancer labour market participation and income. Conclusion The result of the study is negative in the sense that the stronger effect of breast cancer on employment among low-educated compared to highly educated individuals is not explained by cancer stage or comorbidity. The fact that comorbidity has little impact on inequality may be due to a different social patterning of most comorbidity compared to breast cancer."

Roles for specific proteins were elucidated using chemical inhibitors, depletion with small inhibitory RNA, and cells from knock-out mice. Optimal inhibition occurs with exposures to a •NO flux of ∼28 nmol/min for 2 min or more, which sets up an autocatalytic cascade triggered by activating type 2 nitric-oxide synthase (NOS-2) and NADPH oxidase (NOX).

https://openalex.org/W2166607711,"Under conditions of low oxygen availability, Neisseria meningitidis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae are able to respire via a partial denitrification pathway in which nitrite is converted to nitrous oxide. In this process, nitrite reductase (AniA), a copper (Cu)-containing protein converts nitrite to NO, and this product is converted to nitrous oxide by nitric oxide reductase (NorB). NorB also confers protection against toxic NO, and so we devised a conditional lethal screen, using a norB mutant, to identify mutants that were resistant to nitrite-dependent killing. After random-deletion mutagenesis of N. meningitidis, this genetic screen identified a gene encoding a Cu chaperone that is essential for AniA function, AccA. Purified AccA binds one Cu (I) ion and also possesses a second binding site for Cu (II). This novel periplasmic Cu chaperone (AccA) appears to be essential for provision of Cu ions to AniA of pathogenic Neisseria to generate an active nitrite reductase. Apart from the Neisseria genus, AccA is distributed across a wide range of environmental Proteobacteria species."
https://openalex.org/W2106110012,"The maltose regulon (mal regulon) has previously been shown to consist of the mal gene cluster (malMP, malXCD and malAR operons) in Streptococcus pneumoniae. In this study, we have further elucidated the complete mal regulon in S. pneumoniae D39 using microarray analyses and β-galactosidase assays. In addition to the mal gene cluster, the complete mal regulon of S. pneumoniae D39 consists of a pullulanase (PulA), a glucosidase (DexB), a glucokinase (RokB), a PTS component (PtsG) and an amylase (AmyA2). Our microarray studies and β-galactosidase assays further showed that the LacI-family transcriptional regulator MalR represses the expression of the mal regulon in the absence of maltose. Furthermore, the role of the pleiotropic transcriptional regulator CcpA in the regulation of the mal regulon in the presence of maltose was explored. Our microarray analysis with a ΔccpA strain showed that CcpA only represses the expression of the malXCD operon and the pulA gene in the presence of maltose. Hence, we extend the mal regulon now consisting of pulA, dexB, rokB, ptsG and amyA2 in addition to malMP, malXCD and malAR operons."
https://openalex.org/W1726762055,"Production of olfactory bulb neurons occurs continuously in the rodent brain. Little is known, however, about cellular diversity in the glutamatergic neuron subpopulation. In the central nervous system, the basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor NeuroD1 (ND1) is commonly associated with glutamatergic neuron development. In this study, we utilized ND1 to identify the different subpopulations of olfactory bulb glutamategic neurons and their progenitors, both in the embryo and postnatally. Using knock-in mice, transgenic mice and retroviral transgene delivery, we demonstrate the existence of several different populations of glutamatergic olfactory bulb neurons, the progenitors of which are ND1+ and ND1- lineage-restricted, and are temporally and regionally separated. We show that the first olfactory bulb glutamatergic neurons produced – the mitral cells – can be divided into molecularly diverse subpopulations. Our findings illustrate the complexity of neuronal diversity in the olfactory bulb and that seemingly homogenous neuronal populations can consist of multiple subpopulations with unique molecular signatures of transcription factors and expressing neuronal subtype-specific markers."
https://openalex.org/W2951216382,"Gene coexpression networks inferred by correlation from high-throughput profiling such as microarray data represent simple but effective structures for discovering and interpreting linear gene relationships. In recent years, several approaches have been proposed to tackle the problem of deciding when the resulting correlation values are statistically significant. This is most crucial when the number of samples is small, yielding a non-negligible chance that even high correlation values are due to random effects. Here we introduce a novel hard thresholding solution based on the assumption that a coexpression network inferred by randomly generated data is expected to be empty. The threshold is theoretically derived by means of an analytic approach and, as a deterministic independent null model, it depends only on the dimensions of the starting data matrix, with assumptions on the skewness of the data distribution compatible with the structure of gene expression levels data. We show, on synthetic and array datasets, that the proposed threshold is effective in eliminating all false positive links, with an offsetting cost in terms of false negative detected edges."
https://openalex.org/W2096644728,"Avian influenza A H7N7/NL/219/03 virus creates a serious pandemic threat to human health because it can transmit directly from domestic poultry to humans and from human to human. Our previous vaccine study reported that mice when immunized intranasally (i.n) with live Bac-HA were protected from lethal H7N7/NL/219/03 challenge, whereas incomplete protection was obtained when administered subcutaneously (s.c) due to the fact that H7N7 is a poor inducer of neutralizing antibodies. Interestingly, our recent vaccine studies reported that mice when vaccinated subcutaneously with Bac-HA (H7N9) was protected against both H7N9 (A/Sh2/2013) and H7N7 virus challenge. HA1 region of both H7N7 and H7N9 viruses are differ at 15 amino acid positions. Among those, we selected three amino acid positions (T143, T198 and I211) in HA1 region of H7N7. These amino acids are located within or near the receptor binding site. Following the selection, we substituted the amino acid at these three positions with amino acids found on H7N9HA wild-type. In this study, we evaluate the impact of amino acid substitutions in the H7N7 HA-protein on the immunogenicity. We generated six mutant constructs from wild-type influenza H7N7HA cDNA by site directed mutagenesis, and individually expressed mutant HA protein on the surface of baculovirus (Bac-HAm) and compared their protective efficacy of the vaccines with Bac-H7N7HA wild-type (Bac-HA) by lethal H7N7 viral challenge in a mouse model. We found that mice immunized subcutaneously with Bac-HAm constructs T143A or T198A-I211V or I211V-T143A serum showed significantly higher hemagglutination inhibition and neutralization titer against H7N7 and H7N9 viruses when compared to Bac-HA vaccinated mice groups. We also observed low level of lung viral titer, negligible weight loss and complete protection against lethal H7N7 viral challenge. Our results indicated that amino acid substitution at position 143 or 211 improve immunogenicity of H7N7HA vaccine against H7N7/NL/219/03 virus."
https://openalex.org/W588522468,"Radioisotopes that emit electrons (beta particles), such as radioiodine, can effectively kill target cells, including cancer cells. Aqueous 32P[PO4] is a pure beta-emitter that has been used for several decades to treat non-malignant human myeloproliferative diseases. 32P[PO4] was directly compared to a more powerful pure beta-emitter, the clinically important 90Y isotope. In vitro, 32P[PO4] was more effective at killing cells than was the more powerful isotope 90Y (P ≤ 0.001) and also caused substantially more double-stranded DNA breaks than did 90Y. In vivo, a single low-dose intravenous dose of aqueous elemental 32P significantly inhibited tumor growth in the syngeneic murine cancer model (P ≤ 0.001). This effect is exerted by direct incorporation into nascent DNA chains, resulting in double-stranded breakage, a unique mechanism not duplicatable by other, more powerful electron-emitting radioisotopes. 32P[PO4] should be considered for human clinical trials as a potential novel anti-cancer drug."
https://openalex.org/W982967096,"PpsR is a major regulator of photosynthesis gene expression among all characterized purple photosynthetic bacteria. This transcription regulator has been extensively characterized in Rhodobacter (Rba.) capsulatus and Rba. sphaeroides which are members of the α-proteobacteria lineage. In this study, we have investigated the biochemical properties and mutational effects of a ppsR deletion strain in the β-proteobacterium Rubrivivax (Rvi.) gelatinosus in order to reveal phylogenetically conserved mechanisms and species-specific characteristics. A deletion of the ppsR gene resulted in de-repression of photosystem synthesis showing that PpsR functions as a repressor of photosynthesis genes in this species. We also constructed a Rvi. gelatinosus PpsR mutant in which a conserved cysteine at position 436 was changed to an alanine to examine whether or not this residue is important for sensing redox, as reported in Rhodobacter species. Surprisingly, the Cys436 Ala mutant retained the ability to repress photosynthesis gene expression under aerobic conditions, suggesting that PpsR from Rvi. gelatinosus has different redox-responding characteristics. Furthermore, biochemical analyses demonstrated that Rvi. gelatinosus PpsR only shows redox-dependent binding to promoters with 9-bp spacing, but not 8-bp spacing, between two PpsR-recognition sequences. These results indicate that redox-dependent binding of PpsR requires appropriate cis configuration of PpsR target sequences in Rvi. gelatinosus. These results also indicate that PpsR homologs from different species regulate photosynthesis genes with altered biochemical properties."
https://openalex.org/W2220516760,"The effects of amino acid supply and insulin infusion on skin protein kinetics (fractional synthesis rate (FSR), fractional breakdown rate (FBR), and net balance (NB)) in pigs were investigated. Four-month-old pigs were divided into four groups as follows: control, insulin (INS), amino acid (AA), and INS + AA groups based on the nutritional and hormonal conditions. l-[ring-(13)C6]Phenylalanine was infused. FBR was estimated from the enrichment ratio of arterial phenylalanine to intracellular free phenylalanine. Plasma INS was increased (p < 0.05) in the INS and INS + AA groups. Plasma glucose was maintained by infusion of glucose in the groups receiving INS. The interventions did not change the NB of skin protein. However, the interventions affected the FSR and FBR differently. An infusion of INS significantly increased both FSR and FBR, although AA infusion did not. When an AA infusion was added to the infusion of insulin (INS + AA group), FSR and FBR were both lower when compared with the INS group. Our data demonstrate that in anesthetized pigs INS infusion did not exert an anabolic effect, but rather it increased AA cycling into and out of skin protein. Because co-infusion of AAs with INS ameliorated this effect, it is likely that the increased AA cycling during INS infusion was related to AA supply. Although protein kinetics were affected by both INS and AAs, none of the interventions affected the skin protein deposition. Thus, skin protein content is closely regulated under normal circumstances and is not subject to transient changes in AAs or hormonal concentrations."
https://openalex.org/W1485890614,"Degradation of ornithine decarboxylase, the rate-limiting enzyme of polyamine biosynthesis, is promoted by the protein antizyme. Expression of antizyme is positively regulated by rising polyamine concentrations that induce a +1 translational frameshift required for production of the full-length protein. Antizyme itself is negatively regulated by the antizyme inhibitor. In our study, the regulation of Caenorhabditis elegans antizyme was investigated, and the antizyme inhibitor was identified. By applying a novel GFP-based method to monitor antizyme frameshifting in vivo, we show that the induction of translational frameshifting also occurs under stressful conditions. Interestingly, during starvation, the initiation of frameshifting was independent of polyamine concentrations. Because frameshifting was also prevalent in a polyamine auxotroph double mutant, a polyamine-independent regulation of antizyme frameshifting is suggested. Polyamine-independent induction of antizyme expression was found to be negatively regulated by the peptide transporter PEPT-1, as well as the target of rapamycin, but not by the daf-2 insulin signaling pathway. Stress-dependent expression of C. elegans antizyme occurred morely slowly than expression in response to increased polyamine levels, pointing to a more general reaction to unfavorable conditions and a diversion away from proliferation and reproduction toward conservation of energy. Interestingly, antizyme expression was found to drastically increase in aging individuals in a postreproductive manner. Although knockdown of antizyme did not affect the lifespan of C. elegans, knockdown of the antizyme inhibitor led to a significant reduction in lifespan. This is most likely caused by an increase in antizyme-mediated degradation of ornithine decarboxylase-1 and a resulting reduction in cellular polyamine levels."
https://openalex.org/W627439640,"How should the efficiency of searching for real objects in real scenes be measured? Traditionally, when searching for artificial targets, e.g., letters or rectangles, among distractors, efficiency is measured by a reaction time (RT) × Set Size function. However, it is not clear whether the set size of real scenes is as effective a parameter for measuring search efficiency as the set size of artificial scenes. The present study investigated search efficiency in real scenes based on a combination of low-level features, e.g., visible size and target-flanker separation factors, and high-level features, e.g., category effect and target template. Visible size refers to the pixel number of visible parts of an object in a scene, whereas separation is defined as the sum of the flank distances from a target to the nearest distractors. During the experiment, observers searched for targets in various urban scenes, using pictures as the target templates. The results indicated that the effect of the set size in real scenes decreased according to the variances of other factors, e.g., visible size and separation. Increasing visible size and separation factors increased search efficiency. Based on these results, an RT × Visible Size × Separation function was proposed. These results suggest that the proposed function is a practicable predictor of search efficiency in real scenes."
https://openalex.org/W1788390357,"A number of bacteria belonging to the PVC (Planctomycetes-Verrucomicrobia-Chlamydiae) super-phylum contain unusual ribosome-bearing intracellular membranes. The evolutionary origins and functions of these membranes are unknown. Some proteins putatively associated with the presence of intracellular membranes in PVC bacteria contain signal peptides. Signal peptides mark proteins for translocation across the cytoplasmic membrane in prokaryotes, and the membrane of the endoplasmic reticulum in eukaryotes, by highly conserved Sec machinery. This suggests that proteins might be targeted to intracellular membranes in PVC bacteria via the Sec pathway. Here, we show that canonical signal peptides are significantly over-represented in proteins preferentially present in PVC bacteria possessing intracellular membranes, indicating involvement of Sec translocase in their cellular targeting. We also characterized Sec proteins using comparative genomics approaches, focusing on the PVC super-phylum. While we were unable to detect unique changes in Sec proteins conserved among membrane-bearing PVC species, we identified (1) SecA ATPase domain re-arrangements in some Planctomycetes, and (2) secondary SecA_DEAD domain proteins in the genomes of some Planctomycetes, Verrucomicrobia, Proteobacteria, Nitrospirae and Chlorobi. This is the first report of potentially duplicated SecA in Gram-negative bacteria. The phylogenetic distribution of secondary SecA_DEAD domain proteins suggests that the presence of these proteins is not related to the occurrence of PVC endomembranes. Further genomic analysis showed that secondary SecA_DEAD domain proteins are located within genomic neighborhoods that also encode three proteins possessing domains specific for the Type I secretion system."
https://openalex.org/W576430701,"The article analyzes a linear-city model where the consumer distribution can be asymmetric, which is important because in real markets this distribution is often asymmetric. The model yields equilibrium price differences, even though the firms' costs are equal and their locations are symmetric (at the two endpoints of the city). The equilibrium price difference is proportional to the transportation cost parameter and does not depend on the good's cost. The firms' markups are also proportional to the transportation cost. The two firms' prices will be equal in equilibrium if and only if half of the consumers are located to the left of the city's midpoint, even if other characteristics of the consumer distribution are highly asymmetric. An extension analyzes what happens when the firms have different costs and how the two sources of asymmetry - the consumer distribution and the cost per unit - interact together. The model can be useful as a tool for further development by other researchers interested in applying this simple yet flexible framework for the analysis of various topics."
