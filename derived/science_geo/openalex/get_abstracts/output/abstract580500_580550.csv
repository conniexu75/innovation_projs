Evidence has revealed the pivotal role of the gut microbiota in shaping the immune system. To date, only a few of these microbes have been shown to modulate specific immune parameters. Herein, we broadly identify the immunomodulatory effects of phylogenetically diverse human gut microbes. We monocolonized mice with each of 53 individual bacterial species and systematically analyzed host immunologic adaptation to colonization. Most microbes exerted several specialized, complementary, and redundant transcriptional and immunomodulatory effects. Surprisingly, these were independent of microbial phylogeny. Microbial diversity in the gut ensures robustness of the microbiota’s ability to generate a consistent immunomodulatory impact, serving as a highly important epigenetic system. This study provides a foundation for investigation of gut microbiota-host mutualism, highlighting key players that could identify important therapeutics."

However, how niche cells differentially regulate HSC functions remains unknown. Here, we show that the effects of cytokines regulating HSC functions are dependent on the producing cell sources. Deletion of chemokine C-X-C motif ligand 12 (Cxcl12) or stem cell factor (Scf) from all perivascular cells marked by nestin-GFP dramatically depleted BM HSCs. Selective Cxcl12 deletion from arteriolar NG2+ cells, but not from sinusoidal LepR+ cells, caused HSC reductions and altered HSC localization in BM. By contrast, deletion of Scf in LepR+ cells, but not NG2+ cells, led to reductions in BM HSC numbers. These results uncover distinct contributions of cytokines derived from perivascular cells in separate vascular niches to HSC maintenance."

Extensive synaptic connectivity is often cited as a key element of neural computation, a prime example being the cerebral cortex, where neurons each receive thousands of inputs. However, the majority of neurons in the human brain, the 50 billion neurons that form the cerebellar granule-cell layer, each receive input from only about four of the mossy fibers innervating the cerebellum (Eccles et al., 1966Eccles J.C.

Sparse input is a feature shared by neurons that play roles analogous to granule cells in other neural circuits with cerebellum-like structures, such as the dorsal cochlear nucleus, the electrosensory lobe of electric fish, and the insect mushroom body (Mugnaini et al., 1980Mugnaini E.

What is the functional role of diversity in synaptic connectivity, and what determines the appropriate number of input connections to a given neuronal type? In this study, we address these questions by investigating the ability of populations of neurons with different degrees of connectivity to support associative learning. Both cerebellar and cerebrocortical regions are involved in a variety of experience-dependent adaptive behaviors (Raymond et al., 1996Raymond J.L. Lisberger S.G.

Cortical plasticity: from synapses to maps.Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1998; 21: 149-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (1600) Google Scholar). In cerebellar cortex and other cerebellum-like circuits, synaptic modifications associated with learning occur among the elaborate dendrites of densely connected output neurons— for example, cerebellar Purkinje cells (Ito et al., 1982Ito M.

Physiol. 1982; 324: 113-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (668) Google Scholar) and the output neurons of the Drosophila mushroom body (Hige et al., 2015Hige T. Aso Y. Modi M.N. Rubin G.M. Turner G.C. Heterosynaptic plasticity underlies aversive olfactory learning in Drosophila.Neuron. 2015; 88: 985-998Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Classic Marr-Albus theories of associative learning propose that the abundance of granule cells supports a high-dimensional representation of the information conveyed to the cerebellum by mossy fibers and that the large number of synapses received by Purkinje cells allows them access to this representation to form associations (Marr, 1969Marr D. A theory of cerebellar cortex.J. Physiol. 1969; 202: 437-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (2187) Google Scholar, Albus, 1971Albus J.S. A theory of cerebellar function.Math. Biosci. 1971; 10: 25-61Crossref Scopus (1695) Google Scholar). These theories assume that the inputs to granule cells are random and are not modified during learning. Anatomical and physiological studies suggest that the handful of inputs received by granule cells in the electrosensory lobe of electric fish (Kennedy et al., 2014Kennedy A. Wayne G. Kaifosh P.

In Marr-Albus theories, learning in cerebellar cortex relies exclusively on climbing-fiber-dependent modifications of the connections between parallel fibers and Purkinje cells, but unsupervised forms of plasticity have been reported for synapses from mossy fibers onto granule cells (Hansel et al., 2001Hansel C.

The logic of experience-dependent circuit modifications is less clear in cerebral cortex, where densely connected neurons exhibit diverse forms of synaptic plasticity (Abbott and Nelson, 2000Abbott L.F. Nelson S.B. Synaptic plasticity: taming the beast.Nat. Neurosci. 2000; 3: 1178-1183Crossref PubMed Scopus (1461) Google Scholar). Recent theoretical studies have proposed that populations of randomly connected cerebrocortical neurons support high-dimensional representations that enhance the ability of readout neurons to learn associations (Hansel and van Vreeswijk, 2012Hansel D. van Vreeswijk C.

Sparseness and expansion in sensory representations.Neuron. 2014; 83: 1213-1226Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), much as in theories of cerebellar cortex. Although these studies support the idea of random, high-dimensional representations as substrates for associative learning, they do not explain why the degree of synaptic connectivity in granule-cell and cerebrocortical layers is so different. To address this issue, we explore the effects of degree of connectivity, balance of excitation and inhibition, and synaptic weight distribution on the ability of a large neural representation to support associative learning. We also investigate whether synaptic plasticity of input connections (e.g., mossy fiber to granule cell), augmenting plasticity of output connections (e.g., granule cell to Purkinje cell, as in Marr-Albus theories), improves performance. In these analyses, we distinguish between unsupervised synaptic plasticity that normalizes or otherwise modulates the gain of synaptic input without the aid of a feedback (“error”) signal and supervised synaptic plasticity that exploits feedback signals to reshape the neural representation based on prior experience. Using a combination of analytic calculation and computer simulation, we find that the number of connections per neuron required to produce a high-dimensional representation increases slowly with the number of neurons. For a wide range of conditions (but not all), dimension and learning performance are maximized if the number of inputs is small. These results apply when the input synapses onto the granule or granule-like cells are selected randomly or approximately randomly and are not modified by a supervised learning procedure. In contrast, if we permit supervised modification of these synapses during the learning of a task, dense connectivity becomes advantageous. Our theory predicts a degree of connectivity that maximizes dimension for cerebellum-like structures and quantitatively matches what is observed for cerebellar granule cells and Kenyon cells of the Drosophila mushroom body. It also predicts that supervised synaptic plasticity at multiple stages of processing is necessary to exploit the dense connectivity of cerebral cortex. The “granule-cell” layer we consider consists of M neurons that each receive K excitatory connections from a random subset of N input channels and feedforward inhibition via a globally connected inhibitory neuron (Figure 1A ). We assume that, as in the cerebellum and its analogs, M>N. We refer to K as the synaptic degree. Because the neurons in the second layer are selective to combinations of their inputs, we refer to the two layers as the input (e.g., mossy-fiber) and mixed (e.g., granule-cell) layers, respectively. The ratio of the number of mixed-layer neurons to inputs, M/N, which we call the expansion ratio, is a critical parameter for our study. Our analysis assumes that the input channels are independent, so multiple channels with redundant activity are classified as a single input. This means that, for the Drosophila mushroom body, the number of distinct inputs is N = 50, an estimate of the number of antennal lobe glomeruli, while the estimated number of Kenyon cells is M = 2,000 (Keene and Waddell, 2007Keene A.C. Waddell S. Drosophila olfactory memory: single genes to complex neural circuits.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2007; 8: 341-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar), yielding an expansion ratio of 40 (Figure 1B). For the cerebellum, the number of mossy fibers and granule cells presynaptic to a single Purkinje cell in the rat are estimated to be N = 7,000 and M = 209,000 (Marr, 1969Marr D. A theory of cerebellar cortex.J. Physiol. 1969; 202: 437-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (2187) Google Scholar, Harvey and Napper, 1991Harvey R.J. Napper R.M. Quantitative studies on the mammalian cerebellum.Prog. Neurobiol. 1991; 36: 437-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, Tyrrell and Willshaw, 1992Tyrrell T. Willshaw D. Cerebellar cortex: its simulation and the relevance of Marr’s theory.Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 1992; 336: 239-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar; see STAR Methods), meaning the expansion ratio in this case is 30 if the mossy fibers are assumed to be independent (Figure 1C). A necessary requirement to produce a high-dimensional representation in the mixed layer is that its neurons should respond to different ensembles of inputs. To understand what is needed to produce this response heterogeneity, we first ask the simple question: what values of K ensure that, with high probability, each mixed-layer neuron receives a distinct subset of inputs? This question is a variant of the “birthday problem,” which concerns the likelihood of M people being born on unique days of the year. More generally, one can ask: what is the probability p of M draws (with replacement) from R equally likely possibilities all being different? In our case, the number of possibilities is R=N choose K, the number of ways a mixed-layer neuron can choose K presynaptic partners from N inputs. The maximum value of this probability is always at K=N/2, but this maximum typically lies in the middle of a large range of K for which p is extremely close to 1. We therefore denote by K∗ the smallest value of K for which p attains at least 95% of its maximum. The level of 95% is, of course, arbitrary, but the value of K∗ typically changes very little, if at all, if p is varied over a reasonable range near 100% (see below). Using numbers appropriate for the mushroom body, N = 50 and M = 2,000, leads to K∗ = 7, equal to the average observed number of projection-neuron inputs received by Kenyon cells (Caron et al., 2013Caron S.J.C. Ruta V. Abbott L.F. Axel R. Random convergence of olfactory inputs in the Drosophila mushroom body.Nature. 2013; 497: 113-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar; p takes the values 0.88, 0.98, and 0.996 for K = 6, 7, and 8). Using the same criterion for the cerebellum (N = 7,000 and M = 209,000) leads to K∗=4, equal to the typical number observed anatomically (Eccles et al., 1966Eccles J.C. Llinás R. Sasaki K. The mossy fibre-granule cell relay of the cerebellum and its inhibitory control by Golgi cells.Exp. Brain Res. 1966; 1: 82-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar; p takes values of 0.69, 0.9998, and greater than 0.9999 for K = 3, 4, and 5). That a small number of connections is sufficient to ensure each mixed-layer neuron receives a unique set of inputs owes to the rapid growth of N choose K with K. In other words, the combinatorial explosion in the number of possible wirings with synaptic degree permits even very sparsely connected systems to eliminate duplication in the mixed layer with high probability. The combinatorial calculation in the previous section treated two mixed-layer neurons as distinct even if only one of their inputs differed, but partially overlapping inputs may introduce correlations between neural responses that reduce the quality of the mixed-layer representation. To provide a more nuanced analysis, we define and calculate a quantitative measure that characterizes the mixed-layer representation: its dimension. We define the dimension of a system with M degrees of freedom, x=(x1,x2,…xM), asdim(x)=(∑i=1Mλi)2∑i=1Mλi2,(Equation 1) where λi are the eigenvalues of the covariance matrix of x computed by averaging over the distribution of inputs to the system (Abbott et al., 2011Abbott L.F. Rajan K. Sompolinsky H. Interactions between intrinsic and stimulus-evoked activity in recurrent neural networks.in: Ding M. Glanzman D.L. The Dynamic Brain: An Exploration of Neuronal Variability and Its Functional Significance. Oxford University Press, 2011: 65-82Crossref Scopus (41) Google Scholar). If the components of x are independent and have the same variance, all the eigenvalues are equal and dim(x)=M. Conversely, if the components are correlated so that the data points are distributed equally in each dimension of an m-dimensional subspace of the full M-dimensional space, only m eigenvalues will be nonzero and dim(x)=m (Figure 2A ). Later, we will show that this measure is closely related to the classification performance of a readout of mixed-layer responses. Increased dimension of the mixed-layer representation requires, in addition to mixing of the inputs received by each neuron, a nonlinearity provided by their input-output response function. We begin by analyzing the effect of input mixing alone and then address the effect of nonlinearity for the case of purely excitatory input (later we will add inhibition). In studying the effect of mixing alone, the components of the vector we consider, which we call h, are the total synaptic currents received by each of the mixed-layer neurons. These currents are given by h=Js, where J is the M×N matrix of synaptic weights describing the strengths of the connections from the input layer to the mixed layer and s is the vector of activities for the input layer. We consider the case of uncorrelated inputs with a uniform variance across them. If the excitatory connections onto the mixed-layer neurons have homogeneous weights,dim(h)≈N1+N/M+(K−1)2/N,(Equation 2) when M and N are large. Two features of this result are noteworthy. First, dim(h)≤N even when M≫N (Figure 2B, light curve). This is because h is a linear function of the activity of the input layer s, so it cannot have dimension higher than N. Second, increasing the synaptic degree K reduces the dimension (Figure 2C, light curve). This is due to the final term in the denominator, which arises from correlations between the entries of h. On average, two mixed-layer neurons share K2/N of their K inputs, leading to an average correlation of K/N. Indeed, as K approaches N, all the currents received by mixed-layer neurons become identical, and dim(h) approaches 1. Thus, unlike the combinatorial calculation of the previous section, this analysis indicates that increasing K beyond 1 is detrimental because it reduces the dimension due to increased correlations even when the identities of the inputs to each neuron are different. However, our real interest is the dimension of the nonlinear output of the mixed layer. We consider mixed-layer neurons with binary outputs given by m=Θ(h−θ), where Θ is a step function (applied element-wise) and θ is a vector of activity thresholds, one for each neuron. The thresholds are chosen so that each neuron is active with probability f, averaged across all the input patterns which, for now, we take to be standard Gaussians (we refer to the input-layer response to a particular stimulus as an input pattern). We call f the coding level of the mixed layer. Under these assumptions, the mixed-layer dimension is given bydim(m)≈11M+〈ρij〉2+Var(ρij),(Equation 3) where ρij is the correlation coefficient of the activities mi and mj of neurons i and j averaged over the distribution of input patterns (a more general expression holds when the coding levels of the neurons are not identical; see STAR Methods). Thus, the maximum mixed-layer dimension is limited by correlations among its neurons and saturates to a limiting value as the expansion ratio grows (Equation 3; Figure 2B, dark curve; also see Babadi and Sompolinsky, 2014Babadi B. Sompolinsky H. Sparseness and expansion in sensory representations.Neuron. 2014; 83: 1213-1226Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). The limiting value scales linearly with N (since Var(ρij)∼1/N; Figure S1). For a coding level of f=0.1, the saturation suggests that expansion ratios beyond 10–50 do not increase the mixed-layer dimension. This maximum expansion ratio and the maximum dimension both increase as the coding level is reduced (Figure S1), but as we will see, representations with extremely low coding levels do not necessarily lead to improved discrimination (Barak et al., 2013Barak O. Rigotti M. Fusi S. The sparseness of mixed selectivity neurons controls the generalization-discrimination trade-off.J. Neurosci. 2013; 33: 3844-3856Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, Babadi and Sompolinsky, 2014Babadi B. Sompolinsky H. Sparseness and expansion in sensory representations.Neuron. 2014; 83: 1213-1226Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). We next investigate the dependence of mixed-layer dimension on K. When M is small, the mixed-layer dimension is similar to the input-current dimension and nearly constant over a wide range of K values (Figure 2C, top). However, for larger M, dimension initially grows with K, as increased K results in each mixed-layer neuron being selective to different combinations of inputs (Figure 2C, middle and bottom). The dimension is maximized for an intermediate value of K that depends on N, f, and the distribution of synaptic weights. For the case of homogeneous excitatory synaptic weights, this value is K=9 for N=1,000 and f=0.1. Above this value, dimension decreases because of positive average correlations among the mixed-layer neurons (Figure 2C; Figure S1). Thus, the detrimental effect of even small average correlations (〈ρij〉 in the denominator of Equation 3) on dimension leads to dimension being maximized at small K. Many studies have shown that inhibition can decorrelate neural activity (Ecker et al., 2010Ecker A.S. Berens P. Keliris G.A. Bethge M. Logothetis N.K. Tolias A.S. Decorrelated neuronal firing in cortical microcircuits.Science. 2010; 327: 584-587Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar, Renart et al., 2010Renart A. de la Rocha J. Bartho P. Hollender L.

Riecke H. Friedrich R.W. Mechanisms of pattern decorrelation by recurrent neuronal circuits.Nat. Neurosci. 2010; 13: 1003-1010Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), so we next investigate whether inhibition can increase dimension by reducing correlations among mixed-layer neurons. In the Drosophila mushroom body, a single GABAergic interneuron on each side of the brain inhibits the Kenyon-cell population globally (Liu and Davis, 2009Liu X. Davis R.L. The GABAergic anterior paired lateral neuron suppresses and is suppressed by olfactory learning.Nat. Neurosci. 2009; 12: 53-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar; Figure 1B). In the cerebellum, Golgi cells are vastly outnumbered by the granule cells they inhibit (Eccles et al., 1966Eccles J.C. Llinás R. Sasaki K. The mossy fibre-granule cell relay of the cerebellum and its inhibitory control by Golgi cells.Exp. Brain Res. 1966; 1: 82-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar; Figure 1C). We therefore begin by introducing a single neuron that inhibits all mixed-layer neurons in proportion to its input, which is equal to the summed input-layer activity (Figure 1A). When inhibition is tuned to balance excitation on average (see STAR Methods), the distribution of the correlation between inputs received by pairs of mixed-layer neurons has zero mean, although the variance remains finite (Figure S1). Consequently, dim(h) does not decrease with K, and dim(m) does not exhibit a peak at small K (Figure 2D). However, even in this case, dimension quickly approaches its maximum (which occurs at K=N/2), and when N=1,000 and the expansion ratio is large, it attains 95% of its maximum value at K=29, or approximately 3% connectivity. Furthermore, the increase in dimension due to inhibition is only substantial for sufficiently large K. Thus, nonlinear mixed-layer neurons with small synaptic degree are sufficient to produce high-dimensional representations. This observation is consistent with the combinatorial argument of the first section, which showed that the explosion in possible wirings with synaptic degree leads to few redundant mixed-layer neurons, even when the degree is small. The present analysis also shows that positive average correlations limit dimension when mixed-layer neurons receive purely excitatory input, and that when K is large global inhibition can increase dimension through decorrelation. Although our analytic calculations are most easily performed for systems with feedforward inhibition, we verified with simulations that our qualitative results also hold for sufficiently strong recurrent inhibition (Figure S2). The observations of the previous section suggest that a representation formed by many neurons with small synaptic degree may be higher dimensional than one formed by fewer neurons with large synaptic degree. Therefore, when constructing a randomly wired neural system with limited resources, the former strategy may be preferable. To formalize this intuition, we ask: what combination of mixed-layer neuron number M and synaptic degree K maximizes the dimension of the mixed-layer representation when the total number of connections S=MK is limited to some maximum value?

https://openalex.org/W2590321928,"Most autoimmune-disease-risk effects identified by genome-wide association studies (GWAS) localize to open chromatin with gene-regulatory activity. GWAS loci are also enriched in expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs), thus suggesting that most risk variants alter gene expression. However, because causal variants are difficult to identify, and cis-eQTLs occur frequently, it remains challenging to identify specific instances of disease-relevant changes to gene regulation. Here, we used a novel joint likelihood framework with higher resolution than that of previous methods to identify loci where autoimmune-disease risk and an eQTL are driven by a single shared genetic effect. Using eQTLs from three major immune subpopulations, we found shared effects in only ∼25% of the loci examined. Thus, we show that a fraction of gene-regulatory changes suggest strong mechanistic hypotheses for disease risk, but we conclude that most risk mechanisms are not likely to involve changes in basal gene expression."
https://openalex.org/W2589623897,"Metastases remain the major cause of death from cancer. Recent molecular advances have highlighted the importance of metabolic alterations in cancer cells, including the Warburg effect that describes an increased glycolysis in cancer cells. However, how this altered metabolism contributes to tumour metastasis remains elusive. Here, we report that phosphorylation-induced activation of lactate dehydrogenase A (LDHA), an enzyme that catalyses the interconversion of pyruvate and lactate, promotes cancer cell invasion, anoikis resistance and tumour metastasis. We demonstrate that LDHA is phosphorylated at tyrosine 10 by upstream kinases, HER2 and Src. Targeting HER2 or Src attenuated LDH activity as well as invasive potential in head and neck cancer and breast cancer cells. Inhibition of LDH activity by small hairpin ribonucleic acid or expression of phospho-deficient LDHA Y10F sensitized the cancer cells to anoikis induction and resulted in attenuated cell invasion and elevated reactive oxygen species, whereas such phenotypes were reversed by its product lactate or antioxidant N-acetylcysteine, suggesting that Y10 phosphorylation-mediated LDHA activity promotes cancer cell invasion and anoikis resistance through redox homeostasis. In addition, LDHA knockdown or LDHA Y10F rescue expression in human cancer cells resulted in decreased tumour metastasis in xenograft mice. Furthermore, LDHA phosphorylation at Y10 positively correlated with progression of metastatic breast cancer in clinical patient tumour samples. Our findings demonstrate that LDHA phosphorylation and activation provide pro-invasive, anti-anoikis and pro-metastatic advantages to cancer cells, suggesting that Y10 phosphorylation of LDHA may represent a promising therapeutic target and a prognostic marker for metastatic human cancers."
https://openalex.org/W2587989857,"DNMT3A mutations occur in ∼25% of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients. The most common mutation, DNMT3AR882H, has dominant negative activity that reduces DNA methylation activity by ∼80% in vitro. To understand the contribution of DNMT3A-dependent methylation to leukemogenesis, we performed whole-genome bisulfite sequencing of primary leukemic and non-leukemic cells in patients with or without DNMT3AR882 mutations. Non-leukemic hematopoietic cells with DNMT3AR882H displayed focal methylation loss, suggesting that hypomethylation antedates AML. Although virtually all AMLs with wild-type DNMT3A displayed CpG island hypermethylation, this change was not associated with gene silencing and was essentially absent in AMLs with DNMT3AR882 mutations. Primary hematopoietic stem cells expanded with cytokines were hypermethylated in a DNMT3A-dependent manner, suggesting that hypermethylation may be a response to, rather than a cause of, cellular proliferation. Our findings suggest that hypomethylation is an initiating phenotype in AMLs with DNMT3AR882, while DNMT3A-dependent CpG island hypermethylation is a consequence of AML progression."

Upon UV irradiation, a slowdown of transcript elongation and restriction of gene activity to the promoter-proximal ∼25 kb is observed. This is associated with a shift from expression of long mRNAs to shorter isoforms, incorporating alternative last exons (ALEs) that are more proximal to the transcription start site. Notably, this includes a shift from a protein-coding ASCC3 mRNA to a shorter ALE isoform of which the RNA, rather than an encoded protein, is critical for the eventual recovery of transcription. The non-coding ASCC3 isoform counteracts the function of the protein-coding isoform, indicating crosstalk between them. Thus, the ASCC3 gene expresses both coding and non-coding transcript isoforms with opposite effects on transcription recovery after UV-induced DNA damage.

The efficient production and correct processing of nascent RNA polymerase II transcripts is essential for life. Factors that affect transcription and mRNA splicing, including DNA damaging agents, can thus have a dramatic effect on gene expression and cell viability. Indeed, bulky DNA lesions such as those generated by UV irradiation trigger rapid shutdown of RNA synthesis (Mayne and Lehmann, 1982Mayne L.V. Lehmann A.R.

The vast majority of RNAPII genes have the potential to be expressed as multiple mRNA isoforms, creating vast regulatory potential (Pan et al., 2008Pan Q. Shai O. Lee L.J. Frey B.J. Blencowe B.J.

Indeed, changes in alternative isoform expression can regulate the physiological response of cells to stress or other signals. Importantly, processing of nascent pre-mRNA occurs co-transcriptionally, so that mRNA capping, splicing, and 3′ end formation are greatly influenced by the dynamics of elongation (de la Mata et al., 2003de la Mata M.

RNA polymerase II kinetics in polo polyadenylation signal selection.EMBO J. 2011; 30: 2431-2444Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). To better understand the effect of UV irradiation on gene expression, we examined nascent transcription and transcript isoform expression on a genome-wide level. We hereby uncovered evidence that UV-induced alternative last exon (ALE) splicing is important for the DNA damage response, with long and short ASCC3 ALE isoforms having opposite effects on transcription recovery after DNA damage. We also show that the short ASCC3 isoform regulates transcription recovery in a manner that is dependent on the non-coding RNA rather than the encoded protein. To investigate the effect of UV irradiation on transcription genome-wide, we employed 5,6-dichloro-1-β-D-ribofuranosylbenzimidazole/global run-on sequencing (DRB/GRO-seq), which allows measurement of nascent RNA synthesis at a high temporal and spatial resolution (Saponaro et al., 2014Saponaro M. Kantidakis T. Mitter R. Kelly G.P. Heron M. Williams H. Söding J. Stewart A. Svejstrup J.Q. RECQL5 controls transcript elongation and suppresses genome instability associated with transcription stress.Cell. 2014; 157: 1037-1049Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Cells were first treated with the transcription elongation inhibitor DRB to restrict RNAPII to the promoter-proximal areas (first ∼600 bp of genes). Cells were then UV-irradiated, followed by inhibitor removal to allow synchronized transcription and its genome-wide measurement by GRO-seq (Figure 1A). Results from the PPP1R12A gene are shown as an example (Figure 1B). In untreated cells, RNAPII progressed ∼12 kb into the gene 10 min after DRB removal and to ∼38 kb and ∼74 kb after 25 and 40 min, respectively. These results mirror previously published data (Saponaro et al., 2014Saponaro M. Kantidakis T. Mitter R. Kelly G.P. Heron M. Williams H. Söding J. Stewart A. Svejstrup J.Q. RECQL5 controls transcript elongation and suppresses genome instability associated with transcription stress.Cell. 2014; 157: 1037-1049Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar), but were in striking contrast to those obtained when cells were UV-irradiated before DRB removal. Here, the position of the RNAPII “wave-front” was similar to that of untreated cells after 10 min. However, a dramatic reduction in RNAPII progress was observed 25 and 40 min after UV exposure, with the wave-fronts in the PPP1R12A gene moving only very slightly further forward, reaching ∼15 and ∼20 kb at these time points (Figure 1B). We note that little change was observed at the promoter at these times. DRB/GRO-seq only captures the activity of RNAPII molecules that incorporate 5-bromouridine-5′-triphosphate (Br-UTP) during the short run-on pulse (5 min). This suggests that initiation and transcript elongation in the promoter-proximal areas still occurred, while progress further into genes was very slow or prohibited. Meta-gene profiles of 8,148 transcripts revealed that UV irradiation generally attenuated elongation markedly, with nascent RNA wave-fronts reaching ∼75 kb after 40 min in untreated cells (Figure 1C, upper, black arrow), but only ∼25 kb after UV irradiation (Figure 1C, lower, orange arrow). To calculate the UV-induced reduction in elongation rates, the nascent RNA wave-front was called for a subset of very long transcripts (n = 333) (Figure 1D). In untreated conditions, the wave-front progressed to a median distance of 12.5 kb after 10 min and to 39 kb and 64.8 kb after 25 min and 40 min, respectively (Figure 1D, upper; indicated by dashed lines). This corresponds to average elongation rates of 1.77 kb/min (10–25 min) and 1.72 kb/min (25–40 min). In contrast, in UV-treated cells (Figure 1D, lower), the wave-fronts were at 10.3 kb (10 min), 17.3 kb (25 min), and 21.0 kb (40 min), respectively (Figure 1D, lower), giving rise to average elongation rates of only 0.47 kb/min (10–25 min) and 0.25 kb/min (25–40 min) (see also Figures S1A and S1B). Based on experiments that measured nascent RNA synthesis by general radioactive labeling (Mayne and Lehmann, 1982Mayne L.V. Lehmann A.R.

Cockayne syndrome B protein regulates the transcriptional program after UV irradiation.EMBO J. 2006; 25: 1915-1923Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar), transcription levels should recover to near-normal levels over an ∼24-hr period. To analyze transcription restart genome-wide, we therefore performed GRO-seq experiments with cells that were again UV-irradiated at 15 J/m2, followed by recovery (Figures 1E and S1C). This dose of UV did not lead to significant cell death over the 24-hr time course (data not shown). As expected, the distribution of active RNAPII in untreated cells was characterized by a large peak in the promoter-proximal region, followed by a marked reduction in signal further downstream (black graph). Transcription was not synchronized with DRB, so this density pattern represents the distribution of RNAPII expected for actively transcribed genes at steady state. In response to UV irradiation (2 hr time point), there was a clear reduction in the promoter-proximal peak (see arrowheads in Figure 1E), suggesting either a reduction in transcription initiation or increased promoter clearance (Ehrensberger et al., 2013Ehrensberger A.H. Kelly G.P. Svejstrup J.Q. Mechanistic interpretation of promoter-proximal peaks and RNAPII density maps.Cell. 2013; 154: 713-715Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the GRO-seq signal increased in the region up to ∼20 kb from the transcription start site (TSS) (Figure 1E, yellow shaded region), concomitant with depletion further downstream (Figures 1E, gray shaded region, and 1F). This suggests that while transcription initiation may be inhibited, considerable elongation activity is observed in the beginning of genes (possibly reflecting increased promoter release), and activity is dramatically reduced in regions further downstream. As expected, RNA synthesis gradually normalized to that observed in untreated cells over the 24-hr period, with eventual restoration of activity at the 3′ end of genes (Figures 1E and 1F). Interestingly, wave-front calling of a subset of very long genes indicated a rate of transcript elongation of only ∼40 bases/min on average from 2 to 12 hr following UV irradiation, more than 40-fold slower than in untreated cells (Figures S1D and S1E). Mathematically determined, median transcription “wave-fronts” independently confirmed these results (Figure S1F). Taken together, these data suggest that UV irradiation causes a rapid and dramatic reduction in transcript elongation, and even upon recovery of nascent RNA synthesis several hours after UV exposure, elongation continues to be much slower than in untreated cells. Most importantly, transcription is spatially restricted for long periods, with the promoter-proximal 20–25 kb showing much more activity than the areas further downstream. Considering the dramatic change in transcript elongation and knowing that mRNA processing is tightly coupled to elongation, we now investigated the effect of UV irradiation on mRNA splicing by next generation sequencing of cDNA libraries generated from mRNA. The relative expression of transcript isoforms was quantitatively measured using the mixture of isoform (MISO) model (Katz et al., 2010Katz Y. Wang E.T. Airoldi E.M. Burge C.B. Analysis and design of RNA sequencing experiments for identifying isoform regulation.Nat. Methods. 2010; 7: 1009-1015Crossref PubMed Scopus (887) Google Scholar). In total, we identified 435 splicing events in 298 genes that were affected either 8 or 24 hr after UV irradiation in both biological replicates (Figure 2A; Table S1). Previous reports uncovered examples of increased inclusion of cassette exons under conditions of attenuated elongation (de la Mata et al., 2003de la Mata M. Alonso C.R. Kadener S. Fededa J.P.

Pre-mRNA splicing is facilitated by an optimal RNA polymerase II elongation rate.Genes Dev. 2014; 28: 2663-2676Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Our analysis of 131 UV-induced exon skipping/inclusion events shows only a slight bias (63% of events) for increased exon inclusion after UV irradiation (data not shown). Interestingly, alternative last exon (ALE) splicing was the most frequent UV-induced event (Figure 2A; Table S2), accounting for more than a third of all those recorded: 156 ALE splicing events in 105 genes. ALE transcript isoforms are characterized by different 3′ terminal exons and therefore inherently have different poly-A sites. Importantly, a marked bias for expression of shorter transcript isoforms (induced ALE transcript isoforms that have terminal exons more proximal to the TSS) was observed following UV irradiation (Figure 2B), with 78% of ALE events (121 of 156) resulting in increased expression of such shorter isoforms (hereafter referred to as “ALE short” events). The majority of these (71/121) involved alternative splicing of unique terminal exons, indicating they were not solely a result of premature termination (Figure S2A). Only 35 events were characterized by increased expression of alternative longer isoforms, from 22 genes (Figure 2B, “ALE long” events). The relative exon expression of the isoforms for two genes, HERC4 and INTS6, is described in Figure 2C. The long HERC4 pre-mRNA isoform contains 25 exons and is 153 kb, while the short HERC4 pre-mRNA is 6.3 kb, shares the first three exons with the long isoform, but contains a fourth, unique terminal exon (Figure 2C, left, lower). Eight hours after UV irradiation, exons 1–4 (indicated by the red dashed boxes) were induced (Figure 2C, left). In contrast, expression of exons 5–26 (specific for the long isoform) was reduced, but recovered to near-normal levels after 24 hr. A similar pattern of alternative exon expression was seen at the INTS6 gene and a large number of other genes (Figure 2C, right, and data not shown). qRT-PCR confirmed the increased expression of the short isoforms and concomitant lower expression of the long isoforms 8 hr after UV irradiation (Figure 2D). The short RNA isoforms of HERC4 and INTS6 were much shorter than their long isoforms. More generally, the median length of the UV-suppressed long pre-mRNA isoforms was ∼109 kb, considerably longer than that of all human genes (23 kb), whereas that of the UV-induced short isoforms was only ∼32 kb. This reduction in pre-mRNA length for UV-induced ALE short events was significantly greater than expected by chance (Figure S2B), indicating a general trend for switching from particularly long isoforms to much shorter isoforms upon UV exposure. In contrast, the median length of the less common UV-induced long ALE isoforms was ∼30 kb, only 9 kb longer than the median length of their corresponding, UV-suppressed short isoform (Figure 2E). Because transcript elongation was attenuated after UV irradiation (Figure 1), we hypothesized that the UV-induced ALE short events resulted from preferential synthesis of the pre-mRNA producing them. Indeed, after UV-irradiation, GRO-seq read depth at HERC4 increased over the region coding for the short isoform (Figure 2F, inset), whereas synthesis in the rest of the gene was markedly suppressed. Nascent RNA synthesis across the entire gene recovered to untreated levels 24 hr after UV exposure, correlating with the kinetics of the HERC4 ALE splicing event. Consistent with a causative effect, the GRO-seq signal corresponding to the long isoform also remained suppressed at 24 hr for a gene in which preferential expression of the short isoform was detected not only at 8 but also 24 hr after UV irradiation (Figure S2C). By comparing GRO-seq signals across proximal and distal terminal exons, a general, transient increase in the ratio of short to long transcript isoform expression was observed, peaking 8–12 hr after UV (Figure 2G). This increase correlated with a greater reduction in the synthesis of distal than of proximal exons and was specific for UV-induced ALE events (Figures S2D–S2F). Together, the results presented so far indicate that UV irradiation results in a dramatic change in transcription, with elongation slowing down and RNAPII-mediated RNA synthesis being “restricted” to the 5′ end of genes. This gene-spatial restriction of transcription is associated with, or indeed causes, the preferential expression of short transcript isoforms incorporating alternative last exons. We now investigated whether the preferential expression of short ALE isoforms in response to UV irradiation is physiologically important. Gene ontology analysis of the 84 genes that undergo UV-induced ALE short isoform switching revealed that many of them are involved in transcription (Figure S3). We also cross-referenced the genes with a recently compiled database of factors that function in the transcription-related DNA damage response (Boeing et al., 2016Boeing S. Williamson L. Encheva V. Gori I. Saunders R.E. Instrell R. Aygün O. Rodriguez-Martinez M. Weems J.C. Kelly G.P. et al.Multiomic analysis of the UV-induced DNA damage response.Cell Rep. 2016; 15: 1597-1610Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Interestingly, genes with short ALE events were enriched among the highest scoring genes in this database (p = 0.0077; Kolmogorov-Smirnoff test), with 28 of the 84 genes being among the 15% highest scorers (Table S3). Among these factors, ASCC3 stood out: it had the highest score in the multi-omic screening approach (Boeing et al., 2016Boeing S. Williamson L. Encheva V. Gori I. Saunders R.E. Instrell R. Aygün O. Rodriguez-Martinez M. Weems J.C. Kelly G.P. et al.Multiomic analysis of the UV-induced DNA damage response.Cell Rep. 2016; 15: 1597-1610Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). The pre-mRNA giving rise to the long ASCC3 isoform is 373.5 kb and composed of 42 exons (Figure 3A). The short ASCC3 isoform is 25 kb in length and shares the first three exons with the long isoform, followed by a unique terminal exon (Figure 3A, last exon indicated by the red arrows). Exon expression for both isoforms was reduced 8 hr after UV treatment. However, 24 hr after UV treatment, expression of the exons of the short isoform increased while those specific for the long isoform remained repressed (Figure 3A). This result was confirmed by qRT-PCR (Figure 3B). Expression of the long isoform recovered by 48 hr after UV treatment. Exposure of cells to cisplatin and camptothecin, but not MMS or ionizing radiation, also resulted in preferential expression of the short ASCC3 isoform, indicating that this is a general response to agents inducing bulky DNA lesions (Figure 3C). Similar to what was observed for HERC4, INTS6, and other genes, the increase in the short ASCC3 isoform was likely caused by the restriction of nascent RNA synthesis to the beginning of genes after UV irradiation (Figure 3D). Indeed, recovery of nascent RNA synthesis was only observed over the first half of ASCC3 24 hr after UV treatment. More importantly, however, RNA synthesis across the relevant first 25 kb of the ASCC3 gene was induced at 24 hr (Figure 3D, inset; see also 3E). The transcription characteristics at ASCC3 thus again correlated with ALE switching and preferential production of the short ASCC3 isoform after UV irradiation. As expected from the results above, nascent RNA synthesis rapidly decreased after UV exposure as indicated by significantly reduced incorporation of ethynyluridine (EU) into nascent RNA, followed by a slow recovery (Figure S4A). In the multi-omic screening approach, we screened for nascent transcription using the EU incorporation assay to identify genes whose small interfering RNA (siRNA) knockdown affect transcription 20 hr after UV irradiation (Boeing et al., 2016Boeing S.

Intriguingly, two distinct siRNA pools targeting ASCC3 scored in this screen; one resulted in high transcription while the other resulted in low transcription levels after UV irradiation.

Our study therefore provides insight into the cellular events demarcating the initiation and progression of myeloid transformation and a new platform for testing genetic and pharmacological interventions. Human hematopoiesis is sustained by hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) residing in the bone marrow (BM) through processes involving self-renewal, proliferation, and differentiation to distinct cell lineages ultimately giving rise to mature functional hematopoietic cells. Deregulation of these processes is believed to be central to the pathogenesis of hematopoietic disorders, which are typically grouped according to the two main blood lineages into myeloid and lymphoid, with the former generally classified as myeloproliferative disorders (MPDs), myelodysplastic syndromes (MDSs), syndromes with overlap of the two former categories (MDSs/MPDs), and the most dramatic, acute myeloid leukemia (AML). AML can develop de novo or from preexisting MPD or MDS. While the development of de novo AML from preleukemic hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and its progression from MPDs (mainly chronic myeloid leukemia [CML]) are better studied, the development of AML from MDS has not been well mapped due to the more limited biological models of MDS and the scarcity and poor growth of primary MDS cells, as opposed to cells from MPD and AML patients (Sperling et al., 2017Sperling A.S. Gibson C.J. Ebert B.L. The genetics of myelodysplastic syndrome: from clonal haematopoiesis to secondary leukaemia.Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2017; 17: 5-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). Leukemogenesis has long been conceptualized as a multistep process. All current evidence points to a model whereby MDS and AML arise from HSPCs through the accumulation of multiple genetic (and potentially also epigenetic) changes (Elias et al., 2014Elias H.K. Schinke C. Bhattacharyya S. Will B. Verma A. Steidl U. Stem cell origin of myelodysplastic syndromes.Oncogene. 2014; 33: 5139-5150Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). In recent years, deep characterization of the mutational landscape of myeloid disorders through large-scale DNA sequencing solidified a model of clonal evolution through the stepwise accumulation of mutations. Clonal tracking at high resolution enabled by the identification of tens of recurrent gene mutations in MDS and AML has provided important insights into the nature and clonality status of myeloid disorders. First, it is now clear that clonal hematopoiesis is invariably established at the outset of MDS, and thus MDS is a preleukemic condition not fundamentally very different from AML (Papaemmanuil et al., 2013Papaemmanuil E. Gerstung M. Malcovati L. Tauro S. Gundem G. Van Loo P. Yoon C.J. Ellis P. Wedge D.C.

Second, clonal hematopoiesis (termed clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential [CHIP]) is found in healthy individuals with an age-dependent frequency and is associated with an increased risk of developing MDS, MPD, or AML (Genovese et al., 2014Genovese G. Kähler A.K. Handsaker R.E. Lindberg J. Rose S.A. Bakhoum S.F. Chambert K. Mick E. Neale B.M. Fromer M. et al.Clonal hematopoiesis and blood-cancer risk inferred from blood DNA sequence.N. Engl. J.

Med. 2014; 20: 1472-1478Crossref PubMed Scopus (1203) Google Scholar). This finding, in parallel with recent functional in vitro and in vivo studies, lends support to the existence of preleukemic HSCs that are functionally normal and have multilineage potential but harbor MDS- and AML-related mutations that may give them a clonal advantage (Jan et al., 2012Jan M. Snyder T.M. Corces-Zimmerman M.R. Vyas P. Weissman I.L. Quake S.R. Majeti R. Clonal evolution of preleukemic hematopoietic stem cells precedes human acute myeloid leukemia.Sci. Transl.

These recent findings invite revisiting the boundaries among normal, premalignant, and malignant hematopoiesis and support an emerging view of myeloid malignancy as a disease spectrum comprising hematopoietic disorders that extend across a phenotypic continuum, ranging from normal hematopoiesis to clonal hematopoiesis or preleukemia to MDS and MDS/AML (Pandolfi et al., 2013Pandolfi A.

However, the cellular events demarcating progression to overt leukemia through a premalignant myelodysplastic phase are not well defined. Here, we generated patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) representative of a range of disease stages across the spectrum of myeloid malignancy, including familial predisposition, low-risk MDS, high-risk MDS, and MDS/AML. We characterized the hematopoiesis derived from this panel of iPSC lines and identified phenotypes of graded severity and/or stage specificity, which together delineate a phenotypic roadmap of disease progression, leading to the most dramatic phenotype of a serially transplantable leukemia. As proof of principle that transitions between stages (progression or reversal) can be modeled in our system, we show that a high-risk MDS-iPSC line can be phenotypically reverted to a premalignant state by correction of a chr7q deletion, whereas a preleukemic iPSC line can progress to either low-risk or high-risk MDS following CRISPR/Cas9-mediated inactivation of the second GATA2 allele or deletion of chr7q, respectively. We also model the stepwise progression of normal cells to preleukemia and subsequent MDS through the sequential introduction of genetic lesions associated with earlier (ASXL1 truncation) and later (chr7q deletion) disease stages. We then use this model to uncover disease-stage-specific therapeutic effects of 5-AzaC, a drug used as first-line therapy in MDS and whose mechanism of action remains elusive, and rigosertib, a small-molecule inhibitor of RAS signaling. Our study provides insights into the pathophysiologic changes underlying the initiation and progression of myeloid transformation and a new platform to test genetic and pharmacologic interventions to reverse this process. We derived iPSC lines from four patients (patients 1–4) with low-risk MDS (refractory anemia [RA] by French-American-British classification [FAB]), high-risk MDS (refractory anemia with excess blasts [RAEB] by FAB) and secondary AML (sAML or MDS/AML, i.e., AML from preexisting MDS) (Figure 1; Table S1). For reprogramming, we used BM or peripheral blood (PB) mononuclear cells (BMMCs or PBMCs) (Table S1) and reasoned that it might be possible, taking advantage of the genetic and clonal heterogeneity of these cell populations, to derive iPSC lines from normal cells, cells of the major clone, as well as cells from minor subclones. We therefore performed a thorough genetic characterization (karyotype, fluorescence in situ hybridization [FISH], array comparative genomic hybridization [aCGH], and gene mutation analysis) to identify all known recurrent gene mutations and chromosomal abnormalities associated with myeloid neoplasms in the starting cells and the derivative iPSCs and used it to determine the provenance of each iPSC line (Figure 1). Thus, we were able to establish a variety of iPSC lines, which included: (1) iPSC lines derived from the dominant clone (i.e., harboring only genetic lesions present in the majority of the starting cells); (2) iPSC lines derived from sub-clones (i.e., harboring at least one genetic lesion present in a subset of the starting cells): AML-4.10, harboring a sub-clonal KRAS G12D mutation, and a second line harboring a sub-clonal NRAS Q61R mutation that could only be partially reprogrammed (Table S1); (3) iPSC lines derived from normal hematopoietic cells (i.e., harboring none of the somatic genetic lesions found in the starting cells); and (4) one iPSC line, N-3.10, derived from patient 3, harboring a germline GATA2 T357N mutation predisposing to MDS/AML (Collin et al., 2015Collin M. Dickinson R. Bigley V. Haematopoietic and immune defects associated with GATA2 mutation.Br. J. Haematol. 2015; 169: 173-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, Hahn et al., 2011Hahn C.N.

Genet. 2011; 43: 1012-1017Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar) (Table S1). The MDS clone in this patient had acquired an additional somatic mutation in the other GATA2 allele (GATA2 390delK) (Figure S1A), together with additional mutations and a t(1;7)(q10;p10) translocation, resulting in del(7q), a deletion commonly associated with germline GATA2 mutations (Figure 1) (Wlodarski et al., 2016Wlodarski M.W. Hirabayashi S. Pastor V. Starý J. Hasle H. Masetti R. Dworzak M. Schmugge M. van den Heuvel-Eibrink M. Ussowicz M. et al.EWOG-MDSPrevalence, clinical characteristics, and prognosis of GATA2-related myelodysplastic syndromes in children and adolescents.Blood. 2016; 127 (quiz 1518): 1387-1397Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). All iPSC lines met all criteria of pluripotency for human cells (Figure S2). Reprogramming MDS and AML hematopoietic cells from BM or PB thus allows the derivation of iPSC lines capturing different disease stages, residual normal cells, and cells with predisposing mutations. These reprogramming experiments, together with the genetic characterization of the original cells and derivative iPSCs, allowed us to make several additional observations. First, detailed genetic analysis can pinpoint iPSC lines that originate from the same starting cell and are thus not truly different lines. iPSC lines MDS-3.4 and MDS-3.5 were found to both harbor the same MYB L51fs mutation, which was not detectable in the starting population, in addition to the somatic genetic lesions found in the starting MDS cells (t(1;7)(q10;p10), GATA2 T357N, GATA2 390delK, U2AF1 Q157R, ETV6 S321fs) (Figure 1). This strongly suggested that these lines originated from the same cell, which we confirmed by integration site analysis of the lentiviral vector used for reprogramming (Kotini et al., 2015Kotini A.G. Chang C.J. Boussaad I. Delrow J.J. Dolezal E.K. Nagulapally A.B. Perna F. Fishbein G.A. Klimek V.M. Hawkins R.D. et al.Functional analysis of a chromosomal deletion associated with myelodysplastic syndromes using isogenic human induced pluripotent stem cells.Nat. Biotechnol. 2015; 33: 646-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Second, since our experiments entailed the parallel reprogramming of a mixed population of cells together with the ability to exclude lines that were not clonally independent (Figure S2D), we had a unique opportunity to directly compare the reprogramming efficiency of cells harboring malignancy-associated genetic lesions to that of normal cells of the same genetic background and determine how specific genetic lesions associated with myeloid malignancy may affect reprogramming efficiency. While we were able to readily reprogram del(7q)-MDS cells, as we have previously reported (Kotini et al., 2015Kotini A.G. Chang C.J. Boussaad I. Delrow J.J. Dolezal E.K. Nagulapally A.B. Perna F. Fishbein G.A. Klimek V.M. Hawkins R.D. et al.Functional analysis of a chromosomal deletion associated with myelodysplastic syndromes using isogenic human induced pluripotent stem cells.Nat. Biotechnol. 2015; 33: 646-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar), we were not able to reprogram cells from patients with del(5q)-MDS or monosomy 7 (patients 5–8; Table S1). After at least two attempts for each patient and using different aliquots of starting cells, we were only able to derive either no iPSC lines (patient 5) or only normal iPSC lines, even though normal cells comprised only a minority of the starting population. Since in other reprogramming experiments MDS or AML cells did not have a general reprogramming disadvantage over normal cells (patients 1, 3, and 4; Table S1), this bias is most likely determined by the specific genetic composition of the malignant clone in each patient. In agreement with this, reprogramming of patient 2 cells, in more than one independent reprogramming experiment, gave consistently more normal than MDS iPSCs (only 2 out of 17 iPSC lines were derived from the MDS cells, with the remaining 15 derived from normal cells), whereas the del(7q) was present in over 70% of the starting cells (Table S1). To further investigate this and to determine whether the in vitro culture that is necessary to initiate reprogramming or the reprogramming process per se accounts for this skewing, we compared the clonal composition of cells from patient 2 before (day 0) and after in vitro culture (day 3) (Figures S1B and S1C). This showed that in vitro culture did not select for normal cells but rather resulted in preferential growth of the MDS clone over the normal cells, since the variant allele frequency (VAF) of both SRSF2 P95L and PHF6 C280Y clonal somatic mutations increased over time in culture. Similarly, cells from patients 7 and 8 analyzed for the del(5q) abnormality after culture and immediately before the initiation of reprogramming were found to consist mostly of clonal MDS cells, as the copy number of chr5q was almost 1 in both samples and 8 out of 10 metaphases of patient 7 cells harbored the del5q by karyotyping (Figures S1D and S1E). Finally, we compared the outcome of two different reprogramming protocols using in vitro expansion and reprogramming of either hematopoietic progenitors or erythroblasts, performed in parallel with the same aliquot of starting cells divided in two (Table S2). Erythroblast reprogramming, similarly to hematopoietic progenitor reprogramming, preferentially gave rise to normal iPSCs. These results show that the relative reprogramming disadvantage of MDS cells from some patients is not due to in vitro culture and suggest that some MDS-associated genetic lesions, but not others, exert a negative effect on or even completely abolish reprogramming potential. We selected a panel of iPSC lines representative of the different disease stages for phenotypic characterization following hematopoietic differentiation using a protocol that enables the derivation and study of hematopoiesis with definitive features (Figures 2A, S3A, and S3B). All lines gave rise to comparable percentages of CD34+ cells early in differentiation (day 8), providing evidence against early developmental defects in mesoderm formation or hematopoietic lineage specification that could compound the identification of disease-relevant phenotypes (Figures 2B and S3C). In contrast, striking differences were observed in the timing and emergence of CD45+ hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPCs) starting at the low-risk MDS stage (Figures 2C and S3D–S3F). Preleukemic cells, like normal cells, generated CD45+ HPCs that comprised ∼90% of the cells by day 14 of differentiation, with approximately half having lost CD34 expression, as a sign of further maturation beyond the progenitor stage (Figures 2C, S3E, and S3F). Low-risk MDS CD45+ HPCs appeared later and matured later than normal HPCs, as evidenced by loss of CD34 (Figures 2C, S3E, and S3F). High-risk MDS iPSCs produced CD45+ HPCs with a delay, as well as markedly reduced overall efficiency (in contrast to low-risk MDS) (Figures 2C and S3D–S3F). On the other hand, MDS/AML-iPSCs gave rise to CD45+ HPCs with efficiencies comparable to those of normal cells but failed to differentiate further and retained CD34 expression until day 18 and beyond (Figures 2C and S3D–S3F). Reciprocally, CD90 expression, normally lost by day 10–12 of differentiation, was retained by low-risk MDS, high-risk MDS, and MDS/AML cells in a stage-specific manner (Figures 2D, S3G, S4A, and S4B). We found that megakaryocyte progenitors with the CD41a+/CD45− surface phenotype that give rise to CFU-Mk colonies emerge in these cultures on or before day 8 in normal cells (Figures 2E–2G, S4B, and S4C). Strikingly, this population was severely decreased already in preleukemic cells and effectively abolished in MDS (Figures 2E, S4B, and S4C). While normal iPSCs gave rise to all types of hematopoietic colonies in methylcellulose cultures (Figures S5A and S5B), iPSCs from all disease stages exhibited reduced clonogenicity, with erythroid and multilineage colonies (burst-forming unit-erythrocyte [BFU-E] and colony-forming unit-granulocyte, erythrocyte, monocyte, megakaryocyte [CFU-GEMM]) primarily affected already in preleukemic and, more so, in low-risk MDS cells, while high-risk MDS generated very few or no colonies (Figures 3A and 3B ). MDS/AML cells gave rise exclusively to myeloid colonies composed mostly of immature cells (Figures 3A and 3B). Morphologic assessment of HPCs on day 14 of differentiation and of more mature cells from methylcellulose cultures revealed dysplastic changes, which were milder and restricted to the erythroid lineage in preleukemic and low-risk MDS and more widespread and affecting all lineages in high-risk MDS cells (Figures 3B and S5C). Finally, we measured the growth rate and viability of HPCs derived from the different disease stage iPSCs. Low-risk MDS showed a mild decrease in growth rate and viability, which was much more pronounced in high-risk MDS, whereas growth and viability of MDS/AML cells was completely restored to normal levels (Figures 3C, 3D, and S5D–S5F). To assess in vivo engraftment potential, we then transplanted day 8–16 HPCs derived from iPSCs of the various disease stages into NOD/SCID/IL-2Rγ−/− (NSG) mice (Figure 4A). As expected from many previous studies, HPCs derived from normal iPSCs showed no detectable engraftment (Vo and Daley, 2015Vo L.T. Daley G.Q. De novo generation of HSCs from somatic and pluripotent stem cell sources.Blood. 2015; 125: 2641-2648Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) (Figures 4B and 4C). Similarly, HPCs from MDS iPSCs (both low-risk and high-risk) did not exhibit engraftment potential (Figures 4B and 4C). In contrast, MDS/AML-HPCs showed high levels (up to 80%) of human engraftment in multiple animals (Figures 4B and 4C). The transplantable cells showed features of myeloid leukemia, including a predominantly myeloid immunophenotype and infiltration of the bone marrow and spleen by immature human CD45+ cells with blast-like morphology, also found in the peripheral blood, which could be transplanted into secondary recipients (Figures 4D–4H). The latter readily succumbed to an AML-like disease within 3 weeks of transplantation. In summary, our phenotypic analyses show that iPSCs derived from distinct disease stages across the myeloid malignancy spectrum capture hematopoietic phenotypes of graded severity and/or stage specificity that together delineate a phenotypic roadmap to myeloid transformation, ultimately leading to a fulminant serially transplantable myeloid leukemia (Figure 4I; Table S3). We performed RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) of sorted CD34+ cells from three normal lines (two iPSC lines and the H1 hESC line) and two low-risk MDS, three high-risk MDS, and three MDS/AML iPSC lines (Figures 5 and S6A). By examining the gene expression profile among the different disease stages, we found a clear clustering of samples according to disease status by principal-component analysis, with the first principal component separating normal from MDS and the second separating the AML from the MDS samples (Figure 5A). Differential expression analyses identified 472 upregulated and 329 downregulated, 868 upregulated and 284 downregulated, and 760 upregulated and 439 downregulated genes among AML versus normal, high-risk MDS versus normal, and low-risk MDS versus normal, respectively (log2FC > 3 or log2FC < −3 and adjusted P value < 0.05; Figure S6B). Hierarchical clustering of all lines based on these differentially expressed genes recapitulated progression from normal to MDS/AML (Figure 5B). Based on analysis of Gene Ontology (GO) categories, genes involved in positive regulation of apoptosis and negative regulation of cell proliferation became upregulated at the transition from normal to low-risk MDS and subsequently downregulated upon transformation to MDS/AML, in agreement with our phenotypic analyses (Figure 5C). Similarly, negative regulation of differentiation was a category upregulated early on. By gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA), we identified significantly enriched disease-specific and shared functional pathways in the iPSC-derived HPCs representing the three different disease stages (Figure S6C; Table S4). Notably, both the high-risk MDS- and MDS/AML- iPSC-derived HPCs were significantly enriched for the high-risk MDS deletion 7q gene set, consistent with both their respective disease state and their specific genetic makeup (Figure 5D). Additionally, the MDS/AML-iPSC-HPCs showed specific enrichment for a gene set found in a subset of human AML patients that had a worse clinical prognosis and contained chromosome 7 abnormalities (Valk et al., 2004Valk P.J. Verhaak R.G. Beijen M.A. Erpelinck C.A. Barjesteh van Waalwijk van Doorn-Khosrovani S. Boer J.M. Beverloo H.B. Moorhouse M.J. van der Spek P.J. Löwenberg B. Delwel R. Prognostically useful gene-expression profiles in acute myeloid leukemia.N. Engl. J. Med. 2004; 350: 1617-1628Crossref PubMed Scopus (1107) Google Scholar) (Figure 5E). Overall, these data suggest that gene expression programs found in HPCs derived from our iPSC panel recapitulate disease progression and capture gene expression signatures derived from primary samples from patients with myeloid malignancies. We next asked if this model and the phenotypes characterized therein could guide modeling transitions between disease stages, as readouts for disease progression or reversal. We first analyzed an iPSC line derived from the high-risk MDS line MDS-2.13 after spontaneous correction of the del(7q) (Kotini et al., 2015Kotini A.G. Chang C.J. Boussaad I. Delrow J.J. Dolezal E.K. Nagulapally A.B. Perna F. Fishbein G.A. Klimek V.M. Hawkins R.D. et al.Functional analysis of a chromosomal deletion associated with myelodysplastic syndromes using isogenic human induced pluripotent stem cells.Nat. Biotechnol. 2015; 33: 646-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) (Figure 6A). Following correction of the del(7q), this line only harbors a SRSF2 P95L mutation (and a PHF6 mutation of uncertain significance). Since the SRSF2 P95L mutation is an early event in MDS and alone not sufficient for the development of MDS, the corrected line (MDS-2.A3C) would be predicted to capture a preleukemic stage (Papaemmanuil et al., 2013Papaemmanuil E. Gerstung M. Malcovati L. Tauro S. Gundem G. Van Loo P. Yoon C.J. Ellis P. Wedge D.C. Pellagatti A. et al.Chronic Myeloid Disorders Working Group of the International Cancer Genome ConsortiumClinical and biological implications of driver mutations in myelodysplastic syndromes.Blood. 2013; 122 (quiz 3699): 3616-3627Crossref PubMed Scopus (1271) Google Scholar). Consistent with this, detailed phenotypic characterization, based on the phenotypic assays defined in the iPSC panel above, confirmed a phenotype corresponding to a preleukemic stage: correction of the emergence of CD45+ cells, loss of CD90 expression, re-emergence of a CD41a+/CD45− megakaryocyte progenitor population, partial rescue of clonogenicity, and restored growth and viability (Figures 6B–6F). Conversely, to model disease progression, we first started with the preleukemic N-3.10 line, harboring a germline GATA2 mutation. GATA2 mutations found in patients with familial predisposition syndromes are believed to be loss-of-function mutations (Collin et al., 2015Collin M. Dickinson R. Bigley V. Haematopoietic and immune defects associated with GATA2 mutation.Br. J. Haematol. 2015; 169: 173-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Since the MDS clone of the same patient from whom this line was derived (patient 3; Figure 1) had acquired a second GATA2 mutation in the other allele (Figure S1A) together with additional recurrent genetic abnormalities, we sought to model the effects of inactivating the other GATA2 allele in the disease phenotype. We designed two distinct CRISPR/Cas9-based strategies and isolated two clones derived from the N-3.10 line, in which both GATA2 alleles harbored inactivating frameshift indels, as well as a third clone that retained the mutant T357N allele and harbored a deletion of the zinc-finger 2 domain (where many of the mutations found in patients cluster), predicted to abolish DNA binding (Figures 6G, S7A, and S7B) (Collin et al., 2015Collin M.

Here we report techniques for long-term two-photon imaging in awake macaque monkeys. Using genetically encoded indicators including GCaMP5 and GCaMP6s delivered by AAV2/1 into the visual cortex, we demonstrate that high-quality two-photon imaging of large neuronal populations can be achieved and maintained in awake monkeys for months. Simultaneous intracellular recording and two-photon calcium imaging confirm that fluorescence activity is linearly proportional to neuronal spiking activity across a wide range of firing rates (10 Hz to 150 Hz). By providing two-photon imaging access to cortical neuronal populations at single-cell or single dendritic spine resolution in awake monkeys, the techniques reported can help bridge the use of modern genetic and molecular tools and the study of higher cognitive function."
https://openalex.org/W2589939875,"Anti-angiogenic therapies for cancer such as VEGF neutralizing antibody bevacizumab have limited durability. While mechanisms of resistance remain undefined, it is likely that acquired resistance to anti-angiogenic therapy will involve alterations of the tumor microenvironment. We confirmed increased tumor-associated macrophages in bevacizumab-resistant glioblastoma patient specimens and two novel glioblastoma xenograft models of bevacizumab resistance. Microarray analysis suggested downregulated macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) to be the most pertinent mediator of increased macrophages. Bevacizumab-resistant patient glioblastomas and both novel xenograft models of resistance had less MIF than bevacizumab-naive tumors, and harbored more M2/protumoral macrophages that specifically localized to the tumor edge. Xenografts expressing MIF-shRNA grew more rapidly with greater angiogenesis and had macrophages localizing to the tumor edge which were more prevalent and proliferative, and displayed M2 polarization, whereas bevacizumab-resistant xenografts transduced to upregulate MIF exhibited the opposite changes. Bone marrow-derived macrophage were polarized to an M2 phenotype in the presence of condition-media derived from bevacizumab-resistant xenograft-derived cells, while recombinant MIF drove M1 polarization. Media from macrophages exposed to bevacizumab-resistant tumor cell conditioned media increased glioma cell proliferation compared with media from macrophages exposed to bevacizumab-responsive tumor cell media, suggesting that macrophage polarization in bevacizumab-resistant xenografts is the source of their aggressive biology and results from a secreted factor. Two mechanisms of bevacizumab-induced MIF reduction were identified: (1) bevacizumab bound MIF and blocked MIF-induced M1 polarization of macrophages; and (2) VEGF increased glioma MIF production in a VEGFR2-dependent manner, suggesting that bevacizumab-induced VEGF depletion would downregulate MIF. Site-directed biopsies revealed enriched MIF and VEGF at the enhancing edge in bevacizumab-naive patients. This MIF enrichment was lost in bevacizumab-resistant glioblastomas, driving a tumor edge M1-to-M2 transition. Thus, bevacizumab resistance is driven by reduced MIF at the tumor edge causing proliferative expansion of M2 macrophages, which in turn promotes tumor growth."

Disease- and trait-associated variants identified in genome-wide association studies largely cluster at regulatory loci. Here we demonstrate the use of multiple designer nucleases and variant-aware library design to interrogate trait-associated regulatory DNA at high resolution. We developed a computational tool for the creation of saturating-mutagenesis libraries with single or multiple nucleases with incorporation of variants. We applied this methodology to the HBS1L-MYB intergenic region, which is associated with red-blood-cell traits, including fetal hemoglobin levels. This approach identified putative regulatory elements that control MYB expression. Analysis of genomic copy number highlighted potential false-positive regions, thus emphasizing the importance of off-target analysis in the design of saturating-mutagenesis experiments. Together, these data establish a widely applicable high-throughput and high-resolution methodology to identify minimal functional sequences within large disease- and trait-associated regions."
https://openalex.org/W2588872687,"Temperature is a fundamental physical parameter that plays an important role in biological reactions and events. Although thermometers developed previously have been used to investigate several important phenomena, such as heterogeneous temperature distribution in a single living cell and heat generation in mitochondria, the development of a thermometer with a sensitivity over a wide temperature range and rapid response is still desired to quantify temperature change in not only homeotherms but also poikilotherms from the cellular level to in vivo. To overcome the weaknesses of the conventional thermometers, such as a limitation of applicable species and a low temporal resolution, owing to the narrow temperature range of sensitivity and the thermometry method, respectively, we developed a genetically encoded ratiometric fluorescent temperature indicator, gTEMP, by using two fluorescent proteins with different temperature sensitivities. Our thermometric method enabled a fast tracking of the temperature change with a time resolution of 50 ms. We used this method to observe the spatiotemporal temperature change between the cytoplasm and nucleus in cells, and quantified thermogenesis from the mitochondria matrix in a single living cell after stimulation with carbonyl cyanide 4-(trifluoromethoxy)phenylhydrazone, which was an uncoupler of oxidative phosphorylation. Moreover, exploiting the wide temperature range of sensitivity from 5°C to 50°C of gTEMP, we monitored the temperature in a living medaka embryo for 15 hours and showed the feasibility of in vivo thermometry in various living species."

Encoded by >800 genes in the human genome, they represent targets of a variety of clinically used drugs. A single GPCR occupied by its cognate orthosteric or by allosteric ligands can trigger a complex array of signal transduction pathways, which can in some cases be selectively modulated through development and use of biased ligands (1.Kenakin T. The effective application of biased signaling to new drug discovery.Mol. Pharmacol. 2015; 88: 1055-1061Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Such molecules can modulate a subset of the total signalosome, probably by inducing distinct conformational changes in GPCR structure, which translates into differential effector engagement. The development of such biased molecules, aside from creating powerful tools to study GPCR signaling, might also lead to clinically relevant compounds with better efficacy and side effect profiles.

Such approaches are very useful because they can be used to identify novel pathways downstream of GPCRs and to capture the protean nature of receptor agonism (i.e. that in some cases antagonists act like agonists and vice versa) and can often link both therapeutic and adverse consequences to particular signaling pathways. However, when the relevant signaling pathways in a given cell type are incompletely understood, such profiles may be incomplete. Also, it is possible that the signalosome downstream of particular receptors may be different in distinct cells types, raising the issue of portability of signaling sensor platforms (10.Hao Y. Tatonetti N.P. Predicting G protein-coupled receptor downstream signaling by tissue expression.Bioinformatics. 2016; 32: 3435-3443PubMed Google Scholar). Structurally, GPCRs are characterized by an extracellular N-terminal tail, followed by seven transmembrane α-helices connected by three intracellular (ICL1–3) and three extracellular loops (ECL1–3), ending with an intracellular C-terminal tail (C-tail). GPCRs fold themselves into a barrel-like structure, with the seven transmembrane helices forming a cavity that serves in many cases as a ligand-binding domain. There are many optical approaches being used to understand GPCR signaling, interactions, and conformational dynamics (reviewed in Refs. 11.Tian H. Fürstenberg A. Huber T.

Previous studies have shown that engineering FlAsH-binding sequences into different positions in GPCRs with FRET or bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET) partners, such as YFP or Renilla luciferase, can be used to produce biosensors that report on ligand-induced conformational changes in receptors (13.Lohse M.J.

Design and construction of conformational biosensors to monitor ion channel activation: a prototype FlAsH/BRET-approach to Kir3 channels.Methods. 2016; 92: 19-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). In this regard, we have engineered several GPCR-based biosensors to monitor ligand-mediated conformational changes in intact HEK 293 cells and in vascular smooth muscle cells from distinct vantage points. A set of biosensors was generated for the angiotensin II (Ang II) AT1 receptor (AT1R), a prototypical Gαq-coupled GPCR, where we examined responses to balanced and biased ligands (22.Balakumar P. Jagadeesh G. Structural determinants for binding, activation, and functional selectivity of the angiotensin AT1 receptor.J. Mol. Endocrinol. 2014; 53: R71-R92Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) as well as the role of cell context in determining conformational outcomes. Combining such biosensor approaches with selective knock-out of G proteins or β-arrestin isoforms using CRISPR/Cas9 offers insights into the role of receptor/G protein or receptor/β-arrestin interactions in driving receptor conformational responses to ligands. We began by engineering the FlAsH binding sequence into three positions in ICL2, five positions in ICL3, and one position in the C-tail of AT1R, which had also been tagged with Renilla luciferase in the distal C-tail (Fig. 1, A and C). The position of our insertions can also be seen in a 3D rendering based on the published structure of the AT1R (Fig. 1B), although C-tail constructs are not visible because they were not represented in the structure published (23.Zhang H. Unal H. Gati C. Han G.W. Liu W. Zatsepin N.A. James D. Wang D. Nelson G. Weierstall U. Sawaya M.R. Xu Q. Messerschmidt M. Williams G.J. Boutet S. et al.Structure of the angiotensin receptor revealed by serial femtosecond crystallography.Cell. 2015; 161: 833-844Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). To determine whether such constructs act as viable biosensors of receptor conformation, we first tested whether they were localized to the cell surface in HEK 293 cells and whether they retained functionality when stimulated with Ang II. With no effort made to control receptor expression levels per se, we could detect similar total levels of receptor expression (supplemental Fig. 1B) and significant surface labeling of ICL2P2, ICL2P3, ICL3P2, ICL3P3, ICL3P4, ICL3P5, and C-tailP1 (supplemental Fig. 1, A and C). All of the tagged constructs showed Ang II-mediated activation of ERK1/2, although not as robustly compared with wild type or the C-tailP1 constructs (supplemental Fig. 1D). Constructs that did not show both cell surface labeling and Ang II-mediated signaling were excluded from subsequent analysis. Thus, ICL2P1 (supplemental Fig. 1D) and ICL3P1 (which did not express at the cell surface; data not shown) were excluded from subsequent analysis. Even in the absence of receptor stimulation, there were differences in basal levels of BRET when the different biosensors were compared (supplemental Fig. 1E). This could indicate real differences depending on the relative positions of donor and acceptor moieties or could simply reflect the differences in expression level, subcellular localization, or functionality because of the insertion. Thus, we compared agonist responses using a small panel of AT1R ligands across the different sensors. There were minimal responses to Ang II, Ang III, or any of several biased AT1R ligands at ICL2P3, ICL3P2, or ICL3P5 (supplemental Fig. 2, A–C). There were similar responses for all ligands except SBpA at ICL3P4 (supplemental Fig. 2D). However, significant differences could be detected between Ang II and Ang III, ligands that activate all downstream signaling pathways, compared with the β-arrestin-biased ligands SI, SII, and SBpA with the other biosensors. For ICL2P2, there was almost no response to Ang II or Ang III but robust responses to all of the biased ligands except DVG (Fig. 2A). Conversely, there were robust responses to the balanced ligands for ICL3P3 and C-tailP1 and much smaller responses to any of the biased ligands again with the exception of DVG at ICL3P3 or SBpA at C-tailP1 (Fig. 2, B and C). As a control, no agonist responses were detected when cells expressing WT (untagged) receptors were labeled with the FlAsH reagent (supplemental Fig. 2A, inset). The responses detected by these three biosensors could be seen in real time, were dose-dependent (Fig. 3 (A–C), left and right panels), and were blocked in the presence of the AT1R antagonist losartan (Fig. 3A, right, inset). Thus, with a small number of conformational biosensors, we can capture different ligand-specific patterns of bias in a simple and robust way (summarized in Fig. 2D).FIGURE 3Kinetics (left) and dose-response curves (right) for the different conformational biosensors.

U.S.A. 2003; 100: 10782-10787Crossref PubMed Scopus (549) Google Scholar). We next wanted to determine how the biosensors responded to the different ligands when we modulated G protein function either pharmacologically or via CRISPR-mediated gene deletion. We began with a HEK 293 cell line gene deleted for Gαq, Gα11, Gα12, and Gα13 using CRISPR (ΔGαq/11/12/13 line). Data shown in Fig. 4 indicate that signaling responses to the G proteins are compromised when they are absent. We first examined ICL3P3 and C-tailP1 in the ΔGαq/11/12/13line. In the absence of the G proteins, the response to Ang II was essentially lost but could be restored when either Gαq or Gα11 was returned to these cells (Fig. 5, A and B). Although it has been shown that the AT1R can couple to Gα12 (reviewed in Ref. 26.Hunyady L. Catt K.J. Pleiotropic AT1 receptor signaling pathways mediating physiological and pathogenic actions of angiotensin II.Mol. Endocrinol. 2006; 20: 953-970Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar), the replacement of either Gα12 or Gα13 in the CRISPR line did not rescue the conformational responses detected in ICL3 or the C-tail.FIGURE 5Effect of Gα gene deletion on agonist-induced BRET changes in conformational biosensors. The ICL3P3 (A), C-tailP1 (B), and ICL2P2 sensors (C–E) were transiently expressed in the ΔGαq/11/12/13 line (A–C) in the absence (pcDNA) or presence of either Gαq, Gα11, Gα12, or Gα13, and BRET was measured in response to 1 μm Ang II (A and B) or 10 μm SI (C). In D, a CRISPR line with β-arrestin 1/2 deleted was tested with ICL2P2 in response to 10 μm SI when expression of either β-arrestin 1, β-arrestin 2, or both was restored or not.

Data are shown as individual experiments performed in triplicate, and the lines represent the average.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) However, we could still detect a robust response to SI at ICL2P2, and returning each of the Gα subunits individually in turn had no effect on the response, suggesting that, in fact, this conformational change in response to SI was independent of the G proteins deleted (Fig. 5C). Next, we assessed whether ICL2P2 responses might be affected when β-arrestin 1/2 were removed. First, we used an HEK 293 CRISPR line gene deleted for β-arrestin 1 and 2 (27.Alvarez-Curto E. Inoue A.

Surprisingly, no effect was detected in the ICL2P2 responses to SI, suggesting that conformations driven by the biased ligand do not require either G protein or β-arrestin (Fig. 5D, compare first and last bars). No differences were detected when β-arrestin 1/2 were restored to the CRISPR cell line (Fig. 5D, middle bars; also see supplemental Fig. 3A). A similar result was obtained using transfected β-arrestin siRNA (Fig. 5E and supplemental Fig. 3B). Thus, SI can drive the conformational change whether or not β-arrestin is present, and recruitment of β-arrestin may follow the conformation induced by the biased ligand. We still wanted to examine whether the G protein partner constrained receptor conformation. We noted that in the absence of G proteins, Ang II could produce a response at ICL2P2 (Fig. 6A, first column), whereas there was no response in HEK 293 cells with the native complement of G proteins (Fig. 2A). When we restored expression of Gαq or, to a lesser extent, Gα11 in the ΔGαq/11/12/13 line, we noted that the response to Ang II was dampened to the level seen in native HEK 293 cells (Fig. 6A). These results suggest that the Gαq or Gα11 protein partner constrains responses to Ang II in a manner distinct from SI. Although this does not settle the question of G protein independence of biased signaling, it does argue that the G protein alters the conformational responses to Ang II. Previous studies have also shown that AT1R is coupled to Gαi/o as well (reviewed in Ref. 26.Hunyady L. Catt K.J. Pleiotropic AT1 receptor signaling pathways mediating physiological and pathogenic actions of angiotensin II.Mol. Endocrinol. 2006; 20: 953-970Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar). Interestingly, other differences were revealed when cells were pretreated with PTX to inhibit Gαi/o. In native HEK 293 cells, PTX pretreatment had no effect on responses in C-tailP1 to Ang II (Table 1, top). However, both ICL2P2 and ICL3P3 had responses reduced by ∼25% in response to SI and Ang II, respectively. This suggests that our sensors can also detect conformational changes in AT1R/Gαi/o interactions. However, a slightly different picture emerges in the CRISPR line (Table 1, bottom). Again, there was little change in the response measured to the C-tailP1 sensor, but there was a significant loss of signal from ICL3P3, suggesting that these two sensors report conformation in a distinct manner when the receptor is coupled to either Gαi/o or Gαq/11. However, the ICL2P2 response to PTX in the ΔGαq/11/12/13 line was the same as in native HEK 293 cells, again highlighting the insensitivity of ICL2P2 to the presence or absence of the G proteins we examined.TABLE 1Effect of PTX on agonist-induced BRET changesSensor/AgonistAverage effect ± S.E.n% of vehicle-treated cellsHEK 293 cells ICL2P2/SI76.9 ± 1.23 ICL3P3/Ang II76.1 ± 7.33 C-tailP1/Ang II94.9 ± 18.13ΔGq,11,12,13 cells ICL2P2/SI83.9 ± 3.43 ICL3P3/Ang II59.2 ± 6.93 C-tailP1/Ang II95.4 ± 9.63 Open table in a new tab To explore the role of the “activatibility” of Gαq in altering the responses detected in ICL2P2 or ICL3P3, we used the ΔGαq/11/12/13 line and transfected these cells with either wild type or a dominant negative version of Gαq (28.Yu B. Gu L. Simon M.I. Inhibition of subsets of G protein-coupled receptors by empty mutants of G protein α subunits in Go, G11, and G16.J. Biol.

The Gαq/11 proteins contribute to T lymphocyte migration by promoting turnover of integrin LFA-1 through recycling.PLoS One. 2012; 7: e38517Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The effect of Gαq on Ang II responses in ICL2P2 could be mediated by either version of Gαq (Fig. 6B), suggesting that in this case, the G protein serves a structural role in constraining Ang II-induced conformational change. However, for ICL3P3, only the functional, wild type Gαq was able to rescue the loss of agonist-induced signal in the ΔGαq/11/12/13 line, showing that, in this case, receptor conformation is altered by the G protein as it also becomes activated (Fig. 6C). For the ICL2P2 sensor, the response to Ang II in the β-arrestin CRISPR line was similar to the parental cells, whether or not β-arrestin 1/2 expression was restored (Fig. 6C, inset). These results again highlight differences between conformations induced by Ang II versus biased ligands with respect to dependence on the G protein partner. Finally, we wanted to assess whether the conformational biosensors were portable from one cell type to another, and also, we wanted to establish their value in a more physiologically relevant context. Thus, we engineered lentiviral versions of our biosensors and transduced rat vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs). As in the HEK 293 cells, basal BRET in ICL2P2 was lower than in ICL3P3 or C-tailP1 biosensors in VSMCs (Fig. 7A). However, our observations revealed an interesting pattern of changes in basal BRET, depending on whether the biosensors were expressed in HEK 293 cells, the ΔGαq/11/12/13 line, or VSMCs. Thus, we examined whether the environment in the cell could affect the conformation of AT1R and whether this could be detected by our biosensors when expression levels were controlled for. Returning the Gαq to the CRISPR line resulted in no change in total expression levels of the different sensors (supplemental Fig. 4A). We noted that basal BRET from ICL2P2, ICL3P3, or C-tailP1 did not depend directly on the co-expression of Gαq per se. However, it was clear that basal BRET in ICL3P3, in C-tailP1, and, most strikingly, in ICL2P2 were different, depending on the cell line or type examined (supplemental Fig. 4, B and C). This suggested that cellular context was a key determinant of basal BRET for the different biosensors. We next examined the effects of ligands on the biosensors expressed in VSMCs. Grossly, the responses measured in ICL3P3 or C-tailP1 were similar between VSMCs and HEK 293 cells (compare Figs. 2 (B and C) and 7 (C and D)). There were some small differences in responses measured for the four biased agonists (i.e. the loss of a response to DVG in VSMCs when measuring ICL2P2, although a similar trend was seen in HEK 293 cells), but the response to Ang II, not detected in HEK 293 cells, was not only detectable in VSMCs but in the opposite direction to the biased ligands (Fig. 7B). This again highlights the importance of cell context in the reports detected from these conformational biosensors. The effect of cell context could be seen more clearly when we plotted the net agonist responses from ICL2P2 and ICL3P3 for both HEK 293 cells and VSMCs. In the former, the reports at ICL2P2 were higher than for ICL3P3, whereas this was inverted in VSMCs (Fig. 7E). The difference in biosensor responses in both cell types tested was unlikely to be the result of either absolute or relative expression levels because total luminescence levels produced by both sensors were roughly similar between cells (supplemental Fig. 4D). Last, given our results in the ΔGαq/11/12/13 line, we wanted to examine the effects of G protein inhibition on the responses measured in VSMCs. In HEK 293 cells, the effect of the selective Gαq/11 inhibitor FR900359 showed that a functional Gαq was required for responses at both ICL3P3 and C-tailP1 with only a limited effect on ICL2P2, consistent with our results in the CRISPR cell line (Table 2, top). A similar effect for FR900359 was detected for ICL3P3 and C-tailP1 in VSMCs (Table 2, bottom). However, inhibition of Gαq also dampened the effect of Ang II on ICL2P2 in VSMCs (Table 2, bottom).TABLE 2Effect of Gαq/11 inhibition on biosensor responses: effect of FR900359 on agonist-induced BRET changesSensor/AgonistAverage effect ± S.E.n% of vehicle-treated cellsHEK 293 cells ICL2P2/SI91.7 ± 2.93 ICL3P3/Ang II63.1 ± 4.34 C-tailP1/Ang II67.4 ± 6.14VSMCs ICL2P2/Ang II−63.6 ± 49.73 ICL3P3/Ang II73.4 ± 10.23 C-tailP1/Ang II70.4 ± 2.13 Open table in a new tab Taken together, our results highlight the value of conformational biosensors in both capturing ligand bias in a simple and robust manner and also in capturing aspects of the receptor interactions with signaling partners and their mutual effects on receptor conformation in different cellular contexts. Here, we show that intramolecular conformational biosensors can capture important functional aspects of GPCRs. We also show that receptor conformation correlates to patterns established in a study of signaling outcomes for AT1R (9.Zimmerman B. Beautrait A. Aguila B. Charles R. Escher E. Claing A. Bouvier M.

https://openalex.org/W2588973888,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is a common neurodegenerative disease whose pathological hallmark is the accumulation of intracellular α-synuclein aggregates in Lewy bodies. Lipid metabolism dysregulation may play a significant role in PD pathogenesis; however, large plasma lipidomic studies in PD are lacking. In the current study, we analyzed the lipidomic profile of plasma obtained from 150 idiopathic PD patients and 100 controls, taken from the 'Spot' study at Columbia University Medical Center in New York. Our mass spectrometry based analytical panel consisted of 520 lipid species from 39 lipid subclasses including all major classes of glycerophospholipids, sphingolipids, glycerolipids and sterols. Each lipid species was analyzed using a logistic regression model. The plasma concentrations of two lipid subclasses, triglycerides and monosialodihexosylganglioside (GM3), were different between PD and control participants. GM3 ganglioside concentration had the most significant difference between PD and controls (1.531±0.037 pmol/μl versus 1.337±0.040 pmol/μl respectively; p-value = 5.96E-04; q-value = 0.048; when normalized to total lipid: p-value = 2.890E-05; q-value = 2.933E-03). Next, we used a collection of 20 GM3 and glucosylceramide (GlcCer) species concentrations normalized to total lipid to perform a ROC curve analysis, and found that these lipids compare favorably with biomarkers reported in previous studies (AUC = 0.742 for males, AUC = 0.644 for females). Our results suggest that higher plasma GM3 levels are associated with PD. GM3 lies in the same glycosphingolipid metabolic pathway as GlcCer, a substrate of the enzyme glucocerebrosidase, which has been associated with PD. These findings are consistent with previous reports implicating lower glucocerebrosidase activity with PD risk."

The mammalian binocular visual circuit is comprised of projections of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) to ipsilateral and contralateral targets in the brain. A transcriptional code for ipsilateral RGC identity has been identified, but less is known about the transcriptional regulation of contralateral RGC development. Here we demonstrate that SoxC genes (Sox4, 11, and 12) act on the progenitor-to-postmitotic transition to implement contralateral, but not ipsilateral, RGC differentiation, by binding to Hes5 and thus repressing Notch signaling. When SoxC genes are deleted in postmitotic RGCs, contralateral RGC axons grow poorly on chiasm cells in vitro and project ipsilaterally at the chiasm midline in vivo, and Plexin-A1 and Nr-CAM expression in RGCs is downregulated. These data implicate SoxC transcription factors in the regulation of contralateral RGC differentiation and axon guidance."
https://openalex.org/W2588634377,"Hydrogen sulfide is a cardioprotective signaling molecule but is toxic at elevated concentrations. Red blood cells can synthesize H2S but, lacking organelles, cannot dispose of H2S via the mitochondrial sulfide oxidation pathway. We have recently shown that at high sulfide concentrations, ferric hemoglobin oxidizes H2S to a mixture of thiosulfate and iron-bound polysulfides in which the latter species predominates. Here, we report the crystal structure of human hemoglobin containing low spin ferric sulfide, the first intermediate in heme-catalyzed sulfide oxidation. The structure provides molecular insights into why sulfide is susceptible to oxidation in human hemoglobin but is stabilized against it in HbI, a specialized sulfide-carrying hemoglobin from a mollusk adapted to life in a sulfide-rich environment. We have also captured a second sulfide bound at a postulated ligand entry/exit site in the α-subunit of hemoglobin, which, to the best of our knowledge, represents the first direct evidence for this site being used to access the heme iron. Hydrodisulfide, a postulated intermediate at the junction between thiosulfate and polysulfide formation, coordinates ferric hemoglobin and, in the presence of air, generated thiosulfate. At low sulfide/heme iron ratios, the product distribution between thiosulfate and iron-bound polysulfides was approximately equal. The iron-bound polysulfides were unstable at physiological glutathione concentrations and were reduced with concomitant formation of glutathione persulfide, glutathione disulfide, and H2S. Hence, although polysulfides are unlikely to be stable in the reducing intracellular milieu, glutathione persulfide could serve as a persulfide donor for protein persulfidation, a posttranslational modification by which H2S is postulated to signal."

A subset of patients with COPD have frequent exacerbations, occurring 2 or more times per year. Despite many interventions to reduce COPD exacerbations, there is a significant lack of knowledge in regards to their mechanisms and predisposing factors. We describe here an important observation that defines antibody deficiency as a potential risk factor for frequent COPD exacerbations. We report a case series of patients who have frequent COPD exacerbations, and who were found to have an underlying primary antibody deficiency syndrome. We also report on the outcome of COPD exacerbations following treatment in a subset with of these patients with antibody deficiency. We identified patients with COPD who had 2 or more moderate to severe exacerbations per year; immune evaluation including serum immunoglobulin levels and pneumococcal IgG titers was performed. Patients diagnosed with an antibody deficiency syndrome were treated with either immunoglobulin replacement therapy or prophylactic antibiotics, and their COPD exacerbations were monitored over time. A total of 42 patients were identified who had 2 or more moderate to severe COPD exacerbations per year. Twenty-nine patients had an underlying antibody deficiency syndrome: common variable immunodeficiency (8), specific antibody deficiency (20), and selective IgA deficiency (1). Twenty-two patients had a follow-up for at least 1 year after treatment of their antibody deficiency, which resulted in a significant reduction of COPD exacerbations, courses of oral corticosteroid use and cumulative annual dose of oral corticosteroid use, rescue antibiotic use, and hospitalizations for COPD exacerbations. This case series identifies antibody deficiency as a potentially treatable risk factor for frequent COPD exacerbations; testing for antibody deficiency should be considered in difficult to manage frequently exacerbating COPD patients. Further prospective studies are warranted to further test this hypothesis."

Heart weight/body weight ratio (HW/BW), hemodynamic parameters (anaesthetized rats) and plasma brain natriuretic peptide (BNP, ELISA) were assessed in 21-day, 6-month and 22-month old rats. Plasma testosterone (ELISA) and cardiac protein expression of enzymes related to reactive oxygen species synthesis (p22phox, xanthine-oxidase) and degradation (catalase, Cu/Zn-SOD, Mn-SOD, Ec-SOD) were evaluated in 21-day and 6-month old rats (Western Blot). Heart structure and function was studied at the age of 22 months (echocardiography).At the age of 21 days MUN males exhibited significantly larger HW/BW and cardiac p22phox expression while females had reduced p22phox expression, compared to their respective sex-matched controls. At the age of 6-months, MUN males showed significantly larger blood pressure and cardiac xanthine-oxidase expression; MUN females were normotensive and had a lower cardiac expression of antioxidant enzymes, compared to their respective sex-matched controls. At the age of 22 months, both MUN males and females showed larger HW/BW and left ventricular mass and lower ejection fraction compared to sex-matched controls; only MUN males exhibited hypertension and a larger plasma BNP compared to aged male controls.1) During perinatal life females exposed to fetal undernutrition are protected from cardiac alterations, but in ageing they exhibit ventricular hypertrophy and functional loss, like MUN males; 2) cardiac oxidative stress might be implicated in the observed heart alterations in both sexes and 3) the severity of cardiac damage might be greater in males due to hypertension."

Yet, the effect of cholesterol on G protein-gated inwardly rectifying potassium (GIRK) channels expressed in the brain is unknown. GIRK channels mediate the actions of inhibitory brain neurotransmitters. As a result, loss of GIRK function can enhance neuron excitability, whereas gain of GIRK function can reduce neuronal activity.

Furthermore, using planar lipid bilayers, we show that although cholesterol did not affect the unitary conductance of GIRK2, it significantly enhanced the frequency of channel openings.

To discover novel gene fusions, we performed whole-transcriptome sequencing surveys of three AcCC archival cases. In one specimen we identified a novel HTN3-MSANTD3 gene fusion, and in another a novel PRB3-ZNF217 gene fusion. The structure of both fusions was consistent with the promoter of the 5' partner (HTN3 or PRB3), both highly expressed salivary gland genes, driving overexpression of full-length MSANTD3 or ZNF217. By fluorescence in situ hybridization of an expanded AcCC case series, we observed MSANTD3 rearrangements altogether in 3 of 20 evaluable cases (15%), but found no additional ZNF217 rearrangements. MSANTD3 encodes a previously uncharacterized Myb/SANT domain-containing protein. Immunohistochemical staining demonstrated diffuse nuclear MSANTD3 expression in 8 of 27 AcCC cases (30%), including the three cases with MSANTD3 rearrangement. MSANTD3 displayed heterogeneous expression in normal salivary ductal epithelium, as well as among other histologic types of salivary gland cancer though without evidence of translocation. In a broader survey, MSANTD3 showed variable expression across a wide range of normal and neoplastic human tissue specimens. In preliminary functional studies, engineered MSANTD3 overexpression in rodent salivary gland epithelial cells did not enhance cell proliferation, but led to significant upregulation of gene sets involved in protein synthesis. Our findings newly identify MSANTD3 rearrangement as a recurrent event in salivary gland AcCC, providing new insight into disease pathogenesis, and identifying a putative novel human oncogene."

We and others have investigated the downstream effectors of 53BP1, including replication timing regulatory factor 1 (RIF1) and Pax transactivation domain-interacting protein (PTIP), in the past few years to elucidate how loss of the 53BP1-dependent repair pathway results in PARPi resistance in BRCA1 patients. However, questions regarding the upstream regulation of the 53BP1 pathway remain unanswered. In this study, we identified the Tudor-interacting repair regulator (TIRR) that specifically associates with the ionizing radiation-induced foci formation region of 53BP1. 53BP1 and TIRR form a stable complex, which is required for their expression. Moreover, the 53BP1-TIRR complex dissociates after DNA damage, and this dissociation may be ataxia telangiectasia mutated-dependent. Similar to 53BP1, loss of TIRR restores PARPi resistance in BRCA1-deficient cells. Collectively, our data identified a novel 53BP1-TIRR complex in DNA damage response. TIRR may play both positive and negative roles in 53BP1 regulation. On the one hand, it stabilizes 53BP1 and thus positively regulates 53BP1. On the other hand, its association with 53BP1 prevents 53BP1 localization to sites of DNA damage, and thus TIRR is also an inhibitor of 53BP1."
https://openalex.org/W2589620344,"The key molecular mechanism governing the cancer cell state (stem cell-like state vs differentiation state) to control the cancer stem cell (CSC) pool remains elusive. This study provides the first evidence showing that all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) induces the interaction and chromatin recruitment of a novel RARβ-TET2 complex to epigenetically activate a specific cohort of gene targets, including MiR-200c. TET2-activated miR-200c further targets and suppresses PKCζ, a cell polarity protein that has a pivotal role in directing asymmetric division of mammalian stem cells to sustain the stem cell pool. Our data reveal that pharmacological concentration of ATRA effectively downregulates PKCζ through activation of miR-200c, leading to a decrease of the stem cell-like populations from non-tumorigenic mammary epithelial cells and non-aggressive breast cancer cells. However, aggressive breast cancer cells that manifest TET2-miR-200c dysregulation sustain a CSC pool highly resistant to ATRA, where inhibition of PKCζ directs the resistant CSCs to the luminal cell-like state and sensitization to tamoxifen, resulting in abrogation of mammary tumor growth and progression. Together, these findings elucidate a novel RARβ-TET2-miR-200c-PKCζ signaling pathway that directs cancer cell state changes and also provide previously unidentified therapeutic implications for PKCζ inhibitors in diminishment of breast CSCs to eradicate breast cancer."

Over a 7-day period, including five week days (with scheduled dance training at a conservatoire) and two weekend days (with no scheduled dance training at the conservatoire), energy intake (self-reported weighed food diary and 24 h dietary recall) and expenditure (tri-axial accelerometry) were recorded. Mean daily energy intake and expenditure were different over the 7-day period (P = 0.014) equating to an energy deficit of -356 ± 668 kcal·day-1 (or -1.5 ± 2.8 MJ·day-1). Energy expenditure was not different when comparing week and weekend days (P = 0.297). However daily energy intake (P = 0.002), energy availability (P = 0.003), and energy balance (P = 0.004) were lower during the week compared to the weekend, where energy balance became positive. The percentage contribution of macronutrients to total energy intake also differed; with higher fat (P = 0.022) and alcohol (P = 0.020), and lower carbohydrate (P = 0.001) and a trend for lower protein (P = 0.051) at the weekend. Energy balance and appropriate macronutrient intake are essential for maintaining the demands of training, performance and recovery. Whilst aesthetics are important, female contemporary dancers may be at risk of the numerous health and performance impairments associated with negative energy balance, particularly during periods of scheduled training."
https://openalex.org/W2587899060,"Sustainability has become a key issue in managing natural resources together with growing concerns for capitalism, environmental and resource problems. We hypothesize that the ongoing modernization of competitive societies, which we refer to as “capitalism,” affects human nature for utilizing common pool resources, thus compromising sustainability. To test this hypothesis, we design and implement a set of dynamic common pool resource games and experiments in the following two types of Nepalese areas: (i) rural (non-capitalistic) and (ii) urban (capitalistic) areas. We find that a proportion of prosocial individuals in urban areas is lower than that in rural areas, and urban residents deplete resources more quickly than rural residents. The composition of proself and prosocial individuals in a group and the degree of capitalism are crucial in that an increase in prosocial members in a group and the rural dummy positively affect resource sustainability by 65% and 63%, respectively. Overall, this paper shows that when societies move toward more capitalistic environments, the sustainability of common pool resources tends to decrease with the changes in individual preferences, social norms, customs and views to others through human interactions. This result implies that individuals may be losing their coordination abilities for social dilemmas of resource sustainability in capitalistic societies."

A total of 60,663 unigenes were obtained in this study, with mean length 848.74 bp. 50,814, 49,584 and 49,814 unigenes were respectively obtained from FO, MO and HO groups. There were 2,343 differentially expressed genes between FO and MO, with 855 down- and 1,488 up-regulated genes in the MO group. 2,813 genes were differentially expressed between FO and HO, including 1,256 down- and 1,552 up-regulated genes in the HO group. 2,075 differentially expressed genes were found in the comparison of MO and HO, including 1,074 up- and 1,001 down-regulated genes in the MO group. Some differentially expressed genes, such as fatty acid transport protein (fatp), fatty acid binding protein (fabp), apolipoprotein (apo), peroxisome proliferator activated receptor-gamma (ppar-γ), acetyl-CoA synthetase (acs) and arachidonate 5-lipoxygenase (alox5), were involved in lipid metabolism, suggesting these genes in the loach were responsive to dietary oxidized fish oil. Results of transcriptome profilings here were validated using quantitative real time PCR in fourteen randomly selected unigenes. The present study provides insights into hepatic transcriptome profile of the loach, which is a valuable resource for studies of loach genomics. More importantly, this study identifies some important genes responsible for dietary oxidized fish oil, which will benefit researches of lipid metabolism in fish."

Here, we investigated in detail the role of sialidase in memory processing. Sialidase activity measured with 4-methylumbelliferyl-α-d-N-acetylneuraminic acid (4MU-Neu5Ac) or 5-bromo-4-chloroindol-3-yl-α-d-N-acetylneuraminic acid (X-Neu5Ac) and Fast Red Violet LB was increased by high-K+-induced membrane depolarization.

Neurosci. 2007; 27: 4552-4561Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), endogenous sialidase would also play a crucial role in hippocampal memory processing on the membrane surface. Desialylation on the cell surface by sialidase can change cell surface properties quickly and dramatically. In the present study, we investigated the change of sialidase activity and sialic acid removal from glycans during memory processing. We previously developed a highly sensitive fluorescent probe, a benzothiazolylphenol-based sialic acid derivative (BTP3-Neu5Ac), for histochemical sialidase activity imaging (21Minami A. Otsubo T. Ieno D. Ikeda K. Kanazawa H. Shimizu K. Ohata K. Yokochi T. Horii Y. Fukumoto H. Taguchi R. Takahashi T. Oku N. Suzuki T. Visualization of sialidase activity in mammalian tissues and cancer detection with a novel fluorescent sialidase substrate.PLoS One. 2014; 9: e81941Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). BTP3-Neu5Ac can monitor the rapid change of sialidase activity in mammalian tissues. In this study, we found that sialidase activity detected with BTP3-Neu5Ac at the rat CA3 stratum lucidum was immediately increased in response to LTP-inducible high-frequency stimulation. In vivo monitoring of sialic acid removal in the hippocampal extracellular space showed that desialylation was significantly enhanced during hippocampus-dependent memory formation in a contextual fear-conditioning paradigm. The results suggest that neural activity-dependent desialylation by sialidase occurs during hippocampal memory processing. We first investigated the influence of neural excitation on sialidase activity. In rat acute hippocampal slices, sialidase activity measured using 4-methylumbelliferyl-α-d-N-acetylneuraminic acid (4MU-Neu5Ac), a fluorescent sialidase substrate for quantitative analysis of sialidase activity, was increased by high-K+-induced membrane depolarization at pH 7.3 (one-way repeated measures ANOVA; F3,21 = 33.04, p < 0.001) (Fig. 1, A and B). Increased sialidase activity returned to the basal level immediately after stimulation. If not stimulated, sialidase activity in artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF; pH 7.3) was stable during the experimental period. Galactosidase activity measured using 4MU-β-d-galactopyranoside (4MU-Gal) was not increased by high-K+ stimulation (Fig. 1C). We previously developed a fluorescent histochemical imaging method for sialidase by using X-Neu5Ac and FRV LB (13Minami A. Shimizu H. Meguro Y. Shibata N. Kanazawa H. Ikeda K. Suzuki T. Imaging of sialidase activity in rat brain sections by a highly sensitive fluorescent histochemical method.Neuroimage. 2011; 58: 34-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). When rat acute hippocampal slices were stained in ACSF containing X-Neu5Ac and FRV LB, fluorescence was observed throughout the hippocampus (Fig. 2A). Fluorescence intensities in various hippocampal regions were increased by staining in high-K+ solution containing X-Neu5Ac and FRV LB (Fig. 2, A and B). When the staining was performed in the presence of 1 mm 2,3-dehydro-2-deoxy-N-acetylneuraminic acid (DANA), a sialidase inhibitor, fluorescence was remarkably reduced, indicating that staining with X-Neu5Ac and FRV LB is specific for sialidase activity. To determine whether increased sialidase activity during neural excitation was caused by secreted sialidase, secreted sialidase activity was monitored by measuring the sialidase activity in incubated solutions after each incubation (Fig. 3A). Secreted sialidase activity was barely detected and was not increased by high-K+ stimulation (Fig. 3B). In contrast, total sialidase activity including cell surface sialidase activity, which was measured in hippocampal slices prepared from the same rats as those used for the secreted sialidase activity measurement, was high enough to be detected before stimulation and was increased by high-K+ stimulation (one-way repeated measures ANOVA; F2,22 = 17.0) (Fig. 3C). We pharmacologically identified the signaling pathways that increase sialidase activity. Sialidase activity measured with 4-methylumbelliferyl-α-d-N-acetylneuraminic acid (4MU-Neu5Ac) was increased by forskolin, a chemical LTP inducer (22Weisskopf M.G. Castillo P.E. Zalutsky R.A. Nicoll R.A. Mediation of hippocampal mossy fiber long-term potentiation by cyclic AMP.Science. 1994; 265: 1878-1882Crossref PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar); by BDNF, a regulator of synaptic plasticity (23Edelmann E. Lessmann V. Brigadski T. Pre- and postsynaptic twists in BDNF secretion and action in synaptic plasticity.Neuropharmacology. 2014; 76: 610-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar); and by activation of glutamate receptors using kainate and glutamate (Fig. 3D). The increase in sialidase activity induced by glutamate was partially abolished by 2-amino-5-phosphonopentanoic acid (AP5), an NMDAR antagonist, although AP5 alone did not have any effect on sialidase activity. In contrast, sialidase activity was decreased by GABA. We confirmed that sialidase activity measured with 4MU-Neu5Ac was completely inhibited by DANA. Next, we identified the sialidase isozymes for which sialidase activity was detected by 4MU-Neu5Ac. C-terminal Myc-tagged rat sialidase isozymes were constructed in C6 rat glioma cells. At pH 7.3 in ACSF, 4MU-Neu5Ac was hydrolyzed preferentially by Neu2 and Neu4 and weakly by Neu1 and Neu3 (Fig. 3E). At pH 4.6, 4MU-Neu5Ac was hydrolyzed more efficiently by all sialidase isozymes compared with the neutral pH condition (Fig. 3F). To investigate the change in sialidase expression caused by neural excitation, mRNA levels of sialidase isozymes were measured by using real time quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Expression levels of mRNA in acute hippocampal slices were significantly decreased in Neu1 and Neu2 by high-K+ stimulation and were not significantly changed in Neu3 and Neu4 (Fig. 3, G–J). We investigated the influence of neural excitation on subcellular localization of sialidase. Hippocampal slices (400 μm in thickness) were incubated with ACSF or 100 mm KCl for 30 min and then immediately frozen with liquid nitrogen. After cutting into 20-μm-thick sections, the hippocampal slices were stained with 1 mm BTP3-Neu5Ac (pH 7.3; 27 °C). Intense fluorescence appeared in the cell membrane of pyramidal cells with neural excitation by high-K+ (Fig. 4A). Immunohistochemical staining of the hippocampus showed that Neu4 was expressed in the stratum lucidum where MFs terminate and in the stratum pyramidale where the cell bodies of pyramidal neurons are located (Fig. 4B). We also investigated the influence of glutamate on sialidase activity in rat primary cultured astrocytes. Sialidase activity measured with 4MU-Neu5Ac was significantly increased by incubation with 100 μm glutamate for 30 min (Fig. 4C). Maackia amurensis agglutinin (MAA) and peanut agglutinin (PNA) mainly recognize α2–3-linked sialic acid (Neu5Acα2–3Gal-β(1–3)-GalNAc) and galactose residue (Gal-β(1–3)-GalNAc), respectively. The results of lectin staining showed that MAA bound abundantly to the hippocampus compared with the binding in other brain regions (Fig. 4D). The binding of MAA to the hippocampus was attenuated after neural excitation with high-K+ (Fig. 4, E and F). In contrast, PNA showed weak binding to the hippocampus (Fig. 4G). The binding of PNA to the hippocampus was strengthened after neural excitation (Fig. 4, H and I). Because forskolin induced an increase in sialidase activity, we investigated the effect of electrophysiological LTP induction stimuli on sialidase activity. BTP3-Neu5Ac can detect a change of sialidase activity on a living tissue directly (21Minami A. Otsubo T. Ieno D. Ikeda K. Kanazawa H. Shimizu K. Ohata K. Yokochi T. Horii Y. Fukumoto H. Taguchi R. Takahashi T. Oku N. Suzuki T. Visualization of sialidase activity in mammalian tissues and cancer detection with a novel fluorescent sialidase substrate.PLoS One. 2014; 9: e81941Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). To elucidate the spatiotemporal dynamics of sialidase activity during LTP induction, the rapid change in sialidase activity in response to LTP-inducible high-frequency stimulation was measured by using BTP3-Neu5Ac. When the hippocampal CA3 region was stained with BTP3-Neu5Ac (pH 7.3), the stratum lucidum showed relatively intense fluorescence in the CA3 region (Fig. 5A). BTP3-Neu5Ac did not cause fluorescence in the presence of DANA, indicating that BTP3-Neu5Ac specifically detected sialidase activity (Fig. 5B). The fluorescence intensities at the CA3 stratum lucidum were rapidly increased by an LTP-inducible high-frequency stimulus of 5, 25, or 100 Hz for 5 s (Fig. 5, C and D) with a latency of less than 2 s. The increase in sialidase activity by 25-Hz stimulation was attenuated by inhibition of action potentials with tetrodotoxin (TTX), a voltage-gated sodium channel blocker. For in vivo monitoring of desialylation on the cell surface, the amount of free sialic acid collected from the hippocampal extracellular space was measured using in vivo microdialysis. To confirm that free sialic acid collected through the dialysis membrane is increased by enhancement of sialidase activity, the hippocampus was perfused with ACSF and then injected with exogenous sialidase from Arthrobacter ureafaciens (AUSA) through a cannula placed beside the dialysis membrane. Neu5Ac, the main molecular species of sialic acid, in the perfusate was increased depending on the concentration of AUSA (one-way repeated measures ANOVA; 10 milliunits, F4,20 = 9.07, p < 0.001; 20 milliunits, F4,12 = 57.7, p < 0.001) (Fig. 6A). To obtain direct evidence for sialic acid removal by neural excitation, we evaluated the effect of neural excitation on desialylation. The Neu5Ac level in the perfusate was increased by perfusion with high-K+ solution for 30 min (one-way repeated measures ANOVA; F4,36 = 3.65, p < 0.001) but was stable by perfusion with ACSF (Fig. 6B). Glutamate and GABA levels in the perfusate, which are indices of neural excitation, were also increased by high-K+ (one-way repeated measures ANOVA; glutamate, F4,36 = 3.96, p < 0.01; GABA, F4,36 = 7.34, p < 0.001) (Fig. 6B). In contrast, the Neu5Ac level was decreased by perfusion with TTX (one-way repeated measures ANOVA; F4,16 = 3.14, p < 0.05) (Fig. 6C). We next evaluated desialylation during hippocampus-dependent memory formation in a contextual fear-conditioning paradigm. In contextual fear conditioning, rats learn the association between a specific environment (context) and an aversive stimulus such as a foot shock. Under the condition of hippocampal perfusion with ACSF, rats were transferred from a home cage to a novel context (foot shock chamber) and presented with a foot shock (1 s, 0.2 mA) every 20 s for 15 min and then returned to the home cage (Fig. 7A). The Neu5Ac level in the hippocampal extracellular space was significantly increased by contextual fear conditioning and decreased to the basal level after the conditioning (one-way repeated measures ANOVA; F8,72 = 3.11, p < 0.01) (Fig. 7B). The rats were transferred to the context again without foot shock 24 h later, and their freezing behavior was observed. Acquisition of contextual fear memory was confirmed by an increase in the freezing time in the foot shock group (Fig. 7C). In the present study, we first investigated the change of sialidase activity by neural activity. Sialidase activity measured with 4MU-Neu5Ac or X-Neu5Ac and FRV LB was increased by high-K+-induced membrane depolarization. Sialidase activity was also increased by chemical LTP induction with forskolin and activation of BDNF signaling, non-NMDARs, or NMDARs. Because these neural activations are involved in calcium signaling, one of the triggers for increment in sialidase activity would be intracellular Ca2+ elevation. In contrast, sialidase activity was decreased by GABA receptor activation, suggesting that sialidase activity is up-regulated and down-regulated depending on the neural activity state. Sialidase activity in incubated solutions was barely detected and was not increased by high-K+ stimulation. Expression levels of sialidase mRNA were significantly decreased in Neu1 and Neu2 by high-K+ stimulation and not significantly changed in Neu4. Although the Neu3 mRNA level showed a tendency to increase (no significance), BTP3-Neu5Ac hardly detected Neu3 activity at pH 7.3 (14Minami A. Saito M. Mamada S. Ieno D. Hikita T. Takahashi T.

Role of sialidase in long-term potentiation at mossy fiber-CA3 synapses and hippocampus-dependent spatial memory.PLoS One. 2016; 11: e0165257Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Thus, we concluded that the increase in sialidase activity with neural excitation appears to be caused not by secreted sialidase or by an increase in sialidase expression. Sialidase changes its subcellular localization with extracellular stimulation. The localization of Neu3 rapidly changes in response to stimulation with epidermal growth factor (24Yamaguchi K. Hata K. Wada T. Moriya S. Miyagi T. Epidermal growth factor-induced mobilization of a ganglioside-specific sialidase (NEU3) to membrane ruffles.Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2006; 346: 484-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Neu1 expressed in T lymphocytes is also relocated to the cell surface by activation with concanavalin A (25Lukong K.E.

Chem. 2001; 276: 46172-46181Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Because intense sialidase activity appeared in the cell membrane of hippocampal CA3 pyramidal cells after neural excitation, the increase in sialidase activity on the surface of neurons may be caused by a change in the subcellular localization of sialidase in response to neural activities. Fast monitoring of sialidase activity with BTP3-Neu5Ac indicated that sialidase activity is immediately increased in response to LTP-inducible high-frequency stimulation with a delay of a few seconds. Sialidase activity may be regulated on the time scale of seconds. The glial-neuronal signaling is regulated by activation of the glutamate receptor in astrocytes. We investigated the effect of glutamate on sialidase activity in astrocytes. Because glutamate increases sialidase activity in rat primary cultured astrocytes, astrocytes are also involved in the neural activity-dependent increase in sialidase activity. In the present study, we investigated the influence of neural excitation on the hippocampal sialylation level. The results of lectin staining showed that the binding of MAA, which recognizes sialylated moieties, to the hippocampus was attenuated after neural excitation. In contrast, the binding of PNA, which recognizes unsialylated moieties, to the hippocampus was strengthened after neural excitation. These findings suggest that the increase in sialidase activity with neural excitation causes desialylation. Because desialylation caused by neural excitation was observed in not only the pyramidal cell layer but also the whole hippocampal region, multiple cell types as well as neurons may be affected by neural activity-dependent desialylation. We also investigated the sialic acid removal from glycans during memory processing. The amount of free sialic acid collected from the hippocampal extracellular space by using in vivo microdialysis was increased depending on the concentration of exogenously applied sialidase, indicating that the desialylation level on the cell surface can be estimated by the amount of extracellular free sialic acid. By using this in vivo desialylation monitoring method, we found that the desialylation level was increased by high-K+ stimulation. We conclude that increment in sialidase activity by neural excitation is sufficient for sialic acid removal from glycans on the extracellular cell surface. In contrast, the desialylation level was decreased by reducing the spontaneous firing rate of neurons with TTX, indicating that sialidase activity is up-regulated even by spontaneous spikes. Removal of sialic acid residues also occurred during hippocampus-dependent memory formation in the contextual fear-conditioning paradigm. Because sialidase is necessary for normal LTP at MF-CA3 pyramidal cell synapses and hippocampal memory (14Minami A. Saito M. Mamada S. Ieno D. Hikita T. Takahashi T. Otsubo T. Ikeda K. Suzuki T. Role of sialidase in long-term potentiation at mossy fiber-CA3 synapses and hippocampus-dependent spatial memory.PLoS One. 2016; 11: e0165257Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), neural activity-dependent desialylation by sialidase would be essential for hippocampal synaptic plasticity and memory.

In Drosophila and vertebrates, DSIF together with negative elongation factor (NELF) associates with RNA polymerase II during early elongation and causes RNA polymerase II to pause in the promoter-proximal region of genes. The mechanism of how DSIF establishes pausing is not known. We constructed Spt5 mutant forms of DSIF and tested their capacity to restore promoter-proximal pausing to DSIF-depleted Drosophila nuclear extracts. The C-terminal repeat region of Spt5, which has been implicated in both inhibition and stimulation of elongation, is dispensable for promoter-proximal pausing. A region encompassing KOW4 and KOW5 of Spt5 is essential for pausing, and mutations in KOW5 specifically shift the location of the pause. RNA cross-linking analysis reveals that KOW5 directly contacts the nascent transcript, and deletion of KOW5 disrupts this interaction. Our results suggest that KOW5 is involved in promoter-proximal pausing through contact with the nascent RNA.

Although IFN-I signal via the interferon-stimulated gene factor 3 (ISGF3) complex consisting of STAT1, STAT2, and IRF9, IFN-I can mediate significant biological effects via ISGF3-independent pathways. For example, the absence of STAT1, STAT2, or IRF9 exacerbates neurological disease in transgenic mice with CNS production of IFN-I. Here we determined the role of IFN-I-driven, ISGF3-independent signaling in regulating global gene expression in STAT1-, STAT2-, or IRF9-deficient murine mixed glial cell cultures (MGCs). Compared with WT, the expression of IFN-α-stimulated genes (ISGs) was reduced in number and magnitude in MGCs that lacked STAT1, STAT2, or IRF9. There were significantly fewer ISGs in the absence of STAT1 or STAT2 versus in the absence of IRF9. The majority of ISGs regulated in the STAT1-, STAT2-, or IRF9-deficient MGCs individually were shared with WT. However, only a minor number of ISGs were common to WT and STAT1-, STAT2-, and IRF9-deficient MGCs. Whereas signal pathway activation in response to IFN-α was rapid and transient in WT MGCs, this was delayed and prolonged and correlated with increased numbers of ISGs expressed at 12 h versus 4 h of IFN-α exposure in all three IFN-I signaling-deficient MGCs. In conclusion, 1) IFN-I can mediate ISG expression in MGCs via ISGF3-independent signaling pathways but with reduced efficiency, with delayed and prolonged kinetics, and is more dependent on STAT1 and STAT2 than IRF9; and 2) signaling pathways not involving STAT1, STAT2, or IRF9 play a minor role only in mediating ISG expression in MGCs.

Phosphorylated STAT1 and STAT2 combine with interferon regulatory factor 9 (IRF9) to form a heterotrimeric transcription complex, termed the interferon-stimulated gene factor 3 (ISGF3). The ISGF3 binds to the interferon-stimulated response element (ISRE) in the promoters of interferon-regulated genes (IRGs) to modulate transcriptional activity. In this complex, STAT1 and IRF9 are required for sequence-specific recognition and stable binding with DNA, whereas STAT2 provides transcriptional modulation but is unable to interact with DNA directly (6Bluyssen H.A.

Evidence has emerged that these IFN-I-driven, STAT1-independent host antiviral responses involve, in large part, non-canonical signaling via STAT2 and IRF9 (14Perry S.T. Buck M.D. Lada S.M.

Further support for such a mechanism comes from a number of in vitro studies demonstrating that in response to IFN-I, STAT2 and IRF9 can form transcriptionally active complexes that modulate IRGs and can mediate antiviral and antibacterial responses (14Perry S.T.

More direct and dramatic demonstration of the impact of non-canonical signaling in mediating IFN-I actions comes from the study of transgenic mice with CNS-targeted production of IFN-α (termed GFAP-IFNα mice). GFAP-IFNα mice with low levels of transgene-encoded IFN-α develop a mild progressive inflammatory encephalopathy from 8–12 months of age (21Akwa Y. Hassett D.E. Eloranta M.L. Sandberg K. Masliah E.

Unexpectedly, markedly more severe disease leading to early death occurs in these animals in the absence of STAT1 (23Wang J. Schreiber R.D. Campbell I.L. STAT1 deficiency unexpectedly and markedly exacerbates the pathophysiological actions of IFN-α in the central nervous system.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2002; 99: 16209-16214Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), STAT2 (24Wang J. Pham-Mitchell N. Schindler C. Campbell I.L.

The type I interferon-α mediates a more severe neurological disease in the absence of the canonical signaling molecule interferon regulatory factor 9.J. Neurosci. 2010; 30: 1149-1157Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). However, the nature of the neurological disease that afflicts the GFAP-IFNα mice deficient for these factors differs in the case of each factor. For example, in the absence of STAT1, GFAP-IFNα mice develop a severe inflammatory encephalopathy with characteristic calcification of the basal ganglia, whereas in the absence of STAT2, these mice develop medulloblastoma. These observations suggest the existence of diverse non-canonical signaling pathways that can mediate adverse actions of IFN-I in the brain, depending on which canonical factor is absent (26Campbell I.L. Cytokine-mediated inflammation, tumorigenesis, and disease-associated JAK/STAT/SOCS signaling circuits in the CNS.Brain Res. Brain Res. Rev. 2005; 48: 166-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The complex milieu of the inflamed CNS does not allow easy differentiation between primary and secondary responses and effects due to CNS resident cells versus infiltrating leukocytes (where present). Transcriptional profiling of cultured murine neurons revealed that these cells do not respond to IFN-I in the absence of STAT1 (27Wang J. Campbell I.L. Innate STAT1-dependent genomic response of neurons to the antiviral cytokine α interferon.J. Virol. 2005; 79: 8295-8302Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) and therefore are unlikely to be direct targets of IFN-I action in GFAP-IFNα mice that lack STAT1. In contrast, primary murine mixed glial cell cultures (MGCs) that consist primarily of astrocytes with a low number of microglia can signal independently of either STAT1 or IRF9 in response to IFN-α (28Ousman S.S. Wang J. Campbell I.L. Differential regulation of interferon regulatory factor (IRF)-7 and IRF-9 gene expression in the central nervous system during viral infection.J. Virol. 2005; 79: 7514-7527Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), suggesting that these cells represent potential effector cells of IFN-I actions in ISGF3-independent signaling. However, it remains largely unknown to what extent non-canonical, ISGF3-indpendent signaling pathways mediate the functional effects of IFN-I. As a means to addressing this issue, the objective of this study was to investigate the genome-wide transcriptional regulation and signal transduction pathway dynamics in MGCs in response to IFN-α in the presence or absence of each of the ISGF3 canonical signaling molecules STAT1, STAT2, or IRF9. Primary MGCs from WT and STAT1-, STAT2-, or IRF9-deficient mice cultured for one passage showed no overt morphological differences and had comparable growth rates and percentage of microglia (data not shown). Initially, we determined whether the absence of STAT1, STAT2, or IRF9 altered the expression of genes in untreated MGCs. Compared with WT MGCs, the expression of 28 genes was decreased and that of 24 genes was increased in cultures deficient for one of the ISGF3 components (Fig. 1). Of the 28 genes with decreased expression, 12 (Ifi27, Usp18, Rtp4, Ifit1, Oasl2, Rsad2, Isg15, Lgals3bp, Brd4, Trim30, D12Ertd647e, and Xaf1) were expressed at significantly lower levels in the STAT1-, STAT2-, and IRF9-deficient MGCs, whereas the majority of the remaining genes that had decreased expression were observed in the IRF9-deficient MGCs (Fig. 1 and Table 1).

Forster S. Auchettl K. Hertzog P.J. INTERFEROME: the database of interferon regulated genes.Nucleic Acids Res. 2009; 37: D852-D857Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). In addition, DAVID bioinformatics analysis classified 17 of these 52 genes into three functional biological groups: 1) antiviral response (genes with decreased expression in the IFN-I deficient cells (Isg15, Ifi27, Ifit1, Ifit3, Oasl2, Rsad2, and Trim25) and genes with increased expression in IFN-I signaling-deficient cells (Lcn2 and Ifitm1)), 2) proteolysis (genes with decreased expression in the IFN-I signaling-deficient cells (Isg15, Usp18, Rnf41, and Mid1) and genes with increased expression in IFN-I signaling-deficient cells (Ctse, Mela, and C1r), and 3) retroviral envelope polyprotein (genes with increased expression in STAT1-deficient cells (Mela, LOC433762, and murine leukemia virus isolate 10 envelope protein mRNA). Overall, these findings showed that all three canonical IFN-I signaling molecules regulate the constitutive expression of a subset of genes that are involved in the antiviral response, proteolysis, and retroviral envelope polyprotein production. To examine the requirement for STAT1, STAT2, or IRF9 in IRG expression, WT and STAT1-, STAT2-, and IRF9-deficient MGCs were treated with IFN-α for 4 or 12 h. Treatment of WT MGCs with IFN-α for 4 h significantly increased the expression of 268 genes (Fig. 2A). In comparison, the response to IFN-α was severely blunted with significantly fewer genes up-regulated in the absence of STAT1 (17 genes), STAT2 (8 genes), or IRF9 (38 genes). All of the genes up-regulated in the STAT1- and STAT2-deficient cells as well as 28 genes in the IRF9 KO MGCs were also increased in WT MGCs. Interestingly, the expression of 10 genes was increased in IRF9 KO MGCs only (see below for details). In WT MGCs after 12 h of treatment, the number of ISGs decreased to 137 (Fig. 2B), of which 123 were also increased at 4 h of treatment, whereas 14 ISGs were present at 12 h of treatment only (Fig. 2D). In contrast to WT MGCs, the number of ISGs after 12 h of IFN-α treatment increased in STAT1-deficient (33 genes), STAT2-deficient (21 genes), or IRF9-deficient (113 genes) MGCs. Of these genes, all in the STAT1 KO cells, 20 in the STAT2 KO cells, and 66 in the IRF9 KO cells were also up-regulated in WT MGCs (Fig. 2B). The expression of one gene was increased in both STAT2 KO and IRF9 KO MGCs, whereas the expression of 47 genes was increased in IRF9 KO MGCs only (Fig. 2B). Notably, in all three IFN-I signaling factor-deficient MGCs, there was a delayed response to IFN-α with increased expression of the majority of genes occurring after 12 h of treatment (Fig. 2, E–G). In summary, these results indicated that although considerably reduced compared with WT, IFN-α can mediate the increased expression of a number of genes with either prolonged or delayed kinetics in MGCs via ISGF3-independent signaling pathways. Finally, the number of ISGs was significantly less in STAT1 KO and STAT2 KO MGCs than in IRF9 KO MGCs, suggesting that the regulation of ISGF3-independent genes in response to IFN-α is mainly dependent on STAT1 and STAT2 signaling and to a lesser extent on IRF9 signaling. To better understand the regulation of the ISGs in the context of dependence on STAT1, STAT2, or IRF9, we combined both time points, as shown in Fig. 2C. Of the 283 ISGs in WT, 50 ISGs were found to be shared with STAT1-, STAT2-, and IRF9-deficient MGCs, whereas 45 ISGs were common to IRF9-deficient MGCs, indicating that ISGF3 and non-ISGF3 IFN-I signaling pathways regulate a substantial number (i.e. 95) of the same target genes. Of these 95 genes, the expression of only 9 genes was increased in WT and in all three IFN-I signaling-deficient MGCs. This small subset of genes were classified as STAT1-, STAT2-, and IRF9-independent ISGs and indicated that there is only minor involvement of other signaling factors, such as STAT3 and ERK1/2, in IRG expression in MGCs. The expression of the remaining 86 ISGs required at least one of the remaining ISGF3 factors. More than 30% of ISGs regulated in WT MGCs were also found to be regulated in at least one of the IFN-I signaling factor-deficient MGCs, demonstrating the ISGF3-independent regulation of these genes by IFN-α in these cells (Fig. 3). It should be noted that the expression level of these 95 genes was higher in WT MGCs than in the signaling factor-deficient MGCs, showing that the optimal expression of these genes is dependent on ISGF3. We next analyzed the IFN-α-regulated genes with decreased expression in the MGCs (Fig. 4). In WT MGCs, treatment with IFN-α for 4 and 12 h caused decreased expression of 12 genes (C5ar1, Gls, Hpgd, Iqub, Sesn1, Gprin2, Ablim1, Fbxo16, Dbndd1, Klhl24, and two ESTs) and two genes (Gls and one EST), respectively, with Gls being down-regulated at both time points (Fig. 4, A and B). Interestingly, no genes showed decreased expression in IFN-α-treated STAT1 KO MGCs at either treatment time. In STAT2 KO MGCs, the expression of eight genes (Arhgap5, Lpar4, Copg2as2, Tmed5, Atrx, Ccdc88a, Smc4, and Casp8ap2) was down-regulated at 4 h, but no genes were decreased in expression at 12 h. In IRF9 KO MGCs, the expression of five genes (Mtss1, Kcnq1ot, D17Ertd165e, Dzip1, and D2Ertd105e) and three genes (Hpgd, Cx3cr1, and Gls) was decreased at 4 and 12 h, respectively, with no genes down-regulated at both time points. The expression of two genes (Gls and Hpgd) was down-regulated in both WT and IRF9 KO MGCs following treatment with IFN-α, irrespective of the time (Fig. 3C). The expression of 27 transcripts that was down-regulated in WT MGCs and/or MGCs that lacked either STAT2 or IRF9 is shown in Fig. 3D. Overall, these findings indicated that in contrast to ISGs, the number of genes whose expression was down-regulated in MGCs in response to IFN-α was considerably less and was dependent on STAT1. The Ingenuity pathway analysis (IPA) tool (Ingenuity Systems, Redwood City, CA) was used to cluster genes according to their biological processes. The 95 IFN-α-stimulated, ISGF3-independent ISGs were clustered into a number of functional groups, including IFN signaling, antigen presentation, activation of IRFs by cytosolic pattern recognition receptors, retinoic acid-mediated apoptosis, protein ubiquitination, and pattern recognition receptor recognition of bacteria and viruses (Table 3). Similarly, the 188 ISGF3-dependent gene transcripts whose expression was increased only in WT cells also belonged to these functional groups. Hence, these results implied that ISGF3-independent IFN-I signaling pathways could generate, in part, the classical IFN-α response, especially related to antiviral actions.TABLE 3Ingenuity pathway analysis of functional groups enriched in ISGF3-independent genesIngenuity functional grouppISGF3-independent genesInterferon signaling8.20E−12Ifi35, Ifit3, Irf9, Irf1, Oasl2, Psmb8, Stat1, Stat2, Tap1Antigen presentation1.60E−08HLA-B, HLA-E, Psmb8, Psmb9, Tap1, Tap2Activation of IRF by cytosolic pattern recognition receptors2.50E−08Ddx58, Ifih1, Irf7, Irf9, Stat1, Stat2, Zbp1Retinoic acid-mediated apoptosis signaling2.30E−07Irf1, Parp3, Parp9, Parp12, Parp14, Zc3hav1Protein ubiquitination3.80E−06HLA-B, Psmb8, Psmb9, Psmb10, Psme1, Psme2, Tap1, Tap2, Ube2l6, Usp18Role of pattern recognition receptors in recognition of bacteria and virus2.60E−05Casp1, Ddx58, Ifih1, Irf7, Myd88, Nod1, Oasl2 Open table in a new tab The IPA tool was also used to identify potential upstream regulators of these genes.

Genetic risk factors of calciphylaxis have never been studied before. Methods We investigated 10 target genes using a tagging SNP approach: the genes encoding CD73/ ecto-5'-nucleotidase (purinergic pathway), Matrix Gla protein, Fetuin A, Bone Gla protein, VKORC1 (all related to intrinsic calcification inhibition), calcium-sensing receptor, FGF23, Klotho, vitamin D receptor, stanniocalcin 1 (all related to CKD-MBD). 144 dialysis patients from the German calciphylaxis registry were compared with 370 dialysis patients without history of CUA. Genotyping was performed using iPLEX Gold MassARRAY(Sequenom, San Diego, USA), KASP genotyping chemistry (LGC, Teddington, Middlesex, UK) or sequencing. Statistical analysis comprised logistic regression analysis with adjustment for age and sex. Results 165 SNPs were finally analyzed and 6 SNPs were associated with higher probability for calciphylaxis (OR>1) in our cohort. Nine SNPs of three genes (CD73, FGF23 and Vitamin D receptor) reached nominal significance (p< 0.05), but did not reach statistical significance after correction for multiple testing. Of the CD73 gene, rs4431401 (OR = 1.71, 95%CI 1.08–2.17, p = 0.023) and rs9444348 (OR = 1.48, 95% CI 1.11–1.97, p = 0.008) were associated with a higher probability for CUA. Of the FGF23 and VDR genes, rs7310492, rs11063118, rs13312747 and rs17882106 were associated with a higher probability for CUA. Conclusion Polymorphisms in the genes encoding CD73, vitamin D receptor and FGF23 may play a role in calciphylaxis development. Although our study is the largest genetic study on calciphylaxis, it is limited by the low sample sizes. It therefore requires replication in other cohorts if available."
https://openalex.org/W2588688173,"The TP53 gene plays essential roles in cancer. Conventionally, wild type (WT) p53 is thought to prevent cancer development and metastasis formation, while mutant p53 has transforming abilities. However, clinical studies failed to establish p53 mutation status as an unequivocal predictive or prognostic factor of cancer progression. The recent discovery of p53 isoforms that can differentially regulate cell cycle arrest and apoptosis suggests that their expression, rather than p53 mutations, could be a more clinically relevant biomarker in patients with cancer. In this study, we show that the p53 isoform delta133p53ß is involved in regulating the apoptotic response in colorectal cancer cell lines. We first demonstrate delta133p53ß association with the small GTPase RhoB, a well-described anti-apoptotic protein. We then show that, by inhibiting RhoB activity, delta133p53ß protects cells from camptothecin-induced apoptosis. Moreover, we found that high delta133p53 mRNA expression levels are correlated with higher risk of recurrence in a series of patients with locally advanced rectal cancer (n = 36). Our findings describe how a WT TP53 isoform can act as an oncogene and add a new layer to the already complex p53 signaling network."
https://openalex.org/W2588119204,"Central nervous system tumors (CNS) are the most frequent solid tumor in children. Causes of CNS tumors are mainly unknown and only 5% of the cases can be explained by genetic predisposition. We studied the effects of environmental exposure on the incidence of CNS tumors in children by subtype, according to exposure to industrial and/or urban environment, exposure to crops and according to socio-economic status of the child.We carried out a population-based case-control study of CNS tumors in Spain, covering 714 incident cases collected from the Spanish Registry of Childhood Tumors (period 1996-2011) and 4284 controls, individually matched by year of birth, sex, and autonomous region of residence. We built a covariate to approximate the exposure to industrial and/or urban environment and a covariate for the exposure to crops (GCI) using the coordinates of the home addresses of the children. We used the 2001 Census to obtain information about socio-economic status (SES). We fitted logistic regression models to estimate odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (95%CIs).The results for all CNS tumors showed an excess risk (OR = 1.37; 95%CI = 1.09-1.73) for SES, i.e., children living in the least deprived areas had 37% more risk of CNS tumor than children living in the most deprived areas. For GCI, an increase of 10% in crop surface in the 1-km buffer around the residence implied an increase of 22% in the OR (OR = 1.22; 95%CI = 1.15-1.29). Children living in the intersection of industrial and urban areas could have a greater risk of CNS tumors than children who live outside these areas (OR = 1.20; 95%CI = 0.82-1.77). Living in urban areas (OR = 0.90; 95%CI = 0.65-1.24) or industrial areas (OR = 0.96; 95%CI = 0.81-1.77) did not seem to increase the risk for all CNS tumors together. By subtype, Astrocytomas, Intracranial and intraspinal embryonal tumors, and other gliomas showed similar results.Our results suggest that higher socioeconomic status and exposure to crops could increase the risk of CNS tumors in children."

Data coming from Thomson Reuters InCites are collected to support the evaluation. The work has contributed new framework to the issue of university scientific research ability evaluation. At first, we have established a hierarchical structure to show the factors that impact the evaluation of university scientific research ability. Then, a new MCDM method called D-AHP model is used to implement the evaluation and ranking of different university alliances, in which a data-driven approach is proposed to automatically generate the D numbers preference relations. Next, a sensitivity analysis has been given to show the impact of weights of factors and sub-factors on the evaluation result. At last, the results obtained by using different methods are compared and discussed to verify the effectiveness and reasonability of this study, and some suggestions are given to promote China’s scientific research ability."

It is a member of the neurotransmitter:sodium:symporters, which are crucial for synaptic transmission. Compared with all other neurotransmitter:sodium:symporters, GAT-1 and other members of the GABA transporter subfamily all contain an extra amino acid residue at or near a conserved glycine in transmembrane segment 10. Therefore, we studied the functional impact of deletion and replacement mutants of Gly-457 and its two adjacent residues in GAT-1. The glycine replacement mutants were devoid of transport activity, but remarkably the deletion mutant was active, as were mutants obtained by deleting positions on either side of Gly-457. However, the inward rectification of GABA-induced transport currents by all three deletion mutants was diminished, and the charge-to-flux ratio was increased by more than 2.5-fold, both of which indicate substantial uncoupled transport. These observations suggest that the deletions render the transporters less tightly packed. Consistent with this interpretation, the inactive G457A mutant was partially rescued by removing the adjacent serine residue. Moreover, the activity of several gating mutants was also partially rescued upon deletion of Gly-457. Structural modeling showed that the stretch surrounding Gly-457 is likely to form a π-helix. Our data indicate that the “extra” residue in transmembrane domain 10 of the GABA transporter GAT-1 provides extra bulk, probably in the form of a π-helix, which is required for stringent gating and tight coupling of ion and substrate fluxes in the GABA transporter family.

https://openalex.org/W2588717998,"B-cell receptor (BCR)-mediated signaling plays an important role in the pathogenesis of a subset of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), and novel agents targeting this pathway are now in clinical use. We have previously identified a signature of active BCR signaling on formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded specimens using quantitative immunofluorescence, allowing for identification of patients who might benefit from anti-BCR therapies. We sought to characterize the clinicopathologic significance of active BCR signaling in DLBCL by correlating measures of signaling intensity with clinical features and various tumor cell characteristics. High MYC and concurrent high MYC and BCL2 double-expression was positively correlated with individual markers of active BCR signaling and cases with MYC/BCL2 double-expression showed overall greater BCR activation compared to cases lacking double-expression. Our findings suggest that the BCR signaling pathway may be more active in MYC/BCL2 double-expressor DLBCL and may represent a rational therapeutic target in this aggressive DLBCL subgroup."
https://openalex.org/W2589028645,"Active cellular transporters of harmful agents-multidrug resistance (mdr) proteins-are present in tumor, stem and endothelial cells, among others. While mdr proteins are broadly studied in tumor cells, their role in non-tumor cells and the significance of their action not connected with removal of harmful xenobiotics is less extensively documented. Proper assessment of mdr proteins expression is difficult. Mdr mRNA presence is most often evaluated but that does not necessarily correlate with the protein level. The protein expression itself is difficult to determine; usually cells with mdr overexpression are studied, not cells under physiological conditions, in which a low expression level of mdr protein is often insufficient for detection in vitro. Various methods are used to identify mdr mRNA and protein expression, together with functional tests demonstrating their biological drug transporting activities. Data comparing different methods of investigating expression of mdr mRNAs and their corresponding proteins are still scarce. In this article we present the results of a study concerning mdr mRNA and protein expression. Our goal was to search for the best method to investigate the expression level and functional activity of five selected mdr proteins-MDR1, BCRP, MRP1, MRP4 and MRP5-in established in vitro cell lines of human endothelial cells (ECs) and their progenitors. Endothelial cells demonstrated mdr presence at the mRNA level, which was not always confirmed at the protein level or in functional tests. Therefore, several different assays had to be applied for evaluation of mdr proteins expression and functions in endothelial cells. Among them functional tests seemed to be the most conclusive, although not very specific."
https://openalex.org/W2588654536,"In this study, we investigated the relationship between tryptophan-5-hydroxytryptamine metabolism, depressive disorder, and gastrointestinal dysfunction in rats after myocardial infarction. Our goal was to elucidate the physiopathologic bases of somatic/psychiatric depression symptoms after myocardial infarction. A myocardial infarction model was established by permanent occlusion of the left anterior descending coronary artery. Depression-like behavior was evaluated using the sucrose preference test, open field test, and forced swim test. Gastric retention and intestinal transit were detected using the carbon powder labeling method. Immunohistochemical staining was used to detect indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase expression in the hippocampus and ileum. High-performance liquid chromatography with fluorescence and ultraviolet detection determined the levels of 5-hydroxytryptamine, its precursor tryptophan, and its metabolite 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid in the hippocampus, distal ileum, and peripheral blood. All data were analyzed using one-way analyses of variance. Three weeks after arterial occlusion, rats in the model group began to exhibit depression-like symptoms. For example, the rate of sucrose consumption was reduced, the total and central distance traveled in the open field test were reduced, and immobility time was increased, while swimming, struggling and latency to immobility were decreased in the forced swim test. Moreover, the gastric retention rate and gastrointestinal transit rate were increased in the model group. Expression of indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase was increased in the hippocampus and ileum, whereas 5-hydroxytryptamine metabolism was decreased, resulting in lower 5-hydroxytryptamine and 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid levels in the hippocampus and higher levels in the ileum. Depressive disorder and gastrointestinal dysfunction after myocardial infarction involve abnormal tryptophan-5-hydroxytryptamine metabolism, which may explain the somatic, cognitive, and psychiatric symptoms of depression commonly observed after myocardial infarction. Peripheral 5-hydroxytryptamine is an important substance in the gut-brain axis, and its abnormal metabolism is a critical finding after myocardial infarct."
https://openalex.org/W2588789635,"G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) regulate many animal behaviors. GPCR signaling is mediated by agonist-promoted interactions of GPCRs with heterotrimeric G proteins, GPCR kinases (GRKs), and arrestins. To further elucidate the role of GRKs in regulating GPCR-mediated behaviors, we utilized the genetic model system Caenorhabditis elegans. Our studies demonstrate that grk-2 loss-of-function strains are egg laying-defective and contain low levels of serotonin (5-HT) and high levels of the 5-HT metabolite 5-hydroxyindole acetic acid (5-HIAA). The egg laying defect could be rescued by the expression of wild type but not by catalytically inactive grk-2 or by the selective expression of grk-2 in hermaphrodite-specific neurons. The addition of 5-HT or inhibition of 5-HT metabolism also rescued the egg laying defect. Furthermore, we demonstrate that AMX-2 is the primary monoamine oxidase that metabolizes 5-HT in C. elegans, and we also found that grk-2 loss-of-function strains have abnormally high levels of AMX-2 compared with wild-type nematodes. Interestingly, GRK-2 was also found to interact with and promote the phosphorylation of AMX-2. Additional studies reveal that 5-HIAA functions to inhibit egg laying in a manner dependent on the 5-HT receptor SER-1 and the G protein GOA-1. These results demonstrate that GRK-2 modulates 5-HT metabolism by regulating AMX-2 function and that 5-HIAA may function in the SER-1 signaling pathway.

These results demonstrate that GRK-2 modulates 5-HT metabolism by regulating AMX-2 function and that 5-HIAA may function in the SER-1 signaling pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2588425663,"Enveloped viruses utilize fusion (F) proteins studding the surface of the virus to facilitate membrane fusion with a target cell membrane. Fusion of the viral envelope with a cellular membrane is required for release of viral genomic material, so the virus can ultimately reproduce and spread. To drive fusion, the F protein undergoes an irreversible conformational change, transitioning from a metastable pre-fusion conformation to a more thermodynamically stable post-fusion structure. Understanding the elements that control stability of the pre-fusion state and triggering to the post-fusion conformation is important for understanding F protein function. Mutations in F protein transmembrane (TM) domains implicated the TM domain in the fusion process, but the structural and molecular details in fusion remain unclear. Previously, analytical ultracentrifugation was utilized to demonstrate that isolated TM domains of Hendra virus F protein associate in a monomer-trimer equilibrium (Smith, E. C., Smith, S. E., Carter, J. R., Webb, S. R., Gibson, K. M., Hellman, L. M., Fried, M. G., and Dutch, R. E. (2013) J. Biol. Chem. 288, 35726–35735). To determine factors driving this association, 140 paramyxovirus F protein TM domain sequences were analyzed. A heptad repeat of β-branched residues was found, and analysis of the Hendra virus F TM domain revealed a heptad repeat leucine-isoleucine zipper motif (LIZ). Replacement of the LIZ with alanine resulted in dramatically reduced TM-TM association. Mutation of the LIZ in the whole protein resulted in decreased protein stability, including pre-fusion conformation stability. Together, our data suggest that the heptad repeat LIZ contributed to TM-TM association and is important for F protein function and pre-fusion stability."
https://openalex.org/W2587828849,"The origin and function of exaggerated traits exhibited by a great number of species with sexual dimorphism remain largely unexplored. The usual model considered as the evolutionary mechanism for the development of these structures is sexual selection. The nature of growth of the postocular flange (POF) in three species of the dobsonfly genus Platyneuromus (Megaloptera, Corydalidae, Corydalinae) is analyzed to explore sexual size dimorphism and allometric scaling. Results involve positive allometry of POF in males of two species, and negative allometry in males of one species, in general with a female-biased sexual dimorphism. We suggest an ancestral condition of dual incipient ornamentation in Platyneuromus, with a subsequent departure of size and shape of POF in males, triggered by sexual selection. Different sexual selection intensities may explain the parallel or divergent growth of POF within the scheme of dual ornamentation. Empirical behavioral data as well as a phylogenetic framework are necessary to clarify possible causes of phenotypic development, time of origin, and evolution of the POF."

Dietary intakes were evaluated with a semi-quantitative food-frequency questionnaire (FFQ) and Mediterranean dietary quality index (Med-DQI) was assessed. Anthropometric assessments and blood pressure measurement were performed. Biochemical assays including fasting serum glucose (FSG), matrix metalloproteinase-3 (MMP-3), liver enzymes and lipid profiles were also assessed. Polymorphism of +405 G/C VEGF gene was determined utilizing polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragments length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) method.Serum high density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-C) was significantly lower and low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), triglyceride (TG), total cholesterol (TC) concentrations and FSG were significantly higher in metabolic syndrome patients compared with control group (P < 0.05). Metabolic syndrome group with high consumption of ""cholesterol"" had significantly upper serum TG; also high consumption of ""fish"" and ""vegetables-fruits"" was associated with a significantly lower serum LDL concentrations. In metabolic syndrome patients with CC genotype, mean score of ""saturated fatty acid"" subgroup was significantly higher compared with other genotypes; whereas, in healthy individuals, mean score of ""fruit-vegetable"" subgroup in individuals of CC and GG genotype was significantly higher (P<0.05).Our findings indicated a significant relationship between Mediterranean dietary quality index and both anthropometric and metabolic risk factors. We also indicated a higher ""saturated fatty acid"" intake in CC genotype among metabolic syndrome patients."
https://openalex.org/W2588732926,"The 4E10 antibody displays an extreme breadth of HIV-1 neutralization and therefore constitutes a suitable model system for structure-guided vaccine design and immunotherapeutics against AIDS. In this regard, the relevance of autoreactivity with membrane lipids for the biological function of this antibody is still a subject of controversy. To address this dispute, herein we have compared the membrane partitioning ability of the 4E10 antibody and several of its variants, which were mutated at the region of the paratope surface in contact with the membrane interface. We first employed a physical separation approach (vesicle flotation) and subsequently carried out quantitative fluorescence measurements in an intact system (spectroscopic titration), using 4E10 Fab labeled with a polarity-sensitive fluorescent probe. Moreover, recognition of epitope peptide in membrane was demonstrated by photo-cross-linking assays using a Fab that incorporated the genetically encoded unnatural amino acid p-benzoylphenylalanine. The experimental data ruled out that the proposed stereospecific recognition of viral lipids was necessary for the function of the antibody. In contrast, our data suggest that nonspecific electrostatic interactions between basic residues of 4E10 and acidic phospholipids in the membranes contribute to the observed biological function. Moreover, the energetics of membrane partitioning indicated that 4E10 behaves as a peripheral membrane protein, tightening the binding to the ligand epitope inserted in the viral membrane. The implications of these findings for the natural production and biological function of this antibody are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2589010019,"Proteins of the Src homology and collagen (Shc) family are typically involved in signal transduction events involving Ras/MAPK and PI3K/Akt pathways. In the nervous system, they function proximal to the neurotrophic factors that regulate cell survival, differentiation, and neuron-specific characteristics. The least characterized homolog, ShcD, is robustly expressed in the developing and mature nervous system, but its contributions to neural cell circuitry are largely uncharted. We now report that ShcD binds to active Ret, TrkA, and TrkB neurotrophic factor receptors predominantly via its phosphotyrosine-binding (PTB) domain. However, in contrast to the conventional Shc adaptors, ShcD suppresses distal phosphorylation of the Erk MAPK. Accordingly, genetic knock-out of mouse ShcD enhances Erk phosphorylation in the brain. In cultured cells, this capacity is tightly aligned to phosphorylation of ShcD CH1 region tyrosine motifs, which serve as docking platforms for signal transducers, such as Grb2. Erk suppression is relieved through independent mutagenesis of the PTB domain and the CH1 tyrosine residues, and successive substitution of these tyrosines breaks the interaction between ShcD and Grb2, thereby promoting TrkB-Grb2 association. Erk phosphorylation can also be restored in the presence of wild type ShcD through Grb2 overexpression. Conversely, mutation of the ShcD SH2 domain results in enhanced repression of Erk. Although the SH2 domain is a less common binding interface in Shc proteins, we demonstrate that it associates with the Ptpn11 (Shp2) phosphatase, which in turn regulates ShcD tyrosine phosphorylation. We therefore propose a model whereby ShcD competes with neurotrophic receptors for Grb2 binding and opposes activation of the MAPK cascade.

Four Shc paralogs have been described in mammals, commonly designated Shc/ShcA/Shc1, ShcB/Sck/Shc2, ShcC/N-Shc/Rai/Shc3, and ShcD/RaLP/Shc4 in chronological order of their discovery (2Wills M.K.

ShcA is the best characterized and most ubiquitous member of the family with the exception of the mature nervous system in which it is restricted to neurogenic regions (3Ponti G. Reitano E. Aimar P.

Despite their conserved structure and common binding partners, the Shc adaptors and their isoforms can give rise to distinct downstream signals and make unique physiological contributions. The most striking example of this phenomenon is the functional disparity between the canonical p46/p52 ShcA isoforms, which augment transduction events at the membrane, and p66 ShcA, which functions as a mitochondrial redox sensor that contributes to apoptosis (11Gertz M. Steegborn C. The lifespan-regulator p66Shc in mitochondria: redox enzyme or redox sensor?.Antioxid. Redox Signal. 2010; 13: 1417-1428Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar).

Shc non-redundancy is also evident in the developing nervous system where a molecular switch demarcates progenitor cell proliferation and terminal differentiation. During the transition, levels of ShcA decrease, whereas ShcC increases and achieves maximal expression in postmitotic neurons (14Conti L. Sipione S. Magrassi L. Bonfanti L. Rigamonti D. Pettirossi V. Peschanski M. Haddad B. Pelicci P. Milanesi G. Pelicci G. Cattaneo E. Shc signaling in differentiating neural progenitor cells.Nat. Neurosci. 2001; 4: 579-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). ShcC appears to support survival and maturation through specific engagement of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt pathway and prolonged activation of Erk1/2 (p44/p42) mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), respectively (14Conti L. Sipione S. Magrassi L. Bonfanti L. Rigamonti D. Pettirossi V. Peschanski M. Haddad B. Pelicci P. Milanesi G. Pelicci G. Cattaneo E. Shc signaling in differentiating neural progenitor cells.Nat. Neurosci. 2001; 4: 579-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). In the nervous system, such responses are elicited by the class of signaling ligands known as neurotrophic factors. Together with their companion receptors, these factors support neurons during development and through maturity, influencing common cellular characteristics like survival while also guiding specialized functions, such as axonal pathfinding and synaptic plasticity (15Ledda F. Paratcha G. Assembly of neuronal connectivity by neurotrophic factors and leucine-rich repeat proteins.Front. Cell. Neurosci. 2016; 10: 199Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Two prominent families in this growth factor class are the neurotrophins and their corresponding tropomyosin-related kinase (Trk) RTKs and the glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor family ligands with their multicomponent receptor consisting of the rearranged during transformation (Ret) RTK and one of four ligand-specific glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor family receptor α co-receptors (16Reichardt L.F.

Novel functions and signalling pathways for GDNF.J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 3855-3862Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar). Collectively, neurotrophic signaling has far reaching implications in organism morphogenesis, maintenance, and a spectrum of diseases, including Alzheimer's, depression, inflammatory pain, and cancer (18Allen S.J. Dawbarn D. Clinical relevance of the neurotrophins and their receptors.Clin. Sci. 2006; 110: 175-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). Understanding the signaling networks that underlie aberrant behavior is therefore a priority. To that end, ShcA, -B, and -C bind Trk and Ret RTKs and augment Ras/MAPK and/or PI3K/Akt signaling (19Liu H.-Y. Meakin S.O. ShcB and ShcC activation by the Trk family of receptor tyrosine kinases.J.

Little is known of the neuronal contributions of the recently discovered ShcD, although its potential to bind activated Ret and Trk was revealed in a high-throughput peptide screen (22Smith M.J. Hardy W.R. Murphy J.M. Jones N. Pawson T. Screening for PTB domain binding partners and ligand specificity using proteome-derived NPXY peptide arrays.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 8461-8474Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), and associations with TrkB have been demonstrated in vitro (23You Y. Li W. Gong Y. Yin B. Qiang B. Yuan J. Peng X. ShcD interacts with TrkB via its PTB and SH2 domains and regulates BDNF-induced MAPK activation.BMB Rep. 2010; 43: 485-490Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We have previously shown that ShcD elicits ligand-independent phosphorylation of the epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor (EGFR) (24Wills M.K. Tong J. Tremblay S.L. Moran M.F. Jones N. The ShcD signaling adaptor facilitates ligand-independent phosphorylation of the EGF receptor.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2014; 25: 739-752Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) and promotes its accumulation in juxtanuclear endocytic recycling compartments, 9M. K. B. Wills, H. R. Lau, and N. Jones, submitted manuscript. thereby establishing a precedent for non-canonical engagement of ShcD in signaling circuitry. We now report that ShcD suppresses Erk activation in the context of Ret, TrkA, and TrkB. Further investigation with TrkB revealed that the phenotype arises from Grb2 sequestration and that the Ptpn11 (Shp2) phosphatase regulates CH1 region phosphotyrosine residues to oppose this phenomenon. ShcD thus appears to function as a signaling platform that facilitates negative regulation of Erk. Because of the robust expression of ShcD in the nervous system (8Hawley S.P. Wills M.K. Rabalski A.J. Bendall A.J. Jones N. Expression patterns of ShcD and Shc family adaptor proteins during mouse embryonic development.Dev. Dyn. 2011; 240: 221-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 9Jones N. Hardy W.R. Friese M.B. Jorgensen C. Smith M.J. Woody N.M. Burden S.J. Pawson T. Analysis of a Shc family adaptor protein, ShcD/Shc4, that associates with muscle-specific kinase.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2007; 27: 4759-4773Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), we set out to investigate findings from our peptide screen suggesting that the adaptor binds to Ret and Trk neurotrophic receptors (22Smith M.J. Hardy W.R. Murphy J.M. Jones N. Pawson T. Screening for PTB domain binding partners and ligand specificity using proteome-derived NPXY peptide arrays.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 8461-8474Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). To this end, we introduced the oncogenic Ret MEN2A receptor (kinase-active) or its kinase-dead (KD) counterpart into human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293T cells along with ShcD to assess protein-protein interactions by way of immunoprecipitation. Ret MEN2A is characterized by a point mutation in the extracellular region that promotes homodimerization and autoactivation (25Santoro M. Carlomagno F. Romano A. Bottaro D.P. Dathan N.A. Grieco M. Fusco A. Vecchio G. Matoskova B. Kraus M.H. Activation of RET as a dominant transforming gene by germline mutations of MEN2A and MEN2B.Science. 1995; 267: 381-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (796) Google Scholar), and we first confirmed that the kinase was indeed constitutively active in our expression system (Fig. 1A). Tyrosine phosphorylation of the receptor was found to be required for Ret-ShcD association (Fig. 1A) as suggested previously by the peptide array (22Smith M.J. Hardy W.R. Murphy J.M. Jones N. Pawson T. Screening for PTB domain binding partners and ligand specificity using proteome-derived NPXY peptide arrays.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 8461-8474Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). We next confirmed that overexpression of the wild type TrkA and TrkB receptors in HEK 293T cells was sufficient to promote their tyrosine phosphoactivation (Fig. 1, B and C, fourth panel). ShcD and the positive control, ShcA, were each independently able to bind the wild type TrkA and TrkB receptors, but neither adaptor co-precipitated the kinase-dead variant, thereby implicating tyrosine phosphorylation as a prerequisite for association (Fig. 1, B and C). To identify regions of ShcD that mediate its interactions with neurotrophic receptors, we subsequently introduced ShcD mutants containing a disabled PTB domain (PTB*), SH2 domain (SH2*), or tandem tyrosine-to-phenylalanine substitutions in the CH1 region (Y374F/Y375F/Y403F/Y413F/Y424F/Y465F (Y6F)) (depicted schematically in Fig. 1D) with the RTKs. Disrupting the tyrosine-binding functionality of the ShcD PTB domain substantially impeded co-precipitation of all three RTKs, whereas the SH2 domain was a minor factor in the interaction (Fig. 1, E, F, and G). Compound ablation of both domains elicited the most profound loss of receptor-adaptor association. By contrast, the ShcD Y6F variant retained the full Ret-, TrkA-, and TrkB-binding capacities of wild type ShcD (Fig. 1, E, F, and G). Thus, the PTB domain appears to be the primary point of contact between neurotrophin receptors and ShcD with some additional influence of the SH2 domain. Although traditional Shc adaptors are well established mediators of MAPK signaling, the contribution of ShcD to canonical pathways has been less clear (24Wills M.K. Tong J. Tremblay S.L. Moran M.F. Jones N. The ShcD signaling adaptor facilitates ligand-independent phosphorylation of the EGF receptor.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2014; 25: 739-752Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). We therefore profiled Akt and Erk phosphorylation in response to active neurotrophic receptors co-expressed with ShcD variants. Proximal to Ret, TrkA, and TrkB, wild type ShcD was itself found to be phosphorylated in keeping with the canonical response of Shc family proteins (Fig. 2). It nevertheless failed to influence Akt, which maintained the same degree of phosphorylation across the panel of conditions and ShcD mutants tested (Fig. 2, A, B, and C). Surprisingly, however, wild type ShcD attenuated Erk1/2 phosphorylation (pErk) distal to all three receptors (Fig. 2, A, B, and C), and with each RTK, pErk levels were restored in the presence of the ShcD PTB*, PTB*/SH2*, and Y6F mutants. Notably, ShcD SH2* appeared to function as a super-repressor, reducing phosphorylated Erk below the levels generated downstream of wild type ShcD (quantitated in Fig. 2D). To better understand the physiological extent of ShcD influence over Erk, we turned to our recently generated whole body ShcD knock-out mice, which are viable and appear normal in gross morphology. 10L. A. New, H. N. Robeson, and N. Jones, manuscript in preparation. As our previous work revealed robust ShcD expression throughout the developing and adult brain (8Hawley S.P. Wills M.K. Rabalski A.J. Bendall A.J. Jones N. Expression patterns of ShcD and Shc family adaptor proteins during mouse embryonic development.Dev. Dyn. 2011; 240: 221-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 9Jones N. Hardy W.R. Friese M.B. Jorgensen C. Smith M.J. Woody N.M. Burden S.J. Pawson T. Analysis of a Shc family adaptor protein, ShcD/Shc4, that associates with muscle-specific kinase.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2007; 27: 4759-4773Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), we focused on this organ to identify changes arising from ShcD removal. In brain homogenate prepared from mice, we observed a reduction in ShcD protein in heterozygous animals compared with wild type (WT) littermates and complete elimination in full knock-outs (KOs) (Fig. 3A). Remarkably, ShcD control of pErk was also seen in vivo where the loss of ShcD resulted in Erk hyperactivation (Fig. 3B). Quantitation of the phenomenon revealed a mean 2-fold increase in the pErk/Erk ratios when comparing the ShcD KO brain with that of WT controls (Fig. 3C). Our unexpected discovery that ShcD reduces Erk output in cultured cells and in the mouse model prompted further mechanistic characterization of this response. As depicted in Fig. 2, the distinct ShcD mutations that rescued Erk phosphorylation are similar in that they disable the phosphotyrosine transduction capacity of the adaptor either by physically uncoupling ShcD from the stimulated receptor (PTB* and PTB*/SH2*) or by preventing it from recruiting proximal effectors (Y6F). Indeed, the Erk activation pattern appeared to be reciprocal to the ShcD phosphorylation status such that decreased pShc was associated with increased pErk (Fig. 2, A, B, and C). Considering that Grb2 is the major canonical binding partner of the ShcD tyrosine residues (9Jones N. Hardy W.R. Friese M.B. Jorgensen C. Smith M.J. Woody N.M. Burden S.J. Pawson T. Analysis of a Shc family adaptor protein, ShcD/Shc4, that associates with muscle-specific kinase.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2007; 27: 4759-4773Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), we questioned whether the signaling output was influenced by sequestration of this adaptor. Because all three neurotrophic receptors demonstrated identical Erk activation and repression patterns in concert with ShcD and its mutants, we proceeded to characterize the response using TrkB as a model. We first evaluated the extent of interaction between endogenous Grb2 and wild type or domain-mutated ShcD. Consistent with our hypothesis, PTB*, but not SH2*, prevented co-precipitation of Grb2 with ShcD (Fig. 4A). To pursue the impact of ShcD CH1 tyrosine residue loss, we introduced successive phenylalanine substitutions as depicted in the schematic in Fig. 4B. Removal of ShcD tyrosines 374/375 (Y374F/Y375F (Y2F)) completely abolished reactivity to the pShc antibody, which was raised against equivalent residues 239/240 of p52 ShcA (Fig. 4C). As predicted, incremental loss of ShcD tyrosine motifs promoted Erk phosphorylation with the most dramatic shift occurring between Y3F and Y4F (Fig. 4D) in which all known Grb2 recognition sites have been removed (depicted in green in Fig. 4B). Tyrosine 424, which is absent in ShcD Y4F, was identified previously as a novel Grb2 motif unique to ShcD (9Jones N. Hardy W.R. Friese M.B. Jorgensen C. Smith M.J. Woody N.M. Burden S.J. Pawson T. Analysis of a Shc family adaptor protein, ShcD/Shc4, that associates with muscle-specific kinase.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2007; 27: 4759-4773Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The additional substitution of two other non-consensus tyrosine residues (Tyr-403 and Tyr-413; ShcD Y6F) did not contribute to the phospho-Erk response (Fig. 4, C and D). It would therefore appear that ShcD Tyr-374/375, Tyr-424, and Tyr-465 are major mediators of Erk repression. To evaluate the role of Grb2 in this response, we monitored interactions between ShcD-Grb2 and TrkB-Grb2 by co-immunoprecipitations across the series of tyrosine-to-phenylalanine mutants. ShcD Y2F demonstrated a profound loss of endogenous Grb2 binding, and the association appeared to be fully abolished by the additional ShcD Y465F substitution (Y3F; Fig. 4C). Correspondingly, TrkB-Grb2 binding increased as the ShcD-Grb2 interaction decreased (Fig. 4C). Collectively, these observations demonstrate that differential partitioning of Grb2 between ShcD and TrkB correlates with Erk phosphorylation status. They also suggest that endogenous Grb2 is a limiting reagent in the context of overexpressed binding partners, which establishes competition between TrkB and ShcD for the available pool. To address this hypothesis, we overexpressed Grb2 in combination with TrkB and either wild type, PTB*, or SH2* ShcD. As depicted in Fig. 4E, pErk levels varied predictably between the ShcD permutations prior to the addition of exogenous Grb2. Introducing Grb2 equalized Erk phosphorylation among samples expressing wild type ShcD, PTB*, and SH2* (Fig. 4E). It also had the effect of markedly enhancing ShcD phosphorylation without affecting overall protein levels. Thus, it would appear that overexpressed, wild type ShcD can sequester Grb2 away from MAPK-directed outcomes. In this regard, Grb2 appears to assume opposing roles depending on whether it is directly or indirectly recruited into the signaling complex. Another striking and unexplained characteristic of the ShcD signaling response is the capacity of the SH2* mutant to act as a super-repressor of Erk. ShcD SH2* binds the activated receptor (Fig. 1) and is phosphorylated to a greater extent than the wild type protein (Fig. 2) in keeping with the observation that pShc status inversely correlates with pErk outcome. This implied the possible engagement of a regulatory component, such as a phosphatase, via the functional ShcD SH2 domain. To that end, we used affinity purification-mass spectrometry to survey proteins associated with ShcD and identified the Shp2 phosphatase as a putative binding partner. This interaction was confirmed by co-immunoprecipitations performed in the presence and absence of TrkB, which demonstrated a robust association between ShcD and Shp2 under both conditions (Fig. 5A). Notably, the introduction of Shp2 was found to enhance levels of TrkB and ShcD proteins while concomitantly reducing ShcD phosphorylation. When we extended the binding analysis to ShcD variants, we discovered that the SH2* mutation in the full-length ShcD protein profoundly disrupted the Shp2 interaction (Fig. 5B) as anticipated under our hypothesis. This was further verified by GST pulldown analyses involving the individual ShcD domains incubated with lysate containing Shp2 in the presence or absence of TrkB. Here, the addition of the RTK was found to strengthen the association between Shp2 and the isolated ShcD SH2 domain (Fig. 5C). Although not as dramatic, the ShcD Y6F substitutions also reproducibly reduced ShcD-Shp2 binding (Fig. 5B). Considering that Shp2 appears to suppress ShcD phosphorylation, which we have demonstrated is correlated with enhanced pErk signaling, we questioned whether Shp2 overexpression could rescue Erk phosphorylation. Indeed, introducing Shp2 in concert with TrkB and wild type ShcD promoted a substantial increase in pErk signal coincident with reduced pShc (Fig. 5D). These phenomena could not be recapitulated with the dominant-negative substrate-trapping Shp2 Cys-to-Ser mutant, which had the opposite effect of boosting ShcD phosphorylation and further suppressing pErk (Fig. 5, D and E). Moreover, wild type Shp2 partially restored Erk phosphorylation in the context of the super-repressor, ShcD SH2*, even though the principal Shp2 interaction motif was absent. Taken together, our results suggest that ShcD is both a binding partner and a functional target of Shp2 and that the consequences of this association manifest in the MAPK pathway. The overall signaling outcomes thus appear to be the product of several factors, including ShcD phosphorylation status and the availability of Grb2 and Shp2 in the cell, as illustrated in Fig. 6. Ras/MAPK pathway activation was the first signaling outcome attributed to Shc, and it remains the best characterized classical response of this protein family (2Wills M.K. Jones N. Teaching an old dogma new tricks: twenty years of Shc adaptor signalling.Biochem. J. 2012; 447: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, exceptions to this paradigm do exist, and we describe here the first detailed account of ShcD-mediated repression of Erk phosphorylation. Our findings suggest that, although ShcD is recruited via its PTB domain to active Ret and Trk, it does not function as a canonical adaptor linking these receptors to the MAPK cascade but instead regulates the engagement of other pathway componentry to sculpt the signaling output. As depicted in Fig. 6, the capacity of transfected ShcD to suppress Erk phosphorylation distal to the neurotrophic receptors is tightly coupled to its CH1 region tyrosine phosphorylation status. Grb2 is both a central node in the Ras/MAPK pathway and the canonical binding partner of three ShcD phosphotyrosine motifs (9Jones N. Har"

Birds have excellent colour vision, and show preferences for food items of particular colours, but research into colour preferences associated with artificial feeders is limited to hummingbirds. Here, we investigated the colour preferences of common UK garden birds foraging at seed-dispensing artificial feeders containing identical food. We presented birds simultaneously with an array of eight differently coloured feeders, and recorded the number of visits made to each colour over 370 30-minute observation periods in the winter of 2014/15. In addition, we surveyed visitors to a garden centre and science festival to determine the colour preferences of likely purchasers of seed feeders. Our results suggest that silver and green feeders were visited by higher numbers of individuals of several common garden bird species, while red and yellow feeders received fewer visits. In contrast, people preferred red, yellow, blue and green feeders. We suggest that green feeders may be simultaneously marketable and attractive to foraging birds."
https://openalex.org/W2587935762,"We propose a simple agent-based model on a network to conceptualize the allocation of limited wealth among more abundant expectations at the interplay of power, frustration, and initiative. Concepts imported from the statistical physics of frustrated systems in and out of equilibrium allow us to compare subjective measures of frustration and satisfaction to collective measures of fairness in wealth distribution, such as the Lorenz curve and the Gini index. We find that a completely libertarian, law-of-the-jungle setting, where every agent can acquire wealth from or lose wealth to anybody else invariably leads to a complete polarization of the distribution of wealth vs. opportunity. This picture is however dramatically ameliorated when hard constraints are imposed over agents in the form of a limiting network of transactions. There, an out of equilibrium dynamics of the networks, based on a competition between power and frustration in the decision-making of agents, leads to network coevolution. The ratio of power and frustration controls different dynamical regimes separated by kinetic transitions and characterized by drastically different values of equality. It also leads, for proper values of social initiative, to the emergence of three self-organized social classes, lower, middle, and upper class. Their dynamics, which appears mostly controlled by the middle class, drives a cyclical regime of dramatic social changes."
https://openalex.org/W2589056898,"The eyes absent (EYA) family proteins are conserved transcriptional coactivators with intrinsic protein phosphatase activity. They play an essential role in the development of various organs in metazoans. These functions are associated with a unique combination of phosphatase and transactivation activities. However, it remains poorly understood how these activities and the consequent biologic functions of EYA are regulated. Here, we demonstrate that 2 conserved arginine residues, R304 and R306, of EYA1 are essential for its in vitro phosphatase activity and in vivo function during Drosophila eye development. EYA1 physically interacts with protein arginine methyltransferase 1, which methylates EYA1 at these residues both in vitro and in cultured mammalian and insect cells. Moreover, we show that wild-type, but not methylation-defective, EYA1 associates with γ-H2A.X in response to ionizing radiation. Taken together, our results identify the conserved arginine residues of EYA1 that play an important role for its activity, thus implicating arginine methylation as a novel regulatory mechanism of EYA function.—Li, X., Eberhardt, A., Hansen, J.
