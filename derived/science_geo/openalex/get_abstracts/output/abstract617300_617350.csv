https://openalex.org/W2889283495,"Transected axons fail to regrow across anatomically complete spinal cord injuries (SCI) in adults. Diverse molecules can partially facilitate or attenuate axon growth during development or after injury1-3, but efficient reversal of this regrowth failure remains elusive4. Here we show that three factors that are essential for axon growth during development but are attenuated or lacking in adults-(i) neuron intrinsic growth capacity2,5-9, (ii) growth-supportive substrate10,11 and (iii) chemoattraction12,13-are all individually required and, in combination, are sufficient to stimulate robust axon regrowth across anatomically complete SCI lesions in adult rodents. We reactivated the growth capacity of mature descending propriospinal neurons with osteopontin, insulin-like growth factor 1 and ciliary-derived neurotrophic factor before SCI14,15; induced growth-supportive substrates with fibroblast growth factor 2 and epidermal growth factor; and chemoattracted propriospinal axons with glial-derived neurotrophic factor16,17 delivered via spatially and temporally controlled release from biomaterial depots18,19, placed sequentially after SCI. We show in both mice and rats that providing these three mechanisms in combination, but not individually, stimulated robust propriospinal axon regrowth through astrocyte scar borders and across lesion cores of non-neural tissue that was over 100-fold greater than controls. Stimulated, supported and chemoattracted propriospinal axons regrew a full spinal segment beyond lesion centres, passed well into spared neural tissue, formed terminal-like contacts exhibiting synaptic markers and conveyed a significant return of electrophysiological conduction capacity across lesions. Thus, overcoming the failure of axon regrowth across anatomically complete SCI lesions after maturity required the combined sequential reinstatement of several developmentally essential mechanisms that facilitate axon growth. These findings identify a mechanism-based biological repair strategy for complete SCI lesions that could be suitable to use with rehabilitation models designed to augment the functional recovery of remodelling circuits."
https://openalex.org/W2888885392,"The folding of newly synthesized proteins to the native state is a major challenge within the crowded cellular environment, as non-productive interactions can lead to misfolding, aggregation and degradation1. Cells cope with this challenge by coupling synthesis with polypeptide folding and by using molecular chaperones to safeguard folding cotranslationally2. However, although most of the cellular proteome forms oligomeric assemblies3, little is known about the final step of folding: the assembly of polypeptides into complexes. In prokaryotes, a proof-of-concept study showed that the assembly of heterodimeric luciferase is an organized cotranslational process that is facilitated by spatially confined translation of the subunits encoded on a polycistronic mRNA4. In eukaryotes, however, fundamental differences-such as the rarity of polycistronic mRNAs and different chaperone constellations-raise the question of whether assembly is also coordinated with translation. Here we provide a systematic and mechanistic analysis of the assembly of protein complexes in eukaryotes using ribosome profiling. We determined the in vivo interactions of the nascent subunits from twelve hetero-oligomeric protein complexes of Saccharomyces cerevisiae at near-residue resolution. We find nine complexes assemble cotranslationally; the three complexes that do not show cotranslational interactions are regulated by dedicated assembly chaperones5-7. Cotranslational assembly often occurs uni-directionally, with one fully synthesized subunit engaging its nascent partner subunit, thereby counteracting its propensity for aggregation. The onset of cotranslational subunit association coincides directly with the full exposure of the nascent interaction domain at the ribosomal tunnel exit. The action of the ribosome-associated Hsp70 chaperone Ssb8 is coordinated with assembly. Ssb transiently engages partially synthesized interaction domains and then dissociates before the onset of partner subunit association, presumably to prevent premature assembly interactions. Our study shows that cotranslational subunit association is a prevalent mechanism for the assembly of hetero-oligomers in yeast and indicates that translation, folding and the assembly of protein complexes are integrated processes in eukaryotes."
https://openalex.org/W2888849277,"Previous research shows that virtual reality perspective-taking experiences (VRPT) can increase prosocial behavior toward others. We extend this research by exploring whether this effect of VRPT is driven by increased empathy and whether the effect extends to ostensibly real-stakes behavioral games. In a pre-registered laboratory experiment (N = 180), participants interacted with an ostensible partner (a student from the same university as them) on a series of real-stakes economic games after (a) taking the perspective of the partner in a virtual reality, ""day-in-the-life"" simulation, (b) taking the perspective of a different person in a ""day-in-the-life"" simulation, or (c) doing a neutral activity in a virtual environment. The VRPT experience successfully increased participants' subsequent propensity to take the perspective of their partner (a facet of empathy), but only if the partner was the same person whose perspective participants assumed in the virtual reality simulation. Further, this effect of VRPT on perspective-taking was moderated by participants' reported feeling of immersion in the virtual environment. However, we found no effects of VRPT experience on behavior in the economic games."
https://openalex.org/W2889377600,"Glutamine synthetase, encoded by the gene GLUL, is an enzyme that converts glutamate and ammonia to glutamine. It is expressed by endothelial cells, but surprisingly shows negligible glutamine-synthesizing activity in these cells at physiological glutamine levels. Here we show in mice that genetic deletion of Glul in endothelial cells impairs vessel sprouting during vascular development, whereas pharmacological blockade of glutamine synthetase suppresses angiogenesis in ocular and inflammatory skin disease while only minimally affecting healthy adult quiescent endothelial cells. This relies on the inhibition of endothelial cell migration but not proliferation. Mechanistically we show that in human umbilical vein endothelial cells GLUL knockdown reduces membrane localization and activation of the GTPase RHOJ while activating other Rho GTPases and Rho kinase, thereby inducing actin stress fibres and impeding endothelial cell motility. Inhibition of Rho kinase rescues the defect in endothelial cell migration that is induced by GLUL knockdown. Notably, glutamine synthetase palmitoylates itself and interacts with RHOJ to sustain RHOJ palmitoylation, membrane localization and activation. These findings reveal that, in addition to the known formation of glutamine, the enzyme glutamine synthetase shows unknown activity in endothelial cell migration during pathological angiogenesis through RHOJ palmitoylation. The enzyme glutamine synthetase is active in endothelial cell migration during angiogenesis, through autopalmitoylation and the regulation of RHOJ signalling."

https://openalex.org/W2888978497,"The naturally occurring channelrhodopsin variant anion channelrhodopsin-1 (ACR1), discovered in the cryptophyte algae Guillardia theta, exhibits large light-gated anion conductance and high anion selectivity when expressed in heterologous settings, properties that support its use as an optogenetic tool to inhibit neuronal firing with light. However, molecular insight into ACR1 is lacking owing to the absence of structural information underlying light-gated anion conductance. Here we present the crystal structure of G. theta ACR1 at 2.9 Å resolution. The structure reveals unusual architectural features that span the extracellular domain, retinal-binding pocket, Schiff-base region, and anion-conduction pathway. Together with electrophysiological and spectroscopic analyses, these findings reveal the fundamental molecular basis of naturally occurring light-gated anion conductance, and provide a framework for designing the next generation of optogenetic tools. The crystal structure of anion channelrhodopsin-1 (ACR1) from the algae Guillardia theta provides insights into the basis of anion conductance."
https://openalex.org/W2888949843,"This paper empirically studies the effect of Open Access on journal CiteScores. We have found that the general effect is positive but not uniform across different types of journals. In particular, we investigate two types of heterogeneous treatment effect: (1) the differential treatment effect among journals grouped by academic field, publisher, and tier; and (2) differential treatment effects of Open Access as a function of propensity to be treated. The results are robust to a number of sensitivity checks and falsification tests. Our findings shed new light on Open Access effect on journals and can help stakeholders of journals in the decision of adopting the Open Access policy."
https://openalex.org/W2889393256,"Both designed and natural anion-conducting channelrhodopsins (dACRs and nACRs, respectively) have been widely applied in optogenetics (enabling selective inhibition of target-cell activity during animal behaviour studies), but each class exhibits performance limitations, underscoring trade-offs in channel structure-function relationships. Therefore, molecular and structural insights into dACRs and nACRs will be critical not only for understanding the fundamental mechanisms of these light-gated anion channels, but also to create next-generation optogenetic tools. Here we report crystal structures of the dACR iC++, along with spectroscopic, electrophysiological and computational analyses that provide unexpected insights into pH dependence, substrate recognition, channel gating and ion selectivity of both dACRs and nACRs. These results enabled us to create an anion-conducting channelrhodopsin integrating the key features of large photocurrent and fast kinetics alongside exclusive anion selectivity. Crystal structures and molecular simulations of the designed anion-conducting channelrhodopsin iC++ provide molecular insights that enable structure-based design of channelrhodopsins with desirable properties for use as optogenetic tools."
https://openalex.org/W2889265170,"Background Despite substantial progress, gaps in the HIV care cascade remain large: globally, while about 36.7 million people were living with HIV in 2015, 11.9 million of these individuals did not know their HIV status, 12.7 million were in need of antiretroviral therapy (ART) and 13.0 million were not virally suppressed. We sought to deepen understanding of the barriers to care engagement at three critical steps of the care cascade proposed to make greatest impact for attaining the UNAIDS 90-90-90 targets aimed at shutting down the HIV epidemic. Methods Analyses were conducted among HIV-infected adults in rural East Africa. Qualitative data were collected using in-depth interviews among 63 individuals participating in an ongoing test-and treat trial (NCT01864683) in its baseline year (July 2013-June 2014). Audio recordings were transcribed, translated into English, and coded using Atlas.ti software. Data were analyzed using a thematic framework for explaining barriers to care engagement that drew upon both theory and prior empirical research in similar settings. Results Multiple barriers to engagement in care were observed. HIV-related stigma across dimensions of anticipated, internalized and enacted stigma manifested in denial and fears of disclosure, and influenced lapses in care engagement across multiple steps in the cascade. Poverty (lack of food and transport), lack of social support, work interference, prior negative experiences with health services, drug side effects, and treatment fatigue also negatively affected ART adherence and viral suppression. Gender differences were observed, with work interference and denial disproportionately affecting men compared to women. Conclusion Multiple barriers to HIV care engagement still pervade rural sub-Saharan settings threatening the realization of the UNAIDS 90-90-90 targets. To control the epidemic, efforts need to be accelerated to combat stigma. Patient economic empowerment, innovative drug formulations, as well as more patient-responsive health systems, may help overcome barriers to engagement in care."
https://openalex.org/W2889208017,"Currently, the potential risk of atrial fibrillation associated with antihyperglycemic drug use has been a topic of considerable interest. However, it remains uncertain whether different classes of antihyperglycemic drug therapy are associated with the risk of atrial fibrillation risk. Here, we investigated the association between different classes of antihyperglycemic drugs and new-onset atrial fibrillation (NAF). A case-matched study was performed based on the National Health Insurance Program in Taiwan. Patients who had NAF were considered the NAF group and were matched in a 1:4 ratio with patients without NAF, who were assigned to the non-NAF group. Patients were matched according to sex, age, diabetes mellitus duration, index date, and Charlson Comorbidity Index score. We used multivariate logistic regression controlling for potential confounders to examine the association between different classes of antihyperglycemic drug use and the risk of NAF. Overall, we identified 2,882 cases and 11,528 matched controls for the study. After adjusting for sex, age, comorbidities, and concurrent medications, users of biguanides or thiazolidinediones were at a lower risk of developing NAF when compared with non-users (odds ratio [OR] 0.81, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.71-0.95 and OR 0.72, 95% CI 0.63-0.83, respectively). In contrast, users of insulin were at a higher risk of developing NAF than were non-users (OR 1.19, 95% CI 1.06-1.35). Sulfonylureas, glinides, α-glucosidase inhibitors, and dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors were not associated with developing the risk of NAF. In conclusion, the use of biguanides or thiazolidinediones may be associated with a low risk of NAF, whereas insulin may be associated with a significant increase in the risk of NAF in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus during long-term follow-up. Further prospective randomized studies should investigate which specific class of antihyperglycemic drug treatment for diabetes mellitus can prevent or postpone NAF."
https://openalex.org/W2888879273,"Ionizing radiation (IR) is a conventional cancer therapeutic, to which cancer cells develop radioresistance with exposure. The residual cancer cells after radiation treatment also have increased metastatic potential. The mechanisms by which cancer cells develop radioresistance and gain metastatic potential are still unknown. In this study acute IR exposure induced cancer cell senescence and apoptosis, but after long-term IR exposure, cancer cells exhibited radioresistance. The proliferation of radioresistant cells was retarded, and most cells were arrested in G0/G1 phase. The radioresistant cells simultaneously showed resistance to further IR-induced apoptosis, premature senescence, and epithelial to mesenchymal transformation (EMT). Acute IR exposure steadily elevated CDC6 protein levels due to the attenuation of ubiquitination, while CDC6 overexpression was observed in the radioresistant cells because the insufficiency of CDC6 phosphorylation blocked protein translocation from nucleus to cytoplasm, resulting in subcellular protein accumulation when the cells were arrested in G0/G1 phase. CDC6 ectopic overexpression in CNE2 cells resulted in apoptosis resistance, G0/G1 cell cycle arrest, premature senescence, and EMT, similar to the characteristics of radioresistant CNE2-R cells. Targeting CDC6 with siRNA promoted IR-induced senescence, sensitized cancer cells to IR-induced apoptosis, and reversed EMT. Furthermore, CDC6 depletion synergistically repressed the growth of CNE2-R xenografts when combined with IR. The study describes for the first time cell models for IR-induced senescence, apoptosis resistance, and EMT, three major mechanisms by which radioresistance develops. CDC6 is a novel radioresistance switch regulating senescence, apoptosis, and EMT. These studies suggest that CDC6highKI67low represents a new diagnostic marker of radiosensitivity, and CDC6 represents a new therapeutic target for cancer radiosensitization."
https://openalex.org/W2888826985,"Resistance training may differentially affect morphological adaptations along the length of uni-articular and bi-articular muscles. The purpose of this study was to compare changes in muscle morphology along the length of the rectus femoris (RF) and vastus lateralis (VL) in response to resistance training. Following a 2-wk preparatory phase, 15 resistance-trained men (24.0 ± 3.0 y, 90.0 ± 13.8 kg, 174.9 ± 20.7 cm) completed pre-training (PRE) assessments of muscle thickness (MT), pennation angle (PA), cross-sectional area (CSA), and echo-intensity in the RF and VL at 30, 50, and 70% of each muscle’s length; fascicle length (FL) was estimated from respective measurements of MT and PA within each muscle and region. Participants then began a high intensity, low volume (4 x 3–5 repetitions, 3min rest) lower-body resistance training program, and repeated all PRE-assessments after 8 weeks (2 d ∙ wk-1) of training (POST). Although three-way (muscle [RF, VL] x region [30, 50, 70%] x time [PRE, POST]) repeated measures analysis of variance did not reveal significant interactions for any assessment of morphology, significant simple (muscle x time) effects were observed for CSA (p = 0.002) and FL (p = 0.016). Specifically, average CSA changes favored the VL (2.96 ± 0.69 cm2, p < 0.001) over the RF (0.59 ± 0.20 cm2, p = 0.011), while significant decreases in average FL were noted for the RF (–1.03 ± 0.30 cm, p = 0.004) but not the VL (–0.05 ± 0.36 cm, p = 0.901). No other significant differences were observed. The findings of this study demonstrate the occurrence of non-homogenous adaptations in RF and VL muscle size and architecture following 8 weeks of high-intensity resistance training in resistance-trained men. However, training does not appear to influence region-specific adaptations in either muscle."
https://openalex.org/W2889531156,"Biofilm formation is a critical virulence factor responsible for treatment failure and chronicity in orthopaedic device-related infections (ODIs) caused by Staphylococcus aureus. Clonal lineages differ in terms of their biofilm forming capacities. The aim of this study was to investigate the correlation between the clonal complex (CC) affiliation and biofilm phenotype of 30 clinical S. aureus isolates responsible of ODI based on i) early biofilm formation using BioFilm Ring Test® and mature biofilm formation using crystal violet assays, ii) biofilm composition using DNase and proteinase K activity, and iii) prevention of biofilm formation by cloxacillin, teicoplanin and vancomycin using Antibiofilmogram® (biofilm minimal inhibitory concentration–bMIC). In terms of early biofilm formation, the CC30 strains were significantly slower than the CC5, CC15 and CC45 strains. CC45 strains produced significantly more mature biofilm than other group of strains did. The formation of biofilms was highly dependent on the presence of extracellular DNA in the CC5, CC15 and CC30 strains whereas it was mostly dependent on the presence of proteins in CC45. Finally, the CC30 group highlighted higher proportion of susceptible (bMIC < breakpoints of EUCAST guidelines) for cloxacillin, teicoplanin and vancomycin compared to the other CCs. These results demonstrate that the biofilm phenotype of clinical S. aureus isolates from ODIs is strongly related to their respective CC affiliation."
https://openalex.org/W2888882611,"The development of an early complex gut microbiota may play an important role in the protection against intestinal dysbiosis later in life. The significance of the developed microbiota for gut barrier functionality upon interaction with pathogenic or beneficial bacteria is largely unknown. The transcriptome of differently perfused jejunal loops of 12 caesarian-derived pigs, neonatally associated with microbiota of different complexity, was studied. Piglets received pasteurized sow colostrum at birth (d0), a starter microbiota (Lactobacillus amylovorus (LAM), Clostridium glycolicum, and Parabacteroides) on d1-d3, and a placebo inoculant (simple association, SA) or an inoculant consisting of sow's diluted feces (complex association, CA) on d3-d4. On d 26-37, jejunal loops were perfused for 8 h with either enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli F4 (ETEC), purified F4 fimbriae, LAM or saline control (CTRL). Gene expression of each intestinal loop was analyzed by Affymetrix Porcine Gene 1.1_ST array strips. Gene Set Enrichment Analysis was performed on expression values. Compared to CTRL, 184 and 74; 2 and 139; 2 and 48 gene sets, were up- and down-regulated by ETEC, F4 and LAM, respectively. ETEC up-regulated networks related to inflammatory and immune responses, RNA processing, and mitosis. There was a limited overlap in up-regulated gene sets between ETEC and F4 fimbriae. LAM down-regulated genes related to inflammatory and immune responses, as well as to cellular compound metabolism. In CA pigs, 57 gene sets were up-regulated by CA, while 73 were down-regulated compared to SA. CA up-regulated gene sets related to lymphocyte modulation and to cellular defense in all loop perfusions. In CA pigs, compared to SA pigs, genes for chemokine and cytokine activity and for response to external stimuli were down-regulated in ETEC-perfused loops and up-regulated in CTRL. The results highlight the importance of the nature of neonatal microbial colonization in the response to microbial stimuli later in life."

https://openalex.org/W2889558438,"Prostate cancer is the second-most common malignancy of the male genitourinary system. TNF-α has attracted intense attention as a potential therapeutic agent against various cancers. However, its therapeutic application is restricted by short half life and severe toxic side-effects. In this study, we constructed a stable nanodrug, called TNF-α-derived polypeptide (P16)-conjugated, chitosan (CTS)-modified selenium nanoparticle (SC; SCP), which is composed of SC as a slow-release carrier conjugated to P16. SCP had significant inhibitory effects on multiple types of tumor cells, especially DU145 prostate cancer cells, but not on RWPE-1 normal human prostate epithelial cells. SCP could induce G0/G1 cell-cycle arrest and apoptosis in DU145 cells more effectively than could P16 and TNF-α. In DU145 xenograft tumor models, SCP exerted much stronger antitumor effects than P16 or estramustine (the clinical drug for prostate cancer) but caused fewer toxic side-effects. In addition, SCP significantly inhibited proliferation and accelerated apoptosis in DU145 xenograft tumors. Further mechanistic studies revealed that SCP exerted antitumor effects via activation of the p38 MAPK/JNK pathway, thus inducing G0/G1 cell-cycle arrest and caspase-dependent apoptosis. These findings suggest that SCP may represent a potential long-lasting therapeutic agent for human prostate cancer with fewer side effects.-Yan, Q., Chen, X., Gong, H., Qiu, P., Xiao, X., Dang, S., Hong, A., Ma, Y. Delivery of a TNF-α-derived peptide by nanoparticles enhances its antitumor activity by inducing cell-cycle arrest and caspase-dependent apoptosis."
https://openalex.org/W2888959606,"Chemerin is a chemoattractant involved in immunity as well as an adipokine, whose activity is regulated by successive proteolytic cleavages at its C-terminus. Chemerin’s C-terminal sequence and its proteolytic cleavage sites are highly conserved between human and mouse, as well as in other species. We produced, purified and characterized different mouse chemerin forms. Ca2+ mobilization assay showed that the EC50 values for mchem161T and mchem157R were 135.8 ± 158 nM and 71.2 ± 55.4 nM, respectively, whereas mchem156S and mchem155F had a 20-fold higher potency with an EC50 of 4.6 ± 1.8 nM and 3.6 ± 3.0 nM, respectively, likely representing the two physiologically active forms of chemerin. No agonist activity was found for mchem154A. Similar results were obtained in a chemotaxis assay. To identify and quantify the in vivo mouse chemerin forms in biological samples, we developed specific ELISAs for mchem162K, mchem157R, mchem156S, mchem155F and mchem154A, using antibodies raised against peptides from the C-terminus of the different mouse chemerin forms. The prochemerin form, mchem162K, was the major chemerin form in plasma with its increase matching the increase of total plasma chemerin in obese mice. During the onset of obesity in high-fat diet fed mice, mchem156S was elevated in plasma. In contrast, mchem155F was the dominant form in epididymal fat extracts. Our study provides the first direct evidence that mouse chemerin undergoes extensive, dynamic and tissue-specific proteolytic processing in vivo, similar to human chemerin, underlining the importance of measuring individual chemerin forms in studies of chemerin biology in mouse models."
https://openalex.org/W2889484080,"Background One significant health policy challenge in many European countries at present is developing strategies to deal with the increase in patient attendance at Out-of-Hours care (OOHC), whether this is at OOHC-Centres in primary care settings or hospital emergency departments (ED). FAs (FAs) presenting in OOHC are a known challenge and previous studies have shown that FAs present more often with psychological problems and psychiatric comorbidities rather than severe physical complaints. FAs may be also contributing to the rising workload in OOHC-Centres in primary care. The aim of this study was to determine attendance frequencies and health problem presentation patterns for patients with and without somatoform disorders (ICD-10 F45 diagnoses) in OOHC-Centres in primary care. Some of these somatoform disorders may have a psychiatric character. Moreover, we wanted to compare health care utilization patterns (pharmacotherapy and hospitalizations) between these patients groups. Methods Routine OOHC data from a large German statutory health insurance company in the federal state of Baden-Wuerttemberg were evaluated. 3,813,398 health insured persons were included in the data set from 2014. The data were initially made available for our study group in order to evaluate a comprehensive evaluation programme in German primary care, the “Hausarztzentrierte Versorgung” (HZV), loosely translated as “family doctor coordinated care”. We used the ICD-10 codes F45.0-F45.9 in regular care to identify patients with somatoform disorders and compared their health care utilization patterns (attendance rates, diagnoses, prescriptions, hospitalization rates) in OOHC to patients without somatoform disorders. Attendance rates were calculated with multivariable regression models in order to adjust for age, gender, comorbidities and for participation in the HZV intervention. Results 350,528 patients (9.2%) of the 3,813,398 insured persons had an F45-diagnosis. In comparison with the whole study-sample, patients with an F45-diagnosis were on average seven years older (51.7 vs. 44.0 years; p<0,0001) and the percentage of women was significantly higher (70.1% vs 53.3%; p<0,0001). In OOHC, as opposed to normal office hours, the adjusted rate of patients with an F45-diagnosis was 60.6% higher (adjusted for age, gender and co-morbidity) than in the general study-sample. Accordingly, in OOHC, prescriptions for antidepressants, hypnotics, anxiolytics but also opioids were significantly higher than in the general study population i.e. those without F45- diagnoses. However, an F45 diagnosis was only made in 3.45% of all F45 patients seen in OOHC in 2014. Conclusions Patients with somatoform disorders were more FAs in both regular office hours and in OOHC in primary care settings. In OOHC, they are normally not identified as such because the somatoform illness is secondary to other acutely presenting symptoms such as pain. While it is acknowledged that it is difficult to make an exact diagnosis in this complex group of somatoform disorders in an OOHC setting, it is still important to develop continuing education programmes for medical staff working in OOHC, to support effective recognition and response to the specific needs of this complex patient group."
https://openalex.org/W2888933088,"A core proposition in numerical cognition is numbers are represented spatially. Evidence for this proposition comes from the ""spatial numerical association of response codes"" effect (SNARC) in which faster responses are made by the left/right hand judging whether one of a pair of Arabic digits is smaller/larger than the other. Less is known if a similar SNARC effect exists for non-symbolic magnitudes; and research that has been conducted used stimuli which could be translated into symbolic terms. To overcome this limitation, we employed a referent-to-target judgment paradigm in which a referent dot array (n = 30 dots) was follow by a second array of dots (e.g., n = 45 or 15 dots)-participants judged if the second array contained fewer or more dots than the referent array. Dot arrays with fewer dots were judged more quickly with the left hand compared to the right hand (i.e., a SNARC effect). Not all participants demonstrated a SNARC effect, however. Neither visuospatial working memory nor math ability was associated with the presence/absence of a non-symbolic SNARC effect. Implications of the non-symbolic SNARC effect for accounts of numerical cognition are discussed."

Surgeons were also asked if they discuss the role of PA postoperatively and about their knowledge and application of the NNGB.There was consensus on 29 sport activities for the THA<65 group and 30 activities for the THA>65 group. In the TKA<65 group there was consensus for 33 sports activities and in the TKA>65 group for 32 activities. Amongst orthopaedic surgeons performing THAs and TKAs, respectively 77% and 79% discussed the role of PA postoperatively with their patients, and a total of 34% and 41% were familiar with the NNGB, with 33% and 34% of them giving NNGB-based advice.Results can be used to recommend sport activities after THA/TKA.

https://openalex.org/W2889217136,"Despite the success of approved systemic therapies for estrogen receptor α (ER)-positive breast cancer, drug resistance remains common. We hypothesized that secreted factors from the human tumor microenvironment could modulate drug resistance. We previously screened a library of 297 recombinant-secreted microenvironmental proteins for the ability to confer resistance to the anti-estrogen fulvestrant in 2 ER+ breast cancer cell lines. Herein, we considered whether factors that enhanced drug sensitivity could be repurposed as therapeutics and provide leads for drug development. Screening data revealed bone morphogenic protein (BMP)4 as a factor that inhibited cell growth and synergized with approved anti-estrogens and cyclin-dependent kinase 4/6 inhibitors (CDK4/6i). BMP4-mediated growth inhibition was dependent on type I receptor activin receptor-like kinase (ALK)3-dependent phosphorylation (P) of mothers against decapentaplegic homolog (SMAD/P-SMAD)1 and 5, which could be reversed by BMP receptor inhibitors and ALK3 knockdown. The primary effect of BMP4 on cell fate was cell-cycle arrest, in which RNA sequencing, immunoblot analysis, and RNA interference revealed to be dependent on p21WAF1/Cip1 upregulation. BMP4 also enhanced sensitivity to approved inhibitors of mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 and CDK4/6 via ALK3-mediated P-SMAD1/5 and p21 upregulation in anti-estrogen-resistant cells. Patients bearing primary ER+ breast tumors, exhibiting a transcriptomic signature of BMP4 signaling, had improved disease outcome following adjuvant treatment with anti-estrogen therapy, independently of age, tumor grade, and tumor stage. Furthermore, a transcriptomic signature of BMP4 signaling was predictive of an improved biologic response to the CDK4/6i palbociclib, in combination with an aromatase inhibitor in primary tumors. These findings highlight BMP4 and its downstream pathway activation as a therapeutic opportunity in ER+ breast cancer.-Shee, K., Jiang, A., Varn, F. S., Liu, S., Traphagen, N. A., Owens, P., Ma, C.

However, the mechanism of the altered properties of airway smooth muscle cells is not well understood.To identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) related to the bronchial smooth muscle (BSM) hyper-contractility in a murine asthma model.The ovalbumin (OA)-sensitized mice were repeatedly challenged with aerosolized OA to induce asthmatic reaction. Transcriptomic profiles were generated by microarray analysis of BSM tissues from the OA-challenged and control animals, and KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes) Pathway Analysis was applied.Tension study showed a BSM hyperresponsiveness to acetylcholine (ACh) in the OA-challenged mice. A total of 770 genes were differentially expressed between the OA-challenged and control animals. Pathway analysis showed a significant change in arachidonic acid (AA) metabolism pathway in BSM tissues of the OA-challenged mice. Validation of DEGs by quantitative RT-PCR showed a significant increase in PLA2 group 4c (Pla2g4c)/COX-2 (Ptgs2)/PGD2 synthase 2 (Hpgds) axis. PGD2 level in bronchoalveolar fluids of the OA-challenged mice was significantly increased. A 24-h incubation of BSM tissues with PGD2 caused a hyperresponsiveness to ACh in naive control mice.AA metabolism is shifted towards PGD2 production in BSM tissues of asthma. Increased PGD2 level in the airways might be a cause of the BSM hyperresponsiveness in asthma."
https://openalex.org/W2889529652,"Lysosome has a crucial role in clearance of endocytosed pathogens from the cell. Small molecules that can boost lysosome function and bactericidal ability to cope with subsequent infection are urgently needed. Here, we report that MPB, a novel berberine derivative, induced lysosome-based degradation and clearance of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and enteroinvasive Escherichia coli in macrophages. MPB caused nuclear translocation of transcription factor EB (TFEB), which boosted expression of lysosome genes. TFEB silencing repressed the MPB-mediated enhancements in degradation and bacterial eradication. MPB switched on TFEB nuclear translocation by coupling 2 parallel signaling pathways. MPB-triggered JNK activation led to 14-3-3δ being released from TFEB, which, in turn, caused TFEB nuclear translocation. In addition, MPB induced AMPK activation and subsequent inhibition of mechanistic target of rapamycin activity, which also contributed to TFEB nuclear translocation. Importantly, genetical or pharmaceutical inhibition of TGF-β-activated kinase 1 (TAK1) reduced MPB action remarkably. MPB acted through TAK1 at lysine 158 to activate JNK and AMPK and, thus, induced TFEB-dependent bactericidal activity in macrophages. Therefore, our study reveals a novel mechanism by which MPB controls JNK and AMPK phosphorylation cascades to activate lysosomal function and bactericidal activity via TAK1 K158-dependent manner, which may offer insight into novel therapeutic strategies to control bacterial infection.-Liu, X., Zhang, N., Liu, Y., Liu, L., Zeng, Q., Yin, M., Wang, Y., Song, D., Deng, H. MPB, a novel berberine derivative, enhances lysosomal and bactericidal properties via TGF-β-activated kinase 1-dependent activation of the transcription factor EB."
https://openalex.org/W2889505223,"Mesenteric ischemia/reperfusion is a clinical emergency with high morbidity and mortality due to the transient reduction of blood supply to the bowel. In recent years, the critical contribution of gut microbiome to human health and proper gastrointestinal functions has gradually emerged. In the current study, we investigated the protective effects of five days supplementation with Bifidobacterium bifidum PRL2010 in a murine model of gut ischemia/reperfusion. Our findings indicate that animals pretreated with B. bifidum PRL2010 showed lower neutrophil recruitment in the lungs, remarkably reduced bacterial translocation and decreased transcription levels of TNFalpha and IL-10 both in liver and kidneys, at the same time increasing those of IL-12 in kidneys. Inhibiting the adhesion of pathogenic bacteria and boosting host innate immunity responses are among the possible protective mechanisms enacted by the probiotic. These results demonstrate that short-period treatment with B. bifidum PRL2010 is a potential strategy to dampen remote organ injury due to mesenteric ischemia/reperfusion."
https://openalex.org/W2888947039,"A novel technology, photonic ring immunoassay (PRI), for detecting 12 autoantibodies simultaneously in whole blood in less than 15 minutes was evaluated by comparing results from 235 clinically diagnosed patients with standard laboratory tests. The overall agreement was greater than 91% for 10 of the 12 assays, with positive percent agreement greater than 89% for 9 of the assays and negative percent agreement greater than 91% for 10 of them. Thus, the clinical sensitivities and specificities were similar for the 2 methods. In addition, 199 normal blood donors were tested on the ANA 12 PRI, yielding specificities greater than 97.5% for all assays. This proof of concept study shows that this new system is suitable for point of care testing for clinically useful autoantibodies, allowing the doctor to have test results in minutes rather than days."
https://openalex.org/W2888988646,"While mastering a musical instrument takes years, becoming familiar with a new music system requires less time and skills. In this study, we examine whether musically untrained Western listeners can incidentally learn an unfamiliar, microtonal musical scale from simply engaging in a timbre discrimination task. The experiment is comprised of an Exposure and a Test phase. During Exposure, 21 non-musicians were instructed to detect a timbre shift (TS) within short microtonal melodies, and we hypothesised that they would incidentally learn about the pitch interval structure of the microtonal scale from attending to the melodies during the task. In a follow-up Test phase, the tone before the TS was either a member (congruent) or a non-member (incongruent) of the scale. Based on our statistical manipulation of the stimuli, incongruent tones would be a better predictor of an incoming TS than the congruent tones. We therefore expect a faster response time to the shift after the participants have heard an incongruent tone. Specifically, a faster response time observed after an incongruent tone would imply participants' ability to differentiate tones from the microtonal and the diatonic scale, and reflect their learning of the microtonal pitch intervals. Results are consistent with our predictions. In investigating the learning of a microtonal scale, our study can offer directions for future research on the perception of computer music and new musical genres."
https://openalex.org/W2889126432,"Aim Proteomics has the potential to enhance early identification of beta-cell dysfunction, in conjunction with monitoring the various stages of type 2 diabetes onset. The most routine method of assessing pancreatic beta-cell function is an oral glucose tolerance test, however this method is time consuming and carries a participant burden. The objectives of this research were to identify protein signatures and pathways related to pancreatic beta-cell function in fasting blood samples. Methods Beta-cell function measures were calculated for MECHE study participants who completed an oral glucose tolerance test and had proteomic data (n = 100). Information on 1,129 protein levels was obtained using the SOMAscan assay. Receiver operating characteristic curves were used to assess discriminatory ability of proteins of interest. Subsequent in vitro experiments were performed using the BRIN-BD11 pancreatic beta-cell line. Replication of findings were achieved in a second human cohort where possible. Results Twenty-two proteins measured by aptamer technology were significantly associated with beta-cell function/HOMA-IR while 17 proteins were significantly associated with the disposition index (p ≤ 0.01). Receiver operator characteristic curves determined the protein panels to have excellent discrimination between low and high beta-cell function. Linear regression analysis determined that beta-endorphin and IL-17F have strong associations with beta-cell function/HOMA-IR, β = 0.039 (p = 0.005) and β = -0.027 (p = 0.013) respectively. Calcineurin and CRTAM were strongly associated with the disposition index (β = 0.005 and β = 0.005 respectively, p = 0.012). In vitro experiments confirmed that IL-17F modulated insulin secretion in the BRIN-BD11 cell line, with the lower concentration of 10 ng/mL significantly increasing glucose stimulated insulin secretion (p = 0.043). Conclusions Early detection of compromised beta-cell function could allow for implementation of nutritional and lifestyle interventions before progression to type 2 diabetes."
https://openalex.org/W2889249122,"Background The number of students using neuro enhancement to improve their performance and to prevent test anxiety is increasing. The acupuncture point Heart 7 (HT7) has been described as being prominent in reducing states of anxiety. Methods We conducted a randomized placebo-controlled, two-armed pilot trial to investigate the efficacy of a single-point acupuncture treatment at bilateral HT7 compared to sham laser acupuncture on test anxiety. Test anxiety was induced applying the standardised protocol of the Trier Social Stress Test. Outcome measures included saliva samples analysed for cortisol and amylase, anxiety questionnaires and heart rate variability. Results Twenty-five male subjects (age 28 ± 5 years) were allocated to either verum acupuncture (n = 12) or sham laser acupuncture (n = 13). Cortisol peaked 20 min after the stress test (2-fold, 18.11 ± 2 nmol/l) and amylase 10 min after (2-fold, 259 ± 49 U/ml) with no difference between groups. There were no differences between groups regarding either anxiety questionnaires or physiological parameters. Compared to reference data (3-fold increase in cortisol), increase in stress hormones and heart rate seemed somewhat reduced. Conclusions Acupuncture may be a possible approach for the treatment of anxiety. Due to the lack of a no control treatment group, we cannot determine the magnitude of possible specific needle effects at HT7 to promote specific effects in the neuroendocrine system. Finally this study only examines the efficacy of a single time treatment."
https://openalex.org/W2889413457,"Chronic rhinosinusitis is involved in tissue remodeling of nasal mucosa such as nasal myofibroblast differentiation and extracellular matrix production. Apigenin (4',5,7-trihydroxyflavone) is a bioflavonoid compound and has anti-tissue remodeling characteristics. The aims of this study were to evaluate the effect of apigenin on TGF-β1-induced myofibroblast differentiation and extracellular matrix accumulation and to determine the underlying mechanism.Nasal fibroblasts and ex vivo nasal inferior turbinate tissues were stimulated with TGF-β1 with or without apigenin. The expression levels of α-SMA, fibronectin and collagen type I were determined by real-time PCR, western blot and immunocytochemical staining. Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) phosphorylation induced by TGF-β1 were determined by western blot analysis. The transcriptional activity of NF-κB was measured by luciferase assay. Migration effects of fibroblasts were evaluated by wound scratch and transwell migration assay. Contractile activity was determined by collagen gel contraction assay.The expression levels of α-SMA, fibronectin, and collagen type I significantly increased in TGF-β1-stimulated nasal fibroblasts. In TGF-β1-stimulated nasal fibroblasts, apigenin inhibited the expressions of α-SMA, fibronectin, and collagen type I. Inhibitors of MAPK (p-38, JNK) and NF-κB blocked the expression of α-SMA, fibronectin and collagen type I. Apigenin suppressed the activation of MAPK (p-38, JNK) and NF-κB induced by TGF-β1 treatment. Apigenin also inhibited the functional activity of fibroblasts by reducing the migration and collagen contractile activities.These results suggests the possible use of apigenin as a chronic rhinosinusitis therapeutic agent which can suppress tissue remodeling in nasal mucosa."
https://openalex.org/W2952570350,"Somatic mutations promote the transformation of normal cells to cancer. Accurate identification of such mutations facilitates cancer diagnosis and treatment, but biological and technological noises, including intra-tumor heterogeneity, sample contamination, uncertainties in base sequencing and read alignment, pose a big challenge to somatic mutation discovery. A number of callers have been developed to predict them from paired tumor/normal or unpaired tumor sequencing data. However, the small size of currently available experimentally validated somatic sites limits evaluation and then improvement of callers. Fortunately, NIST reference material NA12878 genome has been well-characterized with publicly available high-confidence genotype calls, and biological and technological noises can be computationally generalized to the number of sub-clones, the VAFs, the sequencing and mapping qualities. We used BAMSurgeon to create simulated tumors by introducing somatic small variants (SNVs and small indels) into homozygous reference or wildtype sites of NA12878. We generated 135 simulated tumors from 5 pre-tumors/normals. These simulated tumors vary in sequencing and subsequent mapping error profiles, read length, the number of sub-clones, the VAF, the mutation frequency across the genome and the genomic context. Furthermore, these pure tumor/normal pairs can be mixed at desired ratios within each pair to simulate sample contamination. This database (a total size of 15 terabytes) will be of great use to benchmark somatic small variant callers and guide their improvement."
https://openalex.org/W2889016571,"Renal fibrosis is characterized by excessive production and deposition of extracellular matrix (ECM), which leads to progressive renal failure. Adenosine-monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is a highly conserved kinase that plays a key role in Smad-3 signaling. Here, we examined the effect of a novel AMPK activator, HL156A, on the inhibition of renal fibrosis in in vivo and in vitro models.Unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO) was induced in male Wistar rats. Rats with UUO were administered HL156A (20mg/kg/day), and then the kidneys were harvested 10 days after ligation for further analysis.In the rat UUO model, HL156A attenuated ECM protein deposition. After HL156A treatment, expressions of TGF-β1, p-Smad3, α-SMA, fibronectin, and type IV collagen were suppressed, and E-cadherin expression was up-regulated. In the in vitro experiment, NRK52E cells were treated with HL156A before TGF-β1 stimulation. The inhibitory effects of HL156A upon the signaling pathways and markers of the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) were analyzed. In TGF-β1-treated NRK-52E cells, HL156A co-treatment inhibited the TGF-β1-induced Smad3 signaling pathway and EMT markers.Taken together, the above findings suggest that HL156A, a novel AMPK activator, ameliorates renal fibrosis in vivo and in vitro."
https://openalex.org/W2889052972,"In the rod-shaped bacterium Escherichia coli, the center is selected by the Min-proteins as the site of cell division. To this end, the proteins periodically translocate between the two cell poles, where they suppress assembly of the cell division machinery. Ample evidence notably obtained from in vitro reconstitution experiments suggests that the oscillatory pattern results from self-organization of the proteins MinD and MinE in presence of a membrane. A mechanism built on cooperative membrane attachment of MinD and persistent MinD removal from the membrane induced by MinE has been shown to be able to reproduce the observed Min-protein patterns in rod-shaped E. coli and on flat supported lipid bilayers. Here, we report our results of a numerical investigation of patterns generated by this mechanism in various geoemtries. Notably, we consider the dynamics on membrane patches of different forms, on topographically structured lipid bilayers, and in closed geometries of various shapes. We find that all previously described patterns can be reproduced by the mechanism. However, it requires different parameter sets for reproducing the patterns in closed and in open geometries."
https://openalex.org/W2889229824,"Pseudogenes are paralogues of functional genes historically viewed as defunct due to either the lack of regulatory elements or the presence of frameshift mutations. Recent evidence, however, suggests that pseudogenes may regulate gene expression, although the functional role of pseudogenes remains largely unknown. We previously reported that MYLKP1, the pseudogene of MYLK that encodes myosin light chain kinase (MLCK), is highly expressed in lung and colon cancer cell lines and tissues but not in normal lung or colon. The MYLKP1 promoter is minimally active in normal bronchial epithelial cells but highly active in lung adenocarcinoma cells. In this study, we further validate MYLKP1 as an oncogene via elucidation of the functional role of MYLKP1 genetic variants in colon cancer risk.Proliferation and migration assays were performed in MYLKP1-transfected colon and lung cancer cell lines (H441, A549) and commercially-available normal lung and colon cells. Fourteen MYLKP1 SNPs (MAFs >0.01) residing within the 4 kb MYLKP1 promoter region, the core 1.4 kb of MYLKP1 gene, and a 4 kb enhancer region were selected and genotyped in a colorectal cancer cohort. MYLKP1 SNP influences on activity of MYLKP1 promoter (2kb) was assessed by dual luciferase reporter assay.Cancer cell lines, H441 and A549, exhibited increased MYLKP1 expression, increased MYLKP1 luciferase promoter activity, increased proliferation and migration. Genotyping studies identified two MYLKP1 SNPs (rs12490683; rs12497343) that significantly increase risk of colon cancer in African Americans compared to African American controls. Rs12490683 and rs12497343 further increase MYLKP1 promoter activity compared to the wild type MYLKP1 promoter.MYLKP1 is a cancer-promoting pseudogene whose genetic variants differentially enhance cancer risk in African American populations."
https://openalex.org/W2889311142,"The theoretical foundations of Big Data Science are not fully developed, yet. This study proposes a new scalable framework for Big Data representation, high-throughput analytics (variable selection and noise reduction), and model-free inference. Specifically, we explore the core principles of distribution-free and model-agnostic methods for scientific inference based on Big Data sets. Compressive Big Data analytics (CBDA) iteratively generates random (sub)samples from a big and complex dataset. This subsampling with replacement is conducted on the feature and case levels and results in samples that are not necessarily consistent or congruent across iterations. The approach relies on an ensemble predictor where established model-based or model-free inference techniques are iteratively applied to preprocessed and harmonized samples. Repeating the subsampling and prediction steps many times, yields derived likelihoods, probabilities, or parameter estimates, which can be used to assess the algorithm reliability and accuracy of findings via bootstrapping methods, or to extract important features via controlled variable selection. CBDA provides a scalable algorithm for addressing some of the challenges associated with handling complex, incongruent, incomplete and multi-source data and analytics challenges. Albeit not fully developed yet, a CBDA mathematical framework will enable the study of the ergodic properties and the asymptotics of the specific statistical inference approaches via CBDA. We implemented the high-throughput CBDA method using pure R as well as via the graphical pipeline environment. To validate the technique, we used several simulated datasets as well as a real neuroimaging-genetics of Alzheimer’s disease case-study. The CBDA approach may be customized to provide generic representation of complex multimodal datasets and to provide stable scientific inference for large, incomplete, and multisource datasets."
https://openalex.org/W2888922973,"Background The adiponutrin (PNPLA3) p.I148M and transmembrane 6 superfamily member 2 (TM6SF2) p.E167K variants represent major genetic risk factors for progressive liver injury in nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), alcoholic liver disease (ALD) and chronic viral hepatitis. The aim of this study was to find out whether these variants have a detrimental impact on the progression of chronic liver disease in patients with prolonged cholestasis induced by primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC). Methods We prospectively recruited 178 PSC patients (112 male, age range 17–75 years, 55 with liver cirrhosis, 94 with ulcerative colitis, 48 transplanted during follow-up). PNPLA3 rs738409 and TM6SF2 rs58542926 polymorphisms were genotyped using dedicated TaqMan assays. Associations between genotypes, biochemical and clinical phenotypes were analyzed using contingency tables. Results Allele and genotype distribution of both variants were consistent with Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. No significant differences in the genotype distribution of PNPLA3 (P = 0.90) or TM6SF2 (P = 0.72) were observed between patients with cirrhosis and patients without cirrhosis. Serum liver enzyme activities were not modified by the presence of PNPLA3 (ALT P = 0.88, AST P = 0.77) or TM6SF2 (ALT P = 0.92, AST P = 0.49) risk variants. Increasing number of risk alleles had no impact on serum liver enzyme activities, as demonstrated by a separate analysis of patients carrying 0 (n = 99), 1 (n = 64), 2 (n = 12) or 3 (n = 3) risk alleles (P>0.05). No impact of PNPLA3 or TM6SF2 risk variants was detectable in patients with PSC and ulcerative colitis, and none of the variants increased the odds of transplantation. Conclusions Neither PNPLA3 nor TM6SF2 polymorphisms seem to contribute significantly towards an increased risk for deterioration of liver function in patients with PSC. These results underscore the divergent mechanisms of liver damage in cholestatic conditions as compared to metabolic and viral liver diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2889043754,"Diagnosis of tuberculosis (TB) in infants is challenging due to non-specific clinical presentations of the disease in this age-group and low sensitivity of widely available TB diagnostic tools, which in turn delays prompt access to TB treatment. Upfront access to Xpert/MTB RIF (Xpert) testing, a highly sensitive and specific rapid diagnostic tool, could potentially address some of these challenges. Under the current project, we assessed the utility and feasibility of applying upfront Xpert for diagnosis of tuberculosis in infants, including for testing of non-sputum specimens.A high throughput lab was established in each of the four project cities, and linked to various health care providers across the city, through rapid specimen transportation and electronic reporting linkages. Free Xpert testing was offered to all infant (<2 years of age) presumptive TB cases (both pulmonary and extra-pulmonary) seeking care at public and private health facilities.A total of 7,994 presumptive infant TB cases were enrolled in the project from April 2014 to October 2016, detecting 465 (5.8%, CI: 5.3-6.4) TB cases. The majority (93.9%; CI: 93.4-94.4) of patient specimens were non-sputum and TB positivity was higher amongst non-sputum specimens. Further, a high proportion (5.6% CI 3.8-8.1) of infant TB cases were found to be rifampicin resistant. Covering large cities with a single lab per city over more than two years, the project demonstrated the feasibility of same-day diagnosis with upfront Xpert testing. This in turn led to prompt treatment initiation, with a two-day median turnaround time to treatment initiation. Case mortality observed in the project cohort of diagnosed TB cases was 11.0% (CI 8.4-14.1), the majority of which was pre- or early treatment mortality, in spite of prompt access to treatment for most diagnosed cases.The current project demonstrated the feasibility of applying rapid and upfront Xpert testing for presumptive infant TB cases. Rapid TB diagnosis in turn facilitates prompt and appropriate treatment initiation. Further, levels of rifampicin resistance observed in infants TB cases highlight the additional benefit of upfront resistance testing. However, high rates of early case mortality, in spite of prompt diagnosis and treatment initiation, highlight the need for further research in infant patient pathways for overall improvement in TB care for infant populations."
https://openalex.org/W2889303862,"Myeloid derived suppressor cells (MDSC) is a heterogeneous subset of immature and mature cells of the myeloid lineage, undergoing expansion during pathologic conditions, and able to perform strong immune suppressive functions. It has been shown that cryopreservation selectively impacts the polimorphonuclear (PMN) MDSC viability and recovery, and alters the correct analysis of MDSC subsets. In laboratory practice, cryopreservation is often inevitable, in particular in multicenter studies where samples have to be shipped to a centralized laboratory. Aim of the present work was to set out a new protocol to evaluate the frequency of PMN-MDSC in thawed cells by flow-cytometry. PBMC were isolated from HIV+ patients and healthy donors, and were cryopreserved for at least ten days. After thawing, two different protocols were used: 1. standard protocol (SP) consisting of staining with the antibodies mix and then fixing with formalin 1%; 2. thawed protocol (TP) in which fixation foregoes the staining with the antibodies mix. Results showed that PMN-MDSC frequency in ex vivo PBMC evaluated by means TP was comparable to that analysed by SP, indicating that the protocol did not alter PMN-MDSC quantification in ex vivo cells. We then demonstrated that PMN-MDSC frequency in thawed PBMC tested by TP was almost identical to the frequency obtained in ex vivo cells evaluated by using SP. However, we observed that after three hours of culture post-thawing, PMN-MDSC were not assessable anymore with both SP and TP. In conclusion, we herein demonstrated that fixing PBMC soon after thawing and before antibody staining allows preservation of PMN-MDSC integrity and a reliable cells quantification. Thus, it is possible to phenotipically identify PMN-MDSC in cryopreserved PBMC, consenting adequate test precision and accuracy as well as making multicentre research more feasible."
https://openalex.org/W2889343438,"Fungal strains are abundantly used throughout all areas of biotechnology and many of them are adapted to degrade complex biopolymers like chitin or lignocellulose. We therefore assembled a collection of 295 fungi from nine different habitats in Vietnam, known for its rich biodiversity, and investigated their cellulase, chitinase, xylanase and lipase activity. The collection consists of 70 isolates from wood, 55 from soil, 44 from rice straw, 3 found on fruits, 24 from oil environments (butchery), 12 from hot springs, 47 from insects as well as 27 from shrimp shells and 13 strains from crab shells. These strains were cultivated and selected by growth differences to enrich phenotypes, resulting in 211 visually different fungi. DNA isolation of 183 isolates and phylogenetic analysis was performed and 164 species were identified. All were subjected to enzyme activity assays, yielding high activities for every investigated enzyme set. In general, enzyme activity corresponded with the environment of which the strain was isolated from. Therefore, highest cellulase activity strains were isolated from wood substrates, rice straw and soil and similar substrate effects were observed for chitinase and lipase activity. Xylanase activity was similarly distributed as cellulase activity, but substantial activity was also found from fungi isolated from insects and shrimp shells. Seven strains displayed significant activities against three of the four tested substrates, while three degraded all four investigated carbon sources. The collection will be an important source for further studies. Therefore representative strains were made available to the scientific community and deposited in the public collection of the Leibniz-Institute DSMZ-German Collection of Microorganisms and Cell Cultures, Braunschweig."
https://openalex.org/W2888995619,"Brown bears (Ursus arctos) spend about half of the year in winter dens. In order to preserve energy, bears may select denning locations that minimize temperature loss and human disturbance. In expanding animal populations, demographic structure and individual behavior at the expansion front can differ from core areas. We conducted a non-invasive study of male brown bear den sites at the male-biased, low-density western expansion front of the Scandinavian brown bear population, comparing den locations to the available habitat. Compared to the higher-density population core in which intraspecific avoidance may affect den site selection of subordinate bears, we expected resource competition in the periphery to be low, and all bears to be able to select optimal den sites. In addition, bears in the periphery had access to free-ranging domestic sheep during summer. We found that males in the periphery denned on high-elevation slopes, probably providing good drainage, longer periods of consistent, insulating snow cover and fewer melting-freezing events. Forests were the principal denning habitat and no dens were found in alpine areas. The Scandinavian brown bears have a history of intense harvest, including culling at the den. This may have exerted a selection pressure to avoid denning in open alpine habitat which compared to forests provide little cover. The bears denned away from main roads and in steep, rugged terrain, probably limiting human access. The odds for finding a bear den decreased with increasing distance to the population core where females could be found. Previous studies have documented directed movement of male brown bears from the male-biased population periphery toward the core areas during the mating season. In this way, denning males may be trading off between low resource competition and access to sheep in the low-density periphery, and mating opportunities in the higher-density population core."

After grouping the patients as posterior or peripheral, we compared sex, age, intraocular pressure, best corrected visual acuity (BCVA), degree of inflammation, immunoglobulin E, eosinophil profiles, recurrence, and complications in each group. We also identified factors associated with recurrence within 1 year.A total of 29 (61.70%) patients had granuloma at the periphery, and 18 (38.30%) patients had granuloma around the posterior pole. There were no significant differences in ocular or systemic evaluations except the initial BCVA. The mean decimal BCVA of the posterior pole granuloma group was worse than that of the peripheral granuloma group (p = 0.042). After treatment, the mean BCVA of the posterior pole granuloma group improved significantly (p = 0.019), and the final mean BCVA was not significantly different between the groups (p = 0.673). Multiple logistic regression analyses revealed that recurrence within a year was associated with age at diagnosis (p = 0.007).The initial BCVA of OT patients differed according to the location of the granuloma, but the BCVA after treatment was not significantly different between the groups. Younger age was associated with recurrence within 1 year."
https://openalex.org/W2889109496,"Objective Alcohol, tobacco and cannabis use in adolescence is associated with adverse outcomes. Characterizing adolescent substance misusers, however, is difficult due to the wide range of risk and protective factors linked to substance use. The aim of the present study was to examine the role of the Individual, Family, School, Peer, and Social Environment on alcohol (lifetime and risky), tobacco (risky only), and cannabis use (lifetime and riskiness). Method Data were analyzed from a national sample of 5,680 adolescents, capturing substance use behavior alongside risk and protective factors across Individual, Family, School, Peer and Social domains. We applied a sophisticated machine learning classifier to develop models of alcohol, tobacco and cannabis initiation and misuse. Results We found highly accurate (area under curve of receiver-operator-characteristic for out-of-sample performance was > .88) and replicable (over multiple iterations and in comparison with permuted outcomes) dissociable psychosocial profiles of alcohol, tobacco and cannabis use. Alongside common predictors (peer relations and externalizing behavior), dissociable risk and resilience factors were observed. Adolescent profiles of alcohol use were distinguished by the contribution of multiple domains. In contrast, tobacco use was characterized by a small number of individual variables, including female gender and poor perceived academic position. Cannabis use was differentiated by the distinct contribution of Individual risk factors, in particular male gender and feelings of anger. Differential associations were also evident, with the strength and direction of association differing substantially across substances. Conclusion This study indicates that the relationship between the environment and substance use is more complex than previously thought."

In 2013, South Africa implemented its ""Option B"" PMTCT regimen (three-drug ART throughout pregnancy and breastfeeding, regardless of maternal CD4 count) and introduced once-daily fixed-dose combinations and lifelong ART. Currently, the uptake of Option B and its possible impact on adherence to PMTCT during the critical final months of pregnancy is unclear.We prospectively collected visit data from a cohort of adult, HIV-infected, pregnant women between July 2013-August 2014 to estimate three models of adherence to PMTCT during the final 16 weeks immediately preceding delivery. Adherence was defined according to possession of antiretroviral drugs, which was inferred from clinic visit records under varying assumptions in each model. We describe uptake of the PMTCT regimen, gestational age at initiation, and model possible scenarios of adherence through delivery after the implementation of Option B.Among 138 women enrolled (median (IQR) age 28 years (24-32), median CD4 count 378 cells/mm3), median (IQR) gestational age at initiation was 22 weeks (16-26). Estimates of adherence during the final 16 weeks of pregnancy prior to delivery ranged from 75% (52-89%) under the best case scenario assumptions to 52% (30-75%) under the worst case scenario assumptions. Estimates of the proportion of women who would achieve 80% adherence to PMTCT were <50% across all models.Despite the switch to Option B and once-daily dosing, South African women continue to initiate PMTCT late in pregnancy, and estimations of regimen adherence, as modelled using PMTCT visit attendance data, is poor, with <50% of women reaching 80% adherence during final months of pregnancy across all models. Further guideline changes and interventions are needed to achieve vertical transmission goals.ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01710397 South African National Clinical Trials Register DOH-27-0213-4177."

We assessed remission of diarrhoea, as defined by a stool consistence of five or less on the Bristol stool scale, assessed after three to six months of follow-up. Stool frequency and continence before and after three to six months of treatment were also compared by the means of Wilcoxon and McNemar's exact tests, respectively.Fourteen patients treated with somatostatin analogues were evaluable. After three to six months of follow-up, 9/14 patients (64% 95%CI = [35%; 87%]) had remission of diarrhoea. This was significantly higher than a theoretical remission rate of 20% (p = 0.0004). There was a significant decrease of daily bowel movement from 6 to 2.5 per day (p = 0.002). Twelve/14 (85%) patients had incontinence at baseline vs 8/14 (57%) after three to six months of follow-up (p = 0.134). Three out of 14 patients (21%) had a severe adverse event; two patients had hypoglycaemia, and one had endocarditis due to an injection-site bacterial infection.This study suggests that somatostatin analogues may benefit to patients with FAP and refractory diarrhoea. Approximately 20% of patients had severe adverse events, including hypoglycaemia."
https://openalex.org/W2889231654,"Simultaneous removal of organics, nitrogen and phosphorus was achieved in a bench-scale oxygen-limited membrane bioreactor (OLMBR). Due to the limited dissolved oxygen (~ 0.2 mg/L equilibrium concentration) and the increased sludge concentration associated with the hollow fiber membrane, the OLMBR was endowed with an excellent performance on the removal of multi-pollutants. The optimized removal efficiencies of COD, nitrogen (N), and total phosphorus (TP) were approximately 95.5%, 90.0% and 82.6%, respectively (COD/N/P = 500:10:1, influent loading = 5.0 kg COD·m-3·d-1, 35°C). Mass balance and bacterial community analysis indicated that the removal of organic carbon was mainly achieved by the methane production process (67.6%). Short-cut nitrification-denitrification (SCND) was observed as the primary denitrification process in the OLMBR, in which the concentrated organic compounds served as the electron donors for denitrification. Nitrosomonas was observed to be the predominant ammonium-oxidizing bacteria, while nitrite-oxidizing bacteria were almost absent in the microbial community as revealed by the high-throughput sequencing technique. In addition, Euryarchaeota and Candidatus, which were well associated with the process of denitrifying anaerobic methane oxidation, were also detected. Sludge absorption was the main route for TP removal in the OLMBR, and the production of PH3 gas also accounted for 19.4% of TP removal. This study suggested that the interception effect of hollow fiber membrane provided higher sludge concentration, therefore offering more bacteria for pollutant removal. The OLMBR can be used for simultaneous removal of highly concentrated organics and nutrients in livestock and poultry breeding wastewater."
https://openalex.org/W2889260861,"The incomplete cranium discovered at the Zlatý kůň site in the Bohemian Karst is a rare piece of skeletal evidence of human presence in Central Europe during the Late Glacial period. The relative position of cranial fragments was restored and missing parts of the cranium were virtually reconstructed using mirroring and the Thin-plate splines algorithm. The reconstruction allowed us to collect principal cranial measurements, revise a previous unfounded sex assignment and explore the specimen's morphological affinity. Visual assessment could not reliably provide a sexual diagnosis, as such methods have been developed on modern populations. Using a population-specific approach developed on cranial measurements collected from the literature on reliably sexed European Upper Palaeolithic specimens, linear discriminant analysis confirmed previous assignment to the female sex. However, caution is necessary with regard to the fact that it was assessed from the skull. The Zlatý kůň specimen clearly falls within the range of Upper Palaeolithic craniometric variation. Despite the shift in cranial variation that accompanied the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM), the Zlatý kůň skull exhibits a morphological affinity with the pre-LGM population. Several interpretations are proposed with regard to the complex population processes that occurred after the LGM in Europe."
https://openalex.org/W2889066118,"Measurements of energy balance components (energy intake, energy expenditure, changes in energy stores) are often plagued with measurement error. Doubly-labeled water can measure energy intake (EI) with negligible error, but is expensive and cumbersome. An alternative approach that is gaining popularity is to use the energy balance principle, by measuring energy expenditure (EE) and change in energy stores (ES) and then back-calculate EI. Gold standard methods for EE and ES exist and are known to give accurate measurements, albeit at a high cost. We propose a joint statistical model to assess the measurement error in cheaper, non-intrusive measures of EE and ES. We let the unknown true EE and ES for individuals be latent variables, and model them using a bivariate distribution. We try both a bivariate Normal as well as a Dirichlet Process Mixture Model, and compare the results via simulation. Our approach, is the first to account for the dependencies that exist in individuals' daily EE and ES. We employ semiparametric regression with free knot splines for measurements with error, and linear components for error free covariates. We adopt a Bayesian approach to estimation and inference and use Reversible Jump Markov Chain Monte Carlo to generate draws from the posterior distribution. Based on the semiparameteric regression, we develop a calibration equation that adjusts a cheaper, less reliable estimate, closer to the true value. Along with this calibrated value, our method also gives credible intervals to assess uncertainty. A simulation study shows our calibration helps produce a more accurate estimate. Our approach compares favorably in terms of prediction to other commonly used models."
https://openalex.org/W2889529505,"The impact of preoperative depressive symptoms on quality of life (QOL) after laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC) remains unclear. The purpose of this study was to develop a benchmark for capturing the burden of depressive symptoms on QOL after LC and for supporting evidence-based clinical interventions for remediating these effects.Patients diagnosed with depressive symptoms (Beck Depression Inventory score > 13) after LC (n = 336) were classified into a depressive symptoms group. Propensity score matching was then used to match them with 336 patients in a non-depressive symptoms group for all potential confounding factors. All patients completed the 36-item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36) and the Gastrointestinal Quality of Life Index (GIQLI) at baseline and at 2 years postoperatively. The 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for differences in responsiveness estimates were derived by bootstrap estimation.The GIQLI results revealed that the non-depressive symptoms group had relatively stronger responses for emotional impairment (4.10, 95% CI 2.81 to 5.39) and social impairment (4.06, 95% CI 2.65 to 5.46) in comparison with the depressive symptoms group. In the SF-36, the non-depressive symptoms group also had stronger responses for role emotional (12.63, 95% CI 10.73 to 14.54), social functioning (11.25, 95% CI 9.85 to 12.65), vitality (3.81, 95% CI 2.82 to 4.81), mental health (11.97, 95% CI 10.36 to 13.56) and general health (3.84, 95% CI 2.95 to 4.75).Depressive symptoms complicate the management of LC patients and are associated with poorer outcomes. Because depressive symptoms are very common, further studies are needed to evaluate integrated and comprehensive approaches for assessing and treating these symptoms."
