https://openalex.org/W2054998458,"Trophic factor deprivation (TFD) activates c-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNKs), culminating in coordinate AP1-dependent transactivation of the BH3-only BCL-2 proteins BIMEL and HRK, which in turn are critical for BAX-dependent cytochrome c release, caspase activation, and apoptosis. Here, we report that TFD caused not only induction but also phosphorylation of BIMEL. Mitochondrially localized JNKs but not upstream activators, like mixed-lineage kinases (MLKs) or mitogen-activated protein kinase kinases (MKKs), specifically phosphorylated BIMEL at Ser65, potentiating its proapoptotic activity. Inhibition of the JNK pathway attenuated BIMEL expression, prevented BIMEL phosphorylation, and abrogated TFD-induced apoptosis. Conversely, activation of this pathway promoted BIMEL expression and phosphorylation, causing BIM- and BAX-dependent cell death. Thus, JNKs regulate the proapoptotic activity of BIMEL during TFD, both transcriptionally and posttranslationally."

Here we show in adult mice that depriving the dominant contralateral eye of vision leads to a persistent, NMDA receptor-dependent enhancement of the weak ipsilateral-eye inputs. These data provide in vivo evidence for metaplasticity as a mechanism for binocular competition and demonstrate that an ocular dominance shift can occur solely by the mechanisms of response enhancement. They also show that adult mouse visual cortex has a far greater potential for experience-dependent plasticity than previously appreciated. These insights may force a revision in how data on ocular dominance plasticity in mutant mice have been interpreted."

We tested cAMP analogs for ability to selectively activate Epac1 or cAPK and discriminate between the binding sites of Epac and of cAPKI and cAPKII. We found that commonly used cAMP analogs, like 8-Br-cAMP and 8-pCPT-cAMP, activate Epac and cAPK equally as well as cAMP, i.e. were full agonists. In contrast, 6-modified cAMP analogs, like N6-benzoyl-cAMP, were inefficient Epac activators and full cAPK activators. Analogs modified in the 2′-position of the ribose induced stronger Epac1 activation than cAMP but were only partial agonists for cAPK. 2′-O-Alkyl substitution of cAMP improved Epac/cAPK binding selectivity 10–100-fold. Phenylthio substituents in position 8, particularly with MeO- or Cl- in p-position, enhanced the Epac/cAPK selectivity even more. The combination of 8-pCPT- and 2′-O-methyl substitutions improved the Epac/cAPK binding selectivity about three orders of magnitude. The cAPK selectivity of 6-substituted cAMP analogs, the preferential inhibition of cAPK by moderate concentrations of Rp-cAMPS analogs, and the Epac selectivity of 8-pCPT-2′-O-methyl-cAMP was also demonstrated in intact cells. Using these compounds to selectively modulate Epac and cAPK in PC-12 cells, we observed that analogs selectively activating Epac synergized strongly with cAPK specific analogs to induce neurite outgrowth. We therefore conclude that cAMP-induced neurite outgrowth is mediated by both Epac and cAPK.

Epac1 has an N-terminal DEP (dishevelled, Egl-10, pleckstrin) domain, involved in membrane docking (9de Rooij J. Rehmann H. van Triest M. Cool R.H. Wittinghofer A. Bos J.L. J. Biol.

There is increasing but still modest knowledge about the biological consequences of cAMP activation of endogenous Epac in intact cells. Epac appears not to mediate modulation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase activity by cAMP (13Enserink J.M. Christensen A.E. de Rooij J. van Triest M. Schwede F. Genieser H.G. Døskeland S.O.

Less is known about how cAMP signaling through cAPK and Epac might be integrated, but there is evidence that overexpressed Epac1 can activate Akt/protein kinase B, whereas stimulation of cAPK inhibits Akt/protein kinase B (18Mei F.C.

Chem. 2002; 277: 11497-11504Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar), suggesting that Epac and cAPK serve opposite functions. The aim of the present study was to develop and identify cyclic nucleotide analogs that could help distinguish the roles of cAPK and Epac1 in intact cells. We obtained first a detailed map of the cAMP binding site of Epac1 using more than 50 analogs, many of which are novel. We studied next the ability of selected analogs to activate Epac and cAPK in vitro. We found that 2′-O-alkyl-modified cAMP analogs were only partial agonists of cAPK activation, while being stronger than cAMP itself as activators of Epac. On the other hand, several 6-modified cAMP analogs were full cAPK agonists and poor agonists of Epac activation, even if they bound well to Epac. Intact cell studies confirmed the cAPK specificity of 6-modified analogs and the Epac specificity of 2′-O-Me-cAMP analogs like 8-pCPT-2′-O-Me-cAMP. Using these analogs as tools we showed that Epac acted synergistically with NGF to promote neurite extension in PC-12 rat pheochromocytoma cells, a model for neuronal differentiation (19Richter-Landsberg C. Jastorff B. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 102: 821-829Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 20Vaudry D. Stork P.J. Lazarovici P. Eiden L.E. Science. 2002; 296: 1648-1649Crossref PubMed Scopus (696) Google Scholar). Activation of Epac sensitized the cells toward cAPK. This is the first demonstration that Epac and cAPK act in synergy to mediate a cAMP effect. Cyclic Nucleotide Analogs—The cAMP and cGMP analogs modified only in the purine ring or the cyclic phosphate ring and all 2′-deoxy cAMP analogs were provided by BIOLOG Life Science Institute, Bremen, Germany. 2′-O-Ethyl-, 2′-O-propyl-, 2′-O-butyl-, and 2′-O-isobutyl-cAMP were kindly provided by Drs. B. Jastorff and J. Kruppa, Bio-Organic Unit, University of Bremen, Bremen, Germany. 8-Br-2′-O-Methyladenosine was phosphorylated and cyclized in a one pot reaction to 8-Br-2′-O-Me-cAMP as described earlier (21Genieser H.G. Butt E. Bottin U. Dostmann W.R. Jastorff B. Synthesis. 1989; 1: 53-54Crossref Scopus (24) Google Scholar). 8-pCPT-2′-O-Me-cAMP was synthesized by nucleophilic substitution (22Miller J.P. Boswell K.H. Muneyama K. Simon L.N. Robins R.K. Shuman D.A. Biochemistry. 1973; 12: 5310-5319Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) of 8-Br-2′-O-Me-cAMP. Other 8-substituted 2′-O-Me-cAMP analogs were synthesized essentially as described for 8-pCPT-2′-O-Me-cAMP. 8-pCPT-2′-O-Me-cAMP benzyl ester was prepared from 8-pCPT-2′-O-Me-cAMP by alkylation with benzyl bromide (23Furuta T. Torigai H. Osawa T. Iwamura M. J. Chem. Soc. Perkin. Trans. 1993; 24: 3139-3142Crossref Scopus (22) Google Scholar). All analogs, including the axial and equatorial stereoisomers of 8-pCPT-2′-O-Me-cAMP benzyl ester, were purified by reversed phase high pressure liquid chromatography (YMC ODS-120A; 10 μm) and isolated to purity >98%. The structure of each analog was confirmed by UV-visible and electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry analysis (8-Br-2′-O-Me-cAMP and 8-pCPT-2′-O-Me-cAMP also by 1H NMR and 31P NMR). Epac and cAPK Purification—Recombinant GST-hEpac1fl, GST-hEpac12–329, GST-hEpac1149–318, GST-hEpac1149–881, GST-hRIα, and His-hRIIα were expressed in E. coli BL21 cells. The GST fusion proteins were adsorbed to GST-agarose and either eluted with glutathione, or the GST cleaved off in situ with thrombin (7de Rooij J. Zwartkruis F.J. Verheijen M.H. Cool R.H.

The proteins were further purified by size exclusion fast protein liquid chromatography as described (24Kopperud R. Christensen A.E. Kjærland E. Viste K. Kleivdal H. Døskeland S.O. J. Biol.

Determination of [3H]cAMP Binding to the R Subunits of cAPK and to Epac1—An extensively validated ammonium sulfate precipitation method was used to assay [3H]cAMP bound to the RI and RII subunits of cAPK (26D⊘skeland S.O. Øgreid D. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 159: 147-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). To determine [3H]cAMP bound to the more rapidly exchanging binding site of Epac we used cold (–10 °C) 98% saturated ammonium sulfate. Unbound isotope was removed by immediate filtering and rinsing with 1 ml of the ammonium sulfate solution. A size-exclusion chromatography method (27Hummel J.P. Dreyer W.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1962; 63: 530-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (929) Google Scholar) was used to assay the binding of [3H]cAMP to Epac under strict equilibrium conditions. The buffer (Buffer A; 15 mm Hepes, pH 7.2, with 1 mm Na2PO4, 130 mm KCl, 2 mm Mg(CH3COO)2, 2 mm glutathione, 0.1 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 0.3 mm EGTA, 1 mm EDTA, 0.2 mm AMP, and 0.2 mg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor) had near physiological pH and ionic strength. To assay for [3H]cAMP without interference from cAMP-induced Epac precipitation GST-Epac was attached to GSH-coated Flashplates (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). To determine [3H]cAMP binding, the plates were incubated with Buffer A (0.1 ml) and various concentrations of [3H]cAMP and analyzed (at 25 °C) in a TopCount NXT scintillation counter (Packard, Meriden, CT). Determination of the cAMP Analog Binding Affinity for Sites A and B of RI and RII and for Epac1—The equilibrium inhibition constant of binding (Ki) of cAMP analog was determined by competitive displacement of [3H]cAMP binding to R or Epac. The analog affinity relative to cAMP (K′ i analog) is Ki cAMP/Ki analog. The determination of K′ i analog for Epac was, in principle, as described previously (28Schwede F. Christensen A. Liauw S. Hippe T. Kopperud R. Jastorff B. Døskeland S.O. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 8803-8812Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) and validated for RI and RII. In Vitro Assay of Epac-induced Rap Activation and cAMP-dependent Protein Kinase Activity—Cyclic AMP analogs were tested for in vitro Rap1 or Rap2 activation by determination of their effect on the rate of Epac-induced fluorescent GDP analog (3′-O-(N-methylantraniloyl)-GDP) exchange from Rap (9de Rooij J. Rehmann H. van Triest M. Cool R.H. Wittinghofer A. Bos J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20829-20836Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). The determination of cAMP analog effects on protein kinase activity was routinely by incubation for 40 min at 37 °C in Buffer A with 1 mm [γ-32P]ATP, using kemptide as substrate (24Kopperud R.

Assay of cAMP Analog Actions in Intact Cells—The activation of Rap was determined by GST pull-down assay as described (29van Triest M. de Rooij J. Bos J.L. Methods Enzymol. 2001; 333: 343-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), except that NaF was omitted, and 5 mm Mg(CH3COO)2 added in lysis and wash buffers. The amount of immobilized Ral-GDS-RBD-GST protein (where GDS is GDP dissociation stimulator and RBD is Ras binding domain) used to capture Rap1-GTP was in excess to ensure that variation in pipetting error of the slurry would not affect the pull down of Rap-GTP. Phospho-CREB was determined by Western blotting using the Ab5322 (a kind gift from Dr. M. Montminy, Salk Institute, La Jolla, CA) and compared with the amount of total CREB using a non-discriminating CREB antibody (number 9192; www.cellsignal.com). Primary dog thyroid cells were cultured and assessed for rounding as described earlier (5Dremier S. Pohl V. Poteet-Smith C. Roger P.P. Corbin J. Døskeland S.O. Dumont J.E. Maenhaut C. Mol.

The cells were kept for 20 h in intact medium after seeding and 1 h with low (5% horse and 2.5% fetal calf) serum, before being stimulated with cAMP analog or NGF for 3 to 72 h, and fixed for evaluation by phase and differential interference contrast microscopy (31Sandal T.

Molecular Modeling—The structures of the CNBDs A and B of RIα (Protein Data Bank accession code 1RGS) (4Su Y. Dostmann W.R. Herberg F.W. Durick K. Xuong N.H. Ten Eyck L. Taylor S.S. Varughese K.I. Science. 1995; 269: 807-813Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar) were used as templates to construct a structural model of the CNBD of Epac1. The model obtained using the Homology module of InsightII 2000 (MSI found at www.msi.com) was similar to that obtained by the Swiss-Pdb Viewer in conjunction with SWISS-MODEL (32Guex N. Peitsch M.C. Electrophoresis. 1997; 18: 2714-2723Crossref PubMed Scopus (9399) Google Scholar). Final optimization of the structure of the complexes was performed using Discover (MSI). The programs InsightII (MSI) and WebLab Viewer (MSI) were used to prepare the figures. Binding of [3H]cAMP and cAMP Analogs to Full-length Epac1, the CNBD Fragment of Epac, and Sites AI, BI, AII, and BII of cAPK—The isolated CNBD (Epac149–318) of Epac is well expressed and does not aggregate in the presence of cAMP, unlike Epacfl and Epac149–881 (25Krämer A. Rehmann H.R. Cool R.H. Theiss C. de Rooij J. Bos J.L. Wittinghofer A. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 306: 1167-1177Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). To know whether the binding properties of CNBD are relevant for full-length Epac, we compared their affinity for cAMP. The isolated CNBD (Epac149–318) of Epac1 bound [3H]cAMP with an apparent KD of 2.9 μm (Fig. 1, B and C) at close to physiological pH (7.2) and ionic strength, as determined by the time-honored size exclusion gel chromatography method (27Hummel J.P. Dreyer W.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1962; 63: 530-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (929) Google Scholar). To prevent aggregation, we anchored GST-Epacfl and GST-Epac149–881 to GSH-coated plates with intrinsic scintillant and determined [3H]cAMP binding by scintillation proximity assay. GST-Epacfl and GST-Epac149–881 bound [3H]cAMP with an apparent KD of 2.8 μm (Fig. 1D). We conclude that the CNBD of Epac has the same affinity for cAMP whether in a 170-residue peptide (Epac149–318) or included in the full-length Epac molecule. Cyclic AMP analog mapping of the binding sites of Epac1, RI and RII, was undertaken to probe for differences between the Epac and R subunit binding sites. We showed first that the estimated K′ i of cAMP analogs for binding to Epac149–318 was similar whether assayed by the routine ammonium sulfate precipitation method or the equilibrium binding chromatography assay (Fig. 2). Mapping data for analogs modified only in the adenine moiety are shown in Table I. We noted that the commonly used cAPK activators 8-Br-cAMP, 8-AHA-cAMP, and particularly 8-pCPT-cAMP had higher affinity than cAMP itself for Epac. No analog was severely restricted from binding to Epac, whereas several had very low K′ i for binding to one or more of the binding sites of RIα (AI, BI) or RIIα (AII, BII). All the R subunit binding sites discriminated better than Epac against cGMP (Table I). The modestly (12-fold) decreased K′ i of cGMP for Epac was because of a combined effect of the introduction of 2-NH2 and 6=O into the cAMP molecule (Table I). The Sp- and Rp-diastereoisomers of cAMPS bound to Epac with a relative affinity similar to that for the cAPK sites (Table II).

A more detailed survey of 8-substituted analogs of 2′-O-Me-cAMP indicated that the highest affinity was achieved when the S-phenyl ring was substituted in the para-position with a polar group, like Cl–, HO–, O-methyl (Table II), or F– (not shown). Comparison of cAMP Analogs as Modulators of cAPK and Epac Activity in Vitro and in Intact Cells—It is not known whether cAMP analogs modified in the 2′-position are full or partial agonists for cAPK. We found that 2′-O-Me-cAMP, 8-Br-2′-O-Me-cAMP, and 8-pCPT-2′-O-Me-cAMP failed to activate cAPK completely in vitro (Figs. 3, 4, 5). This indicates that 2′-O-Me analogs of cAMP are only partial agonists with respect to activation of cAPK. At near physiological concentration (300–600 nm) of R subunit (24Kopperud R. Christensen A.E.

The compounds 8-pCPT-2′-O-Me-cAMP, 8-pHPT-2′-O-Me-cAMP, and 8-pMeOPT-2′-O-Me-cAMP all stimulated the dissociation of GDP more strongly than cAMP or 8-Br-cAMP (Fig. 6A and data not shown). We conclude that 2′-O-Me-cAMP analogs super-activate Epac. All cAMP analogs modified in the 6-position of the adenine ring, including cPuMP, 6-Cl-cPuMP, cIMP, cGMP, 6-MB-cAMP, 6-Bnz-cAMP, and to a lesser extent 6-Phe-cAMP, were only partial Epac agonists (data for 6-Bnz-cAMP are shown in Fig. 6A). Furthermore, the partial stimulation was observed at a higher concentration than expected from the analog affinity for free Epac (not shown). In fibroblasts with enforced expression of Rap1 and Epac1, the analogs 6-MB-cAMP and 6-Bnz-cAMP stimulated strongly the phosphorylation of the cAPK substrate CREB but failed to activate Rap1 (not shown). Preferential stimulation by 6-modified cAMP analog of CREB phosphorylation was observed also in primary dog thyrocytes. In these cells rounding is a specific reaction to cAPK (5Dremier S. Pohl V. Poteet-Smith C. Roger P.P. Corbin J. Døskeland S.O. Dumont J.E. Maenhaut C. Mol. Cell Biol. 1997; 17: 6717-6726Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Cell rounding was induced by 6-MB-cAMP (Fig. 7A) and 6-Bnz-cAMP (not shown) without Rap1 activation (Fig. 7A). In contrast, 8-pCPT-cAMP and the adenylate cyclase activator forskolin induced Rap activation, CREB phosphorylation, and cell rounding, whereas 8-pCPT-2′-O-Me-cAMP only induced Rap activation (Fig. 7A). We conclude that 6-modified cAMP analogs, notably 6-Bnz-cAMP and 6-MB-cAMP, may be useful to preferentially activate cAPK in intact cells. It was of interest to know whether Rp-cAMPS analogs could be used to inhibit Epac, and we used Rp-8-p-CPT-cAMPS to test this hypothesis, because this compound had a high affinity for Epac (Table II). Rp-8-pCPT-cAMPS is an inhibitor of both cAPKI and cAPKII in intact cells (33Schwede F. Maronde E. Genieser H. Jastorff B. Pharmacol. Ther. 2000; 87: 199-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar, 35Gjertsen B.T. Mellgren G. Otten A. Maronde E. Genieser H.G. Jastorff B. Vintermyr O.K. McKnight G.S. Døskeland S.O. J. Biol.

It was a very weak Epac agonist in vitro (Fig. 6B) and did not activate Rap in intact thyrocytes (Fig. 7A). Rp-8-pCPT-cAMPS had a weak ability to counteract 8-Br-cAMP-induced Rap activation in vitro (Fig. 6B) although it could inhibit 8-pCPT-cAMP-induced Rap activation in thyrocytes when present at high concentration. The compound was a stronger inhibitor of CREB phosphorylation and rounding than of Rap activation in thyrocytes (Fig. 7, B and C). This suggests that Rp-8-pCPT-cAMPS would have to be modified to act as a specific Epac antagonist in intact cells. Rp-8-Br-cAMPS, which inhibits cAPKI in intact cells (35Gjertsen B.T. Mellgren G.

https://openalex.org/W2078758148,"When learned associations are recalled from long-term memory stores by presentation of an unreinforced conditioned stimulus (CS), two processes are initiated. One, termed reconsolidation, re-activates the association between the conditioned and unconditioned stimuli and transfers it from a stable protein synthesis-independent form of storage to a more labile protein-dependent state. The other is an extinction process in which presentation of the CS alone degrades the association between CS and US. To address the mechanistic relationship between reconsolidation and extinction, we have used an invertebrate model of contextual memory, which involves an association between the learning context and a visual danger stimulus. Here, we show that re-exposure duration to the learning context acts as a switch guiding the memory course toward reconsolidation or extinction, each depending on protein synthesis. Manipulation of this variable allows findings of impaired extinction to be discriminated from those of disrupted reconsolidation."
https://openalex.org/W1986552075,"Axon pruning is widely used for the refinement of neural circuits in both vertebrates and invertebrates, and may also contribute to the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases. However, little is known about the cellular and molecular mechanisms of axon pruning. We use the stereotyped pruning of gamma neurons of the Drosophila mushroom bodies (MB) during metamorphosis to investigate these mechanisms. Detailed time course analyses indicate that MB axon pruning is mediated by local degeneration rather than retraction and that the disruption of the microtubule cytoskeleton precedes axon pruning. In addition, multiple lines of genetic evidence demonstrate an intrinsic role of the ubiquitin-proteasome system in axon pruning; for example, loss-of-function mutations of the ubiquitin activating enzyme (E1) or proteasome subunits in MB neurons block axon pruning. Our findings suggest that some forms of axon pruning during development may share similarities with degeneration of axons in response to injury."

In patients with primary bile acid malabsorption, mutations in the ileal bile acid transporter gene (Slc10a2) lead to congenital diarrhea, steatorrhea, and reduced plasma cholesterol levels. To elucidate the quantitative role of Slc10a2 in intestinal bile acid absorption, the Slc10a2 gene was disrupted by homologous recombination in mice. Animals heterozygous (Slc10a2 + / –) and homozygous (Slc10a2 – / –) for this mutation were physically indistinguishable from wild type mice. In the Slc10a2 – / – mice, fecal bile acid excretion was elevated 10- to 20-fold and was not further increased by feeding a bile acid binding resin. Despite increased bile acid synthesis, the bile acid pool size was decreased by 80% and selectively enriched in cholic acid in the Slc10a2 – / – mice. On a low fat diet, the Slc10a2 – / – mice did not have steatorrhea. Fecal neutral sterol excretion was increased only 3-fold, and intestinal cholesterol absorption was reduced only 20%, indicating that the smaller cholic acid-enriched bile acid pool was sufficient to facilitate intestinal lipid absorption. Liver cholesteryl ester content was reduced by 50% in Slc10a2 – / – mice, and unexpectedly plasma high density lipoprotein cholesterol levels were slightly elevated. These data indicate that Slc10a2 is essential for efficient intestinal absorption of bile acids and that alternative absorptive mechanisms are unable to compensate for loss of Slc10a2 function.

These data indicate that Slc10a2 is essential for efficient intestinal absorption of bile acids and that alternative absorptive mechanisms are unable to compensate for loss of Slc10a2 function. Bile acids are synthesized from cholesterol in the liver and secreted into the small intestine where they facilitate the absorption of dietary lipids and fat-soluble vitamins. The majority of bile acids are reabsorbed from the intestine, returned to the liver via the portal venous circulation, and resecreted into bile (1Hofmann A.F. Arias I.M. Boyer J.L. Fausto N. Jakoby W.B. Schachter D.A. Shafritz D.A. The Liver: Biology and Pathobiology. Raven Press, New York1994: 677-717Google Scholar). The enterohepatic circulation of bile acids is an extremely efficient process; less than 10% of intestinal bile acids escape reabsorption and are eliminated in the feces. In the intestine, bile acids are reclaimed through a combination of passive absorption in the jejunum, active transport in the distal ileum, and passive absorption in the colon (2Hofmann A.F. Johnson L.R. Physiology of the Gastrointestinal Tract. Raven Press, New York1994: 1845-1865Google Scholar). Bile acids are actively transported in the terminal ileum by the well characterized ileal apical sodium bile acid cotransporter (ASBT 1The abbreviations used are: ASBT, apical sodium bile acid transporter; BBMV, brush border membrane vesicles; CYP7A1, cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase; FTR, fractional turnover rate; Oatp, organic anion transporting polypeptide; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography; HDL, high density lipoprotein; VLDL, very low density lipoprotein; LDL, low density lipoprotein.1The abbreviations used are: ASBT, apical sodium bile acid transporter; BBMV, brush border membrane vesicles; CYP7A1, cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase; FTR, fractional turnover rate; Oatp, organic anion transporting polypeptide; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography; HDL, high density lipoprotein; VLDL, very low density lipoprotein; LDL, low density lipoprotein.; gene name Slc10a2) (3Shneider B.L.

Sleisenger and Fordtran's Gastrointestinal and Liver Disease. W. B. Saunders, Co., Philadelphia, PA2002: 1051-1064Google Scholar). This sodium- and potential-driven transporter moves bile acids from the lumen of the small intestine across the apical brush border membrane. Bile acids are then shuttled to the basolateral membrane and secreted into the portal circulation.Several observations support the concept that the terminal ileum is the major site of bile acid reabsorption, including the finding that there is little decrease in intraluminal bile acid concentration prior to the ileum (5Hepner G.W. Demers L.M. Gastroenterology. 1977; 72: 499-510Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) and the appearance of bile acid malabsorption after ileal resection (6Hofmann A.F. Poley J.R.

Gastroenterology. 1996; 110: 459-468Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) have also demonstrated that ileal active bile acid transport is a high capacity system sufficient to account for the biliary output of bile acids. Finally, patients with a rare inherited Slc10a2 defect exhibit bile acid malabsorption, refractory infantile diarrhea, steatorrhea, and failure to thrive (primary bile acid malabsorption), underscoring the importance of Slc10a2 in the human infant (10Oelkers P. Kirby L.C. Heubi J.E. Dawson P.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 1880-1887Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar, 11Heubi J.E. Balistreri W.F. Fondacaro J.D. Partin J.C. Schubert W.K. Gastroenterology. 1982; 83: 804-811Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The consensus from these studies was that the ileal active transport system is a major route for bile acid uptake, but passive absorption present down the length of the intestine may also be significant. Thus, the overall quantitative contribution of passive jejunal and/or colonic bile acid absorption is not known. To resolve this question and to further understand the role of Slc10a2 in bile acid and cholesterol homeostasis, we have produced a line of mice with a targeted disruption in the Slc10a2 gene.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESGeneration of Slc10a2 – / – Mice—The targeting vector was constructed as shown (see Fig. 1A). The Slc10a2 region extending from intron 2 through the splice acceptor site of exon 4 was replaced with a neomycin-containing cassette in the pPNT vector (12Tybulewicz V.L.J. Crawford C.E. Jackson P.K. Bronson R.T. Mulligan R.C. Cell. 1991; 65: 1153-1163Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1158) Google Scholar). The targeting vector was linearized by cleavage with NotI and introduced by electroporation into mouse embryonic stem cells as described (13Koller B.H. Kim H. Latour A.M. Brigman K. Boucher R.C. Scambler P. Wainwright B. Smithies O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 1991; 88: 10730-10734Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Appropriate targeting of the Slc10a2 allele was confirmed by Southern blotting (see Fig. 6A in Supplemental Material). Male chimeric progeny were crossed with female C57BL/6J (Jackson Laboratory) and 129S6/SvEv (Taconic) mice to generate two independent lines of mice carrying the disrupted Slc10a2 allele. Unless indicated, the congenic 129S6/SvEv line was used for the experiments in this study.Animals and Diet—All animal procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Mice were maintained on a prepared basal diet (14Rudel L.L. Kelley K. Sawyer J.K. Shah R. Wilson M.D. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1998; 18: 1818-1827Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar) supplemented with vitamins, cholesterol, or a bile acid binding resin as required. The basal diet contains 16% fat, 20% protein, 64% carbohydrate (% of calories), and 0.017 mg/calorie of cholesterol (0.006%) (w/w). The diets for all pregnant and nursing dams were initially supplemented with vitamins (ADEKs pediatric drops; ScandiPharm, Inc., Birmingham, AL); however, this supplementation was later shown to be unnecessary for survival of the Slc10a2 null progeny. The compositions of the experimental diets used in these studies are shown in Table III of the Supplemental Material.RNA Analyses—Total RNA was extracted from frozen tissue using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) as suggested by the manufacturer. For Northern blot analysis, total RNA from individual animals or pools of animals of the same sex and genotype was fractionated on 1.2% (w/v) agarose gels containing 2.2 m formaldehyde, transferred to Nytran (0.45 μm; Schleicher & Schuell), and hybridized with the indicated 32P-labeled random hexamer-primed DNA probes. Expression levels were quantified using a PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences).Preparation of Intestinal BBMV and Measurement of Ileal Bile Acid Transporter Protein and Activity—Small intestines from wild type and Slc10a2 null mice (mixed C57BL/6:129S6/SvEv background) were divided into five sections of equal length and used to isolate brush border membranes by the calcium precipitation method (15Kessler M. Acuto O. Storelli C. Murer H. Muller M. Semenza G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1978; 506: 136-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (1017) Google Scholar).

The blots were also probed using mouse anti-β-actin antibody as a control for protein loading.Fecal Bile Acid and Lipid Excretion—Wild type and Slc10a2 null mice in the congenic 129S6/SvEv background were individually housed in wire bottom cages, and stools were collected for 3 days. The stools were extracted as described by Turley et al. (18Turley S.D. Daggy B.P. Dietschy J.M. J. Cardiovasc.

An aliquot of pooled plasma from five animals in each group was fractionated on a 30 × 1-cm Superose 6 column, and the cholesterol content of each lipoprotein fraction was detected using an on-line enzymatic assay. Hepatic triglyceride content was determined by enzymatic assay (29Carr T.P. Parks J.S. Rudel L.L. Arterioscler. Thromb. 1992; 12: 1274-1283Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Hepatic free and total cholesterol was determined by gas-liquid chromatography (14Rudel L.L. Kelley K. Sawyer J.K. Shah R. Wilson M.D. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1998; 18: 1818-1827Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar).Statistical Analyses—Mean values ± S.E. are shown. The data were evaluated for statistically significant differences using the two-tailed Student's t test assuming equal variance. The data from the diet studies were evaluated using analysis of variance with post hoc analysis for individual group differences by the Fisher's protected least significant difference test (Statview; Mountain View, CA). Differences were considered statistically significant at p < 0.05.RESULTSInactivation of the Slc10a2 Gene in Mice—The region extending from intron 2 through the splice acceptor site of exon 4 was replaced with a neomycin-containing cassette by homologous recombination (Fig. 1A). Gene disruption was confirmed by Southern blotting (see Fig. 6A in Supplemental Material), Northern blotting (Fig. 1B), and immunoblotting (Fig. 1B). No ASBT mRNA or immunoreactive protein was detected in the distal small intestine of Slc10a2 null mice. ASBT is thought to be the only sodium bile acid cotransporter expressed in the ileal apical brush border membrane (30Wong M.H. Oelkers P. Craddock A.L. Dawson P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1340-1347Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To directly test this hypothesis, apical BBMV were isolated and used to measure sodium-dependent taurocholate uptake. In ileal BBMV from wild type mice, [3H]taurocholate (25 μm) uptake was increased 42-fold in the presence of an inwardly directed Na+ gradient compared (p < 0.0001). In contrast, there was no Na+-dependent taurocholate uptake in ileal BBMV isolated from Slc10a2 null mice (Fig. 1C). The integrity of the BBMV preparations was confirmed by measuring Na+-alanine cotransport. Na+-coupled [3H]alanine uptake (125 μm) was similar in BBMV isolated from both mouse genotypes (Slc10a2 + / +, 175 ± 35 pmol/mg protein/15 s versus Slc10a2 – / –, 218 ± 60 pmol/mg protein/15 s; p > 0.5).Analysis of the Slc10a2 – / – Mice—The Slc10a2 – / – mice are viable and fertile. Crossing heterozygous mice produced a Mendelian distribution of wild type and mutant genotypes. The Slc10a2 – / – mice were indistinguishable in terms of survival, gross appearance, and behaviors from Slc10a2 + / – and wild type animals. A small growth deficit was observed in male but not female Slc10a2 null mice compared with wild type littermates prior to weaning at day 21 (data not shown). However, the ∼20% decrease in body weight of male Slc10a2 – / – pups was only transitory, and adult body weights and daily fecal excretion (dry weight) were similar between the different genotypes (see Fig. 7, A and B in Supplemental Material). This phenotype is very different from that originally reported for the Cyp7a1 null mice (31Ishibashi S. Schwarz M. Frykman P.K. Herz J. Russell D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18017-18023Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar, 32Schwarz M. Lund E.G. Setchell K.D.R. Kayden H.J. Zerwekh J.E. Björkem I. Herz J. Russell D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18024-18031Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). The Cyp7a1 – / – mice fail to thrive and experience a very high rate of postnatal mortality unless supplemented with exogenous fat-soluble vitamins and cholic acid. In contrast, survival of Slc10a2 – / – mice was indistinguishable from wild type littermates regardless of vitamin supplementation for the pregnant and nursing dams.Possible explanations for the normal postnatal phenotype of the Slc10a2 – / – mice include alternative intestinal uptake mechanisms that compensate for the loss of Slc10a2 function, increased bile acid synthesis that is able to compensate for the intestinal bile acid loss, or other metabolic adaptations that are able to maintain fat absorption and lipid homeostasis. To distinguish among these possibilities, bile acid and lipid metabolism was examined in the wild type and Slc10a2 – / – mice. As shown in Fig. 2A, fecal bile acid excretion was elevated 24- and 11-fold in male and female Slc10a2 – / – mice, respectively. Analysis of the fecal bile acid composition by electrospray mass spectrometry revealed that both genotypes excrete similar bile acid species; however, the total amount of bile acids excreted was greater in the Slc10a2 null mice. These results indicate that alternative intestinal uptake mechanisms are not compensating for the active ileal absorption.Fig. 2Fecal lipid excretion and bile acid pool size in wild type and Slc10a2 null mice. Mean values ± S.E. are shown. A, fecal bile acid excretion was measured as described under “Experimental Procedures” (n = 10). Bile acid excretion in Slc10a2 – / – mice was significantly greater (*, p < 0.0001 for males and p = 0.0002 for females) than for the wild type mice. B, the mass of bile acid in the enterohepatic circulation was determined by extraction, purification, and quantitation using HPLC (n = 6–10). The Slc10a2 – / – mice had a significantly decreased total bile acid pool size (*p < 0.0001), as well as decreased amounts of taurocholate (p < 0.0001) and tauro-β-muricholate (p < 0.001 for males and p = 0.0002 for females). The small amount of other bile acids in the pool were not significantly different between the two genotypes (p > 0.05). C, fecal neutral sterols and fatty acids were quantitated by gas chromatography (n = 10). The Slc10a2 – / – mice had significantly increased total fat excretion (*, p < 0.0001 for males and p = 0.0001 for females), fatty acid excretion (p < 0.0001 for males and p = 0.0001 for females), and neutral sterol excretion (p < 0.0001). D, intestinal cholesterol absorption was measured by a dual isotope fecal assay (n = 10). The Slc10a2 – / – mice had significantly decreased intestinal cholesterol absorption (*, p = 0.026 for males and p = 0.0009 for females).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Increased bile acid synthesis is a well recognized mechanism to compensate for disruption of the enterohepatic circulation of bile acids (33Russell D.W.

Lipid Res. 2001; 42: 1594-1603Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To determine whether synthesis is able to compensate in the Slc10a2 null mice, the bile acid pool size and composition were measured. As shown in Fig. 2B, the total bile acid pool was decreased 83 and 80% in the Slc10a2 – / – males and females, respectively. A crude fractional turnover rate (FTR) can be calculated, because the daily rate of fecal bile acid excretion and bile acid pool size were measured in these same animals. The bile acid FTR (daily fecal bile acid excretion/pool size) was ∼0.13 pools/day in wild type mice (males, 0.13 ± 0.03 pools/day; females, 0.12 ± 0.02 pools/day). The bile acid FTR was remarkably elevated in the Slc10a2 null mice, increasing ∼150-fold in the males (19.22 ± 2.33 pools/day) and 75-fold in the females (9.26 ± 2.49 pools/day).Composition of the bile acid pool was significantly altered in the Slc10a2 – / – mice. The primary bile acids taurocholate and tauro-β-muricholate account for ∼90% of the pool in the male (taurocholate 43%, tauro-β-muricholate 49%) and female (taurocholate 53%, tauro-β-muricholate 34%) wild type mice. However, in the Slc10a2 null mice, the fraction of the pool normally occupied by tauro-β-muricholate is largely replaced by taurocholate, such that taurocholate became the major bile acid species accounting for 81% (males) and 70% (females) of the bile acid pool. The proportion of tauro-β-muricholate was significantly decreased to ∼10% of the pool in the Slc10a2 null mice. The remainder of the bile acid pool in the wild type and Slc10a2 null mice consisted primarily of taurodeoxycholate, tauro-α-muricholate, and tauro-ω-muricholate. No unconjugated bile acids were detected in the bile acid pool by electrospray mass spectrometry (data not shown).Intestinal Cholesterol and Total Lipid Absorption—Variations in bile acid pool size and composition affect lipid absorption from the small intestine. In general, large decreases in the pool size and/or content of hydrophobic bile acids can decrease lipid absorption (36Li-Hawkins J. Gafvels M. Olin M. Lund E.G. Andersson U. Schuster G. Björkhem I. Russell D.W. Eggertsen G. J. Clin. Invest. 2002; 110: 1191-1200Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar, 37Wang D.Q.-H. Tazuma S. J. Lipid Res. 2002; 43: 1960-1968Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The diminished bile acid pool in the Slc10a2 null mice raises the possibility that cholesterol and total lipid absorption are impaired. Analysis of the fecal lipid excretion revealed that male and female Slc10a2 – / – mice excrete ∼4-fold more total fat, fatty acids, and neutral sterols than wild type mice (Fig. 2C). However, the total amount of fat excreted is still small. The stool fat content as a percentage of fecal dry weight was ∼1.5 and ∼4.2% in wild type and Slc10a2 null mice, respectively. Intestinal lipid absorption was estimated by measuring the daily food consumption and lipid content of the diet. The percent of intestinal lipid absorption decreased from ∼98 to 93% in males and from ∼98 to 95% in female Slc10a2 null mice. These studies indicate that despite an 80% decrease in the bile acid pool, total intestinal lipid absorption was decreased less than 10%. Cholesterol absorption has been reported to be more sensitive than total lipid to changes in bile acid pool size or composition (23Schwarz M. Russell D.W. Dietschy J.M. Turley S.D. J. Lipid Res. 1998; 39: 1833-1843Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 36Li-Hawkins J. Gafvels M. Olin M. Lund E.G. Andersson U. Schuster G. Björkhem I. Russell D.W. Eggertsen G. J. Clin. Invest. 2002; 110: 1191-1200Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). To further investigate this question in the Slc10a2 null mice, intestinal cholesterol absorption was measured using the fecal dual isotope ratio method. As shown in Fig. 2D, intestinal cholesterol absorption was decreased 26% (males) and 15% (females) in the Slc10a2 – / – mice maintained on the low cholesterol-containing basal diet. These results suggest that despite the 80% decrease in bile acid pool size, there are sufficient lumenal bile acids for micellar solubilization of cholesterol. This was confirmed by direct measure of the bile acid to cholesterol ratio in the liquid phase of the proximal small intestine lumenal contents. The molar ratio of bile acids to cholesterol was 296 ± 28 (n = 4) in the wild type mice versus 107 ± 15 (n = 5) in the Slc10a2 null mice (p = 0.0004).Cyp7a1 Expression—In the mouse, the majority of bile acids are synthesized via the CYP7A1 pathway (23Schwarz M. Russell D.W. Dietschy J.M. Turley S.D. J. Lipid Res. 1998; 39: 1833-1843Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). CYP7A1 activity was significantly increased in both male (2.7-fold) and female (5.2-fold) Slc10a2 – / – mice (Fig. 3A). Similar increases were seen for CYP7A1 protein and mRNA levels (Fig. 3B). In addition to the pooled samples shown in Fig. 3B, aliquots of microsomes and mRNA from individual mouse livers were analyzed for CYP7A1 expression. CYP7A1 protein was increased 4.1-fold in male (p = 0.0013) and 6.9-fold in female (p < 0.0001) Slc10a2 null mice. Similarly, CYP7A1 mRNA was increased 3-fold (p = 0.0013) and 2.3-fold (p = 0.02) in the male and female Slc10a2 null mice, respectively.Fig. 3Bile acid synthesis and expression of CYP7A1. Mean values ± S.E. are shown (n = 4–5). A, CYP7A1 enzyme activity was measured using an HPLC-based assay and hepatic microsomes isolated from mice of the indicated sex and Slc10a2 genotype. CYP7A1 activity was significantly greater in the Slc10a2 – / – mice (*, p = 0.0136 for males and p < 0.0001 for females) than for the wild type mice. B, CYP7A1 protein and mRNA levels in liver of wild type and Slc10a2 – / – mice. Microsomes were pooled from four to five animals, and ∼100 μgof microsomal protein was subjected to immunoblotting as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The blots were probed using anti-BIP antibody as a control. CYP7A1 protein was elevated ∼5-fold in the Slc10a2 – / – mice. Pooled aliquots of total RNA were subjected to Northern blot hybridization using radiolabeled probes for CYP7A1 and cyclophilin. CYP7A1 mRNA was elevated ∼4-fold in the Slc10a2 null mice.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Intestinal Bile Acid Absorption—In addition to Slc10a2-mediated transport in the terminal ileum, bile acids may be absorbed by passive non-ionic diffusion in the small intestine, by facilitative transport in the small intestine, or by passive diffusion in the colon following bacterial metabolism. The first mechanism is unlikely to be an important contributor, because mouse bile acids are conjugated to taurine and would be ionized at physiological pH of the small intestine. The quantitative significance of the second mechanism, facilitative transport of conjugated bile acids, is unknown (38Amelsburg A. Schteingart C.D. Ton-Nu H.-T. Hofmann A.F.

Rho GTPase pathways control actin reorganization, while the fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP) regulates the synthesis of specific proteins. Mutations affecting either pathway produce neuronal connectivity defects in model organisms and mental retardation in humans. We show that CYFIP, the fly ortholog of vertebrate FMRP interactors CYFIP1 and CYFIP2, is specifically expressed in the nervous system. CYFIP mutations affect axons and synapses, much like mutations in dFMR1 (the Drosophila FMR1 ortholog) and in Rho GTPase dRac1. CYFIP interacts biochemically and genetically with dFMR1 and dRac1. Finally, CYFIP acts as a dRac1 effector that antagonizes FMR1 function, providing a bridge between signal-dependent cytoskeleton remodeling and translation."

This process is, therefore, not thought to play a significant role in impulse propagation across synapses. Here we show that calcium flux through presynaptic neuronal nicotinic receptors leads to mobilization of store calcium by calcium-induced calcium release. Recruitment of store calcium induces vesicular release of glutamate in a manner consistent with synchronization across multiple active zones in the CA3 region of the rat hippocampus. This modulation of action potential-independent release of glutamate is sufficient to drive the postsynaptic pyramidal cell above its firing threshold, thus providing a mechanism for impulse propagation."

We examined a role for RGS9-2, an RGS subtype highly enriched in striatum, in modulating dopamine D2 receptor function. Viral-mediated overexpression of RGS9-2 in rat nucleus accumbens (ventral striatum) reduced locomotor responses to cocaine (an indirect dopamine agonist) and to D2 but not to D1 receptor agonists. Conversely, RGS9 knockout mice showed heightened locomotor and rewarding responses to cocaine and related psychostimulants. In vitro expression of RGS9-2 in Xenopus oocytes accelerated the off-kinetics of D2 receptor-induced GIRK currents, consistent with the in vivo data. Finally, chronic cocaine exposure increased RGS9-2 levels in nucleus accumbens. Together, these data demonstrate a functional interaction between RGS9-2 and D2 receptor signaling and the behavioral actions of psychostimulants and suggest that psychostimulant induction of RGS9-2 represents a compensatory adaptation that diminishes drug responsiveness."
https://openalex.org/W2012785062,"Akt (also known as PKB), a serine/threonine kinase involved in diverse signal-transduction pathways, is highly expressed in the brain. Akt is known to have a strong antiapoptotic action and thereby to be critically involved in neuronal survival, but its potential role in the dynamic modulation of synaptic transmission is unknown. Here we report that Akt phosphorylates, both in vitro and in vivo, the type A gamma-aminobutyric acid receptor (GABA(A)R), the principal receptor mediating fast inhibitory synaptic transmission in the mammalian brain. Akt-mediated phosphorylation increases the number of GABA(A)Rs on the plasma membrane surface, thereby increasing the receptor-mediated synaptic transmission in neurons. These results identify the GABA(A)R as a novel substrate of Akt, thereby linking Akt to the regulation of synaptic strength. This work also provides evidence for the rapid regulation of neurotransmitter receptor numbers in the postsynaptic domain by direct receptor phosphorylation as an important means of producing synaptic plasticity."

Using an innovative approach to identify interneuron inputs onto motorneuron populations in a neonatal rodent spinal cord preparation, we have investigated the network responsible for left-right coordination of the hindlimbs. We demonstrate how commissural interneurons (CINs), whose axons traverse the midline to innervate contralateral neurons, are organized such that distinct flexor and extensor centers in the rostral lumbar spinal cord define activity in both flexor and extensor caudal motor pools. In addition, the nature of some connections are reconfigured on switching from rest to locomotion via a mechanism that might be associated with synaptic plasticity in the spinal cord. These results from identified pattern-generating interneurons demonstrate how interneuron populations create an effective network to underlie behavior in mammals."

The muscarinic receptor antagonist scopolamine impaired the preferential exploration of novel over familiar objects, disrupted the normal reduced activation of perirhinal neurones to familiar compared to novel pictures, and blocked production of long-term depression (LTD) but not long-term potentiation (LTP) of synaptic transmission in perirhinal slices. The consistency of these effects across the behavioral, systems, and cellular levels of analysis provides strong evidence for the involvement of cholinergic mechanisms in synaptic plastic processes within perirhinal cortex that are necessary for recognition memory."

https://openalex.org/W2028309801,"We have cloned a gene which encodes a fluorescent protein from the stony coral, Galaxeidae. This protein absorbs light maximally at 492 nm and emits green light at 505 nm, and as a result, we have designated it Azami-Green (AG). Despite sharing a similar spectral profile with enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) (Clontech), the most popular variant of the Aequorea victoria green fluorescent protein, the identity between these two proteins at the amino acid level is only 5.7%. However, since AG has a high extinction coefficient, fluorescence quantum yield, and acid stability, it produces brighter green fluorescence in cultured cells than EGFP. Similar to other fluorescent proteins isolated from coral animals, AG forms a tight tetrameric complex, resulting in poor labeling of subcellular structures such as the plasma membrane and mitochondria. We have converted tetrameric AG into a monomeric form by the introduction of three amino acid substitutions, which were recently reported to be effective for monomerizing the red fluorescent protein from Discosoma coral (DsRed, Clontech). The resultant monomeric AG allowed for efficient fluorescent labeling of all of the subcellular structures and proteins tested while retaining nearly all of the brightness of the original tetrameric form. Thus, monomeric AG is a useful monomeric green-emitting fluorescent protein comparable to EGFP."
https://openalex.org/W2029513101,"Cyclic AMP (cAMP) is produced by activation of Gs protein-coupled receptors and regulates many physiological processes through activation of protein kinase A (PKA). However, a large body of evidence indicates that cAMP also regulates specific cellular functions through PKA-independent pathways. Here, we show that a small GTPase of the Rho family, Rac, is regulated by cAMP in a PKA-independent manner. We also show that Rac activation results from activation of Rap1 through the cAMP guanine nucleotide-exchange factor (GEF) Epac1. Activation of the Gs-coupled serotonin 5-HT(4) receptor initiates this signalling cascade in various cell types. Furthermore, we demonstrate that crosstalk between the Ras and Rho GTPase families is involved in cAMP-dependent processing of amyloid precursor protein (APP), a key protein in Alzheimer's disease. Indeed, Epac1 regulates secretion of the non-amyloidogenic soluble form of APP (sAPPalpha) through Rap1 and Rac. Our data identify an unsuspected connection between two families of small GTPases and imply that Rac can function downstream of cAMP/Epac1/Rap1 in a novel signal transduction secretory pathway."

Rna15, a component of CFIA, has been found to interact with Sub1 and Mbp1, two factors that have roles in initiation of transcription by RNAPII (20Calvo O. Manley J.L. Mol.

Consistent with these observations, chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays have revealed that the recruitment of yeast 3′-end processing proteins in CFI and CPF is co-transcriptional (12Licatalosi D.D.

In this study we used a systematic proteomic approach to identify components of the yeast cleavage and polyadenylation machinery and factors that link 3′-end processing to the transcription machinery. We present a comprehensive description of the polypeptides associated with CPF and describe various protein-protein interactions between subunits of CPF. In addition, we describe functional assays suggesting new roles for various components of CPF. Yeast Strain Construction and TAP Purification—All the strains used in this study are isogenic derivatives of W303-1A (23Sikorski R.S. Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) with the exception of the strains used in Fig. 3, C and D, which are trp1Δ derivatives of BY4741(REF2 + and ref2Δ::Kan) (Research Genetics), constructed by integration and counter-selection of the pNKY1009 trp deleter vector (24Brachmann C.B. Davies A. Cost G.J. Caputo E. Li J. Hieter P. Boeke J.D. Yeast. 1998; 14: 115-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (2646) Google Scholar). TAP-tagged strains (including C-terminal truncations) were constructed as described (25Rigaut G. Shevchenko A. Rutz B. Wilm M. Mann M. Seraphin B. Nat. Biotechnol. 1999; 17: 1030-1032Crossref PubMed Scopus (2287) Google Scholar, 26Puig O. Caspary F. Rigaut G. Rutz B. Bouveret E. Bragado-Nilsson E. Wilm M. Seraphin B.

Purifications of TAP-tagged proteins were performed from 4l of cells grown in YPD to an A 600 of 1.5 essentially as described (25Rigaut G. Shevchenko A. Rutz B. Wilm M. Mann M. Seraphin B. Nat.

Recombinant DNA and in Vitro Protein-Protein Interaction Assays— The SSU72 gene from a YEp13-based plasmid that contains the SSU72 gene and suppresses the temperature-sensitive phenotype of a strain carrying SSU72-C-TAP was cloned into pRS316. GST or His6-tagged versions of recombinant proteins were obtained by cloning the full-length or truncated versions of genes into appropriate expression vectors (pGEX-2TK-Pti1, pET21b-Ssu72, -Mpe1, -Pta1, or pET28a-Sub1). Expression and purification of recombinant proteins, as well as in vitro binding experiments were carried out essentially as described (28Helmling S. Zhelkovsky A. Moore C.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 2026-2037Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 29Gross S. Moore C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 6080-6085Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Radiolabeled proteins were generated in vitro with the TnT rabbit reticulocyte lysate system (Promega) in the presence of [35S]methionine in a total volume of 50 μl according to the manufacturer's instructions. The eluted proteins were resolved on SDS-10% polyacrylamide gels, and detected by autoradiography or by Western blot with anti-His5 antibody (Qiagen). RNA Analysis—Total RNA was isolated by the hot phenol method (30Kohrer K. Domdey H. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 398-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar). For each primer extension reaction, 10 μg of total RNA and 200 fmol of 5′-32P-labeled primer were denatured in 10 μlof1× First Strand Buffer (FSB) (Invitrogen) (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, 75 mm KCl, 3 mm MgCl) for 2 min at 90 °C and annealed for1hina41 °C water bath. The reaction was started by adding 10 μl of 1× First Strand Buffer containing 20 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm dNTPs, 20 units of RNasin (Promega), 100 units of SuperScriptII-RNaseH (Invitrogen) and stopped after 1 h with an equal volume RNA loading dye containing 90% formamide. Samples were separated on a 6% acrylamide, 7 m urea polyacrylamide gel. The amount of reverse-transcribed U6 loaded was adjusted to match the signal given by snoRNA cDNAs. The primers specific for sequences downstream of the mature snoRNAs have been described (31Steinmetz E.J. Conrad N.K. Brow D.A. Corden J.L. Nature. 2001; 413: 327-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). The primer used for assessing readthrough of snR33 was 5′-GCAATGGTGCAGATTGTGTCAACTC-3′, whereas the primers used for reverse transcription at the CUP1 locus were CUP1INT (5′-TCATTTCCCAGAGCAGCATGACTTCTTGG-3′) and CUP1POST 3′-END (5′-GGATTCTATACAGAGTTGTAAGTTAGGC-3′). Gene expression profiling using a yeast ORF oligonucleotide set was performed essentially as described (32Hegde P. Qi R. Abernathy K. Gay C. Dharap S. Gaspard R. Hughes J.E. Snesrud E. Lee N. Quackenbush J. BioTechniques. 2000; 29: 548-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (794) Google Scholar). β-Galactosidase Assay—Three or four independent colonies transformed with various reporter vectors (pHZ18Δ2-no terminator; pL101-ADH2 terminator; pL501-GAL7 terminator) (33Hyman L.E. Seiler S.H. Whoriskey J. Moore C.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 2004-2012Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 34Hyman L.E. Moore C.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 5159-5167Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) were grown in synthetic medium lacking uracil containing 2% galactose to an A 600 ∼0.6 and assayed as described (35Kippert F. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1995; 128: 201-206PubMed Google Scholar). Chromatin Immunoprecipitation—Cells were grown in YPD to an A 600 of 0.6–0.8 and processed essentially as described previously (36Komarnitsky P. Cho E.J. Buratowski S. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2452-2460Crossref PubMed Scopus (802) Google Scholar). Chromatin solution was incubated overnight at 4 °C with 20 μl (50% slurry) of rabbit IgG-agarose beads (Sigma) pre-washed with TE buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA). The immunoprecipitate was washed stringently, and the recovered chromatin as well as the input chromatin was de-cross-linked and amplified by PCR as described (36Komarnitsky P. Cho E.J. Buratowski S. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2452-2460Crossref PubMed Scopus (802) Google Scholar). Various segments of a gene were amplified after ChIP as illustrated in Fig. 6. The 3′-ends of snoRNA genes amplified are as follows: +118 to +306 for snR13 and +84 to +278 for snR71. Numbering is with reference to the translational start for ORFs or the 5′-end of the RNA for snoRNA genes. The most downstream primers used for PCR amplification of snR13 and snR71 3′-ends annealed up to 96 nucleotides before the translational start of TRS31 and up to 121 nucleotides inside the coding region of the convergently transcribed LIN1 gene, respectively. Proteins Involved in Transcription Initiation and Termination Associate in Vivo with a Holo-CPF—Ref2 was identified in a genetic screen for factors involved in mRNA 3′-end formation (termination and/or 3′-end processing) (5Russnak R. Nehrke K.W. Platt T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1689-1697Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 37Russnak R. Pereira S. Platt T. Gene Expr. 1996; 6: 241-258PubMed Google Scholar). As the product of a non-essential gene, Ref2 is unlikely to be required for the cleavage reaction but seems to be needed for efficiently processing mRNAs that have suboptimal polyadenylation sites, indicating a possible role in the assembly of the cleavage machinery. To test its association with the mRNA cleavage machinery, Ref2 was derivatized at its C terminus with a tandem affinity purification (TAP) tag (25Rigaut G. Shevchenko A. Rutz B. Wilm M. Mann M. Seraphin B. Nat. Biotechnol. 1999; 17: 1030-1032Crossref PubMed Scopus (2287) Google Scholar), containing two IgG-binding modules of protein A and a calmodulin-binding peptide, by recombining tag-encoding DNA into the chromosomal REF2 gene. Hence, a normal expression level of the Ref2 protein was maintained, allowing isolation of physiologically relevant protein complexes. Ref2-containing protein complexes were then purified sequentially on IgG and calmodulin columns and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and silver staining as presented in Fig. 1A (left panel), which shows that Ref2-Tap is specifically associated with a large multiprotein complex. Moreover, the association is not likely mediated by RNA as RNase A treatment (10 μg/ml) had little effect on the pattern of associated proteins (Fig. 1A, lanes 3 and 4). Upon identification of the polypeptides co-purified with Ref2 by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry (MS) (38Karas M. Hillenkamp F. Anal. Chem. 1988; 60: 2299-2301Crossref PubMed Scopus (4850) Google Scholar) and peptide-mass fingerprinting (39Henzel W.J. Billeci T.M. Stults J.T. Wong S.C. Grimley C. Watanabe C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5011-5015Crossref PubMed Scopus (1180) Google Scholar), the Ref2-containing complex, holo-CPF, proved to be a larger version of the originally described CPF complex. The original CPF complex contained CFII subunits (Cft1, Cft2, Ysh1, and Pta1) and Pap1 and PF1 subunits (Fip1, Yth1, and four other unidentified polypeptides, simply designated p58, p53, p37, and p35) (4Preker P.J.

EMBO J. 2000; 19: 37-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). p53 was later identified as the polyadenylation factor subunit (Pfs) 2 (40Ohnacker M. Barabino S.M. Preker P.J. Keller W. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 37-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), required for both mRNA cleavage and polyadenylation. The Ref2-containing complex shown in Fig. 1 contained all the originally characterized components of CPF as well as seven new components also recently identified by several other groups (17Dichtl B.

Three of them were similar in size to the uncharacterized p58, p37, and p35 components of PFI and were identified as Ykl059c, Ykl018w, and Glc7, respectively. In addition, our holo-CPF complex included three other polypeptides not originally shown to be associated with the yeast cleavage and polyadenylation machinery, namely Ygr156w, Ssu72, and Yor179c. We have given the name Syc1 (Similar to Ysh1 C-terminal) to Yor179c. Ygr156w and Ykl018w are also known as Pti1 and Swd2. Very similar holo-CPF complexes have been described recently (17Dichtl B.

Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 1030-1042Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). There are only small discrepancies between their findings and ours. For example, we and Gavin et al. (41Gavin A.C. Bosche M. Krause R. Grandi P. Marzioch M. Bauer A. Schultz J. Rick J.M. Michon A.M. Cruciat C.M. Remor M. Hofert C. Schelder M. Brajenovic M. Ruffner H. Merino A. Klein K. Hudak M. Dickson D. Rudi T.

Superti-Furga G. Nature. 2002; 415: 141-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (4010) Google Scholar) identified Ref2 as a band that migrates just above Pap1 rather than below it (17Dichtl B. Blank D. Ohnacker M. Friedlein A. Roeder D. Langen H. Keller W. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 1139-1150Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). On the other hand, we and Dichtl et al. (17Dichtl B. Blank D. Ohnacker M. Friedlein A. Roeder D. Langen H. Keller W. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 1139-1150Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar) positioned Fip1 just below Pfs2 and above Pti1 rather than below (41Gavin A.C. Bosche M. Krause R. Grandi P. Marzioch M. Bauer A. Schultz J. Rick J.M. Michon A.M. Cruciat C.M. Remor M. Hofert C. Schelder M. Brajenovic M. Ruffner H. Merino A. Klein K. Hudak M. Dickson D. Rudi T. Gnau V. Bauch A.

Nature. 2002; 415: 141-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (4010) Google Scholar). In addition, Dichtl et al. (17Dichtl B. Blank D. Ohnacker M. Friedlein A. Roeder D. Langen H. Keller W. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 1139-1150Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar) did not identify Syc1 but instead identified a protein of unknown function of similar size encoded by the non-essential gene, YDL094c. Walsh et al. (42Walsh E.P. Lamont D.J. Beattie K.A. Stark M.J. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 2409-2420Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) described a CPF complex lacking Ssu72, Pti1, and Syc1. He et al. (43He X. Khan A.U. Cheng H. Pappas Jr., D.L. Hampsey M. Moore C.L. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 1030-1042Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar) very recently also described a complex identical in composition to ours. Ssu72 is a factor that affects start site selection during transcription initiation. Ssu72 (suppressor of sua7, gene 2) interacts both genetically and physically with the general transcription factor TFIIB, encoded by the SUA7 gene, and the second largest subunit of RNAPII (45Sun Z.W. Hampsey M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1557-1566Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 46Pappas Jr., D.L. Hampsey M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 8343-8351Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Its presence in the holo-CPF complex was confirmed by tagging and purifying the Ssu72 protein, as shown in Fig. 1A (lane 2). The ssu72-1 and sub1Δ alleles interact genetically in an allele-specific manner with the same set of sua7 alleles, suggesting that there could be a functional relationship between them (47Wu W.H. Pinto I. Chen B.S. Hampsey M. Genetics. 1999; 153: 643-652Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, Sub1 was proposed to interact with Rna15, a subunit of CFIA, and suppress termination by RNAPII (20Calvo O. Manley J.L. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 1013-1023Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Ygr156w (Pti1) is encoded by an essential gene (48Costanzo M.C. Hogan J.D. Cusick M.E. Davis B.P. Fancher A.M. Hodges P.E. Kondu P. Lengieza C. Lew-Smith J.E. Lingner C. Roberg-Perez K.J. Tillberg M. Brooks J.E. Garrels J.I. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 73-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar), contains an RNA recognition motif, has weak similarity with human CSTF2 outside its RNA recognition motif, and was shown very recently to have a role in 3′-end formation (49Skaar D.A. Greenleaf A.L. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 1429-1439Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The N- and C-terminal regions of Pti1 and Rna15 are also weakly similar. Glc7 (GlyCogen-deficient 7) is the only essential type I Ser/Thr protein phosphatase of S. cerevisiae and participates in many cellular biochemical pathways by interacting with a myriad of regulators (50Tu J. Song W. Carlson M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4199-4206Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Ykl059c, probably p58 in the original CPF, is an essential protein recently described as Mpe1 (mutant PCF11 extragenic suppressor) and required for both steps of pre-mRNA 3′-end processing (51Vo L.T. Minet M. Schmitter J.M. Lacroute F. Wyers F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 8346-8356Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Ykl018w (Swd2), also a component of the Set1 complex (52Miller T. Krogan N.J. Dover J. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Johnston M. Greenblatt J.F. Shilatifard A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 73-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar) and contains multiple WD repeats (seven, according to the Protein Structure Analysis server at bmerc-www.bu.edu/psa/request.htm), a motif found in proteins involved in a variety of cellular functions and often components of multiprotein complexes (54Smith T.F. Gaitatzes C. Saxena K. Neer E.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 181-185Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1022) Google Scholar). Yor179c (Syc1) is a non-essential protein (48Costanzo M.C. Hogan J.D. Cusick M.E. Davis B.P. Fancher A.M. Hodges P.E. Kondu P. Lengieza C. Lew-Smith J.E. Lingner C. Roberg-Perez K.J. Tillberg M.

Pti1, Swd2, Mpe1, and Syc1 Are Genuine Components of CPF—In order to confirm our findings, polypeptides identified in holo-CPF that were not originally known to be subunits of CPF were individually tagged and purified as described above. As the salt concentration during our purifications had a significant impact on the yield of some purified polypeptides 2E. Nedea and J. Greenblatt, unpublished data. (also see below), we carried out a series of purifications at 100 and 150 mm NaCl with tagged Pti1, Swd2, Mpe1, and Syc1 as well as Ssu72 and Ref2. A strain containing tagged Pta1, a known CFII subunit of CPF, was used as a reference. The results, shown in Fig. 1B, indicated that the new putative CPF-associated factors described here and elsewhere (17Dichtl B. Blank D. Ohnacker M. Friedlein A. Roeder D. Langen H. Keller W. Mol.

The ligand-binding pocket is hydrophobic but with polar or charged residues at the two ends of the cavity. T0901317 takes advantage of this by binding to His-435 close to H12 while GW3965 orients itself with its charged group in the opposite direction. Both ligands induce a fixed “agonist conformation” of helix H12 (also called the AF-2 domain), resulting in a transcriptionally active receptor. The structures of the liver X receptor LXRβ (NR1H2) have been determined in complexes with two synthetic ligands, T0901317 and GW3965, to 2.1 and 2.4 Å, respectively.

These transcription factors regulate target genes through a dynamic series of interactions with specific DNA response elements as well as transcriptional coregulators. The binding of ligand has profound effects on these interactions and has the potential to trigger both gene activation and, in some cases, gene silencing. There are 48 sequence-related nuclear receptors in humans and the family comprises receptors that recognize hormones, both steroidal and non-steroidal, but also receptors responding to metabolic intermediates and to xenobiotics. There are also a number of so-called orphan receptors where the natural ligand is unknown. Some of the receptors show a very specific and high affinity ligand binding, like the thyroid hormone receptors, whereas others have a substantially lower affinity for their ligands and are less discriminating in their ligand selectivity. Like many of the other non-steroid hormone receptors, LXR functions as a heterodimer with the retinoid X receptor (RXR) to regulate gene expression (1Willy P.J. Mangelsdorf D.J.

Together with peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) and farnesoid X receptor (FXR), LXRs represent a subclass of so-called permissive RXR heterodimers. In this subclass, the RXR heterodimers can be activated independently by either the RXR ligand, the partner's ligand, or synergistically by both (3Peet D.J. Janowski B.A. Mangelsdorf D.J. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1998; 8: 571-575Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar).LXRs consist of two closely related receptor isoforms encoded by separate genes, LXRα (NR1H3) and LXRβ (NR1H2). LXRα shows tissue-restricted expression with the highest mRNA levels in the liver and somewhat lower levels in the kidney, small intestine, spleen, and adrenal gland (4Apfel R. Benbrook D.

In view of the high degree of homology between the LXR isoforms (75% identity in the ligand-binding domain (LBD), 54% identity overall), it is perhaps not surprising that few subtype-specific biological responses have been described and that information on subtype selective ligands is limited. LXRs have been shown to regulate several genes involved in cholesterol and lipid homeostasis. Prominent examples are the phospholipid/cholesteryl ester transporters ABCA1 (10Costet P. Luo Y. Wang N.

Increasing insight into the involvement of LXRs in cholesterol and fatty acid homeostasis has led to considerable interest in LXRs from the pharmaceutical point of view. As an example, one hallmark of atherosclerosis is the buildup of cholesteryl esters in macrophages of the arterial wall, transforming the cells into foam cells that are constituents of the atherosclerotic plaque. The potential to increase cholesterol efflux from macrophages/foam cells by inducing genes such as ABCA1 and/or G1, thereby preventing or even reversing the atherosclerotic process, makes LXRs highly interesting drug targets. This notion is supported by recent reports pointing to the importance of LXRs as inhibitors of foam cell formation and thereby also of atherosclerosis (16Schuster G.U. Parini P. Wang L. Alberti S.

The structures have revealed that ligands can affect the conformation of the ligand-dependent activation function 2 residing in the C-terminal H12. An agonist allows H12 to cover the ligand-binding pocket, thereby providing one of the sides in the coactivator-binding pocket. Conversely, an antagonist induces an H12 conformation blocking the coactivator-binding site and/or leading to recruitment of corepressors (21Brzozowski A.M. Pike A.C. Dauter Z. Hubbard R.E. Bonn T.

Fermentation was carried out in batch culture (2× Luria Bertani medium, 22 °C), and expression of the recombinant protein was induced by the addition of 0.55 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactoside at A600 = 5.0. After the 4-h induction, the cells were harvested by centrifugation. The cell pellet was resuspended and washed once with buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 8.0, 100 mm KCl, 10% glycerol, and 2.5 mm monothioglycerol). Final cell pellet was frozen at -70 °C.40-g bacteria cells were lysed by glass beadbeater (BioSpec Products, Inc.) in extract buffer containing 50 mm TRIS, pH 8.8, 250 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Soluble protein extract was collected by centrifugation at 11,000 rpm, 20 min in Sorvall RC-5B centrifuge (DuPont instrument AB), GSA rotor. Crude LXRβ was eluted from 25 ml of Talon by 20 mm TRIS, pH 8.0, 100 mm imidazole. Further purification was performed by anion-exchange chromatography (5 ml of Hitrap Q FF, Amersham Biosciences), and LXRβ was eluted by applying a gradient from 0 to 250 mm NaCl, pH 8.0. After thrombin cleavage, the final LXRβ (6-7 mg) fraction was obtained by running 4% polyacrylamide native gel electrophoresis in TRIS-EPPS buffer system.Crystallization and Data Collection—Crystallization was carried out using the hanging drop vapor diffusion technique. Both LXRβ-T0901317 and LXRβ-GW9365 crystals were grown from buffer containing 8.5% isopropanol, 17% polyethylene glycol 4000, 85 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, and 15% glycerol at room temperature.The first LXRβ-T0901317 crystals formed in the P6122 space group, with a = b = 58.7, c = 293.8 and diffracted to better than 3 Å. In the same drops another crystal form was later detected belonging to the P212121 space group. Before data collection, the crystals were flash-frozen in the 100-K nitrogen gas stream of an Oxford cryostream700. Data were either collected with an MAR345 image plate detector using X-rays from a Rigaku H3R rotating anode generator + Osmic Confocal Max-Flux™ optics or with an ADSC Q4R CCD at Experimental Station ID14-4 at European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (ESRF). The observed reflections were reduced, merged, and scaled with MOSFLM (31Leslie A.G.W. Joint CCP4 and ESF-EAMBC Newsletter on Protein Crystallography. 1992; 26Google Scholar) and Scala (32Evans P.R.

Open table in a new tab Structure Determination and Refinement—The structure was determined by molecular replacement methods with the CCP4 version of AMoRe (34Navaza J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1994; 50: 157-163Crossref Scopus (5027) Google Scholar), using an LXRβ homology model based on a thyroid hormone receptor β structure. 2M. Farnegardh, unpublished result. The molecular replacement was done on the first 3 Å data of LXRβ-T0901317 crystallized in P6122 and revealed one monomer per asymmetric unit. The crystal packing along one of the two folds revealed that the protein formed a tight homodimer, which allowed us to use the homodimer to search the second crystal form P212121 that gave two homodimers in the asymmetric unit. Electron densities for the T0901317 ligand confirmed the solutions of the molecular replacement. Model building was done with O (35Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard Acta Crystallogr. Sect.

The four monomer complexes were treated as single TLS groups in Refmac, which gave more interpretable electron density maps and improved the R-factors substantially. Statistics of the data collection and refinement are summarized in Table I.The Final Model—The region between H1 and H3 (residues 243-259), part of the β-sheet between H6 and H7 (residues 329-332), and the loop connecting H11 and H2 (residues 445-447) have been abolished or modeled as alanines in some of the protein complexes because of weak electron densities. H12 (residues 439-460) is absent in molecule C of the GW3965-complexed protein. The geometry of the final model is good, and only one amino acid residue, Leu-330, has been found to be an outlier in the Ramachandran plot. In some of the structures where Leu-330 has an ordered conformation it has an energetically unfavorable conformation.Computation—Protein cavity volumes were calculated using the VOIDOO program from the Uppsala Software Factory package (47Kleywegt G.J.

LXRβ without peptide was the first to produce sufficiently good crystals for structural analysis. The structures of the LXRβ-T0901317 and LXRβ-GW3965 complexes were determined by molecular replacement and refined, including all diffraction data, to 2.1 and 2.4 Å, respectively. Four LXRβ complexes form the asymmetric unit with the chain names A, B, C, and D, respectively. Ligand occupies all four LBD molecules in the respective complexes with the exception of molecules C in the GW3965 co-crystallized protein, which appears to lack most of its ligand. 185 and 167 defined water molecules, respectively, were also included in the refinement.The nomenclature of the secondary structure elements is based on that of the thyroid hormone receptor (18Wagner R.L. Apriletti J.W. Mcgrath M.E. West B.L. Baxter J.D. Fletterick R.J. Nature. 1995; 378: 690-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (805) Google Scholar) and has been applied throughout this report even when comparing to other nuclear receptors where the original authors used a different nomenclature. The overall structure of the LXRβ LBD encompasses residues 220-460. Regions with weak electron densities were not built (for details see “Experimental Procedures”).Overall, the structure comprises a core layer of three helices (H5/6, H9 and H10) sandwiched between two additional layers of helices (H1-4 and H7, H8, and H11, respectively) and represents a typical nuclear receptor LBD fold (Figs. 1 and 2). This arrangement creates a wedge-shaped molecular scaffold that contains a wider upper part, which shows the highest degree of sequence conservation between different nuclear receptor LBDs. The lower, narrower, part is folded to form a hydrophobic cavity into which the ligand can bind. The remaining secondary elements, an antiparallel β-sheet comprising three strands and H12 (sometimes referred to as the AF-2 motif), reside on either side of the ligand-binding cavity. The crystal structures of the LXRβ complexes contain a homodimer of the protein with H10 and H11 of the two monomer LBDs forming the dimer interface related by a C2 symmetry axis (Fig. 1). The dimer interface is consistent with the ones found for other homodimer structures such as PPARγ (26Nolte R.T. Wisely G.B. Westin S. Cobb J.E. Lambert M.H. Kurokawa R. Rosenfeld M.G. Willson T.M. Glass C.K. Milburn M.V. Nature. 1998; 395: 137-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (1660) Google Scholar) and RXRα (19Bourguet W. Ruff M. Chambon P. Gronemeyer H. Moras D. Nature. 1995; 375: 377-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (1052) Google Scholar) and also with the heterodimer structure of RXRα/RARα (20Bourguet W. Vivat V. Wurtz J.M. Chambon P. Gronemeyer H. Moras D. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 289-298Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar), which also has the same C2 symmetry axis between the monomers. In the PPARγ/RXRα structure a dimer with the same secondary elements was observed, but the dimer interface is asymmetric where the PPAR monomer is rotated about 10° from the C2 symmetry axis of the RXR monomer (22Gampe Jr., R.T. Montana V.G. Lambert M.H. Miller A.B. Bledsoe R.K. Milburn M.V. Kliewer S.A. Willson T.M. Xu H.E. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 545-555Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (510) Google Scholar). It was postulated that this asymmetry together with an interaction of PPARγ H12 and H8 and H11 of RXR would be the explanation for the permissiveness of PPARγ and that this would apply to the permissive LXR and FXR receptors as well.T0901317 Is Cleaved by X-rays—The ligand-binding site revealed a clear density corresponding quite well to the T0901317 ligand. The ligand could easily be fitted with its hexafluoroisopropanol aniline group close to H12, and the results gave no doubts about the orientation of the ligand. The trifluoroethyl group could also be fitted in a nice density, but the sulfophenyl group did not appear to be connected to the rest of the molecule. There was a clear gap in the electron density between the nitrogen and sulfur atoms (Fig. 3A). A more detailed analysis on a rotating anode source revealed that it is the x-rays that split the ligand. 2M. Farnegardh, unpublished result. The consequence of the cleavage is that the sulfophenyl group moves away from the rest of the ligand and the distance between the nitrogen and sulfur atom increases by 1 Å from what would be anticipated in an intact ligand. A data set was collected to 2.8 Å on a rotating anode for only 12 h to get data with no detectable cleavage of the ligand (Fig. 3B). These data were used to build a model of the intact ligand in the binding site and are used under the remaining “Results” and “Discussion.” The shift in the position of the sulfophenyl group is the only detectable difference between structures obtained with cleaved and non-cleaved ligand.Structure of the T0901317-LXRβ Complex—The entire ligand-binding pocket extends from H12 to the β-sheet lying between helices H6 and H7. Its volume varies between the four protein complexes mainly depending on the position of the β-hairpin loop residue Phe-329 and Arg-319. These residues are fairly disordered and show different positional preferences in the four molecules. Depending on their positions, the volume of the boot-shaped cavity ranges from 560 to 680 Å3 (Fig. 4A). The ankle shaft is buried in a cavity (C1) formed by H12 and H11 on one side and H7 and H8 on the other side. Residues from H8, H7, and H6 form the heel of the boot, (cavity 2 (C2)), while the toes are covered by the β-sheet and H3, forming cavity 3 (C3). In its entirety, the pocket is about 12.5 Å in length along the boot shaft down to the heel (C1-C2) and 8 Å from the heel to the toes (C2-C3). The thickness of the boot shaft down to the toes is ∼6.5 Å.Ligand recognition is achieved through a combination of one specific hydrogen bond and the complementarity of the binding cavity to the non-polar character of the T0901317 ligand (Figs. 4A, 5A, and 6). The hexafluoroisopropanol-substituted aniline group occupies C1, and the acidic hydroxyl oxygen atom is in good position to donate a proton to the Nϵ imidazole nitrogen of His-435. The imidazole ring is firmly positioned by a group of three water molecules stretching out to the surface between H12 and the bend between H5 and H6. Water molecule W1 is tetrahedrally coordinated by the imidazole Nδ, Ser-436, the carbonyl oxygen of residue 432, and a water molecule, W2, at the surface. The bend releases the carbonyl oxygen of residue 305 and the nitrogen of residue 309 to coordinate another water molecule, W3, that is further tetrahedrally coordinated by Trp-457 Nϵ and water molecule W2. Otherwise, Phe-268, Thr-272, Leu-345, Gln-438, Val-439, Leu-442, Leu-449, Leu-453, and Trp-457 surround the hexafluoroisopropanol group. The ligand continues down via the aniline through these residues to the aniline nitrogen atom. The trifluoroethyl group of the nitrogen nicely enters into the C2 cavity and is completely embedded by Leu-31"

However, in the developing Xenopus retinotectal system, activity-induced synaptic modifications were quickly reversed either by subsequent spontaneous activity in the tectum or by exposure to random visual inputs. This reversal depended on the burst spiking and activation of the N -methyl-D-aspartate subtype of glutamate receptors. Stabilization of synaptic modifications can be achieved by an appropriately spaced pattern of induction stimuli. These findings underscore the vulnerable nature of activity-induced synaptic modifications in vivo and suggest a temporal constraint on the pattern of visual inputs for effective induction of stable synaptic modifications."
https://openalex.org/W2013753192,"Genetic similarity owing to kin relationship is often invoked to explain the evolution of social cooperation. In this study, male color morphs of side-blotched lizards settle nonrandomly with respect to genetic similarity. Blue morphs tend to settle in close proximity to other blue morphs with high genetic similarity. Blue neighbors have three times the average fitness of blue males lacking such neighbors. Conversely, genetically similar males depress fitness of the orange morph. Moreover, orange males are hyperdispersed with respect to genetic similarity. Pedigree and dispersal data show that genetically similar blue neighbors are not kin. Instead, conditions for the evolution of dispersal and cooperation are promoted by an emergent property of the morph locus that increases genetic similarity within morphs: genome-wide correlational selection links many traits to the morph locus, including settlement behavior."
https://openalex.org/W2035835440,"The plasma membrane Na(+)/Ca(2+) exchanger (NCX) plays a role in regulation of intracellular Ca(2+) concentration via the forward mode (Ca(2+) efflux) or the reverse mode (Ca(2+) influx). To define the physiological function of the exchanger in vivo, we generated mice deficient for NCX2, the major isoform in the brain. Mutant hippocampal neurons exhibited a significantly delayed clearance of elevated Ca(2+) following depolarization. The frequency threshold for LTP and LTD in the hippocampal CA1 region was shifted to a lowered frequency in the mutant mice, thereby favoring LTP. Behaviorally, the mutant mice exhibited enhanced performance in several hippocampus-dependent learning and memory tasks. These results demonstrate that NCX2 can be a temporal regulator of Ca(2+) homeostasis and as such is essential for the control of synaptic plasticity and cognition."
https://openalex.org/W2061223956,"Proteins binding A + U-rich elements (AREs) contribute to the rapid cytoplasmic turnover of mRNAs containing these sequences. However, this process is a regulated event and may be accelerated or inhibited by myriad signal transduction systems. For example, monocyte adherence at sites of inflammation or tissue injury is associated with inhibition of ARE-directed mRNA decay, which contributes to rapid increases in cytokine and inflammatory mediator production. Here, we show that acute exposure of THP-1 monocytic leukemia cells to the phorbol ester 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate mimics several features of monocyte adherence, including rapid induction and stabilization of ARE-containing mRNAs encoding interleukin-1β and tumor necrosis factor α. Additionally, TPA treatment alters the activity of cytoplasmic complexes that bind AREs, including complexes containing the ARE-specific, mRNA-destabilizing factor, AUF1. Analyses of AUF1 from control and TPA-treated cells indicated that post-translational modifications of the major cytoplasmic isoform, p40AUF1, are altered concomitant with changes in RNA binding activity and stabilization of ARE-containing mRNAs. In particular, p40AUF1 recovered from polysomes was phosphorylated on Ser83 and Ser87 in untreated cells but lost these modifications following TPA treatment. We propose that selected signal transduction pathways may regulate ARE-directed mRNA turnover by reversible phosphorylation of polysome-associated p40AUF1.

In eukaryotes, cytoplasmic mRNA stability is an important checkpoint in the control of gene expression. Many mRNAs encoding regulatory proteins like cytokines, inflammatory mediators, and oncoproteins are constitutively unstable. This ensures that the steady-state levels of these mRNAs, and hence their potential for translation, remain low but also that new steady-state levels are approached quickly following changes in the rate of mRNA synthesis (reviewed in Ref. 1Ross J. Microbiol. Rev. 1995; 59: 423-450Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In mammals, a common feature of many unstable mRNAs is the presence of an A + U-rich element (ARE) 1The abbreviations used are: ARE, A + U-rich element; ACN, acetonitrile; actD, actinomycin D; IL-1β, interleukin-1β; IMAC, immobilized metal ion affinity chromatography; MALDI, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization; TOF, time-of-flight; p38MAPK, p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase; RPA, ribonuclease protection assay; TNFα, tumor necrosis factor α; TPA, 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate; TTP, tristetraprolin; UTR, untranslated region. within the 3′-untranslated region (3′-UTR). These elements range from 40 to 150 nucleotides in length and exhibit significant variability in sequence composition, but they usually include one or more AUUUA motifs within a U-rich context (2Chen C.-Y.A. Shyu A.-B. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 465-470Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1688) Google Scholar). In general, mRNA turnover mediated by AREs consists of rapid 3′ → 5′ shortening of the poly(A) tail, followed by decay of the mRNA body (3Guhaniyogi J. Brewer G. Gene. 2001; 265: 11-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (555) Google Scholar, 4Wilusz C.J. Wormington M. Peltz S.W. Nature Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 237-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (634) Google Scholar). The regulation of mRNA decay kinetics by AREs involves their association with any of a number of cellular ARE-binding factors (reviewed in Ref. 5Wilson G.M. Brewer G. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 1999; 62: 257-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). One such factor, AUF1 (also referred to as heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein D), is expressed as a family of four protein isoforms resulting from alternative splicing of a common pre-mRNA (6Wagner B.J. DeMaria C.T. Sun Y. Wilson G.M. Brewer G. Genomics. 1998; 48: 195-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). The larger isoforms, designated by their apparent molecular weights as p42AUF1 and p45AUF1, are largely nuclear (7Zhang W. Wagner B.J. Ehrenman K. Schaefer A.W. DeMaria C.T. Crater D. DeHaven K. Long L. Brewer G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 7652-7665Crossref PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar), probably due to the presence of a binding determinant for components of the nuclear scaffold (8Arao Y. Kuriyama R. Kayama F. Kato S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2000; 380: 228-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). By contrast, p37AUF1 and p40AUF1 lack this sequence determinant and, as such, may be found in both nuclear and cytoplasmic compartments. AUF1 binding to an ARE is linked to acceleration of mRNA decay, based on extensive studies correlating mRNA turnover rates with AUF1 abundance (9Buzby J.S. Lee S. van Winkle P. DeMaria C.T. Brewer G.

Science. 1999; 284: 499-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). Besides AUF1, other RNA-binding factors have also been implicated in the regulation of mRNA decay rates through AREs. For example, association of tristetraprolin (TTP) with some ARE-containing transcripts enhances their decay (22Lai W.S. Carballo E. Strum J.R. Kennington E.A. Phillips R.S. Blackshear P.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4311-4323Crossref PubMed Scopus (638) Google Scholar, 23Ming X.-F. Stoecklin G. Lu M. Looser R. Moroni C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 5778-5789Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). By contrast, mammalian factors related to the Drosophila Elav (embryonic lethal abnormal vision) protein, including the ubiquitously expressed HuR and the neuron-specific Hel-N1, are thought to inhibit ARE-directed mRNA turnover (24Peng S.S.Y. Chen C.-Y.A. Xu N. Shyu A.-B. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3461-3470Crossref PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar, 25Fan X.C. Steitz J.A.

Thus, associated trans-acting proteins may modulate the decay kinetics of ARE-containing mRNAs positively or negatively. Additionally, a growing number of ARE-binding proteins have been described to which no specific functions have been ascribed (27Hamilton B.J. Nagy E. Malter J.S. Arrick B.A. Rigby W.F.C. J. Biol.

Brewer G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 44450-44456Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Modulation of ARE-directed mRNA turnover has been observed in response to a plethora of stimuli. For example, the rapid decay of interleukin-3 mRNA in mast cells is inhibited by Ca2+ influx (32Stoecklin G. Hahn S. Moroni C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28591-28597Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Similarly, mRNAs containing AREs are stabilized during heat shock (18Laroia G. Cuesta R. Brewer G. Schneider R.J. Science. 1999; 284: 499-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). Specific intracellular signaling pathways have also been identified, which contribute to the regulation of ARE-directed mRNA turnover. In particular, components of the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38MAPK) and c-Jun N-terminal kinase pathways are required for stabilization of ARE-containing mRNAs associated with the inflammatory response (33Winzen R. Kracht M. Ritter B. Wilhem A. Chen C.-Y.A. Shyu A.-B. Muller M. Gaestel M. Resch K. Holtmann H. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4969-4980Crossref PubMed Scopus (713) Google Scholar, 34Lasa M. Mahtani K.R. Finch A.

Both tyrosine kinase and p38MAPK activities are required for the stabilization of interleukin-1β (IL-1β) and GRO mRNAs induced by monocyte adherence (15Sirenko O.I. Lofquist A.K. DeMaria C.T. Morris J.S. Brewer G. Haskill J.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3898-3906Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). By contrast, ARE-dependent stabilization of cyclooxygenase-2 mRNA by Gαq-coupled receptor signaling in smooth muscle is mediated by the p42/p44 MAP kinases and is independent of p38MAPK activity (39Xu K. Robida A.M. Murphy T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23012-23019Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Currently, the molecular mechanisms linking activation or inhibition of these signaling pathways to modulation of mRNA decay rates are largely unknown. One possibility is that these systems function by altering the abundance or RNA-binding properties of ARE-binding factors responsible for initiating the decay process. To test this hypothesis, we have examined the stabilization of ARE-containing mRNAs encoding the cytokine IL-1β and the inflammatory mediator tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα), using a cultured cell model that mimics key features of monocyte adherence. In particular, we show that acute exposure of THP-1 monocytic leukemia cells to the phorbol ester 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) rapidly induced cell adhesion, accompanied by dramatic increases in levels of IL-1β and TNFα mRNAs. Accumulation of these transcripts included significant mRNA stabilization, similar to that observed following adhesion of primary monocytes (15Sirenko O.I. Lofquist A.K. DeMaria C.T. Morris J.S. Brewer G. Haskill J.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3898-3906Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Using this model system, we show that the distribution of cytoplasmic ARE binding activities containing AUF1 is altered following TPA treatment, coincident with changes in post-translational modifications of cytoplasmic p40AUF1. Finally, we have identified two sites of phosphorylation on p40AUF1 purified from THP-1 polysomes, which are dephosphorylated following TPA treatment, concomitant with inhibition of ARE-directed mRNA turnover. From these data, we propose that reversible phosphorylation of AUF1 may constitute a critical mechanism for regulating mRNA turnover rates through AREs. Materials—THP-1 monocytic leukemia cells were generously provided by Dr. Charles McCall. Oligoribonucleotide substrates encoding the TNFα ARE and a fragment of the rabbit β-globin coding region (Fig. 3A) were synthesized by Dharmacon (Lafayette, CO). Anti-HuR and anti-TTP antibodies were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA), and anti-Hsp70 antibodies were from Stressgen Biotechnology (San Diego, CA). Radiolabeled nucleotides were from ICN (Costa Mesa, CA), and TRIzol reagent was from Invitrogen. Plasmid pGEM7Zf(+) and PolyATtract mRNA Purification Systems were purchased from Promega (Madison, WI). Actinomycin D (actD) was obtained from Calbiochem, and ampholytes were from Bio-Rad. TPA, IGEPAL-CA630, trypsin-treated l-1-tosylamido-2-phenylethyl chloromethyl ketone, carboxypeptidase Y, 3,5-dimethoxy-4-hydroxycinnamic acid (sinapinic acid), α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid, angiotensin II, and trifluoroacetic acid were purchased from Sigma. ZipTipC4, ZipTipC18, and ZipTipMC pipette tip columns and the Montage In-Gel Digest96 Kit were obtained from Millipore, Corp. (Bedford, MA). Acetonitrile (ACN) and GaCl3 were purchased from Aldrich. Calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase was obtained from Roche Applied Science. Cell Culture—THP-1 cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and 1 mm l-glutamine in the absence of antibiotics. Defined fetal bovine serum was lot-selected for minimal endotoxin content by HyClone (Logan, UT) and then incubated at 56 °C for 30 min to inactivate residual endotoxins prior to use. mRNA Quantitation by RNase Protection Assay (RPA)—A plasmid template for synthesis of a riboprobe complimentary to a portion of the IL-1β 3′-UTR was generously provided by Dr. Mary Vermeulen. A cDNA fragment encoding a portion of the TNFα 3′-UTR was amplified by PCR from plasmid pE4 (ATCC, Manassas, VA), and a human β-actin 3′-UTR fragment was amplified by reverse transcription-PCR from THP-1 cell total RNA. The resulting cDNA fragments were then sub-cloned into pGEM7Zf(+) to generate plasmid templates for preparation of antisense riboprobes. 32P-Labeled riboprobes used for RPAs were generated by in vitro run-off transcription as described previously (40Wilson G.M. Sun Y. Sellers J. Lu H. Penkar N. Dillard G. Brewer G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4056-4064Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Riboprobes complementary to IL-1β and TNFα mRNAs were synthesized to specific activities of 1–2 × 104 cpm/fmol, whereas β-actin antisense riboprobes were synthesized to 200 cpm/fmol. Cellular RNA samples were purified first as the total RNA fraction, extracted using TRIzol reagent according to the manufacturer's instructions, and then enriched for mRNA using the PolyATtract mRNA purification system. Specific cellular mRNAs were quantified using RPAs (8 μg of poly(A)+ RNA/lane) with RNases P1 and T1 as described previously (41Brewer G. Ross J. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 181: 202-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Protected RNA fragments were fractionated by denaturing gel electrophoresis and were visualized and quantified using a PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences). mRNA Decay Assays—Decay rates of IL-1β and TNFα mRNAs were measured by an actD time course assay. Briefly, transcription was inhibited in control or TPA-treated THP-1 cells by the addition of actD (5 μg/ml) to the culture medium, and poly(A)+ RNA samples were harvested at selected time points thereafter. The relative abundances of IL-1β and TNFα mRNAs were determined at each point by RPA and were normalized using β-actin mRNA levels. First-order decay constants (k) were solved by nonlinear regression of the percentage of IL-1β or TNFα mRNA remaining versus time of actD treatment using PRISM version 2.0 (GraphPad, San Diego, CA). Errors about regression solutions (S.E.) were calculated by the software using n–2 degrees of freedom, with replicate experiments yielding similar results. Comparisons of mRNA decay constants for control versus TPA-treated cells were performed using the unpaired t test, with differences exhibiting p < 0.05 considered significant. Fractionation of THP-1 Cells and Gel Mobility Shift Assays—Nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions of control or TPA-treated (10 nm, 1 h) THP-1 cells were prepared by resuspension (control samples) or scraping (TPA-treated samples) of PBS-washed cells in lysis buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mm KCl, 2.5 mm EDTA, and 1% IGEPAL-CA630) containing mixtures of protease inhibitors (1 μg/ml each of leupeptin and pepstatin A, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and kinase/phosphatase inhibitors (50 mm sodium fluoride, 5 mm disodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate). Lysis was performed with 7–10 strokes of a loosely fitting Dounce homogenizer and verified by phase-contrast microscopy. Nuclei were pelleted by centrifugation at 1000 × g for 10 min and resuspended directly in SDS-PAGE loading buffer for Western analyses. Protein concentrations were determined for cytoplasmic extracts (42Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217529) Google Scholar). Cytoplasmic ARE-binding activities were identified in THP-1 cytoplasmic extracts using gel mobility shift assays as described previously (43Wilson G.M. Brewer G. Methods. 1999; 17: 74-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Oligoribonucleotide RNA substrates were 5′-end-labeled using [γ-32P]ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase to specific activities of 3–5 × 103 cpm/fmol as described (16Wilson G.M. Sun Y. Lu H. Brewer G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33374-33381Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Identical reactions were assembled for antibody supershift assays except that preimmune serum or antiserum was added to a maximum of 10% total reaction volume prior to incubation. Two-dimensional Western Analyses—Cytoplasmic extracts (50 μg of protein) from control or TPA-treated THP-1 cells (described above) were loaded onto 1.5 mm × 12-cm isoelectric focusing tube gels in 1 × SDS sample buffer (125 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 1% SDS, 5% glycerol, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 0.005% bromphenol blue) without heating. Gels contained 8 m urea, 3.5% acrylamide (30:1 acrylamide/bisacrylamide), 2% Triton X-100, 0.5% 3/10 ampholytes, 2.3% 5/7 ampholytes, and 2.3% 7/9 ampholytes, and were run between 0.1 n NaOH (cathode buffer) and 6 mm H3PO4 (anode buffer) at 400 V for 16 h and then 800 V for 2 h. Tube gels were extruded and equilibrated with 1 × SDS sample buffer prior to second dimension fractionation by SDS-PAGE, followed by electroblotting onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane and immunodetection of AUF1. Analyses of Polysome-associated p40AUF1 and Peptide Fragments by Mass Spectrometry—A ribosomal salt wash was prepared by first isolating polysomes from control or TPA-treated THP-1 cells by hypotonic lysis and centrifugation through 30% sucrose and then releasing polysome-associated proteins using 0.5 m potassium acetate as described previously (41Brewer G. Ross J. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 181: 202-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). From this material, AUF1 was purified by tandem heparin and poly(U) chromatography as described (43Wilson G.M. Brewer G. Methods. 1999; 17: 74-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Tryptic digests were performed in SDS-PAGE gel slices using the Montage In-Gel Digest96 kit according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, the SDS-PAGE band corresponding to p40AUF1 was excised, destained, and dehydrated and then digested with trypsin overnight at 30 °C. Liberated peptide fragments were lyophilized in a SpeedVac. Tryptic phosphopeptide fragments were enriched using an immobilized metal ion affinity chromatography (IMAC)-based strategy (44Posewitz M.C. Tempst P. Anal. Chem. 1999; 71: 2883-2892Crossref PubMed Scopus (787) Google Scholar). Briefly, ZipTipMC columns were charged with 60 mm GaCl3, washed with 10% ACN containing 1% acetic acid, and equilibrated with 10% ACN containing 0.1% acetic acid. Lyophilized peptide fragments were resuspended in 0.1% acetic acid and bound to the columns through 10 application cycles. Phosphopeptides were eluted with freshly prepared 0.3 m NH4OH. Where indicated, phosphopeptide fragments selected by Ga3+-IMAC were dephosphorylated using on-target dephosphorylation reactions (45Vihinen H. Saarinen J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27775-27783Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Here, phosphopeptides spotted on the MALDI target plate (described below) were dissolved in 0.5 μl of 50 mm NH4HCO3 (pH 8.9) containing calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase (0.01 units). Samples were then incubated for 2 h at 37 °C in a high humidity chamber. The dephosphorylation reaction was stopped by the addition of 0.5 μl of ACN. Specific sites of phosphorylation were determined by limited carboxypeptidase Y digest (46Qian X. Zhou W. Khaledi M.G. Tomer K.B. Anal. Biochem. 1999; 274: 174-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) of Ga3+-IMAC-selected phosphopeptide fragments. Briefly, phosphopeptides were dried and resuspended in 50 mm sodium citrate (pH 6.0). Carboxypeptidase Y was added (enzyme/peptide ratio of 2:1 by mass), and the mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 8 h. The reaction was stopped by the addition of trifluoroacetic acid to 0.5%. MALDI-TOF mass analyses of all samples were performed on a Voyager-DE PRO work station equipped with a PerkinElmer Biosystems DE-PRO mass spectrometer (PerSeptive Biosystems, Framingham, MA). Phosphopeptides isolated by Ga3+-IMAC and products from carboxypeptidase Y digests were purified and concentrated with Zip-TipC18 columns according to the manufacturer's instructions and then mixed (1:4, v/v) with a saturated α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid solution in ethanol/water/formic acid (45:45:10). Polysomal p40AUF1 purified from THP-1 cells was concentrated using ZipTipC4 columns and then mixed (1:4 v/v) with saturated sinapinic acid in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, 50% ACN. Samples from each mixture (2 μl) were spotted onto MALDI target plates and air-dried. The samples were analyzed by the mass spectrometer in the reflector positive or linear negative ion delayed extraction mode. Reflector positive mode was preferred for detection of phosphopeptide fragments due to its improved mass resolution (47Annan R.S. Carr S.A. Anal. Chem. 1996; 68: 3413-3421Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar), although this mode also contributed to increased background signals. Mass calibration was performed using angiotensin II as an external standard. The apparent molecular mass of unmodified p40AUF1 was calculated from the predicted amino acid sequence (GenBank™ accession number NM_002138) using the AAStats program of the Biology Workbench version 3.2 (San Diego Supercomputer Center; available on the World Wide Web at www.workbench.sdsc.edu). IL-1β and TNFα mRNAs Are Rapidly Induced and Stabilized in THP-1 Cells following Acute TPA Treatment—Circulating monocytes adhere at sites of infection or tissue injury. This event rapidly triggers the expression of a battery of cytokines and inflammatory mediators, involving both transcriptional and post-transcriptional mechanisms (15Sirenko O.I. Lofquist A.K. DeMaria C.T. Morris J.S. Brewer G. Haskill J.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3898-3906Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 48Lofquist A.K. Mondal K. Morris J.S. Haskill J.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1737-1746Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). By contrast, THP-1 monocytic leukemia cells grow constitutively in suspension but may become adherent following treatment with phorbol esters. Stimulation of THP-1 cells with phorbol esters like TPA is a popular model of monocytic differentiation to macrophage-like cells, based on the manifestation of adherence, loss of proliferation, phagocytosis, and enhanced production of proinflammatory cytokines in response to lipopolysaccharide (49Rovera G. O'Brien T.G. Diamond L. Science. 1979; 240: 868-870Crossref Scopus (453) Google Scholar, 50Schwende H. Fitzke E. Ambs P. Dieter P. J. Leukoc. Biol. 1996; 59: 555-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar, 51Lee J. Mehta K. Blick M.B. Gutterman J.U. Lopez-Berestein G. Blood. 1987; 69: 1542-1545Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 52Rutault K. Hazzalin C.A. Mahadevan L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 6666-6674Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Whereas phorbol ester treatment induces THP-1 cells to adopt many macrophage-like characteristics over a period of days, adherence per se may be observed within a mere 15-min exposure to TPA (10 nm, data not shown). To determine whether this acute TPA-induced adherence of THP-1 cells was accompanied by increased expression of cytokine and inflammatory mediator mRNAs, similar to that observed in adherent monocytes, the levels of IL-1β and TNFα mRNAs were measured across a time course of TPA treatment (Fig. 1). Increases in IL-1β mRNA levels were observed within 30–60 min and reached a maximum induction of nearly 50-fold within 8 h (Fig. 1, A and C). TNFα mRNA levels were also rapidly increased, attaining 30-fold induction within 4 h (Fig. 1, B and C). In both cases, these inductions were transient, with preinduction mRNA levels reached (TNFα) or approached (IL-1β) after 24 h of TPA treatment. During monocyte adherence, mRNA stabilization contributes to the induction of mRNAs encoding cytokines and other inflammatory mediators (15Sirenko O.I. Lofquist A.K. DeMaria C.T. Morris J.S. Brewer G. Haskill J.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3898-3906Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). To establish whether similar post-transcriptional mechanisms contributed to induction of these mRNAs in the acute TPA-treated THP-1 model, the decay kinetics of IL-1β and TNFα mRNAs were monitored prior to and following TPA-induced cell adherence by actD time course assay (Fig. 2). In all cases, mRNA decay kinetics were well approximated by first-order decay functions (Fig. 2C). Both IL-1β and TNFα mRNAs are relatively unstable in unstimulated THP-1 cells, decaying with half-lives of 29 and 8 min, respectively. However, after 1 h of TPA treatment, both mRNAs were stabilized 6–7-fold (Fig. 2C). In addition, stabilization of each mRNA was sustained as mRNA levels accumulated (Table I). Taken together, the similarities in mRNA accumulation kinetics, the transient nature of mRNA induction, and the rapid and prolonged stabilization of each mRNA following TPA treatment of THP-1 cells indicate that expression of IL-1β and TNFα mRNAs are coordinately regulated in this system, involving both transcriptional and post-transcriptional mechanisms. As such, these data suggested that acute TPA treatment of THP-1 cells mimics some features of the adhesion-dependent induction of cytokine and inflammatory mediator mRNA levels in primary monocytes.Table IDecay kinetics of IL-1β and TNFα mRNAs in THP-1 cellsmRNA10 nm"
https://openalex.org/W2040564306,"A nuclear variant of phospholipid-hydroperoxide glutathione peroxidase (PHGPx, GPx-4) was considered to be derived from alternative pre-mRNA splicing in testis and to regulate sperm maturation. The genomic sequence of rat gpx-4 was established and investigated in respect to expression into the cytosolic, mitochondrial, and nuclear forms of PHGPx. In silico analysis suggested the presence of two distinct promoter regions, the upstream one leading to transcripts translating into cPHGPx or mPHGPx and the downstream one yielding nPHGPx. The promoter activity of both regions was verified by luciferase-based reporter constructs in A7r5 and H9c2 cells. The data reveal that the formation of nPHGPx is due to alternative transcription and not to alternative splicing. Transcripts encoding nPHGPx were most abundant in testis although not restricted to this organ. This observation points to a general role of the nuclear PHGPx variant in regulating cell division.

The family of glutathione peroxidases (GPxs) 1The abbreviations used are: GPxs, glutathione peroxidases; cGPx, cellular glutathione peroxidase; PHGPx, phospholipid-hydroperoxide glutathione peroxidase; cPHGPx, cytosolic PHGPx; mPHGPx, mitochondrial PHGPx; nPHGPx, nuclear PHGPx; RACE, rapid amplification of cDNA ends; UTR, untranslated region. comprises different gene products with a conserved catalytic triad composed of (seleno)cysteine, tryptophan, and glutamine (1Maiorino M. Aumann K.D. Brigelius-Flohé R. Doria D. van den Heuvel J. McCarthy J. Roveri A. Ursini F. Flohé L. Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler. 1995; 376: 651-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). They reduce hydroperoxides to corresponding alcohols at the expense of thiols, typically of glutathione (GSH). The rate constant k +1 of the selenocysteine-containing congeners for the reaction with hydroperoxides, in the range of 105 to 107m–1, is fast enough to cope with oxidant production in cells. Therefore, Se-GPxs are commonly considered to play a key role in cellular antioxidant defense. The best studied members of the family are cellular glutathione peroxidase (cGPx) (GPx-1; EC 1.11.1.9), a tetrameric enzyme known since 1957 (2Mills G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1957; 229: 189-197Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and phospholipid-hydroperoxide glutathione peroxidase (PHGPx) (GPx-4; EC 1.11.1.12), a monomeric variant discovered in 1982 (3Ursini F. Maiorino M. Valente M. Ferri L. Gregolin C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1982; 710: 197-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar). cGPx is primarily responsible for the detoxification of H2O2, as is evident from knock-out experiments showing that the cGPx–/– mouse, although vital, is more sensitive to redox-cycling herbicides and other pro-oxidant challenges (4de Haan J.B. Bladier C. Griffiths P. Kelner M. O'Shea R.D. Cheung N.S. Bronson R.T. Silvestro M.J. Wild S. Zheng S.S. Beart P.M. Hertzog P.J. Kola I. J. Biol.

Furthermore, the observation that Se-deficient or -supplemented cGPx–/– mice exhibit a similar survival curve supports the concept of cGPx as unique in protecting against oxidative stress (7Cheng W.H. Ho Y.S. Valentine B.A. Ross Jr., D.A. Combs G.F. Lei X.G. J. Nutr. 1998; 128: 1070-1076Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). PHGPx has a broader substrate specificity, which also covers complex hydroperoxides such as phospholipid and cholesterol hydroperoxides (8Thomas J.P. Maiorino M. Ursini F. Girotti A.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 454-461Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It was therefore considered to synergistically act with vitamin E in protecting membranes from lipid peroxidation (9Maiorino M. Coassin M. Roveri A. Ursini F. Lipids. 1989; 24: 721-726Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). More recently, however, PHGPx has been implicated in regulating the synthesis of lipid mediators by silencing 5- and 15-lipoxygenase (10Weitzel F. Wendel A. J. Biol.

Science. 1999; 285: 1393-1396Crossref PubMed Scopus (729) Google Scholar). Several observations indeed point to a specific function of PHGPx in testis: (i) PHGPx activity in this tissue is higher than in any somatic tissue (17Roveri A. Casasco A. Maiorino M. Dalan P. Calligaro A. Ursini F. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 6142-6146Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); (ii) expression of the corresponding gene, gpx-4, correlates with the abundance of maturating germ cells (18Maiorino M. Wissing J.B. Brigelius-Flohé R. Calabrese F. Roveri A. Steinert P. Ursini F. Flohé L. FASEB J. 1998; 12: 1359-1370Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar); (iii) expression level is under indirect control of gonadotropins (18Maiorino M. Wissing J.B. Brigelius-Flohé R.

FASEB J. 1998; 12: 1359-1370Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar); (iv) in mature spermatozoa it is found as an oxidatively inactivated protein that represents a major component of the mitochondrial capsule (16Ursini F.

W., and Brielmeier, M. (2000) in 7th International Symposium on Selenium, Abstr. 34, Cooperativa Libraria Editrice Universitá di Padova (CLEUP), Padova, ItalyGoogle Scholar) (vi) rescued enzymatic activity in clinical sperm samples correlates with fertility-related parameters (21Foresta C. Flohé L. Garolla A. Roveri A. Ursini F. Maiorino M. Biol. Reprod. 2002; 67: 967-971Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar); and (vii) promoter mutations in gpx-4 were detected in infertile subjects (22Maiorino M. Bosello V. Ursini F. Foresta C. Garolla A. Scapin M. Sztajer H. Flohé L. Biol. Reprod. 2003; 68: 1134-1141Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). More recently a selenoprotein band of 34 kDa, detected in testis (23Behne D. Kyriakopoulos A. Kalcklosch M. Weiss-Nowak C. Pfeifer H. Gessner H. Hammel C. Biomed. Environ. Sci. 1997; 10: 340-345PubMed Google Scholar), has been identified as a PHGPx variant with an N-terminal extension that comprises a nuclear targeting signal (24Pfeifer H. Conrad M. Roethlein D. Kyriakopoulos A. Brielmeier M. Bornkmamm G.W. Behne D. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 1236-1238Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). This sperm nuclei, PHGPx (“sn GPx” in Ref. 24Pfeifer H. Conrad M. Roethlein D. Kyriakopoulos A. Brielmeier M. Bornkmamm G.W. Behne D. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 1236-1238Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), is proposed to be involved in chromatin condensation and thereby to determine the differentiation of spermatogenic cells into spermatozoa (24Pfeifer H. Conrad M. Roethlein D. Kyriakopoulos A. Brielmeier M. Bornkmamm G.W. Behne D. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 1236-1238Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). How the nuclear PHGPx (nPHGPx) is formed is still debated. The PHGPx gene is composed of eight exons that, depending on species, are spread over 3 to 4 kb of DNA. It is transcribed into mRNAs of different lengths (25Pushpa-Rekha T.R. Burdsall A.L. Oleksa L.M. Chisolm G.M. Driscoll D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26993-26999Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar, 26Moreno S.G. Laux G. Brielmeyer M. Bornkamm G.W. Conrad M. Biol. Chem.,. 2003; 384: 635-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 27Borchert A. Savaskan N.E. Kuhn H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 2571-2580Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), which lead to three different isoforms differing in their N-terminal extensions: a cytosolic one (cPHGPx), a mitochondrial one (mPHGPx), and nPHGPx. cPHGPx and mPHGPx are derived from the same exon (designated 1A; see Fig. 1) by use of different translation starts, whereas the N-terminal extension of nPHGPx results from translation of an alternative exon (designated 1B; see Fig. 1). This phenomenon was first explained as resulting from alternative pre-mRNA splicing by Pfeifer et al. (24Pfeifer H. Conrad M. Roethlein D. Kyriakopoulos A. Brielmeier M. Bornkmamm G.W. Behne D. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 1236-1238Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). The concept of splicing was also followed through by others (28Puglisi R. Tramer F. Panfili E. Micali F. Sandri G. Boitani C. Biol. Reprod. 2003; 68: 405-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). In the meantime, Moreno et al. (26Moreno S.G. Laux G. Brielmeyer M. Bornkamm G.W. Conrad M. Biol. Chem.,. 2003; 384: 635-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) provided strong evidence for the existence of a second promoter that is located in the first intron and creates multiple transcription starts, including the alternative exon 1B, which is spliced to exons 2–7 and translated into nPHGPx. Attempts failed, however, to prove the activity of this alternative promoter region in reporter gene-transfected somatic cells (26Moreno S.G. Laux G. Brielmeyer M. Bornkamm G.W. Conrad M. Biol. Chem.,. 2003; 384: 635-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 27Borchert A. Savaskan N.E. Kuhn H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 2571-2580Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). This was interpreted by Borchert et al. (27Borchert A. Savaskan N.E. Kuhn H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 2571-2580Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) to support the original idea of alternative splicing of a transcript derived from the “joint basic promoter” upstream of exon 1A, whereas Moreno et al. (26Moreno S.G. Laux G. Brielmeyer M. Bornkamm G.W. Conrad M. Biol. Chem.,. 2003; 384: 635-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), argue that the supposed alternative promoter is not recognized in somatic cells because it likely depends on transcription factors regulating nPHGPx expression specifically in germ cells. We describe here reporter gene experiments revealing the activity of the homologous alternative promoter of rat gpx-4 even in somatic cell lines. We further detected nPHGPx-encoding transcripts not only in testis but also in somatic cells and tissues, which opens up the perspective of a potential role for nPHGPx in the regulation of cell division beyond germ line differentiation. Cloning Rat gpx-4 —Rat gpx-4 was isolated with rat Genome Walker Kits (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) using the adaptor-ligated rat libraries provided and primers based on known rat cDNA. The entire gpx-4 sequence from –1497 to +2691 was finally elucidated by PCR using pfu polymerase, genomic DNA of Wistar rats (TRIzol reagent, Invitrogen) as template, and primers designed to generate overlapping amplicons (forward, 5′-ctcctccaggggtcagaaaaata-3′, reverse, 5′-ctcacgcagccgaccaatgga-3′; forward, 5′-ggccaataagagacgtcag-3′, reverse, ccaggcaaaccatgtgc; forward, 5′-tgcacgaattctcagcca-3′, reverse, 5′-acaaggcagccaaggtga-3′). PCR conditions were 95 °C for 2 min, 95 °C for 40 s, 61 °C for 40 s, 74 °C for 3 min (40 cycles); and 74 °C for 5 min. Products were separated by agarose gel electrophoresis, and appropriate bands were cut out and sequenced. Cell Culture—The rat thoracic aorta smooth muscle cell line A7r5 and the rat myoblast H9c2 cell line were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium as described (29Minotti G. Ronchi R. Salvatorelli E. Menna P. Cairo G. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 8422-84228PubMed Google Scholar, 30Roveri A. Coassin M. Maiorino M. Zamburlini A. Van Amsterdam F.Th.M. Ratti E. Ursini F. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1992; 297: 265-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar) but supplemented with 50 nm sodium selenite. Determination of the 5′-ends of gpx-4 Transcripts—The 5′-ends of PHGPx mRNAs were obtained by RACE cDNA amplification (SMART RACE cDNA amplification kit, Clontech) starting from total RNA of liver, heart, testis, and H9c2 cells. RNA was prepared using the RNeasy Mini-kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) and retrotranscribed into 5′-RACE-ready cDNA samples of 1 μg each. The first 5′-RACE PCRs were performed with reverse primers targeting exon 1A (5′-caggccaggcacagccagag-3′) or exon 1B (5′-caggaactcgtggctgttgctggtct-3′) to gain the cytosolic and mitochondrial or nuclear transcripts, respectively. For the second amplification, nested reverse primers for exon 1A or 1B (5′-tgctggcttcaataagcggctcagac-3′ or 5′-gttgaaaggctcgggaatgggct-3′, respectively) were used. The agarose gel-purified RACE products were TA-cloned and sequenced. Amplification of Rat Testis PHGPx mRNA—120 ng of retrotranscribed RNA was amplified (PCR master mix, Promega, Milano, Italy) in the presence of 8% dimethyl sulfoxide and 0.8 μm of the following primers for the mitochondrial transcript: reverse, 5′-gctgagaattcgtgcatgga-3′, and forward, 5′-tccattggtcggctgcgt-3′, or forward, 5′-agggcgggcaagccagac-3′, or forward, 5′-attcaggcttcccattgg-3′ or forward, 5′-ggcaacctcgcggataactg-3′); and for the nuclear transcript: reverse, 5′-atgcacacaagcccagga-3′, and forward, 5′-ctgaacaaggccaggcct-3′, or forward, 5′-tcggttagctagagtagg-3′, or forward, 5′-tgggttactgggacctag-3′. The annealing temperature was 59 °C. Any genomic contamination of the retrotranscribed sample was ruled out by PCR with gpx-4-specific primers annealing to exons 1A and 4: forward, 5′-cctcgcgcgtccattggtcgg-3′; reverse, 5′-ccttgggctggactttcat-3′). Real-time PCR Measurements—Total RNA was again extracted using the RNeasy Mini-kit. Genomic contamination was ruled out as described above. Only samples with an A 260/280 nm ratio of 1.8 were accepted. Standard plasmids were prepared by TA cloning of PCR products obtained from rat testis cDNA with the following primers: forward, 5′-cctcgcgcgtccattgg-3′, reverse, 5′-ccaggcaaaccatgtgc-3′ (for the cytosolic/mitochondrial transcript); or forward, 5′-tctgctgcaggaccttccc-3, reverse, 5′-gctgagaattcgtgcatgga-3′ (for the nuclear transcript). After propagation in Escherichia coli, plasmids containing the correct insert were purified (Plasmid Midi-kit, Qiagen) and quantified by A 260 measurements. Six hundred ng of RNA was retrotranscribed using the Taqman reverse transcription reagents kit (Applied Biosystems, Branchburg, NJ). Amplification was performed on an ABI PRISM 7007 sequence detection system (PE Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) and analyzed by Sybr green PCR core reagents (PE Applied Biosystems, Warrington, UK). The amplification mixture for nuclear transcript contained 3 mm MgCl2, 0.2 μm primers (forward, 5′-tctgctgcaggaccttccc-3′; reverse, 5′-gctgagaattcgtgcatgga-3′) and serial dilutions of the retrotranscription mixture (1.5–15 ng of starting RNA). Standard reagents were adapted to a final volume of 25 μl. Amplification conditions were: 95 °C, 10 min; 95 °C, 15 s, and 63 °C, 1 min for 40 cycles. The amplification conditions of the cytosolic/mitochondrial transcripts were identical except for the concentration of MgCl2 (2 mm), the primers (0.4 μm; forward, 5′-ttattgaagccagcactgctgt-3′; reverse, 5′-gaattcgtgcatggagcgc-3′), and the annealing/extension temperature (65 °C). Reporter Gene Experiments—Fragments of gpx-4 were generated by PCR with genomic DNA as template and gpx-4-specific primers and cloned into the KpnI/BglII site of the promoterless pGL3-Basic luciferase reporter vector (Promega). The primers were designed to yield the fragments –547 to –30, –547 to +422, –313 to +422, –179 to +422, +39 to +422, +86 to +422, and +86 to +649. The accuracy of the constructs was verified by sequencing. Cells were seeded onto 24-well plates, grown to 70% confluence, and transfected with 0.2 μg of the above constructs and appropriate control vectors (pGLBasic vector for negative control and pRL-TK vector expressing Renilla luciferase (Promega) for control of transfection efficiency) using ExGen 500 (MBI-Fermentas, St. Lech-Rot, Germany). Cells were cotransfected with 0.2 μg of one of the above experimental constructs or 0.2 μg of empty vector. After a 24-h expression period, cell lysates were assayed for luciferase activity by the Dual-luciferase Reporter Assay System (Promega) on a plate-reading luminometer (Fluoroskan Ascent FL, Labsystem, Helsinki, Finland). Firefly luciferase activity of the experimental constructs was normalized by the Renilla luciferase activity obtained with the control vector pRL-TK and expressed as amplification factor in respect to the basic luminescence observed with pGLBasic/pRL-TK-transfected cells. Gene Organization—The overall organization of the rat PHGPx gene, gpx-4, which has been cloned here for the first time, appears to be essentially identical to that previously reported for mouse (31Borchert A. Schnurr K. Thiele B.J. Kuhn H. FEBS Lett. 1999; 446: 223-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) and humans (32Kelner M.J. Montoya M.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 249: 53-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). It complies with the assumption that the coding region is constituted by 7 exons, the first one existing in two alternative forms that encode different proteins (Fig. 1). If exon 1A is translated starting from position +1, mPHGPx is formed, which, upon cleavage of the targeting sequence during intake into the mitochondrion, becomes indistinguishable from the cPHGPx (33Arai M. Imai H. Sumi D. Imanaka T. Takano T. Chiba N. Nakagawa Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 227: 433-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 34Roveri A. Maiorino M. Nisii C. Ursini F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1208: 211-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Alternatively, translation can start at a downstream ATG just before the exon 1A/intron 1 boundary to yield cPHGPx. If exon 1B is used with a translation start at + 417, a different N terminus results, which, after 84 amino acids residues, transits into the typical PHGPx sequence due to translation of exons 2–7 with an unchanged reading frame, as described by Pfeifer et al. (24Pfeifer H. Conrad M. Roethlein D. Kyriakopoulos A. Brielmeier M. Bornkmamm G.W. Behne D. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 1236-1238Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), thus yielding the nuclear variant. A difference from the previously reported sequences of the N-terminal extension was observed. The sequence 12QCAGIRPYGP21 (24Pfeifer H. Conrad M. Roethlein D. Kyriakopoulos A. Brielmeier M. Bornkmamm G.W. Behne D. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 1236-1238Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) is replaced here by 12CRQ14; this diversity was detected independently by others 2R. Brigelius-Flohé, personal communication. and thus is likely common. Otherwise, the total genomic sequence now established, –1497 to + 2714 (not shown; GenBank™ accession no. AJ537598), is remarkably congruent with published cDNAs (25Pushpa-Rekha T.R. Burdsall A.L. Oleksa L.M. Chisolm G.M. Driscoll D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26993-26999Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar) and partial genomic sequences (24Pfeifer H. Conrad M. Roethlein D. Kyriakopoulos A. Brielmeier M. Bornkmamm G.W. Behne D. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 1236-1238Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Just the insertion of a gctccgg motif upstream of the translation start of mPHGPx, if compared with the mRNA reported by Puspha-Rekka et al. (25Pushpa-Rekha T.R. Burdsall A.L. Oleksa L.M. Chisolm G.M. Driscoll D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26993-26999Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar), deserves to be mentioned. An in silico analysis of the entire rat gpx-4 sequence from –1497 to + 2714 by the Genomatix PromoterInspector program (available at www.genomatix.de) suggested two distinct promoter areas (Fig. 1). The most upstream one corresponds in sequence and location to the promoter first identified by Huang et al. (35Huang H.S. Chen C.J. Chang W.C. FEBS Lett. 1999; 455: 111-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) in human GPX-4 and confirmed to be active by Maiorino et al. (22Maiorino M. Bosello V. Ursini F. Foresta C. Garolla A. Scapin M. Sztajer H. Flohé L. Biol. Reprod. 2003; 68: 1134-1141Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) and Borchert et al. (27Borchert A. Savaskan N.E. Kuhn H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 2571-2580Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Being upstream of exon 1A, it may reasonably be presumed to regulate the products derived from this exon, i.e. cPHGPx and mPHGPx. The second promoter option is located in the first intron upstream of the alternative exon 1B. It is homologous to the mouse promoter postulated by Moreno et al. (26Moreno S.G. Laux G. Brielmeyer M. Bornkamm G.W. Conrad M. Biol. Chem.,. 2003; 384: 635-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) to regulate the expression of nPHGPx, which depends on the transcription of exon 1B. This hypothetical promoter comprises 308 nucleotides that, according to MatInspector (36Quandt K. Frech K. Karas H. Wingender E. Werner T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 4878-4884Crossref PubMed Scopus (2427) Google Scholar), contain 29 putative binding sites for transcription factors or regulatory proteins with a core similarity of 1 and an “optimized” matrix similarity. With identical criteria, a further 17 putative binding sites were identified in the region 340 nucleotides upstream of the putative promoter. In contrast to the corresponding region of the mouse gpx-4, no testis-specific regulatory elements were suggested in this area by the MatInspector program. Typical splice sites that might yield an mRNA translating into nPHGPx, as suggested by Pfeifer et al. (24Pfeifer H. Conrad M. Roethlein D. Kyriakopoulos A. Brielmeier M. Bornkmamm G.W. Behne D. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 1236-1238Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) and Borchert et al. (27Borchert A. Savaskan N.E. Kuhn H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 2571-2580Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), could not be detected irrespective of the assumed transcription start. Proof of Second Promoter Activity—Left with no reasonable source to explain nPHGPx formation by alternative splicing and encouraged by the in silico prediction of the two promoters in gpx-4, we decided to reinvestigate the promoter activities with conventional luciferase-based reporter gene constructs and to test them in homologous, i.e. rat, mesenchymal cell lines. Expectedly, the sequence –547 to –30 comprising the canonical upstream promoter only was active in both the embryonic rat heart myoblast line H9c2 and the smooth muscle cell line A7r5 (Fig. 2). If the whole stretch from –547 up to the translation start of exon 1B was lined to the reporter gene, activity declined to about 50% in both cell lines, suggesting that downstream elements bind inhibitory ligands. The removal of sequences upstream of the predicted promoter did not significantly affect the results. So far, the data is in line with the canonical promoter being localized in front of exon 1A. The constructs, starting at + 39 and + 86, however, which totally lack the canonical promoter, also showed significant activity in H9c2 cells, whereas in the A7r5 cells their activity was marginal. Furthermore, in both cell lines, increased activity was observed by including exon 1B almost completely into the construct lacking the canonical promoter (+86 to +649). These findings validate the prediction of the PromoterInspector program and, for the first time, unambiguously demonstrate that the hypothetical second promoter of gpx-4 is active in a cell type-dependent manner. Detection of Exon 1B-derived Transcripts—As expected, the RACE technology applied to mRNA isolated from whole testis detected transcripts corresponding to both exons 1A and 1B (Table I). The 1B transcript extended 14 bases into the 5′-UTR, which agrees perfectly with the major transcription start region at –12 to –14 upstream of the AUG translation site of nPHGPx, worked out by Moreno et al. (26Moreno S.G. Laux G. Brielmeyer M. Bornkamm G.W. Conrad M. Biol. Chem.,. 2003; 384: 635-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) for the mouse system. Surprisingly, however, an identical transcript could also be detected with mRNA isolated from heart and liver. This clearly indicates that the use of the alternate promoter is not restricted to germ line cells, and accordingly, nPHGPx is not a testis-specific protein.Table I5′-UTR of PHGPx transcripts as determined by RACE analysis of the mRNATissue/cellsUppermost 5′-end foundTestisGGCTGCGTGAGGGGAGGAGCCGCTGGCTCCGGCCGCCGAGATGAGCTGGGGCCGTCTGAGCCGCTTATTGAAGCCAGCACTGCTGTGCGGGGCTCTGGCTGTGCCTGGCCTGGCTGGCACCATGHeartGCCGAGATGAGCTGGGGCCGTCTGAGCCGCTTATTGAAGCCAGCACTGCTGTGCGGGGCTCTGGCTGTGCCTGGCCTGGCTGGCACCATGHeart, liverGGGGCCGTCTGAGCCGCTTATTGAAGCCAGCACTGCTGTGCGGGGCTCTGGCTGTGCCTGGCCTGGCTGGCACCATGH9c2gacctggtcacgcgccccgcctggcttggtgcgtcacagtcggcggctccttggctaccggctctttgtccccgcgctgtgcttgggacgcacagacgggcgggcatgH9c2gtcacagtcggcggctccttggctaccggctctttgtccccgcgctgtgcttgggacgcacagacgggcgggcatgH9c2acgcacagacgggcgggcatgTestis, heart, liveracagacgggcgggcatg Open table in a new tab In the H9c2 cells, which had been shown to use the alternate promoter efficiently, a similar and two additional RACE products were obtained, indicating additional transcription sites at –18, –73, and –108 relative to the nuclear translation start, which complies with the additional upstream transcription sites detected in the mouse system (26Moreno S.G. Laux G. Brielmeyer M. Bornkamm G.W. Conrad M. Biol. Chem.,. 2003; 384: 635-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Under our conditions, probing testis mRNA for the region upstream to exon 1A or 1B by reverse transcription PCR with suitable reverse primers and a series of forward primers nesting further 5′ to the uppermost transcription start sites identified for each exon product by RACE, a corresponding series of the correct-sized bands was observed (Fig. 3). This suggests that, in both cases, transcription may be initiated even further upstream than suggested by RACE experiments. In agreement with previous observations (25Pushpa-Rekha T.R. Burdsall A.L. Oleksa L.M. Chisolm G.M. Driscoll D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26993-26999Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar, 33Arai M. Imai H. Sumi D. Imanaka T. Takano T. Chiba N. Nakagawa Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 227: 433-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), some of the exon 1A-derived transcripts identified here (Table I) do not cover the translational start of the mitochondrial PHGPx. This observation leaves open the possibility that the expression of gpx-4 into mPHGPx or cPHGPx, respectively, is also determined by alternative transcription and not only by an alternative use of the translation start site. Quantitative Transcript Analysis by Real-time PCR—Transcripts encoding the exon 1A-derived products cPHGPx and mPHGPx and the 1B-derived nPHGPx were detectable by real-time PCR in somatic cell lines and all tissues investigated, i.e. testis as well as brain, heart, liver, and kidney. In each case nPHGPx transcript level were substantially lower than those encoding the cytosolic"

Whereas several signaling systems may modulate ARE-directed mRNA decay and/or post-translationally modify specific trans-acting factors, it is unclear how these mechanisms are linked. In THP-1 monocytic leukemia cells, phorbol ester-induced stabilization of some mRNAs containing AREs was accompanied by dephosphorylation of Ser83 and Ser87 of polysome-associated p40AUF1. Here, we report that phosphorylation of p40AUF1 influences its ARE-binding affinity as well as the RNA conformational dynamics and global structure of the p40AUF1-ARE ribonucleoprotein complex. Most notably, association of unphosphorylated p40AUF1 induces a condensed RNA conformation upon ARE substrates. By contrast, phosphorylation of p40AUF1 at Ser83 and Ser87 inhibits this RNA structural transition. These data indicate that selective AUF1 phosphorylation may regulate ARE-directed mRNA turnover by remodeling local RNA structures, thus potentially altering the presentation of RNA and/or protein determinants involved in subsequent trans-factor recruitment.

The steady-state level of any mRNA population is a collective function of its synthetic and degradation rates. Eukaryotic mRNAs decay across a broad kinetic spectrum, discriminated largely by the presence of specific cis-acting stability determinants within each transcript (reviewed in Refs. 1Ross J.

AREs constitute a diverse population of mRNA sequences that may interact with a wide variety of cellular protein factors. Binding of some factors, including AUF1 and tristetraprolin, is associated with acceleration of mRNA decay (4Lapucci A. Donnini M. Papucci L. Witort E. Tempestini A. Bevilacqua A. Niolin A. Brewer G.

EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3461-3470Crossref PubMed Scopus (650) Google Scholar, 9Fan X.C. Steitz J.A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3448-3460Crossref PubMed Scopus (740) Google Scholar). Furthermore, many additional ARE-binding factors exist for which specific roles in mRNA metabolism have not been defined (reviewed in Ref. 10Wilson G.M. Brewer G. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 1999; 62: 257-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). These myriad options for trans-factor occupancy on ARE targets present opportunities for multifactoral regulation of mRNA decay kinetics through these elements, including discrimination of mRNA targets based on ARE sequence composition, and differential trans-factor activation or inhibition by specific signal transduction pathways. The latter possibility is further supported by recent findings that some ARE-binding proteins may be post-translationally modified in response to diverse stimuli. For example, phosphorylation of tristetraprolin by components of the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway may alter its ARE binding activity (11Carballo E. Cao H. Lai W.S. Kennington E.A.

For HuR, phosphorylation events involving the AMP-dependent protein kinase are implicated in nuclear retention of the protein (14Wang W. Fan J. Yang X. Fürer-Galban S. Lopez de Silanes I.

Finally, AUF1 may be modified by both ubiquitination (16Laroia G. Schneider R.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 3052-3058Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) and phosphorylation (17Zhang W.

However, whereas some potential regulatory events have been linked to these modifications, it remains unclear how they modulate the functions of ARE-binding proteins at the biochemical level, which conceivably may include alterations in the ability of each protein to interact with RNA substrates or other cellular components. In the monocytic leukemia cell line, THP-1, interleukin-1β and tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα) mRNAs are stabilized following treatment with phorbol esters. Stabilization of these mRNAs was accompanied by changes in the activity of cytoplasmic ARE-binding complexes containing AUF1 and loss of phosphate from Ser83 and Ser87 of the predominant polysome-associated AUF1 isoform, p40AUF1 (39Wilson G.M. Lu J. Sutphen K. Sun Y. Huynh Y. Brewer G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 33029-33038Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Current evidence indicates that AUF1 selectively binds and oligomerizes on ARE substrates (18Wilson G.M. Sun Y. Lu H. Brewer G. J. Biol.

Brewer G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38400-38409Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). In addition, cytoplasmic AUF1 is present in a multisubunit complex (17Zhang W. Wagner B.J. Ehrenman K. Schaefer A.W. DeMaria C.T. Crater D. DeHaven K. Long L. Brewer G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 7652-7665Crossref PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar) containing other factors involved in the regulation of mRNA decay and translation, including the translation initiation factor eIF4G, poly(A)-binding protein, the heat shock proteins Hsp70 and Hsc70 (21Laroia G. Cuesta R. Brewer G. Schneider R.J. Science. 1999; 284: 499-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar), and lactate dehydrogenase (22Pioli P.A. Hamilton B.J. Connolly J.E. Brewer G. Rigby W.F.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 35738-35745Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Together, these findings suggest that AUF1 oligomers may function by recruiting additional trans-acting factors to ARE-containing mRNAs. It follows, therefore, that changes in AUF1 phosphorylation may influence mRNA decay kinetics by a number of mechanisms, including alterations in ARE-binding affinity, oligomerization potential, ribonucleoprotein (RNP) conformation, and interaction with other cytoplasmic proteins. Unlike the examples involving tristetraprolin and HuR (13Johnson B.A. Stehn J.R. Yaffe M.B. Blackwell T.K. J. Biol.

Biol. 2002; 22: 3425-3436Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar), phosphorylation of p40AUF1 does not appear to influence its nucleocytoplasmic distribution, since (i) both phosphorylated and nonphosphorylated p40AUF1 proteins were recovered from THP-1 cell polysomes, and (ii) no significant changes in the levels of nuclear or cytoplasmic AUF1 proteins were detected following phorbol ester treatment of these cells (39Wilson G.M. Lu J. Sutphen K. Sun Y. Huynh Y. Brewer G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 33029-33038Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). In this study, we have biochemically examined the influence of p40AUF1 phosphorylation at Ser83 and Ser87 on its interaction with the ARE from TNFα mRNA. First, we show that recombinant His6-p40AUF1 may be specifically, quantitatively, and independently phosphorylated in vitro at Ser83 by glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK3β) and at Ser87 by protein kinase A (PKA). Second, we employed gel mobility shift assays (GMSAs) and measurements of fluorescence anisotropy to show that phosphorylated His6-p40AUF1 retains specific ARE-binding activity but that the affinity of the p40AUF1/ARE interaction and the flexibility of the protein-bound RNA substrate varies among the different phosphorylated forms of the protein. Finally, using fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET), we demonstrate that the global conformation of the ARE substrate is compacted following binding of unphosphorylated, Ser83-phosphorylated, or Ser87-phosphorylated His6-p40AUF1. By contrast, His6-p40AUF1 phosphorylated at both Ser83 and Ser87 does not significantly condense the conformation of associated ARE substrates. Together, these data constitute the first biochemical evidence that post-translational modification of p40AUF1 regulates its ARE-targeting role and provide a potential mechanism for inhibition of ARE-directed mRNA turnover concomitant with loss of phosphate from polysome-associated p40AUF1. RNA Oligonucleotides—RNA oligonucleotide substrates (see Fig. 3A) encoding the ARE from TNFα mRNA (TNFα ARE) or a portion of the rabbit β-globin mRNA coding sequence (Rβ) were synthesized by Dharmacon Research (Lafayette, CO). Fl-TNFα ARE contains a 5′-fluorescein (Fl) tag, whereas TNFα ARE-Fl contains a 3′-linked Fl group. The RNA substrate Cy-TNFα ARE-Fl contains 5′-cyanine 3 (Cy3) and 3′-Fl moieties. All RNA substrates were quantified spectrophotometrically as described (20Wilson G.M. Sutphen K. Moutafis M. Sinha S. Brewer G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38400-38409Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Where indicated, the TNFα ARE and Rβ RNA substrates were 32P-labeled to specific activities of 3–5 × 103 cpm/fmol using [γ-32P]ATP (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and T4 polynucleotide kinase (Promega, Madison, WI). Preparation of Recombinant His6-p40AUF1 —Plasmid pBAD/HisB-p40AUF1 was constructed by inserting the complete coding sequence of human p40AUF1 cDNA into the polylinker of pBAD/HisB (Invitrogen) using standard subcloning techniques (23Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The identity of the insert and continuity of the open reading frame were verified by automated DNA sequencing. Recombinant p40AUF1 was prepared as an N-terminal His6-fusion protein by arabinose induction of E. coli TOP10 cells transformed with pBAD/HisB-p40AUF1. His -p40AUF1 was then purified by Ni2+-affinity chromatography and quantified by Coomassie Blue-stained SDS-PAGE against a titration of bovine serum albumin as described previously (19Wilson G.M. Sutphen K. Chuang K. Brewer G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 8695-8704Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 24Wilson G.M. Brewer G. Methods. 1999; 17: 74-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Where indicated, the N-terminal fragment of His6-p40AUF1 containing the His6 tag was excised using the Enterokinase Cleavage Capture Kit (Novagen, Madison, WI). In Vitro Phosphorylation of His6-p40AUF1— 32P label transfer assays consisted of His6-p40AUF1 (50 pmol) in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, and 200 μm ATP (50-μl final volume). [γ-32P]ATP was added to yield a final specific activity of 4000 cpm/pmol ATP. After 5 min at 30 °C, reactions were initiated by adding 2500 units of either the recombinant catalytic subunit of murine PKA (Calbiochem) or recombinant rabbit GSK3β (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA) and then returned to 30 °C. At selected time points, aliquots were removed and spotted onto P81 filters (Whatman, Clifton, NJ), which were then immediately washed three times for 2 min each in freshly made 75 mm H3PO4 and air-dried. Filter-bound 32P was quantified by liquid scintillation counting. Non-specific retention of 32P was determined by performing replicate assays in the absence of kinase. Substrate-linked 32P was then calculated as the difference in filter-retained 32P between reactions containing and lacking kinase. Additional reactions lacking the His6-p40AUF1 substrate indicated no significant retention of 32P via phosphorylation of the kinases themselves (data not shown). Phosphorylation reactions requiring both PKA and GSK3β were performed in tandem, with the PKA reaction allowed to proceed for 60 min prior to the addition of GSK3β and incubation for a further 60 min. For samples analyzed by mass spectrometry, [γ-32P]ATP was omitted from reactions, and products were desalted and concentrated using ZipTipC4 columns (Millipore, Bedford, MA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Large scale preparation of phosphorylated His6-p40AUF1 for biochemical analyses was performed similarly, but using 5 nmol of His6-p40AUF1in a total volume of 300 μl. PKA and/or GSK3β (50,000 units) were added as necessary, with samples incubated as above. Following phosphorylation reactions, samples were diluted 10-fold in Ni2+-affinity binding buffer (50 mm sodium phosphate (pH 8.0), 500 mm NaCl, 20 mm imidazole, 5% polyethylene glycol 6000). Mock- or kinase-modified His6-p40AUF1 was then purified by Ni2+-affinity chromatography and quantified by Coomassie Blue-stained SDS-PAGE as described (19Wilson G.M. Sutphen K. Chuang K. Brewer G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 8695-8704Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 24Wilson G.M. Brewer G. Methods. 1999; 17: 74-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), except that the loaded Ni2+ column was given an additional wash with 6 column volumes of Triton washing buffer (50 mm sodium phosphate (pH 8.0), 500 mm NaCl, 20 mm imidazole, 1% Triton X-100) prior to His6-p40AUF1 elution to ensure complete removal of the kinases. Following purification, a sample from each preparation was analyzed by MALDI-TOF to verify quantitative phosphate transfer. Mass Spectrometry—In-gel tryptic digestion, immobilized metal ion affinity chromatography, alkaline phosphatase reactions, carboxypeptidase Y digests, and detection of proteins and peptide fragments by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry were all performed exactly as described previously (39Wilson G.M. Lu J. Sutphen K. Sun Y. Huynh Y. Brewer G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 33029-33038Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). The apparent molecular weight of His6-p40AUF1 was calculated from the predicted amino acid sequence (GenBank™ accession number NM_002138 and pBAD/His vector system literature) (Invitrogen) using the AAStats program of the Biology Workbench version 3.2 (San Diego Supercomputer Center; available on the World Wide Web at www.workbench.sdsc.edu). RNA-Protein Binding Assays—GMSAs using unmodified or phosphorylated His6-p40AUF1 and 32P-labeled RNA oligonucleotide substrates were performed essentially as described (18Wilson G.M. Sun Y. Lu H. Brewer G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33374-33381Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 24Wilson G.M. Brewer G. Methods. 1999; 17: 74-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), except that magnesium ions were not included in binding buffers, and heparin (5 μg/μl) and yeast tRNA (0.2 μg/μl) were included to compete for nonspecific RNA binding activities. Also, flanking regions of RNA substrates were not excised by nucleases prior to gel fractionation. Fluorescence anisotropy was employed for all quantitative assessments of RNA-protein binding equilibria. Binding reactions containing the fluorescent RNA substrate Fl-TNFα ARE and varying concentrations of unmodified or phosphorylated His6-p40AUF1 were assembled in a final volume of 100 μl containing 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 50 mm KCl, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.1 μg/μl acetylated bovine serum albumin, and 1 μg/μl heparin. Following incubation at 25 °C for 1 min, anisotropy was measured using a Beacon 2000 variable temperature fluorescence polarization system (Panvera, Madison, WI) equipped with fluorescein excitation (490-nm) and emission (535-nm) filters. Preliminary on-rate experiments verified that anisotropic equilibrium was attained within 10–20 s at this temperature for all binding equilibria described herein (data not shown). For equilibrium binding experiments, the polarimeter was operated in static mode, with each sample read as blank prior to the addition of fluorescent RNA substrates to correct for intrinsic fluorescence from other reaction components. Each anisotropy data point represents the mean of 10 measurements. Replicate experiments using enterokinase-digested His6-p40AUF1 (see Fig. 1B) yielded results similar to the undigested protein (data not shown), indicating that the His6 and flanking N-terminal sequences do not significantly influence the ARE binding activity of His6-p40AUF1. The total measured anisotropy (At) of a mixture of fluorescent species exhibiting similar fluorescence quantum yields may be interpreted based on the intrinsic anisotropy and fractional concentration of each fluorescing species, given by Ai and fi , respectively, using Equation 1 (25Jameson D.M. Sawyer W.H. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 246: 283-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 26Weber G. Biochem. J. 1952; 51: 145-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar, 27Lakowicz J.R. Principles of Fluorescence Spectroscopy. 2nd Ed. Kluwer Academic/Plenum, New York1999: 291-319Crossref Google Scholar). At=∑iAifi(Eq. 1) For all equilibria described in this work, total fluorescence intensity did not vary significantly as a result of protein binding (data not shown), thus validating interpretation of anisotropy by Equation 1. A sequential dimer binding mechanism yielding a tetrameric protein-RNA complex is defined by two equilibrium constants, K 1 and K 2, and presents three potential fluorescent species, R, P2R, and P4R (see Fig. 4A). Under conditions of limiting RNA (i.e. [protein]free ≈ [protein]total), measured anisotropy is thus related to the concentration of protein dimer (P2) by Equation 2 (18Wilson G.M. Sun Y. Lu H. Brewer G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33374-33381Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). At=AR+AP2RK1[P2]+AP4RK1K2[P2]21+K1[P2]+K1K2[P2]2(Eq. 2) Anisotropy data sets were also analyzed using a binary binding model described by Equation 3, where a single protein dimer interacting with an RNA substrate yields a single equilibrium constant (K). At=AR+AP2RK[P2]1+K[P2](Eq. 3) Application of binding algorithms to At versus [P2] data sets was performed by nonlinear least squares regression using PRISM version 2.0 (GraphPad, San Diego, CA). The appropriateness of all mathematical models was monitored by the coefficient of determination (R 2) and analysis of residual plot nonrandomness to detect any bias for data subsets (PRISM version 2.0). Where indicated, pairwise comparisons of sum-of-squares deviations between mathematical models were performed using the F test, whereas pairwise comparisons of binding or anisotropy parameters between experiments used the unpaired t test (PRISM version 2.0). In both cases, differences exhibiting p < 0.05 were considered significant. Protein off-rate experiments to measure the dynamics of RNA-protein complexes were performed as described previously (18Wilson G.M. Sun Y. Lu H. Brewer G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33374-33381Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 28Wilson G.M. Sutphen K. Bolikal S. Chuang K. Brewer G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 44450-44456Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Measurement of RNA Folding by FRET—Interpretation of RNA conformation in the P2R and P4R complexes by FRET required comparison of the protein dependence of FRET efficiency (E FRET) to the fractional concentration of each fluorescent species. Since higher concentrations of RNA (2 nm) were required for FRET experiments, the approximation that [P2]free ≈ [P2]total, used to derive Equation 2, becomes invalid. Accordingly, the fractional concentrations of free RNA, P2R, and P4R were determined by solution of an equation system relying exclusively on K 1, K 2, [RNA]total, and [P2]total. Details of this system are described in detail elsewhere (20Wilson G.M. Sutphen K. Moutafis M. Sinha S. Brewer G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38400-38409Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Solution sets for selected values of [P2]total with constant [RNA]total were generated using Mathematica version 4.1 (Wolfram Research, Champaign, IL). Protein-dependent changes in the scalar distance between the 5′ and 3′ termini of the Cy-TNFα ARE-Fl RNA substrate were evaluated by measuring E FRET between the fluorescent moieties as a function of protein concentration. Binding reactions were assembled as described for fluorescence anisotropy analyses (above), except that RNA substrates were included at higher concentration (2 nm) and were labeled with either (i) the FRET donor-acceptor pair (Cy-TNFα ARE-Fl) or (ii) the FRET donor alone (TNFα ARE-Fl). E FRET was calculated from the decrease in fluorescence emission of the FRET donor (λex = 490 nm, λem = 518 nm, 5-nm bandwidth) in the presence of the acceptor using Equation 4 (29Clegg R.M. Methods Enzymol. 1992; 211: 353-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (645) Google Scholar, 30Wu P. Brand L. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 218: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (1122) Google Scholar). EFRET=1-(FDA/FD)(Eq. 4) F DA and F D represent the blank-corrected fluorescence of paired binding reactions containing the Cy-TNFα ARE-Fl and TNFα ARE-Fl RNA substrates, respectively. All fluorescence readings were taken using a Cary Eclipse fluorescence spectrophotomer (Varian Instruments, Walnut Creek, CA), using the Peltier multicell holder and temperature controller accessories. Where indicated, absolute scalar distances between fluorophores were calculated using Equation 5, where r represents the scalar interfluorophore distance and R 0 is the Förster distance, at which the fluorescent donor-acceptor pair yields 50% FRET efficiency. R 0 for the Cy3 and Fl linked to single-stranded DNA has been calculated as 55.7 Å (31Norman D.G. Grainger R.J. Uhrín D. Lilley D.M.J. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 6317-6324Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). EFRET=R06/(R06+r6)(Eq. 5) Recombinant p40AUF1 Is Quantitatively Phosphorylated at Ser87 by Protein Kinase A and at Ser83 by Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3β in Vitro—In unstimulated THP-1 cells, polysome-associated p40AUF1 is phosphorylated on Ser83 and Ser87 (39Wilson G.M. Lu J. Sutphen K. Sun Y. Huynh Y. Brewer G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 33029-33038Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). These modifications are lost following phorbol ester treatment of this cell line, concomitant with stabilization of some ARE-containing mRNAs and alterations in cytoplasmic ARE-binding activities containing AUF1. Three observations suggest that the effects of AUF1 phosphorylation on cytoplasmic mRNA turnover are likely to be manifested through p40AUF1. First, Ser83 and Ser87 are encoded by exon 2 of the AUF1 gene (32Wagner B.J. DeMaria C.T. Sun Y. Wilson G.M. Brewer G. Genomics. 1998; 48: 195-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar) and, due to alternative pre-mRNA splicing, are specific for the p45 and p40 isoforms of AUF1. Second, p45AUF1 is almost exclusively nuclear in THP-1 cells, whereas p40AUF1 is detected predominantly in the cytoplasm (39Wilson G.M. Lu J. Sutphen K. Sun Y. Huynh Y. Brewer G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 33029-33038Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Finally, p40AUF1 is the major polysome-associated AUF1 isoform in this cell line. Accordingly, the next objective was to determine how phosphorylation of p40AUF1 at Ser83 and Ser87 might alter its biological function. Given that these residues are located immediately upstream of the p40AUF1 RNA-binding domain (Fig. 1A), alterations in ARE-binding activity were postulated to be a possible consequence of these phosphorylation events. In order to test this hypothesis, it was first necessary to generate purified, selectively phosphorylated forms of p40AUF1. Using the PhosphoBase version 2.0 data base (33Kreegipuu A. Blom N. Brunak S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 237-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar), PKA was predicted to specifically phosphorylate p40AUF1 at Ser87 (Fig. 1A). Furthermore, Ser83 presented a consensus phosphorylation site for GSK3, provided that Ser87 was previously phosphorylated. Recombinant, N-terminal His6-tagged p40AUF1 was expressed in Escherichia coli TOP10 cells and purified by Ni2+-affinity chromatography to >95% purity as described under “Experimental Procedures” (Fig. 1B). In label transfer assays with [γ-32P]ATP, both GSK3β and PKA readily and independently phosphorylated the recombinant His6-p40AUF1 substrate, approaching a stoichiometry of 1 mol of phosphate/mol of protein in each case (Fig. 1C). For both phosphorylation reactions, SDS-PAGE analysis indicated a single principal 32P-labeled product (Fig. 1D). To further confirm His6-p40AUF1 as the phosphorylated substrate, kinase reactions were repeated using unlabeled ATP and then analyzed by MALDI-TOF. A mock phosphorylation reaction (i.e. containing no enzyme) yielded a major product with an M r of 37,803 (Fig. 1E), close to 37,793, the calculated M r of unmodified His6-p40AUF1. By contrast, products identified in PKA- or GSK3β-programmed reactions gave M r values indicating increases of 80 and 79 Da, respectively, consistent with the addition of a single phosphate to His6-p40AUF1 by each kinase. Since unphosphorylated His6-p40AUF1 was not detected in either experiment, phosphorylation by each kinase was deemed to be quantitative. Finally, a reaction programmed sequentially with PKA and then GSK3β yielded a principal product with M r of 37,963. The 160-Da difference relative to the unmodified protein indicates the addition of two phosphates to His -p40AUF1 in these reactions. Having demonstrated that His6-p40AUF1 may be quantitatively phosphorylated by PKA and GSK3β, it was subsequently necessary to confirm the sites of modification on the substrate protein. To this end, PKA-, GSK3β-, and PKA + GSK3β-phosphorylated His -p40AUF1 were digested with trypsin. Released phosphopeptide fragments were then purified by immobilized metal ion affinity chromatograp"
https://openalex.org/W1993066851,"Endothelial cell-selective adhesion molecule (ESAM) is a member of the immunoglobulin receptor family that mediates homophilic interactions between endothelial cells. To address potential in vivo angiogenic functions of this molecule, mice lacking ESAM (ESAM-/-) were generated by gene-targeted deletion. ESAM-/- mice did not show overt morphological defects in the vasculature. To evaluate the role of ESAM in pathological angiogenesis, wild type (WT) and ESAM-/- mice were injected with melanoma and Lewis lung carcinoma cells. By 14 days after injection, tumor volumes of B16F10 and LL/2 in ESAM-/- mice were 48 and 37% smaller, respectively, compared with WT mice. Vascular density of the tumors, as determined by CD31 staining, was also decreased in the ESAM null animals. Matrigel plug assays showed less neovascularization in ESAM-/- mice than in WT mice. ESAM-/- endothelial cells exhibited less in vitro tube formation and decreased migration in response to basic fibroblast growth factor when compared with WT cells, and endothelial-like yolk sac cells engineered to overexpress ESAM showed accelerated tube formation in vitro. These in vitro and in vivo studies suggest that ESAM has a redundant functional role in physiological angiogenesis but serves a unique and essential role in pathological angiogenic processes such as tumor growth."
https://openalex.org/W2094961621,"Replication protein A (RPA) is a heterotrimeric (subunits of 70, 32, and 14 kDa) single-stranded DNA-binding protein that is required for DNA replication, recombination, and repair. The 40-residue N-terminal domain of the 32-kDa subunit of RPA (RPA32) becomes phosphorylated during S-phase and after DNA damage. Recently it has been shown that phosphorylation or the addition of negative charges to this N-terminal phosphorylation domain modulates RPA-protein interactions and increases cell sensitivity to DNA damage. We found that addition of multiple negative charges to the N-terminal phosphorylation domain also caused a significant decrease in the ability of a mutant form of RPA to destabilize double-stranded (ds) DNA. Kinetic studies suggested that the addition of negative charges to the N-terminal phosphorylation domain caused defects in both complex formation (nucleation) and subsequent destabilization of dsDNA by RPA. We conclude that the N-terminal phosphorylation domain modulates RPA interactions with dsDNA. Similar changes in DNA interactions were observed with a mutant form of RPA in which the N-terminal domain of the 70-kDa subunit was deleted. This suggested a functional link between the N-terminal domains of the 70- and 32-kDa subunits of RPA. NMR experiments provided evidence for a direct interaction between the N-terminal domain of the 70-kDa subunit and the negatively charged N-terminal phosphorylation domain of RPA32.

The primary ssDNA binding activity is localized to the central region of the 70-kDa subunit (RPA70) (10Walther A.P. Gomes X.V. Lee C.G. Wold M.S. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 3963-3973Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). This region is composed of two structural domains called DNA binding domains (DBDs) A and B (Fig. 1A) (11Philipova D.

Nature. 1997; 385: 176-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar). Both domains form an oligosaccharide/oligonucleotide binding fold (OB-fold) that contains five β-strands arranged into a Greek-key β-barrel capped by an α-helix between the third and fourth strands (13Murzin A.G. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 861-867Crossref PubMed Scopus (762) Google Scholar). The N- and C-terminal domains of RPA70 are also composed of OB-folds. Structural studies by NMR have shown that the N-terminal 168 residues of RPA70 form two distinct domains (14Jacobs D.M. Lipton A.S. Isern N.G. Daughdrill G.W. Lowry D.F. Gomes X. Wold M.S. J. Biomol. NMR. 1999; 14: 321-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The first 108 residues form an OB-fold, defined as DBD F based on structural homology and DNA binding ability (15Daughdrill G.W.

The remaining 60 residues are a flexible linker to DNA binding domains A and B in RPA70. In addition to binding DNA, DBD F has also been shown to interact with various proteins involved in DNA metabolism (1Wold M.S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 61-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (1165) Google Scholar). The C-terminal region of RPA70, DBD C, exhibits weak DNA binding and is necessary for heterotrimeric complex formation (16Lao Y.

The 14-kDa subunit (RPA14) is also composed of an OB-fold that has been defined as DBD E although there is currently no evidence that this domain interacts with DNA. RPA14 is necessary for RPA complex formation (1Wold M.S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 61-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (1165) Google Scholar, 2Iftode C. Daniely Y. Borowiec J.A. CRC Crit. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 34: 141-180Crossref Scopus (392) Google Scholar).In addition to binding ssDNA and proteins involved in DNA metabolism RPA can destabilize double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) (20Georgaki A. Strack B. Podust V. Hübscher U. FEBS Lett. 1992; 308: 240-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 21Treuner K. Ramsperger U. Knippers R. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 259: 104-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Although RPA binds dsDNA with low affinity, it is able to promote helix destabilization by stabilizing single-strand regions in dsDNA (20Georgaki A. Strack B. Podust V. Hübscher U. FEBS Lett. 1992; 308: 240-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 22Lao Y. Lee C.G. Wold M.S. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 3974-3984Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). RPA destabilization of duplex DNA is functionally distinct from that of helicases, because ATP and Mg2+ are not required (20Georgaki A. Strack B. Podust V. Hübscher U. FEBS Lett. 1992; 308: 240-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Linearized SV40 dsDNA is preferentially denatured by RPA at internal regions rich in A-T pairs and at both ends (21Treuner K. Ramsperger U. Knippers R. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 259: 104-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Although other ssDNA-binding proteins are capable of destabilizing dsDNA, RPA is more efficient than the ssDNA-binding proteins tested: Escherichia coli SSB, herpes simplex virus ICP8 protein, bacteriophage T4 gp32, and bacteriophage T7 gp2.5 (20Georgaki A.

Association and helix destabilization reactions of RPA with duplex DNA and duplex DNA containing a central eight-nt ss bubble indicated that the denaturation of dsDNA occurs in at least two steps (16Lao Y. Gomes X.V. Ren Y.J. Taylor J.S. Wold M.S. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 850-859Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 23Iftode C. Borowiec J.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 5636-5643Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The two steps are (i) the formation of stable RPA/ssDNA with a small region of ssDNA (nucleation), followed by (ii) efficient strand separation. The destabilizing activity of RPA may play a role in the initiation of replication, as well as the denaturation of damaged DNA, in nucleotide excision repair (16Lao Y. Gomes X.V. Ren Y.J. Taylor J.S. Wold M.S. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 850-859Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar).Helix destabilization by RPA requires the core ssDNA binding region (DBDs A and B) and is stimulated by the presence of DBD F (22Lao Y. Lee C.G. Wold M.S. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 3974-3984Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). DBD F contains a basic cleft in the β-sheet-rich OB-fold (Fig. 2) and interacts with the acidic domains of the transcriptional activators Gal-4, VP16, and p53 (24He Z. Brinton B.T. Greenblatt J.

Proteolytic and NMR analyses indicated that this domain, termed the N-terminal phosphorylation domain, exists in an extended, flexible conformation (19Mer G. Bochkarev A. Gupta R. Bochkareva E.

Independent studies have reported that RPA phosphorylation causes stimulation of RPA helix destabilization activity (38Georgaki A. Hübscher U. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 3659-3665Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), dramatic decreases in DNA binding (39Fried L.M. Koumenis C. Peterson S.R. Green S.L. Van Zijl P. Allalunis-Turner J.

Wold, unpublished data. it seems likely that phosphorylation affects DNA interactions. To test this hypothesis, we examined the interactions between ssDNA or dsDNA and mutant forms of RPA with modifications in the N-terminal phosphorylation domain of RPA32. We found that whereas all forms of RPA examined had equal affinity for short oligonucleotides, a mutant form containing serine/threonine to aspartic acid mutations in the N-terminal phosphorylation domain of RPA32 had a significant defect in helix destabilization activity. A similar defect was observed with a mutant form of RPA that had the N-terminal domain of RPA70 (DBD F) deleted, suggesting a functional linkage between the N-terminal domains of RPA70 and RPA32. Helix destabilization assays with different substrates and time course experiments demonstrated that the observed decreases in helix destabilization activity were caused by deficiencies in both the nucleation and strand separation steps. Finally, we present evidence of a direct interaction between a negatively charged N-terminal phosphorylation domain of RPA32 and the basic cleft of DBD F of RPA70 using heteronuclear single quantum correlation NMR (HSQC). These findings suggest that there is a conformational change in RPA upon phosphorylation involving an intersubunit interaction between DBD F in RPA70 and the N-terminal phosphorylation domain of RPA32. This conformational change appears to regulate RPA function through modulation of RPA interactions with both proteins and DNA.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—[γ-32P]ATP (6000 μCi/mmol) was purchased from Amersham Biosciences. The 35-residue peptides, RPA32-WT and RPA32-Asp, corresponding to the wild-type or aspartic acid-substituted N-terminal phosphorylation domain of RPA32, respectively (Fig. 1), were from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute Biopolymer/Keck Foundation Biotechnology Resource Laboratory at Yale University. Biotinylated dT30 for surface plasmon resonance was purchased through the University of Iowa DNA Core (Sigma Genosys).Buffers—HI buffer contained 30 mm Hepes (diluted from 1 m stock at pH 7.8), 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.25 mm EDTA, 0.5% (w/v) inositol, and 0.01% (v/v) Nonidet P-40. 1× Tris borate/EDTA (1× TBE) gel buffer contained 89 mm Tris, 89 mm boric acid, and 2 mm EDTA.DNA Templates and Manipulation—A 40-bp dsDNA fragment of the early palindromic SV40 origin was made for helix destabilizing studies by labeling an oligonucleotide (SV40 top, 5′-CTCCAAAAAAGCCTCCTCACTACTTCTGGAATAGCTCAGA-3′) with [γ-32P]ATP by T4 polynucleotide kinase (New England Biosystems) following the manufacturer's recommendations. The labeled DNA was separated from free ATP with a P-30 Tris chromatography column (Bio-Rad) following the manufacturer's specifications and annealed to equal molar concentrations of the complementary sequence (SV40 bottom, 5′-TCTGAGCTATTCCAGAAGTAGTGAGGAGGCTTTTTTGGAG-3′) to make a 40-nt double-stranded DNA substrate for helix destabilization assays. A double-stranded 40-nt substrate containing an eight-nt bubble was made by annealing SV40 top to SV40 bottomB (5′-TCTGAGCTATTCCAGAGACGACAGGGAGGCTTTTTTGGAG-3′). The underlined portion indicates a region of non-complementary bases. Annealing reactions (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 20 mm MgCl2, and 50 mm NaCl) were placed in a PCR machine at 95 °C for 3 min ramped to 22 °C by a rate of 0.01 °C/s with a hold temperature of 4 °C. Annealing was monitored by 15% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (1× TBE). In all experiments, greater than 95% of labeled DNA was in double-stranded form.Proteins—Wild-type RPA was purified as described (43Henricksen L.A. Umbricht C.B. Wold M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11121-11132Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A form of human RPA that could not be phosphorylated, RPA·32 S4, 8, 11–13, 23, 29, 33, 39A,T21A (RPA·32Ala10), and one that mimics the constitutively phosphorylated form, RPA·32 S8, 11–13, 23, 29, 33D, T21D (RPA·32Asp8), were created and purified as described.2 The deletions of DBD F (RPA70Δ1–168 (RPA·70ΔN168)) (17Gomes X.V. Wold M.S. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 10558-10568Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), DBD C (RPA70Δ442–616 (RPA70ΔC442)) (Fig. 1), and the phosphorylation domain (RPA·32 Δ1–33 (RPA·32Δ33)) (34Henricksen L.A. Carter T. Dutta A. Wold M.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 3107-3112Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) were purified as described previously.The 15N-labeled RPA7Δ169–616 (DBD F) was made by transforming vector p11d-tRPA70 Δ169–616 (44Gomes X.V.

The cells were grown in 5 g/liter Celtone®-N medium (Martek Biosciences Corp.) supplemented with 1 g/liter glucose, 1.8 g/liter K2HPO4, 1.4 g/liter KH2PO4, 1 g/liter MgSO4·7H2O, and 11 mg/liter CaCl2·2H2O (14Jacobs D.M. Lipton A.S. Isern N.G. Daughdrill G.W. Lowry D.F. Gomes X. Wold M.S. J. Biomol. NMR. 1999; 14: 321-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The protein was purified by standard RPA purification procedures as described previously (43Henricksen L.A. Umbricht C.B. Wold M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11121-11132Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Helix Destabilization Assay—The proteins were dialyzed against HI-30 (30 mm KCl). The extent of dialysis was monitored by solution conductivity. Helix destabilization assays were carried out as described previously (22Lao Y. Lee C.G. Wold M.S. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 3974-3984Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Briefly, 15-μl reactions with HI buffer containing 30 mm KCl, 2 fmol radiolabeled DNA, increasing amounts of RPA (0–3160 fmol), and 50 μg/ml bovine serum albumin were incubated for 20 min at 25 °C. Reactions were terminated by adding SDS to a final concentration of 0.2% (to disrupt RPA·DNA complexes), followed by 4% glycerol and 0.01% bromphenol blue. The reaction products were separated on a 15% polyacrylamide gel (1× TBE) at 200 volts for 2.5 h. The gels were dried on Whatman 3-mm chromatography paper, and the radioactive bands were visualized by autoradiography. The radioactivity in each band was quantified using a Packard Instant Imager. The amount of dsDNA (%) was plotted against the concentration of RPA and then analyzed by non-linear least squares fitting to a Langmuir binding equation using Nonlin (22Lao Y. Lee C.G. Wold M.S. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 3974-3984Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 45Johnson M.L. Frasier S.G. Methods Enzymol. 1985; 117: 301-342Crossref Scopus (507) Google Scholar). Although the destabilization of DNA by RPA is not a simple bimolecular binding reaction, the Langmuir binding equation was used to precisely determine the midpoint of the transition between dsDNA and ssDNA. The midpoint (given with units of M–1) of the fitted curves was used as a value for comparing the activities of RPA forms in this assay.Time Course of Helix Destabilization—Saturating amounts of RPA (562 fmol for wild-type RPA, RPA·32Ala10, and RPA·32Δ33 and 3160 fmol for RPA·32Asp8, RPA·70ΔN168, and RPA70ΔC442) were combined with HI-30 to create a 120-μl reaction mixture. The DNA mixture consisted of 60 μl containing 50 μg/ml bovine serum albumin and 120 fmol of radiolabeled double-stranded 40-nt substrate or a double-stranded 40-nt substrate with an eight-nt bubble. The reaction mixture was incubated with the DNA mixture. Samples (15 μl) were removed at the indicated time points and immediately placed in microcentrifuge tubes with SDS (0.2% final concentration) to dissociate RPA·DNA complexes. The zero-min time point was made by adding the saturating amount of RPA to a mixture containing 2 fmol of DNA, 50 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 0.2% SDS in HI-30. The products were separated on a 15% polyacrylamide gel (1× TBE). The amount of ssDNA at each time point was quantitated by the Packard Instant Imager and plotted as a function of time.RPA70Δ169–616 Interactions with Peptides—The NMR data collection was performed as described previously (14Jacobs D.M. Lipton A.S. Isern N.G. Daughdrill G.W. Lowry D.F. Gomes X. Wold M.S. J. Biomol. NMR. 1999; 14: 321-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Lyophilized RPA32-WT peptide and RPA32-Asp peptide were dissolved in the same buffer as [15N]RPA70Δ169–616. Two-dimensional 1H-15N correlation maps were acquired on two identical [15N]RPA70Δ169–616 samples after addition stoichiometric and superstoichiometric amounts of either RPA32-WT or RPA32-Asp peptide to each RPA sample. Final spectra contained nearly a 20-fold excess of peptide relative to protein, and spectral changes were minimal in final spectra with RPA32-Asp, indicating an approach to saturation of peptide binding. Spectra were acquired at 750 MHz on a Varian Inova console, using water flip-back HSQC. We used a spectral width of 3000 Hz, 128 increments in the indirect dimension. Temperature was 25 °C.Surface Plasmon Resonance—Interaction of RPA with ssDNA was monitored using a surface plasmon resonance biosensor instrument, BIAcore 3000. The streptavidin biosensor surface was prepared by manually injecting 5′-biotinylated dT30 diluted to 0.5 nm in 10 mm sodium acetate, pH 4.8, and 1.0 m NaCl into the desired flow cell. Proteins were diluted in HBS-EP buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.005% polysorbate-20) from BIAcore brought to 1 mm dithiothreitol. Protein (20 μl of 4 nm solution) was loaded by the kinject option with the dissociation time of 500 s and a flow rate of 10 μl/min. Each experiment was repeated at least twice. Data were analyzed with the BIA Evaluation program and fit to a bimolecular Langmuir binding curve.RESULTSRole of N-terminal Phosphorylation Domain in RPA-DNA Interactions—RPA is composed of a high affinity DNA binding core (DBDs A and B) and three additional domains that can interact with DNA (DBDs F, C, and D; see Fig. 1). Mutations that decrease ssDNA binding also show defects in double-stranded DNA binding and helix destabilization activities (see Table I and Ref. 22Lao Y. Lee C.G. Wold M.S. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 3974-3984Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). There have been several reports of phosphorylation modulating DNA interactions, but no consistent models have emerged for how RPA phosphorylation affects DNA interactions (see the Introduction). Our initial studies with RPA phosphorylated with CDK2 family kinases or DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK) suggested that phosphorylation had minimal effects on RPA binding to single-stranded oligonucleotides. 4M. S. Wold, unpublished data. To extend these observations we compared the ssDNA binding activity of various mutant forms of RPA including N-terminal phosphorylation domain mutants (Fig. 1). We have shown that addition of negative charges to the N-terminal phosphorylation domain of RPA32 modulates RPA-protein interactions and that a mutant form, which has aspartic acid substitutions in the N-terminal phosphorylation domain of RPA32 (RPA·32Asp), has properties similar to those of phosphorylated RPA.2 Binding of the mutant forms of RPA to a 30-residue oligonucleotide was determined by surface plasmon resonance. The apparent binding constants for the phosphorylation domain mutants were the same as the wild-type RPA complex (Table I). Deletion or introduction of multiple point mutations of the N-terminal phosphorylation domain had no effect on the binding constant with oligo(dT)30. This is consistent with previous deletion analysis"
https://openalex.org/W2050647037,"Resistance to nucleoside analogue inhibitors of the reverse transcriptase of the HIV-1 often involves phosphorolytic excision of the incorporated chain terminator. Previous crystallographic and modeling studies suggested that this reaction could only occur when the enzyme resides in a pre-translocational stage. Here we studied mechanisms of polymerase translocation using novel site-specific footprinting techniques. Classical footprinting approaches, based on the detection of protected nucleic acid residues, are not sensitive enough to visualize subtle structural differences at single nucleotide resolution. Thus, we developed chemical footprinting techniques that give rise to hyperreactive cleavage on the template strand mediated through specific contacts with the enzyme. Two specific cuts served as markers that defined the position of the polymerase and RNase H domain, respectively. We show that the presence of the next correct dNTP, following the incorporated chain terminator, caused a shift in the position of the two cuts a single nucleotide further downstream. The footprints point to monotonic sliding motions and provide compelling evidence for the existence of an equilibrium between pre- and post-translocational stages. Our data show that enzyme translocation is reversible and uncoupled from nucleotide incorporation and the release of pyrophosphate. This translocational equilibrium ensures access to the pre-translocational stage after incorporation of the chain terminator. The efficiency of excision correlates with an increase in the population of complexes that exist in the pre-translocational stage, and we show that the latter configuration is preferred with an enzyme that contains mutations associated with resistance to nucleoside analogue inhibitors.

Matsuura S.E. So A.G. Scott W.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13471-13476Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar), which were shown to act as pyrophosphate donors. Increasing evidence suggests that the latter reaction pathway provides an important mechanism for HIV resistance to AZT and, to a certain degree, also to other NRTIs (3Meyer P.R. Matsuura S.E.

Recombinant RT enzymes that contain mutations associated with resistance to AZT (M41L, D67N, K70R, T215Y/T215F, and K219Q) do not prevent or diminish the incorporation of AZT-MP (12Krebs R. Immendorfer U. Thrall S.H. Wohrl B.M. Goody R.S. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 10292-10300Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Based on findings showing enhanced binding of the 3′ end of AZT-terminated primer strands to HIV-1 RT, it has later been suggested that pyrophosphorolysis might provide a possible reaction pathway involved in resistance to AZT (13Canard B. Sarfati S.R. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14596-14604Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Excision of AZT-MP occurs with considerable efficiency with wild-type HIV-1 RT, and the rate of pyrophosphorolysis appeared to be increased with resistant RT enzymes (1Arion D. Kaushik N. McCormick S. Borkow G. Parniak M.A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 15908-15917Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). The difference in regard to efficiency of the excision reaction between both enzymes is dramatically increased when NTPs act as a pyrophosphate donor (3Meyer P.R. Matsuura S.E. Mian A.M. So A.G. Scott W.A. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 35-43Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). In the light of these findings it is now widely accepted that ATP can act as a physiologically relevant pyrophosphate donor. It appears that excision of AZT-MP is particularly efficient as compared with other NRTIs, even in the context of wild-type HIV-1 RT (14Isel C. Ehresmann C. Walter P. Ehresmann B. Marquet R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 48725-48732Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The rate with which each individual inhibitor is removed from the primer terminus depends critically on the concentration of the dNTP that is complementary to the next template position (3Meyer P.R. Matsuura S.E. Mian A.M. So A.G. Scott W.A. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 35-43Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar, 10Naeger L.K. Margot N.A. Miller M.D. Antimicrob.

Biol. 2002; 323: 181-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Phosphorolytic cleavage of incorporated 2′,3′-dideoxynucleotides, including ddAMP and ddTMP, is compromised at nucleotide concentrations as low as 1 μm, whereas significantly higher concentrations are required to inhibit the excision of AZT-MP. The formation of a stable ternary dead end complex is diminished with AZT-terminated primer strands, which provides an explanation for the efficient removal of AZT-MP (16Tong W. Lu C.D. Sharma S.K. Matsuura S. So A.G. Scott W.A. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 5749-5757Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Based on crystallographic and modeling studies (7Boyer P.L. Sarafianos S.G. Arnold E. Hughes S.H. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 4832-4842Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar, 17Sarafianos S.G. Clark Jr., A.D. Das K. Tuske S. Birktoft J.J. Ilankumaran P. Ramesha A.R. Sayer J.M.

Chem. 2003; 278: 16280-16288Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), it has been suggested that the excision reaction could only occur when the 3′ end of the primer terminus remains in the same position at the polymerase active site, referred to as nucleotide binding site (N-site), where the chain-terminating nucleoside triphosphate was bound prior to its incorporation. This configuration defines a possible pre-translocational stage. Following the chemical step, the extended primer/template duplex translocates by a single base pair into the so-called priming site (P-site), and as a consequence, the next incoming nucleotide gains access to the N-site. The authors hypothesized that AZT-terminated primer strands reside preferentially at the N-site, because the bulky azido group may interfere with a P-site occupation of the primer terminus and/or with dNTP binding to the N-site. If this model is correct, there must be a mechanism that controls the formation of the pre-translocational stage after the incorporation of the chain terminator. This mechanism is unknown. Earlier studies suggested that translocation may take place during the release of PPi, immediately after incorporation of the last nucleotide (19Kati W.M. Johnson K.A. Jerva L.F. Anderson K.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25988-25997Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the 3′ end of the primer may ultimately move into the P-site, which is a prerequisite for dNTP binding and continuation of DNA synthesis. It has indeed never been demonstrated that the primer terminus has free access to the N-site. Rather, recent studies (17Sarafianos S.G. Clark Jr., A.D. Das K. Tuske S. Birktoft J.J. Ilankumaran P. Ramesha A.R. Sayer J.M. Jerina D.M. Boyer P.L. Hughes S.H. Arnold E. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 6614-6624Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar, 18Sarafianos S.G. Clark Jr., A.D. Tuske S. Squire C.J.

The available crystal structure models without an incoming dNTP show the primer terminus exclusively in the P-site (20Jacobo-Molina A. Ding J. Nanni R.G. Clark Jr., A.D. Lu X. Tantillo C.

Harrison S.C. Science. 1998; 282: 1669-1675Crossref PubMed Scopus (1345) Google Scholar), unless the enzyme is cross-linked to its nucleic acid substrate immediately after catalysis and before translocation takes place (17Sarafianos S.G.

EMBO J. 2002; 21: 6614-6624Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Here we employed site-specific footprinting experiments to characterize the relationship between the precise position of HIV-1 RT on its primer/template substrate and the efficiency with which chain-terminating nucleotides are removed from the primer terminus. Our data provide compelling evidence for the existence of a translocational equilibrium between pre- and post-translocational stages that ensures access of the 3′ end of the primer to the N-site after nucleotide incorporation and the release of pyrophosphate. Enzymes and Nucleic Acids—Wild-type HIV-1 RT (p66/p51) was expressed in Escherichia coli and purified essentially as described previously (23Le Grice S.F. Gruninger-Leitch F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 187: 307-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). Mutant enzymes were generated through site-directed mutagenesis using the Stratagene Quick-change kit according to the manufacturer's protocol. Substrates used in this study were derived from the HIV-1 polypurine tract (PPT) as described in our previous studies (24Gotte M. Maier G. Onori A.M. Cellai L. Wainberg M.A. Heumann H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11159-11169Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 25Gotte M. Kameoka M. McLellan N. Cellai L. Wainberg M.A. J. Biol.

The model template used in this study provides complementarity to these primers: 5′-CGTTGTCAGTGAATCAGCCCTTCCAGTCCCCCCTTTTCTTTTAAAAAGTGGCAAGA. Oligonucleotides (Invitrogen) were purified on 12% polyacrylamide, 7 m urea gels containing 50 mm Tris borate, pH 8.0, and 1 mm EDTA. Purified nucleic acid were eluted from gel slices in a buffer containing 500 mm ammonium acetate and 0.1% SDS. 5′ end-labeling of DNA primers was conducted with [γ-32P]ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase. 3′ end-labeling of the DNA template was performed with [α-32P]ddATP using terminal transferase according to the manufacturer's recommendation (Roche Applied Science). Labeled oligonucleotides were gel-purified as described above. Rescue of Chain-terminated DNA Synthesis—Rescue of DNA synthesis was studied at a single template position using a similar assay as we described earlier (11Gotte M. Arion D. Parniak M.A. Wainberg M.A. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 3579-3585Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). The pre-hybridized duplex (8.5 pmol), composed of the aforementioned template and primer strands, was incubated with 25.5 pmol of HIV-1 RT in a buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 50 mm NaCl, and 6 mm MgCl2 followed by the addition 10 μm dCTP and 10 μm AZT-TP (TriLink BioTechnologies) to generate primer strands terminated with AZT-MP. Chain termination with ddTTP and AZA-TP (TriLink BioTechnologies) was performed analogously. Reactions were allowed to proceed for 20 min to ensure complete extension of the primer and its quantitative chain termination with the nucleotide analogue. The excision of the analogue was initiated with ATP (3.5 mm) or, as indicated in some cases, with PPi (150 mm). Excision and the ensuing rescue of chain-terminated DNA synthesis was monitored in time course experiments. Samples were heat-denatured for 5 min at 95 °C and finally resolved on 8% polyacrylamide, 7 m urea gels. Site-specific Footprinting—Site-specific footprints with KOONO and Fe2+ were monitored on 3′ end-labeled DNA templates. Hybridization of the template (2.7 pmol) with the complementary primer (8.1 pmol) was conducted in a buffer containing 20 mm sodium cacodylate, pH 7, and 20 mm NaCl. The duplex was incubated with HIV-1 RT (16.2 pmol) in a buffer containing 120 mm sodium cacodylate, pH 7, 20 mm NaCl, 6 mm MgCl2, and a mixture of nucleotide triphosphates that allow quantitative chain termination as described above. Prior to the treatment with KOONO or Fe2+, complexes were preincubated for 20 min with increasing concentrations of the next nucleotide and at different temperatures as indicated in the figures. Treatment with Fe2+ and KOONO, respectively, was performed essentially as described recently (26Gotte M. Marquet R. Isel C. Anderson V.E. Keith G. Gross H.J. Ehresmann C. Ehresmann B. Heumann H. FEBS Lett. 1996; 390: 226-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 27Gotte M. Maier G. Gross H.J. Heumann H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10139-10146Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Site-specific Footprinting—It was our initial aim to develop novel footprinting techniques that would allow us to identify and to distinguish between pre- and post-translocational stages. We have previously applied high resolution footprinting techniques to study the interaction between HIV-1 RT and its DNA/DNA primer/template substrate (27Gotte M. Maier G. Gross H.J. Heumann H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10139-10146Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 28Metzger W. Hermann T. Schatz O. Le Grice S.F. Heumann H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5909-5913Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Two chemically distinct sources of hydroxyl radicals were utilized: the classical method with [Fe(EDTA)]2– that yields hydroxyl radicals via Fenton-like chemistry; and potassium peroxynitrite (KOONO), which is a metal-free source of hydroxyl radicals that are generated during decomposition of the conjugate acid HOONO. Despite a relatively high resolution of the hydroxyl radical footprints, the boundaries of the protected regions are not as clearly defined as required for the detection of structural differences associated with the translocation of RT. However, the same reactions give rise to hyperreactive cleavage at two distant template positions. Treatment of RT-DNA-DNA complexes with divalent Fe2+ ions in the absence of EDTA yields oxidative cleavage at template position –17 and a minor cut at position –18. We showed that Fe2+ ions can bind in the vicinity of the RNase H active center, and oxidation of the bound metal ions yields a local source of hydroxyl radicals that cleave the template in site-specific fashion. Treatment with KOONO yielded hyperreactive cleavage at template position –7. Specific binding of the enzyme is a prerequisite for hyperreactivity, and therefore, both of these signals may serve as specific markers to identify the precise position of the enzyme in the presence and absence of an incoming nucleotide. The KOONO-induced cut is of particular interest in this regard, because the observed hyperreactivity involves a single nucleotide in highly specific fashion. The model of the ternary complex shows Cys-280 of the large subunit of heterodimeric (p66/p51)HIV-1 RT in close proximity to the DNA template. Previous reports (29Quijano C. Alvarez B. Gatti R.M. Augusto O. Radi R. Biochem. J. 1997; 322: 167-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar) have shown that peroxynitrite mediates oxidation of the thiol group of cysteines, which may provide a link to the mechanism involved in the reaction. To test a possible involvement of Cys-280 in the reaction with KOONO, we generated complexes composed of an AZT-terminated primer strand and RT enzymes that contained either cysteine or serine at position 280 (Fig. 1A). KOONO-induced cleavage is specific for the Cys-280 enzyme, whereas the reaction is undetectable with the Ser-280 mutant (Fig. 1B, lanes 3 and 7). The efficiency of the reaction is severely compromised in the presence of the radical scavenger glycerol, suggesting the involvement of either hydroxyl radicals and/or thiyl radicals (Fig. 1B, lanes 3 and 5). Regardless of the precise chemical mechanism, the specific signal on the template strand is unambiguously assigned to the interaction between the cleaved nucleotide and Cys-280. We therefore refer to “site-specific footprinting” as opposed to classical footprinting techniques that do not yield information regarding the contribution of individual amino acid residues. Pre- and Post-translocational Stages—Both techniques were utilized to study possible differences in regard to the position of the enzyme in the presence of the next dNTP (Fig. 2, A and B). RT-DNA-DNA complexes, with an AZT-terminated primer strand, were pre-incubated in the absence or in the presence of the next complementary dNTP. In the absence of dNTPs, we observed Fe2+-mediated cuts at position –18 and less pronounced at position –19 (Fig. 2A, lane 3). These cuts are seen a single position further downstream –17/–18) when the next dNTP was present at high concentrations of 1 mm (Fig. 2A, lane 4). A similar shift is evident when comparing the positions of the KOONO-induced cut. In the absence of the next nucleotide, the cut is seen at position –8, whereas in the presence of the templated dNTP, the cut is seen at position –7 (Fig. 2A, lanes 7 and 8). Thus, it appears that the formation of a ternary dead end complex is associated with enzyme translocation. Our data suggest that the cut at position –8 is indicative for the pretranslocational stage in which the primer terminus occupies the N-site, whereas the cut at position –7 is indicative for the post-translocational stage in which the primer terminus occupies the P-site. A comparison of cleavage patterns with KOONO and Fe2+, respectively, shows that the ratio of cuts representing pre- and post-translocational stages is literally identical, for the two methods employed here, at any given dNTP concentration tested (Fig. 2C). Both methods suggest that dNTP concentrations of ∼22 μm are required to obtain 50% of complexes post-translocation (Fig. 2D). We note that the total amount of radioactivity increased selectively in the KOONO experiment at relatively high concentrations of dNTPs (≥100 μm), when 80% of the complexes exist already in the post-translocational stage. An increase in band intensities is not evident in the Fe2+ assay. It remains to be elucidated whether these data point to a local increase in the stability of the ternary complex, in close proximity to the polymerase active site, and/or to differences with respect to the efficiency of the KOONO-mediated reaction as the ternary complex is formed. Impact of the Temperature— Fig. 2 shows unambiguously that low dNTP concentrations facilitate the pre-translocational N-configuration. This result appears to be in conflict with the crystal structure models that show the primer terminus exclusively in the P-site (21Ding J. Das K. Hsiou Y. Sarafianos S.G. Clark Jr., A.D. Jacobo-Molina A. Tantillo C. Hughes S.H. Arnold E. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 284: 1095-1111Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar, 22Huang H. Chopra R. Verdine G.L. Harrison S.C. Science. 1998; 282: 1669-1675Crossref PubMed Scopus (1345) Google Scholar). In fact, the structures of the binary and the ternary complex show Cys-280 in close proximity to template position –7. Several factors may account for the apparent discrepancy between our biochemical data in solution and the crystal structure models. We initially evaluated the impact of the temperature. AZT-terminated complexes were pre-incubated in the presence of different dNTP concentrations and were kept at low temperatures on ice, i.e. conditions referred to as 0 °C, or at 37 °C, followed by treatment with KOONO at the same temperatures (Fig. 3). Reactions at 37 °C show a gradual shift of the KOONO-induced cut from position –8 toward position –7, as the concentration of the templated dNTP was increased (Fig. 3, left panel); however, the nontranslocated complex with the primer terminus in the N-site is still detectable in the presence of 100 μm dNTP (Fig. 3, left panel, lane 8). In contrast, at 0 °C the binary complex is only seen as a faint band in the pre-translocational stage (Fig. 3, lane 1, right panel), and the dNTP concentrations required to form the post-translocated stage is much lower as compared with the reaction at 37 °C (Fig. 3, compare lanes 2–5, left and right panels). The temperature-dependent differences in regard to the relative N- and P-site occupations are completely reversible. Reactions conducted at 37 °C, with a pre-incubation period of 30 min at low temperatures, gave essentially the same result as seen at 37 °C in the absence of pre-incubation on ice (Fig. 3, middle). These data show that the 3′ end of the primer does not ultimately translocate into the P-site to allow binding of the next dNTP. The primer terminus can occlude the N-site, and does this preferentially at physiologically relevant temperatures, i.e. at 37 °C. Impact of the Chemical Nature of the Chain Terminator— The aforementioned data form the basis to study the relationship between the precise position of HIV-1 RT on its nucleic acid substrate and the ability of the enzyme to excise the incorporated chain terminator via phosphorolytic cleavage. Excision is here monitored in assays that detect the removal of the chain terminator and the ensuing rescue of DNA synthesis at a single template position as described previously (11Gotte M. Arion D. Parniak M.A. Wainberg M.A. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 3579-3585Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar) (Fig. 4A). Our data are in good agreement with published results by others, showing efficient rescue of AZT-terminated DNA synthesis, whereas the excision of ddTMP is almost completely blocked under these conditions (3Meyer P.R. Matsuura S.E. Mian A.M. So A.G. Scott W.A. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 35-43Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar) (Fig. 4C, top). To analyze further whether the 3′-azido group may be an important structural feature that facilitates the excision reaction as suggested previously, we tested and compared the efficiency of excision with ddAMP and AZA-MP (Fig. 4B). Indeed, Fig. 4C (bottom) shows that rescue of AZA-terminated DNA synthesis is significantly increased, as compared with the reaction that involves ddAMP-terminated primers. The high efficiency with which AZT-MP and AZA-MP are removed from the primer terminus correlates with an increased population of complexes that exist in the N-configuration (Fig. 4, D and E). The site-specific footprints with KOONO revealed that pre-translocational stages with ddTMP or ddAMP-terminated primer strands are only seen at submicromolar concentrations of the templated dNTP or in the absence of dNTPs when the translocational status is not influenced by the formation of a ternary complex. At 37 °C, binary complexes with AZA-MP-terminated primer strands are found predominantly in the pre-translocational stage, whereas binary complexes with ddATP-terminated primer strands are characterized by a mixture of complexes in pre- and post-translocational stages (Fig. 4F, lanes 3 and 5, left panel). Importantly, at 0 °C, binary complexes with ddAMP-terminated primer strands are found exclusively in the post-translocational stage. The fact that the N-configuration is literally undetectable at lower temperatures helps to explain why the crystallographic data show exclusively the P-configuration. This result does not only confirm the temperature dependence of relative occupations of pre- and post-translocational stages, it also demonstrates the existence of an independent equilibrium between both configurations. Impact of the Sequence—There are also clear differences between the relative occupations of N- and P-sites when comparing AZA-MP and AZT-MP or ddAMP and ddTMP. In order to evaluate a possible impact of the sequence of the template on efficiency of the excision, we compared reactions with two different primers, termed PPT-1 and PPT-2, that were both terminated with AZT-MP (Fig. 5A). PPT-1 represents the primer that has been used throughout this study. PPT-2 binds at another location on the same template. In contrast to the high efficiency of rescue of AZT-terminated DNA synthesis with PPT-1, the reaction with PPT-2 is almost completely blocked (Fig. 5B). The analysis of populations of pre- and post-translocational stages shows that the 3′ end of the PPT-2 has no access to the N-site, not even in the absence of the templated dNTP (Fig. 5C). The formation of the post-translocational stage shows a similar dNTP-dependent appearance as seen with PPT-1, suggesting that the formation of the pre-translocational stage is selectively diminished with PPT-2.

Unlike the other family members, proteins encoded by DNMT2 genes were not known before to possess DNA methyltransferase activities. Most recently, we have shown that the genome of Drosophila S2 cells stably expressing an exogenous Drosophila dDNMT2 cDNA became anomalously methylated at the 5′-positions of cytosines (Reddy, M. N., Tang, L. Y., Lee, T. L., and Shen, C.-K. J. (2003) Oncogene, in press). We present evidence here that the genomes of transgenic flies overexpressing the dDnmt2 protein also became hypermethylated at specific regions. Furthermore, transient transfection studies in combination with sodium bisulfite sequencing demonstrated that dDnmt2 as well as its mouse ortholog, mDnmt2, are capable of methylating a cotransfected plasmid DNA. These data provide solid evidence that the fly and mouse DNMT2 gene products are genuine cytosine-5 DNA methyltransferases.

There are also other DNA MTase-like proteins expressed in the eukaryotic cells, but they are without well documented DNA methylation activities. These include the Dnmt3L (5Delpus R. Brenner C.

Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 2831-2838Google Scholar) and Dnmt2 proteins.The Dnmt2 proteins are relatively shorter than Dnmt3a, Dnmt3b, or Dnmt1, and structurally they are similar to the bacteria dcm enzyme (6Posfai J.

DNA methylation analysis of ES cells with homozygous knock-out of the mouse mDNMT2 genes suggested that mDnmt2 protein might also be an inactive DNA MTase (8Okano M. Xie S. Li E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 2536-2540Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). Finally, there has been no report on the DNA methylation activity of the Drosophila dDnmt2 until very recently. By overexpression of dDnmt2 in Drosophila S2 cells and subsequent analysis of the S2 cell genome with the sodium bisulfite sequencing approach, it was shown that specific regions were anomalously methylated in comparison to S2 cells without overexpression of the dDnmt2 protein (13Reddy, M. N., Tang, L. Y., Lee, T. L., and Shen, C.-K. J. (2003) Oncogene, in pressGoogle Scholar).To avoid potential side effects resulting from use of the long term-selected S2 cell culture in the above study, we have now examined the genome of transgenic Drosophila flies stably overexpressing dDnmt2. Interestingly, specific genomic regions of the transgenic flies were also found to be anomalously hypermethylated. To complement the fly analysis, we further carried out DNA transfection experiments to transiently express fly dDnmt2 or mouse mDnmt2 in S2 cells. As shown below, dDnmt2 as well as mDnmt2 are capable of methylating cytosines of a cotransfected plasmid. The conservation of the enzymatically active Dnmt2 proteins from mammals to the flies suggests that this DNA MTase subfamily likely carries out important and to-be-identified function(s).EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESPlasmid Constructs—For transgenic fly work, the dDNMT2 cDNA was released from pGEM(1)-dDNMT2 with PacI-NcoI and blunt ended. This dDNMT2 fragment, which contains bp 6964–7024 linked to 7074–8051 of the dDNMT2 gene, was cloned at the EcoRI site of the polylinker of pUAST (14Brand A. Perrimon N. Development (Camb.). 1993; 118: 401-415Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and the resulting plasmid, pUAST-dDNMT2, was used for germ line transformation. For transient transfection, pAC5.1/V5-HisA vector (Invitrogen) containing Drosophila actin promoter was digested with KpnI, blunt ended, and redigested with EcoRI. pSG424 plasmid (15Sedowski I. Ptashne M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 7539Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar) was cut with BglII, blunt ended, and the GAL4 DNA binding domain-containing fragment was released by EcoRI digestion. This fragment was ligated to the KpnI-EcoRI-digested pAC5.1/V5-HisA, resulting in pAC-GAL. For construction of pAC-GAL-dDNMT2 fusion plasmid, pGEM(2)-dDNMT2 was digested with ApaI, blunt ended, and the dDNMT2 fragment was released by EcoRI digestion. The fragment was ligated to pAC-GAL digested with EcoRI-SmaI. For construction of pAC-GAL-mDNMT2, full-length mDNMT2 cDNA was amplified from total RNA of mouse MEL cells by reverse transcriptase-PCR and cloned into pcDNA-3.1 HisC vector (Invitrogen), resulting in pcDNA-mDNMT2. The mDNMT2 fragment was released from pcDNA-mDNMT2 by EcoRI-NotI digestion and ligated to EcoRI-NotI-digested pAC-GAL. The target plasmid, pGEM-CG8547-p, contains the Drosophila CG8547 promoter region cloned into pGEM-T vector (Promega) following the manufacturer's guidelines. The details of construction of pGEM(1)-dDNMT2 and pGEM(2)-dDNMT2 are available upon request.Antibodies—Anti-dDnmt2 antibody was prepared as described in Reddy et al. (13Reddy, M. N., Tang, L. Y., Lee, T. L., and Shen, C.-K. J. (2003) Oncogene, in pressGoogle Scholar). dDnmt2-specific antibody was purified by passing the serum through dDnmt2-coupled CNBr-Sepharose column (Amersham Biosciences). The anti-gal mouse IgG monoclonal antibody, anti-mouse IgG, and anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibodies were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc.Fly Stocks and Transgenic Flies Overexpressing dDnmt2—Oregon R (OR) 1The abbreviation used is: OR, Oregon R. was used as the wild-type standard. The maintenance and manipulation of the Drosophila stocks were performed at 25 °C with standard cornmeal-yeast-agar food. For overexpression experiments, pUAST-dDNMT2 transgenic lines were established and crossed with daughterless-Gal4 (da-GAL4) driver that provides ubiquitous overexpression of the dDnmt2 protein.S2 Cell Culture and Cotransfection—Drosophila S2 cells were maintained in monolayers at 24 °C in Schneider's medium (Sigma), pH 6.9, supplemented with CaCl2 (0.6 mg/ml), NaHCO3 (0.4 mg/ml), 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen), and antibiotics (25 units/ml penicillin and 25 μg/ml streptomycin, Invitrogen). Transient transfection of S2 cells was performed by the CaPO4 precipitation method. S2 cells at a density of 1 × 106 cells/ml in 5 ml were seeded into T 25-cm2 flasks (Nunclon) and allowed to adhere to the surface for 12 h. 3 h before transfection, the medium was replenished. The calcium phosphate-DNA precipitate was prepared by mixing 5 μg of the expression plasmids (pAC-GAL, pAC-GAL-mDNMT2, or pAC-GAL-dDNMT2) and 5 μg of the target plasmid (pGEM-CG8547-p) in 225 μl of 0.1× TE (1 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and 0.1 mm EDTA), 25 μl of 2.5 m CaCl2, and 250 μl of 2× HEPES-buffered saline, pH 7.1. The precipitate was added drop-wise to the cultures. After 12 h of incubation, the medium was replaced, and incubation continued for another 48 h.Protein Isolation and Western Blot—The Drosophila protein extracts were prepared by homogenizing embryos or adult flies in 0.4 ml of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5% Triton X-100, 0.2% protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma), and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The lysates from S2 cells transiently transfected with pAC-GAL, pAC-GAL-dDNMT2, or pAC-GAL-mDNMT2 were prepared by lysis in the same buffer as above but with three freeze-thaw cycles. The lysates were centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 30 min. The protein concentrations in the supernatants were determined using Bio-Rad protein assay kit. 50 μg per lane of the extracts were loaded on SDS-PAGE gel and transferred onto nitrocellulose membrane by semidry transfer method. The membranes were probed with anti-dDnmt2 antibody or with anti-gal mouse monoclonal antibody. The hybridizing bands were developed with the enhanced chemiluminescence Western blotting detection system (PerkinElmer Life Sciences).DNA Isolation for Sodium Bisulfite Genomic Sequencing—Drosophila embryos or adult flies were homogenized in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm EDTA, 8.5% SDS, and 10 μg/ml proteinase K, and incubated at 50 °C overnight. The DNA was extracted with phenol: chloroform:isoamyl alcohol and then precipitated with isopropanol. After resuspension in H2O containing 1 μg/μl RNase A, the samples were incubated at 50 °C for 30 min and then stored overnight at 4 °C before use.To prepare nuclear DNA from transfected S2 cells, the cells were incubated in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 140 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, and 0.5% Nonidet P-40 (v/v) on ice for 10 min. The lysed cells were centrifuged at 1600 × g for 5 min. The pelleted nuclei were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in 0.5 ml of TRIzol (Invitrogen). The lysates were mixed with 0.2 ml of chloroform and incubated at room temperature for 10 min. The aqueous phase was separated by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 10 min. The DNA was then precipitated with ethanol, dissolved in 1× TE, pH 8.0, and used for bisulfite sequencing.Bisulfite Genomic Sequencing—The sodium bisulfite genomic sequencing followed the procedures used by Warnecke et al. (16Warnecke P.M. Stirzaker C. Song J. Grunau C. Melki J.R. Clarke S.J. Methods. 2002; 27: 101-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar) with modifications as described in Reddy et al. (13Reddy, M. N., Tang, L. Y., Lee, T. L., and Shen, C.-K. J. (2003) Oncogene, in pressGoogle Scholar). The PCR products from the second round of amplification were gel-purified, subcloned into pGEM-T (Promega), and subjected to automated sequencing in ABI 3730 DNA analyzer (Applied Biosystems).RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONAnomalous Genome Hypermethylation of dDnmt2-overexpressing Flies—dDNMT2 gene is located on Drosophila chromosome 2L and cytogenetically mapped to 33C4. After splicing, its mRNA encodes a protein 345 amino acids long (Fig. 1A). To examine whether overexpression of the dDnmt2 protein leads to deregulated methylation or hypermethylation of the fly genome, pUAST-dDNMT2 transgenic fly lines were established and crossed with da-GAL4 as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The overexpression of dDnmt2 protein was determined by immunoblotting with anti-dDnmt2. Under the conditions used, little dDnmt2 could be detected in the extracts from embryos and adults of the wild-type flies (lanes 1 and 3, Fig. 1B). On the other hand, the embryos and adult flies of the dDnmt2 transgenic line OR(dDNMT2) contain apparently overexpressed dDnmt2 protein (lanes 2 and 4, Fig. 1B).We isolated genomic DNAs from embryos and adult flies of both the wild-type and OR(dDNMT2). The DNA samples were then subjected to bisulfite genomic sequencing. Typical fluorograms of the sequencing results are exemplified in Fig. 1C, and the data of the methylation status of two of the genomic regions analyzed, CG8547 and CG8553, are summarized in Table I.Table IData summary of sequences of clones derived from sodium bisulfite-treated and PCR-amplified genomic DNA samples of DrosophilaDevelopmental stagesCG8547CG8553Clones sequencedMethylation statusClones sequencedMethylation statusOR2-h embryos1611 (-)2118 (-)5 (one m5C)1 (one m5C)2 (two m5C)6-h embryos2020 (-)1313 (-)Adults1311 (-)1010 (-)2 (one m5C)OR (dDNMT2)2-h embryos1210 (-)2011 (-)1 (one m5C)2 (one m5C)1 (two m5C)7 (many m5C)6-h embryos2414 (-)1614 (-)10 (many m5C)2 (one m5C)Adults1413 (-)87 (-)1 (one m5C)1 (one m5C) Open table in a new tab It has been shown previously that 0.1–0.6% of the cytosines of the fly genome are methylated, with the methylation level highest in the early embryonic stage (17Gowher H. Leismann O. Jeltsch A. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6918-6923Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 18Lyko F. Ramsahoye B.H. Jaenisch R. Nature. 2000; 408: 538-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar). As shown in Table I, overexpression of dDnmt2 in the flies resulted in deregulated hypermethylation of both CG8547 and CG8553. In particular, the sequencing data of 20 clones derived from CG8547 of the 6 h embryos of the wild type indicate that the region is void of m5C. However, the sequences of 10 out of the 24 clones derived from the same region of the 6 h embryos of OR(dDNMT2) showed hypermethylation in the genome of this dDnmt2-overexpressing line (Table I). Similarly, CG8553 of the 2-h embryos of OR(dDNMT2) is hypermethylated in comparison with the wild type embryos. Both the embryos and adults of OR(dDNMT2) appear to have more m5C within this region than the wild type (Table I). In particular, 7 out of 20 clones from the 2-h embryos of OR(dDNMT2) have identical hypermethylated pattern as shown partly in Fig. 1C.Both dDnmt2 and mDnmt2 Generated m5C on Cotransfected Plasmid DNA in Drosophila Cells—The Drosophila S2 cell line has been used recently in a stable transfection assay to demonstrate methylation of the fly genome by dDnmt2 (13Reddy, M. N., Tang, L. Y., Lee, T. L., and Shen, C.-K. J. (2003) Oncogene, in pressGoogle Scholar). To double check potential side effects that might be caused by long term cell culturing in the above assay, we carried out transient transfection studies with S2 cells. A series of plasmids, including pAC-GAL, pAC-GAL-dDNMT2, and pAC-GAL-mDNMT2, were constructed previously for the test of potential repressor activities of dDnmt2 and mDnmt2. We have used these plasmids to see whether transient expression of gal-dDmnt2 or gal-mDnmt2 fusion would methylate a cotransfected plasmid.As described under “Experimental Procedures,” the three expression plasmids were individually cotransfected with the target plasmid pGEM-CG8547-p. The expression of either gal-dDnmt2 or gal-mDnmt2 could be easily detected by Western blot (Fig. 2A). At 60 h post-transfection, the nuclei of the transfected cells were purified. The nuclear DNA samples containing mainly the plasmids transported into the nuclei were isolated and subjected to sodium bisulfite sequencing using appropriate primers specific for the insert of pGEM-CG8547-p (Fig. 2B). As exemplified in Fig. 2C, none of the 15 DNA clones from the nuclei expressing gal contained m5C-derived C bases (panel I, Fig. 2C). In contrast, the DNA sequences of 6 out of 21 and 6 out of 24 clones derived from the nuclei expressing gal-dDNMT2 and gal-mDNMT2, respectively, indicated that the DNA insert of the target plasmid was methylated by these two proteins in transiently transfected S2 cells. As exemplified in panels II–IV and V–VII, respectively, of Fig. 2C, dDnmt2 and mDnmt2 caused similar and overlapping of C-methylation of the target plasmid. The data demonstrated that both dDnmt2 and mDnmt2 possess C-5 methyltransferase activities.Fig. 2DNA methylation by transiently expressed dDnmt2 and mDnmt2. Cotransfections of the target plasmid pGEM-CG8547-p with pAC-GAL, pAC-GAL-dDNMT2, or pAC-GAL-mDNMT2 were carried out. Nuclear DNAs were isolated from the transfected cells as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Sodium bisulfite sequencing assay was then performed using primers specific for the insert of pGEM-CG8547-p. A, Western blot of extracts from cells cotransfected with the target plasmid plus pAC-GAL (lane 1), pAC-GAL-mDNMT2 (lane 2), or pAC-GAL-dDNMT2 (lane 3). The probe used for the blot was anti-gal (Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc.). B, nucleotide sequence of the insert of the target plasmid. The segments according to which the primers were designed for PCR amplification of the bisulfite treated DNAs are underlined by the three arrows. Also underlined are C residues methylated during transient transfection by mDnmt2, as exemplified by the sequence of one of the DNA clones derived from nuclear plasmid DNAs of the transfected cells.

It not only generated deregulated hypermethylation of the genome of stably transfected Drosophila cell line (13Reddy, M. N., Tang, L. Y., Lee, T. L., and Shen, C.-K. J. (2003) Oncogene, in pressGoogle Scholar), but it is also active, albeit as a gal fusion polypeptide, in the current transient transfection assay. In addition, it caused deregulated hypermethylation of specific regions of the genomes of transgenic flies overexpressing the protein. Most interestingly, the mouse ortholog of the fly enzyme, mDnmt2, also methylates DNA in the transient transfection assay. It should be noted here that CG dinucleotide is not the primary target of methylation by the Dnmt2 proteins, as in the case of the other eukaryotic DNA MTases.Our data are consistent with several previous studies implicating that, except for yeast pmt1 (7Wilkinson C.R. Bartlett R. Nurse P. Bird A.P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 203-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 12Pinarbas E. Elliott J. Hornby D.P. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 257: 804-813Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), the Dnmt2 protein family members might be active DNA MTases. First, the functional motifs conserved among the well known DNA MTases such as Dnmt1 are also conserved in dDnmt2 and mammalian Dnmt2 (8Okano M. Xie S. Li E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 2536-2540Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar, 9Yoder J.A. Bestor T.H. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1998; 7: 279-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar, 10Hung M.S.

Hendrich B. Bird A. Nat. Genet. 1999; 23: 389-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Second, the human Dnmt2 protein binds tightly to DNA, and in crystals, its complex with DNA adopts a conformation similar to the protein-DNA complex of a bacterial C-methylating enzyme M.HhaI (19Dong A. Yoder J.A. Zhang X. Zhou L. Bestor T.H. Cheng X. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 439-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Third, the mammalian Dnmt2 proteins, as well as other known active DNA MTases, are attached to 5′-azacytidine-incorporated DNA (20Liu K. Wang Y.F. Cantemir C. Muller M.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 2709-2719Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar).While proposing that the eukaryotic DNMT2 gene family encodes active DNA MTases, we note here that mouse with homozygous knock-out of the mDNMT2 gene has no obvious phenotype. 2M. Okano and E. Li, personal communication. Similarly, we have not yet noticed obvious phenotype of the dDnmt2-overexpressing flies. 3V. Rasheva and M.-S. Hung, unpublished data. Thus, the DNMT2 gene is not essential for the growth and development of the flies and mice. Identification of the target genes regulated by the Dnmt2 proteins could be the first step toward understanding the biological functions of this new class of eukaryotic DNA MTases. Methylation of the vertebrate genomes at cytosines is known to be accomplished by the combined actions of proteins encoded by different cytosine-5 DNA methyltransferases or DNA MTases. These proteins include the de novo DNA MTases Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b, the maintenance DNA MTase Dnmt1, and their isomers (1Bestor T.H. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2000; 9: 2395-2402Crossref PubMed Scopus (1571) Google Scholar, 2Robertson K.D. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 5361-5379Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar, 3Okano M. Xie S. Li E. Nat.

The Dnmt2 proteins are relatively shorter than Dnmt3a, Dnmt3b, or Dnmt1, and structurally they are similar to the bacteria dcm enzyme (6Posfai J. Bhagwat A.S. Posfai G. Roberts R.J.

For construction of pAC-GAL-mDNMT2, full-length mDNMT2 cDNA was amplified from total RNA of mouse MEL cells by reverse transcriptase-PCR and cloned into pcDNA-3.1 HisC vector (Invitrogen), resulting in pcDNA-mDNMT2. The mDNMT2 fragment was released from pcDNA-mDNMT2 by EcoRI-NotI digestion and ligated to EcoRI-NotI-digested pAC-GAL. The target plasmid, pGEM-CG8547-p, contains the Drosophila CG8547 promoter region cloned into pGEM-T vector (Promega) following the manufacturer's guidelines. The details of construction of pGEM(1)-dDNMT2 and pGEM(2)-dDNMT2 are available upon request.Antibodies—Anti-dDnmt2 antibody was prepared as described in Reddy et al. (13Reddy, M. N., Tang, L. Y., Lee, T. L., and Shen, C.-K. J. (2003) Oncogene, in pressGoogle Scholar). dDnmt2-specific antibody was purified by passing the serum through dDnmt2-coupled CNBr-Sepharose column (Amersham Biosciences). The anti-gal mouse IgG monoclonal antibody, anti-mouse IgG, and anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibodies were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc.Fly Stocks and Transgenic Flies Overexpressing dDnmt2—Oregon R (OR) 1The abbreviation used is: OR, Oregon R. was used as the wild-type standard. The maintenance and manipulation of the Drosophila stocks were performed at 25 °C with standard cornmeal-yeast-agar food. For overexpression experiments, pUAST-dDNMT2 transgenic lines were established and crossed with daughterless-Gal4 (da-GAL4) driver that provides ubiquitous overexpression of the dDnmt2 protein.S2 Cell Culture and Cotransfection—Drosophila S2 cells were maintained in monolayers at 24 °C in Schneider's medium (Sigma), pH 6.9, supplemented with CaCl2 (0.6 mg/ml), NaHCO3 (0.4 mg/ml), 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen), and antibiotics (25 units/ml penicillin and 25 μg/ml streptomycin, Invitrogen). Transient transfection of S2 cells was performed by the CaPO4 precipitation method. S2 cells at a density of 1 × 106 cell"
https://openalex.org/W2130403231,"Mitochondrial DNA is constantly exposed to high levels of endogenously produced reactive oxygen species, resulting in elevated levels of oxidative damaged DNA bases. A large spectrum of DNA base alterations can be detected after oxidative stress, and many of these are highly mutagenic. Thus, an efficient repair of these is necessary for survival. Some of the DNA repair pathways involved have been characterized, but others are not yet determined. A DNA repair activity for thymine glycol and other oxidized pyrimidines has been described in mammalian mitochondria, but the nature of the glycosylases involved in this pathway remains unclear. The generation of mouse strains lacking murine thymine glycol-DNA glycosylase (mNTH1) and/or murine 8-oxoguanine-DNA glycosylase (mOGG1), the two major DNA N-glycosylase/apurinic/apyrimidinic (AP) lyases involved in the repair of oxidative base damage in the nucleus, has provided very useful biological model systems for the study of the function of these and other glycosylases in mitochondrial DNA repair. In this study, mouse liver mitochondrial extracts were generated from mNTH1-, mOGG1-, and [mNTH1, mOGG1]-deficient mice to ascertain the role of each of these glycosylases in the repair of oxidized pyrimidine base damage. We also characterized for the first time the incision of various modified bases in mitochondrial extracts from a double-knock-out [mNTH1, mOGG1]-deficient mouse. We show that mNTH1 is responsible for the repair of thymine glycols in mitochondrial DNA, whereas other glycosylase/AP lyases also participate in removing other oxidized pyrimidines, such as 5-hydroxycytosine and 5-hydroxyuracil. We did not detect a backup glycosylase or glycosylase/AP lyase activity for thymine glycol in the mitochondrial mouse extracts."
https://openalex.org/W2031395967,"Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) from Escherichia coli K12 W3100 is known to contain several glycoforms, and the basic structure has been investigated previously by methylation analyses (Holst, O. (1999) in Endotoxin in Health and Disease (Brade, H., Opal, S. M., Vogel, S. N., and Morrison, D., eds) pp. 115–154; Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York). In order to reveal dependences of gene activity and LPS structure, we have now determined the composition of de-O-acylated LPS by electrospray ionization-Fourier transform ion cyclotron-mass spectrometry (ESI-FT-MS) and identified 11 different LPS molecules. We have isolated the major glycoforms after de-O- and de-N-acylation and obtained four oligosaccharides that differed in their carbohydrate structure and phosphate substitution. The main oligosaccharide accounted for ∼70% of the total and had a molecular mass of 2516 Da according to ESI-FT-MS. The dodecasaccharide structure (glycoform I) as determined by NMR was consistent with MS and compositional analysis. One minor oligosaccharide (5%) of the same carbohydrate structure did not contain the 4′-phosphate of the lipid A. Two oligosaccharides contained the same phosphate substitution but differed in their carbohydrate structure, one (5%) which contained an additional β-d-GlcN in 1→7 linkage on a terminal heptose residue (glycoform II) which was N-acetylated in LPS. A minor amount of a molecule lacking the terminal l-α-d-Hep in the outer core but otherwise identical to the major oligosaccharide (glycoform III) could only be identified by ESI-FT-MS of the de-O-acylated LPS. The other oligosaccharide (20%) contained an α-Kdo-(2→4)-[α-l-Rha-(1→5)]-α-Kdo-(2→4)-α-Kdo branched tetrasaccharide connected to the lipid A (glycoform IV). This novel inner core structure was accompanied by a truncation of the outer core in which the terminal disaccharide l-α-d-Hep-(1→6)-α-d-Glc was missing. The latter structure was identified for the first time in LPS and revealed that changes in the inner core structure may be accompanied by structural changes in the outer core.

Brade H. Opal S.M. Vogel S.N. Morrison D.C. Endotoxin in Health and Disease. Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York1999: 31-38Google Scholar), and many LPS are highly toxic (endotoxins) in mammals (2Redl H. Schlag G. Bahrami S. Brade H. Opal S.M. Vogel S.N. Morrison D.C. Endotoxin in Health and Disease. Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York1999: 795-808Google Scholar, 3Suffredini A.F. O'Grady N.P. Brade H. Opal S.M. Vogel S.N. Morrison D.C. Endotoxin in Health and Disease. Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York1999: 817-830Google Scholar). For the bacteria the outer membrane represents the first line of defense against e.g. antibiotics or bile salts, and therefore the integrity of the outer membrane is of prime importance for the survival of bacteria and as such is a target for the development of new antibacterial drugs. LPS from wild-type enterobacteria is made up of an O-antigen, the core-region, and lipid A (4Holst O. Brade H. Opal S.M. Vogel S.N. Morrison D.C. Endotoxin in Health and Disease. Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York1999: 115-154Google Scholar). The structural features of LPS necessary for a functioning outer membrane are not well understood. However, conserved structural features of LPS have been recognized such as the lipid A moiety, the presence of heptose and Kdo in the inner core region, and the presence of conserved phosphate groups that result in a high number of negative charges at the surface of the membrane. It can be speculated that the chemical structure of the conserved parts of the LPS molecule has evolved to support specific functions of the outer membrane. Thus, the number and position of negative charges may be modulated by masking groups such as 2-aminoethanol or 4-amino-arabinose leading to enhanced resistance against polycationic antibiotics, e.g. polymyxin B (1Vaara M. Brade H. Opal S.M. Vogel S.N. Morrison D.C. Endotoxin in Health and Disease. Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York1999: 31-38Google Scholar). Experimental evidence has been obtained recently showing that certain LPS structural motifs are recognized by outer membrane proteins (Omp) and that LPS plays a role for the correct folding and activity of proteins, such as PhoE (5De Cock H. Brandenburg K. Wiese A. Holst O. Seydel U. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5114-5119Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), OmpT (6Kramer R.A. Brandenburg K.

The isolation and detailed structural characterization of all different glycoforms present in LPS from Escherichia coli J-5 aided the interpretation of results from in vitro folding experiments of outer membrane proteins (5De Cock H.

Biochem. 1999; 260: 235-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Whereas the presence and distribution of negative charges is undoubtedly very important, the highly conserved nature of carbohydrates that build the inner core region implies that they are particularly suited to fulfill certain functions. In order to better understand the structural requirements of LPS for a functioning outer membrane and compensatory mechanisms upon mutations, it is necessary to obtain a detailed knowledge about the molecular composition of LPS. Serological and structural features of the LPS from E. coli K12 have been investigated earlier and led to the classification as a separate core type (4Holst O. Brade H. Opal S.M. Vogel S.N. Morrison D.C. Endotoxin in Health and Disease. Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York1999: 115-154Google Scholar, 10Schmidt G. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1973; 77: 151-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Characteristic features are the occurrence of heptose in the outer (11Holst O. Zähringer U. Brade H. Zamojski A. Carbohydr. Res. 1991; 215: 323-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) and rhamnose in the inner core (12Holst O. Brade H. Carbohydr. Res. 1990; 207: 327-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar), the latter being associated with the immunodominant antigen (13Mayer H. Rapin A.M. Schmidt G. Boman H.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1976; 66: 357-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). LPS consists of several different molecular species, and early studies indicated the presence of structurally heterogeneous LPS in E. coli K12 (13Mayer H. Rapin A.M. Schmidt G. Boman H.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1976; 66: 357-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). E. coli K12 strains are widely used as hosts in molecular biology and were therefore the first used to elucidate the genetic details of LPS biosynthesis (14Schnaitman C.A. Klena J.D. Microbiol. Rev. 1993; 57: 655-682Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15Klena J.D. Ashford II, R.S. Schnaitman C.A. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 7297-7307Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Klena J.D. Pradel E.

Although many details of LPS biosynthesis in E. coli K12 are known, there still remain open questions. During the course of this study, Frirdich et al. (23Frirdich E. Lindner B. Holst O. Whitfield C. J. Bacteriol. 2003; 185: 1659-1671Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) raised the question whether the structure of the inner core in LPS has an influence on the biosynthesis of the outer core. Overexpression of the gene product of the waaZ gene performed in their study led to increased amounts of an α-Kdo-(2→4)-α-Kdo-(2→4)-α-Kdo trisaccharide in the inner core that was accompanied by a truncation of the outer core. At this stage, it remained unanswered whether the gene waaZ encoded a Kdo transferase that specifically transferred the third Kdo residue onto the common α-(2→4)-Kdo-disaccharide inner core structure, which is known to be generated by a single bifunctional enzyme (24Brozek K.A. Hosaka K. Robertson A.D. Raetz C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 6956-6966Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It also remained an open question whether the truncation of the outer core was secondary because of the overexpression of the WaaZ gene product. The gene responsible for the transfer of rhamnose to the inner core of E. coli K12 has yet to be identified. We have developed methods to purify the different glycoforms present in LPS (9Müller-Loennies S. Holst O. Lindner B. Brade H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 260: 235-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) and for their conjugation to protein carrier molecules allowing their use in serological studies (25Müller-Loennies S. Grimmecke D. Brade L. Lindner B. Kosma P. Brade H. J. Endotoxin Res. 2002; 8: 295-305Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 26Brade L. Holst O. Brade H. Infect. Immun. 1993; 61: 4514-4517Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The advantage of the developed procedures is the fact that they allow the determination of the relative distribution of the various glycoforms and allow the study of their immunoreactivities. The complete carbohydrate chains of E. coli R1 to R4 LPS have been investigated (27Vinogradov E.V. Van Der D.K. Thomas-Oates J.E. Meshkov S. Brade H. Holst O. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 261: 629-639Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 28Müller-Loennies S. Lindner B. Brade H. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 5982-5991Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar); however, such data for E. coli K12 LPS are lacking. We have therefore now extended our studies to E. coli K12 W3100 LPS and show that it contains two major and two minor glycoforms that are subject to further modification by phosphorylation. Whereas methylation analyses were able to identify the main carbohydrate structure of different parts of the LPS molecule previously and to identify structural modifications (11Holst O. Zähringer U. Brade H. Zamojski A. Carbohydr. Res. 1991; 215: 323-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 12Holst O. Brade H. Carbohydr. Res. 1990; 207: 327-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar, 29Jansson P.-E. Lindberg A.A. Lindberg B. Wollin R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1981; 115: 571-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar), the applied methods failed to reveal how far non-stoichiometrically found substitutions were connected to each other. However, as seen for the E. coli J-5 mutant, from a biosynthetic point of view this information can be of importance in order to design experiments and understand the regulation of genes and enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of LPS and the factors influencing the function of the outer membrane. We now show that E. coli K12 W3100 LPS apart from the known structures contains a so far unknown LPS. The analysis of this structure proves a connection between the biosynthesis of the inner and outer core of LPS and additionally provides a basis for the cloning of the rhamnosyl-transferase involved in E. coli K12 LPS assembly. Bacteria and Bacterial LPS—E. coli K12 strain W3100 was cultivated and used for the isolation of LPS by phenol/chloroform/petrol ether extraction as reported (30Müller-Loennies S. Holst O. Brade H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 224: 751-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Analytical Methods—Neutral sugars, fatty acids, GlcN, Kdo, and bound organic phosphate were determined as described (31Kaca W. de Jongh-Leuvenink J. Zähringer U. Rietschel E.Th. Brade H. Verhoef J. Sinnwell V. Carbohydr. Res. 1988; 179: 289-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Preparation of Deacylated LPS of E. coli K12 W3100 —LPS (1.09 g) was de-O-acylated by mild hydrazinolysis (32Haishima Y. Holst O. Brade H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 203: 127-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) (yield 797 mg) and subjected to alkaline de-N-acylation as described (33Holst O. Thomas-Oates J.E. Brade H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 222: 183-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). After neutralization by addition of 4 m HCl, desalting by gel filtration on Sephadex G-10 in 10 mm NH4HCO3, and lyophilization (yield 366.6 mg), 180 mg of the deacylated oligosaccharide fraction was subjected to high performance anion-exchange chromatography (HPAEC; 9 runs of 20 mg each) using a semi-preparative CarboPak PA100 column (9 × 250 mm) and a DX300 chromatography system (Dionex, Germany). Conditions for semi-preparative and analytical HPAEC were essentially as described previously (9Müller-Loennies S. Holst O. Lindner B. Brade H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 260: 235-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Briefly, for semipreparative chromatography a gradient of 1–50% B in 60 min with eluents (A) H2O and (B) 1 m NaOAc was used. Aliquots of fractions (3 μl) were spotted on silica TLC plates and charred with ethanolic sulfuric acid for detection. Two main fractions (fraction 3, yield 30.2 mg, oligosaccharide (OS) 1; fraction 4, yield 13.92 mg, OS 4) and two minor fractions (fraction 1, yield 4.6 mg, OS 2; fraction 2, yield 6.8 mg, OS 3) were collected, neutralized, and desalted by gel filtration on Sephadex G-10 as described. Analytical HPAEC (Fig. 1) was carried out on a column of CarboPak PA1 (4 × 250 mm, Dionex) using the eluents (eluent A) H2O and (eluent B) 1 m NaOAc and a gradient from 1 to 99% of eluent B in 80 min. The run was monitored by pulsed amperometric detection after post-column addition of NaOH. NMR Spectroscopy—NMR spectra were recorded of samples of OS 1 (15 mg), OS 2 (4.6 mg), OS 3 (6.8 mg), and OS 4 (13.9 mg) in 0.5-ml solutions in D2O using a Bruker DRX 600 Avance spectrometer equipped with a multinuclear probe head with z-gradient. Chemical shift values were determined in reference to acetone 2.225 (1H) and 31.5 ppm (13C). All spectra were recorded at a temperature of 300 K using standard Bruker pulse programs. Sodium deutero-oxide was added to the samples prior to one- and two-dimensional 31P NMR spectroscopy to achieve uniform signals as described (34Heine H. Müller-Loennies S. Brade L. Lindner B. Brade H. Eur. J. Biochem. 2003; 270: 440-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Electrospray Ionization-Fourier Transform Ion Cyclotron-Mass Spectrometry (ESI-FT-ICR MS)—ESI-FT-ICR MS was performed in the negative and positive ion mode using an APEX II Instrument (Bruker Daltonics, Billerica, MA) equipped with a 7 tesla actively shielded magnet and an Apollo ion source. Mass spectra were acquired using standard experimental sequences as provided by the manufacturer. Samples were dissolved at a concentration of ∼10 ng μl–1 in a 50:50: 0.001 (v/v/v) mixture of 2-propanol, water, and triethylamine and sprayed at a flow rate of 2 μl min–1. Capillary entrance voltage was set to 3.8 kV and dry gas temperature to 150 °C. Capillary skimmer dissociation was induced by increasing the capillary exit voltage from –100 V to –350 V. Infrared multiphoton dissociation (IRMPD) of isolated parent ions was performed with a 35-watt, 10.6-μm CO2 laser (Synrad, Mukilteo, WA). The duration of laser irradiation was adapted to generate optimal fragmentation and varied between 10 and 80 ms. The unfocused laser beam was directed through the center of the ICR cell, and fragment ions were detected after a delay of 0.5 ms. Compositional analysis of PCP-extracted LPS from E. coli K12 (Table I) revealed the presence of Rha, Glc, Gal, Hep, Kdo, GlcN, and phosphate in a molar ratio of 0.2:2.8:1.0:4.1:1.9:2.1: 5.1. It has been shown previously that all sugars are present in the d-configuration apart from l-Rha and that all sugars are present as pyranoses (4Holst O. Brade H. Opal S.M. Vogel S.N. Morrison D.C. Endotoxin in Health and Disease. Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York1999: 115-154Google Scholar). Fatty acid analysis by gas liquid chromatography also identified the presence of 3-OH-C14:0, tetradecanoic acid, and dodecanoic acid fatty acids indicating that the acylation pattern was the same as reported for other strains of E. coli (35Zähringer U. Lindner B. Rietschel E.T. Brade H. Opal S.M. Vogel S.N. Morrison D.C. Endotoxin in Health and Disease. Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York1999: 93-114Google Scholar). We have prepared de-O-acylated LPS by mild hydrazinolysis a part of which was further de-N-acylated under strong alkaline conditions (Fig. 1). The mixture of deacylated LPS oligosaccharides was then subjected to HPAEC and four oligosaccharides (OS 1 to OS 4) were obtained. ESI-FT-MS (Fig. 2A) of the de-O-acylated LPS revealed the presence of 11 different LPS structures that had a composition as indicated in Table II. The major molecule had a mass of 2969 Da (M1) which was consistent with a composition of four hexoses, four Hep, two Kdo, two GlcN, four phosphates, and two amide-linked 3-OH-C14:0 fatty acids (glycoform I). After deacylation NMR analysis of this oligosaccharide (OS 1) identified as hexoses one Gal and three Glc residues (see below). An additional molecular ion was observed which contained an additional GlcNAc (glycoform II, 3172 Da; M4), and one molecular species was devoid of one Hep residue (glycoform III, 2777 Da; M8). Another major component was identified that had a mass of 2981 Da, indicating a composition of three hexoses, three Hep, three Kdo, two GlcN, one Rha, four phosphates, and two amide-linked 3-OH-C14 fatty acids (glycoform IV; M2). NMR analysis of the oligosaccharide (OS 4) after deacylation revealed that this molecule contained one Gal and only two Glc as hexoses.Table IChemical composition of E. coli K12 W3100 LPSComponentaKdoAcP, Kdo determination after hydrolysis in acetate buffer, pH 4.5; KdoHCl, Kdo determination after hydrolysis in 0.1 m HCl; ld-Hep, l-glycero-d-manno-heptose.nmol/mgMolar ratiobMolar ratios calculated relative to Gal = 1.0.GlcN3962.1KdoAcP2161.2KdoHCl3521.9Porg9614.1Glc5292.8Gal1881.0ld-Hep7744.1C12:01430.8C14:01460.83OH-C14:05953.2a KdoAcP, Kdo determination after hydrolysis in acetate buffer, pH 4.5; KdoHCl, Kdo determination after hydrolysis in 0.1 m HCl; ld-Hep, l-glycero-d-manno-heptose.b Molar ratios calculated relative to Gal = 1.0.

The molecular ion with 3092 Da could have been also due to the presence of an additional 2-aminoethanol substitution in the pentaphosphorylated glycoform I (M11). The detailed investigation of the cluster of triple charged ions in the non-charge deconvoluted ESI-FT-MS spectrum around 1030 Da (Fig. 2B) revealed that both molecules were present (M6 and M11). A triple charged ion of higher intensity was observed with 1029.660 Da which originated from a monoisotopic molecule with a mass of 3091.99 Da (M11) containing 2-aminoethanol. The signal of very low intensity at 1029.696 Da corresponded to a trisphosphorylated glycoform I LPS molecule with a mass of 3092.11 Da (M6). Very small amounts of glycoforms III and IV were identified that contained only three phosphates (2697 Da, M10; 2901 Da, M7). Thus, ESI-FT-MS indicated the presence of four different glycoforms I–IV, which differed in their substitution with GlcNAc, Hep, and Rha. In addition, heterogeneity was observed for the phosphate substitution. Although the majority of all glycoforms contained four phosphates, all of them were also present with three phosphates. Only small amounts of glycoforms I and II contained five phosphates, and a very small amount of a pentaphosphorylated glycoform I LPS contained 2-aminoethanol. Complete deacylation of LPS and ESI-FT-MS of the mixture of oligosaccharides (Fig. 2C) detected molecular ions with masses of 2436, 2448, 2516, 2528, 2596, and 2677 Da. The separation of the mixture by analytical HPAEC (Fig. 1) revealed the presence of two major (OS 1 and OS 4) and two minor (OS 2 and OS 3) oligosaccharides that were separated by semipreparative HPAEC and further analyzed by ESI-FT-MS and NMR. Structural Analysis of OS 1 and OS 2—ESI-FT-MS analysis of the mixture of deacylated oligosaccharides (Fig. 2C) and of the isolated OS 1 (not shown) revealed a molecular mass of 2516.67 Da that was in agreement with a chemical composition of four hexoses, four Hep, two GlcN, two Kdo, and four phosphates (Mtheoretical = 2516.59 Da). The one-dimensional 1H NMR spectrum (Fig. 3) contained 10 signals of anomeric protons of carbohydrates and two pairs of signals of methylene groups belonging to two Kdo residues and identified this oligosaccharide as a dodecasaccharide. Furthermore, 31P NMR confirmed the presence of four phosphates (Fig. 4). The full assignment (Tables III and IV) of NMR signals by 1H,1H-DQF-COSY, TOCSY, and 13C,1H-heteronuclear correlation spectra such as HMQC, HMQC-TOCSY, and HMBC identified two GlcN residues, one in α-configuration (residue A, 3 J H-1,H-2 = 3 Hz) and the other in β-configuration (residue B, 3 J H-1,H-2 = 8 Hz). NOE spectroscopy revealed that these were β-(1→6) connected and according to 31P,1H-HMQC phosphorylated at positions 1 and 4′. Furthermore, HMBC revealed that one Kdo (residue C) was substituting position 6 of the β-GlcN. Thus, the GlcN-disaccharide represented the lipid A backbone. An NOE between H-6 of the second Kdo and H-3ax (weak) and H-3eq (strong) of Kdo C revealed that these were α-(2→4) connected (36Bock K. Thomsen J.U. Kosma P. Christian R. Holst O. Brade H. Carbohydr. Res. 1992; 229: 213-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Three Hep residues (E, F, and H) were identified and NOEs between the anomeric proton of H and protons H-6 and H-7a/b of F in addition to an NOE between the anomeric proton of F and H-3 of E proved that they formed the Hep-(1→7)-Hep-(1→3)-Hep trisaccharide (residues H, F, and E, respectively) commonly found in enterobacterial LPS (4Holst O. Brade H. Opal S.M. Vogel S.N. Morrison D.C. Endotoxin in Health and Disease. Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York1999: 115-154Google Scholar). The structure was confirmed by HMBC correlation signals between the anomeric protons of H and C-7 of F, and of F and C-3 of E, respectively. This trisaccharide substituted the inner Kdo (residue C) in position 5 leading to a NOE between the anomeric proton of E and protons H-5 and -7 of Kdo C. According to NOE data and HMBC three α–Glc residues (K, I, and G) formed the trisaccharide Glc-(1→2)-Glc-(1→3)-Glc which was connected to position 3 of Hep F. These residues thus belonged to the outer core (4Holst O. Brade H. Opal S.M. Vogel S.N. Morrison D.C. Endotoxin in Health and Disease. Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York1999: 115-154Google Scholar). Additionally, the 3 J H-1,H-2 coupling constant of 4 Hz and the small 3 J H-3,H-4 (4 Hz) and 3 J H-4,H-5 (< 3 Hz) coupling constants of residue M identified it as a α-Gal residue that was bound to position 6 of Glc G (HMBC and NOE, low field chemical shift of C-6, and protons H-6a, H-5, and high field shift of H-6b). The fourth Hep (L) was connected to position 6 of Glc K. The configurations at the anomeric centers of all residues apart from Kdo were confirmed by a non-decoupled 1H,13C-HMQC spectrum (>170 Hz for α and <168 Hz for β; Fig. 5). The two remaining phosphates were located at position 4 of both Hep residues E and F (Fig. 4 and Table V) because the 31P resonances gave correlation signals to the respective protons in HMQC, and the cross-correlation signals of these protons in DQF-COSY showed an additional coupling of ∼10 Hz due to 3 J P,H-coupling (9Müller-Loennies S. Holst O. Lindner B. Brade H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 260: 235-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Thus, OS 1 possessed the chemical structure as depicted in Fig. 3 and represented glycoform I.Fig. 431P NMR spectra of OS 1 to 4 of deacylated E. coli K12 W3100 LPS. The spectra were recorded after addition of sodium deutero-oxide (final concentration, ∼10 mm) as described (34Heine H. Müller-Loennies S. Brade L. Lindner B. Brade H. Eur. J. Biochem. 2003; 270: 440-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Whereas OS 1, 2, and 3 contained four phosphates, OS 2 contained three phosphate less. 1H,31P-HMQC spectroscopy revealed that the phosphate substitution was as depicted in Fig. 3 for OS 1, 3, and 4. In OS 2 the 4′-phosphate of the lipid A backbone was missing.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Table III1H NMR chemical shifts of deacylated core oligosaccharides OS 1 to 4 obtained from deacylated LPS of E. coli K12 W3100OSResidueH-1H-2H-3axH-3eqH-4H-5H-6aH-6bH-7aH-7bH-8aH-8b1A→6-αGlcN 1P5.7133.4593.9253.6344.1333.7924.31125.7023.4343.9213.5524.1423.8574.26835.6773.4363.9223.6264.1533.7894.30845.7453.4773.9363.6394.1233.8054.3011B→6-βGlcN 4P4.8593."

Fostriecin (Fig. 1) and the structurally related PD 113,270 and PD 113,271 are three related natural products produced by Streptomyces pulveraceus subsp. fostreus ATCC 31906 (2Tunac J.B. Graham B.D.

The latter activity is attributed to the efficacious in vivo antitumor activity of fostriecin, as well as its in vitro activity against leukemia, lung, breast, and ovarian cancer. The same activity likely also permits fostriecin to limit myocardial infarct size and to protect cardiomyocytes during ischemia (6Armstrong S.C. Gao W. Lane J.R. Ganote C.E. J. Mol.

Recent evidence suggests that PP2A has a role in regulating cell death by apoptosis, in the activation of natural killer cells and cytotoxic T-lymphocytes involved in tumor surveillance, and even in the transcription and replication of human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV1) (9Faulkner N.E. Lane B.R. Bock P.J. Markovitz D.M. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 2276-2281Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). For these reasons selective protein phosphatase inhibition has been suggested as a clinically unexplored novel mechanism worthy of pursuit for the introduction of a new class of antitumor or even antiviral agents (1Lewy D.S. Gauss C.M. Soenen D.R. Boger D.L. Curr. Med. Chem. 2002; 9: 2005-2032Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 5Boger D.L. Ichikawa S. Zhong W. J. Am. Chem.

The principal differences from fostriecin are replacement of the C-8 methyl substituent by ethylamine and the terminal allylic alcohol by a cyclohexane ring. Like fostriecin, these compounds are produced in multiple forms (Fig. 1). PLM-B (phospholine) contains a fully reduced cyclohexyl ring, whereas the other PLMs and the leustroducsins contain a hydroxyl substituent (C-18) esterified with a wide array of carboxylic acids (ranging in length from 4 to 9 carbons) (10Fushimi S.

The phoslactomycins and leustroducsins all exhibit antifungal activity (1Lewy D.S. Gauss C.M. Soenen D.R. Boger D.L. Curr. Med. Chem. 2002; 9: 2005-2032Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 10Fushimi S. Furihata K. Seto H. J. Antibiot. (Tokyo). 1989; 42: 1026-1036Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 13Tomiya T.

More importantly, these compounds like fostriecin are potent and highly selective inhibitors of PP2A (IC50 values raging from 3.7 to 5.8 μm) as compared with PP1 (IC50 > 1 mm) (15Usui T. Marriott G. Inagaki M. Swarup G. Osada H. J. Biochem. 1999; 125: 960-965Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Most recently, the PP2A inhibition activity of phoslactomycin has been shown to inhibit tumor metastasis through augmentation of natural killer cells (16Kawada M. Kawatsu M. Masuda T. Ohba S. Amemiya M. Kohama T. Ishizuka M. Takeuchi T. Int. Immunopharmacol. 2003; 3: 179-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar).The unique and selective biological activity of this class of natural products has attracted considerable interest in recent years. Phase I clinical trials of fostriecin were suspended before either dose-limiting toxicities or therapeutic plasma levels were attained because of inherent drug instability and unpredictable purity in the clinical supply of the natural product (1Lewy D.S. Gauss C.M. Soenen D.R. Boger D.L. Curr. Med. Chem. 2002; 9: 2005-2032Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 4de Jong R.S. Mulder N.H. Uges D.R. Sleijfer D.T. Hoppener F.J. Groen H.J. Willemse P.H. van der Graaf W.T. de Vries E.G. Br. J. Cancer. 1999; 79: 882-887Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). In an attempt to address these limitations and further develop this class of novel antitumor agents, no less than six elegant total syntheses of fostriecin have been developed over a short 2-year period (5Boger D.L. Ichikawa S. Zhong W. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2001; 123: 4161-4167Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 17Fujii K. Maki K. Kanai M. Shibasaki M. Org.

A complementary approach for developing these agents can come through gene manipulation of the natural biosynthetic process. In all cases, the production of numerous analogs complicates the isolation process and the purity of the product, as well as negatively impacting yields (2Tunac J.B. Graham B.D. Dobson W.E. J. Antibiot. (Tokyo). 1983; 36: 1595-1600Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 14Uramoto M. Shen Y.C. Takizawa N. Kusakabe H. Isono K. J. Antibiot.

(Tokyo). 1989; 42: 1019-1025Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). These analogs are based on variations in the level of hydroxylation and, in the case of the PLMs and leustroducsins, esterification of the resulting secondary alcohol with a series of different carboxylic acids (this modification does not significantly impact either antifungal activity or binding to PP2A). Using a PLM-producing strain, Streptomyces sp. HK-803, we have carried out an incorporation study of [7-13C]CHC, which suggests that PLM-A and PLM C–F are derived from a hydroxylation of PLM-B. The entire 75 kb of the phoslactomycin biosynthetic gene cluster has been identified and sequenced, including a gene, plmS 2, encoding the cyctochrome P-450 monooxygenase responsible for this hydroxylation. The application of a new PCR targeting technology (23Gust B. Challis G.L. Fowler K. Kieser T. Chater K.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 1541-1546Crossref PubMed Scopus (1191) Google Scholar) in this strain allowed rapid gene replacement of plmS 2. The resulting mutant strain, NP1, produces only PLM-B, at 6-fold higher levels than the wild type strain. This mutant will serve as a starting point for engineering strains capable of producing fostriecin and PLM analogs.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESStrains and Culture Conditions—All Escherichia coli strains used in this study were grown following standard protocols (24Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The PLM producer Streptomyces sp. HK-803 (13Tomiya T. Uramoto M. Isono K. J. Antibiot. (Tokyo). 1990; 43: 118-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) was grown at 28 °C in SY medium (1.0% soluble starch, 0.1% yeast extract, 0.1% N-Z-amine, type A) at pH 7.0. The PLM production medium was 2.0% glucose, 0.1% beef extract, 1.0% soybean flour, 0.2% NaCl, 0.005% K2HPO4, and 0.2% l-phenylalanine at pH 7.0. A loop-full of Streptomyces sp. HK-803 spores (from an SY agar plate) was inoculated into a baffled 500-ml flask containing 70 ml of the production medium and was incubated at 28 °C in the dark for 96 h on a rotary shaker at 170 rpm.Analyses of PLM Production—The culture filtrates and mycelial extracts of Streptomyces sp. HK-803 wild type and the mutant NP1 were worked up as described previously (13Tomiya T. Uramoto M. Isono K. J. Antibiot. (Tokyo). 1990; 43: 118-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). HPLC was performed on a system equipped with a Waters™ 600 pump and a Waters 996 photodiode array detector under the following conditions: column, Senshu Pak PEGASIL ODS (4.6 × 250 mm for analytical HPLC and 20 × 250 mm for preparative HPLC); solvent, acetonitrile, 0.05% HCO2H (40/60); flow rate, 1 ml/min for analytical HPLC and 9 ml/min for preparative HPLC; detection at UV 235 nm. Pure PLM standards were used to generate a standard curve for determining PLM production in both the wild type and NP1 mutant. The PLMs were also identified by co-injections with the corresponding standards and by LC-MS analyses. LC-MS spectra (positive turbo-ion spray ionization mode; HPLC, Hewlett-Packard Series 1100; column, 150 × 2.1 mm RP 183.5-mm column from Waters; mobile phase, 40:60 CH3CN-water (containing 0.05% HCO2H) at a flow rate 0.2 ml/min) were taken on a PerkinElmer Life Sciences SCIEX API 2000 pneumatically assisted electrospray triple quadrupole mass spectrometer.Incorporation of [7-13C]CHC into PLMs—[7-13C]CHC was synthesized from cyclohexanone and K13CN via cyclohexanecarbonitrile as described previously (25Jiricny J. Orere D.M. Reese C.B. J. Chem. Soc. Perkin Trans. I. 1980; : 1487-1492Crossref Google Scholar, 26Orere D.M. Reese C.B. J. Chem. Soc. Chem. Commun. 1977; : 280-281Crossref Google Scholar): 1H NMR (270 MHz, CDCl3) δ 1.20–2.00 (10H, m), 2.33 (1H, tdt, J H-H = 15.1, 2 J C-H = 7.1, J H-H = 3.6 Hz), 11.4 (1H, bs); 13C-NMR (67.5 MHz, CDCl3) δ 25.4, (d, 3 J C-C = 3.85 Hz, C-3), 25.8, 28.8 (d, 2 J C-C = 1.08 Hz, C-2), 43.0 (1 J C-C = 55.0 Hz, C-1), 182.6 (enhanced signal, C-7).The labeled CHC (10 mg) was dissolved in EtOH (1 ml) and added directly to each of 10 flasks containing 70 ml of production medium at 30 h after inoculation. LC-MS analyses (see “Experimental Procedures”) of the resulting PLMs allowed an estimation of the level of incorporation of [7-13C]CHC. For each PLM the ratio of the [M+1] and [M+2] relative to [M], the abundance of the molecular ion (m/z), was determined. A similar analysis was carried out with unlabeled PLMs and allowed the contributions of naturally abundant 13C and [7-13C]CHC to be separated in the standard manner. The amount of each 13C-labeled PLM derived from [7-13C]CHC was determined as a percentage of that entire analog pool. The location of the 13C label was confirmed by 13C NMR analyses of HPLC purified PLM-B, -E, and -F (see “Experimental Procedures”) using previously published 13C assignments (10Fushimi S. Furihata K. Seto H. J. Antibiot. (Tokyo). 1989; 42: 1026-1036Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar).Cloning and Sequencing of the PLM Biosynthetic Gene Cluster—The total genomic DNA of Streptomyces sp. HK-803 (grown on SY medium) was prepared according to the cetyltrimethylammonium bromide procedure for the isolation of genomic DNA in the manual of Practical Streptomyces genetics (27Kieser T. Bibb M.J. Buttner M.J. Chater K.F. Hopwood D.A. Practical Streptomyces Genetics. The John Innes Foundation, Norwich, United Kingdom2000: 170-171Google Scholar). A genomic library was constructed by using Supercos-1 cosmid vector as recommended in the manufacturer's protocol (Stratagene). About 2000 cosmid clones were probed by using the DNA of a digoxigenin-labeled chcA gene (28Wang P. Denoya C.D. Morgenstern M.R. Skinner D.D. Wallace K.K. DiGate R. Patton S. Banavali N. Schuler G. Speedie M.K. Reynolds K.A. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 6873-6881Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Preparation of the digoxigenin probes and the subsequent hybridization and detection were performed as recommended in the manufacturer's protocol (Roche Applied Science). The overlapping cosmid clones identified by the chcA probe were sequenced to completion using the TOPO shotgun subcloning kit (Invitrogen). Automated DNA sequencing was performed on an ABI Prism 3700 DNA sequencer at the DNA core facility of the Medical College of Virginia, Virginia Commonwealth University. The DNA sequences were assembled using SeqMan II (DNAStar Inc.). The assembled DNA and deduced protein sequences were analyzed with MacVector 7.0 software (Accelrys) and FramePlot (29Ishikawa Hotta K. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1999; 174: 251-253Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and were compared with sequences in the public data bases using the BLAST suite of programs (30Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Meyers W.

The aac (3)IV resistance marker and oriT were amplified from the pIJ 773 disruption cassette (23Gust B. Challis G.L. Fowler K. Kieser T. Chater K.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The resulting PCR product was used to replace plmS 2 first in cosmid clone 3A11 and then in Streptomyces sp. HK-803 following the established methodologies (23Gust B. Challis G.L. Fowler K. Kieser T. Chater K.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 1541-1546Crossref PubMed Scopus (1191) Google Scholar), replacing mannitol soy agar with SY agar. Allelic replacement of the plmS 2 gene in the NP1 mutant was confirmed by Southern hybridization analysis, and PCR amplification and sequencing.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONIncorporation Studies Establish CHC as a Precursor to all PLMs—Analysis of the PLM-B structure suggested that it is likely assembled by a type I modular polyketide synthase (PKS) using a CHC starter unit. The other PLMs and the leustroducsins may be derived by hydroxylation of this PLM-B or by use of a cis-3-hydroxy-CHC starter unit. A CHC-derived moiety has previously been observed as a side chain in the antifungal agent ansatrienin and shown to be derived from shikimic acid (31Moore B.S. Cho H. Casati R. Kennedy E. Reynolds K.A. Mocek U. Beale J.M. Floss H.G. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1993; 115: 5254-5266Crossref Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 32Casati R. Beale J.M. Floss H.G. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1987; 109: 8102-8104Crossref Scopus (27) Google Scholar). LC-MS analysis of the PLM mixture obtained from the feeding of [7-13C]CHC to produce cultures of Streptomyces sp. HK-803 showed that this compound was efficiently converted into all PLMs. More than 50% of the entire pool of PLM-E, which contains two cyclohexyl moieties, was labeled by at least one molecule of [7-13C]CHC. Approximately half of this level of labeling (21–28%) was observed for PLM-A, PLM-D, PLM-E, and PLM-F, consistent with these analogs containing only one putative CHC-derived unit. Curiously, almost 48% of the PLM-B was labeled by [7-13C]CHC. Consistent with these observations, a 13C NMR spectra (125 MHz, CD3OD) of the purified PLM-E showed strongly enhanced signals at the predicted sites, C-15 (δ 139.9 ppm) and C-1′ (δ 177.3 ppm), indicating that CHC is the precursor of both cyclohexane moieties. Strong and exclusive enrichments of the C-15 (δ 138.2 ppm) was observed in 13C NMR analyses of purified PLM-B and PLM-F. The level of enrichment in all cases was comparable with that determined from LC-MS analyses. These observations demonstrate that a coenzyme A-activated CHC (CHC-CoA) is the likely starter unit for the biosynthesis of all PLMs. A pathway from shikimic acid to CHC-CoA has been delineated in the ansatrienin producer, Streptomyces collinus (31Moore B.S.

The corresponding biosynthetic genes have recently been identified (33Cropp T.A. Wilson D.J. Reynolds K.A. Nat. Biotechnol. 2000; 18: 980-983Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 34Chen S. von Bamberg D. Hale V. Breuer M. Hardt B. Muller R. Floss H.G. Reynolds K.A. Leistner E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 261: 98-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar).Isolation and Characterization of the PLM Biosynthetic Gene Cluster—The PLM biosynthetic gene cluster from the Streptomyces sp. HK-803 was identified from a cosmid library of genomic DNA using the chcA gene (28Wang P. Denoya C.D. Morgenstern M.R. Skinner D.D. Wallace K.K. DiGate R. Patton S. Banavali N. Schuler G. Speedie M.K. Reynolds K.A. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 6873-6881Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) from CHC-CoA biosynthetic gene cluster of S. collinus as a probe. A cosmid clone, 3A11, thus identified was used as a probe to identify two overlapping cosmids, 10B4 and 3E5 (Fig. 2). These three cosmids spanning 97 kb of the Streptomyces sp. HK-803 genome were sequenced and analyzed. This sequence analysis revealed a 75-kb region containing 29 open reading frames (ORFs) that appear to be associated with PLM biosynthesis. The flanking region contained a series of ORFs that are highly homologous (>80% identity at the amino acid sequence level) with and have an organization similar to the primary metabolic genes identified through sequencing of the S. coelicolor genome (35Bentley S.D. Chater K.F. Cerdeno-Tarraga A.M. Challis G.L. Thomson N.R. James K.D. Harris D.E. Quail M.A. Kieser H. Harper D. Bateman A. Brown S. Chandra G. Chen C.W. Collins M. Cronin A. Fraser A. Goble A.

Nature. 2002; 417: 141-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (2555) Google Scholar), which aided in delimiting the PLM biosynthetic gene cluster. The sequence analysis revealed the existence of the complete set of highly conserved CHC-CoA biosynthetic genes (plmJK, plmL, chcA, plmM) (28Wang P. Denoya C.D. Morgenstern M.R. Skinner D.D. Wallace K.K. DiGate R. Patton S. Banavali N. Schuler G. Speedie M.K. Reynolds K.A. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 6873-6881Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 33Cropp T.A. Wilson D.J. Reynolds K.A. Nat. Biotechnol. 2000; 18: 980-983Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) as well as plmI (encoding a 3-deoxy-d-arabino-heptulosonate-7-phosphate synthase) responsible for formation of the CHC-CoA starter unit. As in S. collinus, the chcB gene encoding the Δ2,3-enoyl CoA isomerase responsible for catalyzing the penultimate step in the CHC-CoA pathway does not appear to be located close to the other CHC-CoA biosynthetic genes or within the antibiotic biosynthetic gene cluster (36Patton S.M. Cropp T.A. Reynolds K.A. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 7595-7604Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). A total of six large ORFs encoding the core PLM PKS were also identified (Fig. 3). PLM1 contains an initiation domain, presumably responsible for loading the CHC-CoA, and the first extension module (Fig. 3), whereas PLM2–3 has two modules containing the appropriate predicted catalytic activitities for catalyzing the second and third extension steps. Each of the remaining components, PLM4–PLM7, contains a single module. PLM7 has a thioesterase domain, consistent with a role in catalyzing the last extension step and subsequent release of the polyketide chain by formation of the α,β-unsaturated δ-lactone (formation of a six-member lactone is unusual, as most thioesterase domains studied to date catalyze formation of large 12–14 macrolactone structures under natural conditions) (37Tsai S.C. Lu H. Cane D.E. Khosla C. Stroud R.M. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 12598-12606Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 38Lu H. Tsai S.C. Khosla C. Cane D.E. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 12590-12597Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Two of the PKS polypeptides PLM4 and PLM6, contain the same catalytic domains, which precludes unambiguous assignment in this process. One of many interesting features of the PLM PKS cluster is that it contains only three dehydratase domains, and yet it produces a compound with three Z- and one E-double bonds (PLM7 does not contain the predicted dehydratase domain). Virtually all known cases in which a PKS modules has a ketoreductase and a dehydratase activity result in the formation of E-double bonds (39Reid R. Piagentini M. Rodriguez E. Ashley G. Viswanathan N. Carney J. Santi D.V. Hutchinson C.R. McDaniel R. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 72-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that a stereochemical configuration of the product derived from the ketoreductase domain may control the double bond geometry. A diagnostic Asp residue has been proposed for predicting the stereospecificity of PKS ketoreductase domains and, by extension, the double bond configuration for products from cognate dehydratase domains (39Reid R. Piagentini M. Rodriguez E. Ashley G. Viswanathan N. Carney J. Santi D.V. Hutchinson C.R. McDaniel R. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 72-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). We constructed a multiple alignment of the seven ketoreductase domains of the PLM PKS and found that this model alone was only partially predictive of the stereochemical configuration of the PLM product.Fig. 2The phoslactomycin biosynthetic gene cluster. The genes plm1–plm8 encode the polyketide synthase (see Fig. 3 for more details). Genes proposed to be involved in providing the precursors CHC-CoA and butyryl CoA (plmT 7) are shown in light blue. Regulatory genes (dark blue) and an ABC transporter (green) are shown. Genes depicted in yellow encode enzymes proposed to be involved in postpolyketide modification and include two cytochrome P-450 monooxygenases (plmS 2, plmT 4), an oxidoreductase (plmT 8), an aminotransferase (plmT 1), an a kinase (plmT5). The plmS 2 mutant (strain NP1) produces only PLM-B (see Fig. 4).

Chem. 2002; 277: 48028-48034Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), and a crotonyl-CoA reductase (plmT 7), presumably required for providing the ethylmalonyl-CoA extender unit used in the fourth and sixth extension steps. The plmT 5 gene product has some sequence identity with homoserine kinases and is likely responsible for phosphorylation of the C-9 hydroxyl group and for providing biological activity to PLM. Analysis of the gene cluster also predicts an oxidoreductase (plmT 8) and aminotransferase (plmT 1), likely involved in the replacement of a hydroxyl group of a C-8 hydroxyethyl side chain with an amine. The gene cluster also contains numerous other genes involved in regulation and resistance. A detailed analysis of the entire PLM gene cluster will be described elsewhere.PCR-targeted Gene Disruption of plmS2—Analysis of the PLM biosynthetic gene cluster, together with the results of the biosynthetic incorporation study, indicated that three hydroxylation steps (C-18, C-8, and the C-8 ethyl side chain) occur after assembly of the polyketide chain from the CHC-derived starter unit. Analysis of the PLM biosynthetic gene cluster revealed two ORFs, plmT 4 and plmS 2, that both encode proteins with high sequence similarity to each other (38% identity and 53% similarity) as well as cytochrome P-450 monooxygenases from several microorganisms, including those involved in the modification of the natural products of streptomycetes (41Xue Y. Wilson D. Zhao L. Liu H. Sherman D.H. Chem. Biol. 1998; 5: 661-667Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). We reasoned that replacement of one of these genes would provide a strain blocked in hydroxylation of C-18 of PLM. With the caveat that the other hydroxylations are catalyzed by the second monooxygenase, the mutant strain should produce PLM-B exclusively.There are numerous different app"

In order to explore the effect of IGTP expression on CVB3-induced pathogenesis, we have established a doxycycline-inducible Tet-On HeLa cell line overexpressing IGTP and have analyzed activation of several signaling molecules that are involved in cell survival and death pathways. We found that following IGTP overexpression, protein kinase B/Akt was strongly activated through phosphorylation, which leads to phosphorylation of glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3). Furthermore, in the presence of CVB3 infection, the intensity of the phosphorylation of Akt was further enhanced and associated with a delayed activation of caspase-9 and caspase-3. These data indicate that IGTP expression appears to confer cell survival in CVB3-infected cells, which was confirmed by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium salt cell viability assay. However, the ability of IGTP to induce phosphorylation of Akt and to promote cell survival was attenuated by the phosphotidylinositol-3 kinase (PI3-K) inhibitor LY294002. Transient transfection of the cells with a dominant negative Akt construct followed by doxycycline induction and CVB3 infection reversed Akt phosphorylation to basal levels and returned caspase-3 activity to levels similar to those when the PI3-K inhibitor LY294002 was added. Moreover, IGTP expression inhibited viral replication and delayed CVB3-induced cleavage of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4G, indicating that IGTP-mediated cell survival relies on not only the activation of PI3-K/Akt, inactivation of GSK-3 and suppression of caspase-9 and caspase-3 but also the inhibition of viral replication.

This cytokine is known to exert its effects largely by activation of IFN-γ-responsive genes (1Stark G.R. Kerr I.M. Williams B.R. Silverman R.H. Schreiber R.D. Annu. Rev.

One such gene has been identified recently as IFN-γ-inducible GTPase (IGTP).

Recently, it has been found that IGTP-deficient mice display a loss of host resistance to acute infection by the protozoan Toxoplasma gondi (6Taylor G.A. Collazo C.M. Yap G.S. Nguyen K. Gregorio T.A.

A. 2000; 97: 751-755Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). However, the mechanism by which IGTP mediates an antimicrobial response is unknown. Our previous study by differential mRNA display has demonstrated that IGTP is up-regulated in coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3)-infected mouse hearts (11Yang D. Yu J. Luo Z. Carthy C.M. Wilson J.E. Liu Z. McManus B.M. Circ. Res. 1999; 84: 704-712Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), suggesting the involvement of IGTP in host cell defense to viral infection. However, the role of IGTP in such a defense mechanism has not yet been defined. Our previous unpublished data also showed that IGTP overexpression delayed CVB3-induced cleavage of pro-casapse-3, implicating that IGTP may be involved in cellular survival signaling pathways. This speculation was supported by reports indicating the involvement of GTPases in pleiotropic-signaling events ranging from cell adhesion, spreading, transcription activation, and cell cycle (reviewed in Ref. 12Rodriguez-Viciana P. Warne P.H. Dhand R. Vanhaesebroeck B. Gout I. Fry M.J. Waterfield M.D. Downward J. Nature. 1994; 370: 527-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (1733) Google Scholar). It has also been reported that Ras (p21Ras), a GTP-binding protein in another GTPase family, once activated, may interact directly with the catalytic subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3-K) in a GTP-dependent manner (12Rodriguez-Viciana P. Warne P.H. Dhand R. Vanhaesebroeck B. Gout I. Fry M.J. Waterfield M.D. Downward J.

Biol. 2000; 10: 1225-1228Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). These data implicate that IGTP-mediated inhibition of apoptosis may occur via activation of PI3-K/Akt survival pathway. Therefore, in this study, we focused our investigation on the IGTP-mediated PI3-K/Akt signaling pathway in the regulation of cell survival and cell death induced by CVB3 infection. CVB3, a positive single-stranded RNA enterovirus in the Picornaviridae family, is the most common human pathogen associated with the pathogenesis of myocarditis and idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy, a condition that may necessitate heart transplantation (11Yang D.

However, the specific genes responsible for triggering these events to occur are poorly understood. PI3-K is a member of a subfamily of lipid kinases implicated in many physiological processes (21Fruman D.A. Meyers R.E. Cantley L.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 481-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (1324) Google Scholar, 22Wymann M.P. Pirola L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1436: 127-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (580) Google Scholar). PI3-K is activated by phosphorylation on tyrosine residues in response to many growth factors and cytokines. Once activated, PI3-K catalyzes the addition of a phosphate moiety specifically to the 3′-OH position of the inositol ring of phosphatidylinositols (21Fruman D.A. Meyers R.E. Cantley L.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 481-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (1324) Google Scholar, 22Wymann M.P. Pirola L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1436: 127-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (580) Google Scholar). The resulting 3′-phosphorylated phosphatidylinositols serve as secondary messengers to activate many downstream signaling targets, initiating the physiological effects of PI3-K (23Franke T.F. Cantley L.C. Nature. 1997; 390: 116-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 24Andjelkovic M. Alessi D.R. Meier R. Fernandez A. Lamb N.J. Frech M. Cron P. Cohen P. Lucocq J.M. Hemmings B.A. J.

One of the best characterized PI3-K effectors is Akt (also known as protein kinase B or RAC-PK), a serine/threonine protein kinase. Akt is a cytosolic protein whose translocation is induced by the binding to PI3-K products via the pleckstrin homology domain of Akt. Once Akt translocates to the cell membrane, 3-phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase-1 phosphorylates Akt on threonine residue 308 and serine residue 473 and induces Akt kinase activity (23Franke T.F. Cantley L.C. Nature. 1997; 390: 116-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Activated Akt can then disengage from the membrane and interact with intracellular signaling elements to promote cell survival (26Scheid M.P. Woodgett J.R. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell.

The present study focuses on the investigation of the IGTP role in the inhibition of CVB3-induced apoptosis using Dox-inducible Tet-On HeLa cell line overexpressing IGTP. Our findings suggest that IGTP is a pro-survival factor, and it functions through the activation of the PI3-K/Akt/GSK-3, suppression of caspase-9 and caspase-3, and inhibition of viral protein synthesis. Cells, Virus, Antibodies, Reagents, and Enzymes—CVB3 was routinely propagated in HeLa cells (ATCC). The virus supernatant was obtained by three cycles of freeze-thaw and centrifugation to remove cell debris and stored at –80 °C. Virus titers were determined by plaque assay prior to infection as described previously (11Yang D. Yu J. Luo Z. Carthy C.M. Wilson J.E. Liu Z. McManus B.M. Circ. Res. 1999; 84: 704-712Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Tet-On HeLa cells (Clontech) were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 100 μg/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 2 mm glutamine, 1 mm HEPS buffer, and 10% Clontech approved fetal bovine serum specially prepared for Tet-On system. Antibodies against phosphorylated Akt (p-Akt), total Akt, phosphorylated ERK (p-ERK), and total ERK, Akt non-radioactive immunoprecipitation-kinase assay kit as well as the PI3-K inhibitor LY294002 were purchased from Cell Signaling. Goat anti-mouse IgG antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase was purchased from BD Biosciences, and goat anti-rabbit IgG horseradish peroxidase conjugate was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Anti-Myc tag rabbit polyclonal IgG, anti-phospho-Bad (Ser-136), and the Akt constructs containing a Myc-His tag at the 3′ end of its open reading frame were purchased from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. The dominant negative Akt (DN/Akt) contains a substitution of methionine for lysine at residue 179 of the Akt1 open reading frame. The constitutively activated Akt construct (CA/Akt) contains amino acids 1–11 from avian c-src at the 5′ end of the Akt1 open reading frame. Other antibodies and reagents were described previously (33Zhang H.M. Yanagawa B. Cheung P. Luo H. Yuan J. Chau D. Wang A. Bohunek L. Wilson J.E. McManus B.M. Yang D. Circ. Res. 2002; 90: 1251-1258Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Construction of pTRE/IGTP Expression Plasmid—cDNA clone of mouse IGTP (pcDNA3/IGTP, a generous gift from Dr. Gregory A. Taylor) was digested with MluI and NotI to isolate the IGTP fragment containing the entire open reading frame. The DNA fragment was ligated with the plasmid vector pTRE (Clontech) pre-linearized with MluI and NotI at the multiple clone site. The recombinant expression plasmid was checked for correct size and orientation of the IGTP gene insertion by restriction enzyme digestion and agarose gel electrophoresis. Establishment of the Double-stable Tet-On/IGTP HeLa Cell Line— Tet-On HeLa cells were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% Clontech fetal bovine serum and 100 μg/ml G418. The double-stable Tet-On/IGTP cell line, which can grow well in the presence of both G418 and hygromycin, was established by plasmid transfection as per the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen). Briefly, 105 HeLa Tet-On cells were co-transfected with 2.5 μg of pTRE/IGTP and 125 ng of pTK-Hyg plasmid encoding the hygromycin-resistant gene by the LipofectAMINE method. After treatment with 4 μg of LipofectAMINE and plasmids for 8 h, the mixture was replaced with DMEM supplemented with 10% serum, and incubation was continued for 2 days before initiating selection. Double-stable cells were selected with hygromycin and G418 at concentrations of 200 and 400 μg/ml, respectively. Double-resistant clones were picked up 3 weeks later and further screened for IGTP protein expression by Western blot using anti-IGTP antibody (BD Biosciences). Cell lines transfected with empty vectors, pTRE and pTK-Hyg, were also screened by hygromycin and G418 in parallel to be used as a control in later experiments. To induce the expression of IGTP, cells were cultured in medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum and 1 μg/ml of doxycycline (Dox). Cell cultures prepared for detection of phosphorylation signals were serum-starved overnight before performing the experiments. Western Blot Analysis—Tet-On/IGTP cells were cultured in the presence or absence of Dox and harvested at different time points post-induction. To isolate total protein, cells from a 100-mm dish were washed with cold PBS and resuspended in 700 μl of lysis buffer (0.025 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 137 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm Na3VO4, 2.5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 10 μg/ml aprotinin). After incubation for 20 min on ice, the supernatant was collected by centrifugation at 15,000 rpm for 15 min at 4 °C, and proteins were analyzed by Western blot analysis. Briefly, proteins were separated by 11% SDS-PAGE and transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes. Membranes were blocked with PBS containing 0.1% Tween 20 and 5% non-fat dry milk for at least 1 h at room temperature. Membranes were incubated with primary and secondary antibodies in the above solution on an orbit shaker at 4 °C overnight and at room temperature for 45 min, respectively. Membranes were further developed by the ECL method as per the manufacturer's instructions (Amersham Bioscience). Akt Kinase Assay—Akt kinase assay was conducted using the Akt kinase assay kit (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.) as per the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, Tet-On/IGTP cells or dominant negative Akt plasmid-transfected Tet-On/IGTP cells were serum-starved and induced with Dox for 3 h after pretreatment with or without LY294002. Cells were washed twice with cold PBS and lysed with lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm β-glycerol phosphate, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Total cellular proteins were extracted, and Akt was selectively immunoprecipitated by gentle rocking incubation of the sample with anti-Akt antibodies at 4 °C for 3 h. The pellets were washed twice with 500 μl of lysis buffer and twice with 500 μl of kinase buffer. Kinase reaction was done in 40 μl of kinase buffer containing 200 μm ATP and 1 μg of GSK-3 fusion protein for 30 min at 30 °C. The reaction was stopped by adding 20 μl of SDS loading buffer. Akt kinase activity was determined by Western blot analysis using phospho-GSK3α/β antibody. Cell Viability Assay—To determine the effect of IGTP expression on cell viability, Tet-On/IGTP cells were cultured in the presence or absence of Dox and infected with CVB3. To test whether IGTP-mediated cell survival occurs through the PI3-K/Akt pathway, inhibitor LY294002 was added at a final concentration of 20 μm to treat the cells for 30 min prior to Dox induction at 1 μg/ml and CVB3 infection at multiplicity of infection (m.o.i.) of 10. Cell viability was determined 12 h post-infection using the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium salt (MTS) assay kit (Promega) as per the manufacturer's instructions. The absorbance of formazan was measured at 492 nm using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay plate reader. The quantity of the Formosan product was directly proportional to the number of viable cells in the culture medium. The cell viability of induced and non-induced Tet-On/IGTP cells was determined according to the absorbance corrected to a background reading. Cell viability was expressed relative to the sham-infected Dox-induced and non-induced control cells, respectively. Cell Morphological Observation—The Tet-On/IGTP cells grown in 6-well plates were serum-starved overnight and then divided into five groups. Two groups were treated with PI3-K inhibitor LY294002 for 30 min and then induced or not induced with Dox and infected with CVB3 at an m.o.i. of 10. A third group was not treated with either Dox or LY294002 but infected with CVB3. To confirm that LY294002 itself cannot induce cell death, two additional groups were induced with Dox but pretreated or not pretreated with LY294002. These two groups were sham-infected with PBS. Cell morphological changes were observed by phase contrast microscopy 8 h post-infection. Viral Plaque Assay—The Tet-On/IGTP cells grown in 100-mm dishes at ∼80% confluence were divided into three groups. These three groups of cells were induced or non-induced with Dox or Dox-induced after pretreatment with LY294002 for 30 min. All cells were infected with CVB3 at an m.o.i. of 10. Twenty four hours post-infection, the supernatants from the three groups of cell cultures were used to perform viral plaque assay on HeLa cell monolayers to determine viral titers as described previously (33Zhang H.M. Yanagawa B. Cheung P. Luo H. Yuan J. Chau D. Wang A. Bohunek L. Wilson J.E. McManus B.M. Yang D. Circ. Res. 2002; 90: 1251-1258Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The experiment was repeated three times. IGTP Was Inducibly Expressed in a Tet-On HeLa Cell Line—To study the role of IGTP on CVB3-induced pathogenesis, a double-stable HeLa cell line inducibly overexpressing IGTP was established by co-transfection of Tet-On HeLa cells with pTRE/IGTP and pTK-Hyg. In the selection of transfectants, 105 hygromycin- and G418-resistant colonies were obtained, and 15 positive colonies that inducibly overexpress IGTP upon Dox induction were further confirmed by Western blot analysis using an anti-mouse IGTP antibody. These cells were named Tet-On/IGTP. These clones display highly regulated expression of the IGTP protein as shown in Fig. 1. We chose colony 12 for the subsequent experiments to analyze the function of IGTP in regulating CVB3-induced cell survival and death. IGTP Expression Induces Specific Akt Phosphorylation—Our preliminary experiments done in the present work have shown that IGTP overexpression inhibits CVB3-induced activation of pro-caspase-3. This implies that IGTP expression may be involved in promoting cell survival during CVB3-induced apoptosis. As the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and the PI3-K/Akt pathways are well studied major cell survival mechanisms, we focused our investigation on the role of IGTP expression in these two pathways. Tet-On/IGTP and control cells were induced by Dox at 1 μg/ml for IGTP overexpression and harvested at the indicated time points. Immunoblotting for phospho-ERK and phospho-Akt was conducted using antibodies specific for ERK44/42 phosphorylation and Akt phosphorylation (serine 473), respectively. The data demonstrated that IGTP expression only induced modest and transient ERK phosphorylation. As shown in Fig. 2A, expression of phosphorylated ERK was triggered 30 min post-Dox induction and then rapidly decreased to basal levels. In contrast, IGTP expression induced strong and sustained Akt phosphorylation as early as 30 min and was maintained up to 9 h post-induction. To verify equal loading, the membrane was stripped and re-probed for total ERK or total Akt, respectively, which detects ERK or Akt independent of their phosphorylation states. In order to determine whether Akt phosphorylation was affected by other proteins presented in the media during Dox induction, vector-alone transfected cells were induced with Dox, and Western blot analyses were performed by probing the membrane sequentially with antibody to p-Akt and to Akt. No apparent increase in Akt phosphorylation was observed as compared with basal levels (Fig. 2). This suggests that Akt phosphorylation is IGTP-dependent. To determine further whether the Akt has kinase activity, Akt kinase activity assay was performed using nonradioactive immunoprecipitation kinase assay kit to measure the phosphorylation of GSK-3 which is catalyzed by p-Akt. As shown in Fig. 2B, upper panel, the only sample that was induced with Dox for 3 h but not treated with LY294002 and not transfected with DN/Akt construct (lane 6) shows strong Akt kinase activity as compared with the negative and positive controls, which are not induced with Dox (lane 3) and grown in the presence of the serum and treated with Dox (lane 7), respectively. This suggests that the IGTP-induced p-Akt has kinase activity. IGTP-induced Akt Phosphorylation Occurs through the PI3-K Signal Pathway and Promotes Cell Survival—To determine whether IGTP-induced Akt phosphorylation is catalyzed by PI3-kinase, Tet-On/IGTP cells were preincubated in medium containing different concentrations of LY294002 for 30 min followed by (i) Dox induction, and (ii) Dox induction followed by CVB3 infection. Western blot analyses were performed for detection of p-Akt upon Dox induction. As shown in Fig. 3A, Akt phosphorylation was diminished by the addition of LY294002 to the culture medium in a concentration-dependent manner. Five or 10 μm LY294002 partially inhibited IGTP-induced phosphorylation of Akt, whereas 20 μm LY294002 almost completely restored Akt phosphorylation to the basal level, indicating that IGTP-induced phosphorylation of Akt occurs through the PI3-kinase pathway. This concentration was used for subsequent experiments. To determine IGTP expression on cell viability, Tet-On/IGTP cells were treated or non-treated with LY294002 inhibitor and then incubated in the presence and absence of Dox for 3 h before CVB3 infection. Cell viability was determined by the MTS assay 12 h post-CVB3 infection. Fig. 3B shows a concentration-dependent inhibition of IGTP-mediated cell survival by LY294002. When cells were exposed to 10 μm LY294002, the cell viability was partially reduced as compared with the culture in the absence of inhibitor, whereas with 20 μm LY294002 in the medium, cell viability was totally restored to levels when Dox was absent in the medium. This was further confirmed by morphological assessment on five cell cultures infected or not infected with CVB3. As shown in Fig. 3C, in the first three CVB3-infected cultures, the IGTP ce"

LX3 (PalI, EC 5.4.99.11) catalyzes the isomerization of sucrose to produce isomaltulose (α-d-glucosylpyranosyl-1,6-d-fructofuranose) and trehalulose (α-d-glucosylpyranosyl-1,1-d-fructofuranose). The PalI structure, solved at 2.2-Å resolution with an R-factor of 19.4% and R free of 24.2%, consists of three domains: an N-terminal catalytic (β/α)8 domain, a subdomain between Nβ3 and Nα3, and a C-terminal domain having seven β-strands. The active site architecture of PalI is identical to that of other glycoside hydrolase family 13 members, suggesting a similar mechanism in substrate binding and hydrolysis. However, a unique RLDRD motif in the proximity of the active site has been identified and shown biochemically to be responsible for sucrose isomerization. A two-step reaction mechanism for hydrolysis and isomerization, which occurs in the same pocket is proposed based on both the structural and biochemical data.

Isomaltulose synthase (PalI), also known as sucrose isomerase (EC 5.4.99.11), catalyzes the isomerization of sucrose to produce isomaltulose (α-d-glucosylpyranosyl-1,6-d-fructofuranose) and trehalulose (α-d-glucosylpyranosyl-1,1-d-fructofuranose) as the main products with residual amounts of glucose and fructose (1Huang J.H.

Isomaltulose and trehalulose, two functional isomers of sucrose, have been suggested as non-cariogenic alternatives to sucrose and are widely used in health products and the food industry (3Baer A. Wiss. Technol. 1989; 22: 46-53Google Scholar). The isomaltulose synthase activity has been reported in a range of bacterial species (1Huang J.H. Hsu L.H. Su Y.C. J. Ind. Microbiol.

The ratio of the enzyme products varies, from mainly isomaltulose (75–85%) to predominantly trehalulose (∼90%), depending on the bacterial strain (1Huang J.H. Hsu L.H. Su Y.C. J. Ind. Microbiol.

The molecular mechanism of isomaltulose synthase that controls sucrose isomerization has not been fully characterized, except the recent prediction by Veronese and Perlot (2Veronese T. Perlot P. Enzyme Microb. Technol. 1999; 24: 263-269Crossref Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 8Veronese T. Perlot P. FEBS Lett. 1998; 441: 348-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), in which sucrose binding, hydrolysis, and isomerization depend on the charges provided by residues in a closed shell. To understand the mechanism of sucrose isomerization at the molecular level and identify the key amino acids involved in the enzyme reaction, we recently cloned the palI gene encoding isomaltulose synthase (PalI) from the bacterial isolate Klebsiella sp. LX3 (6Zhang D.H. Li X.Z. Zhang L.H. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2002; 68: 2676-2682Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Sequence alignment and secondary structure prediction revealed that PalI is a novel member of glycoside hydrolase family 13. Family 13 contains enzymes that act on starch such as α-amylase and cyclodextrin glycosyltransferase (CGTase) as well as enzymes specific for the cleavage of other glycosidic linkage such as α-1,6- and α-1,1-bonds (9Davies G. Henrissat B. Structure. 1995; 3: 853-859Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1579) Google Scholar). The basic structural characteristics of this family of enzymes is that the catalytic core domain contains a (β/α)8-fold. The potential catalytic triad (Asp241, Glu295, and Asp369) and two histidine residues (His145 and His368) in PalI are highly conserved in α-amylase and glycosyltransferase (6Zhang D.H. Li X.Z. Zhang L.H. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2002; 68: 2676-2682Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). These residues, as found in oligo-1,6-glucosidase from Bacillus cereus (Asp199, Glu255, Asp329, His103, and His328) (10Watanabe K. Hata Y. Kizaki H. Katsube Y. Suzuki Y. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 269: 142-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar) and in amylosucrase from Neisseria polysacchareais (Asp286, Glu328, Asp393, His187, and His392) (11Skov L.K. Mirza O. Henriksen A. de Montalk G.P. Remaud-Simeon M. Sarcabal P. Willemot R.M. Monsan P. Gajhede M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 25273-25278Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar), form a catalytic pocket that binds the substrate and hydrolyzes the glycosidic bond. The similarity of the active site architecture strongly suggests that PalI adopts the same molecular mechanism for hydrolysis of the glycosidic bond and formation of the glucosyl-enzyme complex. The reaction mechanism occurs via a general acid catalysis, as do those of all glucoside hydrolases (12Koshland D.E. Biol. Rev. Camb. Philos. Soc. 1953; 28: 416-436Crossref Scopus (794) Google Scholar). In addition, PalI adopts the same mechanistic scheme in the formation of enzyme-substrate intermediate. As shown in Scheme 2, the glycosidic bond is protonated by a proton donor and the anomeric carbon of the glucose moiety is attacked by the nucleophilic acid, simultaneously, leading to the formation of the covalently linked enzyme-substrate intermediate. The glucosyl moiety can be transferred to a water molecule for hydrolysis and to the fructose moiety for sucrose isomers synthesis. In the isomerization step, the structure of fructose determines the balance in the formation of two sucrose isomers, isomaltulose and trehalulose (8Veronese T. Perlot P. FEBS Lett. 1998; 441: 348-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). To understand the specific structural features required for isomerization in PalI, the PalI protein was overexpressed, purified, and crystallized (13Li N. Zhang D.H. Zhang L.H. Swaminathan K.

Here we describe, at 2.2-Å resolution, the crystal structure of PalI and the potential function of an RLDRD motif, at the structural level, in determining the mechanism of sucrose hydrolysis and isomerization. The function of the C-terminal domain in the enzymatic activity is also reported. Based on these data, we present a mechanism to explain the sucrose isomerization process. We believe this paper is the first structure-function report on PalI, a sucrose isomerase that converts sucrose to isomaltulose and trehalulose simultaneously. Strains, Plasmids, and Site-directed Mutagenesis—Escherichia coli DH5α were used as host cells for plasmid propagation and protein overexpression. Site-directed mutation of palI was performed by using the QuikChange™ site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). The double-stranded DNA vector pGEK (6Zhang D.H. Li X.Z. Zhang L.H. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2002; 68: 2676-2682Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) was used as the template, and two synthetic oligonucleotides containing the desired mutation were used as primers. Five mutants, PalI:D241A, PalI:E295A, PalI:D369A, PalI: H145A, and PalI:H368A, were created in which the indicated residues were replaced by Ala. For the C-terminal deletion mutants PalI:Δ587, PalI:Δ572 and PalI:Δ545, a stop codon was separately introduced after the indicated amino acid positions. All point mutations (Table I) were confirmed by DNA sequencing, using the dideoxy chain termination procedure. The digestion of DNA with restriction endonucleases, agarose gel electrophoresis, and transformation of E. coli DH5α were carried out according to standard procedures.Table ISpecific activity of PalI mutantsProteinDescriptionSpecific activityunits/mgPalINative protein330.5 ± 2.56PalI:H145AHis145 replaced by Ala2.15 ± 0.28PalI:H368AHis368 replaced by Ala8.85 ± 0.65PalI:D241AAsp241 replaced by Ala0.66 ± 0.44PalI:E295AGlu295 replaced by Ala0PalI:D369AAsp369 replaced by Ala4.1 ± 0.21C-terminal deletionPalI:Δ587C termini after Leu587 deleted305.05 ± 3.45PalI:Δ572C termini after Asp572 deleted32.95 ± 1.71PalI:Δ545C termini after Tyr545 deleted0Enzyme activity (units/mg) was assayed as described previously (6Zhang D.H.

One unit of enzyme is defined as the amount of protein that form 1 μmol of reducing sugar (with isomaltulose as standard) per min under the conditions specified. Enzyme Purification and Assays—Overexpression and purification of enzymes (PalI and its mutant versions) were carried out as described previously (6Zhang D.H. Li X.Z. Zhang L.H. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2002; 68: 2676-2682Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Further purification was performed by gel filtration chromatography with a HiPrep Sephacryl S-200, 16/60 column (Amersham Biosciences) at a flow rate of 0.5 ml min–1 with a buffer of 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, and 1 mm dithiothreitol. The purified enzymes were further examined by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide (10%) gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). The enzyme activity was assayed as described previously (6Zhang D.H. Li X.Z. Zhang L.H. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2002; 68: 2676-2682Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). One unit of enzyme is defined as the amount of enzyme required to catalyze the formation of 1 μmol of isomaltulose in 1 min under assay conditions. The data presented are the means of three individual experiments. Crystallization and Data Collection—Crystallization of wild type PalI (residues 29–598) was performed as described by Li et al. (13Li N. Zhang D.H. Zhang L.H. Swaminathan K. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2003; 59: 150-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar), using the hanging drop vapor diffusion method at 22 °C. Crystals that were 1.2 mm in length were cut to an optimum size, treated with a cryo-protectant (reservoir solution with 4% increased precipitant and supplemented with 10% glycerol) for 3 min, and flash-cooled in liquid nitrogen. The diffraction data were collected at Spring8, Japan (beam-line BL40B2, ADSC Quantum4 CCD detector, –173 °C). The data were indexed, processed, and scaled using the programs DENZO and SCALEPACK (14Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref Scopus (38253) Google Scholar). Structure Determination and Refinement—The primary amino acid sequence of PalI shows 47% identity and 65% similarity to that of oligo-1,6-glucosidase (6Zhang D.H. Li X.Z. Zhang L.H. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2002; 68: 2676-2682Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Moreover, these two proteins have the highest structural similarity using the DALI server (15Holm L. Sander C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 478-480Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1268) Google Scholar). Consequently, the structure of PalI was determined by the method of molecular replacement by the MOLREP program (16Collaborative Computing Project Number 4Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19668) Google Scholar) using oligo-1,6-glucosidase as the search model. The asymmetric unit contains one protein molecule. The resulting electron density map was solvent flattened using PHASES (17Furey W. Swaminathan S. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 277: 590-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar) and model building was carried out with the help of O (18Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (12999) Google Scholar). Electron density for the first 15 N-terminal amino acids was not observed in the map. The structure was refined with the CNS program suite (19Brünger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. Gros W.L. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol.

Overall Structure—As shown in Fig. 1A, the PalI molecule consists of three domains: the N-terminal catalytic (β/α)8 domain (residues 43–146 and 216–521, colored blue), a subdomain (residues 147–215, magenta), and the C-terminal domain (residues 522–598, red), as reported for oligo-1,6-glucosidase (Fig. 1B) and amylosucrase (Fig. 1C). The (β/α)8 domain, as the main body of the structure, is sandwiched between the subdomain and C-terminal domain. It consists of the well characterized (β/α)8 barrel with eight alternating β-strands (Nβ1–Nβ8) and α-helices (Nα1–Nα8). This domain contains the residues involved in catalysis and substrate-binding. The cavity contains the acidic residues (Asp241, Glu295, and Asp369: PalI numbering) that are highly conserved in members of α-amylase family 13. The active site is shown in Fig. 2A as an example of the quality of the 2Fo – Fc electron density. This active site cleft is surrounded by a loop (residues 321–340), forming a pocket with the dimensions of 20 × 20 × 25 Å, large enough to accommodate a sucrose molecule. The overall surface around the active site pocket of PalI is highly negatively charged (data not shown). This highly negative character of the (β/α)8 barrel domain is important for sugar-protein interactions. The subdomain, which is inserted between Nβ3 and Nα3, consists of two α-helices and three anti-parallel β-strands (Fig. 1A) and has no known function either in PalI or in other family 13 members. Only one strong salt bridge (Lys248Nζ... Asp211Oδ2 with a distance of 2.6 Å) connects the subdomain and the N-terminal domain. The C-terminal domain is made of two antiparallel β-sheets. Five β-strands (Cβ1, Cβ2, Cβ3, Cβ5, and Cβ7) form the larger β-sheet, and two strands (Cβ4 and Cβ6) form the smaller one. The six loop segments that are present between the pairs of adjacent β-strands in the C-terminal domain are named as Clp1–Clp6, respectively. A network of salt bridges and hydrogen bonds between the two C-terminal β-sheets as well as the N- and C-terminal domains ensure the conformational stability of the structure in general and the active pocket in particular.Fig. 2Catalytic pocket, isomerization region, and N-C termini interactions in Pal I. A, the 2Fo – Fc electron density map at the catalytic pocket is drawn at the 2.5 σ level. The five conserved residues that participate in substrate binding and hydrolysis are labeled in green, and the five residues that are involved in the isomerization of sucrose are labeled in red. B, the superimposition of PalI on the amylosucrase-sucrose complex based on the atoms of the five conserved hydrolysis residues. PalI is blue, amylosucrase is gray, and sucrose is magenta. The residues in amylosucrase that interact with sucrose and their corresponding residues in PalI are shown. Note the deviation of the helix from the substrate in amylosucrase and the approach of the substrate by the RLDRD motif residues in PalI. Arg333 of PalI occupies the position of Arg446 in amylosucrase. C, the N- and C-terminal interactions. Hydrogen bonds are represented by dashed lines. The truncation positions of the mutants PalI:Δ587, PalI:Δ572, and PalI:Δ545 are indicated by the symbol ×. For clarity, only the residues that form important salt bridges and hydrogen bonds that are disrupted by the truncations are shown.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Active Site Architecture—Structural alignment results from the DALI server (15Holm L. Sander C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 478-480Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1268) Google Scholar) show that the tertiary structures of PalI and oligo-1,6-glucosidase can be aligned in four parts (residues 43–257, 260–381, 383–566, and 576–598) with 46.4% sequence identity. A total of 544 Cα atoms could be superimposed with root mean square deviations in the range 0.46–1.69 Å. The alignment between PalI and amylosucrase is very poor, resulting in several shorter fragments. However, superimposition of the five conserved amino acids (His141, Asp241, Glu295, Asp369, and His368 in PalI) in the substrate-binding pocket of PalI, oligo-1,6-glucosidase, and amylosucrase (Fig. 2B; oligo-1,6-glucosidase data not shown) shows a high degree of structural similarity of the active site architecture with a root mean square deviation of 0.41 Å between PalI and oligo-1,6-glucosidase and 0.89 Å between PalI and amylosucrase. To verify the importance of these conserved residues, the five residues (His141, Asp241, Glu295, Asp369, and His368) were replaced individually by Ala, and the created mutant PalI proteins were purified (Table I). With the specific activity of the wild type enzyme (335.3 units mg–1) defined as 100%, the remaining activity of the mutants PalI:D241A, PalI:E295A, PalI:D369A, PalI:H145A, and PalI:H368A is only 0.2, 0, 1.23, 0.65, and 2.68% of the native PalI, respectively, strongly suggesting that these conserved residues are essential for PalI activity. The substrate recognition scheme and binding sites have been identified in CGTase (23Uitdehaag J.C.M. Mosi R. Kalk K.H. van der Veen B.A. Dijkhuizen L. Withers S.G. Dijkstra B.W. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 432-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar), TAKA-amylase with substrate analogs (24Brzozowski A.M. Davies G.J. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 10837-10845Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar), amylosucrase with d-glucose, and mutated amylosucrase with sucrose (25Mirza O. Skov L.K. Remaud-Simeon M. de Montalk G.P. Albenne C. Monsan P. Gajhede M. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 9032-9039Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 26Skov L.K. Mirza O. Sprogoe D. Dar I. Remaud-Simeon M. Albenne C. Monsan P. Gajhede M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 47741-47747Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Structural comparison of PalI with amylosucrase is of particular interest as these two enzymes use sucrose as their sole substrate. The superimposition of the structure of PalI with the complex of amylosucrase and sucrose (Fig. 2B) clearly indicates that the active site pocket in PalI is closely similar with that of amylosucrase and also suitable for containing one sucrose molecule. In PalI, Glu295 (equivalent to Glu328 in amylosucrase) acts as the general acid catalyst to protonate the oxygen of the glycosidic linkage for substrate hydrolysis; Asp241 (Asp286 in amylosucrase), the attacking nucleophile, forms a bond with C1 to form β-glucosylenzyme intermediate, whereas Asp369 (Asp393 in amylosucrase) forms hydrogen bonds to O2 and O3. Arg239 in PalI forms a salt bridge to Oδ1 of Asp241, which is essential for the correct positioning of the nucleophile. Similarly, His145 forms a hydrogen bond to O6 and His368 to O2, as is the case for the equivalent residues His187 and His392 in amylosucrase (11Skov L.K. Mirza O. Henriksen A. de Montalk G.P.

Remaud-Simeon M. de Montalk G.P. Albenne C. Monsan P. Gajhede M. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 9032-9039Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). In addition, a salt bridge between Asp102 and Arg456 is formed in PalI. The equivalent salt bridges between Asp144 and Arg509 in amylosucrase (25Mirza O. Skov L.K. Remaud-Simeon M. de Montalk G.P. Albenne C. Monsan P. Gajhede M. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 9032-9039Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) and Asp60 and Arg415 in oligo-1,6-glucosidase (10Watanabe K. Hata Y. Kizaki H. Katsube Y. Suzuki Y. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 269: 142-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar) have been reported. One notable feature in amylosucrase, when compared with TAKA-amylase, is that the +1 subsite is modified from Lys to Ala289 (amylosucrase numbering), providing the specificity of amylosucrase for the furanosyl ring of sucrose (11Skov L.K. Mirza O. Henriksen A. de Montalk G.P. Remaud-Simeon M. Sarcabal P. Willemot R.M. Monsan P. Gajhede M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 25273-25278Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). The residues in PalI at the equivalent positions follow those of amylosucrase, mainly with Ala244, implying similar modifications of PalI at the +1 subsite to accommodate sucrose as the major substrate. Evidently, PalI adopts a mechanism similar to that in amylosucrase for sucrose binding, hydrolysis, and formation of covalent intermediate. A Motif Influencing Sucrose Isomerization—The hydrolysis of sucrose by PalI constitutes only a minor part of the reactions mediating the synthesis of sucrose isoforms (6Zhang D.H. Li X.Z. Zhang L.H. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2002; 68: 2676-2682Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Amylosucrase catalyzes the transfer of a d-glucopyranosyl moiety in the active site cleft to an acceptor molecule in a ravine formed by its domain B′ that plays the pivotal role in transferase reaction (11Skov L.K. Mirza O. Henriksen A. de Montalk G.P. Remaud-Simeon M. Sarcabal P. Willemot R.M. Monsan P. Gajhede M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 25273-25278Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 26Skov L.K. Mirza O. Sprogoe D. Dar I. Remaud-Simeon M. Albenne C. Monsan P. Gajhede M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 47741-47747Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). In PalI, however, breakage of α-1,2-linkage in sucrose and formation of α-1,6- and α-1,1-linkages occur in the same pocket. To elucidate the mechanism of isomerization of PalI, the crucial structural features that interact with fructofuranose at the active site cleft and determine the change of fructofuranose to fructopyranose must be determined. This is because the conversion of fructofuranose to fructopyranose is the key step for trehalulose formation (8Veronese T. Perlot P. FEBS Lett. 1998; 441: 348-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Two residues in amylosucrase, Asp394 and Arg446, directly interact with the fructosyl ring of sucrose through hydrogen bonds (25Mirza O. Skov L.K. Remaud-Simeon M. de Montalk G.P. Albenne C. Monsan P. Gajhede M. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 9032-9039Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The equivalent residues in PalI are Asn370 and Arg333, respectively. Amylosucrase and oligo-1,6-glucosidase significantly differ from PalI in that PalI contains a flexible loop region from Phe321 to Ser340 against a more rigid α-helical structure in oligo-1,6-glucosidase and amylosucrase (Fig. 2B). The unique 325RLDRD329 sequence of PalI is located in this loop adjacent to the active site cleft (Fig. 2, A and B). Not surprisingly, the RLDRD motif is not present in oligo-1,6-glucosidase and amylosucrase, as these two enzymes are functionally different from PalI. Notably, all known isomaltulose synthases contain the RLDRD sequence at equivalent regions (5Mattes R. Klein K. Schiwech H. Kunz M. Munir M. U. S. Patent 5. 1998; 786: 140Google Scholar, 27Bornke F. Hajirezaei M. Sonnewwald U. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 2425-2430Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). This specific region has also been identified by sequence alignment (28Zhang D.H. Li N. Swaminathan K. Zhang L.H. FEBS Lett. 2003; 534: 151-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The crystal structural analysis further indicates its unique location and possible interactions with the substrate. The role of the charged residues in this motif was investigated by creating the mutant versions of PalI and analyzing the relative amount of glucose, fructose, isomaltulose, and trehalulose synthesized (28Zhang D.H. Li N. Swaminathan K. Zhang L.H. FEBS Lett. 2003; 534: 151-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The isomaltulose content is decreased and the trehalulose content is increased in all of the PalI mutants, compared with the native PalI. However, mutation of Asp327, Arg328, and Asp329 did not significantly affect the ratio of sucrose hydrolysis to sucrose isomerization activity (≅0.06), but resulted in a 13–25-fold increase in trehalulose production. Only the mutation of residue Arg325 enhanced both sucrose hydrolysis and trehalulose formation. Evidently, the charge distributions in the isomaltulose synthase motif influence the stability of glucose and fructose binding to the enzyme and α-1,1- and α-1,6-glucosidic bond formation. As such, the unique location of the 325RLDRD329 motif highlights its importance in the isomerization process and therefore in the control of PalI product specificity. Mechanistic Implication of Sucrose Isomerization—Comparison of PalI with the amylosucrase-sucrose complex structure should reveal the mechanism of interactions between the side chains of active site residues and the glucosyl or the fructosyl moiety. In PalI, as shown in Scheme 2, A, Glu295 interacts with a bound sucrose molecule by protonating the glycosidic bond. It, therefore, serves to activate Asp241 to nucleophilically attack C1 to form the β-glucosyl-enzyme intermediate, as described for other members of glycosyl hydrolase family 13 (9Davies G. Henrissat B. Structure. 1995; 3: 853-859Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1579) Google Scholar, 10Watanabe K. Hata Y. Kizaki H. Katsube Y. Suzuki Y. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 269: 142-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar, 11Skov L.K. Mirza O. Henriksen A. de Montalk G.P. Remaud-Simeon M. Sarcabal P. Willemot R.M. Monsan P. Gajhede M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 25273-25278Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). The residues that most probably interact with glucosyl moiety at –1 subsite include the conserved active residues, Asp369, Arg239, His145, and His368 and the salt bridge residues, Asp102 and Arg456. These remote glucose-binding subsites may prevent the release of glucose and thus confer less hydrolase activity on PalI. The mechanism of sucrose isomerization is speculative, although the biochemical functions of the motif 325RLDRD329 provide molecular evidence that the isomerization of sucrose is controlled by the charged residues in the proximity of the active site cleft. Based on our data, we propose that enzyme-bound sucrose interacts with the conserved residues of the active site and the isomaltulose synthase motif. The fructofuranose conformation of the fructose moiety is tightly preserved by the charged residues of the RLDRD motif so that isomaltulose is the main isomer synthesized (Scheme 2, B). Disruption of the charge distribution balance by mutations of the 325RLDRD329 motif or the pH changes enhances the tautomerization of fructofuranose to fructopyranose (6Zhang D.H. Li X.Z. Zhang L.H. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2002; 68: 2676-2682Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), thereby forming the sucrose isomer, trehalulose (Scheme 2, C). Molecular dynamics analysis suggests that the fructose moiety bound to the mutant enzyme displays variable conformation (29Immel S. Lichtenthaler F.W. Liebigs Ann. 1995; : 1925-1937Crossref Scopus (84) Google Scholar). This electrostatic shift in the active site pocket also appears to cause the movement of 6′-OH group toward C2′ to form fructopyranose as well as the rotation of the C1′-OH toward C1 of glucosyl ring. Although direct evidence for the proposed mechanism is not yet available, further structural studies of PalI-substrate complex would allow us to present a complete isomerization scheme. C-terminal Domain—The C-terminal domain of PalI interacts with the N-terminal domain by forming salt bridges and hydrogen bonds (Fig. 2C). All hydrogen bonds between the two domains are clustered in two regions. In the first region, residues of Nα6 and the loops formed by residues 398–401 and 515–521 in the N-terminal domain make hydrogen bonds with residues in Cβ1-Clp1-Cβ2 segment. The second region involves residues 379–384 and 497–501 in the N-terminal domain and Clp3 and Clp5 in the C-terminal domain. An interdomain salt bridge (Arg381Nη2... Glu553Oϵ1), which is not present in oligo-1,6-glucosidase (10Watanabe K. Hata Y. Kizaki H. Katsube Y. Suzuki Y. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 269: 142-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar), connects Clp3 in the C-terminal domain and the loop after the active site in the N-terminal domain (Fig. 2C). To understand the influence of the C-terminal domain on PalI functions, we have constructed three C-terminal deletion mutants, PalI:Δ587, PalI:Δ572, and PalI:Δ545, which are truncated after the indicated residue. The truncated PalI mutants were overexpressed, purified, and the remaining activity has been assayed. As shown in Table I, the mutant PalI:Δ587, created by the deletion of Clp6 and Cβ7, reduces the enzyme activity to 92.3% of the native PalI. Further deletion of Cβ5 and C1p5 in PalI:Δ572 leads to about 90% loss of activity, and deletion of Cβ3-Cβ7 in PalI:Δ545 completely abolishes the enzyme activity. C-terminal deletions interrupt the interdomain interactions and may cause significant changes in the structure of the N-terminal domain. The preceding discussion is based on the comparison of the PalI structure with oligo-1,6-glucosidase and amylosucrase, together with biochemical analysis of a series of mutant PalI proteins. The unique RLDRD motif in the loop region participates in sucrose isomerization and thus influences product specificity.

https://openalex.org/W2054049929,"To elucidate the role of extracellular histidines in the modulation of the rat P2X4 receptor by trace metals, we generated single, double, and triple histidine mutants for residues 140, 241, and 286, replacing them with alanines. cDNAs for the wild-type and receptor mutants were expressed in Xenopus laevis oocytes and in human embryonic kidney 293 cells and examined by the two electrode and patch clamp techniques, respectively. Whereas copper inhibited concentration-dependently the ATP-gated currents in the wild-type and in the single or double H241A and H286A receptor mutants, all receptors containing H140A were insensitive to copper in both cell systems. The characteristic bell-shaped concentration-response curve of zinc observed in the wild-type receptor became sigmoid in both oocytes and human embryonic kidney cells expressing the H140A mutant; in these mutants, the zinc potentiation was 2.5–4-fold larger than in the wild-type. Results with the H140T and H140R mutants further support the importance of a histidine residue at this position. We conclude that His-140 is critical for the action of copper, indicating that this histidine residue, but not His-241 or His-286, forms part of the inhibitory allosteric metal-binding site of the P2X4 receptor, which is distinct from the putative zinc facilitator binding site.

The notion that trace metals such as zinc or copper are atypical brain messengers has attracted much attention in view of their emerging role in the modulation of brain excitability (1Barañano D.E. Ferris C.D. Snyder S.H. Trends Neurosci. 2001; 24: 99-106Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). The importance of trace metals in synaptic activity is highlighted by the description that both copper and zinc are stored in synaptic vesicles from where they are released by electrical depolarization, reaching a high micromolar concentration at the synaptic cleft (2Assaf S. Chung S.H. Nature. 1984; 208: 734-736Crossref Scopus (1028) Google Scholar, 3Howell G.A. Welch M.G. Fredericksson C.J. Nature. 1984; 208: 737-738Google Scholar, 4Kardos J. Kovacs I. Hajos F. Kalman M. Simonyi M. Neurosci. Lett. 1989; 103: 139-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). Trace metals are known to modulate a wide variety of brain ionotropic receptors such as glycine, N-methyl-d-aspartate, γ-aminobutyric acid, nicotinic, and the novel nucleotide receptors (P2X) family (5Bloomenthal A.B.

Miledi R. Eusebi F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 10246-10250Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The P2X purinoceptors are homomeric or heteromeric membrane channels gated by extracellular ATP and related synthetic nucleotides; North (10North R.A. Physiol. Rev. 2002; 82: 1013-1067Crossref PubMed Scopus (2490) Google Scholar) recently reviewed the principles of the molecular physiology of this family of receptors. Within the P2X receptor family, the P2X4 is the most widely distributed in the central nervous system, including the cerebellum and the CA1 region of the hippocampus, where it has been proposed to play a role in glutamatergic synapses (11Rubio M.E. Soto F. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 641-653Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The P2X4 receptor is an interesting model of an ionic channel differentially modulated by trace metals. Acuña-Castillo et al. (12Acuña-Castillo C. Morales B. Huidobro-Toro J.P. J. Neurochem. 2000; 74: 1529-1537Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) and Coddou et al. (13Coddou C. Villalobos C. González J. Acuña-Castillo C. Loeb B. Huidobro-Toro J.P. J. Neurochem. 2002; 80: 626-633Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) reported that zinc potentiates the ATP-evoked currents whereas copper has an inhibitory effect on the activity of this receptor. Based on these findings, Acuña-Castillo et al. (12Acuña-Castillo C. Morales B. Huidobro-Toro J.P. J. Neurochem. 2000; 74: 1529-1537Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) proposed that trace metals modulate the activity of the P2X4 receptor via two separate metal-binding sites. One of these sites has a preferential selectivity for copper and is characterized by a non-competitive inhibition of the ATP-gated channel activity. The second site shows preference for zinc and apparently leads to an increase in affinity for the binding of ATP. Copper and zinc also modulate other members of the P2X family of receptors, but their effects depend on the receptor subtype. For example, both zinc and copper facilitate the ATP-evoked responses on the P2X2 receptor (14Xiong K. Peoples R.W. Montgomery J.P. Chiang Y. Stewart R.R. Weight F.F. Li C. J. Neurophysiol. 1999; 81: 2088-2094Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 15Lorca R. González J. Huidobro-Toro J.P. Biol. Res. 2001; 34 (Abstr. R-92): 105Google Scholar) whereas in the P2X7 receptor, copper inhibits the ATP-gated currents, whereas zinc is virtually without effect (13Coddou C. Villalobos C. González J. Acuña-Castillo C. Loeb B. Huidobro-Toro J.P. J. Neurochem. 2002; 80: 626-633Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). These findings further support the notion that the P2X purinoceptors may have separate metal-binding sites to modulate the channel activity. This research was aimed at identifying structural determinants for the binding of copper and to assess the hypothesis that copper and zinc bind to separate, independent metal-binding sites in the receptor. Based on the notion that histidine residues are commonly found in consensus copper-binding motifs (16Aitken A. Mol. Biotechnol. 1999; 12: 241-253Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), as extensively studied in superoxide dismutase, where the imidazole ring is essential to coordinate copper (17Richardson J. Thomas K.A. Rubin B.H. Richardson D.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1975; 72: 1349-1353Crossref PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar), and both histidines and cysteines have been defined in zinc-binding motifs (18Vallee B.L. Auld D.S. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 5647-5659Crossref PubMed Scopus (1536) Google Scholar), we were challenged to clarify the role of the three histidines of the rat P2X4 receptor in the modulatory action of trace metals. Interestingly, the three rat P2X4 histidine residues are located extracellularly. To tentatively identify putative residues involved in the copper inhibitory modulation, we preliminarily used chemicals to selectively alkylate histidine and cysteine residues. Next, we performed site-directed mutagenesis to create single, double, and triple mutants where the histidine residues (His-140, His-241, and His-286) of the receptor were replaced by alanines. The cDNAs coding for the wild-type and mutated receptors were expressed in two cell systems; the modulation by copper or zinc was examined in either Xenopus laevis oocytes and HEK 1The abbreviations used are: HEK, human embryonic kidney; DEPC, diethyl pyrocarbonate; NEM, N-ethylmaleimide; EC50, median effective concentration; n H, Hill coefficient; IC50, median inhibitory concentration; Imax, maximal current. 293 cells. The present results allow us to conclude that only His-140 plays a key role in the modulator action of copper, because this particular amino acid cannot be replaced by alanine, threonine, or arginine and still conserve the inhibitory modulation by copper. Materials—ATP trisodium salt and penicillin-streptomycin were purchased from Sigma. Copper and zinc chlorides were obtained from Merck. The salts used to prepare the incubation media were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich or Merck. Diethyl pyrocarbonate (DEPC) and N-ethylmaleimide (NEM) were purchased from Sigma. Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, Opti-MEM, and LipofectAMINE were purchased from Invitrogen. Triple-distilled water with minimal electroconductivity was used; the copper or zinc contamination was less than 0.1 μm. Single Mutations—The rat P2X4 cDNA (GenBank™ accession number NM_031594) was cloned in a pcDNA3 vector (Invitrogen). P2X4 single mutants were generated by PCR using the proof-reading Pfu polymerase (Promega) followed by DpnI digestion of the methylated parental plasmid. Three 27-mer couples of primers were as follows: H140A (forward), 5′-CCGTGGACACCGCCAGCAGTGGAGTTG-3′; H140A (reverse), 5′-CAACTCCACTGCTGGCGGTGTCCACGG-3′; H241A (forward), 5′-GGGGACGCGGGAGCTAGCTTCCAGGAG-3′; H241A (reverse), 5′-CTCCTGGAAGCTAGCTCCCGCGTCCCC-3′; H286A (forward), 5′-CCGGGACCTGGAAGCCAATGTGTCTCC-3′; H286A (reverse), 5′-GGAGACACATTGGCTTCCAGGTCCCGG-3′. The primers were used to generate the H140A, H241A, and H286A single mutant clones, respectively. To circumvent unwanted mutations, a region surrounding the targeted amino acid and presenting unique restriction sites was subcloned in the parental cDNA and then verified by automated sequencing. Double and Triple Histidine Mutants—For the rat P2X4 receptor (GenBank™ accession number NM_031594) double and triple histidine mutants were made using the GeneTailor™ site-directed mutagenesis system (Invitrogen), using the single mutants and a double mutant as template, respectively. Oligonucleotides were designed following the manufacturer's instructions, and the sequences were as follows: H241A (forward), 5′-TCGTGGGGGACGCGGGAGCCAGCTTCCAGG-3′; H241A (reverse), 5′-TCCCGCGTCCCCCACGATTGTGCCAAGACG-3′; H286A (forward), 5′-TGGACACCCGGGACCTGGAAGCCAATGTGTCTCC-3′; H286A (reverse), 5′-TTCCAGGTCCCGGGTGTCCAGGCGCCGGAAGG-3′. Plasmid DNA was isolated using the Qiagen plasmid DNA purification kit according to the manufacturer's instructions. All the mutations were confirmed by sequencing using an Applied Biosystems ABI PRISM 310 DNA sequencer. Substitution of Histidine 140 by Other Amino Acid Residues—The H140T and H140R mutants were made using the overlap extension method (19Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene. 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6851) Google Scholar) with the following oligonucleotides: H140T (forward), 5′-CCGTGGACACCACCAGCAGTGGAGTTGCG-3′; H140T (reverse), 5′-CCAGTCGCAACTCCACTGCTGGTGGTGTCCACGG-3′; H140R (forward), 5′-CCGTGGACACCCGGAGCAGTGGAGTTGCG-3′; H140R (reverse), 5′-CCAGTCGCAACTCCACTGCTCCGGGTGTCCACGG-3′. A segment of the ovary was surgically removed under anesthesia from X. laevis frogs; oocytes were manually defolliculated and next incubated with collagenase as detailed previously (12Acuña-Castillo C. Morales B. Huidobro-Toro J.P. J. Neurochem. 2000; 74: 1529-1537Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Oocytes were injected intranuclearly with 3–5 ng of cDNA coding for either the wild-type or H140A, H241A, and H286A P2X4 receptor proteins. After 36–48 h of incubation at 15 °C in Barth's solution (NaCl, 88 mm; KCl, 1 mm; NaHCO3, 2.4 mm; HEPES, 10 mm; MgSO4, 0.82 mm; Ca(NO3)2, 0.33 mm; CaCl2, 0.91 mm; pH 7.5) containing 10 IU/liter penicillin/10 mg streptomycin and 2 mm pyruvate. Oocytes were clamped at –70 mV using the two-electrode voltage-clamp configuration with an OC-725C clamper (Warner Instruments Corp). ATP-gated currents were recorded following a 15-s ATP application dissolved in the regular perfusion buffer. ATP and metal chloride salts dissolved in Barth's medium were perfused using a peristaltic pump operating at a constant flow of 2 ml/min. Non-injected oocytes did not evoke currents when exogenous ATP was applied. Each experimental protocol was performed in at least two separate batches of oocytes from different frogs; each experiment was replicated in at least four separate oocytes. The relative ATP potency was estimated from single concentration-response curves; the median effective concentration (EC50) and the Hill coefficient (n H) was graphically derived using Graph Pad software. The maximal current (Imax, nanoAmpere) was obtained from each oocyte challenged with a saturating ATP concentration. To ascertain whether certain amino acids are essential for trace metal modulation, we first assessed whether alkylation of histidine residues with DEPC altered the inhibitory action of copper or the facilitator action of zinc. After routine applications of 10 μm ATP and testing of the inhibitory action of 10 μm copper or the facilitator action of 10 μm zinc, oocytes were treated for 5 min with 500 μm DEPC to modify the histidine residues. After this treatment, oocytes were perfused for 20–30 min to wash out the remaining DEPC prior to challenges with ATP or the metals. ATP concentration-response protocols (1–1000 μm) of ATP alone or ATP plus copper (1 min pre-incubated) were performed in separate oocytes. The ATP concentration-response curve was normalized against 500 μm ATP, a value close to the maximal current. The current gated by 500 μm ATP was obtained prior to the treatment with DEPC. Likewise, similar protocols were performed in separate oocytes using 300 μm NEM to selectively alkylate cysteine residues. As in the case of the DEPC-treated oocytes, oocytes were washed for 20–30 min from the residual chemical prior to testing with ATP and the trace metals. Results were normalized, as in the case of the DEPC treatment, against a standard of ATP obtained prior to applying the alkylating agent. To examine the effect of copper, 0.1–600 μm of the metal was pre-applied for 1 min before a 15-s ATP pulse, at a concentration close to the receptor EC50, which in the wild-type receptor was 10 μm ATP. Care was taken to achieve full reversal of the copper effect prior to a larger copper application. The median inhibitory concentration of copper (IC50) was interpolated from each metal concentration-response curve. A single oocyte was tested with at least four increasing concentrations of copper. If the relative potency of ATP was modified in the mutant receptors, the ATP concentration was adjusted to a value close to its EC50;60 μm ATP was used to evaluate the H140A mutant receptor, and 30 μm ATP was used for the His-286 mutant. This protocol was also used to evaluate the potency of copper in the double or triple histidine mutants or the mutants that substituted His-140 by either threonine or arginine. Parallel experiments were performed to assess whether the histidine mutants affected the facilitator action of zinc. In these protocols, the metal was applied 1 min prior to a challenge with 1 μm ATP in the wild-type P2X4 receptor or the H241A mutant. 3 μm ATP was used to evaluate the facilitator action of zinc in the H140A and H286A mutants. These concentrations of ATP were chosen based on previous findings (12Acuña-Castillo C. Morales B. Huidobro-Toro J.P. J. Neurochem. 2000; 74: 1529-1537Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) when we reported that the largest zinc potentiation was attained with low ATP concentrations, which induce 5% of the maximal nucleotide-evoked current (EC5). In all cases, ATP applications were spaced at regular 10-min intervals, minimizing desensitization and after attaining full reversibility of the zinc effect. The effect of zinc in the double or triple mutants was assessed likewise. To study with more detail the mechanism of trace metal modulation, we next assessed the effect of the pre-application of copper or zinc in the ATP concentration-response curves in the wild-type and mutant P2X4 receptors. Protocols were performed applying increasing concentrations of ATP (0.1–3,000 μm) for 15 s. Curves were normalized against 500 μm ATP for the wild-type receptor and H241A mutant receptor and against 1 mm ATP for the H140A and H286A mutants. The ATP EC50 and its Imax were derived from each ATP concentration-response curve. HEK 293 cells were transiently transfected with 1 μg of cDNA coding for the wild-type, H140A, H241A, or H286A P2X4 receptor protein. Cells grown to 50% confluence on 35-mm culture dishes were incubated with cDNA mixed with 8 μl of LipofectAMINE in 1 ml of serum-free medium (Opti-MEM). After 3 h at 37 °C, the medium was replaced with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, and 48 h later the cells were transferred to the experimental chamber containing recording buffer, which contained the following (in mm): 150 NaCl, 1 CaCl2, 1 MgCl2, 10 glucose, 10 HEPES, pH 7.3. Whole-cell ATP-dependent currents were obtained from single HEK 293 cells using an Axopatch 200B amplifier (Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA). Patch pipettes (2–4 megohm) were filled with the following (in mm): 150 CsCl, 10 tetraethyl ammonium chloride, 10 EGTA, 10 HEPES, pH 7.3, and 275–285 mOsm; pH was adjusted with CsOH. The junction potential (typically <5 mV) was compensated. Only cells with membrane potential more negative than –55 mV, access resistance <10 megohm (compensated at 80%), and input resistance >100 megohm were tested. The cells were discarded if the input or access resistance changed >0%. The ATP-dependent currents were recorded at a holding potential of –80 mV to augment the driving force of the ions that mediate the ATP-evoked currents and to avoid contamination of voltage-dependent currents. Responses were digitized at a frequency of 10 KHz and analyzed using the pCLAMP 8 system (Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA). All the experiments were carried out at room temperature. ATP-dependent currents were evoked with 5-s ATP pulses applied by superfusion, using a peristaltic pump (Masterflex Pump; Cole Palmer Instruments). ATP concentration-response protocols were performed to derive the EC50, by applying 0.1 to 500 μm pulses of ATP for 5 s; between ATP applications, the cells were washed for 5 min with drug-free buffer. To minimize desensitization because of the larger concentrations of ATP (30 μm or more), these applications were spaced 10 min. The ATP EC50, Imax, and n H were obtained from each ATP concentration-response plot by fitting the data using the Hill equation. Full concentration-response curves were derived from single cells; protocols were repeated using several batches of cells. To study the modulation of the ATP-evoked currents by the metals, separate cell batches expressing the wild-type or the mutant receptors were pre-incubated with 1–300 μm copper or 1–100 μm zinc for 1 min before the addition of a challenge concentration of 10 μm ATP, a value in the order of the nucleotide EC50. ATP applications were regularly spaced at 10-min intervals, the optimal time previously determined to attain full recovery of the ATP-evoked current, an indication of the reversibility of the metal effects. Metal concentration-response plots were fitted using Graph Pad software; the copper IC50 was interpolated from each plot. Curve fitting was performed using the sigmoidal equations proper of concentration-response curves (GraphPad Prism 3.0; San Diego, CA). ATP and zinc EC50,Imax, and n H, as well as the copper IC50 were derived per oocyte in each experimental protocol (13Coddou C. Villalobos C. González J. Acuña-Castillo C. Loeb B. Huidobro-Toro J.P. J. Neurochem. 2002; 80: 626-633Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Maximal amplitudes were also derived. Non-parametric analysis and parametric tests were performed as appropriate (Kruskal-Wallis, Friedman, and Quade (see Ref. 20Theodorsson-Norheim E. Comput. Biol. Med. 1987; 17: 85-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar for review) and Dunnetts's tests for multiple comparisons with a single control); significance was set at p < 0.05. Copper non-competitively inhibited the currents evoked by ATP in wild-type receptors expressed in oocytes (Fig. 1A). DEPC treatment, which is expected to alkylate-exposed histidine residues, decreased the ATP Imax (44.5 ± 7.8%, p < 0.01) and abolished the inhibitory action of copper (Fig. 1B). In contrast, NEM treatment, which preferentially modifies the SH group of cysteines, significantly increased the ATP Imax (166.3 ± 24.5%, p < 0.001). Moreover, NEM treatment did not abolish the non-competitive copper inhibition (Fig. 1C), suggesting that histidines, rather than cysteines, are primarily involved in the action of copper. Both in the wild-type and the receptor mutants, the 15-s ATP pulse application resulted in currents with a distinct rapid peak and a slower component. The P2X4 receptor mutants resulted in functional channels; their ATP EC50 and Imax values are summarized in Table I. Compared with the wild-type, the ATP EC50 of the H140A and H286A mutants was 6- and 4-fold larger than the wild-type receptor; mutant H241A conserved the wild-type EC50 (Table I). On the other hand, the H286A mutant Imax was reduced by 67% (p < 0.01), whereas that of the H140A and H241A mutants was unaltered. The double and the triple histidine mutants with the H140A and H286A substitution also had a lower Imax and a larger EC50 than the wild-type (Table I).Table IEC50 and Imax values for wild-type and mutated P2X4 receptors expressed in X. laevis oocytes and HEK 293 cellsOocytesHEK cellsEC50ImaxnHEC50ImaxnHμ mnAμ mnAWild-type8.9 ± 2.1 (11)4676 ± 663 (20)1.3 ± 0.25.2 ± 1.0 (6)1.1 ± 0.2 (8)1.8 ± 0.4H140A61.2 ± 9.5ap < 0.01, as compared with the values obtained with the wild-type P2X4 receptor.

Open table in a new tab Copper Modulation—Copper decreased in a reversible and concentration-dependent manner the current elicited by a concentration of ATP close to the EC50 of each receptor (Fig. 2). The copper IC50 derived from these experiments was 8.9 ± 1.5 μm (n = 7) for the wild-type receptor, a value that was not significantly different from 8.7 ± 2.4 (n = 4) and 7.1 ± 2.7 μm (n = 6) for the H241A and H286A mutants, respectively. However, the H140A mutant was largely resistant to the modulator action of copper; 600 μm copper inhibited only 33.8 ± 8.5% (n = 4; see Fig. 2), suggesting that His-140 is essential for the copper-induced inhibition. Zinc Modulation—Zinc facilitated in a biphasic manner the ATP-gated currents; a maximum was reached at 10 μm zinc, which amounted to a 7.1 ± 0.7-fold (n = 7) increase over the current elicited by an ATP EC5, the preferred concentration used to evaluate the zinc modulation. Larger metal concentrations elicited smaller effects, resulting in a bell-shaped curve (recordings and inset in Fig. 3). The H241A and H286A mutants also showed a similar biphasic zinc curve; the maximal potentiation of the currents was 8.9 ± 0.6- and 8.0 ± 2.4-fold for the H241A and H286A mutants, respectively (n = 4; see Fig. 3). In contrast, the zinc curve for the H140A mutant was sigmoid, reaching a maximal potentiation at 30 μm zinc, which resulted in a 27.4 ± 7.7-fold potentiation (p < 0.001, n = 4; see Fig. 3). This potentiation was 4-fold larger than for the wild-type receptor. Mechanisms of Trace Metal Modulation: ATP Concentration-response Curves—In contrast to the wild-type receptor, 10 μm copper did not modify the ATP concentration-response curve in the H140A mutant, whereas it non-competitively inhibited the H241A and the H286A receptor mutants (see Fig. 4 and Table II). 10 μm zinc displaced the ATP-concentration-response curve of the H140A mutant to the left (Fig. 4) and additionally increased the Imax from 104 ± 8.3% in the wild-type to 205 ± 21.8% (p < 0.001; see Table II). Zinc also increased the ATP Imax of the H286A mutant to 238.2 ± 58.2% (p < 0.001; see Table II and Fig. 4). The effect of zinc in the H241A mutant was identical to that of the wild-type receptor.Table IIEffect of a 1-min pre-application of 10 μm copper or 10 μm zinc on the ATP EC50 and Imax values for the wild-type and mutant P2X4 receptors expressed in X. laevis oocytesEC50ImaxControl+ Cu2++ Zn2+Control+ Cu2++ Zn2+μ m%Wild-type8.9 ± 2.120.8 ± 6.62.6 ± 1.2ap < 0.05, as compared with the values obtained in control conditions.103.1 ± 5.946.2 ± 4.1bp < 0.01, as compared with the values obtained in control conditions.107.2 ± 7.7H140A61.2 ± 9.587.5 ± 16.728.4 ± 11.6ap < 0.05, as compared with the values obtained in control conditions.104.0 ± 8.3108.6 ± 7.1205.5 ± 21.8cp < 0.01, as compared with the values obtained in control conditions.H241A8.4 ± 0.816.0 ± 3.73.6 ± 1.1ap < 0.05, as compared with the values obtained in control conditions.102.3 ± 5.555.1 ± 2.6bp < 0.01, as compared with the values obtained in control conditions.112.2 ± 6.9H286A40.2 ± 8.356.4 ± 26.033.1 ± 25.295.3 ± 5.541.7 ± 9.3cp < 0.01, as compared with the values obtained in control conditions.238.2 ± 58.2cp < 0.01, as compared with the values obtained in control conditions.a p < 0.05, as compared with the values obtained in control conditions.b p < 0.01, as compared with the values obtained in control conditions.c p < 0.01, as compared with the values obtained in control conditions. Open table in a new tab Trace Metal Modulation in the Double and Triple Histidine Mutants—The mutants containing the H140A substitution were resistant to the inhibitory action of up to 100 μm copper. In contrast, the mutant containing the other two histidines conserved the inhibition by copper and behaved similar to that of the wild-type receptor (Fig 5A). Zinc potentiated the magnitude of the ATP current in the H140A/H241A/H286A receptor, reaching a plateau at 100 μm; the maximal potentiation was 32.9 ± 5.5-fold, a value significantly larger than that observed in the wild-type receptor (p < 0.01; see Fig. 5B). In the double receptor mutants H140A/H241A and H140A/H286A, the maximal zinc potentiation amounted to 12.0 ± 6.0% and 11.7 ± 4.7-fold, respectively (p < 0.01 each, n = 5 each), values which are two-three times smaller than those attained with the H140A mutant. In contrast, the H241A/H286A mutant had a biphasic zinc curve, similar to that observed in the wild-type receptor (Fig. 5B); the maximal potentiation reached only 6.2 ± 1.6-fold and served as a negative control, because the maximal potentiation in the wild-type receptor reached 7.1 ± 0.7-fold. Substitution of His-140 by Other Amino Acids—The copper IC50 in the H140T mutant was 78.5 ± 31.2 μm (n = 4), a value 8-fold higher than in the wild-type receptor (n = 6, p < 0.01; see Fig. 6). The zinc curve was biphasic; its maximal effect reached 17.3 ± 2.9-fold, a value 2.5-fold higher than the wild-type receptor (p < 0.01), but slightly smaller than the maximal potentiation obtained in the H140A mutant (27.4 ± 7.7-fold increase; see Fig. 6). The currents elicited by the H140R mutant were 100-fold smaller than the wild-type and were long lasting, even after ATP removal (Fig. 6, tracings). The estimated ATP EC50 was 32.2 ± 7.4 μm (n = 3; see"
https://openalex.org/W1995745897,"Gab1 and Gab2 are scaffolding proteins acting downstream of cell surface receptors and interact with a variety of cytoplasmic signaling proteins such as Grb2, Shp-2, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, Shc, and Crk. To identify new binding partners for GAB proteins and better understand their functions, we performed a yeast two-hybrid screening with hGab2-(120–587) as bait. This work led to identification of a novel GTPase-activating protein (GAP) for Rho family GTPases. The GAP domain shows high similarity to the recently cloned CdGAP and displays activity toward RhoA, Rac1, and Cdc42 in vitro. The protein was named GC-GAP for its ability to interact with GAB proteins and its activity toward Rac and Cdc42. GC-GAP is predominantly expressed in the brain with low levels detected in other tissues. Antibodies directed against GC-GAP recognized a protein of ∼200 kDa. Expression of GC-GAP in 293T cells led to a reduction in active Rac1 and Cdc42 levels but not RhoA. Suppression of GC-GAP expression by siRNA inhibited proliferation of C6 astroglioma cells. In addition, GC-GAP contains several classic proline-rich motifs, and it interacts with the first SH3 domain of Crk and full-length Nck in vitro. We propose that Gab1 and Gab2 in cooperation with other adapter molecules might regulate the cellular localization of GC-GAP under specific stimuli, acting to regulate precisely Rac and Cdc42 activities. Given that GC-GAP is specifically expressed in the nervous system and that it is localized to the dendritic processes of cultured neurons, GC-GAP may play a role in dendritic morphogenesis and also possibly in neural/glial cell proliferation.

Cells respond to environmental changes and communicate with neighboring cells through different signal transduction pathways. By participating in protein complex assembly, adapter proteins play an active role in transducing signals from cell surface receptors.

The GAB proteins are characterized by a PH domain at the N terminus of the molecules and multiple consensus tyrosine residues that serve as SH2-docking sites when phosphorylated. In addition, these molecules contain one or more proline-rich motifs that interact with SH3 domains. Three GAB proteins (Gab1–3) have been identified in mammals, and Daughter of Sevenless (DOS) in Drosophila and suppressor-of-Clr-1 (SOC-1) in Caenorhabditis elegans are apparently their homologues with the same molecular architecture (1Holgado-Madruga M.

A mutant DOS protein with PH domain deletion is non-functional (10Herbst R. Zhang X. Qin J. Simon M.A. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6950-6961Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The PH domain of Gab1 is required for its localization to plasma membrane and cell-cell contacts. It is also required for Gab1 to induce morphological changes in MDCK cells (11Maroun C.R.

Biol. 1999; 19: 1784-1799Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar).Both Gab1 and Gab2 interact with the adapter protein Grb2, presumably through their proline-rich motifs and the Grb2 SH3 domain (4Zhao C.

This interaction may serve as a bridge between Gab1 and receptor tyrosine kinases such as c-Met and EGF receptor (14Bardelli A. Longati P. Gramaglia D. Stella M.C. Comoglio P.M. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 3103-3111Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 15Nguyen L. Holgado-Madruga M. Maroun C. Fixman E.D. Kamikura D. Fournier T. Charest A. Tremblay M.L. Wong A.J. Park M. J.

Gab3 interacts with C-terminal SH3 domain of a Grb2-related adapter protein Mona/Gads (16Bourgin C. Bourette R.P. Arnaud S. Liu Y. Rohrschneider L.R. Mouchiroud G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 3744-3756Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). It is not clear whether the Grb2 or Gads interactions are essential for the function of GAB proteins, because no mutations specifically disrupting Grb2/Gads interactions are generated for GAB molecules.All GAB proteins contain multiple docking sites for SH2 domains. Gab1 and Gab2 both can interact with a number of SH2 domain containing proteins, such as Shp-2, p85 subunit of PI3-K, PLCγ, Crk, and Shc. The function of GAB proteins is highly dependent on the interaction with the protein-tyrosine phosphatase Shp-2 or CSW for DOS in Drosophila (2Gu H. Pratt J.C. Burakoff S.J. Neel B.G. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 729-740Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar, 10Herbst R. Zhang X. Qin J.

Biol. 2000; 20: 8513-8525Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). DOS has putative binding sites for Shc, PLCγ, PI3-K, and CSW (8Raabe T. Riesgo-Escovar J. Liu X. Bausenwein B.S. Deak P. Maroy P. Hafen E. Cell. 1996; 85: 911-920Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar, 18Herbst R. Carroll P.M. Allard J.D. Schilling J. Raabe T. Simon M.A. Cell. 1996; 85: 899-909Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). When single tyrosine residues were mutated to phenylalanine, DOS mutants defective in binding Shc, PLCγ, and the regulatory subunit of PI3-K can still function during development. Furthermore, a DOS mutant, with essentially all the tyrosine residues outside the PH domain deleted, removed, or mutated except for the two CSW-binding sites (Tyr-801 and Tyr-854), was still able to rescue the loss of endogenous DOS function, albeit at reduced efficiency. On the other hand, when either Tyr-801 or Tyr-854 was mutated to Phe, DOS protein no longer functions, indicating interaction between DOS and CSW is critical for DOS function (10Herbst R. Zhang X. Qin J. Simon M.A. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6950-6961Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Similarly, both Gab1 and Gab2 have tandem tyrosine motifs (YLDL, YVVV for Gab1, and YLAL, YVQV for Gab2) at the C-terminal tail for Shp-2 binding. Both tyrosine residues are critical for GAB function in the MAP kinase pathway. When Gab1 and Gab2 were overexpressed in cells, they could promote Erk activation. However, when the Shp-2-binding sites were mutated, they lost their ability to enhance Erk activity (13Schaeper U. Gehring N.H. Fuchs K.P. Sachs M. Kempkes B. Birchmeier W. J.

There are three consensus tyrosine motifs (Y(V/M)XV) (21Cohen G.B. Ren R. Baltimore D. Cell. 1995; 80: 237-248Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (924) Google Scholar) for p85 SH2 domains in both Gab1 and Gab2. When those tyrosine residues were mutated, Gab1 and Gab2 failed to interact with p85. As a result, they no longer associate with PI3-K activities (22Gu H. Maeda H. Moon J.J. Lord J.D. Yoakim M.

The Gab1Δp85 mutant was able to induce apoptosis in PC12 cells, whereas expression of wild-type Gab1 protected cells from apoptosis (23Holgado-Madruga M. Moscatello D.K. Emlet D.R. Dieterich R.

Furthermore, bone marrow-derived mast cells from Gab2–/– mice were defective in PI3-K and Akt activation following FcϵRI activation (27Gu H. Saito K. Klaman L.D. Shen J. Fleming T. Wang Y. Pratt J.C. Lin G. Lim B. Kinet J.P. Neel B.G. Nature. 2001; 412: 186-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). On the other hand, LY294002 treatment of MDCK cells prevented Gab1 from cell-cell contact. Other SH2-binding partners of GAB include PLCγ (28Gual P. Giordano S. Williams T.A. Rocchi S. Van Obberghen E. Comoglio P.M. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 1509-1518Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar) and adapter proteins Shc, Crk, and Crk-L (22Gu H. Maeda H. Moon J.J. Lord J.D. Yoakim M. Nelson B.H. Neel B.G. Mol. Cell.

Crk/Gab1 interaction may play a role in Crk-induced c-Jun N-terminal kinase activation (30Garcia-Guzman M. Dolfi F. Zeh K. Vuori K. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 7775-7786Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The significance of these interactions awaits further mutational studies.In addition to the PH domain, proline-rich motifs, and consensus tyrosine residues, Gab1 possesses a Met binding domain that mediates its association with the receptor tyrosine kinase c-MET (3Weidner K.M. Di Cesare S. Sachs M. Brinkmann V. Behrens J. Birchmeier W. Nature. 1996; 384: 173-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar). Recently, Gab1 was shown to associate with Erk2, and the Met binding domain may be responsible for the interaction (31Roshan B. Kjelsberg C. Spokes K. Eldred A. Crovello C.S. Cantley L.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36362-36368Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). In another study, Gab2 was reported to form a stable complex with PKB (Akt) (32Lynch D.K. Daly R.J. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 72-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Furthermore, both proteins were shown to be substrates of their associated kinases (31Roshan B. Kjelsberg C. Spokes K. Eldred A. Crovello C.S. Cantley L.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36362-36368Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 32Lynch D.K. Daly R.J. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 72-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). It is suggested that Gab2 phosphorylation by PKB leads to a feedback inhibition on ErbB receptor signaling (32Lynch D.K. Daly R.J. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 72-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The closely related adapter protein IRS1 is also phosphorylated on Ser/Thr residues, and the Ser/Thr phosphorylation may inhibit tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1 by the insulin receptor, therefore down-regulating insulin receptor signaling. Both Erk and the PI3-K/Akt pathways have been indicated as responsible for IRS1 phosphorylation on Ser/Thr residues (33De Fea K. Roth R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31400-31406Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar, 34Li J. DeFea K. Roth R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9351-9356Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Gab1 and Gab2 are both highly enriched in Ser/Thr residues. The interactions of GAB proteins with Ser/Thr kinases suggest that they may also be subjected to regulation by Ser/Thr phosphorylation and dephosphorylation.Although many proteins were identified to bind GAB proteins, the function of these molecules is not clear. Most of these protein/protein interactions are dependent on Tyr(P) residues and originally identified by the presence of consensus SH2-binding motifs within GAB molecules. In order to identify protein/protein interactions independent of Tyr phosphorylation of GAB proteins, a Gab2 fragment (amino acids 120–587 of human Gab2 protein) was used in a yeast two-hybrid screen. This led to the identification of a novel GTPase-activating protein (GAP) for Rho family GTPases, GAB-associated Cdc42/Rac GAP (GC-GAP).MATERIALS AND METHODSYeast Two-hybrid Screen—The cDNA fragment encoding amino acids 120–587 of human Gab2 was inserted into vector pGBDu-C2 in-frame with the DNA binding domain of Gal4. The bait plasmid was transformed into the host cell PJ69-4A (35James P. Halladay J. Craig E.A. Genetics. 1996; 144: 1425-1436Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). PJ69-4A bearing pGBDu-C2/hGab2-(120–587) was transformed with Mouse 17-Day Embryo MATCHMAKER cDNA Library (Clontech ML4006AB). A total of 1.8 × 107 independent colonies was screened for Gab2 interaction. Colonies positive for Ade were further plated on SC-Ura-Leu-His + 2 mm 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole and analyzed for β-galactosidase activity. Yeast DNA from confirmed positive colonies were prepared (Zymoprep Yeast Plasmid Minipreparation Kit, ZYMO Research) and rescued in bacteria strain RR1 (35James P. Halladay J. Craig E.A. Genetics. 1996; 144: 1425-1436Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) under Leu selection. The plasmid DNA was then introduced back into yeast to test for bait dependence. All bait-dependent clones were sequenced and analyzed with the NCBI BLAST program.DNA Constructs and Other Reagents—Human KIAA0712 cDNA clone was obtained from Kazusa DNA Research Institute, Chiba, Japan. Rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) was performed with human brain Marathon cDNA (Clontech) to revise the 5′-end of kiaa0712 sequence. Full-length human GC-GAP was cloned into pCMVFLAGII for transient transfection studies. Mouse full-length coding sequence was acquired by several rounds of 5′-RACE and one 3′-RACE reaction (mouse d17 embryo marathon cDNA, Clontech). Primers for RACE were designed according to the manufacturer's instructions. R58A mutant GAP domain was generated by PCR and confirmed by DNA sequencing. Semliki Forest virus (SFV) particles were prepared according to the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen). Bicistronic DNA sequences (GAP-IRES-GFP) were inserted into the pSFV vector for both wild-type and mutant GAP domain. GST fusion constructs of RhoA, Rac1, and Cdc42 and the Nck mammalian expression construct were from Dr. Lawrence Quilliam. Mammalian expression constructs for Myc-tagged wild-type RhoA, Rac1, and Cdc42 were gifts from Dr. Gary Bokoch. Crk expression construct was obtained from Dr. Kristiina Vuori. Anti-GC-GAP antibodies were generated against GST fusion proteins of mouse GC-GAP 803–911 (Bur273) and 1590–1740 (Bur281). A 1:1,000 dilution of GST pre-cleared Bur273 antiserum was used for GC-GAP Western blot. Antigen-purified Bur281 (1 μg) was used for GC-GAP immunoprecipitation. Antibodies against FLAG (M2), HA (12CA5), and c-Myc (9E10) were from Sigma, Roche Applied Science, and Santa Cruz Biotechnology, respectively. Nck and Crk antibodies were from Transduction Laboratories. Anti-Gab2 was described previously (4Zhao C. Yu D.H. Shen R. Feng G.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19649-19654Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar).Northern Blot and in Situ Hybridization—Northern blot was performed as described before (4Zhao C. Yu D.H. Shen R. Feng G.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19649-19654Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Mouse Multiple Tissue Northern (Clontech 7762-1) was used to examine the tissue distribution of GC-GAP. GC-GAP cDNA probe was labeled (Prime-It II Random Primer Labeling Kit, Stratagene) according to manufacturer's instructions with minor modifications. Antisense GC-GAP-specific primers were used to prime the reaction instead of random primers. The cDNA templates used for probe synthesis encode amino acids 434–761 and 1152–1434 of mouse GC-GAP. In situ hybridization was described before (36Ma Q. Chen Z. del Barco Barrantes I. de la Pompa J.L. Anderson D.J. Neuron. 1998; 20: 469-482Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (605) Google Scholar).Cell Culture and Transient Transfection—293T, COS1, N1E115 and C6 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with penicillin/streptomycin/glutamine (Invitrogen) and 10% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone). A calcium phosphate transfection system (Invitrogen) and FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science) were used for 293T and COS1 cells, respectively. SHSY5Y cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with penicillin/streptomycin/glutamine, non-essential amino acids, and 10% fetal bovine serum. For GC-GAP RNAi in C6 astroglioma, cells were plated at 200,000/well (12-well plate) density, and 1.2 μl of double-stranded RNA (40 μm) was used to transfect each well with LipofectAMINE reagent (Invitrogen).Immunoprecipitation and Western Blot Analysis—Cell lysate was prepared as described previously. For immunoprecipitation, 1 mg (or stated otherwise) of total protein was incubated with 1 μg of antibody (or 5 μl of antiserum) for 2–4 h at 4 °C, and the mixture was further incubated overnight with A/G plus agarose (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). The bead-bound complex was washed 2–3 times with cold HNTG buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 0.1% Triton X-100) and resuspended in 10 μl of 2× SDS sample buffer. For Western blot analysis, membranes were incubated in 5% non-fat dry milk for 30 min at room temperature and then in primary antibodies for 2–3 h at room temperature (or at 4 °C overnight). After being washed with TBS-T (10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20), the membranes were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Amersham Biosciences) at room temperature for 1 h. Proteins were detected with chemiluminescence (Western Lightning Chemiluminescence Reagent Plus, PerkinElmer Life Sciences).GAP Activity Assay—GST fusion proteins of RhoA, Rac1, and Cdc42 were purified from bacterial strain BL21 (DE3) (37Self A.J. Hall A. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 256: 3-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar), and the GAP assay was performed as described (37Self A.J. Hall A. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 256: 3-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 38Settleman J. Foster R. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 256: 105-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Briefly, the GAP reaction was carried out at room temperature with 0.2 pmol of purified GAP, 0.02 pmol of γ-32P-loaded small GTPase, 25 mm Tris-HCl, 1.5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 7.5 mm MgCl2, and 2 mm dithiothreitol. The reaction was stopped at different time points by 1 ml of stop buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 25 mm MgCl2, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin). The samples were then passed through a nitrocellulose filter (BA85, Schleicher & Schuell), and the radioactivity associated with the filters was quantified by scintillation counting. For the affinity-based GAP activity assay, GC-GAP was co-transfected with Myc-tagged expression constructs of wild-type RhoA, Rac1, and Cdc42. Active RhoA and Rac1/Cdc42 levels were determined by GST-RBD and GST-PBD pull-down assays, 48 h after transfection (39Ren X.D. Schwartz M.A. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 325: 264-272Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 40Azim A.C. Barkalow K.L. Hartwig J.H. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 325: 257-263Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The level of active small GTPases was determined by Western blot against Myc (9E10).Immunofluorescent Staining—Cells seeded on coverslips were rinsed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 for 5 min. After blocking nonspecific binding with phosphate-buffered saline plus 3% bovine serum albumin and 3% fetal bovine serum, the cells were incubated with primary antibodies (anti-GC-GAP, 1:100 and anti-MAP2 1:100, Sigma). The cells were then treated with two secondary antibodies, Alexa Fluor 594 goat anti-mouse and Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-rabbit (1:100, Molecular Probes). At the last wash step, Hoechst 33324 (1 μg/ml; Molecular Probes) was added to allow assessment of nuclear morphology.Cell Proliferation Assay—C6 cells were incubated for 1 h in the presence of the thymidine analogue 5-bromo-2′-deoxyuridine (BrdUrd) at 10 μm. Cells were then fixed and stained with anti-BrdUrd antibodies according to manufacturer's instructions (BrdUrd Labeling and Detection Kit I, Roche Applied Science). DAPI containing mounting media (Vectashield) was used to reveal all cell nuclei. Samples were analyzed with Nikon inverted fluorescent microscope under 20× objective, and pictures were taken with a Spot Camera. The percentage of S-phase cells was obtained by dividing the number of BrdUrd-labeled cells with the number of DAPI-revealed nuclei.RESULTSIdentification of GC-GAP as a Novel Gab2-binding Protein—In order to identify Gab2-binding proteins, we took a yeast two-hybrid approach using a human Gab2 fragment (amino acids 120–587) as bait. Among the 41 independent positive colonies we obtained from the mouse embryonic day 17 cDNA library, 3 of them contained the same cDNA fragment. The interaction between these positive clones and Gal4DBD-Gab2-(120–587) is dependent on Gab2. Fig. 1A shows the interaction between Gab2 and clone 10, one of the three identical positive clones. To confirm that the polypeptide derived from the cDNA fragment indeed interacts with Gab2, we inserted the fragment into CMV-FLAG II and co-transfected clone 10 into 293T cells with HA-Gab2 (Fig. 1B). HA-Gab2 was pulled down by FLAG monoclonal antibody M2 only when FLAG-C10 was present (Fig. 1B , upper two panels). Likewise, FLAG-C10 was present in the Gab2 antibody complex only when Gab2 was expressed (Fig. 1B , lower panels). These results suggest that there is a specific interaction between Gab2 and clone 10.Sequence analysis of the 2184-bp insert revealed that it displayed over 80% identities in nucleotide sequence to a cDNA clone kiaa0712 in the GenBank™ data base, indicating that clone 10 is the mouse homologue of the human gene kiaa0712. Deduced amino acid sequence of kiaa0712 contains an incomplete GAP domain at the N terminus, highly homologous to the GAP domain of the recently reported CdGAP (68.7% identity). We then performed a 5′-RACE reaction and found that a single nucleotide was missing in the kiaa0712 sequence, which caused a frameshift in the coding sequence. The revised cDNA sequence encoded a protein of 1738 amino acids, which extended 151 amino acid residues from the first Met residue of the original KIAA0712. Several in-frame stop codons were present before the initiation codon AUG. The full-length coding sequence of mouse clone10 was obtained by several 5′- and 3′-RACE reactions. This gene was designated GC-GAP (GAB-associated Cdc42/Rac GTPase-activating protein). The GenBank™ accession numbers for human and mouse GC-GAP are AY194286 and AY194287, respectively. The mouse and human GC-GAP proteins share 86% identity and 88% overall similarity (Fig. 2A,Fig. 2A,Fig. 2A). They are identical in the GAP domain. The GAP domain of GC-GAP is closely related to that of CdGAP (Fig. 2B) (41Lamarche-Vane N. Hall A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29172-29177Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). BLAST search with GC-GAP as query also pulled out a Drosophila protein d-CdGAPr (42Sagnier T. Grienenberger A. Mariol M. Berenger H. Pradel J. Graba Y. Mech. Dev. 2000; 94: 267-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). The GAP domain of d-CdGAPr shows over 48% identity to those of GC-GAP and CdGAP (Fig. 2B). In addition to the GAP domain, GC-GAP displays 67% similarity to CdGAP in the region adjunct to the C-terminal end of the GAP domain (Fig. 2C). We designated this region GH domain for GC-GAP homology. Furthermore, GC-GAP contains several proline-rich motifs, indicating putative interactions with SH3 domain or WW domain containing proteins (Fig. 2D) (43Kay B.K. Williamson M.P. Sudol M. FASEB J. 2000; 14: 231-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (1036) Google Scholar). In summary, GC-GAP is a novel Gab2-bindi"

Previous studies have identified specific amino acids in the cytoplasmic tail of SR-A that regulate receptor internalization; however, the role of cytoplasmic domains in regulating cell adhesion has not been addressed. To investigate the role of cytoplasmic domains in SR-A-mediated adhesion and to address whether SR-A-mediated adhesion and internalization require distinct cytoplasmic domains, different SR-A constructs were stably expressed in human embryonic kidney (HEK 293) cells.

Renal Invest. Drugs. 2000; 2: 223-232Google Scholar). The carboxyl-terminal extracellular region of SR-A contains a positively charged groove that allows SR-A to bind a variety of polyanionic ligands including modified lipoproteins, bacterial products, and extracellular matrix proteins (3Doi T. Higashino K. Kurihara Y. Wada Y. Miyazaki T. Nakamura H. Uesugi S. Imanishi T. Kawabe Y. Itakura H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2126-2133Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 4Platt N. Gordon S. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 108: 649-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). Because of its ability to bind these various ligands, SR-A is thought to be involved in many physiological and pathophysiological processes such as host defense and athero-gsclerosis (4Platt N. Gordon S. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 108: 649-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar, 5Yamada Y. Doi T. Hamakubo T. Kodama T. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 1998; 54: 628-640Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). SR-A was originally identified on macrophages as the receptor that binds and internalizes modified lipoproteins via clathrin-coated pit-mediated endocytosis (6Goldstein J.L. Ho Y.K. Basu S.K. Brown M.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 333-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (1917) Google Scholar, 7Fukuda S. Horiuchi S. Tomita K. Murakami M. Morino Y. Takahashi K. Virchows Arch. B Cell Pathol. Incl. Mol. Pathol. 1986; 52: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Consequently, most studies on SR-A have focused on its ability to internalize ligand. However, SR-A also mediates cell adhesion (8Fraser I. Hughes D. Gordon S. Nature. 1993; 364: 343-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). Several components of the extracellular matrix, including modified types of collagen and certain proteoglycans present at sites of inflammation, have been identified as adhesion substrates for SR-A (9el Khoury J.

Therefore, SR-A-mediated adhesion might play an important role in macrophage retention, specifically at sites of tissue injury. It has not been defined whether SR-A-mediated adhesion results from an attempt to internalize an immobilized ligand or involves functional processes that are distinct from those involved in receptor internalization. Previous studies have indicated that SR-A-mediated adhesion and internalization have similar extracellular requirements (8Fraser I. Hughes D. Gordon S. Nature. 1993; 364: 343-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar, 9el Khoury J. Thomas C.A. Loike J.D. Hickman S.E. Cao L. Silverstein S.C. J. Biol.

Consequently, it has been postulated that these functions involve a common mechanism (13Fong L.G. Le D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36808-36816Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). However, our recent results showed that clathrin does not co-localize with SR-A in the filopodia-like projections associated with the enhanced adhesion of SR-A expressing cells and this suggests that SR-A-mediated adhesion is a process that is distinct from that of receptor endocytosis (14Post S.R. Gass C. Rice S. Nikolic D. Crump H. Post G.R. J. Lipid Res. 2002; 43: 1829-1836Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). In general, receptor-mediated endocytosis requires specific internalization motifs located within the cytoplasmic tail. For example, the transferrin receptor (TfR), which like SR-A, is a type II transmembrane receptor, has a well defined cytoplasmic motif (YTRF) that is required for receptor internalization (15Jing S.Q. Spencer T. Miller K. Hopkins C. Trowbridge I.S. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 110: 283-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). Previous studies with SR-A have identified specific amino acids in the cytoplasmic tail that are involved in regulating receptor internalization and cell-surface expression (13Fong L.G. Le D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36808-36816Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 16Fong L.G. J.

Bull. 1999; 22: 1022-1026Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). However, the importance of cytoplasmic domains in SR-A-mediated adhesion has not been addressed. To investigate the role of the cytoplasmic tail in SR-A-mediated cell adhesion and to determine whether adhesion and internalization require distinct cytosolic domains, various SR-A constructs were stably expressed in human embryonic kidney (HEK 293) cells under the control of a tetracycline-inducible promoter. Generation of the SR-A Construct Expression Vectors—The cDNAs encoding full-length SR-A, SR-A lacking all 55 amino acids of the amino-terminal cytoplasmic tail (SR-AΔ1–55), and SR-A lacking the first 49 amino acids of the cytoplasmic tail (SR-AΔ1–49) were amplified by PCR from SR-A type II murine cDNA (GenBank™ accession number L04275). Deleting the cDNA encoding the amino-terminal amino acids eliminated the translation start codon. Therefore, the 5′ PCR primers used to amplify SR-AΔ1–55 and SR-AΔ1–49 were designed to insert a methionine translation start codon and a spacer alanine codon. To replace the cytoplasmic tail of SR-A with that of the transferrin receptor (TfR/SR-A), the cDNA encoding the amino-terminal 57 amino acids of the murine transferrin receptor (GenBank™ accession X57349) was amplified by RT-PCR (Access RT-PCR System, Promega, Madison, WI) from RNA isolated from mouse liver and inserted 5′ to the cDNA encoding the SR-A transmembrane and extracellular domains. These cDNAs inserts were cloned into the pcDNA5/FRT/TO expression vector (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). The sequence of the inserts was confirmed at the Macromolecular Structure Analysis Facility at the University of Kentucky. The amino acid sequences of the receptor constructs are shown in Table I.Table IAmino acid sequences of the amino-terminal cytoplasmic tail of SR-A receptor constructsReceptor constructAmino acid sequence of amino-terminal cytoplasmic tail1102030405055SR-A (full-length)MTKEMTENQRLCPHEREDADCSSESVKFDARSMTASLPHSTKNGPSVQEKLKSFKSR-AΔ1-49MAKLKSFKSR-AΔ1-55MA1102030405057TfR/SR-AMMDQARSAFSNLFGGEPLSYTRFSLARQVDGDNSHVEMKLAADEEENADNNMKASVR Open table in a new tab Generation of HEK Cells Expressing SR-A Constructs and Cell Culture—To generate cells that express the different SR-A constructs, we used the Flp-In™ T-REx™ system (Invitrogen). This system allows tetracycline-inducible expression after integration of the cDNA into a specific genomic site. An important advantage of this system is that similar levels of expression can be obtained upon induction of cells transfected with the different SR-A constructs. Flp-In™ T-REx™ HEK 293 host cells were used, as HEK 293 cells do not endogenously express SR-A and have been used previously to study SR-A function (14Post S.R. Gass C. Rice S. Nikolic D. Crump H. Post G.R. J. Lipid Res. 2002; 43: 1829-1836Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). HEK 293 host cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM; Invitrogen) containing penicillin (10 units/ml), streptomycin (10 μg/ml), heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (10% fetal bovine serum; Invitrogen) (DMEM/fetal bovine serum), and the selection antibiotics blasticidin (15 μg/ml) and zeocin (100 μg/ml). Cells were co-transfected with pcDNA5/FRT/TO containing the SR-A constructs and pOG44 encoding Flp recombinase, which mediates insertion of pcDNA5/FRT/TO into the genomic integration site, using the TransIT-293 transfection reagent according to the manufacturer's protocol (Mi-rus, Madison, WI). Integration of pcDNA5/FRT/TO eliminates zeocin resistance and confers hygromycin B resistance. Thus, transfected cells were selected for stable integration of the SR-A constructs with hygromycin B (200 μg/ml). Receptor expression was induced by adding tetracycline to the culture media for 16 h unless stated otherwise. Concentration response studies showed that a concentration of 0.5 μg/ml tetracycline induced maximal protein expression (data not shown). RT-PCR—Total RNA was isolated using the SV total RNA isolation system (Promega, Madison, WI). The Access RT-PCR system (Promega) was used to assess mRNA expression of the SR-A constructs. The primers used (5′-cgcgggaagcttgcaatggctgccctcattgctctc-3′ and 5′-gggctcgagttatactgatcttgatccgcc-3′) amplify a 897-bp product corresponding to the SR-A transmembrane and extracellular domains (SR-A nucleotides 171–1067) common to all SR-A constructs. The parameters for the thermocycle reaction were: 48 °C for 45 min, 94 °C for 2 min, and 40 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 60 °C for 60 s, and 68 °C for 120 s. Reactions performed in the absence of RNA or of reverse transcriptase were used as negative controls. RT-PCR products were analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis and visualized following ethidium bromide staining using a Kodak Image Station 440. Preparation of Cell Lysates—Cell lysates were prepared by incubating cells in lysis buffer (25 mm MES, 150 mm NaCl, 60 mm octylgluco-pyranoside, 1% Triton X-100, pH 6.4) for 30 min on ice. Protein concentrations were determined using bovine serum albumin as standard (DC Protein Assay, Bio-Rad). Western Blotting—Cell lysates were resolved by SDS-PAGE on a 7.5% gel under reducing or non-reducing conditions and transferred to polyvinylidene fluoride membranes (Millipore, Bedford, MA). In some experiments, SR-A receptors were immunoprecipitated from cell lysates or culture media using the rat SR-A monoclonal antibody, 2F8 (3 μg/ml; Serotec, Raleigh, NC) and anti-rat IgG-coated magnetic beads. Receptor proteins resolved under reducing conditions were detected using a guinea pig antiserum developed to a fusion protein of the extracellular SR-A domain as described previously (18Daugherty A. Whitman S.C. Block A.E. Rateri D.L. J. Lipid Res. 2000; 41: 1568-1577Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To detect oligomeric forms of the receptors, cell lysates were resolved under non-reducing conditions and receptor proteins were detected with 2F8 (3 μg/ml, Serotec), which also recognizes an extracellular epitope of SR-A (18Daugherty A. Whitman S.C. Block A.E. Rateri D.L. J. Lipid Res. 2000; 41: 1568-1577Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Primary antibody binding was detected with horseradish peroxidase-labeled anti-guinea pig (1:10,000 dilution; Jackson, West Grove, PA) or anti-rat (1:5,000 dilution; Santa Cruz) secondary antibodies. Horseradish peroxidase activity was visualized by chemiluminescence (Pierce) using a Kodak Image Station 440. N-Glycanase (PNGase F) and Endoglycosidase H Digestion—To cleave all N-linked oligosaccharides, cell lysate protein (10 μg) was digested with N-glycanase (PNGase F; Sigma) in buffer (50 μl: 50 mm NaHPO4, 0.1% SDS, 0.05 m β-mercaptoethanol, pH 7.5) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Briefly, proteins were denatured by heating to 100 °C for 5 min. After cooling, Triton X-100 (0.75%, v/v) and N-glycanase were added and the reaction was incubated for 3 h at 37 °C. To cleave N-linked precursor oligosaccharides, cell lysate protein (10 μg) was digested with endoglycosidase H (EndoH, Sigma) in buffer (50 μl: 50 mm NaHPO4, 0.1% SDS, 0.05 m β-mercaptoethanol, pH 5.5) according to the manufacturer's protocol, which was identical to that used for N-glycanase digestion with the exception of the addition of Triton X-100. Tunicamycin and Brefeldin A Incubation—To inhibit N-linked glycosylation in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), cells were cultured in the presence of tunicamycin (5 μg/ml, Sigma). To inhibit maturation of N-linked oligosaccharides in the Golgi apparatus, cells were cultured in the presence of brefeldin A (5 μg/ml, Sigma). These inhibitors were added 60 min before inducing cells with tetracycline and were present throughout induction. Cell lysates were prepared 6 h after addition of tetracycline. Biotinylation of Cell-surface Proteins—Cells were cultured and induced in 6-well plates (0.5 × 106 cells/well), or to study the effect of cell adhesion on cell-surface localization of receptor, in ultra-low attachment plates (Costar, Corning, NY). Induced cells were trypsinized, washed, and cell-surface proteins were biotinylated in suspension (1 mg/ml EZ-Link sulfo-NHS-LC-Biotin in PBS, Pierce) at 4 °C for 30 min according to the manufacturer's instructions. To remove non-bound biotin, cells were washed with ice-cold Tris-buffered saline (pH 7.4) followed by PBS. Subsequently, cell lysates were prepared and biotinylated surface proteins were precipitated from lysates using streptavidin-coated magnetic beads. Cell-surface proteins (bead pellet) and intracellular proteins (supernatant) of the precipitation were resolved under reducing conditions by SDS-PAGE and SR-A was detected by Western blotting. AcLDL Internalization—Cells were cultured and induced in 6-well plates (0.5 × 106 cells/well), or to study the effect of cell adhesion on receptor-mediated ligand uptake, cells were cultured in ultra-low attachment plates (Costar). Following incubation of induced cells in serum-free DMEM for 2 h, fluorescently labeled AcLDL (2.5 μg/ml, Alexa Fluor 488-AcLDL, Molecular Probes) was added to the media and incubation was continued for another 2 h. Adherent cells were trypsinized, washed, and resuspended in PBS (4 °C). AcLDL internalization was assessed by quantifying cell-associated fluorescence (Flow Cytometry Core Facility, University of Kentucky). Fluorescence was gated for individual live cells and the fluorescence associated with ∼20,000 cells was determined for each sample. To assess nonspecific AcLDL cell association, polyinosine (10 μg/ml) was added 5 min before addition of fluorescently labeled AcLDL. Microscopy—Cells were plated on 2-chamber (5 × 104 cells/chamber) LAB-TEK glass slides (Nalge Nunc International, Naperville, IL) and receptor proteins were detected as previously described (14Post S.R. Gass C. Rice S. Nikolic D. Crump H. Post G.R. J. Lipid Res. 2002; 43: 1829-1836Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were induced where indicated, washed twice with phenol-red free DMEM (37 °C), fixed in paraformaldehyde (4% w/v), and permeabilized with Triton-X (0.1% in PBS). Nonspecific binding sites were blocked with bovine serum albumin (1% in PBS). To detect expressed receptors, cells were incubated with 2F8 (3 μg/ml, Serotec), followed by incubation with an Alexa Fluor 488-labeled goat anti-rat antibody (2 μg/ml; Molecular Probes). Cell nuclei were stained using 4,5-diamidino-2-phenylindole (Molecular Probes). Cells were mounted in Mowiol embedding medium containing n-propyl gallate (1%, w/v) and dried overnight at 4 °C. Images were captured digitally by fluorescence microscopy with exposure times kept constant. Cell Adhesion Assay—Cells were plated in 96-well plates (2 × 104 cells/well) in DMEM/fetal bovine serum and induced where indicated. Adhered cells were incubated in EDTA solution (0.2 g/liter, 37 °C) for 10 min to eliminate divalent cation-dependent adhesion. After washing with PBS (37 °C), cells remaining adhered were quantified using the CyQUANT assay (Molecular Probes) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cell adhesion is expressed as a percentage of total cells plated. The Membrane-proximal Amino Acids of the Cytoplasmic Tail Are Required for Post-transcriptional Processing of SR-A—To investigate the role of the cytoplasmic tail in SR-A-mediated adhesion and to determine whether SR-A-mediated adhesion and internalization require distinct cytoplasmic domains, we expressed full-length SR-A or different SR-A constructs (Table I) under the control of a tetracycline-inducible promoter in HEK 293 cells. Our initial approach involved deletion of the cytoplasmic tail, which we hypothesized would result in a loss of function, and the subsequent addition of amino acids to recover function. We found that deleting the entire 55-amino acid cytoplasmic tail (SR-AΔ1–55) greatly diminished SR-A protein abundance compared with that of SR-A full-length expressing cells (Fig. 1A). SR-A protein was not detectable in the culture media indicating that the decreased cellular SR-AΔ1–55 protein abundance was not because of secretion into the media (data not shown). In contrast to complete deletion of the cytoplasmic tail, retaining the membrane-proximal six amino acids by deleting amino acids 1 to 49 (SR-AΔ1–49) restored protein abundance of SR-A (Fig. 1A). SR-A mRNA abundance was similar for all SR-A constructs (Fig. 1B). Thus, our results demonstrate that the six membrane-proximal amino acids are required for post-transcriptional processing of SR-A. The Membrane-proximal Amino Acids of the Cytoplasmic Tail of SR-A Are Sufficient for Cell-surface Localization but Not for Receptor Internalization—To study the role of the membrane-proximal amino acids in regulating SR-A function, we analyzed cell-surface localization of SR-AΔ1-49. Cell-surface localization of SR-AΔ1–49 was greater than that of full-length SR-A (Fig. 2). Surface localization of SR-AΔ1–49 was similar in cells grown adhered to tissue culture plates or in suspension demonstrating that the increased surface localization of SR-AΔ1–49 was independent of SR-A-mediated adhesion. To address the role of the membrane-proximal amino acids for SR-A internalization, we examined internalization of the SR-A ligand AcLDL by quantifying cell-associated fluorescence after incubation with fluorescently labeled AcLDL for 2 h (Fig. 3). As shown previously, HEK 293 cells expressing full-length SR-A cells efficiently internalized AcLDL (14Post S.R. Gass C. Rice S. Nikolic D. Crump H. Post G.R. J. Lipid Res. 2002; 43: 1829-1836Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). However, cell-associated fluorescence detected in cells expressing SR-AΔ1–49 was 14% of that detected in cells expressing full-length SR-A (Fig. 3B). The small amount of fluorescence associated with SR-AΔ1–49 expressing cells most likely reflects AcLDL binding to cell-surface receptors. The increased cell-associated fluorescence observed in SR-A and SR-AΔ1–49 expressing cells was completely blocked by the SR-A antagonist polyinosine demonstrating specificity for SR-A. As shown for cell-surface localization, AcLDL internalization by cells expressing SR-AΔ1–49 was similar for both adherent and suspended cells (Fig. 3C), demonstrating that the failure of this receptor to internalize ligand was not the result of increased receptor-mediated adhesion. It is likely that the lack of SR-AΔ1–49 internalization results in the increased cell-surface localization of SR-AΔ1–49 (Fig. 2).Fig. 3AcLDL internalization by SR-A and SR-A Δ 1–49 expressing HEK cells. Cells were cultured and receptor expression induced as indicated in cells that were adhered to tissue culture plates (A and B) or growing in suspension (C). Following incubation of cells in serum-free DMEM for 2 h, fluorescently labeled AcLDL (2.5 μg/ml, Alexa Fluor 488 AcLDL) was added and cells were incubated for another 2 h. To determine nonspecific AcLDL association, polyinosine (10 μg/ml) was added before addition of AcLDL. Cell-associated fluorescence of uninduced, SR-A expressing, and SR-AΔ1–49 expressing cells that were either adhered (A) or suspended (C) was assessed by flow cytometry.

Previous studies have associated SR-A cell-surface localization and receptor internalization with a common cytoplasmic motif (17Morimoto K. Wada Y. Hinagata J. Imanishi T. Kodama T. Doi T. Biol. Pharm. Bull. 1999; 22: 1022-1026Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). However, the finding that SR-AΔ1–49 localized to the cell surface, but did not internalize ligand, suggests that SR-A trafficking to the cell surface and internalization have distinct cytoplasmic requirements. To address the specific role of the membrane-proximal amino acids in SR-A trafficking and whether an internalization motif is sufficient to mediate cell-surface localization, we generated a chimeric receptor in which the entire cytoplasmic tail of SR-A was replaced by 57 amino acids of the TfR cytoplasmic tail (TfR/SR-A; Table I) omitting a similar membrane-proximal domain. Like SR-A, the TfR is a type II transmembrane receptor that mediates internalization via clathrin-coated pits. However, whereas the cytoplasmic tail of SR-A is still poorly characterized, the cytoplasmic tail of TfR has been studied extensively and contains a well characterized internalization motif (YTRF; Ref. 15Jing S.Q. Spencer T. Miller K. Hopkins C. Trowbridge I.S. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 110: 283-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). To study the trafficking and intracellular processing of the chimeric TfR/SR-A, we assessed the ability of TfR/SR-A to form oligomers by resolving cell lysates from induced cells under non-reducing conditions. TfR/SR-A was expressed and assembled into oligomers similar to SR-A. Monomers of TfR/SR-A and SR-A were detected at a molecular weight higher than predicted from the amino acid sequences (about 38 kDa) suggesting that both receptors were post-translationally modified (Fig. 4A). However, the apparent molecular weight of TfR/SR-A was lower than SR-A, indicating that the post-translational processing was different. To examine the post-translational processing of the SR-A receptor constructs, we digested cell lysates prepared from induced cells with N-glycanase (Fig. 4B), which cleaves all N-linked oligosaccharides. The deglycosylated monomeric proteins were detectable at 38 kDa for both SR-A and the chimeric TfR/SR-A indicating that the differences in apparent molecular weight resulted from differences in N-linked oligosaccharides. To test whether the N-linked oligosaccharides of the receptors differ in Golgi processing, lysates prepared from induced cells were digested with EndoH (Fig. 4C). EndoH cleaves the high-mannose precursor N-linked oligosaccharides attached in the ER, but not the low-mannose mature oligosaccharides that are formed after processing in the Golgi. In contrast to SR-A (Fig. 4C) and SR-AΔ1–49 (data not shown), TfR/SR-A (Fig. 4C) was EndoH-sensitive indicating that TfR/SR-A was not processed into the EndoH-resistant mature form by the Golgi apparatus. The EndoH sensitivity of TfR/SR-A suggests that the oligosaccharides of TfR/SR-A are analogous to that of the EndoH-sensitive SR-A precursor. To confirm this, cells were treated before induction either with brefeldin A, which disrupts the Golgi apparatus thereby preventing conversion of the precursor into the mature form, or with tunicamycin, an inhibitor of N-linked glycosylation (Fig. 4D). We found that the apparent molecular weight of the SR-A precursor detected in brefeldin A-treated cells was the same as that of TfR/SR-A in untreated cells but was greater than that of the unglycosylated receptor in tunicamycin-treated cells. Together, the data demonstrate that TfR/SR-A is translated and subsequently glycosylated in the ER, but the glycosylated precursor is not further processed in the Golgi apparatus. Because TfR/SR-A assembles into trimers, it seems unlikely that TfR/SR-A is retained in the ER because of misfolding of the protein. As expected, TfR/SR-A was not detected on the cell surface using the biotinylation protocol described above (data not shown). Overall, our results from experiments studying the trafficking and intracellular processing of the different SR-A constructs demonstrate that an internalization motif is not sufficient to mediate trafficking to cell surface. Furthermore, the membrane-proximal amino acids of SR-A are sufficient for cell-surface localization and are specifically required for trafficking of SR-A from the ER to the Golgi apparatus. The Membrane-proximal Amino Acids of SR-A Are Sufficient to Mediate Cell Spreading and Adhesion—SR-A is involved in both ligand internalization and cell adhesion. As we described previously, SR-A-mediated cell adhesion involves an increase attachment of cells and distinct changes in cell morphology (14Post S.R. Gass C. Rice S. Nikolic D. Crump H. Post G.R. J. Lipid Res. 2002; 43: 1829-1836Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). To determine whether SR-AΔ1–49 mediates cell adhesion, we investigated the morphology of cells expressing the SR-A constructs (Fig. 5). Consistent with our previous findings (14Post S.R. Gass C. Rice S. Nikolic D. Crump H. Post G.R. J. Lipid Res. 2002; 43: 1829-1836Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), SR-A expressing HEK cells exhibited a cell morphology characterized by filopodia-like projections and increased cell spreading (Fig. 5, panels A and B). Consistent with the results indicating a lack of surface expression, cells expressing TfR/SR-A (panels C and D) exhibited an intracellular immunostaining pattern and no increased cell spreading. Interestingly, SR-AΔ1–49 expressing cells (panel E and F) exhibited filopodia-like projections and increased cell spreading that was similar to that observed for cells expressing full-length SR-A. As the presence of the filopodia-like projections and increased cell spreading are associated with increased cell adhesion of SR-A expressing cells, we analyzed cell adhesion of cells expressing the different SR-A constructs. Consistent with increased spreading of SR-A and SR-AΔ1–49 expressing cells, both receptors were able to increase cell adhesion to the same extent (Fig. 6), demonstrating that the membrane-proximal amino acids are sufficient for SR-A-mediated adhesion. As expected from the lack of surface expression, neither TfR/SR-A (Fig. 6) nor SR-AΔ1–55 (not shown) increased cell adhesion. To investigate the role of the cytoplasmic tail in SR-A-mediated adhesion, and to address whether SR-A-mediated adhesion and internalization require distinct cytoplasmic domains, we created different SR-A constructs and inducibly expressed them in stably transfected HEK 293 cells. Our results show that the cytoplasmic amino acids proximal to the membrane are required for SR-A post-transcriptional processing and play a critical role in SR-A trafficking to the cell surface. Further-more, these amino acids were sufficient for SR-A-mediated adhesion, but not for ligand internalization. Thus, our results demonstrate that SR-A-mediated adhesion and internalization require distinct cytoplasmic domains. The trafficking and post-translational processing of SR-A have been described previously (19Penman M. Lux A. Freedman N.J. Rohrer L. Ekkel Y. McKinstry H. Resnick D. Krieger M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 23985-23993Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). An initial step in the post-transcriptional processing of SR-A is insertion of the nascent protein into the membrane of the ER. The process whereby transmembrane proteins are inserted into the ER membrane and adopt a type I (carboxyl-terminal cytoplasmic tail) or type II (amino-terminal cytoplasmic tail) topology is not fully understood (20Wilkinson B.M. Regnacq M. Stirling C.J. J. Membr. Biol. 1997; 155: 189-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). It is generally thought that type I and II transmembrane proteins are targeted to the ER and then inserted and anchored in the membrane via a process involving signal-anchor sequences located in the hydrophobic amino acids of the transmembrane domains. However, we found that the transmembrane domain of SR-A (SR-AΔ1–55) was not sufficient for the post-transcriptional processing of SR-A. Retaining the membrane-proximal amino acids of the cytoplasmic tail (SR-AΔ1–49) restored intracellular processing and trafficking to the cell surface. Three of the six retained SR-A membrane-proximal amino acids (KLKSFK) are positively charged. Charged membrane-proximal amino acids have been shown to affect the topology of transmembrane proteins (21Spiess M. FEBS Lett. 1995; 369: 76-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Thus, the membrane-proximal charged residues might be critical during ER membrane insertion of SR-A. However, replacing the cytoplasmic tail of SR-A with that of the transferrin receptor (TfR/SR-A), omitting a similar charged membrane-proximal domain, was sufficient for protein expression, glycosylation, and oligomerization in the ER, but not for ER to Golgi trafficking. Therefore, the membrane-proximal amino acids of SR-A are specifically required for trafficking from ER to the Golgi. After translocation of the carboxyl-terminal extracellular domains into the ER, the monomeric SR-A protein is N-linked glycosylated and the glycosylated monomers assemble into trimers. These “precursor” SR-A trimers are transported through the Golgi apparatus, where further processing of the N-linked oligosaccharides converts the EndoH-sensitive precursor into the EndoH-resistant mature form that is expressed on the cell surface. The mechanism by which proteins traffic from the ER to Golgi remains controversial (22Klumperman J. Curr. Opin. Cell. Biol. 2000; 12: 445-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). The bulk-flow model proposes that proteins are transported from the ER to the Golgi by default. In contrast, the selective export model proposes that proteins are selectively exported based on the presence of ER-export signals (23Gorelick F.S. Shugrue C. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 2001; 177: 13-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Several cytosolic proteins are involved in trafficking of newly synthesized transmembrane proteins. Thus, the membrane-proximal amino acids might provide a critical recognition site for proteins involved in selective ER export. Although SR-AΔ1–49 was expressed primarily on the cell surface, SR-AΔ1–49 failed to internalize ligand. A well defined internalization motif is not present in the cytoplasmic tail of SR-A. However, Morimoto et al. (17Morimoto K. Wada Y. Hinagata J. Imanishi T. Kodama T. Doi T. Biol. Pharm. Bull. 1999; 22: 1022-1026Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) have suggested that a single motif, VXFD, is required for both SR-A internalization and cell-surface localization. In contrast, our results show that the membrane-proximal amino acids are sufficient for cell-surface localization, but that receptor internalization depends on a distinct motif, possibly the VXFD motif. It has been hypothesized that SR-A-mediated adhesion and internalization are regulated by the same mechanism and that SR-A-mediated adhesion results from the attempt to internalize an immobilized ligand (13Fong L.G. Le D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36808-36816Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The inability to separate SR-A-mediated adhesion from ligand internalization using various approaches supports this hypothesis (8Fraser I. Hughes D. Gordon S. Nature. 1993; 364: 343-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar, 9el Khoury J. Thomas C.A. Loike J.D. Hickman S.E. Cao L. Silverstein S.C. J. Biol.

For example, structure-function studies have shown that SR-A-mediated adhesion depends on the same region in the extracellular collagen-like domain that mediates binding of soluble ligands during internalization (11Gowen B.B. Borg T.K. Ghaffar A. Mayer E.P. J. Leukocyte Biol. 2001; 69: 575-582PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast to data supporting a common mechanism for adhesion and internalization, we recently showed that clathrin does not co-localize with SR-A in the filopodia-like projections associated with the enhanced adhesion of SR-A expressing cells (14Post S.R. Gass C. Rice S. Nikolic D. Crump H. Post G.R. J. Lipid Res. 2002; 43: 1829-1836Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). This observation provided indirect evidence that SR-A-mediated adhesion is a process that is distinct from clathrin-coated pit internalization. The results of the current study demonstrating that SR-A-mediated adhesion and internalization require distinct domains of the receptor provide direct evidence to support this hypothesis. The mechanism by which SR-A mediates cell adhesion remains unclear. It has been shown that SR-A-mediated adhesion involves changes in the actin cytoskeleton and the formation of focal adhesions. The ability of SRAΔ1–49 to enhance cell adhesion suggests that the membrane-proximal amino acids of SR-A are sufficient to mediate these processes. Likewise, the cytoplasmic membrane-proximal amino acids of the adhesion molecule L1 have been shown to be sufficient for association of this receptor with the cytoskeleton (24Dahlin-Huppe K. Berglund E.O. Ranscht B. Stallcup W.B. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 1997; 9: 144-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Thus, the membrane-proximal amino acids of SR-A might be a binding site for cytosolic proteins involved in formation of focal adhesions. SR-A-mediated adhesion may have important physiological roles, particularly at sites of tissue inflammation. For example, we recently demonstrated a role of SR-A-mediated adhesion in an in vivo model of inflammation using SR-A overexpressing mice (25Daugherty A. Kosswig N. Cornicelli J.A. Whitman S.C. Wolle S. Rateri D.L. J. Lipid Res. 2001; 42: 1049-1055Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Macrophage-specific SR-A overexpression enhanced granuloma formation after subcutaneous injection of carrageenan. Enhanced granuloma formation was associated with an increase in macrophage numbers suggesting that SR-A enhanced macrophage recruitment and/or retention. SR-A mediates adhesion specifically to modified extracellular matrix proteins such as collagen types I, III, and IV (9el Khoury J. Thomas C.A. Loike J.D. Hickman S.E. Cao L. Silverstein S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10197-10200Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Gowen B.B. Borg T.K. Ghaffar A. Mayer E.P. Matrix Biol. 2000; 19: 61-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Such modifications of the extracellular matrix may occur during certain pathophysiological conditions such as hyperglycemia or inflammation. Recently, SR-A also has been shown to mediate adhesion to proteoglycans of the extracellular matrix that are present in atherosclerotic lesions (12Santiago-Garcia J. Kodama T. Pitas R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 6942-6946Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Furthermore, SR-A-mediated adhesion of microglial cells to β-amyloid fibrils might play a role in Alzheimer's disease (26El Khoury J. Hickman S.E. Thomas C.A. Cao L. Silverstein S.C. Loike J.D. Nature. 1996; 382: 716-719Crossref PubMed Scopus (671) Google Scholar). Thus, SR-A-mediated adhesion might be a mechanism of macrophage retention specifically at sites of tissue injury associated with inflammation. In summary, we have shown that the cytoplasmic amino acids proximal to the membrane are required for SR-A posttranslational processing and play a critical role in SR-A trafficking to the cell surface. Furthermore, these amino acids were sufficient for SR-A-mediated adhesion, but not for ligand internalization. These are the first data to demonstrate that SR-A-mediated adhesion and internalization require distinct cytoplasmic domains and therefore must be distinct cellular processes. The development of a SR-A mutant such as SRAΔ1–49 that specifically mediates cell adhesion will make it possible to specifically study the role of SR-A-mediated adhesion in various physiological and pathophysiological processes.

Pathogenic bacteria such as Neisseriae meningitidis also produce heme oxygenase as part of a mechanism to mine host iron. The key step in heme oxidation is the regioselective oxidation of the heme α-meso-carbon by an activated Fe(III)-OOH complex. The structures of various diatomic ligands bound to the heme iron can mimic the dioxygen complex and provide important insights on the mechanism of O2 activation. Here we report the crystal structures of N. meningitidis heme oxygenase (nm-HO) in the Fe(II), Fe(II)-CO, and Fe(II)-NO states and compare these to the NO complex of human heme oxygenase-1 (Lad, L., Wang, J., Li, H., Friedman, J., Bhaskar, B., Ortiz de Montellano, P. R., and Poulos, T. L. (2003) J. Mol. Biol. 330, 527–538). Coordination of NO or CO results in a reorientation of Arg-77 that enables Arg-77 to participate in an active site H-bonded network involving a series of water molecules. One of these water molecules directly H-bonds to the Fe(II)-linked ligand and very likely serves as the proton source required for oxygen activation. Although the active site residues differ between nm-HO and human HO-1, the close similarity in the H-bonded water network suggests a common mechanism shared by all heme oxygenases.

Because of part of the toxicity of free heme, it is necessary for a number of organisms to degrade heme to harmless products that can be readily excreted. In mammals, heme is converted in a series of enzymatic steps to the glucuronidated form of bilirubin, which is readily excreted. Heme oxygenase (HO) 1The abbreviations used are: HO, heme oxygenase; HO-1, mammalian HO isozyme 1; nm-HO, N. meningitidis heme oxygenase; heme, Fe-protoporyphyrin IX.1The abbreviations used are: HO, heme oxygenase; HO-1, mammalian HO isozyme 1; nm-HO, N. meningitidis heme oxygenase; heme, Fe-protoporyphyrin IX. initiates this process by catalyzing the oxidation of free heme to biliverdin. Biliverdin reductase next reduces biliverdin to bilirubin (1Dore S. Takahashi M. Ferris C.D. Hester L.D. Guastella D. Snyder S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 2445-2450Crossref PubMed Scopus (616) Google Scholar) followed by glucuronidation of bilirubin by UDP-glucuronosyltransferase (2Ciotti M. Cho J.W. George J. Owens I.S. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 11018-11025Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Two human isoforms of HO have been identified to date. HO-1 is a 32-kDa protein, which is anchored to the microsomal membrane through a C-terminal hydrophobic tail (3Keyse S.M. Tyrrell A.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 99-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (1102) Google Scholar). HO-1 is found at highest levels in the spleen where recycling of erythrocytes takes place but may also function as a cytoprotective molecule against oxidative stress, because biliverdin and its reduced form, bilirubin, may work as potent physiological antioxidants (1Dore S.

Iron is a necessary nutrient required for the survival of most pathogenic bacteria, and the ability of these bacteria to acquire sufficient amounts of iron during infection is essential for such pathogens to propagate disease. Currently, the most studied heme assimilation systems are those of Gram-negative bacteria (16Schryvers A.B. Stojiljkovic I. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 32: 1117-1123Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). These bacteria express highly specific outer membrane receptors that bind different heme-containing compounds, extract heme from these compounds, and then transport heme into the bacterial cytoplasm (17Stojiljkovic I. Larson J. Hwa V. Anic S. So M. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 4670-4678Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Stojiljkovic I. Srinivasan N. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 805-812Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the Gram-negative bacterium N. meningitidis, a heme oxygenase (nm-HO) also is necessary for use of iron from imported heme and appears to be transcriptionally linked with an outer membrane heme receptor (11Zhu W. Hunt D.J. Richardson A.R. Stojiljkovic I. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 439-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Besides being essential in iron assimilation, nm-HO protects N. meningitidis from heme toxicity by degradation of heme (12Zhu W. Wilks A. Stojiljkovic I. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 6783-6790Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar).The overall HO reaction involves a complex sequence of transformations that consumes 3 molecules of O2 and 7 electrons (Fig. 1). The first electron reduces the ferric heme iron to the ferrous state, which is then followed by binding of a O2 molecule to form a Fe(II)-O2 complex. The addition of a second electron and one proton to the oxy complex generates a reactive hydroperoxy intermediate, Fe(III)-OOH. The specific proton donor and mechanism of O2 activation in nm-HO is currently unknown. Furthermore, unlike P450s and peroxidases, heme oxygenases do not utilize a Fe(IV)-O oxyferryl intermediate as the active hydroxylating species but instead utilize the electrophilic Fe(III)-OOH hydroperoxy intermediate (19Davydov R.M.

Of particular interest in the HO reaction cycle is the control of regioselectivity such that only the α-meso-heme position is oxygenated. This differs from the nonenzymatic oxygenation of heme in which all four meso-carbons are oxidized with approximately equal frequency. The current working hypothesis is that the heme oxygenase active site prevents the oxidation of all of the meso-heme positions with the exception of the α-meso-position because this heme edge is the most accessible. Furthermore, hydrogen-bonding interactions within the active site may help to orient molecular oxygen toward the α-meso-carbon. Important insights have been gained in HO function by solution of the human HO-1 (22Schuller D.J. Wilks A. de Montellano P.R.O. Poulos T.L. Nat. Struct.

Unfortunately, stability of the oxy-complex precludes the ready determination of the crystal structure. Of the other two common Fe(II) ligands, CO and NO, NO is the best molecular mimic for O2 binding. Both O2 and NO prefer a bent geometry, whereas CO prefers a linear geometry when bound to Fe(II) porphyrins (25Collman J.P. Brauman J.I. Halbert T.R. Suslick K.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Moreover, high resolution structures of globins complexed with O2 and NO show very similar binding geometries and local interactions in the heme pocket (29Brucker E.A. Olson J.S. Ikeda-Saito M. Phillips G.N. Proteins. 1998; 30: 352-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). As a result, we chose the NO complex as the best molecular mimic for the oxy-complex and the present paper describes the structure of the NO and CO complexes of Fe(II)-nm-HO.MATERIALS AND METHODSExpression of nm-HO—The Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) strain carrying pWMZ1651 (hemO) was grown overnight at 37 °C in 10 ml of LB medium containing 100 mg/liter ampicillin. The culture was used to inoculate 1 liter of fresh LB-ampicillin media and grown at 37 °C to a final A 600 = 0.6–0.8. Expression was induced by the addition of isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside to a final concentration of 1 mm. The cells were grown further for 4 h at 28–30 °C and harvested by centrifugation (5500 rpm for 15 min). The resulting cell pellet was green due to the conversion of endogenous E. coli heme to biliverdin by the expressed nm-HO protein.Purification of nm-HO—The cell pellet was resuspended in 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.8) containing 1 mm EDTA and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and was allowed to stir at 4 °C for 1 h. Post-stirring cells were lysed by sonication for 1 min for 4–5 times and centrifuged at 18,000 rpm for 1 h. The soluble fraction was applied to a Sepharose-Q Fast Flow column previously equilibrated with 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6). The column was washed with three volumes of 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), and the protein was eluted in the same buffer using a linear gradient of NaCl from 0 to 500 mm. The protein elutes at a concentration of 150–200 mm NaCl, and the peak fractions were pooled together based on SDS-PAGE analysis.Reconstitution of nm-HO with Heme—The purified protein was dialyzed against 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6) (2 × 4 liters) at 4 °C followed by reconstitution with a 2.0–2.5 molar excess of hemin, which produces the nm-HO-heme complex. The sample was then applied to a Sepharose-Q Fast Flow column previously equilibrated with 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6). The column was washed with three volumes of 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), and the protein was eluted in the same buffer using a linear gradient of NaCl from 0 to 500 mm. Peak fractions were pooled together based on the highest absorbance ratios at 406/280 nm. The pooled fractions were dialyzed against 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6) (2 × 4 liters) and then further purified by S-100 gel filtration chromatography. The nm-HO protein was concentrated by Amicon filtration unit and stored at –80 °C.Crystal Growth—Optimized conditions for crystallization consisted of vapor diffusion with the reservoir containing 0.1 m Tris-HCl (pH 8.5), 0.2 m sodium acetate, and 32.5% poly(ethylene glycol) 3350, and sitting drops consisted of 5 μl reservoir buffer and 5 μl protein stock at 23 mg/ml. Crystals grew within 7 days at room temperature. Single crystals were immediately frozen in a stream of nitrogen, and data were collected using a R-AXIS IV image plate detector. The crystals belong to tetragonal space group P43212 with cell dimensions of a = b = 63.17 Å, c = 100.38 Å with 1 molecule/asymmetric unit.Generation of NO-Bound nm-HO Complex—Crystals of nm-HO were subjected to anaerobic treatment by cycling between extensive degassing and purging with pure N2 gas for 30–60 min. Fresh dithionite and sodium nitrite solutions were made with degassed water in sealed serum vials. NO-bound crystals were prepared by soaking with 10 mm dithionite and 5 mm sodium nitrite for 30 min inside a glove box before being flash-frozen for data collections.Generation of CO-bound nm-HO Complex—Crystals of nm-HO were soaked with freshly prepared 10 mm dithionite and then placed in a CO high pressure cell (Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Laboratory, beamline 1–5) and incubated at 65 p.s.i. for 10–15 min. The cell was depressurized for 10 s, and the CO-bound crystals were flash-frozen for data collections.Data Collection—All of the data were collected using an in-house R-AXIS IV imaging plate detector equipped with a rotating copper anode x-ray generator with Osmic optics. Crystals were maintained at –160 °C in a stream of nitrogen (Crystal Logic, Los Angeles, CA). Data sets consisted of 130 frames with a ϕ-rotation of 1°/frame. High resolution data of the NO-bound nm-HO complex were collected using a single crystal at the Advanced Light Source (Berkeley, CA) beamline 5.0.2. Data were integrated and scaled with DENZO and SCALEPACK (30Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref Scopus (38355) Google Scholar) with rejections performed using ENDHKL (Louis Sanchez, California Institute of Technology) in conjunction with SCALEPACK.Model Building and Refinement—All of the structures were determined by the molecular replacement method using CNS (31Brunger A.T.

Protein atoms were initially refined by simulated annealing followed by a few cycles of conjugate gradient minimization, water picking, and temperature factor refinement. The program O (32Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13003) Google Scholar) was used for further adjustment and modeling of protein atoms, ligands, and water molecules. All of the refinements were done with CNS. Backbone geometry was checked in PROCHECK (33Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Thornton J.M. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1998; 8: 631-639Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar), and none of the residues was in the disallowed region. The Fe-ligand distances and geometry were not restrained during refinement.

Open table in a new tab RESULTSReduced Fe(II) Structure—Unlike human HO-1 where the distal helix moves closer to the heme upon reduction (34Lad L. Wang J. Li H. Friedman J. Bhaskar B. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. Poulos T.L. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 330: 527-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), there is little change in structure in nm-HO upon reduction from Fe(III) to Fe(II). The only significant change is that the distal water ligated in the Fe(III) structure is absent in the Fe(II) structure.CO and NO Fe(II) Complexes—2Fo – Fc omit electron density maps around the heme pockets are shown in Fig. 2. The CO complex appears not to have fully formed, and during refinement, the CO ligand was best modeled at 0.5 occupancy. The CO and NO ligand exhibit distinctly different geometries. The Fe-X-O angle in the NO complex is ∼150° while that for the CO complex is ∼170°. This observation is consistent with what is expected for these ligands coordinated to Fe(II) heme (26Spiro T.G.

The nm-HO NO and CO complexes are very similar with the exception that the natural tendency of NO to bend enables the NO to form a better H-bond with Wat1. Given the similarity between O2 and NO, it is very likely that the oxy and hydroperoxy complexes form a similar H-bonded network. The water network is similar in the HO-1-NO complex with the exception that the key side chains participating in the H-bonded network are different. Arg-77 and Asn-118 in nm-HO correspond to Arg-85 and Asp-140 in HO-1. As shown in Fig. 3, Asp-140 participates directly in the H-bonded network in HO-1 while in nm-HO Arg-77 serves this function. In addition, a conformational change is required to position Arg-77 for H-bonding to Wat3. Arg-77 and Asn-118 occupy two alternate conformations. In the Fe(III) and Fe(II) states, Arg-77 is in the “up” position pointing away from the heme. In the Fe(II)-CO and Fe(II)-NO complexes, Arg-77 moves to the “down” position where it participates in the active site H-bonded network (Fig. 4). In order for Arg-77 to move to the down position, Asn-118 must also move to avoid steric crowding. In the nm-HO Fe(II) structure, the electron density for Arg-77 is weak precluding precise positioning of the side chain. However, the electron density for Asn-118 is well defined, and because Arg-77 cannot point down with Asn-118 positioned as shown in the Fe(II) structure (Figs. 2A and 3A), we assume that Arg-77 must point up in the Fe(II) structure. Therefore, it appears that ligand binding triggers a set of conformational changes that forms a rigid H-bonded network involving Ser-117, Arg-77, and three ordered solvent molecules. The solvent molecules also must rearrange upon ligation. For example, Wat3 moves approximately 3 Å in the NO and CO complexes while Wat1 and Wat2 move less than 1 Å. As in HO-1, a combination of steric effects and H-bonding to ordered solvent helps bend the ligand toward the α-meso-heme carbon, which accounts for why both HO-1 and nm-HO hydroxylate only the α-meso-carbon.Fig. 3Diagram indicating the active site hydrogen-bonding network for Fe(II)-nm-HO (A), NO-bound Fe(II)-nm-HO (B), CO-bound Fe(II)-nm-HO (C), and NO-bound human HO-1 (D).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Fig. 4Distal pocket of reduced Fe(II)-nm-HO (A), NO-bound Fe(II)-nm-HO (B), and CO-bound Fe(II)-nm-HO (C).

The picture that emerges is very similar to that of human and rat HO-1 (36Sugishima M. Sakamoto H. Higashimoto Y. Omata Y. Hayashi S. Noguchi M. Fukuyama K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 45086-45090Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). It now appears that a common feature of HOs is to establish a rigid network of distal pocket H-bonded water molecules that ensures proper proton delivery to the distal O atom of the iron bound O2 ligand. Furthermore, these H-bonds coupled with steric factors bend the ligand toward the α-meso-heme carbon for regioselective hydroxylation. Further steric control is provided by the distal pocket masking all but the α-meso-carbon from electrophilic attack by the Fe(III)-OOH intermediate.Of the most studied HOs, human and rat HO-1 and cd-HO from C. diphtheriae, nm-HO is the outlier. nm-HO has the least conserved distal pocket environment and has Asn-118 in place of the catalytically essential Asp-140 in HO-1. As a result, the side chains participating in the distal pocket H-bonded network are different in nm-HO than in human HO-1 (Fig. 3). This clearly illustrates that the precise identity of the side chains is not a critical factor in controlling HO activity. Furthermore, the precise charge of side chains also appears not to be important. In HO-1, Asp-140 H-bonds with Wat1 while Ser-117 serves this function in nm-HO. Moreover, in nm-HO, movement in the side chain of Arg-77 is triggered upon ligand binding and may be required for the activation of O2. Interestingly, HO-1 also has a homologous Arg (Arg-85) but Arg-85 in HO-1 remains fixed in place in the Fe(III), Fe(II), and Fe(II)-NO structures (34Lad L. Wang J. Li H. Friedman J. Bhaskar B. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. Poulos T.L. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 330: 527-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). A common feature between HO-1 and nm-HO is Wat1, which directly H-bonds to the distal ligand. We suggest that the key to HO activity is the proper H-bonding donor/acceptor relationship and polarization of Wat1 such that Wat1 serves as a proton donor to dioxygen (Fig. 5). Stabilization of the hydroperoxy intermediate also is critical to allow electrophilic attack on the α-meso-heme carbon as opposed to cleavage of the peroxide O–O bond. It now is known that altering the H-bonded network by mutating Asp-140 to Ala converts HO-1 into a peroxidase (37Lightning L.K. Huang H. Moenne-Loccoz P. Loehr T.M. Schuller D.J. Poulos T.L. de Montellano P.R.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10612-10619Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), very likely because the proper H-bond donor/acceptor relationship has been perturbed, resulting in a less stable hydroperoxy intermediate. Thus, the present crystal structures strongly suggest that O2 binding induces conformational changes in the side chains of Arg-77 and Asn-118, which creates a new hydrogen-bonding network involving Wat3 that is necessary for the proper formation and stabilization of the active heme-hydroxylating species, Fe(III)-OOH. Furthermore, as with HO-1, regioselectivity of heme oxygenation by nm-HO is primarily controlled by steric strain, because Ser-117 and Gly-120 both block access to all of the meso-positions with the exception of the α-meso-carbon.Fig. 5Proposed mechanism for the activation of O2 and hydroxylation of heme in nm-HO.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Because of part of the toxicity of free heme, it is necessary for a number of organisms to degrade heme to harmless products that can be readily excreted.

Biliverdin reductase next reduces biliverdin to bilirubin (1Dore S. Takahashi M. Ferris C.D. Hester L.D. Guastella D. Snyder S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 11018-11025Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Two human isoforms of HO have been identified to date. HO-1 is a 32-kDa protein, which is anchored to the microsomal membrane through a C-terminal hydrophobic tail (3Keyse S.M. Tyrrell A.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 99-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (1102) Google Scholar). HO-1 is found at highest levels in the spleen where recycling of erythrocytes takes place but may also function as a cytoprotective molecule against oxidative stress, because biliverdin and its reduced form, bilirubin, may work as potent physiological antioxidants (1Dore S.

https://openalex.org/W2070663444,"Retroviral resistance to AZT and 3TC has been associated with two different mechanisms. The M184V mutation in the reverse transcriptase (RT) of the human immunodeficiency virus, type 1 (HIV-1) diminishes the incorporation of 3TC-monophosphate (3TC-MP), whereas AZT resistance-conferring mutations were shown to facilitate the phosphorolytic excision of incorporated AZT-MP in the presence of ATP. Both mechanisms show a certain degree of incompatibility; however, previous clinical data revealed that mutations E44D and V118I, when present in a background of classical AZT mutations (M41L, D67N, L210W, and T215Y), confer dual resistance to AZT and 3TC. We have purified RT enzymes that contain E44D and V118I either alone or in a background of different combinations of AZT mutations to study the underlying biochemical mechanisms. We found that enzymes containing E44D in a background of these latter mutations increase the efficiency of excision of 3TC-MP. Unexpectedly, V118I-containing enzymes show dramatic reductions in rates of incorporation of AZT-MP and 3TC-MP. The V118I mutant is also associated with diminished rates of ATP-dependent primer unblocking. The additional presence of mutations M41L, D67N, L210W, and T215Y can partially neutralize this deficit, which helps to explain the concurrent presence of these changes in resistant isolates. These biochemical data make clear that mutations E44D and V118I play distinct mechanistic roles in dual resistance to AZT and 3TC. Our findings are consistent with an increasing number of clinical studies suggesting that the V118I cluster constitutes a novel pathway for HIV resistance to multiple nucleotide analogue RT inhibitors."
https://openalex.org/W1967363601,"The flux of fatty acids toward β-oxidation was analyzed in Saccharomyces cerevisiae by monitoring polyhydroxyalkanoate synthesis in the peroxisome from the polymerization, by a bacterial polyhydroxyalkanoate synthase, of the β-oxidation intermediates 3-hydroxyacyl-CoAs. Synthesis of polyhydroxyalkanoate was dependent on the β-oxidation enzymes acyl-CoA oxidase and enoyl-CoA hydratase/3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase multifunctional protein, which are involved in generating 3-hydroxyacyl-CoAs, and on the peroxin PEX5, which is involved in the import of proteins into the peroxisome. In wild type cells grown in media containing fatty acids, the polyhydroxyalkanoate monomer composition was largely influenced by the nature of the external fatty acid, such that even-chain monomers are generated from oleic acid and odd-chain monomers are generated from heptadecenoic acid. In contrast, polyhydroxyalkanoate containing predominantly 3-hydroxyoctanoate, 3-hydroxydecanoate, and 3-hydroxydodecanoate was synthesized in a mutant deficient in the peroxisomal 3-ketothiolase (fox3Δ0) growing either on oleic acid or heptadecenoic acid as well as in wild type and fox3Δ0 mutants grown on glucose or raffinose, indicating that 3-hydroxyacyl-CoAs used for polyhydroxyalkanoate synthesis were generated from the degradation of intracellular short- and medium-chain fatty acids by the β-oxidation cycle. Inhibition of fatty acid biosynthesis with cerulenin blocked the synthesis of polyhydroxyalkanoate from intracellular fatty acids but still enabled the use of extracellular fatty acids for polymer production. Mutants affected in the synthesis of lipoic acid showed normal polyhydroxyalkanoate synthesis capacity. Together, these results uncovered the existence of a substantial futile cycle whereby short- and medium-chain intermediates of the cytoplasmic fatty acid biosynthetic pathway are directed toward the peroxisomal β-oxidation pathway. The flux of fatty acids toward β-oxidation was analyzed in Saccharomyces cerevisiae by monitoring polyhydroxyalkanoate synthesis in the peroxisome from the polymerization, by a bacterial polyhydroxyalkanoate synthase, of the β-oxidation intermediates 3-hydroxyacyl-CoAs.

In wild type cells grown in media containing fatty acids, the polyhydroxyalkanoate monomer composition was largely influenced by the nature of the external fatty acid, such that even-chain monomers are generated from oleic acid and odd-chain monomers are generated from heptadecenoic acid. In contrast, polyhydroxyalkanoate containing predominantly 3-hydroxyoctanoate, 3-hydroxydecanoate, and 3-hydroxydodecanoate was synthesized in a mutant deficient in the peroxisomal 3-ketothiolase (fox3Δ0) growing either on oleic acid or heptadecenoic acid as well as in wild type and fox3Δ0 mutants grown on glucose or raffinose, indicating that 3-hydroxyacyl-CoAs used for polyhydroxyalkanoate synthesis were generated from the degradation of intracellular short- and medium-chain fatty acids by the β-oxidation cycle. Inhibition of fatty acid biosynthesis with cerulenin blocked the synthesis of polyhydroxyalkanoate from intracellular fatty acids but still enabled the use of extracellular fatty acids for polymer production. Mutants affected in the synthesis of lipoic acid showed normal polyhydroxyalkanoate synthesis capacity. Together, these results uncovered the existence of a substantial futile cycle whereby short- and medium-chain intermediates of the cytoplasmic fatty acid biosynthetic pathway are directed toward the peroxisomal β-oxidation pathway. Polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA) 1The abbreviations used are: PHA, polyhydroxyalkanoate; CTA, catalase; FAS, fatty acid synthase; GPD, glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase.1The abbreviations used are: PHA, polyhydroxyalkanoate; CTA, catalase; FAS, fatty acid synthase; GPD, glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. is a family of polyesters composed primarily of R-3-hydroxyalkanoic acids (1Anderson A.J.

PHA is synthesized as intracellular inclusions by a wide variety of bacteria, including Gram-positive and Gram-negative species, and is used as a carbon and electron sink. PHAs have properties of thermoplastics and elastomers, and are regarded as an attractive source of renewable and biodegradable polyesters (1Anderson A.J. Dawes E.A. Microbiol. Rev. 1990; 54: 450-472Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Steinbüchel A. Füchtenbusch B.

Nawrath C. Somerville C. Biotechnology. 1995; 13: 142-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar). Pseudomonads, such as Pseudomonas oleovorans and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, typically synthesize PHA containing 3-hydroxyacids ranging from 6 to 14 carbons in length (2Steinbüchel A. Füchtenbusch B. Trends Biotechnol. 1998; 16: 419-427Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar, 3Kim Y.B. Lenz R.W. Adv. Biochem. Eng. Biotechnol. 2001; 71: 52-79Google Scholar). P. oleovorans can synthesize PHA when cells are grown on alkanoic acids as the carbon source (2Steinbüchel A. Füchtenbusch B. Trends Biotechnol. 1998; 16: 419-427Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar, 3Kim Y.B. Lenz R.W. Adv. Biochem. Eng. Biotechnol. 2001; 71: 52-79Google Scholar). The nature of the PHA produced is related to the substrate used for growth and is typically composed of monomers that are 2n (n ≥ 0) carbons shorter than the substrate. For example, growth of P. oleovorans on dodecanoate generates PHA containing 3-hydroxydodecanoic acid, 3-hydroxydecanoic acid, 3-hydroxyoctanoic acid, and 3-hydroxyhexanoic acid (5Lageveen R.G. Huisman G.W. Preusting H. Ketelaar P. Eggink G. Witholt B. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1988; 54: 2924-2932Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In these cells, PHA is synthesized by the PHA synthase from the polymerization of 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA intermediates generated by the β-oxidation of alkanoic acids. PHAs have also been produced in a number of recombinant eukaryotes, including insect cells (6Williams M.D. Rahn J.A. Sherman D.H. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1996; 62: 2540-2546Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), yeast (7Poirier Y. Erard N. MacDonald-Comber Petétot J. Appl. Environ.

Beyond its value as a biopolymer for commercial applications, PHA can be used as a valuable indicator of the flux of carbon through various metabolic pathways providing substrates for its synthesis. To date, this has been mostly exploited in transgenic Arabidopsis thaliana expressing the PHA synthase from P. aeruginosa in the peroxisome (14Mittendorf V. Robertson E.J. Leech R.M. Krüger N.

In these plants, PHA containing saturated and unsaturated 3-hydroxyalkanoic acids ranging from 6 to 16 carbons is synthesized during germination using intermediates of the β-oxidation of fatty acid derived from the degradation of triacylglycerides (14Mittendorf V. Robertson E.J. Leech R.M. Krüger N. Steinbüchel A. Poirier Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13397-13402Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Manipulation of the plant fatty acid composition, either through the use of mutants in fatty acid desaturases or by feeding external fatty acids, demonstrated that the PHA monomer composition adequately reflects both the nature and quantity of fatty acid directed toward peroxisomal β-oxidation (15Mittendorf V. Bongcam V. Allenbach L. Coullerez G. Martini N. Poirier Y. Plant J. 1999; 20: 45-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). From these initial studies, peroxisomal PHA was subsequently used to reveal the existence of a futile cycle of fatty acids in transgenic plants expressing a medium-chain fatty acyl-acyl carrier protein thioesterase in leaves or developing seeds (15Mittendorf V. Bongcam V. Allenbach L. Coullerez G. Martini N. Poirier Y. Plant J. 1999; 20: 45-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 16Poirier Y. Ventre G. Caldelari D. Plant Physiol. 1999; 121: 1359-1366Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) as well as in developing A. thaliana embryos deficient in the synthesis of triacylglycerides (16Poirier Y. Ventre G. Caldelari D. Plant Physiol. 1999; 121: 1359-1366Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The PHA monomer composition has also been used to analyze the pathway of degradation of unsaturated fatty acids in plants (17Allenbach L. Poirier Y. Plant Physiol. 2000; 124: 1159-1168Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Recently, the synthesis of PHA from intermediates of β-oxidation has been demonstrated in Saccharomyces cerevisiae expressing the PHA synthase from P. aeruginosa in the peroxisome (7Poirier Y. Erard N. MacDonald-Comber Petétot J. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2001; 67: 5253-5260Crossref Google Scholar). Growth of these recombinant S. cerevisiae in media containing oleic acid or heptadecenoic acid resulted in the accumulation of PHA containing either even-chain monomers from 6 to 14 carbons in length, or odd-chain monomers from 5 to 13 carbons, respectively (7Poirier Y. Erard N. MacDonald-Comber Petétot J. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2001; 67: 5253-5260Crossref Google Scholar). In an effort aimed at understanding the factors influencing the flux of fatty acids toward β-oxidation, we have examined PHA synthesis in mutants of S. cerevisiae affected in various enzymes involved in fatty acid metabolism. In this study, we show that the synthesis of PHA in the fox3Δ0 mutant deficient in the peroxisomal 3-ketothiolase reveals the presence of a substantial futile cycle of intermediates of the cytoplasmic fatty acid biosynthetic pathway toward peroxisomal β-oxidation in yeast growing in media containing various carbon sources. Strains and Culture Conditions—Plasmids were maintained and propagated in Escherichia coli DH5α according to Sambrook et al. (19Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Wild type S. cerevisiae strain BY4742 (matα his3Δ1 leu2Δ0 lys2Δ0 ura3Δ0) as well as the mutants fox1Δ0 (YGL205w::kanMX4), fox2Δ0 (YKR009c::kanMX4), fox3Δ0 (YIL160c::kanMX4), and pex5Δ0 (YDR244W::kanMX4), all derived from the strain BY4742, were obtained from EUROSCARF (www.uni-frankfurt.de/fb15/mikro/euroscarf/index.html). S. cerevisiae harboring the PHA synthase gene from P. aeruginosa was maintained in leucine-deficient media (0.67% yeast nitrogen base without amino acids (Difco, Detroit, MI), 0.5% ammonium sulfate, 2% glucose, and 0.69 grams/liter leucine drop-out supplement (Clontech) with or without 200 μg/ml gentamycin). For experiments analyzing PHA synthesis in cells growing on media containing fatty acids, a stationary phase culture was harvested by centrifugation, and cells were washed once in water and resuspended at a 1:10 dilution in fresh media containing 0.1% (w/v) glucose, 2% Pluronic F-127 (w/v) (Sigma), and 0.1% (v/v) fatty acids. Cells were grown for an additional 3–4 days before harvesting for PHA analysis. A similar protocol was used for cells grown on media containing carbohydrates, except that the cells were diluted 1:40 in leucine-deficient media supplemented with either 2% (w/v) glucose or 3% (w/v) raffinose. In some experiments, cerulenin (Sigma) was added at a final concentration of 25–50 μm, and fatty acids (oleic acid, palmitic acid, and tridecanoic acid) were added at concentrations between 0.005–0.01%. DNA Constructs—The PHAC1 synthase from P. aeruginosa was modified for peroxisomal targeting by the addition, at the carboxyl end of the protein, of the last 34 amino acids of the Brassica napus isocitrate lyase, as described previously (14Mittendorf V. Robertson E.J. Leech R.M. Krüger N. Steinbüchel A. Poirier Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13397-13402Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). The plasmid Yiplac128-PHA containing the modified PHAC1 gene is under the control of the S. cerevisiae catalase A (CTA1) promoter and terminator region, as described previously (7Poirier Y. Erard N. MacDonald-Comber Petétot J. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2001; 67: 5253-5260Crossref Google Scholar). To construct the plasmid CTA-PHA, the cassette containing the CTA1 promoter-PHAC1 synthase-CTA1 terminator was excised from Yiplac128-PHA and cloned into the replicative shuttle plasmid Yiplac111 (20Gietz R.D. Sugino A. Gene. 1988; 74: 527-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (2515) Google Scholar). In the plasmid GPD-PHA, the PHAC1 gene is under the control of the constitutive glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase promoter (21Mumberg D. Müller R. Funk M. Gene. 1995; 156: 119-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (1590) Google Scholar). This plasmid was constructed by first excising the PHA synthase along with the CTA1 terminator from the CTA-PHA plasmid with EcoRI and blunt-ended with Klenow DNA polymerase. The fragment was then subcloned into the vector p415-GPD (21Mumberg D. Müller R. Funk M. Gene. 1995; 156: 119-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (1590) Google Scholar) at the SmaI site. Plasmids were transferred into the various S. cerevisiae strains by the lithium acetate procedure (22Gietz D. St. Jean A. Woods R.A. Schiestl R.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 142Crossref PubMed Scopus (2887) Google Scholar), and transformants were recovered on media without leucine. Analysis of Fatty Acids and PHA—Analysis of fatty acids and PHA was performed essentially as described previously (7Poirier Y. Erard N. MacDonald-Comber Petétot J. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2001; 67: 5253-5260Crossref Google Scholar, 14Mittendorf V. Robertson E.J. Leech R.M. Krüger N. Steinbüchel A. Poirier Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13397-13402Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Synthesis of PHA in Wild Type and β-Oxidation Mutants of S. cerevisiae—Synthesis of PHA in cells expressing a peroxisomal PHA synthase from the plasmid CTA-PHA and grown on medium containing oleic acid was examined in wild type BY4742 cells as well as in three mutants having a deletion in the genes encoding the enzymes of the core peroxisomal β-oxidation cycle. These mutants were deficient either in the acyl-CoA oxidase (FOX1), the multifunctional protein (FOX2) possessing the 2-enoyl-CoA hydratase II and R-3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase activities, or the 3-ketothiolase (FOX3). Also used was a mutant deficient in the peroxin PEX5, which is involved in the import, into the peroxisomes, of proteins having a type 1 peroxisomal targeting signal, including FOX1, FOX2, and the modified PHA synthase. Wild type cells grown for 3 days on oleic acid produce ∼0.06% PHA (weight/dry weight) containing even-chain monomers from 6 to 14 carbons that are generated by the degradation of oleic acid via the peroxisomal β-oxidation cycle, namely the monomers H14:1, H14:0, H12:0, H10:0, H8:0 and H6:0 (3-hydroxy acid monomers are identified with the prefix H, followed by the number of carbons and the number of unsaturated bonds) (Fig. 1A). The presence of both 3-hydroxytetradecenoic acid (H14:1) and 3-hydroxytetradecanoic acid (H14:0) agrees with the generation of the corresponding acyl-CoA by the β-oxidation of fatty acids having a cis-unsaturated bond at an odd-numbered carbon (23Gurvitz A. Mursula A.M. Yagi A.I. Hartig A. Ruis H. Rottensteiner H. Hiltunen J.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24514-24521Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). No PHA was detected in the fox1Δ0, fox2Δ0, and pex5Δ0 mutants expressing the PHA synthase (data not shown). These results are in agreement with the fact that the 3-hydroxyacyl-CoAs used by the PHA synthase are generated by the peroxisomal β-oxidation pathway. Expression of the PHA synthase in the fox3Δ0 mutant resulted in the accumulation of ∼0.006% (weight/dry weight) of a PHA that contained only the monomers H8:0, H10:0, and H12:0 (Fig. 1B). These results were unexpected, because the only 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA that could be generated in the fox3Δ0 mutant from the degradation of the external oleic acid was 3-hydroxyoctadecenoyl-CoA, which is itself not a substrate for the PHA synthase because this enzyme in yeast accepts only 3-hydroxyacyl-CoAs between 5 and 14 carbons in length (7Poirier Y. Erard N. MacDonald-Comber Petétot J. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2001; 67: 5253-5260Crossref Google Scholar). PHA Synthesized in the fox3Δ0 Mutant Is Derived from Intracellular Short- and Medium-chain Fatty Acids—The presence of PHA in the fox3Δ0 mutant raised the question as to the source of the carbon that can generate peroxisomal 3-hydroxyacyl-CoAs from 8 to 12 carbons in length. Analysis of the synthetic media used to grow cells combined with experiments wherein external fatty acids were added to the growth media revealed that the level of contaminating fatty acids present in the growth media was at least one order of magnitude below the minimum level of fatty acids required to influence PHA synthesized fox3Δ0 cells (data not shown). Thus, contaminating fatty acid cannot explain the PHA synthesized in fox3Δ0 cells. The presence of an alternative 3-ketothiolase that could functionally complement the FOX3 enzyme and generate shorter-chain 3-hydroxyacyl-CoAs from oleic acid was examined. Wild type and fox3Δ0 cells expressing the peroxisomal PHA synthase were grown in media containing 0.1% oleic acid and 0.1% lauric acid. Wild type cells grown on both oleic and lauric acid produced 5-fold more PHA compared with cells grown only on oleic acid (Fig. 1C). The monomer composition of the PHA synthesized from the co-feeding was shifted toward shorter saturated monomers, with the H14:1 and H14 monomers becoming undetectable. This shift in monomer composition is explained by the fact that degradation of lauric acid will generate only even-chain saturated monomers equal to and lower than 12 carbons. In sharp contrast, the PHA synthesized in the fox3Δ0 cells grown on oleic and lauric acid was composed exclusively of the monomer 3-hydroxydodecanoic acid (Fig. 1D). Thus, although the external lauric acid was able to access the peroxisomal β-oxidation enzymes in fox3Δ0 cells, only 3-hydroxydodecanoyl-CoA could be generated from it, indicating the absence of an alternative to the FOX3 peroxisomal 3-ketothiolase for the generation of shorter 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA. Wild type cells expressing the PHA synthase and grown on media containing Δ10cis-heptadecenoic acid generated a PHA composed of the saturated odd-chain monomers H5:0, H7:0, H9:0, and H11:0, as well as the unsaturated monomer H13:1 (Fig. 2A). This monomer composition is in agreement with the pathway of degradation of fatty acids having a cis-unsaturated bond at an even-numbered carbon (24Hiltunen J.K. Filppula S.A. Koivuranta K.T. Siivari K. Qin Y.-M. Häyrinen H.-M. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1996; 804: 116-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Although H8:0, H10:0, and H12:0 monomers were also detectable in the PHA produced from these cells, their amount represent less than 0.5 mol %. Thus, in wild type cells fed with Δ10cis-heptadecenoic acid, the PHA monomers are primarily derived from the degradation of the external fatty acid. In contrast, the growth of fox3Δ0 cells on media containing Δ10cis-heptadecenoic acid resulted in a PHA containing only the monomers H8:0, H10:0, and H12:0, a composition unchanged relative to the growth of fox3Δ0 on oleic acid (Fig. 2B). These results indicated that the PHA synthesized in fox3Δ0 cells grown on Δ10cis-heptadecenoic acid cannot be derived from the degradation of the external fatty acids but rather must come from metabolically synthesized substrates. Furthermore, the absence, in the fox3Δ0 mutant, of a 3-ketothiolase that can function in the β-oxidation cycle means that any fatty acid that reaches the β-oxidation cycle in the fox3Δ0 mutant can only be converted to a 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA of equal chain length. Together, these results support the hypothesis that PHA synthesized in fox3Δ0 cells fed with either oleic acid or Δ10cis-heptadecenoic acid are derived from intracellular fatty acids or fatty acyl esters of 8, 10, and 12 carbons in length that reach the peroxisomal β-oxidation cycle. Synthesis of PHA in fox3Δ0 Cells Grown on Carbohydrates—In contrast to wild type, the fox3Δ0 mutant cannot utilize external fatty acids as a carbon source to grow because the β-oxidation pathway is blocked. Thus, fox3Δ0 cells grown in media containing 0.1% glucose and 0.1% oleic acid are essentially starved for carbon once the glucose is consumed. To assess whether the synthesis of PHA in fox3Δ0 cells was dependent on these particular growth conditions, the synthesis of PHA was monitored in cells grown on carbohydrates as the principal carbon source. Because the CTA1 promoter used in the CTA-PHA vector is activated by fatty acids but repressed by glucose (7Poirier Y. Erard N. MacDonald-Comber Petétot J. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2001; 67: 5253-5260Crossref Google Scholar, 25Skoneczny M. Chelstowska A. Rytka J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1988; 174: 297-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 26Hortner H. Ammerer G. Hartter E. Hamilton B. Rytka J. Bilinski T. Ruis H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1982; 128: 179-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), a new vector named GPD-PHA was constructed by putting the PHA synthase under the control of the constitutive glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase promoter. Western analysis of wild type cells transformed with the plasmid GPD-PHA revealed the expression of the PHA synthase to approximately the same level in cells grown in media containing either glucose, raffinose, or oleic acid (data not shown). Synthesis of PHA in wild type cells transformed with GPD-PHA and grown in media containing Δ10cis-heptadecenoic acid was essentially the same as that reported for the plasmid CTA-PHA, with the PHA being composed mainly of the odd-chain monomers H5:0, H7:0, H9:0, H11:0, and H13:1 (Fig. 2C). In contrast, fox3Δ0 cells transformed with GPD-PHA and grown in media containing Δ10cis-heptadecenoic acid produced a PHA containing only the H8, H10, and H12 monomers (Fig. 2D). Wild type and fox3Δ0 cells transformed with the plasmid GPD-PHA and grown for 4 days in media containing 2% glucose synthesize ∼0.01% (weight/dry weight) PHA (Fig. 3, A and B). The monomer composition for these two strains was similar and included the monomers H6:0, H8:0, H10:0, and H12:0. In contrast to glucose, raffinose does not repress the genes involved in β-oxidation (27Luo Y. Karpichev I.V. Kohanski R.A. Small G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12068-12075Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 28Veenhius M. Mateblowski M. Kunau W.H. Harder W. Yeast. 1987; 3: 77-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). Growth of cells for 4 days in media containing raffinose resulted in an ∼4-fold increase in PHA synthesized in fox3Δ0 and wild type cells compared with growth in media containing glucose, although the monomer composition remained similar for all treatments (Fig. 3, C and D). No PHA was detected in fox1Δ0, fox2Δ0, or pex5Δ0 cells transformed with the GPD-PHA plasmid and grown on raffinose. Together, these results demonstrate that, in cells growing on carbohydrates as the main carbon source, synthesis of PHA from intracellular fatty acids of 6, 8, 10, and 12 carbons occurs and requires a functional peroxisome and β-oxidation cycle. The Contribution of Pathways of Lipoic Acid and Fatty Acid Biosynthesis to Peroxisomal PHA—The synthesis of PHA in fox3Δ0 cells grown in media containing raffinose was monitored over 5 days (Fig. 4). The quantity of PHA per unit dry weight of cells remained relatively constant during the initial lag phase, decreased during the exponential growth phase, and increased during the stationary phase. These data indicate that PHA synthesis in fox3Δ0 still occurs when cells have ceased to divide and are in nutrient-limiting conditions. Although some PHA could also be synthesized during the exponential phase, the rate of PHA accumulation is lower than the rate of increase of the cell mass. The impact of inhibiting fatty acid biosynthesis on PHA production was tested in the fox3Δ0 strain. Cerulenin, an inhibitor of the fatty acid synthase (FAS) (29Omura S. Methods Enzymol. 1981; 72: 520-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), was added at 48 h in the exponential growth phase of a fox3Δ0 culture growing on raffinose. The addition of cerulenin limited growth of cells as observed by the lower density of the culture (Fig. 4). Furthermore, the addition of cerulenin quickly abolished the increase in PHA that was observed after 48 h in cultures growing without cerulenin. The effect of cerulenin on the monomer composition of synthesized PHA was also examined in fox3Δ0 cells that were grown in media containing 3% raffinose, 0.01% oleic acid, 0.005% palmitic acid, and 0.01% tridecanoic acid as well as with and without cerulenin. Oleic and palmitic acids were added as a source of fatty acids necessary for the synthesis of membrane lipids and the maintenance of cell growth after the addition of cerulenin. As shown in Fig. 5A, growth of fox3Δ0 cells in this complex medium containing a low amount of tridecanoic acid and without cerulenin lead to the synthesis of PHA containing the H13 monomer as well the H6, H8, H10, and H12 monomers. The addition of cerulenin resulted in a 9-fold increase in the proportion of the H13 monomer as well as a 4-fold reduction in the amount of PHA relative to cultures grown without cerulenin (Fig. 5B). These results are in agreement with the hypothesis that even-chain PHA monomers are derived from intermediates of the cerulenin-sensitive FAS, whereas the odd-chain H13 monomer is derived from the degradation of the external tridecanoic acid via the cerulenin-insensitive β-oxidation cycle. Furthermore, the overall decrease in PHA produced in cells grown in media with cerulenin and 0.01% tridecanoate would indicate that, in the absence of inhibitor, the contribution of the internal fatty acids derived from FAS to PHA synthesis was larger than the contribution of the external fatty acid. Lipoic acid is an eight-carbon fatty acid modified with sulfur insertion and synthesized via the FASII system present in the mitochondria. The contribution of the lipoic acid pathway to the generation of intracellular substrates for peroxisomal PHA synthesis was examined in the oar1 and cem1 mutants deficient in the mitochondrial FASII enzymes essential for lipoic acid synthesis (30Schneider R. Brors B. Bürger F. Camrath S. Weiss H. Curr. Genet. 1997; 32: 384-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 31Harington A. Herbert C.J. Tung B. Getz G.S. Slonimski P.P. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 9: 545-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). PHA synthesis in wild type and the oar1 and cem1 mutants transformed with the GPD-PHA construct and grown in media containing raffinose was similar in both quantity and monomer composition (data not shown), indicating that the mitochondrial FASII does not contribute to the flux of short- and medium-chain fatty acids toward the peroxisome β-oxidation pathway. S. cerevisiae cells expressing a PHA synthase from P. aeruginosa modified for peroxisomal targeting synthesize PHA derived from the R-3-hydroxyacyl-CoA intermediates of the β-oxidation pathway (7Poirier Y.

This is supported by the observation that deletion mutants in the acyl-CoA oxidase and the multifunctional protein, the first two enzymes of the β-oxidation pathway that are required for synthesis of R-3-hydroxyacyl-CoA, do not produce PHA. The requirement of a functional peroxisome is also indicated by the absence of PHA in the pex5Δ0 mutant deficient in the import, into the peroxisome, of proteins having a type 1 peroxisome targeting signal, including proteins such as FOX1, FOX2, and the PHA synthase. In cells grown in media containing an external fatty acid as the main source of carbon, PHA monomer composition is directly influenced by the nature of the external fatty acids. Thus, feeding with oleic acid yields a PHA containing even-chain monomers exclusively (Fig. 1A), whereas feeding with Δ10cis-heptadecenoic acid yields a PHA containing primarily odd-chain monomers (Fig. 2, A and C). These results indicate that, under these conditions, the main 3-hydroxyacyl-CoAs going into PHA are primarily derived from the β-oxidation of external fatty acids. The synthesis of PHA containing the H8:0, H10:0, and H12:0 monomers in the fox3Δ0 mutant grown on oleic acid (Fig. 1B) was surprising, because the only 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA that could be generated from oleic acid entering a β-oxidation cycle that is truncated at the 3-ketothiolase step would be 3-hydroxyoctadecenoyl-CoA, which is itself not a substrate for the PHA synthase. In contrast to wild type cells, PHA synthesized in fox3Δ0 cells grown in media containing Δ10cis-heptadecenoic acid does not contain any odd-chain monomers but rather the monomers H8:0, H10:0, and H12:0, indicating that the substrates for PHA synthesis in the fox3Δ0 mutants are not derived from the external fatty acids (Fig. 2, B and D). However, in fox3Δ0 cells grown in the presence of both oleic acid and lauric acid, PHA containing the H12:0 monomer exclusively is generated, a result expected if the main substrate entering the truncated β-oxidation cycle is derived from the external lauric acid (Fig. 1D). This demonstrates that, similar to wild type cells, fox3Δ0 cells are still competent to acquire fatty acids from the external media, target them to the peroxisome, and initiate their degradation through β-oxidation. Together, these results indicated that the 8-, 10-, and 12-carbon monomers found into PHA synthesized in fox3Δ0 cells grown on oleic and Δ10cis-heptadecenoic acids are derived from intracellular fatty acids (or fatty acyl-esters) of 8, 10, and 12 carbons. The monomer composition of the PHA synthesized in fox3Δ0 cells grown on media containing either fatty acids, glucose, or raffinose changed little with the exception of the presence of the additional H6:0 monomer only in cells grown on carbohydrates in addition to the H8:0, H10:0, and H12:0 monomer (Figs. 2 and 3). Furthermore, the monomer composition and quantity of PHA synthesized in wild type and fox3Δ0 cells grown on carbohydrates were remarkably similar. The absence of both the H14:1 and H14:0 in PHA from wild type cells grown on carbohydrates is important, because H14:1 is an indicator of the degradation of palmitoleic and oleic acids, whereas H14 is an indicator of the degradation of palmitic and stearic acids. These four fatty acids account for >98% of the fatty acid found in cells at either the exponential or stationary growth phase, whereas fatty acids of ≤14 carbons account for <2% (data not shown, and Ref. 32Tuller G. Nemec T. Hrastnik C. Daum G. Yeast. 1999; 15: 1555-1564Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). This indicates that, in wild type cells as well as fox3Δ0 grown on carbohydrates, the fatty acids that enter the peroxisomal PHA are not derived from the turnover of all fatty acids found in membranes but rather are enriched in short- and medium-chain fatty acids. The observation that the addition of cerulenin, a powerful inhibitor of FAS, inhibits the accumulation of PHA in cells grown on raffinose as well as increases the proportion of odd-chain monomers at the expense of even-chain monomers in cells grown in media containing tridecanoic acid indicates that the premature release of short- and medium-chain fatty acids from the FAS complex contributes to the overall carbon flux toward peroxisomal β-oxidation. Furthermore, the demonstration that a mutation in the pathway of mitochondrial lipoic acid biosynthesis did not affect PHA synthesis from glucose indicates that it is the cytoplasmic FAS complex that mainly contributes to this carbon flux. The amount of PHA synthesized in fox3Δ0 cells was influenced by the carbon source used for growth with the maximal amount obtained with raffinose (0.055% weight/dry weight), whereas glucose and oleic acid gave lower amounts (0.012 and 0.006% weight/dry weight, respectively). The increase of PHA in raffinose compared with glucose is likely to be due, at least in part, to the fact that in contrast to glucose, raffinose does not repress transcription of the genes of the β-oxidation cycle (27Luo Y. Karpichev I.V. Kohanski R.A. Small G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12068-12075Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 28Veenhius M. Mateblowski M. Kunau W.H. Harder W. Yeast. 1987; 3: 77-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). Although the β-oxidation genes should be fully activated in media containing oleic acid, the amount of PHA synthesized was lowest. One explanation for this could be that the 3-hydroxyoctadecenoyl-CoA produced in fox3Δ0 cells grown on oleic acid may inhibit the flux of intracellular short- and medium-chain fatty acids through the truncated β-oxidation cycle and thus decrease carbon flux to PHA. It is striking that the amount of PHA synthesized in wild type cells grown on raffinose (0.05% weight/dry weight; Fig. 3C), wherein the PHA is largely derived from intracellular short- and medium-chain fatty acids, is similar to or slightly lower than the amount of PHA synthesized in wild type cells grown either on oleic acid (0.06% weight/dry weight; Fig. 1A) or Δ10cis-heptadecenoic acid (0.14–0.18% weight/dry weight; Fig. 2, A and C), wherein the bulk of β-oxidation intermediates going into PHA are derived from the external fatty acids and where carbon flux through β-oxidation cycle is expected to be maximal because cells depend on it for growth. Although PHA synthesized in yeast peroxisomes may not be directly proportional to the carbon flux to the β-oxidation cycle under all growth conditions, these results nevertheless indicate that the flux of short- and medium-chain fatty acids derived from FAS toward peroxisomal β-oxidation is substantial and clearly larger than the turnover of long-chain fatty acids. The molecular mechanism responsible for this futile cycling of short- and medium-chain fatty acids in yeast is unclear at present. Fatty acids lower than 14 carbons are present only in trace amounts in yeast lipids, with the bulk of fatty acids being C16:0, C16:1, C18:0, and C18:1 (32Tuller G. Nemec T. Hrastnik C. Daum G. Yeast. 1999; 15: 1555-1564Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). In yeast, fatty acids are released from the FAS complex as acyl-CoAs by the malonyl/palmitoyl transferase domain of the β-subunit of FAS, which plays the dual role by loading malonyl substrate moieties in chain elongation and translocating the palmitoyl moieties to a CoA acceptor in chain termination (33Lynen F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1980; 112: 431-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Experiments with purified FAS from yeast indicated that the primary products released from the FAS complex in vitro are long-chain acyl-CoAs (34Singh N. Wakil S.J. Stoops J.K. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 6598-6602Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 35Schjerling C.K. Hummel R. Hansen J.K. Børsting C. Mikkelsen J.M. Kristiansen K. Knudsen J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22514-22521Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). However, it has also been demonstrated that the presence of the acyl-CoA binding protein ACBP1 in an in vitro reaction mixture results in an enhanced release of medium-chain acyl-CoAs from the FAS complex, indicating that the presence of other proteins or co-factors can greatly influence the distribution of fatty acyl-CoAs released from FAS (35Schjerling C.K.

The presence of a futile cycle of short- and medium-chain fatty acids in yeast may thus indicate that the release of short- and medium-chain acyl-CoAs from FAS in vivo is considerably larger than would be suspected from either in vitro experiments or fatty acid composition of lipids. Further experiments are required to determine whether this is specific to the FAS of yeast or whether it also applies to the FAS of plants and animals.

https://openalex.org/W2101495007,"RGS proteins regulate the duration of cell signaling by modulating the lifetime of activated G proteins. The specificity of RGS-G protein mutual recognition is critical for meeting unique timing requirements of numerous G protein-mediated pathways. Our study of two splice isoforms of RGS9 expressed in different types of neurons revealed a novel mechanism whereby this specificity is determined by specialized protein domains or subunits acting as affinity adapters. The long RGS9 isoform contains a C-terminal domain that provides high-affinity interaction with its target G protein. The lack of this domain in the short RGS9 isoform is compensated by the action of a G protein effector subunit that is structurally similar to this C-terminal domain. This allows the short isoform to specifically target the complex between the G protein and its effector. Thus, the specific timing needs of different signaling pathways can be accommodated by affinity adapters positioned at various pathway components."

Its ligand, prolactin, is secreted by the anterior pituitary gland but is also produced by extrapituitary sources, including the mammary gland and lymphoid cells (1Goffin V. Binart N. Touraine P. Kelly P.A. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2002; 64: 47-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). Prolactin is essential for the development and maturation of the mammary gland as well as for modulating the immune response (2Hennighausen L. Robinson G.W. Wagner K.U. Liu W. J. Biol.

Prolactin binding induces receptor dimerization, leading to auto-activation of associated Jak2 kinases. Jak2 then phosphorylates the receptor on tyrosine residues, thereby creating docking sites for various SH2 domain-containing cytoplasmic signaling molecules, the best studied of which are the signal transducer and activator of transcription (Stat) factors (6Ihle J.N. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 211-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (585) Google Scholar). Stat proteins are subsequently phosphorylated by Jak2, resulting in Stat dimerization and translocation to the nucleus where they bind to their target promoters. In addition to the Jak-Stat pathway, the PrlR engages other cytoplasmic kinases such as Src, Fyn, and Tec (7Clevenger C.V. Medaglia M.V. Mol.

The long form of the PrlR is the major functional isoform. In humans, an intermediate and several short isoforms have been characterized that share the same extracellular ligand binding and transmembrane domains as the long PrlR but vary in the length of their cytoplasmic tails (14Kline J.B.

These proteins are small acidic, ubiquitous proteins that recognize serine/threonine-phosphorylated residues in a context-specific manner (18Muslin A.J. Tanner J.W. Allen P.M. Shaw A.S.

Commercially available antibodies used were: V5-specific mouse monoclonal antibody (Invitrogen), Glu-Glu-specific mouse monoclonal antibody (Babco), 14-3-3-specific rabbit polyclonal antibody (Upstate Biotechnology), phosphotyrosine-specific mouse monoclonal antibody (clone 4G10) (Upstate Biotechnology), anti-phospho-Erk1/2 (T202/Y204) rabbit polyclonal antibody (New England Biolabs), anti-phospho-PKB (T308) rabbit polyclonal antibody (New England Biolabs), HA-specific rat monoclonal antibody (Roche Applied Science), anti-phospho-Stat5a/b (Y694/Y699) mouse monoclonal antibody (Upstate Biotechnology), anti-Stat5a rabbit antiserum (Upstate Biotechnology).Generation of Anti-phospho-Thr391 PrlR Antibody—The anti-phospho-Thr391-PrlR antibody was raised by immunizing New Zealand White rabbits with the GSKCS(pT)WPLP peptide conjugated to keyhole limpet hemocyanin. The antibody was first affinity purified with the immunizing peptide conjugated to Sepharose, and then non-phospho-specific antibodies were removed by adsorption to the non-phosphorylated peptide conjugated to Sepharose. The specificity of the affinity-purified anti-phospho-Thr391-PrlR antibody was verified by dot immunoblots against the immunizing phosphorylated peptide, the corresponding non-phosphorylated peptide, and an irrelevant phosphopeptide (CLG-PPHSR(pS)LPDILG). The peptides were synthesized by Mimotopes Pty. Ltd. (Clayton, Victoria, Australia).Cell Culture—SKBR3 and T47D cells were maintained in RPMI containing 10% fetal bovine serum (CSL) and 1 μg/ml insulin (Sigma). Cells were starved overnight in serum-free medium prior to stimulation with 1 μg/ml prolactin (kindly provided by G. Parlow). HC11 cells were grown in RPMI supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 10 ng/ml EGF (Sigma), and 5 μg/ml insulin. For in vitro differentiation, cells were grown to confluence and maintained for 3 days, after which they were incubated in growth medium lacking EGF for 24 h prior to stimulation with 5 μg/ml prolactin and 1 μm dexamethasone (Sigma). 293T and NIH3T3 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum. For transient transfections, 293T cells were transfected with FuGENE (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's instructions. NIH3T3 and HC11 pools stably expressing wild-type and T391A PrlR were generated by transfection followed by selection in 0.75 and 0.2 mg/ml neomycin, respectively. Treatment of cells with okadaic acid (ICN Biomedicals) was at 1 μm.Protein Extraction of Cells—Whole cell extracts were obtained by solubilizing cells in NEB (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 10 mm sodium fluoride, 20 mm β-glycerophosphate plus complete (Roche Applied Science) protease inhibitors). Lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 16,000 × g for 10 min.Bacterial Expression of GST-14-3-3ζ—An EcoRI-BamH1-cDNA encompassing the coding region of 14-3-3ζ was cloned into pGEX-2T. E299 bacteria transformed with this plasmid were used to produce a glutathione S-transferase 14-3-3ζ fusion protein (GST-14-3-3ζ). An overnight culture was used to inoculate a 500-ml culture that was grown to an optical density of 0.6–0.8 at 600 nm. GST-14-3-3ζ protein expression was then induced with 0.1 m isopropyl-β-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside for 3 h. Following induction, the bacterial cultures were harvested, and the pellets were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (150 mm NaCl, 16 mm Na2HPO4, 4 mm NaH2PO4, pH 7.3) and resuspended in 10 ml of phosphate-buffered saline containing 1% Triton X-100, 5 mm EDTA, 1% aprotinin, 1 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl chloride, and 1 μg/ml leupeptin. The suspension was then sonicated three times for 10 s on ice and the lysate centrifuged for 10 min at 8,000 × g. Purification of GST-14-3-3ζ was performed by mixing with glutathione resin (Sigma) for 1 h at 4 °C. The resin was washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline. The purity and amount of bound GST-14-3-3ζ was then determined by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie staining.GST Pulldowns, Immunoprecipitations, and Western Blotting—Pulldowns were performed by incubating protein lysates with GST or GST-14-3-3ζ coupled to glutathione beads for 2 h on ice. Beads were washed three times with NEB (see above). For immunoprecipitations, equal amounts of protein were incubated with specific antibodies for 2 h on ice. Immune complexes were collected with protein G-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) and washed three times with NEB. Precipitated proteins were released by boiling in sample buffer and were subjected to sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) using 4–20% gradient gels (Novex). The proteins were blotted onto polyvinylidine difluoride membranes (Millipore). After blocking with 20% horse serum (Hunter) in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween 20, filters were probed with specific antibodies. Proteins were visualized with peroxidase-coupled secondary antibody using the ECL detection system (Amersham Biosciences). Stripping of membranes was performed in SDS buffer (62.5 mm Tris, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 100 mm β-mercaptoethanol) for 30 min at 60 °C. Membranes were then reprobed with the indicated antibodies.Luciferase Reporter Assays—293T cells were grown in 6-well dishes and transfected with 0.25 μg each of wild-type PrlR or T391A PrlR and Gal4-Sap1a expression plasmids and the G5E4-luciferase reporter construct (22Urich M. Senften M. Shaw P.E. Ballmer-Hofer K. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 1235-1241Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). pRL-TK, a Renilla luciferase plasmid under the control of the thymidine kinase promoter (50 ng/well) was cotransfected as an internal control. 24 h post-transfection, cells were either treated with 1 μg/ml prolactin or left untreated for 2 and 4 h. Luciferase activities were measured with the dual-luciferase reporter assay system (Promega).RESULTSA Conserved Motif within the Prolactin Receptor Mediates Interaction with 14-3-3 Proteins—Binding of 14-3-3 proteins to target proteins is generally mediated through RSXpS/TXP or RXXXpS/TXP sequences in which pS/T is phosphorylated (18Muslin A.J.

We noted the presence of a similar motif in the long form of the human PrlR (388KCSTWP393), which was found to be highly conserved among a wide variety of species (Fig. 1A). To test for a possible interaction between the receptor and 14-3-3 proteins, we transiently expressed the human PrlR in 293T cells, prepared whole cell lysates, and performed pulldown experiments using GST-14-3-3-Sepharose beads. We initially selected the ζ isoform based on its ability to interact with the granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor receptor (23Stomski F.C. Dottore M. Winnall W.

Interestingly, the PrlR associated with GST-14-3-3ζ but not with GST alone (Fig. 1B). This interaction was further verified by coimmunoprecipitation of the PrlR with both the 14-3-3ζ and γ isoforms (Fig. 1C). The 14-3-3σ isoform, whose expression is restricted to epithelial cells, was also found to associate with the PrlR (data not shown). Mutation of the central three amino acids within the putative 14-3-3 binding motif (CST391 to AAA) of the PrlR disrupted its association with GST-14-3-3ζ, demonstrating that the interaction was mediated via this consensus site (Fig. 1B).In most cases, 14-3-3 proteins associate with target proteins in a phosphorylation-dependent manner. To explore whether Thr391 represented a novel phosphorylation site within the human PrlR and was essential for interaction with 14-3-3 proteins, we carried out binding studies with a mutant in which Thr391 was altered to alanine. The interaction between this mutant with GST-14-3-3ζ (Fig. 1B) and its coimmunoprecipitation with 14-3-3ζ and γ isoforms (Fig. 1C) was markedly reduced. Conversely, a S390A PrlR mutant still associated with 14-3-3 (data not shown). These results demonstrate an absolute requirement for Thr391 in the PrlR to create a binding site for 14-3-3 proteins.In Vivo Phosphorylation of Thr391 and 14-3-3 Binding Are Regulated by a PP2A-like Activity—To confirm phosphorylation of Thr391 in the PrlR in vivo, we generated a polyclonal antibody that specifically recognized a phosphopeptide encompassing the 14-3-3 binding site in the human PrlR but did not cross-react with the corresponding unphosphorylated peptide. This antibody was used to demonstrate that the wild-type but not the T391A mutant receptor was phosphorylated in transiently transfected 293T cells (Fig. 2A). Phosphorylation of the wild-type receptor promoted association with endogenous 14-3-3 proteins, as determined by immunoblotting using an antibody that recognizes all 14-3-3 isoforms. Because of the lack of suitable antibodies for immunoprecipitation of 14-3-3 and PrlR proteins, we generated stable PrlR transfectants to address the interaction with endogenous 14-3-3 proteins as well as the phosphorylation of Thr391. Only the wild-type PrlR was found to be phosphorylated in NIH3T3 and EGF-dependent mouse mammary epithelial HC11 cells that stably expressed either the wild-type or the T391A mutant receptor (Fig. 2A). The presence of EGF had no effect on the level of Thr391 phosphorylation. To gain insight into potential kinases or phosphatases that modify this site, we treated cells with various stimuli or inhibitors and analyzed their effect on Thr391 phosphorylation. Activation of protein kinases A, B, and C was found to have little effect on phosphorylation of this site (data not shown). Interestingly, okadaic acid, a selective inhibitor of the serine/threonine phosphatase PP2A, significantly increased phosphorylation of Thr391 in NIH3T3 cells expressing the wild-type PrlR (Fig. 2B). This increase was associated with further recruitment of endogenous 14-3-3 proteins (Fig. 2B).Fig. 2In vivo phosphorylation of Thr391 and 14-3-3 binding are stabilized by okadaic acid. A, whole cell extracts from transiently transfected 293T and from NIH3T3 and HC11 cells that stably express V5-tagged WT and T391A PrlR were immunoprecipitated with V5-specific antibody. HC11 cells were grown in proliferation medium containing EGF (+), or EGF was withdrawn for 24 h (–) prior to lysis. The receptor was resolved by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with a phospho-Thr391-PrlR-specific antibody (top panels). Immunoprecipitates from 293T cells were also immunoblotted with 14-3-3-specific antibody (middle panel, left). Membranes were reprobed with V5-specific antibody to confirm expression of the PrlR (bottom panels). B, NIH3T3 cells stably expressing V5-tagged WT PrlR were treated with 1 μm okadaic acid (OA) in Me2SO for 1, 2, and 4 h. The PrlR was immunoprecipitated with V5-specific antibody, resolved by SDS-PAGE, and immunoblotted with phospho-Thr391-PrlR-specific (top panel) and 14-3-3-specific antibodies (middle panel). The membrane was reprobed with V5-specific antibody to confirm equal loading (bottom panel). Me2SO alone had no effect on Thr391 phosphorylation.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Thr391 Phosphorylation in Breast Epithelial Cells Is Independent of Prolactin Stimulation—We next investigated the association between 14-3-3 and the endogenous PrlR in human breast carcinoma cell lines, T47D and SKBR3, and in HC11 cells. GST-14-3-3ζ pulled down the receptor in all cell lines (Fig. 3, A and B), indicating that the PrlR is phosphorylated on Thr391 in these cell lines. Phosphorylation of this site appears to be constitutive and independent of ligand binding because prolactin stimulation did not affect association of the PrlR with 14-3-3.Fig. 3Interaction of 14-3-3 with the PrlR occurs independently of prolactin stimulation. A, serum-starved T47D and SKBR3 cells were stimulated with prolactin for indicated times prior to lysis. B, HC11 cells were maintained at confluence, EGF was withdrawn for 24 h, and cells were then stimulated with prolactin and dexamethasone for indicated times. Pulldown experiments were performed using glutathione beads coupled to GST-14-3-3ζ or GST alone; the endogenous PrlR was revealed by Western blot with PrlR-specific polyclonal antiserum.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Increased Tyrosine Phosphorylation of the T391A PrlR— Binding of prolactin to the PrlR activates Jak2 kinase, which in turn phosphorylates the receptor on tyrosine residues to generate docking sites for downstream signaling molecules. To investigate whether Thr391 phosphorylation influenced activation of the receptor, we transiently transfected vectors encoding wild-type or mutant receptor into 293T cells and then stimulated cells with prolactin for 10, 30, and 60 min. The receptor was immunoprecipitated from lysates and blotted with a phosphotyrosine-specific antibody (Fig. 4A). Interestingly, we observed increased basal as well as prolactin-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of the mutant receptor, suggesting that Thr391 phosphorylation may modulate PrlR activation. Increased tyrosine phosphorylation of the T391A mutant compared with the wild-type receptor was found to be highly reproducible as shown by densitometric quantification of three independent experiments (Fig. 4B).Fig. 4Tyrosine phosphorylation of the T391A mutant PrlR is increased compared with the wild-type receptor. 293T cells were transiently transfected with V5-tagged WT or T391A PrlR expression vectors and stimulated with 1 μg/ml prolactin for indicated times prior to lysis. The PrlR was immunoprecipitated with V5-specific antibody and resolved by SDS-PAGE. Western blotting was performed using a phosphotyrosine-specific antibody (pY, top panel). The membrane was reprobed with V5-specific antibody to verify equal expression and immunoprecipitation of the PrlR (bottom panel).

We therefore analyzed how the phosphorylation site mutant affects activation of Stat5 by cotransfecting 293T cells with expression vectors encoding Stat5a and either wild-type or mutant PrlR, followed by immunoblotting of lysates with a phospho-specific Stat5 antibody. Despite increased tyrosine phosphorylation of the T391A mutant (Fig. 4), no increase in the level of activated Stat5a was observed in response to prolactin (Fig. 5A). Even when the concentration of prolactin was titrated to ensure that signaling to Stat5a was not saturated, activation of Stat5a by the wild-type and T391A mutant PrlR were comparable after 30 min of prolactin treatment (Fig. 5B). However, a small but reproducible increase in basal Stat5a phosphorylation was evident prior to treatment with prolactin (Fig. 5, A and B). Comparable findings were made in two independent reporter assays using the Stat5-responsive β-casein promoter linked to a luciferase reporter. Although basal reporter activity was 1.5-fold greater for the T391A PrlR compared with wild-type PrlR, Thr391 phosphorylation did not influence Stat5a signaling following prolactin treatment (data not shown).Fig. 5Thr391 modulates signaling down the PI3K and MAPK pathways. 293T cells were transiently transfected with expression vectors encoding V5-tagged WT or T391A PrlR together with Stat5a (A and B), HA-tagged PKB (C), or HA-tagged Erk2 (D). Cells were stimulated with 1 μg/ml prolactin for 10, 30, and 60 min (A, C, and D) or with 0.01, 0.1, and 1 μg/ml prolactin for 30 min (Prl, B). Whole cell lysates were separated by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with (top panels) phospho-specific Stat5 (A and B), PKB (C), and Erk antibodies (D). Membranes were reprobed with (middle panels) Stat5a-specific (A and B) and HA-specific antibodies (C and D), and also with V5-specific antibody to verify expression of each construct. Untransfected 293T cells were loaded as a control (con). E, 293T cells were transiently transfected with WT or T391A PrlR expression vectors together with a Gal4-Sap1a plasmid and the G5E4-lux reporter. 24 h post-transfection, cells were either left untreated or stimulated with 1 μg/ml prolactin for 2 and 4 h. Firefly luciferase activity was then determined and normalized using an internal Renilla luciferase control. Mean values of triplicate samples of one representative experiment are plotted. Error bars represent the mean ± S.E.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The PrlR has been reported to stimulate the PI3K and MAPK signal transduction pathways in addition to Stat transcription factors.

Interestingly, PKB activation appeared to be prolonged following treatment with prolactin (Fig. 5C), whereas enhanced activation of Er"
https://openalex.org/W1984393110,"The binding pathway of the natural antisense RNA CopA to its target CopT proceeds through a hierarchical order of steps. It initiates by reversible loop-loop contacts followed by unidirectional helix progression into the upper stems. This involves extensive breakage of intramolecular base pairs and the subsequent formation of two intermolecular helices, B and B′. Based on the known tRNA anticodon loop structure and on results from the Sok/Hok antisense/target RNA system, it had been suggested that a U-turn (or π-turn) in the loop of CopT might determine the directionality of helix progression. Data presented here show that the putative U-turn is one of the structural elements of antisense/target RNA pairs required to achieve fast binding kinetics. Swapping of the hypothetical U-turn structure from the target RNA to the antisense RNA retained regulatory performance <i>in vivo</i> and binding rates <i>in vitro</i> but altered the binding pathway by changing the direction in which the initiating helix was extended. In addition, our data indicate that a helical stem immediately adjacent to the target loop sequence is required to provide a scaffold for the U-turn."

We have used endogenous tryptophan fluorescence studies to elucidate both the nature and the role(s) of the metal ions in the Cet1-mediated phosphohydrolase reaction. The association of Mg2+, Mn2+, and Co2+ ions with the enzyme resulted in a decrease in the intensity of the tryptophan emission spectrum. This decrease was then used to determine the apparent dissociation constants for these ions. Subsequent dual ligand titration experiments demonstrated that the metal ions bind to a common site, for which they compete. The kinetics of real-time metal ion binding to the Cet1 protein were also investigated, and the effects on RNA and nucleotide binding were evaluated. To provide additional insight into the relationship between Cet1 structure and metal ion binding, we correlated the effect of ion binding on protein structure using both circular dichroism and guanidium hydrochloride-induced denaturation as structural indicators. Our data indicate that binding of RNA, nucleotides, and metal ion cofactors does not lead to significant structural modifications of the Cet1 architecture. This suggests a model in which Cet1 possesses a preformed active site, and where major domain rearrangements are not required to form an active catalytic site.

Eukaryotic mRNAs possess a 5′-terminal cap structure that plays a critical role in the translation, stability, splicing, and transport of these mRNAs from the nucleus to the cytoplasm (1Furuichi Y. Shatkin S. Adv. Virol. Res. 2000; 55: 135-184Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The capping of mRNAs occurs immediately following the synthesis of pre-mRNAs, and involves three distinct enzymatic activities. First, the 5′-end of the pre-mRNA is hydrolyzed to a diphosphate by an RNA triphosphatase. This diphosphate end is then capped with GMP by an RNA guanylyltransferase, and finally methylated by an RNA (guanine-7) methyltransferase (2Shuman S. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol.

Genetic experiments performed in Saccharomyces cerevisiae elegantly demonstrated that each of these activities is essential for yeast cell growth (3Shibagaki Y. Itoh N. Yamada H. Nagata S.

Wang L.K. Shuman S. Cell. 1999; 99: 533-543Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). No information is currently available on the precise affinity of Cet1 for the metal ion cofactors nor on their possible roles in catalysis. However, metal ions have the potential of fulfilling multiple functional roles in phosphohydrolase catalysis, including: (i) increasing the affinity of the enzyme for the RNA/NTP substrate; (ii) increasing the stability of the protein; (iii) being directly involved in catalysis by promoting the activation of nucleophiles; and (iv) stabilizing the transition state. As a first step toward elucidating the nature and the role(s) of the metal ion cofactors in the Cet1-mediated phosphohydrolase reaction, we have utilized endogenous tryptophan fluorescence to evaluate the interactions of metal ions with Cet1. Quenching of the fluorescence signals by titration of the protein with metal ions provides a straightforward and powerful technique for evaluating the binding of metal ions to proteins. To provide additional insight into the relationship between Cet1 structure and metal ion binding, we correlated the effect of ion binding on protein structure using circular dichroism and guanidium hydrochloride-induced denaturation as structural indicators. Additionally, we investigated the effect of RNA and nucleotide binding on the structure and stability of the Cet1 protein. Our data provide insights into the precise role of metal ions in the Cet1-mediated RNA triphosphatase reaction, as well as on the effect of ligand binding on Cet1 structure. Cet1 Expression and Purification—A plasmid for the expression of a full-length Cet1 protein (549 amino acids) was generated by inserting the S. cerevisiae Cet1 gene between the NheI and BamHI cloning sites of the pET28a expression plasmid (Novagen). In this context, the Cet1 protein is fused in-frame with a C-terminal peptide containing 6 tandem histidine residues, and expression of the His-tagged protein is driven by a T7 RNA polymerase promoter. The resulting recombinant plasmid (pET-Cet1) was transformed into Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) and a 100-ml culture of E. coli BL21(DE3)/pET-Cet1 was grown at 37 °C in Luria-Bertani medium containing 0.1-mg/ml ampicillin until the A 600 reached 0.5. The culture was adjusted to 0.4 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside, and the incubation continued at 18 °C for 20 h. The cells were then harvested by centrifugation, and the pellet stored at –80 °C. All subsequent procedures were performed at 4 °C. Thawed bacteria pellets were resuspended in 5 ml of lysis buffer A (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, and 10% sucrose), and cell lysis was achieved by adding lysozyme and Triton X-100 to final concentrations of 50 μg/ml and 0.1%, respectively. The lysates were sonicated to reduce viscosity, and any insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 13,000 rpm for 45 min. The soluble extract was applied to a 2-ml column of nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (Qiagen) that had been equilibrated with buffer A containing 0.1% Triton X-100. The column was washed with the same buffer and then eluted stepwise with buffer B (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.1 m NaCl, and 10% glycerol) containing 50, 100, 200, 500, and 1000 mm imidazole. The polypeptide composition of the column fractions was monitored by SDS-PAGE. The recombinant Cet1 protein was retained on the column and recovered in the 100 mm imidazole eluate. The eluate was applied to a 2-ml column of phosphocellulose that had been equilibrated in buffer C (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 50 mm NaCl, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, and 0.05% Triton X-100). The column was washed with the same buffer, and then eluted stepwise with buffer C containing 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, and 1.0 m NaCl. The recombinant protein was retained on the column and was recovered predominantly in the 0.2 m NaCl fraction. Following dialysis against buffer C, the phosphocellulose preparation was stored at –80 °C. Protein concentration was determined by the Bio-Rad dye binding method using bovine serum albumin as the standard. Fluorescence Measurements—Fluorescence was measured using an Hitachi F-2500 fluorescence spectrophotometer. Background emission was eliminated by subtracting the signal from either buffer alone or buffer containing the appropriate quantity of substrate. The extent to which ligands bind to the Cet1 protein was determined by monitoring the fluorescence emission of a fixed concentration of proteins and titrating with a given ligand. The binding can be described by Equation 1, Kd=[Cet1][ligand][Cet1·ligand](Eq. 1) where Kd is the apparent dissociation constant, [Cet1] is the concentration of the protein, [Cet1·ligand] is the concentration of complexed protein, and [ligand] is the concentration of unbound ligand. The proportion of ligand-bound protein as described by Equation 1 is related to measured fluorescence emission intensity by Equation 2, ΔF/ΔFmax=[Cet1·ligand]/[Cet1]tot(Eq. 2) where ΔF is the magnitude of the difference between the observed fluorescence intensity at a given concentration of ligand and the fluorescence intensity in the absence of ligand, ΔF max is the difference at infinite [ligand], and [Cet1]tot is the total protein concentration. If the total ligand concentration, [ligand]tot, is in large molar excess relative to [Cet1]tot, then it can be assumed that [ligand] is approximately equal to [ligand]tot. Equations 1 and 2 can then be combined to give Equation 3. ΔF/ΔFmax=[ligand]tot/(Kd+[ligand]tot)(Eq. 3) The Kd values were determined from a nonlinear least square regression analysis of titration data by using Equation 3, and the stoichiometry of binding was established from a linear version of the Hill equation (Equation 4), log(ΔF/(ΔFmax-ΔF))=nlog[ion]-logK'(Eq. 4) where n is the order of the binding reaction with respect to ligand concentration and K′ is the concentration of ions that yields 50% of ΔF max. Circular Dichroism Spectroscopy Measurements—Circular dichroism measurements were performed with a Jasco J-810 spectropolarimeter. The samples were analyzed in quartz cells with path lengths of 1 mm. Far-UV and near-UV wavelength scans were recorded from 200 to 250 nm and from 250 to 340 nm, respectively. All the CD spectra were corrected by subtraction of the background for the spectrum obtained with either buffer alone or buffer containing the ligand. The average of six wavelength scans is presented. The ellipticity results were expressed as mean residue ellipticity, [θ], in degrees·cm2·dmol–1. Analysis of Competitive Metal Ion Binding—Analysis of the effect of a fixed concentration of one metal ion ligand (iona) on the binding of a second ion ligand (ionb) was performed in a manner analogous to that previously reported for analyzing the kinetics of a system in which two alternative substrates compete for the same enzyme binding site (24Painter G.R. Wright L.L. Hopkins S. Furman P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19362-19368Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The change in fluorescence (ΔF) observed upon titration of Cet1 with iona in the presence of a fixed concentration of competing substrate (ionb) can be described by Equation 5, ΔF=ΔFmax(a)([iona]/Ka)+ΔFmax(b)([ionb]/Kb)+([iona]/Ka+[ionb]/Kb)(Eq. 5) where ΔF max(a) and ΔF max(b) are the changes in fluorescence produced at infinite concentrations of iona and ionb, respectively. K a and K b are the apparent dissociation constants for iona and ionb, respectively. Equation 5 was fit to the simple ligand saturation isotherms for both iona and ionb. Nucleotide Binding Assay—Nucleotide binding was assessed by analyzing the interaction of [35S]ATPγS, a nonhydrolyzable analog of ATP, with the Cet1 protein. Standard binding reactions containing 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm NaCl, 1 mm [35S]ATPγS (Amersham Biosciences) and enzyme as specified were incubated for 30 min at 25 °C. Protein-nucleotide complexes were precipitated by addition of trichloroacetic acid to a 10% final concentration and 5 μg of bovine serum albumin and washed extensively with 10% trichloroacetic acid. The concentrations of divalent ions were modified in some experiments as indicated in the text. The radioactivity was quantitated by liquid scintillation counting. The apparent dissociation constant (Kd) for each probe was determined according to Equation 6, fD=[Cet1]Kd+[Cet1](Eq. 6) where f D represents the fraction of bound nucleotides, [Cet1] the total protein concentration, and Kd the dissociation constant for the binding reaction. Chemical RNA Synthesis—An RNA molecule of 50 nucleotides was synthesized using 2′-acetate ester chemistry (Dharmacon Research Inc., Lafayette, CO) and deprotected according to the manufacturer's recommended protocol. The 5′-hydroxyl-terminated RNA was then purified on a 20% acrylamide-8 m urea gel. The product was visualized by UV-shadowing, and the band was cut out. The RNA molecule was then eluted by incubating overnight at room temperature in a solution containing 0.1% SDS and 0.5 m ammonium acetate. The RNA was then precipitated by the addition of 0.1 volume of 3 m sodium acetate, pH 5.2, and 2.2 volumes of ethanol, and quantify by spectrophotometry at 260 nm after dissolving in water. Equilibrium Unfolding Experiments—For all unfolding experiments, a 50 nm solution of purified Cet1 was adjusted to the desired final concentration of guanidium hydrochloride (Gdm-HCl) and incubated for 60 min at 25 °C. The intrinsic fluorescence of the protein was then monitored as a function of the Gdm-HCl concentration. The parameters ΔG u (Gibbs free energy of unfolding), ΔGu0 (Gibbs free energy of unfolding in the absence of denaturant), m (cooperativity of unfolding), and C m (midpoint concentration of denaturant required to unfold 50% of the protein) were obtained as previously outlined (25Pace C.N. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 259: 538-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) using Equations 7 and 8. ΔGu=-RTlnKu(Eq. 7) ΔGu=ΔGu0-m[Gdm-HCl](Eq. 8) Expression, Purification, and Intrinsic Fluorescence Properties of Cet1—The S. cerevisiae Cet1 protein has the ability to hydrolyze the 5′-triphosphate end of mRNAs to a diphosphate in the presence of magnesium. In addition, it is also able to hydrolyze NTPs to NDPs in the presence of either manganese or cobalt (8Ho C.K. Pei Y. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34151-34156Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 9Ho C.K. Schwer B. Shuman S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5189-5198Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To investigate the metal ion binding activity of the enzyme, the Cet1 protein was expressed in Escherichia coli as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The protein was sequentially purified from soluble bacterial extracts by affinity chromatography. SDS-PAGE analysis showed that the 64-kDa Cet1 protein was the predominant polypeptide in the purified fraction (Fig. 1A). The amount of Cet1 protein in this fraction was estimated to be 150 ng/ml. The fluorescence emission spectrum of the purified Cet1 protein in standard buffer at 22 °C is shown in Fig. 1B. To obtain the maximal emission peak at the low concentrations of protein required to accurately determine Kd values, excitation was carried out at 290 nm. Both tyrosine and tryptophan absorb at this wavelength (24Painter G.R. Wright L.L. Hopkins S. Furman P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19362-19368Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, varying the excitation wavelength from 254 nm, where the contribution of tyrosine fluorescence to the emission spectrum would be the greatest, to 295 nm, where the emission spectrum would arise almost exclusively from tryptophan, produced no change in the position of λmax (339 nm) or in the spectral bandwidth (65 nm at half-height) (data not shown). Thus, despite the fact that Cet1 contains 14 tyrosines in addition to the 3 tryptophans, the emission spectrum is dominated by the indole fluorophores. This dominance is due, in part, to the higher extinction coefficient of tryptophan, and to resonance energy transfer from tyrosine to tryptophan. The emission maximum of the enzyme (339 nm) is blue-shifted relative to that of free l-tryptophan, which under the same conditions is observed to be at 350 nm. The λmax of tryptophan is highly sensitive to the polarity of the microenvironment in which its indole side chain is located. Blue shifts of protein emission spectra have been ascribed to shielding of the tryptophan residues from the aqueous phase (26Eftink M.R. Ghiron C.A. Biochemistry. 1976; 15: 672-680Crossref PubMed Scopus (991) Google Scholar). This shielding is the result of the protein's three-dimensional structure. Accordingly, denaturation of Cet1 with 8 m urea results in a red shift of λmax toward 350 nm (Fig. 1B). The molar intensity of the fluorescence emission spectrum of Cet1 was also evaluated. This spectrum was determined to see if significant protein aggregation, or if the loss of protein from solution through adhesion, could influence the data. As can be seen in Fig. 1C, a decrease in fluorescence is observed with increasing concentrations of Cet1. A linear change of 0.28 fluorescence intensity units/nm protein was observed over the range examined. This relatively small change can be attributed to minor aggregation occurring at higher protein concentrations. Therefore, all the binding experiments were subsequently performed at a protein concentration of 50 nm, with the assumption that the binding equilibrium was not complicated by the presence of an aggregation equilibrium. Binding of Metal Ions to the Cet1 Protein—The binding of metal ions to free enzymes has been shown to result in a significant decrease in emission fluorescence intensities (27van der Wolk J.P.W.

We initially sought to investigate the binding of the metal ion cofactors necessary for the Cet1-mediated phosphohydrolase activity by titrating the binding of metal ions to a fixed concentration of the Cet1 protein. Typical emission spectra obtained from the titration of MgCl2 are shown in Fig. 2A. We observed that the binding of Mg2+, Mn2+, and Co2+ ions to the Cet1 protein resulted in a modification of the intensity of the intrinsic fluorescence of the protein. The addition of increasing amounts of Mg2+ produced a decrease in the fluorescence intensity; however, both the emission maximum (339 nm) and spectral bandwidth were unaffected. The corresponding saturation isotherm, generated by plotting the change in fluorescence intensity at 339 nm as a function of added MgCl2, is shown in Fig. 2B. Quenching saturated at millimolar Mg2+ concentrations, and a 7 mm Kd value could be estimated for Mg2+ from a fit of Equation 3 to the generated saturation isotherm. About 16% of the intrinsic protein fluorescence was accessible to the quencher Mg2+ ion (Fig. 2B). Analysis of a Hill plot, generated from the Mg2+ ion binding data, yielded a Hill coefficient of 1.1, indicating a lack of cooperativity (Table I). Furthermore, a Scatchard plot of Mg2+ binding data is linear, providing no evidence for multiple classes of independent magnesium ion binding sites, nor of cooperative binding sites (data not shown). Note that the binding of the Mg2+ ions could not be detected after heating the enzyme at 60 °C in the presence of 0.1% SDS prior to the titration (data not shown). Furthermore, the addition of EDTA to the reaction reversed the effects on fluorescence and showed that the change in fluorescence observed by the addition of the metal ion is not solely due to a change in the ionic strength of the solution (data not shown). Accordingly, electrostatic interactions appear to make only minor contributions to the overall binding energy, as illustrated by the minimal effect of ionic strength on the apparent Kd value of Cet1 for Mg2+ ions (Fig. 2C).Table IDissociation constants (KD), maximal decrease of fluorescence ((ΔF/F0)max), Hill coefficients (n), and association rates for the interaction of Cet1 with various metal ionsLigandKD(ΔF/F 0)maxnAssociation ratemmμ m-1 s-1Mg2+70.161.10.1Mn2+110.201.40.1Co2+260.191.10.1 Open table in a new tab The kinetics of real-time Mg2+ ion binding to the Cet1 protein were investigated by monitoring the intrinsic protein fluorescence of Cet1 following the addition of Mg2+ ions (Fig. 2D). The progress of the binding reaction was followed and showed that there was a rapid exponential decrease in fluorescence following the addition of the Mg2+ ions. An apparent association rate of 0.1 μm–1 s–1 was estimated from the data. Half-maximal quenching was observed at ∼2 s, whereas maximal quenching was achieved after 6 s of incubation with Mg2+ ions and remained constant thereafter. The exponential decrease in fluorescence observed following the addition of metal ions was not due to photobleaching, because similar results were obtained when the Cet1 protein was incubated away from the light source (data not shown). The binding of Mn2+ and Co2+ ions to the Cet1 protein was investigated in an analogous manner by monitoring the decrease in the intrinsic protein fluorescence following binding of the respective metal ion. The kinetics parameters were determined and are shown in Table I. Again quenching saturated at millimolar concentrations, and Kd values of 11 mm and 26 mm were evaluated for manganese and cobalt ions, respectively. About 20% of the intrinsic protein fluorescence was accessible to the quencher Mn2+ and Co2+ ions. We next sought to investigate whether or not magnesium, manganese, and cobalt ions bind to the same site of Cet1. Competitive alternative ligand binding experiments were carried out to determine if the different metal ions compete for a common binding site. In the first experiment, the combined ΔF produced at 339 nm by the addition of various Co2+ concentrations was plotted against the concentration of Mn2+ ions. Three concentrations of Mn2+ were used in this competition experiment. The saturation isotherm, resulting from the competitive ligand experiment conducted with Mn2+ as iona and Co2+ as ionb, is shown in Fig. 2E. In accordance with a previously established model (24Painter G.R. Wright L.L. Hopkins S. Furman P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19362-19368Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the pattern of lines indicates that the Co2+ and Mn2+ ions are competitive ligands, because the binding is mutually exclusive (24Painter G.R. Wright L.L. Hopkins S. Furman P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19362-19368Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A quantitative analysis of the compliance of the experiment with the competitive binding model was made by comparing the Kd and ΔF max values derived from the fit of Equation 5 to the dual titration data with the Kd and ΔF max values determined in single ligand titrations. In each case, the values were statistically indistinguishable. Similar competitive experiments also demonstrated that Mg2+ ions are competing for the same site as Mn2+ and Co2+ ions (data not shown). Importance of the Metal Ions in the Nucleic Acid Binding Activity of Cet1—Because metal ions have previously been shown to be required for the Cet1-mediated phosphohydrolase activity (8Ho C.K. Pei Y. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34151-34156Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 9Ho C.K. Schwer B. Shuman S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5189-5198Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we were interested in determining if the metal ion binding activity could stimulate the binding of Cet1 to the RNA substrate. Fluorescence spectroscopy was used to monitor the RNA binding activity of Cet1 and revealed that the binding of RNA to the Cet1 protein results in a significant decrease in emission fluorescence intensities (Fig. 3A). The binding of Cet1 to a 5′-hydroxyl-terminated RNA transcript of 50 nucleotides was initially evaluated in the presence of 10 mm MgCl2. Quenching saturated around 3 μm, and higher concentrations of RNA did not cause a further decrease in emission fluorescence intensity, suggesting that the reaction had come to an equilibrium. An apparent Kd of 0.7 μm could be estimated for the RNA substrate (Fig. 3A). The divalent ion requirements for the binding of the Cet1 protein to nucleic acids were then investigated. The results clearly showed that RNA binding can occur in the absence of ions and that the addition of metal ions only m"
