https://openalex.org/W2810268565,"From bacteria following simple chemical gradients1 to the brain distinguishing complex odour information2, the ability to recognize molecular patterns is essential for biological organisms. This type of information-processing function has been implemented using DNA-based neural networks3, but has been limited to the recognition of a set of no more than four patterns, each composed of four distinct DNA molecules. Winner-take-all computation4 has been suggested5,6 as a potential strategy for enhancing the capability of DNA-based neural networks. Compared to the linear-threshold circuits7 and Hopfield networks8 used previously3, winner-take-all circuits are computationally more powerful4, allow simpler molecular implementation and are not constrained by the number of patterns and their complexity, so both a large number of simple patterns and a small number of complex patterns can be recognized. Here we report a systematic implementation of winner-take-all neural networks based on DNA-strand-displacement9,10 reactions. We use a previously developed seesaw DNA gate motif3,11,12, extended to include a simple and robust component that facilitates the cooperative hybridization13 that is involved in the process of selecting a 'winner'. We show that with this extended seesaw motif DNA-based neural networks can classify patterns into up to nine categories. Each of these patterns consists of 20 distinct DNA molecules chosen from the set of 100 that represents the 100 bits in 10 × 10 patterns, with the 20 DNA molecules selected tracing one of the handwritten digits '1' to '9'. The network successfully classified test patterns with up to 30 of the 100 bits flipped relative to the digit patterns 'remembered' during training, suggesting that molecular circuits can robustly accomplish the sophisticated task of classifying highly complex and noisy information on the basis of similarity to a memory."
https://openalex.org/W2810583998,"The observation that BRCA1- and BRCA2-deficient cells are sensitive to inhibitors of poly(ADP–ribose) polymerase (PARP) has spurred the development of cancer therapies that use these inhibitors to target deficiencies in homologous recombination1. The cytotoxicity of PARP inhibitors depends on PARP trapping, the formation of non-covalent protein–DNA adducts composed of inhibited PARP1 bound to DNA lesions of unclear origins1–4. To address the nature of such lesions and the cellular consequences of PARP trapping, we undertook three CRISPR (clustered regularly interspersed palindromic repeats) screens to identify genes and pathways that mediate cellular resistance to olaparib, a clinically approved PARP inhibitor1. Here we present a high-confidence set of 73 genes, which when mutated cause increased sensitivity to PARP inhibitors. In addition to an expected enrichment for genes related to homologous recombination, we discovered that mutations in all three genes encoding ribonuclease H2 sensitized cells to PARP inhibition. We establish that the underlying cause of the PARP-inhibitor hypersensitivity of cells deficient in ribonuclease H2 is impaired ribonucleotide excision repair5. Embedded ribonucleotides, which are abundant in the genome of cells deficient in ribonucleotide excision repair, are substrates for cleavage by topoisomerase 1, resulting in PARP-trapping lesions that impede DNA replication and endanger genome integrity. We conclude that genomic ribonucleotides are a hitherto unappreciated source of PARP-trapping DNA lesions, and that the frequent deletion of RNASEH2B in metastatic prostate cancer and chronic lymphocytic leukaemia could provide an opportunity to exploit these findings therapeutically. Mutations in all three genes encoding ribonuclease H2 sensitize cells to poly(ADP–ribose) polymerase inhibitors by compromising ribonucleotide excision repair."
https://openalex.org/W2810246680,"Liquid-liquid phase separation has been shown to underlie the formation and disassembly of membraneless organelles in cells, but the cellular mechanisms that control this phenomenon are poorly understood. A prominent example of regulated and reversible segregation of liquid phases may occur during mitosis, when membraneless organelles disappear upon nuclear-envelope breakdown and reappear as mitosis is completed. Here we show that the dual-specificity kinase DYRK3 acts as a central dissolvase of several types of membraneless organelle during mitosis. DYRK3 kinase activity is essential to prevent the unmixing of the mitotic cytoplasm into aberrant liquid-like hybrid organelles and the over-nucleation of spindle bodies. Our work supports a mechanism in which the dilution of phase-separating proteins during nuclear-envelope breakdown and the DYRK3-dependent degree of their solubility combine to allow cells to dissolve and condense several membraneless organelles during mitosis."
https://openalex.org/W2810727101,"The spread of antimicrobial resistance has become a serious public health concern, making once-treatable diseases deadly again and undermining the achievements of modern medicine. Drug combinations can help to fight multi-drug-resistant bacterial infections, yet they are largely unexplored and rarely used in clinics. Here we profile almost 3,000 dose-resolved combinations of antibiotics, human-targeted drugs and food additives in six strains from three Gram-negative pathogens-Escherichia coli, Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium and Pseudomonas aeruginosa-to identify general principles for antibacterial drug combinations and understand their potential. Despite the phylogenetic relatedness of the three species, more than 70% of the drug-drug interactions that we detected are species-specific and 20% display strain specificity, revealing a large potential for narrow-spectrum therapies. Overall, antagonisms are more common than synergies and occur almost exclusively between drugs that target different cellular processes, whereas synergies are more conserved and are enriched in drugs that target the same process. We provide mechanistic insights into this dichotomy and further dissect the interactions of the food additive vanillin. Finally, we demonstrate that several synergies are effective against multi-drug-resistant clinical isolates in vitro and during infections of the larvae of the greater wax moth Galleria mellonella, with one reverting resistance to the last-resort antibiotic colistin."

https://openalex.org/W2810947153,"Extracellular ATP (eATP) is an ancient 'danger signal' used by eukaryotes to detect cellular damage1. In mice and humans, the release of eATP during inflammation or injury stimulates both innate immune activation and chronic pain through the purinergic receptor P2RX72-4. It is unclear, however, whether this pathway influences the generation of immunological memory, a hallmark of the adaptive immune system that constitutes the basis of vaccines and protective immunity against re-infection5,6. Here we show that P2RX7 is required for the establishment, maintenance and functionality of long-lived central and tissue-resident memory CD8+ T cell populations in mice. By contrast, P2RX7 is not required for the generation of short-lived effector CD8+ T cells. Mechanistically, P2RX7 promotes mitochondrial homeostasis and metabolic function in differentiating memory CD8+ T cells, at least in part by inducing AMP-activated protein kinase. Pharmacological inhibitors of P2RX7 provoked dysregulated metabolism and differentiation of activated mouse and human CD8+ T cells in vitro, and transient P2RX7 blockade in vivo ameliorated neuropathic pain but also compromised production of CD8+ memory T cells. These findings show that activation of P2RX7 by eATP provides a common currency that both alerts the nervous and immune system to tissue damage, and promotes the metabolic fitness and survival of the most durable and functionally relevant memory CD8+ T cell populations."
https://openalex.org/W2811281266,"Arteries and veins are specified by antagonistic transcriptional programs. However, during development and regeneration, new arteries can arise from pre-existing veins through a poorly understood process of cell fate conversion. Here, using single-cell RNA sequencing and mouse genetics, we show that vein cells of the developing heart undergo an early cell fate switch to create a pre-artery population that subsequently builds coronary arteries. Vein cells underwent a gradual and simultaneous switch from venous to arterial fate before a subset of cells crossed a transcriptional threshold into the pre-artery state. Before the onset of coronary blood flow, pre-artery cells appeared in the immature vessel plexus, expressed mature artery markers, and decreased cell cycling. The vein-specifying transcription factor COUP-TF2 (also known as NR2F2) prevented plexus cells from overcoming the pre-artery threshold by inducing cell cycle genes. Thus, vein-derived coronary arteries are built by pre-artery cells that can differentiate independently of blood flow upon the release of inhibition mediated by COUP-TF2 and cell cycle factors."

https://openalex.org/W2810831086,"Einstein's theory of gravity, general relativity, has passed stringent tests in laboratories, elsewhere in the Solar Sytem, and in pulsar binaries. Nevertheless it is known to be incompatible with quantum mechanics and must differ from the true behaviour of matter in strong fields and at small spatial scales. A key aspect of general relativity to test is the strong equivalence principle (SEP), which states that all freely falling objects, regardless of how strong their gravity, experience the same acceleration in the same gravitational field. Essentially all alternatives to general relativity violate this principle at some level. Previous direct tests of the SEP are limited by the weak gravity of the bodies in the Earth-Moon-Sun system or by the weak gravitational pull of the Galaxy on pulsar-white dwarf binaries. PSR~J0337+1715 is a hierarchical stellar triple system, where the inner binary consists of a millisecond radio pulsar in a $1.6$-day orbit with a white dwarf. This inner binary is in a $327$-day orbit with another white dwarf. In this system, the pulsar and the inner companion fall toward the outer companion with an acceleration about $10^8$ times greater than that produced by falling in the Galactic potential, and the pulsar's gravitational binding energy is roughly $10\%$ of its mass. Here we report that in spite of the pulsar's strong gravity, the accelerations experienced by it and the inner white dwarf differ by a fraction of no more than $2.6\times 10^{-6}$ ($95\%$ confidence level). We can roughly compare this to other SEP tests by using the strong-field Nordtvedt parameter $\hat\eta_N$. Our limit on $\hat\eta_N$ is a factor of ten smaller than that obtained from (weak-field) Solar-System SEP tests and a factor of almost a thousand smaller than that obtained from other strong-field SEP tests."
https://openalex.org/W2809938859,"The maintenance of genome stability during mitosis is coordinated by the spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC) through its effector the mitotic checkpoint complex (MCC), an inhibitor of the anaphase-promoting complex (APC/C, also known as the cyclosome)1,2. Unattached kinetochores control MCC assembly by catalysing a change in the topology of the β-sheet of MAD2 (an MCC subunit), thereby generating the active closed MAD2 (C-MAD2) conformer3-5. Disassembly of free MCC, which is required for SAC inactivation and chromosome segregation, is an ATP-dependent process driven by the AAA+ ATPase TRIP13. In combination with p31comet, an SAC antagonist6, TRIP13 remodels C-MAD2 into inactive open MAD2 (O-MAD2)7-10. Here, we present a mechanism that explains how TRIP13-p31comet disassembles the MCC. Cryo-electron microscopy structures of the TRIP13-p31comet-C-MAD2-CDC20 complex reveal that p31comet recruits C-MAD2 to a defined site on the TRIP13 hexameric ring, positioning the N terminus of C-MAD2 (MAD2NT) to insert into the axial pore of TRIP13 and distorting the TRIP13 ring to initiate remodelling. Molecular modelling suggests that by gripping MAD2NT within its axial pore, TRIP13 couples sequential ATP-driven translocation of its hexameric ring along MAD2NT to push upwards on, and simultaneously rotate, the globular domains of the p31comet-C-MAD2 complex. This unwinds a region of the αA helix of C-MAD2 that is required to stabilize the C-MAD2 β-sheet, thus destabilizing C-MAD2 in favour of O-MAD2 and dissociating MAD2 from p31comet. Our study provides insights into how specific substrates are recruited to AAA+ ATPases through adaptor proteins and suggests a model of how translocation through the axial pore of AAA+ ATPases is coupled to protein remodelling."

https://openalex.org/W2810250204,"The potential link between erosion rates at the Earth’s surface and changes in global climate has intrigued geoscientists for decades1,2 because such a coupling has implications for the influence of silicate weathering3,4 and organic-carbon burial5 on climate and for the role of Quaternary glaciations in landscape evolution1,6. A global increase in late-Cenozoic erosion rates in response to a cooling, more variable climate has been proposed on the basis of worldwide sedimentation rates7. Other studies have indicated, however, that global erosion rates may have remained steady, suggesting that the reported increases in sediment-accumulation rates are due to preservation biases, depositional hiatuses and varying measurement intervals8–10. More recently, a global compilation of thermochronology data has been used to infer a nearly twofold increase in the erosion rate in mountainous landscapes over late-Cenozoic times6. It has been contended that this result is free of the biases that affect sedimentary records11, although others have argued that it contains biases related to how thermochronological data are averaged12 and to erosion hiatuses in glaciated landscapes13. Here we investigate the 30 locations with reported accelerated erosion during the late Cenozoic6. Our analysis shows that in 23 of these locations, the reported increases are a result of a spatial correlation bias—that is, combining data with disparate exhumation histories, thereby converting spatial erosion-rate variations into temporal increases. In four locations, the increases can be explained by changes in tectonic boundary conditions. In three cases, climatically induced accelerations are recorded, driven by localized glacial valley incision. Our findings suggest that thermochronology data currently have insufficient resolution to assess whether late-Cenozoic climate change affected erosion rates on a global scale. We suggest that a synthesis of local findings that include location-specific information may help to further investigate drivers of global erosion rates. Reported acceleration of erosion in mountainous landscapes during the late Cenozoic is the result of combining thermochronology data with disparate exhumation histories, thereby converting spatial variations in erosion rates into temporal increases."
https://openalex.org/W2809754893,"Estrogenic hormone replacement therapy increases the risk of developing ovarian cancer, and estrogen promotes tumour initiation and growth in mouse models of this disease. GREB1 (Growth regulation by estrogen in breast cancer 1) is an ESR1 (estrogen receptor 1)-upregulated protein which may mediate estrogen action. GREB1 knockdown prevents hormone-driven proliferation of several breast and prostate cancer cell lines and prolongs survival of mice engrafted with ovarian cancer cells, but its mechanism of action remains unclear. In this study, we explored GREB1 function in ovarian cancer. GREB1 overexpression in ovarian cancer cell lines increased cell proliferation and migration and promoted a mesenchymal morphology associated with increased Col1a2, which encodes a collagen I subunit. GREB1 knockdown inhibited proliferation and promoted an epithelial morphology associated with decreased Col1a2. In human tissues, GREB1 was expressed in all ESR1-expressing tissues throughout the normal female reproductive tract, in addition to several tissues that did not show ESR1 expression. In a TMA of ovarian cancer cases, GREB1 was expressed in 75–85% of serous, endometrioid, mucinous, and clear cell carcinomas. Serous, endometrioid, and mucinous ovarian cancers were almost always positive for either ESR1 or GREB1, suggesting a possible reliance on signalling through ESR1 and/or GREB1. Targeting GREB1 may inhibit tumour-promoting pathways both downstream and independent of ESR1 and is therefore a possible treatment strategy worthy of further investigation."
https://openalex.org/W2809734733,"Land plants are engaged in intricate communities with soil bacteria and fungi indispensable for plant survival and growth. The plant-microbial interactions are largely governed by specific metabolites. We employed a combination of lipid-fingerprinting, enzyme activity assays, high-throughput DNA sequencing and isolation of cultivable microorganisms to uncover the dynamics of the bacterial and fungal community structures in the soil after exposure to isothiocyanates (ITC) obtained from rapeseed glucosinolates. Rapeseed-derived ITCs, including the cyclic, stable goitrin, are secondary metabolites with strong allelopathic affects against other plants, fungi and nematodes, and in addition can represent a health risk for human and animals. However, the effects of ITC application on the different bacterial and fungal organisms in soil are not known in detail. ITCs diminished the diversity of bacteria and fungi. After exposure, only few bacterial taxa of the Gammaproteobacteria, Bacteriodetes and Acidobacteria proliferated while Trichosporon (Zygomycota) dominated the fungal soil community. Many surviving microorganisms in ITC-treated soil where previously shown to harbor plant growth promoting properties. Cultivable fungi and bacteria were isolated from treated soils. A large number of cultivable microbial strains was capable of mobilizing soluble phosphate from insoluble calcium phosphate, and their application to Arabidopsis plants resulted in increased biomass production, thus revealing growth promoting activities. Therefore, inclusion of rapeseed-derived glucosinolates during biofumigation causes losses of microbiota, but also results in enrichment with ITC-tolerant plant microorganisms, a number of which show growth promoting activities, suggesting that Brassicaceae plants can shape soil microbiota community structure favoring bacteria and fungi beneficial for Brassica plants."

https://openalex.org/W2810509916,"Cyclin D1 (CCND1) is a core cell cycle regulator and is frequently overexpressed in human cancers, often via amplification, translocation or post-transcription regulation. Accumulating evidence suggests that mutations of the CCND1 gene that result in nuclear retention and constitutive activation of CDK4/6 kinases are oncogenic drivers in cancer. However, the spectrum of CCND1 mutations across human cancers has not been systematically investigated. Here, we retrospectively mined whole-exome sequencing data from 124 published studies representing up to 29,432 cases from diverse cancer types and sites of origin, including carcinoma, melanoma, sarcoma and lymphoma/leukemia, via online tools to determine the frequency and spectrum of CCND1 mutations in human cancers and their associated clinico-pathological characteristics. Overall, in contrast to gene amplification, which occurred at a frequency of 4.8% (1,419 of 28,769 cases), CCND1 mutations were of very low frequency (0.5%, 151 of 29,432 cases) across all cancers, but were predominantly enriched in uterine endometrioid-type adenocarcinoma (6.5%, 30 of 458 cases) in both primary tumors and in advanced, metastatic endometrial cancer samples. CCND1 mutations in endometrial endometrioid adenocarcinoma occurred most commonly in the c-terminus of cyclin D1, as putative driver mutations, in a region thought to result in oncogenic activation of cyclin D1 via inhibition of Thr-286 phosphorylation and nuclear export, thereby resulting in nuclear retention and protein overexpression. Our findings implicate oncogenic c-terminal mutations of CCND1 in the pathogenesis of a subset of human cancers and provide a key resource to guide future preclinical and clinical investigations."
https://openalex.org/W2811287599,"Western corn rootworm, Diabrotica virgifera virgifera LeConte, has evolved resistance to transgenic maize, Zea maize L., that produces the insecticidal protein Cry3Bb1, which is derived from the bacterium Bacillus thuringiensis. We hypothesized that the level of Cry3Bb1 resistance in populations of western corn rootworm could be influenced by farming practices. To test this hypothesis, we evaluated the effect of field history on resistance to Cry3Bb1 maize by western corn rootworm. In 2013 and 2014, rootworm adults were collected from the four types of maize fields: 1) current problem fields, 2) past problem fields, 3) rotated maize fields, and 4) continuous maize fields. Those field populations along with seven Bt-susceptible control populations were tested for Cry3Bb1 resistance with both plant-based and diet-based bioassays. All field populations were resistant to Cry3Bb1 regardless of field history, however, some variation in the degree of resistance was found. For all categories of field populations, larval survivorship on Cry3Bb1 maize was significantly higher than control populations, and did not differ from survival on non-Bt maize. Evidence of resistance to Cry3Bb1 maize in plant-based bioassays was further supported by diet-based bioassays and we found a positive relationship between LC50 values from diet-based bioassays and the larval survivorship in plant-based bioassays. This study provides evidence of Cry3Bb1 resistance throughout the agricultural landscape studied, irrespective of the field history, and highlights the need for improved resistance management approaches, such as better use of integrated pest management to better delay pest resistance."
https://openalex.org/W2810824995,"To reveal growth properties of Chlorella sorokiniana UTEX 1230, four monosaccharides (glucose, fructose, galactose and xylose) were individually supplemented into medium as carbon sources for the cultivation of C. sorokiniana UTEX 1230. Supplementation with glucose increased OD750, biomass and lipid yield but decreased protein abundance per unit dry weight of biomass under all concentrations examined, the maximum OD750, biomass and lipid yield increased 2.04, 6.78 and 12.43 times, respectively, compared with autotrophic controls. A low concentration of glucose (<4 g/L) simultaneously promoted the biosynthesis of chlorophylls and protein abundance per unit culture volume, but decreased the lipid content per unit dry weight of biomass and all supplemented glucose can be exhausted within 7 days. Higher glucose concentrations (≥4 g/L) decreased the biosynthesis of chlorophylls and protein abundance per unit culture volume, but increased the lipid content per unit dry weight of biomass. In glucose supplemented scenario, C. sorokiniana UTEX 1230 growth was light-independent. Supplementation with fructose promoted C. sorokiniana UTEX 1230 growth to a much lesser extent compared with glucose, whereas supplementation with galactose had no effect and supplementation with xylose even inhibited growth. Our findings represent basic experimental data on the effect of monosaccharides and can serve as the basis for a robust cultivation system to increase biomass and lipid yield."
https://openalex.org/W2810885659,"Background Tuberculosis (TB) incidence in South Africa is among the highest globally. Initial loss to follow-up (ILFU), defined as not starting on TB treatment within 28 days of testing positive, is undermining control efforts. We assessed the feasibility, acceptability, and potential of a mHealth application to reduce ILFU. Methods An mHealth application was developed to capture patients TB investigation data, provide results and monitor treatment initiation. This was implemented in two primary health clinics (PHC) in inner-city Johannesburg. Feasibility was assessed by comparing documentation of personal details, specimen results for same individuals during implementation period (paper register and Mhealth application). Effectiveness was assessed by comparing proportion of patients with results within 48 hours, and proportion started on treatment within 28 days of testing TB positive during pre- implementation (paper register) and implementation (mHealth application) periods. In-depth interviews with patients and providers were conducted to assess acceptability of application. Results Pre-implementation, 457 patients were recorded in paper registers [195 (42.7%) male, median age 34 years (interquartile range IQR (28–40), 45 (10.5%) sputum Xpert positive]. During implementation, 319 patients were recorded in paper register and the mHealth application [131 (41.1%) male, median age 32 years (IQR 27–38), 33 (10.3%) sputum Xpert positive]. The proportion with complete personal details: [mHealth 95.0% versus paper register 94.0%, (p = 0.54)] and proportion with documented results: [mHealth 97.4% versus paper register 97.8%, (p = 0.79)] were not different in the two methods. The proportion of results available within 48 hours: [mHealth 96.8% versus paper register 68.6%), (p <0.001)], and the proportion on treatment within 28 days [mHealth 28/33 (84.8%) versus paper register 30/44 (68.2%), (p = 0.08)] increased during implementation but was not statistically significant. In-depth interviews showed that providers easily integrated the mHealth application into routine TB investigation and patients positively received the delivery of results via text message. Time from sputum collection to TB treatment initiation decreased from 4 days (pre-implementation) to 3 days but was not statistically significant. Conclusions We demonstrated that implementation of the mHealth application was feasible, acceptable to health care providers and patients, and has potential to reduce the time to TB treatment initiation and ILFU in PHC settings."
https://openalex.org/W2838836163,"Perinatal nutrition programs physiologic and metabolic functions, with consequences on the susceptibility to develop metabolic diseases in adulthood. The microbiota represents a key factor of such programming. We investigated whether perinatal prebiotic [short-chain fructooligosaccharides (scFOS)] supplementation improved adult metabolic health in association with microbiota changes in pigs used as human model. Sows were supplemented with scFOS or not during the end of gestation and the entire lactation, and offspring received scFOS accordingly during 1 mo after weaning. Pigs were then fed a standard diet for 5 mo, followed by a high-fat diet for 3 mo once adults. Perinatal scFOS supplementation induced a persistent modulation of the composition of the fecal microbiota in adulthood, notably by increasing the Prevotella genus. Meanwhile, scFOS animals displayed improved capacity to secrete glucagon-like peptide-1 and improved pancreas sensitivity to glucose without any changes in peripheral insulin sensitivity. Perinatal scFOS supplementation also increased ileal secretory IgA secretion and alkaline phosphatase activity and decreased TNF-α expression in adipose tissue. In conclusion, perinatal scFOS supplementation induced long-lasting modulation of intestinal microbiota and had beneficial consequences on the host physiology in adulthood. Our results highlight the key role of perinatal nutrition on later microbiota and host metabolic adaptation to an unbalanced diet.—Le Bourgot, C., Ferret-Bernard, S., Apper, E., Taminiau, B., Cahu, A., Le Normand, L., Respondek, F., Le Huerou-Luron, I., Blat, S.

https://openalex.org/W2810976377,"Narratives surround us in our everyday life in different forms. In the sensory brain areas, the processing of narratives is dependent on the media of presentation, be that in audiovisual or written form. However, little is known of the brain areas that process complex narrative content mediated by various forms. To isolate these regions, we looked for the functional networks reacting in a similar manner to the same narrative content despite different media of presentation. We collected 3-T fMRI whole brain data from 31 healthy human adults during two separate runs when they were either viewing a movie or reading its screenplay text. The independent component analysis (ICA) was used to separate 40 components. By correlating the components’ time-courses between the two different media conditions, we could isolate 5 functional networks that particularly related to the same narrative content. These TOP-5 components with the highest correlation covered fronto-temporal, parietal, and occipital areas with no major involvement of primary visual or auditory cortices. Interestingly, the top-ranked network with highest modality-invariance also correlated negatively with the dialogue predictor, thus pinpointing that narrative comprehension entails processes that are not language-reliant. In summary, our novel experiment design provided new insight into narrative comprehension networks across modalities."
https://openalex.org/W2810505175,"Bladder cancers can be categorized into subtypes according to gene expression patterns. P53-like muscle-invasive bladder cancers are generally resistant to cisplatin-based chemotherapy, but exhibit heterogeneous clinical outcomes with a prognosis intermediate to that of the luminal and basal subtypes. The optimal approach to p53-like tumors remains poorly defined and better means to risk-stratify such tumors and identification of novel therapeutic targets is urgently needed. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) play a key role in cancer, both in tumorigenesis and tumor progression. In the past few years, miRNA expression signatures have been reported as prognostic biomarkers in different tumor types including bladder cancer. However, miRNA's expression does not always correlate well with its activity. We previously developed ActMiR, a computational method for explicitly inferring miRNA activities. We applied ActMiR to The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) bladder cancer data set and identified the activities of miR-106b-5p and miR-532-3p as potential prognostic markers of the p53-like subtype, and validated them in three independent bladder cancer data sets. Especially, higher miR-106b-5p activity was consistently associated with better survival in these data sets. Furthermore, we experimentally validated causal relationships between miR-106-5p and its predicted target genes in p53-like cell line HT1197. HT1197 cells treated with the miR-106b-5p-specific inhibitor were more invasive while cells treated with the miR-106b-5p-specific mimic were less invasive than corresponding controls. Altogether, our results suggest that miR-106b-5p activity can categorize p53-like bladder tumors into more and less-favorable prognostic groups, which provides critical information for personalizing treatment option for p53-like bladder cancers."
https://openalex.org/W2810506961,"Aims To examine drug use behavior of clients attending Methadone Maintenance Treatment (MMT) programs and its relationship with the clients’ social network characteristics. Design Cross-sectional study. Setting Four MMT clinics in Kunming, Yunnan province, China. Participants 324 consecutive MMT clients. Measurements A structured, self-completed questionnaire on background characteristics and existing social network. Current drug use was assessed by urine test for opiate metabolites. Analysis The association between client's social network characteristics and their own current drug use behavior is analysed using multiple logistic regression adjusting for socio-demographic characteristics. Adjusted odds ratios (AOR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) are obtained to give the strength of the associations. Findings MMT clients were more likely to concurrently use heroin while attending MMT if their social network had any of the following characteristics: more than half of the members were older than them (AOR = 1.03, 95% CI = 1.00,1.06), any member had a high level of influence on them (AOR = 6.47, 95% CI = 2.86,14.65) and any member joined them in using drugs (AOR = 1.94, 95% CI = 1.04,3.63). Having a social network member who could provide emotional support (AOR = 0.11, 95% CI = 0.03,0.35), having a spouse and/or child in their social network (AOR = 0.44, 95% CI = 0.24,0.81) and having a social network member with a high level of closeness (AOR = 0.28, 95% CI = 0.09,0.90) were associated with a decreased odds of heroin use. Conclusion Social networks who could provide MMT clients with emotional support and a close relationship were significant factors for reducing the risk of concurrent drug use among clients attending MMT clinics in Kunming, China. Behavioral interventions should address the role of family and social network members in providing support to these clients."
https://openalex.org/W2810705289,"Background Establishment of a beneficial microbiota profile for piglets as early in life as possible is important as it will impact their future health. In the current study, we hypothesized that resistant starch (RS) provided in the maternal diet during gestation and lactation will be fermented in their hindgut, which would favourably modify their milk and/or gut microbiota composition and that it would in turn affect piglets’ microbiota profile and their absorptive and immune abilities. Methods In this experiment, 33% of pea starch was used in the diet of gestating and lactating sows and compared to control sows. Their faecal microbiota and milk composition were determined and the colonic microbiota, short-chain fatty acids (SCFA) production and gut health related parameters of the piglets were measured two days before weaning. In addition, their overall performances and post-weaning faecal score were also assessed. Results The RS diet modulated the faecal microbiota of the sows during gestation, increasing the Firmicutes:Bacteroidetes ratio and the relative abundance of beneficial genera like Bifidobacterium but these differences disappeared during lactation and maternal diets did not impact the colonic microbiota of their progeny. Milk protein concentration decreased with RS diet and lactose concentration increased within the first weeks of lactation while decreased the week before weaning with the RS diet. No effect of the dietary treatment, on piglets’ bodyweight or diarrhoea frequency post-weaning was observed. Moreover, the intestinal morphology measured as villus height and crypt depths, and the inflammatory cytokines in the intestine of the piglets were not differentially expressed between maternal treatments. Only zonula occludens 1 (ZO-1) was more expressed in the ileum of piglets born from RS sows, suggesting a better closure of the mucosa tight junctions. Conclusion Changes in the microbiota transferred from mother to piglets due to the inclusion of RS in the maternal diet are rather limited even though milk composition was affected."
https://openalex.org/W2810793330,"Oncogenic RAS proteins are commonly expressed in human cancer. To be functional, RAS proteins must undergo post-translational modification and localize to the plasma membrane (PM). Therefore, compounds that prevent RAS PM targeting have potential as putative RAS inhibitors. Here we examine the mechanism of action of oxanthroquinone G01 (G01), a recently described inhibitor of KRAS PM localization. We show that G01 mislocalizes HRAS and KRAS from the PM with similar potency and disrupts the spatial organization of RAS proteins remaining on the PM. G01 also inhibited recycling of epidermal growth factor receptor and transferrin receptor, but did not impair internalization of cholera toxin, indicating suppression of recycling endosome function. In searching for the mechanism of impaired endosomal recycling we observed that G01 also enhanced cellular sphingomyelin (SM) and ceramide levels and disrupted the localization of several lipid and cholesterol reporters, suggesting that the G01 molecular target may involve SM metabolism. Indeed, G01 exhibited potent synergy with other compounds that target SM metabolism in KRAS localization assays. Furthermore, G01 significantly abrogated RAS-RAF-MAPK signaling in Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells expressing constitutively activated, oncogenic mutant RASG12V. G01 also inhibited the proliferation of RAS-less mouse embryo fibroblasts expressing oncogenic mutant KRASG12V or KRASG12D but not RAS-less mouse embryo fibroblasts expressing oncogenic mutant BRAFV600E. Consistent with these effects, G01 selectively inhibited the proliferation of KRAS-transformed pancreatic, colon, and endometrial cancer cells. Taken together, these results suggest that G01 should undergo further evaluation as a potential anti-RAS therapeutic. Oncogenic RAS proteins are commonly expressed in human cancer. To be functional, RAS proteins must undergo post-translational modification and localize to the plasma membrane (PM). Therefore, compounds that prevent RAS PM targeting have potential as putative RAS inhibitors.

https://openalex.org/W2810156139,"Neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) of the cholinergic system have been linked to antinociception, and therefore could be an alternative target for pain alleviation. nAChR activity has been shown to be regulated by the nicotinic modulator, lynx1, which forms stable complexes with nAChRs and has a negative allosteric action on their function. The objective in this study was to investigate the contribution of lynx1 to nicotine-mediated antinociception. Lynx1 contribution was investigated by mRNA expression analysis and electrophysiological responses to nicotine in the dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN), a part of the pain signaling pathway. In vivo antinociception was investigated in a test of nociception, the hot-plate analgesia assay with behavioral pharmacology. Lynx1/α4β2 nAChR interactions were investigated using molecular dynamics computational modeling. Nicotine evoked responses in serotonergic and GABAergic neurons in the DRN are augmented in slices lacking lynx1 (lynx1KO). The antinociceptive effect of nicotine and epibatidine is enhanced in lynx1KO mice and blocked by mecamylamine and DHβE. Computer simulations predict preferential binding affinity of lynx1 to the α:α interface that exists in the stoichiometry of the low sensitivity (α4)3(β2)2 nAChRs. Taken together, these data point to a role of lynx1 in mediating pain signaling in the DRN through preferential affinity to the low sensitivity α4β2 nAChRs. This study suggests that lynx1 is a possible alternative avenue for nociceptive modulation outside of opioid-based strategies."

Our goal was to evaluate the benefit of a thin-sliced sagittal DWI in addition to conventional axial DWI at 1.5T for the detection of brainstem infarctions.Data of patients with symptoms consistent with acute and subacute brainstem infarction and an MRI examination including standard axial DWI and thin-sliced sagittal DWI were retrospectively analyzed. Patients with the later diagnosis of a TIA, an inflammation or a tumor of the brainstem were excluded from analysis. Diffusion restrictions were identified by two independent raters blinded for the final clinical diagnosis in three separate reading steps: First, only axial DWI, secondly only sagittal DWI, and lastly both DWIs together. Presence and size of DWI-lesions were documented for each plane. Differences between the observers were settled in consensus in a separate joint reading.Of 73 included patients, 46 patients were clinically diagnosed with brainstem infarction. Inter-observer agreement was excellent for the detection of brainstem lesions in axial and sagittal DWI (kappa = 0.94 and 0.97). In 28/46 patients (60.9%) lesions were detected in the axial plane alone, whereas in 6 more patients (73.9%) lesions were detected in the review of both sequences together. All lesions undetectable in the axial plane were smaller than 5 mm in cranio-caudal direction.Thin-sliced sagittal DWI in addition to axial DWI improves the detection rate of brainstem infarction with little additional expenditure of time."

Additionally, the extracts are characterized using a series of in vitro assays (EPR, DPPH, TPC and TEAC). Considering the chemical findings, the potential beneficial effects of the G. verum extract are explored here in a living organism exposed to stress induced oxidative damages. Thus, the biochemical-modulatory and antioxidant roles of two doses of G. verum extract are examined in animals exposed to acute restraint and dark stress (S). The animals were divided in groups [control, S, SG1 (exposed to 25 mg G. verum extract), SG2 (50 mg extract)]. Increased levels of lipid peroxidation (TBARS from 4.43 to 8.06 nmol/mL), corticosterone from 0.43 to 1.96 μg/dL and epinephrine from 44.43 to 126.7 μg/mL, as well as decreased antioxidant enzymes activities (SOD/CAT) were observed in the S group. The G. verum extract afforded a near-normal equilibrium within the biochemical parameters of animals exposed to RS, by reducing oxidative damage (TBARS at a 3.73 nmol/mL; CS at 0.90 μg/dL; EP at 63.72 μg/mL) and by restoring the antioxidant balance."

https://openalex.org/W2810425956,"Symptoms of orthostatic intolerance (OI) are common in Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFS) and similar disorders. These symptoms may relate to individual differences in intracranial compliance and cerebral blood perfusion. The present study used phase-contrast, quantitative flow magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to determine intracranial compliance based on arterial inflow, venous outflow and cerebrospinal fluid flow along the spinal canal into and out of the cranial cavity. Flow-sensitive Alternating Inversion Recovery (FAIR) Arterial Spin Labelling was used to measure cerebral blood perfusion at rest. Forty patients with CFS and 10 age and gender matched controls were scanned. Severity of symptoms of OI was determined from self-report using the Autonomic Symptom Profile. CFS patients reported significantly higher levels of OI (p < .001). Within the patient group, higher severity of OI symptoms were associated with lower intracranial compliance (r = -.346, p = .033) and higher resting perfusion (r = .337, p = .038). In both groups intracranial compliance was negatively correlated with cerebral perfusion. There were no significant differences between the groups in intracranial compliance or perfusion. In patients with CFS, low intracranial compliance and high resting cerebral perfusion appear to be associated with an increased severity of symptoms of OI. This may signify alterations in the ability of the cerebral vasculature to cope with changes to systemic blood pressure due to orthostatic stress, but this may not be specific to CFS."
https://openalex.org/W2811491357,"Hypoglycin A (HGA) toxicity, following ingestion of material from certain plants, is linked to an acquired multiple acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency known as atypical myopathy, a commonly fatal form of equine rhabdomyolysis seen worldwide. Whilst some plants are known to contain this toxin, little is known about its function or the mechanisms that lead to varied HGA concentrations between plants. Consequently, reliable tools to detect this amino acid in plant samples are needed. Analytical methods for HGA detection have previously been validated for the food industry, however, these techniques rely on chemical derivatisation to obtain accurate results at low HGA concentrations. In this work, we describe and validate a novel method, without need for chemical derivatisation (accuracy = 84–94%; precision = 3–16%; reproducibility = 3–6%; mean linear range R2 = 0.999). The current limit of quantitation for HGA in plant material was halved (from 1μg/g in previous studies) to 0.5μg/g. The method was tested in Acer pseudoplatanus material and other tree and plant species. We confirm that A. pseudoplatanus is most likely the only source of HGA in trees found within European pastures."

We addressed this by studying the thymus from a rat model of developmental programming. The recuperated group was generated by in utero protein restriction, followed by cross-fostering to control-fed mothers, and were then compared with controls. Fat infiltration and adipocyte size increased with age ( P < 0.001) and in recuperated thymi ( P < 0.05). Cortex/medulla ratio decreased with age ( P < 0.001) and decreased ( P < 0.05) in 12-mo recuperated thymi. Age-associated decreases in thymic-epithelial cell ( P < 0.01) and thymocyte markers ( P < 0.01) were observed in both groups and was decreased ( P < 0.05) in recuperated thymi. These data demonstrate effects of developmental programming upon thymic involution. The recuperated group had longer thymic telomeres than controls ( P < 0.001) at 22 d and at 3 mo, which was associated with increased expression of telomere-length maintenance molecules [telomerase RNA component ( Terc; P < 0.01), P23 ( P = 0.02), and Ku70 and Ku80 ( P < 0.01)]. By 12 mo, recuperated offspring had shorter thymic telomeres than controls had ( P < 0.001) and reduced DNA damage-response markers [( DNA-PKcs, Mre11 ( P < 0.01), Xrcc4 ( P = 0.02), and γ-H2ax ( P < 0.001], suggesting failure of earlier compensatory responses.

https://openalex.org/W2810925489,"The effect of high pressure thermal (HPT) treatments on the inactivation of spores of non-proteolytic type E Clostridium botulinum TMW 2.990 was investigated at high pressures (300 to 600 MPa) and elevated temperatures (80 to 100 °C) in four low-acid foods (steamed sole, green peas with ham, vegetable soup, braised veal) and imidazole phosphate buffer (IPB). In addition, corresponding conventional thermal treatments at ambient pressure were performed to expose possible synergisms of pressure and temperature on spore inactivation. In general, spore count reduction was more efficient by combining pressure and temperatures < 100 °C and the overall process duration could be shortened due to accelerated heating rates (adiabatic effect). Processing at 90 °C and 600 MPa resulted in inactivation below the detection limit after 5 min in all foods except steamed sole. Traditional thermal processing of spores at 90 °C for 10 min, on the other hand, did not result in an estimated 6-log reduction. Additional HPT treatments in steamed sole and IPB did not reveal pronounced food matrix dependent protective effects. Here, varying pressure levels did not appear to be the driving force for spore count reduction in steamed sole at any temperature. By applying a Weibull distribution on destruction kinetics of isobaric/isothermal holding times, 6D-values were calculated. Compression and decompression phase (1 s pressure holding time) had a considerable impact on spore count reduction (max. -2.9 log units) in both, foods and buffer. Hence, compression and decompression phases should directly be included into the total lethal effect of HPT treatments to avoid prolonged holding times and overprocessing."

However, the electrophysiological consequences of targeted optogenetic manipulation upon the entire circuit remain poorly understood. Analysis of the sensory-CNS-motor circuit in Drosophila larvae expressing eHpHR and ChR2-XXL revealed unexpected patterns of excitability. Optical stimulation of motor neurons targeted to express eNpHR resulted in inhibition followed by excitation of body wall contraction with repetitive stimulation in intact larvae. In situ preparations with direct electrophysiological measures showed an increased responsiveness to excitatory synaptic activity induced by sensory stimulation within a functional neural circuit. To ensure proper function of eNpHR and ChR2-XXL they were expressed in body wall muscle and direct electrophysiological measurements were obtained. Under eNpHR induced hyperpolarization the muscle remained excitable with increased amplitude of excitatory postsynaptic synaptic potentials. Theoretical models to explain the observations are presented.

https://openalex.org/W2810709419,"Multiple studies have shown that chronic inflammation is closely related to the occurrence and development of colorectal cancer (CRC). Classical NF-κB signaling, the key factor in controlling inflammation, has been found to be of great importance to CRC development. However, the role of alternative NF-κB signaling in CRC is still elusive. Here, we found aberrant constitutive activation of alternative NF-κB signaling both in CRC tissue and CRC cells. Knockdown of RelB downregulates c-Myc and upregulates p27Kip1 protein level, which inhibits CRC cell proliferation and retards CRC xenograft growth. Conversely, overexpression of RelB increases proliferation of CRC cells. In addition, we revealed a significant correlation between Bcl-3 and RelB in CRC tissues. The expression of RelB was consistent with the expression of Bcl-3 and the phosphorylation of Bcl-3 downstream proteins p-Akt (S473) and p-GSK3β (S9). Bcl-3 overexpression can restore the phenotype changes caused by RelB knockdown. Importantly, we demonstrated that alternative NF-κB transcriptional factor (p52:RelB) can directly bind to the promoter region of Bcl-3 gene and upregulate its transcription. Moreover, the expression of RelB, NF-κB2 p52, and Bcl-3 was associated with poor survival of CRC patients. Taken together, these results represent that alternative NF-κB signaling may function as an oncogenic driver in CRC, and also provide new ideas and research directions for the pathogenesis, prevention, and treatment of other inflammatory-related diseases."

However, other biologic functions of SENP2 and its specific targets are incompletely understood. Here, we uncovered a novel role of SENP2 in negative regulation of keratinocyte migration, a process crucial to wound epithelialization. Defects in this function are often associated with the clinical phenotypes of chronic nonhealing wounds. Mechanistically, SENP2 as a specific de-SUMOylase targets NDR1 (nuclear Dbf2-related 1), also called STK38 (serine-threonine kinase 38), for de-SUMOylation and SUMO conjugation of NDR1 on Lys-465 attenuates its inhibition of p38/ERK1/2 activation by decreasing the association of NDR1 with MEK kinase 1/2. Significantly, low-level laser (LLL) irradiation increases NDR1 SUMOylation and subsequent p38/ERK1/2 activation via down-regulation of SENP2, leading to faster keratinocyte migration. Our findings fill the gaps that linger in the basic mechanisms underlying LLL therapy.—Xiao, N., Li, H., Yu, W., Gu, C., Fang, H., Peng, Y., Mao, H., Fang, Y., Ni, W., Yao, M.SUMO-specific protease 2 (SENP2) suppresses keratinocyte migration by targeting NDR1 for de-SUMOylation.

The International Classification of Functioning, disability and health (ICF) is designed to look beyond medical diagnosis and to describe individuals or populations in terms of their ability to function and participate in a social environment. The objective of the study was to describe an adult population requiring specialist oral health care using the ICF and to identify common factors of functioning, participation and environmental context. Method The ICF Checklist for Oral Health was completed for 246 participants from five specialist dental services in five countries (mean age 36 ±16.44 years; 16–92). ‘Developmental disability’ and ‘Medically compromised’ groups were identified (72% and 28%). Results Participants presented with oral disease (92%) and dysfunction (66% impaired chewing). 33 ICF items were affected in over 50% of participants in both groups. Impaired body functions included ‘ingestion functions’, ‘energy and drive functions’ and ‘emotional functions’. Participation was restricted for “Acquiring, keeping and terminating a job”, “Intimate relationships”, “Handling stress and psychological demands”, “Economic self-sufficiency”, “Carrying out a daily routine”, “Recreation and leisure”, “Community life” and “Looking after one’s health”. In the environment domain, “Support and relationships” and “Attitudes” were rated as facilitators. Environmental barriers reported for over 25% of the whole group were related to “Services, systems and policies” including, health, social security, general support, transportation, and labour and employment. Discussion and perspectives Common aspects of functioning, participation and environment were found amongst a heterogeneous population of adults attending specialist dental services, alongside poor oral health and function. The ICF may be used to describe populations that suffer inequality in oral health in order to develop services that effectively target those in need of additional means."

Another level of modulation occurs as a function of posttranslational modifications, including phosphorylation and ubiquitination events, which can either alter channel activity or determine channel abundance (2Yule D.I.

Recently, our laboratory has demonstrated that region-specific proteolytic fragmentation dramatically alters R1 activity and thereby allows the receptor to potentially activate alternative downstream effectors (12Wang L.

However, whether this is a regulatory event specific to R1 or a general form of regulation relevant to all isoforms of IP3R requires further investigation.

For example, R2- and R3-mediated Ca2+ signals play a functionally dominant role in the exocytosis of stored zymogens from the pancreas, which, along with the production of an NaCl-rich fluid, is the primary function of acinar cells. The central role of R2/R3 is most strikingly demonstrated by the observation that R2 and R3 compound knockout mice failed to thrive after weaning because of a severe disruption of exocrine function. Indeed, Ca2+ transients and amylase secretion in response to secretagogue stimulation were reported to be completely abolished in pancreatic acinar cells isolated from R2 and R3 double knockouts (13Futatsugi A. Nakamura T. Yamada M.K. Ebisui E. Nakamura K. Uchida K. Kitaguchi T. Takahashi-Iwanaga H. Noda T. Aruga J. Mikoshiba K. IP3 receptor types 2 and 3 mediate exocrine secretion underlying energy metabolism.Science. 2005; 309 (16195467): 2232-223410.1126/science.1114110Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). R2 and R3 have the same general primary structure as R1 and, therefore, are predicted to be subject to cleavage by proteases at similar solvent-exposed sites (16Bezprozvanny I. The inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptors.Cell Calcium. 2005; 38 (16102823): 261-27210.1016/j.ceca.2005.06.030Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). An early report suggested that R2 and R3 are substrates of caspase and calpain, respectively (17Diaz F. Bourguignon L.Y. Selective down-regulation of IP3 receptor subtypes by caspases and calpain during TNFα-induced apoptosis of human T-lymphoma cells.Cell Calcium. 2000; 27 (11013462): 315-32810.1054/ceca.2000.0126Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). In addition, our laboratory reported that, in a model of acute pancreatitis, R3 were cleaved into low-molecular-weight receptor fragments and that inhibition of proteasome activity failed to completely prevent receptor fragmentation (18Wojcikiewicz R.J. Ernst S.A. Yule D.I.

These observations imply that R3 were cleaved intracellularly by inappropriately activated digestive enzymes, such as trypsin and chymotrypsin, within pancreatic acinar cells during acute pancreatitis (16Bezprozvanny I.

This evidence suggests that models of acute pancreatitis may represent an ideal experimental platform to investigate the in vivo consequences of R2 and R3 fragmentation and subsequent effects on agonist-stimulated [Ca2+]i signals. In this study, utilizing both in vivo and in vitro rodent models of acute pancreatitis, we demonstrate that R2 and R3 are substrates for proteases. Moreover, proteolysis results in channels that retain a fundamental tetrameric architecture and remain in ER membranes but exhibit dramatically altered channel activity. Specifically, in both pancreatitis models and in expression systems mimicking fragmentation, agonist-stimulated Ca2+ oscillations are attenuated, and channel activity is reduced. This study therefore indicates that proteolysis is a novel mechanism for regulating R2 and R3 activity. Furthermore, although proteolysis modulates the activity of all IP3R isoforms, intriguingly, it does so in a subtype- and fragmentation pattern–specific manner. To model acute pancreatitis, mice received three consecutive intraperitoneal (i.p.) injections of a supramaximal concentration of the secretagogue analogue caerulein (50 μg/kg/injection) or saline as a control. This approach represents a well-established, reversible, and relatively noninvasive mouse model of the disease (22Adler G. Rohr G. Kern H.F. Alteration of membrane fusion as a cause of acute pancreatitis in the rat.Dig. Dis. Sci. 1982; 27 (7140496): 993-100210.1007/BF01391745Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar, 23Lerch M.M.

Previous studies have reported that, although isolated pancreatic acinar cells (PAC) from healthy mice displayed robust Ca2+ oscillations in response to low concentrations of secretagogues, those from mice treated with this protocol evoked a single Ca2+ transient or repetitive Ca2+ transients with a significantly lower frequency (24Ward J.B. Sutton R. Jenkins S.A. Petersen O.H.

We first performed [Ca2+]i measurements in PAC within excised pancreatic lobules, as described previously (15Teos L.Y. Zhang Y. Cotrim A.P. Swaim W. Won J.H. Ambrus J. Shen L. Bebris L. Grisius M.

Rep. 2015; 5 (26365984): 1395310.1038/srep13953Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). This paradigm allows analysis of Ca2+ signaling dynamics in PAC in a more native environment and without the time-consuming process of enzymatic digestion of pancreatic tissue needed to produce isolated acinar cells. Upon carbachol (CCh) stimulation (300 nm), PAC from control mice evoked robust Ca2+ oscillations, with each spike returning close to the basal Ca2+ level between each elevation. The oscillatory Ca2+ signals persisted beyond 30 min of the recording (Fig. 1, A and D). Consistent with previous studies (24Ward J.B. Sutton R. Jenkins S.A. Petersen O.H. Progressive disruption of acinar cell calcium signaling is an early feature of cerulein-induced pancreatitis in mice.Gastroenterology. 1996; 111 (8690215): 481-49110.1053/gast.1996.v111.pm8690215Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 25Mooren FCh.

Moreover, a higher concentration of CCh (500 nm) failed to rescue the ability to induce strong Ca2+ oscillations in PAC from caerulein-treated mice (Fig. 1, C and D). This strongly indicates that the alteration of Ca2+ signals during acute pancreatitis is not likely due to desensitization to the stimuli but may result from modifications of the constituent components promoting Ca2+ signaling. It is well accepted that Ca2+ oscillations in pancreatic acinar cells are absolutely dependent on the activity of IP3R in the initial phase and, subsequently, on both IP3R and Orai-based channels during sustained stimulation (13Futatsugi A.

We therefore postulated that the remarkable reduction in oscillatory Ca2+ signals observed (Fig. 1, B–D) resulted from altered regulation of IP3R-induced Ca2+ release. Although all three isoforms of IP3R are expressed in the pancreas, R2 and R3 are most abundant and functionally dominant (27De Smedt H. Missiaen L. Parys J.B. Henning R.H. Sienaert I. Vanlingen S.

Therefore, we performed Western blot assays to investigate whether R2 and R3 are modified in this model of acute pancreatitis. Consistent with our previous report, secretagogue-induced hyperstimulation significantly down-regulated both the full-length R2 and R3 (Fig. 2, A, B, F, and G) (18Wojcikiewicz R.J. Ernst S.A.

In addition, we also observed the generation of both fragmented R2 and R3 receptors in mice treated with caerulein (Fig. 2, A, C, D, F, H, and I). Given the strong evidence that digestive enzymes such as trypsin and chymotrypsin are prematurely activated as an early event in PAC in models of acute pancreatitis (29Sherwood M.W. Prior I.A.

Previous studies demonstrated that exposure of IP3R to low concentrations of trypsin and chymotrypsin in vitro results in five receptor fragments (16Bezprozvanny I.

These results have been interpreted to indicate that IP3R, structurally consists of five compact globular domains (IP3R fragments I, II, III, IV, and V) interconnected with four solvent-exposed linker regions. To estimate the relative sizes of receptor fragments and the cleavage sites on the IP3R in PAC from mice treated with caerulein, we constructed a library of cDNAs encoding R2- or R3-complementary receptor fragments based on the previously reported tryptic cleavage sites of the receptors (Fig. 3, A and D) (16Bezprozvanny I. The inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptors.Cell Calcium. 2005; 38 (16102823): 261-27210.1016/j.ceca.2005.06.030Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Each cDNA was then stably transfected into an IP3R-null background cell line, DT40–3KO (Fig. 3, B, C, E, and F). Fragmented R2 mimicking cleavage at the tryptic site in the second solvent-exposed region was named R2 I-II+III-V (tryp). According to this nomenclature, we generated R2 I-II+III-V (tryp) and R2 I-III+IV-V (tryp) for R2 and R3 I-II+III-V (tryp), R3 I-III+IV-V (tryp), and R3 I-IV+V (tryp) for R3. In addition, we also generated R2 I-IV+V (calpain) based on the sequence homology between IP3R1 (R1) and R2 (Fig. 3, A–F). Notably, receptor fragments in PAC from caerulein-treated mice mainly migrated between 250 and 150 kDa, which were similar molecular weights as for R2 I-III (tryp), R2 I-IV (calpain), R3 I-III (tryp), and R3 I-IV (tryp), indicating that R2 and R3 were preferentially fragmented at the third and fourth solvent-exposed domains (Fig. 2, A and F). Moreover, the N-terminal fragments of cleaved R2 co-immunoprecipitated with the C-terminal fragments (Fig. 2E) in the pancreatic sample prepared from mice treated with caerulein, strongly suggesting that IP3R remained associated after proteolysis during the development of models of acute pancreatitis. Trypsin, one of the essential digestive enzymes, is activated during acute pancreatitis, which has been shown to cleave R2 and R3 in vitro (20Soulsby M.D. Wojcikiewicz R.J.

To test the involvement of trypsin activity in receptor fragmentation, we used the in vivo acute pancreatitis model in trypsinogen 7 knockout mice. These animals are reported to have a 60% reduction in total trypsinogen content, the precursor of trypsin (35Dawra R. Sah R.P. Dudeja V. Rishi L. Talukdar R. Garg P. Saluja A.K.

Although genetic knockout of trypsinogen 7 had less of an effect on the generation of R2 fragments (Fig. 4, A and C), the elevation of R3 fragments was significantly reduced in this model of acute pancreatitis (Fig. 4, B and D). Therefore, although these data suggest a role of trypsin in receptor fragmentation, they also indicate that other proteases likely participate in receptor proteolysis.Figure 3.Generation of DT40–3KO cells stably expressing various types of fragmented R2 and R3.

https://openalex.org/W2811078818,"Objectives C-peptide (CP) loss in type 1 diabetes (T1D) is highly variable, and factors influencing it are poorly understood. We modelled CP values in T1D patients from diagnosis for up to 6 years, treating the serial data as growth curves plotted against time since diagnosis. The aims were to summarise the pattern of CP loss (i.e. growth curve shape) in individual patients in simple terms, and to identify baseline characteristics that predict this pattern in individuals. Materials and methods Between 1976 and 2011, 442 T1D patients initially aged <18y underwent 120-minute mixed meal tolerance tests (MMTT) to calculate area under the curve (AUC) CP, at 3, 9, 18, 30, 48 and 72 months after diagnosis (n = 1537). The data were analysed using the novel SITAR mixed effects growth curve model (SuperImposition by Translation And Rotation). It fits a mean AUC growth curve, but also allows the curve’s mean level and rate of fall to vary between individuals so as to best fit the individual patient curves. These curve adjustments define individual curve shape. Results The square root (√) AUC scale provided the best fit. The mean levels and rates of fall for individuals were normally distributed and uncorrelated with each other. Age at diagnosis and √AUC at 3 months strongly predicted the patient-specific mean levels, while younger age at diagnosis (p<0.0001) and the 120-minute CP value of the 3-month MMTT (p = 0.002) predicted the patient-specific rates of fall. Conclusions SITAR growth curve analysis is a useful tool to assess CP loss in type 1 diabetes, explaining patient differences in terms of their mean level and rate of fall. A definition of rapid CP loss could be based on a quantile of the rate of fall distribution, allowing better understanding of factors determining CP loss and stratification of patients into targeted therapies."
https://openalex.org/W2811299504,"Several reproductive strategies have been identified as key factors that contribute to the establishment and dispersal of invasive species in new environments. These strategies include early maturity, high reproductive capacity and flexibility in timing of reproduction. It is therefore critical to investigate the reproductive biology of target exotic species to understand their potential for population increase and invasive spread, and to inform management control strategies. The European fanworm, Sabella spallanzanii (Gmelin 1791), has established invasive populations along the southern coast of Australia. Gamete development and reproductive periodicity of this worm were investigated in two populations in Gulf St Vincent in South Australia over a 1 year period (July 2012 to June 2013). Samples of worms were collected monthly and dissected for histological analysis. Most individuals reached reproductive maturity at 70 mm body length (thorax and abdomen). Individuals from both populations contained mature and developing gametes year-round and a distinct spawning season was not observed. This may indicate sustained spawning by the population over the year, which provides a constant supply of new recruits to the area. Body length and egg size of worms from these populations were smaller than conspecifics in its native range and other invasive locations. Reproduction and development of S. spallanzanii differs not only between native and invasive locations, but also within invasive locations. This study has shown that S. spallanzanii exhibits a higher phenotypic plasticity and reproductive flexibility than previously known."
https://openalex.org/W2810209922,"Subfamily Cyrtandroideae (Gesneriaceae) comprises a broadly distributed group of rocky-slope herbs, with China being the center of its distributional range. The normal growth of many species within the family is particularly dependent on special habitats. Due to the paucity of molecular studies, very little is known regarding East Asian herb phylogeographic pattern. Here, we investigate the molecular phylogeography of Boea clarkeana Hemsl., a unique resurrection herb endemic to China, focusing on geographically restrictive effects of habitat distribution on evolutionary history. Variation in three chloroplast DNA (cpDNA) intergenic spacers (psbA-trnH, rps12-rpl20, and trnL-trnF), the ribosomal internal transcribed spacer (ITS) and simple sequence repeats in expressed sequence tags (EST-SSRs) was investigated across 18 populations to assess genetic diversity, genetic structure and historical dynamics. Genetic diversity was low within populations (cpDNA, hS = 0.03, πS×10(3) = 0.17; ITS, hS = 0.16, πS×10(3) = 0.43) but high for species (cpDNA, hT = 0.82, πT×10(3) = 3.12; ITS, hT = 0.88, πT×10(3) = 6.39); 76 alleles were detected in this highly inbred species (FIS = 0.22), with a significantly low average of 1.34 alleles per locus. No cpDNA or ITS haplotypes were shared between regions. Based on cpDNA results, the Mt. Huangshan-Tianmu and Mt. Qinling-Daba haplotypes are ancestral; these two regions represent potential refugia. Although no evidence of significant retreat-migration phenomena during glacial cycles was detected, interglacial range expansion from northern Mt. Qinling-Daba was identified (121,457 yr BP). Rapid agricultural growth caused bottlenecks in many populations, especially on Mt. Huang-Tianmu. Habitat restriction and fragmentation, weak seed and pollen dispersal abilities, and long-term isolation caused by human-induced or environmental changes are considered the main causes of extinction of several populations and low genetic diversity within populations and regions. These analyses clarify the effects of habitat restriction on B. clarkeana, representing an evolutionary reference for similar gesneriads, and enrich our understanding of the molecular phylogeography of East Asian rocky-slope herbs."
https://openalex.org/W2811473659,"Surfactant proteins are important collectin immune molecules with a wide distribution throughout the body, including the ocular system. Mice with gene deletions for the surfactant protein genes Sftpa1 and Sftpd were observed to have visual impairment and thinning of the outer nuclear layers of the retina. We hypothesized that gene deletion of Sftpa1 and Sftpd (Sftpa1tm1Kor/J and Sftpd-/-) results in early retinal degeneration in these mice. Sftpa1tm1Kor/J and Sftpd-/- retinas were evaluated by histopathology and optical coherence tomography (OCT). Retinas from Sftpa1tm1Kor/J and Sftpd -/- mice showed early retinal degeneration with loss of the outer nuclear layer. After screening of mice for known retinal degeneration mutations, the mice were found to carry a previously unrecognized Pde6brd1 genotype which resulted from earlier breeding of the strain with Black Swiss mice during their generation. The mutation was outbred and the genotype of Sftpa1tm1Kor/J and Sftpd-/- was confirmed. Outbreeding of the Pde6brd1 mutation resulted in restoration of normal retinal architecture confirmed by in vivo and in vitro examination. We can therefore conclude that loss of Sftpa1 and Sftpd do not result in retinal degeneration. We have now generated retinal Sftpa1 and Sftpd targeted mice that exhibit normal retinal histology."
