Two groups report significant developments in this direction. Bild et al. studied gene expression patterns that reflect the activation of various oncogenic (cancer-causing) signal transduction pathways. Using combinations of these pathway signatures, they predict which patients with breast, lung or ovarian cancer have a particularly poor prognosis. The ability to identify molecular pathways that are deregulated in a particular cancer in this way might be used to predict its sensitivity to specific therapeutic drugs. Solit et al. studied tumour cells with mutations in the RAS and BRAF genes, thought to cause cancer at least in part by activating the MEK/ERK signalling pathway. They show that tumours with the BRAF mutation, but not RAS, are highly sensitive to PD0325901, an MEK inhibitor that is in early-stage clinical trials in patients with melanoma, colon, breast and lung cancers. So by testing for the presence of BRAF mutations it may be possible to identify those patients most likely to benefit from this type of drug. The kinase pathway comprising RAS, RAF, mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK) and extracellular signal regulated kinase (ERK) is activated in most human tumours, often through gain-of-function mutations of RAS and RAF family members1. Using small-molecule inhibitors of MEK and an integrated genetic and pharmacologic analysis, we find that mutation of BRAF is associated with enhanced and selective sensitivity to MEK inhibition when compared to either ‘wild-type’ cells or cells harbouring a RAS mutation. This MEK dependency was observed in BRAF mutant cells regardless of tissue lineage, and correlated with both downregulation of cyclin D1 protein expression and the induction of G1 arrest. Pharmacological MEK inhibition completely abrogated tumour growth in BRAF mutant xenografts, whereas RAS mutant tumours were only partially inhibited. These data suggest an exquisite dependency on MEK activity in BRAF mutant tumours, and offer a rational therapeutic strategy for this genetically defined tumour subtype."

However, much less is known about their effect on lipid metabolism. The fasting-induced adipose factor (FIAF/angiopoietin-like protein 4/peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ angiopoietin-related protein) was previously identified as a target of hypolipidemic fibrate drugs and insulin-sensitizing thiazolidinediones. Using transgenic mice that mildly overexpress FIAF in peripheral tissues we show that FIAF is an extremely powerful regulator of lipid metabolism and adiposity. FIAF overexpression caused a 50% reduction in adipose tissue weight, partly by stimulating fatty acid oxidation and uncoupling in fat. In addition, FIAF overexpression increased plasma levels of triglycerides, free fatty acids, glycerol, total cholesterol, and high density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol. Functional tests indicated that FIAF overexpression severely impaired plasma triglyceride clearance but had no effect on very low density lipoprotein production. The effects of FIAF overexpression were amplified by a high fat diet, resulting in markedly elevated plasma and liver triglycerides, plasma free fatty acids, and plasma glycerol levels, and impaired glucose tolerance in FIAF transgenic mice fed a high fat diet. Remarkably, in mice the full-length form of FIAF was physically associated with HDL, whereas truncated FIAF was associated with low density lipoprotein. In human both full-length and truncated FIAF were associated with HDL. The composite data suggest that via physical association with plasma lipoproteins, FIAF acts as a powerful signal from fat and other tissues to prevent fat storage and stimulate fat mobilization. Our data indicate that disturbances in FIAF signaling might be involved in dyslipidemia.

VOLUME 281 (2006) PAGES 934-944Journal of Biological ChemistryVol. 281Issue 30PreviewPAGE 937: Full-Text PDF Open Access Obesity and associated diabetes mellitus type 2 have become major health concerns throughout the world. These ailments are intimately linked as excess weight greatly increases the likelihood of developing diabetes. Obesity also increases the risk for other clinical abnormalities such as hypertension and dyslipidemia. Although the positive association between obesity and several co-morbidities has been well established at the epidemiological level, the mechanisms behind these associations are much less clear. Much attention has been given to the role of plasma free fatty acids (FFAs), 3The abbreviations used are: FFAfree fatty acidFIAFfasting-induced adipose factorPPARperoxisome proliferator-activated receptorTGtriglycerideFIAF-TgFIAF transgenicVLDLvery low density lipoproteinHDLhigh density lipoproteinFPLCfast protein liquid chromatographyLPLlipoprotein lipaseWATwhite adipose tissueBATbrown adipose tissueHSLhormone-sensitive lipaseQ-PCRquantitative real time PCRHFDhigh fat dietLFDlow fat dietASPacylation-stimulating protein. which are elevated in the obese and able to disrupt cellular metabolism in several organs. However, it also has become evident that a variety of hormonal factors produced by adipose tissue can greatly affect organ functioning, especially at the metabolic and immunological levels (1Ahima R.S. Flier J.S. Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 2000; 11: 327-332Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1206) Google Scholar). Indeed, these so-called adipocytokines or adipokines are now known to affect diverse biological processes, ranging from energy intake, insulin sensitivity, and hepatic glucose production, to reproductive and immunological function (2Zhang Y.

A relatively poorly characterized adipocytokine that may be involved in regulation of plasma lipid metabolism is the fasting-induced adipose factor (FIAF), also known as PPARγ angiopoietin-related protein, angiopoietin-like protein 4, or hepatic fibrinogen/angiopoietin-related protein (6Kersten S.

FIAF is a glycoprotein of ∼50 kDa that belongs to the family of fibrinogen/angiopoietin-like proteins. In mice FIAF is most highly expressed in white and brown adipose tissue, and to a much lesser extent in other tissues such as heart, skeletal muscle, and liver (6Kersten S. Mandard S. Tan N.S.

The most compelling data to date link FIAF with regulation of lipid metabolism. FIAF was first identified as a target gene of the nuclear receptors PPARα and PPARγ, which govern lipid metabolism in liver and white adipose tissue, respectively (6Kersten S. Mandard S. Tan N.S.

Subsequent studies employing adenoviral-mediated overexpression of FIAF or injection of recombinant FIAF have shown that FIAF potently elevates plasma triglyceride (TG) levels (10Yoshida K. Shimizugawa T. Ono M. Furukawa H. J. Lipid Res. 2002; 43: 1770-1772Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar, 11Ge H. Yang G. Yu X. Pourbahrami T. Li C. J.

Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 6086-6091Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). This is possibly achieved by inhibition of lipoprotein lipase, the enzyme that is rate-limiting for plasma TG hydrolysis (10Yoshida K. Shimizugawa T. Ono M. Furukawa H. J. Lipid Res. 2002; 43: 1770-1772Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar, 11Ge H. Yang G. Yu X. Pourbahrami T. Li C. J.

Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 1767-1772Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). According to a recent report, FIAF may also potently lower plasma glucose levels. In wild-type C57/B6 as well as in db/db mice, adenoviral-mediated overexpression of FIAF was found to improve hyperglycemia, hyperinsulinemia, and glucose tolerance (12Xu A. Lam M.C. Chan K.W. Wang Y. Zhang J. Hoo R.L. Xu J.Y. Chen B. Chow W.S. Tso A.W. Lam K.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 6086-6091Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). In addition to lipid metabolism, FIAF has also been associated with angiogenesis. Expression of FIAF is up-regulated during hypoxia in both endothelial cells and cardiomyocytes, which probably occurs via the hypoxia-inducible factor 1α (HIF-1α) (14Belanger A.J. Lu H. Date T.

Furthermore, FIAF is expressed in certain tumors, especially in the hypoxic area surrounding necrotic cells, and has been suggested as a marker for conventional renal cell carcinoma. In the chicken chorioallantoic membrane assay, FIAF is able to induce a strong pro-angiogenic response (15Le Jan S. Amy C. Cazes A. Monnot C. Lamande N. Favier J. Philippe J. Sibony M. Gasc J.M. Corvol P. Germain S. Am. J. Pathol. 2003; 162: 1521-1528Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). In contrast, others have ascribed a potent anti-angiogenic function to FIAF (16Ito Y. Oike Y. Yasunaga K. Hamada K. Miyata K. Matsumoto S. Sugano S. Tanihara H. Masuho Y. Suda T. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 6651-6657PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the role of FIAF in angiogenesis remains ambiguous. To determine the physiological role of FIAF, we studied the effect of FIAF overexpression in a transgenic mouse model. Our data indicate that FIAF, which is physically associated with plasma lipoproteins, is an important determinant of plasma TG concentration and clearance at physiological levels of expression. In addition, it stimulates adipose tissue lipolysis. In contrast to a recent study (12Xu A. Lam M.C. Chan K.W. Wang Y. Zhang J. Hoo R.L. Xu J.Y. Chen B. Chow W.S. Tso A.W. Lam K.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 6086-6091Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar), in our model FIAF overexpression was associated with deterioration of glucose tolerance. Finally, we observed that the effects of FIAF overexpression were clearly amplified by feeding a high fat diet. Generation of FIAF Transgenic (FIAF-Tg) Mice—The complete murine FIAF gene was amplified by PCR (High fidelity Taq polymerase, Roche Applied Science) from genomic DNA of mouse ES cells (Sv129) using primers CGGGCTCCAGATCTTCTTCTGCACCAG and GTCAGAGGCGGCATTGGACCCCCTTGAAGTA and subcloned into the pGEM-Teasy vector (Promega, Leiden, the Netherlands). The proper sequence of the exons was verified by DNA sequencing. The mFIAF gene was subsequently cut out with NotI and placed behind the murine aP2 (adipocyte fatty acid-binding protein) promoter within pBS-SKII+ (kind gift of Dr. Bruce Spiegelman). The promoter plus the mFIAF gene were excised with ClaI and SacII and gel purified before being injected into fertilized oocytes (strain FVB-NIco, Eurogentec Transgenic Production Service, Seraing, Belgium). Genotyping was performed on genomic DNA from mouse ears by Q-PCR (Sybr Green) using primers GCCCCCATTGGTCACTCCTACAG and CGGCTCAGACTTAGACTTGCTC, which anneal within the aP2 promoter and the mFIAF gene, respectively, and control primers GCTGCTGGAGAATGAGTTGAATGC and CTCGGCTGAGTTTGAAGTTGAAGATG for the apoB gene. Animal Experiments—All mice were on a pure-bred FVB-NIco background. Male animals were kept in normal cages with food and water ad libitum. Mice in the fed state were sacrificed at the beginning of the light cycle. Mice in the fasted state were deprived of food for 6 h starting at the beginning of the light cycle. At the time of sacrifice animals were between 2 and 4 months of age. For the diet intervention, 2-month-old male mice were fed with a low or high fat diet for 10 weeks. The respective diets provided either 10 or 45% energy percent in the form of lard fat (D12450B or D12451, Research Diets, New Brunswick, NJ). Blood was collected via orbital puncture into EDTA tubes. Tissues were excised, weighed, and immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen. Intragastric Lipid Loading Test—Mice fasted for 16 h were administered 350 μl of olive oil (Bertolli, Extra Virgin) by intragastric gavage. Blood was collected by tail bleeding every 2 h for plasma TG measurement. VLDL Production Test—Mice fasted for 16 h were injected via the tail vein with 500 mg/kg bodyweight Triton WR1339 (Tyloxapol) under general anesthesia. Blood was collected by tail bleeding at several time points during 2.5 h for plasma TG measurement. Intraperitoneal Glucose Tolerance Test—After a 5-h fast mice were injected intraperitoneally with glucose (2 g/kg bodyweight on chow, 1 g/kg bodyweight on low fat/high fat diet). Blood was collected by tail bleeding after 0, 20, 40, 60, 90, and 150 min, and glucose was measured using Accucheck compact (Roche Diagnostics, Almere, the Netherlands). Insulin Tolerance Test—After a 5-h fast mice were injected intraperitoneally with insulin (0.75 unit/kg bodyweight). Blood was collected by tail bleeding after 0, 20, 40, and 60 min, and glucose was measured using Accucheck compact. Plasma Metabolites—Plasma was obtained from blood by centrifugation for 10 min at 10,000 × g. The plasma glucose concentration was determined using a kit from Elitech (Sopachem, Wageningen, the Netherlands). Plasma and tissue triglycerides, plasma glycerol, and plasma total and HDL-cholesterol concentration were determined using kits from Instruchemie (Delfzijl, the Netherlands). Plasma free fatty acids were determined using a kit from WAKO Chemicals (Sopachem, Wageningen, the Netherlands). Lipoprotein Profiling—Lipoproteins were separated using fast protein liquid chromatography (FPLC). 0.2 ml of pooled mouse plasma or human plasma was injected onto a Superose 6B 10/30 column (Amersham Biosciences) and eluted at a constant flow of 0.5 ml/min with PBS (pH 7.4). The effluent was collected in 0.5-ml fractions, and triglyceride and cholesterol levels were determined. Plasma LPL and Hepatic Lipase Level Assay—Plasma lipoprotein lipase (LPL) and hepatic lipase levels were determined in post-heparin plasma as described before (17Berbee J.F. van der Hoogt C.C. Sundararaman D. Havekes L.M. Rensen P.C. J. Lipid Res. 2005; 46: 297-306Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Q-PCR—Total RNA was extracted from tissues with TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). 1 μg of total RNA was reverse-transcribed with iScript (Bio-Rad). cDNA was PCR-amplified with Platinum Taq DNA polymerase (Invitrogen) on a Bio-Rad iCycler apparatus. Primers were designed to generate a PCR amplification product of 100-150 bp. Specificity of the amplification was verified by melt curve analysis and evaluation of efficiency of PCR amplification. Sequences of primers used are available on request. Immunoblot—Immunoblotting on FPLC fractions, plasma, and tissues was carried out as described previously (6Kersten S. Mandard S. Tan N.S. Escher P.

Chem. 2004; 279: 34411-34420Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). FIAF antibodies were directed against peptide epitopes within the N-terminal region of the mFIAF and hFIAF proteins. Microarray—RNA was prepared from adipose tissue of 10 wild-type and 10 FIAF-Tg mice using TRIzol and subsequently pooled per group. Pooled RNA was further purified using Qiagen RNeasy columns and the quality verified by laboratory on a chip analysis (Bioanalyzer 2100, Agilent). 1 μg of RNA was used for one cycle cRNA synthesis (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA). Hybridization, washing, and scanning of Affymetrix GeneChip mouse genome 430 2.0 arrays were carried out according to standard Affymetrix protocols. Fluorometric data were processed by Affymetrix GeneChip Operating software, and the gene chips were globally scaled to all the probe sets with an identical target intensity value. Further analysis was performed by Data Mining Tool (Affymetrix). Ethical Considerations—The animal experiments were approved by the animal experimentation committee of Wageningen University. All human experiments were approved by the medical ethics committee of Wageningen University. FIAF-Tg Mice Have Reduced Fat Mass—To investigate the role of FIAF in mammalian metabolism we generated transgenic mice that express mouse FIAF under the influence of the aP2 promoter (Fig. 1A), aiming at adipose tissue-specific overexpression (18Ross S.R. Graves R.A. Greenstein A. Platt K.A. Shyu H.L. Mellovitz B. Spiegelman B.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 9590-9594Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Two independent transgenic lines were obtained. Results presented here are from one transgenic line that showed up-regulation of mFIAF mRNA to levels similar to those achieved after fasting. FIAF mRNA was modestly up-regulated in white and brown adipose tissue and, unexpectedly, in skeletal muscle and heart, yet not in liver (Fig. 1, B and C). Activity of the transgene in skeletal muscle and heart is probably due to the design of the targeting vector, which contains the intact mouse FIAF gene. Previously, we showed that mFIAF gene expression is responsive to PPARs via a PPAR-responsive element within intron 3 (7Mandard S. Zandbergen F. Tan N.S. Escher P. Patsouris D. Koenig W. Kleemann R. Bakker A. Veenman F. Wahli W. Muller M. Kersten S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 34411-34420Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). For reasons that are not clear this did not cause FIAF overexpression in liver. The difference in FIAF mRNA between wild-type and FIAF-Tg mice was translated at the protein level, as observed by immunoblot on adipose tissue using purified anti-mFIAF antibody (Fig. 1D). A modest increase in FIAF-S2 and FIAF-S1 proteins, which are the predominant and most easily detectable (truncated) forms of mFIAF in blood plasma (7Mandard S. Zandbergen F. Tan N.S. Escher P. Patsouris D. Koenig W. Kleemann R. Bakker A. Veenman F. Wahli W. Muller M. Kersten S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 34411-34420Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar), was observed in plasma of FIAF-Tg mice (Fig. 1E and data not shown). Strikingly, FIAF-Tg mice weighed significantly less than their wild-type littermates (Fig. 2A). This was mostly due to a decrease in white adipose tissue (WAT) weight, which was ∼50% lower in FIAF-Tg mice (Fig. 2A). In contrast, liver weight as well as the weight of numerous other organs was unaltered in the FIAF-Tg mice, whereas weight of brown adipose tissue (BAT) was modestly decreased. Reduced WAT weight was due to a decrease in adipocyte size (Fig. 2B). Reduced adiposity was not the result of diminished food intake, which was identical between the two sets of mice (Fig. 2C). These data indicate that FIAF overexpression results in loss of body fat. FIAF-Tg Mice Display Hypertriglyceridemia and Hypercholesterolemia—To get a better understanding of the potential cause of the reduced adiposity, plasma lipid parameters were assessed in both fed and 6-h-fasted mice. A marked increase in plasma TG levels was observed in the FIAF-Tg mice, which was independent of their feeding status (Fig. 3A). In addition, plasma FFAs, glycerol, total cholesterol, and HDL-cholesterol concentrations were significantly elevated in the FIAF-Tg mice in the fasted state, whereas glucose was unchanged (Fig. 3, B-F). Thus, FIAF overexpression has profound effects on plasma lipid concentrations. Profiling of lipoproteins using FPLC analysis revealed that the increase in plasma TG in the 6-h-fasted animals was attributable to the VLDL fractions (Fig. 4A), whereas the increase in cholesterol was found in both VLDL and HDL fractions (Fig. 4B). Immunoblotting demonstrated a marked increase in apoB48 and apoB100 protein content in the VLDL fractions in FIAF-Tg mice, indicating that the number of VLDL particles in plasma is increased in these mice (Fig. 4C). It should be emphasized that in mice apoB48 accounts for approximately two-thirds of total apoB production in liver. Similarly, we found markedly increased apoAI and apoAII protein content in the HDL fractions in FIAF-Tg mice, pointing toward a pronounced increase in the number of HDL particles (Fig. 4D).FIGURE 4Fasting plasma VLDL and HDL concentrations are elevated in FIAF-Tg mice. Pooled plasma of 10 wild-type mice (gray squares) and 10 FIAF-Tg mice (black squares) fasted for 6 h was used for lipoprotein profiling by FPLC. Fractions were assayed for triglycerides (A), and cholesterol (B). Elution of protein markers is indicated.

To discriminate between these two possibilities, a VLDL production test and an oral lipid-loading test were performed. Despite greatly elevated 16-h fasting plasma TG levels in FIAF-Tg mice, no difference in VLDL production, determined by the slope of increase of plasma TG after injection with Triton WR1339, was observed between wild-type and FIAF-Tg mice (Fig. 5A). In contrast, an oral lipid loading test revealed dramatic differences between the two sets of mice. Whereas in wild-type mice intragastric loading of olive oil caused a moderate and transient increase in plasma TG, in FIAF-Tg mice plasma TG went up dramatically, reaching levels of almost 35 mm after 8 h (Fig. 5B). Post-prandial plasma FFAs were also significantly increased in FIAF-Tg mice (Fig. 5C). These data show unambiguously that clearance of TG-rich apoB-containing lipoproteins is severely inhibited by FIAF overexpression. Impaired clearance of plasma TG can be caused by decreased presence of lipoprotein lipase (LPL) and/or inhibition of LPL activity. To investigate whether total LPL content was altered, total hepatic lipase and LPL levels were determined in post-heparin plasma. Plasma levels of these lipases were very similar between wild-type and FIAF-Tg mice (Fig. 5, D and E). In addition, mRNA expression and tissue protein level of LPL in adipose tissue or skeletal muscle were not affected by FIAF overexpression (Fig. 5F and data not shown). This suggests that FIAF may block in vivo LPL activity, rather than reduce total LPL level. This notion is backed up by evidence showing inhibition of LPL activity by recombinant FIAF (10Yoshida K. Shimizugawa T. Ono M. Furukawa H. J. Lipid Res. 2002; 43: 1770-1772Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). Together, these data indicate that FIAF overexpression markedly impairs plasma TG clearance and accordingly raises plasma TG levels, most likely via inhibition of LPL activity. FIAF Is Physically Associated with HDL—Several proteins that are physically associated with plasma lipoproteins, including apoCs and apoAV, are known to influence LPL activity. Because FIAF overexpression increases fasting plasma VLDL and HDL levels, we hypothesized that FIAF may be physically associated with VLDL or HDL. To determine whether this is the case, immunoblotting was performed on the corresponding mouse plasma FPLC fractions using a well characterized anti-mFIAF antibody (6Kersten S. Mandard S. Tan N.S.

Remarkably, it was observed that full-length FIAF was present in the HDL fractions, but not in the VLDL fractions (Fig. 6A). A small band, corresponding to truncated FIAF-S2 (7Mandard S. Zandbergen F. Tan N.S. Escher P. Patsouris D. Koenig W. Kleemann R. Bakker A. Veenman F. Wahli W. Muller M. Kersten S. J. Biol.

Further analysis clearly demonstrated that truncated FIAF is present in the LDL fractions. Both full-length and truncated FIAF were more abundant in the HDL and LDL fractions, respectively, of FIAF-Tg mice (Fig. 6B). Remarkably, in human plasma full-length FIAF, truncated FIAF and FIAF multimers, the latter visualized by omitting dithiothreitol from the loading buffer, were associated exclusively with HDL (Fig. 6, C and D). Together, the data indicate that in mice the full-length form of FIAF is physically associated with HDL, whereas truncated FIAF is associated with LDL. In human both full-length and truncated FIAF are associated with HDL. The latter observation suggests that plasma FIAF and HDL levels may be correlated. Indeed, in a group of 16 healthy young subjects we found a significant positive correlation (r = 0.57, p = 0.01) between plasma levels of FIAF-S2 and HDL (Fig. 6E). In contrast, no significant correlation was found for plasma TG or LDL (data not shown). Gene Expression Changes in WAT of FIAF-Tg Mice Indicate Enhanced Lipolysis and Oxidative Metabolism—The parallel increase in plasma FFAs and glycerol in FIAF-Tg mice cannot be explained by inhibition of plasma TG catabolism but rather is indicative of enhanced adipose tissue lipolysis. Lipolysis is catalyzed by hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL), which is tightly regulated by numerous external stimuli, including insulin and β-adrenergic activity. mRNA expression of HSL was not altered in the FIAF-Tg mice, nor that of other genes that could affect plasma FFA and glycerol concentrations, including monoglyceride lipase, perilipin, PPARγ, and glycerol kinase (Fig. 7). Interestingly, expression of adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL)/desnutrin, a recently discovered adipose tissue lipase that works in conjunction with HSL (19Villena J.A. Roy S. Sarkadi-Nagy E.

Accordingly, the elevated plasma FFA and glycerol levels are likely caused by enhanced lipolysis possibly via up-regulation of ATGL/desnutrin.

https://openalex.org/W1974736226,"In contrast to the fairly reliable and complete annotation of the protein coding genes in the human genome, comparable information is lacking for noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs). We present a comparative screen of vertebrate genomes for structural noncoding RNAs, which evaluates conserved genomic DNA sequences for signatures of structural conservation of base-pairing patterns and exceptional thermodynamic stability. We predict more than 30,000 structured RNA elements in the human genome, almost 1,000 of which are conserved across all vertebrates. Roughly a third are found in introns of known genes, a sixth are potential regulatory elements in untranslated regions of protein-coding mRNAs and about half are located far away from any known gene. Only a small fraction of these sequences has been described previously. A comparison with recent tiling array data shows that more than 40% of the predicted structured RNAs overlap with experimentally detected sites of transcription. The widespread conservation of secondary structure points to a large number of functional ncRNAs and cis-acting mRNA structures in the human genome."

This microorganism is widely used in the manufacture of fermented meats and has biotechnological potential in biopreservation and food safety. We have explored the 1,884,661-base-pair (bp) circular chromosome of strain 23K encoding 1,883 predicted genes. Genome sequencing revealed a specialized metabolic repertoire, including purine nucleoside scavenging that may contribute to an ability to successfully compete on raw meat products. Many genes appear responsible for robustness during the rigors of food processing – particularly resilience against changing redox and oxygen levels. Genes potentially responsible for biofilm formation and cellular aggregation that may assist the organism to colonize meat surfaces were also identified.

Other possible explanations for incomplete tumor growth inhibition following treatment with anti-VEGF antibodies include the following: insufficient binding affinity or tumor penetration; VEGF-related molecules (e.g. PlGF and VEGF-C) that may act independently or in concert with VEGF-A in promoting angiogenesis (17Autiero M.

Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 6253-6258PubMed Google Scholar) and others (19Kim E.S. Serur A. Huang J. Manley C.A. McCrudden K.W. Frischer J.S. Soffer S. Ring L. New T. Zabski S. Rudge J.S. Holash J.

It was reasoned that these receptor decoys can block both human and murine VEGF (11Gerber H.P. Kowalski J. Sherman D. Eberhard D.A. Ferrara N. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 6253-6258PubMed Google Scholar) or that the receptor fragments have higher affinity than the available anti-h-VEGF antibody (19Kim E.S. Serur A. Huang J. Manley C.A.

Therefore, the specific contribution of VEGF-A cannot be defined by using these receptor decoys. As for affinity, direct comparison of anti-VEGF antibody with receptor decoy was not meaningful because of their different specificities. Other inhibitors such as inhibitors against VEGFR2 also cannot reveal the specific role of VEGF-A because VEGF-C and VEGF-D can also activate VEGFR2. To clarify these issues, antibodies that can directly and specifically block VEGF of both tumor and stromal sources would be the tool to examine whether blocking VEGF alone is sufficient for complete inhibition of tumor growth or whether the binding affinity of the antibody affects the potency and efficacy. Furthermore, a comparison between cross-reactive antibodies and antibodies that block only tumor-derived VEGF may reveal the level of dependence on stromal VEGF for tumor growth. VEGF-A is a member of the homodimeric cysteine knot protein family growth factor (6Ferrara N. Endocr. Rev. 2004; 25: 581-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (3009) Google Scholar). Two tyrosine kinase receptors mediate the signal activity of VEGF, VEGFR1 (Flt-1) and VEGFR2 (KDR), with the latter as the main receptor mediating most of the endothelial cell action as clearly demonstrated by VEGF variant and homologues that only can bind VEGFR2 (22Gille H.

The role of VEGFR1 is less clear, but it has high affinity for VEGF-A, VEGF-B, and PlGF, with the latter two being VEGFR1-specific ligands.

Fuh G. Christinger H.W. Eigenbrot C. Wells J.A. de Vos A.M. Cell. 1997; 91: 695-704Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar), revealed that the VEGF epitope for Avastin and for VEGFR1 or VEGFR2 have sufficient overlap for mutual exclusion. Human and murine VEGFs are 85% identical in sequence. More than 10 hybridoma antibodies against human VEGF were generated, but none can bind murine VEGF, which is expected as mice remove self-reactive antibodies. The high homology of murine VEGF with rat or hamster VEGF also made it difficult to generate the desired monoclonal antibodies in these animals. To identify antibodies that cross-react with murine and human VEGFs, we employed phage-displayed synthetic antibody libraries, which were generated by randomizing the complementarity determining regions (CDRs) of heavy chain in the humanized anti-ErbB2 antibody 4D5 (h4D5-8) template in a manner that mimicked the diversity of natural human antibodies (28Lee C.V. Liang W.-C. Dennis M.S. Eigenbrot C. Sidhu S.S. Fuh G. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 340: 1073-1093Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Humanized 4D5-8 contains the commonly used framework (VH-3/Vk-1); thus antibodies isolated from the libraries would mimic natural human antibodies. Another main advantage of antibody generation with phage libraries is its in vitro selection process that should be indifferent to the cross-species conservation (29Winter G. Griffiths A.D. Hawkins R.E. Hoogenboom H.R. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1994; 12: 433-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (1393) Google Scholar, 30Hoogenboom H.R. Methods Mol. Biol. 2002; 178: 1-37PubMed Google Scholar). In this study, we report the identification of cross-human and murine VEGF binding clones, G6 and B20. We examined the affinity-improved G6 and B20 variants for their binding affinities, specificities, and VEGF blocking activities in comparison to the hybridoma-derived anti-h-VEGF antibody, A4.6.1 (or the humanized version, Avastin), and we identified variants suitable for in vivo studies, G6-31 and B20-4.1. In inhibiting h-VEGF action in vitro, B20-4.1 was equipotent to Avastin, and G6-31 was equipotent to Y0317. The cross-species anti-VEGF antibodies examined the specific role of VEGF in the tumor progression using mouse models. Binding Specificity of G6 and B20—Competitive ELISAs were used to determine the relative binding affinity of phage clones displaying anti-VEGF Fab to h-VEGF and m-VEGF as described (28Lee C.V. Liang W.-C. Dennis M.S. Eigenbrot C. Sidhu S.S. Fuh G. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 340: 1073-1093Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Briefly, Fab phage were incubated with serial dilutions of h-VEGF or m-VEGF in PBS with 0.5% BSA and 0.05% Tween 20 (PBT) for 2 h, and then unbound Fab phage were captured with VEGF-coated 96-well Maxisorp ELISA plate (Nunc, Roskilde, Denmark) and detected by anti-M13 phage antibody conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (HRP) (Amersham Biosciences) followed by substrate. EC50 values, the concentrations of VEGF incubated with Fab phage in solution that were effective in binding 50% of Fab phage to block their binding to immobilized VEGF were reported. Fab protein was prepared from Escherichia coli harboring the plasmid of the G6 Fab expression construct under the promoter of alkaline phosphatase and secretion leader sequence stII and was purified with the protein G affinity column as described (28Lee C.V. Liang W.-C. Dennis M.S. Eigenbrot C. Sidhu S.S. Fuh G. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 340: 1073-1093Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). IgGs were generated with mammalian cell transfection and purified with protein A affinity column. For examining binding specificities, VEGF and various homologues were first coated on an ELISA plate at 2 μg/ml in PBS and blocked with 0.5% BSA and 0.05% Tween 20. Serial dilutions of Fabs or IgGs were then incubated in VEGF variant-coated wells for 1 h and measured with anti-human antibody HRP diluted in PBT buffer. The VEGF homologues, mouse and human PlGF-2, human VEGF-C, mouse VEGF-D, human and mouse VEGF-B, were purchased from R & D Systems (Minneapolis, MN). Solution binding assays were also carried out in case some protein became unfunctional upon coating on the plate. Fabs or IgG (0.5 nm) were incubated with VEGF homologues at different concentrations for 1-2 h, and the unbound antibodies were captured with m-VEGF-coated ELISA wells and detected as above. The results were consistent with the direct binding ELISA format. VEGF Receptor Blocking Assay—Initial blocking assays were performed by phage ELISA. Murine VEGF-coated ELISA wells were first incubated with increasing concentrations of receptor fragments for 30 min, and phage displaying Fabs were then added. Bound phage were measured as described above. Purified Fabs and IgGs were then used to confirm receptor blocking activities. VEGF receptor-immobilized plates were prepared by capturing VEGFR2 ECD (Ig domain 1-7) as Fcγ fusion with goat anti-human IgG Fcγ (Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA) on the ELISA plate, whereas VEGFR1 ECD fragment (Ig domains 1-5) (VEGFR1D1-5) was coated directly. Biotinylated h-VEGF165 or m-VEGF164 (∼2 nm) was first incubated with 3-fold serially diluted anti-VEGF antibodies in PBT. After 1-2 h of incubation at room temperature, the mixtures were transferred to a VEGF receptor-immobilized plate and incubated for 10 min. The unblocked VEGF-A was captured with VEGF receptor-coated wells and detected by streptavidin-HRP conjugates as described above. Anti-VEGF Antibodies Binding Affinities—For binding affinity measurements, surface plasmon resonance measurements with BIAcore™-3000 (BIAcore, Inc., Piscataway, NJ) were employed. Carboxymethylated dextran biosensor chips (CM5, BIAcore, Inc.) were activated with N-ethyl-N′-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide hydrochloride and N-hydroxysuccinimide according to the supplier's instructions. Human or murine VEGF was immobilized to achieve ∼60 response units. 2-Fold serial dilutions of Fab or IgG (0.78-500 nm) were injected in PBS with 0.05% Tween 20 (PBST) at 37 or 25 °C (data not shown) at a flow rate of 25 μl/min. Association rates (kon) and dissociation rates (koff) were calculated using one-to-one Langmuir binding model (BIAcore evaluation software version 3.2). The equilibrium dissociation constant (Kd) was derived as the ratio koff/kon. HUVEC Assay of VEGF Inhibition—Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) (Clontech) were grown and assayed as described (31Fuh G. Li B. Crowley C. Cunningham B. Wells J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11197-11204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). Approximately 4000 HUVECs were plated in each well of the 96-well cell culture plate and incubated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's/F-12 medium (1:1) supplemented with 1.5% (v/v) fetal bovine serum (assay medium) for 18 h. Fresh assay medium with fixed amounts of VEGF (∼0.15 nm final concentration), which was first titrated as a level of VEGF that can stimulate submaximal DNA synthesis, and increasing concentrations of anti-VEGF antibodies were then added to the cells. After incubation at 37 °C for 18 h, cells were pulsed with 0.5 μCi/well of [3H]thymidine for 24 h and harvested for counting with TopCount Microplate Scintillation counter. Tumor Implantation and in Vivo Treatments—HM-7, A673, and HPAC cells (American Type Culture Collection) were maintained in culture with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's/F-12 medium, supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Cells were grown at 37 °C in 5% CO2 until confluent and then harvested and resuspended in sterile Matrigel at a concentration of 25 × 106 cells/ml. Xenografts were established in 6-8-week-old female Beige Nude XID mice by dorsal flank subcutaneous injection of 5 × 106 cells/mouse and allowed to grow. When tumors reached a volume of 500 mm3 for HM-7 and 150-200 mm3 for A673 and HPAC (48 h), a cohort was randomly selected (n = 10) as day 0 controls. The remaining mice were divided into groups of 10, and antibodies were administered intraperitoneally at the same dose for each group. Tumor sizes and weights were measured as described (11Gerber H.P. Kowalski J. Sherman D. Eberhard D.A. Ferrara N. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 6253-6258PubMed Google Scholar). All statistical analyses used Student's t test. Histology and Staining—Tumor were fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin for 12-16 h prior to paraffin embedding. Histologic sections of 4-5 μm thickness were stained with hematoxylin and eosin as described previously (32Gerber H.P. Hillan K.J. Ryan A.M. Kowalski J. Keller G.A. Rangell L. Wright B.D. Radtke F. Aguet M. Ferrara N. Development (Camb.). 1999; 126: 1149-1159Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Vascular density was assessed in MECA-32 (anti-PLVAP)-stained histological sections of tumors, essentially as described previously (33Samson M. Peale Jr., F.V. Frantz G. Rioux-Leclercq N.

For each tumor, three representative images, centered 500 μm from the tumor margin, were analyzed. ELISAs for VEGF Protein in Tumor Extract and Anti-VEGF in Mice Serum—For VEGF in tumors, 400-800 μg of excised tumor was homogenized in RIPA buffer (100 μl/μg) containing 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 1% deoxycholic acid, 1% Triton X-100, and 0.25% SDS, and supernatants were collected. Human VEGF ELISA of high sensitivity was performed as described (34Rodriguez C.R. Fei D.T. Keyt B. Baly D.L. J. Immunol. Methods. 1998; 219: 45-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Briefly, sandwich ELISA used monoclonal antibody 3.5F8 (Genentech) to h-VEGF as coat, and biotinylated A4.6.1 as detecting antibody. VEGF165 standards (1-128 pg/ml in 2-fold serial dilution) and samples were measured side by side. This ELISA does not detect m-VEGF. To measure m-VEGF, sandwiched ELISA used goat anti-m-VEGF antibody (R&D Systems) as coat and the same antibody in the biotinylated form for detection; m-VEGF standards (3.9-500 pg/ml in 2-fold serial dilutions) and tumor extract in sample buffer were measured side by side. The cross-reactivity of h-VEGF occurred when concentration was above 2000 ng/ml at <0.4%. For serum anti-VEGF (uncomplexed), ELISA plates were coated overnight with 0.5 μg/ml VEGF165 in 50 mm sodium carbonate, pH 9.6, blocked, washed, and then incubated with 2-fold serial dilutions of serum samples or anti-VEGF standards (0.20-25 ng/ml for Y0317 and Avastin, 0.39-50 ng/ml for B20-4.1, and 0.1-12.8 ng/ml for G6-31) in 0.05% BSA, 0.2% bovine γ-globulin, 0.25% CHAPS, 5 mm EDTA, 0.35 m NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20 in PBS, pH 7.4 (samples buffer), for 2 h. Bound antibodies were detected by appropriate anti-IgG-HRP conjugates, e.g. anti-human Fc-HRP (Jackson ImmunoResearch) for Avastin, Y0317, and G6-31 as human IgG1, and anti-mouse IgG2a-HRP (Pharmingen) for B20-4.1, which had mouse IgG2a constant domains. Total antibodies (complexed and uncomplexed) were measured with ELISA plates coated with appropriate anti-IgG antibodies as above. Bound antibodies were detected with the same anti-IgG antibodies conjugated with HRP. By using the same assay for B20-4.1, we observed that serum from control nude mice with no injected antibodies contained less than 0.2 μg/ml mouse IgG2a. G6 and B20 Bind Human and Murine VEGF—G6 and B20 were among several clones isolated from a synthetic antibody phage library with humanized anti-ErbB2 antibody, h4D5, as the template by selection against m-VEGF. The binding specificity and receptor blocking activity of these phage clones displaying the antigen-binding fragment (Fab) were first examined (Fig. 1A). G6, the clone with the best apparent affinity for m-VEGF (EC50 = 0.6 nm), also showed near equivalent binding for h-VEGF at 1.4 nm (EC50). B20, however, binds m-VEGF and h-VEGF with relative affinity of 44 and 300 nm, respectively. To assess which antibody clone can block VEGF binding to its receptors, VEGFR2 ECD with seven Ig-like domains (VEGFR2D1-7) (Fig. 1B) or the second Ig domain of VEGFR1 ECD (VEGFR1D2) (Fig. 1C) was used to block the interaction of Fab-displaying phage with m-VEGF. Strong blocking was observed with G6 and B20 by both receptor fragments, suggesting that their epitopes on VEGF overlapped with the epitopes for receptor fragments. As B20 had weak and different affinity for h-VEGF and m-VEGF, it went through a first step of affinity improvement by selection in a phage-displayed library with light chain CDR residues randomized. Variant B20-4 exhibited equal apparent affinities for both h-VEGF and m-VEGF (EC50 ∼15 nm) (see supplemental Fig. 1). Next, G6 and B20-4 Fab were generated to confirm the binding specificities. G6 and B20-4 as Fabs indeed demonstrated near equal affinity for human and murine VEGF (see Table 1 for Kd values), and no detectable binding to other VEGF homologues, h- and m-PlGF, h-VEGF-B (and m-VEGF-B, not shown), h-VEGF-D (Fig. 1D), and VEGF-C (data not shown). G6 also bound rat and rabbit VEGF with similar affinity as for m-VEGF (data not shown). The receptor blocking activity of G6 or B20-4 Fab was confirmed by blocking both h- and m-VEGF binding to VEGFR2 (1-7 Ig domain ECD) (Fig. 1E) or VEGFR1 (1-5 Ig domain ECD) (m-VEGF blocking for VEGFR2 binding shown, and the rest is not shown). Avastin Fab (Fab-12), in comparison, can only block h-VEGF but not m-VEGF binding to the receptor as expected (Fig. 1E). An Avastin variant with improved affinity for h-VEGF, Y0317, showed slight m-VEGF-blocking activity at high concentrations as it acquired a weak binding affinity for m-VEGF (26Chen Y. Wiesmann C.

Many G6 variants were isolated that differed from G6 by four or five residues in the CDR-L3, e.g. G6-8, G6-23, and G6-31. B20-4 was further improved by mutations in heavy chain CDRs to B20-4.1 (see supplemental Fig. 1). Binding affinities (Kd) of the improved variants as Fab or IgG protein were measured at 37 °C with surface plasmon resonance (BIAcore™) on immobilized human or murine VEGF in comparison to A4.6.1, Avastin (Fab-12 as Fab), and the affinity-improved version Y0317 (Table 1). The avidity advantage exhibited by the IgG reduced the apparent off-rates, but the overall ranking of these antibodies held. The improved G6 and B20 variants have similar affinities for human and murine VEGF. Compared with hybridoma-derived Avastin (or Fab-12 as Fab), B20-4.1 binds h-VEGF with similar affinity (∼4-8 nm as Fab and 2 nm as IgG) and kinetic profile of on-rate, kon, and off-rate, koff. Avastin was used interchangeably with A4.6.1 in the study as they have equivalent activities in vitro and in vivo (35Presta L.G. Chen H. O'Connor S.J. Chisholm V. Meng Y.G. Krummen L. Winkler M.

https://openalex.org/W2009979784,"ADP-ribosylation is a post-translational modification resulting from transfer of the ADP-ribose moiety of NAD to protein. Mammalian cells contain mono-ADP-ribosyltransferases that catalyze the formation of ADP-ribose-(arginine) protein, which can be cleaved by a 39-kDa ADP-ribose-(arginine) protein hydrolase (ARH1), resulting in release of free ADP-ribose and regeneration of unmodified protein. Enzymes involved in poly(ADP-ribosylation) participate in several critical physiological processes, including DNA repair, cellular differentiation, and carcinogenesis. Multiple poly(ADP-ribose) polymerases have been identified in the human genome, but there is only one known poly(ADP-ribose) glycohydrolase (PARG), a 111-kDa protein that degrades the (ADP-ribose) polymer to ADP-ribose. We report here the identification of an ARH1-like protein, termed poly(ADP-ribose) hydrolase or ARH3, which exhibited PARG activity, generating ADP-ribose from poly-(ADP-ribose), but did not hydrolyze ADP-ribose-arginine, -cysteine, -diphthamide, or -asparagine bonds. The 39-kDa ARH3 shares amino acid sequence identity with both ARH1 and the catalytic domain of PARG. ARH3 activity, like that of ARH1, was enhanced by Mg2+. Critical vicinal acidic amino acids in ARH3, identified by mutagenesis (Asp77 and Asp78), are located in a region similar to that required for activity in ARH1 but different from the location of the critical vicinal glutamates in the PARG catalytic site. All findings are consistent with the conclusion that ARH3 has PARG activity but is structurally unrelated to PARG.

Mono-ADP-ribosylation is a post-translational modification of proteins in which the ADP-ribose moiety of NAD is transferred to specific amino acid in proteins, altering their structure and function (1Williamson K.C. Moss J. Moss J. Vaughan M. ADP-ribosylating Toxins and G Proteins: Insights into Signal Transduction. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1990: 493-510Google Scholar). Mono-ADP-ribosylation was first shown to be important in the action of several bacterial toxins (e.g. cholera toxin, diphtheria toxin, pertussis toxin), where the contribution of the toxin to disease pathogenesis results from its ability to ADP-ribosylate and thereby modify the activity of critical proteins (2Moss J. Vaughan M. ADP-ribosylating Toxins and G Proteins: Insights into Signal Transduction. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D.C.1990Google Scholar, 3Krueger K.M. Barbieri J.T. Clin. Microbiol. Rev. 1995; 8: 34-47Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For example, cholera toxin ADP-ribosylates and activates Gαs, the α subunit of the heterotrimeric guanine nucleotide-binding protein Gs, which, in turn, activates adenylyl cyclase and increases cyclic AMP synthesis, leading to abnormalities of fluid and electrolyte transport characteristic of cholera (4Fishman P.H. Moss J. Vaughan M. ADP-ribosylating Toxins and G Proteins: Insights into Signal Transduction. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D.C.1990: 127-140Google Scholar). Bacterial toxin mono-ADP-ribosyltransferases use specific amino acids as ADP-ribose acceptors; thus, cholera toxin modifies an arginine (5Moss J. Vaughan M. J. Biol.

Mono-ADP-ribosylation of arginine appears to be a reversible process (1Williamson K.C. Moss J. Moss J. Vaughan M. ADP-ribosylating Toxins and G Proteins: Insights into Signal Transduction.

A regulatory function for an ADP-ribosylation cycle was demonstrated in the photosynthetic bacterium Rhodospirillum rubrum, where it regulates dinitrogenase reductase, a key enzyme in nitrogen fixation (23Lowery R.G.

In mammals, only one ADP-ribosylarginine hydrolase, ARH1, has been identified (12Glowacki G. Braren R. Firner K. Nissen M. Kuhl M. Reche P. Bazan F. Cetkovic-Cvrlje M. Leiter E. Haag F. Koch-Nolte F.

It cleaves the ADP-ribose-arginine bond in modified proteins, consistent with the regulation of ADP-ribosyl(arginine) protein levels by the opposing activities of transferases and hydrolases, participating in an ADP-ribosylation cycle (9Okazaki I.J.

The amount of ADP-ribose polymer, like that of mono-ADP-ribosylated protein, appears to be regulated, in part, by enzymes that cleave the poly(ADP-ribose) chain. These include a poly(ADP-ribose) glycohydrolase (PARG), which releases free ADP-ribose from polymers (29Bonicalzi M.E. Haince J.F. Droit A. Poirier G.G. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2005; 62: 739-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Only one 111-kDa PARG has been identified in the human genome (20Diefenbach J. Burkle A. Cell Mol.

Meyer R.G. Coyle D.L. Jacobson E.L. Jacobson M.K. Exp. Cell Res. 2004; 297: 521-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). The critical importance of PARG is evidenced by embryonic lethality of a PARG knockout mouse (32Koh D.W. Lawler A.M. Poitras M.F. Sasaki M. Wattler S. Nehls M.C. Stoger T. Poirier G.G. Dawson V.L.

The presence of multiple potential PARPs in the human genome prompted us to look for other PARGs that might differ in structure and function from the known enzyme and perhaps be involved in the degradation of poly-(ADP-ribose) synthesized by different members of the PARP family (29Bonicalzi M.E. Haince J.F. Droit A. Poirier G.G. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2005; 62: 739-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Two other proteins in the mouse and human gene data bases, the 39-kDa ARH2 and ARH3, appear to resemble ARH1 and differ in structure from the 111-kDa PARG (12Glowacki G. Braren R. Firner K. Nissen M.

We hypothesized that these ARH1-like proteins might be capable of hydrolyzing other ADP-ribose linkages. As reported here, ARH3, a 39-kDa protein with an amino acid sequence 22% identical to that of ARH1, degraded poly(ADP-ribose) to ADP-ribose monomers; it did not hydrolyze ADP-ribose-arginine, -cysteine, -diphthamide, or -asparagine. This new member of the PARG family might have different function(s) from previously studied enzymes and could play a specific role(s) in regulation of ADP-ribose metabolism.

Mouse and Human ADP-ribosyl-Acceptor Hydrolase Constructs and Mutagenesis—To clone members of the ARH family, we used DNA sequences (GenBank™) of mouse ARH1 (mARH1; L13290), mouse ARH2 (mARH2; AJ427360), mouse ARH3 (mARH3; AJ427296), human ARH1 (hARH1; L13291), human ARH2 (hARH2; AJ313429), and human ARH3 (hARH3; AJ313333) to design forward and reverse PCR primers with unique restriction enzyme sites (Table 1). Mouse and human hydrolase cDNAs were amplified from a Marathon-Ready brain cDNA library (Clontech, Mountain View, CA) using the Advantage 2 PCR enzyme system (Clontech). PCR products were subcloned using a Zero Blunt TOPO PCR cloning kit (Invitrogen). Plasmid cDNAs were isolated (QIAprep Spin Miniprep kit; Qiagen). Mutations were generated using the Stratagene QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis method, according to the manufacturer's protocol. Complementary mutant primers used to generate ARH3 mutants are shown in Table 1. The entire coding regions were ligated into pGEX-2T expression vector (Amersham Biosciences) for transfection into Escherichia coli BL21 Rosetta supercompetent cells (Novagen, Madison, WI). Positive clones were confirmed by DNA sequencing (ABI PRISM 377; PerkinElmer Life Sciences) of the entire open reading frames in both directions. Proteins synthesized as glutathione S-transferase fusion products were purified using glutathione-Sepharose 4B according to the manufacturer's instructions (Amersham Biosciences).TABLE 1PCR primersPrimersSequences (5′-3′)Restriction enzyme/MutationPrimers used to generate recombinant ARH mARH1 forwardTAGGATCC1ATGGGTGGGGGGCTGATT18BamHI mARH1 reverseTAGAATTC1089CTAGGGATCTAATACAGG1072EcoRI mARH2 forwardTACCCGCCA1ATGGAGAAGTTCAAGGCTGCA21SmaI mARH2 reverseTAGAATTC1062TTACTTTTCTTCTGTGGACAG1042EcoRI mARH3 forwardTAGGATCC1ATGGCGGTGGCTGCGGCGGCA21BamHI mARH3 reverseTAGAATTC1113TTACGAGCTCTCCTGGAAGAC1093EcoRI hARH1 forwardTACCCGCCA1ATGGAGAAGTATGTGGCTGC20SmaI hARH1 reverseTAGAATTC1074CTAAAGGGAAATTACAGTGTCTTC1053EcoRI hARH2 forwardTAGGATCC1ATGGAGAAATTTAAGGCTGCG21SmaI hARH2 reverseTAGAATTC1065TTACTTCTCCTCTGTGGACAG1045EcoRI hARH3 forwardTAGGATCC1ATGGCCGCAGCGGCGATGGCG21BamHI hARH3 reverseTAGAATTC1092TCAACTCTTCTGGAAGACACG1072EcoRIPrimers used to generate human ARH3 mutants D77N/D78N forward216CTTGTACTACACAAATAACACAGCCATGGCC246Gly → Ala D77N/D78N reverse246GGCCATGGCTGTGTTATTTGTGTAGTACAAG216Cys → Thr E261Q/E262Q forward770CGGTGACCAGGCAGCAAGTGGTGTCTGAG798Gly → Cys E261Q/E262Q reverse798CTCAGACACCACTTGCTGCCTGGTCACCG770Cys → Gly E238Q/E239Q forward700GAGTTGGGCATGCAGCAGCGTCCATACTCC729Gly → Cys E238Q/E239Q reverse729GGAGTATGGACGCTGCTGCATGCCCAACTC700Cys → Gly Open table in a new tab Anti-ARH3 Antibodies—Rabbits were immunized with a peptide (CTDVLAQSLHRVFQESS) representing amino acids 355–370 of mouse ARH3 with cysteine added at the N terminus to facilitate coupling to keyhole limpet hemocyanin. Antibodies were purified from sera of two rabbits, using a peptide affinity column. Tissue Fractionation and Western Blotting—To prepare proteins for Western blotting, tissue from 1–4 C57BL6J mice of each sex (1 g per 5 ml of homogenizing buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm NaN3, 1 mm DTT, 250 mm sucrose), containing 0.5 mm 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride, leupeptin (10 μg/ml), aprotinin (10 μg/ml), and pepstatin A (1 μg/ml)) was homogenized with 20 strokes of a Dounce tissue grinder (Wheaton Scientific, Millville, NJ). The homogenate was centrifuged (1000 × g, 10 min), and the postnuclear supernatant was centrifuged (100,000 × g, 90 min) to separate cytosol and membrane fractions. Membranes were homogenized in 0.5 ml of homogenizing buffer. HepG2 cells were grown (37 °C, 5% CO2, 95% air) in DMEM with 10% FBS (Invitrogen), penicillin G (100 units/ml), and streptomycin (100 μg/ml) on collagen I-coated dishes (BD Biosciences). Confluent cells from 10 15-cm plates (3 × 108 cells total) were harvested by scraping in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (0.14 m NaCl, 8.1 mm Na2HPO4, 1.5 mm KH2PO4; BioSource International, Camarillo, CA), washed twice with the same solution, sedimented by centrifugation (1,000 × g, 5 min), and homogenized with 10 strokes in a 7-ml Dounce tissue grinder (Wheaton Scientific) in 4 ml of TKMS buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 25 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 250 mm sucrose) containing 0.5 mm 4-(2)-aminomethylbenzenesulfonyl fluoride, leupeptin (10 μg/ml), aprotinin (10 μg/ml), and pepstatin A (1 μg/ml). The homogenate was centrifuged (4,000 × g, 10 min) to sediment nuclei, unbroken cells, and cell debris (crude nuclear fraction), and supernatant was centrifuged (100,000 × g, 90 min, 4 °C) to separate cytosol and membranes. To prepare pure nuclei, the crude nuclear fraction was washed once with TKMS buffer, incubated at 37 °C for 45 min in 2 ml of TKMS buffer, washed twice with TKMS buffer, and applied to the top of a sucrose gradient (2-ml layers of TKMS buffer containing 2.5, 2.25, 2.0, 1.75, and 1.5 m sucrose), which was then centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 90 min at 4 °C. Pure nuclei were collected at the 1.75–2 m interface and washed twice with TKMS buffer (33Padilla P.I. Pacheco-Rodriguez G. Moss J. Vaughan M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Samples (25 μg) of homogenate proteins and recombinant ARH3 (25 ng) were subjected to SDS-PAGE in 4–12% gels and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, which were reacted with antibodies against ARH3 (0.5 μg/ml). Secondary goat anti-rabbit IgG antibodies conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Southern Biotech) were detected using SuperSignal chemiluminescent substrate (Pierce), followed by exposure to x-ray films (Eastman Kodak Co., Rochester, NY). ADP-ribose-Proteins Synthesized by Bacterial Toxins as Potential ARH Substrates—ADP-ribose-proteins were synthesized using toxin ADP-ribosyltransferases.

Gαi and Gαo were extracted from brain membrane fraction (50 mg) by stirring on ice for 1 h in 4 ml of homogenizing buffer plus 1% sodium cholate. After centrifugation (100,000 × g, 1 h), the supernatant containing G-proteins was collected (35Waldo G.L. Evans T. Fraser E.D. Northup J.K. Martin M.W. Harden T.K. Biochem.

After termination of the reactions with the addition of 6 μl of 5× Laemmli buffer, samples of proteins (30 μg) were separated by SDS-PAGE, in 12 or 4–20% polyacrylamide gels, and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, which were exposed to x-ray films for 10 h (Kodak). Preparation of Radiolabeled Poly(ADP-ribose)PARP—[32P]Autopoly-ADP-ribosylated PARP ([32P]poly(ADP-ribose)PARP), synthesized by incubation (37 °C, 10 min) in a 300-μl volume of 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 10 μm [32P]NAD (10 μCi/reaction), 10 mm MgCl2, 5 mm DTT, containing 6 μg of PARP (Biomol), and 6 μg of calf thymus DNA, was collected as described for [32P]mono-ADP-ribosylated proteins. Protein-free poly(ADP-ribose) was prepared using dihydroboronyl-Bio Rex affinity resin as described (38Alvarez-Gonzalez R. Juarez-Salinas H. Jacobson E.L. Jacobson M.K. Anal. Biochem. 1983; 135: 69-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Briefly, [32P]poly(ADP-ribose)PARP (12 μg) in 300 μl of 50 mm MOPS, pH 8.6, containing 6 m guanidine HCl, 0.5 m NH2OH, was incubated (37 °C, 2 h) before the addition of 200 μl of dihydroboronyl-Bio Rex affinity resin and rotation of the mixture at 25 °C overnight. The matrix was washed sequentially with 5 ml of 6 m guanidine HCl in 50 mm MOPS, pH 8.6, 5 ml of 1 m NH4HCO3, pH 8.8, and 5 ml of 250 mm NH4CO3, pH 8.8, followed by elution with 3 ml of water at 40 °C; the eluate, containing ∼85% of radiolabeled poly(ADP-ribose), was concentrated by evaporation to 500 μl and stored at –20 °C. To prepare [14C]poly(ADP-ribose)PARP for HPLC experiments, [32P]NAD was replaced by 10 μm [14C]NAD (0.5 μCi/reaction). Poly(ADP-ribose) Hydrolysis by Autoradiography—[32P]Poly(ADP-ribose)PARP (500 ng of PARP with poly(ADP-ribose)) was incubated (37 °C, 2 h) with 2 μm ARH in 25 μl of 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, with or without 10 mm MgCl2 and/or 5 mm DTT. Reactions were stopped by adding 6 μl of 5× Laemmli buffer. Samples (20 μl) of proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE in 4–20% gels and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, which were exposed to x-ray film (Kodak) for 10 h. Hydrolysis of Poly(ADP-ribose) by PARG and ARH3—Purified [32P]poly(ADP-ribose) (5.5 × 105 cpm, ∼300 nm ADP-ribose) was incubated for the indicated time at 37 °C in 25 μl of 50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.5, containing 10 mm MgCl2 and 5 mm DTT with enzyme or other additions as indicated; the reaction was terminated by the addition of 25 μl of 2× electrophoresis buffer (Invitrogen). [32P]AMP was generated by incubation (37 °C, 3 h) of 10 μm [32P]NAD (10 μCi/reaction) with pyrophosphatase (40 units/mg from Sigma; 1 mg/ml) in 25 μl of 50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.5, and 10 mm MgCl2. [32P]ADP-ribose was generated in a 25-μl mixture containing 50 mm KPO4, pH 7.5, 25 μg of activated CTA, 10 μm [32P]NAD (10 μCi/reaction), 10 mm MgCl2, and 5 mm DTT, which was incubated at 30 °C overnight. [32P]Phosphoribosyl-AMP was generated by incubation (37°C, 3 h) of [32P]poly(ADP-ribose) (5.5 × 105 cpm, ∼300 nm ADP-ribose) with Crotalus adamanteus phosphodiesterase (10 milliunits/reaction), 25 μl of 50 mm KPO4, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, and 5 mm DTT. Identities of AMP and ADP-ribose standards were confirmed by HPLC on C18 and SAX columns, respectively. High Resolution PAGE—Polyacrylamide (20%) gels (20 × 20 × 0.15 cm), containing polyacrylamide and bis(acrylamide), in a ratio of 19:1, 100 mm Tris borate, pH 8.3, 2 mm EDTA, 4.4 mm ammonium persulfate, and 3.4 mm TEMED with electrophoresis carried out for 2 h at 400V with 50 mm Tris borate, pH 8.3, 1 mm EDTA, before application of samples (15μl), were used for analysis of poly(ADP-ribose) degradation (39Alvarez-Gonzalez R. Jacobson M.K. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 3218-3224Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Subsequent electrophoresis at 400 V was stopped when bromphenol blue had moved 9 cm from the origin. Gels were exposed to x-ray films (Kodak). HPLC Analysis—HPLC (with a Hewlett-Packard series 1100 high pressure liquid chromatograph equipped with a diode array spectrophotometric detector set at 254 nm) was used for separation of reaction products. For anion exchange perfusion chromatography, a Zorbax SAX column (4.6 × 250 mm; DuPont) was washed with 20 mm potassium phosphate, pH 4.5, for 30 min, followed by a linear gradient of 0–1 m NaCl in the same buffer for 10 min (30–40 min) and then the same buffer with 1 m NaCl for 10 min (40–50 min) at a flow rate of 1 ml/min.

https://openalex.org/W2069679667,"We show that localized expression of the integrin α3 protein is regulated at the level of RNA localization by the human homologue of Drosophila Muscleblind, MLP1/MBLL/MBNL2, a unique Cys3His zinc-finger protein. This is supported by the following observations: MLP1 knockdown abolishes localization of integrin α3 to the adhesion complexes; MLP1 is localized in adhesion plaques that contain phospho-focal adhesion kinase; this localization is microtubule-dependent; integrin α3 transcripts colocalize with MLP1 in distinct cytoplasmic loci; integrin α3 transcripts are physically associated with MLP1 in cells and MLP1 binds to a specific ACACCC motif in the integrin α3 3′ untranslated region (UTR) in vitro; and a green fluorescent protein (GFP) open reading frame–integrin α3 3′ UTR chimeric gene directs GFP protein localization to distinct cytoplasmic loci near the cell periphery, which is dependent on MLP1 and is mediated by the ACACCC motif but is independent of the integrin α3 signal peptide."

Because exendin-4 (Ex4), a long acting glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonist, has similar effects upon β cells in rodents and humans, we investigated whether Irs2 signaling was required for Ex4 action in isolated β cells and in Irs2-/- mice. Ex4 increased cAMP levels in human islets and Min6 cells, which promoted Irs2 expression and stimulated Akt phosphorylation. In wild type mice Ex4 administered continuously for 28 days increased β cell mass 2-fold. By contrast, Ex4 failed to arrest the progressive β cell loss in Irs2-/- mice, which culminated in fatal diabetes; however, Ex4 delayed the progression of diabetes by 3 weeks by promoting insulin secretion from the remaining islets. We conclude that some short term therapeutic effects of glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists can be independent of Irs2, but its long term effects upon β cell growth and survival are mediated by the Irs2 branch of the insulin/insulin-like growth factor signaling cascade.

Diabetes mellitus is a complex disorder that arises from various causes, including dysregulated glucose sensing and impaired insulin secretion (maturity-onset diabetes of youth, MODY), autoimmune-mediated β cell destruction (type 1), or insufficient compensation for peripheral insulin resistance (type 2) (1Stumvoll M. Goldstein B.J. van Haeften T.W. Lancet. 2005; 365: 1333-1346Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1796) Google Scholar). Type 2 diabetes is the most prevalent form. It usually occurs at middle age and afflicts more than 30 million people over the age of 65 but is appearing with greater frequency in children and adolescents (2Zimmet P. Alberti K.G. Shaw J. Nature. 2001; 414: 782-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (4594) Google Scholar). Dysregulated insulin signaling exacerbated by chronic hyperglycemia promotes a cohort of systemic disorders, including dyslipidemia, hypertension, cardiovascular disease, and female infertility (3Reaven G.

Diabetes Mellitus: A Fundamental and Clinical Text. 3rd Ed. Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Philadelphia2004: 99-113Google Scholar). Protein kinase A has immediate effects upon the KATP and Ca2+ channel activity to mobilize secretory vesicles into readily releasable pools required for rapid insulin secretion (8Doyle M.E. Egan J.M.

Moreover, protein kinase A activates the transcription factor cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB) in β cells, which stimulates the expression of various genes that play a direct role in glucose sensing (GLUT2 and glucokinase) and insulin secretion (PDX1 and insulin itself) (21Holz G.G.

However, the long term effects of stable GLP1R agonists upon β cell growth, function, and survival are more difficult to understand. Recent reports suggest that exendin-4 activates various protein kinases that promote cell growth and survival, including Akt, Jak, protein kinase C, cSrc, or the epidermal growth factor receptor (7Brubaker P.L.

Studies on the role of the insulin and insulin-like growth factor receptors in β cells reveal an essential role for the phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3-kinase → Akt cascade to promote nuclear exclusion of Foxo1 (24Kitamura T. Nakae J. Kitamura Y. Kido Y. Biggs III, W.H. Wright C.V. White M.F. Arden K.C. Accili D. J. Clin.

Endocrinology. 2004; 145: 2653-2659Crossref PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar). Irs2 is a substrate of the insulin and IGF1 receptor tyrosine kinases that is essential for compensatory β cell growth, function, and survival throughout life (25White M.F. Science. 2003; 302: 1710-1711Crossref PubMed Scopus (563) Google Scholar). Irs2 expression is strongly induced in β cells by Ex4 and other cAMP agonists through the activation of CREB (26Jhala U.S. Canettieri G. Screaton R.A. Kulkarni R.N. Krajewski S. Reed J. Walker J. Lin X. White M.F. Montminy M. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 1575-1580Crossref PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar, 27Hennige A.M. Burks D.J. Ozcan U. Kulkarni R.N. Ye J. Park S. Schubert M. Fisher T.L.

Irs2 binds to the SH2 domains of common signaling effectors, including enzymes (phosphoinositide 3-kinase, the phosphatase SHP2, or the tyrosine kinase Fyn) or adapters (GRB2, NCK, CRK, SHB, and others). The production of PI-3,4,5-trisphosphate by PI 3-kinase recruits the Ser/Thr kinases Pdk1 and Akt to the plasma membrane where Akt is activated by Pdk1-mediated phosphorylation (28Lawlor M.A. Alessi D.R. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 2903-2910Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Akt phosphorylates many proteins that play important physiological roles (28Lawlor M.A. Alessi D.R. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 2903-2910Crossref PubMed Google Scholar): glycogen synthase kinase 3β, the BAD·BCL2 heterodimer (apoptosis inhibition), TSC1·TSC2 (protein synthesis and nutrient sensing), and FOXO (transcriptional regulation). Moreover, Irs2 signaling can play a unique role in this cascade because of its ability to coordinate the degradation of Foxo1. 3S. Guo and M. F. White, unpublished results. Consequently, the IRS2 branch of the insulin/insulin-like growth factor signaling pathway strongly promotes β cell growth and survival, which is essential for compensatory β cell function during physiological or metabolic stress (29Lin X.

In this report we show that the long term effects of exendin-4 upon β cell survival and replication do not develop in Irs2-/- mice. We conclude that these long term effects are mediated at least in part through increased expression of Irs2. Antibodies—Primary antibodies used were as follows: rabbit anti-glucagon and guinea pig anti-insulin (Zymed Laboratories Inc., San Francisco, CA); rabbit polyclonal antibodies against Akt and phosphorylated Akt (pAktSer-473), Erk1 and Erk2 and phosphorylated Erk (pErk) was purchased from Cell Signaling Technology, Inc., Beverly, MA; rabbit anti-Irs2 and rabbit pan anti-p85 (Upstate USA, Chicago, IL); mouse anti-BrdUrd (Roche Applied Science); goat anti-PDX-1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA). The rabbit anti-Irs-1 was prepared in our laboratory against a glutathione S-transferase fusion protein of rat Irs-1 amino acids 735-900 as previously described (32Backer J.M. Myers Jr., M.G. Shoelson S.E. Chin D.J. Sun X.J. Miralpeix M. Hu P. Margolis B. Skolnik E.Y. Schlessinger J. White M.F. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3469-3479Crossref PubMed Scopus (822) Google Scholar). Secondary antibodies used were as follows: rhodamine-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG and fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-guinea pig IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc., West Grove, PA); horse-radish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG and HRP-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Mice—Wild type (WT) and Irs2-/- mice on a C57BL/6 background were genotyped by PCR as previously described (31Withers D.J. Gutierrez J.S. Towery H. Burks D.J. Ren J.M. Previs S. Zhang Y. Bernal D. Pons S. Shulman G.I. Bonner-Weir S. White M.F. Nature. 1998; 391: 900-904Crossref PubMed Scopus (1347) Google Scholar). Mice were fed ad libitum with a standard diet (Purina diet 5058, with 9% fat) and kept under a 12-h light/dark cycle. Blood samples were collected via mouse tail bleeds, and circulating glucose levels were determined using a glucometer (Glucometer Elite from Bayer, Pittsburgh, PA). Serum insulin levels were determined from tail bleed samples using an insulin enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit (Crystal Chemical Inc., Downers Grove, IL). Random-fed glucose and insulin measurements were performed in the morning as previously described (31Withers D.J. Gutierrez J.S. Towery H. Burks D.J. Ren J.M. Previs S. Zhang Y. Bernal D. Pons S. Shulman G.I. Bonner-Weir S. White M.F. Nature. 1998; 391: 900-904Crossref PubMed Scopus (1347) Google Scholar). Intraperitoneal glucose tolerance tests (IPGTT) were conducted with male Irs2-/- mice at 6-7 weeks of age and male WT mice at 8-10 weeks of age. For the IPGTT, all mice were fasted overnight for 15-16 h before an intraperitoneal injection of 2 g of d-glucose per kg of body weight as previously described (33Kushner J.A. Ye J. Schubert M. Burks D.J. Dow M.A. Flint C.L. Dutta S. Wright C.V. Montminy M.R. White M.F. J. Clin. Investig. 2002; 109: 1193-1201Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). For insulin tolerance tests (ITT), male WT mice 8-10 weeks of age and male Irs2-/- mice at 6-10 weeks of age were used. All mice were fasted for 6 h before an intraperitoneal injection of 1 unit of human insulin per kg of body weight as previously described (27Hennige A.M. Burks D.J. Ozcan U. Kulkarni R.N. Ye J. Park S. Schubert M. Fisher T.L. Dow M.A. Leshan R. Zakaria M. Mossa-Basha M. White M.F. J. Clin. Investig. 2003; 112: 1521-1532Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). For both the IPGTT and ITT, glucose was measured in tail blood samples at time intervals indicated in the figure legends. Drug Treatment—All Ex4 (Sigma) treatments were initiated in mice at 4 weeks of age when WT and Irs2-/- animals displayed equivalent normal glucose homeostasis and sustained functional pancreatic β cell mass. Litter-matched WT and Irs2-/- mice were randomly divided into control (saline-treated) or experimental (Ex4-treated) groups. Ex4 was administered with an osmotic pump (300 pmol/kg of body weight/day) until the mice died or the experiment was terminated when the animals were 12 weeks of age. Osmotic pumps were changed as required to maintain the desired drug dosage. Some experiments were conducted with Ex4 administration via intraperitoneal injection (150 pmol/kg of body weight) every 12 h to confirm the results generated using the osmotic pump. Immunohistochemistry of the Pancreas and Quantitation of β Cell Mass—The pancreas samples were prepared and analyzed as previously described (27Hennige A.M. Burks D.J. Ozcan U. Kulkarni R.N. Ye J. Park S. Schubert M. Fisher T.L. Dow M.A. Leshan R. Zakaria M. Mossa-Basha M. White M.F. J. Clin. Investig. 2003; 112: 1521-1532Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). The pancreas was dissected and fixed in Bouin's solution overnight. Serial 5-μm paraffin-embedded tissue sections were mounted on slides. After rehydration, sections were co-immunostained overnight at 4 °C for the presence of glucagon-positive α-cells (rabbit anti-glucagon, 1:100 in phosphate-buffered saline and 1% Triton-X (PBST)) and insulin-positive β cells (guinea pig anti-insulin, 1:100 in PBST). Detection was performed using rhodamine- and fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled secondary antibodies (1:100 in PBST) for 1 h at room temperature. The β cell area was measured by acquiring images from two sets of 8-10 distal, random non-overlapping images (10× magnification) of insulin- and glucagon-stained pancreatic sections. Seven male mice were analyzed from each genotype and treatment group. Results of the β cell quantification are expressed as the percentage of the total surveyed area containing insulin-positive cells. Ratios of β to α cells were calculated from the mean total insulin-positive (β cell) area divided by the mean total glucagon-positive (α cell) area. Islet proliferation and β cell size were examined by intraperitoneally injecting male WT and Irs2-/- mice 5-6 weeks of age with 5-bromo-2-deoxyuridine (BrdUrd; 100 μg/g of body weight in saline; Roche Applied Science) and then co-immunostaining for insulin and BrdUrd. Six hours post-BrdUrd injection, the pancreas was perfused with a 4% paraformaldehyde (pH 7.2) solution in saline. The pancreas was removed, fixed in a 4% paraformaldehyde (pH 7.2) saline solution overnight at room temperature, and embedded in paraffin blocks, and 5-μm longitudinal sections were subsequently immunostained to determine the level of BrdUrd incorporation as previously described (33Kushner J.A. Ye J. Schubert M. Burks D.J. Dow M.A. Flint C.L. Dutta S. Wright C.V. Montminy M.R. White M.F. J. Clin. Investig. 2002; 109: 1193-1201Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). BrdUrd-positive β cell ratios were calculated as BrdUrd-positive β cells over total β cell nuclei per section, two sections per animal, seven animals per genotype. Hyperglycemic Clamp—Mice were anesthetized with intraperitoneal injections of ketamine and xylazine (100 mg- and 10 mg/kg of body weight). A cannula was surgically implanted into the left jugular vein, externalized in the interscapulum, and sealed as previously described (34Previs S.F. Withers D.J. Ren J.M. White M.F. Shulman G.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38990-38994Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). After a recovery period of 5-6 days, the hyperglycemic clamp procedure was performed with conscious and overnight fasted mice as previously described (34Previs S.F. Withers D.J. Ren J.M. White M.F. Shulman G.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38990-38994Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). The fasted blood glucose level was determined as described above before the beginning of the clamp procedure. Bolus glucose (375 mg of glucose/kg of body weight) was infused through the cannula for 5 min at the beginning of the clamp procedure, and 20% glucose was administered through the cannula to maintain blood glucose levels at 5.5 mm above the determined fasted blood glucose level. Glucose and insulin levels were determined in blood samples collected via tail bleeds at 0-, 5-, 10-, 40-, 50-, and 60-min post-glucose bolus glucose infusion. Pancreas Perfusion—Mice treated with saline or Ex4 for at least 4-6 weeks were fasted for 15 h and anesthetized with 35 mg/kg of body weight sodium pentobarbital (Nembutal, Abbott Laboratories, North Chicago, IL) administered via intraperitoneal injection. The abdominal aorta and portal vein were cannulated with PE-10 and PE-50 tubing, respectively, for perfusion and sample collection. The perfusate was composed of Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate buffer containing 3% dextran (Amersham Biosciences), 1% free fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin (Sigma) and equilibrated to a pH of 7.4 with 95% O2,5%CO2. Five mm glucose in perfusate buffer was infused for 20 min to stabilize the pancreas in the condition of in situ perfusion. The pancreas was sequentially perfused at 1 ml/min with buffer containing 5 mm glucose (10 min), 16.7 mm glucose (20 min), 5 mm glucose (15 min), 30 mm glucose (20 min), 5 mm glucose (15 min), and 30 mm glucose with 20 mm arginine (20 min). The perfusion eluate was collected every minute, and the insulin content in each fraction was measured using a radioimmunoassay technique performed by the Joslin Diabetes Center Assay Core. At the end of the experiment the pancreas was excised and homogenized, and the insulin was extracted overnight in acid-ethanol at -20 °C. The following day the samples were centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C, and supernatant was stored at -20 °C. The pellet was sonicated, and insulin was extracted a second time overnight in acid-ethanol at -20 °C. After centrifugation the following day, the extracts were pooled, and the insulin concentration was measured using a radioimmunoassay performed by the Joslin Diabetes Center Assay Core. Pancreatic Islet Isolation—Pancreatic islets were isolated by collagenase digestion of whole pancreas excised from male WT and Irs2-/- mice 5-6 weeks of age as previously described (27Hennige A.M. Burks D.J. Ozcan U. Kulkarni R.N. Ye J. Park S. Schubert M. Fisher T.L. Dow M.A. Leshan R. Zakaria M. Mossa-Basha M. White M.F. J. Clin. Investig. 2003; 112: 1521-1532Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). Digested pancreatic tissue from 6 mice per genotype was pooled for analysis. Human islet isolations were performed in the Islet Core Laboratory of the Juvenile Diabetes Foundation Center for Islet Transplantation at Harvard Medical School using the method of Ricordi and co-workers (35Linetsky E. Bottino R. Lehmann R. Alejandro R. Inverardi L. Ricordi C. Diabetes. 1997; 46: 1120-1123Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The human islets were incubated for 48 h in culture medium to allow recovery and to eliminate acinar cells. Following the experimental manipulations indicated in the figure legends, islets were harvested and lysed for analysis in ice-cold radioimmune precipitation assay lysis buffer composed of PBS, 20 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 2 mm EDTA, 137 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, 12 mm α-glycerol phosphate, and 10 μg/ml aprotinin. After 30 min on ice, lysates were centrifuged at 12,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C. The protein content was determined using the dye-binding Bradford-based assay (Bio-Rad). Immunoprecipitation and Immunoblotting—Cell or tissue lysates with equal amounts of protein were directly resolved by SDS-PAGE or immunoprecipitated with specific antibodies as indicated before SDS-PAGE. Samples were then transferred to nitrocellulose for immunoblotting. The indicated proteins were detected by immunoblotting with specific antibodies against Irs1 or Irs2, Akt or pAktSer-473, Erk1, Erk2 or pErk, or Pdx-1, as previously described (27Hennige A.M. Burks D.J. Ozcan U. Kulkarni R.N. Ye J. Park S. Schubert M. Fisher T.L. Dow M.A. Leshan R. Zakaria M. Mossa-Basha M. White M.F. J. Clin. Investig. 2003; 112: 1521-1532Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). In several cases the primary phosphospecific antibody was washed away for 1 h in 60 mm Tris-base (pH 9.0) containing 1% SDS and 8 ml/liter β-mercaptoethanol followed by a 1-h wash in PBS containing 0.1% Tween 20. The stripped gel was immunoblotted with a nonphospho-specific antibody for normalization. Quantitative Reverse Transcription-PCR—Total RNA was isolated from saline- or Ex4-treated human islets with Trizol (Invitrogen). The cDNA synthesis was performed with the RETROscript kit (Ambion Inc., Austin, Texas) using random decamers. The quantitative reverse transcription-PCR was carried out using the QuantiTect SYBR green PCR kit (Qiagen Inc., Valencia, California) on an iCycler PCR instrument (Bio-Rad). The PCR reactions were performed following the kit instructions. The following primers were used to detect human IRS2, cyclophilin, PDX-1 glucokinase, and GLUT2: IRS2 forward, 5′-AGAGTGCACCCGTACCTATGGA-3′; IRS2 reverse, 5′-CTTTACCTTGAACTGAGGTAGGACTGT-3′; cyclophilin forward, 5′-GCGTCTCCTTTGAGCTGTTTGCA-3′; cyclophilin reverse, 5′-CCACCCTGACACATAAACCCTGGAA-3′; PDX-1 forward, 5′-CTGCGGAGCCGGAGGAGAA-3′; PDX-1 reverse, 5′-GGCGCGGCCTGTAGATGTA-3′; glucokinase forward, 5′-CCTGAGGCTGGAGACCCATGA-3′; glucokinase reverse, 5′-TGGGGTGGAGCGCACGTA-3′; GLUT2 forward, 5′-ATGTTTTGGGTGTTCCACTGGATGA-3′; GLUT2 reverse, 5′-GGGGTTGGTTTTGGGTTCATTGA-3′. The relative quantification analysis was performed by calculating the PCR product ratio that was determined by the level of the gene of interest divided by the level of cyclophilin, the internal control. These experiments were repeated in three separate sets of human islets, and the results were expressed as mean ± S.E. Irs2 Disruption in Min6 Cells—Min6 cells were grown in high glucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 15% (v/v) heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 50 μm β-mercaptoethanol, penicillin (100 units/ml), and streptomycin (0.1 mg/ml). The cells were maintained at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO2 and used between passages 19 and 30. Min6 cells at 70% confluence were transiently transfected with 3 μg of siRNA against Irs2 (siRNAIrs2, 5′-AAUAGCUGCAAGAGCGAUGAC-3′) for each well of a 12-well plate or control-scrambled siRNA using the Gene porter system (Gene Therapy System, San Diego, CA). Twenty-four hours post-transfection, the Min6 cells were washed with PBS and treated with vehicle (Me2SO), 2.5 nm Ex4, or 1mm dibutyryl-cAMP (Bt2cAMP) in serum-free media for 8 h. In each treatment, cAMP levels were quantified with the cAMP-Screen Direct enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay system (Applied Biosystems, Bedford, MA). Cells were lysed with radioimmune precipitation assay buffer, and their protein contents were determined as described above. Lysate samples with equivalent protein levels were directly resolved or immunoprecipitated with specific antibodies before resolution via SDS-PAGE. After transfer to nitrocellulose, immunoblotting with specific antibodies against Irs1, Irs2, Akt, or pAktSer-473 was performed as previously described (24Kitamura T. Nakae J. Kitamura Y. Kido Y.

Nature. 1994; 371: 606-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (1574) Google Scholar). The intensity of protein expression was determined using ImageQuant TL (Amersham Biosciences). These experiments were performed at least three times. Statistical Analysis—Results are expressed as the means ± S.E. Mean data values from saline control and Ex4 treatments were compared between each mouse genotype and treatment group using unpaired Student's t tests when appropriate. p values less than 0.05 were considered significant. Ex4 Increases Irs2 Levels in Isolated Human Islets—Previous experiments demonstrated that activation of cAMP → CREB signaling for 4-10 h with Ex4 increased the expression of Irs2 in Min6 cells and murine pancreatic β cells (26Jhala U.S. Canettieri G. Screaton R.A. Kulkarni R.N. Krajewski S. Reed J. Walker J. Lin X. White M.F. Montminy M. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 1575-1580Crossref PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar, 27Hennige A.M. Burks D.J. Ozcan U.

This is consistent with the presence of several half-cre elements in the 5′-untranslated region of the murine Irs2 gene where CREB binds during cAMP-stimulated phosphorylation (26Jhala U.S. Canettieri G.

https://openalex.org/W2128151020,"Histone deacetylase (HDAC)-6 was recently identified as a dual substrate, possibly multisubstrate, deacetylase that can act both on acetylated histone tails and on α-tubulin acetylated on Lys40. HDAC-6 is unique among deacetylases in having two hdac domains, and we have used this enzyme as a useful model to dissect the structural requirements for the deacetylation reaction. In this report, we show that both hdac domains are required for the intact deacetylase activity of HDAC-6 in vitro and in vivo. The spatial arrangement of these two domains in HDAC-6 is essential and alteration of the linker region between the two domains severely affects the catalytic activity. Artificial chimeric HDACs, made by replacing the hdac domains in HDAC-6 with corresponding domains from other class II HDACs, show de novo deacetylase activity. Taken together, our results demonstrate for the first time that the spatial arrangement of hdac domains is critical for in vivo deacetylation reaction and may provide a useful model for the development of novel HDAC inhibitors.

Protein acetylation, especially histone acetylation, is one of the most important posttranslational modifications. It is involved in the regulation of protein structure and functions and therefore has potentially important roles in most of cellular processes. In particular, the impact of histone N-terminal acetylation on chromatin organization and gene expression has been well documented. Acetylation and deacetylation of histone tails or of other proteins are catalyzed by histone acetyltransferases (HATs) 2The abbreviations used are: HAT, histone acetyltransferase; HDAC, histone deacetylase; GFP, green fluorescent protein; EGFP, enhanced GFP; HA, hemagglutinin; TDAC, tubulin deacetylase. 2The abbreviations used are: HAT, histone acetyltransferase; HDAC, histone deacetylase; GFP, green fluorescent protein; EGFP, enhanced GFP; HA, hemagglutinin; TDAC, tubulin deacetylase. and histone deacetylases (HDACs), respectively. In mammals, there are more than 18 HDACs that can be grouped into Class I, Class II, and Class III HDACs (1Thiagalingam S. Cheng K.H. Lee H.J. Mineva N. Thiagalingam A. Ponte J.F. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 2003; 983: 84-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar, 2De Ruijter A.J. van Gennip A.H. Caron H.N. Kemp S. van Kuilenburg A.B. Biochem.

In cells most, if not all, HDACs are part of large molecular weight complexes that typically contain several HDAC polypeptides and are recruited to DNA via their interactions with sequence-specific or nonspecific DNA binding proteins. Among the HDACs, HDAC-6 was recently identified as a dual substrate, and possibly multisubstrate, deacetylase that can deacetylate both histone tails and also α-tubulin Lys40 in vitro and in vivo (3Hubbert C. Guardiola A. Shao R. Kawaguchi Y. Ito A. Nixon A. Yoshida M. Wang X.F. Yao T.P. Nature. 2002; 417: 455-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (1759) Google Scholar, 4Matsuyama A. Shimazu T. Sumida Y. Saito A.

Matthias G. Hess D. Khochbin S. Matthias P. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 1168-1179Crossref PubMed Scopus (568) Google Scholar). Interestingly, HDAC-6 is not known to be part of an obligatory higher molecular weight complex and has a unique structure with two intact hdac catalytic domains. HDAC-6 thus mimics in one molecule the presence of more than one hdac domain, as it is observed in other HDAC-containing protein complexes. In this report, using various in vitro and in vivo assays we demonstrate that both hdac domains of HDAC-6 are essential for activity of this enzyme and propose that the presence of more than one hdac domain is a general requirement for the deacetylation reaction. Plasmids and Mutagenesis—Mutations and deletions were generated by QuikChange kit (Strategene). For EGFP insertions, part of the EGPF was PCR-amplified from pEGFP (Clontech) and subsequently cloned into the XbaI site in the linker region of HDAC-6 cDNA. To clone the chimeric HDAC, the hdac domains from either HDAC-4 or -5 were PCR-amplified and used to replace the first or second hdac domain in HDAC-6. 3T3 Cells and Rescue by HDAC-6 Wild Type and Mutants—Mouse embryo fibroblasts were isolated from E13.5 mouse embryos and subsequently 3T3 cell lines were established following a standard protocol. 3T3 cells were infected with pMSCV-EGFP plasmids containing wild type or mutant mouse HDAC-6 cDNAs. Individual clones were expanded and checked for HDAC-6 expression by Western blot. Co-immunoprecipitation and HDAC/Tubulin Deacetylase (TDAC) Assays—500 μg of extracts from HEK 293T cells transfected by FuGENE (Roche Applied Science) were immunoprecipitated with the primary antibody or mouse IgG. HDAC/TDAC assays were performed as described (5Zhang Y. Li N. Caron C. Matthias G. Hess D. Khochbin S. Matthias P. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 1168-1179Crossref PubMed Scopus (568) Google Scholar). Purification of Recombinant Mouse HDAC6s—A His6 tag was added to the C-terminal end of mouse HDAC-6 cDNA in pDEST8 vector by PCR. Bacmids for insect cell transformation were generated using the Bac-To-Bac Baculovirus Expression System (Invitrogen). The recombinant enzymes were purified with a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid Superflow (Qiagen) and HiTrap Q FF columns (Amersham Biosciences). Immunofluoresence and Immunoblotting—Cells were fixed and stained with anti-HA polyclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and TU6–11 for acetylated tubulin (Sigma). The antibodies used were: TU6–11, DM1A, FLAG M2 (Sigma), anti-HA (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), Glu-tubulin and Tyr-tubulin (Synaptic Systems), and mHDAC-6 (6Verdel A. Curtet S. Brocard M.P. Rousseaux S. Lemercier C. Yoshida M. Khochbin S. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 747-749Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Two hdac Domains Are Required for Deacetylation by HDAC-6—To investigate whether the two hdac domains in HDAC-6 might have different roles in the deacetylation reaction, we prepared several mutant constructs, with mutations in the catalytic cores or in the presumed substrate recognition regions (so-called ER motif; Ref. 7Adachi N. Kimura A. Horikoshi M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 35688-35695Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1A). The different proteins were prepared from transiently transfected 293T cells by immunoprecipitation with an anti-HA antibody and were used for in vitro activity assays with chemically acetylated histone H4 or α-tubulin peptides (5Zhang Y. Li N. Caron C. Matthias G. Hess D. Khochbin S. Matthias P. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 1168-1179Crossref PubMed Scopus (568) Google Scholar). The expression levels of each mutant in transiently transfected cells were similar as demonstrated by Western blot analysis (Fig. 1B, upper panel). As shown in Fig. 1B, lower panel, point mutations in the catalytic core of both hdac domains (HD1/2m) completely abolished the HDAC and the TDAC activities of HDAC-6. Surprisingly, mutating either of the hdac catalytic cores (HD1m or HD2m) also destroyed the whole activity on both substrates. This suggests that the cooperation between the two hdac catalytic cores is critical for the deacetylation reaction mediated by HDAC-6. Interestingly, the mutations in the presumed substrate recognition region (7Adachi N. Kimura A. Horikoshi M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 35688-35695Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) led to somewhat different effects on enzymatic activities. The mutation in the second substrate recognition site (L798A) completely inactivated the catalytic activity on both peptides, whereas the mutation of the corresponding region in the first hdac domain (L402A) retained partial activity. Interestingly, the latter mutation had a stronger effect on TDAC activity than on HDAC activity. This result suggests that in the deacetylation reaction the two different peptide substrates might interact differently with the N-terminal catalytic domain of HDAC-6. To rule out the possible interference of co-immunoprecipated proteins with HDAC-6, we purified recombinant wild type or mutant HDAC-6 from a baculovirus expression system. After nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid and QFF columns, His6-tagged HDAC-6 proteins could be purified as single protein and equal amount of wild type and mutant proteins were used for activity assays (Fig. 1C, left panel). As shown in Fig. 1C, right panel, the HDAC and TDAC activity of HDAC-6 is intrinsic and requires both intact catalytic cores. To confirm these in vitro results, tubulin deacetylation was also tested in vivo. For this, HDAC-6 wild type and mutant constructs were transfected into NIH3T3 cells, and the cells were subsequently immunostained for acetylated tubulin and expression of the HA epitope, which marks transfected cells. As shown in Fig. 2A, the results of these experiments agree well with the above in vitro assays; endogenous tubulin acetylation was dramatically reduced by overexpression of wild type HDAC-6 but not by the different HDAC-6 catalytic core mutants. To rule out any possible effect from endogenous HDAC-6 on these assays, we also made use of HDAC-6-deficient 3T3 cell lines. 3Y. Zhang, unpublished data. In the complete absence of HDAC-6, 3T3 cells showed dramatically increased tubulin acetylation (lane 4 versus lane 1 in Fig. 2B, upper panel), in agreement with the notion that tubulin is the physiological substrate of HDAC-6. Stable re-introduction of HDAC-6 into the knock-out cells at an expression level comparable with the wild type efficiently reduced tubulin acetylation (Fig. 2B, lane 6). Clones expressing lower levels of HDAC-6 also showed a decrease in tubulin acetylation, albeit less pronounced (lane 5 in Fig. 2B). Interestingly, whereas the tubulin acetylation increased dramatically in the absence of HDAC-6, other tubulin modifications, such as tyrosinated (Tyr) or detyrosinated (Glu) tubulin did not change. Next, we measured the capacity of HDAC-6 mutants to deacetylate tubulin in vivo by stably re-introducing them into HDAC-6-deficient cells. Specifically, we tested HDAC-6 constructs with mutations in the first or in the second hdac catalytic core. Because it was difficult to obtain high expression of these mutants, we used as a control for these experiments a cell clone expressing wild type HDAC-6 at an intermediate level which was similar to that of the mutant proteins (lanes 2–4, Fig. 2B, lower panel). Examination of the degree of tubulin acetylation in the different cell lines (lanes 2–4) revealed that in the two cell lines expressing mutant HDAC-6 tubulin acetylation was not reduced compared with control-transfected cells expressing GFP (lane 1). This result indicates that these two HDAC-6 mutants are inactive when tested in cells lacking endogenous HDAC-6. The Spatial Arrangement of the hdac Domains in HDAC-6 Is Important for the Selective Activities on Different Substrates—To examine whether the spatial arrangement of the two catalytic domains is important for the activity of HDAC-6, we prepared a series of constructs in which the distance between the two domains was modulated by insertions or deletions. Fragments derived from the EGFP protein, ranging from 5 amino acids to full-length of EGFP (239 amino acids), were inserted between the two hdac domains (Fig. 3A). To shorten the distance between the two hdac domains, the linker region was deleted by 5, 25, or 68 amino acids, respectively. As shown in Fig. 3B, all constructs were equally expressed in transiently transfected 293T cells and subsequently used for immunoprecipitation and activity assays. Surprisingly, even slight modulation of the linker length, by addition or removal of only 5 amino acids, dramatically affected the catalytic activity (Fig. 3C). Generally, both HDAC and TDAC activities decreased along with increasing length of the insertions (Fig. 3C). The most dramatic loss of activity was observed when the entire linker region was deleted (Δ411–478). Interestingly, the impairment of the activity clearly showed substrate preference and TDAC activity was found to be more sensitive to spatial changes than HDAC activity. Generation of Active Artificial Chimeric HDACs from Inactive HDAC Fragments—Finally, we tested whether artificial HDACs, made from combinations of different class II HDACs, might be selectively active. To create chimeric HDACs, we replaced the first or the second hdac domain of HDAC-6 by the hdac domains from either HDAC-4 or HDAC-5 (Fig. 4A). Since the distance between two hdac domains is important for activity (Fig. 3), in the chimeric HDACs we used the linker region from HDAC-6 to keep the distance between two catalytic cores as it is in the wild type HDAC-6 protein. After transfection into 293T cells, the extracts were subsequently used for immunoprecipitation and activity assays. The specific activities were normalized to the protein expression levels determined by Western blot. As shown in Fig. 4B, replacement of the second hdac domain of HDAC-6 by domains from either HDAC-4 or HDAC-5 resulted in a chimeric protein with almost no activity on either tubulin or histone substrates. On their own, full-length HDAC-4 and -5 show no deacetylase activity (Refs. 5Zhang Y. Li N. Caron C. Matthias G. Hess D. Khochbin S. Matthias P. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 1168-1179Crossref PubMed Scopus (568) Google Scholar and 12Fischle W. Dequiedt F. Hendzel M.J. Guenther M.G. Lazar M.A. Voelter W. Verdin E. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 45-57Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (620) Google Scholar and results not shown). On the other hand, chimeric proteins with the first hdac domain derived from either HDAC-4 or HDAC-5 and the second domain from HDAC-6 showed activity on both histone and tubulin substrates. Here again activity was greater on the histone peptide than on the tubulin substrate, which might be due to selective recognition and/or enzymatic activity of HDAC-4 or -5 on the histone but not on the tubulin peptide. These experiments showed that artificial combination of the hdac domains from HDAC-4 or -5 and the second HDAC-6 domain, either of which are inactive by themselves, led to de novo activity. HDAC-6 contains two intact hdac catalytic domains which might mimic native HDAC-containing complexes. Since the two hdac domains in HDAC-6 are well conserved, the first question was whether they are both important and/or functionally different. Here we demonstrate that mutating a single hdac core is sufficient to inactivate HDAC-6 on both histone and tubulin substrates, both in vitro or in vivo. In addition, changing the spatial arrangement between these two domains by insertions or deletions has a significant impact on the activity. This confirms that both hdac domains are necessary for the activity and also suggests that their precise arrangement relative to another is important. We have shown previously that each hdac domain in HDAC-6 is sufficient to bind on its own β-tubulin, and this interaction is maintained even when the catalytic core is mutated (5Zhang Y. Li N. Caron C. Matthias G. Hess D. Khochbin S. Matthias P. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 1168-1179Crossref PubMed Scopus (568) Google Scholar). Within the hdac domain, in addition to the conserved catalytic core, a region of homology between HATs (such as Esa1) and HDACs (such as Rpd3) has been identified. This motif, termed ER (Esa1-Rpd3) motif (7Adachi N. Kimura A. Horikoshi M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 35688-35695Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), is located near the active center in the tertiary structure of Esa1. Recent structure analysis of the tGCN5/CoA/H3 complex (9Clements A. Poux A.N. Lo W.S. Pillus L. Berger S.L. Marmorstein R. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 461-473Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) showed that this motif might be involved in the interaction and recognition with histone tails. Mutation analysis revealed that the ER motif regions of Esa1 or Rpd3 are required for HAT activity of Esa1 and HDAC activity of Rpd3, respectively (7Adachi N. Kimura A. Horikoshi M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 35688-35695Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). By mutating these putative substrate recognition motifs in HDAC-6, we find that the second ER motif might be more important for interaction with the substrate(s). This is the first evidence to show a functional difference between the two hdac domains in HDAC-6. The results obtained with chimeric HDACs further support this hypothesis (Fig. 4). Moreover, we observed that the mutation in the first ER motif had different effects on deacetylation of the tubulin or histone peptide: TDAC activity is more sensitive to this mutation than HDAC activity. This suggests that the two hdac domains selectively interact with and recognize different substrates. Interestingly, modulation of the distance between the two hdac domains in HDAC-6 also has a stronger effect on tubulin peptide deacetylation than on histone peptide deacetylation. We think that this might be also partially due to selective substrate recognition. While the tubulin substrate only has one acetylated lysine (Lys40), histone tails usually have several acetylated lysine residues. In vitro experiments have demonstrated that class I and II HDACs could deacetylate all acetylated lysines on core histone substrates, albeit with slightly different efficiencies (2De Ruijter A.J. van Gennip A.H. Caron H.N. Kemp S. van Kuilenburg A.B. Biochem. J. 2003; 370: 737-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (2432) Google Scholar). This suggests that there might be a dynamic sliding between HDACs and histone tails to allow deacetylation of all residues. Because of this the recognition of the histone substrates might be inherently more flexible than that of tubulin. In the deletion and insertion constructs of HDAC-6, the fact that the effect was weaker on histone than on tubulin substrates also suggests that tubulin deacetylation needs a more tightly controlled conformation of HDAC-6. It is generally assumed that most of the in vivo deacetylase activity for histones, and possibly other proteins, is found in HDAC-containing multiprotein complexes. Interestingly, in all known HDAC-containing complexes, there are normally two HDACs (10Grozinger C.M. Schreiber S.L. Chem. Biol. 2002; 9: 3-16Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar). For example, HDAC-1 is commonly found to work together with HDAC-2. Moreover, HDAC-1 itself can homo-oligomerize through its N-terminal domain; the same domain is necessary for interaction in vitro with HDAC-2 or -3 and also for catalytic activity (11Taplick J. Kurtev V. Kroboth K. Posch M. Lechner T. Seiser C. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 308: 27-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). This raises the question whether the in vivo deacetylation reactions also need two HDAC molecules together. Previous results demonstrated that class II HDACs regulate transcription by bridging the enzymatically active SMRT/N-CoR-HDAC-3 complex and select transcription factors, independently of any intrinsic class II HDAC activity (12Fischle W. Dequiedt F. Hendzel M.J. Guenther M.G. Lazar M.A. Voelter W. Verdin E. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 45-57Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (620) Google Scholar). While HDAC-4 and other class II HDACs are inactive in the context of the SMRT/N-CoR-HDAC-3 complex, binding between the catalytic domain of HDAC-4 and HDAC-3 via N-CoR/SMRT is crucial for the activity of the complex. In vivo analysis of HDAC-1 function in Drosophila found that flies have different phenotypes when they are either completely deficient for HDAC-1 or only have a single point mutation, which may toxify HDAC-containing complexes (13Mottus R. Sobel R.E. Grigliatti T.A. Genetics. 2000; 154: 657-668Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This evidence also indirectly suggested that the mutation in one of the hdac domains in the HDAC-containing complexes could inactivate the whole complex. So far, HDAC-6 is the only HDAC that has been shown to have catalytic activity independently from other HDACs or dimerization. Our results showed that the catalytic activity of HDAC-6 is dependent on both intact hdac domains. Moreover, artificially tethering parts of HDAC-6 and HDAC-4 or -5 were found to result in de novo catalytic activity; this mimics the result from N-CoR/SMRT complex, where HDAC-4 is made active by being tethered to HDAC-3. Based on these observations, we propose a possible general model for the deacetylation reaction, in which two hdac domains are required. As in the case for HDAC-6, HDAC-containing complexes might have a specific spatial arrangement of hdac domains, originating from two different HDAC molecules. These two hdac domains cooperate to confer the catalytic activity of the whole complex. The components of the different complexes determine the spatial arrangement of the two core hdac domains and therefore the specific activity of the complexes on different potential substrates. Solving the crystal structure of native whole HDAC-containing complexes should help to verify this hypothesis.

To investigate how this enhancement occurs, C105Y was fluorescently labeled to study its uptake and intracellular trafficking. When human hepatoma cells (HuH7) were incubated with fluorescently labeled C105Y for as little as 3 min, C105Y displayed nuclear and cytoplasmic staining with enrichment of fluorescent signal in the nucleus and nucleolus. Uptake and nucleolar localization were observed with the short sequence PFVYLI, but not with SIPPEVKFNK, and the D-isomer was readily taken up into cells but not into the nucleus. We found that the C105Y peptide is routed to the nucleolus very rapidly in an energy-dependent fashion, whereas membrane translocation and nuclear localization are energy-independent. When we tested the involvement of known endocytosis pathways in uptake and trafficking of this peptide, we demonstrated that C105Y peptide is internalized by a clathrin- and caveolin-independent pathway, although lipid raft-mediated endocytosis may play a role in peptide intracellular trafficking.

These peptides can be categorized into three subgroups according to their origin (1Temsamani J. Vidal P. Drug. Discov. Today. 2004; 9: 1012-1019Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 2Joliot A. Prochiantz A. Nat. Cell Biol. 2004; 6: 189-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar, 3Jarver P. Langel U. Drug. Discov. Today. 2004; 9: 395-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). The first group is composed of CPPs derived from natural proteins, such as the human immunodeficiency virus, type 1 transactivator of transcription (TAT) and Antennapedia (Antp) proteins that were able to rapidly translocate across the cell membrane when added to cells in culture (4Vives E. Brodin P. Lebleu B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16010-16017Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2071) Google Scholar, 5Derossi D. Joliot A.H. Chassaing G. Prochiantz A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10444-10450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Specific amino acid sequences were identified within these proteins that appeared to mediate their cellular uptake. When these peptides were slightly modified from their naturally occurring sequences, they gave rise to the second class of CPPs. These CPPs include transportan, a synthetic peptide adapted from the neuropeptide galanin (6Soomets U. Lindgren M. Gallet X. Hallbrink M. Elmquist A. Balaspiri L. Zorko M. Pooga M. Brasseur R. Langel U. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1467: 165-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar), and SynB, a peptide derived from the antimicrobial protein protegrin (7Drin G. Temsamani J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1559: 160-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). By screening random phage display libraries for their ability to induce translocation, a third class of CPPs has been identified, which needs further characterization (2Joliot A. Prochiantz A. Nat. Cell Biol. 2004; 6: 189-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar). Although CPPs are derived from a variety of sources, they have some common features. Some peptides are α-helical in structure, and some contain arginine or lysine rich motifs, whereas others have a hydrophobic core sequence. It appears that these motifs are important in mediating the translocation of CPPs across cell membranes. For example, the hydrophilic arginine residues within TAT appear to mediate its cell penetrating properties, whereas the hydrophobic core of penetratin is necessary to mediate its entry into cells (2Joliot A. Prochiantz A. Nat. Cell Biol. 2004; 6: 189-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar, 8Prochiantz A. Adv. Drug. Deliv.

Proteins, peptides, and small molecules can enter cells through a variety of mechanisms. For example, small molecules such as amino acids, sugars, and ions can traverse the plasma membrane through pumps or channels. Macromolecules, however, must be transported into the cell by endocytosis. Endocytosis occurs by multiple mechanisms that fall into two distinct categories. Phagocytosis involves the uptake of large particles and is usually restricted to specialized mammalian cells, such as macrophages and neutrophiles. Pinocytosis occurs in all cell types and involves the uptake of fluids and solutes. Pinocytosis is mediated by four identified mechanisms: macropinocytosis, clathrin-mediated endocytosis, caveolae-mediated endocytosis, and clathrin-, caveolae-, and dynamin-independent endocytosis (9Conner S.D. Schmid S.L. Nature. 2003; 422: 37-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (3101) Google Scholar). It is not fully understood how CPPs enter cells, but the process seems to differ from peptide to peptide. In general, cells rapidly internalize most CPPs in an energy-independent manner, and their uptake is unaffected by most inhibitors of classical endocytic pathways. Furthermore, it does not appear that these peptides are internalized by a receptor-mediated process, because identical transduction properties are observed for their D-isomers (1Temsamani J. Vidal P. Drug. Discov. Today. 2004; 9: 1012-1019Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). These data suggest that many CPPs enter cells by a non-classical endocytic pathway. Recently published data suggest that some CPPs enter cells by fluid phase macropinocytosis, a specialized form of endocytosis that is independent of caveolae, clathrin, and dynamin (10Wadia J.S. Stan R.V. Dowdy S.F. Nat. Med. 2004; 10: 310-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (1427) Google Scholar, 11Kaplan I.M. Wadia J.S. Dowdy S.F. J. Control Release. 2005; 102: 247-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (580) Google Scholar). Consequently, it appears that some peptides may use a distinct mechanism of translocation or that they have the ability to enter cells through alternative pathways (12Lundberg P. Langel U. J. Mol. Recognit. 2003; 16: 227-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Such a pathway has been suggested for penetratin, which enters cells not by an endocytic pathway but by translocation across lipid bilayers (13Thoren P.E. Persson D. Karlsson M. Norden B. FEBS Lett. 2000; 482: 265-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). CPPs have tremendous potential in biotechnology because of their ability to increase uptake and/or nuclear targeting of biologically active proteins or molecules by cells. CPPs may be able to deliver a wide variety of therapeutic compounds. A variety of cargoes have been successfully linked to the protein transduction domains of CPPs, including small and intermediate molecules, peptides, full-length proteins and liposomes (14Wadia J.S. Dowdy S.F. Curr. Opin Biotechnol. 2002; 13: 52-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar). To achieve this potential, it will be important to understand how CPPs cross a biological membrane and localize to specific intracellular compartments. Work in our laboratory has focused on developing efficient ways to deliver DNA into cells for gene therapy. We have used poly-l-lysine (polyK) condensed DNA complexes to effectively deliver DNA to cells both in vitro and in vivo. To target and increase cellular uptake of these complexes, we covalently attached a small peptide ligand, called C105Y, to polyK before DNA condensation. This peptide was initially identified as an amino acid sequence within the C-terminal tail of α1-antitrypsin (α1-AT) that could mediate binding to the serpin enzyme complex receptor (sec-R). Presumably, when α1-AT binds to elastase, it undergoes conformational change, exposing this peptide sequence, which is then available to its receptor to promote cellular uptake of the α1-AT·elastase complex (15Perlmutter D.H. Glover G.I. Rivetna M. Schasteen C.S. Fallon R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 3753-3757Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). This receptor was characterized mainly by biochemical means as a cell surface binding site on human hepatoma (HepG2) cells and blood monocytes and, as of yet, has not been cloned. The synthetic peptide ligand C105Y, based on amino acids 346-374 of α1-AT, competed with the natural ligand for binding to the sec-R and provided gene transfer into cells when it was conjugated polyK·DNA complexes (16Joslin G. Fallon R.J. Bullock J. Adams S.P. Perlmutter D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 11282-11288Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Ziady A.G. Perales J.C. Ferkol T. Gerken T. Beegen H. Perlmutter D.H. Davis P.B. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: G545-G552PubMed Google Scholar). These particles, which average 25 nm in diameter by electron microscope, can provide gene transfer of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator gene in vivo to airway epithelial cells from cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator-deficient mice. This gene transfer is sufficient to partially correct the chloride transport defect and to reverse the down-regulation of NOS-2 that is also a characteristic of cystic fibrosis mouse nasal epithelium (18Ziady A.G. Kelley T.J. Milliken E. Ferkol T. Davis P.B. Mol. Ther. 2002; 5: 413-419Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Other studies in mice show significant enhancement of gene transfer in the lung, liver, and spleen by inclusion of C105Y in the complex (19Ziady A.G. Kim J. Colla J. Davis P.B. Gene Ther. 2004; 11: 1378-1390Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). In vitro studies show that the enhancement depends on the density of ligand substitution as well as chain length of the poly-l-lysine. In these studies C105Y increased both the intensity and the duration of reporter gene expression (20Ziady A.G. Ferkol T. Gerken T. Dawson D.V. Perlmutter D.H. Davis P.B. Gene Ther. 1998; 5: 1685-1697Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 21Ziady A.G. Ferkol T. Dawson D.V. Perlmutter D.H. Davis P.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4908-4916Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). To determine why conjugating C105Y peptide to polyK condensed DNA complexes increased the efficacy of gene transfer, we investigated the mechanism by which this peptide enters cells. C105Y by itself could penetrate the cell membrane rapidly, enter the cytoplasm, and localize to the nucleus and nucleolus of live HuH7 cells. In this study we describe the mechanism by which C105Y enters cells and travels to the nucleus. Our data suggest that C105Y does not undergo receptor binding but rather is a novel cell-penetrating peptide. Constructs and Reagents—The constructs encoding for EGFP and EGFP-DIII (Eps15 mutant) were a gift from Alexandre Benmerah (Faculté Necker-Enfants Malades, Paris, France). Alexa Fluor (AF)-488 conjugated transferrin (used at 50 μg/ml), Hoechst 33258 (used at 50 ng/ml), FM1-43X and FM4-64 (used at 5 μg/ml), and AF-594 labeling reagent were obtained from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). Antibodies caveolin-1 (used at 1:1000), caveolin-2 (1:200), actin (used at 1:200), and TRITC-labeled nucleolin (used at 1:100) were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Sephadex-G25 columns were obtained from Amersham Biosciences. Peptide Synthesis and Labeling—Fluorescein-labeled peptides and unlabeled C105Y were synthesized by solid phase method, purified, and subjected to high pressure liquid chromatography and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectroscopy by BIO-WORLD (Dublin, OH) and the Cleveland Clinic Foundation (Cleveland, OH), respectively. The peptides were dissolved in 5% Me2SO and PBS, and the stocks were periodically tested by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization for peptide integrity. To attach AF-594 to unlabeled C105Y, peptide was dissolved in 0.1 m sodium bicarbonate buffer, pH 8.3, and incubated with AF-594 labeling reagent for 1 h at room temperature. The conjugate was separated from unreacted labeling reagent using Sephadex G-25 columns. Cells and Cell Culture—Human Hepatoma cells (HuH7) were maintained as previously described in RPMI medium (17Ziady A.G. Perales J.C. Ferkol T. Gerken T. Beegen H. Perlmutter D.H. Davis P.B. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: G545-G552PubMed Google Scholar) with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS). HuH7 cells were previously shown to bind the sec-R ligand C105Y (17Ziady A.G. Perales J.C. Ferkol T. Gerken T.

Roth (Case Western Reserve University) and were maintained in RPMI medium containing 10% FCS alone or 10% FCS and 0.6 mg/ml G418, respectively (22Bhatnagar A. Sheffler D.J. Kroeze W.K.

Primary HTE cells were isolated from human tracheas, grown on filters in an air liquid interface, and maintained in medium containing Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and Ham's F-12 medium in a 1:1 ratio substituted with 2% Ultrose G. Stable Cell Line Generation—Stable cell lines HuH7-GFP and HuH7-ΔEps15 expressing EGFP or EGFP-DIII, respectively, were generated by transfecting 70% confluent HuH7 cells grown on standard six-well tissue culture plates with 1.5 μg/well EGFP or EGFP-DIII DNA combined with FuGENE. DNA plasmids encoding EGFP or EGFP-DIII were given to us by Dr. Benmerah from (Faculté Necker-Enfants Malades) (23Benmerah A. Poupon V. Cerf-Bensussan N. Dautry-Varsat A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3288-3295Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Forty-eight hours after transfection, the cells were washed and supplemented with media containing G418 (0.65 mg/ml) as the selectable marker. The surviving colonies were examined for GFP expression by fluorescence microscopy and grown to confluence before further passages. Peptide Uptake and Colocalization Studies—For experiments on peptide uptake, HuH7, HuH7-GFP, HuH7-ΔEps15, 3T3, HTE, C6, and C6-Cav-1 cells were grown to 50-70% confluence on chambered coverglass slides prior to incubation with peptide. To study intracellular peptide localization 1 μm FL-C105Y, PFVYLI, SCRAM, ΔFVYLI, or D-C105Y were incubated with HuH7 cells or 5 min in PBS with Ca2+/Mg2+ at room temperature. The cells were fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde and analyzed by fluorescence microscopy. To study the effect of low temperature on the cellular uptake of C105Y, HuH7 cells were preincubated at 4 °C for 1 h in serum-free medium. The cells were then coincubated with AF-594-C105Y and AF-488-transferrin for 30 min at 4 °C. The cell were then washed with PBS and either fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde or further incubated in serum-free medium for 30 min at 37 °C. For colocalization studies, the cells were preincubated with fluorescent live cell markers in serum-free medium at 37 °C for 15 min followed by addition of fluorescently labeled peptide for 5 min in the same medium at room temperature. Subsequently the cells were fixed and analyzed by fluorescence microscopy. Fluorescence Microscopy—For analysis of the subcellular localization of C105Y in live cells, HuH7 cells were cultured on coverslips and mounted into a diffusion chamber. FITC-C105Y in PBS was continuously perfused into the chamber for 1 min followed by PBS. The cells were imaged by wide field fluorescent microscopy over a period of 20 min starting with peptide addition. At 20 min, time lapse acquisition was stopped, and a z-stack was acquired to determine peptide location. Alternatively, the subcellular localization of C105Y was evaluated in fixed cells. The cells to be processed for immunofluorescence were washed with PBS and fixed for 5 min at room temperature with 2% paraformaldehyde in PBS. All of the samples were examined in dual channels using a Zeiss Axiovert 200 utilizing wide field microscopy with Autoquant deconvolution software for analysis, because of the superior signal to noise ratio of wide field microscopy images in comparison with laser scanning confocal microscopy (24Swedlow J.R. Hu K. Andrews P.D. Roos D.S. Murray J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 2014-2019Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Acquired z1-sections were processed using Hygens confocal deconvolution software. Antibody Staining—FITC-C105Y (1 μm) was added to four-well glass slides containing HuH7 cells plated 2 days prior. After 5 min of incubation of cells with FITC-C105Y peptide at 21 °C, the cells were washed and fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde. The cells were then permeabilized with 0.1% Nonidet P-40 for 30 min before blocking with 1% bovine serum albumin in PBS and the addition of primary antibody in 1% bovine serum albumin for 1 h. Following this, the cells were washed and incubated with Texas Red-labeled secondary antibody. Western Blot Analysis—For Western blot analysis, 20 μg of total cell lysate prepared from HuH7, C6, and C6-Cav-1 cells were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Bio-Rad). The primary antibodies were amplified by HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies and detected with Pico Enhanced Chemiluminescence (Pierce). The peptides used in this study are shown in Table 1. C105Y is a fluorescently labeled, 17-amino acid sequence based on residues 346-374 of sec-R. PFVYLI is a synthetic peptide that represents the C-terminal portion of C105Y and includes the proposed binding sequence to α1-AT. SCRAM is a peptide with the scrambled binding sequence of C105Y (ILVFY). ΔFVYLI is a C-terminal truncation mutant designed to eliminate the proposed binding sequence of C105Y. D-C105Y is the D-isomer of C105Y, which was synthesized with D-amino acids to determine the specific structural requirements of C105Y uptake.TABLE 1Primary structures of peptides used in this study Open table in a new tab C105Y Peptide Localizes to the Nucleus and Nucleolus in Fixed HuH7 Cells and Other Cell Types—To determine whether C105Y peptide alone can enter different cell types, the peptide was fluorescently labeled and added to cultured human hepatoma (HuH7), mouse fibroblast (3T3), and primary HTE cells. Surprisingly, after only 5 min of incubation, C105Y peptide (Fig. 1, A-C) was not only present in the cytoplasm but showed enrichment of fluorescent signal in the nucleus and nucleolus. This pattern was more pronounced in HuH7 cells compared with 3T3 and HTE cells. To locate C105Y in the nucleolus, we stained HuH7 cells with an antibody against the nucleolar protein nucleolin (Fig. 1E), which is normally present in the nucleolus and sometimes in the cytoplasm of cells. The orange color in the merged image (Fig. 1F) indicates that C105Y colocalizes with the nucleolin present in the nucleolus. These data, taken together, suggest that C105Y can enter the nucleus and nucleolus in several different cell types very rapidly. C105Y Peptide Is Rapidly Internalized by Live HuH7 Cells—The data in fixed cells suggest that C105Y can rapidly enter cells, a characteristic of most CPPs. However, recent evidence suggests that cell fixation, even under mild conditions, can lead to an artificial uptake or redistribution of these peptides (25Richard J.P. Melikov K. Vives E. Ramos C. Verbeure B. Gait M.J. Chernomordik L.V. Lebleu B. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 585-590Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1483) Google Scholar). To confirm that C105Y can rapidly enter cells and that our previous observation was not due to an artifact of fixation, FL-C105Y was added to live HuH7 cells. The cells were visualized by live cell fluorescent microscopy, and images were taken every 20 s for the first 5 min and every 2 min thereafter (Fig. 2). These time lapse images revealed that C105Y peptide is internalized by HuH7 cells within a few seconds and reaches the nucleus and nucleolus as rapidly as 3 min. Therefore, the ability of C105Y to penetrate cells and localize to the nucleus and nucleolus is not an artifact of fixation, because C105Y can enter living cells. Sequence-dependent Uptake of C105Y Peptide—Although cells internalize C105Y peptide, it was unknown which part of the C105Y sequence was responsible for its internalization and nuclear localization. Previous work by others indicates that a pentapeptide sequence in the C-terminal portion of α1-AT (FVFLM) was necessary to bind the putative sec-R (15Perlmutter D.H. Glover G.I. Rivetna M. Schasteen C.S. Fallon R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 3753-3757Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). A synthetic analog of this peptide with sequence FVYLI could block binding and internalization of α1-AT complexes. When the amino acid sequence of these synthetic peptides were altered by mutating specific residues or scrambling amino acid sequences, they were unable to block the binding and internalization of α1-AT complexes. These data suggested that the binding of α1-AT complexes to the sec-R was sequence-specific (16Joslin G. Fallon R.J. Bullock J. Adams S.P. Perlmutter D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 11282-11288Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, we hypothesized that because the synthetic peptide PFVYLI could bind the putative sec-R and block the internalization of α1-AT complexes, it would also be able to enter cells similarly to C105Y. Additionally, we wanted to determine whether altering this putative binding sequence would abolish the ability of C105Y to enter cells. Consequently, we engineered a scrambled mutant (SCRAM) and a truncated peptide (ΔFVYLI) that lacks the proposed binding sequence to determine whether these peptides could be internalized and trafficked to the nucleus. Amino acid sequences for the above mentioned peptide can be found in Table 1. The previously reported pentapeptide-binding sequence PFVYLI (Fig. 3A) and the scrambled mutant SCRAM (Fig. 3D) were internalized by HuH7 cells and displayed a staining pattern identical to C105Y (Fig. 1A). However, the peptide lacking the pentapeptide-binding sequence (ΔFVYLI) was not taken up by HuH7 cells (Fig. 3G). Therefore, it appears that the C-terminal amino acids of C105Y (PFVYLI) alone can mediate cellular uptake and nuclear targeting of C105Y. Interestingly neither cellular uptake nor nuclear localization of the scrambled mutant is impaired, which suggests that the order of amino acids within the C-terminal region does not influence cell penetration and nuclear localization. This is in contrast to prior data for putative sec-R ligands and suggests that this binding site may not be accessed in this model or at least does not account for most of the uptake. Uptake of the C105Y D-isomer—To further test whether C105Y accessed HuH7 cells via a receptor mediated pathway or as a cell-penetrating peptide, we synthesized the D-isomer of C105Y. Previously published data suggest that D-isomers of the TAT CPP were taken up as efficiently as the native peptide (26Wender P.A. Mitchell D.J. Pattabiraman K. Pelkey E.T. Steinman L. Rothbard J.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 13003-13008Crossref PubMed Scopus (1423) Google Scholar), indicating that TAT entered cells in a receptor-independent fashion. FL-D-C105Y accumulated in the cytoplasm of HuH7 cells as outlined by FM4-64 (Fig. 4B), a marker for endocytic vesicles, but did not enter the nucleus or nucleolus (Fig. 4A). However, although cytoplasmic accumulation of D-C105Y occurs, its pattern differs from the distribution pattern of C105Y, SCRAM, and PFVYLI in the cytoplasm. These data indicate that no specific spatial orientation of the amino acids comprising the hydrophobic C terminus is needed for cell penetration. This provides further evidence that cellular uptake is not a receptor-mediated event. However, nuclear and nucleolar targeting appears to be stereo-selective. C105Y Nucleolar Localization, but Not Internalization, Is an Energy-dependent Process—We wanted to elucidate the mechanism by which C105Y enters cells and determine whether uptake is energy-dependent. Receptor-mediated endocytosis through clathrin-coated pits is an energy-dependent process that can be inhibited by incubating cells at 4 °C. To determine whether the import of C105Y into cells is energy-dependent, FL-C105Y peptide was incubated with HuH7 cells at 4 °C. As a control, AF-488-transferrin, which is internalized through clathrin-coated pits, an energy-dependent endocytic process, was added to cells as well. At 4 °C, HuH7 cells internalized FL-C105Y into the cytoplasm and nucleus. However, no FL-C105Y was observed in the nucleolus at 4 °C (Fig. 5A). In contrast, endocytosis of transferrin was completely inhibited at 4 °C, and the protein remained bound to its receptor on the cell surface (Fig. 5B). Therefore, it appears that C105Y enters cells and even the nucleus in an energy-independent process. To determine whether peptide localization to the nucleolus was energy-dependent, HuH7 cells were first incubated with FL-C105Y at 4 °C; excess peptide in the medium was removed and replaced with fresh media to be incubated at 37 °C. After incubation at 37 °C, C105Y was present in the nucleolus (Fig. 5D), suggesting that nucleolar uptake is energy-dependent. Similarly, transferrin was endocytosed by cells at 37 °C and localized within the cytoplasm. (Fig. 5E). Therefore, it appears that C105Y does not enter cells by an energy-dependent process. However, C105Y requires an energy-dependent process to enter the nucleolus. C105Y Peptide Is Internalized by a Clathrin-independent Pathway—Endocytosis can occur through a variety of mechanisms, each providing a distinct pathway for the selective uptake of molecules by cells. These distinct pathways include clathrin-mediated, caveolae/lipid raft-mediated, and clathrin- and caveolae-independent endocytosis. The classically described route for entry of proteins into cells is via clathrin-coated pits, whereby proteins bind to specific receptors on the cell surface, and these ligand·receptor complexes cluster and are internalized in an energy-dependent manner by clathrin-coated membrane vesicles (27Smythe E. Warren G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 202: 689-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). To examine the role of clathrin-coated pits in C105Y uptake, stable HuH7-GFP and HuH7-ΔEps15 cell lines were created expressing either EGFP or EGFP-DIII, respectively (Fig. 6, B and E). The EGFP-DIII plasmid construct was created by Benmerah et al. (23Benmerah A. Poupon V. Cerf-Bensussan N. Dautry-Varsat A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3288-3295Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) and encodes a partial Eps15 sequence that is normally required for the early steps of clathrin-dependent endocytosis. The EGFP-DIII construct has a deletion in the C-terminal domain of Eps15, which contains AP-2-binding regions important for targeting AP-2 to the clathrin-coated pits. It was shown that transfection of this construct into HeLa cells (23Benmerah A. Poupon V. Cerf-Bensussan N. Dautry-Varsat A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3288-3295Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) and HuH7 cells (data not shown) inhibited transferrin uptake and thus interfered with clathrin-coated pit formation. When fluorescently labeled C105Y was added to either of these stable cell lines, it was rapidly internalized and routed to the nucleus and nucleolus (Fig. 6, A and D), suggesting that clathrin-coated pits are not involved in"
https://openalex.org/W1994260849,"The most distinctive feature of the human pathogenic fungus is a polysaccharide capsule that is essential for virulence and is composed primarily of glucuronoxylomannan (GXM) and galactoxylomannan (GalXM). GXM mediates multiple deleterious effects on host immune function, yet relatively little is known about its physical properties. The average mass of Cryptococcus neoformans GXM from four antigenically different strains ranged from 1.7 to 7 × 106 daltons as calculated from Zimm plots of light-scattering data. GalXM was significantly smaller than GXM, with an average mass of 1 × 105 daltons. These molecular masses imply that GalXM is the most numerous polysaccharide in the capsule on a molar basis. The radius of gyration of the capsular polysaccharides ranged between 68 and 208 nm. Viscosity measurements suggest that neither polysaccharide altered fluid dynamics during infection since GXM behaved in solution as a polyelectrolyte and GalXM did not increase solution viscosity. Immunoblot analysis indicated heterogeneity within GXM. In agreement with this, scanning transmission electron microscopy of GXM preparations revealed a tangled network of two different types of molecules. Mass per length measurements from light scattering and scanning transmission electron microscopy were consistent and suggested GXM molecules self-associate. A mechanism for capsule growth is proposed based on the extracellular release and entanglement of GXM molecules.

Cryptococcus neoformans causes life-threatening systemic disease in individuals with impaired immunity. Cryptococcosis is a relatively common disease in individuals with late stage human immunodeficiency virus disease, certain cancers, and transplanted organs (1Perfect J.R. Casadevall A. Infect. Dis. Clin. North Am. 2002; 16 (5–6): 837-874Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). Recently, cases of cryptococcosis have been reported after anti-tumor necrosis factor-α therapy for rheumatoid arthritis (2Arend S.M. Kuijper E.J. Allaart C.F. Muller W.H. Van Dissel J.T. Eur. J.

Chest. 2003; 124: 2395-2397Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), once again highlighting the potential of this organism to cause disease in immunosuppressed hosts. Suspected cryptococcal infection is often confirmed through microscopic identification of capsulated yeast from sputum or cerebrospinal fluid because C. neoformans is the only major fungal pathogen of humans that is encapsulated. The polysaccharide capsule that surrounds the fungus promotes survival within the host (5Kozel T.R. Cazin Jr., J. Infect. Immun. 1971; 3: 287-294Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It is composed of two polysaccharides, glucuronoxylomannan (GXM) 4The abbreviations used are: GXM, glucuronoxylomannan; GalXM, galactoxylomannan; MW, weight-averaged mass; mAb, monoclonal antibody; STEM, scanning transmission electron microscopy. 4The abbreviations used are: GXM, glucuronoxylomannan; GalXM, galactoxylomannan; MW, weight-averaged mass; mAb, monoclonal antibody; STEM, scanning transmission electron microscopy. and galactoxylomannan (GalXM). The capsule may also contain members of the large family of mannoproteins, which are present in the cell wall and are also secreted (6Vartivarian S.E. Reyes G.H. Jacobson E.S. James P.G. Cherniak R. Mumaw V.R. Tingler M.J. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 6850-6852Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7Cherniak R. Reiss E. Turner S.H. Carbohydr. Res. 1982; 103: 239-250Crossref Scopus (93) Google Scholar). The vast majority of the capsular mass is thought to be GXM (∼88%) (7Cherniak R. Reiss E. Turner S.H. Carbohydr. Res. 1982; 103: 239-250Crossref Scopus (93) Google Scholar), and this capsular component has, consequently, received most of the attention in immunological studies, which have consistently demonstrated numerous deleterious effects on immunological function. GXM inhibits phagocytosis of C. neoformans in the absence of opsonins and is either secreted or released from the organism into the surrounding tissue in large quantities (8Kozel T.R. Infect. Immun. 1977; 16: 99-106Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9Casadevall A. Mukherjee J. Scharff M.D. J. Immunol. Methods. 1992; 154: 27-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). GXM also inhibits a productive inflammatory response by disrupting macrophage maturation, neutrophil migration, and leukocyte extravasation while enhancing interleukin 10 production and down-regulating tumor necrosis factor-α and interleukin 1β production (10Vecchiarelli A.

Infect. Dis. 2005; 191: 127-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Although the mechanisms responsible for these effects are not well understood, GXM can interact with the cellular receptor CD14, and Toll-like receptors 2 and 4 (13Shoham S. Huang C. Chen J.M. Golenbock D.T. Levitz S.M. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 4620-4626Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). Binding of Toll-like receptor 4 appears critical for inhibiting neutrophil migration and the up-regulation of Fas ligand on macrophages (14Monari C. Pericolini E. Bistoni G. Casadevall A. Kozel T.R.

GXM has attracted interest as a vaccine component and a target for antibody-based therapy since antibody to GXM is protective in animal models. Interestingly, the depressive effects of GXM on the immune system may imply usefulness as a therapeutic molecule capable of modulating the immune response in inflammatory diseases, such as streptococcal arthritis (16Mukherjee S.

Knowledge on the structures and physical properties of GXM, GalXM, and the capsule is essential in understanding their role in cryptococcal pathogenesis and for the development of GXM-based therapeutic approaches. GXM is a co-polymer of up to six different repeating units that consists mostly of a linear α(1→3)-mannan trisaccharide with side groups consisting of a β(1→2)-glucopyranosyluronic acid and 0–4 mol of β(1→2) and β(1→4)-xylopyranosyl (21Cherniak R. Valafar H. Morris L.C. Valafar F. Clin. Diagn. Lab. Immunol. 1998; 5: 146-159Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). 5D. C. McFadden, F. Wang, and A. Casadevall, unpublished data. 5D. C. McFadden, F. Wang, and A. Casadevall, unpublished data. The mannan backbone of GXM is modified by acetyl groups, although specific patterns of acetylation are unknown (22Cherniak R. Jones R.G. Reiss E. Carbohydr. Res. 1988; 172: 113-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The GXM of individual strains of C. neoformans differ in their ratios of the repeating units, and recent oligosaccharide compositional analysis suggests the occurrence of non-uniform side group addition and variability in co-polymerization (21Cherniak R. Valafar H. Morris L.C. Valafar F. Clin. Diagn. Lab. Immunol. 1998; 5: 146-159Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). 5D. C. McFadden, F. Wang, and A. Casadevall, unpublished data. Alterations in GXM composition have been experimentally correlated with changes in C. neoformans virulence, inhibition of neutrophil migration, and antibody recognition (15Ellerbroek P.M.

In contrast to GXM, the contribution of GalXM to capsule architecture and pathogenesis has not been well studied. GalXM has an α-(1,6)-galactan backbone containing four potential short oligosaccharide branch structures. The branches are 3-O-linked to the backbone and consist of an αMan-(1→3)-αMan (1→4)-βGal trisaccharide with variable amounts of β(1→2) or β(1→3) xylose side groups (28Vaishnav V.V. Bacon B.E. O'Neill M. Cherniak R. Carbohydr. Res. 1998; 306: 315-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). The backbone of GalXM consists of galactopyranose and a small amount of galactofuranose, unlike GXM, which only contains mannopyranose. Studies of molecular mass revealed that GalXM is the more abundant polysaccharide in the capsule and that the mass of GXM from two var. gatti strains were larger than from two var. neoformans strains. Viscosity studies suggested that capsular polysaccharides do not disrupt normal fluid mechanics. Quantitative high resolution electron microscopy revealed two different GXM structures and, unexpectedly, suggested GXM self-interactions. A model of capsule assembly based upon polysaccharide-polysaccharide interactions is proposed. GXM Isolation—C. neoformans was grown in Sabouraud dextrose broth at 30 °C with shaking at 150 rpm. GXM was isolated from 2-week-old culture supernatant and purified as described by Cherniak et al. (21Cherniak R. Valafar H. Morris L.C. Valafar F. Clin. Diagn. Lab. Immunol. 1998; 5: 146-159Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Supernatant was filtered through 0.45-μm filters to remove any cryptococcal cells remaining after low speed centrifugal separation. The polysaccharide was then precipitated from the supernatant with 10% (w/v) sodium acetate and 2.5 volumes of ethanol. The amount of carbohydrate in the water-solubilized precipitant was determined by the phenol-sulfuric acid method (29Dubois M. Gilles K.A. Hamilton J.K. Rebers P.A. Smith F. Anal. Chem. 1956; 28: 350-356Crossref Scopus (39378) Google Scholar). The solution was adjusted to 0.2 m NaCl, and GXM was selectively precipitated using 3 g of hexyldecyltrimethylammonium bromide (Sigma) for each gram of carbohydrate present. GXM was then dissolved in 2 m NaCl, dialyzed extensively against 1 m NaCl to remove hexyldecyltrimethylammonium bromide, and then dialyzed against distilled water for 2 days. GXM was collected by lyophilization. GalXM Isolation—GalXM was isolated from the culture supernatant according to Vaishnav et al. (28Vaishnav V.V. Bacon B.E. O'Neill M. Cherniak R. Carbohydr. Res. 1998; 306: 315-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Briefly, a 100-ml culture of C. neoformans acapsular mutant of strain B-3501, cap67, was grown in Sabouraud dextrose broth for 7 days. Although GalXM has been identified in the supernatant of a capsulated strain (7Cherniak R. Reiss E. Turner S.H. Carbohydr. Res. 1982; 103: 239-250Crossref Scopus (93) Google Scholar), the successful isolation of significant quantities of GalXM has been reported only for cap67. The use of this strain for GalXM production also prevented the contamination of the preparation with GXM, a complication present with capsulated strains. The culture supernatant was separated from the cells by centrifugation at 890 × g for 15 min at room temperature and then concentrated using a 10,000 Mr cut-off Amicon centrifugal filter (Millipore, Bedford, MA). The material was then dialyzed for 3 days against distilled water, and the 10,000 retentate, containing GalXM and mannoproteins, was filter sterilized with a 0.2-μm filter. The solution was lyophilized and stored at room temperature. For separation of GalXM from the mannoproteins, the freeze-dried mixture was dissolved in 25 ml of start buffer. Start buffer consisted of a 0.01 m Tris base and 0.5 m NaCl solution, pH 7.2, to which CaCl2 and Mn(II)Cl2 was sequential added at final concentrations of 1 mm. The GalXM and mannoprotein solution was then continuously passed through a concanavalin A-Sepharose 4B column (2.5 × 10 cm) (Sigma) for 16 h at 4 °C using a peristaltic pump with a flow rate of 16 ml/h. The flow-through and 11 column washes of start buffer were collected as 20-ml fractions. GalXM-containing fractions, identified by a positive reaction in the phenol-sulfuric acid assay for carbohydrates (29Dubois M. Gilles K.A. Hamilton J.K. Rebers P.A. Smith F. Anal. Chem. 1956; 28: 350-356Crossref Scopus (39378) Google Scholar), were combined, ultra-concentrated as before, and dialyzed against water for 7 days. GalXM was then recovered by lyophilization. Compositional analysis of GalXM was confirmed by combined gas chromatography/mass spectrometry of the per-O-trimethylsilyl derivatives of the monosaccharide methyl glycosides produced from the sample by acidic methanolysis. Molecular Mass Determination of GXM and GalXM—The polysaccharides were diluted in sterile-filtered, degassed ultra-pure water to the desired concentrations from a freshly made 5 mg/ml stock solution. The change in refractive index (dn/dc) of the samples was measured by differential refractometry using a 620-nm laser source (BI-DNDC; Brookhaven Instruments Corp., Holtsville, NY) at 30 °C. The molecular mass was determined at room temperature by multi-angle laser light-scattering (BI-MwA analyzer, Brookhaven Instruments Corp., Holtsville, NY) using a 675-nm laser source. Before the mass measurements the system was calibrated against toluene and normalized for Rayleigh scattering with 20-nm microspheres (Duke Scientific Corp., Palo Alto, CA). The weight-averaged mass (Mw) was calculated by the Zimm equation (30Zimm B.H. J. Chem. Phys. 1948; 16: 1093-1099Crossref Scopus (1154) Google Scholar), Kc/ΔR(θ) = 1/(Mw)(P(θ)) + 2A2c, where K is the optical constant, defined as the quotient of 4π 2n 2o(dn/dc)2)/NA λ 4o, and ΔR(θ) is the excess Rayleigh factor, determined by comparing the sample and solvent values at angle (θ) and concentration (c). P(θ) represents the particle scattering function, A2 is the second virial coefficient, no is the refractive index of the solvent, NA equals Avogadro's number, and λo is the modal wavelength of the laser source. The dn/dc values were adjusted according to the Cauchy equation (dn/dc = A + B/λ2), using a B coefficient for aqueous solutions of +0.0022 μm and wavelengths (λ) in microns to accommodate for the longer wavelength of the molecular weight analyzer. Depolarization corrections were assumed to be negligible. All samples were passed through an in-line 0.8-μm syringe filter to eliminate large aggregates and reduce extraneous sources of refracted or scattered light. Electrophoretic Analysis of GXM—A 0.5% (w/v) agarose solution was made by dissolving the agarose in 1× TAE buffer (40 mm Tris base, 20 mm sodium acetate, and 1 mm EDTA in ultrapure water) using microwave heating. The solution was not permitted to exceed the boiling point during the heating process and was cooled to 50 °C in a water bath before use. The agarose was poured into IBI/Shelton Scientific gel casting trays to produce either 70 × 100 × 6- or 200 × 250 × 6-mm gels. Sample wells were 2-mm wide. Gels were submerged in either 250 ml or 1.5 liters of 1× TAE buffer. GXM samples were 6 μl in volume and contained 10 μg of GXM and 1× loading buffer (30% glycerol, 0.25% bromphenol blue, 0.25% xylene cyanol FF). Electrophoresis conditions were 3 V/cm for 8 h. Polysaccharide was transferred to Hybond Nylon+ membrane (Amersham Biosciences) using a submerged tank blotting system (Genie Blotter; Idea Scientific, Minneapolis, MN). Transfer conditions were performed in 1× TAE at 9 V for 1 h. After transfer, the membrane was incubated for 30–60 min in 5% (w/v) nonfat milk in Tris-buffered saline (10 mm Tris, pH 7.2, 150 mm NaCl) followed by a standard Western blotting protocol. Primary antibodies used were murine monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) to GXM and are designated 2H1 (IgG1), 18B7 (IgG1), 12A1 (IgM), 13F1 (IgM), and 21D2 (IgM) (31Casadevall A. Mukherjee J. Devi S.J.

Primary antibodies were used at a concentration of 13 nm (2 μg/ml, IgG; 13.3 μg/ml, IgM). Secondary antibodies were either alkaline phosphatase-coupled goat-anti-mouse IgG1, -IgM, or -Igκ (Southern Biotechnology Associates, Birmingham, AL) and used at 1 μg/ml in Tris-buffered saline. GXM was visualized by incubating the membrane in the alkaline phosphatase detection substrates 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate/nitro blue tetrazolium (KPL, Gaithersburg, Maryland). At the completion of the reaction, the filters were rinsed briefly with distilled water and air-dried in the dark at room temperature. Capsule Thickness Measurements—C. neoformans cells from 2-week-old cultures were suspended in India ink (BD Biosciences and visualized at 1000× magnification with an Olympus AX70 microscope. Images were captured with a QImaging Retiga 1300 digital camera using the QCapture Suite Version 2.46 software (QImaging, Burnaby BC, Canada). Capsule measurements were made on 25 randomly chosen cells from each strain. Scanning Transmission Electron Microscopy—GXM (1 mg) was dissolved in 1 ml of water over 3 days. The GXM solution was freeze-dried onto titanium electron microscope grids coated with a thick holey carbon film. Scanning transmission electron microscopy was performed at 40 keV with a 0.25-nm focused probe. Dark field images were digitally recorded as scans of 1.024 μm with a scanning pixel size of 20 Å2. Mass measurements were calculated using the PCMass26 software. Tobacco mosaic virus was added to all samples as an internal control and had a mass per length of 131 kDa/nm. Viscosity—Viscosity was measured using a modified Ostwald-type capillary glass viscometer (Cannon-Manning Semi-Micro, Technical Glass Co., Dover, NJ) at 25 °C. GXM and dextran (high fraction; East Kodak Co.) were dissolved in ultrapure water at a concentration of 10 mg/ml for 3–4 days at room temperature. GalXM was dissolved in ultrapure water at a concentration of 100 mg/ml for 2 days at room temperature. Diluted samples were made in ultrapure water, mixed, and equilibrated to 25 °C before testing. For intrinsic viscosity measurements, 3 ml of each sample was tested. For polyelectrolyte studies, 2.25 ml of each sample was tested. The ionic strength of the solution was adjusted with NaCl. Ionic strength was calculated by the standard equation I = ½ΣZi2Ci, where Z is the charge of the individual ions, and C is the concentration of the individual ions. Flow-time measurements were taken in triplicate and averaged. The relative viscosity increment (ηi; also known as specific viscosity, ηsp) is defined as the change in the ratio of the flow time of the sample to the solvent that is specifically due to the sample particles. The intrinsic viscosity ([η]) is defined as the limiting value of the reduced viscosity ([η] = limc→0 (ηi/c)). These terms and definitions are in accordance with the 1989 International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry guidelines for polymers (34Kratochvil P. Suter U.W. Pure Appl. Chem. 1989; 61: 211-241Crossref Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Average Molecular Mass and Radius of Gyration of Polysaccharides Determined from Multi-angle Laser Light Scattering—The average molecular mass (Mw) of GXM from four genetically distinct strains was determined using multi-angle laser light scattering and the Zimm formalism (30Zimm B.H. J. Chem. Phys. 1948; 16: 1093-1099Crossref Scopus (1154) Google Scholar). The different serotypes of C. neoformans have substantially different GXM structures, as determined by 1H NMR chemotyping analysis (21Cherniak R. Valafar H. Morris L.C. Valafar F. Clin. Diagn. Lab. Immunol. 1998; 5: 146-159Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Strains from the same serotype generally share significant similarities in their GXM structures (21Cherniak R. Valafar H. Morris L.C. Valafar F. Clin. Diagn. Lab. Immunol. 1998; 5: 146-159Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, the four strains also represented the four distinct serotypes (A, B, C, and D). The masses of GXM were derived from Zimm plots of light scattering data (Fig. 1). The Mw of the examined GXMs (Table 1) ranged from 1.7 to 7.3 MDa. The smallest masses were for the GXMs from the var. neoformans strains; serotype A strain H99 followed by serotype D strain B-3501. The larger masses for GXM were from the var. gatti strains, with serotype C strain 106.97 larger than serotype B strain I23.TABLE 1Comparison of GXM composition, average mass (MW), radius of gyration (Rg), mass density (MW/Rg), capsule thickness (μm), dn/dc values, and second virial coefficients (A2) for C. neoformans strains from four different serotypesStrainSerotypeGXM compositionaCherniak et al (21).Calculated mass of GXM repeatMWRgMW/RgCapsule thicknessdn/dc (620 nm)A2×106nm×103μm×10-3 cm3 mol/g2H99A12.7% M1, 57% M2, 15.7% M3, 2.3% M5, 12% M6bAverage GXM composition and mass from 54 serotype A strains ± S.D.949.69 ± 63.551.7 ± 0.0678 ± 2.821.790.6 ± 0.20.1602-0.01 ± 0.3B-3501D51% M1, 19% M2, 8% M5, 12% M6867.702.6 ± 0.52151 ± 2017.220.5 ± 0.10.15320.06 ± 0.1123B2% M1, 8.4% M2, 82% M3, 0.9% M4, 2.9% M5, 3.9% M6cAverage GXM composition and mass from 7 serotype B strains ± S.D.1094.29 ± 42.764.6 ± 0.1868 ± 3.467.651.7 ± 0.60.1549-1.18 ± 0.1106.97C1.5% M1, 7.4% M2, 31.3% M3, 52.3% M4, 2.3% M5, 5.5% M6dAverage GXM composition and mass from 11 serotype C strains ± S.D.1139.07 ± 112.927.2 ± 3.70208 ± 6534.622.0 ± 0.40.1549-3.01 ± 0.5Cap67DGalXMN/A0.101 ± 0.0395 ± 241.06N/A0.1941-1.54 ± 0.5a Cherniak et al (21Cherniak R.

Open table in a new tab The radius of gyration (Rg) was also calculated from the light scattering data. The Rg is the average distance between the center point of GXM to the outer edge of the molecule. The Rg was determined in water and is the maximal length of the molecule, as the repulsive effect of the negative glucuronic acid sugars is maximized in the absence of counter ions. The Rg values for the GXMs from the different strains showed substantial differences (68–208 nm) between strains (Table 1). The Rg was used in conjunction with the Mw to calculate the mass density of each GXM. Strain differences in mass density ranged from 17.22 to 67.65 kDa/nm (Table 1). Although Mw appeared to correlate with varietal classification, Rg did not show this trend, perhaps suggesting that the length of the molecule is a strain-specific characteristic of GXM. By light-scattering analysis, GalXM had an Mw of 101,000 and an Rg of 95 nm. The mass density, therefore, was 1.06 kDa/nm. The Mw of GalXM from the acapsular mutant cap67 was 26-fold less than the Mw of GXM from the parental strain B-3501. In contrast, the Rg of the GalXM, which contains numerous small oligosaccharide branches, was only 1.4-fold smaller. Paired comparisons between GalXM and GXM from all strains were not possible since GalXM can only be isolated sufficiently from cultures lacking GXM, and acapsular variants of the other strains are unavailable. A simplified measurement of molecular stiffness, or rigidity, suggested by Sist et al. (35Sist P. Cescutti P. Skerlavaj S. Urbani R. Leitao J.H. Sa-Correia I. Rizzo R. Carbohydr. Res. 2003; 338: 1861-1867Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) can be determined from the Mw and Rg data. The equation R 2g/Nw, where Nw is the number of sugar residues in the polysaccharide, was applied to the data for each strain. The data are: H99, 0.587 nm2; B-3501, 1.609 nm2; I23, 0.162 nm2; 106.97, 0.941 nm2. Polysaccharide Heterogeneity by Gel Electrophoresis—Prior electrophoretic studies show that GXM exhibits minimal migration in SDS-polyacrylamide gels with high porosity (36Murphy J.W. Pahlavan N. Infect. Immun. 1979; 25: 284-292Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 37Murphy J.W. Mosley R.L. Cherniak R. Reyes G.H. Kozel T.R. Reiss E. Infect. Immun. 1988; 56: 424-431Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, GalXM migrates within a 7% SDS-polyacrylamide gel (37Murphy J.W. Mosley R.L. Cherniak R. Reyes G.H. Kozel T.R. Reiss E. Infect. Immun. 1988; 56: 424-431Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We reasoned that GXM was unable to migrate under SDS-PAGE conditions due to its ∼10-fold larger mass. Therefore, electrophoretic analysis of the negatively charged GXM in 0.5% agarose gels was pursued. Attempts to visualize GXM directly in the agarose with carbohydrate stains were unsuccessful and complicated by the sugar-based nature of the agarose support matrix. After transfer to a positively charged nylon membrane, limited detection of GXM was achieved using 0.5% Alcian blue in 2% acetic acid (data not shown) (38Lee H.G. Cowman M.K. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 219: 278-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). mAbs to GXM provided a sensitive means for polysaccharide detection (Fig. 2). The different antibodies used for immunodetection have different fine specificities (27McFadden D.C. Casadevall A. J. Immunol. 2004; 172: 3670-3677Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), yet all recognized the same section of the immunoblot. This suggested that the material being detected is GXM and that entities exclusively recognized by a single mAb were not identifiable, possibly because each GXM molecule contained the multiple epitopes recognized by these antibodies. GXM was also transferred to nitrocellulose, and polyvinylidene difluoride membranes and mAbs detected the same area as on nylon membranes (data not shown). Variability in GXM detection on different lots of positively charged nylon was observed, although the areas of greatest GXM concentration were always detectable. The immunostaining of GXM revealed that the polysaccharide migrated over a significant area with some GXM still present near the sample well. Two potential explanations existed for this result. One was that GXM was heterogeneous, as is common for polysaccharides. The second was that the sample well had been overloaded. To distinguish between these possibilities, a lane of GXM, which had been subjected to electrophoresis, was cut from the gel and re-oriented horizontally at the top of a second agarose gel. The separated GXM formed the sample area of a second agarose gel and was subjected to a second round of electrophoresis. If the original migration pattern was an artifact of overloading, then by reducing the concentration of GXM at each point across the second gel a horizontal band of GXM should be detected by the antibodies. Instead, a diagonal migration pattern was observed after the second round of electrophore"

Hydrogenases are metalloproteins that catalyze the reversible activation of molecular hydrogen and enable an organism to either utilize H2 as a source of reducing power or to use protons as terminal electron acceptors, thus generating H2 gas. Based on their metal content, hydrogenases are divided into three classes, [Ni-Fe]-hydrogenases (1Volbeda A. Charon M.H. Piras C. Hatchikian E.C. Frey M. Fontecilla-Camps J.C. Nature. 1995; 373: 580-587Crossref PubMed Scopus (1394) Google Scholar), [Fe-Fe]-hydrogenases (2Peters J.W. Lanzilotta W.N. Lemon B.J. Seefeldt L.C.

Rev. 2001; 25: 455-501Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). [Fe-Fe]-hydrogenases are limited to certain anaerobic bacteria and anaerobic eukaryotes and are often involved in H2 evolution with catalytic activities up to 100 times higher than those of [Ni-Fe]-hydrogenases (8Adams M.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1020: 115-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (724) Google Scholar). At their active site they contain a dinuclear iron center attached to the protein by only one bond between a cysteine residue and one of the two iron atoms (Fig. 1). This cysteine also serves as a ligand for an adjacent [4Fe-4S] cluster, so there is a sulfur bridge between the two metal sites (2Peters J.W. Lanzilotta W.N. Lemon B.J. Seefeldt L.C. Science. 1998; 282: 1853-1858Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Nicolet Y. Piras C. Legrand P. Hatchikian E.C. Fontecilla-Camps J.C. Struct. Fold.

[Fe-Fe]-hydrogenases also contain additional [2Fe-2S] and [4Fe-4S] clusters, which shuttle electrons between the H2 activating site, inside the protein, and the redox partners at the surface. One remarkable property of the [Ni-Fe]- and [Fe-Fe]-hydrogenase active sites is the presence of carbon monoxide and cyanide ligands as clearly established by x-ray crystallography (1Volbeda A.

Albracht S.P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 237: 629-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). In both cases CO and CN– are found coordinated to the iron atoms and are thought to allow stabilization of the low iron oxidation and spin states required for activity (10Pierik A.J. Hulstein M. Hagen W.R. Albracht S.P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 258: 572-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). Infrared spectroscopy studies have also demonstrated the presence of CO ligands in the “iron-sulfur cluster-free” hydrogenase (11Lyon E.J. Shima S. Boecker R. Thauer R.K. Grevels F.-W. Bill E. Roseboom W. Albracht S.P. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2004; 126: 14239-14248Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). In the unique case of [Fe-Fe]-hydrogenases an intriguing low molecular weight compound, still incompletely identified but often proposed to be a di(thiomethyl)amine, is bound to the di-iron site through a bridging bidentate coordination mode (Fig. 1) (12Nicolet Y. Cavazza C. Fontecilla-Camps J.C. J. Inorg. Biochem. 2002; 91: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). The presence of potentially toxic compounds such as CO and CN– and unique ligands, such as the bridging dithiol, suggests the involvement of specific accessory proteins during the synthesis of the hydrogenases active sites. It is a recent concept that the biosynthesis of biological metal clusters and their assembly within metalloproteins are carried out and tightly controlled by specific protein machineries. For example, the ISC and SUF systems, which are involved in the production of iron-sulfur clusters and their transfer into iron-sulfur proteins, or the NIF system, which is involved in the biosynthesis of the active site of the nitrogenase protein, have been extensively studied during the last decade (13Frazzon J. Dean D.R. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 2003; 7: 166-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar, 14Johnson D.C. Dean D.R. Smith A.D. Johnson M.K. Annu. Rev.

In the case of [Ni-Fe]-hydrogenases the maturation process is rather well characterized and involves at least seven proteins as well as chemical components such as ATP, GTP, and carbamoyl phosphate, which is the precursor of cyanide (16Blokesch M. Paschos A. Theodoratou E. Bauer A. Hube M. Huth S. Böck A. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2002; 30: 674-680Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). However, there is still no clear understanding of how the CO ligands are synthesized and incorporated (17Roseboom W. Blokesch M. Böck A. Albracht S.P. FEBS Lett. 2005; 579: 469-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) In contrast, the maturation of [Fe-Fe]-hydrogenases is not well understood. In fact, nothing was known in terms of accessory genes involved in the biosynthesis of the di-iron site until the very recent and important discovery of two genes required for the assembly of an active [Fe-Fe]-hydrogenase from the photosynthetic green algae Chlamydomonas reinhardtii (18Posewitz M.C.

An interesting observation is that these genes are exclusively found in [Fe-Fe]-hydrogenase-containing microorganisms. The first gene, hydEF, codes for a protein that contains two independent domains homologous to distinct prokaryotic proteins, HydE and HydF. The N-terminal domain of the HydEF protein from C. reinhardtii and that of all HydE proteins contain amino acid sequences characteristic for metalloenzymes belonging to the Radical-S-adenosylmethionine (AdoMet) 4The abbreviations used are: AdoMetS-adenosylmethionineHPLChigh performance liquid chromatography. enzyme superfamily (19Sofia H.J. Chen G. Hetzler B.G. Reyes-Spindola J.F. Miller N.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 1097-1106Crossref PubMed Scopus (805) Google Scholar). The second gene, hydG, encodes a protein that also contains signatures characteristic for the Radical-AdoMet superfamily. These enzymes are characterized by the presence of a [4Fe-4S] cluster chelated by three cysteines from a conserved CX3CX2C sequence and the ability of this cluster to catalyze the reductive cleavage of AdoMet, thus initiating radical reactions (20Fontecave M.

To study the maturation process of [Fe-Fe]-hydrogenases at the molecular level, we became interested in homologs of the C. reinhardtii hydEF and hydG genes. In Thermotoga maritima, a hyperthermophilic organism possessing only [Fe-Fe]-hydrogenases, the two domains of the HydEF protein are encoded by two separate genes, TmhydE and TmhydF, and the HydG protein is encoded by a gene localized in the same operon encoding the TmHydE protein. We have initiated a study of the three proteins, HydE, HydG and HydF, to understand the structural and functional properties of these interesting enzymes and their specific role in the assembly of the di-iron site of [Fe-Fe]-hydrogenases. We have recently reported a preliminary characterization of the Radical-AdoMet proteins, HydE and HydG (27Rubach J.K. Brazzolotto X. Gaillard J. Fontecave M. FEBS Lett. 2005; 579: 5055-5060Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). It was confirmed that they bind a [4Fe-4S] cluster able to reductively cleave AdoMet and it was also shown that they contain an additional cluster whose function is so far unknown (27Rubach J.K. Brazzolotto X. Gaillard J. Fontecave M. FEBS Lett. 2005; 579: 5055-5060Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Here we report the first isolation and characterization of the third component of the assembly machinery, the HydF protein from T. maritima. We demonstrate that it is a [4Fe-4S] iron-sulfur protein, which binds GTP and catalyzes its hydrolysis to GDP. Possible roles for the HydF protein in the maturation process are discussed. TmHydF Cloning—The open reading frame encoding the TmHydF protein (TM0445) was PCR amplified using T. maritima genomic DNA, Pwo polymerase (Roche Applied Science) and the following primers: the N terminus primer (TmHydF-F: 5′-GAGGGTGATCATATGAGATTGCCG-3′) was designed to contain a unique NdeI restriction site at the predicted initiation codon and the C terminus primer (TmHydF-R: 5′-GGCCCAGATGAAAGCTTCGTCGAG-3′) to hybridize in the 3′-untranslated region and to contain a unique HindIII restriction site. The PCR fragment was purified with the High Pure PCR kit (Roche Applied Science), double-digested with NdeI and HindIII (Fermentas), and gel-purified before direct cloning into the pT7-7 expression vector, leading to the pTmHydF plasmid. DH5α cells were transformed with the pTmHydF plasmid and one clone containing an insert with the expected size was selected for sequencing. The cloned hydF was confirmed to be wild-type when compared with the GenBank™ sequence AAD35530. TmHydF Expression and Purification—As T. maritima genes use numerous rare codons that code for arginine, isoleucine, or leucine residues, Escherichia coli BL21-CodonPlus(DE3)-RIL cells (Stratagene) were used for expression of the TmHydF protein. Cells transformed with the pTmHydF plasmid were grown in Miller's modified LB medium at 37 °C until the A600 nm reached 1, then protein expression was induced by addition of isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside to a final concentration of 0.5 mm. After 5 h, the cells were pelleted and stored at –80 °C until use. For purification, the cells were thawed in the presence of lysozyme (0.6 mg/ml) and 0.5% (v/v) Triton X-100, sonicated, and centrifuged at 180,000 × g for 1 h. DNA was removed from the supernatant by centrifugation at 10,000 × g after precipitation with 2% streptomycin sulfate. The cell-free extract was then loaded onto a Blue-Sepharose column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0. After extensive washing with the equilibration buffer, the protein was eluted from the column using 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0, containing 250 mm NaCl. Fractions containing pure protein were pooled and concentrated by ultrafiltration using a YM-30 membrane. The protein was then aliquoted, flash-frozen, and stored at –80 °C until use. Protein Characterization—Protein concentrations were determined with the Bio-Rad protein assay, using bovine serum albumin as a standard. Aerobic UV-visible absorption spectra were recorded on a Cary 1Bio spectrophotometer (Varian). Anaerobic spectrophotometric measurements were carried out within an anaerobic glove box (Jacomex) in which the cell holder is connected to an UvikonXL spectrophotometer (BioTek Instruments) outside the box by an optical fiber. Iron and sulfur quantitations were done according to the methods of Fish (28Fish W.W. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 158: 357-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (535) Google Scholar) and Beinert (29Beinert H. Anal. Biochem. 1983; 131: 373-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar), respectively. The oligomeric state of the protein was determined in the anaerobic glove box by analytical gel filtration on a Superdex 200 HR 10/30 column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated in 100 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0, 0.5 m NaCl, 2 mm dithiothreitol. Mass spectrometry and N-terminal sequencing analyses were performed by the mass spectrometry and the peptide analysis facilities of the Institut de Biologie Structurale (Grenoble, France). In Vitro Reconstitution—In a anaerobic glove box, the as-purified TmHydF protein was incubated with a 10-fold molar excess of dithiothreitol (Fermentas). The protein was then incubated with a 6-fold molar excess of a ferrous salt (NH4FeSO4·6H2O) (Sigma), 6-fold molar excess of cysteine (Sigma), and 0.02 molar equivalent of the recombinant purified cysteine desulfurase IscS protein from E. coli, available in the laboratory. The formation of the iron-sulfur cluster was followed spectrophometrically at 410 nm. When this absorption reached a plateau the protein was treated with a 6-fold molar excess of EDTA to remove unspecifically bound iron and then desalted on a Sephadex-G25 column equilibrated in 20 mm Tris buffer, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl. GTP Hydrolysis Assay—Under aerobic conditions, 20 μm of TmHydF protein was incubated at 37 °C with 500 μm GTP (Acros) and 1mm MgCl2 in 20 mm Tris buffer, pH 8.0, containing 200 mm NaCl. At time intervals, aliquots of the reaction mixture were collected and assayed for production of GDP. The samples were analyzed by reverse phase HPLC on a ZORBAX Eclipse XDB-C8 column, (4.6 × 150 mm, 5 μm, Agilent Technologies) eluted with an isocratic mobile phase of 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, 10 mm tetrabutylammonium bromide, 10% CH3CN. The guanosine nucleotides were detected by their absorbance at 254 nm and under these conditions GDP eluted after 5.5 min. Electronic Paramagnetic Resonance—X-band EPR spectra were recorded on a Brucker Instrument EMX spectrometer equipped with an Oxford Instrument ESR 900 flow cryostat. Protein samples were anaerobically reduced with 2 mm sodium dithionite before introduction in the EPR tube and freezing. HYSCORE Spectroscopy—HYSCORE experiments were performed on a Bruker Elexsys E-580 X-band pulsed spectrometer with a Bruker ER4118X dielectric resonator and a continuous flow He cryostat (Oxford Instrument CF935) controlled by an Oxford Instrument temperature controller ITC 503. Experiments were performed at 10 K using the standard 4-pulse sequence (π /2-τ-π /2-t1-π -t2-π /2-echo) with a nominal pulse width of 16 ns for π /2 and π pulses, a τ value of 120 ns, and a pulse repetition rate of 2 kHz. Unwanted echoes were removed by four-step phase cycling. A 128 × 128 data set was recorded with times t1 and t2 incremented in 24 ns steps from an initial value of 200 ns. This data set was processed using Xepr software (Bruker). The background decay in both dimensions was subtracted using a linear fit followed by apodization with a Hamming window and zero-filling to 512 points in each dimension. Then the two-dimensional Fourier transform magnitude spectrum was calculated and presented as a contour plot. Purification of the Recombinant TmHydF Protein—The purification protocol described under “Materials and Methods” resulted in the production of a pure protein that migrates as a single band on a denaturating polyacrylamide gel (data not shown) and that was confirmed as being the TmHydF protein by N-terminal sequencing. The molecular mass was determined by mass spectrometry to be at 45,110 ± 3 Da, in good agreement with the mass calculated from the amino acid sequence (45,091 Da). The protein behaved as a monomer in solution as shown by gel filtration on a calibrated Superdex 200 column (data not shown). The TmHydF Protein Is a GTPase—Primary sequence analysis of the N-terminal domain of HydF proteins from various [Fe-Fe]-hydrogenase-containing microorganisms revealed the presence of several conserved consensus sequences, similar to those involved in guanine nucleotide binding in Small-G proteins (Fig. 2) (30Paduch M. Jelen F. Otlewski J. Acta Biochim. Pol. 2001; 48: 829-850Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 31Leipe D.D. Wolf Y.I. Koonin E.V. Aravind L. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 317: 41-72Crossref Scopus (859) Google Scholar). The first motif is the (G/A)X4GK(T/S) sequence responsible for the binding of α- and β-phosphate groups of the nucleotide (the P loop), which is localized at residues 16–23 in the TmHydF protein. One of the three threonine residues, Thr43, Thr44, or Thr45, might correspond to the conserved threonine residue of the G2 loop involved in Mg2+ binding. The third sequence is DX2G, residues 69–72, which provides the G3 loop involved in the interaction with the γ-phosphate and Mg2+. The G4 loop, (N/T)(K/Q)XD, which is supposed to interact with the nucleotide, is present between residues 123 and 126. Finally, the G5 loop, for recognition of the guanine base, (T/G/C)(C/S)A, is more difficult to find. It could involve residues Val150, Ser151, and Ala152, where the replacement of a threonine residue by a valine could be considered as an isosteric change. GTP binding to the TmHydF protein was demonstrated by fluorescence spectroscopy. Upon excitation at 285 nm, the TmHydF protein displays an intense fluorescence band at 334 nm. Addition of GTP resulted in a quenching of the fluorescence of the protein indicating formation of a complex. The Kd value for the dissociation of the TmHydF protein-GTP complex could thus be determined by titration of the TmHydF protein with increasing concentrations of GTP, monitored by fluorescence spectroscopy. The data were best fit to the standard binding equation assuming one saturation site and allowed the determination of a value of ∼3 μm for Kd (data not shown). GTP hydrolysis was assayed by incubating the as-purified TmHydF protein with an excess of GTP and Mg2+ at pH 8.0. A slow production of GDP (0.03 min–1) was observed as monitored by HPLC (Fig. 3). When the protein was omitted from the reaction mixture, no production of GDP could be detected. Furthermore no ATPase activity could be observed. These data clearly demonstrate that the TmHydF protein is a GTPase, with a rather low activity as observed in the case of many Small-G proteins (30Paduch M. Jelen F. Otlewski J. Acta Biochim. Pol. 2001; 48: 829-850Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). It is important to note that this very weak activity offered the possibility to determine the Kd value for GTP as described above. The TmHydF Protein Is an Iron-Sulfur Protein—Concentration of solutions containing the as-purified protein resulted in the appearance of a light brown color. In addition, analysis of an alignment of HydF protein primary sequences from different [Fe-Fe]-hydrogenase-containing microorganisms showed the complete conservation of three cysteine residues located in the C-terminal region of the protein, Cys302, Cys353, and Cys356 for the TmHydF protein (Fig. 4). Cysteine residues, especially within the CX2C motif, are often observed as ligands of Fe-S clusters. The as-isolated protein was found to contain substoichiometric amounts of iron and sulfur atoms (<0.2 of each atom per equivalent protein). This is possibly due to the loss of the oxygen-sensitive cluster during aerobic purification, as is often observed with Fe-S proteins. Finally, we determined that TmHydF protein could bind up to four iron and four sulfur atoms per polypeptide chain, after anaerobic treatment with an excess of ferrous iron and sulfide and desalting (data not shown). The UV-visible spectrum of the reconstituted TmHydF protein (Fig. 5A) displays a broad absorption band centered around 410 nm, which can be assigned to sulfur-to-iron charge transfer transitions characteristic of a [4Fe-4S] cluster and responsible for the brown color of the protein. The presence of a [4Fe-4S] cluster in the TmHydF protein was further demonstrated by EPR spectroscopic analysis after anaerobic reduction with an excess of dithionite. The EPR spectrum displayed several signals (Fig. 5, B and C). An axial signal is seen in the g = 2 region (g = 2.045, g = 1.904) with microwave power saturation and temperature saturation dependence properties characteristic for a reduced S = 1/2 [4Fe-4S]1+ center (Fig. 5B). Additional resonances were observed around g = 5.2 and g = 1.75, which belong to the broad spectrum of the [4Fe-4S]1+ center in the S = 3/2 spin state (32Flint D.H. Emptage M.H. Finnegan M.G. Fu W. Johnson M.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14732-14742Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 5C). Quantitation of the g = 2 signal (0.1–0.2 spin/protein) revealed that less than 20% of the [4Fe-4S]1+ cluster was in the S = 1/2 reduced state. The amount of reduced cluster in the S = 3/2 state is much more difficult to appreciate considering the broadness of the signal and the difficulty to obtain the zero-fill splitting parameter. However, there is no doubt that there was a significant production of S = 3/2 clusters during anaerobic treatment of the TmHydF protein with dithionite. These results unambiguously show that the TmHydF protein is a [4Fe-4S] cluster-containing protein. So far we cannot find any correlation between the presence of the cluster and the GTPase activity. Reconstituted and as-isolated TmHydF protein preparations have similar GTPase specific activities and furthermore no modification of the EPR spectrum could be observed upon addition of GTP or GDP. An Exchangeable Site at the [4Fe-4S] Cluster of the TmHydF Protein—The EPR spectrum of the TmHydF protein is quite unusual. Not only does it show the presence of both S = 1/2 and S = 3/2 clusters but the high field feature of the S = 1/2 signal is centered at g = 1.904, which is significantly high field-shifted with regard to standard g values for reduced [4Fe-4S] clusters, generally measured at g = 1.94 (33Guigliarelli B. Bertrand P. Adv. Inorg. Chem. 1999; 47: 421-497Crossref Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The observation of a protein-bound [4Fe-4S]1+ cluster presenting a S = 3/2 signal together with low g values for the S = 1/2 signal (g = 2.10, g = 1.87, g = 1.80) has been reported by Adams and co-workers for the ferredoxin from Pyrococcus furiosus (34Conover R.C. Kowal A.T. Fu W. Park J.B. Aono S. Adams M.W. Johnson M.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 8533-8541Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This ferredoxin is one of the rare examples of a spectroscopically well characterized protein with a [4Fe-4S] cluster that has incomplete cysteinyl coordination, with three cysteine ligands and an aspartate as the fourth ligand (34Conover R.C. Kowal A.T. Fu W. Park J.B. Aono S. Adams M.W. Johnson M.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 8533-8541Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This raised the possibility of the presence of a non-cysteinyl ligand at the [4Fe-4S] cluster of the TmHydF protein. To further study the ligands of the cluster, HYSCORE spectroscopy, a two-dimensional pulsed EPR technique, has been used to characterize the reconstituted protein after anaerobic reduction with dithionite. HYSCORE spectroscopy is the method of choice to detect hyperfine coupling of nuclei with low gyromagnetic moments in non-oriented systems. One of the main advantages of HYSCORE is the ability to sort three types of nuclei: the strongly (|a|/2 > νn) and weakly (|a|/2 < νn) coupled ones and the “distant” nuclei characterized by very low hyperfine constants. In the latter case the corresponding peaks lie on the diagonal of the (+,+) quadrant, whereas the strongly and weakly coupled nuclei appear off the diagonal in the (–,+) and (+,+) quadrants, respectively. Moreover, with a strongly coupled I = 1 nucleus such as 14N, it is possible to observe a characteristic pattern in the (–,+) quadrant with so-called double quanta-double quanta (dqdq) correlation features (35Schweiger A. Jeschke G. Principles of Pulse Electron Paramagnetic Resonance. Oxford University Press, Oxford2001Google Scholar, 36Maryasov A.G. Bowman M.K. J. Phys. Chem. B. 2004; 108: 9412-9420Crossref Scopus (17) Google Scholar). They correspond to ΔI = 2 nuclear transitions and are, to the first order, insensitive to orientation broadening. It is possible to obtain a rough estimate of the hyperfine coupling constant a (supposed to be mainly isotropic) and quadrupolar coupling constant K from the frequency position of the dqdq correlation peaks using equation 1 (η being the asymmetry parameter) (37Tyryshkin A.M. Dikanov S.A. Reijerse E.J. Burgard C. Hüttermann J. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1999; 121: 3396-3406Crossref Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Thus, a nitrogen atom ligated to a Fe-S cluster is easily detectable due to the strong coupling of the nuclear spin (I = 1) with the unpaired electron.νdqdq2=4[(νI±a2)2+K2(3+η2)](Eq. 1) The HYSCORE spectrum of the anaerobically reduced protein presented no cross-correlation peaks except those corresponding to distant 13C carbon atoms present in natural abundance and 1H atoms (Fig. 6A), thus excluding a nitrogen atom in the coordination sphere of the cluster. In addition, HYSCORE spectra of the protein in D2O did not show any strongly coupled (exchangeable) 2H nucleus (data not shown) as would have been expected if the fourth ligand was a water molecule. Further experiments are required to identify the fourth ligand. The exchangeability of the fourth ligand was assayed by incubating the reduced protein with 5 mm imidazole. The EPR spectrum of the reaction mixture did not show any significant change. On the other hand, the HYSCORE spectrum was drastically modified (Fig. 6B). The most striking change was the appearance of a complex pattern of peaks in the (–,+) quadrant, characteristic of a strongly coupled nitrogen atom. In particular, it was possible to observe a pair of dqdq correlation peaks at (–2.4, 7.0) and (–7.0, 2.4) MHz, respectively. Using Equation 1, 4.8 MHz was obtained for the hyperfine coupling constant a and 0.53 MHz for the quadrupolar coupling constant K. These values are in the range of those obtained for Rieske proteins, where the Nδ histidine nitrogen is ligated to the [2Fe-2S] cluster (38Dikanov S.A. Xun L. Karpiel A.B. Tyryshkin A.M. Bowman M.K. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1996; 118: 8408-8416Crossref Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 39Samoilova R.I. Kolling D. Uzawa T. Iwasaki T. Crofts A.R. Dikanov S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 4605-4608Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). This suggests that imidazole is N-ligated to the fourth iron of the cluster in a very similar fashion to that observed for the histidine ligand in the Rieske [2Fe-2S] cluster. These results also show that the [4Fe-4S] cluster is solvent accessible, as its fourth ligand is easily exchangeable with imidazole. The results presented here provide the first detailed characterization of the HydF protein, which is involved in the maturation of [Fe-Fe]-hydrogenases. We have clearly established that the TmHydF protein is an iron-sulfur protein carrying a [4Fe-4S] cluster, on the basis of iron and sulfur quantitation, UV-visible and EPR spectroscopy. It is very likely that this cluster is ligated by only three cysteines and that these cysteines are the three conserved ones, Cys302, Cys353, and Cys356, the latter two belonging to a CX2C motif, which is frequently involved in cluster chelation. The presence of a non-cysteinyl ligand is also indicated by the significantly low g value (g = 1.904) in the EPR spectum of the S = 1/2 reduced cluster, as compared with the spectra of clusters with four cysteine ligands. Also, the presence of a significant amount of reduced clusters in the S = 3/2 spin state suggests an unusual coordination. There are few examples of [4Fe-4S] clusters ligated by a protein site different from a cysteine. An interesting one is provided by hydrogenases themselves. The three-dimensional structures of [Fe-Fe]-hydrogenase and [Ni-Fe]-hydrogenase reveal the presence of a [4Fe-4S] cluster coordinated by a histidine residue, through the Nϵ atom in the first case and the Nδ atom in the second case (2, 1). Hydrogenases are difficult to investigate spectroscopically due to the large number of Fe atoms and clusters within the same enzyme, and unfortunately, these histidine-ligated clusters have never been studied in the reduced state and thus nothing is known about their EPR characteristics. The second example is the cluster found in the ferredoxin from P. furiosus (see “Results”), which has a cluster that is ligated by a carboxylate from an aspartate residue (34Conover R.C. Kowal A.T. Fu W. Park J.B. Aono S. Adams M.W. Johnson M.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 8533-8541Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). From the HYSCORE results reported we definitively exclude a nitrogen-based ligand from the protein. Thus an O-coordination provided by the protein would be a possibility. Also, there are several examples of [4Fe-4S] clusters ligated by three cysteines and an exogenous ligand. The most extensively studied of such clusters are those found in aconitase, with the citrate substrate bound to the fourth iron, or in Radical-AdoMet enzymes, with S-adenosylmethionine coordinated to one iron through its aminocarboxyl moiety (40Layer G. Moser J. Heinz D.W. Jahn D. Schubert W.D. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 6214-6224Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar, 41Hanzelmann P. Schindelin H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 12870-12875Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). It is thus also possible that in the purified protein studied here, the fourth coordination site is occupied by a low molecular mass compound, a cofactor or a substrate, not yet identified. Also based on HYSCORE experiments, we exclude the possibility that the fourth ligand is a water molecule (see above). The observation of a cluster-imidazole complex during incubation of the TmHydF protein with an excess of imidazole shows that the fourth site is easily accessible by exogenous ligands and readily exchangeable. This [4Fe-4S]-imidazole complex is an interesting novel species, since it would provide the first opportunity to spectrospically characterize an interaction between a [4Fe-4S] cluster and a nitrogen ligand such as imidazole or histidine, as found in some enzymes such as hydrogenases (see above) and to identify specific signatures for these entities that differentiate them from standard clusters. This is currently under investigation. The second important observation reported here is the ability of the HydF protein to bind GTP (Kd = 3 μm) and to catalyze GTP hydrolysis. This GTPase activity requires Mg2+ and is consistent with the presence, in the N-terminal part of HydF proteins, of several conserved consensus sequences found in Small-G proteins. So far we have been unable to find any interdependency between the presence of the [4Fe-4S] cluster and the GTPase activity. In particular, similar enzyme activities were observed using preparations of the TmHydF protein with different cluster contents. Iron-sulfur proteins with the ability to bind and hydrolyze nucleoside triphosphates (ATP or GTP) are rare. One fascinating example is the bacterial nitrogenase which couples the energy of ATP binding and hydrolysis to electron-transfer reactions (42Rees D.C. Howard J.B. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 2000; 4: 559-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). In this case the Fe protein of nitrogenase (NifH) binds the nucleotide and a single [4Fe-4S] cluster, and the electron transfer from that cluster to the MoFe protein where N2 is reduced is driven by the hydrolysis of two molecules of ATP. Future experiments will aim at finding whether the cluster in HydF proteins has a redox function and whether the latter is controlled by GTP binding and hydrolysis. Finally, an important issue is how the HydF protein participates to the maturation of [Fe-Fe]-hydrogenases. These enzymes harbor a very peculiar active site with CO, CN ligands to the iron atoms as well as a putative di(thiomethyl)amine bridging the two irons (Fig. 1). Furthermore, this di-iron complex shares with an adjacent [4Fe-4S] cluster a sulfur ligand provided by one bridging cysteine. Activation of hydrogenase thus requires synthesis of these components and assembly within the active site. It is too early to identify where the HydF protein participates in this process. However, it is interesting to note that a protein, with GTPase activity and Kd values for GTP comparable with those displayed by the TmHydF protein, is involved in the maturation of [Ni-Fe]-hydrogenase, which also contains a dinuclear metal site (consisting of a Ni atom and an Fe atom with CO and CN ligands). It has been shown that this protein, HypB, participates in the GTP-dependent insertion of the nickel atom into an hydrogenase form only containing the Fe(CO)(CN)2 motif (16Blokesch M. Paschos A. Theodoratou E. Bauer A. Hube M. Huth S. Böck A. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2002; 30: 674-680Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). It is thus tempting to speculate that the HydF protein is also involved in the GTPase-driven insertion of the diiron complex, or part of it or of the [4Fe-4S] cluster to which the diiron complex binds, into the [Fe-Fe]-hydrogenase active site. It seems to be a common theme that a nucleotidase activity is required in metallosite biosynthesis. In addition to the HydF and HypB proteins, one can mention the CooC and UreG proteins, involved in nickel insertion during maturation of carbon monoxide dehydrogenase (43Jeon W.B. Cheng J. Ludden P.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38602-38609Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) and urease (44Moncrief M.B.C Hausinger R.P. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 4081-4086Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), respectively, as well as NifH which also functions in the ATP-dependent insertion of the FeMo-Co into aponitrogenase (45Rangaraj P. Ryle M.J. Lanzilotta W.M. Ludden P.W. Shah V.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19778-19784Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Together with the purification and the characterization of the HydE and HydG proteins that we recently reported (27Rubach J.K. Brazzolotto X. Gaillard J. Fontecave M. FEBS Lett. 2005; 579: 5055-5060Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar), this work on the HydF protein provides a strong basis to design an in vitro system for maturation of [Fe-Fe]-hydrogenases and to understand the mechanism of the assembly of the diiron active site. It is remarkable that this process depends so much on Fe-S clusters, two from HydE, two from HydG, and one from HydF. We thank Prof. R. Huber (Regensburg University, Regensburg, Germany) for the gift of T. maritima genomic DNA and all the members of Dr. Fontecave's laboratory for helpful discussions."
https://openalex.org/W2114254596,"Heat shock transcription factor 1 (HSF1) monitors the structural integrity of intracellular proteins and its regulation is essential for the health and longevity of eukaryotic organisms. HSF1 also plays a role in the acute inflammatory response in the negative regulation of cytokine gene transcription. Here we show, for the first time, that HSF1 is regulated by the proinflammatory protein kinase MAPKAP kinase 2 (MK2). We have shown that MK2 directly phosphorylates HSF1 and inhibits activity by decreasing its ability to bind the heat shock elements (HSE) found in the promoters of target genes encoding the HSP molecular chaperones and cytokine genes. We show that activation of HSF1 to bind HSE in hsp promoters is inhibited through the phosphorylation of a specific residue, serine 121 by MK2. A potential mechanism for MK2-induced HSF1 inactivation is suggested by the findings that phosphorylation of serine 121 enhances HSF1 binding to HSP90, a major repressor of HSF1. Dephosphorylation of serine 121 in cells exposed to non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs leads to HSP90 dissociation from HSF1, which then forms active DNA binding trimers. These experiments indicate a novel mechanism for the regulation of HSF1 by proinflammatory signaling and may permit HSF1 to respond rapidly to extracellular events, permitting optimal physiological regulation. Heat shock transcription factor 1 (HSF1) monitors the structural integrity of intracellular proteins and its regulation is essential for the health and longevity of eukaryotic organisms. HSF1 also plays a role in the acute inflammatory response in the negative regulation of cytokine gene transcription. Here we show, for the first time, that HSF1 is regulated by the proinflammatory protein kinase MAPKAP kinase 2 (MK2).

The hsf1 gene plays an essential role in protection of cells from heat shock by regulating the induction of cytoprotective HSP and in protection against the effects of endotoxins through its ability to repress the transcription of proinflammatory cytokines through inhibition of factors involved in cytokine transcription such as NF-IL6 and NFκB (3Cahill C.M.

Aging is associated with the degeneration of HSP expression with time and the loss of resistance to cellular oxidants; elevated HSF1 leads to significant increase in lifespan in Caenorhabditis elegans (5Gutsmann-Conrad A.

In cancer, the converse situation applies, and malignant transformation is associated with aberrantly high levels of HSP (8Ciocca D.R. Clark G.M. Tandon A.K. Fuqua S.A. Welch W.J. McGuire W.L. J.

These clinical phenomena reflect the role of HSP molecular chaperones in cellular regulation, as either up- or down-regulation of HSP expression can profoundly modulate multiple key proteins within the cell (10Nollen E.A. Morimoto R.I. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 2809-2816Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It is therefore clear that elucidating the molecular mechanisms that control HSP expression in mammalian cells is essential.Under normal conditions, most HSF1 is inactive and maintained in a compacted monomeric form (11Rabindran S.K.

Inactive HSF1 lacks the ability to bind to the heat shock elements (HSE) in hsp promoters, is unable to trans-activate hsp genes and fails to repress the promoters of proinflammatory cytokines (13Zuo J.

Activation of HSF1 is a complex process involving monomer to trimer transition and DNA binding; hyperphosphorylation, and capacity to activate target promoters (12Zuo J. Rungger D. Voellmy R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4319-4330Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar, 17Sarge K.D. Murphy S.P. Morimoto R.I. Mol. Cell.

Trimerization of HSF1 is governed by leucine zipper domains in the amino terminus and is subject to intramolecular negative regulation by a fourth leucine zipper in the carboxyl terminus (15Rabindran S.K. Haroun R.I. Clos J. Wisniewski J. Wu C. Science. 1993; 259: 230-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar). This form of regulation is sufficient to regulate monomer to trimer transition in purified HSF1 in vitro (1Wu C. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1995; 11: 441-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (963) Google Scholar). However, additional levels of regulation exist in the cell. Activation is controlled by HSF1 binding to the molecular chaperone HSP90, and HSP90 binding maintains the monomeric state (13Zuo J. Guo Y. Guettouche T. Smith D. Voellmy R. Cell. 1998; 94: 471-480Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (925) Google Scholar, 20Bharadwaj S. Ali A. Ovsenek N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 8033-8041Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). This form of regulation is also found in other transcription factor families including the nuclear receptors (21Pratt W.B. Galigniana M.D. Harrell J.M. DeFranco D.B. Cell Signal. 2004; 16: 857-872Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). Activation of HSF1 by heat shock causes the release of HSF1 from HSP90 in a process thought to involve the sequestration of HSP90 by denatured proteins (13Zuo J. Guo Y. Guettouche T. Smith D. Voellmy R. Cell. 1998; 94: 471-480Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (925) Google Scholar). The monomer to trimer transition can also be induced by high concentrations of the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) including aspirin, ibuprofen, and sodium salicylate (NaSal) (22Jurvivich D.A. Sistonen L. Kroes R.A. Morimoto R.I. Science. 1992; 255: 1243-1245Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar, 23Housby J.N. Cahill C.M. Chu B. Prevelege R. Bickford K. Stevenson M.A. Calderwood S.K. Cytokine. 1999; 11: 347-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). These compounds derive the majority of their anti-inflammatory activity through inhibition of the cyclooxygenase enzymes (24Brooks P.M. Day R.O. N. Engl. J. Med. 1991; 324: 1716-1725Crossref PubMed Scopus (805) Google Scholar, 25Borne R.F. Foye W.O. Principles of Medicinal Chemistry. Williams & Wilkins, Baltimore1995: 535-580Google Scholar). However, the induction of trimeric HSF1 involves NSAID concentrations 1000-fold greater than are required for inhibition of cyclooxygenase activity (22Jurvivich D.A. Sistonen L. Kroes R.A. Morimoto R.I. Science. 1992; 255: 1243-1245Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar, 23Housby J.N. Cahill C.M. Chu B. Prevelege R. Bickford K. Stevenson M.A. Calderwood S.K. Cytokine. 1999; 11: 347-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). At these concentrations, the NSAIDs are effective inhibitors of protein kinases such as RSK2, ERK, and IKKα (26Palayoor S.T. Youmell M.Y. Calderwood S.K. Coleman C.N. Price B.D. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 7389-7394Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar, 27Stevenson M.A. Zhao M.J. Asea A. Coleman C.N. Calderwood S.K. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 5608-5616PubMed Google Scholar). This led us to propose the hypothesis that HSF1 activation is negatively regulated by a protein kinase that is inhibited by NSAIDs. HSF1 is subject to reciprocal regulation by proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory signals in myeloid cells; whereas proinflammatory lipopolysaccharides (28Kotlyarov A. Neininger A. Schubert C. Eckert R. Birchmeier C. Volk H.D. Gaestel M. Nat Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 94-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (681) Google Scholar) repress HSF1, the NSAIDs activate HSF1 and reverse the effects of lipopolysaccharide (29Soncin F. Calderwood S.K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 229: 479-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Our preliminary studies show that inhibitors of lipopolysaccharide activation of mitogen activated protein kinase-activated protein kinase 2 (MAPKAP kinase 2 or MK2) activate the binding of HSF1 to HSE. Such compounds include tyrosine kinase inhibitors AG126 and herbimycin A, p38 kinase inhibitor SB203580, and NSAIDs sodium salicylate, aspirin, and ibuprofen. 4S. K. Calderwood, unpublished observation. 4S. K. Calderwood, unpublished observation. MK2 is an inducible kinase activated by p38MAPK and through p38 is regulated by cell stress, lipopolysaccharide, and the cytokines IL1β and tumor necrosis factor α (30Rouse J. Cohen P. Trigon S.

MK2 plays an important physiological role in the acute inflammatory response, enhancing the expression of proinflammatory cytokines through mRNA stabilization and increasing expression of inflammatory enzymes including lipoxygenase and phospholipase A (28Kotlyarov A.

Inhibition of HSF1 by MK2, as we suggest here, would be consonant with a role in inflammation, as HSF1 inhibition would relieve the repression on cytokine promoters (3Cahill C.M. Waterman W.R.

We showed that activated MK2 is a potent inhibitor of HSF1 and inhibits HSF1 binding to HSE and trans-activation of the HSP70B promoter. Our studies indicate that MK2 directly phosphorylates HSF1 on a specific serine residue 121 (Ser-121) and that this event may mediate some of the intracellular effects of MK2 on HSF1. Mutation of the Ser-121 residue in HSF1 to alanine prevented the inhibitory effects of MK2. Activation of MK2 led to an increase in HSF1-HSP90 binding, whereas the Ser-121 mutation to alanine prevented the effects of MK2 on HSF1-HSP90 binding and permitted HSF1 association with HSE. As HSP90 binding to HSF1 is known to be involved in the inactivation of HSF1, our data suggest a potential mechanism for HSF1 inhibition by MK2. Our experiments therefore indicate that the protein kinase MK2 is an inhibitor of HSF1 and may exert its effects on the protein by direct phosphorylation.MATERIALS AND METHODSPlasmid Construction and Mutagenesis—The human HSF1 cDNA was amplified and subcloned into the pHM6 (Roche Applied Science) vector to generate pHM6HSF1 wild type (pHA-HSF1 wild type), which was used as a template for site-directed mutagenesis using the QuikChange™ site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) as described previously (38Wang X. Grammatikakis N. Siganou A. Calderwood S.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 6013-6026Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Specific single, double, and triple mutations (pHA-S121A, pHA-S121D, pHA-T120A, pHA-T120AS121A, pHA-S123A, pHA-T124A, pHA-S127A, pHA-T527A, pHA-S529A, pHA-T120A/S121A, pHA-S121A/S123A, pHA-T527A/S529A, pHA-T120A/S121A/S123A, pHA-T120A/S121A/T527A, pHA-T120A/S121A/S529A) were introduced. All constructs and mutants were confirmed by DNA sequencing. pcDNA3-Myc-MK2, MK2 dominant negative mutant pcDNA3-MK2 K59R, HSP70B promoter luciferase reporter construct (pGLHSP70B), pGEX2T-HSF1, and pcDNA3 FLAG-HSF1 were described previously (39Chen C.

Phosphopeptides were isolated on p81 filters (Pierce), washed in ice-cold 75 mm phosphoric acid, and assayed by Cerenkov counting. To detect kinetics of phosphorylation of GST-HSF1 by MK2, fusion protein GST-HSF1 was purified from bacterial lysates as described (4Xie Y. Zhong R. Chen C. Calderwood S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 4687-4698Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), in vitro kinase assays were performed with 5 μg of GST-HSF1 in a 30-μl volume of reaction buffer with 0.2 units of MK2 as described above at 30 °C for 0, 1, 2, 4, and 6 h, and stopped by addition of SDS sample buffer then analyzed by 10% SDS-PAGE and x-ray film autoradiography.Mass Spectrometric Matrix-assisted Laser Desorption/Ionization Time-of-Flight (MALDI-TOF) Analysis of Tryptic Peptides—In vitro phosphorylation of GST-HSF1 by MK2 was carried out for 4 h as described above with radioisotope and then analyzed by 10% SDS-PAGE. The silver-stained GST-HSF1 bands were cut out and in-gel digested with sequencing grade-modified trypsin (Promega), followed by reverse phase HPLC purification and concentration step as described previously (41Shevchenko A. Wilm M. Vorm O. Mann M. Anal. Chem. 1996; 68: 850-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (7767) Google Scholar). The 32P activity of each fraction was detected using scintillation counting. Molecular masses of 32P-labeled HPLC fractions from tryptic peptides were analyzed by a MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry (Voyager DESTR).Cell Culture and Transfection—HeLa cells were maintained in Ham's F-12 (Mediatech) with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum. Mouse embryonic fibroblasts (mk2+/+) (28Kotlyarov A. Neininger A. Schubert C. Eckert R. Birchmeier C. Volk H.D. Gaestel M. Nat Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 94-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (681) Google Scholar) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 100 μg of streptomycin/ml (complete medium). HeLa cells (2.5 × 105 cells/well) in 6-well plates were transfected with the plasmids indicated in the figure legends in triplicate using FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science) as described (42Wang X.Z. Asea A. Xie Y. Kabingu E. Stevenson M.A. Calderwood S.K. Cell Stress Chaperones. 2000; 5: 432-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). pSV-β-galactosidase plasmid was co-transfected as an internal control for transfection efficiency. pHM6 empty vector was used as a blank plasmid to balance the amount of DNA transfected in transient transfection. Luciferase and β-galactosidase activity assays were performed after 24 h of transfection according to the Promega protocol. Luciferase activity was normalized to β-galactosidase activity. Results were expressed as relative luciferase activity of the appropriate control.Western Analysis—Cells were lysed, the protein concentration was quantified in the cell lysates by DC protein assay (Bio-Rad), and samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE. Western analysis was performed as described (43Stevenson M.A. Calderwood S.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 1234-1238Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). The following antibodies were used: anti-HSF1 monoclonal antibody (Stressgen), anti-HSP90 monoclonal antibody (Stressgen), anti-MK2 polyclonal antibody (Upstate), anti-phospho-MK2 (Thr-334) polyclonal antibody (Cell Signaling), and anti-HA.11 monoclonal antibody (Covance).Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay (EMSA)—Nuclear extracts were incubated with a double-stranded, 32P-labeled consensus HSE from human HSP70B promoter probe, and analyzed by EMSA as described (38Wang X. Grammatikakis N. Siganou A. Calderwood S.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 6013-6026Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar).Gel Filtration—Whole cell extracts (2 mg) were applied to a 24-ml Superdex 200 HR 10/30 column (Pharmacia) equilibrated with 20 mm Tris-HCl at pH 7.5, 0.5 m NaCl, 10% glycerol, and 1 mm dithiothreitol. Fractions (1-ml column) were collected and analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by Western blot analysis. The calibration was performed using thyroglobulin (669 kDa), ferritin (440 kDa), catalase (232 kDa), adolase (158 kDa), albumin (67 kDa), ovalbumin (43 kDa), and chymotrypsinogen A (25 kDa) as protein standards.Co-immunoprecipitation—HeLa cells (1.2 × 106 cells) were transfected with the plasmids indicated in figure legends using FuGENE 6 as described (38Wang X. Grammatikakis N. Siganou A. Calderwood S.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 6013-6026Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). After 24 h of transfection, cells were either untreated or treated with 20 mm NaSal in HEPES buffer, pH 6.8, for 30 min at 37 °C or heat-shocked at 43 °C for 30 min. Cells were then harvested and lysed using immunoprecipitation buffer ((20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate and 10 mm NaF)). Immunoprecipitation was performed as described (38Wang X. Grammatikakis N. Siganou A. Calderwood S.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 6013-6026Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) using anti-HA (Y-11) polyclonal antibody (Santa Cruz), followed by analysis with 10% SDS-PAGE and immunoblot analysis.Generation of Antibodies Specific for HSF1-Phosphoserine-121—Antibodies were prepared against HSF1-phosphoserine-121 using the phosphopeptide AcRKVT (pS) VSTC-amide (R7C) that spans the Ser-121 site. Phosphopeptide was coupled to bovine serum albumen and injected into rabbits with three subsequent boosting injections. Peptides and antiserum were prepared commercially by BIOSOURCE International. Anti-HSF1-phosphoserine 121 antibody (Ser(P)-121 Ab) was then cleared by passage through an affinity column coupled to unphosphorylated peptide R7C and purified by affinity chromatography on phospho-R7C-agarose.RESULTSMK2 Inhibits the Ability of HSF1 to Activate the HSP70B Promoter and Reduces HSF1 Binding to DNA—We first examined the effects of MK2 activation on the ability of intracellular HA-HSF1 to activate the HSP70B promoter. Overexpression of HA-HSF1 led to the activation of heat shock promoter (HSP70B) activity and such HSF1 activation of the HSP70B promoter activity was inhibited by 50–60% when cells were co-transfected with pMyc-MK2 (Fig. 1A). We next examined potential mechanisms underlying the regulation of HSF1 activity by MK2. Our hypothesis predicts that MK2 may be an inhibitor of the first step in HSF1 activation, which involves the release of HSF1 from inhibitory complexes and the formation of HSE-binding HSF1 trimers (11Rabindran S.K. Gioorgi G. Clos J. Wu C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 6906-6910Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar, 12Zuo J. Rungger D. Voellmy R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4319-4330Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). We tested this hypothesis by examining the effects of Myc-MK2 overexpression on the binding of HSF1 in nuclear extracts to HSEs using EMSA (Fig. 1B). HSF1-HSE binding was assayed in cells transfected with HA-HSF1, as this permitted us to distinguish the transfected HSF1 from endogenous HSF1. Overexpression of HA-HSF1 increased binding to HSE (Fig. 1B, lane 4), and HSF1-HSE complexes could be identified by supershift assay with anti-HA antibody (Fig. 1B, lane 5). Previous studies have shown that expression of HSF1 from exogenous promoters can lead to the trimerization and DNA binding of HSF1 in the absence of stress (12Zuo J. Rungger D. Voellmy R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4319-4330Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). This may be because of the titration of endogenous inhibitors of trimerization or to the increase in HSF1 concentration facilitating the kinetically rare event of trimer formation. The electrophoretic mobility of the HA-HSF1-HSE complexes derived from the transfected cells was similar to the mobility of such complexes extracted from heat-shocked cells (used here as a control) (Fig. 1B, lanes 1 and 2). The rate of migration of the HA-HSF1-HSE complexes in the gels was further retarded by anti-HA antibody binding (Fig. 1B, lane 5) migrating at a similar rate to HSF1-HSE complexes from heat-shocked cells bound to anti-HSF1 antibody (Fig. 1B, lane 2). Overexpression of Myc-MK2 strongly inhibited HA-HSF1 binding to HSE whether incubated without or with anti-HA antibody (Fig. 1B, lanes 6 and 7). We also examined the physical association of overexpressed Myc-MK2 with HA-HSF1. Myc-MK2 overexpression led to its activation as indicated by phosphorylation on threonine 334 (data not shown). Such active, overexpressed Myc-MK2 became bound to HA-HSF1 and was recovered in anti-HA immunoprecipitates and detected by immunoblot assay with antibodies specific for the Myc tag (total Myc-MK2) or phospho-MK2 (Thr(P)-334; Thr-334-phosphorylated Myc-MK2) (Fig. 1C). NaSal appeared to reduce Thr(P)-334 levels. The reason for this is not clear, although in similar studies carried out on RSK2, NaSal reduced RSK2 autophosphorylation by unknown mechanisms (27Stevenson M.A. Zhao M.J. Asea A. Coleman C.N. Calderwood S.K. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 5608-5616PubMed Google Scholar). In control cells in which HA-HSF1 was not transfected, we did not observe phospho-MK2 in the HA immunoprecipitates (Fig. 1C).MK2 Directly Phosphorylates HSF1—We next examined the hypothesis that HSF1 is a direct substrate for phosphorylation by MK2 and that this phosphorylation may mediate the inhibitory effects of MK2 (Fig. 2A). When a purified GST-HSF1 fusion protein was incubated with MK2 in vitro, we observed 32P-incorporation into GST-HSF1 in a time-dependent manner that reached a maximum by 4 h. We estimated incorporation at this point at ∼1.3 mol of orthophosphate/mol of GST-HSF1 (Fig. 2A). However as the peptide mapping analysis shown later indicates phosphorylation of GST-HSF1 is at at least 6 sites, phosphorylation of individual serines/threonines is likely to be substoichiometric. We next investigated whether this interaction could be inhibited by NaSal. We incubated GST-HSF1 with purified MK2 and determined the effect of incubation with 20 mm NaSal on 32P incorporation. This concentration of NaSal inhibited 32P incorporation by ∼50% (Fig. 2B, compare lane 2 with 3). We next examined in more detail whether MK2 activity is inhibited by the doses of NaSal that activate the binding of HSF1 to the hsp promoters in vivo (22Jurvivich D.A. Sistonen L. Kroes R.A.

Biochem. J. 1993; 296: 843-849Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). The experiments indicate that MK2 activity is inhibited in a dose-dependent manner, with ∼50% inhibition at a concentration of 20 mm, the concentration that inhibits HSF1 phosphorylation (Fig. 2, B and C) and activates the binding of HSF1 to HSE in vivo (22Jurvivich D.A.

We hypothesized that sPLA2 will hydrolyze red blood cells that expose phosphatidylserine (PS) and generate lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) from phosphatidic acid that is elevated in PS-exposing red blood cells. In turn, LPA, a powerful lipid mediator, could affect vascular endothelial cell function. Although normal red blood cells were not affected by sPLA2, at levels of sPLA2 observed under inflammatory conditions (100 ng/ml) PS-exposing red blood cells hemolyzed and generated LPA (1.2 nm/108 RBC). When endothelial cell monolayers were incubated in vitro with LPA, a loss of confluence was noted. Moreover, a dose-dependent increase in hydraulic conductivity was identified in rat mesenteric venules in vivo with 5 μm LPA, and the combination of PS-exposing red blood cells with PLA2 caused a similar increase in permeability. In the presence of N-palmitoyl l-serine phosphoric acid, a competitive inhibitor for the endothelial LPA receptor, loss of confluence in vitro and the hydraulic permeability caused by 5 μm LPA in vivo were abolished. The present study demonstrates that increased sPLA2 activity in inflammation in the presence of cells that have lost their membrane phospholipid asymmetry can lead to LPA-mediated endothelial dysfunction and loss of vascular integrity.

The enzyme generates arachidonic acid from phospholipids for the generation of thromboxanes and leukotrienes and, as such, acts as an essential mediator in the inflammatory pathways (1Fourcade O.

The specific membranes targeted by the enzyme for the generation of arachidonic acid during inflammation have not been clearly defined. Secretory PLA2 has a strong preference for phospholipids that are negatively charged at physiologic pH: phosphatidylserine (PS) and phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) (2le Balle F. Simon M.F. Meijer S. Fourcade O. Chap H. Adv. Enzyme Regul. 1999; 39: 275-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). In normal mammalian cells, these phospholipids are mainly (PE) or exclusively (PS) confined to the inner layer of the plasma membrane (1Fourcade O. Simon M.F. Viode C. Rugani N. Leballe F. Ragab A.

Loss of this asymmetric distribution and exposure of PS on the external surface generates a thrombogenic surface and signals macrophages to remove cells by phagocytosis (1Fourcade O. Simon M.F.

Although normal mammalian cells do not seem to act as targets for sPLA2, loss of phospholipid asymmetry in plasma membranes and the exposure of PS have been shown to render them vulnerable to phospholipid hydrolysis (1Fourcade O.

In addition, it has been well established that bacterial membranes are excellent substrates for this enzyme (6Wright G.W. Ooi C.E. Weiss J. Elsbach P. J. Biol.

We have previously shown that sPLA2 is elevated after injury, predicts hypoxemia, and is related to multiorgan failure (7Neidlinger N.A. Hirvela E.R. Skinner R.A. Larkin S.K. Harken A.H. Kuypers F.A.

Although tissue damage under these conditions is clearly related to sPLA2 levels, the cellular targets and mechanisms by which sPLA2 incites injury remain elusive. We have reported that under conditions that lead to PS exposure in red blood cells, an intracellular phospholipase D is activated that generates phosphatidic acid (PA) by hydrolysis of phosphatidylcholine (12Butikofer P. Yee M.C. Schott M.A. Lubin B.H. Kuypers F.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 213: 367-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). We hypothesized that the interaction between sPLA2 and PS-exposing red blood cells could result in lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) generation from PA present at elevated levels in these cells. LPA is an important lipid mediator with a number of physiologic effects, including platelet aggregation, smooth muscle contraction, vasoactive changes, cytoskeletal reorganization, and stimulation of cell proliferation (2le Balle F.

Concentration of LPA in human serum has been measured in ranges from 0.6–10 μm. Although healthy individuals show LPA levels consistently below 1 μm, higher levels of LPA are observed in diseases such as ovarian cancer and sickle cell disease (18Eder A.M. Sasagawa T. Mao M.

FEBS Lett. 1997; 410: 54-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). It was indicated that LPA is produced in platelets when they are activated by thrombin (26Mauco G. Chap H. Simon M.F. Douste-Blazy L. Biochimie (Paris). 1978; 60: 653-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar); however, the amount of LPA produced in this manner only accounts for a small part of the LPA in serum (25Gaits F. Fourcade O. Le Balle F. Gueguen G. Gaige B. Gassama-Diagne A. Fauvel J. Salles J.P. Mauco G. Simon M.F. Chap H. FEBS Lett. 1997; 410: 54-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Multiple phospholipases are thought to be involved in LPA production, including sPLA2, phosphatidylserine-specific phospholipase A1, and lechitin-cholesterol acyltransferase (23Aoki J. Taira A.

It is also suggested that lysophosphatidylcholine generated from PLA2 can be hydrolyzed by lysophospholipase D into LPA (23Aoki J. Taira A. Takanezawa Y. Kishi Y. Hama K. Kishimoto T. Mizuno K.

If so, this could affect endothelial cell monolayer and vascular integrity. To test this hypothesis, we determined whether PS-exposing red blood cells are susceptible to sPLA2 and whether sPLA2 activity leads to the formation of LPA. We identified the impact of PS-exposing red blood cells and LPA on endothelial cell monolayer integrity in vitro and examined the effect of LPA on venular hydraulic conductivity in vivo. All chemicals were the highest grade available and were purchased from Sigma unless otherwise specified. PS-exposing Red Blood Cells and sPLA2—With approval of the Institutional Review Board, human venous blood from healthy consenting volunteers was drawn in EDTA anticoagulant tubes. Blood was spun at 1000 × g, the plasma and buffy coat were removed, and the erythrocytes were washed three times in Hepes-buffered saline. Subsequently, a portion of red blood cells was incubated with 10 μm oligomycin A and 100 μm CaCl2 in Hepes-buffered saline for 3 min at 37 °C to initiate phospholipid scrambling. Calcium Ionophore A23187 was added to a final concentration of 4 μm, and the cells were further incubated for 10 min at 37 °C. Subsequently, 2 mm EDTA was added. To confirm that the membrane exposed PS, cells were incubated with fluorescently labeled Annexin V and analyzed by flow cytometry (FACS Calibur; BD Biosciences) as described before (27Kuypers F.A. Lewis R.A. Hua M. Schott M.A. Discher D. Ernst J.D. Lubin B.H. Blood. 1996; 87: 1179-1187Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). PS-exposing red blood cells at 109 cells/ml or an equal volume of control erythrocytes were incubated with 100 ng/ml of type IIa human sPLA2 (Cayman Chemical, Ann Arbor MI) for 1 h at 37° C in Hepes-buffered saline with 2mm calcium. Hemolysis was measured by determination of hemoglobin in the supernatant of the red blood cell suspension after centrifugation at 4000 × g. The absorbance at 410 nm in the supernatant was compared with the absorbance of a hemolyzed aliquot of the same red blood cell suspension in water in a Spectra Max 340 spectrophotometer (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale CA). In addition, red cell integrity was determined by a simple cell count of the total number of intact cells in the red cell suspension by flow cytometry. PS exposure after sPLA2 treatment was measured by flow cytometry as described above. LPA Assay—To analyze the presence of LPA in the red cell suspensions, lipids were extracted according to Rose and Oaklander (28Rose G. Oaklander M. J. Lipid Res. 1965; 6: 428-431Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and LPA in the lipid extracts were measured by radioenzymatic assay as described previously (21Saulnier-Blache J.S. Girard A. Simon M.F. Lafontan M. Valet P. J. Lipid Res. 2000; 41: 1947-1951Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with few modifications. In this assay lysophosphatidic acid acyl transferase (LPAAT) is used to reacylate LPA to 14C-labeled PA with 14C-labeled palmitoyl-CoA. LPAAT was produced in plasmid-transformed Escherichia coli, a generous gift from Jean Sebastian Saulnier-Blanche (Paris, France). E. coli were grown under routine conditions in Luria-Bertani medium and disrupted with an M-110S air-powered microfluidizer pump (Microfluidics International Corp., Newton MA). The resulting membrane preparations were recovered by centrifugation of the supernatant for 90 min at 100,000 × g, and the protein concentration was determined using the Bradford protein assay (29Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar) and Coomassie reagent (Pierce Biotechnology). Standard solutions of LPA (Na+ salt of 1-palmitoyl-2-hydroxy-sn-glycero-3-phosphate; Avanti Polar Lipids, Alabaster, AL) were prepared in chloroform/methanol (2:1, v:v). LPA concentrations in the standard solutions were determined by phosphate analysis (30Bartlett G.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1959; 234: 466-468Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Both standard LPA solutions and cellular lipid extracts were incubated in 200 μl of reaction medium (7.4 μm [14C]palmitoyl-CoA) (specific radioactivity 60μCi/μmol; PerkinElmer Life Sciences), 20 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 0.25 mg/ml lysophosphatidic acid acyl transferase, 20 μm sodium orthovanadate, and 136 μlofH20 containing 1.5 mg/ml Tween 20) for 20 min. After adding 400 μl of CHCl3-methanol-12 M HCl (40:40:0.26, v:v) to stop the reaction, the lower CHCl3 phase was evaporated under nitrogen and resuspended in CHCl3. Subsequently, lipids were extracted according to Bligh and Dyer (31Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (43132) Google Scholar) and separated by thin layer chromatography (TLC) on Analtech silica gel plates in an acidic TLC solvent (100 ml of CHCl3, 50 ml of MeOH,16 ml of acetic acid, 5 ml of 0.9% NaCl) to separate [14C]PA from [14C]palmitic acid and [14C]palmitoyl-CoA. Quantification of radioactivity in the separated lipid spots on TLC utilized a Storm 840 Phosphor-Imager (Amersham Biosciences) with digital image analysis using ImageQuant software (Molecular Dynamics). It was determined that this method rendered virtually identical results as compared with scintillation counting after scraping of the TLC plate (r2 = 0.98). We tested the required incubation time for PA formation from LPA and found that under our conditions PA formation from LPA was complete after 20 min of incubation. Endothelial Cell Cultures—Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) were harvested from umbilical cords obtained from Alta Bates Hospital according to Institutional Review Board-approved protocols. HUVEC were grown on 2% gelatin in endothelial growth medium (Biowhittaker, Walkersville MD) and were maintained at 37 °C in 5% CO2 in 24-well plates. Confluence and morphology of the mono-layers were determined by light microscopy. After 3–6 days of culture, each well was aspirated and washed with endothelial growth medium to remove any detached cells. LPA or lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC) standards were prepared in chloroform/methanol (2:1, v:v). Aliquots of these lysophospholipids were evaporated under a stream of nitrogen and resuspended in endothelial growth medium. HUVEC monolayers were exposed to endothelial growth medium containing various concentrations of either LPA or LPC for 90 min at 37 °C. Following exposure to LPA or LPC, detached HUVEC in the supernatant were identified and counted by flow cytometry. Mouse anti-vascular cell adhesion molecule and phycoerythrin-labeled goat anti-mouse IgG secondary antibody were used to identify intact HUVEC. To quantify the percentage of HUVEC detachment in the experimental groups, complete detachment of HUVEC was induced by incubation with detaching buffer (10 mm NaPO4, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm NaHCO3, 10 mm EDTA, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) (32Wu G. Essex D.W. Meloni F.J. Takafuta T. Fujimura K. Konkle B.A. Shapiro S.S. Blood. 1997; 90: 2660-2669Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In Vivo Hydraulic Permeability—All studies were approved and complied with institutional animal research protocols. The methods and preparations have been described in detail previously (33Curry F.E. Huxley V.H. Sarelius I.H. Linden R.T. Cardiovascular Physiology: Techniques in the Life Sciences. P309. Elsevier, New York1983: 1-34Google Scholar) and are discussed in brief here. Adult female Sprague-Dawley rats (Hilltop Lab Animals Inc., Scottsdale, PA) were anesthetized with sodium pentobarbital (60 mg/kg). The small bowel mesentery was exposed and positioned over a quartz pillar for examination on an inverted microscope (Diaphot; Nikon, Melville, NY). Red blood cell markers were obtained from adult female Golden Syrian hamsters (Harlan, Indianapolis, IN). Perfusates consisted of Ringer's solution (135 mm NaCl, 4.6 mm KCl, 2.0 mm CaCl2, 2.46 mm MgSO4, 5.0 mm NaHCO3, 5.5 mm dextrose, 9.03 mm Hepes salt, 11.04 mm Hepes acid), 1% bovine serum albumin, red blood cell markers, and test mediators LPA and the LPA receptor antagonist, N-palmitoyl l-serine phosphoric acid (l-NASPA; Biomol Research, Plymouth Meeting, PA). Single vessel hydraulic permeability (Lp) was determined using the modified Landis microcannulation technique (34Michel C.C. Mason J.C. Curry F.E. Tooke J.E. Hunter P.J. Q. J. Exp. Physiol. Cogn. Med. Sci. 1974; 59: 283-309PubMed Google Scholar). The assumptions and limitations of this model have been previously described (33Curry F.E. Huxley V.H. Sarelius I.H. Linden R.T. Cardiovascular Physiology: Techniques in the Life Sciences. P309. Elsevier, New York1983: 1-34Google Scholar). Initial cell velocity (dl/dt) was obtained by recording marker cell position as a function of time. Transmural water flux per unit area (Jv/S) was calculated by the equation Jv/S = (dl/dt)(r/2l), where r is the vessel radius and l is the initial distance between the marker red blood cell and the placement of the vessel occluder. Determination of hydraulic permeability (Lp) was based on the equation of fluid filtration: Lp = (Jv/S)(1/Pc). In this equation, Pc represents hydrostatic pressure and Lp was calculated from the slope of the regression Jv/S on Pc, derived from three different occlusion measurements at fixed perfusion pressures. Control studies documenting the stability of the model over time and after repeat cannulations have been previously reported (35Victorino G.P. Newton C.R. Curran B. J. Surg. Res. 2002; 104: 77-81Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). In each experiment, venules were cannulated and perfused with 1% bovine serum albumin/Ringer's solution for 10 min and baseline Lp was measured. To evaluate the effect of PLA2 and PS-exposing RBC on hydraulic conductivity, we measured the hydraulic permeability induced by 2 × 108 PS-exposing RBC in the presence or absence of 100 ng of pancreatic PLA2 in 1 ml of 1% bovine serum albumin/Ringer's perfusate. In vitro experiments indicated that the combination of this amount of PS-exposing RBC and PLA2 could produce 3 μm LPA, a concentration comparable with the conditions in which exogenously LPA was added. For the in vivo study we used porcine pancreatic PLA2 rather than human secretory PLA2 because it is more readily available to be used in the concentrations needed. Moreover, our in vitro studies show that pancreatic PLA2 had similar effects on PS-exposing RBC as sPLA2. To evaluate the effect of LPA, venules were perfused with clinically relevant concentrations of 1 and 5 μm LPA (16Goetzl E.J. An S. FASEB J. 1998; 12: 1589-1598Crossref PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar). Measurements of Lp were taken at 2- and then at 5-min intervals to 20 min with continuous LPA perfusion (n = 5). To examine the effect of the inhibitor l-NASPA on Lp, venules were first perfused with l-NASPA (20 μm) and Lp measured at 5 and 15 min. Next, venules were perfused simultaneously with LPA (5 μm) and l-NASPA (20 μm) and Lp measured at 2 min and then every 5 min to a total of 20 min (n = 6). Statistics—Comparisons of means were made with Student's t-test. Group means of sequential measurements in permeability measurements were analyzed with repeated measures of analysis of variance with post hoc analysis. Statistical significance was set at an α error of 5%. All values for Lp are represented as mean ± S.E. × 10–7 cm·s–1·cmH2O–1. Hydrolysis of Normal and PS-exposing Red Blood Cells by sPLA2—To show that PS-exposing red blood cells would be a target for sPLA2 we incubated both normal and PS-exposing erythrocytes with different concentrations of purified sPLA2. Although sPLA2 was virtually unable to act on normal erythrocytes, it hemolyzed erythrocytes that exposed PS in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1). The concentrations of sPLA2 that hydrolyzed PS-exposing red blood cells are similar to sPLA2 concentrations reported in sera of trauma and septic patients (7Neidlinger N.A. Hirvela E.R. Skinner R.A.

Blood. 1996; 87: 2573-2578Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Flow cytometric analysis confirmed the loss of PS-exposing cells after sPLA2 incubation. Fig. 2 depicts a typical flow cytometry histogram of PS-exposing cells before and after incubation with varying doses of sPLA2. As the dose of sPLA2 increases, the remaining erythrocyte population after 1 h decreases. In addition, Annexin V fluorescence decreases with increasing sPLA2 concentration, suggesting that the remaining cells after sPLA2 exposure do not expose PS. As shown in Fig. 3, hemolysis of PS-exposing red blood cells increased with time when these cells were exposed to 100 ng/ml of sPLA2. Similarly, as hemolysis increases, the percentage of PS-exposing cells remaining decreases as measured by flow cytometry. This inverse relationship confirms that sPLA2 targets red blood cells that expose PS. Similar results were found when PS-exposing RBC were incubated with porcine pancreatic PLA2 (not shown).FIGURE 2sPLA2 targets PS-exposing erythrocytes. PS-exposing red blood cells bind fluorescently labeled Annexin V (dashed outline). After 1 h with sPLA2 at 2–500 ng/ml, flow cytometry was used to identify the number (counts) and membrane configuration (fluorescence of Alexa Annexin) of the remaining cells as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Histograms of cell populations exposed to 2 ng/ml (solid outline), 50 ng/ml (solid gray), and 500 ng/ml (solid black) of sPLA2 are depicted. As doses of sPLA2 increase, the number of cells remaining decreases and the remaining cells are less likely to bind Alexa Annexin. After 500 ng/ml of sPLA2 (black histogram), virtually no intact RBC remain.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)FIGURE 3PS-exposing red blood cells are targeted and lysed by sPLA2 in a time-dependent manner.

Yee M.C. Schott M.A. Lubin B.H. Kuypers F.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 213: 367-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). When cells are incubated under conditions that increase their intracellular calcium, phosphatidylcholine is hydrolyzed and PA is formed (12Butikofer P. Yee M.C. Schott M.A. Lubin B.H. Kuypers F.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 213: 367-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). We hypothesized that if PS-exposing red blood cells are hydrolyzed by sPLA2, this could result in LPA formation by hydrolysis of PA. We measured LPA formation in erythrocytes by the formation of 14C-labeled PA after incubation of the red blood cell lipid extract with radiolabeled palmitoyl-CoA and LPA-acyltransferase as described above. Virtually no increase in LPA formation was found in PS-exposing red blood cells as compared with normal red blood cells in the absence of sPLA2 (3.5 ± 1.2 versus 3.2 ± 1.5 nmol/1010 cells LPA, mean ± S.E., p = 0.9). Normal erythrocytes that were exposed to 100 ng/ml of sPLA2 showed no significant change in LPA concentration (5.8 ± 1.8 nmol/1010 cells LPA, p = 0.3). In contrast, a dramatic increase in LPA formation was observed when PS-exposing cells were exposed to 100 ng/ml of sPLA2 (122.4 ± 21.8 nmol/1010 cells LPA, p <0.001) (Fig. 4). When PS-exposing red blood cells were incubated with 100 ng/ml of sPLA2 in the absence of calcium in the buffer, no LPA was generated, indicating that sPLA2 needs to be catalytically active. Similar results were found when PS-exposing RBC were incubated with porcine pancreatic PLA2 (not shown). Effects of LPA on Endothelial Monolayers in Vitro and Vascular Integrity in Vivo—LPA was reported to be implicated in the inflammatory response of endothelial cells (17Graler M.H. Goetzl E.J.

Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) 5The abbreviations used are: HCMV, human cytomegalovirus; HIV, human immunodeficiency virus; HSV, herpes simplex virus; NHDF, normal human dermal fibroblast; GFP, green fluorescent protein; CMV, cytomegalovirus; VSV, vesicular stomatitis virus; gB, glycoprotein B; gH, glycoprotein H. is a widespread pathogen, with infection found from isolated aboriginal societies to the industrialized world. HCMV, a human herpesvirus, is responsible for significant morbidity and mortality, predominately in immunocompromised hosts. HCMV is the leading viral cause of birth defects, occurring in as many as 3% of all live births (1Alford C.A. Hayes K. Britt W. J. Infect. Dis. 1988; 158: 917-924Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 2Adler S.P. Prog. Med. Virol. 1990; 37: 136-155PubMed Google Scholar). The consequences of these infections include blindness, deafness, mental retardation, and death. HCMV is also a major cause of disease in organ transplant patients and a contributor to graft loss. Cancer patients frequently experience HCMV disease as many anticancer therapies compromise the immune response, thereby allowing viral reactivation. It is now becoming apparent that HCMV infection is a cofactor for diseases associated with uncontrolled cellular proliferation such as cardiovascular disease and gastrointestinal cancer (3Cobbs C.S.

Dis. 1992; 15: 609-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Current HCMV antiviral drugs primarily target DNA replication, and these drugs have widely recognized limitations as human therapeutic agents (e.g. toxicity). Because herpesviruses establish a lifelong latent infection, antiviral therapies aimed at prevention of virus entry represent an attractive alternative target for drug development. The anti-AIDS drug Fuzeon acts by blocking HIV entry (6Wild C.T. Shugars D.C. Greenwell T.K. McDanal C.B. Matthews T.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 9770-9774Crossref PubMed Scopus (888) Google Scholar), establishing the clinical viability of this therapeutic approach. However, differences between the HIV entry mechanism and the herpesvirus entry mechanism(s) indicate that the design strategy developed for HIV cannot be directly extrapolated to HCMV and related pathogens. Herpesviruses employ multiple proteins to induce fusion between the viral envelope and the target cell membrane; in contrast, RNA viruses such as orthomyxoviruses, paramyxoviruses, filoviruses, and retroviruses use a single glycoprotein for membrane fusion (7Spear P.G. Cell Microbiol. 2004; 6: 401-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar). Reconstitution experiments from a number of laboratories suggest that initial recognition of target cells by herpesviruses involves a receptor-binding viral protein, which varies from virus to virus, and that fusion is then orchestrated by conserved glycoproteins gB and the gH/gL heterodimer (7Spear P.G. Cell Microbiol. 2004; 6: 401-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar, 8Milne R.S. Hanna S.L. Rux A.H. Willis S.H. Cohen G.H. Eisenberg R.J. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 8962-8972Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Little is known at present about the molecular mechanism by which multiple herpesvirus glycoproteins induce membrane fusion. In contrast, considerable information is available on the molecular aspects of class I viral entry mechanisms (e.g. the HIV entry mechanism). Extensive structural analysis of class I fusion proteins has revealed conserved paradigms involving α-helical coiled-coil interactions, as in HIV protein gp41 (9Earp L.J. Delos S.E. Park H.E. White J.M. Curr. Top Microbiol. Immunol. 2005; 285: 25-66PubMed Google Scholar). The α-helical coiled-coil is a very common mode of helix association in proteins, observed in both tertiary structure (intramolecular) and quaternary structure (intermolecular) contexts (10Lupas A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 375-382Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1008) Google Scholar). Protein segments competent for such interactions display a characteristic seven-residue pattern, the “heptad repeat,” in which hydrophobic side chains occur at the first and fourth positions. The entry machinery of viruses that employ type I fusion proteins relies upon both inter- and intramolecular coiled-coil interactions. These viral fusion proteins are typically organized into a homotrimer via associations mediated by a heptad repeat segment found near the membrane-spanning domain. A second heptad repeat is located distal to the membrane and near a hydrophobic sequence that inserts into the target cell membrane. When such fusion proteins are triggered, the heptad repeat segments fold back upon themselves forming a six-helix bundle. The resulting hairpin structure brings the viral and target cell membranes together. The free energy released upon formation of the six-helix bundle is thought to provide a driving force for membrane fusion (11Weissenhorn W. Dessen A. Calder L.J. Harrison S.C. Skehel J.J. Wiley D.C. Mol. Membr. Biol. 1999; 16: 3-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). Synthetic peptides corresponding to the C-terminal heptad repeat segment of HIV fusion protein gp41 are very potent inhibitors of viral entry (6Wild C.T. Shugars D.C. Greenwell T.K. McDanal C.B. Matthews T.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 9770-9774Crossref PubMed Scopus (888) Google Scholar, 12Chan D.C. Chutkowski C.T. Kim P.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 15613-15617Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar); Fuzeon is a 36-residue residue segment of gp41 (13Kilby J.M. Hopkins S. Venetta T.M. DiMassimo B. Cloud G.A. Lee J.Y.

Lopper and Compton (14Lopper M. Compton T. J. Virol. 2004; 78: 8333-8341Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) have identified a region in gB and a region in gH with the heptad repeat pattern characteristic of α-helical coiled-coils, and they speculated that coiled-coil interactions might play a role in the HCMV fusion mechanism. Peptides corresponding to these regions blocked HCMV entry and infection (14Lopper M. Compton T. J. Virol. 2004; 78: 8333-8341Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), although with low potency. The inhibitory effects were observed for a variety of clinical and laboratory HCMV strains, but the HCMV-based peptides had no effect on infection by mouse CMV or herpes simplex virus (HSV), the glycoprotein heptad repeat sequences of which differ from those of HCMV. This selectivity suggests that the peptides act by forming specific contacts with proteins on the HCMV surface and thereby block coiled-coil interactions required for viral entry. The importance of heptad repeats in the gH protein was recently demonstrated also for HSV. Mirroring the HCMV findings, peptides encompassing a predicted coiled-coil sequence blocked HSV infection (15Gianni T. Martelli P.L. Casadio R. Campadelli-Fiume G. J. Virol. 2005; 79: 2931-2940Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 16Gianni T. Menotti L. Campadelli-Fiume G. J. Virol. 2005; 79: 7042-7049Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), albeit weakly. The identification of coiled-coil segments within herpesvirus proteins required for target cell entry raises the prospect that blocking coiled-coil formation could inhibit infection by these viruses. However, the poor inhibitory activity of peptides containing these coiled-coil sequences shows that the relatively straightforward design strategy underlying the development of Fuzeon as an anti-AIDS drug will not be successful for herpesviruses. We have therefore begun to explore an alternative and unprecedented strategy for disrupting coiled-coil interactions in the hope of identifying a viable approach for blocking herpesvirus entry. Our strategy employs “foldamers,” oligomers that are built up from unnatural subunits and that display discrete folding patterns (17Gellman S.H. Acc. Chem. Res. 1998; 31: 173Crossref Scopus (2366) Google Scholar, 18Cheng R.P. Gellman S.H. DeGrado W.F. Chem. Rev. 2001; 101: 3219-3232Crossref PubMed Scopus (1734) Google Scholar, 19Hill D.J. Mio M.J. Prince R.B. Hughes T.S. Moore J.S. Chem. Rev. 2001; 101: 3893-4012Crossref PubMed Scopus (2205) Google Scholar). Coiled-coil formation and other protein-protein interactions bury large molecular surfaces, and such interactions have proven difficult to inhibit via small molecule-based approaches (20Arkin M.R. Well J.A. Nat. Rev. Drug Disc. 2004; 3: 301-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (1404) Google Scholar). The predictability of the shapes adopted by foldamers, and the ability to vary foldamer size in an incremental manner, make this family of molecules attractive for development of protein-protein interaction antagonists. Here, we describe the development of β-amino acid oligomers (“β-peptides”) that block HCMV entry. We use a specific β-peptide secondary structure, the 12-helix (21Appella D.H. Christianson L.A. Klein D.A. Powell D.R. Huang X. Barchi J.J. Gellman S.H. Nature. 1997; 387: 381-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (589) Google Scholar) (defined by 12-membered ring C=O(i) → H-N(i+3) hydrogen bonds), to mimic putative α-helical segments within the HCMV gB glycoprotein (the α-helix is defined by C=O(i) → H-N(i+4) hydrogen bonds). High resolution structural data for 12-helical β-peptides (21Appella D.H. Christianson L.A. Klein D.A. Powell D.R. Huang X. Barchi J.J. Gellman S.H. Nature. 1997; 387: 381-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (589) Google Scholar, 22Lee H.-S. Syud F.A. Wang X. Gellman S.H. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2001; 123: 7721-7722Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) suggest that this unnatural secondary structure is a good mimic of the α-helix in terms of overall shape. Three features of β-peptides make them attractive with regard to biomedical applications. First, their oligomeric nature makes combinatorial design straightforward. Second, they can be engineered to display very high conformational stability (18Cheng R.P. Gellman S.H. DeGrado W.F. Chem. Rev. 2001; 101: 3219-3232Crossref PubMed Scopus (1734) Google Scholar, 22Lee H.-S. Syud F.A. Wang X. Gellman S.H. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2001; 123: 7721-7722Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), which should minimize the entropic cost of binding to a target. Third, they are resistant to proteolytic degradation (23Frackenpohl J. Arvidsson P.I. Schreiber J.V. Seebach D. Chem. Bio. Chem. 2001; 2: 445-455Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The first feature is shared by conventional peptides, i.e. those composed of α-amino acids, but the other two features constitute advantages for β-peptides relative to conventional peptides. Helix-forming β-peptides have been shown to mimic the prokaryote-specific membrane disruption effects of α-helical host-defense peptides (24Hamuro Y. Schneider J.P. DeGrado W.F. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1999; 121: 12200-12201Crossref Scopus (398) Google Scholar, 25Porter E.A. Wang X. Lee H.-S. Weisblum B. Gellman S.H. Nature. 2000; 404: 565Crossref PubMed Scopus (634) Google Scholar, 26Liu D.H. DeGrado W.F. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2001; 123: 7553-7559Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar), and β-peptides with various folding propensities have been shown to interact with proteins or nucleic acids in biochemical assays (27Werder M. Hauser H. Abele S. Seebach D. Helv. Chim. Acta. 1999; 82: 1774Crossref Scopus (214) Google Scholar, 28Gademann K. Ernst M. Hoyer D. Seebach D. Angew. Chem. Int.

Soc. 2004; 126: 9468-9469Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). In all of these prior examples, the β-peptide is less active than the α-peptide to which it is compared. In contrast, we have identified a β-peptide inhibitor of HCMV entry that is more active than the gB-derived α-peptide we intend to mimic. Further, our findings constitute the first evidence for target-specific β-peptide activity in a cellular context. β-Peptide Synthesis—β-Peptides were prepared by standard manual Fmoc (N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl) solid-phase methods. (See supplemental material for details.) Cell Lines, Viruses, and Antibodies—Normal human dermal fibroblasts (NHDFs) and NIH3T3 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 1% l-glutamine, and 1% penicillin-streptomycin. The AD169 strain of HCMV was propagated in NHDFs and purified as previously described (31Compton T. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 3644-3648Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).

Monoclonal antibody against the major tegument phosphoprotein pp65 was purchased from the Rumbaugh-Goodwin Institute for Cancer Research, Inc. Alexa Fluor® 488 goat anti-mouse secondary antibody was purchased from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). The 27-78 antibody against glycoprotein B (gB) was a kind gift from William Britt (35Schoppel K. Hassfurther E. Britt W. Ohlin M. Borrebaeck C.A. Mach M. Virology. 1996; 216: 133-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The use of polyclonal 6824 antibody against glycoprotein H (gH) was previously described (36Huber M.T. Compton T. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 3886-3892Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The goat anti-mouse (horseradish peroxidase-linked) and goat anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase secondary antibodies were purchased from Pierce. Virus Entry Assay—Lyophilized β-peptides were dissolved in filter-sterilized de-ionized H2O. The concentration of individual β-peptides and α-peptides was calculated based on absorbance (275 nm) measured with DU®530 spectrophotometer (Beckman, Fullerton, CA). Extinction coefficients were calculated based on information available on the Oregon Medical Laser center web site (omlc.ogi.edu/spectra/Photochem-CAD/html/alpha.html). A precipitate formed upon addition of some β-peptide stock solutions to cell culture medium while others (e.g. 19) did not lead to precipitate formation. Because only some inactive and active β-peptides displayed precipitation, we concluded that this phenomenon is not related to HCMV entry inhibition. Cells were grown in 12-well plates and infected with the indicated virus (multiplicity of infection of 0.5 plaque forming units/cell). Controls for HCMV-GFP and MCMV-EGFP entry were prepared by pretreating virions with heparin (30 μg/ml) as described previously (37Compton T. Nowlin D.M. Cooper N.R. Virology. 1993; 193: 834-841Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). To inhibit VSV infection, cells were treated with 30 mm NH4Cl. For flow cytometric detection of GFP expression, cells were recovered by trypsinization and centrifugation and suspended in phosphate-buffered saline and mixed with propidium iodide (Molecular Probes Inc.) as an indicator of cell viability. The samples were analyzed on a FACScan flow cytometer (BD Biosciences) with a standard filter set. The cells were gated for propidium iodide exclusion (live cells) and assayed for GFP content. The data were analyzed using FlowJo (version 6.1, Tree Star Inc., Ashland, OR). Inhibition data were normalized to percent control infection. Active β-peptides were synthesized independently several times; distinct samples displayed similar activities. For the HSV-1 entry assay, a confluent monolayer of NHDFs cells was grown in a 96-well plate and infected with HSV-1(KOS)gL86 as described above. At 6 h post infection, the cells were lysed in buffer (100 mm NaH2PO4, 10 mm KCl, 1 mm MgSO4, 0.1% Nonidet P-40). O-Nitrophenyl-β-d-galactopyranoside was added to 2.3 mg/ml, and the mixture was incubated at 25 °C for 6 h. Then absorbance at 420 nm was measured using SpectraMAX® 190 spectrophotometer (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA). The assay was set up in quadruplicate and performed three times. The peptide inhibition data were normalized to the level of control infection. pp65 Translocation Assay—NHDF cells were grown on glass cover-slips in 12-well plates as above. The HCMV was diluted with 100 μm β-peptide in SF-Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and cooled to 4 °C. The treatment was then added to cooled cells, which were incubated at 4 °C for 90 min, assuring viral attachment but not entry. The cells were then transferred to 37 °C for 35 min. The cells were then fixed in 3% paraformaldehyde and immunostained for pp65 as described (14Lopper M. Compton T. J. Virol. 2004; 78: 8333-8341Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Images were taken on the Nikon Eclipse TE2000-S with appropriate filters, using consistent exposure times. β-Peptide Inhibitor Design and Evaluation—Our β-peptide design effort focused on mimicry of the heptad repeat region previously identified in HCMV gB. No high resolution structural data are available for gB; therefore, we relied upon an idealized α-helical model for the segment to be mimicked. We envisioned a 12-helical β-peptide inhibitor that would display along one face a set of side chains matching those thought to contribute to interhelical interactions of the gB protein, i.e. the nonpolar side chains in gB that have the characteristic coiled-coil spacing (Leu-679, Ile-682, Phe-686, Tyr-689, and Val-693) (14Lopper M. Compton T. J. Virol. 2004; 78: 8333-8341Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Formation of the 12-helix requires β-amino acid residues with a five-membered ring constraint, such as trans-aminocyclopentane carboxylic acid and trans-3-aminopyrrolidine-4-carboxylic acid (Fig. 1A) (18Cheng R.P. Gellman S.H. DeGrado W.F. Chem. Rev. 2001; 101: 3219-3232Crossref PubMed Scopus (1734) Google Scholar, 38LePlae P.R. Fisk J.D. Porter E.A. Weisblum B. Gellman S.H. J. Am. Chem.

Soc. 2003; 125: 8539-8545Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Placing side chains at specific positions along a 12-helix is most straight-forward via acyclic residues that bear a substituent adjacent to the nitrogen atom (β3-residues) or adjacent to the carbonyl carbon (β2-residues), but these flexible residues diminish 12-helix propensity (38LePlae P.R. Fisk J.D. Porter E.A. Weisblum B. Gellman S.H. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2002; 124: 6820-6821Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 39Park J.-S. Lee H.-S. Lai J.R. Kim B.M. Gellman S.H. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2003; 125: 8539-8545Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Therefore, our designs contain a minimum number of acyclic residues. The trans-3-aminopyrrolidine-4-carboxylic acid residues confer not only conformational stability but also water-solubility via the positive charge that develops upon protonation of the ring nitrogen. We used a comparative α-helical/12 helical net analysis to design an initial set of compounds (Fig. 1B). The α-helical net is a flat projection of the α-helix that illustrates the spatial relationship among side chain attachment points along the peptide backbone in an α-helical conformation (40Crick F.H.C. Acta. Crystallogr. 1953; 6: 689-697Crossref Google Scholar). Analysis of a heptad repeat sequence reveals a continuous stripe of nonpolar side chains along one side of the α-helix; these side chains occupy the first and fourth positions of each heptad repeat. The 12-helix has ∼2.5 residues per turn (18Cheng R.P. Gellman S.H. DeGrado W.F. Chem. Rev. 2001; 101: 3219-3232Crossref PubMed Scopus (1734) Google Scholar), and 12-helical net analysis suggests that a stripe of hydrophobic side chains would be created by repeating pentads in which the first and third residues bear nonpolar side chains. Such a 12-helix should display a hydrophobic surface mimicking that of an α-helical heptad repeat segment, which could lead to an inhibition of biomolecular processes that require coiled-coil interactions. Overlaying the α-helical and 12-helical nets predicted that a β-peptide of 13 residues would mimic the heptad repeat segment of gB. This overlay identified side-chain positions within a 12-helical β-peptide that would most closely approximate the set of five key gB side chains as projected from an α-helix. There are two possible side-chain attachment points in a β-amino acid residue (β2 versus β3; Fig. 1A), an element of variability that does not exist among α-peptides. The helical net overlay clearly predicted the sequence positions for side-chain installation along the β-peptide, but this overlay did not allow distinction among several alternative β2/β3 patterns. Empirical tests were used to resolve this issue. We prepared an initial set of isomeric β-peptides that differed from one another in β2 versus β3 attachment of side chains intended to mimic Leu-679 and Tyr-689 (supplemental Fig. S6). Four of the side chains on these β-peptides match perfectly the corresponding gB side chains; synthetic constraints required the use of β2-homoleucine rather than β2-homoisoleucine at the position intended to mimic Ile-682 of gB. These compounds were evaluated for inhibition of HCMV entry in a cell-based infectivity assay. A single compound (1, Fig. 1C) that blocked HCMV infection was identified (Fig. 2). HCMV (multiplicity of infection = 0.5 plaque forming units/cell) incubated in the absence of inhibitors resulted in 60% total infected fibroblasts. In the presence of 500 μm 1, the proportion of infected cells was reduced to 20%. No evidence of toxicity could be detected at this high concentration of 1. More detailed analysis revealed an IC50 of ∼300 μm for inhibition of HCMV infection by 1 (data not shown). Control experiments were conducted to test the structural hypothesis underlying our β-peptide design. Replacement of large nonpolar side chains with a methyl group, by substituting β2- or β3-homoalanine at those positions, led to a substantial reduction of anti-HCMV activity. For example, no inhibition of HCMV infection was detected for β-peptide 2 (Fig. 2); this finding suggests that the hydrophobic side chains of 1 are critical for activity. We also investigated a sequence isomer of 1 (1-scr), in which the residues are scrambled. In the 12-helical conformation, 1-scr does not display the five side chains in a manner that mimics the putative α-helical display of gB. β-Peptide 1-scr proved to be highly toxic toward fibroblasts, in contrast to 1, which precluded the examination of 1-scr as a potential negative control compound. The origin of this toxicity is unclear; experiments with human red blood cells (supplemental Fig. S7) indicate that 1-scr does not simply disrupt cell membranes. A set of twenty-one second-generation β-peptides was prepared, including fifteen compounds with a single β3-residue change relative to 1 and six compounds with two β3-residue changes (Table 1). Several of these new compounds were significantly more active than 1. The trends indicate that large, aromatic chains at position 2 or at both positions 2 and 7 enhance fusion inhibition, whereas, curiously, placement of such side chains at position 7 alone or position 12 alone leads to fibroblast toxicity. Three of these β-peptides were selected for further analysis (Fig. 3A). Dose-response experiments demonstrated that the most active β-peptide inhibitor, 19, had an IC50 of ∼30 μm in the infectivity assay, a 10-fold improvement over the activity of 1 (Fig. 3B). At 100 μm, β-peptide 19 allows only ∼10% infection; in stark contrast, the α-peptide segments derived from gB are inactive at 100 μm (Fig. 3C).TABLE 1Normalized inhibition data for second-generation β-peptides The collective inhibition data illustrate the effect of side-chain substitutions at peptide positions 2, 7, and 12 on HCMV entry.

Data in other figures are presented as percent control infection Open table in a new tab Specificity of β-Peptide Inhibitors—Our β-peptide design is aimed at mimicry of the heptad repeat segment of the HCMV gB protein, a region that is invariant in over 50 clinical and laboratory strains of HCMV. The corresponding segments within glycoproteins of other herpesviruses, on the other hand, have different heptad repeat sequences (14Lopper M. Compton T. J. Virol. 2004; 78: 8333-8341Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). We tested our design hypothesis by assessing the ability of β-peptides 1, 3, 15, and 19 to block infection by two other herpesviruses, including the closely related MCMV and a more distantly related herpesvirus, HSV. The β-peptides active against HCMV display no detectable inhibitory activity against these viruses (Fig. 4). In addition, we observed no activity against an unrelated virus, VSV (supplemental Fig. S8). The high viral selectivity of the β-peptides suggests that inhibition of HCMV entry results from a very specific interaction between these foldamers and a component of the HCMV particle and supports the feasibility of a structurally tailored design strategy to achieve viral specificity. β-Peptide Inhibitors Target Membrane Fusion—The infectivity assays used in the experiments described above measure immediate early gene expression; IE proteins are the first viral proteins expressed in infected cells. Inhibition of viral gene expression could reflect interference at a variety of points in the virus life cycle such as inhibition of IE gene transcription or translation. We performed a virion content delivery assay to test whether our β-peptides act at the viral entry stage, as they have been designed to do. Immediately upon membrane fusion, the phosphoprotein-rich tegument layer of the virus is released into the cytoplasm of the target cell. The pp65 protein, highly abundant in the virion tegument, diffuses rapidly to the nucleus after membrane fusion. Thus, nuclear localization of pp65 can be used to assess membrane fusion activity and rule out alternative mechanisms of β-peptide action. As in the infectivity assays, exposure of fibroblasts to soluble heparin serves as a positive control for viral entry inhibition: this treatment eliminates pp65 accumulation in the nucleus (Fig. 5). Similarly, the most potent β-peptide inhibitor, 19, blocked nuclear localization of pp65, whereas inactive β-peptides 1 and 3 had no effect on pp65 uptake. This observation indicates that the active β-peptides inhibit HCMV infection at the level of virus-cell membrane fusion. Our results suggest that β-peptides inhibit HCMV entry into target cells by interacting with viral fusion machinery. We propose that this inhibitory effect arises from the adoption by the β-peptides of a folded conformation, the 12-helix, which generates a specific side-chain arrangement that allows recognition of at least one target protein. Two-dimensional NMR data (supplemental Fig. S9) for 1 indicate a substantial 12-helical propensity. Our working hypothesis to explain HCMV fusion inhibition is based on the assumption that entry requires the gB protein, on the virion surface, to be initially triggered to adopt a fusion-active conformation by interaction with cellular receptors. We further assume that the heptad repeat segment of gB is exposed in the fusion-active conformation and that this segment must associate with the heptad repeat segments of other fusion-active gB protein molecules and/or with the heptad repeat segment of gH in order for fusion of the viral envelope with the cell membrane to proceed. We propose that the β-peptide binds to the heptad repeat segment of gB or gH in the fusion-active conformation, blocking homo- and/or hetero-protein-protein associations required for fusion. Because no structural information is yet available for gB or other HCMV glycoproteins, the β-peptide inhibitors we have developed may be useful research tools for further elucidation of the fusion mechanism. The apparent success of our structure-based design strategy raises the prospect that β-peptides and other foldamers (17Gellman S.H. Acc. Chem.

Soc. 2004; 126: 6848-6849Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar) will provide a general and powerful platform for the development of new antiviral agents. Evaluation of a relatively small number of 13-residue β-peptides allowed us to identify HCMV entry inhibitors that are substantially more potent than much longer gB-derived α-peptides. The β-peptides have the further advantage, relative to α-peptide inhibitors, of resistance to proteolytic degradation (23Frackenpohl J. Arvidsson P.I. Schreiber J.V. Seebach D. Chem. Bio. Chem. 2001; 2: 445-455Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Now that we have provided evidence for the feasibility of foldamer-based inhibition of HCMV entry, it will be important to explore additional 12-helical β-peptides and gB heptad repeat mimics based on alternative helical foldamer backbones (41Schmitt M.A. Weisblum B. Gellman S.H. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2004; 126: 6848-6849Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar) in an effort to achieve enhanced potency. The significance of our foldamer-based approach for generating inhibitors of HCMV fusion is highlighted by the very poor inhibitory activity observed for α-peptides derived from HCMV proteins gB and gH. In stark contrast, gp41-derived peptides show sufficient potency in blocking HIV entry to allow direct clinical application (Fuzeon). The inadequacy of α-peptide inhibitors of HCMV and HSV entry suggests that a more sophisticated strategy will be required for development of fusion inhibitors effective against herpesviruses and other refractory pathogenic viruses. The ready application of combinatorial synthesis methods to β-peptides (42Murray J.K. Farooqi B. Sadowsky J.D. Scalf M. Freund W.A. Smith L.M. Chen J. Gellman S.H. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2005; 127: 13271-13280Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) and other foldamers should facilitate the discovery of new antiviral agents.

Pin2/TRF1 negatively regulates telomere length and also plays a critical role in cell cycle checkpoint control. Pin2/TRF1 is down-regulated in many human cancers and may be degraded by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway, but components of the pathway involved in Pin2/TRF1 turnover have not been elucidated. By using the two-hybrid system, we recently identified Pin2/TRF1-interacting proteins, PinX1–4, and we demonstrated that PinX1 is a conserved telomerase inhibitor and a putative tumor suppressor. Here we report the characterization of PinX3. PinX3 was later found to be identical to Fbx4, a member of the F-box family of proteins, which function as substrate-specific adaptors of Cul1-based ubiquitin ligases. Fbx4 interacts with both Pin2 and TRF1 isoforms and promotes their ubiquitination in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, overexpression of Fbx4 reduces endogenous Pin2/TRF1 protein levels and causes progressive telomere elongation in human cells. In contrast, inhibition of Fbx4 by RNA interference stabilizes Pin2/TRF1 and promotes telomere shortening, thereby impairing cell growth. These results demonstrate that Fbx4 is a central regulator of Pin2/TRF1 protein abundance and that alterations in the stability of Pin2/TRF1 can have a dramatic impact on telomere length.

Telomeres are maintained by a network of telomeric factors, including telomerase, TRF1/Pin2, TRF2, tankyrases, TIN2, RAP1, PinX1, POT1, and PTOP/PIP1/TINT1 (1Blackburn E.H.

For example, overexpression of TRF1 results in a gradual telomere shortening, whereas overexpression of dominant-negative mutants leads to telomere elongation in human cells (10van Steensel B. de Lange T.

These results indicate that TRF1 negatively regulates telomere elongation and also suggests that Pin2/TRF1 function is tightly regulated. Consistent with this idea, the ability of TRF1 to bind telomeres has been shown to be modulated by tankyrases (11Smith S. Giriat I. Schmitt A. de Lange T. Science. 1998; 282: 1484-1487Crossref PubMed Scopus (905) Google Scholar, 16Smith S. de Lange T. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 1299-1302Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). Furthermore, TRF1 has been shown to be degraded via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway (17Chang W. Dynek J.N. Smith S. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 1328-1333Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). However, the mechanisms controlling TRF1 degradation and the significance of this pathway for telomere maintenance are unknown. Previously, we isolated a telomere-binding protein Pin2 as a protein that interacts with the mitotic protein kinase NIMA (18Lu K.P. Hanes S.D. Hunter T. Nature. 1996; 380: 544-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (804) Google Scholar, 19Lu K.P. Prog. Cell Cycle Res. 2000; 4: 83-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Pin2 is identical to TRF1, with the exception of a 20-amino acid internal deletion, but is expressed at 5–10-fold higher levels than TRF1 in various cells examined (20Shen M. Haggblom C. Vogt M. Hunter T. Lu K.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 13618-13623Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Pin2 and TRF1 appear to be generated by alternative splicing, as they are likely generated from the same gene (PIN2/TRF1) (21Young A.C. Chavez M. Giambernardi T.A. Mattern V. McGill J.R. Harris J.M.

In addition to the central role of Pin2/TRF1 in telomere maintenance, we have also demonstrated a role for Pin2/TRF1 in mitotic regulation (18Lu K.P. Hanes S.D. Hunter T. Nature. 1996; 380: 544-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (804) Google Scholar). Pin2/TRF1 protein levels are tightly regulated during the cell cycle, and their overexpression induces mitotic entry and apoptosis (20Shen M. Haggblom C. Vogt M. Hunter T. Lu K.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 13618-13623Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 24Kishi S. Wulf G. Nakamura M. Lu K.P. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 1497-1508Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Furthermore, this apoptosis promoting activity is enhanced by disruption of the mitotic spindle checkpoint but is suppressed by ATM 3The abbreviations used are: ATMataxia telangiectasia mutatedTRFtelomere restriction fragmentRNAiRNA interferenceGSTglutathione S-transferasePDpopulation doublingsHAhemagglutininGFPgreen fluorescent proteinE1ubiquitin-activating enzymeE2ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme. through phosphorylation of Pin2/TRF1 (24Kishi S.

In fact, inhibition of endogenous Pin2/TRF1 function in ATM-negative cells is able to restore telomere shortening and mitotic checkpoint defects in response to DNA damage (26Kishi S. Zhou X.Z.

Thus, ATM-mediated phosphorylation of Pin2/TRF1 appears to be critical for the ability of ATM to control telomere maintenance in response to DNA damage. Moreover, Pin2/TRF1 is found on the mitotic spindle during mitosis and contributes to the maintenance of the mitotic spindle checkpoint (25Nakamura M. Zhou X.Z. Kishi S. Kosugi I. Tsutsui Y. Lu K.P.

PinX1 is a highly conserved protein that directly interacts with and potently inhibits telomerase activity in vitro and in vivo and also forces cancer cells into crisis. In contrast, depletion of the endogenous PinX1 protein significantly increases telomerase activity and tumorigenicity of human cancer cells (23Zhou X.Z. Lu K.P. Cell. 2001; 107: 347-359Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). These results indicate that PinX1 is a potent telomerase inhibitor (23Zhou X.Z. Lu K.P. Cell. 2001; 107: 347-359Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). PinX1 can also bind to the telomerase RNA component, and its telomerase inhibitory activity is conserved in budding yeast (30Lin J. Blackburn E.H. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 387-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). In this study, we report the characterization of PinX3 was later found to be identical to Fbx4, a member of the F-box family of proteins (31Jin J. Cardozo T. Lovering R.C. Elledge S.J. Pagano M.

Cul1 assembles with the RING finger protein Rbx1 via its C terminus and with a specificity module composed of Skp1 and an F-box protein through its N terminus. Rbx1 recruits E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes, whereas F-box proteins recruit substrates via C-terminal protein interaction domains. Fbx4 interacts with both Pin2 and TRF1 isoforms in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, Fbx4 promotes ubiquitination of both Pin2 and TRF1 isoforms in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, overexpression of Fbx4 promotes degradation of endogenous Pin2/TRF1 and results in progressive telomere elongation in human cells, whereas inhibition of Fbx4 by RNA interference (RNAi) stabilizes endogenous Pin2/TRF1 levels and leads to telomere shortening and impaired cell growth. These findings indicate that Fbx4 targets Pin2/TRF1 for ubiquitin-mediated degradation, and this post-translational regulation is critical for proper control of telomere length. Expression and Purification of Recombinant Proteins and Production of Fbx4 Antibodies—GST-Pin2 proteins were produced and purified as described previously (20Shen M. Haggblom C. Vogt M. Hunter T.

Briefly, relevant proteins were expressed in HeLa or HT1080 cells by transient transfection or were translated in vitro by using the coupled transcription/translation TnT kit (Promega) in the presence of [35S]Met, followed by lysis or dilution in a buffer containing 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 100 mm NaF, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 50 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 mm dithiothreitol. The cellular supernatants were incubated with 1 μm GST or GST fusion proteins for 1 h at 4 °C, and 15 μl of glutathione-agarose beads were then added, followed by further incubation for 2 h at 4 °C. The precipitated proteins were washed four times in the same buffer and subjected to immunoblotting analysis. In Figs. 1 and 2, the samples labeled input were typically 25–40% of the samples employed in binding experiments.FIGURE 2The identification of the domains in Pin2 and Fbx4 required for their interaction.

Briefly, Pin2 or TRF1 was translated in vitro using the coupled transcription/translation TnT kit in the presence of [35S]Met. 35S-Pin2 protein (2.5 μl) was incubated with ubiquitin-activating enzyme (E1) (50 ng), UbcH5a (200 ng), ubiquitin (1 mg/ml), 1 μm ubiquitin aldehyde, 2.3 μlof in vitro translated Fbx4 or Fbx4ΔF, and 4 mm ATP in a total volume of 10 μl (60 min, 30 °C). To investigate the polyubiquitination of Pin2 in vivo, we co-transfected HA-Pin2 and His-tagged ubiquitin into HeLa cells, followed by MG-132 treatment to inhibit proteasome function. Cell lysates were collected and subjected to the pulldown analysis with nickel-agarose beads to isolate His-tagged ubiquitin conjugates using a urea-containing buffer to remove any Pin2-associating proteins, followed by immunoblotting analysis with anti-Pin2 antibodies. For protein degradation assays, cells were transfected stably or transiently with expression constructs, as indicated. Cycloheximide (100 μg/ml) was added to the media to block new protein synthesis. Cells were harvested at each time points, and total lysates were analyzed by immunoblotting analysis with anti-Pin2/TRF1 or -HA antibodies. The immunoblots were scanned and semi-quantitated by using the software NIH image 1.6.2, as described previously (39Ryo A. Suizu F. Yoshida Y. Perrem K. Liou Y.C. Wulf G. Rottapel R. Yamaoka S.

The results of three independent experiments were plotted such that protein levels at the 0-h time point were defined as 100%. Establishment of Stable HT1080 Cell Lines and Telomere Length Analysis—Stable HT1080 cell lines were established, and telomere length was determined as described previously (23Zhou X.Z. Lu K.P. Cell. 2001; 107: 347-359Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). Briefly, an HA-Fbx4 cDNA was subcloned into an expression vector and then transfected into fibrosarcoma cell line HT1080, along with the empty vector as a control. Two different Fbx4 RNAi constructs (CCGATTGATGTACAGCTATAT and CAACATAAATTCAACATTCTA) and control viral vector pSM2C were purchased from Open Biosystem (41Paddison P.J. Silva J.M. Conklin D.S. Schlabach M. Li M. Aruleba S. Balija V. O'Shaughnessy A. Gnoj L. Scobie K. Chang K. Westbrook T. Cleary M. Sachidanandam R. McCombie W.R. Elledge S.J. Hannon G.J. Nature. 2004; 428: 427-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (603) Google Scholar). For virus production, pSM2C plasmids were transfected into Pheonix packaging cells, and viral supernatants were harvested 48 h after transfection. After selection with antibiotics and limiting dilution, multiple independent single clones were isolated and checked for protein expression by immunoblotting analysis with anti-HA or anti-Fbx4 antibodies. We maintained the stable cell lines continuously in culture, splitting on every 4th day and seeding at the concentration of 6 × 105 cells per 10-cm culture dish. Multiple independent stable clones were established from each transfection, and they expressed the expected proteins and exhibited similar properties. Fbx4 Interacts with Pin2 and TRF1 Isoforms in Vitro and in Vivo—In our original yeast two-hybrid screen for Pin2-interacting proteins (23Zhou X.Z. Lu K.P. Cell. 2001; 107: 347-359Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar), three positive clones contained PINX3 (Pin2-interacting protein X3 gene). The longest clone encodes a 387-amino acid polypeptide that was found to be identical to Fbx4. cDNAs encoding this F-box protein were independently identified by virtue of the presence of an F-box motif located near the N terminus of the protein (42Winston J.T.

Fbx4 has been shown recently to bind to αB-crystallin, a nuclear speckle protein, and Fbx4 overexpression appears to increase ubiquitination of as yet unidentified cellular proteins (44den Engelsman J.

Quinlan R.A. Exp. Cell Res. 2003; 287: 249-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), but to date, specific Fbx4 targets have not been identified. To confirm the apparent interaction between Fbx4 and Pin2, we performed co-immunoprecipitation experiments. HeLa cells were co-transfected with HA-Pin2 and Xpress-Fbx4 expression constructs, and cell extracts were then subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-HA 12CA5 antibody or nonspecific anti-GFP monoclonal antibody, followed by immunoblotting analysis with an anti-Xpress monoclonal antibody. Fbx4 was detected in anti-Pin2 immunoprecipitates but not in control immunoprecipitates (Fig. 1A). Co-immunoprecipitation of Fbx4 and Pin2 was not because of cross-reactivity of Fbx4 with the 12CA5 antibody, because Fbx4 was not present in immunoprecipitation reactions performed with this antibody on extracts that lacked HA-Pin2 or in immunoprecipitation reactions using anti-GFP control antibodies (Fig. 1A). To confirm these results, HeLa cells were transfected with HA-Fbx4 and then subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-HA or anti-GFP control antibodies, followed by immunoblotting analysis with anti-Pin2/TRF1 antibodies that recognized both Pin2 and TRF1 isoforms at approximately a 10:1 ratio, as shown previously (20Shen M. Haggblom C. Vogt M. Hunter T. Lu K.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 13618-13623Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). More importantly, both endogenous Pin2 and TRF1 isoforms were immunoprecipitated by anti-HA antibodies (Fig. 1B). These results indicate that expressed Fbx4 forms stable complexes with endogenous Pin2/TRF1 in cells. To confirm further the interactions between endogenous Pin2/TRF1 and Fbx4 in cells, we raised polyclonal antibodies against recombinant glutathione S-transferase (GST)-Fbx4-C-terminal fragment fusion protein. Affinity-purified immune sera, but not pre-immune control antibodies, recognized an endogenous Fbx4 as well as ectopically expressed HA protein with the expected molecular weight in HeLa and various other cells (Fig. 1C, data not shown), indicating that these antibodies are specific. By using these anti-Fbx4 antibodies, we found that endogenous Fbx4 was immunoprecipitated with anti-Pin2/TRF1 antibodies but not the preimmune controls (Fig. 1C). These results indicate that endogenous Fbx4 and Pin2/TRF1 interact in mammalian cells. To examine the in vitro interaction between Fbx4 and Pin2 or TRF1, we used the GST pulldown approach, as described previously (23Zhou X.Z. Lu K.P. Cell. 2001; 107: 347-359Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). 35S-Labeled Fbx4, -Pin2, or -TRF1 was synthesized by using an in vitro transcription and translation system (TnT) and tested for their ability to bind to GST-Pin2 or GST-Fbx4 that was immobilized on glutathioneagarose beads. GST-Fbx4, but not GST, bound to in vitro synthesized 35S-Pin2 or -TRF1 (Fig. 1D). Conversely, Fbx4 was retained by GST-Pin2 but not by GST (Fig. 1E). These results indicate that Fbx4 interacts with both Pin2 and TRF1 isoforms in vitro. To map the domains in Pin2 and Fbx4 that are important for their interaction, a series of Fbx4 (Fig. 2A) and Pin2 (Fig. 2C) mutants were generated and used in the in vitro binding assay. GST-Pin2 bound to Fbx4 fragments, including amino acid residues 172–306, but did not associate with fragments containing amino acid residues 1–117, 118–171, or 307–387 (Fig. 2B). Furthermore, a deletion of the F-box from Fbx4 (Fbx4ΔF) did not affect its binding to Pin2 (Fig. 2B). These results indicate that Pin2 binds C-terminal to the F-box motif. All targets of F-box proteins identified to date interact with sequences located C-terminal to the F-box motif. Upon examination of the Fbx4-binding domain in Pin2, we found that GST-Pin2 fragments encompassing residues 1–419, 48–155, or 1–155 bound to Fbx4 (Fig. 2D). In contrast, GST-Pin2 fragments encompassing residues 1–47, 156–316, 317–419, or 269–316 all failed to bind to Fbx4 (Fig. 2D). Most interestingly, based on the TRF1 crystal structure 1H60 (47Fairall L. Chapman L. Moss H. de Lange T. Rhodes D. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 351-361Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar), the amino acid residues from 48 to 155 correspond to the first three α-helices in the dimerization domain and are present in both Pin2 and TRF1. These results indicate that the first three α-helices in the dimerization domain of Pin2 and TRF1 are required for association with Fbx4. Fbx4 and UbcH5a Promote Ubiquitination of Both Pin2 and TRF1 in Vitro and in Vivo—The results presented thus far indicated that Fbx4 interacts with Pin2 and TRF1 in vitro and in vivo. Given that many F-box proteins can target certain regulatory proteins for degradation by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway (31Jin J. Cardozo T. Lovering R.C. Elledge S.J. Pagano M. Harper J.W.

Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 1328-1333Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar), we hypothesized that Fbx4 might target Pin2 and TRF1 for SCF-mediated ubiquitination and thereby promote its turnover by the proteasome. To examine this possibility, we first examined whether Fbx4 promotes ubiquitination of Pin2 and TRF1 in vitro. To this end, we employed a reticulocyte extract system wherein in vitro translated F-box proteins assemble into SCF complexes composed of neddylated Cul1, Rbx1, and Skp1, which pre-exist in reticulocyte extracts (40Koepp D.M.

Here, we report that YB-1 activation via the Jak1 signaling pathway is required and sufficient to confer interferon-γ-dependent activation of the smad7 gene. By binding to a bona fide recognition site within the smad7 promoter, YB-1 up-regulates smad7 transcription, which was additively enhanced by autoinhibitory TGF-β signaling. Importantly, the anti-TGF-β effect was not only supplied by induced Smad7 expression but was recapitulated in the context of the col1A2 promoter, where YB-1 overexpression abolished the trans-stimulatory TGF-β effect in a dominant fashion.

Y-box proteins belong to a family of DNA- and RNA-binding factors, also named cold shock proteins, that are highly conserved during evolution and have been shown to function as regulators of gene transcription and translation (1Swamynathan S.K.

YB-1 has been implicated in the regulation of proliferation-associated genes (e.g. thymidine kinase, proliferating cellular nuclear antigen, and epidermal growth factor receptor (7Ladomery M. Sommerville J. BioEssays. 1995; 17: 9-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar)), and most recently a direct effect on p53 protein expression and interaction with p53 has been described (8Lasham A. Moloney S.

In regard to ECM synthesis and deposition, YB-1 was identified as a negative regulator in glomerular mesangial cells, where it trans-activates transcription of the matrix metalloproteinase-2 gene via combinatorial interactions with p53 and AP-2, which may be antagonized by nonmetastasizing protein 23 (Nm23) (9Cheng S. Alfonso-Jaume M.A. Mertens P.R. Lovett D.H. Biochem. J. 2002; 366: 807-816Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In human embryonic kidney cells and dermal fibroblasts, a repressive function of YB-1 on the col1A2 gene promoter was reported, which is mediated by IFN-γ (10Higashi K. Inagaki Y. Fujimori K.

Studies with a mutated IgRE and expression vectors containing partially deleted YB-1 cDNAs that were GFP-tagged for detection by immunofluorescence microscopy indicated that IFN-γ facilitates nuclear translocation of YB-1, which thereafter binds to the col1-specific IgRE. Similarly, a functional Y-box element was identified within the proximal col1A1 gene promoter (collagen Y-box element), which is conserved between humans, rats, and mice (11Norman J.T. Lindahl G.E.

A direct link between TGF-β expression and tissue fibrosis has been established in different models of experimental fibrosis and human diseases of liver and kidney, and various TGF-β antagonizing strategies (e.g. by overexpression of soluble TGF-β type II receptors or Smad7) significantly reduce collagen accumulation in experimental fibrosis (14Dooley S.

More detailed studies with primary cultures of in vitro activated HSC and an activated HSC clone derived from cirrhotic rat liver, CFSC-2G, have delineated a TGF-β-dependent pathway leading to col1A2 gene transcription and revealed a cooperation between transcription factors Sp1 and Smad3/4 (16Inagaki Y.

Given the enormous medical relevance of progressive fibrotic processes, several groups have sought to identify signaling events that inhibit col1 expression. One successful approach is tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), which antagonizes the effects of TGF-β on collagen expression through induction of inhibitory Smad7 or AP-1 components in dermal fibroblasts (18Verrecchia F.

Given the antagonistic action of IFN-γ on TGF-β signaling (19Ulloa L. Doody J. Massague J. Nature. 1999; 397: 710-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (709) Google Scholar) and the previous finding of YB-1 activation by IFN-γ, a direct link between these two signaling events converging on transcription factor YB-1 was hypothesized in the present study. Specifically, we addressed the question of whether YB-1 confers the IFN-γ-inhibitory effect on TGF-β activity by up-regulating smad7 gene expression.

Transient Transfections—Plasmid DNA for transfections was prepared with the Endofree Plasmid Maxi kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). Transient transfections were performed using Fugene6 transfection reagent (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's instructions. 100 ng/ml plasmid DNA/6-well culture plate was co-introduced with pSV-40-β-gal (Promega) for transfection efficiency normalization (27Hall C.V. Jacob P.E. Ringold G.M. Lee F. J. Mol. Appl. Genet. 1983; 2: 101-109PubMed Google Scholar). Cell lysis and luciferase assays were carried out using a luciferase kit (Promega). Each transfection was performed in quadruplicate and repeated at least three times. All data from transient transfections are presented as mean ± S.D. RNA Extraction and Northern Blot Analysis—Northern blotting was performed with 20 μg of total RNA (28Berg F. Delvoux B. Gao C. Westhoff J.H. Breitkopf K. Gressner A.M.

Bands were detected with a Molecular Imager® scanner (Bio-Rad) and quantified densitometrically with Lumi Imager (Roche Applied Science). Signals were measured in Boehringer light units and related to glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. Preparation of Nuclear Extracts—According to previous protocols (31Andrews N.C. Faller D.V. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 2499Crossref PubMed Scopus (2207) Google Scholar) with minor modifications, 5 × 107 cells/ml were seeded, and subconfluent cells were scratched from Petri dishes with 10 ml of phosphate-buffered saline, and a pellet was obtained by centrifugation (Beckman CS-6R, 4 min, 800 rpm). After two phosphate-buffered saline washes, cells were resuspended in 1 ml of phosphate-buffered saline and centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 45 s. The cell pellet was resuspended in 400 μl of ice-cold buffer A (10 mm Hepes (pH 7.9), 10 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm EGTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μl of complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science), 1 mm dithiothreitol) and incubated on ice for 15 min. For cell lysis, 25 μl of 10% Nonidet P-40 was added, and cells were homogenized with 10 strokes in a Dounce homogenizer at 4 °C, followed by centrifugation for 1 min at 14,000 rpm for nuclei sedimentation. Supernatants were carefully removed and regarded as cytoplasmic fractions. Extraction of nuclear proteins was achieved by adding 50 μl of buffer C (20 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 0.4 m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.1 μl of complete protease inhibitor mixture). Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Analysis—Double-stranded probes were generated by heating complementary synthetic oligonucleotides for 10 min at 95 °C with subsequent cooling to room temperature over 6 h. The S7-Y1 sequence was as follows (-248/-199): 5′-GGCGGCTGGGGGCGGGGGAGGGAAGGGGTAGAGGGGGGAGGGGAAGGG-3′. All probes were radiolabeled by T4-polynucleotide kinase using [γ-32P]ATP, purified on 14% polyacrylamide gels, eluted, and 6 × 104 cpm of labeled probe was included per binding reaction. Binding reactions and supershift studies were performed as described (32Mertens P.R. Alfonso-Jaume M.A. Steinmann K. Lovett D.H. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 1999; 10: 2480-2487Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recombinant YB-1 was prepared with the pRSET vector (Invitrogen) containing an insert coding for hexahistidine-/T7 epitope-tagged YB-1 fusion protein (22Mertens P.R. Alfonso-Jaume M.A. Steinmann K. Lovett D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32957-32965Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Preparation of Cell Lysates and Immunoblotting—Cell lysates were prepared with radioimmune precipitation buffer (1× Tris-buffered saline, 1% Nonidet P-40 (Amresco, Solon, OH), 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS) as described (33Dooley S. Delvoux B. Lahme B. Mangasser-Stephan K. Gressner A.M. Hepatology. 2000; 31: 1094-1106Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). Western blotting was performed with affinity-purified rabbit anti-YB-1 antibody (1:1,000) (32Mertens P.R. Alfonso-Jaume M.A. Steinmann K. Lovett D.H. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 1999; 10: 2480-2487Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Protein concentrations of cell lysates and nuclear extracts were determined with the Bio-Rad DC protein assay (Bio-Rad). Southwestern Blot Analysis—These experiments were performed using oligonucleotides that correspond to the sense, antisense, and double-stranded 48-bp smad7 promoter sequence denoted S7-Y1. Probes were prepared as described for electrophoretic mobility shift analysis. Nuclear extracts (30 μg of protein/lane) were electrophoresed on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes by electroblotting. Membranes were blocked in 25 mm HEPES (pH 8.0), 10% glycerol, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 2.5% dry milk powder for 12 h at 4 °C, washed for 5 min in TNE-50 buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol), and probed for 4 h at 30 °C in TNE-50 containing 10 μg/ml poly(dI-dC) and radiolabeled oligonucleotide probes (106 cpm/ml). Membranes were washed three times in excess TNE-50 buffer for 30 s each at 4 °C and autoradiographed. Tet-off System for Induced Expression of YB-1 Protein—The Tet-off system (34Gossen M. Bujard H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5547-5551Crossref PubMed Scopus (4214) Google Scholar) was set up by stable double transfection of rat mesangial cells with regulatory, response, and selection plasmids, that are pTet-Off, pTRE-HA-YB-1, and pTK-Hyg, in the presence of selection media containing G418 (Calbiochem) and hygromycin (Invitrogen). Transfections were performed using effectene (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Single cell colonies were grown in the presence of 1 μg/ml doxycyclin (ICN, Aurora, OH) in order to keep transcription of expression plasmid turned off. Medium supplemented with fresh doxycyclin was replaced every other day. Expression of HA-YB-1 at reduced doxycyclin concentrations (10-2, 10-4, and 10-6 mol/liter) was detected by Western blotting using anti-HA tag antibody. All plasmids were kindly donated by H. Bujard (University Heidelberg, Germany) except for pTRE-HA (BD Biosciences). In frame cloning of the complete YB-1 coding sequence into pTRE-HA was ascertained by automated sequencing. Knockdown of Endogenous YB-1 by Small Interfering RNA—Embryonic mouse fibroblasts (NIH3T3 cells) were grown to 50% confluence on 10-cm plates in complete medium (RPMI 1640 medium with 10% fetal calf serum, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 100 units/ml penicillin). Cells were transfected with the empty vector pSuperDuper (Oligo-Engine, Seattle, WA; kindly donated by B. Lüscher (Institute of Biochemistry, University Hospital Aachen, Germany)) or the pSuperDuper vector harboring a 63-bp sequence 5′-GGTCATCGCAACGAAGGTTTT-3′, which is a tail to tail tandem repeat of bp 285-305 of the human YB-1 coding sequence (J03827). Stable transfections with the liposomal preparation Fugene were performed in conjunction with G418 resistance plasmid pUHD15-1neo (BD-Clontech) according to the manufacturer's instructions (Roche Applied Science). Briefly, 5 μg of total plasmid DNA and 15 μl of Fugene solution were mixed in 500 μl of serum-free medium, incubated for 15 min at room temperature, and added dropwise to culture medium (10 ml/plate). After 24 h, the medium was exchanged, and selection with G418 at a concentration of 400 μg/ml was started. Screening for the presence of pSuperDuper plasmid DNA in single cell clones was performed, and reduction of YB-1 mRNA and protein levels was performed by Taqman analysis and immunoblotting using anti-YB-1 antibody. YB-1 Induces Expression of Smad7 in HSC—Our initial hypothesis of a YB-1-dependent regulation of smad7 was analyzed by Northern blotting using total RNA collected from activated HSC, CFSC, that were manipulated to increase YB-1 expression or treated by cytokines TGF-β and IFN-γ. Transfection efficiency was quantified at 20% by performing cotransfection with a GFP expression plasmid. YB-1 overexpression in HSC resulted in a 4.5-fold stimulation of Smad7 mRNA expression (Fig. 1A, cp lanes 1 and 2, quantitated by densitometry in Fig. 1B). TGF-β1 alone (5 ng/ml, lane 3) or ectopic expression of constutively active Alk5 (lane 4) similarly led to a 2-4.5-fold increase of smad7 mRNA expression. A 5-fold up-regulation of smad7 mRNA was observed in HSC incubated with IFN-γ at 500 units/ml (lane 6). A “superinduction” of Smad7 expression by 19.5-fold compared with nontreated cells (lane 1) was detected when YB-1-overexpressing cells were exposed to TGF-β1 (lane 5). These stimulatory effects on smad7 mRNA expression were confirmed in three independent experiments. Furthermore, a Tet-off model system was set up, which allows for regulated induction of YB-1 expression in mesangial cells. These cells play a similar role as HSC in regard to ECM synthesis and degradation in the kidney and also exhibit a myofibroblastic phenotype in vitro. Decreasing tetracycline concentration in medium yielded up-regulated YB-1 protein expression (Fig. 2A, lanes 1-4). With elevated YB-1 expression, Smad7 protein was also up-regulated (Fig. 2B), at most 50-fold (cf. lanes 1 and 4). The inducing effect of YB-1 was not directly correlated with the amount of expressed protein, since the lower concentration of YB-1 at 10-6 μg/ml compared with 10-4 μg/ml tetracyclin was associated with the highest Smad7 protein concentration. As positive control, lysates from HSC overexpressing Smad7 were loaded (lane 5). Identification of a YB-1-responsive Element within the smad7 Promoter Region—To test for the YB-1 trans-regulatory effect on the rat smad7 promoter, transient transfection studies with promoter-luciferase reporter constructs harboring 1276 bp of the immediate 5′ regulatory sequence were performed. YB-1 overexpression led to a 3-fold induction of reporter gene expression (Fig. 3A). By introducing constructs with serial deletions of the promoter sequence, the YB-1-responsive site was mapped at -343 to -190 bp relative to the transcription start site, which is 3′ to the SBE at -346/-341 bp. In construct pSmad7(-343), the SBE is disrupted. Sequence analysis of the smad7 promoter revealed a putative YB-1 binding site located at -246/-239 that overlaps with an Sp1 site at -240/-232 (Fig. 3B). This sequence element exhibits significant similarities with known YB-1-responsive elements (i.e. 7 of 8 consecutive nucleotides match with the YB-1 binding motif of the rat matrix metalloproteinase-2 gene (22Mertens P.R. Alfonso-Jaume M.A. Steinmann K. Lovett D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32957-32965Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), and 6 of 8 nucleotides match with a YB-1-responsive element in the human DNA polymerase-α gene (35En-Nia A. Yilmaz E. Klinge U. Lovett D.H. Stefanidis I. Mertens P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 7702-7711Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar)). This sequence element at -248/-201 bp, including the Y-box and immediate adjacent 3′-sequence, was designated S7-Y1. Sizing of S7-Y1 Binding Activities—Southwestern blotting of nuclear proteins was used to size S7-Y1 binding activities (Fig. 3C). Double-stranded (DS; lanes 1 and 2) and single-stranded (sense strand (SS1), lanes 3 and 4; antisense strand (SS2), lanes 5 and 6) oligonucleotides were used as probes with HSC nuclear extract. The nucleoprotein binding patterns with DS and SS2 were similar (i.e. complexes with molecular sizes of ∼97, 52, 35, 30, 25, and 20 kDa were detected); however, the band intensities with SS2 were severalfold more intense than with DS probe. Incubation with the SS1 probe only yielded weak bands at 97 and 20 kDa. Binding specificity was confirmed by the inclusion of an excess amount of homologous competitor DNA, resulting in diminished bands (Fig. 3C, lanes 2, 4, and 6). Western blotting of the same membrane with anti-YB-1 antibody demonstrates a mobility of YB-1 at 52 kDa (lane 7), which underscores the possibility of YB-1 being an S7-Y1 binding activity. YB-1 Binding to the S7-Y1 Element—Next, DNA binding studies were performed with recombinant YB-1 protein and nuclear extracts from HSC, using oligonucleotide probes that harbor the S7-Y1. Since YB-1 may recognize and bind to both single- and double-stranded DNA templates and the Southwestern blotting results indicated predominant binding to the double-stranded and antisense strand, probes were prepared for these conformations (SS2 and DS). Recombinant YB-1 (rYB-1) formed distinct complexes with both DS and SS2 S7-Y1 templates, indicated by 1 in Fig. 4A (lanes 2 and 6). The specificity of complex formation was ascertained by inclusion of homologous competitor DNA in a 500-fold molar excess (lanes 3 and 7), leading to diminished bands, whereas heterologous competitor DNA had no effect on complex formation (lanes 4 and 8). Given the observation of recombinant YB-1 binding to the S7-Y1 element, we next set out to explore binding of endogenous nuclear proteins prepared from different cellular proveniences to this element. As can be seen in Fig. 4B, at least six distinct complexes could be observed with nuclear proteins from HSC. The inclusion of homologous competitor DNA at increasing concentrations (50- and 500-fold molar excess) resulted in loss of complex formation (lanes 2 and 3). On the other hand, heterologous competitor DNA at a 500-fold molar excess only marginally affected complexes 1, 2, 5, and 6, whereas complexes 3 and 4 were diminished and are most likely nonspecific. These results suggest formation of multiple distinct nucleoprotein complexes within the S7-Y1 sequence context. To elucidate participation of endogenous YB-1 in the binding to this element, specific anti-YB-1 antibody was included in the binding reaction (32Mertens P.R. Alfonso-Jaume M.A. Steinmann K. Lovett D.H. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 1999; 10: 2480-2487Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This resulted in supershifts (indicated by asterisks, lane 5) and diminished bands 5 and 6. Since the supershift coincided with the mobilities of complexes 1 and 2, it remains enigmatic whether these are also supershifted by the antibody. The addition of a nonrelated IgG antibody had no effect on the binding pattern (data not shown). An unchanged nuclear protein binding pattern to the S7-Y1 was detected after treatment with TGF-β1 at 5 ng/ml (lane 6). Furthermore, a similar binding pattern was obtained with nuclear extracts from U4A and U4A-Jak1 cells (lanes 7 and 8). We also set out to explore the pattern of nucleocomplex formation with the antisense strand S7-Y1 template. As can be seen in Fig. 4C, three distinct complexes were detected with SS2, which are denoted 1 through 3. All of these bands are abrogated after inclusion of excess homologous competitor DNA (lanes 2 and 3), whereas only complex 1 was diminished with the inclusion of heterologous competitor DNA at a 500-fold molar excess and most likely represents nonspecific protein binding. Again, inclusion of anti-YB-1 antibody confirmed participation of YB-1 in the formation of complexes 2 and 3, since they were diminished, and, at the same time, a ladder of supershifted bands appeared (asterisks, lane 5). DNA binding studies with nuclear proteins from HSC stimulated with TGF-β1 did not reveal a difference in binding to S7-Y1 (lane 6), as did the analysis of other model systems, U4A and U4A-Jak1 cells (lanes 7 and 8). Taken together, the DNA binding studies with recombinant as well as endogenous YB-1 protein confirm participation of YB-1 in nucleocomplex formation with the S7-Y1, both in the double- and single-stranded conformation, and suggest that YB-1 performs partnering with yet unidentified proteins. From the unchanged binding pattern after cell incubation with TGF-β, it is concluded that there is no alteration of binding affinities and relative amounts of nuclear S7-Y1 binding proteins after TGF-β exposure.

Friedman J.M. Science. 2002; 297: 240-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (672) Google Scholar). Research in recent years has unveiled the significant role of SCD1 in lipid metabolism. The products of SCD, palmitoleic and oleic acids, are the most abundant fatty acids found in triglycerides and cholesteryl esters. Significant reduction in tissue triglycerides and cholesteryl esters has been observed in a laboratory mouse model with targeted disruption in the SCD1 gene (SCD1-/-) (23Miyazaki M. Kim Y.-C. Gray-Keller M.P. Attie A.D. Ntambi J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 30132-30138Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar). It was also found that the SCD1-/- mice have very low levels of triglycerides in the very low density lipoprotein fraction compared with the wild-type counterparts (23Miyazaki M. Kim Y.-C. Gray-Keller M.P. Attie A.D. Ntambi J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 30132-30138Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar). More interestingly, SCD1 is the major target gene for leptin, and SCD1 deficiency in ob/ob mice results in significant reduction in the production of triglycerides and very low density lipoprotein (22Cohen P. Miyazaki M. Socci N.D. Hagge-Greenberg A. Liedtke W. Soukas A.A. Sharma R. Hudgins L.C. Ntambi J.M. Friedman J.M. Science. 2002; 297: 240-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (672) Google Scholar). The fact that SCD1-/- mice are resistant to diet- and leptin deficiency-induced adiposity makes SCD1 an attractive therapeutic target for the treatment of obesity. It is evident that SCD and lipid synthesis are tightly linked. To fully understand the role of SCD in lipid metabolism, it is necessary to obtain more complete information on the structure of SCD. However, owing to the intrinsic technical difficulties associated with purification and crystallization of membrane proteins, structural information on membrane-associated desaturases is limited. SCD is a key regulator in membrane fluidity with a rapid turnover rate. Studies have shown that the N-terminal segment of the enzyme contains a sequence responsible for its rapid degradation (24Mziaut M. Korza G. Ozols J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 8883-8888Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). It is also known that SCD belongs to a super-family of membrane-anchored desaturases (5Fox B.G. Shanklin J. Somerville C. Munck E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 2486-2490Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). Analysis of the primary sequence of the membrane desaturases from a wide range of organisms, including mammals, fungi, cyanobacteria, insects, and higher ordered plants indicates conservation of three regions of histidine-box motifs (HXXXXH, HXXHH, and HXXHH). A site-directed mutagenesis study on rat Δ9 desaturase showed that the eight conserved histidine residues are catalytically essential (5Fox B.G. Shanklin J. Somerville C. Munck E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 2486-2490Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). It was proposed that these His residues serve as ligands for the iron atom contained in these enzymes, thus forming the catalytic site, which is predicted to be located on the cytoplasmic side of the membrane (5Fox B.G. Shanklin J. Somerville C. Munck E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 2486-2490Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). To date, experimental evidence on the topology of membrane desaturases or enzymes that contain the conserved His-motifs has mainly been derived from studies performed in prokaryotes: acyllipid Δ5 desaturase from Bacillus subtilis (25Diaz A.R. Mansilla M.C. Vila A.J. de Mendoza D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 48099-48106Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) and membrane-bound alkane hydroxylase of Pseudomonas oleovorans (26van Beilen J.B. Penninga D. Witholt B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9194-9201Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, no topology analysis has been performed on a mammalian desaturase. Understanding the structure and orientation of membrane protein will help to reveal the interactions between the substrate and the enzyme as well as its spatial relationship with other proteins present in the vicinity. Based on hydropathy analyses of the sequences of rat and yeast stearoyl-CoA desaturase, Stukey et al. (27Stukey J.E. McDonough V.M. Martin C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 20144-20149Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) proposed that the structural model of membrane-bound desaturases consist of four membrane-spanning domains with the N and C termini as well as the catalytic site being oriented toward the cytosolic side of the membrane. However, no experimental evidence is available to date. Therefore, in this current study, we characterize the topology of a mammalian membrane desaturase, the mouse SCD1 isoform. Our data provide evidence that the N and C termini of SCD1 are oriented toward the cytosol with four membrane spanning helices separated by two very short hydrophilic loops in the ER lumen and one large hydrophilic loop in the cytosol. Based on this model, the active center of SCD is oriented toward the cytosol. In addition, according to a previous observation that SCD is a thiol enzyme (28Holloway P.W. Peluffo R. Wakil S.J. Biochem. Biophy. Res. Commun. 1963; 12: 300-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), we investigated whether the cysteine residues are important for enzyme activity through mutagenesis studies. Our data show that the cysteines in SCD are not catalytically essential. Materials—HeLa cells were a generous gift from Dr. Ann Palmenberg from the University of Wisconsin-Madison. Tissue culture medium and reagents were purchased from Invitrogen. Monoclonal antibodies against the epitopes were obtained as listed: anti-Myc from Covance (Berkeley, CA), anti-HA from Roche (Nutley, NJ), anti-KDEL from Stressgen (Victoria, BC Canada), anti-FLAG from Sigma (St. Louis, MO). Alexa-Fluor®488 rabbit anti-rat IgG and Alexa-Fluor® 594 goat anti-mouse IgG were from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). QuikChange® Multi Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit was from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA). [1-14C] stearoyl-CoA was from American Radio-labeled Chemicals, Inc. (St. Louis, MO). (2-(Trimethylammonium)ethyl)methanethiosulfonate bromide (MTSET) was from Toronto Research Chemicals, Inc. (North York, ON Canada). N-(3-maleimidyl-propionyl) biocytin (biotin maleimide) was from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). Immobilized NeutrAvidin Biotin Binding Protein was from Pierce. All other reagents were from Fisher or Sigma. Preparation of Plasmids—The pcDNA3 plasmid expressing SCD1 with the Myc epitope tagged to the C terminus (SCD1-Myc-C) was provided by Dr. Travis Knight, Iowa State University. A FLAG-GPI8 construct was a gift from Dr. Anant Menon, Cornell University. PCR was employed for the synthesis of other epitope-tagged constructs, and SCD1-Myc-C was used as the template. To synthesize the SCD1 construct with an HA epitope appended to the N terminus (N-HA-SCD1), we used a forward primer that contained the EcoRI site, the 27 nucleotides encoding the HA epitope, the first bases of the SCD1 open reading frame (5′-TTGAATTCACCATGTACCCATATGACGTCCCGGAC-TACGCCATGGGGAAGGGAGGTAACC-3′) and a reverse primer containing the bases complementary to the final bases of the SCD1 open reading frame and a HindIII site (5′-TTGAAGCTTCAGCTACTCTT-GTGACTCCC-3′). The PCR product was then subcloned into the pcDNA 3.1 expression vector. The strategy for constructing plasmids with internal HA epitope and a Myc epitope at the C terminus (93HA-Myc-c, 138HA-Myc-c, and 241HA-Myc-c) was by synthesizing the SCD1 gene as two PCR fragments, fragments A and B, with the amino acid after which an HA tag was inserted being the point of breakage. The 5′-end of the PCR fragment A carried an EcoRI site, which was necessary for cloning the gene fragment into the pcDNA3.1 expression vector. The 3′-end of PCR fragment A contained the 27 nucleotides that encoded the HA epitope, followed by an XhoI site, which allows the connection of the PCR fragment A to fragment B. The 5′-end of PCR fragment B carried an XhoI site, with which it was ligated to fragment A. The 3′-end of the fragment B carried the sequence that encoded the Myc epitope followed by a HindIII site, which was inserted to facilitate ligation to the expression vector. The sequences of the primers for synthesizing the plasmids containing an internal HA epitope are listed in Table 1. Fig. 1B depicts the construction of the recombinant proteins.TABLE 1Primers used for synthesizing SCD1 constructs with internal HA epitope Open table in a new tab The fragment of SCD1 expressing amino acids 206-272 with the 5′ EcoRI and 3′ BamHI sites was generated by PCR and was then cloned into pEGFP-C2 vector (forward primer: 5′-ATTGAATTCCTGGTG-ATGTTCCAGAGG-3′, reverse primer: 5′-AATGGATCCTCAGTA-GGGGCGATATCCATA-3′). SCD1-Myc-C plasmid was used as the template for the generation of the plasmid 233C used in cysteine derivatization study. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed using QuikChange multi site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer's instruction. All the endogenous cysteines on SCD1 except for the cysteine at amino acid 233 were changed to serine. The sequence of the primers for the mutagenesis was as follows: C92S, 5′-CTGGTTCCCTCCAGCAA-GCTCTACACCTG-3′; C97S, 5′-GCAAGCTCTACACCAGCCTCT-TCGGGATTTTCT-3′; C222S, 5′-CCTCCTGCTGATGAGCTTCA-TCCTGCCCA-3′; C322S, 5′-CGTTCTTCATCGACAGCATGGCT-GCCCTG-3′. The plasmids C92S, C97S, C222S, C233S, and C322S used for the cysteine mutagenesis study were also generated using the QuikChange multi site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). Cell Culture and Expression of the Epitope-tagged SCD1 Proteins in HeLa Cells—HeLa cells were maintained in high glucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (v/v), and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. The cells were incubated at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO2. The transfection of the different constructs into the HeLa cells was performed as described (29Pottekat A. Menon A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 15743-15751Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Briefly, HeLa cells were cultured to 80-100% confluency. The cells were lifted from the plates by the addition of trypsin EDTA and pelleted by centrifugation at 2000 rpm. The cell pellet was then washed by resuspending in 50 ml of Cytomix buffer (120 mm KCl, 0.15 mm CaCl2, 25 mm HEPES/KOH pH, 7.6, 2 mm EGTA, and 5 mm MgCl2). The cells were then pelleted, and 500 μl of Cytomix was added to resuspend the cells. The cell suspension was then transferred to an electroporation cuvette. 25 μg of DNA plasmid was added to the cell suspension, and the mixture was exposed to a single electric pulse of 300 V with a capacitance of 1000 microfarads using a Bio-Rad pulse system. The cell mixture was transferred back to a 100-mm culture plate, and the cells were incubated in culture medium as described above for 24 or 48 h as specified before analysis was performed. For indirect immunofluorescence study, cells were plated onto polylysine-coated coverslips. SCD Activity Assay—The SCD activity assay was performed as described (11Miyazaki M. Jacobson M.J. Man W.C. Cohen P. Asilmaz E. Friedman J.M. Ntambi J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 33904-33911Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Microsomes were isolated from HeLa cells expressing the different plasmids by differential centrifugation and resuspended in 0.1 m potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.2). SCD activity was assayed at room temperature with 3 μm [1-14C]stearoyl-CoA, 2 mm NADH, and microsomal protein. After 15 min of incubation, 200 μl of 2.5 m KOH in 75% ethanol was added, and the reaction mixture was saponified at 85 °C for 1 h. The samples were cooled and acidified with 280 μl of formic acid. Free fatty acids were extracted with 700 μl of hexane and separated on a 10% AgNO3-impregnated TLC plate using chloroform: methanol:acetic acid:H2O (90:8:1:0.8). The TLC plates were analyzed with Instant Imager (Packard, Meriden, CT). Proteins were quantified using Bradford method with bovine serum albumin as the standard. Fluorescence Microscopy—About 24 h post-transfection, the coverslips were taken out from the culture plate and washed with PBS three times. The cells were then fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde at room temperature for 10 min, followed by an additional three washes with PBS. As for permeabilization of cellular membranes, two conditions were used based on the extent of permeabilization needed. For selective permeabilization of the plasma membrane only, the cells were incubated with a mixture of 3 μg/ml digitonin, Cytomix buffer, and 0.3 m sucrose for 15 min at 4 °C. For complete permeabilization of cellular membranes, including the ER membrane, the cells were treated with 0.3% of Triton X-100 in PBS for 25 min at 4 °C. After permeabilization with detergents, the cells were washed with PBS three times and blocked with 10% fetal bovine serum in PBS (v/v) for 1 h at room temperature. The permeabilized cells were then incubated with anti-Myc monoclonal antibody at 1:500 dilution or anti-HA monoclonal antibody at 3 μg/ml for 1 h at room temperature. After incubation with primary antibodies, the cells were washed three times with PBS and incubated with Alexa Fluor 594 goat anti-mouse IgG or Alexa Fluor 488 rabbit anti-rat IgG at a dilution of 1:250 for 1 h at room temperature. After three more washes with PBS, the coverslips were mounted on microscopy slides with a drop of Vectorshield (Vector Laboratories) added between the slide and the coverslips. Microscopy was performed to visualize the staining pattern. For samples containing recombinant proteins fused with GFP, both live cells and fixed cells were analyzed. Preparation of Membrane Vesicles—HeLa cells (∼1 × 107 cells/ml) were resuspended in buffer A (10 mm Hepes-KOH (pH 7.4), 10 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm sodium EDTA, 5 mm sodium EGTA, 250 mm sucrose) and disrupted using nitrogen cavitation (400 p.s.i. for 15 min) and digested with DNase (2 units/ml) for 20 min on ice. The cell homogenate was then centrifuged at 1000 × g for 10 min. The resulting supernatant was then subjected to a 10,000 × g spin for 10 min. To obtain the microsomes for proteinase K protection assay and cysteine derivatization, the supernatant from the 10,000 × g spin was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h. The resulting pellet was used for subsequent experiments. Proteinase K Protection Assay—Membrane vesicles were treated with proteinase K (500 μg/ml) in the presence or absence of 1% (v/v) Triton X-100 for 30 min at 4 °C. The reaction was then stopped by addition of phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride at a final concentration of 25 mm. The samples were then boiled for 5 min in the presence of sample loading buffer and subjected to immunoblot analysis. Cysteine Derivatization—The procedure for cysteine derivatization was based on that described by Feramisco et al. (30Feramisco J.D. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 279: 8487-8496Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) with slight modification. All the buffers used as described below contained protease inhibitors (10 μg/ml leupeptin, 5 μg/ml pepstatin A, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Membrane vesicle fractions (100,000 × g pellets) were resuspended in buffer B (Buffer A with 100 mm NaCl) with or without 5 mm MTSET and were then incubated at room temperature for 30 min. The membranes were then washed and resuspended in 100 μm biotin maleimide. After a 30-min incubation at room temperature, the reaction was quenched with 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol. The membranes were pelleted and resuspended in buffer C (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 1.5% (w/v) Nonidet P-40, 0.1% (w/v) SDS). Each sample then received an aliquot of Immobilized NeutrAvidin biotin-binding protein and was incubated overnight. The sample was then centrifuged to pellet the beads. Biotinylated proteins were released from the bead pellet through boiling, and the eluted proteins were analyzed using SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. Immunoblot Analysis—Protein samples were loaded and separated on a 10% SDS-PAGE, after which the proteins were transferred to Immobilon-P transfer membranes at 4 °C. The membranes were than subjected to immunoblot analysis, and the antibodies were used at the following concentrations: anti-Myc at a dilution of 1:1000; anti-HA at the concentration of 100 ng/ml; anti-KDEL at the concentration of 4 μg/ml; anti-mouse IgG at 1:6000; and anti-rat IgG at 1:15000. Visualization of the bound antibodies was performed using the Super Signal West Pico kit (Pierce). Proteins were quantified using Bradford assay with bovine serum albumin as the standard. Analysis of the Primary Sequence of Mouse Stearoyl-CoA Desaturase 1 Predicts the Presence of Four Transmembrane Domains—Fig. 1A shows the distribution of the hydrophobic amino acids of SCD1 using the Kyte-Doolittle hydropathy scale with a window size of 19. The analysis of the network-based algorithm TMHMM (31Moller S. Croning M.D.R Apweiler R. Bioinformatics. 2001; 17: 646-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (860) Google Scholar) also predicted that SCD1 contains four transmembrane domains between amino acids 67-89, 99-121, 213-232, and 247-269 with both the N and C termini facing the cytosol. This prediction is consistent with the topology model proposed by Stukey et al. (27Stukey J.E. McDonough V.M. Martin C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 20144-20149Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) based on primary sequence analysis of desaturases. Expression and Functional Analysis of the Epitope-tagged SCD1 Constructs—To map the topology of SCD1, we designed five SCD1 constructs by inserting epitopes at the termini and the predicted loops. To locate the N and C termini, we employed two SCD1 constructs with either a HA tag attached to the N terminus of SCD1 (N-HA-SCD1) or an Myc epitope appended to the C terminus (SCD1-Myc-C). For determining the orientation of the three putative loops, we generated three SCD1 constructs in pcDNA 3.1 vector with an Myc epitope at the C terminus and a HA epitope in each loop (Fig. 1B). We inserted the HA epitope after amino acid 93 in the first ER luminal loop (93HA-Myc-c), amino acid 138 in the cytosolic loop (138HA-Myc-c), and amino acid 241 in the second ER luminal loop (241HA-Myc-c). The epitope-tagged constructs were transiently expressed in HeLa cells for 48 h, and the cells were harvested for analysis. SCD1 protein of the expected molecular mass (∼41 kDa) was produced by all constructs (Fig. 2A). To determine if the insertion of epitope would have deleterious effect on the folding of the protein into its final three-dimensional structure, SCD activity assays were also performed on microsomes isolated from the transfected cells. The basal level of SCD activity in HeLa cells transfected with empty pcDNA3.1 vector was almost undetectable. The SCD activity of N-HA-SCD1 and SCD1-Myc-C was higher than the basal level by 23- and 39-fold, respectively, whereas those of 93HA-Myc-c and 138HA-Myc-c were significantly (5.5- and 5.9-fold, respectively) higher than that of the empty vector transfected cells, indicating that the constructs were functional (Fig. 2B). The lower SCD activity in the case of 93HA-Myc-c and 138HA-Myc-c was clearly due to a lower expression level of the constructs compared with their terminally tagged counterparts (Fig. 2A). To give an apparent level of activity especially for the constructs 93HA-Myc-c and 138HA-Myc-c, we normalized the SCD activity values in Fig. 2B to the corresponding expression level of the recombinant constructs (Fig. 2C). Unfortunately, insertion of the HA epitope after amino acid 241 resulted in a nonfunctional protein that could not be employed in the subsequent indirect immunofluorescence studies. Insertion of epitope has been shown to result in nonfunctional proteins in other topology studies (32Ferguson P.L. Flintoff W.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16269-16278Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 33Liu X.Y. Matherly L.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1564: 333-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), and it is assumed to be due to misfolding or differences in the conformational state of the recombinant protein compared with the wild-type protein. The Epitopes at N and C Termini and Amino Acid 138 Are Oriented to the Cytosol, whereas the Epitope at Residue 93 Is Located in the ER Lumen—The approach of inserting epitopes in the internal hydrophilic loops has been employed in the analysis of the topology of various polytopic membrane proteins (34Lewis S.E.

Listenberger L.L. Ory D.S. Schaffer J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 37042-37050Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). With the constructs N-HA-SCD1, SCD1-Myc-C, 93HA-Myc-c, and 138HA-Myc-c being functional, we proceeded to determine the orientation of the N and C termini as well as the loops by locating the epitopes using indirect cytoimmunofluorescence. We employed indirect cytoimmunofluorescence with selective membrane permeabilization in which the cells were selectively disrupted with 0.3% Triton X-100 or digitonin at a concentration of 3 μg/ml. Incubation with Triton X-100 results in permeabilization of the plasma membrane and the ER, whereas digitonin only disrupts the plasma membrane and leaves the ER intact. To evaluate whether the semi-permeabilization was satisfactory, we performed indirect cytoimmunofluorescence using monoclonal antibody that identifies binding protein/glucose-regulated protein of 78 kDa (BiP/Grp78), the luminal ER marker that carries the KDEL sequence. Fig. 3A shows a representative result that BiP/Grp78 was visible and displayed the characteristic reticular pattern for ER protein when the cells wer"
https://openalex.org/W2018158124,"During human immunodeficiency virus, type 1 (HIV-1) assembly, Gag polypeptides multimerize into immature HIV-1 capsids. The cellular ATP-binding protein ABCE1 (also called HP68 or RNase L inhibitor) appears to be critical for proper assembly of the HIV-1 capsid. In primate cells, ABCE1 associates with Gag polypeptides present in immature capsid assembly intermediates. Here we demonstrate that the NC domain of Gag is critical for interaction with endogenous primate ABCE1, whereas other domains in Gag can be deleted without eliminating the association of Gag with ABCE1. NC contains two Cys-His boxes that form zinc finger motifs and are responsible for encapsidation of HIV-1 genomic RNA. In addition, NC contains basic residues known to play a critical role in nonspecific RNA binding, Gag-Gag interactions, and particle formation. We demonstrate that basic residues in NC are needed for the Gag-ABCE1 interaction, whereas the cysteine and histidine residues in the zinc fingers are dispensable. Constructs that fail to interact with primate ABCE1 or interact poorly also fail to form capsids and are arrested at an early point in the immature capsid assembly pathway. Whereas others have shown that basic residues in NC bind nonspecifically to RNA, which in turn scaffolds or nucleates assembly, our data demonstrate that the same basic residues in NC act either directly or indirectly to recruit a cellular protein that also promotes capsid formation. Thus, in cells, basic residues in NC appear to act by two mechanisms, recruiting both RNA and a cellular ATPase in order to facilitate efficient assembly of HIV-1 capsids. During human immunodeficiency virus, type 1 (HIV-1) assembly, Gag polypeptides multimerize into immature HIV-1 capsids.

In addition, NC contains basic residues known to play a critical role in nonspecific RNA binding, Gag-Gag interactions, and particle formation. We demonstrate that basic residues in NC are needed for the Gag-ABCE1 interaction, whereas the cysteine and histidine residues in the zinc fingers are dispensable. Constructs that fail to interact with primate ABCE1 or interact poorly also fail to form capsids and are arrested at an early point in the immature capsid assembly pathway. Whereas others have shown that basic residues in NC bind nonspecifically to RNA, which in turn scaffolds or nucleates assembly, our data demonstrate that the same basic residues in NC act either directly or indirectly to recruit a cellular protein that also promotes capsid formation. Thus, in cells, basic residues in NC appear to act by two mechanisms, recruiting both RNA and a cellular ATPase in order to facilitate efficient assembly of HIV-1 capsids. During virion formation, ∼5000 HIV-1 5The abbreviations used are: HIV, human immunodeficiency virus; MA, matrix; CA, capsid; NC, nucleocapsid; WT, wild type; RT, reverse transcriptase; GST, glutathione S-transferase.5The abbreviations used are: HIV, human immunodeficiency virus; MA, matrix; CA, capsid; NC, nucleocapsid; WT, wild type; RT, reverse transcriptase; GST, glutathione S-transferase. Gag polypeptides assemble into a spherical immature capsid at the cytosolic face of the plasma membrane. Multimerization of Gag is coordinated with encapsidation of genomic RNA. Additionally, other viral and cellular proteins are incorporated into virions during capsid formation. Evidence suggests that in cells, capsid assembly occurs via an ATP-dependent, stepwise pathway of discrete assembly intermediates (1.Dooher J.E. Lingappa J.R. J.

Furthermore, HIV-1 capsid assembly appears to require a host protein of 68 kDa (1.Dooher J.E. Lingappa J.R. J. Virol. 2004; 78: 1645-1656Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 4.Zimmerman C.

Interferon Cytokine Res. 2000; 20: 635-644Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Recent bioinformatic analysis indicates that ABCE1 is the most appropriate name for this protein, which is the sole member of the ATP-binding cassette protein family E and is present in many species that do not encode RNase L (16.Kerr I.D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 315: 166-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). In this study, the term ABCE1 will be used instead of HP68. ABCE1 is highly conserved and ubiquitously present in eukaryotes, including yeast, as well as archaebacteria. In a variety of eukaryotic species, ABCE1 is critical for ribosome biogenesis (5.Kispal G. Sipos K. Lange H. Fekete Z. Bedekovics T. Janaky T. Bassler J. Aguilar Netz D.J. Balk J. Rotte C. Lill R.

Parasitol. 2004; 133: 137-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). As is the case with ribosomes, capsids are large multiprotein complexes that contain RNA and are capable of self-assembly in vitro but probably assemble in a regulated fashion within cells (18.Hage A.E. Alix J.H. Mol. Microbiol. 2004; 51: 189-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 19.El Hage A. Sbai M. Alix J.H. Mol. Gen.

Rev. 1969; 33: 302-345Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Analogous to ribosomes, some viral capsids may utilize ABCE1 to chaperone and coordinate their assembly. Depletion-reconstitution studies in a cell-free system and dominant negative mutant studies in cells indicate that ABCE1 plays an important role in assembly of immature HIV-1 capsids (4.Zimmerman C. Klein K.C. Kiser P.K. Singh A.R.S. Firestein B.L. Riba S.C. Lingappa J.R. Nature. 2002; 415: 88-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). In addition, co-immunoprecipitation with antibody to endogenous ABCE1 demonstrates that ABCE1 is associated with Gag polypeptides present in assembly intermediates isolated from primate cells expressing HIV-1 or other primate lentiviruses (1.Dooher J.E. Lingappa J.R. J. Virol. 2004; 78: 1645-1656Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 4.Zimmerman C. Klein K.C. Kiser P.K. Singh A.R.S. Firestein B.L. Riba S.C. Lingappa J.R. Nature. 2002; 415: 88-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). ABCE1 releases from Gag upon completion of immature capsid assembly and is therefore not present in significant amounts in HIV-1 particles released from cells (1.Dooher J.E. Lingappa J.R. J. Virol. 2004; 78: 1645-1656Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 4.Zimmerman C. Klein K.C. Kiser P.K. Singh A.R.S. Firestein B.L. Riba S.C. Lingappa J.R. Nature. 2002; 415: 88-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Analysis of a recently reported crystal structure of ABCE1 suggests that the two nucleotide binding domains in ABCE1 act with a hinge region to undergo a clamp-like motion, with an estimated combined movement of ∼40° during the ATP-driven power stroke (15.Karcher A. Buttner K. Martens B. Jansen R.P. Hopfner K.P. Structure (Camb.). 2005; 13: 649-659Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Together these findings suggest a model in which ABCE1 binds post-translationally to HIV-1 Gag in capsid assembly intermediates and promotes ATP-dependent conformational changes important for assembly, thereby functioning as a chaperone during HIV-1 capsid formation. The exact manner in which ABCE1 acts during assembly has yet to be determined but could include conformational changes associated either with formation of the capsid shell, packaging RNA into the capsid, or targeting assembling Gag to membranes. The 55-kDa HIV-1 Gag polypeptide is composed of four major domains (from N to C terminus): matrix (MA), capsid (CA), nucleocapsid (NC), and p6. Initial analysis of the Gag-ABCE1 association suggested that NC is required for interaction of Gag with ABCE1, whereas p6 is dispensable (1.Dooher J.E. Lingappa J.R. J. Virol. 2004; 78: 1645-1656Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 4.Zimmerman C. Klein K.C. Kiser P.K. Singh A.R.S. Firestein B.L. Riba S.C. Lingappa J.R. Nature. 2002; 415: 88-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). These data are consistent with previous studies demonstrating that NC contains determinants (previously termed the I domain) required for Gag polypeptide multimerization, whereas p6 is not needed for capsid assembly but is required for budding (reviewed in Ref. 22.Freed E.O. Virology. 1998; 251: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar). NC contains two Cys-His boxes that form zinc fingers, are highly conserved among retroviruses, and are known to be important for specific incorporation of HIV genomic RNA (reviewed in Ref. 23.Berkowitz R. Fisher J. Goff S.P. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1996; 214: 177-218PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, NC is highly basic; 15 of its 55 amino acids are arginines and lysines dispersed throughout the domain. These basic residues have been shown to bind RNA nonspecifically (24.Cimarelli A. Sandin S. Hoglund S. Luban J. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 3046-3057Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 25.Schmalzbauer E. Strack B. Dannull J. Guehmann S. Moelling K. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 771-777Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Evidence suggests that RNA binding by these basic residues promotes Gag multimerization, with RNA acting as a nucleator or scaffold (24.Cimarelli A. Sandin S. Hoglund S. Luban J. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 3046-3057Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 26.Campbell S. Vogt V.M. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 6487-6497Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 27.Campbell S. Rein A. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 2270-2279Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 28.Muriaux D. Costes S. Nagashima K. Mirro J. Cho E. Lockett S. Rein A. J. Virol. 2004; 78: 12378-12385Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). However, these basic residues could also act by other mechanisms to promote capsid assembly. Here we demonstrate that the basic residues within NC are necessary to recruit endogenous ABCE1 into Gag-containing assembly intermediates. Furthermore, we find that the cysteine and histidine residues in NC are not required for the Gag-ABCE1 interaction and that large regions of the MA and CA domains of Gag are also dispensable. Velocity sedimentation analyses demonstrate that two NC mutants that fail to form fully assembled immature capsids (including a mutant that fails to bind ABCE1 and one that binds ABCE1 poorly) are arrested at early points in the assembly pathway in cells. Together, our findings reveal that the basic residues in NC that bind nonspecifically to RNA also are important for the interaction of Gag with the cellular protein ABCE1, which facilitates HIV-1 capsid formation. Thus, NC appears to act by two mechanisms to promote efficient HIV-1 capsid assembly in the complex environment of the cytoplasm. Plasmids—For mammalian cell transfection plasmids, Gag mutations were engineered into the pSVGagRRE-R construct, which was obtained from David Rekosh (29.Smith A.J. Srinivasakumar N. Hammarskjold M.L. Rekosh D. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 2266-2275Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and encodes Gag and the Rev response element from the BH10 strain of HIV-1. Truncations were engineered by introduction of two stop codons after the amino acid in Gag indicated in the construct name, using site-directed mutagenesis (Stratagene). To make other constructs, a SacI site was engineered into the parental construct immediately downstream from the Gag coding region by site-directed mutagenesis. Gag mutations were engineered using standard PCR procedures and inserted into the SacI sites on either side of the Gag coding region in the modified pSVGagRRE-R plasmid. The KR10A construct was engineered in an analogous manner by fusing the NC-p6 domains from a template plasmid encoding the KR10A mutations (M1–2/BR (24.Cimarelli A. Sandin S. Hoglund S. Luban J. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 3046-3057Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar)), obtained from Jeremy Luban, to the MA-CA domains in pSVGagRRE-R using standard PCR procedures. Plasmids encoding WT Gag, Tr361, and Tr437 for in vitro transcription have been described previously (1.Dooher J.E. Lingappa J.R. J. Virol. 2004; 78: 1645-1656Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 2.Lingappa J.R. Hill R.L. Wong M.L. Hegde R.S. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 567-581Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 3.Singh A.R. Hill R.L. Lingappa J.R. Virology. 2001; 279: 257-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Plasmids encoding CH1A, CH2A, and CH1/2A for in vitro transcription were engineered using standard PCR procedures into the previously described pSPGag plasmid (WT Gag), which encodes SF2 Gag downstream from the SP6 promoter and a Xenopus 5′-untranslated region (1.Dooher J.E. Lingappa J.R. J. Virol. 2004; 78: 1645-1656Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 2.Lingappa J.R. Hill R.L. Wong M.L. Hegde R.S. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 567-581Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 3.Singh A.R. Hill R.L. Lingappa J.R. Virology. 2001; 279: 257-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 30.Dooher J.E.

Primatol. 2004; 33: 262-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). The plasmid encoding KR10A for in vitro transcription was generated by amplifying the M1–2/BR Gag mutant coding region described above (24.Cimarelli A. Sandin S. Hoglund S. Luban J. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 3046-3057Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar) and inserting it into the NcoI and EcoRI sites of pSPGag using standard PCR methods. Because M1–2/BR was generated from the HXB2 and BH10 strains of HIV-1 (see Ref. 24.Cimarelli A. Sandin S. Hoglund S. Luban J. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 3046-3057Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar for details), a matched HXB2/BH10 pSP WT Gag plasmid was also generated and found to behave the same as the SF2 Gag plasmid. The FLAG-tagged ABCE1 construct has been described previously (1.Dooher J.E. Lingappa J.R. J. Virol. 2004; 78: 1645-1656Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The plasmid pcDNA-APO3G, which encodes wild-type human Apobec3G with a myc-HisA tag at the C terminus, was generated by Drs. Klaus Strebel and Sandra Kao (54.Kao S. Khan M.A. Miyagi E. Plishka R. Buckler-White A. Strebel K. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 11398-11407Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar) and obtained from the NIH AIDS Research and Reference Reagent Program. To create the GST-ABCE1 plasmid, PCR was used to amplify the previously described ABCE1 coding region (4.Zimmerman C. Klein K.C. Kiser P.K. Singh A.R.S. Firestein B.L. Riba S.C. Lingappa J.R. Nature. 2002; 415: 88-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). This coding region was inserted into the EcoRI and BamHI sites of the pGEX4T-1 vector (Amersham Biosciences). Coding regions of all plasmids generated in this study were confirmed by sequencing. Transfections and Immunoprecipitations—COS-1 cells (from African green monkey) or human 293T cells were transfected in 60-mm dishes with 4 μl of pSVGagRRE-R encoding WT or mutant Gag and 0.5 μl of pCMVRev (32.Lewis N. Williams J. Rekosh D. Hammarskjold M.L. J. Virol. 1990; 64: 1690-1697Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 33.Smith A.J. Cho M.I. Hammarskjold M.L. Rekosh D. J. Virol. 1990; 64: 2743-2750Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) using 24 μl of Lipofectamine (Invitrogen) or 15 μl of Lipo 2000 (Invitrogen). Cells were harvested 45 h post-transfection in 250 μl of Nonidet P-40 buffer (containing 0.625% Nonidet P-40, 10 mm Tris acetate, pH 7.4, 50 mm potassium acetate, and 100 mm NaCl), supplemented with 10 mm EDTA and protease inhibitor mixture for mammalian cells (Sigma). Cell lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 1000 rpm for 10 min in a GH 3.8 rotor using an Allegra 6R centrifuge (Beckman Coulter) and centrifugation in a microcentrifuge at 18,000 × g for 30 s. Clarified lysates were divided equally and subjected to immunoprecipitation using affinity-purified α-ABCE1, rabbit IgG, or affinity-purified α-Apobec3G, as noted, coupled to protein A immobilized on Tris-acryl beads (Pierce) as described previously (1.Dooher J.E. Lingappa J.R. J. Virol. 2004; 78: 1645-1656Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 4.Zimmerman C. Klein K.C. Kiser P.K. Singh A.R.S. Firestein B.L. Riba S.C. Lingappa J.R. Nature. 2002; 415: 88-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). The antibody to Apobec3G (34.Newman E.N. Holmes R.K. Craig H.M. Klein K.C. Lingappa J.R. Malim M.H. Sheehy A.M. Curr. Biol. 2005; 15: 166-170Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar) is directed against the C-terminal 29 amino acids in Apobec3G and was affinity-purified against the peptide immunogen and coupled to Tris-acryl beads in parallel with α-ABCE1. For two constructs (ΔCA and ΔMACA), twice as much cell lysate was input into immunoprecipitations to compensate for reduced expression. Immunoprecipitates were analyzed by SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose (MSI), and subjected to immunoblotting using a monoclonal antibody to the capsid domain of Gag (Dako) as previously described (1.Dooher J.E. Lingappa J.R. J. Virol. 2004; 78: 1645-1656Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Aliquots representing 2% of the cell lysate input were analyzed in parallel with immunoprecipitations on all blots. RNase A Treatment—Clarified lysates of COS-1 or 293T cells, transfected and harvested as above, were treated with RNase A (Qiagen) at the indicated concentrations for 10 min at 37 °C. Lysates were subjected to centrifugation at 18,000 × g for 30 s, and equivalent aliquots of the supernatant were used to program immunoprecipitations. Quantitative RT-PCR—RNA was purified from cell lysates by adding 20 μl of lysate to 200 μl of RNAqueous lysis buffer (Ambion). After mixing, 20 μl of a control lysate (murine EL4 cells; see below) was spiked into the reaction to serve as a control for RNA purification and reverse transcription efficiency. RNA was then isolated per the manufacturer's protocol. Eluates were then treated with rDNase 1 (Ambion) and subsequently subjected to reverse transcription using random DNA primers and Superscript II reverse transcriptase (+RT; Invitrogen). Quantitative PCR was performed using iQ SYBR green supermix (Bio-Rad). Serial dilutions of a corresponding DNA template were run in parallel. A standard curve of CT versus –log[DNA] was calculated, in which the [DNA] of the highest dilution was arbitrarily set at 1, and sample values were extrapolated from the standard curves. Reactions minus RT (–RT) were processed in parallel, and –RT values were subtracted from the +RT values. Values are reported as 0 if the –RT value was greater than the +RT value. Sequences for the primers are 5′-gactatgtagaccggttctat-3′ (forward) and 5′-caaaactcttgccttatggccgggtcctcc-3′ (reverse) for HIV-1 (Gag), 5′-cacggctgcttccagc-3′ (forward) and 5′-ggaaggctggaagagt-3′ (reverse) for human actin, and 5′-cactgccgcatcctct-3′ (forward) and 5′-ggaaggctggccaaga-3′ (reverse) for murine actin. For EL4 cell lysate, EL4 cells were lysed in lysis buffer (RNaqueous; Ambion) at a concentration of 5 × 104 cells/μl. Cell-free Assembly Reactions—In vitro transcription and cell-free translation using wheat germ extract and Tran35S-label (ICN Biochemicals) were performed as described previously (1.Dooher J.E. Lingappa J.R. J. Virol. 2004; 78: 1645-1656Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 2.Lingappa J.R. Hill R.L. Wong M.L. Hegde R.S. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 567-581Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Cell-free reactions were programmed using a mixture of 40% FLAG-ABCE1 transcript and 60% WT or mutant Gag transcripts, as described previously (1.Dooher J.E. Lingappa J.R. J. Virol. 2004; 78: 1645-1656Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Cell-free translations were diluted 300-fold in Nonidet P-40 buffer and subjected to immunoprecipitation with FLAG antibody coupled to beads (Sigma) or mouse IgG (Sigma) with protein G beads (Pierce), as described previously (1.Dooher J.E. Lingappa J.R. J. Virol. 2004; 78: 1645-1656Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitations were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography in parallel with aliquots of total cell-free reaction representing 5% of input. GST-ABCE1 Pull-down Assays—Competent BL21 Escherichia coli (Novagen) were transformed with GST-ABCE1. E. coli were grown to late log phase, induced with 0.5 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (Sigma) for 2 h, centrifuged at 6000 rpm for 10 min in a SLA-1500 rotor (Sorvall), and resuspended in 8 ml of cold phosphate-buffered saline. Phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride was added to 100 mm to the resuspended cells, and six pulses (30 s each) with a sonicator were used to lyse the bacterial cells. Bacterial lysate was clarified by centrifugation in an SS-34 rotor (Sorvall) at 12,000 rpm for 10 min, and 1.5 ml of the resulting supernatant was incubated with 140 μl of packed glutathione-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences) for 45 min at room temperature. Before incubating with cell lysate, GST-ABCE1-bound glutathione-Sepharose was washed three times with 1 ml of phosphate-buffered saline plus 1% Sarcosyl and then twice with 1 ml of phosphate-buffered saline alone. COS-1 cell lysates were harvested in Nonidet P-40 buffer supplemented with 4 mm magnesium acetate and incubated with the washed GST-ABCE1 glutathione-Sepharose columns for 1 h at 4 °C (300 μl of lysate/column). After incubation with COS-1 cell lysate, glutathione-Sepharose was washed five times with 1 ml of Nonidet P-40 wash buffer (0.625% Nonidet P-40, 10 mm Tris acetate, 50 mm potassium acetate, 100 mm NaCl, adjusted to pH 8.5) and twice in 1 ml of the same buffer lacking detergent. Three 1-ml elutions were carried out using buffer containing 10 mm Tris acetate, pH 7.4, 50 mm potassium acetate, 100 mm NaCl, and 40 mm glutathione. Velocity Sedimentation—Calibration of gradients with markers and for calculation of approximate S values has been described previously (2.Lingappa J.R. Hill R.L. Wong M.L. Hegde R.S. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 567-581Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). For analysis of immature released capsids, medium was collected 45 h post-transfection and passed through a 0.22-μm filter. Nonidet P-40 was added to a final concentration of 1% to the filtered media, and 100 μl was layered onto discontinuous step gradients containing 500 μl each of 20, 40, 50, and 75% sucrose in Nonidet P-40 buffer supplemented with 4 mm MgAc and subjected to velocity sedimentation in a TLS55 rotor at 45,000 rpm for 45 min at 4 °C (Beckman Coulter). Fractions (200 μl) were serially collected from the top of the gradient, precipitated with trichloroacetic acid, and analyzed by immunoblotting as described above. For analysis of cellular complexes, 100 μl of cell lysates were layered onto step gradients containing either 500 μl each of 20, 40, 50, and 75% sucrose (for separation of 10/80 S complexes from 500/750 S complexes) or 400 μl each of 5, 10, 15, 30, and 40% sucrose (for separation of 10 S complexes from 80 S complexes) in Nonidet P-40 buffer without MgAc. Gradients were subjected to velocity sedimentation under the same conditions as above. Fractions (150 μl) were collected serially from the top of the gradient, and equivalent amounts of gradient fractions were analyzed by immunoblotting. Quantitation—Quantitation was performed by digitizing immunoblots using an Agfa Duoscan T1200 scanner and Photoshop 5.5 software (Adobe Systems Inc.). Mean band densities were determined and adjusted for band size and background. Dilution standards were performed to ensure that immunoblots were in the linear range for semiquantitative analysis. Progressive Truncation in NC Leads to a Corresponding Reduction in the Gag-ABCE1 Interaction—Previously, we demonstrated that an antiserum directed against endogenous primate ABCE1 (α-ABCE1) co-immunoprecipitates wild-type HIV-1 Gag from primate cells infected with HIV-1 or transfected with an HIV-1 proviral construct. Abundant cellular proteins such as tubulin and actin are not co-immunoprecipitated by α-ABCE1 (4.Zimmerman C. Klein K.C. Kiser P.K. Singh A.R.S. Firestein B.L. Riba S.C. Lingappa J.R. Nature. 2002; 415: 88-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Since earlier findings suggested that the NC domain of Gag is important for the Gag-ABCE1 interaction in mammalian cells (4.Zimmerman C. Klein K.C. Kiser P.K. Singh A.R.S. Firestein B.L. Riba S.C. Lingappa J.R. Nature. 2002; 415: 88-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar), we wanted to identify the features in NC that are required for the Gag-ABCE1 interaction. Therefore, we engineered HIV-1 BH10 Gag mutants that contained progressive truncations in NC (Fig. 1A) into previously described transfection constructs that allow expression of the HIV-1 Gag precursor in the absence of other HIV-1 gene products besides Rev (33.Smith A.J.

In COS-1 cells, transfection with these constructs results in production and release of virion-like particles containing immature HIV-1 capsids (1.Dooher J.E. Lingappa J.R. J.

Whereas most truncation mutants expressed at levels comparable with wild-type Gag in COS-1 cells, mutants that were truncated within Cys-His boxes expressed poorly in COS-1 cells and were not examined further (data not shown). Truncation constructs were expressed in COS-1 cells, and lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation with α-ABCE1 under native conditions. Co-immunoprecipitation of Gag was assessed by immunoblotting"

Domain III (DIII) of WNV envelope protein (E) was postulated to mediate virus binding to the cellular receptor. In this study, the specificity and affinity binding of WNV E DIII protein to αVβ3 integrin was confirmed with co-immunoprecipitation and receptor competition assay. Binding of WNV E DIII protein to αVβ3 integrin induced the phosphorylation of focal adhesion kinase that is required to mediate ligand-receptor internalization into cells. A novel platform was then developed using the atomic force microscopy to measure this specific binding force between WNV E DIII protein and the cellular receptor, αVβ3 integrin. The single protein pair-interacting force measured was in the range of 45 ± 5 piconewtons. This interacting force was highly specific as minimal force was measured in the WNV E DIII protein interaction with αVβ5 integrin molecules and heparan sulfate. These experiments provided an insight to quantitate virus-receptor interaction.

The family Flaviviridae is positive-sense, single-stranded RNA viruses that replicate in the cytoplasm of infected cells. Many members of the three genera (Flavivirus, Pestivirus, and Hepacivirus) belonging to this family are medically important human pathogens.

In 2004 there were 2313 human infections and 79 deaths reported in the United States (2Centers for Disease Control and Prevention MMWR Morb. Mortal Wkly.

Crystallography data on the ectodomain of the Flavivirus E protein reveals three distinct domains: a central domain designated as domain I (DI), an elongated dimerization region designated as domain II (DII), and domain III (DIII), having an immunoglobulin-like constant domain (3Rey F.A. Heinz F.X. Mandl C. Kunz C. Harrison S.C. Nature. 1995; 375: 291-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (1247) Google Scholar). Both DII and DIII of the E protein have been suggested to be important for binding to the cellular receptor (4Ni H. Ryman K.D. Wang H. Saeed M.F. Hull R. Wood D. Minor P.D. Watowich S.J. Barrett A.D.

Chem. 2004; 279: 54533-54541Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar) have recently documented the involvement of αVβ3 integrin in mediating the infectious entry of WNV into host cells. Specific binding between WNV and αVβ3 integrin can be illustrated by functional blocking antibodies against αVβ3 integrin and its subunits. The high antagonistic effect of recombinant WNV DIII protein on WNV infection in both mammalian and mosquito cells has also strongly suggested that DIII of WNV E protein functions as the receptor binding domain and is responsible for the recognition and attachment to the cellular receptor (7Chu J.J. Rajamanonmani R. Li J. Bhuvanakantham R. Lescar J. Ng M.L. J. Gen. Virol. 2005; 86: 405-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). In this study the specific interaction between the DIII of WNV E protein and its cellular receptor (αVβ3 integrin) was first analyzed, and subsequently, atomic force microscope (AFM) was used to directly measure the interaction forces between the viral and cellular proteins. Moreover, we further measured the effects of competitive compounds that interfere with the specific binding between DIII of WNV E protein and αVβ3 integrin. The atomic force microscope (AFM) was primarily designed to act as a metrological tool and provide information on interacting forces. This is in addition to providing many successful surface topographical information in biological studies (9Rotsch C. Braet F. Wisse E. Radmacher M. Cell Biol.

It can also be used to study interactions between two molecules, such as antigens and their corresponding antibodies (16Allen S. Chen X. Davies J. Davies M.C. Dawkes A.C. Edwards J.C. Roberts C.J. Sefton J. Tendler S.J. Williams P.M. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 7457-7463Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). The AFM measures forces by the attachment of a putative interacting partner onto the probe tip and the other interacting partner on the substrate. A schematic diagram of this interaction is shown in Supplemental Fig. 1a. The probe is then brought into close contact to the substrate such that both interacting partners may bind together (during the approach phase; Supplemental Fig. 1b). The probe is then gradually pulled away (retract phase; Supplemental Fig. 1c), and at this stage there is a repulsive force due to the cantilever bending. This bending occurs until the bond between the two partners is broken and that amount of breaking force is translated into interaction forces (Supplemental Fig. 1d). On the retract phase of the force measurement, the maximum cantilever deflection is “related directly to the magnitude of the force required” to break the bonds holding the two interacting partners (16Allen S. Chen X. Davies J. Davies M.C. Dawkes A.C. Edwards J.C. Roberts C.J. Sefton J. Tendler S.J. Williams P.M. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 7457-7463Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). The quantitative amount of force required to separate individual receptor-ligand interactions may be calculated from the generated force curve. This amount of force is representative of the binding affinity between the two biomolecules. The force involved was small (in the range of piconewtons (pN)) since it represented single molecule pair binding. Numerous and extensive control experiments were performed to provide the context in which the validity of the force measurements could be analyzed. This study provides a novel insight to the understanding of the specific interaction between of WNV receptor attachment domain (E DIII protein) and αVβ3 integrin. A platform for efficacy testing of putative anti-viral compounds that can disrupt intermolecular interactions occurring at the initial contact between virus and receptor was also developed. Virus and Cells—Vero cells (America Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA) were maintained in Medium 199 containing 10% inactivated fetal calf serum. The CS-1 and CS-1β3 melanoma cells (kind gifts from Dr. D. Cheresh, Scripps Research Institute) were grown in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% fetal calf serum. West Nile (Sarafend) virus was a generous gift from Prof. Edwin Westaway. WNV was propagated essentially as described previously (11Chu J.J. Ng M.L. Virology. 2003; 312: 458-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Unlabeled and [35S]methionine-labeled flaviviruses were concentrated and purified by sucrose gradient centrifugation as described previously (11Chu J.J. Ng M.L. Virology. 2003; 312: 458-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). A homogenous population of infectious WNV particles was obtained after purification. Immunoprecipitation Assay—CS-1 (non-αVβ3 integrin expressing) and CS-1β3(αVβ3 integrin expressing) cells (1 × 106) were incubated with radiolabeled WNV E DIII protein (1.5 mg/ml) in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for 30 min at 4 °C. The cells were washed twice with high salt buffer (50 mm Tris and 200 mm NaCl with 0.05% Tween 20) to minimize nonspecific binding of proteins. Cells were then lysed in RIP buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, 15 mm NaCl, 1% (w/v) sodium deoxycholate, 1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 0.1% (w/v) SDS), pH 7.4. The cell lysate was then subjected to plasma membrane isolation procedure as essentially described in Chu and Ng (11Chu J.J. Ng M.L. Virology. 2003; 312: 458-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The clarified plasma membrane-extracted fraction was mixed with antibody against αVβ3 integrin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and incubated for 1 h at 4°C. Antibody-antigen complexes were bound to protein A-Sepharose, and the mixtures were washed 3 times in PBS before solubilization by boiling for 3 min in SDS-PAGE sample buffer. The proteins were subjected to SDS-PAGE and detection on x-ray films. Binding to Purified αVβ3 Integrin—Ninety-six-well polystyrene plates were first coated with purified αVβ3 integrin (Chemicon) at the concentration of 150 ng per well in carbonate coating buffer (0.1 m Na2CO3, 0.1 m NaHCO3, pH 9.5). Coating of the integrin onto the wells was performed at 4 °C for 16 h. The integrin-coated wells were then incubated with 1% bovine serum albumin for 2 h at 37 °C to minimize nonspecific binding. Different concentrations of WNV E DIII proteins (in the concentration range of 10–100 μg/ml) were added to these wells before being further incubated for 1 h at 37°C. Excess and nonspecific binding of WNV E DIII protein was removed by washing with high salt buffer (prepared as described above) before the addition of [35S]methionine-labeled WNV (prepared accordingly as previously described in Chu and Ng (11Chu J.J. Ng M.L. Virology. 2003; 312: 458-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar)). To assay for virus binding to αVβ3 integrin, virus was incubated for 1 h at 4°C. Excess or unbound viruses were removed by extensive washing with PBS. The specific radioactivity was determined using the multipurpose liquid scintillation counter, LS6500 (Beckman Instruments). Inhibition of WNV Entry by Soluble WNV E DIII Protein—Soluble WNV E DIII protein or bovine serum albumin (in the concentration range of 25–100 μg/ml) was incubated with CS-1β3 (5 × 106 cells) in cell culture medium at 4 °C for 1 h. Unbound protein molecules were removed by washing the cells three times with PBS. This was followed by incubating with 1 × 104 plaque-forming units/ml of [35S]methionine-radiolabeled WNV for 1 h at 37°C. After the incubation period excess or unbound virus was inactivated using acid glycine buffer at pH 2.8 and removed by washing three times with PBS. The cells were lysed with 1% SDS, and the specific radioactivity was determined. AFM and Probes—The AFM used was the Digital Instruments MultiMode Scanning Probe Microscope with the Nanoscope IV controller. The probes used were Sharpened Silicon Nitride Probes (NP-S) from Veeco Instruments. The software version used in this study was Nanoscope 6.11r1 (Veeco). Sample Preparation for Force Interaction Measurements—The proteins used in this study included integrin αVβ3 (Chemicon International), integrin αVβ5 (Chemicon International), and WNV E DIII protein. The integrins αVβ3 and αVβ5 were diluted to a final concentration of 50 μg/ml, whereas the WNV E DIII protein was diluted to a final concentration of 50 μg/ml. New silicon wafers and Silicon nitride probes (NP-S-Veeco) were first cleaned by sonication (Fisher) at 5 cycles at 5-μm amplitude for 10 s in methanol (Merck) and then for 5 cycles at 5-μm amplitude for 10 s in type 1 grade reagent water (NANOpure). The surfaces of the materials were then oxidized using ultraviolet radiation (Bioforce) for 1 min. The oxidized wafers and probes were then immediately transferred to a 1.5% v/v solution of 3-aminopropyldimethylethoxysilane (Sigma) in toluene for 2 h at room temperature. After silanization, the wafers and probes were again sonicated in methanol (Merck) and type-1 grade reagent water (NANOpure) for 5 cycles at a 5-μm amplitude for 10 s to remove excess and unbound silane. These amino-functionalized wafers and probes were then activated by incubating the silanized wafers and probes in 10% v/v solution of glutaraldehyde in PBS, pH 7.4, for 1 h at room temperature. The wafers and probes were then washed with type-1 grade reagent water (NANOpure) to remove excess glutaraldehyde. Proteins in solution were introduced onto the activated wafers and probes before incubation for 1 h at room temperature. The proteins were covalently bound to the functionalized amino groups on the wafers and probes. These were then rinsed with type-1 grade reagent water (NANOpure) and PBS to remove loosely bound biological material. These proteins were WNV cellular receptor integrin αVβ3 (50 μg/ml), integrin αVβ5 (50 μg/ml), heparan sulfate (50 μg/ml), dengue virus E DIII protein (50 μg/ml), and WNV E DIII protein (50 μg/ml). Although these samples on the silicon wafers and probes could be stored at 4 °C (26Allen S. Davies J. Davies M.C. Dawkes A.C. Roberts C.J. Tendler S.J. Williams P.M. Biochem. J. 1999; 341: 173-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), they were used immediately after processing for this study. Force Interaction Measurements—After samples were prepared, they were placed into the AFM, and the laser was aligned to the probe cantilever. The AFM was set in Contact mode, and set points and gains were adjusted as according to the Scanning Probe Microscope protocol instructions. The probe was engaged onto the sample in “scan” mode. The software was then shifted to “ramp” mode, in which the Ramp Parm List was available to adjust parameters for force studies. The probe was brought into continuous cycles of ramp, and the generated force curves were captured at 12 different points on the sample at 8 force curves per point. Each experiment was repeated on 3 different days. It was necessary to calibrate deflection sensitivity after capturing a force curve. Deflection sensitivity was dependent on several factors, such as the position of the laser spot on the cantilever; therefore, it must be calibrated each time the probe is changed or the laser spot is shifted. Once a force curve is captured, the file containing the force curve is opened, and cursors are placed such that they surround the contact (steepest) portion of the graph. From this gradient the software is able to update the deflection sensitivity and apply it to all the following force curves obtained, and subsequent force curves can be used to quantitate force interactions between proteins on the tip and on the substrate. Force interactions were taken using the combinations of molecules attached to probe and substrate, shown in Table 1.TABLE 1Combinations of molecules attached to probe and substrateAttached to probeAttached to substrateWNV E DIII proteinWNV E DIII protein3-AminopropyldimethylethoxysilaneWNV E DIII protein3-Aminopropyldimethylethoxysilane activated with glutaraldehydeWNV E DIII proteinαV β3 integrinαV β3 integrinWNV E DIII proteinWNV E DIII proteinHeparan sulfateDengue virus E DIII proteinHeparan sulfateWNV E protein DIIIαV β5 integrin Open table in a new tab The first three combinations in Table 1 were controls to ensure that the WNV E DIII protein did not interact non-specifically with the silicon wafer, the silanized silicon wafer, and the activated silanized silicon wafer, respectively. The fourth combination was the test experiment studying the force interactions between WNV E DIII protein and αVβ3 integrin. The fifth combination was to provide a switch in the position of the interacting proteins in order to provide better fidelity for the force measurements. The sixth and seventh combinations were carried out to assess if the E DIII proteins of WNV and dengue virus interacts with heparan sulfate, respectively. The eighth combination was to ensure that WNV E protein DIII did not interact with another integrin molecule (αVβ5). Also, as a further control, the interaction between WNV E DIII protein and αVβ3 integrin was disrupted by adding αVβ3 integrin (50 μg/ml) into the liquid buffer during force interaction studies. This provided a further level of control experiment to ensure the fidelity of the force interaction studies. It is also to demonstrate a proof -of-concept that this method can indeed serve as a platform for quantitative testing of anti-viral drugs that prevent this essential recognition/interaction stage of WNV with the cellular receptor during infection. Recombinant WNV E DIII Protein Interacts with αVβ3 Integrin and Prevents WNV Binding and Entry—In our recent studies, recombinant WNV E DIII protein was demonstrated to bind to surface of cells and prevent WNV infection substantially (7Chu J.J. Rajamanonmani R. Li J. Bhuvanakantham R. Lescar J. Ng M.L. J. Gen. Virol. 2005; 86: 405-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). The αVβ3 integrin was identified as the cellular receptor that mediates the infectious entry of WNV into Vero cells (8Chu J.J. Ng M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 54533-54541Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Therefore, in the first part of this study the specific binding of WNV E DIII protein to αVβ3 integrin was first analyzed. A virus-receptor competitive binding assay was carried out to investigate the specificity of WNV E DIII protein binding to αVβ3 integrin. The inhibition of WNV binding to αVβ3 integrin precoated onto the 96-well plates in the presence of different concentration of recombinant WNV E DIII protein was assessed. Binding of WNV to αVβ3 integrin was reduced in a dosage-dependent manner in the presence of recombinant WNV E DIII protein as shown in Fig. 1a. To affirm the specific binding of WNV E DIII protein with αVβ3 integrin, immunoprecipitation was performed with antibodies specific for αVβ3 integrin. The αVβ3 integrin-expressing CS-1 cell line (CS-1β3) and non-αVβ3 integrin-expressing cell line (CS-1) were used for this part of the study. Recombinant WNV E DIII protein was allowed to interact with CS-1β3 or CS-1 cells for 30 min at 4 °C. Low temperature incubation prevents internalization of WNV E DIII protein-αVβ3 integrin complexes into cells. The cells were then lysed, and the plasma membrane fraction was isolated according to Chu and Ng (11Chu J.J. Ng M.L. Virology. 2003; 312: 458-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The radiolabeled WNV E DIII protein was detected after immunoprecipitation with antibody to αVβ3 integrin in the plasma membrane fraction of CS-1β3 (Fig. 1b, lane 1). In contrast, WNV E DIII protein was not detected after immunoprecipitation with antibody to αVβ3 integrin in the plasma membrane fraction of CS-1 (non-αVβ3 integrin expression; Fig. 1b, lane 2). The specificity of the antibody for immunoprecipitation was assessed by reacting with either CS-1β3 (Fig. 1b, lane 3) or CS-1 (Fig. 1b, lane 4) plasma membrane fraction that was not reacted with WNV E DIII protein. The band for WNV E DIII protein was not detected in these lanes. Similarly, we assessed the inhibitory effects of WNV E DIII protein on the infectious entry of WNV into CS-1β3 cells. In the presence of increasing concentrations of recombinant WNV E DIII protein, the infectious entry of WNV into CS-1β3 cells was significantly inhibited in a dosage-dependent manner (Fig. 1c). In the presence of high concentration of WNV E DIII proteins (100 μg/ml), the infectious entry of WNV was inhibited by more than 75% (Fig. 1c). Incubation of cells with bovine serum albumin had minimal effect on the entry of WNV. Therefore, these results showed that WNV E DIII protein binds specifically to αVβ3 integrin. The interaction of WNV with αVβ3 integrin was previously shown to activate focal adhesion kinase in mediating the specific downstream signals for virus internalization into cells. In this part of the study we further assessed whether WNV E DIII protein is the specific domain on the WNV E protein that can activate focal adhesion kinase. WNV E DIII protein added at the concentrations of 50 and 100 μg/ml were observed to induce the phosphorylation of focal adhesion kinase (Fig. 1d, lanes 2 and 3, respectively). Serum-starved cells were used as the negative control (Fig. 1d, lane 1), whereas lysophosphatidic acid was used as a positive control to induced phosphorylation of focal adhesion kinase (Fig. 1d, lane 4). To ensure that equal amounts of cellular proteins were loaded into each of the wells, the membrane was stripped and reprobed with antibody against actin. Equal quantities of actin were observed throughout the lanes (Fig. 1e). WNV E DIII protein was shown to specifically bind the cellular receptor αVβ3 integrin and is also responsible for activating focal adhesion kinase, which is necessary to mediate subsequent entry of WNV into cells. Measurement of WNV E DIII Protein-αVβ3 Integrin Binding Force—The above results confirmed that the WNV E DIII protein is an attractive antiviral target site. Any compound that can disrupt the binding of the E DIII protein with αVβ3 integrin will effectively prevent virus infection in the host. Therefore, the study continued to develop a platform that can subsequently be used for screening the efficacy of potential anti-viral compounds. The experimental design is to optimize the AFM metrological capability to accurately measure the binding force between the E DIII protein and αVβ3 integrin under physiological condition. This binding force will act as the benchmark parameter for future anti-viral compound screening. Any depletion of this force will indicate the effectiveness of the test compound in disrupting this specific interaction. Exhaustive control experiments were essential to ensure the validity of the forces studied, as this is the first study of its kind for this virus-receptor interaction system. The first control was the interactions between WNV E DIII protein on the probe and untreated silicon wafers. A force curve in which no interaction occurred between the probe and the substrate is shown in Fig. 2a. The deflection of the probe is plotted against the distance traveled by the probe toward and away from the substrate. The line (read from left to right) in the curve showed the movement of the probe toward the substrate and the corresponding positive deflection of the probe as it contacts the silicon wafer. The line (read from right to left) showed the movement of the probe as it retracts from the substrate as well as the restoration of probe deflection during this event. Because both the lines intersected each other, this directly translated to the fact that the deflection of the probe was exactly the same in the retract stage as it approaches the stage. Fig. 2b shows a representative example of a histogram obtained from the summation of the results from three independent experiments. As seen from the histogram, most of the force curves obtained fell into the 0–5-pN bin, thus showing that negligible interactions took place between probe and substrate. The histogram produced from the data garnered in this showed that there was little interaction between the WNV E protein domain III on the probe and the silicon wafer substrate. This data would validate the subsequent data of force interactions on the test experiments. Further controls included interactions between WNV E DIII protein on the probe and silanized (post-sonication, oxidation, and incubation with silane) silicon wafers, and interactions between WNV E DIII protein on the probe and activated silanized silicon wafers (post-sonication, oxidation and incubation with silane and glutaraldehyde) were measured. This portion of the study was to observe if there were any nonspecific binding forces between the probe and wafer at various stages of functionalization. All the series of the control experiments yielded the same results as in Fig. 2. This showed that the developed system is a valid and reliable platform for measuring the specific binding force between WNV E DIII protein and αVβ3 integrin. To determine and quantify the specific binding forces between WNV E DIII protein and αVβ3 integrin, this portion of the study was conducted in two parts. The first was with the WNV E DIII protein on the probe and the αVβ3 integrin on the silicon wafer substrate. The second part was with the WNV E DIII protein on the silicon wafer substrate and the αVβ3 integrin on the probe. This was to ensure that these force interaction studies took into account the possible influence of the position (probe or substrate) of the interacting protein pair. A typical force curve exhibiting binding forces between the protein on the probe and the protein on the surface is shown in Fig. 3a. The WNV E DIII protein was coated onto the probe and αVβ3 integrin on the silicon wafer substrate. In this case, a spring constant (k) of 0.040 (measured resonance frequency = 17.66 kHz) and a sensitivity of 98.2 nm/V was applied to the interactions. The spring constant (k) and deflection sensitivity were directly relayed to the software as it captured the force curves. The retraction speed was set at 308 nm/s. From the resulting force curve, the specific binding force between WNV E DIII protein and αVβ3 integrin was 45 pN (curve 2). The general trend for the first part of this study was illustrated in the histogram shown in Fig. 3b. More specifically, this implied that using this method with the designated protein arrangement (WNV E DIII protein was on probe and αVβ3 integrin was on silicon wafer), the majority of the binding force between single protein molecule was measured at 45 ± 5pN. Fig. 4 shows the results with the position of the two proteins switched (WNV E DIII protein was attached to the wafer, and αVβ3 integrin was bound to the probe). Similarly, the binding force for single molecule interaction between WNV E DIII protein and αVβ3 integrin was still determined to be 45 ± 5 pN. Even by varying the position of the proteins (between the probe and substrate), the frequency of the binding force at a magnitude of 45 ± 5 pN was similar to Fig. 3b. However, it was observed that there was a much higher frequency of non-interactions (0 pN) in this case when the αVβ3 integrin was on the probe and WNV E DIII protein on the silicon wafer substrate. A possible explanation could be that the reversal of the protein positions may have resulted in a sparser distribution of WNV E DIII protein on the substrate, thus reducing the chances of protein pairs forming. It was interesting to observe the trends in the binding force measurements. Occasionally there were bindings at abnormally large magnitude, an example of which can be seen here in Fig. 5a. Here, the force curve (curve 2) was measured to be 83 pN (approximately 2 × 45 pN). In Fig. 5b, even larger force measurement was obtained to be 124 pN (approximately 3 × 45 pN). The cumulative clusters of larger force measurements were also illustrated in the histogram in Fig. 4. After the postulation by Allen et al. (16Allen S. Chen X. Davies J. Davies M.C. Dawkes A.C. Edwards J.C. Roberts C.J. Sefton J. Tendler S.J. Williams P.M. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 7457-7463Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar), these forces could represent the binding of multiple WNV E DIII protein and αVβ3 integrin pairs. The forces measured in Fig. 5a, thus, corresponded to the separation of two such interactions, and those in Fig. 5b corresponded to three protein pair inte"

Specific proteins are activated by UVB and then trigger signal transduction pathways that lead to cellular responses. An alteration of these signaling molecules is thought to be a fundamental event in tumor promotion by UVB irradiation. RhoB, encoding a small GTPase has been identified as a DNA damage-inducible gene. RhoB is involved in epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor trafficking, cytoskeletal organization, cell transformation, and survival. We have analyzed the regulation of RhoB and elucidated its role in the cellular response of HaCaT keratinocytes to relevant environmental UVB irradiation. We report here that the activated GTP-bound form of RhoB is increased rapidly within 5 min of exposure to UVB, and then RhoB protein levels increased concomitantly with EGF receptor (EGFR) activation. Inhibition of UVB-induced EGFR activation prevents RhoB protein expression and AKT phosphorylation but not the early activation of RhoB. Blocking UVB-induced RhoB expression with specific small interfering RNAs inhibits AKT and glycogen synthase kinase-3β phosphorylation through inhibition of EGFR expression. Moreover, down-regulation of RhoB potentiates UVB-induced cell apoptosis. In contrast, RhoB overexpression protects keratinocytes against UVB-induced apoptosis. These results indicated that RhoB is regulated upon UVB exposure by a two-step process consisting of an early EGFR-independent RhoB activation followed by an EGFR-dependent induction of RhoB expression. Moreover, we have demonstrated that RhoB is essential in regulating keratinocyte cell survival after UVB exposure, suggesting its potential role in photocarcinogenesis.

Among solar UV radiation that reaches the surface of the earth, UVB wavelengths are the most energetic. Directly absorbed by DNA and proteins, they account for much of the damaging biological effects of UV irradiation including premature skin aging and cancer (1Fisher G.J. Datta S.C. Talwar H.S. Wang Z.Q. Varani J. Kang S. Voorhees J.J. Nature. 1996; 379: 335-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (1172) Google Scholar). UVB acts as a carcinogen through both DNA damage and epigenetic effects. The initiation process in UVB-induced skin carcinogenesis involves UV light-induced DNA damage such as p53 or HA-ras mutations and represents an irreversible process (reviewed in Ref. 2Matsumura Y. Ananthaswamy H.N. Front Biosci. 2002; 7: d765-d783Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). By contrast, UVB-mediated skin tumor promotion involves the clonal expansion of initiated cells through activation of numerous signal transduction pathways, such as the MAPK 2The abbreviations used are: MAPKmitogen-activated protein kinaseERKextracellular signal-regulated kinaseEGFepidermal growth factorEGFREGF receptorsiRNAsmall interfering RNAGSKglycogen synthase kinasePI3kphosphatidylinositol 3-kinaseGEFguanine nucleotide exchange factorYFPyellow fluorescent proteinEYFPenhanced YFPDAPI4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindoleELISAenzyme-linked immunosorbent assayGSTglutathione S-transferasedTdithymidinePARPpoly(ADP-ribose) polymeraseTRBDrhotekin rho binding domain.2The abbreviations used are: MAPKmitogen-activated protein kinaseERKextracellular signal-regulated kinaseEGFepidermal growth factorEGFREGF receptorsiRNAsmall interfering RNAGSKglycogen synthase kinasePI3kphosphatidylinositol 3-kinaseGEFguanine nucleotide exchange factorYFPyellow fluorescent proteinEYFPenhanced YFPDAPI4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindoleELISAenzyme-linked immunosorbent assayGSTglutathione S-transferasedTdithymidinePARPpoly(ADP-ribose) polymeraseTRBDrhotekin rho binding domain. signaling cascades that coordinate cell cycle arrest, regulation of DNA repair, and apoptosis (3Rittie L.

It appears evident that after UVB exposure, the cell needs to integrate two opposing responses, with the final fate of keratinocytes depending on the balance between pro- and anti-apoptotic pathways. On the one hand, eliminating cells with excessive DNA damage is essential to preserve the health of the skin. UV-induced apoptosis plays this role through a complex mechanism triggered in three independent ways, via DNA damage-induced activation of caspases 9 and 3, through the membrane death receptor CD95 activation of caspases 8 and 3, and via cytochrome c release induced by the generation of reactive oxygen species (4Kulms D. Schwarz T. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2002; 64: 837-841Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). On the other hand, since human skin is chronically exposed to UV irradiation, protection of suprabasal cells is critical for maintenance of epidermal integrity and barrier function. This is probably the reason why the UVB response also includes cell survival and proliferation. UVB triggers these processes by activating receptors to various growth factors and cytokines (5Bender K. Blattner C. Knebel A. Iordanov M. Herrlich P. Rahmsdorf H.J. J. Photochem. Photobiol. B Biol. 1997; 37: 1-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). In particular, UVB activates epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), which in turn activates AKT through a phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)-dependent pathway. The survival-promoting function of PI3K-AKT in human keratinocytes exposed to UV irradiation results from the inhibition of caspases-3, -8, and -9 (6Wang H.Q. Quan T. He T. Franke T.F. Voorhees J.J. Fisher G.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 45737-45745Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) and from the inactivation of GSK-3β, which negatively regulates numerous transcriptional factors. The influence of epigenetic effects of chronic UV exposure is of major significance since disruption of this equilibrium promotes skin cancer. Finding new regulators of this complex response is therefore essential and will likely be critical for the development of effective prevention and intervention strategies for human skin cancer. RhoB is a member of the Rho family of small GTPases, including Cdc42, Rac, RhoA, and RhoC. These proteins influence several important processes in cancer, including cell transformation, survival, invasion, and metastasis, through their involvement in a wide spectrum of cellular processes such as regulation of cytoskeletal organization, adhesion, motility, vesicle transport, cell cycle progression, cytokinesis, and transcription regulation (7Etienne-Manneville S. Hall A. Nature. 2002; 420: 629-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (3768) Google Scholar, 8Sahai E. Marshall C.J. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 133-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (1207) Google Scholar). Although some GTPase family members, such as RhoA, Rac1, and Cdc42, promote oncogenesis, invasion, and metastasis, there is emerging evidence that points to a tumor-suppressive role for RhoB (9Chen Z.

Besides the fact that ectopic expression of RhoB inhibits tumor growth (9Chen Z. Sun J. Pradines A. Favre G. Adnane J. Sebti S.M. J. Biol.

RhoB cycles between an inactive GDP and an active GTP-bound state that is controlled by three regulators: the guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs), the GTPase-activating proteins, and the guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitors. RhoB is known to be induced by growth factors such as platelet-derived growth factor and EGF (20de Cremoux P. Gauville C. Closson V. Linares G. Calvo F. Tavitian A. Olofsson B. Int. J.

RhoB is also known to be up-regulated in response to cellular stresses such as ischemia (24Trapp T. Korhonen L. Besselmann M. Martinez R. Mercer E.A. Lindholm D. Mol.

Recent evidence indicates that RhoB is required for the apoptotic response to several cytotoxic agents (11Liu A. Cerniglia G.J. Bernhard E.J. Prendergast G.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Cell Res. 2005; 304: 354-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). However, little or nothing is known of the cellular consequences of the induction of RhoB in response to UV irradiation. Until now, the data available only partially address the question of RhoB regulation, specifically following environmentally relevant UVB irradiation. We have shown that, after such UVB exposure, RhoB is regulated by a two-step mechanism involving activation and expression of the RhoB protein. Moreover, RhoB is essential for UVB-induced cell survival and for the EGFR-mediated survival signaling pathway. Cell Culture and UV Irradiation—Spontaneously immortalized human keratinocyte cells (HaCaT cells) were cultured routinely in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum (Invitrogen) at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere and 95% humidity. For UVB irradiation, HaCaT cells were irradiated in phosphate-buffered saline using a UVB lamp RMX3W system (312 nm) from BioSun (Vilber Lourmat). For all experiments, cells were exposed to an UVB dose of 400 J/m2, which corresponds to two minimal erythema doses and reproduces relevant environmental conditions. RhoB Activity Assay—RhoB activity was assayed using the RhoA activation assay of Ren and Schwartz (28Ren X.D. Schwartz M.A. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 325: 264-272Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) adapted for RhoB by Gampel and Mellor (22Gampel A. Mellor H. Biochem. J. 2002; 366: 393-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Briefly, the Rho binding domain of rothekin, an effector of Rho proteins that selectively binds to the GTP-loaded form, was expressed as a recombinant fusion with GST in Escherichia coli and purified through binding to GSH-Sepharose beads. At various times after exposure, cells were lysed by scraping on ice and vigorous mixing in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 500 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2,1% Triton X-100, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 10 mm p-nitrophenyl phosphate, 2 mm Na3VO4, 20 mm NaF, 1× protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma)). After preclearing by centrifugation (12,500 rpm, 5 min), the lysates were combined with 30 μl of GST-TRBD beads and rotated for 45 min at 4 °C. An aliquot from each lysate was removed as a control for equivalent input into the assay. Beads were washed twice with ice-cold wash buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 500 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 1% Triton X-100). Bound protein was eluted from the beads with SDS-PAGE sample buffer at 95 °C. RhoB protein was analyzed by immunoblot. Immunoblot Analysis of Proteins—Cells were lysed in radioimmune precipitation buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 5 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10 mm p-nitrophenyl phosphate, 2 mm Na3VO4, 20 mm NaF, 1× protease inhibitor mixture) for 30 min on ice and cleared by centrifugation (14,000 rpm, 10 min). Protein concentration was determined using the BCA assay (Pierce). Proteins were resolved on SDS-PAGE with the appropriate acrylamide concentration (7.5-12.5%). The antibodies against RhoB (119), RhoA (119), p38 (N-20), phospho-EGFR (Tyr-1173), and EGFR (1005) were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. The antibodies against PARP, phospho-AKT (Ser-472/Ser-473/Ser-474), and AKT were obtained from BD Biosciences. The antibodies against phospho-p38 (Thr-180/Thr-182), phospho-GSK-3β (Ser-9), and GSK-3β were obtained from Cell Signaling Technology. The β-actin antibody was obtained for Chemicon. The RhoC antibody was a kind gift from Sophia D. Merajver (Ann Arbor, MI). RNA Extraction and cDNA Synthesis—Cells plated in 35-mm dishes were grown until 80% confluent and UVB-irradiated. At various times after irradiations, total RNA was isolated by TRIzol reagent (Sigma) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Extracted RNA was quantified using RNA 6000 Nano LabChip on 2100 Bioanalyzer platform (Agilent Technologies Inc., Palo Alto, CA). 2 μg RNA of each sample was then reverse-transcripted using random primers and SuperScript II reverse transcriptase kit (Invitrogen). Real-time PCR—Quantitative real-time PCR was performed with an iCycler iQ real-time PCR detection system (Bio-Rad) using SYBR Green JumpStart Taq ReadyMix (Sigma) following the manufacturer's instructions. The relative-fold changes in RhoB mRNA expression were calculated according to a ΔΔCt method (29Livak K.J. Schmittgen T.D. Methods (Orlando). 2001; 25: 402-408Crossref Scopus (116613) Google Scholar) normalized against the β-2-microglobulin gene (β2M). siRNA Treatment—Two siRNAs against human RhoB were designed using criteria developed by Reynolds et al. (30Reynolds A. Leake D. Boese Q. Scaringe S. Marshall W.S. Khvorova A. Nat. Biotechnol. 2004; 22: 326-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (1612) Google Scholar), synthesized as synthetic oligonucleotides (Dharmacon Research), and annealed to form a short double-stranded RNA with a 3′-dithymidine overhang; siRNA RhoB 1, 5′-CCGTCTTCGAGAACTATGTdTdT-3′; and siRNA RhoB 2, 5′-CTATGTGGCCGACATTGAGdTdT-3′. As an siRNA control, we used nonspecific control VIII provided by Dharmacon Research. Transfections of siRNAs (10 nm) were performed using Oligofectamine™ and Opti-MEM media (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions on cells at 30-50% confluency in 60-mm cell culture dishes and incubated for 24 h prior to experiments. Study of RhoB Promoter Activity—The 1,876-bp MluI/XhoI fragment corresponding to RhoB promoter sequence was inserted into pGL3-Basic (Promega) upstream of the Firefly luciferase gene and co-transfected with a pRL-CMV vector (Promega) as an internal control (Renilla luciferase under the control of a cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter) as described previously (31Tovar D. Faye J.C. Favre G. Genomics. 2003; 81: 525-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). RhoB Overexpression Experiments—The coding region of RhoB was subcloned into pEYFP-C1 vector (Clontech) as a KpnI/BamH1 fragment. Empty pEYFP-C1 vector was used as a control. HaCaT cells were transfected with 4 μg of RhoB-YFP construct or empty vector using Lipofectamine 2000™ method (Invitrogen). DAPI Staining—HaCaT cells were seeded on sterilized 22 × 22-mm coverslips in 35-mm dishes. At various times after irradiation, cells were fixed in a 0.3% formaldehyde solution for 20 min and then washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline. Next, coverslips were mounted on slides with Mowiol solution containing 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI). DAPI staining was detected by fluorescence microscopy. Detection of Cell Death by ELISA—To evaluate the UVB-induced apoptosis, we used the cell death detection ELISAPLUS kit (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's instructions. UVB Induces RhoB GTP Binding and Expression in Human Keratinocytes—We investigated the effects of UVB irradiation on RhoB GTP binding by a pull-down assay. The level of GTP-bound RhoB increased rapidly, essentially doubling within 5 min of UVB exposure and achieving a 3.5-fold increase after 30 min, at which the level plateaued (Fig. 1, A and B). This high level of RhoB-GTP persisted until 16 h after irradiation and returned to basal levels after 24 h (data not shown). The GTP-RhoB/total RhoB ratio increased transiently, reaching a maximum between 30 and 60 min after UVB irradiation (Fig. 1B) and then returning to basal level 4 h later (data not shown). In addition, the RhoB protein expression was induced 1 h after UVB exposure (Fig. 1A), reached a maximum at about 4 h, and maintained this level until 16 h after irradiation before returning to basal levels by 24 h (Fig. 1, C and D). Previous studies showed that RhoB induction after UVC irradiation was mediated through induction of its promoter activity (32Fritz G. Kaina B. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 792-798Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) and through stabilization of its mRNA (25Westmark C.J. Bartleson V.B. Malter J.S. Oncogene. 2005; 24: 502-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). After UVB exposure, we have shown an increase in RhoB mRNA level (a 3.5-fold maximal increase within 60 min) (Fig. 2A). This up-regulation of RhoB mRNA appeared to be triggered by both transcriptional and post-transcriptional mechanisms. On the one hand, UVB irradiation induced a 3.3-fold increase in RhoB promoter activity (Fig. 2B). On the other hand, the decay rate of RhoB mRNA under actinomycin D treatment (a transcription inhibitor) was slowed down after UVB irradiation. There was a greater than 4-fold increase in the half-life of RhoB, which increased from 60 min to more than 240 min when cells were UVB-irradiated as shown in Fig. 2C. Overall these data show that RhoB up-regulation after UVB exposure is driven by a two-step mechanism, the first step consisting of an early transient up-activation of the basal protein pool of RhoB followed by a second step involving a strong increase in RhoB protein expression mediated by both transcriptional and post-transcriptional mechanisms. RhoB Is Up-regulated through Both EGFR-dependent and EGFR-independent Pathways—Since RhoB has been reported as being regulated by EGF (20de Cremoux P. Gauville C. Closson V. Linares G. Calvo F. Tavitian A. Olofsson B. Int. J. Cancer. 1994; 59: 408-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 22Gampel A. Mellor H. Biochem. J. 2002; 366: 393-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), we investigated whether the known UVB-induced EGFR activation (33Miller C.C. Hale P. Pentland A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3529-3533Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) might trigger RhoB activation and expression. Initially, we compared the kinetics of EGFR phosphorylation by UVB and by EGF in HaCaT cells. As expected, data shown in Fig. 3, A and B, indicate that EGF induced a strong activation of both EGFR and RhoB as rapidly as 15 min. These activations can be prevented by the potent and selective inhibitor of EGFR phosphorylation, ZD1839. In contrast, UVB induced a weak EGFR phosphorylation starting only 1 h after irradiation (Fig. 3, A and B), whereas they stimulated RhoB activation within 15 min (Figs. 1A and 3B). These observations suggest that the early UVB-induced activation of RhoB is independent of EGFR phosphorylation. We have confirmed this by showing that ZD1839 (20 μm) as well as AG1478 (10 μm), another specific inhibitor of EGFR phosphorylation, did not prevent the UVB-induced early activation of RhoB (Fig. 3B and supplemental Fig. 7). Interestingly, inhibition of EGFR by ZD1839, AG1478, or siRNA treatments fully inhibited the stimulation of RhoB expression 4 h after UVB exposure (Fig. 3C and Supplemental Fig. 8). These results suggest a critical role for EGFR activation in the regulation of RhoB expression following UVB exposure. These data therefore provide evidence that although the initial UVB-induced RhoB activation is independent of EGFR activation, the late protein induction is dependent on such activation. RhoB Is Crucial for the UVB-induced Apoptotic Response—We addressed the consequences of RhoB up-regulation to the apoptotic response to UVB irradiation of HaCaT cells by specific down-regulation of protein expression using specific RNA interference. Initially, we assessed the efficiency of RhoB silencing. Following a 24-h treatment of HaCaT cells with 10 nm of RhoB siRNA, cells were UVB-irradiated, and subsequent RhoB expression was analyzed. As shown in Fig. 4A, RhoB siRNA fully abolished the UVB-induced RhoB expression, whereas neither RhoA nor RhoC expression is altered by RhoB siRNA. This demonstrates the high specificity of the RhoB siRNA used. Moreover, one can notice that UVB irradiation did not modify RhoA and RhoC expression, underlining the fact that, among other Rho proteins, only RhoB is a UVB-regulated gene. Moreover, RhoB siRNA treatment also prevented the early GTP-RhoB increase within 15 min of UVB exposure (Fig. 4B), consequently inhibiting its first activation step. Apoptotic cell death following UVB irradiation was analyzed by DAPI staining of nuclei. As shown in Fig. 4, C and D, whereas inhibition of RhoB expression in control cells did not induce any effects, inhibition of RhoB up-regulation after UVB irradiation by siRNA induced a 3-fold increase in nuclear DNA condensation observed 16 h following UVB exposure. RhoB siRNA treatment also significantly accelerated PARP cleavage induced by UVB, which was detectable as early as 4 h after irradiation and reached a maximum at 16 h (Fig. 4E). These results have been consolidated using a method measuring nucleosomal particles produced by endonuclease cleavage of DNA during apoptosis (34Walker P.R. Sikorska M. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1997; 75: 287-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). RhoB siRNA treatment significantly increased the release of oligonucleosomes detected 16 h after UVB exposure (Fig. 4F). Each of the above experiments has been confirmed using the second siRNA sequence against RhoB described under “Experimental Procedures” (supplemental Fig. 9). To confirm the involvement of RhoB in the UVB response, we analyzed the effect of RhoB overexpression on UVB-induced apoptosis. HaCaT cells were transiently transfected either with the pEYFP-C1 vector encoding YFP as a control or with the pEYFP coding RhoB in fusion with YFP. Then, apoptosis was analyzed by DAPI staining 16 h after UVB irradiation of the transfected cells. The rate of apoptosis was specifically quantitated in green fluorescent cells and compared with that of mock-transfected cells. As shown in Fig. 5, A and B, whereas expression of YFP did not modify the rate of UVB-induced apoptosis, expression of YFP-RhoB significantly reduced the number of apoptotic cells 16 h after UVB exposure from 20% ± 2.2 to 5% ± 0.9 cells. Overall these results demonstrate that RhoB is crucial to protect human keratinocytes from UVB-induced apoptotic cell death and suggest that one of the consequences of RhoB up-regulation may be to increase the survival of irradiated cells. RhoB Controls UVB-induced Phosphorylation of AKT through EGFR Expression—We examined the involvement of RhoB in p38 and AKT UVB-induced phosphorylation. Fig. 6A shows that siRNA down-regulation of RhoB had no effect on the UVB-induced phosphorylation of p38 at either of the time points studied. In contrast, RhoB down-regulation prevented UVB-induced AKT phosphorylation at 4 h, although not at 15 min, after irradiation. We then examined the phosphorylation of GSK-3β, which is a substrate for activated AKT. As expected, RhoB silencing prevented GSK-3β phosphorylation on Ser-9 in the same way. These data demonstrate that UVB exposure induces an early RhoB- and EGFR-independent AKT activation (Figs. 3B and 6) and a late RhoB- and EGFR-dependent AKT activation (Figs. 3C and 6 and supplemental Fig. 10). We assessed whether RhoB controls the EGFR-dependent AKT activation through EGFR regulation. As shown in Fig. 6B, down-regulation of RhoB expression prevents both UVB-induced EGFR phosphorylation and protein expression. The ratio of phosphorylated-EGFR/total-EGFR was not modified by siRNA treatment (0.85 versus 0.84 at 4 h and 0.71 versus 0.77 at 6 h), suggesting that phosphorylated EGFR decrease is due to the down-regulation of the protein expression. Overall these data showed that RhoB plays a critical role in the UVB-induced AKT survival pathway by controlling EGFR expression. Consistent with this, inhibition of EGFR phosphorylation by ZD1839 in RhoB down-regulated HaCaT cells did not increase UVB-induced apoptosis (data not shown). This study has provided evidence that the small GTPase RhoB is strongly up-regulated in human keratinocytes by environmentally relevant UVB irradiation through a two-step process consisting of an early EGFR-independent RhoB activation followed by an EGFR-dependent induction of RhoB expression. Beyond these observations, this work highlighted the protective role of this UVB-induced RhoB up-regulation in human keratinocytes, through a regulatory loop between EGFR and RhoB, which mediates AKT survival pathway. The first step of RhoB regulation starts within a few minutes after irradiation and consists of a 3-fold increase in the RhoB-GTP/RhoB ratio. Although regulation of RhoB expression has been largely documented, this classical mode of Rho-GTPase regulation has never been described for RhoB in response to genotoxic stress. Rho-GDP/GTP cycling notably depends on the activity of Rho-GEF proteins. Among the 70 members of the Rho-GEF family, only Vav2 and XPLN have been shown to activate RhoB in vitro and in vivo (22Gampel A. Mellor H. Biochem. J. 2002; 366: 393-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 35Arthur W.T. Ellerbroek S.M. Der C.J. Burridge K. Wennerberg K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 42964-42972Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, little or nothing is known about the regulation of Vav2 or XPLN by DNA-damaging agents such as UVB. Experiments are under way to determine which of the GTP/GDP cycling regulators is involved in this process. In the second step of RhoB regulation, our results suggested that the long lasting maintenance of the RhoB-GTP abundance is allowed only by the increase in RhoB expression that is activated, most likely, by a basal cycling of GDP and GTP independently of EGFR. Indeed, we and others have previously reported that the sole constitutive expression of wild type RhoB is able to induce cellular responses such as tumor suppressive activity (9Chen Z. Sun J. Pradines A. Favre G. Adnane J. Sebti S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17974-17978Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar) or repression of NFκB signaling (32Fritz G. Kaina B. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 792-798Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Moreover, the expression of RhoB mRNA is rapidly elevated by UVB light in human HaCaT keratinocytes as a result of transcriptional upregulation and mRNA stabilization. Previously, transcriptional activation of RhoB by UVC light was shown to be regulated via a CCAAT element in murine NIH-3T3 cells. Recently we have cloned the human RhoB promoter (31Tovar D. Faye J.C. Favre G. Genomics. 2003; 81: 525-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) and found numerous consensus sites with notably a CCAAT sequence. Thus one can suppose that this site is involved in UVB-induced RhoB transcription in HaCaT cells. Besides its activity on rhoB promoter, UVB radiation also induced a significant stabilization of RhoB mRNA in HaCaT cells in a way comparable with the observed induction after UVC exposure of murine NIH-3T3 fibroblasts or normal human epidermal keratinocytes (25Westmark C.J. Bartleson V.B. Malter J.S. Oncogene. 2005; 24: 502-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). This stabilization could be processed by the rhoB 3′-untranslated region that displays AU-rich elements known to be stabilized in response to UV (36Blattner C. Kannouche P. Litfin M. Bender K. Rahmsdorf H.J. Angulo J.F. Herrlich P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 3616-3625Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Westmark et al. (25Westmark C.J. Bartleson V.B. Malter J.S. Oncogene. 2005; 24: 502-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) described that the mouse rhoB 3′-untranslated region is implicated in UVC-induced stabilization of mRNA, binding HuR, a shuttle protein that stabilizes RNA containing AU-rich elements. EGFR phosphorylation is a well established response to UV exposure as described for many cell types (for example, A431, Her14, or primary human keratinocytes). Although EGF led within a few minutes to a potent activation of EGFR, the EGFR phosphorylation in response to UVB was detected only after 1 h and was of lower intensity. Furthermore, we have shown that the induction of RhoB protein expression is fully dependent on UVB-induced EGFR activation since inhibition of EGFR activity by specific inhibitors (ZD1839 and AG1478) or by RNA interference impeded this process. Moreover, our data suggested that UVB-induced EGFR activation induces only RhoB expression but not its activation. Indeed, the demonstration that UVB-induced RhoB activation is independent of EGFR activation is supported by three lines of evidence. i) The early UVB-induced activation of RhoB occurred in the absence of EGFR phosphorylation; ii) ZD1839 did not prevent the early RhoB activation; and iii) AG1478 treatment 3 h after UVB exposure did not affect the RhoB-GTP level (supplemental Fig. 11). These results therefore demonstrated that EGFR activation by different stimuli, e.g. EGF or UVB, involves distinct aspects of RhoB regulation, either protein expression or GTP binding. In response to UV light, numerous signal transduction pathways are activated in keratinocytes, such as the MAPK pathways, including ERK, p38 (37Price M.A. Cruzalegui F.H. Treisman R. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6552-6563Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar), and PI3K/AKT (38He Z. Cho Y.Y. Ma W.Y. Choi H.S. Bode A.M. Dong Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 2446-2454Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Although ERK is mostly activated by mitogenic signals, p38 is activated by stress, provided by DNA-damaging agents such as UV radiation. We have shown here that RhoB is dispensable for the UVB-induced p38 activation since RhoB down-regulation did not impair p38 phosphorylation. Moreover, it has been reported that UVB-induced p38 activation is independent of EGFR phosphorylation (39Peus D. Vasa R.A. Meves A. Beyerle A. Pittelkow M.R. Photochem. Photobiol. 2000; 72: 135-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Overall these data suggested that p38 UVB activation should be independent of the EGFR/RhoB pathway. Concomitantly with these effects on p38, UVB exposure induced an early and strong activation of AKT, which persisted for at least 4 h. Surprisingly, we observed that the early UVB-induced AKT phosphorylation was independent of EGFR and RhoB activation. In contrast, the late AKT phosphorylation and the subsequent GSK-3β inactivation were fully dependent of EGFR activation and RhoB expression. AKT and GSK-3β are involved in the control of many signaling pathways in response to UV irradiation such as c-Fos, cAMP-response element-binding protein (CREB), and Cox2 (40Gonzales M. Bowden G.T. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 2721-2728Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). These results underlined the critical role of RhoB in the UVB-induced AKT/GSK-3β pathway. Interestingly, UVB-induced RhoB expression is needed to sustain EGFR expression and phosphorylation. These results are in concordance with previous reports that show that RhoB stabilizes EGFR in regulating its endosomal transport (41Fernandez-Borja M. Janssen L. Verwoerd D. Hordijk P. Neefjes J. J. Cell Sci. 2005; 118: 2661-2670Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). This suggested that, in response to UVB, RhoB controls AKT phosphorylation through the EGFR/PI3K pathway. We hypothesized that UVB-activated EGFR induces RhoB protein expression, which, subsequently, is necessary to maintain the high level of phosphorylated EGFR needed for AKT activation. These results were consistent with the role of RhoB in a positive feedback regulatory mechanism of the EGFR. By examining the down-regulation and overexpression of RhoB, we have clearly demonstrated that RhoB is necessary for human keratinocytes survival after UVB exposure. Likewise, it has been shown in other cellular settings that RhoB protects primary endothelial cells from cell death (42Adini I. Rabinovitz I. Sun J.F. Prendergast G.C. Benjamin L.E. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 2721-2732Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). A pro-survival role of RhoB have also been described in response to γ-radiation. Indeed, the constitutive expression of RhoB in NIH3T3 cells-induced resistance (43Milia J. Teyssier F. Dalenc F. Ader I. Delmas C. Pradines A. Lajoie-Mazenc I. Baron R. Bonnet J. Cohen-Jonathan E. Favre G. Toulas C. Cell Death Differ. 2005; 12: 492-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) and inhibition of RhoB by a dominant negative strategy induced a radiosensitization of glioma cells (44Ader I. Delmas C. Bonnet J. Rochaix P. Favre G. Toulas C. Cohen-Jonathan-Moyal E. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 8861-8869Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Moreover, overexpression of RhoB was shown to inhibit apoptosis in NIH3T3 cells after UVC irradiation (13Fritz G. Kaina B. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 268: 784-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). In this study, we have provided evidence that RhoB is required by EGFR to exert its survival function in cellular response to UV irradiation. Overall these data suggested that RhoB controls keratinocyte cell survival after UVB exposure through EGFR and AKT/GSK-3β pathway. UVB-induced activation of EGFR promotes skin tumorigenesis by suppressing cell death and promoting cell proliferation. By contrast inhibition of EGFR suppressed proliferation, increased apoptotic cell death, and limited the onset of epidermal hyperplasia (45El-Abaseri T.B. Fuhrman J. Trempus C. Shendrik I. Tennant R.W. Hansen L.A. Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 3958-3965Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Our work identifying RhoB as a critical regulator of EGFR in the UVB response suggested a definite involvement of RhoB in the promotion phase of carcinogenesis. However, in human keratinocytes, the pro-survival role of RhoB is a double-edged sword since in addition to preserving the pool of proliferative cells, it may foster survival of cells harboring oncogenic mutations and thereby promote skin carcinogenesis. Limiting RhoB expression could be a valuable target for preventing the deleterious effects of cell survival triggered by UVB exposure. Download .pdf (3.57 MB) Help with pdf files"

Escherichia coli DnaK is a member of the Hsp70 family of molecular chaperones, which facilitate folding of nascent protein chains, enhance recovery after cellular stresses such as heat shock, aid in protein translocation across membranes, and participate in protein disaggregation and degradation (1Mayer M.P. Bukau B. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2005; 62: 670-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (2091) Google Scholar). In addition to these very general functions, which rely on ATP-regulated binding to short hydrophobic stretches of substrate proteins, Hsp70s also play specific cellular roles in disrupting macromolecular complexes such as clathrin coats.

However, ATP binding converts the SBD to a low affinity conformation characterized by rapid substrate on/off rates and enhanced proteolytic susceptibility (2Pierpaoli E.V. Gisler S.M. Christen P.

Not only does nucleotide binding influence the peptide-binding pocket, but peptide binding also speeds the ATP hydrolysis rate, which is the rate-limiting step of the cycle for E. coli DnaK. The lack of a high resolution structure including both domains has hampered our understanding of the mechanism of allostery between these two binding sites. Nevertheless, increasing evidence of a role for dynamics suggests that even high resolution structures will be only the beginning of the story (6Mayer M.P. Schroder H. Rudiger S. Paal K. Laufen T.

Science. 1997; 276: 431-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar). A short well conserved linker connects the ATPase domain with the SBD, which itself consists of a β-subdomain capped by an α-helical lid subdomain, as observed in an x-ray crystal structure of DnaK-(389-607) bound to a peptide (Fig. 1A) (10Zhu X. Zhao X. Burkholder W.F. Gragerov A. Ogata C.M. Gottesman M.E. Hendrickson W.A. Science. 1996; 272: 1606-1614Crossref PubMed Scopus (1064) Google Scholar). The substrate peptide NR (sequence NRLLLTG) is nestled between loops of the distorted β-sandwich in an extended conformation (11Landry S.J. Jordan R. McMacken R. Gierasch L.M. Nature. 1992; 355: 455-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar) and is encapsulated by the α-helical lid subdomain, which extends over the top of the peptide-binding pocket, but does not directly contact the peptide. Based on observation of a kink in the α-helical lid in one crystalline form of the peptide-bound SBD, it was proposed that ATP binding could cause the α-helical lid to move away from the β-subdomain (10Zhu X. Zhao X. Burkholder W.F. Gragerov A. Ogata C.M. Gottesman M.E. Hendrickson W.A. Science. 1996; 272: 1606-1614Crossref PubMed Scopus (1064) Google Scholar). However, it is now clear that, although such a conformational change in the helix may indeed occur, the α-helical lid itself is dispensable for the ATP-induced switch of the β-subdomain to the low affinity conformation (3Buchberger A.

Insight into this change in conformation plus the role of peptide in allostery should be aided by structures of the SBD with and without bound substrate. However, structures of the empty conformation of the SBD have been difficult to obtain because of the strong tendency of the domain to bind any available hydrophobic sequence. In NMR structures of truncated SBDs of DnaK and Hsc70, in which three C-terminal helices were removed (corresponding to DnaK residues 386-561 and Hsc70-(383-540)) (15Morshauser R.C. Hu W. Wang H.

Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 7929-7940Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar), leucine residues near the new C terminus bound intramolecularly into the peptide-binding pocket. A subsequent structure of the isolated β-subdomain (DnaK residues 393-507) in the empty conformation revealed a highly flexible structure with a major conformational change in strand β3 at the edge of one sheet (14Pellecchia M. Montgomery D.L. Stevens S.Y. Vander Kooi C.W. Feng H.P. Gierasch L.M. Zuiderweg E.R.P. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 298-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). The dynamic nature of the empty β-subdomain and its low affinity for NR peptide (Kd value of 0.6 mm) indicated that the isolated subdomain might favor the low affinity conformation. However, this fragment was later reported to exist as a dimer in the empty conformation, and thus it is not clear at this time which conformational changes might be due to dimer formation and which due to loss of peptide (17Stevens S.Y. Cai S. Pellecchia M. Zuiderweg E.R.P. Protein Sci. 2003; 12: 2588-2596Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Here we demonstrate that, contrary to the reported behavior of the isolated β-subdomain, a DnaK SBD fragment retaining a portion of the α-helical subdomain but harboring mutations that abrogate self-binding was well folded and stable in the empty state and bound peptides with high affinity. The structural and dynamic changes in the empty state relative to the peptide-bound form were small and local and reported on conformational rearrangement of the peptide-binding pocket and repacking of the helix against the β-subdomain. When this stable SBD and the native ATPase domain were linked in a two-domain construct, the protein was allosterically functional. Strikingly, however, NMR spectra of the two-domain construct without nucleotide present indicated that the two domains do not interact, even in the presence of peptide. These results have demonstrated that nucleotide is necessary to establish allosteric signaling between the domains. Cloning Strategies—Plasmid pRLM212 was a kind gift from R. McMacken (Johns Hopkins University), and codes for H6DnaK-(387-552), under control of a heat shock promoter. The L542Y/L543E mutant, H6DnaK-(387-552)-ye, was created by QuikChange PCR on pRLM212. Plasmid pMS-DnaK-(1-552) was created from the wild-type DnaK expression vector pMS-DnaK (18Montgomery D.L. Morimoto R.I. Gierasch L.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 286: 915-932Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar) by QuikChange PCR mutagenesis of codons 553 and 554 to stop codons. This plasmid was then further mutagenized to create the L542Y/L543E version by QuikChange PCR as above for pRLM212. All coding sequences were verified by full DNA sequencing (Davis Sequencing, Davis, CA). pRLM157, which encodes DnaK-(1-388) under a heat-inducible promoter, was also provided by Dr. Roger McMacken. Protein Purification—Constructs containing the ATPase domain were transformed into the DnaK-deficient BB1553 strain of E. coli, grown at 30 °C, and induced either by the addition of 0.4 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside or heat shock at 42 °C, depending on the promoter, and purified as described previously (18Montgomery D.L. Morimoto R.I. Gierasch L.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 286: 915-932Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar) with a minor modification. In the ATP-agarose used in this study, the N6 atom of ATP was linked to agarose instead of the C8 atom (Sigma catalog number A9264). DnaK can be eluted from this column using EDTA instead of excess ATP, resulting in completely nucleotide-free protein. Briefly, soluble protein extracts were loaded on DEAE-Sepharose equilibrated in 20 mm HEPES, 0.1 mm EDTA, pH 7.4, and eluted using a continuous gradient to 500 mm KCl. Peak fractions were pooled, brought to 10 mm MgCl2, and then loaded on the ATP-agarose column pre-equilibrated in 20 mm HEPES, 5 mm MgCl2, and 100 mm KCl, pH 7.6 (HMK buffer). The column was washed with HMK plus 2 m KCl and the protein was eluted in 20 mm HEPES, 10 mm EDTA, 100 mm KCl, pH 7.6. Pooled peak fractions were concentrated in an Amicon ultrafiltration cell (Millipore, Billerica, MA), dialyzed against HMK buffer, and stored at -80 °C. The 260/280 nm absorption ratio of protein prepared in this way was always <0.6, indicating that the protein is nucleotide-free (19Slepenkov S.V. Witt S.N. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 1015-1024Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). His-tagged SBD constructs were expressed in the BL21(DE3) strain of E. coli grown at 30 °C to an A600 of 1 and then induced at 42 °C for 5 h. Soluble extracts prepared by lysozyme treatment, sonication, and removal of cell debris by centrifugation were applied to a Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid resin (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) pre-equilibrated in 50 mm sodium phosphate, 0.5 m NaCl, pH 8 (buffer A), and eluted using a gradient to 200 mm imidazole in buffer A. Peak fractions were pooled, concentrated in an Amicon ultrafiltration cell, and dialyzed against 20 mm sodium phosphate, 25 mm NaCl, pH 7 (buffer B). For H6DnaK-(387-552)-ye, roughly half of the protein is expressed in inclusion bodies; therefore in this case, protein was also purified from the pellet by solubilizing in 8 m urea in buffer A, after which it was sonicated, centrifuged, and chromatographed on Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid resin as above but with 8 m urea incorporated in all buffers. Peak fractions were concentrated by ultrafiltration, refolded by dropwise dilution into a 20-fold excess of buffer B with rapid stirring, concentrated again, and dialyzed against buffer B before storage at -80 °C. Protein purified from the soluble fraction and the refolded protein gave identical TROSY NMR spectra. Preparation of NMR Samples—Proteins were labeled with 15N or 15N/13C by growth in M9 minimal medium supplemented with [15N]ammonium chloride and [13C]glucose. Purified and concentrated protein was buffer-exchanged in a Centricon-10 concentrator (Millipore, Billerica, MA) into NMR buffers as follows: for SBD-only constructs, 10 mm sodium phosphate, 10 mm sodium acetate, 10% D2O and 0.02% sodium azide; for ATPase-domain-containing constructs, 10 mm potassium phosphate, 10 mm potassium chloride, 5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm (d6)β-mercaptoethanol, 10% D2O and 0.02% sodium azide. All NMR buffers were pH 7 and contained 0.5 mm 3-(trimethylsilyl) propane sulfonic acid as an internal standard. NMR Sequential Assignments—The backbone NMR resonance assignments of H6DnaK-(387-552)-ye in the empty and NR-bound states were obtained using 0.7 mm labeled protein samples with and without 0.8 mm NR peptide on a Bruker Avance 600 spectrometer. A combination of HNCA, HN(CO)CA, CBCA(CO)NH, HNCACB, HNCO, and HN(CA)CO experiments using 13C/15N-labeled protein and 1H,15N-NOESY/TROSY and 1H,15N-TOCSY/TROSY experiments collected on 15N-only samples (80- and 50-ms mixing times, respectively) was used to complete the assignments (20Cavanagh J.

Güntert P. Wüthrich K. J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 5: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (1607) Google Scholar) were used for spectral processing and data analysis, respectively. 98% of non-proline backbone resonances were assigned in this manner. Weighted average chemical shift changes (Δδavg) were calculated as described in Ref. 14Pellecchia M. Montgomery D.L. Stevens S.Y. Vander Kooi C.W. Feng H.P. Gierasch L.M. Zuiderweg E.R.P. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 298-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar. NMR Hydrogen Exchange—Hydrogen-deuterium exchange was initiated by resuspending samples of 0.3 mm [15N]H6DnaK-(387-552)-ye that had been lyophilized with and without 0.7 mm NR peptide into 100% D2O NMR buffer. Peak volumes were plotted versus time and fit to a single exponential decay. Protection factors were calculated relative to the sequence-specific intrinsic exchange rates of Bai et al. (23Bai Y. Milne J.S. Mayne L. Englander S.W. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 1993; 17: 75-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (1770) Google Scholar). Peptide Synthesis and Purification—Peptides p5 (CLLLSAPRR) and NR (NRLLLTG) were synthesized on a Pioneer automated peptide synthesizer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA), purified to homogeneity by high pressure liquid chromatography, and verified by mass spectrometry. ATPase Assays—Single turnover ATPase rates were measured by following the recovery of the fluorescence intensity of Trp-102 after the addition of substoichiometric amounts of ATP (19Slepenkov S.V. Witt S.N. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 1015-1024Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 24Slepenkov S.V. Patchen B. Peterson K.M. Witt S.N. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 5867-5876Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), using 1 μm protein and 0.5 μm ATP at 25 °C in HMK buffer. Fluorescence measurements were made on an Alpha Scan Fluorometer (Photon Technology International, Birmingham, NJ) with excitation at 295 nm, emission at 340 nm, and excitation and emission slits set at 2 and 5 nm, respectively. Shutters were gated closed between data points to avoid photobleaching over the course of the experiment. Recovery curves were fit to a single exponential. Peptide-stimulated rates were measured by adding ATP after a 15′ preincubation of protein with 30 μm p5 peptide. Fluorescence Measurements—The ATP-induced blue shift of Trp-102 was monitored with emission wavelength scans from 305-405 nm upon excitation at 295 nm (25 °C). Excitation slits were 2 nm and emission slits were 5 nm. Protein concentration was 1 μm in HMK buffer, ±0.5 mm ATP. λ Phage Replication Assays—These assays followed established protocols (18Montgomery D.L. Morimoto R.I. Gierasch L.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 286: 915-932Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Design of a Truncated SBD Construct That Retained Full Substrate Binding—We set out to determine the conformational differences between the empty and the peptide-bound states of the DnaK SBD using NMR. Because the full-length SBD is aggregation-prone, we began with a truncated domain in which the last three helices of the α-helical lid were deleted, corresponding to H6DnaK-(387-552), which was generously provided by Dr. Roger McMacken (Johns Hopkins University) (Fig. 1B). However, peptide titration monitored by NMR demonstrated that this fragment had extremely low affinity for substrates (data not shown) and had nearly identical chemical shifts to a slightly less truncated version of the DnaK SBD, where C-terminal tail residues occupied the substrate-binding pocket intramolecularly (16Wang H. Kurochkin A.V. Pang Y. Hu W. Flynn G.C. Zuiderweg E.R.P. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 7929-7940Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 25Swain J.F. Sivendran R. Gierasch L.M. Biochem. Soc. Symp. 2001; 68: 69-82Crossref Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Interestingly, when this truncated domain was connected to the ATPase domain in cis (corresponding to DnaK-(1-552), Fig. 1B), the single turnover ATPase rate was 10-fold higher than that of full-length DnaK, and it was not stimulated in the presence of 30 μm p5 peptide (Fig. 2), consistent with the interpretation that the C terminus of the SBD fragment was occupying the binding pocket in an entropically favored interaction. In the NMR structure of DnaK-(386-561) by Wang et al. (16Wang H. Kurochkin A.V. Pang Y. Hu W. Flynn G.C. Zuiderweg E.R.P. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 7929-7940Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar), two adjacent leucine residues at positions 542 and 543 were bound intramolecularly by the substrate-binding pocket, presumably due to deletion of the α-helical bundle into which these leucines normally pack (Fig. 1A) (10Zhu X. Zhao X. Burkholder W.F. Gragerov A. Ogata C.M. Gottesman M.E. Hendrickson W.A. Science. 1996; 272: 1606-1614Crossref PubMed Scopus (1064) Google Scholar). In previous work, we destabilized the binding of the C-terminal tail by shifting to lower pH, presumably causing protonation of the histidines that flank these two leucine residues, but we were only able to populate the unbound conformation to a small degree (10-20%) (25Swain J.F. Sivendran R. Gierasch L.M. Biochem. Soc. Symp. 2001; 68: 69-82Crossref Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Therefore, in the present work, we mutated these residues to tyrosine and glutamate (L542Y/L543E) to fully destabilize this apparently non-physiological interaction with the binding site and to observe the empty conformation of the SBD. The resulting SBD fragment, H6DnaK-(387-552)-ye, had restored high affinity peptide binding when monitored using either NMR (Fig. 3A) or a reduced carboxymethylated lactalbumin competition binding assay (26Ng, V. (2004) Investigation of the Substrate Specificity and Function of the HSP70 Chaperone, BiP. Ph.D. thesis, University of Melbourne, Melbourne, AustraliaGoogle Scholar), suggesting that the mutations abrogated intramolecular interaction of the C terminus with the binding pocket. In fact, the apparent affinity of H6DnaK-(387-552)-ye for peptides in the reduced carboxymethylated lactalbumin competition binding assay was similar to that of full-length wild-type DnaK in the high affinity state; peptides V7 (FYQLAKT) and S7K2Y (KYLMFKT) had apparent affinities of 25 and 50 μm, respectively, for both full-length DnaK and H6DnaK-(387-552)-ye (26Ng, V. (2004) Investigation of the Substrate Specificity and Function of the HSP70 Chaperone, BiP. Ph.D. thesis, University of Melbourne, Melbourne, AustraliaGoogle Scholar, 27Fourie A.M. Sambrook J.F. Gething M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30470-30478Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, unlike H6DnaK-(387-552), in which NR titration at low pH shifted a pre-existing equilibrium between tail-bound and tail-free conformations and resulted in large chemical shift changes for 542 and 543 (25Swain J.F. Sivendran R. Gierasch L.M. Biochem. Soc. Symp. 2001; 68: 69-82Crossref Scopus (6) Google Scholar), titration of NR into H6DnaK-(387-552)-ye had no effect on these resonances, indicating that the mutation blocks binding of the C-terminal tail completely (see supplemental data). Importantly, in the context of the two-domain protein DnaK-(1-552)-ye, the same mutations restored a wild-type level of basal ATP hydrolysis, which was stimulated 7-fold by 30 μm p5 (Fig. 2), further supporting the interpretation that the binding pocket was empty. DnaK-(1-552)-ye Was Allosterically Functional in Vitro and in Vivo—Encouraged by the fact that the ATPase rate of DnaK-(1-552)-ye was stimulated by peptide nearly as much as full-length DnaK, we next questioned whether other allosteric properties were preserved. In full-length DnaK, the ATP-induced conformational change to the low affinity state can be monitored via the fluorescence of the single tryptophan (Trp-102) in the ATPase domain. In the presence of ATP, Trp-102 is quenched, blue-shifted, and protected from solvent by a mechanism that relies on the presence of a portion of the helical lid subdomain of the SBD (3Buchberger A. Theyssen H. Schroder H. McCarty J.S. Virgallita G. Milkereit P. Reinstein J. Bukau B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16903-16910Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar, 5Moro F. Fernández V. Muga A. FEBS Lett. 2003; 533: 119-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Thus, the changes in Trp-102 fluorescence report on ATP-dependent allosteric communication with the SBD. As seen in Fig. 4, the tryptophan fluorescence in DnaK-(1-552)-ye exhibited the same ∼25% quench and 4-nm blue-shift with ATP binding as in wild-type DnaK. Thus the mutant domain retained all the hallmarks of allostery in DnaK, ATP-induced conformational change to the low affinity state and substrate-induced activation of ATP catalysis. Because these in vitro tests showed DnaK-(1-552)-ye to behave similar to the wild-type protein, we also tested its ability to support replication of bacteriophage λ in vivo. DnaK-(1-552)-ye consistently gave about two-thirds the number of plaques as the wild-type protein, showing that it could substitute for wild-type DnaK in vivo (see supplemental data). Based on these data, which showed the truncated modified SBD to be functional in the context of a two-domain construct, we proceeded to characterize the impact of substrate binding to the isolated SBD using NMR. NMR Chemical Shift Changes between the Empty and Peptide-bound Forms of H6DnaK-(387-552)-ye Were Primarily Local—TROSY NMR spectra of the empty and NR-bound states of H6DnaK-(387-552)-ye showed similar dispersion and line widths, suggesting that the domain was well folded in both states (Fig. 3A). NR peptide bound stoichiometrically at these concentrations, consistent with the high affinity measured by the reduced carboxymethylated lactalbumin competition binding assay, and it bound in the slow exchange regime, as observed in an earlier NMR study of the isolated β-subdomain (14Pellecchia M. Montgomery D.L. Stevens S.Y. Vander Kooi C.W. Feng H.P. Gierasch L.M. Zuiderweg E.R.P. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 298-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). However, contrary to that study, in which substantial regions of the empty SBD were broadened beyond detection by conformational exchange, we were able to observe and assign all but three non-proline residues in both states of H6DnaK-(387-552)-ye using 13C/15N-labeled protein and standard methods (see supplemental data). Based on sequential nuclear Overhauser effects (data not shown), chemical shift indices (see supplemental data), and patterns of hydrogen bonding (Fig. 5), we determined that H6DnaK-(387-552)-ye had the same overall structure as the crystal structure of NR-bound DnaK-(389-607), at least up to residue 537 (10Zhu X. Zhao X. Burkholder W.F. Gragerov A. Ogata C.M. Gottesman M.E. Hendrickson W.A. Science. 1996; 272: 1606-1614Crossref PubMed Scopus (1064) Google Scholar). Therefore, we can discuss chemical shift differences between the NR-bound and empty states in terms of this crystal structure. The chemical shift changes between the NR-bound and empty states were largely local to the crystallographically defined binding pocket (10Zhu X. Zhao X. Burkholder W.F. Gragerov A. Ogata C.M. Gottesman M.E. Hendrickson W.A. Science. 1996; 272: 1606-1614Crossref PubMed Scopus (1064) Google Scholar) and indicated modest remodeling of the hydrophobic binding pocket in the empty state (Fig. 3B). Specifically, most of the large to moderate chemical shift changes were contained within loops L1,2 and L3,4 and the ensuing strand β4, all of which flank the peptide-binding pocket. Intriguingly, however, there was also evidence of a change in the way the helix packed against the β-subdomain in the empty state, as the helix residues that face the β-subdomain in the NR-bound crystal structure (10Zhu X. Zhao X. Burkholder W.F. Gragerov A. Ogata C.M. Gottesman M.E. Hendrickson W.A. Science. 1996; 272: 1606-1614Crossref PubMed Scopus (1064) Google Scholar) exhibited small to moderate weighted average chemical shift changes relative to the NR-bound state (Δδavg 0.01-0.025 ppm, calculated as in (14Pellecchia M.

Importantly, these data are not consistent with a conformational change in edge strand β3 between the empty and peptide-bound states, such as that observed in the previously reported isolated β-subdomain (14Pellecchia M. Montgomery D.L. Stevens S.Y. Vander Kooi C.W. Feng H.P. Gierasch L.M. Zuiderweg E.R.P. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 298-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar).

https://openalex.org/W2068649233,"The consequences of human RNA polymerase II (pol II) arrest at the site of DNA damaged by cisplatin were studied in whole cells and cell extracts, with a particular focus on the stability of stalled pol II and its subsequent ubiquitylation. Site-specifically platinated DNA templates immobilized on a solid support were used to perform in vitro transcription in HeLa nuclear extracts. RNA elongation was completely blocked by a cisplatin intrastrand cross-link. The stalled polymerase was quite stable, remaining on the DNA template in nuclear extracts. The stability of pol II stalled at the site of cisplatin damage was also observed in live cells. A cell fractionation experiment using cisplatin-treated HeLa cells revealed an increased level of chromatin-associated pol II proteins following DNA damage. The stalled polymerase was transcriptionally active and capable of elongating the transcript following chemical removal of platinum from the template. Transcription inhibition by α-amanitin in vitro enhanced pol II ubiquitylation at ubiquitin residues Lys-6, Lys-48, and Lys-63. In live cells expressing epitope-tagged ubiquitin mutants, several ubiquitin lysines also participated in pol II ubiquitylation following DNA damage. Cisplatin treatment triggered ubiquitylation-mediated pol II degradation in HeLa cells, which could be prevented by the proteasomal inhibitor MG132. Fractionation of pol II from cells co-treated with MG132 and cisplatin indicated that the undegraded ubiquitylated polymerase was mostly unbound or only loosely associated with chromatin. These data are consistent with a model in which only a fraction of pol II, ubiquitylated in response to cisplatin damage of DNA, dissociates from the sites of platination.

This altered polymerase is rapidly destroyed by proteasomes. The anti-tumor activity of platinum-based drugs is mediated by their ability to attack DNA. The resulting DNA lesions generate numerous cellular signals, which eventually decide the fate of cells treated by platinum agents (1Jamieson E.R. Lippard S.J. Chem. Rev. 1999; 99: 2467-2498Crossref PubMed Scopus (2639) Google Scholar, 2Wang D. Lippard S.J. Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2005; 4: 307-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (3056) Google Scholar). Our understanding of this complicated process requires knowledge of the proteins that interact at the site of platinum damage on DNA and how they alter cell biology. Among such proteins, those that arrive first at a platinum-DNA lesion are likely to have the greatest influence (3Cline S.D. Hanawalt P.C. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 4: 361-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). The identification of these proteins and comprehension of their functions are therefore important for elucidating the cellular responses to platinum-DNA damage. Such knowledge can help frame new therapeutic strategies.

With ∼300,000 copies in a single cell (4Kimura H. Tao Y. Roeder R.G. Cook P.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 5383-5392Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar), pol II is one of the proteins that encounter platinum lesions at a relatively early stage in the DNA damage-response process. Nearly 25% of this enzyme is constantly transcribing cellular DNA (5Kimura H. Sugaya K. Cook P.R. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 159: 777-782Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Platinum-DNA adducts inhibit transcription by blocking RNA polymerases, as demonstrated in many laboratories, including our own (6Tornaletti S. Patrick S.M. Turchi J.J. Hanawalt P.C. J. Biol.

The arrest of pol II initiates transcription-coupled repair (9Svejstrup J.Q. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 3: 21-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). Although the exact mechanism is unknown, it is generally accepted that stalled pol II must be removed or translocated from the site of damage in order for the repair machinery to assemble (10Svejstrup J.Q. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 447-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). In vitro transcription experiments have demonstrated that pol II arrested at cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (CPDs) on the template strand is fairly stable but dissociates from the damage sites in whole cell extracts, possibly with assistance from human transcription release factor-2 (11Selby C.P. Drapkin R. Reinberg D. Sancar A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 787-793Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 12Hara R. Selby C.P. Liu M. Price D.H. Sancar A. J. Biol.

ATP-dependent release from the template strand of pol II stalled at a cisplatin lesion in whole cell extracts has also been observed (8Tremeau-Bravard A. Riedl T. Egly J.M. Dahmus M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 7751-7759Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Despite numerous such in vitro studies, the outcome of pol II blockage and the mechanism of subsequent transcription-coupled repair initiation are not fully understood. Polyubiquitylation of pol II following DNA damage by UV radiation and cisplatin treatment has been reported (13Bregman D.B. Halaban R. van Gool A.J. Henning K.A. Friedberg E.C. Warren S.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 11586-11590Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar, 14Ratner J.N. Balasubramanian B. Corden J. Warren S.L. Bregman D.B. J. Biol.

This modification does not occur in cells lacking Cockayne syndrome proteins A and B, however, which are essential for transcription-coupled repair. In vitro transcription experiments with damaged DNA have also demonstrated that pol II ubiquitylation is transcription-dependent, further suggesting a possible link between ubiquitylation of the polymerase and DNA repair (15Lee K.B. Wang D. Lippard S.J. Sharp P.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 4239-4244Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Polyubiquitin chains linked at their C termini and Lys-48 residues signal proteasomal degradation of a lysine-modified target and are a major form of protein modification. Proteins are less frequently ubiquitylated by chains involving Lys-63 of ubiquitin, an event that triggers pathways distinct from protein degradation (16Pickart C.M. Fushman D. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 2004; 8: 610-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (840) Google Scholar). Beside Lys-48 and Lys-63, five other lysines are available to form polyubiquitin chains, with many of their roles yet to be determined. Recently, Lys-63-linked ubiquitylation of pol II was reported when the enzyme was inhibited by α-amanitin in nuclear extracts obtained from cells synchronized in S phase (17Lee K.B. Sharp P.A. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 15223-15229Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). To explore the effects of cisplatin-DNA damage on pol II, site-specifically platinated DNA templates immobilized on a solid support were employed. The properties of stalled pol II and its RNA transcripts in the resulting ternary complexes were analyzed. Changes in the cellular pol II distribution following DNA platination were investigated. pol II ubiquitylation sites were mapped with the aid of ubiquitin mutants both in vitro and in live cells. The latter experiments were facilitated in HeLa cells by expressing hemagglutinin (HA)-tagged ubiquitin. We also investigated the stability of ubiquitylated pol II in cisplatin-treated cells. Materials—Cisplatin (cis-diamminedichloroplatinum(II)) was obtained from Johnson Matthey. The proteasomal inhibitor MG132 was purchased from Calbiochem. T4 polynucleotide kinase, T4 DNA ligase, and all restriction enzymes were procured from New England Biolabs Inc. Streptavidin-coupled Dynabeads M-280 were obtained from Dynal Biotech. RNasin (RNase inhibitor) was purchased from Promega Corp. His-tagged ubiquitin expression vectors (pQE30-HisUb, pQE30-HisK48RUb, and pQE30-HisK63RUb) were kindly provided by Dr. K. B. Lee, and the proteins were prepared as described previously (17Lee K.B. Sharp P.A. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 15223-15229Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). His-tagged ubiquitin proteins containing only one lysine residue, with the other six lysines mutated to arginines (His-K6onlyUb, His-K48onlyUb, and His-K63onlyUb), were purchased from Boston Biochem. HeLa cells were grown at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Construction of DNA Templates—Plasmid pG5MLPG380 (a gift from Dr. K. B. Lee) containing an adenovirus major late (AdML) promoter was prepared from a 10-ml LB culture of Escherichia coli XL1-Blue cells harboring the plasmid using a Promega midi-prep kit. The plasmid was further purified by 1% agarose gel electrophoresis to remove the nicked form of DNA and subsequently used for in vitro ubiquitylation assays. A linear DNA template consisting of an AdML promoter, 380 bp of an upstream fragment before the transcription start site, a site-specific platinum lesion on the template strand, and a biotin moiety at the 5′-end of the template was constructed. A DNA fragment containing an AdML promoter was prepared by PCR amplification from plasmid pG5MLPG380 (see Fig. 1). A biotin moiety was placed at the 5′-end of the coding strand by performing PCR with a 5′-biotinylated primer. The recognition site (GGTCTC) of restriction enzyme Eco31I, which produces a non-palindromic 4-nucleotide (nt) 5′-overhang, is located near the downstream end of the PCR product. The excess primers, NTPs, and DNA polymerases were removed from the PCR product by passage through Sephadex G-50 spin columns, followed by phenol extraction. The resulting DNA was treated with Eco31I and purified on a 4% native polyacrylamide gel, producing the DNA fragment with a 4-nt 5′-overhang (see Fig. 1, PCR_promoter). Single-stranded DNA containing a cisplatin 1,2- or 1,3-intrastrand cross-link was synthesized as reported previously (18Wei M. Cohen S.M. Silverman A.P. Lippard S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38774-38780Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). A 95-bp DNA fragment with a site-specific cisplatin lesion and a 4-nt 5′-overhang was prepared by enzymatic ligation of five pieces of synthetic oligonucleotides (see Fig. 1, 99–95 DNA) following a previously described method (7Jung Y. Lippard S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 52084-52092Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The complete sequence of each oligonucleotide piece is given in supplemental Fig. S1. Phosphorylated oligonucleotides were annealed, ligated by T4 DNA ligase, and purified by denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Extracted 95- and 99-nt single-stranded DNAs were reannealed by heating to 90 °C and slowly cooling to room temperature. The resulting 95-bp DNA fragment with a 4-nt 5′-overhang was ligated with the Eco31I-treated PCR product containing an AdML promoter (see Fig. 1). The final DNA templates were purified on a 3.5% native polyacrylamide gel. Preparation of HeLa Nuclear Extracts—HeLa nuclear extracts were obtained from Promega Corp. or prepared from HeLa suspension cells (obtained from American Type Culture Collection) following a previously reported method (19Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9164) Google Scholar). Hydroxyurea (750 μm)-treated HeLa cells were obtained as described previously (15Lee K.B. Wang D. Lippard S.J. Sharp P.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 4239-4244Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Cells were suspended in five times the packed cell volume of low salt buffer (10 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm KCl, and 0.5 mm dithiothreitol (DTT)) and incubated for 15 min on ice. The cell suspension was centrifuged at 420 × g for 5 min, and the swollen cell pellet was resuspended again in twice the packed cell volume of low salt buffer. Cells were disrupted using a Dounce homogenizer with a type B pestle for 10 strokes. The crude nuclear pellet was obtained by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 10 min. Two-thirds of the packed cell volume of high salt buffer (20 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 1.5 mm MgCl2, 25% glycerol, 420 mm NaCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.5 mm DTT) was added to resuspend the pellet, and the nuclei were homogenized again with the Dounce homogenizer. After incubation with rotation at 4 °C for 30 min, the nuclear extract was obtained by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 5 min. The resulting nuclear extract was dialyzed against storage buffer (20 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 20% glycerol, 100 mm KCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.5 mm DTT) and stored at –80 °C. In Vitro Transcription Assays in HeLa Nuclear Extract—Transcription by human pol II was carried out by incubating 300–500 ng of DNA template with ∼50 μg of HeLa nuclear extract, 1 unit/μl of RNasin, 10 mm DTT, 1 mm ATP, 0.1 mm GTP, 0.1 mm CTP, and 10 μm [α-32P]UTP in transcription buffer (12 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 12% glycerol, 60 mm KCl, 8 mm MgCl2, 0.12 mm EDTA, 0.3 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.3 mm DTT) in a total volume of 25 μl. The standard incubation was for 60 min at 30 °C. The reaction was stopped by addition of 180 μl of buffer containing 0.3 m Tris (pH 7.4), 0.3 m sodium acetate, 0.5% SDS, 2 mm EDTA, and 3 μg/ml tRNA. For solid-phase transcription, the DNA templates were immobilized on magnetic beads coated with streptavidin (Dynal Biotech) following the manufacturer's instructions and incubated with HeLa extract in transcription buffer for 30 min at 30 °C before adding NTPs. Transcription elongation was initiated with NTPs containing 10 μm [α-32P]UTP and continued for 25 min. Nonradioactive UTP was added to a final concentration of 0.1 mm, and the reaction mixture was incubated for an additional 5 min. Stalled elongation complexes on immobilized templates were isolated with a magnetic separator. Ternary complexes were washed with transcription buffer containing the indicated detergents and further incubated under various conditions. Cyanide ion treatment to remove platinum from stalled elongation complexes was performed as described previously (7Jung Y. Lippard S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 52084-52092Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). A1 m sodium cyanide stock solution was prepared in 10 mm Tris (pH 8.2) and stored at –80 °C until used. RNA transcripts were isolated by phenol extraction and ethanol precipitation and analyzed on urea-polyacrylamide gels. To follow pol II proteins in stalled ternary complexes, solid-phase transcription was performed as described above, except that 0.1 mm UTP (total concentration) was used instead of 10 μm [α-32P]UTP. Polymerases in the reaction supernatant and wash solutions from templates immobilized on beads were applied to a 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel; blotted onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane; and probed with mouse anti-pol II IgM (antibody H14, Covance), which probes the phospho-Ser-5 version of pol II. In Vitro Ubiquitylation Assays in HeLa Nuclear Extract—Ubiquitylation assays with plasmid DNA were performed following a previously reported method (15Lee K.B. Wang D. Lippard S.J. Sharp P.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 4239-4244Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). A 50-μg portion of HeLa nuclear extract was incubated with ∼1 μg of DNA template in transcription buffer with and without 5 μm α-amanitin for 15 min at 30 °C. To initiate transcription elongation and subsequent ubiquitylation, NTPs (1 mm ATP and 0.2 mm each CTP, GTP, and UTP) and various His-tagged ubiquitin proteins (1 μg) were added to the reaction solution. Following 40 min of additional incubation, ubiquitylated proteins including pol II were separated from the nuclear extract by incubation with 20 μl of nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid (Ni-NTA)-agarose resin (Novagen) in His-NTA binding buffer (50 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.9), 0.3 m NaCl, 10 mm imidazole, and 0.05% Tween 20) at 4 °C for 1 h. The resin was washed twice with His-NTA binding buffer containing 30 mm imidazole before eluting ubiquitylated proteins by adding SDS loading buffer (20 mm Tris (pH 6.8), 10% glycerol, 100 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 1% SDS, and 0.02% bromphenol blue) supplemented with 0.1 m EDTA. The eluted proteins were separated on a 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and analyzed as described above with mouse anti-pol II antibody H14. The assay was also carried out with bead-immobilized linear DNA templates. The immobilized template (1 μg) was incubated with HeLa nuclear extract (50 μg) as described above for 30 min at 30 °C before adding NTPs (1 mm ATP and 0.2 mm each CTP, GTP, and UTP). Transcription was inhibited either by adding 5 μm α-amanitin or by using a site-specifically platinated DNA template. Following a 10-min transcription elongation reaction, ubiquitylation was initiated by addition of 1 μg of ubiquitin and continued for 40 min. The beads were separated and washed with detergents as described above. pol II proteins in each sample were examined by Western blot analysis with mouse anti-pol II antibody H14. Cellular Protein Fractionation—HeLa cells were collected with a cell scraper or by trypsinization with or without cisplatin treatment. The cells obtained were sequentially extracted with various detergents and salts according to a previously reported method (20Wang Q.E. Zhu Q. Wani G. Chen J. Wani A.A. Carcinogenesis. 2004; 25: 1033-1043Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). All solutions contained a protease inhibitor mixture (Calbiochem). Cells harvested from a 100-mm dish (∼5 × 106 cells) were lysed with 500 μl of hypotonic buffer (10 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 10 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, and 0.1% Triton X-100) for 10 min on ice. The nuclear pellets were separated from the supernatant (designated as the S2 fraction containing cytoplasmic proteins) and washed with isotonic sucrose buffer (50 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 0.25 m sucrose, and 5 mm MgCl2), producing the STM fraction. The washed nuclear pellets were extracted with a series of low salt buffers (10 mm Tris (pH 7.4) and 0.2 mm MgCl2) supplemented with 1% Triton X-100, 0 m NaCl, 0.3 m NaCl, 0.5 m NaCl, or 2.0 m NaCl, yielding the TW, LS, 0.3, 0.5, and 2.0 fractions, respectively. Finally, the remaining nuclear residue was solubilized in low salt buffer by sonication (NR fraction). A 10–20-μl portion of each cell fraction was subjected to SDS-PAGE and analyzed by immunoblotting with the following antibodies: mouse anti-pol II antibody H14, mouse anti-actin IgG (Upstate), rabbit anti-HMGB1 IgG (Upstate), mouse anti-histone H3 IgG (Upstate), and rabbit anti-transcription factor (TF) IIH p89 IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.). To examine the portion of transcriptionally engaged pol II, cellular proteins were fractionated as described (21Inukai N. Yamaguchi Y. Kuraoka I. Yamada T. Kamijo S. Kato J. Tanaka K. Handa H. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 8190-8195Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) with a minor modification. HeLa cells obtained from a 25-cm2 culture flask (∼2 × 106 cells) were suspended in 400 μl of cytoskeleton buffer (10 mm PIPES (pH 6.8), 100 mm NaCl, 300 mm sucrose, 3 mm MgCl2, 0.5% Triton X-100, 1 mm DTT, and 1 mm EGTA) and incubated for 10 min on ice. The supernatant (S fraction) was separated from the nuclei, which were subsequently extracted with 400 μl of TD buffer (10 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.2), 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% Triton X-100, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 5 mm EDTA, and 2 mm EGTA) to yield the NE fraction. The remaining nuclear residue was boiled in 100 μl of hot SDS buffer (10 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.2), 150 mm NaCl, 1% SDS, 5 mm EDTA, and 2 mm EGTA) and diluted with 300 μl of cold TD buffer. The solution was sonicated to disrupt chromatin further and centrifuged to produce the NR fraction. HA-tagged Ubiquitin Expression in HeLa Cells—Plasmid pMT127 (named MTHA_Ub×1 in this study; shown in supplemental Fig. S2), comprising a cytomegalovirus promoter and a HA-tagged ubiquitin gene, was obtained from Dr. D. Bohmann (22Treier M. Staszewski L.M. Bohmann D. Cell. 1994; 78: 787-798Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (847) Google Scholar). Site-directed mutagenesis was performed to mutate the indicated lysine residues of ubiquitin to arginines. The expression vectors (MTHA_Ub×n) (supplemental Fig. S2), which produce mRNAs encoding precursor proteins consisting of multimeric ubiquitins and ubiquitin mutants (n = number of ubiquitins in a multimer), were constructed as shown in supplemental Fig. S2. MTHA_Ub×7 (containing a heptameric ubiquitin gene) was used in this study. HeLa cells were grown to 90% confluence on a 6-well plate. Approximately 2 μg of plasmid DNA was transfected with 10 μl of Lipofectamine 2000 reagent (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's protocol. After a 24-h incubation with transfection complexes, the medium was replaced with standard Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. Cells were washed with cold phosphate-buffered saline and harvested by trypsinization. HA-tagged ubiquitin expression was determined by Western blotting with rabbit anti-ubiquitin IgG (Calbiochem) and anti-HA tag IgG (Rockland Inc.). Immunoprecipitation—HeLa cells (90% confluent) from a 25-cm2 culture flask (∼2 × 106 cells) were transfected with 12 μg of HA-tagged ubiquitin expression vector using Lipofectamine 2000 reagent. Following 24 h of protein expression, cells were treated with cisplatin and collected by trypsinization. Total cell extracts were prepared by boiling the cells in 100 μl of hot SDS buffer and diluting in 600 μl of cold TD buffer as described previously (23Warren S.L. Landolfi A.S. Curtis C. Morrow J.S. J. Cell Sci. 1992; 103: 381-388Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The solution was sonicated and cleared by centrifugation. The cell extracts obtained were incubated with anti-HA antibody for 3 h at 4°C, and proteins were captured on protein G Plus-agarose beads (Calbiochem). The beads were washed five times with 1:6 hot SDS buffer/TD buffer. Proteins were eluted from the beads with SDS loading buffer and analyzed by Western blotting with mouse anti-pol II antibody H14. Immunoprecipitations of cell fractions with anti-HA antibody were carried out by diluting each fraction solution in 6× TD buffer, adding antibody, and capturing proteins as described above. Stability of pol II Stalled at a Platinum-DNA Lesion—A linear DNA template containing an AdML promoter and a cisplatin-DNA lesion with a biotin moiety was prepared (Fig. 1). In vitro transcription assays were carried out with the probe. The undamaged probe (no platinum) produced a runoff transcript of 185 nt. On the other hand, RNA transcripts ∼114 nt in length were generated when a cisplatin lesion stopped transcription elongation, as illustrated in Fig. 1. Transcription assays were also performed with DNA templates immobilized on streptavidin-coated magnetic beads. Preinitiation complexes were formed on the promoter site by incubating HeLa extract with the immobilized templates. Transcription elongation was started by adding NTPs to preinitiation complexes. Elongation complexes on the immobilized DNA templates were separated from the reaction solution at a different time point. RNA transcripts on beads or in solution were isolated and analyzed. As indicated above, a cisplatin 1,3-intrastrand cross-link strongly blocked the polymerase and yielded RNA transcripts ∼114 nt in length. Interestingly, most 114-nt transcripts were found on the beads (supplemental Fig. S3B), indicating that pol II stalled at a cisplatin lesion is fairly stable under these conditions. Stalled elongation complexes appeared to remain on DNA templates for at least 2 h (data not shown). Detergent such as Sarkosyl and heparin have been successfully used in in vitro transcription assays to remove transcription initiation and unstable elongation complexes (24Hawley D.K. Roeder R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 8163-8172Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Elongation complexes stalled at the site of cisplatin damage on the immobilized template were washed with transcription buffer containing 0.1% Triton X-100, followed by washing under more stringent conditions with solutions containing either 1% Sarkosyl or 100 μg/ml heparin. RNA transcripts in stalled ternary complexes were not eluted with these washes (supplemental Fig. S3C), indicating that the complexes are stable under these conditions. Ternary complexes stalled at the damage sites on immobilized DNA templates were also tracked by probing the pol II protein. After solid-phase in vitro transcription, the beads containing transcription complexes were separated from the reaction solution and sequentially washed with buffer solutions containing 0.1% Triton X-100, 1% Sarkosyl, and 2 m NaCl. The phospho-Ser-5 version of pol II in each fraction was analyzed by Western blotting with monoclonal antibody H14. This form of the enzyme is usually detected near the promoter region, whereas the phospho-Ser-2 version, which can be detected by antibodies such as H5, occurs at a more downstream position in the coding region. In our studies, the use of antibody H14 provided more sensitive and consistent results than work with antibody H5 (data not shown). Moreover, because multiple previous investigations of pol II ubiquitylation successfully employed antibody H14 (13Bregman D.B. Halaban R. van Gool A.J. Henning K.A. Friedberg E.C. Warren S.L. Proc.

Only a small portion of pol II was associated with the immobilized templates, which is typical for the in vitro transcription reaction with nuclear extracts as shown in Fig. 2A. In the reactions with both undamaged and damaged probes, similar amounts of pol II proteins, possibly from transcription initiation complexes, were eluted with a 1% Sarkosyl wash (Fig. 2A, lanes 3 and 7). Notably, however, only in the presence of cisplatin adducts did a considerable amount of pol II remain on the DNA templates, even after washing with 1% Sarkosyl (Fig. 2A, lane 4 versus lane 8). These data suggest that pol II proteins stalled at damage sites are resistant to a 1% Sarkosyl wash. To investigate the stability of pol II stalled at the damage sites in cells, changes in the cellular and subnuclear distribution of pol II upon DNA damage were examined. Following a reported procedure (20Wang Q.E. Zhu Q. Wani G. Chen J. Wani A"

We report herein that exogenous AA completely prevents cAMP-dependent inhibition of 5-LO translocation and LT biosynthesis in agonist-activated PMN. Moreover, the group IVA phospholipase A2 inhibitor pyrrophenone and the MEK inhibitor U-0126 inhibited AA release and 5-LO translocation in activated PMN, and these effects were also prevented by exogenous AA, demonstrating a functional link between AA release and 5-LO translocation. Polyunsaturated fatty acids of the C18 and C20 series containing at least three double bonds located from carbon 9 (or closer to the carboxyl group) were equally effective as AA in restoring 5-LO translocation in pyrrophenone-treated agonist-activated PMN. Importantly, experiments with the 5-LO-activating protein inhibitor MK-0591 and the intracellular Ca2+ chelator BAPTA-AM demonstrated that the AA-regulated 5-LO translocation is FLAP- and Ca2+-dependent. Finally, the redox and competitive 5-LO inhibitors L-685,015, L-739,010, and L-702,539 (but not cyclooxygenase inhibitors) efficiently substituted for AA to reverse the pyrrophenone inhibition of 5-LO translocation, indicating that the site of regulation of 5-LO translocation by AA is at or in the vicinity of the catalytic site.

The main sources of LT are phagocytes and mast cells. The initial steps of LT biosynthesis following cell activation include Ca2+ mobilization and the subsequent release of AA from membrane phospholipids by the cPLA2α. AA is then transformed by the 5-LO to the unstable allylic epoxide LTA4. The conjugation of glutathione to LTA4 is mediated by LTC4 synthase and results in the formation of LTC4, whereas the LTA4 hydrolase generates LTB4, a potent chemoattractant and activator of human PMN.Although LT biosynthesis has been investigated in many types of leukocytes over the past 25 years, the molecular mechanisms underlying the regulation of 5-LO activity are still incompletely understood. Early studies revealed that 5-LO was unique among the lipoxygenase family for its ability to translocate to nuclear membranes following cell activation (1Rouzer C.A. Samuelsson B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 7393-7397Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 2Rouzer C.A. Kargman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 10980-10988Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 3Kargman S.

Biochem. 1996; 238: 250-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). The mechanisms by which 5-LO translocates to nuclear membranes are, however, not well defined yet. The observation that 5-LO hydrophobicity increases when the enzyme is exposed to Ca2+ (10Hammarberg T. Rådmark O. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 4441-4447Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) led to the finding that 5-LO has a Ca2+ binding domain similar to the C2 domain described for protein kinase C and cPLA2α (11Hammarberg T. Provost P. Persson B. Rådmark O. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38787-38793Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). This domain, localized at the N terminus of the enzyme, has been demonstrated to be essential and sufficient for the translocation of the enzyme in HEK 293-transfected cells stimulated with A23187 (12Chen X.-S.

The role of FLAP in LT biosynthesis is intriguing and has not been fully characterized yet. The general consensus is that FLAP serves as a helper protein, presenting AA and 5-hydroperoxyeicosatetraenoic acid to the 5-LO, thereby increasing its catalytic potential (14Reid G.K. Kargman S.

In this study, we demonstrate that the translocation of 5-LO to the FLAP-containing membranes requires the release of AA in human PMNs. This represents the first demonstration that, under physiological conditions (PAF or fMLP stimulation), AA itself plays a key role in the cellular localization of 5-LO in human PMNs.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—Arachidonyltrifluoromethyl ketone (AACOCF3), methylarachidonyl fluorophosphonate, stearic acid (C18:0), oleic acid (9-C18: 1), linoleic acid (9,12-C18:2), α-linolenic acid (9,12,15-C18:3), eicosanoic acid (C20:0), 11,14(Z,Z)-eicosadienoic acid (11,14-C20:2), 5,8,11(Z,Z,Z)-eicosatrienoic acid (5,8,11-C20:3), dihomo-γ-linolenic acid (8,11,14-C20:3), 11,14,17(Z,Z,Z)-eicosatrienoic acid (11,14,17-C20:3), 5,8,11,14,17(Z,Z,Z,Z,Z)-eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), 5-oxo-ETE, 5(S)-, 5(R)-, 8(S)-, 8(R)-, 12(S)-, 12(R)-, 15(S)-, 15(R)-, and 20-HETE were purchased from Cayman Chemical (Ann Arbor, MI). AA (purity > 99%) was obtained either from Nu-Chek Prep Inc. (Elysian, MN) or Sigma; ethanolic solutions were stored under nitrogen at –80 °C and replaced every 4 months. 19-OH-PGB2, adenosine deaminase, arachidonylethylester, cytochalasin B (CB), Me2SO, fMLP, β-mercaptoethanol, Nonidet P-40, PAF, PGB2, and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride were obtained from Sigma. The mouse monoclonal 5-LO antibody was purchased from Research Diagnostics Inc. (Flanders, NJ). The rabbit phospho-ERK polyclonal antibody was purchased from Cell Signaling (Beverly, MA). L-685,015 (CPHU), L-739,010, L-702,539, MK-0591, and anti-5-LO antiserum LO-32 were a gift of Dr. Denis Riendeau from Merck Frosst Laboratories (Pointe Claire, Québec, Canada). Pyrrophenone was a gift of Dr. Kaoru Seno from Shionogi Research Laboratories (Osaka, Japan). The MEK inhibitors PD 98,059 and U-0216 were obtained from Calbiochem. The ECL Detection Kit was purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Hanks' balanced salt solution, Hepes, Ficoll-Paque, and Trypan blue were purchased from Wisent Laboratories (St. Bruno, Québec, Canada). Thapsigargin was from Research Biochemicals, Inc. (Natick, MA).Isolation of Human PMNs—Venous blood was obtained from healthy volunteers using heparin as anticoagulant, and PMNs were isolated as previously described (31Boyum A. Scand. J. Clin. Lab. Invest. 1968; : 77-89PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, blood was centrifuged (250 × g, 20 min, at room temperature), the platelet-rich plasma was discarded, and the erythrocytes were removed by dextran sedimentation. Mononuclear cells were then separated from the granulocytes by centrifugation on Ficoll-Paque cushions. Hypotonic lysis was performed on the granulocyte cell pellet to remove the remaining erythrocytes. The resulting suspensions contained mainly PMNs (≥95%) with eosinophils as the major contaminant. PMNs were then re-suspended at 107 cells/ml in Hanks' balanced salt solution containing 1.6 mm CaCl2.PMNs Stimulations—In experiments where PMNs were stimulated with agonists, pre-warmed PMNs suspensions (107 cells/ml, 37 °C) were treated with 700 pm granulocyte macrophage-colony stimulating factor, 1.5 nm tumor necrosis factor-α, and 10 μm CB during 30 min for priming. Cells were then stimulated with 600 nm of either PAF or fMLP for 5 min. In experiments where PMNs were stimulated with thapsigargin, pre-warmed PMNs suspensions (107 cells/ml, 37 °C) were preincubated for 30 min at 37 °C, then stimulated with 300 nm thapsigargin for 10 min. When indicated, CGS-21680 was added 5 min before stimulation of PMNs. In experiments where endogenous AA release was blocked by the cPLA2α inhibitor pyrrophenone, pre-warmed PMNs suspensions (107 cells/ml, 37 °C) were incubated with 10 μm CB and 100 nm pyrrophenone for 20 min then stimulated with 600 nm fMLP for 5 min. PD 98,059, U-0126, and CGS-21680 were added 20 min before stimulation of PMNs with the agonists. To eliminate the inhibitory constraint of endogenous adenosine on LT biosynthesis by PMNs (32Krump E. Picard S. Mancini J.A. Borgeat P. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 186: 1401-1406Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), 0.3 unit/ml adenosine deaminase was added 20 min before PMNs stimulation in all experimental settings. All incubations were stopped by the addition of one volume of cold (4 °C) incubation buffer, and samples were immediately centrifuged (600 × g, 90 s, 4 °C). Supernatants and cell pellets were processed for the analysis of 5-LO products and nuclear 5-LO, respectively, as described below.5-LO Product and AA Analysis—For the determination of 5-LO products and AA, supernatants were treated with 0.5 volume of a cold (4 °C) stop solution (MeOH/MeCN, 1/1 (v/v)) containing 12.5 ng of both 19-OH-PGB2 and PGB2 as internal standards; for AA analysis, the stop solution also contained 20 ng of [2H8]AA. The denatured supernatants were centrifuged (600 × g, 10 min) to eliminate the precipitated material, and the supernatants were collected and analyzed by reversed phase-HPLC using an online extraction procedure as described previously (33Borgeat P. Picard S. Vallerand P. Bourgoin S. Odeimat A. Sirois P. Poubelle P.E. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 187: 98-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Unless otherwise stated, the sum of LTB4, its ω-oxidation products (20-OH- and 20-COOH-LTB4), LTB4 isomers (6-(E)- and 6-(E)-12-epi-LTB4), and 5(S)-HETE), was compiled and is referred to as 5-LO products. For AA analysis, the AA-containing HPLC fractions were collected, evaporated to dryness under reduced pressure using a SpeedVac evaporator, and redissolved in 50 μl of MeCN for analysis by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry using electrospray ionization in the negative mode as described previously (33Borgeat P.

Methods Enzymol. 1990; 187: 98-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar).Analysis of 5-LO and Phospho-ERK—PMNs pellets were resuspended with 600 μl of cold (4 °C) lysis buffer (0.1% Nonidet P-40, 10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 10 mm NaCl, 3 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 10 μg/ml aprotinin and leupeptin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), vortexed for 15 s, kept on ice for 5 min, then centrifuged (525 × g, 10 min, 4 °C). Electrophoresis sample buffer (62.5 mm Tris, pH 6.8, 2% (w/v) SDS, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 5% β-mercaptoethanol, 0.01% (w/v) bromphenol blue, 10 μg/ml aprotinin and leupeptin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) was then added to the resulting supernatants and pellets (the nuclear fraction) as described previously (9Pouliot M.

Samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE (34Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206048) Google Scholar) using 10% polyacrylamide gels. Proteins were transferred at 0.5 Å for 3 h at 4°C onto Immobilon-P polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. Transfer efficiency and equal loading were visualized by Ponceau red staining. The membranes were soaked for 30 min at 25 °C in Tris-buffered saline (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 200 mm NaCl, 0.15% Tween 20) containing 5% dried milk (w/v), blotted with 5-LO or phospho-ERK antibody, and revealed using a horseradish peroxidase-coupled monoclonal antibody and the ECL detection kit.RESULTSAA Regulates 5-LO Translocation—We and others have shown that the inhibitory effect of elevated [cAMP]i on LT biosynthesis in PMNs correlates with inhibition of AA release (26Hichami A.

Moreover, we found that another key event of LT biosynthesis, the translocation of 5-LO, is also strongly and consistently inhibited by all cAMP-elevating agents tested (18Flamand N. Surette M.E. Picard S. Bourgoin S.G. Borgeat P. Mol. Pharmacol. 2002; 62: 250-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), suggesting a causal relationship between inhibition of AA release and 5-LO translocation in human PMNs. A first series of experiments was therefore performed to assess the involvement of AA in the cAMP-mediated inhibition of 5-LO translocation. As shown in Fig. 1 (A and B) the adenosine A2A receptor agonist CGS-21680, which increases [cAMP]i in PMNs, efficiently inhibited 5-LO translocation and LT biosynthesis in thapsigargin- and ligand-activated PMNs, in agreement with our previous observations (18Flamand N. Surette M.E. Picard S. Bourgoin S.G. Borgeat P. Mol. Pharmacol. 2002; 62: 250-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Interestingly, increasing concentrations of exogenous AA fully reversed this inhibitory effect of CGS-21680 on LT biosynthesis and 5-LO translocation in all stimulatory conditions tested, thereby providing the first evidence of a functional link between AA release and 5-LO translocation in activated human PMNs. Fig. 1C shows that similar results were obtained in experiments where 5-LO was analyzed in PMN membranes prepared by sonication and centrifugation (as opposed to detergent lysis) and Western blotting with LO-32 polyclonal antibody (as opposed to a monoclonal antibody for Fig. 1, A and B) using previously described methods (9Pouliot M.

Borgeat P. Mol. Pharmacol. 2002; 62: 250-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Finally, it seems important to mention that the effects of AA (and CGS-21680) on unstimulated human PMNs (not shown in this report) have been reported previously (35Surette M.E. Krump E. Picard S. Borgeat P. Mol. Pharmacol. 1999; 56: 1055-1062Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar); addition of AA to unstimulated human PMNs is a peculiar experimental condition where PMN activation (Ca2+ mobilization, 5-LO translocation, and LT biosynthesis) is strictly dependent on an autocrine stimulatory loop by LTB4 and consequently, results in cellular responses (to pharmacological agents) that distinctly differ from those observed in agonist-activated PMNs (herein and Ref. 18Flamand N. Surette M.E. Picard S. Bourgoin S.G. Borgeat P. Mol. Pharmacol. 2002; 62: 250-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar).There is now compelling evidence that the PLA2 involved in AA release and LT biosynthesis in activated PMNs is the cPLA2α (36Syrbu S.I.

To confirm the regulatory role of AA in 5-LO translocation, we investigated the effect of the potent and specific cPLA2α inhibitor pyrrophenone (39Ono T. Yamada K. Chikazawa Y. Ueno M. Nakamoto S.

Fig. 2 shows that LT biosynthesis was inhibited by pyrrophenone in fMLP-, PAF-, and thapsigargin-activated human PMNs; moreover, 5-LO translocation was completely blocked in ligand- and thapsigargin-activated PMNs treated with pyrrophenone, and this inhibitory effect of pyrrophenone on 5-LO translocation (and LT biosynthesis) was fully reversed by the addition of AA (Fig. 2B).FIG. 2Inhibitory effect of the cPLA2α inhibitor pyrrophenone on 5-LO translocation in activated human PMNs. Pre-warmed human PMNs suspensions (37 °C, 107 cells/ml) were preincubated with 100 nm pyrrophenone for 10 min then stimulated with either 5 μm AA, 600 nm PAF, 600 nm fMLP, or 300 nm thapsigargin as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Incubations were stopped, and the analysis of 5-LO products and nuclear 5-LO content was performed as described in Fig. 1 (A and B) legend.

Indeed, several studies have shown that the MEK inhibitors PD 98,059 and U-0126 are potent inhibitors of both cPLA2α phosphorylation and AA release in many cell types (36Syrbu S.I. Waterman W.H.

It was also shown that these MEK inhibitors block 5-LO translocation in fMLP-activated human PMNs (44Boden S.E. Bertsche T. Ammon H.P. Safayhi H. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2000; 32: 1069-1074Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Therefore, we investigated the effect of PD 98,059 and U-0126 on both AA release and 5-LO translocation in activated PMNs. Fig. 3A shows that U-0126 blocked AA release in agonist-activated PMNs in a dose-dependent manner (similar results were obtained with PD 98,059, not shown). This inhibition of AA release correlated with the inhibition of both ERK phosphorylation and 5-LO translocation (Fig. 3, B and C). Interestingly, addition of AA to the incubation media restored the translocation of 5-LO without affecting the phosphorylation of ERK, strongly suggesting that the inhibitory effect of MEK inhibitors on 5-LO translocation is the consequence of AA release inhibition.FIG. 3Effects of the MEK inhibitors U-0216 and PD 98,059 on AA release, ERK phosphorylation, and 5-LO translocation in activated human PMNs. Pre-warmed human PMNs suspensions (37 °C, 107 cells/ml) were preincubated for 20 min with the MEK inhibitors U-0126 or PD 98,059, then stimulated with either 600 nm PAF or 600 nm fMLP as described under “Experimental Procedures.” A, incubations were stopped after 2 min by the addition of 0.5 volume of cold (4 °C) stop solution containing 20 ng of [2H8]AA and 12.5 ng of both 19-OH-PGB2 and PGB2 as internal standards. AA was purified from the denatured incubation media by reversed phase-HPLC and analyzed by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The data shown are the mean (±S.E.) of duplicate incubations from two experiments.

https://openalex.org/W1991488642,"Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is characterized by the formation of multiple fluid-filled cysts that expand over time and destroy the renal architecture. Loss or mutation of polycystin-1 or polycystin-2, the respective proteins encoded by the ADPKD genes PKD1 and PKD2, is associated with most cases of ADPKD. Thus, the polycystin proteins likely play a role in cell proliferation and morphogenesis. Recent studies indicate that polycystin-1 is involved in these processes, but little is known about the role played by polycystin-2. To address this question, we created a number of related cell lines variable in their expression of polycystin-2. We show that the basal and epidermal growth factor-stimulated rate of cell proliferation is higher in cells that do not express polycystin-2 versus those that do, indicating that polycystin-2 acts as a negative regulator of cell growth. In addition, cells not expressing polycystin-2 exhibit significantly more branching morphogenesis and multicellular tubule formation under basal and hepatocyte growth factor-stimulated conditions than their polycystin-2-expressing counterparts, suggesting that polycystin-2 may also play an important role in the regulation of tubulogenesis. Cells expressing a channel mutant of polycystin-2 proliferated faster than those expressing the wild-type protein, but exhibited blunted tubule formation. Thus, the channel activity of polycystin-2 may be an important component of its regulatory machinery. Finally, we show that polycystin-2 regulation of cell proliferation appears to be dependent on its ability to prevent phosphorylated extracellular-related kinase from entering the nucleus. Our results indicate that polycystin-2 is necessary for the proper growth and differentiation of kidney epithelial cells and suggest a possible mechanism for the cyst formation seen in ADPKD2."
https://openalex.org/W1988914933,"The Gβγ complex of heterotrimeric G proteins is the most outstanding example for the divergent regulation of mammalian adenylyl cyclases. The heterodimeric Gβγ complex inhibits some isoforms, <i>e.g.</i> ACI, and stimulates the isoforms ACII, -IV, and -VII. Although former studies identified the QEHA region located in the C<sub>2</sub> domain of ACII as an important interaction site for Gβγ, the determinant of the stimulatory effect of Gβγ has not been detected. Here, we identified the C<sub>1b</sub> domain as the <i>stimulatory</i> region using full-length adenylyl cyclase. The relevant Gβγ signal transfer motif in IIC<sub>1b</sub> was determined as MTRYLESWGAAKPFAHL (amino acids 493–509). Amino acids of this PFAHL motif were absolutely necessary for ACII to be stimulated by Gβγ, whereas they were dispensable for Gα<sub>s</sub> or forskolin stimulation. The PFAHL motif is present in all three adenylyl cyclase isoforms that are activated by Gβγ but is absent in other adenylyl cyclase isoforms as well as other known effectors of Gβγ. The emerging concept of two contact sites on different molecule halves for effective regulation of adenylyl cyclase is discussed."

Chem. 277, 5952-5961) and H219P substitutions in the viral CypA binding loop confer the greatest replication advantage to HIV-1. These substitutions represent polymorphic amino acid residues. We found that the replication advantage conferred by these substitutions was far greater in CypA-rich MT-2 and H9 cells than in Jurkat cells and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBM), both of which contained less CypA. High intracellular CypA content in H9 and MT-2 cells, resulting in excessive CypA levels in virions, limited wild-type HIV-1 (HIV-1WT) replication and H219Q introduction into HIV-1 (HIV-1H219Q), reduced CypA incorporation of HIV-1, and potentiated viral replication. H219Q introduction also restored the otherwise compromised replication of HIV-1P222A in PBM, although the CypA content in HIV-1H219Q/P222A was comparable with that in HIV-1P222A, suggesting that H219Q affected the conformation of the CypA-binding motif, rendering HIV-1 replicative in a low CypA environment. Structural modeling analyses revealed that although hydrogen bonds are lost with H219Q and H219P substitutions, no significant distortion of the CypA binding loop of Gag occurred. The loop conformation of HIV-1P222A was found highly distorted, although H219Q introduction to HIV-1 restored the conformation of the loop close to that of HIV-1 P222A. The present data suggested that the effect of CypA on HIV-1 replicative WT ability is bimodal (both high and low CypA content limits HIV-1 replication), that the conformation of the CypA binding region of Gag is important for viral fitness, and that the function of CypA is to maintain the conformation.

However, the emergence of HIV-1 variants resistant to anti-HIV-1 therapeutic agents, including reverse transcriptase inhibitors and protease inhibitors (PIs), has limited the efficacy of chemotherapy (1Mitsuya H. Erickson J. Merigan T.C. Bartlet J.G. Bolognesi D. Textbook of AIDS Medicine. Williams & Wilkins, Baltimore1999: 751-780Google Scholar). HIV-1 develops resistance mainly by substituting amino acids in the target viral enzyme or component; however, recent studies have revealed that certain polymorphic amino acid residues also contribute to the viral resistance (2Kavlick M.F.

We recently found that multiple amino acid substitutions emerged in noncleavage sites of the Gag protein, which were associated with the development of HIV-1 resistance against PIs (4Gatanaga H.

Among such amino acid substitutions, H219Q, occurring in the cyclophilin A (CypA) binding loop in the p24 Gag protein, conferred the greatest replication advantage on HIV-1 (4Gatanaga H. Suzuki Y.

CypA binds to p24 Gag protein, resulting in the packaging of ∼200 copies of CypA into each HIV-1 virion (5Braaten D. Franke E.K. Luban J. J.

In the present study, we asked how H219Q and H219P substitutions occurring within the viral CypA binding loop conferred replication advantage to HIV-1, and we examined whether these substitutions affected the conformation and interaction of p24 Gag protein and CypA during HIV-1 propagation in various host cells. We also attempted to better understand the functional role of CypA in HIV-1 replication. To that end, we determined the virological and biochemical properties of a variety of recombinant infectious clones and their CypA contents. We also carried out molecular modeling analyses of the wild-type and mutated p24 Gag complex with CypA. The data demonstrate that both H219Q and H219P enhance HIV-1 replication by reducing viral CypA contents in daughter virions as produced in CypA-rich cells, but not in cells that has a low CypA content. We suggest that the effect of CypA on HIV-1 replicative ability is bimodal, both high and low contents of CypA limit HIV-1 replication. The data also suggest that the conformation of p24 Gag is strongly correlated with viral fitness. Antiviral Agents—Three PIs, KNI-272, JE-2147, and UIC-94003, were synthesized as described previously (12Mimoto T. Imai J. Kisanuki S. Enomoto H. Hattori N. Akaji K. Kiso Y. Chem. Pharm.

Generation of HIV-1 Variants Resistant to PIs—The wild-type infectious clone, HIV-1WT, produced by COS-7 cells transfected with pHIV-1NL4-3 was propagated in human CD4+ MT-2 or H9 cells in the presence of increasing concentrations of an antiretroviral agent as described previously (4Gatanaga H.

Briefly, MT-2 or H9 cells (5 × 105) were exposed to wild-type HIV-11NL4-3 and cultured in the presence of each PI at initial concentrations of 0.0005-0.03 μm. When the virus began to propagate in the presence of the drug, the drug concentration was increased. This selection was carried out for a total of 27-80 passages. For the generation of JE-2147-resistant virus, an infectious clone carrying I84V substitution in the protease (HIV-1I84V) was employed instead of HIV-1WT (14Yoshimura K. Kato R. Yusa K. Kavlick M.F. Maroun V. Nguyen A. Mimoto T. Ueno T. Shintani M. Falloon J. Masur H. Hayashi H. Erickson J. Mitsuya H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 8675-8680Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Proviral DNA in the lysates of HIV-1-infected cells of the last passage was sequenced as indicated (4Gatanaga H. Suzuki Y. Tsang H. Yoshimura K. Kavlick M.F. Nagashima K. Gorelick R.J. Mardy S. Tang C. Summers M.F. Mitsuya H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 5952-5961Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Generation of Recombinant HIV-1 Clones—To generate HIV-1 clones carrying the desired mutations, the site-directed mutagenesis was performed, and the mutation-containing genomic fragments thus obtained were introduced to pHIV-1NLSma as described previously (4Gatanaga H. Suzuki Y. Tsang H. Yoshimura K. Kavlick M.F. Nagashima K. Gorelick R.J. Mardy S. Tang C. Summers M.F. Mitsuya H. J. Biol.

An infectious clone containing P222A mutation in Gag was generated using a plasmid kindly provided by Drs. D. Braaten and J. Luban (5Braaten D. Franke E.K. Luban J. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 3551-3560Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Each recombinant plasmid was transfected into COS-7 cells, and the obtained infectious virions were harvested 48 h after transfection and stored at -80°C until use (4Gatanaga H. Suzuki Y. Tsang H. Yoshimura K. Kavlick M.F. Nagashima K. Gorelick R.J. Mardy S. Tang C. Summers M.F. Mitsuya H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 5952-5961Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Replication Kinetic Assay—MT-2, H9, Jurkat cells (105), or phytohemagglutinin-stimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PHA-PBM: 5 × 106) were exposed to each infectious virus preparation (500 blue-cell-forming units defined in the MAGI assay) (17Kimpton J. Emerman M. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 2232-2239Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) for 12 h, washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, and cultured in 5 ml of complete medium in the presence or absence of cyclosporin A (CsA). Culture supernatants (200 μl) were harvested every other day or every 4 days, and p24 Gag amounts were determined using a commercially available radioimmunoassay kit (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit (Beckman Instruments, Fullerton, CA) was also used for the determination of p24 Gag amounts as needed. Competitive HIV-1 Replication Assay Using PHA-PBM—In order to compare the replication rates of infectious HIV-1 clones, the competitive HIV-1 replication assay (CHRA) was performed as described previously (18Kosalaraksa P. Kavlick M.F. Maroun V. Le R. Mitsuya H. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 5356-5363Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) with some modifications. In brief, PHA-PBMs (5 × 106) were exposed to various mixtures of the paired infectious clones to be examined for their replicative ability and were cultured for the indicated times. Every 7 days, the supernatants of the virus co-culture were transferred to freshly prepared uninfected PHA-PBM cultures. DNA purified from the cells harvested at each passage was subjected to direct DNA sequencing of the HIV-1 genome, and viral population changes were evaluated based on relative peak heights in the electropherogram (18Kosalaraksa P. Kavlick M.F. Maroun V. Le R. Mitsuya H. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 5356-5363Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Western Blot Analysis—For the analysis of cellular CypA contents, MT-2 cells, H9 cells, Jurkat cells, or PHA-PBMs were lysed with lysis buffer (4Gatanaga H. Suzuki Y. Tsang H. Yoshimura K. Kavlick M.F. Nagashima K. Gorelick R.J. Mardy S. Tang C. Summers M.F. Mitsuya H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 5952-5961Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar), and the amounts of lysates were normalized with cell numbers or total protein contents using a bicinchoninic acid protein assay kit (Pierce). For the analysis of virion-associated CypA, the culture supernatants of chronically HIV-1-infected H9 or Jurkat cells were centrifuged and passed through a 0.22-μm pore-size filter to remove cellular debris; the filtrates were normalized with p24 contents measured with radioimmunoassay and were ultracentrifuged to pellet virions (4Gatanaga H. Suzuki Y. Tsang H. Yoshimura K. Kavlick M.F. Nagashima K. Gorelick R.J. Mardy S. Tang C. Summers M.F. Mitsuya H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 5952-5961Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). The pelleted virions were lysed in lysis buffer. The resultant samples were processed with SDS-polyacrylamide gradient gels, and CypA was visualized by SuperSignalWestPico (Pierce) using anti-CypA antiserum (Biomol, Plymouth Meeting, PA). An anti-p24 Gag antiserum (Advanced Biotechnologies, Inc., Columbia, MD) served as a control to ensure that appropriate amounts of the samples were loaded. The signal density of CypA and p24 Gag was analyzed on a Windows computer by using the ImageJ Program (developed at National Institutes of Health, rsb.info.nih.gov/ij/) as published previously (19Tamiya S. Mardy S. Kavlick M.F. Yoshimura K. Mitsuya H. J. Virol. 2004; 78: 12030-12040Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Molecular Modeling of the p24CA151-CypA Complex with p24 Amino Acid Substitutions—The crystal structure of human CypA that was bound to the amino-terminal domain of p24 Gag (capsid residues 1-151 (CA151), Protein Data Bank code 1AK4) (9Gamble T.R.

Cell. 1996; 87: 1285-1294Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (607) Google Scholar) was analyzed to determine the changes with H219Q or H219P substitution. There were two CA-CypA complexes in the structure. Chain A of CypA and chain D of CA form one complex and were retained for the calculation. Identical results should be obtained with the other complex (chain B of CypA and chain C of CA) because the conformations of both CypA and CA in these complexes are quite similar. Structural modifications, visualization, and analysis were performed utilizing the Maestro interface from Schrödinger (Maestro 7.0, Schrödinger, LLC, New York). OPLS2003 force field (20Kaminski G.A. Friesner R.A. Tirado-Rives J. Jorgensen W.J. J. Phys. Chem. 2001; 105: 6474-6487Crossref Scopus (3224) Google Scholar) as implemented in MacroModel 9.0 (MacroModel, version 9.0, Schrödinger, LLC, New York) was used for minimizing mutated structures and for carrying out molecular dynamics calculations. OPLS2003 uses an enhanced version of the widely used OPLS-AA force field and has improved parameters for peptides. It was verified that the force field had high quality bond stretching, bending, and torsional parameters. Charges were taken from the force field. Molecular dynamics calculations were carried out on the wild-type complex and on the mutated structures. The structures were initially minimized for 2500 iterations. A constant temperature of 300 K and SHAKE constraints for bonds to hydrogens were used. The GB/SA continuum solvation model, with water as the solvent, was used (21Still W.C. Tempczyk A. Hawley R.C. Hendrickson T. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1990; 112: 6127-6129Crossref Scopus (3363) Google Scholar). While calculating nonbonded interactions, cut-off distances of 8 and 20 Å were used for van der Waals and electrostatic interactions, respectively. Using a time step of 2 fs, the structures were equilibrated for 20 ps, and the simulation was carried out for 1 ns. Structures were monitored at intervals of every 50 ps. Calculations were carried out on an SGI Origin 3400 computer platform. For the wild type and for each mutant structure, 1-ns molecular dynamics calculation takes about 11 days under the stated conditions on this high performance computational platform. Amino Acid Substitutions Identified in p24 Gag Protein in HIV-1 Variants Resistant to PI—We have reported previously that several amino acid substitutions were seen in common in the Gag protein at noncleavage sites among HIV-1 variants that acquired in vitro a high multitude of resistance to PIs such as APV, JE-2147, KNI-272, and UIC-94003 (4Gatanaga H. Suzuki Y. Tsang H. Yoshimura K. Kavlick M.F. Nagashima K. Gorelick R.J. Mardy S. Tang C. Summers M.F. Mitsuya H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 5952-5961Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). In an attempt to corroborate and extend our previous observations and to determine how often such amino acid substitutions develop in the Gag protein, we examined four more HIV-1 variants that were selected in vitro against various PIs, including three novel PIs, UIC-00041, UIC-00142, and UIC-00145. Table 1 depicts the properties of eight PI-resistant HIV-1 variants (including four HIV-1 variants reported previously). Seven of the eight variants were selected against PIs in MT-2 cells, although one variant was selected in H9 cells. The strains used were HIV-11NL4-3 and HIV-1LAI, and 3-6-amino acid substitutions were identified in the protease. It was noted that all eight variants had in common an amino acid substitution at position 219 in p24 Gag protein, seven variants 219 had H219Q substitution and one had H219P substitution. The His residue is located within the CypA binding loop and is thought to play a role in the p24 Gag interactions with CypA through a hydrogen bond and hydrophobic contact(s) (9Gamble T.R. Vajdos F.F. Yoo S. Worthylake D.K. Houseweart M. Sundquist W.I. Hill C.P. Cell. 1996; 87: 1285-1294Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (607) Google Scholar). It is worth noting that when HIV-11NL4-3 was propagated in the absence of PI in MT-2 cells, the virus also acquired H219Q, V218M, or A224V mutation by passage 10 (4Gatanaga H. Suzuki Y. Tsang H. Yoshimura K. Kavlick M.F. Nagashima K. Gorelick R.J. Mardy S. Tang C. Summers M.F. Mitsuya H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 5952-5961Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). It should be noted that two amino acids, Val218 and Ala224, are also located within the CypA binding loop of the p24 Gag protein and are also known to interact with CypA through hydrophobic contacts (9Gamble T.R. Vajdos F.F. Yoo S. Worthylake D.K. Houseweart M. Sundquist W.I. Hill C.P. Cell. 1996; 87: 1285-1294Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (607) Google Scholar). These data, taken together, strongly suggest that the amino acids interacting with CypA, in particular His219, are prone to undergo substitutions under certain circumstances and are associated with viral replication fitness. Indeed, in the HIV Sequence Compendium 2000 (22Kuiken C. Foley B. Hahn B. Marx P. McCutchan F. Mellors J.W. Mullins J. Wolinsky S. Korber B. Bradac J. Human Retroviruses and AIDS. Los Alamos National Laboratory, Los Alamos, NM2000: 201-298Google Scholar), of 88 different HIV-1 strains, 65 had histidine at the position 219, whereas 13 had glutamine, and 4 had proline at the position 219, indicating that both Gln219 and Pro219 represent polymorphic amino acid residues. Hence, the present data suggest that these two polymorphic amino acids are associated with viral fitness and possibly to the acquisition of resistance to certain PIs.TABLE 1Amino acid substitutions identified in the protease and p24 Gag protein of HIV-1 variants selected against PIAmino acid substitutions identified inPIStrainCellPassageProteasep24KNI-272HIV-1NL4-3aPI-resistant HIV-1 variants described previously (4) are shown.MT-227V32I/M46I/V82I/I84VH219QKNI-272HIV-1LAIH955V32I/L33F/K45I/F53L/A71V/I84VH219QAPVHIV-1NL4-3aPI-resistant HIV-1 variants described previously (4) are shown.MT-231L10F/V32I/M46I/I54M/A71V/I84VH219QJE-2147HIV-1NL4-3/184VaPI-resistant HIV-1 variants described previously (4) are shown.MT-233M46I/I47V/V82I/I84VH219QUIC-94003HIV-1NL4-3aPI-resistant HIV-1 variants described previously (4) are shown.MT-262L10F/A28S/M46I/I50V/A71VQ199H/H219QUIC-00041HIV-1NL4-3MT-273K43I/L63P/V82IM200I/H219PUIC-00142HIV-1NL4-3MT-284L10F/V32I/M46I/I84VH219QUIC-00145HIV-1NL4-3MT-280L10F/V32I/M46I/I47A/K55NH219Qa PI-resistant HIV-1 variants described previously (4Gatanaga H.

Open table in a new tab Effects of Gag Mutations at Position 219 on HIV-1 Replication—In order to examine the effects of the Gag mutation at position 219 on HIV-1 replication, we generated two infectious HIV-1 clones, HIV-1H219Q and HIV-1H219P, and we assessed their virologic properties. In MT-2 cells, HIV-1H219Q rapidly replicated compared with the wild-type HIV-1WT(His-219) (Fig. 2A), in agreement with our previous observation (4Gatanaga H. Suzuki Y. Tsang H. Yoshimura K.

HIV-1H219Q also replicated more rapidly than HIV-1WT in H9 cells (Fig. 2B). HIV-1H219P replicated as rapidly as HIV-1H219Q, suggesting that the amino acid at position 219 is critical for the replication fitness of HIV-1. When we examined the fitness of the three infectious clones (HIV-1WT, HIV-1H219Q, and HIV-1H219P) in CD4+ Jurkat cells and PHA-PBM, there was no significant difference seen in their replication fitness (Fig. 2, C and D). Competitive HIV-1 Replication Assays for H219Q Mutation in PHA-PBM—As shown above, although HIV-1H219Q exhibited a greater replication capability when propagated in MT-2 and H9 cells compared with HIV-1WT, there was no apparent difference in the replication profiles of HIV-1H219Q and HIV-1WT as propagated in PHA-PBM (Fig. 2, A, B and D). In order to evaluate the possible biological relevance of the replication kinetic data generated by using immortalized and long term cultured MT-2 and H9 cells, we conducted a modified competitive HIV-1 replication assay (CHRA) (18Kosalaraksa P. Kavlick M.F. Maroun V. Le R. Mitsuya H. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 5356-5363Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), in which freshly prepared PHA-PBM served as host cells. HIV-1H219Q readily and uniformly overgrew HIV-1WT in CHRA regardless of three different ratios of paired clones used in the assay (Fig. 2, E-G). These data indicated that the H219Q substitution conferred replication advantages on HIV-1 when propagated in immortalized CD4+ T cells as well as PHA-PBM. It should be noted, however, that the replication advantage of HIV-1 acquired with the H219Q substitution was limited in PHA-PBM and was detected only when assessed with CHRA. MT-2 and H9 Cells Contain Greater Amounts of CypA—The Gag mutations H219Q and H219P conferred significant replication advantage on HIV-1 as propagated in MT-2 cells and H9 cells, but such advantage was limited in PHA-PBM. Considering that His219 is located within the CypA binding loop and that HIV-1 replication is known to be affected by intracellular CypA contents (6Franke E.K. Yuan H.E. Luban J. Nature. 1994; 372: 359-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (648) Google Scholar, 7Braaten D. Luban J. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1300-1309Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar), we examined intracellular CypA content in each cell preparation by using Western blot analysis. As shown in Fig. 3, A and B, the CypA contents in 104 MT-2 (relative density, 100%) and 104 H9 cells (79.6%) appeared to be greater than those in 5 × 104 Jurkat cells (55.4%) and 5 × 104 PHA-PBM (42.9%), suggesting that MT-2 and H9 cells contained 6-12 times as much CypA per cell as Jurkat cells and PHA-PBM. As normalized with total cellular protein amounts, the CypA content in 1 μg of MT-2 and H9 cellular protein preparations was comparable with that in 2-4 μg of Jurkat protein preparations and that in 4 μg of PHA-PBM protein, suggesting that the former two cell preparations contained 2-4-fold greater amounts of CypA per cellular protein than the latter two cell preparations. These data showed that MT-2 and H9 cells have greater CypA amounts than Jurkat T cells and PHA-PBM. Decreased CypA Incorporation into HIV-1H219Q Virions—Considering that the data from crystal structure analyses by Gamble et al. (9Gamble T.R. Vajdos F.F. Yoo S. Worthylake D.K. Houseweart M. Sundquist W.I. Hill C.P. Cell. 1996; 87: 1285-1294Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (607) Google Scholar) of p2471 Gag protein111 complexed with CypA showing that His219 binds to Asn and Gln of CypA through a hydrogen bond and hydrophobic contact(s), respectively, we postulated that H219Q and H219P substitutions cancel or weaken such hydrogen bonds, resulting in the reduction of p24 binding to CypA and of CypA incorporation into daughter virions, leading to increased HIV-1 replication in CypA-rich MT-2 and H9 cells. We then examined the virion-associated CypA amounts in three infectious HIV-1 clones containing HIV-1WT, HIV-1H219Q, and HIV-1H219P, employing Western blotting analysis using anti-p24 Gag and anti-CypA antisera. The culture supernatants of chronically HIV-1-infected H9 cells were prepared to contain the same amount of p24. The virions in each supernatant thus prepared were pelleted by ultra-centrifugation and subsequently subjected to SDS-PAGE. Direct sequencing of cellular DNA confirmed that no unintended mutations developed during the culture. As shown in Fig. 3C-1-3, the experiment was performed three times. Percent densities of the CypA signal relative to each p24 Gag signal (making each signal 100%) were 11.1, 7.38, and 6.01% (Fig. 3C-1); 6.99, 4.99, and 4.71% (Fig. 3C-2), and 18.1, 12.0, and 11.2% (Fig. 3C-3) for HIV-1WT/H9, HIV-1H219Q/H9, and HIV-1H219P/H9, respectively. These data demonstrated that H219Q and H219P substitutions increased HIV-1 replication in CypA-rich cells, which was associated with the substantial reduction of CypA incorporation into daughter virions. p24 Gag Binding to CypA Affects HIV-1 Replication Kinetics—Yin et al. (23Yin L. Braaten D. Luban J. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 6430-6436Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) have reported that the addition of CsA (0.5 μm) reduces CypA incorporation into daughter virions and increases replication rates of HIV-11NL4-3 in H9 cells, suggesting that exc"

Still, recent clinical trials have revealed a significant secondary toxicity of bortezomib. Consequently, there is much interest in dissecting the mechanism of action of this compound to rationally improve its therapeutic index. The cytotoxic effect of bortezomib is frequently characterized by interfering with downstream events derived from the accumulation of proteasomal targets. Here we identify the first chemical agent able to act upstream of the proteasome to prevent cell killing by bortezomib. Specifically, we show that the polyhydroxyl compound Tiron can function as a competitive inhibitor of bortezomib. This effect of Tiron was surprising, since it is a classical radical spin trap and was expected to scavenge reactive oxygen species produced as a consequence of bortezomib action. The inhibitory effect of Tiron against bortezomib was selective, since it was not shared by other antioxidants, such as vitamin E, MnTBAP, l-N-acetyl-cysteine, and FK-506. Comparative analyses with nonboronated proteasome inhibitors (i.e. MG132) revealed a specificity of Tiron for bortezomib. We exploited this novel feature of Tiron to define the “point of no return” of proteasome inhibition in melanoma cells and to block cell death in a three-dimensional model of human skin. Cells from T-cell lymphoma, breast carcinoma, and non-small cell lung cancer were also responsive to Tiron, suggesting a broad impact of this agent as a bortezomib blocker. These results may have important implications for the analysis of bortezomib in vivo and for the design of drug mixtures containing proteasome inhibitors.

These results may have important implications for the analysis of bortezomib in vivo and for the design of drug mixtures containing proteasome inhibitors. The 26 S proteasome is a multicatalytic protease responsible for most nonlysosomal intracellular protein degradation (1Glickman M.H. Ciechanover A. Physiol. Rev. 2002; 82: 373-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (3304) Google Scholar, 2Bashir T. Pagano M. Adv. Cancer Res. 2003; 88: 101-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 3Liu C.W. Corboy M.J. DeMartino G.N. Thomas P.J. Science. 2003; 299: 408-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). Interestingly, multiple pro-oncogenic factors are controlled by the proteasome. Those include transcriptional factors, cyclins, cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors, cytokines, and a series of pro- and antiapoptotic factors (including Bim or Mcl-1, respectively) that can function as rheostats of cell fate (4Jesenberger V. Jentsch S. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 3: 112-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). Therefore, inhibition of the proteasome is emerging as a potent cellular tool to selectively kill tumor cells by exploiting their altered genetic background (5Adams J. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2004; 4: 349-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (1054) Google Scholar, 6Rajkumar S.V. Richardson P.G. Hideshima T. Anderson K.C. J. Clin. Oncol. 2005; 23: 630-639Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar). Experimental and clinical support for this therapeutic strategy has been provided by bortezomib (Velcade™, formerly known as PS-341) (7Adams J. Cancer Cell. 2004; 5: 417-421Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (676) Google Scholar).Bortezomib is a cell-permeable dipeptide boronic acid that can reversibly inhibit the chymotryptic-like proteolytic activity of the β5 subunit of the proteasome (8Adams J. Palombella V.J. Sausville E.A. Johnson J. Destree A. Lazarus D.D. Maas J. Pien C.S. Prakash S. Elliott P.J. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 2615-2622PubMed Google Scholar, 9Elliott P.J. Zollner T.M. Boehncke W.H. J. Mol. Med. 2003; 81: 235-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). A salient pharmacological feature of bortezomib is its ability to bypass classical multidrug resistance mechanisms (9Elliott P.J. Zollner T.M. Boehncke W.H. J. Mol. Med. 2003; 81: 235-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar, 10Schwartz R. Davidson T. Oncology (Huntingt.). 2004; 18: 14-21PubMed Google Scholar). For example, we have recently shown that cell lines isolated from early, intermediate, and advanced melanoma (a paradigm of chemoresistant tumor types) can be efficiently killed by bortezomib in conditions that maintain the viability of their normal cellular counterparts (11Fernandez Y. Verhaegen M. Miller T.P. Rush J.L. Steiner P. Opipari Jr., A.W. Lowe S.W. Soengas M.S. Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 6294-6304Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Similar antineoplastic activity has been reported in a variety of solid and hematological cancers (6Rajkumar S.V. Richardson P.G. Hideshima T. Anderson K.C. J. Clin. Oncol. 2005; 23: 630-639Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar, 12Park D.J. Lenz H.J. Ann. Med. 2004; 36: 296-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 13Richardson P. Cancer Treat. Rev. 2003; 29: 33-39Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Based on these results, multiple randomized clinical trials are currently under way. In particular, a high response rate has been reported in multiple myeloma, where the United States Food and Drug Administration granted approval for the use of bortezomib in patients with relapsed and refractory tumors (14Bross P.F. Kane R. Farrell A.T. Abraham S. Benson K. Brower M.E. Bradley S. Gobburu J.V. Goheer A. Lee S.L. Leighton J. Liang C.Y. Lostritto R.T. McGuinn W.D. Morse D.E. Rahman A. Rosario L.A. Verbois S.L. Williams G. Wang Y.C. Pazdur R. Clin. Cancer Res. 2004; 10: 3954-3964Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar).Despite the efficacy of bortezomib in hematological malignancies, clinical trials and experimental mouse models suggest that solid tumors are likely to require additional combination therapies for long term responses (11Fernandez Y. Verhaegen M. Miller T.P. Rush J.L. Steiner P. Opipari Jr., A.W. Lowe S.W. Soengas M.S. Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 6294-6304Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar, 12Park D.J. Lenz H.J. Ann.

Erlichman C. Cancer. 2005; 103: 2584-2589Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). The secondary toxicity of bortezomib poses also an important clinical limitation (e.g. grade 3 trombocytopenia and peripheral neuropathy can affect 10-30% of patients). Although these adverse effects can be managed with supportive measures, they compromise dose and treatment schedules (17Colson K. Doss D.S. Swift R. Tariman J. Thomas T.E. Clin. J. Oncol. Nurs. 2004; 8: 473-480Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, there is a large interest in defining the mode of action of bortezomib to rationally design therapeutic strategies that can improve its anti-cancer effect.The identification of the key effectors of the cytotoxic effect of bortezomib as well as cellular or chemical factors able to oppose or inhibit its action has been complicated by the fact that the proteasome controls the half-life of the vast majority (up to 80%) of cellular proteins (5Adams J. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2004; 4: 349-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (1054) Google Scholar, 7Adams J. Cancer Cell. 2004; 5: 417-421Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (676) Google Scholar). Most frequently, the impact of bortezomib in normal or tumor cells is determined by interfering with events suspected to act downstream of proteasome inhibition. Those range from stress kinases to survival signals or apoptotic factors (18Mitsiades N. Mitsiades C.S. Poulaki V. Chauhan D. Richardson P.G. Hideshima T. Munshi N. Treon S.P. Anderson K.C. Blood. 2002; 99: 4079-4086Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar). In addition, the dysregulation of mitochondrial functions and release of ROS 3The abbreviations and trivial names used are: ROSreactive oxygen speciesAMC7-amido-4-methylcoumarinBz-4231,4-benzodiazepineDCF2′,7′-dichlorofluoresceinDiOC6(3)3,3′-dihexyloxacarbocyanine iodideFK-506tacrolimusl-NACl-N-acetylcysteineMnTBAPmanganese(III)meso-tetrakis(4-benzoic acid)porphyrinMTT3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromideTiron4,5-dihydroxy-1,3-benzene disulfonic acidTUNELterminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labelingVit Evitamin EGSTglutathione S-transferaseCHAPS3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid. 3The abbreviations and trivial names used are: ROSreactive oxygen speciesAMC7-amido-4-methylcoumarinBz-4231,4-benzodiazepineDCF2′,7′-dichlorofluoresceinDiOC6(3)3,3′-dihexyloxacarbocyanine iodideFK-506tacrolimusl-NACl-N-acetylcysteineMnTBAPmanganese(III)meso-tetrakis(4-benzoic acid)porphyrinMTT3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromideTiron4,5-dihydroxy-1,3-benzene disulfonic acidTUNELterminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labelingVit Evitamin EGSTglutathione S-transferaseCHAPS3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid. are also common processes induced by bortezomib (5Adams J.

Thus, as early as 3-4 h after bortezomib treatment, tumor cells from non-small cell lung cancer or squamous carcinoma dysregulate the mitochondrial membrane potential (Δψm) and accumulate a significant amount ROS, subsequently leading to caspase activation (19Ling Y.H. Liebes L. Zou Y. Perez-Soler R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 33714-33723Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar, 20Fribley A. Zeng Q. Wang C.Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 9695-9704Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar).The response of melanoma cells to bortezomib is intriguing. We and others have recently shown that bortezomib is able to bypass the traditional resistance of these tumor cells to standard chemotherapeutic agents, in part by an effective induction of the Bcl-2 homology domain 3-only proapoptotic protein NOXA (11Fernandez Y. Verhaegen M. Miller T.P. Rush J.L. Steiner P. Opipari Jr., A.W. Lowe S.W. Soengas M.S. Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 6294-6304Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar, 21Qin J.Z. Ziffra J. Stennett L. Bodner B. Bonish B.K. Chaturvedi V. Bennett F. Pollock P.M. Trent J.M. Hendrix M.J. Rizzo P. Miele L. Nickoloff B.J. Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 6282-6293Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). Despite a fast activation of NOXA (detectable by 6 h post-treatment), the processing of the apoptotic effectors, the caspases, was relatively slow (11Fernandez Y. Verhaegen M. Miller T.P. Rush J.L. Steiner P. Opipari Jr., A.W. Lowe S.W. Soengas M.S. Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 6294-6304Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Thus, it was possible that, compared with other cell types, in melanoma cells bortezomib was not as effective an inducer of events such as ROS production that can cooperate with caspase activation.To establish the contribution of ROS to bortezomib-induced melanoma cell death, we performed a comparative kinetic analysis of Δψm and ROS levels in normal melanocytes and melanoma cells. In addition, to prove the requirement of ROS for the cytotoxic effect of bortezomib, cells were treated with the antioxidants manganese(III)meso-tetrakis(4-benzoic acid) porphyrin (MnTBAP), vitamin E (Vit E), and l-N-acetylcysteine (l-NAC) or the inhibitor of superoxide anion (O2·¯) production tacrolimus (FK-506). The polyhydroxyl compound disodium 4,5-dihydroxybenzene-1,3-disulfonate (Tiron) was also included in this study as an example of a potent antioxidant (22MacKenzie A. Martin W. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1998; 124: 719-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 23Yamada J. Yoshimura S. Yamakawa H. Sawada M. Nakagawa M. Hara S. Kaku Y. Iwama T. Naganawa T. Banno Y. Nakashima S. Sakai N. Neurosci. Res. 2003; 45: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar) that has been recently used to validate a critical role of ROS as an early mediator of cell death induced by bortezomib (19Ling Y.H. Liebes L. Zou Y. Perez-Soler R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 33714-33723Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar, 20Fribley A. Zeng Q. Wang C.Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 9695-9704Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar).Surprisingly, of all of the ROS scavengers tested, only Tiron blocked bortezomib-induced cell death (in a selective manner and in multiple cell types). This protective effect was specific for bortezomib, since Tiron had no impact on cell death and accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins by MG132, a different class of proteasome inhibitor. The unexpected mode of action of Tiron was exploited to address mechanistic aspects of the antineoplastic activity of bortezomib and to reduce its toxicity toward normal cells. In addition, we developed an artificial skin reconstruction model to analyze the selectivity of bortezomib for tumor cells and the protective effect of Tiron in a system that recapitulates the architecture of the human skin in vivo.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESReagents and Antibodies—Bortezomib was obtained from Millennium Pharmaceuticals Inc.

Meier F. Hsu M.Y. Berking C. Herlyn M. Cancer Metastasis Rev. 1999; 18: 401-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Melanocytes and keratinocytes were maintained in 154 media with the corresponding melanocyte or keratinocyte growth supplements (Clonetics). Fibroblasts were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. Jurkat (human acute leukemia cell line), MDA-MB-231 (human breast carcinoma cells) and H460 (human non-small cell lung cancer cells) were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). Jurkat and H460 were grown in RPMI 1640 (Invitrogen), MDA-MB-231 and the metastatic melanoma cell lines SK-Mel-19 and SK-Mel-103 were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen). Medium for fibroblasts and tumor cells was supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and penicillin/streptomycin (Invitrogen).Cell Viability—The percentage of dead cells at the indicated times and drug concentrations was estimated by standard trypan blue exclusion or by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT)-based assays as described elsewhere (26McCurrach M.E. Lowe S.W. Methods Cell Biol. 2001; 66: 197-227Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For simplicity, control samples, which were incubated only with solvent (0.05% Me2SO), are indicated as nontreated.Protein Immunoblotting—To monitor changes in protein expression, 2 × 106 cells were treated with the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib (50 nm) in the absence or presence of Tiron (1 mm) or l-NAC (10 mm). At the indicated time points, whole cell lysates were prepared by Laemmli extraction. 50 μg of protein were subjected to electrophoresis in 12 or 4-15% gradient SDS gels and subsequently transferred to Immobilon-P membranes (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA). The corresponding antibody signal was visualized with the ECL detection system (Amersham Biosciences).Preparation of Mitochondrial Extracts—To analyze the release of mitochondial factors from the mitochondria, the indicated melanoma cells were treated with 50 nm bortezomib. Floating and adherent cells were pooled at different times post-treatment. Cytosolic and membrane-rich fractions were prepared by digitonin extraction as described in Ref. 11Fernandez Y. Verhaegen M.

Standard protein immunoblotting was used to visualize changes in the localization of Smac as an example of a mitochondrial proapoptotic factor released upon bortezomib treatment.Detection of Intracellular ROS—Normal melanocytes or melanoma cells were seeded in 6-well plates at a density of 2 × 104 cells/well. 18 h after plating, cells were treated with 50 nm bortezomib, and 30 min before the indicated collection times, they were loaded with 100 μm 2′,7′-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate. Cell pellets were washed twice in phosphate-buffered saline, and the fluorescence of the oxidized product, 2′,7′-dichlorofluorescein (DCF), was measured by a FACSCalibur flow cytometer as described elsewhere (27Blatt N.B. Bednarski J.J. Warner R.E. Leonetti F. Johnson K.M. Boitano A. Yung R. Richardson B.C. Johnson K.J. Ellman J.A. Opipari Jr., A.W. Glick G.D. J. Clin.

DiOC6(3)-dependent fluorescence was monitored on a FACSCalibur flow cytometer as previously described, using cells treated with carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone (1 mm) as a reference control for disruption of Δψm (27Blatt N.B.

McCormack T.A. Pien C.S. Chau V. Adams J. Elliott P.J. Clin. Chem. 2000; 46: 673-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). Briefly, 3 × 105 melanoma cells were incubated for various periods of time in the presence or absence of 50 nm bortezomib or 1 mm Tiron (as single agents or in combination). Floating and adherent cells were collected by trypsinization and washed twice in phosphate-buffered saline. Cell pellets were extracted by incubation with 100 μl of lysis buffer (50 mm HEPES, 5 mm CHAPS, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.035% SDS, pH 7.5) for 1 h on ice. Samples were then centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 10 min, and supernatants were isolated. Protein (40 μg) was added to 90 μl of lysis buffer, plates were warmed for 10 min at 37 °C, and 10 μl of the succinyl-Leu-Leu-Val-Tyr-AMC substrate (BACHEM, King of Prussia, PA) was added to a final concentration of 150 μm. The resultant fluorescence of the liberated 7-amido-4-methylcoumarin (AMC) dye was then measured on a Cytofluor® multiwell plate reader series 4000 (Applied Biosystems, Framingham, MA) set at an excitation wavelength of 380 nm and emission of 460 nm.Mechanistic Analyses of the Inhibitory Effect of Tiron on Bortezomib—Proteasome-enriched fractions were prepared by affinity purification using the human proteasome isolation kit from Calbiochem (EMD Biosciences, San Diego, CA). Essentially, 107 cells were lysed in Buffer A (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 5 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, and 2 mm ATP). 500 μg (at a concentration of 1 mg/ml) were incubated at 4 °C (2 h) with 100 μl of GST-control agarose beads or with beads conjugated to GST fused to the ubiquitin-like domain of HHR23-B (UbLHRB), which has a high affinity for the proteasome (29Hiyama H. Yokoi M. Masutani C. Sugasawa K. Maekawa T. Tanaka K. Hoeijmakers J.H. Hanaoka F. J. Biol.

Samples were centrifuged for 1 min at 14,000 rpm. The supernatant (herein referred to as GST-eluate) was stored to determine the remaining activity in proteasome-depleted fractions. The affinity matrix was washed twice in Buffer A and finally resuspended in 100 μl of reaction buffer (25 mm HEPES, 500 μm EDTA, pH 7.6). Increasing volumes of the GST-control or GST-UbLHRB (and of the eluates) were incubated with 10 μm succinyl-Leu-Leu-Val-Tyr-AMC in a final volume of 100 μl. The intrinsic chymotryptic activity of the corresponding fractions was estimated by fluorimetry as indicated above. To determine the mode of action of Tiron (i.e. to differentiate between competitive and noncompetitive inhibition), the intensity of AMC fluorescence at each concentration of bortezomib (Fi) was used to estimate the percentage inhibition of the proteasome (40 μg of protein) as follows: % inhibition = 100 × (1 - Fi/Fmax), where Fmax represents the maximum emission intensity in the absence of bortezomib. Data were represented as a function of the concentration of bortezomib, for increasing concentrations of Tiron (0-1 mm). Curves were fitted to a competitive model involving one binding site using GraphPad Prism software. Alternatively, Imax (maximum inhibition by bortezomib) and Ki(app) values were estimated graphically by double reciprocal plots according to Lineweaver-Burk. Experiments were performed in triplicate.Cell Cycle Analyses—2 × 105 normal melanocytes were treated with vehicle control (0.05% Me2SO), bortezomib (50 nm), Tiron (1 mm), or the combination of bortezomib plus Tiron (50 nm and 1 mm, respectively). 24 h post-treatment, cell cycle analyses were conducted after a 2-h incubation of cells in labeling solution (50 μg/ml propidium iodide (Sigma), in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.2% Triton and 10 μg/ml RNase A). Propidium iodide fluorescence was measured using a FACSCalibur flow cytometer. Cell cycle distribution was determined with Cell Quest software (BD Biosciences).Artificial Human Skin—Human skin equivalents were generated as previously reported (32Meier F. Nesbit M. Hsu M.Y. Martin B. Van Belle P. Elder D.E. Schaumburg-Lever G. Garbe C. Walz T.M. Donatien P. Crombleholme T.M. Herlyn M. Am. J. Pathol. 2000; 156: 193-200Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar) by reconstituting epidermal and dermal equivalent using freshly isolated preparations of human melanocytes, keratinocytes, and fibroblasts. Transformed fibroblasts were generated by retrovirus-mediated transduction of the oncogene H-RasV12 and the adenoviral protein E1A essentially as previously described (33Soengas M.S. Alarcon R.M. Yoshida H. Giaccia A.J. Hakem R. Mak T.W. Lowe S.W. Science. 1999; 284: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (594) Google Scholar). For the generation of dermal equivalents, an acellular layer of 1.35 mg/ml type I collagen (Collaborative Biomedical, Bedford, MA), in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum was deposited onto tissue culture inserts (Transwell, Costar, Cambridge, MA) in 6-well plates. This layer was subsequently covered with 3 ml of fibroblast mix (containing normal and transformed fibroblasts at a ratio of 10:1) in collagen (1.125 × 105/ml) and left submerged for 5 days in 10% Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. Neonatal foreskin keratinocytes and melanocytes were subsequently seeded onto the concave center of the dermal reconstructs at a ratio of 1:15 (with a total of 1.5 × 105 cells/reconstruct). Cell stratification was achieved as previously described. After 10-14 days of air exposure, skin reconstructs were processed for treatment and analysis of cell death. In brief, skin reconstructs were treated for 48 h with 50 nm bortezomib in the presence or absence of 1 mm Tiron. Tissue specimens were harvested and processed for standard cryosection and visualization of the skin architecture by hematoxylin and eosin. Cell death in tissue sections was determined with an APO-BrdU TUNEL assay kit (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR).RESULTSInduction of ROS by Bortezomib in Melanoma Cells—We have previously determined that nanomolar concentrations of bortezomib (10-100 nm) can efficiently kill metastatic melanoma cells while maintaining the viability of normal melanocytes (11Fernandez Y. Verhaegen M. Miller T.P. Rush J.L. Steiner P. Opipari Jr., A.W. Lowe S.W. Soengas M.S. Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 6294-6304Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Under those conditions, melanoma cell death is preceded by the induction of the proapoptotic protein NOXA (Fig. 1A) and the subsequent release of apoptogenic factors from the mitochondria (Fig. 1B). To determine the extent of ROS production and its contribution to the cytotoxic effect of bortezomib, cells were treated with a 50 nm dose of this compound, and changes in the fluorescence of the redox-dependent dye 2′,7′-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (34Vermes I. Haanen C. Reutelingsperger C. J. Immunol. Methods. 2000; 243: 167-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (619) Google Scholar) were determined as a function of time. Metastatic melanoma cells SK-Mel-19 and SK-Mel-103 were selected as representative examples of DNA damage-sensitive and -resistant cases, respectively, but both responded to bortezomib (11Fernandez Y. Verhaegen M. Miller T.P. Rush J.L. Steiner P. Opipari Jr., A.W. Lowe S.W. Soengas M.S. Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 6294-6304Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Fresh preparations of human skin melanocytes were also included as a reference for normal cells.Consistent with their resistance to proteasome inhibition, normal melanocytes showed no induction of DCF-dependent fluorescence by bortezomib even 48 h after treatment (Fig. 1C). Melanoma cells were also relatively refractory to bortezomib-mediated ROS release (particularly SK-Mel-19; see Fig. 1C). No significant DCF fluorescence was detected prior to 6 h (i.e. preceding the accumulation of NOXA). In these tumor cells, ROS production was visualized 12-18 h post-bortezomib treatment (Fig. 1C). In contrast, the benzodiazepine Bz-423, a potent inhibitor of the mitochondrial F1F0-ATPase and thus a promoter of O2·¯ production (27Blatt N.B. Bednarski J.J. Warner R.E. Leonetti F. Johnson K.M. Boitano A. Yung R. Richardson B.C. Johnson K.J. Ellman J.A. Opipari Jr., A.W. Glick G.D. J. Clin. Invest. 2002; 110: 1123-1132Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 35Boitano A. Ellman J.A. Glick G.D. Opipari Jr., A.W. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 6870-6876PubMed Google Scholar), was in fact able to completely shift the fluorescence of 2′,7′-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate in melanoma cells (see inset in Fig. 1C). Therefore, although melanoma cells have the capacity of responding to potent ROS inducers, they maintain low levels of ROS in response to bortezomib until late times after treatment.To confirm the maintenance of the mitochondrial physiology at early time points after bortezomib treatment, the mitochondrial membrane potential (Δψm) was analyzed at different intervals after drug addition. Reduction in the intensity of fluorescence of the potentiometric cationic dye DiOC6(3) was used as a surrogate for the dissipation of Δψm (34Vermes I. Haanen C. Reutelingsperger C. J. Immunol. Methods. 2000; 243: 167-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (619) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1D, melanocytes were remarkably effective at maintaining Δψm. In melanoma cells, there was membrane depolarization, but it occurred 12-18 h after treatment. Compare, f"

It causes skin and soft tissue infections, occasionally resulting in life-threatening conditions such as sepsis and necrotizing fasciitis. We recently identified FOG, a novel surface protein of GGS with fibrinogen binding and immune evasion properties. Here we investigated the role of FOG in streptococcal primary adhesion to host tissue. A FOG-expressing clinical isolate adhered more efficiently to human skin biopsies ex vivo and to the murine dermis in vivo than a FOG-deficient strain. Scanning and transmission electron microscopy of skin specimens exhibited that this property was assigned to the ability of FOG to interact with collagen I, a major interstitial component of the dermis. Overlay experiments with human skin extracts and radiolabeled FOG followed by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time of flight mass spectrometry analysis identified both the α1- and α2-chains of collagen I as targets for FOG. Transmission electron microscopy of the molecular complexes revealed thread-like FOG molecules binding via their NH2 termini to distinct sites on collagen I monomers and fibrils. The results demonstrate that FOG is important for GGS adhesion in vivo, implying a pathogenic role for this surface protein.

Deep soft tissue infections may result in life-threatening conditions such as sepsis and necrotizing fasciitis (for references see Ref. 1Oster H. Bisno A.L. Fischetti V.A. Novick R.P. Ferretti J.J. Portnoy D.A. Rood J.I. Gram-Positive Pathogens. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D.C.2000: 184-190Google Scholar). Although certain cases of rheumatic fever have been linked to pharyngeal carriage of GGS (2Haidan A. Talay S.R. Rohde M. Sriprakash K.S. Currie B.J. Chhatwal G.S. Lancet. 2000; 356: 1167-1169Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), primary infections of the skin with these pathogens were often found to precede serious invasive conditions and bacteremia (3Auckenthaler R. Hermans P.E. Washington II, J.A. Rev. Infect. Dis. 1983; 5: 196-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Thus, the skin is to be considered an important site of entry. The clinical relevance of skin infections caused by GGS is underlined by epidemiological reports indicating that GGS are at least as frequent as group A streptococci (GAS) in such diseases (4Nohlgard C. Bjorklind A. Hammar H. Acta Derm. Venerol. 1992; 72: 128-130PubMed Google Scholar, 5Sylvetsky N. Raveh D. Schlesinger Y. Rudensky B. Yinnon A.M. Am. J.

Primary adhesion to the host tissue is a crucial initial step in bacterial infection. The firm interaction enables the bacteria to persist at the site of infection and subsequently colonize specific locations in the tissue. Certain streptococcal surface components with the potential to adhere to host tissues have been identified previously (for references see Refs. 6Cunningham M.W. Clin. Microbiol. Rev. 2000; 13: 470-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (1769) Google Scholar and 7Courtney H.S. Hasty D.L. Dale J.B. Ann. Med. 2002; 34: 77-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). For GAS a mechanism has been postulated in which lipoteichoic acid acts in concert with bacterial surface proteins to facilitate adhesion to host cells (8Beachey E.H. Ofek I. J. Exp. Med. 1976; 143: 759-771Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 9Courtney H.S. von Hunolstein C. Dale J.B. Bronze M.S. Beachey E.H. Hasty D.L. Microb.

Frequently fibronectin has a key function by bridging bacterial adhesins and eukaryotic integrins (11Molinari G. Talay S.R. Valentin-Weigand P. Rohde M. Chhatwal G.S. Infect. Immun. 1997; 65: 1357-1363Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Jadoun J. Ozeri V. Burstein E. Skutelsky E. Hanski E. Sela S. J. Infect.

Cleary P.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 2858-2863Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Interestingly, some of the M proteins, which are important multifunctional virulence factors of GAS, meet the criteria of adhesins (for references see Refs. 6Cunningham M.W. Clin. Microbiol. Rev. 2000; 13: 470-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (1769) Google Scholar and 7Courtney H.S. Hasty D.L. Dale J.B. Ann. Med. 2002; 34: 77-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). As an example, M1 protein involves both fibronectin and laminin in adhesion to human lung epithelial cells (16Cue D. Dombek P.E. Lam H. Cleary P.P. Infect. Immun. 1998; 66: 4593-4601Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A recent study indicates that the majority of GAS strains use the adhesin SfbI to recruit collagen types I and IV via surface-bound fibronectin (17Dinkla K. Rohde M. Jansen W.T. Carapetis J.R. Chhatwal G.S. Talay S.R. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 47: 861-869Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Alternative mechanisms for collagen binding, such as a direct interaction with an M protein of the M3 serotype or binding via a capsule of hyaluronic acid, as seen for an M18 strain, have been published recently (18Dinkla K. Rohde M. Jansen W.T. Kaplan E.L. Chhatwal G.S. Talay S.R. J. Clin. Invest. 2003; 111: 1905-1912Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Staphylococcus aureus has recently been reported to express the adhesin CNA to directly bind collagen in a mouse model of septic arthritis (19Xu Y. Rivas J.M. Brown E.L. Liang X. Höök M. J. Infect. Dis. 2004; 15: 2323-2333Crossref Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Despite the clinical and epidemiological importance and the occasionally dramatic pathogenesis of skin infections with GGS, molecular mechanisms for colonization of human skin by these pathogens are still elusive. A fibronectin-binding protein of GGS, GfbA, has been described earlier as a mediator of adhesion to human fibroblasts. The encoding gene was detected in 36% of tested strains, suggesting that there might be other tissue-specific adhesins expressed by these pathogenic streptococci (20Kline J.B. Xu S. Bisno A.L. Collins C.M. Infect. Immun. 1996; 64: 2122-2129Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The recently discovered GGS surface protein FOG has been shown to share sequence homology and structural similarity with M-like proteins of other streptococci. Using primers from the signal sequence and the cell wall anchoring domain of FOG, a PCR product corresponding to the 1.8-kilobase pair FOG gene was generated in 97% of examined clinical isolates of GGS (21Johansson H.M. Mörgelin M. Frick I.-M. Microbiology. 2004; 150: 4211-4221Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). In the present study, we provide evidence that GGS adhere to collagen I fibrils of the dermis in vivo employing protein FOG as an adhesin. Binding sites essential for this interaction were identified in the NH2-terminal part of FOG and on two distinct positions on the collagen I triple helix. Taken together, the data demonstrate that this surface protein is an important virulence determinant with the potential to trigger streptococcal pathogenesis in vivo. Bacterial Strains—Human clinical isolates of GGS were collected at the Department of Clinical Microbiology of Lund University Hospital (Lund, Sweden). Strains G10, G11, G14, and G19 were joint isolates, G30 and G35 were isolated from wounds, and G41 and G148 were throat specimens. The bacteria were cultured in Todd-Hewitt broth (Difco) at 37 °C and 5% CO2. Strain G148 lacks the fog gene (21Johansson H.M. Mörgelin M. Frick I.-M. Microbiology. 2004; 150: 4211-4221Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) and served as a negative control. Recombinant Proteins—Purification of the FOG variants was performed as described (21Johansson H.M. Mörgelin M. Frick I.-M. Microbiology. 2004; 150: 4211-4221Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). FOG 1-C (amino acid residues 1-493) lacks the COOH-terminal D-domain including the bacterial cell wall anchoring LPXTG motif, and FOG 1-B covers the NH2-terminal 278 residues (see Fig. 3E). The recombinant proteins carry an NH2-terminal GST tag used for protein isolation. Radiolabeling and Bacterial Binding Assay—Collagen I from calf skin (Vitrogen Inc.) and FOG 1-C were radiolabeled with 125I using IODO-BEADS (Pierce). The labeling reactions were carried out on ice for collagen I and at room temperature for protein FOG using 20 μg of protein in 30 mm phosphate (KH2PO4/Na2HPO4), 120 mm NaCl, pH 7.4 (PBS), and 5 min of initial incubation. Unbound iodine was removed on a PD10 column (Amersham Biosciences). 125I-Labeled proteins were bound to streptococcal cells as described earlier (22Björck L. Kronvall G. J. Immunol. 1984; 133: 969-974PubMed Google Scholar). All of the reactions were performed on ice. For competition assays, the concentration of bacteria was first optimized to 3 × 108 bacteria/ml, and subsequently, using a fixed amount of 125I-Labeled collagen I, increasing amounts of binding competitors were added. CDC (14 kDa), the IgG-binding part of streptococcal protein G, was purchased from Amersham Biosciences, and BSA (66 kDa) was from Sigma. Full-length FOG without GST tag was used. The procedure was as described (22Björck L. Kronvall G. J. Immunol. 1984; 133: 969-974PubMed Google Scholar) and performed on ice. Human Skin Samples—Punch biopsies (4-mm diameter) of human skin were obtained in connection with skin transplant surgery. Informed consent was obtained from the patients. The Ethics Committee at Lund University approved the use of this material (permit numbers LU 509-01 and LU 708-01). Ligand Blot and Slot Blot—Human skin components were extracted by boiling in 20% SDS for 20 min. Solubilized proteins were separated by reducing SDS-PAGE on a 3-12% gradient gel in the presence of 5% β-mercaptoethanol and stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue or electroblotted onto a PVDF membrane (Immobilon; Millipore). The membrane was washed twice for 30 min in blocking buffer (PBS containing 0.25% Tween 20 and 2% bovine serum albumin), incubated with 125I-FOG 1-C overnight at 4 °C, and washed three times for 20 min in blocking buffer. Signals of bound ligand were detected using the Fuji Imaging System. The bands corresponding to the signals on the blot were excised from the Coomassie-stained gel and prepared for mass spectrometry. Collagen I denatured with guanidine hydrochloride and nondenatured collagen I were applied directly onto a PVDF membrane using the Milliblot-D system (Millipore). The membranes were blocked, washed, and incubated with radiolabeled probe as described above. Mass Spectrometry—Excised gel bands were washed in water and destained with 40% acetonitrile in 25 mm NH4HCO3, pH 7.8 (Buffer A). The gel pieces were vacuum-dried and rehydrated in 10-20 μl of 10 mm dithiothreitol (55 °C, 30 min). Excess liquid was removed and the reduced proteins were alkylated using 10-20 μl of 55 mm iodoacetamide (20 °C, 30 min). The samples were then washed with buffer A and vacuum-dried. Rehydration and overnight incubation at 37 °C with 10-20 μl of buffer A containing sequencing grade trypsin (25 ng/ml; Promega) ensued digestion into peptides, which were extracted in 10 μl of 2% trifluoroacetic acid and purified using C18 Ziptips (Millipore). Precrystallized 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid was provided on an Anchorchip target (Bruker Daltonik GmbH). The purified peptides were eluted onto this matrix using 50% acetonitrile, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid and allowed to co-crystallize. Spectrometry was carried out on a Bruker Reflex III matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometer operated at an acceleration voltage of 26 kV in the positive ion/delayed extraction mode and detection in the reflector mode. Autolysis fragments of trypsin were used for external calibration of the spectra that were summed of 75-100 single-shot measurements each. The proteins were identified using the Web tool ProFound (23Zhang W. Chait B.T. Anal. Chem. 2000; 72: 2482-2489Crossref PubMed Scopus (552) Google Scholar). The settings accounted for a complete alkylation of the cysteine residues, partial oxidation of methionine, and hydroxylation of lysine and proline. Missed cuts were excluded. Other parameters were used in their default settings. Surface Plasmon Resonance Measurements—Interactions were studied in the BIAcore 2000 system (BIAcore AB) using 10 mm HEPES, 100 mm NaCl, pH 7.4, as running buffer. A CM5 sensor chip was activated by a 4-min injection of 0.05 m N-hydroxysuccinimid, 0.2 m N-ethyl-N-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-carbodiimide hydrochloride in water. Collagen I from calf skin (Roche Applied Science) was diluted in 15 mm NaAc, pH 5.3, to a final concentration of 15 μg/ml. Injection of 5 μlata flow rate of 5 μl/min lead to immobilization of 400 response units of collagen I. Residual reactive groups were inactivated by 6-min injection of 1 m ethanolamine, 0.1 m NaHCO3, 0.5 m NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, pH 8.0. Interaction measurements with FOG, FOG 1-C, FOG 1-B, and GST, respectively, were performed at a flow rate of 50 μl/min. No mass transfer effects were detected. Surface regeneration was achieved by injection of a 30-s pulse of 0.2% SDS in water. The data were analyzed using the BIAevaluation 3.0 software and shown curves represent the difference between the signal of the collagen-coupled surface and a deactivated control surface devoid of protein. They were further corrected by subtraction of the curve obtained after injection of buffer alone. Bacterial Binding to Human Skin Sections—Skin biopsies were fixed in PBS containing 4% formaldehyde (18 h, 4 °C) and processed for paraffin sectioning. Deparaffinized and rehydrated 5 μm sections were incubated with bacterial suspensions (2 × 109 cfu/ml) in PBST (PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20) for 1 min, 15 min, 30 min, 1 h, or 2 h at room temperature. Prior to experimental colonization conditions, 1 h of primary adhesion was carried out. After removing nonbound bacteria with PBST, a drop of Todd-Hewitt broth medium was placed on the sections, and the slides were incubated at 37 °C, 5% CO2 for 5 h to allow bacterial multiplication. In both types of experiments nonbound bacteria were finally removed by extensive washing with PBST. The samples were fixed in PBS containing 4% formaldehyde and prepared for light microscopy. The samples for scanning electron microscopy were fixed and processed as described below. Bacterial Colonization of Human Skin Biopsies—Skin biopsies were incubated with bacteria (2 × 109 cfu/ml) in PBST for 1 h at room temperature. After removal of nonbound bacteria by washing three times with PBST, the infected skin was cultivated for 24 h in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) at 37 °C, 5% CO2. The samples were washed three times in PBS, and specimens were either fixed in PBS containing 4% formaldehyde prior to light microscopy or prepared for scanning electron microscopy as described below. Primary Adhesion to the Collagen Matrix of Human Fibroblasts—Bacteria were grown in Todd-Hewitt broth to early stationary growth phase, washed three times with PBS, and resuspended in PBS to 2 × 109 cfu/ml. Human foreskin fibroblasts were cultured in 24-well tissue culture plates (Nunc) in minimum essential medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μm streptomycin, and 0.1 mm l-glutamine. Specimens for scanning electron microscopy were cultured under identical conditions on coverslips placed at the bottom of the wells. All of the reagents were from Invitrogen. When cells approached confluence, a daily dose of ascorbic acid (25 μg/ml) was added for 3 days to stimulate the expression of collagen networks. Cell monolayers were washed with PBS and incubated with streptoccci (6 × 108 cfu/well) for 1 h at 37°C, 5% CO2, and nonbound bacteria were removed with PBS. Analysis of adherent bacteria was performed either by determining cfu as described (24Frick I.M. Mörgelin M. Björck L. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 37: 1232-1247Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), or by scanning electron microscopy. Primary Adhesion to the Murine Dermis in Vivo—Female Balb/c mice of 6-8 weeks were anesthetized with isoflurane. Groups of three mice each received a subcutaneous dorsal injection of 6 × 108 cfu G41 or G148. The area of injection was marked with a pencil for later identification. After 30 min the animals were sacrificed, and the marked area was excised. For determination of adherent bacteria skin pieces were washed with PBS and homogenized in a volume of 400 μl of PBS using a Multi-Gen 7 homogenizer (Pro Scientific Inc. Monroe, CT). The samples were vortexed, diluted, and plated in duplicate on blood agar plates. The plates were incubated overnight at 37 °C, and the number of cfu was counted. For determination of contaminating normal flora one mouse was injected with PBS alone and treated as above. In parallel, skin samples were prepared for examination by scanning electron microscopy. The animal experiments were approved by the regional ethical committee for animal experimentation (permit M294-03). Light Microscopy—For light microscopy of colonized skin biopsies, 5-μm paraffin sections were stained with Mayers Hematoxylin (Histolab AB) and Eosin Y (Surgipath Inc.). Alternatively, using the affinity of protein G to goat IgG, the bacteria were detected with the Vectastain ABC Elite kit (Vector Laboratories Inc.) and subsequent staining with a DAB kit (Vector Laboratories Inc.), following the manufacturer's instructions. The samples were examined in a Carl Zeiss Axioplan 2 imaging e microscope. Digital images were acquired using a Carl Zeiss AxioCam HR camera and the software Axiovison 3.1 (Zeiss). Scanning Electron Microscopy—Deparaffinized skin sections on glass slides were incubated with bacteria as described above. The whole slide was fixed in 4% formaldehyde, 2.5% glutaraldehyde in PBS, for 2 h at 4 °C. Fixed specimens were dehydrated for 10 min at each step of an ascending ethanol series and critical point dried in a Balzers critical point dryer in liquid carbon dioxide using absolute ethanol as intermediate solvent. The glass slides were cut into appropriate pieces with a diamond knife, mounted on aluminum stubs, and coated with a 30-nm-thick layer of gold. They were examined in a Jeol J-330 scanning electron microscope at an acceleration voltage of 5 kV and a working distance of 10 mm. Transmission Electron Microscopy—Skin biopsies incubated with bacteria (see above) were fixed, embedded, and sectioned with a diamond knife as previously described (21Johansson H.M. Mörgelin M. Frick I.-M. Microbiology. 2004; 150: 4211-4221Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The structure of FOG constructs and complexes thereof with collagen I was analyzed by mica sandwich squeezing/rotary shadowing (25Mould P. Holmes D. Kadler K. Chapman J. J. Ultrastr. Res. 1985; 91: 66-7625Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Complexes between FOG, labeled with colloidal gold (26Baschong W. Wrigley N.G. J. Electron. Microsc. Tech. 1990; 14: 313-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar), and reconstituted collagen I fibrils were visualized by negative staining as described (27Roth J. Bendayan M. Orci L. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1980; 26: 1074-1081Crossref Scopus (677) Google Scholar). To prepare collagen I fibrils an acidic solution of collagen I from fetal calf skin (3 mg/ml; Roche Applied Science) was neutralized with PBS to a final concentration of 25 μg/ml. Reconstitution of fibrils was carried out for 24 h at 37 °C. Sample concentrations were usually in the range of 10-20 μg/ml in 50 mm Tris-HCl, 0.15 m NaCl, pH 7.4 (TBS). Collagen I fibrils and gold-labeled FOG were incubated in TBS buffer for 30 min at 4 °C. Specimens were observed in a Jeol JEM 1230 electron microscope operated at 60 kV accelerating voltage. The images were recorded with a Gatan Multiscan 791 CCD camera. GGS Expressing FOG Adhere to Human Dermis ex Vivo—The FOG-expressing GGS strain G41 was compared with the FOG-deficient strain G148 (21Johansson H.M. Mörgelin M. Frick I.-M. Microbiology. 2004; 150: 4211-4221Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) for the ability to adhere to and subsequently colonize human dermis ex vivo (Fig. 1). Bacteria were allowed to adhere to thin sections of human skin biopsies on glass slides. For subsequent colonization the adhered bacteria were multiplied by incubation on the slides with culture medium. As shown by light microscopy, G41 colonies adhered to the fibrous matrix of the dermis, whereas binding of G148 was considerably less pronounced (Fig. 1A). This was confirmed by scanning electron microscopy of infected skin sections at higher resolution (Fig. 1B). Large numbers of colonies of G41 bound to fibrillar structures in the dermis (arrowheads). In contrast, only a few colonies of G148 could be detected. Fresh human skin biopsies were also infected with G41 or G148, followed by cultivation to simulate colonization of the tissue. With light microscopy the formation of large colonies in the dermis was obvious (arrowheads), where colonization by strain G41 was much more pronounced as compared with G148 (Fig. 1C). Scanning electron microscopy (Fig. 1D) demonstrated a frequent intimate association of G41 colonies with fibrillar networks (inset), which was observed to a much lesser extent for G148. FOG Binds to Collagen I α1- and α2-Chains of Skin Extracts—To identify skin components serving as substrates for FOG, we set up ligand blot experiments (Fig. 2A). The FOG 1-C fragment lacking the COOH-terminal membrane anchor domain (Fig. 3E) was used to minimize potential self-aggregation by hydrophobic interactions. Human skin biopsies were extracted with SDS, separated by SDS-PAGE using bovine collagen I as a standard, and transferred to a PVDF membrane. Interestingly, radiolabeled FOG 1-C bound only to a few discrete bands of the skin extract with apparent molecular masses of 129, 141, and 207 kDa, respectively (Fig. 2A, BLOT). In the control lane FOG 1-C interacted with the α1- and α2-chains as well as β- and γ-fragments and slower migrating fragments of bovine collagen I. Comparison with the Coo-massie-stained gel showed that the bands exhibited a similar migration pattern as the α1- and α2-chains and the β-fragment of bovine collagen I (Fig. 2A, STAIN). Corresponding bands on the Coomassie-stained gel were excised, digested with trypsin, and analyzed by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. The obtained peptide fingerprints identified all bands as collagen I (Table 1). The data evaluation took into account the hydroxylation of proline and lysine residues characteristic for collagens. This led to uncertainties in the exact peptide assignment of the two homologue collagen I α-chains. However, the combination of the MALDI-TOF fingerprint data and the migration pattern in SDS-PAGE (Fig. 2; for identification of the bands see Ref. 22Björck L. Kronvall G. J. Immunol. 1984; 133: 969-974PubMed Google Scholar) led to the assignment presented in Table 1, concluding that both collagen I α-chains are targets for FOG.TABLE 1Analysis of peptide mass fingerprintsBandRankEstimated ZDescriptionAssignmentaBased on comparison with purified collagen I from calf skin in SDS-PAGE111.78collagen Iα1-chain20.69collagen Icollagen Iα2-chainα2-chain212.11collagen Icollagen Iα1-chainα1-chain311.94collagen Iα1-chain20.45collagen Icollagen Iα2-chainβ-fragmenta Based on comparison with purified collagen I from calf skin in SDS-PAGE Open table in a new tab To test the influence of collagen denaturation occurring in SDS-PAGE on the FOG-collagen interaction, the binding of FOG 1-C to nondenatured and to guanidine hydrochloride-denatured bovine collagen I was examined in a slot blot experiment. Radiolabeled FOG 1-C bound to both collagen preparations in a similar concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 2B). FOG Binds to the Collagen I Triple Helix in Surface Plasmon Resonance Experiments—GST-tagged recombinant full-length FOG, as well as the shorter variants FOG 1-C and FOG 1-B, were tested for binding to immobilized collagen I. All of the fragments exhibited a dose-dependent binding to collagen I (Fig. 3, A-C), whereas the GST tag alone did not bind (Fig. 3D). Binding curve fits based on the 1:1 model of Langmuir revealed apparent dissociation constants of 8 × 10-11 m for FOG, 4 × 10-10 m for FOG 1-C, and 3 × 10-10 m for FOG 1-B, respectively. Binding of the FOG 1-B fragment localized the site of collagen binding to the NH2-terminal half of FOG (Fig. 3E). Structural Characterization of FOG—Visualization of GST-tagged recombinant full-length FOG and its truncated variants FOG 1-C and FOG 1-B by mica sandwich squeezing/rotary shadowing and transmission electron microscopy revealed thread-like particles with a globular terminal domain (Fig. 3F). The major portion of the globular domain is formed by the NH2-terminal GST tag as demonstrated by electron microscopy of recombinant GST alone. The thread-like structures are formed by FOG (55 ± 5 nm), FOG 1-C (41 ± 5 nm), and FOG 1-B (22 ± 3 nm), respectively. Their length correlates well with the number of amino acids (Fig. 3E), resulting in averages of 1.0 ± 0.1, 0.8 ± 0.1, and 0.8 ± 0.1 Å for the axial distances between vicinal amino acids, respectively. In summary the different recombinant proteins consist of an NH2-terminal globular GST tag and a protruding thread-like structure formed by the FOG moiety that is more tightly packed than expected for an ideal α-helix (1.5 Å axial distance). Like the closely related M-proteins, the thread-like FOG moieties might represent coiled-coil dimers. FOG Binds to Distinct Sites on the Collagen I Triple Helix—The interaction between FOG and collagen I was visualized by transmission electron microscopy after mica sandwich squeezing/rotary shadowing (Fig. 4A). Large fields of FOG molecules in association with the 300-nm-long collagen I molecules became apparent. The contact between FOG and collagen I occurred at the very NH2-terminal portion of FOG, which is marked by the globular GST tag. Consistent with the surface plasmon resonance measurements, an interaction between GST alone and collagen I was not observed (data not shown). Therefore we concluded that the site of interaction resided in the NH2-terminal of the FOG moiety, without any contribution by the GST tag. On the collagen I triple helix two distinct binding sites for FOG were found (Fig. 4B). Because pepsin-extracted collagen I was used we could not distinguish between NH2- and COOH-terminal. However, collagen molecules were found with both binding sites occupied by FOG (Fig. 4B, bottom panels). They allowed defining the relative position of the two binding positions, which are located on one tip and at 235-nm distance on the 300-nm-long triple helix (Fig. 4C). Additional binding sites were not observed. The truncated recombinant variants FOG 1-C and FOG 1-B exhibited the same interactions with collagen I (data not shown). FOG Binds to Distinct Sites on Collagen I Fibrils—For a more detailed understanding of GGS adhesion to dermis collagen networks in situ, complexes between FOG and reconstituted collagen I fibrils were visualized by electron microscopy after negative staining with uranyl formate (Fig. 5).

Echoviruses are small (∼300 Å in diameter) non-enveloped icosahedral viruses classified in the Enterovirus genus of the Picornaviridae family. Echovirus infection is usually mild, although these viruses can cause severe diseases such as aseptic meningitis, encephalitis, and myocarditis. The ∼7.5-kb positive sense RNA genome encodes a single polyprotein that is co- and post-translationally cleaved, yielding the structural proteins, enzymes, and additional proteins necessary for virus replication. Picornavirus capsids assemble from four structural proteins (VP1-4) as a pseudo T = 3 icosahedral shell with VP1-3 occupying the three quasi-equivalent positions in the icosahedral lattice and VP4 lying beneath the pentameric apex (1Hogle J.M. Chow M. Filman D.J. Science. 1985; 229: 1358-1365Crossref PubMed Scopus (878) Google Scholar). Enteroviruses have a distinctive morphology (common to many picornaviruses) consisting of a star-shaped mesa at the 5-fold symmetry axes surrounded by a deep cleft or “canyon” (2Stuart A.D.

The major receptor group rhinoviruses along with coxsackievirus type A21 use ICAM-1 (intracellular adhesion molecule 1), whereas the polioviruses bind to a protein of unknown function called the poliovirus receptor, and coxsackievirus type B3 binds to the coxsackie-adenovirus receptor. These receptors, which belong to the immunoglobulin-like family of proteins, bind to the capsid surface in the canyon (4He Y.N. Chipman P.R. Howitt J. Bator C.M. Whitt M.A. Baker T.S. Kuhn R.J.

Receptor binding in solution induces conformational changes in the capsid akin to those that occur at the cell surface, resulting in loss of VP4, while the normally buried hydrophobic N terminus of VP1 is externalized (9Hoover-Litty H. Greve J.M. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 390-397Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10Fenwick M.L. Cooper P.D. Virology. 1962; 18: 212-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 11Fricks C.E. Hogle J.M. J.

It is hypothesized that this forms a pore in the cell membrane through which the genome passes to enter the cytoplasm. Recent studies of poliovirus virions bound to poliovirus receptor molecules embedded in lipid vesicles indicate that this pore may form at the 5-fold symmetry axis, although it is not clear whether a specific vertex is required to facilitate genome egress (13Bubeck D. Filman D.J. Hogle J.M. Nat. Struct. Mol.

EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5070-5074Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). DAF is a 70-kDa protein comprising four short consensus repeat (SCR) domains linked by an O-glycosylated serine-, threonine-, and proline-rich linker to a glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchor at the cell membrane. DAF is present on the surface of the majority of serum-exposed cells, where it protects them from complement-mediated lysis by accelerating the decay of the classical and alternative pathway C3 and C5 convertases (19Lublin D.M. Atkinson J.P. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1989; 7: 35-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). Unlike the Ig-like receptors, DAF does not induce uncoating in solution, although conformational changes in the virion do occur at the cell surface. This suggests that another molecule is recruited to induce uncoating or, alternatively, that DAF must be presented in the context of a cell membrane (20Powell R.M. Ward T. Evans D.J. Almond J.W. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 9306-9312Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).We have previously calculated a quasi-atomic resolution model of the echovirus (EV) type 12·receptor complex based on cryo-negative stain transmission electron microscopy and image reconstruction of EV12 bound to a fragment of DAF comprising SCR3 and SCR4 (DAF34) (EM Data Bank code 1057 and Protein Data Bank code 1UPN) (21Bhella D.

This model shows that EV12-DAF binding occurs predominantly between SCR3 and VP2 (residues 142-164). The interaction takes place close to the 2-fold symmetry axes rather than in the canyon, and the receptor fragment lies flat against the capsid surface. Comparison of our structure and model with those published for the EV7·DAF complex indicated major differences between these two closely related viruses (Protein Data Bank code 1M11) (22He Y.N. Lin F. Chipman P.R. Bator C.M. Baker T.S. Shoham M. Kuhn R.J. Medof M.E. Rossmann M.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 10325-10329Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Previous genetic and biochemical studies of DAF-binding enteroviruses have shown that they can be divided into two major classes: those that bind to SCR1 and those that bind to SCR3 with additional binding to SCR4 and sometimes SCR2 (15Karnauchow T.M. Tolson D.L. Harrison B.A. Altman E. Lublin D.M. Dimock K. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 5143-5152Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Powell R.M. Ward T. Goodfellow I. Almond J.W. Evans D.J. J. Gen.

Although EV7 and EV12 both bind primarily to SCR3, there is considerable variation in receptor affinity in this class of viruses, and mutagenesis data suggest that individual virus serotypes may interact with different faces of the receptor (23Williams P.

To test our earlier structural hypotheses and to cast further light on the nature of receptor binding in the echoviruses, we have calculated a three-dimensional reconstruction of EV12 bound to a four-domain receptor fragment (DAF1234) and dissected virus-receptor interactions using a variety of receptor fragments and surface plasmon resonance (SPR).EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESProduction of Virus and Receptor—EV12 was cultivated in rhabdomyosarcoma cells and purified as described previously (21Bhella D.

Soluble DAF comprising SCR1-4 for electron microscopy (EM) analysis was expressed and purified in Pichia pastoris as described previously (20Powell R.M. Ward T. Evans D.J. Almond J.W. J.

Virol. 1998; 79: 1707-1713Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar).For Biacore analysis, DAF3, DAF23, and DAF34 were subcloned from the DAF1234 expression vector into the pQE-30 plasmid (Qiagen Inc). All constructs were expressed as hexahistidine fusions in M15[pREP4] (Qiagen Inc.). These constructs, along with DAF1234, were purified from inclusion bodies and refolded using established SCR refolding protocols (25White J. Lukacik P. Esser D. Steward M. Giddings N. Bright J.R. Fritchley S.J. Morgan B.P. Lea S.M. Smith G.P. Smith R.A. Protein Sci. 2004; 13: 2406-2415Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar).Electron Microscopy—Preparations of EV12 were labeled with DAF by incubation overnight at 4 °C and prepared for microscopy by cryo-negative staining. 5 μl of virus at an concentration of ∼0.2 mg/ml was loaded onto a freshly glow-discharged QUANTIFOIL holey carbon support film (Quantifoil Micro Tools GmbH, Jena, Germany) for ∼10 s. The grid was then transferred to a droplet of 20% (w/v) ammonium molybdate solution (pH 7.4) for ∼10 s, blotted for 2-3 s, and plunged into a bath of liquid nitrogen-cooled ethane slush. Grids were stored under liquid nitrogen or imaged directly in the transmission electron microscope.Prepared specimens were imaged in a Jeol 1200 EX II transmission electron microscope equipped with an Oxford Instruments CT3500 cryo-stage (Gatan, Inc., Oxford, UK) at an accelerating voltage of 120 kV. To facilitate correction of the microscope’s contrast transfer function, each field of view was imaged at two levels of defocus. Typically, the first micrograph was recorded between 500 and 1500 nm under focus and the second between 1500 and 2500 nm under focus. Defocus paired images were recorded under low electron dose conditions at a nominal magnification of ×30,000 on Kodak SO163 film.Image Processing—Micrographs were digitized on a Nikon Super Coolscan 9000 ED CCD scanner at 4000-dpi resolution, corresponding to a raster step size of 2.18 Å in the specimen. Micrographs were converted to PIF format with the BSOFT image processing package (26Heymann J.B. J. Struct. Biol. 2001; 133: 156-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Particles were selected and cut out in X3D, and deconvolution of the contrast transfer function was performed using CTFMIX; at this point, defocus paired images of individual particles were merged (27Conway J.F. Steven A.C. J. Struct. Biol. 1999; 128: 106-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). The orientations and origins of particle images were determined by a modified version of the polar Fourier transform method (PFT2) (28Bubeck D. Filman D.J. Cheng N. Steven A.C. Hogle J.M. Belnap D.M. J. Virol. 2005; 79: 7745-7755Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 29Baker T.S. Cheng R.H. J. Struct.

Successive iterations of polar Fourier transform refinement and three-dimensional reconstruction (EM3DR2) led to the calculation of final reconstructions for EV12·DAF1234 and EV12 at 14-Å resolution. Resolution assessment was accomplished by randomly dividing the data set into equal subsets, which were used to generate two independent reconstructions. A number of measures of agreement between these reconstructions were calculated, including the Fourier shell correlation and the spectral signal-to-noise ratio. Reconstructions were visualized in UCSF Chimera using the EMAN radial depth cueing plug-in Isosurface Colorizer (30Pettersen E.F. Goddard T.D. Huang C.C. Couch G.S. Greenblatt D.M. Meng E.C.

The reconstructed density for EV12·DAF1234 was converted to CCP4 format and placed at the origin of a unit cell in space group P23 with a cubic cell edge of 555.9 Å such that the icosahedral 2- and 3-fold symmetry axes coincided with the crystallographic symmetry axes. A pentameric asymmetric unit of the EV11 crystal structure was placed within the unit cell in the same orientation, confirming the hand assignment and scale of the EM density. The main chain atom correlation coefficient for the virus capsid was calculated as 55% between experimental and model densities.A hybrid DAF structure was calculated to create an optimal fit for each SCR domain in the experimentally derived receptor density as follows. SCR3 and SCR4 were constrained to the previously determined positions. As no further points of contact were found between the virus and receptor, we assumed that the presence of SCR1 and SCR2 would not alter the fundamental interaction. Furthermore, merged densities from SCR2 and SCR3 in symmetry-related molecules across the 2-fold axes precluded further refinement of the previous fit. For SCR3 and SCR4, a real space correlation coefficient of 55.4% was calculated using a 14-Å tagged density map with B-factors set to 100.To achieve an optimal fit for SCR2, 14 different models of DAF1234 (based on the seven different crystal structures deposited in the Protein Data Bank) were fitted to the existing model as well as 43 models derived from NMR data (32Lukacik P. Roversi P. White J. Esser D. Smith G.P. Billington J. Williams P.A. Rudd P.M. Wormald M.R. Harvey D.J. Crispin M.D. Radcliffe C.M. Dwek R.A. Evans D.J. Morgan B.P. Smith R.A. Lea S.M. Proc. Natl.

The real space main chain correlation coefficient for SCR2 was used as a scoring function to determine the best interdomain orientation. Fitting of SCR1 was accomplished in the same manner once a satisfactory fit for SCR2 was attained using crystallographic data only, as no NMR data exist for the SCR1-SCR2 linker region. Molecular models were visualized using PyMOL (DeLano Scientific, San Carlos, CA), MolScript (36Kraulis P.J. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1991; 24: 946-950Crossref Google Scholar), and Raster3D (37Merritt E.A. Bacon D.J. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 277: 505-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (3869) Google Scholar).SPR Studies—All SPR measurements were performed on a Biacore 2000 instrument (Biacore AB, Uppsala, Sweden) using HBS-EP (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, containing 150 mm NaCl, 3 mm EDTA and 0.005% (v/v) surfactant P20) as the running buffer. EV12, EV7, and EV6 were covalently coupled to the surface of a CM-5 sensor chip (Biacore AB) by primary amine coupling. After the activation step, 5-10 μl of virus (diluted to 50 μg/ml in 10 mm sodium formate (pH 3.0)) was injected repeatedly over a single flow channel until the signal was 3000-6000 response units above the (uncoupled) base line. It has been previously shown that low pH does not significantly alter the infectivity of the viruses studied (38Lea S.M. Powell R.M. McKee T. Evans D.J. Brown D. Stuart D.I. van der Merwe P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30443-30447Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). To prevent further coupling reactions, unreacted succinimide esters on the chip surface were displaced by saturating the surface with 40 μl of 1 m ethanolamine (pH 8.5). The immobilization procedure was repeated for two different viruses on each of the other two channels. To provide a mock-coupled (no virus) control channel, the fourth channel was inactivated immediately after the activation step.Experimental runs were based on previous protocols for SPR studies of EV11-207 (38Lea S.M. Powell R.M. McKee T. Evans D.J. Brown D. Stuart D.I. van der Merwe P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30443-30447Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). After coupling the virus to the chip, the system was primed several times to ensure a stable base-line response before the experiment began. To avoid mass transfer effects, all experiments were performed at a high flow rate (25-30 μl/min) using HBS-EP as the running buffer.Binding of recombinant DAF1234 was measured by sequentially injecting 30 μl of a 3/2-fold dilution series in HBS-EP from 8.25 μm (high to low concentration) and also from 30 μm. The injection was performed using the KINJECT command, with a dissociation time of 1000-1400 s, followed by two 20-μl 4 m NaCl wash steps. The experiment was then repeated using the same dilution series except from low to high concentration. This was to confirm that the equilibrium signal for a given ligand concentration did not change with time.Binding of recombinant DAF3, DAF34, and DAF23 was measured by sequentially injecting a 2/3-fold dilution series from 25 μm and from 100 μm (high to low concentration and then low to high concentration). Otherwise, the protocol was identical to the one used for DAF1234.To analyze the equilibrium constant for the dissociation (KD) of the ligand virus, the corresponding FC4 mock response signal was aligned and subtracted from each measurement using BIAevaluation (Biacore AB). The average equilibrium response (Req) was determined for each ligand concentration (C) and plotted on a graph of Req (response units) versus C (molar). A nonlinear fit of the 1:1 Langmuir binding model to the data yielded an estimate for the equilibrium dissociation constant (KD).RESULTSThree-dimensional Reconstruction of EV12 Bound to DAF1234—42 defocus paired micrographs of unlabeled EV12 and 96 paired micrographs of DAF1234-labeled EV12 were selected for image processing on the basis of ice thickness, virion numbers, defocus, and astigmatism. 1796 unlabeled and 1742 labeled particle image pairs were selected and corrected for the effects of the microscope’s contrast transfer function. Several rounds of iterative orientation refinement and three-dimensional reconstruction were performed until stable orientations and origins were achieved for each data set. In total, 1501 images of unlabeled and 1339 images of labeled virions were used to calculate final reconstructions (Fig. 1). The resolution assessment for these reconstructions gave values of 14 and 16 Å, respectively (Electron Microscopy Data Bank accession numbers 1182 and 1183).We have previously calculated a structure for EV12 bound to a two-domain fragment of DAF (DAF34) (21Bhella D. Goodfellow I.G. Roversi P. Pettigrew D. Chaudhry Y. Evans D.J. Lea S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 8325-8332Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). This structure has clear regions of contiguous density, and two domains could be readily defined (Fig. 1B). The rod-shaped fragment was found to bind to the capsid surface close to the 2-fold symmetry axes, oriented such that it lay approximately equidistant between the 3- and 5-fold axes, pointing to two neighboring 2-fold symmetry axes. When viewed along the 2-fold axes, two DAF34 molecules appear as hands on a clock in a “ten past eight” orientation. The crystallographic structure was readily docked into the reconstruction, unambiguously identifying the domain lying closest to the 2-fold axes and in contact with the capsid surface as SCR3. Our structure for EV12·DAF1234 (Fig. 1C) is consistent with our previous reconstruction and model, containing density that overlaps with that previously found in the EV12·DAF34 structure. Further density is present lying across the 2-fold symmetry axes, extending out of SCR3, in a “six o’clock” orientation. This density bends sharply away from the capsid surface, close to the 3-fold axis. As this globular region (which appears to consist of two distinct lobes) is farthest from SCR3 and SCR4 and is consistent with our previous quasi-atomic resolution model for EV12·DAF1234, we attribute it to SCR1. We consider that the larger region of density lying across the 2-fold axis most likely comprises SCR2 and the SCR2-proximal region of SCR3 from two symmetry-related molecules. SCR1 and SCR2 do not make additional contacts with the capsid surface; therefore, our previous description of contact residues involved in this interaction remains valid and unchanged.Construction of a Quasi-atomic Model for EV12·DAF1234, Fitting SCR2—Starting from our previous model for EV12·DAF34, a hybrid EV12·DAF1234 structure was constructed by successively fitting SCR2 and SCR1 into the reconstructed density for the virus·receptor complex (Fig. 2) (Protein Data Bank code 2C8I). SCR3 and SCR4 were constrained to their positions in our previous model, as we consider this fit to be robust, and there is no evidence at this resolution for a change in the orientation of the molecule. SCR3 from each of 14 different crystallographic (Fig. 2A) and 43 different NMR (Fig. 2B) models was overlaid on the capsid-docked SCR3, and the SCR2 fit was scored according to correlation with the EM density. Of the crystallographic models, chain B from Protein Data Bank deposition 1OK3 was found to have the SCR2-SCR3 interdomain angle giving the highest correlation with the EM density (55%) (Fig. 2C) (32Lukacik P. Roversi P. White J. Esser D. Smith G.P. Billington J. Williams P.A. Rudd P.M. Wormald M.R. Harvey D.J. Crispin M.D. Radcliffe C.M. Dwek R.A. Evans D.J. Morgan B.P. Smith R.A. Lea S.M. Proc. Natl.

Barlow P.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 4718-4723Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) exhibit a large spread of interdomain angles that fan out parallel to the capsid surface. Only three chains showed any significant correlation with the EM density, and none of these models were compatible with the overall packing seen for all four domains in our reconstruction.FIGURE 2Calculation of a quasi-atomic model for EV12·DAF.

D, points of contact on DAF1234 with the symmetry partner across the 2-fold axis. The green surface represents a steric clash between Arg102 and Arg103 and identical residues of the symmetry partner. This is resolved by side chain rearrangement. The blue surface is a van der Waals contact between Pro137 and Pro109 of the symmetry partner. The red and orange surfaces are an overlap between the main chain atoms of residues 174-180 of SCR3 (red) and a surface composed of residues 95-98 and 75-77 of the symmetry partner SCR2 (orange). This clash can be resolved only by a remodeling of loop 174-180. E, electron density of SCR1. The strong density at the center of each lobe is shown as a red mesh, whereas the lower contours are shown as a blue mesh. The major and minor lobes, as well as the position of SCR2, are highlighted.

Most eukaryotic mRNAs are translated by a ribosome-scanning mechanism. The 40 S ribosomal subunit, with associated initiation factors, binds in the vicinity of the 5′ m7G-cap structure and proceeds in the 3′ direction until it encounters an initiation codon in a favorable context, and protein translation is initiated (11Kozak M. Mamm. Genome. 2002; 13: 401-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 12Kozak M. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 229-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (2810) Google Scholar, 13Kozak M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Several alternative, less commonly used mechanisms of translation initiation have also been identified, including ribosome reinitiation, shunting, and internal ribosome binding. Translational initiation by internal ribosome entry involves the binding of the 40 S ribosomal subunit to an internal ribosome entry site (IRES) 3The abbreviations used are: IRESinternal ribosome entry siteCATchloramphenicol acetyltransferaseUTRuntranslated regionORFopen reading frameuORFupstream ORFssDNAsingle-stranded DNAuAUGupstream AUGFLFirefly luciferaseRLRenilla luciferaseEMCVencephalomyocarditis virus. at or near the authentic AUG. The IRES elements were first discovered in picornavirus mRNAs, where they serve to initiate translation of uncapped mRNAs (17Jackson R.J.

Later, IRESs were also identified within the 5′-end of cellular mRNAs including transcripts that mediate internal initiation during the inhibition of cap-dependent translation in mitosis and apoptosis, like fgf-2, pdgf-2, igf-II, vegf, odc, c-myc, xiap, apaf-1, and bip (reviewed by Stonely and Willis (19Stoneley M.

Presently, the concept of IRES-mediated translation initiation in eukaryotes is a topic of controversial discussion (21Kozak M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 1899-1907Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 22Van Eden M.E. Byrd M.P. Sherrill K.W. Lloyd R.E. RNA (N.

The gold standard for the detection of IRES activity is the dicistronic assay. In this assay, the IRES is placed between two cistrons (chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT), Renilla/firefly luciferase, or other reporter genes) in a dicistronic vector and then transiently transfected into eukaryotic cells. Translation of the upstream ORF occurs via CAP-dependent scanning, whereas translation of the downstream cistron depends on the activity of the IRES. Low efficiency of translation and a lack of proper controls (e.g. Northern blotting) to exclude alternative splicing or the presence of a transcriptional promoter within the putative IRES may lead to a misinterpretation of the IRES activity for a given test sequence. The 5′-UTR of myeov possesses several features that superficially resemble mRNAs that purportedly translate via internal ribosome entry. Its 5′-UTR has a length of 445 nucleotides, contains several upstream AUGs (uAUGs) that may generate four different polypeptides with a length of 22, 59, 11, and 7 amino acids, and is predicted to fold in a complex secondary structure (ΔG =–153.1 kcal/mol). In this paper, we describe the analysis of the 5′-UTR of the myeov gene. Initial data suggesting IRES activity were challenged by the application of in vitro translation and RNA transfection studies. In addition, Northern blot analysis revealed the presence of a cryptic promoter. Finally, we were able to show that the presence of the uAUG codons almost completely abrogates protein translation. The myeov gene thus fits the paradigm wherein an encumbered 5′-UTR is used to limit translation of a potent protein that is likely to be harmful if overproduced (23Kozak M. Gene (Amst.). 2003; 318: 1-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Establishment of the Mono- and Dicistronic Construct—The luciferase plasmids: pGL3, phpL, pRF, phpRF, and pRF+EMCV have been described previously and were kindly provided by Dr. A. Willis (24Stoneley M. Subkhankulova T. Le Quesne J.P. Coldwell M.J. Jopling C.L. Belsham G.J. Willis A.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 687-694Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Pfu DNA polymerase (Promega) was used to amplify the complete myeov 5′-UTR using a cloned cDNA 11SMNp14m81 encoding for the large ORF and the following oligonucleotide primers: myeovEcoRIUTRfor, 5′-CGGAATTCGAACCCACATCCCTACAAAGCAG-3′; myeov14-NcoIUTRrev, 5′-CATGCCATGGGCCGAGGGAAGGAGCCAG-3′ (cloning sites are underlined). A nucleotides were added by the addition of dATPs (Amersham Biosciences) and TaqDNA polymerase and incubation at 72 °C for 30 min. The fragment was purified after gel electrophoresis using a gel extraction kit QIAEX II (Qiagen) and inserted into a T-vector, pGEM®-T Easy plasmid (Promega) originating pGEM-T+myeov 5′-UTR. The identity of the insert was verified by DNA sequencing using M13 forward and reverse primers. The fragment was digested by EcoRI and NcoI and cloned into pGL3, phpL, pRF, and phpRF between the EcoRI and NcoI sites, thus creating pGL3 + 5′-UTR, phpL+5′-UTR, pRF+5′-UTR, and phpRF+5′-UTR. Again, correct insertion was verified by the dideoxy terminator cycle sequencing method using a CycleReader™ auto-DNA sequencing kit (MBI Fermentas) and a specifically labeled firefly luciferase reverse primer, 5′-CTTCTGCCAACCGAACGGAC-3′ on a Li-Cor 4200 DNA Analyzer (Li-Cor). Construction of the bicistronic promoterless constructs were performed by deleting the SV40 promoter sequence, including the intron between the SmaI and EcoRV sites from pRF, pRF+5′-UTR, and pRF+EMCV by restriction digestion, agarose gel electrophoresis, purification by QIAEXII (Qiagen), and religation and thus creating pRF(-P), pRF(-P)+5′-UTR, and pRF(-P)+EMCV, respectively. Construction of Normal and 5′-UTR Mutated myeov cDNA Fragments into the Eukaryotic Expression Vector pMTSM—To analyze the effect of uORFs in the myeov 5′-UTR on protein translation, Pfu DNA polymerase (Promega) was used to amplify the complete myeov 5′-UTR using a cloned cDNA 11SMNp14m81 encoding for the large ORF and the following oligonucleotides: myeovUTRHindIIIfor (5′-CAGCCCAAGCTTCGGACCGCGAACCCACATC) and myeovUTREcoRVrev (5′-GGTTCCGATATCGAGCCGAGGGAAGGAGCC-3′). Fragments were treated with Taq polymerase and dATPs to add A nucleotides, resolved by gel electrophoresis, purified with QIAEX II (Qiagen), and cloned into pGEM®-T Easy vector, originating the construct pGEM-T+myeov 5′-UTRHindIII/EcoRV. Inserts were verified by DNA sequencing. Single and combinations of mutations within the upstream AUGs of the myeov 5′-UTR were introduced using pGEM-T+myeov 5′-UTRHindIII/EcoRV as a template and the QuikChange® Multi site-directed mutagenesis kit as recommended by the manufacturer (Stratagene). The following oligonucleotides were used: myeovATG1 (5′-CAAAGCAGGAAAGTAAGCTTGGGAGAGGCC-3′, myeovATG2 (5′-CAGAGGGCGGGAGAAGCCATCCCCACTG-3′, myeovATG3 (5′-GGGCCGGGGCGTGCAAGGCCTCAGGG-3′), and myeovATG4 (5′-GGCCTCAGGGAAGGCCTGTTCAGCTGC-3′) (mutated AUGs are underlined). Introduced mutations were verified by DNA sequencing, and the inserts, myeov 5′-UTRmut, were recloned into pRF+EMCV upstream of the Renilla luciferase cistron between the HindIII and EcoRV restriction sites. Correct insertion was verified by DNA sequencing using a specific labeled Renilla luciferase reverse primer, 5′-ACACCGCGCTACTGGCTC-3′. To create constructs of myeov cDNA fragments in the eukaryotic expression vector pMT2SM, several amplifications were performed. The open reading frame without 5′- and 3′-UTR sequences and the ATG in an optimal Kozak context (pMT2SM+ORF(K)) was amplified using primers myeov-Kpn-Kozak-long 14 (5′-GGGGTACCGCCACCATGGCCCTCAGAATCTGCG-3′) (start codon is in bold) and myeov-Xba-end (5′-GCTCTAGATCAACAAGTGAGGATGATGATG-3′). The open reading frame without 5′- and 3′-UTR sequences and its own ATG (pMT2SM+ORF) was amplified using primers myeovKpn-own-long 14 (5′-GGGGTACCTTCCCTCGGCTCATGGCC) and myeov-Xba-end. Amplifications, cloning, and verification were as described above. Fragments were cloned into pMT2SM using KpnI and XbaI. Complete myeov cDNAs encoding the respective large (11SMNp14m82) and short ORF (11SMNp2m69) were digested with NotI from the λgt10 cloning vector and ligated into NotI-digested pMT2SM. In addition, the following ligations were performed. The plasmid pMT2SM+5′-UTRmut+ORF+3′UTR was created by a double ligation. For that, the myeov 5′-UTR containing the four mutations in the uORF was obtained from pGEM-T+UTR1,2,3,4mut and digested with NotI and PflfI. The main ORF together with the 3′-UTR of myeov was excised from the plasmid 11SMNp14m82 containing a complete myeov cDNA encoding the largest ORF using the same restriction enzymes, polished with Pfu DNA polymerase, and blunt end-ligated into the polished NotI site of pMT2SM. To generate a construct that lacks the 3′-UTR (pMT2SM+5′-UTR+ORF), the plasmid 11SMNp14m82 was digested with AatII, polished, and subsequently digested with the restriction enzyme NotI. The fragment was applied to agarose gel electrophoresis, purified by QIAEX II (Qiagen), and ligated into the vector pMT2SM that was digested with EcoRI, polished, and subsequently digested with NotI. To construct the plasmid lacking the 5′-UTR (pMT2SM+ORF+3′-UTR), the plasmid 11SMNp14m82 was digested with PflFI, polished, and then digested with the restriction enzyme NotI. The fragment was purified by gel electrophoresis and QIAEX II and ligated into pMT2SM, which was digested with PstI, polished, and digested with NotI. In Vitro RNA Synthesis and in Vitro Translation—pRF, pRF+5′-UTR, and pRF+EMCV luciferase fusion constructs were column-purified (Qiagen) and directly used to prime coupled in vitro transcription/translation reactions (TNT) according to the manufacturer's instructions (Promega). 5 μl were withdrawn from this reaction in 10-min intervals and combined with an equal volume of 2× passive lysis buffer (Promega), and Renilla and Firefly luciferase activity were determined as described below. RNA Transfection and Quantitation of Translation Efficiency—For in vitro transcription experiments using T3 polymerase, we used a Bluescript-based plasmid (Stratagene) containing the SHOX 5′-UTR upstream of the Firefly luciferase cistron with the SV40 poly(A) adenylation site and SV40 enhancer (25Blaschke R.J. Topfer C. Marchini A. Steinbeisser H. Janssen J.W. Rappold G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 47820-47826Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). In this case, the SHOX 5′-UTR was replaced by either the wild type or the mutated myeov 5′-UTR using the SpeI/NcoI restriction sites, originating pBSK+UTR and pBSK+UTRmut, respectively. Prior to in vitro transcription, both constructs were linearized with the restriction enzyme XhoI. Synthetic mRNA was generated using the mMESSAGE mMachine™ T3 reaction system (Ambion) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. The quality and the size of the mRNAs were analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis, and 2 μg of RNA were directly transfected into HEK 293 cells using 8 μl of TransMessenger™ Transfection Reagent (Qiagen)/well of a 6-well plate according to the manufacturer's protocol. Twenty-four hours after transfection, transfected cells were trypsinized and washed once with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and the cell pellet was resuspended in 1000 μl of PBS. 200 μl were pelleted and resuspended into 100 μl of 1× passive lysis buffer (Promega) and directly used for luciferase assays or first stored at –70 °C. The remaining 800 μl were pelleted and used for poly(A)+ RNA isolation using the GenElute™ direct mRNA miniprep kit of Sigma according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Cell Culture and DNA Transfection—HEK-293 cells were grown at 37 °C in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/Ham's F-12 medium (1:1) (PAA Laboratories) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (PAA Laboratories) in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2. One day before transfection, 3 × 106 cells were seeded into 10-cm dishes. Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/Ham's F-12 medium was replaced with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with supplements, and DNAs were transfected by the calcium phosphate method (26Chen C. Okayama H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2745-2752Crossref PubMed Scopus (4821) Google Scholar). Two days after transfection, cells were washed twice in PBS++, and one-tenth of the cells were lysed with 1× passive lysis buffer (Promega) and used for luciferase assays, one-tenth were used for Western blot analysis, and the remaining cells were used for RNA isolation. When transfections were performed with Gene Juice (Novagen), 100,000 cells/well were seeded into a 24-well plate 1 day before transfection. The next day, 400 ng of DNA and 0.8 μl of Gene Juice reagent were used for transfection according to the manufacturer's instructions. Luciferase Assay—For luciferase measurement, HEK-293 cells were lysed 24–48 h after transfection with 1× passive lysis buffer (Promega) for 15 min at room temperature. 20 μl of each cell lysate were measured for Firefly and Renilla luciferase activities using the dual luciferase reporter system (Promega) and a dual injector 96-well plate luminometer (Anthos) as recommended by the manufacturer. All assays were performed at least three times and in triplicate. Northern Blot Analysis—Total cellular RNA and poly(A)+ were isolated with the High Pure RNA isolation kit (Roche Applied Science) and the GenElute™ Direct mRNA miniprep kit (Sigma) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Northern blot analysis and stripping were performed as described by Janssen et al. (27Janssen J.W. Schleithoff L. Bartram C.R. Schulz A.S. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 1767-1772Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Briefly, 10 μg of total RNA or 2 μg of poly(A)+ RNA were loaded onto a denaturing formaldehyde-agarose gel, electrophoresed in the presence of formaldehyde, and transferred to Nytran 13N nylon membranes (Schleicher & Schuell). Filters were hybridized in 3× SSC (0.45 m NaCl, 0.045 m sodium citrate), 5× Denhardt's solution, 200 μg/ml denatured salmon sperm DNA, 1% SDS, and 10% dextran sulfate at 63 °C for 16 h with random primed labeled probes (MBI Fermentas). Filters were extensively washed in 3× SSC, 0.1% SDS at 63 °C, followed by a wash at higher stringency. Filters were exposed to Eastman Kodak Co. Biomax MS film with a Kodak intensifier screen. The following probes were used for hybridization analysis. 1) Firefly luciferase probe was generated by PCR using the following primers: Lucy1for (5′-GGAGAGCAACTGCATAAGGC-3′) and Lucy1rev (5′-CATCGACTGAAATCCCTGGT-3′). 2) Renilla luciferase-specific probe was generated by PCR using the following primers: Ren for (5′-ATGTTGTGCCACATATTGAGCCAGT-3′) and Ren rev (5′-GATTTCACGAGGCCATGATAATGT-3′). S1 Nuclease Analysis—S1 analysis was performed using a fluorescently labeled ssDNA probe according to the protocol of Noti and Reinemann with some modifications (28Noti J.D. Reinemann B.C. BioTechniques. 1996; 20: 174-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). The regions spanning the 5′-UTR of the myeov and IRES of the EMCV gene were first amplified by PCR using 25 ng of double-stranded DNA of the pGL3-P + myeov 5′-UTR and pGL3-P + EMCV plasmids with 50 pmol of primers in a standard 100-μl reaction during 40 cycles, respectively. For myeov, we used the following primers, pGL3RVprimer 3 as a forward primer (5′-ctagcaaaataggctgtccccagtg-3′) and a fluorescently labeled MyeovPromPErev2 primer (5′-DY-681-ggccctgcaggtgtgacgg-3′). For EMCV, we used the identical forward primer and a fluorescently labeled EMCVrev2 primer (5′-DY681-gttccgctgcctgcaaagg-3′). Approximately 100 ng of double-stranded template and 20 pmol of labeled primer were then subjected to 30 cycles of asymmetric PCR in a standard 100-μl reaction volume. The labeled single-stranded PCR product (along with the double-stranded template) was electrophoresed in one lane of a 2% low melting point minigel. The ssDNA, which runs at approximately one-half the molecular weight of the double-stranded template, was visualized on a UV transilluminator, excised from the gel, and trimmed of excess agarose with a scalpel. The agarose was melted at 65 °C and an equal volume of 10T0.1E buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0) was added. RNA was isolated from HEK 293 cells that had been transfected using Gene Juice (Novagen) and the plasmids pGL3-P + myeov 5′-UTR and pGL3-P + EMCV. Poly(A)+ RNA was isolated using the Gene Elute Direct mRNA MiniPrep Kit (Sigma) according to the manufacturer's instructions. For S1 analysis, 2 μg of poly(A)+ RNA were ethanol-precipitated and resuspended in diethylpyrocarbonate-treated H2O, dried, and redissolved in 20 μl of S1 hybridization buffer (80% deionized formamide, 0.4 m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 50 mm PIPES, pH 6.4). Approximately 3 μl of preheated (65 °C) of single-stranded probe DNA was added, heated at 80 °C for 5 min, and hybridized overnight at 30 °C. After hybridization, 119 μl of diethylpyrocarbonate-treated H2O, 15 μl of 10× S1 buffer (300 mm sodium acetate (pH 4.6), 10 mm zinc acetate, 50% glycerol), 15 μl of 3 m NaCl, and 1 μl of S1 nuclease (25 units) (Invitrogen) were added and incubated for 60 min at 25 °C. The reaction was stopped with the addition of 10 μl of 0.5 m EDTA, 40 μlof 7.5 m ammonium acetate, 5 μg of yeast tRNA, and 1 ml of ethanol. Following ethanol precipitation, the pellet was resuspended in 2 μl of diethylpyrocarbonate-treated H2O, and 1 μl of sequence loading buffer was added and analyzed on a Li-Cor 4200 DNA analyzer (Li-Cor) together with a sequence reaction of the plasmid DNAs, obtained with the same primer used to prepare the single-stranded probes. Immunoblotting and Antibodies—Proteins were resolved by 10% SDS-PAGE and blotted onto nitrocellulose (PROTRAN; Schleicher & Schuell) by standard procedures. Filters were blocked with TBST (10 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20) plus 10% Carnation for 1 h at room temperature. MYEOV antibodies were added at 1 μg/ml in 10 ml of TBST plus 10% Carnation and incubated overnight at 4 °C. Following incubation with horseradish peroxidase-labeled goat anti-rabbit antibodies (1:10,000), filters were developed with ECL reagent (Amersham Biosciences). MYEOV polyclonal antibodies were obtained by immunizing rabbits with a MYEOV-specific peptide corresponding to amino acids 103–116 (NH2-CAGDRERNKGDKGAQ) and affinity-purified on a peptide column containing immobilized MYEOV-specific peptide (FZB Biotechnik GmbH, Berlin). Structural Features and Predicted Secondary Structure of the myeov 5′-UTR—The myeov 5′-UTR has a length of 445 nucleotides and contains four AUG codons (uAUGs) upstream of the main ORF. These AUGs are associated with ORFs of 22, 59, 11, and 7 amino acids, respectively. Considering the importance of nucleotides at position –3 (A/G) and +4 (G) in the Kozak consensus sequence for optimal translation (A/G)CC(A/G)CCAUGG) (29Kozak M. Mamm. Genome. 1996; 7: 563-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (757) Google Scholar), the first three AUGs show only one of the two optimal features, whereas the fourth AUG shows both features, albeit followed by a stop codon (Fig. 1). Structure prediction algorithms using the mfold 3.1 algorithm (30Mathews D.H. Sabina J. Zuker M. Turner D.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 288: 911-940Crossref PubMed Scopus (3220) Google Scholar, 31Zuker M. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 3406-3415Crossref PubMed Scopus (10305) Google Scholar) predicts a strong secondary structure of this 5′-UTR with a Gibbs free energy of ΔG =–153.1 kcal/mol for the most stable configuration. The presence of uAUGs and stable secondary structure should cause ribosome scanning to be inefficient. This suggests that myeov mRNA translation might be regulated by a cap-independent mechanism (e.g. internal ribosome entry). Effect of the myeov 5′-UTR on Translation of Downstream Open Reading Frames—In order to evaluate its effect on translation, we cloned the myeov 5′-UTR upstream of a Firefly luciferase (FL) reporter gene into the monocistronic plasmid pGL3 using the myeov AUG (pGL3+UTR) (Fig. 2). Human embryo kidney 293 cells were transfected with pGL3 and pGL3+UTR, and the FL activity from each construct was determined (Fig. 2). The FL levels were corrected for transfection efficiency using Northern blot analysis and PhosphorImager quantitation. The presence of the myeov 5′-UTR upstream of the FL reporter gene reduced its activity by ∼98%, indicating that this sequence modulates gene expression (Fig. 2). In addition, we wanted to determine whether MYEOV protein synthesis can proceed in a cap-independent manner (i.e. by IRES). For this reason, an inverted repeat sequence forming a very stable hairpin structure (–55 kcal/mol) was placed downstream of the SV40 promoter, creating phpL and phpL+UTR (Fig. 2). As a consequence, ribosome scanning from the 5′ CAP site is severely impaired, whereas ribosomes entering distal of the hairpin will be unaffected. HEK-293 cells transfected with this construct almost completely abolished (∼98%) cap-dependent translation (Fig. 2). However, introduction of the myeov 5′-UTR sequence between the hairpin and the reporter gene stimulated luciferase activity ∼6-fold above that observed with phpL (Fig. 2). These data suggest that the myeov 5′-UTR can direct translation in a cap-independent manner. A similar effect has been described for many other genes containing IRES sequences and indicates the presence of an IRES within this leader sequence. Analysis of IRES Activity in the myeov 5′-UTR Using the Bicistronic Vector—To verify whether the myeov 5′-UTR contains an IRES, we inserted it into the bicistronic vector pRF between the Renilla (RL) and FL reporter genes (32Coldwell M.J. Mitchell S.A. Stoneley M. MacFarlane M. Willis A.E. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 899-905Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). This plasmid contains two reporter genes. The first cistron (Renilla luciferase) is under the control of an SV40 promoter and translated via a cap-dependent mechanism, whereas the second cistron (Firefly luciferase) is translated independently of the cap structure (e.g. by internal ribosome entry). The myeov 5′-UTR was cloned upstream of the Firefly luciferase cistron originating pRF+UTR (Fig. 3). These plasmids were transiently transfected into 293 cells, and the activity of both luciferases was determined 48 h after transfection. The activity of the Firefly luciferase (second cistron) was normalized to that of Renilla luciferase (first cistron) to correct variations in transfection efficiency. Fig. 3b shows that the Firefly luciferase is increased 9-fold over background after insertion of the myeov 5′-UTR into the intercistronic position. Different control assays were performed to check whether alternative mechanisms such as enhanced ribosomal reinitiation at the Firefly luciferase initiation codon and/or the generation of Firefly luciferase mRNAs due to alternative splicing or the presence of a cryptic promoter might be responsible for this result. To demonstrate that the observed IRES activity is not due to ribosome reinitiation, we used the phpRF vector. This vector contains an inverted repeat sequence upstream of the RL coding region, which produces a stable hairpin structure in the mRNA (–55 kcal/mol). CAP-dependent translation of the upstream RL cistron should be greatly diminished, whereas cap-independent IRES activity of the downstream FL cistron should not be affected (Fig. 3). As expected, the hairpin structure reduced RL expression in both constructs, phpRF and phpRF+UTR (data not shown). In addition, uncorrected background FL activity was a"

We purified the Rdp3 complex to near homogeneity using the tandem affinity purification method. Mass spectrometric analysis revealed the presence of a novel component, which we named Raf60. We showed that Myc-Raf60 co-fractionated with Rpd3-TAP by gel filtration chromatography, and both Myc-Rpd3 and Sin3 co-immunoprecipitated with HA-Raf60. In addition, HA-Raf60 immunoprecipitates displayed Rpd3-dependent histone deacetylase activity, and raf60 deletion resulted in loss of Rpd3 complex activity, as measured by in vitro assays. Furthermore, we found that raf60Δ cells exhibited phenotypes similar to those of rpd3Δ cells, including derepression of secreted acid phosphatase (Pho5), hypersensitivity to cycloheximide, and hypersensitivity to heat shock. Also, we found by reverse transcription-PCR that raf60Δ cells, similar to rpd3Δ cells, displayed elevated levels of PHO5 and INO1 mRNA. Our results demonstrate that Raf60 is a component of the Rpd3 histone deacetylase complex and that it is required for normal Rpd3 complex activity and repression of gene expression.

Histone acetylation and deacetylation play important roles in the regulation of gene expression and DNA repair in eukaryotic cells (1Iizuka M. Smith M.M. Curr. Opin. Genet.

These reversible processes are catalyzed by histone acetyltransferase (HAT) 3The abbreviations used are: HAThistone acetyltransferaseHDAChistone deacetylaseHAhemagglutininTAPtandem affinity purification. and histone deacetylase (HDAC) complexes (2Roth S.Y.

Dev. 2003; 13: 143-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Modification of histones by these complexes alter chromatin structure and can facilitate interactions of transcription and other factors with chromatin. In general, hyperacetylated histones are preferentially associated with transcriptionally active chromatin, whereas hypoacetylated histones are associated with transcriptionally repressed and silenced genes (4Eberharter A. EMBO Rep. 2002; 3: 224-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (687) Google Scholar). In addition, HAT and HDAC complexes also acetylate and deacetylate transcription factors and other proteins (5Yang X.J. BioEssays. 2004; 26: 1076-1087Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). Considerable evidence suggests that inappropriate acetylation and deacetylation contribute to cancer and other human disease, and recent efforts have focused on examining inhibitors of class I/II HDACs for their potential value in the treatment of these diseases (6Marks P.A.

The high degree of conservation in subunit composition of the yeast Rpd3 and human Class I HDAC complexes suggests that their roles have been conserved throughout evolution.

BY4742 (Matα his3Δ1 leu2Δ0 lys2Δ0 ura3Δ0), BY4728 (Mata his3Δ200 trplΔ63 lys2Δ0 ura3Δ), BY4729 (Matα his3Δ200 trplΔ63 lys2Δ0 ura3Δ), rpd3Δ (BY4742 rpd3::kanMX4), pho23Δ (Mata his3Δ1 leu2Δ0 met15Δ0 ura3Δ0 pho23::kanMX4), and raf60Δ (BY4742 raf60::kanMX4) were obtained from Research Genetics/Invitrogen. The strains AC101 (BY4728 PHO23-TAP::TRP1) and AC102 (BY4729 RPD3-TAP::TRP1) were generated by integrating the TAP fusion cassette in-frame at the 3′ end of the genomic coding sequences of PHO23 and RPD3, respectively, using the PCR-based genomic tagging method described previously (37Rigaut G. Shevchenko A. Rutz B. Wilm M. Mann M. Seraphin B. Nat. Biotechnol. 1999; 17: 1030-1032Crossref PubMed Scopus (2287) Google Scholar). The TAP fusion cassette was amplified from pBS1479 using oligonucleotides with ∼60 bp identity to sequences flanking the integration site. Appropriate genomic integration and protein expression was confirmed by PCR and Western blots, respectively. Plasmids—Procedures for DNA manipulation and analysis were performed using standard protocols (38Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning, A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Plainview, NY1989Google Scholar). pAD4H and pUAD6 contain the 2-μm origin of replication and the ADH1 promoter and encode the HA epitope and Myc epitope, respectively (39Hubberstey A. Yu G. Loewith R. Lakusta C. Young D. J. Cell. Biochem. 1996; 61: 459-466Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). pHA-Rpd3, pHA-Raf60, and pHA-Pho23 were generated by cloning the PCR-amplified open reading frames of RPD3, RAF60, and PHO23 into the SalI/SacI sites of pAD4H. pMyc-Rpd3 and pMyc-Raf60 were generated by cloning the PCR-amplified open reading frames of RPD3 and RAF60 into the SalI sites of pUAD6. Purification of Pho23- and Rpd3-associated Proteins—Pho23 and Rpd3 complexes were purified by the tandem affinity purification method (37Rigaut G. Shevchenko A. Rutz B. Wilm M. Mann M. Seraphin B.

Methods (Orlando). 2001; 24: 218-229Google Scholar), with minor modifications. Whole cell extracts (15–20 mg/ml, ∼30 ml) derived from 3-liter cultures were incubated with 500 μl of IgG-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences) for 2 h at 4°C with rotation. Beads were then recovered in a Bio-spin column (Bio-Rad), washed with 30 ml of cleavage buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol), resuspended in 500 μl of cleavage buffer, and incubated with 100 units of tobacco etch virus protease (Invitrogen) for 2 h at 16°C. The beads were removed, and the supernatant was incubated overnight with 300 μl of calmodulin-agarose beads (Invitrogen), washed with 30 ml of calmodulin binding buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 1 mm magnesium acetate, 1 mm imidazole, 2 mm CaCl2, 10% glycerol), resuspended in 500 μl of calmodulin elution buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 1 mm magnesium acetate, 1 mm imidazole, 20 mm EGTA, 10% glycerol), and incubated for 30–60 min at 4 °C. Eluted protein complexes were concentrated using the Ultrafree Biomax 5 filter device (Millipore) or precipitated with 25% trichloroacetic acid. The proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE, silver-stained, and bands were excised and analyzed by mass spectrometry. Immunoprecipitations and Western Blots—Yeast cells harvested from 100-ml cultures (A600 ∼1.0) were washed once with HDAC extraction buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20, 10% glycerol) and resuspended in 1 ml of extraction buffer containing protease inhibitors (2 μg of leupeptin, 5 μg of aprotinin, 2 μg of pepstatin A, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 μl of yeast protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma)). Cell suspensions were mixed with ∼1.5 g of glass beads (425–600 nm; Sigma) and shaken for 10 cycles (45 s/cycle followed by 45 s of cooling) in a Mini-BeadBeater (Biospec Products) at 4 °C; cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 20,800 × g for 15–20 min at 4 °C. Protein levels were determined using the Bradford assay (Bio-Rad). Samples of cell extract containing 5–10 mg of total protein were precleared by incubating with 50 μl of protein A-Sepharose beads for 30 min at 4 °C. After removal of the beads, the extracts were incubated overnight (∼14 h) at 4 °C with 50 μl of protein A-Sepharose beads cross-linked to anti-HA (12CA5) or anti-Rpd3 antibodies. The beads were collected by centrifugation at 420 × g for 2 min at 4 °C and washed three times with 1 ml of extraction buffer. For Western blot analyses, the beads were resuspended in 20 μl of 4× SDS-polyacrylamide gel sample buffer, boiled, and proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE. Proteins were transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes, blocked with 5% skim milk in TBS (25 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 137 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl), and incubated for 2 h at room temperature or overnight at 4 °C with the appropriate antibody. After 1 h of incubation at room temperature with the appropriate secondary antibodies, the blots were developed using ECL reagents (Amersham Biosciences). Histone Deacetylation Assays—HDAC activities were measured as reported previously (20Loewith R. Smith J.S. Meijer M. Williams T.J. Bachman N. Boeke J.D. Young D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 24068-24074Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Immunoprecipitates were incubated overnight at room temperature with 11 μg of [3H]acetyl-histones from HeLa cells in 200 μl of HDAC buffer. Gel Filtration Chromatography—∼30-ml cell extracts (15–20 mg protein/ml) were loaded onto nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose columns (Invitrogen) as previously described (19Lechner T. Carrozza M.J. Yu Y. Grant P.A. Eberharter A. Vannier D. Brosch G. Stillman D.J. Shore D. Workman J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40961-40966Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The bound proteins were eluted with 5 ml of 300 μm imidazole buffer and concentrated five times by ultracentrifugation using a Centricon Plus-20 filter device (Millipore). Proteins (5 mg/0.5 ml) were fractionated on a Superose 6 10/300 GL gel filtration column using the AKTA fast protein liquid chromatography system (Amersham Biosciences) at a flow rate of 0.25 ml/min. Reverse Transcription-PCR—Total RNA was extracted from 10–20 ml of cells (A600 ∼1.5) grown in high phosphate medium (41To E. Ueda Y. Kakimoto S.I. Oshima Y. J. Bacteriol. 1973; 113: 727-738Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) using the Hot Phenol method (42Schmitt M.E. Brown T.A. Trumpower B.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 3091-3092Crossref PubMed Scopus (1152) Google Scholar). Residual DNA was removed in 20-μl reactions containing 20 μg of total RNA, 20 units of DNase I (Amersham Biosciences), and 30 units of RNAguard (Amersham Biosciences) at 37 °C for 30 min. For reverse transcription, 5 μg of DNase-treated RNA was incubated in 20-μl reactions with 100 pmol of oligo(dT)15 primer (Promega), 200 units of Superscript I RT reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen), 30 units of RNAguard (Amersham Biosciences), 1 mm dNTP mix, and 10 mm dithiothreitol. The reactions were stopped by incubation at 70 °C for 10 min. Regions of ACT1, PHO5, and INO1 cDNAs were amplified using the following primer sets: ACT1, 5′-AGCCCCAGAAGCTTTGTTCC and 5′-GGCAATACCTGGGAACATGG; PHO5, 5′-GGGTCCAGGTTACGACATTA and 5′GATTTCACAAGAACCTGGACC; INO1, 5′-GCTGCTCACCAAGTACAGCTACG and 5′-GCCATTCACCGGGTGAAATCCTGG. Raf60 Is Associated with the Rpd3 HDAC Complex—We previously demonstrated that Pho23 is a stable component of the Rpd3 HDAC complex and that it is required for normal function of this complex (20Loewith R. Smith J.S. Meijer M. Williams T.J. Bachman N. Boeke J.D. Young D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 24068-24074Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). To further characterize the components of the Rpd3 complex, we purified it to near homogeneity by the TAP method (see”Experimental Procedures“). To do this, we first constructed strains in which the TAP tag coding sequence was integrated in-frame at the 3′-ends of the endogenous RPD3 and PHO23 coding sequences. Silver-stained gels of purified Rpd3-TAP and Pho23-TAP revealed the presence of 10–12 stably associated polypeptides ∼30–200 kDa in size (Fig. 1A). Profiles of Pho23-TAP-associated proteins appeared to be similar in number, migration patterns, and stoichiometry to those present in the purified Rpd3-TAP preparation (not shown), indicating that Pho23 is associated exclusively with the Rpd3 complex. Several polypeptides detected in our purified preparations corresponded in size to known members of the Rpd3 complex, including Sin3 (∼175 kDa), Rpd3 (∼50), Pho23 (∼40), Sds3 (∼38), and Sap30 (∼30 kDa) (Fig. 1A). The positions of these proteins in the profile were verified by Western blots (not shown). In addition, several other polypeptides were also detected. Two protein bands, ∼175 (corresponding in size to Sin3) and ∼60 kDa in size, were extracted from the gels, subjected to in-gel tryptic digestion, and analyzed by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry. Peptides (FLDCAVGLR and HEYDFYIESNLR) derived from the 175-kDa band matched sequences from Sin3 as expected, whereas peptides (QLSQIALQR and LIYPEATGISSNR) obtained from the 60-kDa band corresponded to the sequence of a predicted protein encoded by the S. cerevisiae genome, which we have named Raf60 (Fig. 1B). Raf60 is a non-essential 430-amino-acid residue protein that localizes in the nucleus (43Huh W.K. Falvo J.V. Gerke L.C. Carroll A.S. Howson R.W. Weissman J.S. O'Shea E.K.

Nature. 2002; 418: 387-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (3251) Google Scholar); however its molecular functions are still unknown. The middle region (residues 133–228) of Raf60 has some sequence similarity with bromodomains (Fig. 1B), which are preferentially found in HAT-associated proteins and function as acetyl-lysine binding domains (45Dhalluin C. Carlson J.E. Zeng L. He C. Aggarwal A.K. Zhou M.M. Nature. 1999; 399: 491-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (1301) Google Scholar, 46Owen D.J. Ornaghi P. Yang J.C. Lowe N. Evans P.R. Ballario P. Neuhaus D.

In addition, the C-terminal region was predicted to form a coiled-coil domain, which is typically involved in protein-protein interactions (Fig. 1B). To verify that Raf60 is a subunit of the Rpd3 complex, we performed co-immunoprecipitation studies using extracts from wild-type cells co-expressing HA epitope-tagged Raf60 and Myc epitope-tagged Rpd3 (Fig. 2A). Our results showed that Myc-Rpd3 (Fig. 2A, lane 4) and Sin3 (lanes 2 and 4) co-immunoprecipitated with HA-Raf60 but did not immunoprecipitate from control extracts. Further evidence for the physical association of Raf60 and Rpd3 was obtained by gel filtration chromatography. Previous studies have reported the presence of two Rpd3 complexes, a large ∼1.2-MDa complex and a smaller ∼0.6-MDa complex (10Rundlett S.E. Carmen A.A. Kobayashi R. Bavykin S. Turner B.M.

We partially purified HDAC complexes from crude extracts of cells co-expressing Rpd3-TAP and Myc-Raf60 on a nickel-agarose column and subsequently fractionated the bound material by gel filtration chromatography (see”Experimental Procedures“). Most of the endogenously expressed Rpd3-TAP co-fractionated with a ∼1.2-MDa complex (Fig. 2B), consistent with previous reports (17Kasten M.M. Dorland S. Stillman D.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4852-4858Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 19Lechner T. Carrozza M.J. Yu Y. Grant P.A. Eberharter A. Vannier D. Brosch G. Stillman D.J. Shore D. Workman J.L. J. Biol.

In contrast, the Hda1 HDAC eluted in fractions corresponding to ∼0.5 MDa in size, consistent with previous reports (19Lechner T. Carrozza M.J. Yu Y. Grant P.A. Eberharter A. Vannier D. Brosch G.

Chem. 1996; 271: 15837-15844Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Together these results demonstrate that Raf60 stably associates with the Rpd3 HDAC complex. Raf60 Is Associated with Rpd3-dependent HDAC Activity—To further investigate the role of Raf60, we performed HDAC assays on immunoprecipitates of HA-Raf60, HA-Rpd3, and HA-Pho23 from wild-type cells expressing these proteins. We found that immunoprecipitates of all three proteins displayed comparable levels of HDAC activity ∼5-fold higher than the background level of immunoprecipitates from cells expressing the HA epitope alone (Fig. 3A). Furthermore, the HDAC activities associated with these proteins were reduced to background levels in the presence of trichostatin A, an HDAC inhibitor. To determine whether the HDAC activity associated with Raf60 was Rpd3-dependent, we performed similar assays on immunoprecipitates from rpd3Δ cell extracts. As shown, no detectable HDAC activity was associated with HA-Raf60 or HA-Pho23 immunoprecipitates from rpd3Δ cells. Western blot analysis indicated that comparable amounts of HA-tagged proteins were present in the immunoprecipitates from wild-type and rpd3Δ cells (Fig. 3A, top panel). Together, these results demonstrate that Raf60 is associated with an Rpd3-dependent HDAC activity and is not stably associated with other HDAC complexes. Raf60 Is Required for Normal Rpd3 HDAC Activity—To assess the role of Raf60 in the Rpd3 complex, we first examined whether Raf60 is required for Rpd3 HDAC activity. To do this, we performed HDAC assays on immunoprecipitated HA-Rpd3 and HA-Pho23 from raf60Δ cells. Our results show that the HDAC activities associated with HA-Rpd3 or HA-Pho23 from raf60Δ cells were not significantly above background levels, in contrast to the normal levels we observed with corresponding immunoprecipitates from wild-type cells (Fig. 3A). Immunoprecipitates of HA-Raf60 expressed in raf60Δ or wild-type cells exhibited comparable levels of HDAC activity. We also measured the HDAC activities of endogenous Rpd3 immunoprecipitated from cell extracts using an anti-Rpd3 antibody. We found that the level of HDAC activity of anti-Rpd3 immunoprecipitates from wild-type cells was ∼2.6-fold higher than from rpd3Δ cells (Fig. 3B). Furthermore, we found that the HDAC activities of anti-Rpd3 immunoprecipitates from raf60Δ and pho23Δ cells were reduced to background levels similar to that observed from rpd3Δ cells. Together, these observations suggest that Raf60 is required for HDAC activity of the Rpd3 complex in vitro. raf60 Deletion Results in Phenotypes Similar to Those of rpd3 Mutants—Deletion of RPD3 or other components of the Rpd3 complex have been previously shown to result in several phenotypes, including defects in the regulation of gene silencing and expression (including PHO5 and INO1 expression) and hypersensitivity to cycloheximide and heat shock (20Loewith R.

Biol. 1991; 11: 6317-6327Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). To investigate whether Raf60 is required for Rpd3 function in vivo, we examined whether raf60Δ cells exhibit phenotypes similar to those of rpd3Δ cells. Our results show that raf60Δ cells were hypersensitive for growth on medium containing cycloheximide (0.32 μg/ml) or for heat shock treatment (55 °C, 10 min), similar to that observed for rpd3Δ and pho23Δ cells (Fig. 4). We also found that raf60Δ resulted in derepression of secreted acid phosphatase in high phosphate medium, which is indicative of increased PHO5 expression. The level of secreted acid phosphatase activity appeared to be similar to the level of pho23Δ cells but not as much as rpd3Δ cells, suggesting that PHO5 expression is only partially derepressed in raf60Δ cells. Raf60 Is Required for Repression of PHO5 and INO1—We next examined whether deletion of RAF60 had an effect on the level of PHO5 and INO1 mRNA. By performing reverse transcription-PCR, we found that both PHO5 and INO1 mRNA levels were detectable at a fewer number of cycles of amplification using mRNA purified from raf60Δ and rpd3Δ cells compared with wild-type cells (Fig. 5). These results indicate that PHO5 and INO1 mRNA levels were similar in raf60Δ and rpd3Δ cells and were severalfold higher than in wild-type cells, suggesting that Raf60 is required for the proper repression of these genes. Together our results suggest that Raf60 is required for normal functions of the Rpd3 complex in vivo. The Rpd3 HDAC complex plays a key role in the modification of chromatin structure and consequently impinges on mechanisms that regulate gene expression and DNA repair. The identification and characterization of all subunits of the Rpd3 HDAC complex is essential to fully understanding the mechanisms involving this complex. In this study, we report the initial characterization of a novel Rpd3 subunit, Raf60. The co-purification of Raf60 with Rpd3-TAP and Pho23-TAP suggests that Raf60 is a component of the Rpd3 complex. Recent genome-wide proteomic studies have also identified Raf60 and several other proteins in purified Rpd3-TAP and Sin3-TAP preparations (35Gavin A.C. Bosche M. Krause R. Grandi P. Marzioch M. Bauer A. Schultz J. Rick J.M. Michon A.M. Cruciat C.M. Remor M. Hofert C. Schelder M. Brajenovic M. Ruffner H. Merino A. Klein K. Hudak M. Dickson D. Rudi T. Gnau V. Bauch A. Bastuck S. Huhse B. Leutwein C. Heurtier M.A. Copley R.R. Edelmann A. Querfurth E. Rybin V. Drewes G. Raida M. Bouwmeester T. Bork P. Seraphin B. Kuster B. Neubauer G. Superti-Furga G. Nature. 2002; 415: 141-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (3998) Google Scholar). Our observations that Raf60 co-immunoprecipitates and co-fractionates by gel filtration with Rpd3 further demonstrates that Raf60 stably associates with this complex. Raf60 does not appear to be associated with any other HDAC complex, as the HDAC activity associated with Raf60 is dependent on Rpd3. The composition of the yeast Rpd3 and mammalian Class I HDAC complexes have been highly conserved during evolution. However, the primary sequence of Raf60 does not appear to have been highly conserved among eukaryotes. It remains possible that there are functional homologues in mammals and other organisms that play similar roles. The role of Raf60 in the Rpd3 complex remains unclear; however our results indicate that it is essential for Rpd3 activity in vitro, and our genetic analysis suggests that Raf60 is required for functions that are similar to Rpd3 in vivo. Our observation that Raf60 is required for normal repression of PHO5 and INO1 suggests that it is essential for the ability of the Rpd3 complex to properly regulate the expression of these genes. Other laboratories have shown that the Rpd3 complex binds and deacetylates the PHO5 and INO1 promoters (30Kurdistani S.K. Robyr D. Tavazoie S. Grunstein M. Nat. Genet. 2002; 31: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar, 50Vogelauer M. Wu J. Suka N. Grunstein M. Nature. 2000; 408: 495-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). Thus, the derepression of these genes in raf60Δ cells is likely a consequence of the inability of the Rpd3 complex to deacetylate histones at these promoters. Although Raf60 lacks a recognizable DNA binding domain, it is possible that it is involved in nucleosome and/or histone recognition. Indeed, the potential bromodomain present in Raf60 could be involved in histone recognition, as it has been shown for other bromodomains (47de la Cruz X. Lois S. Sanchez-Molina S. Martinez-Balbas M.A. BioEssays. 2005; 27: 164-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). The Rpd3 HDAC complex is composed of several subunits, yet the precise roles of many of these subunits remain unclear. Rpd3 appears to be enzymatically active only in association with other components of the complex, and mutations in several of these components result in phenotypes similar to rpd3 mutants, indicating that they are required for the normal function of the Rpd3 complex in vivo. Further studies will help decipher the roles of these subunits and reveal mechanisms that regulate Rpd3 HDAC activity and target specificity and may provide insights into similar mechanisms that regulate mammalian cell growth and apoptosis and contribute to human cancer and other disease."

The core 2 GnT gene has six exons and produces three alternatively spliced transcripts. Gsl5 regulates only the expression of the kidney-type mRNA, which is transcribed from the most 5′-upstream exon. By introducing a 159-kb bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) clone that carries the mouse core 2 GnT gene and its 5′-upstream region into DBA/2 mice that carry a defective Gsl5 allele, we were able to rescue the deficient phenotype. The BAC clone was subsequently engineered to replace the core 2 GnT gene with the sequence of enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) as a reporter by an inducible homologous recombination system in Escherichia coli. The transgenic mice derived from the modified BAC clone expressed EGFP in the kidney, which suggests that the candidate Gsl5 is in the 5′-upstream region of the core 2 GnT gene. Sequence analysis of the 5′-upstream regions of the BAC clone and DBA/2 genomic DNA revealed a candidate sequence for Gsl5 at about 5.5 kb upstream of exon 1. This sequence consisted of eight repeats of two GT-rich units in the wild-type mice, whereas it consisted of only one pair of GT-rich units with a minor modification in the DBA/2 mice. Transgenic mice produced with the EGFP reporter gene construct that included this candidate sequence expressed EGFP exclusively in the proximal straight tubular cells of the kidney. These results indicated that this unique repeat is indeed the Gsl5, and it is a cis-regulatory element responsible for proximal straight tubule cell-specific transcriptional regulation.

Biochem. 2003; 72: 643-691Crossref PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar, 2Haltiwanger R. Lowe J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2004; 73: 491-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (649) Google Scholar). The glycan structures of these complex glycoconjugates change during the processes of embryogenesis, differentiation, and malignant transformation (3Varki A. Glycobiology. 1993; 3: 97-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (5004) Google Scholar). The synthesis of glycan structures begins in the endoplasmic reticulum and is completed in the Golgi apparatus, where most of the structural variations are produced. The biosynthetic pathways that produce this level of diversity are considered to be strictly regulated in tissue- and stage-specific procedures as the result of the ordered expression of glycosyltransferase activities within the Golgi apparatus. However, the molecular mechanisms remain to be revealed and constitute an important issue in glycobiology research. We focused on the polymorphic expression of kidney glycolipids among inbred strains of mice, and we found a single autosomal gene that controls the expression of a glycolipid (Galβ1-4(Fucα1-3)GlcNAcβ1-6(Galβ1-3)GalNAcβ1-3Galα1-4Galβ1-4Glcβ1-ceramide (GL-Y) 2The abbreviations used are: GL-YGalβ1-4(Fucα1-3)GlcNAcβ1-6(Galβ1-3)GalNAcβ1-3Galα1-4Galβ1-4Glcβ1-ceramidecore 2 GnTcore 2 β-1,6-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferaseBACbacterial artificial chromosomeEGFPenhanced green fluorescent proteinPFGEpulse field gel electrophoresisRTreverse transcriptionGL-XGalβ1-3GalNAcβ1-3Galα1-4Galβ1-4Glcβ1-ceramideLeXLewis X antigenntnucleotide. ) through the regulation of β-1,6-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase (β6GlcNAc-T) activity (4Sekine M. Hashimoto Y. Inagaki F. Yamakawa T. Suzuki A. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1990; 108: 103-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). We named this gene Gsl5 and mapped the Gsl5 locus to chromosome 19 (5Sekine M. Sakaizumi M. Moriwaki K. Yamakawa T. Suzuki A. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1989; 105: 680-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). DBA/2 and other several strains of mice carry a recessive allele for Gsl5, which originated from Mus musculus, Asian subspecies (6Sekine M. Kikkawa Y. Takahama S. Tsuda K. Yonekawa H. Suzuki A. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2002; 132: 387-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). We have made the following observations regarding Gsl5. 1) The amino acid sequence deduced from the cDNA sequence of Gsl5-controlled β6GlcNAc-T is identical to that of the mouse core 2 β6GlcNAc-T (core 2 GnT). 2) The mouse core 2 GnT gene produces three alternatively spliced transcripts, and Gsl5 controls only one of these, transcribed from exon 1, which is located closest to the 5′ end. 3) Gsl5 controls the activity of β6GlcNAc-T, whose substrates are the glycolipid Galβ1-3GalNAcβ1-3Galα1-4Galβ1-4Glcβ1-ceramide (GL-X) and the oligosaccharide Galβ1-3GalNAcα- and β-p-nitrophenyl derivatives. 4) In addition to the glycolipid, glycoproteins that bear the core 2-LeX epitope (Galβ1-4(Fucα1-3)GlcNAcβ1-6(Galβ1-3)GalNAc-) are regulated by Gsl5. 5) Gsl5 controls the level of mRNA that encodes β6GlcNAc-T in a kidney proximal tubule cell-specific manner (7Sekine M.

We postulated that Gsl5 might be a kidney-specific element in transcriptional regulation. It appeared to be an excellent candidate for the analysis of tissue-specific regulation mechanisms. However, the molecular basis of Gsl5 could not be addressed easily, as cultured cells that maintain the expression of Gsl5-regulated core 2 GnT are not available at present. In addition, in our preliminary experiments, even primary cultures of mouse proximal tubule cells lost the expression of kidney-specific core 2 GnT mRNA within 48 h. These results compelled us to use an in vivo genetic approach. We introduced a clone of a bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) containing the entire core 2 GnT gene derived from a dominant mouse strain into Gsl5-deficient DBA/2 mice, and we tested whether the wild-type BAC clone was able to rescue the defective phenotype of the DBA/2 mice. One clone rescued the defective phenotype and produced GL-Y glycolipid and glycoproteins with the core 2-LeX epitope in the kidneys of transgenic mice. In addition, we were able to modify the BAC clone by homologous recombination and to define the region of the candidate sequence. Here we present for the first time evidence that Gsl5 is a unique cis-regulatory element that controls kidney proximal tubular cell-specific transcription. BAC Rescue Experiments—A mouse CITB BAC library (Research Genetics/Invitrogen) was screened by PCR, and one BAC clone carrying the core 2 GnT gene was isolated. The closed circular form of BAC DNA was purified using an alkaline lysis and cesium chloride gradient ultracentrifugation protocol (10Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 1.119-1.122Google Scholar). After overnight dialysis, the DNA was diluted to a concentration of 3 ng/μl in TE buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.1 mm EDTA) and microinjected into pronucleus stage oocytes isolated from DBA/2 mice. The microinjected oocytes were transplanted into pseudo-pregnant ICR mice. The resulting mice were screened by PCR analysis with PCR primers, BAC-1 and BAC-2, for the BAC vector using genomic DNA purified from tail biopsies. The primer sequences are shown in Table 1. One transgenic line was established by mating the founder mouse and DBA/2 mice.TABLE 1Primers used for PCR and GET recombinationBAC-15′-AGGGATTGGCTGAGACGAAA-3′BAC-25′-TGGCAATGAAAGACGGTGAG-3′GNT-3′5′-GCAAAAATGAAGACAGAGCC-3′GNT-205′-GAGATCAGAAGCCACAGACT-3′GNT-225′-AGTCCCAGGTTTTCCGTGTT-3′GNT-265′-CAGGACACTGGAGGAAACAT-3′GNT-285′-CTGGAACCCAATGAAACCTT-3′GNT-295′-AGCCGATCCAGCAGTGTTTC-3′GNT-385′-GTCACCCTGTAAAATCTTGG-3′GNT-945′-ACTTGGGAATCCCGAAACTAAAGATGTAAT-3′GNT-1035′-AAAGCATTACTGTTCCCCGAGGTTC-3′GNT-170Xho5′-GATCTCGAGAGTTCAAATCCCAGCACCCA-3′GNT-22Xho5′-ATCCTCGAGAGTCCCAGGTTTTCCGTGTT-3′GNT-23Hd5′-GCTAAAGCTTTTGGGTTCCAGGTTCTTTCC-3′EGFP-R5′-TGTGGCCGTTTACGTCGCCG-3′EGFP-15′-TGGTGAGCAAGGGCGAGGAG-3′EGFP-35′-ACTGGAACAACACTCAACCCTATCT-3′EGFP-65′-CTCGTCCATGCCGAGAGTGA-3′kana-s5′-TGACCGCTTCCTCGTGCTTT-3′GNT-egfpaLowercase letters correspond to the sequences in pEGFP-N35′-GTGGAGGGAAAGAACCTGGAACCCAATGAAACCTTGATTTTAATGGGTTTatggtgagcaagggcgaggagc-3′GNT-kanaaLowercase letters correspond to the sequences in pEGFP-N35′-CTGATTAGTTCTCGAGGCTGACATTTTTCACTGGCCTCTTTCCCAATCACccagagtcccgctcagaag-3′a Lowercase letters correspond to the sequences in pEGFP-N3 Open table in a new tab To examine the expression of mRNA for core 2 GnT, total RNA samples from the kidneys or other tissues of the transgenic mice were subjected to RT-PCR. Omniscript™ reverse transcriptase (Qiagen) was used, and the PCR was performed with the following primers: GNT-28, for the kidney-type cDNA; GNT-29, for the ubiquitous-type cDNA; and GNT-38, the common antisense primer. Kidney neutral glycolipids were isolated and identified as described previously (6Sekine M. Kikkawa Y. Takahama S. Tsuda K. Yonekawa H. Suzuki A. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2002; 132: 387-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Briefly, total glycolipids were extracted from kidneys in a chloroform/methanol mixture. The neutral glycolipid fraction was eluted from a DEAE-Sephadex A-25 column and subjected to mild alkaline treatment. After neutralization, the neutral glycolipid fractions were desalted on a Sephadex LH-20 column and analyzed by TLC. Glycolipids were visualized by spraying the TLC plates with an orcinolsulfuric acid reagent and heating at 110 °C. Microsomal fractions of mouse kidneys were prepared as described previously (9Sekine M. Taya C. Kikkawa Y. Yonekawa H. Takenaka M. Matsuoka Y. Imai E. Izawa M. Kannagi R. Suzuki A. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 1129-1135Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Protein content was determined using the BCA reagent (Pierce). The protein samples (20 μg) were applied to an SDS-polyacrylamide 3-15% gradient gel, electrophoresed, and blotted to an Immobilon-P membrane (Millipore Corp.). The IgM monoclonal antibody SA024, which recognizes the carbohydrate epitope Galβ1-4(Fucα1-3)GlcNAcβ1-6(Galβ1-3)GalNAc, and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgM antibody were used. Peroxidase activity was detected with the ECL kit (Amersham Biosciences). Modification of the BAC Clone by Homologous Recombination in Escherichia coli—The BAC clone that contained Gsl5 was modified to replace the core 2 GnT gene with the EGFP reporter gene using an inducible homologous recombination system, GET recombination, in E. coli (11Narayanan K. Williamson R. Zhang Y. Stewart A.F. Ioannou P.A. Gene Ther. 1999; 6: 442-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). The 6578-bp pGETrec plasmid, which contains the E. coli recE and recT genes and the bacteriophage λ gam gene in a polycistronic operon (donated by Dr. P. A. Ioannou, The Royal Children's Hospital, Melbourne, Australia), was electroporated into E. coli DH10B that carried the BAC clone. The DH10B cells that carried both the BAC clone and pGETrec were prepared for recombination. The expression levels of the recE, recT, and gam genes were induced by the addition of l-arabinose to a final concentration of 0.2% (w/v) for an additional 40-min incubation. The cells were harvested and made electrocompetent (10Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 1.119-1.122Google Scholar). The PCR product that contained the EGFP/kanr cassette was amplified using the GNT-egfp and GNT-kana primers (Table 1). In Table 1, the capital letters (50 nt) correspond to the homology-targeting arms of the genomic sequences, and the lowercase letters refer to those used for primer amplification of the EGFP/kanr cassette. The pEGFP-N3 vector (Clontech) was used as the template. The purified PCR product (300-500 ng) was then electroporated into the DH10B cells that carried both the BAC clone and pGETrec (12Orford M. Nefedov M. Vadolas J. Zaibak F. Williamson R. Ioannou P.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 84Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). PCR screening was performed to identify recombinant clones using the combination of primer sets designed for the sequences of the BAC clone and the inserted PCR product. We obtained one recombinant clone in which the EGFP/kanr cassette replaced the core 2 GnT gene. The modified BAC DNA was digested with SacII or SalI and analyzed by pulse field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) (10Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 1.119-1.122Google Scholar). The closed circular form of the recombinant BAC DNA was purified and microinjected into pronucleus stage oocytes obtained from C57BL/6 mice, as described above for the original BAC clone. To identify transgenic mice, PCR analysis was performed with the GNT-22 and EGFP-R primers. The 707-bp fragment of the EGFP gene was amplified by PCR using the EGFP-1 and EGFP-6 primers with kidney total RNA as the template. To ensure that the PCR products were not derived from some contamination of the genomic DNA, a negative control reaction without reverse transcriptase was performed. Three transgenic mouse lines were established by mating each founder animal with C57BL/6 mice. An MZ FLIII fluorescence stereomicroscope (Leica) with a filter for green fluorescent protein was used for the histological observations. Sequencing of the BAC Clone and the Corresponding DBA/2 Genomic DNA—The BAC clone was digested with BssHII and SalI. A 40-kb fragment from the 5′ end of the clone, which included exon 1 and intron 1 of the core 2 GnT gene, was subcloned and sequenced using the BigDye Terminator cycle sequencing kit (Applied Biosystems) and the ABI PRISM 377 sequencer (Applied Biosystems). PCR products that corresponded to those of the BAC clone were obtained from the DBA/2 genomic DNA and were analyzed. Gsl5-EGFP Transgenesis—Using the BAC clone that included the core 2 GnT gene as the template, a PCR product was amplified with the GNT-103 and GNT-170Xho primers and was digested with XhoI. Another PCR product, which contained exon 1 of the core 2 GnT gene and its immediate 5′-flanking region, was amplified with the GNT-22Xho and GNT-23Hd primers and was digested with XhoI and HindIII. These fragments were purified using the QIAquick gel extraction kit (Qiagen). The pEGFP-N3 plasmid was digested with HindIII and DraIII. The fragment that included the EGFP gene was ligated with the two PCR fragments described above. The Gsl5-EGFP construct was then amplified by PCR using the GNT-103 and EGFP-3 primers with the ligated DNA as template, purified using the QIAquick gel extraction kit, and microinjected at a concentration of 3 ng/μl in TE buffer into pronucleus stage oocytes from C57BL/6 mice. A Gsl5-EGFP transgenic mouse was identified and established by mating the founder animal with C57BL/6 mice. Cryostat sections (10 μm thick) from unfixed frozen kidney samples of the transgenic mouse were placed on poly-l-lysine-coated slides, dried for 5 min at room temperature, and then exposed for 16 h at -20 °C to the vapor of formaldehyde produced from a filter paper soaked in 37% formaldehyde solution in a tightly closed plastic box (13Jockusch H. Voigt S. Eberhard D. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 2003; 51: 401-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). After fixation, the sections were washed with TBS-Ca buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm CaCl2). An MZ FLIII fluorescence stereomicroscope (Leica) with a filter for green fluorescent protein was used. Then the sections were incubated, after preincubation in TBS-Ca buffer containing 10% goat serum, with rabbit polyclonal antibody against keyhole limpet hemocyanin-conjugated C-terminal peptide, (C)TATEDTFKDTANLVKEDSDV, of mouse megalin which is a member of low density lipoprotein receptor and is localized at the proximal tubule cells (14Zou Z. Chung B. Nguyen T. Mentone S. Thomson B. Biemesderfer D. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 34302-34310Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar), and stained with goat anti-rabbit IgG conjugated with Alexa Fluor 543 (Molecular Probes). The stained sections were observed under an LSM510 laser scanning confocal microscope (Carl Zeiss). For Western blotting of the EGFP protein, kidney homogenates were subjected to SDS-PAGE (10% polyacrylamide gel). The affinity-purified anti-EGFP monoclonal antibody JL-8 was purchased from Clontech. The secondary antibody was peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and the ECL Advance system (Amersham Biosciences) was used for visualization. BAC Rescue Experiments—The transgenesis of DBA/2 mice with a 159-kb BAC clone (BAC367O1) that contains the core 2 GnT gene rescued the defective kidney-specific transcription of the enzyme (Fig. 1A). The core 2 GnT gene consists of at least six exons spanning about 45 kb and produces three alternatively spliced transcripts (8Sekine M. Nara K. Suzuki A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27246-27252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The kidney-type transcript is composed of exons 1-3; the ubiquitous-type contains exons 1′, 2, and 3, as well as an additional transcript, which was cloned from MDAY-Dw33 cells established from a DBA/2 mouse and encompasses exons 1″-1, 1″-2, 2, and 3. 3C. E. Warren, GenBank™ accession number MMU19265. Exons 2 and 3 are common to these three transcripts. The coding region is included only in exon 3, which indicates that the same protein is produced from the three different transcripts. BAC367O1 has 24 kb of the 5′-flanking region of exon 1, 45 kb of exons 1-3, and 90 kb of the 3′-flanking region of exon 3, giving a total size of 159 kb. The transgenic mice that carried the BAC vector sequence in their genomic DNA expressed the kidney-type transcript of core 2 GnT as well as the ubiquitous-type transcript in their kidneys (Fig. 1, B and C). Four of six transgenic F1 offspring were transgenic. These mice expressed the GL-Y glycolipid and glycoproteins that incorporated the core 2-LeX, which are expressed in dominant-type mice but not in DBA/2 mice (Fig. 1, D and E). The two nontransgenic F1 mice expressed neither GL-Y nor the glycoproteins. Modification of the BAC Clone by Homologous Recombination—We modified the BAC clone using the homologous recombination system in its host E. coli strain DH10B. The targeting arm of the GNT-egfp primer was designed for exon 1 of the core 2 GnT gene and that of GNT-kana was designed for the 3′-noncoding region of the core 2 GnT gene, so that the core 2 GnT gene (45 kb) was replaced with the EGFP/kanr cassette (2857 bp) (Fig. 2A). Electroporation of the EGFP/kanr cassette followed by selection with chloramphenicol and kanamycin resulted in the isolation of a number of clones that were resistant to both antibiotics. However, we obtained only one clone (rBACegfp) that showed PCR products that spanned the recombination junctions, which were amplified with the primer sets GNT-22/EGFP-R and kana-s/GNT-3′ (Fig. 2B). The recombinant also contained the EGFP gene (EGFP-1/EGFP-6 primer set) but not the core 2 GnT gene (GNT-26/GNT-38). PFGE analysis demonstrated that the SacII 53- and 29-kb fragments and the SalI 9- and 72-kb fragments in the original BAC disappeared, and the new SacII 40-kb and SalI 35-kb fragments were detected, indicating that the SacII and SalI restriction sites in exon 3 of the core 2 GnT gene were deleted (Fig. 2C). The rBACegfp construct was introduced into mice, generating three transgenic lines (Fig. 3A). RT-PCR analysis showed that each rBACegfp transgenic line expressed EGFP mRNA (Fig. 3B) in the kidneys. Fluorescence stereomicroscopy detected EGFP fluorescence in the corticomedullary region of the kidney (Fig. 3C). EGFP was not detected in the kidney medulla. Sequencing of the BAC Clone and the Corresponding DBA/2 Genomic DNA—The alignment of the 24-kb sequence, which includes the region 5′-upstream of the core 2 GnT gene in BAC367O1, and the DBA/2 genome revealed five deletions and four insertions of >20 nt as well as a number of single nucleotide polymorphisms in the DBA/2 genome (data not shown). Two exons of the riboflavin kinase (Rfk) gene were detected at the 5′ end of the BAC clone in the reverse direction, which represents the border of the core 2 GnT gene. There was no significant difference in the sequences of exon 1 and its immediate flanking region extending up to -400 bp of the core 2 GnT gene between BAC367O1 and the DBA/2 genome (AB219562 and AB219563). The TATA box was detected in both sequences at about 30 bp upstream of exon 1, where the kidney-type mRNA is transcribed as reported in previous paper (8Sekine M. Nara K. Suzuki A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27246-27252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). We found that DBA/2 contained an ∼350-bp deletion at 5.5 kb upstream of exon 1 (AB219561). The corresponding region of BAC367O1 included a unique tandem repeat (AB219560) (Fig. 4A), which consisted of a GT-rich, 16-nt unit (A,TGTGTGTGTGTATGTA) plus a GT-rich, 36-nt unit (B, TGGGTTTGTGTGTATGTGTT-TGTGTGGTTATATGTA). BAC367O1 contained these units repeated eight times: A-B-A′-B-A-B-B-A-B′-A-B′-A-B-A-B-A′, where A′ (TGTGTGTGTATGTA) is 2 nt shorter than A, and B′ has a C substitution for the T of TGGGTTT...in B. In contrast, DBA/2 had only one A″-B″, in which A″ (TGTGTGTGTTAGTGTATGTA) is 4 nt longer than the wild-type A, and B″ has an A substitution for the G of TGGGTTTGTGTGTATG... in B. We performed PCR analysis to determine the correlation between this tandem repeat and the expression of GL-Y in the inbred strains of mice that lacked GL-Y in their kidneys, i.e. MSM, JF1, BLG2, KJR, CHD, and SWN. All six strains had the same deletion. Mus spretus, which is the closest species to M. musculus, which does not express GL-Y, also had this deletion. On the other hand, A/Wy, BALB/c, C57BL/6, and PGN/2 mice that expressed GL-Y in their kidneys had PCR products of the same length as that of BAC367O1 (Fig. 4B). These correlations support the notion that this deletion is a candidate for the recessive Gsl5. Gsl5-EGFP Transgenesis—The Gsl5-EGFP construct shown in Fig. 5, A and B (AB234879), was introduced into C57BL/6 oocytes, and one transgenic line was established. RT-PCR analysis showed that the expression of EGFP was restricted to the kidney (Fig. 5C). Although the submaxillary gland showed slight contamination of the genomic DNA, we could not find EGFP mRNA in the liver, spleen, submaxillary gland, heart, or lung tissues of the transgenic mouse. EGFP fluorescence was detected in the proximal tubule cells in the corticomedullary region of the kidney (Fig. 6A). EGFP was not detected in either the medulla or outer cortex regions. Confocal microscopy at a higher magnification demonstrated that EGFP was localized at the proximal straight tubule cells, and megalin distribution at the luminal side of proximal tubule cells supported the EGFP localization (Fig. 6B). Western blotting with the anti-EGFP antibody confirmed that EGFP protein was expressed in the kidneys of transgenic mice (Fig. 6C). Thus, we were able to establish a transgenic mouse line that expresses EGFP in the kidneys. Taken together, these results demonstrate that the Gsl5-EGFP construct contains a kidney-specific cis-element and that A-B-A″-B-A-B-B-A-B′-A-B′-A-B-A-B-A′ is absolutely required for the transcription of the core 2 GnT gene in a proximal straight tubule cell-specific manner. We cloned the mouse core 2 GnT cDNA, showed that this gene is transcribed in a kidney-specific manner (8Sekine M. Nara K. Suzuki A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27246-27252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), and investigated the elements involved in the regulation process defined by Gsl5. During a search for the core 2 GnT gene, we obtained a clone containing the 5′ end of the kidney-type cDNA from a λ library of the mouse genome. This clone included about 4.5 kb of the 5′-upstream region of the transcriptional start site of kidney-type cDNA and had a TATA box-like sequence at about -30 nt. However, in our preliminary promoter assays using primary cultures of mouse kidney proximal tubule cells and luciferase as the reporter, we did not find any promoter activity in the 5′-upstream region of exon 1 of the core 2 GnT gene, even up to about -4500 nt (data not shown). As the primary culture rapidly lost the expression of kidney-type mRNA, promoter activity was assayed although mRNA expression was still maintained. The 5′-upstream region of the 4.5-kb fragment seemed to be insufficient. To investigate further the longer 5′- and 3′-flanking regions of the core 2 GnT gene, we used BAC-mediated transgenesis. BAC clones can stably maintain DNA fragments of up to 300 kb (16Shizuya H. Birren B. Kim U.J. Mancino V. Slepak T. Tachiiri Y. Simon M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 8794-8797Crossref PubMed Scopus (1381) Google Scholar) and are known to be useful in identifying cis-regulatory elements that lie far from the coding region (17Nielsen L.B.

The BAC clone BAC367O1, which contains the core 2 GnT gene, was able to rescue the defective phenotype of DBA/2 in terms of the kidney-specific transcription of the gene, which suggests that the Gsl5 locus that plays a key role in the transcriptional regulation of core 2 GnT is contained within this clone. Exon 1, which is transcribed in a kidney-specific manner, is located the farthest 5′-upstream, and the Gsl5-deficient DBA/2 mice retain the ubiquitous-type mRNA, which is transcribed from exon 1′, located 17 kb downstream of exon 1. Gsl5 should lie either 5′-upstream of exon 1 on BAC367O1 or in intron 1 between exons 1 and 1′. BAC engineering using the GET recombination system excluded the possibility that Gsl5 is in intron 1. The engineered BAC clone, rBACegfp, has the EGFP gene inserted between exon 1 and the 3′ end of the core 2 GnT gene, and it expresses EGFP in a kidney-specific manner, despite lacking the region between intron 1 and exon 3 of the core 2 GnT gene. Therefore, Gsl5 is located 5′-upstream of the 24-kb fragment. As a reporter, EGFP has the advantage of being directly visualized in vivo with high sensitivity and without any further treatments (19Yu Y.A. Szalay A.A. Wang G. Oberg K. Luminescence. 2003; 18: 1-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). We analyzed the 24-kb upstream region of exon 1 and the corresponding genomic DNA sequence of DBA/2 mice. A candidate for Gsl5 was located about 5.5 kb upstream of exon 1, where the unique sequence was tandemly repeated eight times in BAC367O1. However, a similar sequence was repeated only once in the DBA/2 genome. We found binding sites for several known trans-acting factors, such as CCAAT/enhancer binding protein (C/EBP)"

Science. 1999; 284: 1790-1795Crossref PubMed Scopus (635) Google Scholar, 2Bravo A. Serrano-Heras G. Salas M. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 2005; 29: 25-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The inherent compartmentalization of DNA replication within such structures, also named replicative complexes, allows surface catalysis, which increases the efficiency of the replicative process (3Lyle J.M. Bullitt E. Bienz K. Kirkegaard K. Science. 2002; 296: 2218-2222Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Little is known, however, about the architecture of replicative complexes and the role of structural proteins in their formation and/or maintenance. These structural proteins probably provide a framework responsible for recruitment and organization of the essential components involved in the replication process. DNA replication of the Bacillus subtilis phage ϕ29 has been studied extensively in vitro (4Salas M. Genet. Eng. 1999; 21: 159-171Crossref Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 5Meijer W.J.J Horcajadas J.A. Salas M. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2001; 65: 261-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar) and has also been employed as a model system to study membrane-associated DNA replication (6Meijer W.J.J Lewis P.J. Errington J. Salas M. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4182-4190Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 7Meijer W.J.J Serna-Rico A. Salas M. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 39: 731-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). These latter studies showed that the phage-encoded membrane protein p16.7 is required for efficient in vivo ϕ29 DNA replication. The dimeric p16.7 protein contains an N-terminal transmembrane domain (residues 1–20), a coiled-coil region (residues 30–60), and a functional dimeric C-terminal domain (residues 63–130, named p16.7C) (8Muñoz-Espín D. et al.J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 50437-50445Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). p16.7C can bind unspecifically to both single-stranded and double-stranded (ds) 3The abbreviation used is: ! dsdouble-stranded. DNA. In addition to dimers, p16.7C can form multimers. Multimerization is important for its DNA binding mode in vitro and is probably required for proper compartmentalization and membrane anchorage of viral ϕ29 DNA during replication in vivo (8Muñoz-Espín D. et al.J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 50437-50445Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar, 9Serna-Rico A. Muñoz-Espín D. Villar L. Salas M. Meijer W.J.J EMBO J. 2003; 22: 2297-2306Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Structural studies revealed that a p16.7C dimer is an elongated molecule defined by a dimeric six helical fold that is able to form larger oligomeric structures (10Asensio J.L. Albert A. Muñoz-Espín D. Gonzalez C. Hermoso J.A. Villar L. Jiménez-Barbero J. Salas M. Meijer W.J.J J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 20730-20739Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). double-stranded. Protein Crystallization and Data Collection—Protein p16.7C was overexpressed and purified to homogeneity as described previously (10Asensio J.L. Albert A. Muñoz-Espín D. Gonzalez C. Hermoso J.A. Villar L. Jiménez-Barbero J. Salas M. Meijer W.J.J J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 20730-20739Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Crystallization experiments were carried out with a p16.7C solution at 10 mg/ml containing 50 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, 200 mm NaCl. Protein crystallization was achieved by microbatch techniques under oil. 1 μl of the protein solution was mixed with a solution containing a 1 mm 16-mer annealed complementary oligonucleotide with sequence 5′-CCGGTGGATCCACCGG-3′. DNAs of different lengths with or without cohesive ends were also tried for crystallization. However, DNA molecules with sizes longer than 16 base pairs produced amorphous solids or severe twined crystals and DNA molecules shorter than 14 base pairs preclude crystallization. Prismatic crystals (0.1 × 0.1 × 0.2 mm) appeared after 2 or 3 days of incubation at 20 °C. Crystals were transferred to a solution containing 30% glycerol and mounted in a fiber loop and frozen at 100 K in a nitrogen stream. X-ray diffraction data were collected in a CCD detector using the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility Grenoble synchrotron radiation source at wavelength 0.91 at the BM16 beam-line. Diffraction data were processed using MOSFLM (11Leslie A.G.W Machin J.R. Papiz M.Z. Proceedings of the CCP4 Study Weekend. SERC Daresbury Laboratory, Warrington, UK1987: 39-50Google Scholar). Structure Determination and Refinement—The x-ray structure of p16.7C in complex with DNA was solved by molecular replacement at 2.9 Å using the coordinates of the x-ray structure of the unbound p16.7C (AMoRe) (12Navaza J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1994; 50: 157-163Crossref Scopus (5030) Google Scholar). The electron density map calculated with the phases of this model was good enough to manually refine the residues of the six asymmetric peptidic chains (protein p16.7 residues 66–129). This model was then refined using the simulated annealing routine of CNS (13Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Acta Crystallgr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16979) Google Scholar). Several cycles of restrained refinement with REFMAC5 (14Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallgor. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1997; 53: 240-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (13914) Google Scholar) and iterative model building with O (15Jones T.A. Zon J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallgor. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13014) Google Scholar) were carried out. The electron density map for the DNA was poor but allowed the model of the asymmetric moiety of the oligonucleotide used in the crystallization experiments. DNA structure was first considered as a rigid body and refined manually on a graphic station and was, afterward, included in a restrained refinement. Although both the R and Rfree dropped by the inclusion of the DNA model on the refinement, only slight improvement of the electron density is observed after the refinement. Calculations were performed using CCP4 programs (16Bailey S. Acta Crystallgr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The final model was refined by iterative maximum likelihood positional and traslation, libration, and screw rotation displacement refinement (14Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallgor. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1997; 53: 240-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (13914) Google Scholar). Tight non-crystallographic restraints between different protein chains were applied throughout the refinement but they were loosened in the last cycle of refinement. The stereochemistry of the model was verified with PROCHECK (17Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar). Ribbon figures were produced using MOLSCRIPT (18Kraulis P.J. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1991; 24: 946-950Crossref Google Scholar) and RASTER (19Merritt E.A. Murphy M.E.P Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 869-873Crossref PubMed Scopus (2859) Google Scholar). The accessible surface area of p16.7C dimer and protomer was calculated with the program “naccess” from LIGPLOT package (20Wallace A.C. Laskowski R.A. Thornton J.M. Protein Eng. 1995; 8: 127-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (4434) Google Scholar).

Interestingly, three p16.7C dimers, arranged side by side defining a deep dsDNA binding cavity, form a functional dsDNA binding unit (Fig. 1A). To our knowledge, the arrangement of three dimers forming a roughly half circular DNA binding site has not been reported before. There are only few structural differences between the DNA bound and unbound p16.7C dimers, which are mainly confined to the C-terminal tails (Fig. 1B). These tails, which are disordered in the apo form, become ordered in the p16.7C-DNA complex due to intermolecular contacts between p16.7C dimers. The specific organization of the p16.7C dimers in the dsDNA binding unit is therefore probably due to its particular self-complementary shape. The tridimeric unit formed in the presence of dsDNA most likely displays a high stability because there is a 20% decrease of the solvent accessible area in the central p16.7C dimer of the complex, and more than 68% of this buried surface area is formed by non-polar atoms (511 Å2 of a total of 746 Å2). These values are similar to those observed for the formation of other non-transient stable oligomers (21Nooren I.M. Thornton J.M. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 3486-3492Crossref PubMed Scopus (647) Google Scholar). The electron density map at the central cavity forms as a continuous envelope running parallel to a crystallographic axis that allows the localization of the dsDNA (Fig. 1C). The dsDNA fits remarkably well in the concave cavity formed by the three p16.7C dimers. In addition, this concave surface, which has a strong positive electrostatic potential (Fig. 2A), does not present edges or structural elements that can penetrate the DNA grooves. This indicates that dsDNA binding is purely driven by electrostatic forces, which is in agreement with the unspecific dsDNA binding activity observed for p16.7C (8Muñoz-Espín D. et al.J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 50437-50445Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar, 10Asensio J.L. Albert A. Muñoz-Espín D. Gonzalez C. Hermoso J.A. Villar L. Jiménez-Barbero J. Salas M. Meijer W.J.J J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 20730-20739Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). In fact, the observed structural features at the protein p16.7C-DNA interface are shared by some unspecific dsDNA binding domains of processive enzymes that are able to hold and track DNA. In particular, there is a remarkable similarity between the DNA binding surface of p16.7 and that of the processivity factors or sliding clamps (22Breyer W.A. Matthews B.W. Protein Sci. 2001; 10: 1699-1711Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). As the tridimeric p16.7C unit partially does, these molecules encircle DNA in a central ring formed by antiparallel α helices. Interestingly, the cavity is lined by a striped pattern of positively charged and hydrogen bond donor side chains above which the DNA phosphate backbone lays (Fig. 2B). Whereas these interactions would restrict a pure translational diffusion of the DNA, they may allow a screw-like displacement of the DNA helix, maintaining the DNA backbone at rather fixed positions within the complex. In accordance with this model, the electron density map of the DNA is good enough to locate the phosphate backbone but insufficient to determine the precise position and the chemical nature of the base pairs. This is a consequence of unspecific DNA binding of p16.7C and is inherent to complexes of proteins that bind DNA at multiple positions along a DNA fragment (23Murphy IV, F.V. Churchill M.E. Struct. Fold. Des. 2000; 8: R83-R89Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (119) Google Scholar). The buried solvent-accessible surface area between protein and DNA in the complex is around 300 Å2, which is approximately two times lower to that found for most other nonsequence specific DNA-protein complexes (23Murphy IV, F.V. Churchill M.E. Struct. Fold. Des. 2000; 8: R83-R89Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (119) Google Scholar). This relative low value suggests that higher order oligomerization is required for efficient binding of p16.C to DNA, which is also supported by experimental evidence (8Muñoz-Espín D. et al.J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 50437-50445Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar, 10Asensio J.L. Albert A. Muñoz-Espín D. Gonzalez C. Hermoso J.A. Villar L. Jiménez-Barbero J. Salas M. Meijer W.J.J J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 20730-20739Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Taking into account that the N-terminal extension present in native p16.7 is attached to the bacterial membrane, the only interface available for the formation of larger p16.7C oligomers would be that perpendicular to the DNA duplex and shown in Fig. 1A. In both the free and DNA bound forms, p16.7C dimers are indeed connected through this interface within the crystals (see supplemental Fig. S1). Moreover, the ∼900-Å2 area that is covered at this oligomerization interface is higher than that expected for lattice crystal contacts (21Nooren I.M. Thornton J.M. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 3486-3492Crossref PubMed Scopus (647) Google Scholar). Altogether, this suggests that p16.7 forms larger oligomers in vivo through these interface (see supplemental Fig. S2). In summary, the structure of the p16.7C-dsDNA binding unit described in this work provides insights in the process by which p16.7 anchors dsDNA to the bacterial membrane. The N-terminal coiled-coil and transmembrane domains, present in full-length p16.7 protein, are located opposite to the DNA binding cavity (Fig. 1A). This configuration is compatible with the native protein being attached to the membrane and with its proposed role of anchoring ϕ29 DNA to the membrane of the infected cell (Fig. 3). A.
